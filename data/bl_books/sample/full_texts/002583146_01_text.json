Give me credit, kind Reader, for belonging to the latter class of exiles.* Life is but a span ; and of that brief term few are the days that by a great majority of men, especially by Eng lishmen, and emphatically by younger sons aud brothers, are destined to be spent in the home of their infancy, or even in the land of their birth. But however engrossing may be their pursuits in foreign climes \u2014 however vivid the e.xcitement, cruel the misfortunes, or stirring the events wherein this portion of their life is passed \u2014 the memory of home will be intimately interwoven with all.

The following anecdote was related at a regimental mess in Sydney by a gentleman holding a high official appointment in the Colony under the Crown. Returning home on leave of absence about the year 1847, he got into conversation with an Irish cabman, who, recollecting his person, demanded respectfully \" where his honour had been this long time.\" \" In New South Wales,\" was the reply. \" Botany Bay, is it . \" pursued the driver. \" Exactly,\" said the gentleman. After a short pause, Paddy's curiosity overcoming his politeness, he whispered, \" Might I make bould to ask, Sir, what took you there ?\" \" Oh ! I went at the Queen's expense,\" answered (he other, humouring his interrogator's evident suspicions. Here Paddy's politeness recovered itself, although his suspicions were confirmed. \"Ah!\" said he, \"there's many a good man gone out that .time way,\""], [23, "VOYAGE OUT, 19 ness, wealth or ruin, joy or grief, victory or defeat, it is from home he looks for sympathy ; it is at home that he hopes, sooner or later, to display his laurels and enjoy his gains, or, should fortune have frowned upon his lot, to lay down his burthen of sorrows and reverses. The schoolboy blubbers openly, or manfully swallows his bitter feelings, as the chaise or train bears him off, for a few weeks only, from home and holidays -to Latin and Greek. The fair and happy bride, while the four greys are pawing before the home no longer hers, throws herself \u2014 all tears \u2014 into her mother's arms, though well aware that almost ere the honeymoon has waned she will embrace her once more. In such cases parting is but sweet sorrow. There is little saccharine, believe me, in the affair, when The Antipodes is the point of destination ! The immense distance and the amount of time neces sary to accomplish it, the tardiness of correspondence with home, the gradual alienation too surely springing from protracted absence, and the foreknowledge that this absence can only terminate by the repetition of the same tremendous voyage, \u2014 such are some of the drawbacks that confront him who meditates expatriation. And the mental as well as corporeal miseries of these voyages \u2014 who shall paint them ? The greater part of a precious year passed in a state of marine vegetation \u2014 the existence of a zoophyte ! Imprisonment for an in definite hiumber of \"lunar months,\" with or without hard labour, according to the humour of the elements ! for where is a wretch more literally \" cabined, cribbed, confined,\" than on board a ship \u25a0 and how can hard b 2"], [24, "20 OUR ANTIPODES. labour be more effectually carried out than when the prison itself labours ? Fortunately the spirit of man is immeasurably buoyant and elastic ; it will not long suffer depression. He must be a faint-hearted pilgrim indeed who fails to stow away hope in his wallet. There is no viaticum like it \u2014 for he may live upon it for ever ! On the afternoon of the 3d March, 1846, I arrived at Gravesend with a brother who had volunteered to see me on board, and took rooms for the night at the Falcon Hotel, from the windows of which we witnessed a somewhat ill-omened incident as a precursor of my voyage. Scarcely had we got the Agincourt within the focus of the hotel telescope, as she lay at anchor in the stream, when -a hulking collier, lumbering along with the ebb tide, fell right aboard of the barque, snapping off her jib-boom like a carrot, and inflicting other more trifling damage. To find, to fashion, and to rig so considerable a spar, caused a delay of twenty-four hours. These we passed ashore, for a glance at the state of chaos presented by the decks, cuddy, and cabins of the vessel, aggravated as it was by the aforesaid accident, and at the groups of helpless and hapless passengers and puzzled servants standing aghast amongst the baggage, was sufficient to prevent any impetuous desire on my part to take posses sion of my temporary home. Indeed to have done so would have been an effort no less heroic and not very unlike the storming of a barricade \u2014 so impregnable was its present position, not only from the piles of my"], [25, "21 VOYAGE OUT. own effects, but from the outworks raised by my neighbours. We felt that to escalade a wagon load of furniture, or to turn the flank of a breastwork of casks, containing hams and Allsop's ale, was feasible enough ; but to carry by assault a line of sofas, bandboxes, and pianos, manned by half-a-dozen Abigails, was a feat too desperate to be lightly undertaken. Relanding our forces, therefore, we passed the night and the following day at Gravesend, seeing as much of the lions of the good but not very interesting town as nearly perpetual rain would permit. Nothing very worthy of note occurred there, except perhaps that, having ordered a late dinner for my brother and self at the inn, and strolling into the coffee room in quest of distraction from feelings full of gloom, I found one of the tables occupied by a solitary indivi dual, who having already dined, and possibly discussed a pint of \" Warren's Jet \" in the shape of inn port, seemed absorbed in the contents of a memorandum book. Instinct prompting me, I addressed this gentleman with the words \u2014 \" Sir, may I take the liberty of inquiring whether you are one of my fellow-passengers in the Agincourt, for Sydney ?\" He slowly raised his head, and with an expression of countenance as disconsolate as that of Listen in the \" Illustrious Stranger,\" when the procession, conducting him to a living tomb, crosses the stage, replied gravely \u2014 \" I think, Sir, you might judge from the length of my visage that I am one of those unfortunate persons.\""], [26, "22 OUR ANTIPODES. Such was the commencement of an acquaintance \u2014 of u friendship I may say \u2014 which beguiled for me many an otherwise dull and tedious hour during the passage. Mr. F will recognise and forgive this little sketch, while he accepts the acknowledgments due to him as an intelligent and intellectual companion. In this capacity, as well as in that of the humorous aud eccentric editor of our weekly newspaper \u2014 of which more anon \u2014 my friend of the Falcon deserved the grati tude of \" all hands \" on board the good ship Agineourt. It was midnight, on the 4th March, when this gentle man and myself repaired on board for a permanence. The activity of a practised servant had reduced the hope less looking confusion of yesterday into perfect symmetry, and my cabin now contained as much comfort as could well be compressed into nine feet square. In every corner of it some notable contrivance attested the care of a provident and affectionate hand j \u2014 it is difficult to out grow a mother's care ; years cannot place one beyond its influence, nor distance beyond its reach. The babe in the cradle, the toil and clime-worn man, may equally benefit by its fosterage. \" Vive la Maternite,\" there fore, be my cry ; \u2014 from the bottom of my soul I believe \" La fraternite,\" in the French sense at least, to be an arrant humbug \u2014 and not seldom a Cain in disguise. It must be a soldier's wind that favours a vessel down the Thames and down the Channel too. We got none such. On the 5th we were at anchor in Margate Roads ; the 6th and 7th off Deal, where my new friend and my self indulged ourselves with another hour or two of British soil, laying in an additional provision of sea stock,"], [27, "23 VOYAGE OUT. together with a tolerable dinner at the Royal Hotel, and a bottle of claret, which cost us ten shillings and a pain under the waistcoat. A splendid summer-hke Sunday was the 8th of March \u2014 Agincourt trying her paces successfully with twenty other large vessels, all taking advantage of a fresh N.E. breeze, as we rushed together in a body past the mag nificent cliffs of Dover. At nine p.m. the following day we kissed hands to the \" Oar's Light \u2022\" \u2014 it was the last sight of Albion as we thought ; but the wind proving unsettled, we were enabled to send letters ashore at the Start Point by a fishing-boat on the 12th, on which evening we got fairly away \u2014 a shipful of strangers bound to a strange land. If I were writing for any but English readers, I might be tempted to extract largely from my sea-log ; but the passage of the Atlantic had nothing new for me ; and almost every English family has at least one member who, while happy in an interim of home, can enlighten the fire side circle with reminiscences rendering seafaring life a household subject in the most rurally secluded nooks of our blessed islands. Nothing, indeed, could well have been less eventful than our voyage. We had an excellent vessel of 600 tons and upwards, \u2014 well found in every particular ; an active, skilful, liberal, and attentive captain, who had one very remarkable peculiarity as a \" skipper; \" he was never heard to utter an oath, nor anything approaching the nature of one, nor indeed any expression of harsh ness or abuse towards his people ; yet the discipline on board was admirable."], [28, "24 OUR ANTIPODES. A most excellent table was kept ; the roughest weather was not admitted as an excuse for meagre fare \u2014 as is often the case in passenger ships ; \u2014 and let me hint that in the monotony of sea-life the vulgar pastime of eating and drinking is a point of more consequence than an animal possessing a soul likes altogether to confess. The cook was a ph\u0153nix in his way. Rarely visible, never heard to speak ; in heat or cold, \" blow high, blow low,\" he silently and steadfastly performed his important ministry. The caboose was his house and home, cloak and clothing, \u2014 for he had. seldom any other covering than its roof. It was miraculous to count the number and variety of dishes that, about three o'clock, issued from his narrow den, \u2014 soups, fish, joints, side-dishes, pies, puddings, \u2014 all neatly served up. Roll, and plunge, and dive as the vessel might, this inimitable sea-cook never failed us. No difficulty existed in the creation of the repast. It lay in getting its components along the deck to the cabin-table, keeping them there when on, and receiving them thankfully and discreetly with the proper implements and through the proper channels. This marine Ude, when one caught a glimpse of him, looked like an old raven in an iron cage. Some ascribed to his character a touch of the supernatural. As for me, I incline to the opinion that he was merely human, although he did cook, and cook well, for fourteen cabin passengers, and a crew of some thirty men, under all weathers and circumstances. Like the cook, there was another faithful servant on board, whose duties were performed with unswerving zeal \u2014 the cow, namely. She was a wretched-looking"], [29, "25 VOYAGE OUT. creature, all skin and bone, \u2014 and indeed the skin was quite worn off some of the acute angles of her frame ; yet, in spite of dry food and a wet berth, \u2014 for the sea constantly broke over her stall, \u2014 she yielded her daily dole of eight or ten quarts a-day throughout the passage. March 22d. \u2014 Passing Madeira, I hailed this gem of the sea as an old acquaintance, but felt no wish for a second visit. In a long voyage going ashore unsettles the mind and the body. Once at my oar I think only of the end of my pull, and have no wish to loiter on the way. Not that I would voluntarily pass by any spot worthy of notice ; but it is well to be spared the occasion of tasting the delights of dry land for a few hours or days, and of thereby renewing the feelings of repugnance arising from the exchange of spacious rooms and the wide firm earth for the prison-like cabin, and the narrow and heaving deck. To the Agincourt the great highway of nations appeared, at least on her present journey, like the most unfrequented by-way, for we touched nowhere, and spoke only one vessel during a passage of nearly sixteen weeks. What a happy endowment is the elasticity of spirit with which most of us are gifted by nature ! In what ever position chance may deposit a man for the nonce, it requires no great exertion of philosophy to discover some causes of comfort, some ingredients of amusement ; and so, indeed, I found it in the present case. I left England with a heavy heart ; yet in a short month my"], [30, "26 OUR ANTIPODES. bosom's lord sat lightly on his throne once more ; my mind gleaning employment and entertainment from a hundred unthought-of sources. On board a ship every trifling event is magnified into importance, and indeed nothing is unimportant that adds to our stock of knoAv ledge. One day a porpoise is speared from the jib boom, and you are taught by the tars who are cutting him up that a meal of salmon and beef-steaks may be obtained from his flesh, and some two gallons of good oil from his blubber. A dolphin, a flying fish, one hauled, the other coming voluntarily on board, are sub mitted to your inspection. You perceive that the former is, as far as figure goes, by no means the odd fish the Ancients have portrayed him. You cease to wonder that the latter has no peace either under the water or above it \u2014 when you find, yourself, how very good he is to eat. A grand draught of albucors takes place. Crew and passengers partake largely of the delicacy; crew and passengers pronounce it no bad substitute for mackarel; and crew and passengers soon after call fur the doctor \u2014 the lesson they learn being that this fish, though not always unwholesome, is when out of season extremely so. A perfect museum of marine ornithology is opened to your study. The several subjects are hooked and haided over the taffrail, and the indefatigable ship-surgeon, killing each of them with one drop of some \" fast speeding gear,\" proceeds to \"cure\" them with another deadly poison. It is almost terrible to see the huge albatross, twelve feet across the wings, drop stone dead as the hom\u0153opathic dose touches his palate.

Time is so carefully cut up on board ship that it is difficult to find the day very long. The breakfast at eight or nine, the lunch at twelve, the dinner at three, and the tea at seven o'clock, are all efficient time-killers. Every one throws his small store of books into the com mon stock, and after a little practice one can enjoy an hour's reading very well in the \"cleated\" arm-chair, from whose cozy depths the owner may without rising open the window, the door, or the drawers, take a book from the shelf, a dip from the inkstand, or a \"nip\" from the Jiqueur case. The old school-boy trick of blotting out each day from the calendar as it passes was performed with a mixture of pleasure and spite. Sunday and Thursday were champagne days !\u2014Wed nesday, the day on which cur newspaper, \" The Weekly Weed,\" was published. My friend of the Falcon, here tofore honourably mentioned, was, as I have said, the editor \u2014 his cabin window the \" lion's mouth,\" for the receipt of contributions. If such were furnished \u2014 well ; if not, he himself possessed so strong a determination of ideas to the pen as to be never at a loss for a couple of sheets of entertaining matter ; which moreover it was his further duty to read aloud as soon as dessert was placed on the table. A good laugh is a good thing, and we owe our worthy editor many a one.

It is painful to relate that the attempt to introduce into Australia our small friend in the red waistcoat was unsuccessful. Of a large cageful not one lived to reach Sydney. Cock-robin belongs to the lawns and drawing-room windows of England's country houses and cottages. In benighted climes, possessing neither snow nor ice, he would have no excuse to intrude where he alone of the feathered tribes finds his way and a welcome. No \u2014 the proud and patriotic little fellow could die \u2014 but he could not emigrate ! There is certainly something sacred about the person and the character of the robin: for that child of wrath the British school-boy hesitates to make the redbreast the object of a cock-shy; and even the French sportsman spares him \u2014 unless game happens to be unusually scarce. If a journal, like history, have a certain conventional dignity to uphold, it may be sadly violated by the admis sion of such trifles as the above ; but if the reader has condescended to accept the writer for a companion, he must make his account to laugh with him or at him sometimes, and to trifle with him pretty often by the way.

There were on board certain juveniles, whose chins escaped by this negotiation a terrible scrape from the sea-god's rusty razor. Although the strict discipline of a man-of-war may con fine within moderate bounds this time-honoured oppor tunity for uproarious licence, it is open to serious abuse when the scene is a trading vessel, and when \u2014 as is not impossible \u2014 the master happens to be a coarse and despotic character, and his passengers are of a more refined order. I remember a case where a military officer was roughly informed by the skipper of the vessel, in which he was a passenger on duty, that he should be shaved whether he paid the fine or not \u2022 and when the officer replied that he intended to remain in his cabin during the ceremony, but was willing to give a handsome present to the men, he was assured that he would be dragged upon deck and forced to undergo what others did who had not pre viously crossed the Line. \" My cabin is my castle,\" was the answer, \" and I shall shoot any man who attempts to enter against my will.\" The skipper laughed at this threat; and, in short, when the time arrived, a noisy half-drunken rabble be sieged his door, and, being refused admittance, proceeded to force the lock. The officer, who had no intention to trifle, had cocked his pistol and pointed it towards the door ; \u2014 when, sluice ! from some unseen source came a thin but solid jet of water, which drenched the priming of the fire-arm and struck it from his hand.

But, seriously speaking, this horse-(mariue) play is incompatible with the ordinary intercourse of different grades of men ; and brute violence, even when exerted in joke, deserves to be violently repelled. On the 4th May we sailed right through the group of Tristan Da Cunha \u2014 passing \" Nightingale\" and \" Inac cessible\" Islands on our right and left \u2014 the latter at the distance of half a mile. It is a rock-scarped table-land covered with a stunted shrub-like gorse. Several fine fresh-wrater cascades \u2014 one of them apparently as conr siderable as any in Switzerland \u2014 were seen leaping down the whole depth of the cliff, probably five hun dred feet. About six miles to our left appeared, the chief island of Tristan Da Cunha, with its snow-capped mountain in the midst. It is probably the most utterly secluded spot inhabited by man. Here resides the so-called Governor of the Group, Corporal Glass, and twenty or thirty other Europeans \u2014 most of them descendants from the one or two patriarchal pairs who were originally wrecked mere. Agincourt's approach to this solitary cluster of islands gave occasion for a forcible editorial article in The Weed.

The only feature of the meditated scheme of govern ment, worthy of record perhaps for the benefit of future statesmen, was the mode of election of the governor and his principal officers. Parties ambitious of public em ployment were to be invited to tender their terms. The best man \u2014 that is, the lowest contractor for the work required \u2014 would be chosen, and good security would be exacted for the due performance of his contract \u2014 a business-like notion, not repugnant to the dictum of Sir Robert Peel, \" that the very best men that can be found should be placed in the administration of colonial affairs !\" One of our fellow-passengers, remarkable for rather desultory habits, was nominated to the pluralist post of collector of revenue, registrar of births, &c. &c, and commissioner of woods and forests for \" Inaccessible Island\" \u2014 there not being a stick, a stiver, or a specimen of mankind on that utterly desert rock ! Fortunately the breeze freshened to half a gale of wind, and Corporal Glass had no opportunity of repu diating our bran-new constitution, as he would certainly have done \u2014 if for no better reason than his perfectly natural preference of despotic rule to a form of govern ment of a more responsible cast ! Thus wiled we away, as well as we could, the tedious and monotonous hours of a voyage to the Antipodes. I say nothing of storms and calms, breezes fair or foul, light or stiff, weather bright or hazy, hot or icy, thunder, rain, or hail, tumid clouds or minacious billows. We had our share of all these.

At this first indication of our destined bourne, those of the passengers who had previously visited New Holland, or who had adopted it for their country, began to show strong symptoms of excitement and impatience, and indeed they had occasion to suffer the pangs of hope deferred, for the slashing breeze that had brought us as straight as a crow's flight from the Cape of Good Hope, suddenly deserted us in Bass's Straits, leaving the good ship to drift about like a log within view of the islet of Rodondo, the Devil's Tower, and Hogan's Group. After forty-eight hours, however, the wind again arose, and carried us forth from this dangerous though picturesque Archipelago of rocks. For myself, the yearning to step on to the strange land likely to be my place of sojourn for some years by no means affected me to a painful degree. .Although tired of the sea and ship life, and eager to plant my foot once more on terra firma, the \" Terra Australis Incognita\" of the old navigators was not precisely the choice I should have made \u2014 if I had had one ; for in all that land there was not one human face, as far as I knew, that I had ever seen before.

Undeservedly, I say, because this harbour, originally chosen by Captain Phillip for the first convict settlement in New South Wales, was, on trial, found unfit for the purpose, and was accordingly in a few weeks abandoned for the neighbouring position of Port Jackson. c 2"], [40, "36 OUR ANTIPODES. So well founded were the objections of Phillip to Botany Bay as a point of location, that even at the present day, although only seven miles from the great city of Sydney, there are scarcely a dozen houses on its margin, whose circuit can hardly be less than twenty miles. Shortly before midday, the Agincourt passed close under the lighthouse of Port Jackson, perched upon a horizontally stratified cliff, descending plumb 300 feet into deep water ; and precisely at 1 2 o'clock we entered \" The Heads,\" that grand and appropriate portal of one of the noblest harbours in the world. Working against an adverse wind, under charge of a pilot, the good ship zigzagged her course along the seven miles of inland water connecting The Heads with Syd ney Cove ; and at 3 p.m. of an Australian mid- wintry but splendid day the anchor was dropped in that snug little haven, within a biseuit's cast of the spot where, in the year 1788, the first Governor of New South Wales pitched the tents of the first British plantation in New Holland. In spite of the undoubted beauties of Port Jackson, its glorious expanse of smooth water, its numerous lovely islets, its sweeping bays and swelling headlands, wooded down to the water edge and crested with handsome villas, there is to the stranger's eye something singularly repulsive in the leaden tint of the gum-tree foliage, and in the dry and sterile sandstone from which it springs. The trees, indeed, have no bare branches, as in an English winter, excepting those killed by bush-fires ; but the stiff hard leaves, which seem expressly formed"], [41, "37 SYDNEY. to resist the chill wind and powerful sun of an Austra lian winter, although nominally evergreen, but little deserve the epithet. On this day there was no want of cheerful accessories in and about the harbour. Its bosom was studded with swarms of pleasure-boats ; the coves were crowded with shipping. As our vessel neared the shores, in the pro cess of beating, we saw parties of horsemen and horse women cantering along the crescented slips of sand, carriages appearing and disappearing among the trees ; and, on a headland close to the town, were promenading groups of well-dressed people, amongst whom might be seen the uniform of officers and soldiers, making up a gay prism of colours iu the bright sunlight. The weather must have been by the colonists con sidered cold, although we, after the alternations of a long voyage, did not find it so. .AU those who came down to the harbour to meet the ship were warmly wrapped up ; and one gentleman's teeth, I observed, absolutely chattered under a pile of mufflers. The Health-officer and a Post-office functionary came off to us in a boat pulled by prisoners. I believe I expected to see these men chained like galley-slaves to their oars ; and was a little disappointed, perhaps, when I found them differing in nowise from an ordinary boat's crew, except in their bad rowing. So, likewise, on find ing myself dodged from deck to cuddy, from cabin to poop, by a keen-looking young man, who addressed me in a low earnest voice, I expected to have my pocket picked, when, turning sternly upon him for explana tion, I discovered his intentions to be strictly honour-"], [42, "38 OUR ANTIPODES. able. He was a newspaper reporter, doubly anxious for news, because the Agincourt, being the March mail packet from England, had arrived before the February packet. This sharp caterer for the Sydney quidnuncs, had heard that I had brought on board at Deal the latest English journal. I handed it to him, with the request that it might be returned when done with. He vanished over the ship's side, and I never saw him nor my news paper again. Like the generality of mercantile towns, viewed from the sea, Sydney, although containing nearly 50,000 inha bitants, presents from this aspect no very imposing ap pearance. It might be Waterford, or Wapping, with a dash of Nova Scotian Halifax. The main streets, built along the crests and flanks of two or three highish ridges trending inland, are unseen from the shipping ; but this very peculiarity of its site gives to Sydney a greater extent of deep water frontage than, perhaps, any other commercial city in the universe. These spines of land, or rather rock, subdivide the south shore of Port Jackson, at the spot where Sydney has arisen like a huge mushroom, into numerous small and deep basins, among which the principal are Wooloo mooloo Bay, Farm Cove, sacred to H. M.'s ships ; Syd ney Cove, and Darling Harbour ; the whole presenting capabilities for natural wharfage, such as I have never seen equalled. The new Government-house, a really handsome struc ture of stone, with its gardens and home domain, occu pies the promontory between Wooloomooloo Bay and Sydney Cove ; and thus, although close to the town, its"], [43, "39 GEORGE-STREET. privacy is completely secured by a park paling drawn across the neck of the peninsula. Beyond this fence the outer domain, an extensive government reserve, acts as one of the lungs of Sydney. Its circuit embraces nearly four miles of carriage-road and foot-path, cleverly and tastefully planned by Mrs. Macquarie, wife of the gover nor of that name, and executed under her direction by convict labour. To this lady the citizens of Sydney are indebted for a plaisance such as few of the capitals of Europe can surpass in extent and beauty. At the head of Farm Cove, encompassed by the outer domain, are the Government Botanic Gardens, comprising several acres of shrubbeiy and flower-garden, in which specimens of the vegetable productions of almost every part of the globe are assembled for the study of the scientific, and for the instruction and wonderment of the uninitiated. But let us set foot upon the soil of Australia before we attempt to sketch its features. It will be honest, I think, to lay open to my reader first impressions as they stand noted in my diary of 1846. He will find, pro bably, that the more my acquaintance with the colony became matured, the more benignant became my feelings towards it \u2014 a progressive appreciation, surely more satisfactory than an over sanguine first view, chilling by degrees down to zero. A most kind offer of bed and board from an old friend of my family met me ere I disembarked ; but pre ferring independence, I declined this hospitality; and lauding solus at the bottom of George-street, I strolled, stick in hand, my man following with my portmanteau"], [44, "40 OUR ANTIPODES. in a cab, up to Petty's hotel, a respectable, quiet esta blishment, where I remained about a fortnight before my tent was permanently pitched in Sydney. I passed my first Australian evening in rambling slowly up George-street, the main artery of the city, and down Pitt-street, the second in rank ; and should have been truly astonished at the immense extent of the former thoroughfare \u2014 the Broadway and Oxford-street of the Antipodes, 2|- miles long \u2014 and at the endless succession of well supplied and well lighted shops in both, but that certain Sydneyites, my fellow passengers, had in so loud and high a key chanted the praises of their adopted city, that, on actual inspection, I had nothing to do but to come tumbling down the gamut until I reached my own pitch note. What greater injustice to man or matter than this super-laudation ! Niagara cannot bear it. What more need be said ? Passing through the Barrack-square to mine inn, shortly before nine o'clock I found tattoo going on, the drums and fifes of the 99th regiment rattling away Mrs. Waylett's pretty old song of, \" I'd be a Butterfly,\" in the most spirited style, just as though wre were not 16,000 miles from the Horse Guards ! It was the first note of music I had heard since leaving home ; and I do not know when a more soothing and agreeable sensation pervaded my mind than at that moment, as I stood listening under the bright moonlight of this \" far countrie\" to a parcel of old well-remembered airs., that had been discarded by the London butcher-boys a quarter of a century ago ; listening among a crowd of"], [45, "POPULATION. 41 small boys and big blackguards, all of whom, according to the habit of new comers, I fully believed to be convicts and their spawn, intent one and all on exercising a right of search into the stranger's pockets. June 26th. \u2014 Sydney wants the foreign and exotic interest of other of our colonial capitals. Neither the aborigines themselves, nor any object belonging to them, nor the natives of any other country, mix with the nearly exclusively British population and products of the place. Now and then a Chinaman, with his pig's-tail and eyes, and his poking shoulders, crosses your vision, as if he had dropped, not from the clouds \u2014 although the Celestials have a right to be expected thence \u2014 but from a willow pattern soup-plate. Perhaps a specimen or two of the New Zealander, brown, broad, brawny, and deeply tat tooed, may occur. In the outskirts of the town, a chattering, half-besotted group of the wretched natives of New Holland itself, tall, and thin even to emaciation, with great woolly heads and beards and flat features, may be seen, grinning and gesticulating in each other's ugly faces in loud dispute, or making low and gracefrd bows, worthy of the old school, whilst begging a copper, or \" white money,\" from the passengers, as they loiter near the door of some pot-house. Sydney is, I think, more exclusively English in its population than either Liverpool or London. Were it not for an occasional orange-tree in full bloom, or fruit in the back yard of some of the older cottages, or a flock of little green parrots whistling as they alight for a moment on a housetop, one might fancy himself at Brighton or Plymouth."], [46, "42 OUR ANTIPODES. The construction of the buildings is blameably ill suited to a semi-tropical climate, \u2014 barefaced, smug-look ing tenements, without verandahs or even broad eaves. This fault extends even to Government House, whose great staring windows are doomed to grill unveiled, because, forsooth, any excrescence upon their stone mul lious would be heterodox to the order or disorder of its architecture. Surely a little composite licence might have been allowable in such a case and climate. Many of the private residences of Sydney and its suburbs are both handsome aud comfortable, \u2014 most of them crowded with expensive furniture, therein differing from the practice of most warm countries ; where the receiving-rooms and bed-rooms contain little beyond the muniments necessary for sitting and lying, and those of the plainest, hardest, and most undraped description. The majority of the public buildings evince proof of the profusion, of fine sandstone on the spot, \u2014 for a house may here be almost entirely built of the material from its foundation, \u2014 as well as of the solid advantages arising from convict labour, especially when so powerful an agent is wielded by a governor of such stroug masonic predilections as he whose name is affixed to the facades of most of the Sydney public institutions.* These edifices suit their purposes, no doubt, but have nothing, I think, to recommend them to the eye.

Barracks \" a convict depot, grates somewhat unplea santly on the feeling of one lately arrived from .London. In strolling homewards late this evening, I was once more attracted by the sound of music. Led by the ear, I found myself looking down into the windows of a vault or crypt below a very handsome chapel. There was evidently eating and drinking going on with great ear nestness, and speechifying intermingled with them ; and a brass band was undoubtedly playing a variety of jolly airs under the floor of a place of worship. This seemed somewhat eccentric, I thought; however, I learnt from a bystander that the meeting was nothing more than a subterranean Teetotal festival, whereof I was then taking a birds'-eye view from the pavement. June 29th. \u2014 The well-known hospitable spirit of the Sydney society developed itself in my favour this morning, in the shape of a niound of visiting cards, interlarded with numerous invitations to dinners and evening parties. I dined this day with my respected chief, Lieutenant- General Sir Maurice O'Connell, at his beautiful villa of Tarmons ; and I mention the circumstance merely to have an opportunity of remarking, that there were brisk coal fires burning in both dining and drawing-room, and that the general appliances of the household, the dress of the guests and the servants, were as entirely English as they could have been in London. The famdy like ness between an Australian and an Old Country dinner party became, however, loss striking when I found myself sipping doubtfully, but soon swallowing with relish, a plate of wallabi-tail soup , followed by a slice of boiled schnapper, with oyster sauce. A haunch of kan-"], [48, "44 OUR ANTIPODES. garoo venison helped to convince me that I was not in Belgravia.

July 1st.\u2014 House-rent in Sydney is very high, and vacant houses are very scarce. The first I took consisted of seven small rooms, without stable, courtyard, pump, kitchen range, or even bells to the rooms: rent \u00a3100 per annum for the bare walls. It was situated in the heart of the town, or at least in its pericardium. The street contained, I think, upwards of three hundred houses ; and I was compelled to be particular in giving my address \u2014 Street North, because its other ex tremity tapered off into impropriety. I had fallen by accident into the legal quarter of the city ; indeed my house had been built expressly to form two sets of chambers for gentlemen of the long robe. The door posts of nearly all my neighbours were scored with the names of barristers, attorneys, solicitors, notaries-public, and other limbs of the law, who, albeit rivals in the trade, contrive to play into each other's hands to the detriment of the public pocket. My street abutted upon the Supreme Court, and I was perfectly astonished to see the number of sleek and spruce and bewigged personages, who soon after break fast came swooping down from their rookery upon the field of their daily labours.

It was fatal in many instances to the fortunes of those infected ; and some nice little incomes were picked up by the leading advocates and their pro viders.

The lighting, and still more, the paving of the Sydney streets, are a disgrace to the city and its corporation, as well as to the people who tolerate the ill-performed duties of the latter well-paid body. The trolloirs are full (and were to the last day of my residence in New South Wales) of the most ingenious traps, dangerous to the limbs, if not to the lives of the passengers. The sewer age of the town is also shamefully bad, though no city possesses a site more favourable for that essential. Most of the drains are on the surface, and during the long periods of drought the accumulation of filth becomes beyond measure disgusting. At length comes the ex pected \" Brickfielder,\" drifting the pulverized abomi nations into every pore of the human frame, and every crevice of the houses. It is closely followed by a flood of rain, which sets all the gutters in motion, and, fortu nately for the citizens, carries away down to the sea in its torrents the thousand specimens of decomposed mat ter, which have been left to rot in the streets. The thoroughfares are infested by an innumerable host of apparently ownerless dogs \u2014 innumerable in spite of the Dog Act, that has been in force ever since the Govern ment order fulminated against the canine race in 1812. The lawless brutes range at will the town and suburbs, to the torment and terror of the lieges.

Many a luckless wight have I watched flying along the street in a cloud of dust and dogs, fresh de tachments of curs debouching upon him from every alley and court, until they vanished together round a corner, leaving me to imagine the finish. It is still worse when the military band is playing, as it does once or twice a week, in the Government domain. All the fair and fashionable are stationed around in their carriages. Let an equestrian exquisite make the small est effort at lady-killing in the shape of a curvet or a riding-school canter on the tempting turf, and instantly, from among the legs of the pedestrian spectators, rush forth the hitherto unseen canine crew, and away, away through the gum-trees and over the drain-grips, fly horseman, steed, and pack.

But more serious consequences arise sometimes from the stray dogs. Two or three times I have been the horrified witness of attacks upon children by large and fierce dogs, which would have ended fatally but for the prompt help of passers-by. 1 once saw a powerful mastiff seize a horse by the throat, between the shafts of a gig, aud pull it to the"], [52, "48 OUR ANTIPODES. ground ; nor did the ferocious beast quit its hold until killed by a blow with an iron bar. Some of the Newfoundland dogs in this country are the finest I have ever seen \u2014 much larger and handsomer than the true Labrador dog, which is neither very tall, nor very curly in the coat. Hound-like dogs, with a good deal of the shape and colour of the English fox-hound, but with none of his countenance, figure here as street mongrels. The Danish dog, the privileged attendant of aris tocratic equipages in Europe, is seen in twos and threes under every baker's cart, or joining in the foraging par ties of nameless curs.

Many of the Cornstalks, or Colonial-born men, are tall and large-boned, but the majority of those attain ing a standard above the middle height are spare, hollow chested, and have a certain weather-worn and time-worn look beyond their years. If one sees a ruddy face, it is sure to belong to a sea-faring man, an up-country bushman whose cheeks are burnt by exposure into an uniform red bronze, or to the rubicund Boniface of some tavern, whose ever-blooming roses have been well irrigated by strong waters. The women of the poorer classes look prematurely old ; many of them are absolutely frightful, yet appear to delight in tawdry dress. The children in the streets and lanes are, on the contrary, so lovely, that it is almost impossible to believe them the offspring of the hags-, their mothers.

Of the Theatre I may fairly say that, as far as dramatic talent is concerned, it is conducted at the least as well as the generality of provincial houses in England. To be sure, we are compelled to be satisfied all the year round with the efforts of stationary performers ; for it must be an eccentric Star indeed which would shoot so far out of its orbit as to reach New South Wales. In decency of demeanour the audience of the Sydney Theatre Royal is a prodigy compared with that of d 2"], [56, "52 OUR ANTIPODES. similar establishments in the seaport towns of the old country. The \" gods \" are particularly well-behaved. Even in the trying experiment, which I witnessed more than once, of a comic singer inviting the gallery to join him in a chorus, the immortals met the proposal with great moderation, and contrived to testify their approval without cudgelling down the front of the circle. The dress-boxes are always unpeopled, unless an im pulse be given by a bespeak, or by the benefit of a favourite. These appeals act as a sort of mental gadfly on the society. The herd rushes together with one consent, and disports itself in crowded discomfort ; and once more, for a month perhaps, the play-goer, whom a love of the drama only attracts, has the house all to himself. When the Sydney Theatre was first established by permission of the governor, \" Her Majesty's servants \" were Her Majesty's prisoners ! In the pit of the Sydney Theatre one misses the numerous bald heads of an European parterre, for the people of New South Wales have not yet had time to grow old. On the other hand, the eyes of the stranger wander with surprise over the vast numbers of new-born babies in the pit \u2014 three or four dozen little sucklings taking their natural refec tion, whilst their mothers seem absorbed in the interest of the piece ; their great long-legged daddies meanwhile sprawling over the benches in the simplest of costumes, \u2014 a check shirt, for instance, wide open at the breast, no braces, moleskins, and a cabbage-tree hat. It is a pleasant thing to see these good folks thoroughly enjoying themselves in this manner on a Saturday night \u2014 a week's wages and the door-key in their pockets, and all the family cares deferred till Monday morning."], [57, "53 THE CABBAGE-TREE MOB. Every one knows \u2014 at least every foreigner knows \u2014 how cold and undemonstrative is an English audience. Perhaps the warmth of the climate infuses a degree of fervour into a Sydney \" house.\" Certain it is that the \"poor players\" get a fairer share of applause than the same performances would secure at home. It would be a lesson to the used-up man of the world, to witness the raptures with which some of the public favourites, and their efforts histrionic, musical, and saltatory, are received and rewarded. Oh ! it is delicious to mark the gratified countenances, and to hear the thundering plaudits which are especially awarded to the latter branch of theatric art. Well may Madame * * *, the Sydney Columbine and Maitresse de Danse, most spherical of Sylphides, bounce like an Indian-rubber ball ; well may Signor * * * *, Harlequin and Dancing-master, half kill his fatted calves in acknowledgment of so much flattering approbation ! There are to be found round the doors of the Sydney theatre a sort of \" loafers,\" known as the Cabbage-tree mob \u2014 a class whom, in the spirit of the ancient tyrant, one might excusably wish had but one nose, in order to make it a bloody one ! These are an unruly set of young fellows, native born generally, who, not being able, perhaps, to muster coin enough to enter the house, amuse themselves by molesting those who can afford that luxury. Dressed in a suit of fustian or colonial tweed, and the emblem of their order, the low-crowned cabbage-palm hat, the main object of their enmity seems to be the ordinary black headpiece worn by respectable persons, which is ruthlessly knocked over the eyes of the wearer as he passes or enters the theatre."], [58, "54 Olill ANTIPODES. The first time I attended this house, I gave my Eng lish servant, a stout and somewhat irascible personage, a ticket for the pit. Unaware of the propensities of the Cabbagites, he was by them furiously assailed \u2014 for no better reason apparently than because, like \" noble Percy,\" \"he wore his beaver up,\" \u2014 and, his hat being driven down over his eyes and nose, in his blind rage he let fly an indiscriminate \"one, two,\" the latter of which took effect upon a policeman's snout ! \" Hinc !\" a night in the watch-house, and the neces sity of proving in the morning that the \"glaring case of assaulting a constable in the execution of his duty\" was not intentional and \" of malice aforethought.\" On one occasion I recollect two clergymen being much maltreated by members of this mischievous mob. Much has been spoken and written by influential persons in England about the hideous depravity of the Sydney populace. I do not think they deserve that character. Although the streets are ill lighted, and the police inefficient in number and organization, Sydney appears to me to have on the whole a most orderly and well-eon ducted population. Public-house licences are so profitable a source of public revenue, that perhaps too many of these conveniences for crime are permitted to exist ; yet drunkenness is kept quite as well out of sight as in English towns ; and, although a pretty strong squad of disorderlies figure in the morning reports of the Police courts, the better behaved inhabitants are not much annoyed by their misdemeanours. All strangers notice with praise the extreme tranquillity of the streets at night. Whatever debaucheries may be going on \" a huis clos \" \u2014 and Sydney is no purer perhaps"], [59, "CIVIC TRANQUILLITY. 55 than other large seaport towns \u2014 they are not prominently offensive. If a noctambulist yourself, you may indeed encounter, towards the small hours, an occasional night errant wandering in search of adventures, or having found some to his great personal damage. But he is an exception to the general rule of the social quietude of the Sydney thoroughfares. On occasions of public excitement the people of Sydney appeared to me to be not only orderly, but even unusually apathetic. To be sure, there has been heard of a case of a Police Magistrate of sixteen stone being driven by a shower of brickbats to put his horse at the railings in Hyde Park, during the polling of an' election ; and I remember one or two ludicrous instances of civic panic, on account of juvenile rioters breaking windows and squibbing off fire-works on Guy Faux day. It nearly went the length of moving the .Legislature to proceed against the unfledged rebels by Act of Council \u2014 instead of punishing them summarily by act of whip ping. But these, again, are solitary facts. I do not believe, in short, that person or property, morals or decency are more liable to peril, innocence to outrage, inexperience to imposition, in Sydney, than in London or Paris. On the contrary, I am convinced, that from our own country, not only might come to New South Wales, but actually and frequently do come, individuals of every order of society \u2014 from the practised debauche of high life to the outcast of the London back-slums \u2014 capable of giving lessons in vice, in their several degrees, to the much abused Sydneyites, and who do absolutely astonish the colonials by their superior proficiency."], [60, "56 OUR ANTIPODES. I will go so far as to admit, that some of the wildest disturbers of the public peace of Sydney are occasionally to be traced to the garrison and to the shipping. Now and then one hears of a couple of grenadiers clearing a taproom, and a knot of A B seamen may be seen battling the watch, or experimentalizing in horsemanship, to the danger of all land-lubbers. The public prints take care that red-coat revels shall not be lost to the world for want of chroniclers. The words \" Military Outrage \" invoke general attention and indignation, and the bitterest terms of newspaper vitu peration are hurled at the \"ruffian soldiery.\" In 1849 and 1850, when the roads round Sydney were infested by highwaymen, and desperate burglaries occurred nightly in the city and its purlieus ; \u2014 when hundreds of well-known convicts or expirees, many of them from Van Diemen's Land, were prowling about with no obvious mode of livelihood \u2014 their characters and haunts well known \u2014 the most shabby and absurd at tempts were made to trace these offenders to the soldiers. The army, as it is now-a-days, would be better appre ciated by the good citizens of Sydney and some other places, if they could have a taste of one of the \" fast \" regiments of former days \u2014 just to put them through a course of Tom-aud- Jerryism, and other by-gone branches of garrison discipline. Sept. 1st. \u2014 The number of auctions daily going on in Sydney is quite extraordinary ; not auctions for the pur pose of selling off the houses and effects of departed or departing persons \u2014 though these happen often enough, too often for one's belief in the permanent prosperity of"], [61, "AUCTIONS. 57 the community\u2014 but for the disposal by wholesale of imported goods, or by retail of tradesmen's stock on hand. A stranger would almost suppose that the buyers and sellers of the colony were too idle to transact busi ness without the intermediation of a paid agent. From the sale of an allotment of Crown land, or the lease of a squatting run, to a \" prime lot\" of pork, pickles, or curry powder, all are equally submitted to public outcry. The newspapers teem with advertisements such as these : \u2014 \" ABSTRACT OF SALES BY AUCTION THIS DAY.\" \" Messrs. * * * and * * *, at their Mart, at 11 o'clock, 150 doz. kangaroo skins, a second-hand gig, ship biscuit, baby-linen, damaged ironmongery, bottled fruits, castor oil, Canary birds, Bohemian glass, accordions, and the effects of a deceased clergy man, comprising robes, &c.\" Again \u2014 \" Mr. * * * will have the honour to offer to public competition, at 12 o'clock on Monday, the 4th inst., the Crow's Nest Station, in the District of Moreton Bay, with 10,000 sheep ; after which, arrowroot, blacking, lime-juice, lozenges, ladies' companions, jams, bath-bricks, damaged gunny bags, Turkey figs, tooth-brushes, 12,000 feet of prime cedar plank, a four-roomed house, an anchor and chain, a mare, a horse, and twenty pigs. \" At 3 p.m. precisely, the newly rigged copper-bottomed clipper, Mary Arine, well known in the trade ! one gross of egg-spoons, a bass-viol, a superior Europe feather-bed, two lots of land, two bales super calico, Old Tom, soup and bouilli, toys, cutlery, and a cottage piano.\" The chief attendants at these public sales are brokers and keepers of miscellaneous stores, many of them Jews either by persuasion or by descent. Those of the latter category modify their names, so as to be as little as pos sible Hebraic ; but there is no mistaking their cast of physiognomy, the most unchanging and arbitrary in the"], [62, "58 OUR ANTIPODES. world. Temporarily considered, it is not a bad sign when this people, or the Quaker tribe, throng to a place. There is honey making, depend on it, where such are seen to swarm. Sometimes, indeed, they accumulate an undue share to themselves, as may be witnessed in cer tain Irish towns. But they are generally good subjects, and obey the laws. The Sydney gentleman has no chance at these auctions; for he is known and watched by the brokers and jobbers aforesaid, and is either \"bid up\" to a ruinous price, and left to carry off his dearly-bought whistle, or is \" bid down,\" and cowed out of his lot by the apparently fierce resolve of his professional rival to have it at any cost. On one occasion, when venturing a diffident bid for a pair of carriage-horses, I was informed by a spectator that it was \" no use,\" for that \" the stout party in the yaller veskit, over yonder, wanted them very bad, and would have them.\" So after lifting the animals to a figure considerably above their worth, I was fain to yield to inexorable necessity and to the wealthy emancipist and whilom bankrupt, who had resolved to have the highest steppers in Sydney. Some persons have a taste for public outcries. In Calcutta they used to be \u2014 are now, I dare say \u2014 quite the rage. Habit soon teaches one the true value of every article offered for sale. Amateurs generally enjoy the fruits of this experience in a house-full of useless lumber. During the first year or two of my residence in Sydney, the sellings-off of families going home or into retirement were very numerous. An auction at a house of this description is quite a fashionable lounge. Gentlemanly"], [63, "59 AUCTIONS. auctioneers, whom you hesitate whether or not to admit on terms of social equality, address you by name, assure you that the article is one of undoubted vertu \u2014 that you cannot let it go at a price so absurdly low \u2014 that you cannot do without it. You buy something because the salesman is eloquent, because he has flattered your taste, because the late owner was a good fellow \u2014 not because you want it. Thus articles of household furni ture in Sydney become migratory, and are recognised as old acquaintances bought and sold twenty times over. I do not mean to hint that Sydney has not a fair share of permauent and well-rooted residents; but there do occasionally happen some almost meteor- like apparitions and disappearances among the most opulent circles \u2014 perfectly astounding to quiet people drawing a quarterly or monthly salary and living within it. An unusually grand ball or fete is, in such cases, a virulent symptom ; \u2014 the crisis is not far off! \u2014 the torch flares up \u2014 goes out ; and all the world, except those most concerned, are left in the dark \u2014 as to the cause. On the subject of street sales of miscellaneous wares \u2014 which I have said are not lucrative pursuits to the inex perienced frequenter \u2014 I have a little anecdote \" to submit to public notice,\" unique in its wTay, and \" a genuine article.\" A young military friend of mine, strolling one morning down George-street in desultory quest of amuse ment, stepped from mere curiosity into an auction-room where a sale was going on. Whether he did or did not nod his head at the salesman, is still doubtful ; but it is a fact that a lot, comprising \" 50 gross of bottles of mixed pickles,\" was knocked down to him ere he had"], [64, "60 OUR ANTIPODES. time to cross himself. Startling dilemma for a well dressed young gentleman, revelling in a salary of five shillings and threepence per day, drawing his pay from the paymaster and his pickles from the messman ! \"Some have greatness thrust on them,\" \u2014 but imagine six hun dred bottles of mixed pickles, to be paid for on de livery, being thrust upon a subaltern of a marching regiment ! Ninety-nine out of a hundred youngsters would have been taken aback, would have loudly denied the trans action, or made some other false movement betraying perturbation. Not so my cool-headed young friend. Treating the sale as a matter of course, and awaiting the close of the auction, he commissioned the auctioneer to \"put up\" his newly-acquired property in several small lots. The result proved that the military purchaser was not quite so green as the gerkins he was dealing in ; for he realized a handsome profit, and left the Mart, fol lowed by the admiration of the oldest auction loungers present. The night auction was common when I first arrived in New South Wales. I fancy this branch of the trade must have been since lopped off by legislative enactment, as I did not observe its occurrence later in my stay. It seemed specially intended for the disposal of articles \" that love the shade,\" and for the spoliation of the raw emigrant. The locale of the night auction was usually some small open stall. A ragged old pauper was seen and heard ringing a large bell opposite the door. A seedy, but sharp-looking salesman, leaning over a horse shoe counter, under the light of a huge but blear and"], [65, ".MEAT A PENNY A POUND. 61 smoky lamp, arrested the passengers by a display of his wares. The idlers gradually curdled into a crowd. Delusive eloquence and a dim light did the rest. But it is not only to public sales that newspaper notices direct the public attention, and stimulate the public in dolence. Merchants, traders, agents, shopkeepers of all grades promulgate their wants or their goods on hand through these channels. Master aud servant invite and proffer service by this means. At the head of a few of these entries, cut out of a file of journals before me, should be placed the following one.

There is no necessity for persons coining to New South Wales to cumber themselves with a huge amount of baggage. There are excellent and skilful tradesmen of every sort in Sydney : \u2014 coachmakers and tailors, who can build you a carriage or a coat that you may put yourself into with comfort and complacency ; boot makers, who will turn you out a pair of kangaroo skin Wellingtons, the softest of all leathers, that will do justice to your foot \u2014 all at Regent-street prices. If you are not particular, or in a hurry, or prefer putting on your clothes with a pitchfork, there are fifty ware houses where you may rig yourself, \" my lord, from top to toe,\" in two minutes, and \" at a very low figure.\" There is one thing that, as an old traveller, I never go without, namely, a London saddle, by a first-rate maker, (Wilkinson and Kidd are mine.) But as the assertion of this maxim in another colony brought down upon my shoulders the entire guild of the workers in pigskin, I say no more about it. The out-door games of old England are kept up here with greater observance than in any other colony of my acquaintance. I have seen some excellent and spirited play in the cricket matches between the clubs of Sydney and the vicinity ; and, when a little more attention shall be paid to round bowling and to costume, the game will be more effective, and the presence and encouragement of the fair sex will perhaps be secured. I rarely, or never, saw a lady at an Australian cricket match. It is amusing and pleasant to see the minor games of the minor people come round in their seasons.

You have the pleasing uncertainty whether your shying steed will get one or more of his legs within the iron circle, or whether all four will remain available for a fruitless gallop after the hop-o'-my-thumb offender.

It belongs, of a surety, to some civic notable or provincial grandee. In George-street or Pitt-street at three or four o'clock there are crowds of such carriages. Gay I have called them, and gay they are indeed, for the vehicles them selves are smart, and the fair ladies within them are often very smart ; but they\u2014 the carriages \u2014 are generally ill-appointed and ill-driven, a fact by no means sur prising, since many of the coachmen have tried every earthly trade before they took to the box. I myself possessed one whose previous calling had been that of a muffin baker. After he left my service I heard of him as a street watchman, a turnkey, and an office messenger. From the bread-cart to the brougham may indeed be legitimate promotion ; but that the shop-boy who has been accustomed to handle the ribands behind the counter should eo facto be capable of maintaining them with propriety and safety behind a footboard and a pair of blood bays ; or that the runaway carpenter's ap prentice should, ex ojicio, be eligible for the hammer cloth, are non sequilurs too apparent to need com ment. Fellows like these come out to this colony with the most vague and aimless ideas, whereof I shall have to give some illustrations under the head of Immigration.

On the subject of equipages, the public carriages \u2014 cabs, as they are called\u2014 are certainly the best in the world. Generally clarences, with a pair of well-fed active horses, they have nothing of the old English hackney coach about them ; and though some of the drivers are thorough-bred ruffians, they are kept in pretty good subjection by the regulations. Mrs. Meredith it is, I think, who lashes with her clever pen the habit of the ladies of Sydney to make the dusty streets their favourite drive or walk. The fact is as true as it is astonishing \u2014 for I know of no town in the universe where fresh air is more necessary for the inhabitants; and there -are few towns of co-ordinate consequence so bountifully supplied with breathing places close at hand. I have spoken of the Government domain, and its creation by convict labour under tasteful superintendence . The several entrances are close upon the towm and suburbs. There are nearlv four miles of drives through alternate open and wooded grounds, the greater part exposed to the sea-breeze, and opening upon cheerful views of the splendid harbour. There are shady paths, held sacred to foot-passengers, winding among the \" tea-scrub,\" or skirting the rocky shores. There is a spacious grassy plain, where a battalion may man\u0153uvre, aud where the band plays for the amusement of the public once or twice a week. There are the Botanic Gardens, divided into two compartments; one laid out in formal squares, containing the floral produce of many widely distant lands, flourishing together here as they flourish nowhere else; the other more in the English"], [75, "71 DRIVES AND RIDES. pleasure-ground style, embracing a wide circuit of the picturesque Farm Cove. There is a drive or ride of twelve or thirteen miles, to the lighthouse at the South Head and back, passing through such lovely scenery that, although enjoyed a thousand times, it never palled on my taste ; and for the admirer of the wild and dreary there is, for equestrian exercise, the wide expanse of hill and swamp between the city and Botany Bay. There are all these healthful outlets from Sydney dust and heat, and yet, with the exception of the attendance at the band, a score of persons can rarely be counted in any of the spots I have enumerated. I may except also the Gardens on a Sunday after noon, when the shopocracy \u2014 a wealthy and comfortable class \u2014 resort in considerable numbers to catch a puff \" of the briny,\" and take the creases out of their best suits. The Botanic Gardens at such times present a cheerful and pretty sight from any of the surround ing eminences, from a boat in the bay, or from the shipping. The scene is still more lively on the annual or half yearly Exhibition of the Australian Botanic and Horti cultural Society, when many thousands assemble to inspect the fruits, flowers, and vegetables, and other colonial products, arranged in marquees, and to listen to the music of the regimental and city bands, sitting or strolling under the shadow of the trees of many climes, and looking forth upon the calm glassy cove dotted with boats, the opposite ridge of the Inner Domain, crowned with the vice-regal palace, the frigates riding at anchor off the Point, the less trim merchantmen in \" the stream\""], [76, "72 OUR ANTIl'ODES. waiting for a wind, and the woody hills of the north shore in the back-ground. There is immense competition amongst some half dozen gentlemen and market-gardeners for the prizes given at this Exhibition. I can enjoy, but, having no science, cannot thoroughly appreciate rare plants. I felt more interest in the specimens of flax, silk, cotton, olive oil, wine, \u2014 all indigenous to the country, and only requiring time and experience to bring them to per fection. Some of the producers evince their fealty to their native land by exhibiting specimens of her weeds, or more properly field-flowers, strangers to the colony, and difficult to rear in the climate. I found myself adoring a buttercup, idolizing a daisy, and ardently coveting pos session of a glorious dandelion, which, classically labelled \"Leontodon taraxacum,\" occupied one of the high places of the E.xhibition, and was treated as an illus trious foreigner. For myself, I know no more pleasant lounge than the public gardens, sheltered as they are by the heights of Darlinghurst from the chill south winds of winter, and in summer shaded from the sun's rays by the trees. Of this latter quality \u2014 shade \u2014 however, not much can be said. A late traveller in these parts writes, indeed, \" Nothing can be more delicious, during the hot days of summer, than to seek the deep shade in the sylvan re cesses of these gardens.\" To find, it, would be still more delicious. There is, in truth, a great want of the more umbrageous and broad-leafed trees. All the family of the fig, so common here, are excellent in this"], [77, "BOTANIC GARDENS. 73 respect, and might be more largely introduced into the gardens. The view of so many vegetable natives of distant regions, within a small space, and all in the open air, is both pleasing and surprising. Plants from the Cape and China, Peru and Japan, Madagascar and North Britain, South America and the Canary Isles, Van Die men's Land, Hindostan, and New Zealand, are thriving within a stone's throw of each other. The oak and bamboo, the hawthorn and sugar-cane, the Scotch fir, plantain, and mango \u2014 the last, however, not looking happy \u2014 almost mingle branches. The Botanic Gardens, then, are I think a very useful establishment \u2014 a most creditable effort on the part of a young colony; yet (I note it as a disgraceful fact) in a rabid attack upon the estimates by the opposition mem bers of the Legislative Council in 1849, this pleasant place of public resort ran imminent risk of being per mitted to go to waste for want of the annual vote of money for its support. This was a small instance of radical ebullition and legislative wantonness, such as the intervention of a second Chamber will serve to control. The drive along the southern shore of the harbour to the Heads or entrance to Port Jackson, and thence back to Sydney by the \" old South Head Road,\" about thirteen miles, has hardly its equal anywhere for pic turesque beauty. The harbour itself rudely resembles, in its projections and indentations, the form of an oak leaf \u2014 or, to enlist a monstrous simile, it may be likened to the gaping mouth"], [78, "74 OUR ANTIPODES. of some huge antediluvian saurian, the bluffs and inlets representing the teeth and the interstices between them. The eyo, following the profile of the two opposite shores, cannot but perceive, that if the said enormous sandstone jaws were, by some geological miracle, to snap together again, so neat would be the fit that there would remain but little more than a serpentine line of \" scrunched \" rocks and gum-trees to mark where Port Jackson once was. The trifling islands in its midst would be, as the Yankees say, \" chawed up \" in a moment \u2014 \" Cockatoo,\" and \" Goat Island,\" \" Shark,\" \" Sow and Pigs,\" and even \"Pinch-gut,\" would be masticated and digested at one champ of the mighty mouster. The sins of Sydney, it is to be hoped, will not be visited by so disastrous a closing of her port. If it must happen, may it be when some overwhelming enemy's fleet is sailing up Port Jackson to bombard the city! The road to the Heads, after passing over the neck of the peninsula on which Darlinghurst is built, dives into a small valley, crossing the head of Rushcutter's Bay; then rising again, and again falling, it traverses a series of these promontories and coves, alike, yet full of variety \u2014 the hills well clothed with timber though sandy, the valleys rich in alluvial soil, and covered with wild brush or reeds \u2014 or, more usefully, with the crops of the market gardeners of the town. The views of the harbour from the higher points of the road, over the tufted tops of the forest sloping down to its extreme brink, and the glimpses of its glittering waters between the boles of the enormous gum-trees, are"], [79, "75 SOUTH HEAD ROAD. truly beautiful. So completely is this great port shut in from the ocean, that I know of no spot a mile within its gates from which the stranger would even surmise the position of its mouth \u2014 were it not for the tall bluff of the North Head, which lifts a hundred feet of its sheer wall-like profile above any of the interior headlands. I cannot describe botanically the trees, plants, and shrubs among which the eye of the rider wanders, well pleased, on either side of the road. The Eucalyptus, and other gums of infinite variety, form the larger growth of \" the bush.\" But there are trees, distantly resembling in aspect the European ash, the holly, larch, and myrtle, with a luxuriant undergrowth of ferns and lichens, and a multitude of flowering shrubs clad in spring and autumn with blossoms so lovely in form and hue as to justify the name of \" Botany,\" conferred by Dr. Solander as a title of honour on the neighbouring bay. There is the Correa, with stiff stem and prickly leaves, but with a string of delicate little pendulous flowers, red, orange, and white, something like the fuchsia, but, in my mind, a hundred times more brilliant. The native Rose, a Boronea, has the colour but no other resemblance to the European queen of flowers. It is one of the few bush-flowers possessing any odour. Wafted on the passing gale, it commends itself pleasantly to the senses ; but, strange enough, on closer acquaint ance there mingles with the rich perfume an undoubted scent of the fox! a scent which, however creative of rapture in \"the field,\" is ill adapted to the boudoir. The native rose is, I believe, nearly allied to the Diosma of the European greenhouse, to the scent of which some"], [80, "76 OUR ANTIPODES. noses have strong objection. A bouquet of bush-flowers is highly ornamental in the epergne of the dinner table, for they do not soon fade, and keep better out of water than in it j but he who would not implant a thorn in the bosom of beauty will never desire to see them worn in the ball-room, for, with scarcely an exception, they are harsh and thorny as the holly itself. The South Sea myrtle, or Leptospernum, grows in fine round bushes, spangled with white stars. Of the heath like Epacris there is an infinite variety, among which 1 name the Styphelia because it possesses the rare quality of a green flower. The Boronias shoot up their slender stems, among the roughest rocks and stubbornest plants, towards the sun, their wax-like petals showing every delicate shade between deep pink and snowy white. All these shrubs are evergreen. Amongst their branches and those of the higher trees the most beautiful creepers wreathe themselves. The Kennedya, with a purple vetch-like blossom, is among the most graceful. There is also a white variety, whose flower is so small, that a microscope is necessary to examine its minute beauties. I must not forget the Bottle-brush, one of the most characteristic plants of the bush. It has rough, twisted branches, and a leaf something like the holly. Sir Joseph Banks gave it its botanical name of Banksia, and his butler, perhaps, bestowed on it the vulgar appellation by which it is generally known. The upright, conical flowers with which this eccentric looking shrub is thickly covered resemble pretty closely that useful implement of the pantry. When at its prime, the deep orange hue of"], [81, "77 BUSH FLOWERS. the flower makes it almost handsome. In winter, the dry, brown hairy cones still sticking to the plant, look exactly like a troop of small monkeys squatting among the branches. In the swamps is a smaller and prettier kind of Banksia, of a softer fabric and with a flower of rich crimson. I used to fancy that my favourite charger loved to wear one of these brilliant natural rosettes in his headstall. There are several pretty iris-like bulbs in the moister soil ; and in the low lands of the Botany Scrub I noticed a crimson and orange flower, like the foxglove in form, very handsome, but so hard and horny in texture that the blossoms actually ring with a clear metallic sound as you shake them. It might be the fairies' dinner-bell, calling them to their dew and ambrosia ! Alas ! there are no \"good people\" in Australia; no one ever heard of a ghost, or a bogle, or a fetch here ! All is too abso lutely material to afford a niche for imagination or superstition ! Perhaps the greatest ornament of the bush, however, is the Acacia, of which there are many varieties. In autumn the trees. look as if a golden snow-storm had fallen on their branches, bending down with their burden of blossom towards the earth ; which is thickly strewn with the yellow bloom. Some of the acacias possess a delicious, almond-like perfume. The bark is extensively used for tanning. As the flowers of Australia are generally beautiful, but scentless, so are the birds for the most part as gorgeous in plumage as they are harsh in song. Indeed, they have no sustained melody, although occasional isolated"], [82, "78 OUR ANTIPODES. notes of great sweetness sometimes break the silence of the bush. After reaching the lighthouse and signal-post situated on the loftiest spot of the South Head, the line of road, \u2014 now called the old one, \u2014 returns to the city, across a tract of a wilder and more sterile character, its general direction being parallel to the coast of the Pacific, of which a wide prospect is enjoyed at various points. Since the establishment of toll-bars, about which every body of course grumbled for a time, the road is avail able for all classes of vehicles, \u2014 an advantage, as I have said, not half appreciated by the Sydney citizens. On Sundays, indeed, there is a general rush of horse men and chaise-men and women cowards the Heads, \u2014 the Christian part of the community, because it is their sabbath and holiday, the Hebrews, because they make it the latter. A well-known tavern near the lighthouse, however, seems to be the chief attraction ; and the wholesome salt breezes of the ocean are so modified with cigar smoke, that this weekly airing can but little profit the Sunday jaunter. If I have a hundred times taken the ride above de scribed without meeting a single soul of the 50,000 sweltering in the city and suburbs, I may say the same with regard to the ride to Botany Bay. There are two good hotels on the north shore of this basin, called after Sir J. Banks and Captain Cook ; and the point on which La Ptrouse's monument stands may be nine miles from Sydney. To the former there is a pretty good turnpike road, besides innumerable tracks for equestrians across the stunted scrub-land. To the latter there is nothing"], [83, "79 BOTANY BAY. that can be called a wheel-road, but a sandy galloping ground for horsemen soft as the riding-school tan. It must be the pure love of fresh air and exercise that tempts the rider in this direction. Barren, hopeless, un blessed tract; scrubby, rocky, sandy, and boggy by turns ; except in the short season of the bush flowers, one would suppose that it had been named \" Botany \" in bitter irony. Unlucky name ! retained, to the discredit of the whole colony, by reason of its associations in the popular mind ! I cannot but agree with Dr. Lang, that Banks land, or any other title, ought to have been substituted for its original one. The shores of this fine inlet are still as unpopulated as if it were a thousand miles from the city. Perhaps gentlemen selecting a place of resi dence may feel a squeamish dislike to have their letters addressed to Botany Bay ! By direct and legitimate inheritance \" Tyburn Terrace \" ought to have been the designation of the present Hyde Park Gardens in Lon don, yet it was not adopted by the architect, who was probably fastidious in nomenclature ! The sterile desert lying between the bay and Sydney contains, nevertheless, the greatest treasure \u2014 the life blood, it may be called, \u2014 of the metropolis. Without a fresh water river; built on a rock unfavourable to well-digging ; without tanks to catch the unfrequent rain, Sydney would die of thirst, and die unwashed, if it were not for the Lachlan Swamp. This is a huge sponge, lying in the midst of the sand desert, and discharging itself lazily into Botany Bay. A tunnel about two miles long has been cleverly con structed to convey the precious element to the town,"], [84, "80 OUR ANTIPODES. where it is placed for distribution in the hands of the Corporation, who are permitted to remunerate them selves by a rate upon householders, amounting, I think, to about \u00a32,000 a-year. At several periods, but particularly in 1849, a panic arose, and was stimulated by the public press, on the subject of the supply of water. The sponge was in dan ger, indeed showed strong symptoms, of being squeezed dry. In 1850, and not before, it occurred to the au thorities to fence in the swamp, in order to prevent the cattle from trampling out its valuable juice ; to dig conduits from the surrounding hills ; and to dam up its egress. Engineers were moreover consulted as to the practicability and expediency of constructing a canal from the Nepean river, thirty-five miles distant, \u2014 a plan which must some day be carried out. An Artesian well was commenced within the walls of the Darlinghurst gaol by the prisoners ; and in about three years the result \u2014 water or no water at the depth of as many hundred feet \u2014 will be reported to the poor thirsty foxes looking on round this long-necked vase. From some of the more elevated points of the coun try through which the South Head road is conducted, the views of the harbour are truly splendid. It was from one of them during an afternoon ride, \u2014 unpleasant but picturesque accident ! \u2014 that I saw town and country for the first time under the influence of a Brickfielder. There had been a morning of terrible heat ; the sky was free of clouds, yet not bright; a hot wind had raised the thermometer to 102\u00b0 in the shade. Towards the afternoon the wind fell, and a dull and sultry calm"], [85, "81 A BRICKFIELDER. came on ; and ordering my horse, I cantered towards the Heads, to meet a breath of air from the ocean, if breath might be had. Turning my eyes casually to wards the town, I was astonished to find that it had disappeared. It had been swallowed up in clouds and columns of red and white dust, which, rising madly on the winds and sweeping across the harbour, gradually veiled from my sight also the pretty suburb of St. Leonard's on the North Shore. Around my station \u2014 about five miles from Sydney \u2014 the trees and shrubs even to the minutest spray were motionless, and a little bay below me was unruffled as a mirror ; yet I distinctly heard the fierce roaring of the tempest as it rushed through the city and the country beyond it, lashing the upper portion of the harbour into white foam. The boats were flying for shelter in all directions, and one, with calm-weather canvass spread, heeled over, filled and vanished ! Soon the line of road from Sydney towards my post, hitherto hidden by the bordering bush, became visible in all its curvatures by thick coils of dust ; the tall still trees bowed their heads, and the expanse of bush before and below me seemed to put itself in motion and to rush towards the hill whereon I stood. Then a torrid gust, like the blast of a furnace, caught my face almost stopping my respiration ; and the dust which had ridden on the wings of the wind for so many miles came flying into my eyes and grated in my teeth. In a few moments there was once more a perfect calm. During the progress of the dust-storm a black bat talion of clouds had been rapidly collecting on the VOL. I.

Rolling and coiling about in confused masses, with mutterings of thunder and half-smothered flashes of lightning, their intention and direction were soon developed. Torrents of heavy rain and hail, accom panied by a chilling tornado that well-nigh cut me in two, came drifting horizontally over the face of the country, whilst an ebon mass of vapour right over head poured a perpendicular flood full upon my crown. The lightning became fearful in its vividness and apparent proximity ; the thunder, stunning in its magnificent diapason, reverberated from the bluffs around. Joining in the general uproar, the surf on the north shore flung itself madly up the steep cliffs to their very summits, seemed to stand suspended in the air for a space, and recoiled slowly and unwillingly to its wonted level. This was \" all very fine\" certainly, but so unsuited to a \" patent ventilating gossamer hat\" and a filmy paletot by Nicol, as to drive me at length to a temporary shelter. The thunder-storm, satiated with an incursion round every point of the compass, rolled away sullenly in the distance. Its rear-guard of light cumulus closed up to the main body, and disappeared at length in the north east, leaving only one heavy stationary mass \u2014 a sort of army of occupation \u2014 just above the setting sun, which, shooting its last rays from a bright stripe of sky over the distant Blue Mountains, and behind the long ridge where Sydney stands, showed the mere silhouette of a city \u2014 the council chamber, the infirmary, the staff offices, the spire of St. James', the barracks, and the gaol \u2014 in strong hard relief upon the rose-coloured haze."], [87, "83 HOT WINDS. The valleys across which I rode on my way home, and the deeper ravines, were already in darkness, while the slanting sunbeams still gilded the hill tops, the great white boles of the gum-trees, and the wet shining faces of the rocks. Such is a slight sketch of a Sydney hot-wind, and its constant follower the Brickfielder, or, as the Port Jackson boatmen call it, the Sutherly Buster ! No words can do justice to the degree of discomfort in flicted by the first upon the Sydney citizens during the season of its prevalence. Luckily the rush of wind from the colder regions, displacing the more rarified air of the preceding \" hot-wind,\" brings back a respirable atmo sphere to the gasping inhabitants, while the floods of rain carry away all accumulated impurities. On the occasion I have just recounted the thermometer fell at once from 102\u00b0 to 53\u00b0. When I started on my ride the lee side of an Indian tattee would have been luxury itself. Two hours later I was well pleased to \"take an air,\" as the Irish say, of the kitchen fire. Subsequently, however, I witnessed instances of a much greater variation of the glass. One morning, while the hot-winds were raging in Sydney, I walked to the Aus tralian Library, facing with some difficulty the scorching gale. Seating myself in the large room to read, I was soon seized with a chill shivering, and, looking at the thermometer within the apartment, was surprised to find it as high as 81\u00b0. The instrument outside the window in the shade stood however at 110\u00b0. Thus the sudden change of temperature from a superlative degree of heat to a merely positive one, gave me as decided a case of f2"], [88, "84 OUR ANTIPODES. catarrh as I ever got by a plunge from the hot-aired club-rooms of London to the frosty streets, or, vice versa, from the cold streets to the hot rooms \u2014 which experience tells me is the more perilous traject, \u2014 fatal, as I verily believe, every winter, to various aged and middle-aged members, who would have lived twenty years longer but for mossy carpets and flues\u2014 flues whose uniformly diffused warmth they daily enjoy in those bachelor palaces, but, which are seldom to be found in their private homes. In October 1848, as I find by my diary, I witnessed a fine instance of a nocturnal Brickfielder. Awakened by the roaring of the wind I arose and looked out. It was bright moonlight, or it would have been bright but for the clouds of dust which, impelled by a perfect hurricane, curled up from the earth, and absolutely muffled the fair face of the planet. Pulverised specimens of every kind and colour of soil within two miles of Sydney, flew past the house high over the chimney-tops in lurid whirlwinds, now white, now red. It had all the appearance of an American prairie fire \u2014 \" barring\" the fire. Had the \"wild huntsman\" and his skeleton field and pack galloped past along with this fierce commixture of earth and air, I should have taken the apparition as a matter of course ! It was really terrible to behold \u2014 diabolical \u2014 indescribable ; so I leave it to be imagined by those who saw aud felt the phenomenon. One of the greatest miseries of the Southerly Burster is, that (welcome to all animated nature as are its cool ing airs,) its first symptoms are the signal for a general rush of housemaids to shut hermetically every aperture"], [89, "DUST-STORMS. 85 of the dwelling. The thermometer in the drawing-room, and one's own melting mood, announce some 86\u00b0 of heat ; while the gale, driving so refreshingly past your windows, is probably 30\u00b0 lower ; but if you have any regard for sight and respiration, for carpets, chintzes, books, and other furniture, you must religiously shut up shop until the \" chartered libertine,\" having scavenged the streets of every particle of dust, has moderated its wrath. Even then, however well fitted may be the doors and windows, the volatile atoms will find their way every where, to the utter disturbance of household and per sonal comfort. Hot winds and sand-storms, sirocs and simoons, are common to many countries ; in the deserts of Africa they are, as we know, a deadly visitation. In New South Wales these storms sometimes cause the eye blight, or sand-blight, as the malady is indifferently called, than which, as I know from experience, nothing can well be more painful and irksome, involving actual loss of vision while inflammation is at its height \u2014 a loss sometimes, though rarely, as permanent as that caused by the Egyptian ophthalmia. One can hardly fancy a staff-officer carrying orders being foiled in his mission by a heavy fire of dust. The following instance is, however, a fact : \u2014 One day, having business at the barracks, I mounted my horse, and sallied forth right in the wind's eye. I do not easily give up a point ; but, at a certain turn in the road, so galling and incessant were the volleys of miniature brick bats, triturated blue-bottles, and gravel\u2014 for all the finer particles had been blown away long before \u2014 that my"], [90, "86 OUR ANTIPODES. charger, who never winked at a feu-de-joie, and who rested his nose upon the bass drum on his first acquaint ance with that tolerably strenuous instrument, posi tively refused to advance. Baffled by my rebellious steed, and riddled by the stony storm, after some resist ance, I was driven in confusion from the field. Considering the unrivalled suitability of Port Jack son for aquatic pursuits, the citizens of Sydney ap preciate pastimes on the water little more than they do the rides, and drives, and gardens. There is, how ever, connected with the shores, and islets, and coves of the harbour, one pursuit peculiarly congenial to the tastes of the people \u2014 a pastime half jaunting, half sedentary ; a little sea air, a very little personal exer tion, and a large amount of gastronomic recreation; I mean, oyster-eating. Every inch of rock from Sydney to the Heads is thickly colonized by these delicate shell fish ; that is, every inch would be so peopled, but for the active extermination incessantly going on. On any fine day select parties of pleasure-and-oyster seekers may be seen proceeding by water, or land, furnished with the necessary muniments for an attack, or actively engaged in it. A hammer and a chisel, an oyster-knife, a bottle of vinegar, and the pepper-pot, with a vigorous appetite, sharpened by the almost impregnable character of the foe \u2014 such are the forces brought into the field, and the inducements to distinc tion. It is needless to add, that the garrison are quickly shelled out of their natural stronghold. I enrolled myself more than once in an expedition of this kind, and only regretted that \"my great revenge"], [91, "87 OYSTER-PARTIES. had stomach\" for only one-half of the luscious victims demolished by my companions. The small rock-oyster of New South Wales is excellent in its way, although inferior to the Carlingford. The great mud-oyster of the rivers is too unctious for delicate appetites, although it is swallowed ore rotundo at the street-corners and stalls by those who prefer quantity to quality. Not much can be said in favour of the other fish of the colony. The guard-fish, which resembles a little sword-fish, and is somewhat smaller than the European herring, is delicate ; and the schnapper, when on the table, looms like the cod, but is a decided impostor, as far as flavour goes. There is an inland, tra montane, fresh-water cod, strange to say, worth all the sea-fish of the Australian coasts. I am afraid to state the weight that this species sometimes attains, but in naming 60 lbs. I am surely within the mark. There did exist, during part of my sojourn in Aus tralia, and long previously perhaps, an association of the aristocracy and bureaucracy of Sydney, whose members once or twice a month indulged in piscatory excursions down the harbour. It was generally believed that they went out with the intention and purpose of \" roughing it\" on the fruits of then skill. Furnished with an immense seine, or hauling-net, they put into any of the numerous sandy coves of Port Jackson favourable for the purpose of the expedition; aud having launched their net, and lighted a fire of drift-wood under some sheltering bank tufted with gum or fig-trees, nothing could have appeared to the eyes of a stranger more"], [92, "88 OUR ANTIPODES. miraculous than the repast which resulted from the experiment. The gentlemen did not over-fatigue them selves by personal exertion, for half-a-dozen boatmen, who looked wonderfully like convicts, hauled the seine, while one or two others, assisted perhaps by an amateur, busied themselves among pots and pans round the fire. Presto ! appear spread on the sward a boiled schnapper or broiled flathead, with oyster sauce. That was natural enough. It looked like practising Ichthyophagy in its purest sense \u2014 as it is practised, in short, at Blackwall or Greenwich in the whitebait season. But pigeon pies, turkey and tongues, ham and chicken, champagne and bottled ale \u2014 where did they come from ? It was quite plain that all was fish that came to the net of these famous fishermen. The sports of the day always afforded a subject of talk and laughter for the next forty-eight hours. It was pleasant while it lasted. Pity that an end, and a somewhat tragical end, suddenly came to it ! One fine evening, returning from a successful excursion, the Club found themselves becalmed far from land, in the beautiful little topsail schooner which sometimes carried them on these fishing trips. As the practice of personal mortification was discountenanced by the laws, or habits, of the society, the members quitted the vessel and gained the shore in a rowing boat, leaving her in charge of three hands. Whether or not these poor fellows got at the drinkables\u2014 supposing any remained \u2014 it is hard to determine ; but one of the southerly bursters above described swept suddenly down upon the smooth bay and the unprepared schooner,"], [93, "89 PIC-N1CS. and the little vessel went at once to the bottom, when all on board were lost. I know no spot in the world better formed for picnic parties than Port Jackson. When any of Her Majesty's ships happen to be in harbour, these excursions are tolerably frequent. The navy ought to feel flattered by the manner in which they are always received by the Sydneyites. The appearance of a man-of-war in the cove is the signal for all sorts of gaiety and hospitality. It is indeed pleasant to see the vigour which, fresh from the sea and exclu sively visile society, the members of our sister profession throw into their enjoyment of shore-going amusements. Their life and spirit infuse, as it were, salt and pepper into the insipid materials of a society rendered dull by monotony of life and absence of incident. No wonder their advent is hailed with rapture by the fair ! Having stumbled upon the word society, let me devote a few remarks to that of the New South Wales capital. It is too late to apologise for digressions in this work. My object is to produce a tolerably accurate general picture taken from nature.

That the society of Sydney is cut up into parties and cliques, the frontiers of which are not the less arbitrary because they are not very apparent, is a truism which applies quite as justly to any community without an hereditary aristocracy; I shall say no more therefore on that head. The remark is not more applicable to Sydney than to Liverpool, New York, Montreal, Cal cutta, and by this time, I dare say, to the capital of the Auckland Islands, whatever its name may be. There is one grand feature of the social status of Sydney, however, which is almost exclusively peculiar to itself \u2014 I mean the convict infusion. A person newly arrived here feels no little curiosity, perhaps some little uneasiness, on the subject of the degree of influence exerted on the social system by the numerous body of affluent emancipists, which the lapse of time and their own reformed characters have formed in the community.

If the spectacle of a wealthy ex-convict, rolling by in his handsome equipage, grate unpleasantly on the feelings of those who are blessed with competence, how galling must it be for the good man, suffering poverty and struggling for a precarious subsistence for himself and his family ! \u2014 and yet this is a thing of every day occurrence in Sydney. The indigent and honest man has literally to \" eat the dirt \" thrown from the chariot wheels of the branded felon. If the fortunes of all these persons had been made since the termination of their bondage, the contrast between their success and the penury of the more deserving would not, perhaps, appear so repugnant to poetical justice and the divine right of honesty. But the contrary is, almost without exception, the fact. The wealth of the majority of the \" Old Hands \" was accu mulated in different manners, but chiefly by monopolies during the period of their punishment \u2014 or rather of their"], [97, "\"OLD HANDS.\" 93 \"banishment, for of course it is only whilst in the com parative freedom afforded by the \" Ticket-of- Leave,\" or \" Assignment \" to private service \u2014 indulgences earned by good conduct under probation \u2014 that opportunities for acquiring property were open to them. No man, perhaps, can better appreciate the value of uprightness of character than he whose person has suf fered deeply by a lapse from it. It is possible that reformation may as often result from policy and ex pediency as from a heartfelt conviction of the sinful ness of sin ; but certain it is, that in many instances as much industry and probity have been exercised by persons who have been prisoners of the Crown, as by any order of men labouring for wealth in the colony. When such amendment becomes apparent, a charitable spirit is, as I have said, universally evinced towards the individual; and, whatever mortification he may occa sionally receive by chance shots, no intentional or deli berate reproach on the subject of \" old stories \" is ever aimed at him by his fellow- men. Indeed, the forbear ance practised on this point amounts even to delicacy. A convict, eo nomine, is seldom mentioned in New South Wales. He is \" a prisoner of the Crown,\" an \" old hand,\" a \" government man,\" or, he was \" sent out.\" This tenderness of expression, it will readily be believed, is practised not so much for the benefit of the actual offenders as for that of their innocent descendants, \u2014 sufferers for the sins of their fathers, moral bastards, whose position is certainly deserving of all consideration from those more happily born. \" In all mixed society,\" says Bulwer, \" certain topics are proscribed.\" It is"], [98, "94 OUR ANTIPODES. needless to particularize the forbidden topics of New South Wales general society. The great preponderance of \" conditional\" over \" free\" pardons tends to perpetuate the stigma : for although, sometimes, the conditions go no further than to prohibit return to the United Kingdom, others are more strin gent in their provisos ; and the opulent family, who in some distant community might hide their single blemish and display a hundred counterbalancing virtues, are constrained to remain iu the country where their disgrace is patent, until the brand wears out through the lapse of time. Among the many emancipated prisoners whose cir cumstances enable them to live on terms of financial equality with the more wealthy of the free classes, as well as among the store and shopkeepers of the same order, with whom I have come in contact, I must say that I have never witnessed any instance of prominently offensive conduct, except in the case of one notorious individual, who, alone among an ostracised class, seems to defy public opinion, and to push his vulgar assump tion of importance into public notice. I will assist him in his object by giving here a slight sketch of his biography. This very \"swell\" member of the swell mob was transported for robbing his Majesty's mail of a lar<*e sum of money ; but before his apprehension, he found means to transfer the cash to his wife. She followed him to Sydney under a feigned name. And here fol lows one of the most glaring instances of the abuse of the system of the \"assignment\" of convicts ever known."], [99, "95 FREED CONVICTS. He was assigned as a government servant to his faithful partner. It is not my object to follow the upward progress of the worthy couple ; but opulence they, and freedom he, at length obtained. I do not vouch for the fact, but I have heard, that since his manumission he visited England, drove a dashing four-in-hand \"drag\" in the parks, and contrived even to give personal offence to the most exalted personage of the realm in one of the royal demesnes. Of this I know nothing beyond report ; but I have often noted with disgust this man's shameless love of notoriety. Cock of the walk in gambling-houses, prize fights, publican's races, &c. &c, his ambition seemed to be to attract the attention and offend the prejudices of the higher and more respectable classes in public places, where of course he had freedom of entry. Robber, bully, and blackleg, he still continued to maintain an unabashed front \u2014 such is the power of money and impu dence. Yet this person is not a drunkard, dresses well, has a good house and handsome equipage ; moreover, he has brought up his children carefully and respectably, and has married them exceedingly well. The assignment of a husband to the service of his wife, placed them in a singular and awkward mutual relation. If he offended, she, by application to the nearest magistrate, could have him well flogged ; and, for a more serious act of insubordination, sent to work in chains on the roads. I have never had, never desired access to the records of the Convict Department ; but, for the lovers of New gate-Calendar marvels, there are to be found there, it is said, mines of rich materials, which might be worked"], [100, "96 OUR ANTIPODES. with great effect, \u2014 and with profit, \u2014 to the romancer, But such cases as the following, of convicts' attainment of wealth, and consequent power and station, are con stantly before one's eyes in Sydney. The first is a rich capitalist, and a landowner to the extent of a principality. He was a smuggler, a \" fence,\"* aided in the escape of French prisoners during the war; made some money in these pursuits, was \" transported beyond the seas.\" His money, follow ing him, quickly rolled up, as it always did in the good days of the colony. He is not respected, but he has a good head for business, and plenty of money, and commands therefore a place in a commercial com munity. Another case. \u2014 A Jew, professing a desire for conver sion to Christianity, gains access to the plate-chest, &c. of a proselytizing family. The plate is indeed quickly converted into cash. He desired no better than a trip to Australia. He is carried there at the expense of the taxpayers of England ; dies in the odour of sanctity ; and his next descendant attains high civic honours, becomes a justice of the peace, and no doubt well merits his success. One day, whilst riding with the Governor, I drew his attention to a carriage of peculiar form and colour, evidently au exact copy of one brought by his Excellency from England. His Excellency, although not easily moved, I thought coloured a little at finding that for the future he must be content to share the peculiarity of his equipage with emancipist Mr. .

There was a crest, coat of arms, &c. &c. ; and, for aught I know to the contrary, the worthy proprietor may have adopted, in profound ignorance of its import, the bar sinister of royal descent, borne on the shield of the ducal family, whose scion now rules the colony. The same armorial bearings, I understand, are blazoned on the wire window-blinds of this ambitious gentleman's residence. I am glad to add that he has the character of a good man and a charitable, and has given land and money for the building of a church. I was expressing to an old colonist one day my surprise that a notorious ex-convict, now however a tradesman in affluent circumstances, should often be accompanied in his carriage by a respectable looking gentleman, who I knew came a free man to the colony. \" He is the worse of the two, ten times over,\" replied my companion. \" The other was indeed a prisoner of the crown, but acquired bis property by steady industry.

They failed for a large sum ; gave thousands of pounds for houses and lands, while paying twopence-halfpenny in the pound to their creditors, and are both now more wealthy than j? ever. The career, from a state of pauper crime to wrealth and independence, of such an individual, is, in a few words, as follows : \u2014 He offends against his country's laws, is \" sent out,\" is assigned to service, gets his ticket-of-leave, finally his voi,. i. o"], [102, "98 OUR .ANTIPODES. conditional or free pardon ; or becomes free by servitude of his sentence. He takes a public house, dabbling meanwhile in various other money-making pursuits. He buys up cattle when the market is down, when their value might be reckoned by shillings, and sells them when ten or twelve pounds may be their price. He lends money on good security, and at usurious interest. He builds, buys, and sells houses. In the height of his prosperity, his house-rental alone brings him in 120/. a-Aveek ; for, liking quick returns, he counts his income hebdomadally. He purchases shares in a great banking establishment, well known, although not openly desig nated, as the Emancipists' Bank, a most safe and respectable house, (the writer banked there himself.) He possesses huge storehouses in the city, a beautiful villa in a fashionable suburb. \" Gorgeous is the only term I can apply to his furniture,' ' remarked to me one day a high functionary who had rented the house of an \" old hand \" for a period, but whom the wealthy owner had turned out at the close of the lease. He drives a splendid equipage, flashing with silver harness and new varnished panels, and a fast trotting pair of bays, with which he takes pleasure in passing and dusting the government officers and other less opulent respectables on their way to church. The above is no fanciful portrait. It is from nature. In one of my journeys in the interior of the colony, I inquired' of my companion the histoty of a beautiful place about half a mile from the road-side. The moment he told me the name of the proprietor, I recognised it as one inscribed a hundred times over in the charts of New"], [103, "EX-CON VICTR. 99 South Wales (and New Zealand, if I mistake not) as a possessor of allotments. Transported as a lad, he served apprentice to a bricklayer, who employed a number of other prisoners. The sober and penniless boy saved up his daily ration of rum, then a scarce article in the colony, and, selling it to the other prisoners, laid the foundation of a fortune which enabled him a few years subsequently to eclipse the richest merchants of Sydney. Yet, when possessed of wealth sufficient for every luxury, he never indulged in personal expenses. Living on \" damper,\"* beef, aud ration tea, in a brick-floored room, his highest luxury was getting drunk on East India rum at home, or at the neighbouring road-side tavern on colonial beer. He always, however, had an acute head and a vigilant eye for business ; and mercantile, pastoral, and agricultural affairs flourished under his management. Exactly opposite, across the public road, lies the property of a gentleman of high station and character, whose avocations compel him to reside in the capital. He must keep up a degree of style, and exercise a degree of hospitality, commensurate with his position. His distant estate is neglected or mismanaged. At present a tew horses and horned stock run wild and almost unreclaimed on the still uncleared land. The fences have fallen into disrepair ; the property is a loss rather than a gain to the owner. The \" old hand\" is making money, in short ; the old soldier spending it.

In 1849 or 1850, a friend of mine, desirous of re turning permanently to England, and of parting with his property in the colony, advertised it for sale in the public prints, \u2014 an excellent country squire's house and offices, with a beautiful farm around it, close to a large town. Considering the depreciation of landed property, many tolerably handsome offers were made ; but the highest bidder and eventual purchaser was a man who had been a convict, one of about a hundred prisoners employed by the father of the heiress of the estate. By steady be haviour this person became the overseer of the assigned men, gradually acquired money, freedom, and independ ence ; and, still in the vigour of life, purchases the house and property of his late master as a dower for his only daughter. However completely reformed, however respectable in life and character, he cannot be a very agreeable neighbour for the numerous branches of the clan * * * still resident in the country, amongst whom he has thus settled himself. I coidd enumerate not a few similar instances of convict prosperity. Some rose to wealth by honest industry; some by industry unfettered by probity, and others by downright roguery, defrauding their creditors by dint of the Insolvent Court, after having made over the bulk of their property to their wives or other trusty relatives. Those unfortunates whom they had cozened were com pelled, and still continue, to go a-foot, while successful and brazen-faced rascality \"rides in coaches.\" In men tioning the Insolvent Court, it is only fair to say that enriched convicts were by no means the only class of persons who fled to that city of refuge."], [105, "101 INSOLVENCY. Some eight or ten years back, intoxicated with previous success, (a success so unprecedented as to be in itself a warning to the wise,) the highest as well as the lowest of the colonists had launched forth into every species of extravagance and wild speculation ; a state of affairs which the convict system, with its cheap labour and enormous government expenditure, served to feed and. encourage. In the heyday of this success, the sudden demolition of the system and its material advantages, together with the fall in price of the staple exports of the colony, swooped with all the fierce violence of the monsoon upon the swelling sails of the thoughtless community. Some foundered at once, to rise no more : others, driven on a lee shore, fell into the hands of wreckers ; while a few, with damaged rigging, split canvas, and crazy hulls, managed to continue their voyage in sorry plight, but hoping for brighter skies' and fairer gales.

Practising with eminent skill as a physician for a longer period than any of the profession in the colony, he signalised himself by his benevolent attentions to the poor and sick. He was a distinguished member of the First Legislative Council of New South Wales \u2014 being indeed one of the elected members for the city of Sydney; aud, after the dissolution of this body, was a successful candidate for a seat in the second Council, convened in 1849 \u2014 only resigning this honourable post for private reasons \u2014 perhaps on account of his advanced age. Yet did not this talented and worthy gentleman wholly escape the bitter consequences of his former posi tion. During a debate on the proposed Endowment of a -Colonial University \u2014 so late as 1849 \u2014 certain gentlemen were nominated to compose a senate for the manage ment of the institution. Strong exception was taken by an hon. member against one of the gentlemen named, on the principle that a person who had been trans ported ought not to be eligible for such a post. What respect could the colonists expect from home if they could not elect twelve men free from the taint which had degraded it in the eyes of the world? \"It was not .against the individual but against the principle he pro tested,\" And he wound up his speech by raising \" his warning voice against an University Bill which would exclude clergymen and admit convicts.\" It is necessary to note here that the mover of the Bill introduced the startling clause that clergymen of all"], [110, "106 OUR ANTIPODES. denominations ought to be excluded from the manage ment of the institution. Not only the manager and trustees were to be laymen, but all the teachers should be laymen. Secular education only was wanted, no sectarian influence could be permitted ! A learned member, replying to the first speaker, would not consent to exclude the gentleman alluded to on the ground that he belonged to a class to which infamy attached. He urged that Dr. had sat in the first Legislative Council, and had associated with the highest grades of society ; that he had .been placed in the position he had formerly occupied, because, being an officer in the navy at a time when it was impossible to avoid giving what was termed gentlemanly satis faction when it was demanded, he had had the misfor tune to kill his antagonist in a duel. The spirit of the times had changed, but formerly some of the most dis tinguished men had exposed themselves to the risk of similar punishment. He instanced the Duke of Wel lington, and Lord Winchelsea, Lord Cardigan, and the duel between the Duke of York and the Duke of Ri hmond. It was well known that among the pro fessors of Cambridge was one who had been unfortunate enough to kill an opponent in a duel. The worthy doctor thus unmistakeably pointed at, though not named, finding the cap to fit, put it on. He published an insulting letter to his opponent.

The Chief Justice said that he was of opinion that Dr. had no just cause of complaint. The debate in the Council had turned upon a question of vital im portance to the colony and to the proposed University, viz. whether persons who had been transported to the colony were eligible to be on the senate. Dr. 's name was not mentioned. It was to be regretted, how ever, that the word convict was used in the last sentence of Mr. L 's speech. His Honour added that from the bench he could only recognise Dr. , for the purpose of debate, as one of those who came to the colony as a convict. Off the bench he had the highest esteem for him, and for his veiy good qualities. His subsequent career in the colony entitled him to perfect oblivion and forgiveness of the past. The judges ultimately \" discharged the rule,\" which, I suppose, means that the case was dismissed without costs. The merits of the case between the two litigants seemed to rest on the question whether public principle or private pique prompted the objection. At the period of colonial history when the eman cipist class, patronised and drawn from social obscurity by the governor of the day, had attained the highest point of prosperity; when the eminent and opulent firms of Lagg, Scragg, Hempson & Co., and other houses and individuals, possessed branch businesses in London, Liverpool, and in the neighbouring colonies, and owned at least one half of the monied and landed"], [112, "108 OUR ANTIPODES. property in the colony\u2014 it is a ludicrous fact that an ingenious individual, in quest of an opening for employ ment, hit upon the bright idea of establishing an \" office of armorial research.\" He had no difficulty in finding namesakes for most of his Botany Bay constituents among the nobility and landed gentry of England, and of adapting to them suitable coats of arms, heraldic emblems and mottoes. I happen to know that on one occasion this colonial garter-king-at-arms having allotted to an ex-convict customer the following imposing motto : \u2014 \" Ictus non victus \" \u2014 \" Stricken not van* quished;\" \u2014 and having with some complacency submitted it for approval to a gentleman of his acquaintance, the latter, with all due deference \"to the accomplished herald, proposed this trifling amendment \u2014 \"Ictus ter con victus \"\u2014\" Whipped at the cart's-tail, and thrice con victed ! \" One Sunday, in passing through a country town of this colony, and taking my seat amongst others in one of the ordinary pews in the aisle of the parish church, I noticed a large dais-like' pew, crimson-curtained and brass rodded, on one side of the altar, with a costly marble tablet attached to the wall. In England it would have been the ancestral seat of the squire and lord of the manor. The person to which this pew belonged occupied precisely this station with regard to the colonial town.

They are every-day instances continually under the notice of the Sydney public, not now dragged from obscurity in order to adorn a tale. Whether they are calculated to \" point . a moral \" depends much on the way ill which they are taken. On the one hand, the spectacle of wealthy crime constantly before the eyes of a young community, in which a modest competence is all that the hard-working and honest man may hope for, cannot but be hurtful as a subject of contemplation, comment, and comparison by the inexperienced and unreflecting. Is it not calculated to make a weak and rash mind doubt the justice not only of fallible man, but of infallible Omniscience? On the other hand it may be argued that an offence is fairly expiated by a commensurate punishment, aiid that the prosperity of the penitent offender should not only be a subject of rejoicing, but afford a profitable and salutary example. But there are other questions. Are the great ends\u2014 the prevention of crime, and the punishment and re formation of criminals \u2014 really attained by the secondary punishment called Transportation ? And are the present advantages enjoyed by some whose past career was stained with recorded wickedness, calculated to inspire the terror that a preventive punishment ought to inspire, or to deter those wavering in their principles, or having none, from following the same courses? True, the hardened reprobate, the twice or thrice-convicted felon, whom severity and indulgence have alike failed to reclaim, will pass his life in little better than slavery, \u2014 the chain, the scourge, and compulsory labour his daily fate. But if the most desperate and depraved ruffian"], [114, "110 OUR ANTIPODES. have but the strength and resolution to feign and main tain an orderly, willing, and respectful demeanour, a few years will obtain for him some of the indulgences incident to the system, \u2014 his pass to work for hire in the town ; his ticket-of-leave, enabling him to compete with the honest labourer in any part of a given district ; his conditional pardon, permitting him to go anywhere but to the United Kingdom, or the place from whence he was originally transported ; and even his free pardon, by which he is completely reinstated in liberty. And who shall be able to judge, whether this amendment of conduct has arisen from the promptings of conscience and real moral amelioration, or merely from a keen appreciation of personal ease and material improvement? When the latter is the case, it is a pity that the false hypocrite and the true penitent should be \" whitewashed\" together.* Still more to be lamented is it, that the virtuous opera tive of the Old Country is too often ill-fed, ill-lodged, ill-clothed, and at his wits' end to save himself and family from the workhouse ; while his fellow-villager, who has been transported for repeated offences, finds himself, after a short probation, allowed to work for his own livelihood, in a cheap country, with a splendid climate, and at a rate of wages unheard of in England. * The following is a strong instance of an incurable : \u2014 J.

He broke into a house, was caught, and convicted ; and, in shot's, here he is still."], [115, "COCKATOO ISLAND. 111 The system of transportation will always find plenty of advocates at home ; for a public that pays grudgingly and grumblingly for the necessities of its indigent members, will pay willingly enough for the ridding its ranks of rogues. Society is less actively harassed by pauperism than by rascality ! Very many transported persons have thoroughly re formed. Very many were never radically vicious, but owed their fall to bad example and bad counsel. The wheel of fortune (that of Brixton, perhaps !) may have played them an ugly turn or two in the youth of some ; but they have seen their errors, felt the consequences of them, and learnt, moreover, the value of character and conduct. But the blemish is irradicable. Like a broken kneed horse, they may continue to work, and work as well as their more spotless fellow-men ; but they never meet again with that implicit trust which those who have never \" been down\" have a right to expect. Society, however, must be protected from too close contact with the once-tainted. She protects herself, accordingly, as I have mentioned heretofore; and the social economy of this colony is in general sufficiently secured from what is called the convict influence. So little is what may be styled active convictism now apparent in Sydney, that a stranger might be unaware that any remains of the system still exist. The prisoners under custody and punishment are all confined to Cockatoo Island. This natural hulk is situated about two miles above Sydney, just where Port Jackson narrows into the creek called the Paramatta River, and about a quarter of a mile from either shore. Here is"], [116, "112 OUR ANTIPODES. all that remains of that stupendous machinery which from first to last has introduced into and diffused through these colonies not less than 60,000* of Great Britain's offenders, and by whose agency it may be said this great fifth portion of the globe has been redeemed from the savage, and appropriated to the European family. The isle is a triangle in form, about 400 yards lohg by 280 in width. It contains at present about 300 prisoners under conviction for offences committed in the colony, or expirees from Norfolk Island. Many of these are regular incurables, doubly and trebly convicted. Cockatoo, -like the last-named island, may be considered as a college for rogues, of which New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land are merely preparatory schools. The members must have matriculated, graduated, and become professors, in order to be entered on the books. A \"little go\" in vice will scarcely entitle to residence! The prisoners are employed in quarrying stone, in laying down a clear and spacious wharf round this rugged isle, so that a few sentries can command the entire circumference. They are moreover engaged on the useful work of excavating a dry dock \u2014 a convenience which does not at present exist in these colonies. The establishment is admirably adapted both by nature and art to its purpose. Yet more than one desperate attempt at escape were made in my time. * Mr. A. Dumas, clerk in the Convict Department, Sydney, states, that of these 60,000 prisoners, \" 38,000 are now filling respectable positions in life, and earning their livelihood in the most creditable manner. .....

About a dozen and a half of these siloes, filled in times of plenty with grain, were intended as a reserve of food for seasons of famine, which have more than once befallen the colony.

But ere I engage my reader to accompany me on my first inland tour, I would beg permission to do for him what I did for myself on the passage out, and subsequently ; namely, to look up from the autho rities nearest at hand a few of the leading facts attendant on the history of New South Wales. It is needless to say that he is at liberty to shirk this chapter if he pleases, and to jump again into the current of the narrative. To begin at the very beginning, \u2014 it is perhaps not generally known that the great island continent of New Holland, so lately occupied by the Anglo-Saxon family, is senior in existence to Europe itself. The absence of certain strata in its geological formation is sufficient"], [119, "115 DISCOVERY. proof to the learned that the sun rose and set on Australia whilst \" Old'' England remained yet sub merged beneath the waves she now rules. This subject is so immeasurably beyond my reach, that, in the spirit of the Fox in the fable, pronouncing it \" dry,\" I jump at once out of the scrape, to the year 1609, when the Spaniard, De Quiros, is supposed to have been the first white visitor of the Great South Land. One Dirk Hartog, (the ancestor, no doubt, of Sir Walter Scott's hero,) of Amsterdam, was the second. In 1644, the Dutch navigator, Abel Tasman, explored its coast, and bestowed upon it, very naturally and patriotically, the name of Niew Hollands. In 1777, the Welshman, Cook, in planting the British standard on its shores, with equal propriety styled it New South Wales. Both titles are retained ; the former being the generic appellation of the entire island, the latter that of the first colony implanted on its coasts. Australia is a more sonorous alias by which this great southern slice of the globe has become also known ; and the term Austra lasia has been given (as some one remarks, \" with doubtful propriety\") to all the comparatively lately dis covered lands in the South Pacific Ocean, New Holland, New Zealand, &c. &c. The British colonies in New Holland may be said to owe their origin to the United States of America; for, on the severance of these last from the Mother Country, she was compelled to look out for some other corner in which to put her naughty boys \u2014 some other place for her h 2"], [120, "116 OUR ANTIPODES. deported criminals. Botany Bay, so lauded by Dr. Solander, Cook's companion, was fixed on. \" The main objects,\" writes Dr. Lang, \" of the British Government in the formation of the proposed settle ment, were, 1st. To rid the Mother country of the intolerable nuisance arising from the daily increasing accumulation of criminals in her jails and houses of correction ; \u2014 2d. To afford a suitable place for the safe custody and the punishment of these criminals, as well as for their ultimate progressive reformation ; \u2014 and, 3d. To form a British colony out of those materials which the reformation of the criminals might gradually supply to the Government, in addition to the families of free emigrants who might from time to time be induced to settle in the newly-discovered territory.\" In March 1787, accordingly, the \"first fleet,\" eleven vessels, under command of Captain Phillip, R.N. of H. M. ship Sirius, with 565 males, and 192 females, and a guard of marines \u2014 in all, 1,030 souls on board \u2014 sailed from England. After eight months' passage, they reached in safety Botany Bay. This spot was found sandy, swampy, and ill watered; the harbour shallow and exposed; the natives hostile. Phillip, searching further northwards, entered an inlet about ten miles from Botany Bay, laid down in the chart of Cook's expe dition as a \" boat-harbour,\" under the name of Port Jackson, from the sailor who discovered its entrance. The great circumnavigator thus slightingly notices this splendid estuary :\u2014 \" At daybreak, on Sunday, the (5th May, 1770, we set sail from Botany Bay, with a light"], [121, "THE \" FIRST FLEET.\" 117 breeze, &c. &c, and at noon our observation was 30\" 50' S. At this time we were between two and three miles distant from the land, and abreast of a bay, or harbour, in which there appeared to be a good anchor age, and which I called Port Jackson.\" Astonished and overjoyed at the view of the mag nificent haven, which had been veiled from the sea by the outer headlands, Phillip hastened to remove the fleet from Botany Bay, and on the 26th January, 1788, it was anchored in Sydney Cove. On that day the epoch of transportation to New South Wales commenced ; it terminated on the 20th August, 1840. This punish ment is now confined to Van Diemen's Land, and its dependency, Norfolk Island. Cockatoo Island receives the incorrigibles of New South Wales. In May that year the entire live-stock of the colony, public and private, was found to consist of 2 bulls, 5 cows, 1 horse, 3 mares, 3 colts, 29 sheep, 19 goats, 74 pigs, 5 rabbits, 18 turkeys, 29 geese, 35 ducks, and 210 fowls. In the following month, two bulls and four cows were lost in the bush \u2014 a great apparent disaster, eventuating in most fortunate results ; for these animals, led by instinct, took their course inland, traversing the sterile and sandy tracts round Sydney, and finally choos ing their pasture about forty miles from the settlement, on the banks of the Hakwsbury. Here they quickly multiplied, owing their safety from the natives to the novelty of their appearance, fierce looks, sharp horns, and formidable voices. Seven years afterwards, Gover nor Hunter, having heard of the wild cattle on this spot, crossed the Nepean river, and discovered a herd"], [122, "118 OUR ANTIPODES. of forty head feeding in a well-grassed and watered country ; so savage were they, that it was with difficulty that one or two of them were shot. The troubles of the first governor were very great. The stores failed; the soil produced but little food. More prisoners arrived. He sent the Sirius with a party of troops and convicts to take possession of Nor folk Island ; the ship was wrecked, and the provisions on board lost. The people lived on the mutton-bird, or sooty petrel, which swarmed on the island, until grain grew up. The convicts at Sydney became muti nous ; many escaped. A party of twenty of them started for China, by land, in 1781, and the few who survived were brought back half starved to the set tlement. The blacks were troublesome. His Excellency him self was dangerously wounded by one of them. Food had to be sent for from Batavia and the Cape of Good Hope. Botany Bay and Port Jackson fortunately afforded great quantities of fish, which were caught and served out as rations. Agriculture was gradually esta blished. Land was granted to a few free settlers, as well as to emancipated prisoners. Many of the marines, also, became colonists. The first settlers were located on the Paramatta river, and under the Prospect Hills, about twenty miles from Sydney. They were furnished with clothes and rations from the public stores for eighteen months, tools, implements of husbandry, seed grain, live-stock, and, eventually, the services of such number of prisoners as they could engage to feed and clothe."], [123, "INFANCY OF THE COLONY. 119 Thus originated the assignment system, the best ever invented, had it been properly administered ; but being, like most other systems, open to abuse, abuse walked in as a matter of course. It relieved the treasury from the expense of maintenance, separated the convicts, and associated the better conducted of them with respectable families. To the colonists themselves this supply of labour, when no other was to be obtained, was an ines timable boon. When the boon was extended to eman cipated and expiree prisoners, or to other worthless characters, the boon became an abuse. Old chronological tables, as well as histories, testify that the birth and infancy of the colony were attended by natural prodigies, terrestrial and meteorological, such as might have been received as omens of failure, if not as warnings from on High, against the rise of a nation bearing on its scutcheon the fetter and the scourge \u2014 sad emblems for a nascent people. These phenomena providentially have not attended the maturer age of the colony. In the first year a severe shock of an earth quake was felt, with sulphureous exhalations from the ground. Others occurred in 1S01 and 1806. Tremen dous hail-storms, or rather showers of ice-flakes six and eight inches in circumference, destroyed young stock, poultry, and crops. Furious hurricanes and an influx of the sea occurred at Norfolk Island. There were fearful and repeated floods of the Hawkes bury river, the most memorable of which, in 1806 and 1808, caused terrible devastation, and drove the settle ment to absolute starvation. In the former case the"], [124, "120 OUR ANTIPODES. river rose seventy feet above its ordinary level. Wheat went up to seventy and eighty shillings the bushel, and bread to five shillings the loaf. The barracks were struck by lightning. The clock-tower crumbled down into ruins. Cattle and even men were killed in the storms. Yet destructive to the rapid progress of the new colony as were these natural causes, there was another yet more disastrous \u2014 namely rum ! In the absence of coin, rum became the chief article of exchange. Govern ment officers, settlers, military men, emancipists and convicts, all dabbled in the dirty but lucrative traffic \u2014 and rum became a legal tender and the great circulating medium. Licences to retail spirits were given to members of what might, at that time, have been styled the aristo cracy of the society. Whilst the gentlemen so in dulged were going about their official avocations, their assigned convict-servant \u2014 sometimes female con vict and concubine \u2014 managed the shop and the till. Such was the paucity of women of good repute, and such the consequent general depravity, that in 1800 two-thirds of the children annually born were illegi timate. The miserable spirit of huckstering, well styled by one of the early Governors, a \" low and unmilitary occupation,\" brought about one of the most extraor dinary instances of military usurpation extant in the history of the British army. There is no colony in the world, perhaps, where"], [125, "121 A MILITARY REVOLT. British troops have been so thoroughly without oppor tunities of distinction as in New South Wales. Beyond a skirmish or two with banditti, and a scuffle with the blacks under martial law of a few days' duration, I am not aware that they have ever been called out upon any active service which Major Sturgeon would have con sidered harassing. (In this remark I exclude of course the New Zealand war.) It is unfortunate, therefore, that after vainly hunting back for records of high cmprize on the part of the troops in this dependency, one stumbles upon the deposition of the Governor by the officers and men of the New South Wales corps\u2014 afterwards embodied as the 102d Regiment. The officers having for some years engaged in the rum trade above mentioned, and dealing largely also in other wares obtained by them from the King's stores or from merchant vessels at prime cost, and retailed at immense profit, (for they were privileged to have the first sight of the manifests and cargoes of all vessels arriving,) became naturally irate when this monopoly was threatened. Captain Bligh, the famous commander of the Bounty, on assuming the Government, resolved to break up this monstrous system. His first blows were struck, right and left, against civil and military in the persons of a resident merchant and a captain of the New South Wales corps, to whom spirit stills had been consigned by their London agents, and which had arrived in a late vessel. The former gentleman was summoned \" to show cause\" for such a breach of harbour regulations ; evaded"], [126, "122 OUR ANTIPODES. the summons ; was apprehended ; brought to trial before a criminal court, consisting of the Judge-Advocate (a civil officer) and six officers of the corps ; protested against the former officiating as president, on the plea of his being prejudiced in the case and inimical to himself; and was supported iu his objection by some of the members who joined him in a request that the Governor would appoint another judge \u2014 a substitution which His Excellency had no power to make. The Judge-Advocate, attempting to assert his authority, was resisted by the court. The Governor then sum moned the six officers to appear before him and a bench of magistrates, to answer a charge of treason able aud rebellious practices preferred against them by the Judge-Advocate. The Junior Major and pro-tem. Commandant was at this juncture confined to his house in the country by illness, on which plea he excused himself from waiting on and consulting with the much-troubled Governor on the question between him and the malcontent officers. The next day, however, the Major came into Sydney and repaired to the barracks, when the officers and other persons persuaded him to place the Governor in arrest, and to assume himself the government of the Colony. They first liberated Mr. M , the restive merchant, from His [Majesty's gaol, where he had been placed by the despotic judge, and authorized him to draw up a requisition to Major J to assume the chief power. Six gentlemen signed this requisition. (I am personally acquainted with the immediate descendants of five of"], [127, "123 THE GOVERNOR REINSTATED. them, as well as those of the Charles the First and Cromwell of this stormy passage of colonial history.) This violent measure was carried instantly into effect. The regiment paraded at seven o'clock the same even ing, the twentieth anniversary of the colony, and was marched at a quick pace with fixed bayonets, band playing, and colours flying, to the Government House. The subaltern in command of the Governor's guard loaded and joined the corps with his men, and was pushing into the entrance-hall, when his advance was gallantly resisted by the fair daughter of His Excellency, then a young and pretty widow. The parasol which, \" legends say,\" was on this occasion bravely wielded in defence of a father, proved but a poorer., sol-dat! for the men rushing past the lady into the Governor's apartment, captured him in the act of destroying some important papers. The Commandant was installed as Governor. The real Governor was confined in the barracks, but was afterwards permitted to take command of H.M. ship Porpoise \u2014 then in harbour\u2014 in order to return to England. In December 1809, Colonel Macquarie arrived at Sydney, with instructions to vindicate the laws by re instating for twenty-four hours Governor Bligh, and then to be sworn in as his successor. The deposition of Governor Bligh was designated by the Secretary of State as a \" mutinous outrage.\" The Major (who had meanwhile been promoted to a Lieut.-Colouelcy) was ordered home under arrest, was tried by a general court-martial in May 1811, and was cashiered \u2014 his Royal Highness the Commander-in-Chief confirming the"], [128, "124 OUR ANTIPODES. sentence, while he characterised it as \" inadequate to the enormity of the crime.\" The New South Wales corps was immediately re lieved by H.M.'s 73d Regiment, whose gallant colonel, with great poetical justice, espoused the fair aud spirited daughter of the ill-treated Governor. Mr. J , late Lieut.-Colonel, returned to the colony, where he died much regretted, leaving considerable property. This singular event in the annals of the colony is minutely detailed in Lang's History of New South Wales. However the colonists themselves and their corps might indulge in insurrectionary pastimes, they proved loyal and conservative enough when the convicts at tempted rebellion ; for the New South Wales corps were the terror of insurgent prisoners and bushrangers ; and I find that in 1807 the \" Sydney Loyal Association,\" 600 strong, enrolled themselves for the defence of the country and the government.

The honour of originating the Australian wool trade, now so famous, is due to Mr. John Macarthur, who, going to England about 1803, \"displayed the samples of wool grown by himself in New South Wales to some brokers, who, foreseeing the advantage that would accrue to Great Britain if by its extensive cultivation the Aus tralian fleece could be made to compete with the Spanish and Saxon article, interested themselves to obtain for Mr. Macarthur the special favour of the Home Government. In consequence, when Mr. M. returned, as he shortly did, he received a large grant of land suitable to his adventure, and a number of assigned servants sufficient for his purpose.

He gave to pardoned and expiree prisoners places of trust, and the entree of Government House. He discountenanced free emigration. His successor, on the contrary, kept the emancipists at a distance and encouraged immigration. A fierce jea lousy grew up between the parties, bond and free. It became the business of a third Governor to allay these hostile feelings, and he succeeded as far as human nature would permit.

The upset auction price of land was by Lord Ripon in 1831 fixed at 5s. an acre. In 1838 bv Lord Glenelg it was raised to 12s. ; and by Lord Stanley in 1842 to 1/. \u2014 at which price it now rests.

About the same date as the establishment of the sale of Crown lands, arose that of issuing depasturing licences, in order to prevent the unauthorized occupation of Crown lands by squatters and others. The fees raised by this impost were devoted to police and other public purposes in the pastoral districts, or, as Sir George Gipps styles them, lands beyond the shireland of New South Wales. Various successive emigration schemes were concocted, tried, and annulled.

The average annual emigration from the United King dom to other countries for the last twenty-three years, has been computed at 75,000 souls.

In 1840, New South Wales ceased to be \"a place to which convicts might be transported from the United Kingdom.\" In March 1843, the Right Rev. Dr. Polding, Roman Catholic Bishop, assumed the title of \" Arch bishop of Sydney\" \u2014 a title conferred immediately by the Pope ; and issued a pastoral letter in the name of \" John Bede, by the grace of God, md of the holy Apostolic See, Archbishop of Sydney, and Vicar- Apostolic of New Holland.\" In the same month, the Right Rev.

Thus the \" papal aggression \" of 1850, whereof we in Australia heard so much in 1851, had commenced at Sydney seven years before.

His Excellency Sir Charles Fitzroy, in his first address to the legislative council in 1846, informed that body, that he had come to the colony unbiassed by precon ceived opinions, and that to enable him to judge for himself on some of the main questions then in agitation, he should take an early occasion of visiting in person the inland counties, as well as some of the districts beyond the boundaries of location \u2014 commonly called the Squatting Districts.

I particularly notice this latter appliance, and recommend it for adoption by all travellers in a rough and thinly peopled country. This vehicle, with four horses, was driven by his Excellency, who is an accomplished whip. The Colonial Secretary and myself occupied a light open carriage and pair, each contributing a horse ; and my English valet attended us. We had a huge gig umbrella, which could be \"stepped\" like a boat's mast, to save us as much as might be from wet jackets and scorched faces. There was nothing remarkable in our outfit, except a large rattan basket, covered with oilcloth, which was hooked on behind, and held a multitude of requisites not easily stowed in a small vehicle. A dog cart followed, carrying two servants. The road between Sydney and Paramatta is so well known that I shall say nothing of it on this occasion, beyond noting the singular fact, that the annual lease of the Annandale turnpike, the first on the road out of Sydney, was sold by auction in 1848, for 3,005/. \u2014 about half the yearly proceeds of Waterloo Bridge, where foot passengers also pay. A very dusty drive of fifteen miles brought us to the town of Paramatta, whereof more anon ; where, crossing the river by a handsome stone bridge, and descending its left bank about two miles, we came to Vineyard, the residence of Mr. Hannibal Macarthur, at which place we were to remain two nights. The house is large, and better constructed for a hot climate than the majority of"], [139, "\" VINEYARD.\" 135 the Sydney dwellings. It is prettily situated on a bend of the river, with a spacious lawn \u2014 not green, but brown, at this season \u2014 in front, beautiful gardens, orangeries, and vineyards, all bounded by the dense forest, or bush. Here our party was most hospitably treated. What with driving, riding, boating, and bathing in the morning ; feasting, singing, and dancing in the evening, the rosy and somewhat sultry hours flew as fast as they conveniently could, the range of the thermometer, between 80\u00b0 and 90\u00b0, being taken into consideration. The proprietor of Vineyard is a member of the Legis lative Council, and a large land and stock owner. He is, moreover, the father of a numerous family, who may well be cited as most favourable specimens of the \" Currency\" race. At a later period of my stay in the colony, Mr. Macarthur went to reside in the interior, and this pretty and cheerful place, falling into the hands of the Roman Catholic hierarchy, was converted into a convent, \u2014 in worldly and my eyes, a most melancholy change. November 10//.. \u2014 Passed the day in lionizing Para matta. It is a considerable village, or rather town, well laid out, but low, and in summer extremely hot, being entirely surrounded by land considerably higher than its site, which screens it from the sea-breeze \u2014 the life-blood of the Sydneyites, and other dwellers near the coast. The town is conveniently placed at the head of the navigation of the salt creek miscalled the Paramatta River, which is, indeed, nothing more than an inlet of Port"], [140, "136 OUR ANTIPODES. Jackson. A small freshwater-stream, not always fluent, is thrown back by a dam just above the town, and is thus saved from pollution by the sea-water, which at high-tide washes the lower slope of that barrier. It is not easy to find anywhere prettier cottages than many of those dropped down in their trim little gardens in this earliest \u2014 one can hardly use the term, most ancient \u2014 of Australian country towns. At this season there is a profusion of flowers in full bloom, not yet burnt up by the sun of the fast-coming summer. The verandahs and porches are perfectly embowered with creeping-plants \u2014 vines, woodbines, bignonias, passion flowers, &c. The verandah of one of the inns is com pletely curtained by a magnificent glycine, covered with its pale purple clusters. Immense standard orange trees and figs grow in some of the enclosures ; and there are some tolerably good specimens of the English oak, \u25a0which, however, does not take kindly to the climate and soil of this country. In the towns of New South Wales, the first object upon which the stranger's eye falls, is some grand building devoted to the custody and coercion of convicts; \u2014 in civiler terms, to the accommodation of its original white population ; or to their protection, when age or disease, mental and bodily, may have overtaken them, \u2014 gaols, in short, hospitals, lunatic asylums, and the like. At Paramatta, the most prominent of these establish ments \u2014 a handsome solid stone edifice, a \" stone-jug\" well calculated to contain the most ardent and effervescent spirits \u2014 is the Female Factory, where prisoners of that sex, sanely or insanely unruly, are incarcerated. I had"], [141, "137 A FEMALE REVOLT. an opportunity of visiting it with the Governor, and have no wish either to repeat the visit, or to dwell on the details thereof. The numbers of the tenants of this establishment are, since the cessation of transportation, much diminished ; but it is not many years ago that the Amazonian inmates, amounting to seven or eight hundred, and headed by a ferocious giantess, (by all accounts, a regular she-Ajax,) rose upon the guards and turnkeys, and made a desperate attempt at escape by burning the building. The officer commanding the troops then occupying the stockade, who gave me this account, sent a subaltern with a hundred men, half of them armed only with sticks, and an effort was. made to drive the fair insurgents within one of the yards, in order to secure them. This man\u0153uvre, however, failed. They laughed at the cane-carrying soldiers, refuting their argumentum baculinum by a furious charge upon the gates, in which one man was knocked over by a brickbat from Mrs. Ajax. The military were reinforced ; the magistrate made them load with ball cartridge, and the desperadas were eventually subdued. This unladylike ebullition was considered, as I am assured, the most formidable convict outbreak that ever occurred in the colony, not even excepting that of Castle Hill, in the year 1804 ! I believe the periodical close-cropping of the women's hair was the prime cause of the outbreak. From Samson downwards it has been a dangerous trick to play man or woman. I have known many a good soldier. rendered disaffected by the harassing warfare waged against his whiskers and side-locks by martinet officers. In the case of the Paramatta factory,"], [142, "138 OUR ANTIPODES. the Governor was diplomatic enough to relax the de pilatory laws. A penitentiary is not precisely the market to which a squeamish man would go for a wife. The Governor, however, was, in old times, besieged by applications, both from manumitted prisoners and respectable settlers, for helpmates from this factory. I was told by an officer who had been an eye-witness of the same, that it was amusing to see the aspirant for matrimony passing in review a lot of women selected to be chosen from. Good looks were but a trifling consideration 5 former character and mode of life were proscribed subjects of inquiry. Health and strength, with tolerable conduct in prison, were sufficient dower. The stockade of Castle Hill, of which a few bricks now alone mark the site, was placed on a beautiful range of hills, a few miles north of the Paramatta River, at present covered with settlers, and distinguished for luxuriant orange-orchards and vineyards. Several hundred prisoners were employed there by the Govern ment in clearing and cultivating the country, then clothed with forest. These men, having contrived to collect about 150 stand of arms, besides pistols, pikes, pitchforks, and other agrarian weapons, advanced, in number about 360, upon Paramatta. The major com manding the New South Wales corps, having notice of the conspiracy, marched from Sydney with only forty men, (all that were available for the service,) and with out hesitation attacked the rebels, who, having but a bad cause, made but a bad fight. The result may be given in a few words. Sixteen were killed out of hand,"], [143, "HONEY-MOONS. 139 twelve wounded, thirty made prisoners. \"The rest they ran away;\" but, being starved out, they yielded, and five were hanged. Those were not the days when any scruples existed as to the orthodoxy of hemp as an in strument of correction. There was no fear of Exeter Hall before the eyes of the local executive. In an old history of the early days of the colony, I find that some where about the same date six soldiers were brought to the gallows at once, \" for the unpardonable crime of procuring false keys to the public stores, and committing frequent robberies upon them while on guard.\" Their offence was aggravated by the fact, that the then infant settlement of Sydney was in the greatest distress for provisions; and the punishment was the more appro priate, that it diminished by so many the mouths con suming the scanty stock! In 1850 these plunderers would possibly have gotten fifty lashes at the triangles, and a sensitive and humane public and press would have fidminated indignant remonstrances at the barbarity of the sentence. There are two excellent inns at Paramatta, which must be chiefly supported by the jaunting cits of Sydney.

One wants the post-boys, though ! An awkward, pully hawly, broad-brimmed, mufti old coachman, whose whip has no sort of connexion with his leaders, and who has no notion of the pace rigorously correct on such occasions, jars upon one's prejudices, and introduces the \"jog-trot,\" sooner or later an infallible element of wed lock, much too early in its career ! Paramatta is the Richmond, the Versailles, the Barrack pore of Sydney. The plaisance of the Governor is situated on a gentle eminence above the fresh-water stream, a few hundred yards westward of the town, looking over the trees of its lawn directly down the main street, which may be three quarters of a mile in length, abutting upon the Sydney steam -boat wharf. The dwelling-house looks like that of an English country squire or gentleman farmer, of some 1,500/. a-year. It was much out of repair at the time of my first visit, but was thoroughly put in order for the present Governor. I have passed many happy hours under its shingled roof. The domain around the house comprises a Government reserve of 5,000 acres. Some part of it, the Toongabee Hills, is prettily undulated and well cleared. The greater portion, however, remains in its native bush state. The"], [145, "141 PARAMATTA. whole is substantially fenced in. Treated as a farm, this place ought to be worth several hundreds a-year to its possessor. Either as a place of residence or resort, Paramatta possesses great advantages in its double access by land and water \u2014 wheels or paddles. On a cool day, the trip by the river is very pleasant as well as pretty. The country on the northern bank is elevated and picturesque ; and both shores are studded here and there with solid stone houses and snug cottages, with tolerable gardens, and orange orchards truly Hesperidean in their profusion of golden fruit. The passer by their fences must himself be a \" dragon of virtue \" to resist despoiling them. On the whole, however, considering that it is more than half a century since the river's banks were first settled by grants from Government to free colonists and half-freed convicts, the river allotments are not so thickly populated as might be expected from their vicinity to Sydney, nor as would have been the case had the water been fresh. A French traveller, my fellow-passenger in my first trip up this creek, fell into ecstacies \u2014 ecstacies are cheap in France \u2014 with the scenery on either hand, pronouncing it \" charmant, charmant!'\" and declaring that it was a chose etonnante that the banks were not covered with the villas of the rich seigneurs and citizens of Sydney.* There is plenty of fish in the stream, especially the guard-fish, or dagger-fish as it might be called, for it closely resembles in appearance a miniature sword-fish. * The finest place on the Paramatta Biver is Newington, the residence of the Blaxland family, whose late head was one of the earliest and wealthiest emigrants from the Old Country."], [146, "142 OUR ANTIPODES. Paramatta has not the air of a thriving place. Amongst the causes of its evident financial indisposition are assigned the removal of the Government establishments on the cessation of transportation, and the undue absorption of trade into the capital \u2014 an instance of centralization unequalled in any part of the world, for nearly one fourth of the population of a country, perhaps 700 miles long by 250 in width, is crowded into the chief town. Houses may be had here at 50 per cent, below the Sydney rates of rent. Provisions are no dearer than at the capital. November Wth. \u2014 An early start \u2014 for early starting is the soul of Australian travelling \u2014 from Vineyard en route for Bathurst. Passing through Paramatta, whose some what somnolent echoes were startled by the sound of the ten wheels and thirty-six horse-shoes of our cavalcade, and skirting the Domain, we soon found ourselves trotting brisldy along the high-road to Penrith, our half-way stage of this day's work, a village about nineteen miles from Paramatta. Our route up to that place lay through the metropolitan county of Cumberland. Without being absolutely picturesque, the country is agreeably undu lated, the soil good in many parts, and free from the deep ravines common to the sandstone tracts. Even in these days there appears, along the road-side, at least ten times more bush than cleared land ; but the woods are all fenced in for pasturing purposes. We were particularly struck with the fine dark loam of the Prospect Hills, cultivated to the very summits, and the well-chosen site of Veteran Flail, the residence of Mr. Lawson, with its luxuriant orange-groves and"], [147, "\" OLD IRONBARK.\" 143 vineries, contrasting in their vivid green with the leaden hue of the gum forest below. This gentleman, one of the oldest, if not the oldest inhabitant of the colony, was formerly an officer of the New South Wales corps, which was raised in England for the purpose of escorting prisoners of the Crown to the colony, and of eventually becoming settlers. He was of the proper stuff for one of the pioneers of a raw, rough country. That he pos sessed the necessary personal activity is proved by his constant practice, before horses were common, of walking from the barracks at Sydney to Prospect one day, and back the next, as a common occurrence, and in the hottest weather \u2014 about twenty miles. Mr. Lawson was one of the three gentlemen who first penetrated those same Blue Mountains, over whose ridges we are now about to pass by means of as good a hill-road as any in New, or indeed old, South Wales. I find this exploit alluded to in a notice to the colonists by Governor Macquarie, dated 10th June, 1815, in these words : \u2014 \" To Gregory Blaxland and William Went worth, Esquires, and Lieutenant Lawson, of the Royal Veteran Company, the merit is due of having, with extraordinary patience and much fatigue, effected the first passage over the most rugged and difficult part of the Blue Mouutains.\"* The weather of this day was terribly oppressive. It was thought that our start had been made too late in the season; but the quick passage through the air, the occurrence of new objects, and the knowledge that in a * \" Old Ironbark\" died full of years in 1850. Mr. Lawson was- thus familiarly styled, after the hardy forest-tree of that name."], [148, "144 OUR ANTIPODES. few hours we should have climbed into a cooler climate, prevented us, as long as we were in motion, from feeling any exhaustion from the heat. Many of the road-side inns \u2014 and every mile or two has some establishment of the kind, ranging between the hotel and the shebeen house \u2014 are rurally picturesque, reminding one pleasantly of home. They are generally built of weatherboards, on a frame of wood, with a bit of garden in the rear ; the old-fashioned horse trough, hollowed from the trunk of a tree, now almost extinct in England, in front, and a tall sign-post, bearing some old familiar title, \" The Traveller's Home,\" \" The Cottage of Content,\" so expressive of welcome as to be well-nigh irresistible, especially when the sun is hot, and the weather and the traveller equally dry. And, indeed, there is a large class of wayfarers in this country, (perhaps in all others,) who never resist this particular invitation. In some of my rides and drives from Sydney to Para matta, I have been astounded by the powers of absorp tion displayed by certain of my fellow-countrymen, especially when horse-racing happened to be the osten sible object of the passengers on the road. At a moderate calculation there is a pothouse for every mile of the fifteen ; and I am certain that the same gig, with the same two fat men, have passed me, pulled up, and repassed me ten times in that distance. Tasting every tap, and trusting, I suppose, to profuse perspiration as a safety valve from absolute explosion, they were to be found tossing off a foaming glass under every sign-post, while the wretched horse gets no refreshment beyond a temporary relief from the weight of his masters. \" That ain't a bad nag, Sir; steps well. There cau't"], [149, "145 BUSH TAVERNS. be much less than two-and-thirty ' stun' in that buggy, Sir,\" remarked to me my old coachman, (who had driven for twenty-five years between London and Huntingdon,) as we were tandeming along one day on this road ; and in ten miles we had as many opportunities of admiring the speed and action of the horse, and the size and sponginess of the two Sydney butchers who sat behind him. The most abject-looking little bush taverns on Austra lian roads do not fail to announce \" Good accommodation for travellers ;\" and many of them advertise \" Secure paddocks for teams and fat cattle, with good water.\" The poor people pick up a good penny from the travelling drays and the herds coming down for the Sydney market. At one of the more pretentious public-houses where we stopped to water our horses, there was a private race course belonging to the establishment ; and a notice was put up that a \" First-rate Saddle\" and a \" Prime fat Hog\" would be run for on a day named \u2014 a common scheme for collecting together a crowd of drinkers. His Excellency had been apprised that addresses would be presented at all the towns on the fine of march. Accordingly at Penrith, before we had time to look round us, we found ourselves in a very stuffy crowded little court-house, where a cut-and-dried but most loyal and hearty address was read to the new Governor, and an equally ready-made but compli mentary reply was rendered in exchange. Penrith is a neat little town ; yet I was assured that the town is not a town, because the proper site of the township is at some distance, having been abandoned, VOL. I. K"], [150, "146 OUR ANTIPODES. on account of the brackishness of the water, for the present position. Even here on higher ground the water is brought from the river, a mile off at least ; and at the inns it tastes and smells like very weak grog, the supply being kept in old spirit casks. After the presentation of the address we regained our dusty carriages, and passing onwards through the village and along a mile or so of road lined with pretty cottages \u2014 pretty although formed of nothing but \" split stuff\" and bark \u2014 we reached the \"Emu Ferry Inn,\" an excellent two-storied brick-house posted on the right bank of the Nepean river. Here, halting to refresh ourselves and horses, we found good rooms and wholesome fare, with the draw backs, however, of an unmannerly host and a landlady so ultra Yankee-like in her independence, that it did not permit her to rise from her chair to receive the daughter of a Duke and the lady of the Governor ! In 1850, when travelling as a family man, I passed an hour or two at this inn for rest and refreshment, when both host and hostess were equally invisible, neither of them condescending to welcome the coming nor speed the parting guest. All transactions were, per force, carried on with the servants. In travelling, civi lity is the only gilding to the bitter pill of overcharge ; and in New South Wales it too often happens that the passenger finds in unfair connexion a dirty hovel and a morose landlord with the charges of Mivart's or the Clarendon.

The view from the Ferry inn, looking westward, is very striking. Right in front, across the Nepean, the long range of the Blue Mountains rises abruptly out of the dreary, sun-baked flat of Emu Plains \u2014 those Blue Mountains so long, (nearly a quarter of a century, indeed,) the western boundary of New South Wales ; for it was not until the year 1815, when the great road was completed, that Governor Macquarie travelled by it to the champaign country beyond these Australian Pyrenees, aud announced to the colonists the newly laid open land of promise. Thitherto the territory occupied by the English extended only eighty miles north and south of Port Jackson, by forty from that harbour to the base of the hills. Many and desperate attempts had indeed been made by enterprising individuals to penetrate and explore"], [153, "149 THE NEPEAN RIVER. this great natural barrier. As the flocks and herds increased, and wider pastures became a question of life and death to them and of ruin or prosperity to their owners, these attempts became more resolutely obstinate, and were ultimately crowned with success. Through a deep gorge a few miles south of the ferry, the Nepean bursts upon the low country with a tribute of fresh water such as is nowhere equalled in the settled districts of this arid continent. Passing onwards in its fertilising course, and washing the townships of Rich mond and Windsor, it, unreasonably enough, changes its name to the Hawkesbury, and finally loses itself in the estuary of Wide Bay on the eastern coast. There are some really fine estates in this neighbour hood ; that of the late Sir John Jamison is in sight of the inn. The name of Regentville, is, in the mind of old colonists, associated with the times and practice of unbounded hospitality and profuse expenditure, such as never again will be seen in New South Wales. A whole clan of the family of Cox are settled along the river's banks within visiting distance of each other, and, on family epochs, meet together in formidable numbers. At a later date I passed some pleasant hours at two of the houses of this family. Fernhill, the residence of Mr. Edward Cox, is only a few miles from Penrith. A handsome stone house overlooks by far the most lovely and extensive land scape \u2014 as a home view \u2014 I ever met with in Australia ; and its beauty is much enhanced by the taste and success of the proprietor in weeding out the thinly leafed and unsightly kinds of the gum-tree, and"], [154, "150 OUR ANTIPODES. preserving only that species of the Eucalyptus called the apple-tree, which, with its stout gnarled branches and crisp tufted foliage, is, when standing alone or in clumps in parkish looking ground, by no means a bad representative of the English oak. Were it not for the vineyards and wine-houses at Fernhill, a stranger might imagine himself at the country-house of some substantial English 'squire. Mr. Cox's neighbours north and south in the beautiful vale of Mulgoa are two of his brothers. The three estates comprise about 11,000 acres, and all being cleared in the same tasteful manner \u2014 not a stump left to deface the pastures \u2014 there is an unity of homelike landscape unlike anything else of the kind I have met with out of England. The vale of Mulgoa, along which these properties extend, looks, from the heights of Fern hill, as if it were intended to be the bed of the Hawkes bury. This great river, however, after meandering about for some distance among the sunny meads of the peaceful and fertile valley, turns abruptly into the moun tains, and, losing itself for twelve or fourteen miles among wild crags and dismal forests, re-appears through a grand rocky portal, placid and smiling, upon the Emu Plains, and so takes leave of the Blue Mountains for ever, on its way towards the ocean. In my wanderings along the valley of the Hawkes bury, I have seen the properties, with handsome dwell ing-houses on them, of six of the Cox family, inherited from their father, who, like many of the oldest and wealthiest of the colonists, served formerly in the New South Wales corps. To persons like him a grant of"], [155, "151 REGENTVILLE. land from Government was the foundation of a fortune ; to many others only the commencement of ruin. From Fernhill I rode one day to Regentville. There are sermons in its stones, in its gardens and vineries ruined and run to waste, its cattle-trampled pleasure grounds, its silent echoes. My foot sank through the floor where many a joyous measure had been trod. The rafters were rotting that had ofttimes rung to the merriment of host and guest ; and, if rumour lies not, there were \" sad doings \" as well as merry ones at Regentville in the days of its prosperity ! Just belo.. the park in the valley stands the huge shell of a steam-mill which cost 7,000/. and was in tended for a mill of all trades ; and not far from it a windmill equally remarkable for size and solidity. The steam-mill never got up its steam to any good purpose for its enterprising builder ; and as for the windmill \u2014 putting aside its present want of sails \u2014 its position is so surrounded with high hills that it can never have raised the wind to a remunerative amount for him or any one else.

The mode of traject is very inconvenient, and it is to be hoped the colony will soon be rich enough to afford a bridge. The ardent and ignorant sportsman, who expects to find emus on Emu Plains, will no more succeed than he would in finding buffaloes in the streets of Buffalo on Lake Erie. As there are now no bisons within 1,000 miles of that go-a-head town, so there are no emus"], [156, "152 OUR ANTIPODES. within 200 or 300 miles of the Plains named after that bird. The river, now about 200 yards wide, appears to have formerly flowed over the whole expanse of the flat land, for on its thinly grassed surface are scattered quantities of large quartz boulders \u2014 pebbles such as Goliah might have slung at David, had their duel been conducted with \" slings for two.\" I looked in vain for any traces of the Government agricultural establishment which had been formed and maintained at vast expense. The military, commissa riat, and police stations have dwindled down to an invalid soldier or two in charge of sundry tumble-down buildings, and one or two fat constables full of beans and with nothing to do. If proofs of decadence such as this are chargeable on the withdrawal of the convict system, it requires some courage and self-denial to rejoice in the cause. Having traversed the Plains for two miles as straight as a French causeway, the road runs plump against the Blue Mountains, or rather against that part of them called Lapstone Hill, and begins to wriggle up the ascent as best it can under the directing hand of the engineer. The southern flank of a profound ravine abutting upon the Plains has been chosen for the eastern ter minus of the Great Mountain Road ; and I think there is no part of it finer or more creditable as a work. The highway is absolutely carved out of the living rock. Huge slices of the hill side have been blown off by blasting, hurled by convict crowds into the gulph"], [157, "153 LAPST0NE HILL. below, or pounded by them into the material now called Macadam. \" Villanous saltpetre \" and villanous hu manity have been the great agents here, as in many other parts of New South Wales. Had England been always \" virtuous,\" there would have been no \" cakes and ale \" here. Had she reared no robbers and homi cides, burglars and forgers, the Australian Colonies in general, and the Great Western Road in par ticular, would, in all human probability, never have existed. On our right yawned a profound gully, at the bottom of which, struggling through water-worn crags and fallen logs, \u2014 proofs of foregone torrents, \u2014 was hardly to be discerned a wretched little streamlet, quite out of human reach. Beyond the gully rose a rough jagged precipice, with hardy and obstinate trees of large growth clinging to its face ; enabling the traveller to form an estimate of the difficulties encountered in making the road on this side of the ravine. Right and left, above, below, the everlasting gum-tree filled the landscape; \u2014 the gum in all its varieties \u2014 and its varieties are scarcely various. But in the dark and damp spots near the water-course, the graceful casuarina, the delicate yellow blossomed acacia, and a lofty kind of box, with small shining leaves, mingled branches refreshingly with the great staple of the bush. At the top of Lapstone Hill the horses were allowed five minutes to 'Tecover their wind, and ourselves to admire a very pretty bridge thrown across the head of a dry gully. Among the scrub under the arch was a peach-tree in full blossom, evidently owing its birth to"], [158, "154 OUR ANTIPODES. a stone thrown away by a fruit-eating traveller from the Plains. At nine miles from the Nepean, having been one hour and fifty minutes in performing that distance, we reached the \" Welcome Inn,\" kept by a jolly old soldier named James, who rejoices in a Waterloo medal, a pretty daughter, and, what was more to our purpose than either, some excellent bottled ale. In these parts this delicacy costs 3a1. a-bottle, \u2014 not a wonderful price when one considers the distance and difficulties between its native brewery on the banks of Trent and the top of the Australian Cordillera. The old campaigner had fought through the Pen insula in the 40th regiment, as he informed me, and came out to this country in a company of veterans escorting prisoners. Three years later, when I paid him a second visit, his Waterloo medal had been joined by another, granted by her Majesty for Peninsular service, with two or three clasps for general actions ; his pretty daughter had married and left him ; and his ale had come down 6d. a-bottle. Beyond this house we toiled through miles and miles of heavy sand, with dense forests on either hand, and without a human habitation to cheer the scene. The ascent, however, after the first thousand feet, is fortunately gradual. Here and there we met long caravans of drays, drawn by six or eight horses, or ten or twelve bullocks, and laden with wool-bales, hides, &c. : or we overtook similar vehicles charged with stores \u2014 tea, sugar, tobacco, &c. \u2014 chiefly for the"], [159, "155 DRAYS AND DRIVERS. great squatters of the interior; for in the distant dis tricts, if the employers of labour did not act as com missaries for the subsistence of their servants, the latter might starve, there being few and often no shops whence they could procure the commonest necessaries of life. Wherever nature or the last thunder-storm had sup plied a rill, a spring, a water-hole, or even a puddle, however muddy, we found encampments of these slow moving wains, the horses and oxen hobbled and turned adrift to feed on the scanty herbage ; some of the drivers cooking at the root of a huge half-burnt tree, that looked as if it had served as stove and oven time out of mind ; others smoking in the shade, or sleeping on mattresses or fur rugs spread under their drays, where, at night, with the aid of a tarpaulin, they are secure from rain and dew. Strange, wild-looking, sun-burnt race, strong, rough, and taciturn, they appear as though they had never lived in crowds, and had lost the desire and even the power to converse. So deeply embrowned were the faces, naked breasts, and arms of these men, and so shaggy the crops of hair and beard, that a stranger had to look twice to be certain they were not Aborigines. I have seen many an oriental tribe much fairer in skin. The halting-places seem to be well known and used by all. They are generally some small level plateau, whereon the grass grows greener from the manure of the frequent cattle.

Amongst the rugged and weather-worn men, old and middle-aged, I noticed some of the tallest and handsomest young men I ever saw. Except in the gullies, the forest trees of these moun tains are rather stunted than large. Among the leading trees are the Ironbark, with its tall, black, upright, and rugose trunk, looking the very picture of hardihood. The timber is extremely useful, making the strongest and most lasting fences. Under ground it resists rot as well as \" Kyaned \" oak at home. There is the Stringy Bark, a gum with the streamers of its epidermis twenty and thirty feet long, hanging like a beggar's garment from its ragged stem, or rolled up on the ground pre cisely like great sticks of cinnamon. There is the White Gum, with its smooth, polished, round, and naked limbs, looking so like human limbs as to be almost indecent in their nudity. Among the smaller growth of the bush is the Bottle brush, with its rigid cones and harsh leaf, contrasting sharply with two delicate and graceful neighbours, \u2014 the Exocarpus or native cherry, and the Wattle or Acacia, covered with golden bloom, and embalming the sur rounding air. Beneath these, in some places, grew a showy underwood of Euphorbias, Epacris, Boronias, Correas, and I know not what besides. Gleaming through all was sand, \u2014 sand sufficient to supply Old Time's hour glass to all eternity.

On the left we skirted for miles a range of stag beaded forest, dying apparently from the roots of the huge trees having struck the rock \u2014 a most dismal scene, only perhaps equalled by a subsequent one of thousands of acres of thickly-timbered land all around us, in pro gress of destruction by fire; fallen log and flourishing tree, fresh sapling, flower, and shrub and herb all blazing and blackened and smoking \u2014 vast result perhaps of a spark from a stockman's pipe, or the cast-away cigar end of a thoughtless mail-passenger. Not a blade left on many a weary league of sand and rock \u2014 not a drop of water, for the doomed oxen that are counting upon both on their upward journey.

The barracks and convict \"boxes\" form a little hamlet of some two dozen build ings of white-washed slabs with tall stone chimneys, laid out on a rocky plateau cleared of trees, and commanding a prospect of melancholy and desolate sterility \u2014 qualities certainly not reflected upon the joyous countenances of the captain and his wife, nor symbolical of his well peopled nursery. The prisoners here form what is called an iron-gang\u2014 or ironed gang. They are employed working, in chains, and for periods according to sentence, on the repairs of the high road. We passed several lots of these wretched creatures \u2014 England's galley-slaves \u2014 clanking along with straddling gait and hopeless hang-dog looks to their allotted labours, escorted by soldiers ; or working with pick and spade, crowbar, maule and wedge on the stub born rocks \u2014 working with mule-like slowness and sulki ness because forced to work by fear of the lash. 'Tis thus that convict labour is less valuable than at first would appear. Unpaid and compulsory work is always bad and slow work. His Excellency had a parade of the prisoners, and we passed down the ranks as we might have done those of a regiment.

Newgate Calendar, or the \"Causes Celebres.\" Nor would they have read amiss; for many of the squad under review had been convicted of the blackest crimes that ever be- devilled humanity. The convicts are marched to and watched at their work, marched to and watched at their meals, which they eat in a shed open at back and front,\u2014 marched to their wooden beds, and shut up under lock and bayonet until morning ; yet, spite of all care and vigilance, many of them have escaped or tried to escape \u2014 braving the bullet of the sentries, the lash, Cockatoo Island, the gallows, and what is hardly less terrible, the chance of dying of hunger in the bush. The scaffold is the more frequent destiny of the suc cessful runaway from such a place as Blackheath. He has neither food nor money ; he would be recognised as a prisoner by his grey dress and his close-cut hair, if having contrived to rid himself of his chains, he were to beg a crust of bread at a road-side house. One resource only offers itself, not very repugnant probably to his case-hardened mind. He lies in wait, cudgel in hand, for some lonely traveller, rushes upon him unawares, strikes him senseless, takes his money, his clothes, and his arms, if he have any. Should he resist he murders him, and casts the body into some lonely gully. \" Murder will out,\"\u2014 and strange have been the means of detection in such cases : a drayman in search of stray oxen, a passing dog, attracted by the scent of the mouldering corpse, the unerring sagacity of the black scouts of the Mounted Police \u2014 have been the instruments of discovery. Even when the assassin has resorted to"], [165, "161 RUNAWAYS. the common stratagem of burning the remains of his victim under a pile of dead wood, a scrap of cloth, a button, even the peculiar size of a limb bone which has escaped combustion, have been sufficient to identify the murdered man, and to throw suspicion, perhaps con viction, on the murderer. It will readily be believed that, during a journey like that we are now prosecuting, and in the wildest part of that country, where bush-ranging may be said to have been first invented \u2014 especially when strangers in the colony were the listeners\u2014 bush-ranging became a fre quent subject of conversation. It will be conceded too that Blackheath, from its old Home associations, is no inappropriate locale for some slight allusion to the subject. The numerical strength of our party and our escort of police rendered us perfectly secure from any attack, although several notorious runaways were known to be harbouring somewhere within reach of the road among the deep fastnesses of the mountain. The ransom of a Governor might indeed have tempted a bandit of high pretensions. But, in truth, the days of bush-ranging on a large scale are long gone by. One hears no more of such heroes as Donohue or Walmsley, who had at their backs organized bands strong enough in men and arms, and horses when they wanted them, to sustain pitched battles with the military and police ; carrying with them a regular commissariat of cattle and sheep, levied from the settlers too weak to resist the foray ; washing down good beef and mutton with rum, wine, and tea, rifled at the pistol's point from travelling drays ; smoking tobacco quite mild enough for VOL.

It sounds like a jolly life. Without much more risk to the neck than is necessary to make fox-hunting charming, what wonder that it should have been popular ? \" For the benefit of country gentlemen,\" it may be well to give at this place a definition of the term Bush-ranger. This cannot be more concisely done than in the words of the Act of Council passed for the sup pression of such criminals, intituled \u2014 \" An Act to facilitate the apprehension of transported felons and offenders illegally at large, and of persons found with arms and suspected to be robbers.\" He is, in short, a runaway convict, desperate, hopeless, fearless ; rendered so, perhaps, by the tyranny of a gaoler, of an overseer, or of a master to whom he has been assigned. In colonial phrase, \" he takes to the bush.\" I well remember the confused notions I had in early boyhood somehow imbibed regarding these people. De vouring with more appetite than discrimination all books of travel and adventure, real or fictitious, and making a geographical hash of the Cape of Good Hope, bush rangers, bushmen, and boschmen, were in my eyes one class \u2014 namely, armed savages, pillaging and preying upon the white settlers ; and the bush in which they ranged was a sac-simile of the gooseberry and currant beds at home \u2014 only of wider extent. I wonder if children of the present day have any clearer view of a subject which interests them and their teachers so very remotely !"], [167, "163 BUSH-RANGING. When bush-ranging was at its zenith, twenty or thirty years ago, the gaol-bird who could make certain (almost to a given day) of flitting over the prison walls, and the chain-gang desperado, who found means to break his bonds, were in possession of sufficient \" office\"* to enable them to go straight to the bush-rendezvous of some noted leader, where they commonly fell into the enjoy ment of \" a short life and a merry one,\" greatly detri mental to the honester part of the community, and terminating naturally in the policeman's bullet, or the hangman's hemp. In the heart of Sydney, the ancient quarter called \" The Rocks \" is well known to have been, and still to be, the general intelligence department of that numerous class in New South Wales which might be styled the predatory. There the murderer and burglar found, and yet finds, customers for his \" swag\" in the professional \" fence,\" or receiver of stolen goods, and a safe asylum for a time from the efforts of an inefficient police. The Rangers of Her Majesty's forest in New South Wales are, of course, well informed in all matters likely tc put money within easy reach. Travellers about to start are put under close but not obvious surveillance. The grand desideratum is, of course, cash ; but cheques and orders, which are constantly and necessarily passing between the interior and the capital, are readily nego tiated.

A good haul is sometimes got from the periodical payments of provincial publicans' licences through the post-office to the colonial treasury, the time and channel of remittance being well known to those chiefly con cerned, namely, the bush-rangers. A settler goes to a neighbouring town, or fair, sells a horse or two, some pigs, or produce ; he goes home rejoicing, and delivers the money to his wife, at whose hands, the very next morning, when the good-man is gone to his work, a couple of crape-faced fellows demand the price of the property disposed of on their account. Simple farmers, or labourers, with six months' wages in their pockets, incautiously \" flash\" their money at pot-houses, the very head-quarters of bush-ranging plots. The landlord cannot afford to be squeamish, however suspicious he may be of the quality of some of his guests. The half-drunken betrayer of the state of his purse is watched, waylaid, and quickly relieved of all trouble as to the investment of his gains. The character of the Australian bush-ranger of former days was invested with something of the dignity ac corded to the terrible Buccaneer of the American coasts, the gallant Caballero del Camino of Castile and Mexico ; nay, even of that ballet-and-tableau-and-fancy-ball darling, the silver-buttoned, ribboned, and gartered"], [169, "165 HIGHWAYMEN. bandit of the Apennines. His business was so profit able that, like some of the more elevated highwaymen of the old country and olden times, (when, to ride over Hounslow Heath, or Finchley Common, after dusk, was to be robbed,) the bush-ranger of mark and likeli hood could occasionally afford to be magnanimous. Not that magnanimity was his generic peculiarity. If gene rosity and humanity were not the leading attributes of the old English robber, who sometimes wore a bag-wig and steel buttons on his velvet coat, it becomes a logical consequence that the doubly- distilled desperado of Botany Bay was not the man to do much to raise the character of the trade. In the present days, at any rate, there is nothing of the romantic or chivalrous in the annals of Australian bush-ranging. The modern newspapers, on the contrary, teem with petty and cowardly robberies of the poor, and the old, and the defenceless ; hard-working operatives cruelly beaten and robbed of every copper, and every rag of clothing ; half drunken pedlars with gutted packs and hamstrung horses ; or some helpless, feckless old woman rifled, and rumpled, and left with her \" petticoats cut all round about,\" and without a glimmering in the world how or by whom, or when, where, or why, it all happened. Even now, however, half a dozen times a year, some frightfid, sweeping and barbarous outrage fills the columns of the public journals, and reminds one how deeply the old felon infusion has poisoned the corporate mass. So lately as September, 1850, when travelling with my family along this same mountain road, we found on the walls of every inn a Government notice,"], [170, "166 OUR ANTIPODES. offering a reward of 50/. \" to any free person, or a pardon to any prisoner of the Crown, who would give such information as might lead to the apprehension and conviction of one Henry Carroll,\" on charges of robbery with violence, and of rape.* Several other rather red-handed gentry were known to be \" illegally at large \" at the same period ; yet the rich squatters and landowners, members of council, and others, travelled quite unconcernedly in their carriages, on horseback, or by the mail, most of them making a point never to carry any fire-arms nor money more than sufficient to buy off a broken head if stopped. All hotel bills are payed by cheques, \u2014 a prudent plan for more reasons than one. It is notorious, that when highway robbery was rife in Europe, inn-keepers often connived at the practice, and, indeed, played into the hands of the gentlemen of the road. I am far from asserting that such is the case in New South Wales at present ; but many of the roadside lonely hostelries are kept by persons who have been prisoners ; and in all of them there are servants, often in places of the highest trust, still serving their sentence on tickets-of-leave, in whom the chink of a fat bag of sovereigns, or a glimpse of a plethoric pocket-book, might re-awaken dormant propensities. Experienced travellers, moving singly, are not in the habit, as I have said, of carrying weapons, because their * In November, 1850, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that a man, supposed to be this Carroll, had been taken by the police at Carcoar, but had again escaped, leaving his horse and bridle in the hands of one of the constables."], [171, "167 MOUNTED POLICE. display is apt to provoke maltreatment, and they can rarely be used with effect, seeing that the wearer is usually taken by surprise at some convenient spot, and has no time for preparation. As for carrying money, \" Cantabit vacuus,\" &c. is a good motto for the traveller. For myself, when not travelling in so much state as on the present Vice-regal progress, I took but little cash, but there lay within reach a double-barrelled pistol on which I could rely ; and, in very ugly spots, motiving an ardent desire for ornithological specimens, I put together my gun, loaded with Eley's swan-shot car tridges, an excellent charge for execution, either in the foreground or middle distance of a \" stand and deliver \" scene. However, I never met with any obstruction of that nature, and am truly glad of it, for whether the rencounter ended in victory or defeat, in being taken aback or taking the life of a wretch ill prepared for his last account, subsequent reflections could not be other wise than sore ones. I find in my notes not a few anecdotes of bush ranging, most of them orally delivered to me, and will here insert a small selection from my Collectanea. But first, and in strict connexion with the subject under notice, let me give a slight sketch of that excellent force, the Mounted Police ; a force which has done much good service in the country, especially in the suppression of convict outrages, and which, long before this book can be published, will, through the mistaken parsimony of the Local Legislature, have ceased to exist. The mounted police force is drawn from the infantry regiments serving in New South Wales. It was first"], [172, "168 OUR ANTIPODES. established in 1825, under the government of Sir Thomas Brisbane, the infant corps consisting of two officers and thirteen troopers only. The numbers, gradually augmenting, reached in 1839 the maximum of 9 officers, 1 sergeant-major, 156 non-commissioned officers and men, and 136 horses, 20 of the troopers being dismounted. Thus was formed an efficient body of mounted con stables, controlled by military discipline, and subject to military law ; for, although appointed to serve in the police, they remained as supernumeraries on the roll of their regiments ; and on the removal of these regiments from the colony, the men were transferred to the reliev ing corps. The officers are magistrates. The dress is a neat and serviceable light dragoon uniform ; the arms, the sabre, the carbine, and the pistol. The head quar ter's division, consisting of the commandant, the adju tant, and about 25 men, is stationed at Sydney, and the officers of divisions at different inland posts, with small parties on all the main roads. Many a gallant service was performed by this useful corps. Many a desperate bush-ranger was taken or slain by them ; many a formidable banditti broken up, or hunted down, until they yielded in despair. Many were the flocks, and herds of cattle, and horses, re-cap tured from the outlaws. Many the murders, and rob beries, and outrages on men and women prevented by the terror of their name and neighbourhood. The pri vations endured by officers and men on these expeditions were very great j great the perseverance and intelligence Avith which they followed up the tracks of the brigands"], [173, "169 CONFLICTS WITH BLACKS. through forest, scrub, and swamp, rocky gully, and sandy plain. Sometimes the numerical odds were fear fully against them ; but, although crime often fights with desperation, it is seldom successful against cool valour. The mounted police were, moreover, called into action very frequently against the aboriginal tribes, who, on some occasions, attacked the distant grazing stations, pillaged the premises, speared or drove away the flocks, and even murdered the shepherds and stockmen. In one instance, at least, it is to be feared that forty or fifty of these ignorant but ferocious savages fell under the fire of the troopers. Irritated by one of their sergeants having been treacherously wounded with a spear, they charged into the thick bush, where, out of sight and control of their officers, they took a fearful vengeance on the barbarian foe. Generally, however, in their collisions with the blacks, they behaved with laudable moderation and forbearance. In the case just cited, the party had been sent 300 miles to repel the repeated aggressions of these people, and it had become absolutely necessary to drive them away from the spot where they had committed them. I cotdd never discover any sustained record of the active services in which this force had been engaged ; but I find many complimentary allusions to such in old books of general orders ; a few despatches detailing encounters with robbers ; and, as before stated, a good many reached me by oral tradition, some of which I noted down as received."], [174, "170 OUR ANTIPODES. The following transcript of a report from one of the most dashing officers ever employed in the mounted police to the Governor of the time, Sir Ralph Darling, will bring vividly before the reader's eye the \" scenery and machinery \" of a conflict between the police corps and a band of bush-rangers. The stage whereon it was enacted is situated on the extreme western limits of the colony. ' Lieut. Turner's Farm, Dividing Range, 16th October, 1S30. \" Sir, \u2014 I have the honour to inform you that I arrived at Warwick on the 9 th inst., at which place I was in the hopes of falling in with Lieut. Brown ; and at all hazards it was my intention to place myself under the directions of that experienced officer \u2014 for whose situ ation, after the defeat of his five men, I could not help feeling the deepest concern. In this I was disappointed, having been informed that Captain Walpole and himself had crossed the Lachlan River, thirty miles to the west ward, on the morning of the 6th. \"On the 10th I took a south-west direction from Warwick, and on the following evening (11th) fell in with that determined and ferocious banditti, near Barona Plains, where a hard contested skirmish took place between them and my party \u2014 which at that time con sisted of myself, two non-commissioned officers, six privates, and one constable. The banditti were twelve or thirteen in number. \"We were engaged about twenty minutes, the bush rangers retreating gradually and returning a brisk fire,"], [175, "171 POLICE AND BANDITTI. keeping themselves dexterously covered by the trees \u2014 the worst shots amongst them loading for the best ones. \" This continued until we had driven them back about half-a-mile from the ground they had taken up \u2014 when I found that all the ammunition of my party was expended but a few rounds, which I deemed it right to reserve to protect the disabled in the event of the worst consequences. \" I was, therefore, forced to allow the banditti to pursue their retreat, with three of the most desperate of them so severely wounded that they could only retire but a short distance, and with the loss of all their cavalcade of horses, provisions, and other plunder. The three wounded are now under escort to the Goulbourn Plains. \" In this skirmish (which would have terminated in the decisive fall of the banditti if my party had had more ammunition, or if they had exposed themselves as fearlessly as the soldiers) myself received a slight wound in the left thigh, two privates were slightly wounded, one horse killed and two wounded. I regret to say Constable Daniel Geary was dangerously wounded whilst making a gallant push to support the two right flank men, who were exposed to a sharp fire and in danger of being surrounded. I cannot too strongly recommend this brave man, who is a native of the colony (white), to the consideration of the Governor, should he survive his wound. Indeed, I can say' of all my party that no one exceeded another in coolness and courage. \" Captain Walpole came up with me on the morning of the 12th, and not having been able to keep my seat"], [176, "172 OUR ANTIPODES. on horseback, I placed the effective men of my party under his command. He was on the 1 3th on the tracks of the remainder of the banditti, seven in number, out of their knowledge,* and without a morsel of provisions, and I am hourly expecting to hear of their capture. In fact, they cannot escape. \" This affair will, I trust, put a stop to the unfortunate mania entertained by the convicts in the district of Bathurst ; and it ought to convince those misguided people that a less number of soldiers, regularly opposed to them, are always sure to defeat them. (Signed), \"L. Macalister, \" Lieut. Mounted Police.\" It is only necessary to add, that the whole gang was taken by Capt. Walpole, seven of them having been severely wounded. Just a month before this brilliant bush-battle, Donohue, the most successful as well as the bloodiest malefactor that ever broke bonds, was killed in a determined fight with the police, which had a heavy score to reckon with him. Not long before his end he had shot dead a young officer, whom he met on horseback, and attempted to rob. The unhappy young man, unwilling to be plun dered by a single footpad, struck spurs to his horse and attempted to ride over the villain. Donohue, stepping aside and letting him pass onwards, took deliberate aim and shot him through the brain at full speed. The following incident was related to me by a gen tleman well acquainted with the chief actor in this * i. e. not \" en pays de connaissance.\""], [177, "173 A CLEVER CAPTURE. remarkable case of capture of a large band of armed convicts by an officer's party of the mounted police.

The readers of Joe Miller will recollect the Hibernian soldier, who boasted, according to that veracious annalist, that he had made prisoners of a whole section of the enemy, single handed, by surrounding them. Mr. , not being an Irishman, did no such impossible thing. Stealing cautiously through the bush, with his little party of four or five men, he espied the banditti, in number about sixteen, busily cooking and eating in a hollow, some thirty yards below where he stood \u2014 their arms piled a few paces distant. Leaving his men above with orders how to act, and creeping down the bank, he suddenly jumped into the midst of the robbers, shouting out, \" Yield in the King's name, ye bog-trotting villains !\" Then, looking up towards his party, \" Send down,\" cried he, \"two file to secure the arms ; stand fast the remainder, and shoot the first man that moves.\" About twenty stand of arms were thus taken possession of, handcuffs were applied as far as they would go, and, incredible as it may appear, the disarmed banditti, with their teeth drawn, were safely conducted by their captor to the neigh bouring township."], [178, "174 OUR ANTIPODES. A medical gentleman, long resident in the colony, related to me a lamentable case, which fell under his professional cognisance. A young officer of the commissariat, on a visit to a friend near Liverpool, a town about twenty miles from Sydney, had just left the house on horseback, when three armed men rushed out of a thicket and ordered him to stand. Intuitively he lashed his horse and sprung forwards \u2014 when the leader of the robbers fired his piece, the ball entering behind the ear and coming out at the cor ner of the eye of the unfortunate young man. He fell, and after wandering about all night, blinded with agony and half dead with cold, was luckily discovered by his friends. Although his life was by skilful treatment saved, he entirely lost his sight : nor was fortune yet tired of persecuting the sufferer. So soon as he was well enough to move, he was provided with a passage in the ship Cumberland, for England. This vessel, it is supposed, was captured by pirates on the voyage. Nothing ever transpired regarding her fate, except that some articles of sea-gear, marked with her name, were seen in a buc caneering boat, the crew of which had boarded another vessel. It is gratifying to know that in this case the villains had no long impunity. An active magistrate of the district, with only the chief constable to assist him, put himself instantly on their traces. Knowing the features of the country well, they looked out for the smoke of a fire in the bush, for the weather was unusually cold. The expected vapour was soon seen to rise above the trees on the border of a creek. In less than twenty-four"], [179, "175 A PUNCTILIOUS FOOTPAD. hours after the shot was fired, the magistrate pounced upon the ruffians ; and not very long afterwards they were hanged at Liverpool. Whilst on a visit at *, the Messrs. , who are natives of the colony, informed me that, in their nu merous journeys through the bush, over a period of thirty or forty years, they had never but once fallen in with bush-rangers. It occurred as follows i the two brothers, with an old gentleman, a friend of theirs, were riding together unarmed, but accompanied by some dogs, when the elder brother saw two men, one carrying a musket the other a bundle, dive into the bush on the road side.

However, on reaching the spot, he threw the dogs into covert, and they soon \" unkenneled the varmint.\" The old gentleman, who, it appears, was, like many old gentlemen, of choleric temper, called on them to yield, at the same time pouring upon them a torrent of abusive epithets, and closing upon them with his horse. \" Stand back, and keep a civil tongue in your head, or I'll blow out your brains !\" exclaimed the man with the muskx^t ; \" I don't want to hurt you, if you let me alone ; but I'll have some of your lives if you meddle with me !\" Mr. , then addressing them mildly but firmly, advised them to surrender, as the gentlemen were deter mined to capture them.

Upon this the major, having borrowed a large horse-pistol from the constable, placed it behind his gig apron, and drove on his way. A solvent looking gentleman, solus in a buggy, is the very thing for a highwayman ; and accordingly he had not proceeded half a mile, before, sure enough, a horseman galloped up from the rear, passed ahead, then suddenly pulling up, commanded him to deliver his money. The gallant traveller instantly plucked out his pistol, and, without more ado, let fly at the robber's head, who fell heavily to the ground from his saddle. The major thought him dead ; but to make all safe, he jumped out, and tied his hands behind him. This job was hardly completed when the bush-ranger recovered his senses ; and his captor, who at this time was neither so young nor so strong as when he learnt the goose-step forty years before, had the satisfaction to find that his prisoner was alive and well, a remarkably fine athletic young fellow, and likely to have proved a Tartar had not his horse thrown him by shying at the report of the pistol. The same report being heard by the policeman, he quickly reappeared upon the scene of action ; and this clumsy practitioner in the profession of Dick Turpin was safely carried off to a place of confinement. \" Dans les malheurs de nos meilleurs amis il y a toujours quelque chose qui ne nous deplait pas,\" writes the great French maxim-monger; nor could I help laughing in the face of a respected colonial friend of mine, when he confided to me how, as he was once upon a time gigging along this unblest mountain road, he was VOL.

The, reader may smile, if he likes, at my next anec dote. A gentleman whom I met at Bathurst, and who is well known in the colony for his humorous qualities, was stopped on a bush-road by a rough fellow, who, rushing upon him, thrust the muzzle of a pistol into the pit of his stomach, roaring out at the same time, \" Stand, you , or I'll blow out your brains ! \" \u2014 - \" My good fellow,\" retorted Mr. P , with perfect self-possession \u2014 \" you won't find my brains down there ! \" The ruffian laughed heartily at the joke, and treated, as well as robbed, the joker with a degree of tenderness and civility very foreign to his usual habits of doing business. I cannot omit the following characteristic incident in the bush-ranging line, which was related to me by the driver of one of the inland mails : \u2014 During that period of the history of the colony when highway robbery was an everyday affair, he was driving from Windsor to Sydney with several passengers \u2014 one of whom on the box was well armed \u2014 when, at the foot'of a lull, they came upon the body of a man lying upon its face in the middle of the road. \" A case of robbery and murder!\" remarked the passenger; and"], [183, "179 A MAIL ROBBERY. the coachman, impelled by Samaritan feelings, drew up his team, and was in the act of descending to see if life still remained in the plundered stranger, when \" Bail up\u2014 or you're dead men!\" resounded from behind a thick tree, through a fork of which a double-barreled gun covered the driver's head ; whilst at the same moment the couchant bandit \u2014 for such he proved to be \u2014 sprang to his feet, turned the leaders across the pole of the carriage, and had his blunderbuss at the armed passenger's breast before he could get at his pistols. The coachman was then compelled to take his horses off, the passengers were ordered severally to get out and to \"bail up\" \u2014 like cows prepared for milking \u2014 at the fence-side. Their pockets were rifled, the mail-bags were slit open, and letters containing money extracted ; and finally the carriage was permitted to proceed with its impoverished freight \u2014 minus, moreover, its leaders, which were required to carry the footpads to some chosen hiding-place distant from the scene of their exploit. The armed passenger, it appears, was roughly treated. Getting away with whole limbs, he got away with inexpressible discomfort to his nether ones ; for the weather was inclement, and the bigger of the two brigands, complimenting him on his being \" a tall fel low like himself,\" borrowed his trowsers, putting them on over his own, and leaving him to pursue his journey not only \"poor,\" but bare \"indeed.\" I close the subject of bush-ranging with the following inscription engraved on a mural tablet in St. James's church, Sydney.

I believe this unfortunate gentleman met his end in a rash attempt to apprehend single-handed a desperate and well-armed robber on his own estate. During the five years of my residence in the neigh bourhood of \"Botany Bay\" I was only once robbed \u2014 to my knowledge. But this instance was somewhat remarkable, for it occurred to me in the open day, with my sword by my side, and in the house of God. The sacrilegious rascal displayed some knowledge of human and male nature in the mode he acted. As I passed with the crowd down the aisle to leave the church, I became aware of a man trying to push his way between me and my wife. I jostled him in return \u2014 which was precisely what he wanted. Suffice it to say, that when I put my hand in my pocket to take out my mite for the church-door plate\u2014 my purse was absent without leave. If a certain correspondent in 1850 of the \"Sydney"], [185, "181 UNFLEDGED FOOTPADS.

The young idlers of the town form themselves into gangs, and take up positions on the roads leading to the city from the bush. Here they waylay and rob smaller boys, or weaker parties, of their \" five corners,\" a wild berry of the scrub, \"according to the most skilful methods of highway robbery.

Under the guidance of Captain Bull, soon after our arrival at Blackheath, some of our party went to visit it. Pushing our way for half an hour with no little labour through the thick and dark forest, suddenly a bright though filmy expanse of sun-lit air appeared through the close-growing trees, and in the next instant we stood on a bare rocky shelf, looking into and over a magnificent basin scooped among the mountains\u2014 about five miles across and perhaps a thousand feet in depth. The bottom of this wide and profound abyss is so densely over grown with wood, that not a speck of earth is visible from above.

A stronger gush occurred now and then, but the thin stream never appeared to reach the depths below. Australian waterfalls are indeed but sorry affairs. I fancy there are very few, if any, permanent ones. As to the name of the place I could gather nothing further than that it was first discovered by one Mr. Govett, a surveyor ; but whether this gentleman took a literal or only a poetical jump into his own punchbowl did not transpire. It is certainly one of the grandest freaks of nature I have seen in any country \u2014 quite beyond the power of pen or pencil to delineate. I have seen an attempt by the most talented artist in the colony to transfer this scene to canvass. It is a fine picture, but not \" Govett's Leap !\" One very striking effect of thus breaking out of the forest gloom upon such a landscape, is the beautifully clear and opaline tint of the atmosphere \u2014 an effect due perhaps to the transparent purity of the air in this climate and these altitudes ; for Blackheath is nearly 4,000 feet above the sea. In the bush around we found the Waratah growing in great perfection.

I saw here for the first time the black cockatoo, which, in a flock of about twenty, kept screaming at us as long as we were in sight. This handsome bird is as large and as black as a crow, with a fine crest, and a long fan-tail beautifully striped, sometimes with scarlet, some times with orange bars. He is very shy, and in no instance has been domesticated. Pursuing our journey from Blackheath in the afternoon, a few miles brought us to Sir Thomas Mitchell's chef d'osuvre in road-engineering, the Victoria Pass. At two points on the summit the narrow parapeted ridge looks on either hand sheer down into deep bush valleys of immense extent, beyond which range after range of wooded mountains blend at length with the clouds in the indistinct distance.

Ere we reached this highland hamlet we came upon a considerable body of horsemen, who, saluting his Excellency with loud and hearty cheers, so astonished our horses, if not ourselves, as nearly to drive the whole cavalcade over the precipice.

Our attention and admiration were next arrested by Hassan's Walls \u2014 an immense crescent of crags naturally castellated, four or five hundred feet high, towering above the forest, and frowning grimly down upon the road which winds round their base.

At one extremity of the \" walls,\" there stands an isolated pfllar of rock, known by travellers as the Duke's Head. Not far from this spot, at a little wayside tavern, with two or three cottages near it, where we did not stop, a party of women and children came forward, smiling and curtseying, and carrying arras and aprons full of flowers, which they threw before the Governor's carriage \u2014 a sight we hardly expected to see among the wild recesses of the Blue Mountains. Not so pleasing a feature, although a characteristic one, was the scene occurring in a small hut a little further on. A drunken man and his wife, or more likely his concubine, equally drunk, were swearing and fighting, with bloody faces, over their cups ; and they gave us a maniacal shout as we passed. This was what is called a \"sly grog-shop,\" where all sorts of liquors are drunk without licence, and all sorts of ruffians get drunk \"on the premises\" with every kind of licence. There was a still, perhaps, on the hill side, not far off. We passed this day through large tracts of country of the most dreary and most unavailable character; yet here and there were very grand and even lovely peeps of distance through the trees. At length \u2014 and indeed it was a hard day's work in weather so hot, and roads so dusty and rough \u2014 at length, shortly after dusk, we came in sight of Binning's Inn, wrhich we approached through a triumphal arch of foliage and flowers, while fireworks fizzed and cracked their compliments to the Viceroy and his lady."], [193, "187 PROVINCIAL INNS. This inn is decidedly the best on the line, with active and obliging people, good plain cookery and clean beds. Doubtless, the foreknowledge of the Governor's visit had produced along the road no little furbishing and refitting of the mountain taverns ; for we found humble but successful attempts at neatness and comfort in almost all of them ; although, if I recollect right, a fair and clever, but somewhat severe writer, my predecessor by a few years, has condemned them wholesale as a parcel of filthy dens. In some of the Australian houses of entertainment, and particularly those far inland, it has indeed occa sionally been my fate to be allotted a very small and very hard bed, more thickly peopled than was pleasant \u2014 the blankets with insects, the chaff paliasse with mice ; a soup-plate, a milk-jug, and one small cotton rag, for basin, ewer, and towelry ; a public hair-brush and comb, that looked as if they had curried bullock-drivers for a whole summer; and a looking-glass grimly cor rective of personal conceit.

But, after all, this is not an Australian peculiarity. In England itself \u2014 clean and comfortable England \u2014 the traveller (sometimes the visitor) who habitually practises what may be called general ablution, is too often stigmatized by the race of chambermaid, house maid, and housekeeper, as \" a nasty, dirty man, always messing and slopping about !\" Mr. Binning is a sculptor and stonemason by trade. He possesses several hundred acres of land, and a capital stone-built private residence, apart and on the opposite side of the road from the tavern.

I have heard prophets of evil foretel that the rapid ncrease of European and deciduous plants in and around Sydney, and the proposed formation of water reservoirs in its vicinity, and in that of all the larger towns, will in time produce epidemic disease. It will take, I conjec ture, a good many \" falls of the leaf \" to make the sands of Sydney a subsoil : but on the other hand, if a population of 50,000 persons are permitted to herd together much longer in such a climate without a tho rough underground drainage, it requires no inspiration to predict that, sooner or later, they will be decimated by some sweeping malady. It was, as I have said, a beautiful morning : the aspect of the country too became more smiling. In place of the eternal sandstone, the granite with its glittering mica was now the prevailing rock. The trees were larger and not so closely set ; and the undulating slopes were covered with tolerably good grass. Here was to be seen a herd of sheep browsing straight a-head according to their wont \u2014 lingering where the pasture was abundant, and nibbling at a trot across tracts that, having been lately burnt, were thinly covered with nice young shoots of grass. A tail-less colley gathered, unbidden, a troop of frisking lambs from under our carriage-wheels , while the shepherd lay lazily supine, reading \" Chambers's Miscellany\" \u2014 as I was near enough to perceive. Far below the road, near"], [196, "190 OUR ANTIPODES. the water-courses, we descried here and there the variega ted skins of a herd of cattle sheltering themselves under the dark shade of the Casuarinas.

We saw them dead or dying in the yokes of the teams ; in the water-holes into which they had rushed in a fury of thirst : the dingo sneaked away from his foul feast at every resting-place. Some were sticking fast in the muddy pools, too weak to extricate themselves, and no one had been mer ciful enough to spare a bullet to put an end to their sufferings.

He had found a remedy against the wild dogs, by keeping tame ones of a fierce, swift, and powerful breed, \u2014 one of which, a splendid animal, half mastiff half greyhound, he assured me would go out of his own accord and of malice prepense, accompanied by a small cur which hunted by scent, and would not only kill, but bring home the dead dingo. Immediately beyond Solitary Creek the road begins to climb, or rather is dragged by the resolute will of the engineer, right over the summit of Mount Lambey \u2014 one of the highest peaks of the Blue Mountains, \u2014 a work which earns the hearty curses of every bullock driver, and the objurgations of every traveller of a higher grade who is compelled to follow the vaulting ambition of its originator. Cut an orange in two \u2014 lay one-half of it flat on a plate \u2014 then ask yourself is it easier to go round it or over it, and is there any difference in distance ? That Mount Lambey is avoidable we ourselves proved on our return trip, by taking the valley of Piper's Flat. But we were told of a better line than either that has long been known. From the summit of Mount Lambey Sir Thomas Mitchell succeeded in intersecting at night the light house on the heads of Port Jackson \u2014 a distance of about ninety miles. To the top of this hill we had about five miles of terribly steep and rough ascent \u2014 yet hardly more difficult than some other passages we"], [203, "FRACTURES. 197 had encountered and overcome in this toilsome journey. Sometimes at a trot, oftener at a walk, we pushed on \" with difficulty and labour hard.\" Heat, dust, swarms of flies, scarcity of water, jaded horses, rocky steps, broken bridges, deep mud-holes, and awfully yawning precipices, did not prevent \"the sportingest Governor that ever I see,\" (for thus was my distinguished cousin eulogized by a well-known Sydney publican,) from stick ing to his box the whole of this tour : nor do I believe that any other individual of the party, gentle or simple, could have got that carriage and those four horses over such an extent of rough and dangerous roads without breakage. (In my humble opinion, his Excellency handles the reins of his government with no less skill, judgment, and temper.) As to my own vehicle it is not too much to say that scarcely a fragment of its original materials got back to Sydney. One or two of our fractures were of so complicated a nature, that my companion and myself had to contemplate the puzzle for some moments before we could comprehend its details \u2014 much less remedy it. I particularly remember one case where, plumping suddenly into a hole, the hind wheels actually ran over the fore ones \u2014 a mode of \" changing front\" unheard of in military man\u0153uvres. In choosing a carriage for a rugged journey, low fore-wheels should always be avoided. Sir Charles's tool-box was in constant requisition by us; and great was the ingenuity of the mounted police men, two old bush-hands, in repairing damages with straps, ropes, and poles cut from the roadside."], [204, "198 OUR ANTIPODES. Somewhat later in our tour, while trotting merrily down a hill not far from Bathurst, we were far from edified by seeing one of our fore-wheels taking an independent and divergent course of its own ; and we had hardly time to calculate on the consequences ere they occurred ! As a proof of the readiness of resource which necessity imparts to persons of all conditions living in the Bush, Mr. Suttor (who accompanied the party at that moment), on seeing our accident came to our assistance, and from an old boot and an old nail manufactured a couple of new washers and a new linch pin for the recreant wheel, to such good purpose that it carried us safely to Sydney \u2014 about one hundred and twenty miles. During the journey we passed several spots where the road- gangs had been established in temporary stockades. In one of these there is an excellent stone house, the quarters of the officer of the guard, aban doned to decay ; and of the hut village of the prisoners nothing remains but a Stonehenge of tall grey chimneys. These road-gang relics give additional gloom to the dismal character of the mountain scenery. The super intendence of convict stockades was an unseemly duty to be thrust upon an officer of the army. He was a slave driver \u2014 a gaoler \u2014 -a captain of banditti \u2014 without the excitement and profits of the post. He had abso lute power as a magistrate. The condition of the prisoners depended almost wholly on the disposition of the officer in charge. He could encourage or flog, pet or torment them, according to his temper. He could do worse \u2014 namely, leave them to the mercies of"], [205, "A CONVICT'S REVENGE. 199 subordinates, convict constables, and others. The con sequences may be imagined. The following instance of vulgar tyranny and its punishment was related to me by a servant who had been a prisoner at the time of the occurrence. In digging the portion of soil allotted as his task, a pri soner of an ironed gang broke in upon an ants' nest of that large and venomous kind called the Lion Ant. Being severely stung he jumped out of the hole. The overseer ordered him to get in again. The man pro posed that the nest, should be blasted with gunpowder. The overseer repeated his order ; the man obeyed, but, tortured by the fierce bites of the insects, he again desisted from his work. Upon this the other seized him and thrust him once more into the ants' nest. The prisoner plied his shovel for a few minutes, but the tempter was busy at his heart ; and, suddenly springing out of the hole, he cleft the skull of the overseer with his spade, and killed him on the spot. It is quite needless to add that the perpetrator of this act of \"justifiable homicide\" was hanged. From Mount Lambey the general tendency of the road is downwards. We stopped to bait at a little wild looking inn near \" Diamond Swamp.\" In New South Wales the word swamp is generally significant of good alluvial land, and in the populated parts it is usually found covered with crops of grain instead of the water which originally lay upon it. The numerous dried bogs and waterless lakes of this country give likelihood to the theory that its surface has risen considerably, and is still being thrust upwards from the earth's centre."], [206, "200 OUR ANTIPODES. Near Sydney, the swamp-grounds in the immediate\" vicinity of sandhills, fifty feet deep, are wonderfully fruitful ; one acre is worthless except, perhaps, to make glass of, (when a manufacture of that material shall be opened at Sydney,) while its immediate neighbour lets to market-gardeners for 8/. to 10/. a-year. The trees were now larger and fewer in number ; the character of the country less rugged. We were leaving rocks and ravines, peaks and precipices, for the swelling moor and curving upland. These, in their turn, gra dually subsided like a calm sea, until the hills became gentle undulations, the thickset scrub open glade ; . and, at length, the troubled ocean of the Blue Mountains rippled out in wavy hillocks upon the smooth and wide expanse of the Bathurst Plains. How must the hearts of the toil-worn explorers have leapt with joy when, bursting from the dense bush of this rough Sierra, their eyes first fell upon the splendid champaign tract below them, containing not less than 50,000 acres of naturally clear land, covered with grass, and with a fine river flowing through the midst ! What a God-send, in the truest sense of the word, for the crowded and quickly multiplying flocks and herds, hitherto confined to the sea-ward of the mountains I It was, indeed, a rich reward of a gallant enterprise. The eldest son of Mr. Lawsou, one of the three dis coverers, and to whom a large grant of this valuable land was justly awarded by the Government, is to be the Governor's host for a few days. Looking at the Bathurst Plains merely as a military and migratory stranger, without the slightest vocation"], [207, "201 BATHURST PLAIN'S. towards \" settling,\" or sheep-farming, I could only contemplate them, at first sight, as affording a pleasant relief from the mental and bodily suffocation always experienced by me in a protracted journey through a thickly wooded country ; as a famous locale for a gallop highly refreshing after seventy or eighty miles of preci pices and gullies ; as a likely spot for the production of mutton, humbly imitative of Southdown ; and as a promising beat for quail-shooting \u2014 for I observed, as we descended rapidly to the level land, many fine patches of grain pretty sure to abound with the only represen tative of England's agrarian game found in the colony. One ought to be an Australian to appreciate Bathurst Plains as fully as he does. He looks at these very ugly and featureless prairies of scanty pasture land through a woolly medium. He \"grows\" wool, as the term is, and rich at the same time, by dint of these same plains, and others of a like nature \u2014 by the natural grasses of the country, in short ; his admiration of them is, there fore, quite intelligible. Except in unusually wet seasons, there is little water on them and less verdure. The grass grows in separate tufts like the strawberry plant, instead of forming a connected turf, a reddish calcareous earth showing itself through the interstices in some parts, and a black sun-cracked soil in others. A hardy kind of everlasting, with a stiff yellow flower, and a minute pink convolvulus, mix with the herbage, occupy ing the places of our daisy and buttercup. Presently we came in sight of a most extensive crop of the great staple of the colony \u2014 wool \u2014 flourishing on the fat saddles of some two or three thousand sheep,"], [208, "202 OUR ANTIPODES. which, under charge of a shepherd or two, were crawling like white maggots over the distant flats, carrying with them a cloud of dust nearly as dense as if they had been travelling on a turnpike road in the dog-days.

In this same room there dined, to meet his Excellency, no fewer than thirty five ladies and gentlemen, whom the provincial journal described as \" a select party of the elite of Bathurst,\" a phrase conveying the idea of an extraordinary degree of social sifting ! Yes, at this Australian country seat, 120 miles from Sydney, at which emporium European supplies arrive, after four or five months' voyage, enhanced nearly double in price, and with the superadded risk, difficulty, and expense consequent on a dray journey of another half month across almost impassable mountains, we found a well -dam asked table for thirty-five or forty persons, handsome china and plate, excellent cookery, a profusion of hock, claret, and champagne, a beautiful dessert of European fruits \u2014 in short, a really capital English dinner.

The explorers of those days fathered all their foundlings upon the willing Governor, so that he was driven at length to affiliate some of them under his Christian name ; thus we meet with \" Lachlan Swamps,\" Lachlan rivers, cum multis aliis. The facades of nearly every public edifice attest the vigour with which, during his long reign, the worthy general wielded the enormous convict power with which his office invested him. Their utility is beyond doubt, though many are going to ruin. There may be two opinions as to their beauty of de sign ; in mine, his Excellency's architect well merits the epitaph accorded to a famous predecessor, Van Brugh perhaps : \u2014 \" Lie heavy on him Earth, for he Laid many a heavy load on thee.\" This morning we drove to Bathurst, the capital of the district, eight miles, for the purpose of receiving an address and visiting the township. The road lay across the terrestrial billows, the long \"ground swell\" of the Plains, which reminded me in some degree of the \" rolling prairies\" of Iowa and Wisconsin, although the herbage of the latter is immeasurably superior. During the last four miles we were encompassed round about by an equestrian escort of all ranks and ages, in number about two hundred, which took us into its keeping for the remainder of the drive. There were"], [212, "206 OUR ANTIPODES. \"gents\" in green cutaways and cords; \"parties\" in black dress coats, satin vests a la Doudney, and white Berlin gloves; and one or two old soldier-like figures, with stiff stocks, formal whiskers, and upright seats. These contrasted well with many gradations of the real \" cur rency\" cavalier, handsome looking men in loose tunics and blouses, broad belts, tweed pantaloons strapped inside the legs with wide leathern stripes, cabbage-tree hats tied under the throat, bare necks, and beards and ringlets in hirsute profusion. There was an inferior class of the same order, wearing light drab jackets of colonial tweed, some with black velvet collars and cuffs, the everlasting cabbage-tree hat, white trowsers up to the knees, hunting spurs and whips. Here and there among the throng rode an individual of a Puritau or Romish cut, hurried by the general excitement out of his usual demeanour aud pace. Next came a legion of lathy lads, standing in their stirrups, and plainly showing by their first-rate equitation that their education had taken the direction of cattle-hunting and stock-driving rather than that of the humanities. All alike came charging along side, around, and behind; gallop, trot, canter, pull up, and gallop again ; themselves and ourselves in one con tinual cloud of dust\u2014 all apparent confusion, yet not one horse's nose at any time shot ahead of the vice-regal equipage. If ever the circumstances of the colony should compel it to raise a local force for the preservation of internal order, I would recommend the authorities to enrol a light dragoon corps, to be called the Australian Hussars. It would be a popular service with certain individuals"], [213, "207 LOYALTY. of all classes, fit, perhaps, for nothing else. There are plenty of old soldiers to instruct and command them ; and plenty of light, long-armed, bow-legged, (and, as James loves to depict his ruffling cavaliers,) \" deep chested and hollow-flanked\" fellows, who have been on horseback ever since they were born, and who know how to rough it in the bush, ready for the ranks of a regiment with good pay, a showy uniform, and a disci pline not too stringent. There are, moreover, plenty of active, wiry, and hardy horses, ready to \"mount\" such a body. At length we came down in one grand swoop upon the Macquarie River \u2014 the Wambool of the blacks \u2014 now a shallow gravelly stream shrunk between the wide-apart and lofty banks, but after heavy rains an impassable and destructive torrent. It was a curious and cheering sight to see the troop of horsemen accompanying us, and even the gentry delighting in gigs, like Ossian's car-borne heroes, taking the river at full gallop in the height of their glee, and making the water spin twenty feet into the air. All was loyalty and hilarity, pleasant to the eye and to the mind of an Old Country man and a good subject. Every one smiled and shouted a warm welcome to the new repre sentative of the Crown. Your Englishman will sometimes talk, sometimes write like a Republican. Your British colonist, when the shoe pinches will sometimes vapour about separation.

I cannot conscientiously compliment Bathurst on its external aspect. It is as yet the mere promise of a red-brick rectangular town, looking, as his Excellency remarked, (and Governors' jokes are always applauded and recorded !) looking as if it had just been put down to bake on the hot, bare and bright slope which forms its site. This site seems singularly ill-chosen. There is no \u2022shade from sun nor shelter from wind. The want of fuel will soon be severely felt \u2014 indeed has already been so, nearly all the neighbouring timber having been cut down, and no coal-mines existing in this Australian Traz os Montes. It is said that coal of good quality may be had at Piper's Flat, though none has yet been \"got\" there.

In his inland hotels, however, Brother Jonathan beats Brother Cornstalk hollow; but then the Americans, Laving less taste for domesticity than the Australians or Canadians, frequent such esta blishments infinitely more. In the little prairie town of Chicago, on the western shore of Lake Michigan, full 1,800 miles up the St. Lawrence, I found better French cookery at Shelby's hotel than is to be had at any table, public or private, in New South Wales \u2014 and wine as"], [215, "A DUSTY DEPUTATION. 209 good, with moderate charges. Yet Chicago was at that time not seven years old. Most of the members of the deputation destined to present the address having for the last hour revelled in the vice-regal dust as well as their own, the weather being moreover fearfully hot, and themselves (for they were substantial citizens and settlers) apparently in soft condition, a little delay was allowed them for ablutionary purposes ; \u2014 and indeed such was the plight we were all in, that it required the utmost aid of soap and water to ensure our recognition by our nearest friends. Meanwhile, the Governor retired with his ministers and suite to a private council chamber to discuss \u2014 beer, or rather a bland beverage called \" Apperley's mixture,\" concocted by that oriental gentleman \u2014 our companion on this part of our tour \u2014 and having bottled ale, ginger beer, mint, and sugar for its ingredients. Ah ! a Sybarite in search of a new pleasure might wisely compound for a throat-full of dust, to have it laid by such a draught as that cooling cup ! After the reception of the address we proceeded to visit the county gaol \u2014 a fine building, and one which in Australian towns has always hitherto\u2014 perhaps for obvious reasons \u2014 been the first public edifice erected ; except indeed the public-houses, whereof at Bathurst there are two at the corners of every street, while along each side of them the sign-posts are so numerous, as to form something like a vista of pictorial gibbets.

In my subsequent visit to this town in 1850 the church was in a complete state. \" All Saints\" is of brick, the style Norman, and the design very good. During the interval between those two years a great deal had been done by the Bishop in procuring the erection of small places of worship, and in appointing clergy for the thinly and somewhat wildly peopled Bush districts.

The very sight of the steeple and the sound of \" the church-going bell\" are useful mementos of the higher designs of our being for the thoughtless or depraved, the idle, the busy, and the vicious.

A stranger would argue that there cannot be customers for so many grog-shops. The fact is, that every month or there abouts comes an influx of bush-labourers to the town, with their pockets full of wages, for the express purpose of spending them. There is a glorious scene of drinking and riot for a few days or weeks ; their money is soon exhausted, pouched by the unscrupulous publican ; aud away they go again to their teams, their flocks, or their saw-pits, to earn money sufficient for another periodical debauch. Nor, when very flush of coin, do these rough fellows confine themselves to vulgar drinks. Sometimes they indulge in a bout at the \" swells' tipple,\" as they call champagne ; starting a dozen or two into a pail, and baling it down their throats with their tin mugs. Nay, for want of a baler, some of them have been known to lap up their liquor as cats do cream ! Grangosier him self could hardly outdo the bibulous capabilities of some of these spongy revellers. Almost incredible tales are told of the reckless sotting of the bushmen of the interior. I will adduce one only as related in 1849 by a provincial newspaper. Five labourers, who had \"stopped out\" the reaping and shearing at a long distance from the town of Gee long, put up at a well-known bush-tavern on the road ; o 2"], [218, "212 OUR ANTIPODES. and in the course of two or three days spent amongst them 130/., besides selling the whole of their clothes, bedding, shears, and reaping-hooks to the servants and hangers-on about the house, the price of which was also spent in drunkenness and riot. The worst of it is, that to encourage these brutal habits is directly conducive to the interests of the em ployers of labour, for no man in New South Wales\u2014 no unmarried man at least\u2014will do a \" hand's-turn\" of work so long as he has a shilling in his pocket. But I must not be too sweeping in an accusation of drunkenness against the bush-people. Teetotalism\u2014 that practical confession of the subservience of the soul to the body, of the power of the animal propensities over the reason \u2014 is prevalent among all classes in the pro vinces.

I have mentioned our visit to the gaol at Bathurst, because here I witnessed the effects of protracted con finement upon an Aboriginal prisoner. This man, Fish hook by name, had been sentenced to imprisonment for cattle-stealing\u2014 although it was by no means certain that he had not been the mere cat's-paw of white depre dators. When brought out of his cell for the inspection of the Governor, he showed little or no sign of intellect, and when I saw him again a month later he was quite idiotic.

Sir Charles ordered his immediate release ; and my excellent friend the member for Bathurst, un dertook to interpret his Excellency's merciful intention to the culprit, and to convey to him at the same time a suitable admonition. Now I have no wish to be presumptuous, but I do believe that, in spite of my late arrival in the colony and my utter ignorance of the blacks, I could have given utterance to as much genuine Australian as was com- prised in the spirited and ingenious harangue of the worthy senator. The language, or rather lingo, he employed occasioned us all much surprise at the time ; but we subsequently found that it was by no means an original invention of this gentleman.

Their legs were uniformly striped downwards with broad white lines. The first performance wras a war-dance, wherein a variety of complicated evolutions and savage antics were gone through, accompanied by a brandishing of clubs, spears, boomerangs, and shields. Suddenly the crowd divided into two parties, and after a chorus of deafening yells and fierce exhortations, as if for the purpose of adding to their own and each other's excitement, they rushed together in close fight. One division, shortly giving way, wras driven from the field, and pursued into the dark void, where roars and groans, and the sound of blows, left but little to be imagined on the score of a bloody massacre.

The gentlemen of our party alone attended the Corobbery; for whatever heraldry might do, decency could not have described any one of the performers as a \" salvage man cincted, proper !\" The men were tall and straight as their own spears, many of them nearly as thin, but all surprisingly active. Like most blacks, they were well chested and shouldered, but disproportionately slight below the knee. The chief of this tribe, and the only old man belonging to it, was of much larger structure than the others \u2014 full six feet two inches in height, and weighing fifteen stone. Although apparently approaching threescore years, and somewhat too far gone to flesh, the strength of \" the Old Bull \" \u2014 for that was his name \u2014 must still have been prodigious. His proportions were remarkably fine. The development of the pectoral muscles and the depth of chest were greater than I had ever seen in individuals"], [224, "218 OUR ANTIPODES. of the many naked nations through which I have travelled. A spear laid across the top of his breast as he stood up, remained there as on a shelf. Although ugly, according to European appreciation, the countenance of the Aus tralian is not always unplet.sing. Some of the young men I thought rather well looking, having large and long eyes, with thick lashes and a pleasant frank smile. Their hair I take to be naturally fine and long, but from dirt, neglect, and grease, every man's head is like a huge black mop. Their beards are unusually black and bushy. I have since seen one or two domesticated Aborigines whose crops were remarkably beautiful, parted naturally at the top of the head, and hanging on the neck in shining curls. The skin, however, is so perfectly sable, the lips so thick, and the nose so flat, as to qualify the Australian black for the title of the Austral negro. The gait of the Australian is peculiarly manly and grace ful ; his head thrown back, his step firm ; in form and carriage at least he looks creation's lord, \" erect and tall, God-like erect, in native honour clad. If our first parent l dwelt in Mesopotamia, and his colour accorded with the climate, his complexion must have more nearly resembled the Australian's than our own. In the action and \" station \" of the black there is none of the slouch, the stoop, the tottering shamble, incident all upon the straps, the braces, the high heels, and pinched toes of the patrician, the clouted soles of the clodpole whiteman. It is surprising that, naked as nature, the Aborigine"], [225, "219 DOMESTIC DISCIPLINE. can endure equally the hot winds of summer and the frosts of winter, a range of thermometer from 120\u00b0 to 20\u00b0. All the men are disfigured by the absence of one of the front teeth, which is punched out with great ceremony on the attainment of the age of puberty. Another very unbecoming practice in both sexes consists in a rude species of tattooing, performed by a series of cuts on the flesh of the breast and shoulders, which, by some special treatment, are made to heal in high ridges, having precisely the appearance of a weal from the severe stroke of a whip. Nor is the white head band, which tightly compresses the sorehead, any more ornamental than its use is comprehensible. According to the rules of what poor Theodore Hook called \" Free knowledgy,\" the Australian cranium is exceedingly ill shaped \u2014 the animal bumps largely preponderating over the intellectual. The women are mere drudges and sumpter-animals, preparing the food in camp, and on journeys carrying the baggage as well as the infants, wrhile the men stalk in front bearing their weapons alone. Wooed, as it is said, by dint of blows, they are ever after ruled by club law ; and there is for them no reservation as to the thickness of the corrective stick ! At meals they sit apart from the males, and their food is thrown to them as to the dogs. Polygamy, infanticide, and forcible abduction of females, are also some of the rumpled rose-leaves of Australian domestic life. The chief native weapons are as follows : \u2014 The spear, nine or ten feet long, rather thicker than one's finger, tapered to a point, hardened in the fire, and sometimes"], [226, "220 OUR ANTIPODES. jagged. The wammera, or throwing stick, shows con siderable ingenuity of invention. About two and a half feet long, it has a hook at one end which fits a notch on the heel of the spear, in whose projection it acts very much like a third joiut to the arm, adding very greatly to the force. A lance is thrown with ease and accuracy sixty, eighty, and an hundred yards. The waddy is a heavy, knobbed club, about two feet long, and is used for active service, foreign or domestic. It brains the enemy in the battle, or strikes senseless the poor \" gin \" in cases of disobedience or neglect. In the latter instance a broken arm is considered a mild marital reproof. \" La femme est sacree\u2014 la femme qu'on aime est sainte,\" gallantly writes a native of the most civilized of nations. \" A woman is a slave \u2014 a wife an anvil !\" would be the Australian free translation of the French dictum. The stone tomahawk is employed in cutting opos sums out of their holes in trees, as well as to make notches in the bark, by inserting a toe into which the black can ascend the highest and largest gums in the bush. One can hardly travel a mde in New South Wales without seeing these marks, old or new. The quick eye of the native is guided to the retreat of the opossum by the slight scratches of its claws on the stem of the tree. The boomerang, the most curious and ori ginal of Australian war-implements, is, or was, familiar in England as a toy. I believe its law of projection is not well understood. It is a paradox in missile power. There are two kinds of boomerang \u2014 that which is thrown to a distance straight ahead ; and that which returns on"], [227, "221 THE BOOMERANG. its own axis to the thrower. I saw, on a subsequent occasion, a native of slight frame throw one of the former two hundred and ten yards, and much further when a ricochet was permitted. With the latter he made several casts truly surprising to witness. The weapon, after skimming breast high nearly out of sight, suddenly rose high into the air, and returning with amazing velocity towards its owner, buried itself six inches deep in the turf, within a few yards of his feet. It is a dangerous game for an inattentive spectator. An enemy, or a quarry, ensconced behind a tree or bank, safe from spear or even bullet, may be taken in the rear and severely hurt- or killed by the recoil of the boomerang. The emu and kangaroo are stunned and disabled, not knowing how to avoid its eccentric gyrations. Amongst a flight of wild-ducks just rising from the water, or a flock of pigeons on the ground, this weapon commits great havoc. At close quarters in fight the boomerang, being made of very hard wood, with a sharp edge, becomes no bad substitute for a cutlass. Sir Thomas Mitchell, \" on observing the motion of the boomerang in the air, whirling round a hollow centre, and leaving a vacant centre of gravity,\" was struck with the idea of adopting its principle to the pro pulsion of ships ; and, if I mistake not, he received in 1848 a patent for the invention. I have not heard whether the idea had been made practical. The hieleman, or shield, is a piece of wood, about two and a half feet long, tapering to the ends, with a bevilled face, not more than four inches wide at the broadest part, behind which the left hand, passing through a hole, is"], [228, "222 OUR ANTIPODES. perfectly guarded. With this narrow buckler the native will parry any missile less swift than the bullet. In one of my visits to Mr. Suttor, the black, \" Fish hook,\" permitted me \u2014 no contemptible \" shy \" either\u2014 to pelt him with stones as rapidly as I could throw them at twenty paces, invariably turning aside those aimed at his head or body, and jumping over those directed at his legs. I thought the boomerang would have puzzled him, but did not propose a trial. In throwing the spear, after affixing the wammera, the owner poises it, and gently shakes the weapon, so as to give it a quivering motion, which it retains during its flight. Within fifty or sixty paces the kangaroo must, I should conceive, have a poor chance for his life. The natives are not always in the humour either for performing the Corobbery with spirit, or for exercising their weapons with skill, merely for the amusement of strangers. At Wellington, a noted good spearsman having missed three or four times the piece of bark I had set up for him, I put a sixpence on the top, and taking a policeman's carbine, made the black fellow understand, that if I knocked the coin down before him, I would re-pocket it. Whilst pretending to take aim, I saw the savage brace up his muscular little figure, fix his fierce emu-like eye on the target, and in an instant he had transfixed its centre at sixty yards. Having put the \" white money\" into his mouth, he had to exert all his strength, with his foot on the sheet of bark, to with draw the weapon. The spear is immeasurably the most dangerous arm of the Australian savage. Many a white man has owed"], [229, "223 SKILL WITH THE SPEAR. his death to the spear ; many thousands of sheep, cattle, aud horses have fallen by it. Several distinguished Englishmen have been severely wounded by spear-casts ; among whom I may name Captain Bligh, the first Governor of New South Wales, Sir George Grey, and Captain Fitzgerald, the present Governors of New Zea land and Western Australia, and Captain Stokes, R. N., long employed on the survey of the Australian coasts. The attack by the blacks upon the Lieut.-Governor of Swan River occurred so lately as December 1848. In self-defence, he was compelled to shoot his ferocious assailant, just too late to save himself being seriously hurt by a spear passing through his thigh. It appears singular that that simple but formidable arm, the bow and arrow, is unknown in Australia, as well as in New Zealand, although used by the natives of many of the smaller South Sea islands. The English man has a natural respect for the six-foot bow and cloth yard shaft which his ancestors wielded with so much prowess ; and he shows it by keeping up the practice of them as a pastime. I never heard of an archery meeting among the white votaries of fashion in New South Wales i \u2014 an out-door amusement so popular at home, and, as Mrs. Gore somewhere says, so well adapted \" to promote the consumption of young ladies, ham, chicken, and champagne,\" \u2014 not to mention that of Time, the old enemy of people who have nothing to do. But I forget ; there are no idlers in New South Wales among the men, and the ladies cannot afford to expose their complexions to a semi-tropical gon."], [230, "224 OUR .ANTIPODES. If the bill of fare of the Aborigine be not tempting, it has at least the charm of variety. Besides the kangaroo, which is his venison, the emu his pheasant, he has fish and wild-fowl, both of which he catches with nets neatly constructed by the women. Then he delights in such small game as snakes, guanas, grubs, and the larv\u00e6 of wdrite ants. The gum of the acacia, which resembles gum-arabic, but is sweeter, and the pulp of a bulrush ground into flour, are among his most innocent articles of food. Floney is no less so ; and the black deserves to enjoy this luxury for the dexterity with which he sometimes discovers its whereabout. Catching a stray bee, he sticks upon its little busy body with gum an atom of white down from the owl or swan, and, releasing the scared insect, follows it by eye and foot to the hole in the hollow tree where the comb is concealed, and whence it is quickly cut out, after the hive has been well smoked. Pity that all his gastronomic tastes are not quite so innocent ! but I fear \u2014 despite the resistance of this creed by some experienced colonists and travellers \u2014 that the New Holland savage is a most atrocious cannibal. If he be not so, for what purpose have long flakes of flesh been cut from the bodies of murdered men, white and black, and hung up to dry in the sun? And what peculiar virtue is there in human kidney-fat, which is undoubtedly accounted an article of value by the Australian tribes? I fear\u2014 very much fear, that the former is but the pemican, the latter the rognon, of the savage cuisine. The brawny chieftain, \" the Old Bull,\" is suspected of having in his earlier days treated one or more Englishmen \u2014 not to mention black-game\u2014"], [231, "225 CANNIBALISM. precisely as an Englishman would have treated a wood cock ; .'. e. brought him down in good style, given him a turn or two before the fire, and discussed him with zest and appetite. The jaws and teeth of this huge savage certainly promised unequalled powers of mastication. Well-authenticated instances of this terrible practice are to be found in the works of various authors ; but one, related in a parliamentary Blue Book of 1844, exhibits, as Sir George Gipps remarks, \"perhaps one of the most ferocious acts of cannibalism on record.\" It is too long and too horrible to find admission here ; but those who do not shrink from revolting details may find the incident alluded to at page 241 of the collection of Parliamentary papers on this colony, 9th August, 1844. Instances of parents killing and devouring their children, if uncommon, are not unknown. One of the Protectors of the Natives of the Port Phillip District has recorded a case in which an infant was butchered and eaten by its mother and brethren. \" Paidophagy\" in a mother may be considered as marsupial instinct pushed to the utmost extremity ! The language appeared to me soft and full of vowels and liquids ; and is spoken with extreme volubility, especially by the women. Some of the native names of places are grandly sonorous and polysyllabic. It is well when they are retained by the English possessors of the lands, instead of substituting vulgar and unmeaning European titles. Here are a string of names \u2014 taken at hazard (that sort of hazard that suits a purpose) \u2014 almost as round-sounding as old Homer's muster roll of heroes : \u25a0Wollondilly, Gelong, Bendendera, Coolapatamba, Tan- VOL. i. p"], [232, "226 OUR ANTIPODES. gabalanga, Pejar, Paramatta, Rhyana, Menangle, Gob beralong, Nandowra, Memendere, Ponkeparinga, Yass, Candalga, Molong, Karajong, Naradandera, Bong Bong ! * The mutual political relation of the White race and the Australian blacks, with reference to the possession of the country by the former, is peculiar to itself. We hold it neither by inheritance, by purchase, nor by conquest, but by a sort of gradual eviction. As our flocks and herds and population increase, and corre sponding increase of space is required, the natural owners of the soil are thrust back without treaty, bargain or apology. A tract of rich and virgin pasture is heard of through a surveyor or through some adventurous settler or stockman riding in search of fresh \"runs;\" and in an incredibly short time it is overrun with live stock. Heedless of the heritage of the savage, the vigilant squatter hurries to be the first white occupant. Depasturing licences are procured from Government, stations are built, the natives and the game on which they feed are driven back \u2014 the latter chased and killed by the Englishman's greyhounds ; the graves of their fathers are trodden under foot by the stranger; \u2014 and yet, wandering and irregular as are the habits of these nomadic tribes, they are as staunch in their local attach ments as other men. In proof of their sense of pro prietary right, Mitchell relates that the natives of the Darling River country, on seeing his men drawing water from the stream, desired them to pour it out from their * These names, f think, will scan, as they stand, into four hexameters."], [233, "227 NATIVE PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. buckets, as if it belonged to them\u2014 digging a hole to receive it when it was poured out. \" I. have more than once,\" says this enterprising explorer and pleasant writer, \" seen a river-chief, on receiving a. tomahawk, point to the stream, and signify that we were then at liberty to take water from it.\" If Mephistophiles could read the New South Wales police reports, how woidd he grin on finding ' that \" certain Aboriginal blacks had been apprehended and punished for stealing dead timber, the property of Mr. Whiteman,\" for fire-wood ! The said Mr. Whiteman had purchased the land, on which the timber grew, from the Government, or had received it in free grant from the same source. What did the Government give for these \" waste lands of the Crown ? \" Nothing ! The grandfather of the prisoner probably hunted over this very ground \u2014 the culprit himself was perhaps born under the very gum-tree whose fallen boughs he had been \" stealing !\" The native lords of the soil have, I conceive, infinitely greater cause for displeasure, when they see the white usurper hunting down for mere pastime the kangaroo and bustard of their rightful demesne, or pulling out of their scanty rivers the magni ficent cod-perch, than has the English lord of the manor and country justice of the peace, when he finds his coverts have been thinned \"of a shiny night,\" of a few pheasants, or his stews swept of a sack-full of carp and tench. Yet many a magisterial double chin has quivered with angry emotion whilst its owner held forth on the heinousness of poaching ; and, for aught I know, many a scape-grace bumpkin has found his way to this p 2"], [234, "228 OUR ANTIPODES. very country of the blacks for a crime no heavier than the wiring of a few hares or the netting of a few \"birds.\" A Christmas battue is spoilt, perhaps, in one case \u2014 a sad pity, I admit. But a tribe is starved to death, in the other ! What wonder that the native retaliates upon the sheep and cattle of the pale-faced trespasser on his land and food! He thinks, perhaps, in his primeval simplicity, that he has as good right to beef and mutton as John Bull-calf, the Anglo- Australian, has to kangaroo-tail soup. Can one reasonably expect that any man, whatsoever his complexion, possessing a vigorous appetite and no moral code, will dine off grubs and lizards when a sirloin or a saddle is to be had for the cast of a spear ? If a savage have any political creed he must be a leveller, a com munist ; and his resolution to share the white man's food is probably whetted by his knowledge, that the countless flocks that cover hill and plain, are the property of one person \u2014 and that person, perhaps, living at Sydney. It were well if the matter ended with the reciprocal destruction of property ; but the past history of the colony and the occurrences of every month prove the contrary. The aggressions of the savage are followed by acts of reprisal on the part of the white man. The overseer, the stockman, and the shepherd of the distant pasturing station may be hireling convicts \u2014 emancipist, expiree, or ticket-of-leavers \u2014 not models of virtue and forbearance. His sheep are \" rushed \" from the folds at night, his cattle driven off, speared, ham strung or otherwise mutilated. He passes three or four"], [235, "BLACK AND WHITE CONFLICTS. 229 days in the bush, hunting them up ; and perhaps only recovers in order to have them again dispersed. His master visits the station, blames his carelessness, perhaps doubts his honesty. The owner goes away. The shepherd and his neighbours arm themselves, mount their stock-horses, proceed in chase of the marauders, and gain at least a temporary freedom from black forays by shooting half a tribe and scattering the survivors. Some poor solitary shepherd or hut-keeper, perhaps utterly unconnected with this retaliatory expedition, repays with his life the unnecessary severity of the white party. His hut is robbed, his brains dashed out with a club. Three or four high-bred horses are speared, an imported Durham bull, value 200 guineas, or a Saxon ram, value 50, is hamstrung, and the rage of the pro prietor himself is now aroused. Reprisals are under taken on a large scale \u2014 a scale that either never reaches the ears of the Government, which is bound to protect alike the white and the black subject ; or, if it reach them at all, finds them conveniently deaf. Is it not enough to irritate even the Executive, when they learn that a policeman's horse has been stolen, killed, and eaten ! The squatters or their representatives at the stations combine, arm themselves and their followers, and proceed on the tracks of the black-mail barbarians, guided pro bably by a domesticated native, and, easily overtaking them on horseback, extermination is the word ! Men, women and children are butchered without distinction or stint. Superiority of weapon makes it a bloodless victory on the side of the Englishmen ; but there is a"], [236, "230 OUR ANTIPODES. species of excitement in it, and \u2014 children of wrath, as we are \u2014 it becomes by practice a pleasurable excitement. Dreadful tales of cold-blooded carnage have found their way into print, or are whispered about in the provinces ; and although there be Crown land commis sioners, police magistrates, and settlers of mark, who deny, qualify, or ignore these wholesale massacres of the black population, there can be no real doubt their extir pation from the land is rapidly going on. The savage is treacherous, blood-thirsty, cruel, un grateful \u2014 often requiting the kindness and generosity of the Christian who is really friendly to him, by burning his huts and crops ; or even barbarously murdering his benefactors. The civilized man is inordinately greedy of gain, and regards the black as a being scarcely above the beasts that perish. The result of this combination is the certain annihilation of the savage race. One of the great squatters \u2014 the pastoral Nabobs \u2014 of the north-west country, told me at my own table in Sydney, that, just before he came down, he \" had had a brush with the black fellows.\" It seems that three or four hundred sheep had been driven off by night ; upon hearing of which this gentleman (and I believe him to be at least as moderate and humane as the majority of his fellows) with a friend and his stockman, well-armed and mounted, went in pursuit. They shortly found that all the stock had been retrieved by the shepherds, with the exception of ten wethers, which the natives had carried off into a dense scrub, where the smoke of their fires strongly betokened roast mutton. The English-"], [237, "DESTRUCTION OF THE ABORIGINES. 231 men, fully resolved on beating up the quarters of the sable foragers, fastened their horses at the edge of the thicket, and, entering it on foot and following their noses, soon came upon the skins and remains of the lost sheep. Whilst examining the black camp, now vacant, they were suddenly saluted with a volley of spears dis charged by a peculiar knack, so as to fall almost perpen dicularly upon their heads through the tops of the tea-scrub, which was so thick as to be impervious to a point blank cast. Finding that a strong body of natives were silently closing upon and trying to surround them, they retreated Lo the open forest, and, each selecting a large tree, stood on the defensive. The blacks, rushing after them to the margin of the bush, let fly a shower of spears and boomerangs, which they avoided with no little difficulty. Thus beleaguered, the three English men opened a rapid fire of builets and slugs, which in a short time silenced and dispersed the enemy. On sub sequently inspecting the scene of action, the bodies of eleven natives and half-a-dozen of their dogs were found \u2014 as great a loss of life as has occurred in many a well fought frigate action. Twice as many must have been wounded. This affair was duly reported by the gentle man most concerned to the Commissioner of Crown lands, an officer representing the Government in the trans-frontier districts ; and I fancy it must have been considered a case of justifiable negrocide, for I never heard any more about it. In the same year a friend of mine connected with the colony, who had recently returned from a trip to the far west, for the purpose of catching up and driving in for"], [238, "232 OUR ANTIPODES. sale at Sydney a lot of horses, informed me that, while sojourning among the border settlers, he heard plans for the destruction of the Aborigines constantly and openly discussed. It was common, after an inroad of the blacks upon the sheep or cattle, for the men of two or three adjoining stations to assemble for a regular and indiscriminate slaughter, in which old and young were shot down, as he said, like wolves ; pregnant women being especial objects of destruction, as the polecat or weasel heavy with young is a rich prize for the English gamekeeper. Occasionally bush-gossip let out that the \" black fellows were going to get a dose :\" and indeed, in more than one known instance, \" damper \" well \" hocussed \" with arsenic or strychnine, was laid in the way of the savages, whereby many were killed. Some attempts were made to bring to justice the perpetrators of this cowardly as well as barbarous act ; but, in the bush, justice is too often deaf, dumb, and lame, as well as blind. The damper indeed was analysed, and poison detected therein ; but of course no White evidence could be obtained ; Aboriginal testimony is by the law of the land inadmissible ; the bodies of the poisoned were too far decomposed for a lucid diagnosis; and, in short, these deliberate murderers escaped the cord. Others, however, have been less lucky. About nine years ago a party of stockmen on Liver pool Plains, having had their herds much molested by the natives, determined on signal vengeance, and re solved to wreak it on the first blacks they met. Having fallen in with the remnants of a tribe, which being"], [239, "233 JUDICIAL RETRIBUTION. partially domesticated with Europeans made no attempt at escape, they captured the whole of them, with the exception of a child or two ; and having bound them together with thongs, fired into the mass until the entire tribe, twenty-seven in number, were killed or mortally wounded. The white savages then chopped in pieces their victims, and threw them, some yet living, on a large fire ; a detachment of the stockmen remaining for several days on the spot to complete the destruction of the bodies. In this case the law was sternly vindicated ; for the murderers having been arrested and brought to trial, seven of them expiated their offences on the scaffold in one day. This wholesale execution of white men for the murder of blacks, at a time when hanging had become an unfrequent event, caused a great commotion among the white population, high and low \u2014 \"judicial murder \" being one of the mildest terms applied to the transaction. There certainly may be two opinions upon it, and therefore, as Lord Norbury remarked whilst adjudicating a similar case, \" I think we had better drop the subject ! \" In England we are unaccustomed of late to see or hear of our fellow-countrymen being hung up by half dozens ; but in New South Wales, some such in ter rorem exhibition of the law's extreme power may be occasionally necessary, or rather may have been so, when two-thirds of the population were convicted felons, and one-half of the other third unscrupulous adventurers. It is quite true that the residents of the cities and"], [240, "234 OUR ANTIPODES. settled districts are not in a situation to judge fairly of the amount of provocation endured by those living in constant juxtaposition with fierce and treacherous bar- barians. It is our next-door neighbour, the figurative paries pro\u00e6imus of the Latin poet, with whom we are always at such desperate loggerheads. But gentlemen of condition and education, such as many of the stock proprietors, while repelling with sufficient determination aboriginal aggression, might exert themselves more than is done to prevent sweeping and indiscriminate retalia- tion by their subalterns and servants. More than once I was no less shocked than surprised at hearing men of station and cultivation advocating a precisely opposite course ; and, on one occasion, when a fiery young gentleman of the interior boasted before me that he would shoot a black fellow wherever he met him as he would a mad dog, I thought it a very ordinary Chris- tian duty to inform the head of the Executive of the existence of a professor of such uncompromising tenets. In the distant provinces of the colony collisions be tween the races have always been of frequent occurrence \u2014 were so up to the day on which I left it ; and doubtless will prevail whenever a new tract is entered upon by the settlers, and wild tribes are encountered. Naturam ewpellas fired \u2014 you may drive back the native with the bayonet, but the savage, degraded as he may be, will fight for his hunting-grounds ; and the Anglo-Saxon in his destined progress to possess the land, to have the heathen for his inheritance, will march over his body, or make him his bondsman. The best we can"], [241, "235 ABORIGINAL LABOURERS FOR HIRE. hope for the poor blackeys is, that in time they may be come voluntary labourers for hire, and thus gradually be brought to prefer some steady calling to their old, com fortless, and wandering habits. But it is not to be expected that they will abandon their free, though pre carious mode of life, for one of hard and earnest toil unless for a tolerable equivalent. I have found colonists condemning the race as hope less in the way of labour, because some of them had deserted in the midst of the harvest after a few days' work. On inquiry, however, I heard that a meagre meal of broken victuals, or some article of cast off cloth ing, was the highest amount of remuneration bestowed on a stout aud active black, while the white prisoner by his side in the hay-field was receiving a guinea a- week and regular rations. Some instances there have been of the successful employment of the natives, espe cially in pastoral pursuits, and they are fast increasing in number. If the haughty Red-man can bend to work for wages alongside the negro in the cotton-field \u2014 and such I believe has happened \u2014 the simple though wild Australian may surely be induced to labour with the European. In the Port Phillip district they have been thus employed to a considerable extent for four or five years. A correspondent of the Sydney \" Morning Herald,\" in November 1850, mentions that, in a district where the blacks have always hitherto been most troublesome, \" the once dreaded Macintyre country,\" where scores of Englishmen have been murdered, and where stock has been destroyed, or harried to such an extent, \" that"], [242, "236 OUR ANTIPODES. not only most of the first proprietors, but many of the second and third owners were ruined,\" the blacks are now admitted into all the stations, acting generally throughout the district as stockmen, and supplying all the extra hands at lambing and sheep-washing times. At one station they have charge of 6,000 sheep. Two or three days after the Corobbery before de scribed, I saw the tribe, with their lubras and children, taking their way to some distant camping-place. The old chief collected his people by a loud \" cooee,\" the well-known peculiar cry of the race ; and tossing his huge arm to me by way of adieu, strode down the hill, followed by the rest in Indian file, a \" formation \" well adapted for threading the bush. The men erect, bear ing only their weapons, the women cowering under heavy loads, they entered the scrub and were soon out of sight. In less than a month later we heard with regret that the stout old leader and six of his band had been killed in a treacherous attack by a hostile tribe, the latter having the advantage of fire-arms, shamefully supplied to them, as was reported, by white people, for the bloody and e_xpress purpose. The experiment of enrolling as a border force a native mounted police, with British officers, has perfectly succeeded. In 1850, the division stationed on the Macintyre river consisted of forty-four men, with a commandant, two subalterns, and a sergeant-major.

In the Port Phillip district a similar force has been raised. There is no want of recruits, nor need of \" bounty.\" The only difficulty is to choose among the herd of long-legged, shock-headed, grinning fellows, offering themselves \" to plenty fight\" for Sd. per diem! They have no qualms about acting with the utmost rigour against their brother black-fellows. Such is the terror of their name, that wheresoever a section of the force shows itself the evil-minded tribes instantly dis appear. Nor are rangers of the bush, fairer in skin but equally dark in deeds, less afraid of these active, vigilant, and dashing black Hulans. Shepherds and stockmen no longer fear to quit their huts, and gentlemen graziers may now ride from station to station without arming themselves like an ambulant arsenal. For bush duties, especially against their own countrymen, the native police is infinitely more effective than the English police. Indeed, with the latter force there are always a few blacks employed as \" trackers.\" \"Tame\" blacks have been known, even when uncon nected with the constabulary, to capture, single-handed, English bush-rangers, for the sake of the reward. How ever juperior in bodily strength, however desperate his courage, the robber has no chance against the black scout unless possessed of fire arms. The latter attacks him with a running fire of stones, thrown with such vigour and accuracy, that a few minutes would suffice to cut to pieces or disable the former.

An instance was related to me of a native following for days, unsus pectedly, the steps of a runaway prisoner armed with a musket. Having exhausted the little food he had brought with him, the white man was at length com pelled by hunger to fire at a bird, and, ere he could re-load, he was felled by a stone, followed by a sustained volley \u2014 something like that of Perkins's steam-gun \u2014 which soon placed both mau and musket in the power of the wily savage. In his purely natural state the New Hollander is little better than a wild beast. Indeed, he may be said to be tip beast of prey of his native land. Strong, agile, fierce, voracious, crafty, his eye and hand are always ready for a victim. His reason, such as it is, serves the purpose of the tiger's instinct, and has scarcely a higher office to fulfil. Compared, moreover, with the innocent denizens of the Australian bush, he possesses the supe rior bodily strength of that tyrant of the Indian jungle. Yet, low in the scale of humanity as is the grade of the savage, I agree with those who believe the assumption unfair that he is incapable of attaining the same standard of intelligence as the European. No really effectual and properly sustained plan for his amelioration has as yet been extended to him. Efforts, prodigal indeed in zeal and money, have been made to civilize and Christianise him, but they have hitherto met with signal failure.

It is never very difficult to make what may be vulgarly styled \"blanket and soup\" proselytes among a starving people ; and accordingly the worthy and simple ministers of the Apsley Mission* had at first a tolerable attendance at their schoolroom and re fectory. In 1838 there were from fifty to eighty natives resident and supported at the mission. Many took kindly to the various departments of labour \u2014 tending cattle, thrashing corn, carrying wood and water, gardening, &c. The children were docile and promising ; and sanguine hopes of eventual success in the good work were entertained. But the Principle of Evil sat not idly by. A hundred stumbling-blocks arose in the path upon which these poor people had but entered. Police, convict, and other civil and private establishments grew up around the Mission house. Attracted by the rich soil of the Wellington Valley, settlers, with troops of prisoner-servants, located them selves in the vicinity. It soon became anything but a quiet retreat for the Christians elect. Drunkenness was introduced by sly-grog-sellers ; the females were seduced away by the Europeans, and were ashamed to return ; the black scholars were encouraged to deride their teachers and the things taught. Many learned merely by rote, but all enjoyed the good feeding ; the words Missionary and Commissary were synonymous terms with them. * Wellington Valley."], [247, "THE \" C00-EE \" OF RECALL. 241 Just when these zealous pastors had begun to con gratulate themselves that they had subdued to the fold a remnant of these lost black sheep, a body of wild natives would arrive, and camp beside the walls, and next day both the newly arrived and a batch of half converts had disappeared together. I can picture to my self the mortification of the good teachers, as the wild Coo-ee of the savages, reclaiming their kindred, rang through the forest, and, obedient to the call, the half tamed pupils, with flashing eyes and answering cry, tore off their garments \u2014 symbols of incipient civilization \u2014 and, once more naked, rushed into their native wilds. \" Give me again my hollow tree, My kangaroo and liberty !\" was their exclamation, as these children of the bush, tired of boiled mutton, turnips, potatoes, and tea, and the twaddle (as they thought it) of their teachers, re lapsed into their natural state of savagehood. Dissensions arose at length among the Missionaries themselves. One departed in disgust from the esta blishment. So disheartened was the other by the small progress attending his labours, that in 1842, nine years and upwards after the first institution of the Mission, he opened his Annual Report as follows : \u2014 \" If the work of civflizing and Christianising a savage race was depend ant merely on human efforts .... then I candidly confess that I should be ready to despair of the Abori ginal inhabitants of the country ever being raised from their degraded condition, since so little success has hitherto attended this Mission, as well as other similar VOL.

Amongst all those young men who for years past have been more or less attached to the Mission, there is only one who affords some satisfaction and encouragement.\" In December, 1849, the Bishop of Sydney visited the private establishment of the Rev. Mr. Watson \u2014 the seceded minister from the Wellington Mission \u2014 on the banks of the Macquarie River, \" where,\" as his Lord ship writes, \" the work of the Evangelists is supported by himself and Mrs. Watson, without the aid of any other person, and at an expense which, without extreme economy and careful management, it would not be in their power to maintain.\" On the occasion of this visit the good prelate admitted to confirmation one adult individual of \" this painfully neglected and forsaken race,\" as he too truly designates them. At the Moreton Bay Missionary Establishment, the station was plundered by the blacks whom it was in tended to benefit, and the ungrateful barbarians were proceeding to fire the buildings, when the much-endur ing Missionaries had recourse to the secular arm, giving their riotous acolytes a hearty peppering with small shot, \u2014 a fulmination of the Church intelligible to the mean est and most savage capacity, and well worth all the anathemas in the catalogue. Past endeavours to better the condition of the Aus tralian native have, then, it appears, been abortive or nearly so. But fresh and more vigorous efforts are to arise out of the Meeting and Conference of the Metro politan and Suffragan Bishops of Australasia, which took place at Sydney in October, 1850, when a plan for"], [249, "THE BRITISH SAVAGE AND UNCIVILIZED. 243 a Board of Missions was matured, having for its ob jects, \u2014 \" First, the conversion and civilization of the Australian blacks ; second, the conversion and civi lization of the heathen races in all the Islands of the Western Pacific.\" So eloquently and so forcibly did these right reverend prelates plead the cause of \" the benighted \" in the pulpits and public meetings of Sydney, and other places, that very considerable sums were collected on the spot, and many leading gentlemen enlisted themselves heartily in the good cause. A voluntary subscription, too, was entered upon, to purchase and equip a vessel for the Bishop of New Zealand, larger and safer than the little 204on cockle-shell in which this well-styled \" Apostle of the Pacific\" has been hitherto accustomed to tra verse the 30 or 40 degrees of ocean comprised within his wild diocese. In his next visit to the savage islanders, Dr. Selwyn is to be accompanied by his old college friend, Bishop Tyrrell of Newcastle. The godly enterprise, resumed under such auspices, will not again falter. History has no precedent of sudden civilization. When Britain was known only as the Tin Islands, the Ph\u0153nicians, trading with them for that metal, probably considered the wild inhabitants as incurably barbarous, \u2014 only fit to \" stump up the tin\" in exchange for such gewgaws as the savage loveth.

Yet our Christianism is nearly as old as the Era, and as to our civilization, perhaps our Gallic neighbours will cede us the second place among nations. Certainly we have, more liberally than they, disseminated our share of that acquisition among other races. The great body of the colonists of New South Wales have so long sat down under the convenient creed that the conversion of the blacks is past hope, that they appeared absolutely astonished, and not a little moved, by the sanguine anticipations indulged in by the several bishops, but especially by Dr. Selwyn. I was amongst the hearers of a sermon from the lips of that ear nest and highly eloquent man, which at once filled the hearts of his audience with confidence, their eyes with tears, and emptied their pockets of their contents. As for the ladies, sweet souls, they are always some what epicures in preachers ! People talk of \" forty parson power ; \" and it will readily be believed that the simultaneous action upon their sympathies by six bishops, all ardent in the cause, left them but little pin money for the ensuing Christmas. Among the various arguments adduced on this occasion by churchmen and laymen, there was none that struck me more forcibly than the following remark by the Speaker of the legislative council, at one of the Missionary meetings : \u2014"], [251, "245 OUR DUTIES TOWARDS THE ABORIGINES. \" Having possessed the lands, having taken from the original occupants the hunting-grounds which once belonged to them, we have made these ignorant savages amenable to our laws.

If these tribes are to be made amenable to the Christian code, let them at least be made aware of the duties for which they are responsible. Whatever difficulties may interfere, it is therefore our duty to persevere in constant endeavours to enlighten and convert this people.\" Here is a self-evident truism ; but, like all truths, it remained at the bottom of the well until dragged into light by some one more addicted to ponder questions of moral polity than is common in a society involved in more substantial matters. There are light and shade in every picture ; and I do not know that anything could more forcibly portray the extremes of character in the Australian black than the incidents accompanying the death of the lamented Mr. Kennedy in the year 1848.

It may be only necessary for me to premise, that Mr. Assistant-Surveyor Kennedy started from Sydney on the 28th April, 1848, for the exploration of the country lying between Rockingham Bay and Cape York, the N. E. extremity of New Holland. He was accom panied by eleven white persons and Jacky the black. His stock consisted of one hundred sheep, twenty-eight horses, and three dogs. Obstructed by impassable scrubs and swamps, by disease, famine, and hostile savages, on the 10th of November Mr. Kennedy, with three of the strongest Englishmen and the black, formed an advance party, in order by forced marches to attempt to reach Cape York, where he expected"], [253, "247 THE DEATH OF KENNEDY. to find H.

A little further U\"rth we crossed the river. Mr. Kennedy aud the rest of us went on a very high hill, and came to a fiat on the other side, and encamped there. Next morning a lot of natives camped on the other side of the river. I wont on a good way next day ; a horse fell down a creek; the flour we took with us lasted three days. We had much trouble in gettiug the horse out of the creek. We went, and came out, and camped on the ridges : we had no water. Next morning went on, and Lull' was taken ill with a very bad knee ; we left him behind, and Dunn went back again and brought hiiu on. Then we went on and camped at a little creek : the flour being out on this day, we commenced eating horse-flesh, which Carron gave us when we left Weymouth Bay ; as we went on we came to a small river, and saw no blacks there. As we proceeded we gathered nondas, and lived upon them and the meat. We stopped at a little creek, and it came on raining, and Costigan shot himself ; in putting his saddle under the tarpaulin a string caught the trigger, and the ball went in under the right arm and came out at his back. We went on this morning all of us, aud stopped at another Meek in the evening, and the next day we killed a horse named ' Browney,' smoked him that night, and went on next day, taking as much of the horse as we could with us, and then turned back to where we killed the horse because Costigan was very bad and in much pain. We went back again because there was water there. Then Mr. Kennedy and I had dinner there, and went on in the afternoon, leaving Dunn, Costigan, and Luff at the creek. This was near Shelbourne Bay. We left some horse-meat with the three men, and carried some with us on a pack-horse. If Costigan died, Luff and Dunn were to come along the beach until they saw the ship, and then to fire a gun. They stopped to take care of the man who was shot. We killed a horse for them before we came away. Having lust these three men, wo camped that night where there was no water. Next morning Mr. Kennedy and me went on with the four horses, two pack borses and two saddle-horses. One horse got bogged in a swamp; we tried to get him out all day, but could not, so we left him, and camped at another creek. \" The next day Mr. Kennedy and I went on again, and passed up a ridge very scrubby, and had to turn back again, and went along gulleys"], [254, "248 OUR ANTIPODES.

Mr. Carron and a man named Goddard were within an hour or two of inevitable death, when the master of a small vessel despatched by Government with to get clear of the creek and scrub. Now it rained, and we camped. There were plenty of blacks here, but we did not see them, but plenty of fresh tracks, and camps, and smoke. Next morning we went and camped at another creek, and the following evening close to a scrub, but we could not get through. I cut and cleared away, and it was near sun down before we got through the scrub ; there we camped. It was heavy rain next morning, and we went on in the rain, aud I changed horses, and rode a black colt to spell* the other .... and the horse fell down, me and all, aud the horse lay upon my right hip. Mr. Kennedy got off his horse, and moved my horse from my thigh; we stopped there all night, and could not get the horse up. We looked to him in the morning, and he was dead. We had some horse-meat left, and went on that day, and crossed a little river and camped. \" The next day Mr. Kennedy told me to go up a tree to see a sandy hill somewhere. I went up, and saw a sandy hill a little way from Port Albany. The next day we camped near a swamp. It was a very rainy day. The next morning we went on, and Mr. Kennedy told me we should get round to Port Albany in a day. We travelled on till twelve o'clock, and then we saw Port Albany. Then he said, ' There is Port Albany, Jacky ; a ship is there. You see that island there,' pointing to Albany Island. This was when we were at the month of Escape River. We slopped there a little while. All the meat was gone. I tried to get some fish, but could not. We went on in the afternoon half a mile along the river side, and met a good lot of blacks, and we camped. The blacks all cried out ' Powad \u2014 Powad,' and rubbed their bellies ; and we thought they were friendly, and Mr. Kennedy gave them fish-hooks all round. Every one asked me if I had anything to give, and I said, No ; and Mr. Kennedy said, ' Give them your knife, Jacky.' This fellow on board was the man I gave the knife to ; I am sure of it, I know him well. The black that was shot in the canoe was the most active in urging all the others on to spear Mr. Kennedy. I gave the man my knife. We went on this day, and I looked behind, and they were getting up their spears, and ran all round the camp we had left.

I said, * I know those black fellows very well. They too much speak.' We went on two or three miles and camped. I and Mr. Kennedy watched them that night, taking it in turns every hour all that night. By-and-by I saw the black fellows; it was a moonlight night ; and I walked up to Mr. Kennedy, and said, ' There is plenty of black fellows now.' This was in the middle of the night. Mr. Kennedy told me to get my gun ready. The blacks did not know where we slept, for we made no fire. We both sat up all night. After this daylight came, and I fetched the horses, and saddled them ; then we went on a good way up the river, find then we sat down a little while, and we saw three black fellows coming along our track, and they saw us, and one fellow run back as hard as he could run, and fetched up plenty more, like a flock of sheep almost. I told Mr. Kennedy to put the saddles on the two horses and to go on ; and the blacks came up, and they followed us all day, and all along it was raining ; and I now told him to leave the horses and come on without them, that the horses make too much track. Mr. Ken nedy was too weak, and would not leave the horses. We went on this day till towards evening, raining hard, and the blacks followed us all the day, some behind, some planted before ; in fact, blacks all around and following us. Now we went into a little bit of a scrub, and I told Mr. Kennedy to look behind always. Sometimes he would do so, and sometimes he would not look behind to look out for the blacks. Then a good many black fellows came behind in the scrub, and threw plenty of spears, and hit Mr. Kennedy in the back first. Mr. Kennedy said to me, * Oh, Jacky, Jacky, shoot 'em ! shoot 'em ! ' Then I pulled ont my gun, and hit one fellow over the face with buck-shot. He tumbled down, and got up again and again, and wheeled right round, and two black fellows picked him up and carried him away. They went away then a little way, and came back again, throwing spears all round more than they did before \u2014 very large spears. I pulled out the spear at once from Mr. Kennedy's back, and cut out the jag with his kuife. Then Mr. Kennedy got his gun and snapped, but it would not go off.

There were large jags to the spears, and I cut them out; and put them into my pocket. At the same time we got speared the horses got speared too, and bucked about and got into the swamp. I now told Mr. Kennedy to sit down while I looked after the saddle-bags, which I did, and when I came back again I saw blacks along with Mr. Kennedy. I then asked him if he saw the blacks with him ; he was stupid with the spear wounds, and said, ' No ;' then I asked him where was his watch ? I saw the blacks taking away his watch and hat as I was returning to Mr. Kennedy ; then I carried Mr. Kennedy into the scrub : he said, ' Don't carry me a good way.' Then Mr. Kennedy looked this way, very bad\u2014 (Jacky rolling his eyes). I said to him, ' Don't look far away,' as I thought he would be frightened. I asked him often, ' Are you well now?' and he said, ' I don't care for the spear wound in my leg, Jacky, but for the other two spear wounds in my side and back,' and said, ' I am bad inside, Jacky.'

On the following morning I went a good way, went round a great swamp and mangroves, and got a good way by sundown. The next morning I went and saw a very large track of black fellows ; I went clear of the track and of swamp or sandy ground ; then I came to a very large river and a large lagoon, plenty of alligators in the lagoon, about ten miles from Albany. I now got into the ridges by sundown, and went up a tree, and saw Albany Island ; then next morning, at four o'clock, I went on as hard as I could go all the way down, over fine clear ground, fine iron-bark timber, and plenty of good grass. I went on round the point ; this was towards Cape York. I knew it was Cape York, because the sand did not go on further. I sat down then a good while ; I said to myself, this is Port Albany, I believe, inside somewhere. Mr. Kennedy also told me that the ship was inside, close up to the inaiu land.

The young men looked tanned and weather-worn. rather thin perhaps, but strong and active \u2014 their bronzed throats and hands appearing uneasy in straw-coloured kid and starched white muslin. As some amends for its want of lakes and rivers, Australia has, at any rate, none of the sallow and agueish faces and shaky forms the traveller meets at every step on the fertile banks of the Hooghly and the Mississippi. Even the mangrove swamps \u2014 nests of miasma elsewhere \u2014 exhale no noxious vapours in New South Wales. There is no society, however limited, without its ex quisite.

The mode of life and the business of a thriving stock proprietor, or squatter, one who has funds to fall back upon in case of reverses, must be highly agreeable, exciting and healthful. But the prosperity of the ordi nary stock-farmer, who has embarked all his capital in one venture, must be precarious in the extreme. One or two seasons of drought, or even of flood, one or two epidemics of \" scab\" or catarrh,\" and the grazing settler is settled indeed !

There is in this country no artificial or stored-up food for winter or bad seasons, as in Europe. The weal of the grazing interests, and indeed that of the colony, depends wholly on the natural grasses of the soil. When these fail, it is certainly better to convert flocks and herds into tallow, than to let them die and rot on the ground. There are now \"boiling down establishments\" in most of the pasturing districts. Panics arising among the squatters from any of the above-named causes give them plenty of work.

Bell having taken the above establishment, will be prepared to make arrangements for rendering down stock, during the ensuing season, at the following prices : \u2014 \" Cattle \u2014 Five shilling and sixpence per head. \" Sheep\u2014 Sixpence each.\" The process of boiling down, or as the proprietor of the above establishment more daintily styles it, rendering down, is thus shortly described by a late writer. The stock are shot, flayed, hung up, quartered, chopped in pieces, and thrown into huge iron vats, licensed to carry sixteen to twenty-four oxen, or three times as many sheep, at once. In these the fat is boiled out, skimmed into buckets, poured thence into casks, which, after being headed up and branded, are shipped for England. The fleshy fibre is thrown to the dogs or used as manure. It ought to be so used, but unfortunately not only are the legs and feet parboiled for pig's food, but these animals are permitted to devour and fatten on the offal. The lover of pork in New South Wales should never partake of that meat unless he knows the birth, parentage, and education of the pig producing it. These cannibal swine are truly disgusting beasts \u2014 mangy, half savage, horrible to think of as human food. Surplus stock, or the increase which overstocks the pastures, is often summarily disposed of through the medium of the melting-pot.

In the year 1846 I find there were boiled down about 40,500 sheep, and 10,400 cattle. In 1849, no less than 743,000 sheep and 45,000 cattle were thus sacri ficed, producing 160,000 cwt. of tallow. In 1851, the tables furnished by the Colonial Secretary make the amount of tallow for the previous year 217,000 cwt. and upwards, valued at 300,000/. This is a singular statistic of a country whose entire popu lation is much below that of the English county of Northumberland and that of the towns of Dublin or Manchester. It is a subject of painful reflection, too often dwelt on to need repetition, that British subjects in one part of her Majesty's dominions should be driven by necessity thus to waste the food that was given for the sustenance of man, and which might have saved a million from starvation in other parts of the same kingdom. In 1847 a member of the Legislative Council stated in his place that in that year there would probably be destroyed 64,000,000 pounds of meat by this process ! Far from the turmoil and distraction of the city, the tra-montane settlers live in peace and plenty \u2014 he who has a large family, cheaper than in any other part of the world; for meat is nothing in price when mutton is merely the soil on which wool is grown ; grain, vege tables and fruit are plentiful ; game, from the bustard to the quail, and the best of fish, the fresh-water cod, are to be had for the shooting and netting. The colony will r 2"], [266, "260 OUR ANTIPODES. soon be tolerably independent of European wines. The soil and climate are peculiarly suited to the vine, for it thrives under a degree of drought fatal to other crops. The wines of this country have got a bad name by having been prematurely offered to the public taste, and they have therefore been deservedly condemned. I never met with any that I liked, except those made by the Messrs. Macarthur of Camden, where two excel lent kinds appeared at table, \u2014 a sauterne very cordial and pleasant ; and a muscat wine not unlike Malmsey Madeira. After a few more years of experience in the facture and treatment of wine, very palatable kinds will doubt less be extensively produced ; and, as they can be sold cheap, they will become for the working classes an infinitely better drink than the highly-drugged colonial beer. Wine-producing nations are always, it is said, more given to sobriety than those drinking malted liquors. During the last year of my residence in Sydney, 1 was never without a supply of \" Camden \" wine in my cellar, and deliberately preferred it to. such Rhenish wines as reach the Sydney market. Mr. E. Cox, of Mulgoa, has a good wine from the Verdeilho grape, the whole of which is consumed on the estate \u2014 his people at the grazing stations purchasing it of him at 6s. a gallon, and preferring it very much to any liquor they can get at the public-houses. On the whole, I consider the Australian wine both wholesome and exhilarating.

Perhaps some good specimens may have found their way to the Great Exhibition of 1851. I have no doubt, that not only will the Australians produce some day excellent wines, both red and white, but that they will grow their own tobacco and olive oil, silk, cotton, and flax. A scene highly entertaining to a stranger, especially if he be a lover of that noble animal the horse, is the driving in from their pastures of \" a mob \" of young horses for examination and selection. This scene we enjoyed to perfection at Macquarie Plains. Two or three mounted stockmen had started by daybreak to hunt up the number required. About 10 o'clock the sound of the stock-whip \u2014 an awful implement, having twelve or fourteen feet of heavy thong to two feet of handle, and crackable only by a practised hand, \u2014 accompanied by loud shouts, and a rushing mighty noise like the Stampedo of the South American Prairies, announced the coming of the steeds. They came sweeping round the garden fence at full speed, shrouded in a whirlwind of dust ; and in a few minutes, snorting, kicking and fighting, about one hundred and fifty horses were driven within the stock yard, \u2014 a wide enclosure surrounded by stout railings seven or eight feet high. The highest leaps I ever saw, were taken on this occasion by some of the wild young colts, in their attempts to evade the halter for closer examination. Seven or eight feet of iron-bark rails were not too much for their courage, or rather their terror, and more than one heavy, perhaps ruinous fall was the result."], [268, "262 OUR ANTIPODES. Nothing could be more roughly nor worse managed. The poor colts' resistance was foolish, because it gained them at most a few minutes' liberty, man's supremacy being very quickly and strenuously asserted. The stockman's system was foolish, because cruel, dangerous and unnecessary. But time and labour are too precious in New South Wales to be thrown away on the amenities of horse management. The poor brute is broken by force in a few days, \u2014 broken in spirit if he be naturally gentle, made a \" buckjumper\" for life, if bad tempered. He is haudled, lunged, backed, tamed, and turned out again \u2014 \" a made horse \" \u2014 in the shortest possible time. The purchaser who takes him as such had better lay in a stock of cobbler's wax, before he assumes the pigskin ! That expedient of the idle and unskilful rider, the martingale, is seen on every horse in the provinces, and is the cause of many a broken knee, and probably of not a few broken necks. One of the stockmen at Mr. Lawson's, a limping, crooked little old fellow, had hardly a whole bone in his skin from his riskful office of gallop ing down, \" catching up,\" and handling wild colts and cattle, through every kind of rough country on any kind of rough nag. The price demanded sounded, at the first blush, very low, 20/. for the pick of the lot; but that must be a remunerative price to the breeder ; for the horse's food, the natural grass, costs next to nothing, and, as I have hinted, his education is far from elaborate or expensive \u2014 the buyer having often to finish that at his own especial expense. The welbkuown Australian horse-play, called"], [269, "263 BUCKJUMPING. buckjumping, \u2014 the like of which I do not remember seeing in any other part of the world, \u2014 is not only very disagreeable, but extremely dangerous even to the good horseman. To the equestrian \" tailor\" it is inevitable prostration. The cross-roads just opposite my eventual residence in the suburb of Darliughurst, was quite an established field of battle between horse and rider. Often have I watched with amusement, sometimes with anxiety\" the obstinate struggle of man and beast at this spot \u2014 where two or three roads lead away to different stables, paddocks, mangers, corn and fresh water; while one only points to deep sand, salt water and the South Head. When every other branch of equine argument failed, buckjumping frequently proved convincing ; and the dis creet cavalier, after ascertaining to his satisfaction that he was not observed, was seen from my look-out post to return to the place from whence he came, yielding with a bad grace and a profusion of kicks and cuffs his inten tion of a constitutional canter into the country or on the sands of Rose Bay \u2014 Rose Bay, whose sands have received the imprint of many a horseman's length, and nave, alas ! been the mould of softer and rounder forms \u2014 as I can personally testify.

Some very successful ventures have been made, although others indeed have proved dead failures. One great breeder told me that, a few years back, he sent two batches of horses to Calcutta, amounting in all to forty-five. On one batch he got a clear average profit of 60/., and on the other 50/. a-head.

The consequence of this absurdly low figure is, that the best stock is seldom sent to Sydney by the distant breeders. In the far inland districts, I saw many fine horses, from seven to eight years old, that had never been backed, because the expense of breaking and travelling to a market would have swallowed up all profit.

Passing through the town of Bathurst, we came upon a fine undulating, lightly wooded, and tolerably well grassed country. The upland soil seemed to be generally poor in quality, but the lowlands fertile, being much subject to inundation. The apple-tree and the box, mingling with the common gum, added a little variety to the monotonous character of the bush. The former tree has no right to its name. It bears no fruit, nor has it any resemblance to any pomiferous plant in Europe, that I am acquainted with. The pear-tree of the Australian forest has a better excuse for its title, its fruit having much of the external appearance of a large green jargonelle, but being, in fact, only the shell, hard as lignum vit\u00e6, of the seed, which, in ripening and splitting, it drops to the ground. The box-tree rejoices also in an extravagant misnomer. It is as tall as any of the bush. The apple-tree is very orna mental, its sturdy stem, twisted boughs, and dentated foliage, giving it a distant likeness to the British oak. The road we took was a mere bush track ; but the wheels ran lightly on the glittering granite soil, and tolerably smoothly, except when we fell among rocks on the crest of some ridge, or, in avoiding them, got upon a \"sidling\" on the slope of the hill. This \" sidling,\" which resembles the \"slewing\" of the Canadian sleigh, is very unpleasant, tiring to the horses, and even highly dangerous ; for sidling towards a stump, a rock, a ditch, or a precipice, may cause an upset, with a corre spondent degree of injury to the equipage and its occu pants. To start off at full speed, and thus to get the"], [273, "267 J0URNE. TO COQMBING. wheels to \"bite\" again, is the only way to redeem an incipient sidling. In a country more liberally endowed with water our drive of to-day might have been considered beautiful ; but the dire want of that element is as fatal to the picturesque as it is, in this colony, to animal and vegetable life. There being no convenient half-way house, we made a mid-day halt at a spot called the \" White Rocks,\" a cluster of quartz crags in the very savagest part of the wilderness, holding out no parti cular temptation to the traveller, beyond a meagre runlet of clear water, which gave us the means of preparing grog, and, about a hundred yards down the ravine, a muddy water-hole, hardly solvent enough to meet the somewhat exorbitant draughts of nearly a dozen horses. The picnic basket was, however, unpacked, the lunch spread, \" sub tegmine gum-tree.\" The servants and mounted policemen led away the horses to the pool, and, in spite of the heat of an Australian summer day, we enjoyed extremely our sylvan repast and a temporary release from the joltings of the carriages. Four years later, travelling without a guide and with my family in this same direction, the horses almost knocked up, the weaker ones of the party tired, hungry and parched with thirst, I recognised and called a halt at this same place. Some chips of the inner bark of a tree, a fallen log, and a lucifer match soon procured us a fire wherewith to make our tea ; our stores were displayed ; my wife was charmed with my cleverness in finding this somewhat featureless halting-place."], [274, "268 OUR ANTIPODES. I hastened away with a jug, and with a complacent feeling of self-respect, to the runlet, \u2014 it was dry ! I followed my organ of locality doWu to the muddy water hole \u2014 not a drop ! not even mud. A bell tinkled through the trees, it was the bell of a bullock, walking loose before a dray drawn by ten others. One of the drivers, begrimed with dust and sweat, came hurrying down towards me, and I fear I derived some comfort from the blank dismay with which he eyed the patch of cracked clay, all that now remained of this diamond of the desert. The poor jaded bullocks turned their patient heads in vain to the well-known drinking- place ; the disappointed drayman, swearing two or three fearful oaths, looked very much as if he would have liked to pick a quarrel with me ; but, turning his wrath upon his wretched team, he brought down a hail of blows upon their scarred flanks, and they passed on, the tinkling of the bell, the cracking of the long whip, and the objurgations of the reasoning animal growing fainter and fainter, until they were lost in distance. Luckily in our case we had with us some wine and a bottle of milk, so that neither adults nor infant died of thirst, but the poor horses were compelled to proceed un refreshed. Such is a common event in Australian travel. The vice-regal party was, as has been seen, more fortunate in regard to water. The last six miles of a new road into Carcoar had just been marked out, and partially made by the inhabitants, expressly for the Governor. It was a well-chosen but rough track, desig nated by blazed trees on either hand, the unbarked"], [275, "269 A CHAIN OF PONDS. parts being painted white in order to be more manifest in the dusk. After a long and latterly steep descent through a densely wooded and hilly country, we sud denly dropped down upon the little snug-looking village of Carcoar, seated on the banks of a river in a hollow vale. In giving a geographical and a literal description of this rive?, it would be incorrect to say that it runs through the town. On occasions of inordinate rains it may form a continuous stream. At present, and in genera], it constitutes what is well known in Australia as \" a chain of ponds,\" the periodical predicament of most of the rivers of this land of drought; except indeed when the water disappears altogether.

The lack of water is indeed the bete noire of the colony. It has rendered agriculture, as a general pursuit, except in a few favoured districts, hopeless ; and even pastoral pursuits are precarious where this great essential of life is not a property of the earth, but a thing to be hoped for, and prayed for, and expected from the clouds. This want, too, is more likely to increase than to"], [276, "270 OUR ANTIPODES. diminish, for all the well-watered runs have already been appropriated, and those coming later into the squatting field will have to put up with the pastures avoided by their precursors. The blacks say, \" When white fellow come, water go away.\" The cutting down the trees and the trampling of stock do doubtless produce this effect. It is said, moreover, by geologists, that a gradual upheavement of the Australian continent is laying dry many of its original water-beds and courses. No traveller can fail to remark how greatly favourable is the surface formation of this country for the structure of artificial reservoirs. Wherever, in the different lines of road, a causeway or dam has been thrown across a hollow in lieu of a bridge, there is almost uniformly a considerable collection of water. Yet the farmers and squatters have, with scarcely an exception, been blind to the practical hints given them by the road-makers. I do not remember to have seen an acre of land laid under water by artificial means in New South Wales. But the mere lack of drink for man and beast, and of humidity for grass and grain, are not the only disasters attendant upon drought. The excessive dryness of the herbage, and the fierce hot winds, prepare the earth for those awful bush-fires which \u2014 whether they owe their origin to the flash of the thunder cloud or the spark of the bushman's pipe, or, as some will have it, to the lens offered to the sun by a broken bottle ! \u2014 do yearly ravage vast tracts of land, destroying not only pasturage and agricultural produce, but flocks, herds, homesteads, and even human life."], [277, "LACK OF WATER. 271 \u2022 To the general exploration of the country drought has opposed one of the sternest obstacles. Mr. Eyre, now Lieutenant-Governor in New Zealand, while pro secuting discoveries along the southern coast, found himself in a position where there was no water to be obtained within 150 miles, either by advancing or re treating. In order to recruit his dying horses, he remained several weeks encamped by the little well which he had dug on a damp looking spot, fortunately discovered after many days of fearful distress, during which he had recourse to the dew of heaven for a draught, gathering it in a sponge from off the leaves before sunrise. To this expedient the blacks are often driven, bunches of fine grass supplying the place of a sponge. Perhaps whilst I am revising these notes the gallant Leichart, toiling in the cause of science, may be suffering all the extremities of thirst \u2014 if his bones be not already bleaching in the wilderness 1 I can hardly reconcile the general rule of a bright cloudless sky and a dusty earth with the assertion of the accomplished traveller and philosopher Strzelecki, that \" New South Wales has been shown to receive a larger amount of rain than does Brussels, Berlin, Geneva, York, and lastly London, so celebrated for its humidity.\" If it be true that as much water falls upon this con tinent as upon others, it must fall in larger quantities and at fewer periods, and does not remain on the earth.

In the country the rains tear up courses for themselves on the sides of the hills, and quickly leave them\u2014fer tilizing the valleys alone. The lay of the land is, as has been said, peculiarly favourable for the formation of reservoirs.

The term squatter \u2014 inelegant as it may appear \u2014 is an official term in this colony. But it is applied to a very different class from that to which it belongs in America, whence it is borrowed. The squatter of America is generally a small farmer or labouring man, with as much capital as he can carry in an old stocking, who, wandering beyond the limits of the districts surveyed by Government, aud consequently open to sale, has sat down or squatted on wild land, as the buffalo or moose might do with as great a right and no greater to its occupancy, and no more liable to dis traint for rent, licence, nor assessment than his quad ruped neighbour on the prairie. As the frontier of the State extends, and the surveyor approaches his \" form,\" the squatter either removes to \"fresh diggins,\" or, taking advantage of the right of preemption, pur chases for the fixed price of a dollar and a quarter an acre as much of his original squattage as he may need or can afford to make his own. I have lodged with an American thus situated near the head-waters of the Mississippi. His hut, built of substantial logs cut from the \"oak opening\" or grove on the edge of which he was located, looked over a wide expanse of the rolling prairie as far as eye could range, dotted only with occasional clumps of timber. His herds, therefore, however far dispersed, were still within his ken, and needed no further care than that of himself and his sons. How different from the forest pastures of Australia ' He was but twenty-two miles from a navigable lake communicating with the St. Lawrence \u2014 and the same distance from his market, a small frontier s 2"], [284, "276 OUR ANTIPODES. town containing about 6,000 inhabitants. He and his family, male and female, worked hard with their own hands, fed on tea, Indian corn bread, dairy produce and plain meat ; and were glad to receive remuneration from travellers in return for rough board and lodging, and the use of a light waggon and horses. In seven years from the date of his first founding his station he calculated on being able to lay by enough to buy three or four hun dred acres when his location should come into the market. Such are the squatters of the far west, for the most part : and such were some of the original squatters of this colony. Men of mark and likelihood, \" gentlemen and well derived,\" soon embarked in the lucrative pursuit. The flocks increasing at that wonderful ratio only perhaps known in Australia, the granted lands and those pur chased even at the low rate of five shillings an acre, were unequal to their subsistence. They spread themselves therefore over the country, and their owners followed them either in person or by proxy. Other individuals, who had reasons of their own for preferring a frontier life, got possession of sheep or cattle, and located themselves on the waste lands. Government might have winked at this informal style of occupation in favour of the increase of the stock of the colony thereby caused, had not the wild and lawless life of some of these borderers compelled the higher powers to frame laws for their better government. Judge Lynch was not to be trusted in a country where half the population were convicts, emancipated prisoners of equivocal character, land-jobbers, stock-robbers, and"], [285, "277 CROWN LAND LEASES. idle and ignorant people, who had got possession of large tracts which they either could not or would not improve or cultivate. I fear that retired officers and persons from the \"ranks\" of the army must be enumerated amongst the improvident grantees under Government. It was soon discovered that the system of the free alienation of land by Government was nothing short of \" making ducks and drakes\" of the Crown's most valuable property and most powerful source of influence. Various plans were concocted, and revoked, both for sale and the lease of Crown lands. They resulted at length in the creation of a land fund, to be expended on the introduction of free labour to cultivate that land, and in the licensing of tracts within and beyond the boun daries of location, at small rents, for depasturing purposes, with an assessment on live stock, for the maintenance of a border police and for internal improvements. Let not my reader fear that I am about to inflict even a digest of the Land Regulations upon him. Those now in force, which have of course been compressed into the smallest useful dimensions, form a neat little book of fifty pages \u2014 published \" by authority\" at Sydney in 1848, and doubtless obtainable at the Colo nial Office. For purposes of squatting, the waste lands (a term very improperly and imprudently given to the splendid territorial inheritance held by the Crown as trustee for the public) are divided into three classes \u2014 the Settled, the Intermediate, and the Unsettled districts. In the Settled, the lease is enjoyable for one year only ; in the Intermediate, for eight years ; in the"], [286, "278 OUR ANTIPODES. Unsettled, or ultra-frontier lands, for fourteen years. The rent is 10/. per annum for a \" run\" capable of carrying 4,000 sheep or 640 head of cattle or horses. The runs are not open to purchase during the lease, except by the lessee. On the expiration of a lease it is competent for Government to put up all or any part of the lands for sale, the lessee having the right of pre emption at its fair value, which shall never be less than 1/. per acre. The assessment on stock is 3|_/. for horses, \\\\d. for cattle, \\d. for sheep, per head. At the period of my first excursion to the Bathurst district, the squatters were clamouring for the share of fixity of tenure yielded by these regulations, which enables them to carry on their avocations with a degree of security unpermitted by former enactments. With respect to the purchase of Crown lands, it is enough to state that the upset auction price was raised in 1838 from 5s. to 12s., and again in 1842 to 1/. an acre \u2014 at which figure it now stands. Whether the theory of a high minimum for waste lands be good or bad, is a question hot and heavy to handle, and fortunately no business of mine. It is quite as warmly disputed now as when it was first mooted by Mr. Wakefield. Its avowed chief intentions are to prevent land-jobbing, the accumulation of land in the hands of persons without capital or the means of introducing labour, the undue dispersion of the population, and to exclude the labourer from the possession of land. Its opponents declare that the system makes land dear and scarce instead of plentiful and cheap ; that it discourages small capitalists from immigrating from England, and diverts them to the United States, where"], [287, "279 PRICE OF LAND. freeholds may be purchased, better land, at one-fourth of the price. One of the statistical proofs offered is, that only as many hundreds emigrated to New South Wales in 1845 as thousands in 1842. The alteration is favour able for the squatting interests. With the waste lands at the present price, the leaseholders are little likely to be dispossessed by purchasers. But it cuts two ways ; without land sales there can be no land fund ; without land fund no emigration at the public expense ; with out emigrant-labourers or convicts, the wages of shep herds, stockmen and farin-servants must rise. High wages infer paucity of hands ; paucity of hands causes hasty and careless tending, washing, shearing, and getting up of wool \u2014 and consequent depreciation of the great staple in the European markets. I confess I find it difficult to understand why the half rocky, half sandy, densely wooded, and ill-watered acre of New South Wales is worth four times as much as the deeply alluvial, ready cleared, and well irrigated acre of Wisconsin or Illinois \u2014 the former lying three times the distance from England. It seems to me that if small capitalists were permitted to purchase at a low price as much land as they wanted for culture, the natural bias of man to herd with his kind would induce him to pitch his tabernacle near his neighbour ; give them a church and a bit of common land, and there would soon be a village : no danger of dispersion, and if dispersion be an evil, what so like to cause it as the squatting system? The English reader must understand that the lessees of Crown lands, the squatters, are debarred by law from"], [288, "280 OCR ANTIPODES. cultivating any part of their runs except for the con sumption of their families and establishments. Immense tracts must therefore remain untouched by the plough, and continue to be primeval deserts. The pastoral state, it is but a stale truism to remark, is the first step, a great one certainly, beyond that of the hunting and fishing savage. It implies location, but on somewhat loose terms, and a collection of some few stationary comforts and conveniences ; but the culti vation of the soil, as has been well said, is a condition absolutely necessary to high civilization and to the permanent organization of society. Let no one, however, underrate the value of the pastoral interests as they now stand in New South Wales. In 1850 it was publicly stated by one of the greatest flock-masters and statesmen in the country, and never publicly refuted, that the whole produce of the agricultural interests of the colony, including Poit Phillip, did not exceed 600,000/. a-ye;ir ; while those proceeding from the pastoral interests amounted to 1,500,000/. a-year. I think this speaker further stated that, from his own squatting properties alone, 10,000/. worth of produce yearly passed through the hands of the Sydney merchants. The immense area of this continent, and the exceeding poverty of by far the greater part of the soil, point it out as a country better adapted to grazing than to grain-culture. Less skill and experience are required in the former occupation. The returns are more rapid aud more simple: and besides, there is something fascinating, especially to the Englishman who has been pent up in a"], [289, "281 SQUATTERS AND SQUATTING. single acre of the Old Country, in the feeling that he can count his horses by the hundred, his cattle by the thousand, and his sheep by the tens of thousands ; and can gallop for a week across his territories without touching their confines. That the pursuit is popular is pretty plain. There are squatters of all classes \u2014 high and low, squatters, (and these really deserve the name,) who reside constantly at their stations, never moving to the city except, perhaps, to receive from the merchants the price of their yearly clip of wool, and to load the return drays with stores. There are squatters who drive other trades in the metropolis, leaving their country interests in the hands of resident agents, and who should therefore be rather designated proprietprs of stock than squatters. There are, for instance, physicians picking up their fees in the towns, and carrying on in the country extensive sheep-farming concerns. There are lawyers by dozens, who practise fleecing both in town and country. Half the members of the Legislative Council are squatters. The Speaker squats equally and alternately on the woolsack of the House, and at his wool-stations on the Murrumbidgee. The moment the session is prorogued, honourable members, honourable and gallant members, honourable and learned members, aud for aught I know, the hon ourable and reverend member (for he has tried all trades) hasten away to the bush, and to their flocks and herds, returning in a month or two, sometimes with smiling, at others with long faces \u2014 always with sun-burnt ones."], [290, "282 OUR ANTIPODES. Squatting is a pursuit pliable according to the means, and to the other avocations of those engaging in it. One may squat on a large or on a small scale, squat directly or indirectly, squat in person or by proxy. One may buy stock, borrow stock, hire stock, or take stock on the system of \" thirds,\" in which the working partner gets one third of the wool and of the increase, while the proprietary partner, as he may be called, follows some other profession, or his pleasures, or holds some Government appointment at the capital or elsewhere. Two friends conjoin in a squatting concern, and take it by turns to enjoy \" a spell\" in Europe. Two or three brothers unite their resources, the two younger perhaps conducting the business of the stations, while the elder \u2014 a bit of a dandy\u2014 manages the mercantile and shipping part. When the squatter is a married man and carries with him into the bush the courtesies and amenities of life, his retrogression from a high standard of social polish need not be very visible. But it is pinned on the sleeve of the bachelor squatter. You may know him anywhere. He brings the bush into Sydney with him, like the burr on the fleece. Shy and ungainly, or tigerish and impudent, he prefers the upper boxes of the theatre to the drawing-room, and the company of gamblers, adventurers, and horse-dealers, to that of the more respectable, and what he would probably call the \"slower\" classes. Even those favourable specimens of this class, \u2014 and there are many who are formed to move in the best society, \u2014 are not unapt to relapse into what an old Indian"], [291, "PASTORAL NABOBS. 283 calls jungle habits on their return to the interior from a temporary sojourn at the capital.

Among the poorer of the single men engaged in it, pastoral life in Australia is almost savage life \u2014 the life of the savage without the softening influence of squaw, wyenee, or gin.

Many of them are \" gen tlemen and well derived\"\u2014 Eton and Oxford, Westminster and Cambridge men, who contrived to spare time for the culture cf the mind as well as that of wool, and tallow, \"hides, horns, and hoofs;\" and who maintain their connexion with the higher aspirations of humanity by a constant supply of books, periodical publications, corre-"], [292, "284 OUR ANTIPODES. spondence with Home, as well as by their hospitality extended to persons of other pursuits, who are able to import fresh subjects of discussion to their distant and secluded homesteads. The worst feature of bush-life for family persons must be the difficulty of obtaining education for their children, especially in \" the more elegant branches.\" Perhaps, however, if accomplishments were attainable, the cares and duties of life become so early the lot of young Avomen in this country that they have no time to acquire them. Indeed there are not a few establish ments where a help-mate, in the strict sense of the term, rather than a helpless mate endowed with all the gifts of the muses and graces combined, is the domestic deside ratum. Although it may not require any great amount of in tellect to manage grazing affairs, let no man embark on it heedlessly. The bush, believe me, is no rose-bush; or if it be, it has its thorns, its cares, its fluctuations, its reverses. Nowhere more than in this colony is verified the quaint adage, \u2014 \" Many go out for wool, and come home shorn.\" Sheep-farming has been the ruin of hundreds. But, grown wise through their own and others' misfortunes, the squatters of the present day conduct their concerns with more prudence and foresight than of old ; and the majority of them, I believe and hope, are laying up for themselves, if not very large fortunes, at least certain competence. There are many enemies to the squatter. The rivalry of other wool-growing nations nearer England may be the greatest. Their chief local foes are bush fires and blacks, drought, dingoes and disease."], [293, "285 THE S0J0URNER AND TnE SETTLER, There are other two great classes into which the squattocracy may be divided, those who are but tem porary sojourners in the land \u2014 younger sons or brothers of opulent English families, who have ventured their 10 or 20,000/. in a grazing investment, with the very natural intention of making a good round sum of money \u2014 enough to live \" like a gentleman \" in England \u2014 and of carrying their gains to their still cherished home ; and on the other hand, those bond, fide settlers who, on planting their foot on Australian ground, adopt it as their country, and resolve to invest in it what they win on its soil. No need to say which of the two is the better colonist. It is sometimes, however, not easy to dis tinguish the one from the other. Of course, he who deliberately intends to make of the colony a sponge to wring wealth out of, does not think it necessary to publish his resolution.

November 18/\u00c6. \u2014 Coombing. A lovely morning. I was awakened early by a chattering of parrots, absolutely stunning, and looking forth I found the standard cherry trees thronged with these birds, \u2014 a thousand beautiful and mischievous creatures, frisking among the branches, eating no small quantity of the fruit of these exotic plants, reared with so much trouble, and wantonly de stroying every berry and bud within reach of their strong little beaks. What wonder that the old Scotch gardener strewed the ground, in vain, however, with their painted corpses, as he prowled round the garden with a vengeful face, and a gun as long as himself ! Beyond the garden fence, down on the cultivated land, the fields were covered, as by a snow-drift, with flocks of the large white cockatoo, \u2014 a bird of the strongest anti-protectionist principles on the subject of the Corn Laws. The seed in the ground, the ripening or the"], [295, "287 THE ORGAN-MAGPIE. ripe grain, are \"all fish\" to him. The havoc he commits is immense; and he is so wary, as to preserve his impunity from gun or snare. In delightful contrast with the shrill harsh voices of these two feathered scolds came, from the garden hedge, the full soft note of the organ-magpie \u2014 like the low breathing of the flute-stop of that instrument. Some of the tones are as soft and sad as those of the cushat, but with even more of music in them. When trying after wards to find some likeness for this bird's song, it suddenly struck me that it resembled in some degree the notes of an accordion, or rather a flutina, touched by a timid and uncertain hand, attempting over and over again the first two or three bars of \" Nix my Dolly,\" an air which, unsentimental as are its associa tions, I always thought full of beauty and originality. On my return to England after three years in America, this tune was in possession of the London butcher and pot-boys. My friends, I remember, were much amused when I told them, on the first evening of our reunion, how charmed I had been with a certain song of the streets, and which proved to be no other than Blueskin's popular and vulgar air. There is a sort of ventriloquism in this bird's voice. You may be looking out afar for the instrument of the seemingly distant music, when a note louder than the rest calls your attention nearer home, and you find the songster sitting on a branch within six feet of your head. The organ-magpie, pied crow, or barita, is somewhat larger than the English magpie, with a tail as much shorter as his voice is sweeter."], [296, "288 OUR ANTIPODES. There was another vocal bird that I frequently ob served perched on the topmost branch of some tall tree, with its bill pointed skywards and singing with all its soul in a tone somewhat sharper, but not very unlike the magpie's. This bird appeared to be a kind of woodpecker, at least in shape ; but I never detected him in the act of \" tapping.\" I could not learn his name, so gave him that of Dick Swiveller, because, to my \" fanciful mind,\" he seemed to have that gentleman's habit of indulging in snatches of song, the prevailing ditty sounding like the commencement of Macheath's solo, \" When the heart of a man,\" &c. One of the greatest curiosities of animated nature at this season is the locust, \u2014 the Tetti\u00e6 of Anacreon, \u2014 the Latin Cicada, the very same insect, if I mistake not, whose figure is immortalized in ancient Egyptian sculp ture. When the weather becomes warm the locust, which has been all winter laid up beneath the earth, perforates its surface, and emerges in a full suit of russet armour. Crawling to the nearest tree, he lays fast hold of the bark with his gauntlets, then, squaring his shoulders, he splits the back of his cuirasse, \u2014 and lo ! a gay, bright green, gauze winged and gold spotted denizen of air, \u2014 his subterranean attire left hanging up like a fusty old garment at a Jew's door in Mon mouth-street, or a rusty, battered suit of armour on the walls of an ancestral hall. Not a word is to be said in favour of this creature's voice ; his stridulous notes ring through the air from morning to night, with an effect so distract ing, that one can hardly afford to pity him when one hears him chirping through the closed fingers of the"], [297, "289 SHEARING AND BRANDING.

One species of locust, as is well known, reappears from his earthen retreat only once in seventeen years ; no wonder he makes a noise in the world during his short holiday. We witnessed to-day the several processes of shearing, sorting, packing, and pressing wool. The weather being extremely sultry, it seemed very hard and hot work \u2014 yet some of the best hands contrived to clip 70 sheep in a day. It was curious to observe how rapidly the poor panting, helpless, innocent beast was disrobed of its thick downy fleece, without breaking it, and was then let go naked and astonished back to its pen. It strongly resembled a process I have watched at Don caster, Newmarket, and elsewhere, in which the patient looks equally sheepish after he has been done ! A more unpleasing and cruel operation is the branding of young stock. Every colt and heifer is marked with the initials or other cypher of its owner, burnt on some conspicuous point. On the shoulder of a fine horse it is very disfiguring, yet essentially necessary to prevent theft in a country where the animals, roving over their wide and wooded pastures, are sometimes not seen or heard of for months together. The roars and groans of the suffering juvenci, as they were hauled by ropes into a sort of wooded cage, proved how painful was the sys- tem of impressing upon them their ABC. But brand- ing does not as a matter of course preclude cattle steal ing. The marks are either cut out bodily or altered by rebranding, \u2014 some letters being easily changed to others. VOL. i. t"], [298, "290 OUR ANTIPODES. Among other stockyard sights I was attracted by seeing a lot of men preparing to capture, and as I thought to slaughter out of hand, a remarkable wild cow. She knocked over one of her pursuers, and was making towards myself, who having a gun in my hand was conning the idea of shooting her through the head to save further trouble and expense, when I was quietly informed that they were only going to milk her. It was the most flagitious case of \" violence with intent\" to milk, I had ever met with ! Having lassoed her horns, and induced her to run her head through the rails of the yard, it was quickly belayed there. Her legs were then tied with thongs of \" green hide,\" and the poor mad cow was milked accordingly by main force. Be it known to all dwellers in Cockaigne, that green hide rope, au article used here in various departments georgic and bucolic, is formed of long narrow strips cut from the raw skin of an ox. The epithets \" green \" and \" raw \" are synonymous, as some of my young friends know. In large establishments, like that of our host, where many scores of hands are employed, the proprietor is compelled to keep a store well filled with all the requisites of consumption \u2014 such as slop-clothing, tea, sugar, tobacco, soap, rum, blankets, &c. All those extras not included in the stipulated ration are charged against the consumer at what is considered a fair price ; and I have been assured that masters do not lose by the transaction \u2014 on the contrary, that some of them turn it to good account. Indeed some employers are charged with making too large a profit by this retail business,"], [299, "LACK OF LABOURERS. 291 charging their servants 50 and 100 per cent, for the expense of carriage from Sydney or the nearest market town. Those gentlemen, and they are increasing in number, who make wine on their estates, sell it to their labourers \u2014 a good plan, as it prevents spirit drinking. At Coombing there is a regular office, with clerks, issuers, &c. \u2014 in short, a Commissariat of stores. The scarcity of labour at the present juncture is severely felt by the country residents ; indeed it threatens stagnation and ruin to those who work up to the extent of their capital. In New South Wales all the great annual business of a stock farmer is necessarily crowded into the summer months \u2014 sheep-washing and shearing, hay and grain harvests, operations connected with breeding, &c. \u25a0 so that the pressure for labour falls heavily and at once. No wonder that convicts or any class of able workmen were welcome at Mr. Icely's establishment. Hands clean or dirty must be procured at the present busy time, and during the existing industrial destitution. Our host indeed appears to feel no repugnance to the employment, in any department, of prisoners, or men who have \" served their time.\" This feeling is founded on his own personal experience. During the days of the old system, he had many hundreds of \" Government men\" assigned to his service, and most of them proved excel lent servants. His present butler, a trusty and trusted man, and quite a privileged character, did not expatriate himself voluntarily. Like many capitalists in the earlier days of the colony, Mr. Icely received free grants of land on condition of t 2"], [300, "292 OUR ANTIPODES. employing and maintaining convicts ; and ort the other hand, he entitled himself to a supply of prisoner labour by the extensive purchase of Crowu land. I shall have to descant on the plague of Australian servants in another place. The present tour \u2014 to go a little a head \u2014 afforded us apt illustration, of its excess. The several hospitable geutlemen who received us were naturally anxious to afford the new Governor the best reception in their power ; but wherever we went, almost without exception, the domestic, upon whom depended the well-being of the party, took this particular occasion to get drunk \u2014 and perhaps to quarrel with his master in order to show his independence. To violate still further the chronological order of this journal, I may here remark, that in 1851 matters had but little mended on this head. Really good domestic servants, especially males, were still hardly known ; really bad ones vibrated from pantry to pantry, from coach box to coach box of the Sydney gentry, and smiled impudently in the face of the master who last discharged them \u2014 or whom they had discharged \u2014 well knowing that if they could lay a table or drive a pair of horses, they could always get a place, and no impertinent question asked as to character. It is a regular Doularchy \u2014 a servile tyranny, which nothing but competition, an influx of five hundred or a thousand good house servants can rectify. This very day, as I was busy sketching in the midst of the bush about a mile from the house, I was surprised by a rough voice close to my ear, \u2014 \" Any hands wanted on this 'stablishment ? \" It was a tall ruffianly looking fellow, with his personals wrapped up in an opossum"], [301, "293 A BUSH-HAND A SETTLER OF SUBSTANCE. rug which he carried on his stick, and followed by two as rascally looking dogs. \" What can you do ? \" said I, as if I were the lord of the manor. \" Well, most things,\" replied he, \" split, saw, wash, shear, break horses \u2014 what not.\" \" Go away up to the stores. The overseer will put you on the books, I dare say,\" I rejoined, only anxious to get rid of so unpromising a comrade; and it was so. In a town he would have been arrested on suspicion. In the country and at shearing time he got 11. a-week and full rations, and no questions asked. The great extent of Mr. Icely's concerns render him peculiarly vulnerable to a dearth of labour. The great graziers, and even the wealthiest landed proprietors of the Old Country, may hide their diminished heads when compared with him in point of territory, stock, and numbers of persons employed. This gentleman's estate and live stock are said to consist of 50,000 acres of purchased land \u2014 purchased when the price was 5s. an acre \u2014 how much of granted land, I did not learn ; with of course hundreds of thousands of acres of pasture rented from the Crown ; 25,000 sheep, 3,000 head of cattle, and some 300 horses. Near the dwelling-house is one paddock \u2014 as it is modestly styled \u2014 consisting of 3,000 acres, another of 1,500 acres ; and there are about 45 miles of substantial three-railed fencing on the property. This latter article alone must have cost a small fortune. On one occasion of the reduction of his stock, i.e. the sale of the sur plus above the depasturing capabilities of his runs, Mr. Icely, as I have been informed, sold by auction horses, cattle, and sheep to the amount of 25,000/.; but this"], [302, "294 OUR ANTIPODES. occurred when prices were more than double their pre sent rate. In the afternoon the ladies took a drive, and the gentlemen a ride in the \" park\" \u2014 as it is styled, although to merit the name some portions of it should be cleared and thrown open. The undulating and lightly wooded uplands are very beautiful. They are occasionally diver sified by naturally clear and swampy Savannahs, in which the cattle luxuriated up to their knees in herbage. The pastures of this district are in general pretty abundant \u2014 the forest runs being better grassed than the plains, by reason of the shade afforded from the sun. We saw some very handsome cattle \u2014 two or three Durham bulls, for which the owner had paid large sums \u2014 100/. and 200/. in England, and a few well-bred and clever horses. He has one of the finest Arab sires I ever saw, even in India ; as well as one of first-rate English blood. We were pursued and pestered during our ride by flocks of the large white cockatoo \u2014 one of which, by dint of stratagem, \u2014 the mounted policeman attracting his attention from me by a few curvets \u2014 I contrived to shoot. This bird needs no description. The large shrieking snowy creature with the orange toppin brushed up like Mr. Pecksuiff's, is always to be seen and heard in the aviary of the London Zoological Gardens. Hun dreds of parrots of various sorts, sizes, and hues, darted through the air in flocks, giving us a shrill scream and a flash of brilliant colours as they passed \u2014 or climbed among the gum-tree branches, busily engaged in eating the seeds.

Later in the afternoon too, not being so ardent an admirer of farm-stock as his Excellency, I betook myself to a lucerne field near the house, and in about an hour shot fourteen brace of quad, and could easily have doubled the number. A chain of ponds just outside the park abounds, as I was informed, with that curious animal, the Platipus, alias Ornithorhyncus Paradoxus, alias Water-mole, which latter is perhaps the plainest and most descriptive name. The Platipus is always cited among the inconsis tencies of Australian natural history ; and is very like a large mole, with the head and mandibles of a duck ; \u2014 he is in short a beast with a bill like a Christmas trades man ! The fur is soft and prettily shaded from black to silver-grey. The natives spear and trap them, and they are easily shot by any one liberally endowed with pa tience, perseverance, and immobility of person, and who can shoot straight and sharp just as they rise, bubbling, to the surface of the water. As for myself, I had the best intentions towards themselves and their skins; but the swarms of flies at the water-side acting as their allies tormented my face and eyes so desperately that quiet was out of the question ; and the water-mole is so shy that a fidgety sportsman has no chance with him.

It is common to see two out of three people suffering under this malady, which is caused either by the bite of the insect or by the deposit of its larv\u00e6. Acute inflamma tion and temporary deprivation of sight are the results attending the attacks of this petty creature \u2014 results painful to any one, but disastrous to the working-man. We sometimes met a dozen bullock- drivers in a day more or less affected by this blight \u2014 poor wretched fellows, with large green leaves bound over their eyes, staggering along almost blind, but unwilling to give in.

The evenings at Coombing were passed very agree ably : music and singing were not wanting ; there was plenty of books; and on the table, just as might be in a country house fifty miles from London, lay the last numbers (four or five months old, of course) of the Illus trated London News, Punch, and other periodical publications.

November 19th. Coombing. \u2014 A trip to the Abercrombie Caves. Our party was a large one, occupying two carriages and-four, one tandem, and two gigs. We had, besides, an officer and two privates of the mounted police, with several other horsemen; fourteen persons in all and twenty horses. A dray with tents, provisions, &c. pre ceded us at daylight \u2014 the cavalcade itself following at 8 a.m. The plan intended was to reach the caves and encamp there in one day's march \u2014 distance 35 miles. The dray however could not keep up. One of the drivers got the fly-blight ; the horses knocked up j so after a council of procedure, we agreed to halt at a place called \" Fiddes Station \" for the night. Whether the said Fiddes was a being still in the flesh, extinct, or purely imaginary, no one, 1 fancy, inquired. The station, which was well situated on a slope looking over a well-watered flat, consisted of an empty house with two rooms in it, which we left in undisputed possession of its present occupants \u2022 \u2014 legions of bugs ; and of a range of bark hut offices, which the attendants appropriated to themselves.

The strangest part of the story is, that the next morn ing he comes up looking sleek and hearty, and ready for the longest day's work. The fact is, there is much good and hard nourishment in Australian grass, nourishment greatly better than that yielded by ranker pasturage. A steed that had passed his night revelling in a Cheshire meadow would make but a poor figure in a series of journeys of forty to sixty miles a-day under a semi-tropical sun. Hereabouts the feed is abundant ; the hills lightly wooded and grassed up to their tops \u2014 the valleys bare of trees, with chains of pools running along them. After a merry if not a very delicately dressed meal al fresco \u2014 fresco, with the thermometer at 85\u00b0 \u2014 we ail set to work to hut ourselves for the night. The Governor and his lady had a bell tent. Other canvas contrivances were pitched or half pitched, for we had few practised hands and the ground was almost im penetrable to the pegs. A more loose and lop-sided camp I never saw. My tent, viewed by moonlight, looked like a drunken giantess staggering in quest of adventures. Then came the serving out of blankets, the purloining of carriage cushions for pillows, the pulling on of various but not picturesque or becoming nightcaps ; (whoever saw a male nightcap that was not quizzical? \u2014 quizzical enough to injure materially, perhaps fatally, the dignity of the husband in the eyes of the wife ! what hero con-"], [308, "300 OUR ANTIPODES, tinues to be a hero in a cotton nightcap with a tassel to it ? Ladies and gentlemen, I pause for a reply.) Lastly, there supervened such a night as I would not wish my direst enemy to undergo. The heat, the damp, the smoke of the fires, the mosquitos, the flying bugs ! the ants they crept in, and the ants they crept out of the inmost penetralia of our clothing \u2014 sleep, in short, with most of us was out of the question. Need it be told to any one conversant with human nature that the snores of those possessed of great powers of somnolence were cruel aggravations of our painful vigils ! Twice I made tours nocturnal round the camp, and was charmed to find several fellow-sufferers \u2014 several who could not forget their grievances in sleep. \"Oh! these detestable items of entomology!\" exclaimed the voice of one crying in the bush not far off \u2014 of one whose profession moved him doubtless to apostrophize his tiny tormentors in euphuistic terms rather than in those of execration. I fear however that there was more of swearing than of praying in our camp that night. Myself was heard to exclaim in my trouble, \" If this be pleasure, what is pain?\" an interjection duly recorded against me the next morning. Nevertheless I hold it a stale and ungracious deed to challenge the amount of enjoyment accruing from a picnic or pleasure party. Pluck your rose, without thorns, if you can ; but if you do prick your fingers, don't grumble ! that is the best philosophy. Mr. Mark Tapley would have been quite \"jolly \" under our circumstances, because it would have been creditable so to be.

Away we went through pathless woods \u2014 for here no track guided our steps ; nor in any other country in the world could a four-in-hand carriage have been safely driven over the natural surface of the forest soil. We passed one or two small sheep stations. Nothing of the Arcadian, the romantic, or the picturesque was there ; nothing to recal Florian aud his meadows emaillees de fleurs, his brebis, his bergeres, and their garlanded houleltes. There was poverty, dirt, and rags, only to be surpassed in the worst provinces of poor Ireland. The women, who were acting as hut keepers, and their children, looked half starved and dejected, and their huts were totally devoid of any of the ordinary domestic utensils or articles of comfort. At one of these places it was with difficulty that we pro cured a tin cup of very bad water. Whenever I met in New South Wales with such cases of family destitution as this, I suspected that a drunken husband and father was the cause thereof. As we approached the Caves, the scenery grew wilder and rougher, reminding me somewhat of the Lower Himalayas; but the eucalyptus and acacia are poor substitutes for the tree-rhododendron and the splendid deodara pine. It would have been beautiful, but for the total absence of water and the dismal aspect of the myriads of fire-blackened logs, erect or lying about in all * directions, encumbering our path. Path, indeed, there was none : for some time we had been driving through brushwood up to the horses' knees, as thick and not"], [310, "302 OUR ANTIPODES. unlike moorland heather. But we had no fear of losing ourselves, for we were under the guidance of Mr. David son, who, on a surveying expedition, had originally discovered these caves. At length we reached the brow of a hill, about half a mile from the object of our visit, beyond which the car riages could not proceed. Right below us, in the cleft of a deep ravine overhung by grassy hills, lay a huge black rock, about a quarter of a mile in extent, which we reached after a severe scramble. The mass is perforated by a natural tunnel, 200 feet in length, from 50 to 80 feet high, and from 30 to 50 in width, whence numerous minor caverns and galleries ramify to the right and left. The tunnel has the appearance, by the subdued light within, of an immense Pagan temple, numerous idol-like crags and stalagmites assisting the similitude. Water has evidently been both the excavator and the beautifier of this grand natural edifice. About half way through there remains a dark pool, exquisitely pure and cold. The caves are the night lodgings of numerous wallabis and wombats, the former a small kind of kangaroo, the latter a sort of marsupial bear nearly resembling the sloth. Swallows were the only day boarders we found there. The police-officer and myself explored with lighted tapers many of the galleries and vaulted chambers, the colonnades, chapels, and aisles of this singular spot. To get into some of them, we had to crawl on our hands and knees. All were as cold as death, and smelling of the grave, hot and healthy as was the atmosphere above ground.

Yet I will not press my Derbyshire friends to lose no time in coming to visit them, because a journey of 16,000 miles might possibly interfere with the ordinary course of life of quiet domestic people ; and besides, there are caves very similar to them, and quite as beautiful, at Matlock. Upon my life ! I might almost fancy myself there now ; for at this distant spot, among the wild Australian hills, where there is not a man to a million acres, I descry remnants of the well-known black bottle, proof positive of the presence of the beer and beef fed Briton, and great vulgar names scrawled on the white quartz rocks and snowy stalactites.

The rain, like a tepid shower-bath, continued to fall as we retraced our steps towards home. The \" sidling\" on the moistened ground was not only annoying, but dan gerous. Our carriage, having a low axle, slewed once or twice across stumps just high enough to bring us up all standing, to the imminent risk of our horses continuing the journey with the pole, bars, and traces, and our vehicle and selves being left behind in the bush.

Its manufacture is as follows : \u2014 a wheaten paste is made, kneaded for a short time, flattened out into a muffin shaped dough, about the size of the top of an ordinary band-box, and an inch or two thick. A part of the hearth-stone is cleared of the wood ashes, the dough is dropped upon it, and the hot ashes raked over it. If not made too thick, the damper comes out done to a turn in about half an hour. The Indian Chupatee is akin to the damper, but of much more flimsy fabric.

One of our equestrian companions on this occasion afforded a good specimen of a gentleman bushman of New South Wales. Tall and spare, wiry and active, with face, hands, and throat burnt to a ruddy bronze, his saddle seemed his natural home. As he thrust through the thickest bush, leaping with loose rein over the fallen trees, some of which presented an obstacle no less formidable than an Irish stone wall, he and his powerful and well-trained steed seemed one centaur. There was neither daylight nor grip in his easy horse manship \u2014 it was the seat, of balance. Scarcely less skilfully did two young lads of twelve and thirteen manage their poneys.

The projected trip, commenced this day, is to take in Bangaroo, the chief grazing station of our host on the banks of the Lachlan, whence we are to describe a circle round the Conobolas Mountains to Wellington, the chief town of the county so named, on the Macquarie River ; and from thence through the pastoral districts of the western portions of Wellington and Bathurst back to Coombing. Most of the quarters we were likely to occupy on this extended tour being reported too rough for a lady's accommodation, our party on this occasion was exclusively male. We made an early start, and, setting our heads westward, jogged at a steady travel ling pace of about six miles an hour through the apparently interminable bush."], [317, "309 A BUSTARD BAGGED. About eight miles from Coombing, in a tolerably open part of the forest, my eye was attracted by the movement of some animal's head, which turned to look at us over a thicket not thirty yards from the road. It was a bustard, the first I had seen since the year 1829, on the plains of Bundelcund. No one perceiving it but myself, I allowed the carriage to proceed about a hundred yards, when, having put together my gun, I alighted, and, the bird rising, I got an unsuccessful shot, the charge taking an obstructing tree and cutting it in two. Away went the splendid bird through the tops of the gums, slowly flapping his enormous wings. Hastily dismounting a trooper, I jumped on his horse, followed at full speed, and soon had the satisfaction of marking down my quarry. Halting at a respectful distance, and quickly reloading, I attempted to convert my temporary charger into a stalking-horse. The brute, however, having an apparent antipathy to fire-arms, and becoming unruly, I let him go, and back he went on our track all the way to Coomb ing. This incident caused a diversion favourable to my views ; for the bustard gazed stupidly after the retreating steed, totally unaware that his real enemy was crawling up to him, like a chetah upon the antelope, screened by every intervening bush and hollow \u2014 when the snapping of a twig startled, too late, the unwary bird, and he had just lifted his body heavily into the air after running a few paees to catch the wind, when at about sixty yards the fatal cartridge pierced his head and neck in three or four places, and he fell dead. Being a fine young bird, weighing about fifteen pounds, he was sent back to Coombing as a present to the ladies."], [318, "310 OUR ANTIPODES. After a drive of twelve miles we reached the residence of Mr. Rothery, a near connexion of our host, where we breakfasted. He possesses a comfortable cottage, with a good wide clearing round it, a very pretty wife, and a quiver full of those arrows which are very useful weapons in a colony, although at home they are apt to be somewdiat burthensome. Mr. R. has a singularly fine breed of horses proceeding from a magnificent English sire \u2014 \"Associate\" by name \u2014 which had pro bably broke down too early in life to make a reputation on the English turf, and had been transported to New South Wales for his little mishap. Of course at some distant squattage browse the flocks and herds that support this establishment, and feed the numerous mouths \u2014 as yet too young to earn their own sub sistence. At 2 p.m. we halted at Canoindra \u2014 a station on the Belabula River, where in a half-finished hut and in a tremendous storm of rain we enjoyed a capital lunch, provided by the forethought of Mr. Icely. Wet weather had evidently set in ; but, however unpropitious was such a circumstance for our journey, it was impos sible to regret that which would freshen up the parched earth, and probably save from starving thousands of sheep and cattle. The rain had been falling for many days here, for the rich alluvial plains over which we now prosecuted our journey were terribly heavy for our horses. The grass was two and three feet high on the spacious Savannahs between the rivers Belabula and Lachlan, the trees growing in fine clumps and of enormous magnitude, with wide open pasturage between"], [319, "311 A SQUATTING OUT-STATION. them \u2014 very unlikp anything we had previously seen in the country. Here we came in sight of several bustards, flying in flocks of six or eight over the forest with slow and heavy wing, or stalking in twos and threes on the dis tant plain. Numerous bevies of quail arose from under our carriage wheels as we ploughed wearily through the deep loam. With our large and noisy cavalcade it was idle to hope to get within good shot of so wary a crea ture as the bustard on open ground. I brought one down indeed at a long distance ; but the bird recovered and escaped. On a horse that will stand fire it is easy to approach and kill the bustard\u2014 still easier in a cart. At 6 p.m., after twelve hours' work, we drew rein at Mr. Icely's station of Bangaroo, which is represented by a couple of ordinary huts built of split stuff and thatched with bark. One of these had been nicely whitewashed, and became our banquetting-hall by day, and at night the dormitory of his Excellency, his son, and myself. There was just room enough for the three little stretchers and the enormous fireplace. It was a night of united rain and heat, that made our lodging not unlike a forcing-house for orchidaceous plants. The rest of the party betook themselves to tents, which were quickly wet through. Nevertheless we all slept soundly through the night \u2014 for \" Weariness can snore upon a Hint, When resty sloth finds the down pillow hard.\" Bangaroo is situated in a bight formed by the con fluence of the rivers Lachlan and Belabula, which at"], [320, "312 OUR ANTIPODES. this point constitute the present boundary of the colony \u2014 properly so called. Beyond them are the \" Unsettled Districts\" \u2014 the waste lauds, in which many thousands of the live stock of New South Wales find their subsistence, driven westward by the increasing de mand for pasturage in a country where three or four acres are required to feed a sheep, and twice as many for an ox or horse. The run of Bangaroo contains an area of 16,000 acres. Its grazing capabilities, according to a Government return, are 1,000 cattle and 1,500 sheep. Our horses were as usual turned adrift, and seemed perfectly satisfied with their meals and bed of drenched grass. The Belabula, about fifty yards from the huts, afforded our beasts plenty of water in a chain of ponds which the heavy rains were just beginning to convert into a running stream. Enormous heaps of drift-timber proclaimed how furious are the torrents which occa sionally force a channel along this now only too placid watercourse. Most of the speculations of our worthy host are said to have proved remunerative, although he did not pass through the evil times of the colony without serious reverses. Since the time when we travelled over his broad lands on the Belabula, indications of copper have been discovered of so promising a nature as to induce a company to purchase one of his acres (probably bought by him for five shillings) at a price something like 2,000/. And it was not long before this \" Belabula Mine\" got the nickname of the Bubble-bubble Mine; but on account of what peculiarity I really do not know.

The shepherds tend the flocks to their pastures by day, and bring them home at night. The hut- keeper cooks for the men, receives the sheep at night, and is answer able for them until morning. With the assistance of his collies, and a gun perhaps, he guards them against the attacks of the native dog, and what is worse, the native man. The mischief inflicted by the dingo is not confined to the mere killing a sheep or two. Sometimes at night this animal will leap into the fold amongst the timid animals, and so \"rush\" them \u2014 that is, cause them to break out and disperse through the bush, \u2014 when it becomes very difficult to recover them. I have heard that the dingo, warragal, or native dog, does not hunt in packs like the wolf and jackal ; but occasionally two or three together have been known to follow on the scent of a stray foal or calf, and to catch and kill it in company."], [322, "314 OUR ANTIPODES. Cattle keeping requires fewer hands than the care of sheep. The beasts are strong enough to take care of themselves by day and night \u2014 except when the blacks get among them and take their tithes, as they sometimes do in the far interior when kangaroos and emus are scarce. The stockman, as he who tends cattle and horses is called, despises the shepherd as a grovelling, inferior creature, and considers \"tailing sheep\" as an employment too tardigrade for a man of action and spirit. The latter sits all day \" sub tegmine gum-tree,\" playing on the Jew's-harp or accordion ; or sleeps supine, while his dog does his master's duty with one eye open.

He has need of a good and a fast horse, aud one that is not afraid of a three-railed fence or a wild bullock's horn. The riding after cattle in the bush, for the purpose of driving them in or collecting them for muster, is very hard and sometimes dangerous work. It is so exciting an employment as not only to become a favourite one with stockmen, but of the bush gentlemen ; nay, the stock-horse himself is said to enjoy the sport \u2014 much as the high-mettled hunter at home,"], [323, "315 THE STOCK-MAN HIS WHIP. when not distressed, seems to relish his gallop with the hounds. By this rough work, however, many a fine young horse has been broken down or \"stumpt up\" before he has shed his colt's teeth ; and many a broken rib or limb has fallen to the stockman's share. The stockman brags of his horse's prowess and his own, and, as I have said before, contemns the shepherd's slothful life. You know the stockman by his chin strapped cabbage-tree hat, his bearded and embrowned visage, his keen quick eye. He wears generally a jacket and trowsers of colonial tweed, the latter fortified with fustian or leather between his thin bowed legs. But the symbol of his peculiar trade is the stock-whip \u2014 a thick but tapering thong of twelve or fourteen feet, weighing perhaps a couple of pounds, affixed to a handle of a foot and a-half at most. At the end of this cruel lash is a \" cracker,\" generally made of a twisted piece of silk handkerchief, or, what is better than anything, a shred from an old infantry sash. The wilderness echoes for miles with the cracks of this terrible scourge, which are fully as loud as the report of a gun, and woe betide the lagging or unruly bullock who gets the full benefit of its stroke delivered by an experienced hand. I have seen a pewter quart pot all but cut in two by one flank of the stock-whip. Practice alone gives the power of cracking this implement.

Myself did not fail to import to England a specimen of this implement \u2014 as an article of \" vertu\" but I hereby give notice of my inability to afford in struction in the use of it. In the earlier days of the colony \u2014 as the Attorney- General stated one day in the Legislative Council \u2014 the condition of shepherd or stockman was the only one aspired to by the Australian youth. At that time Government situations went a begging in favour of such employment. Those were, doubtless, the days when the gentlemen squatters played whist at sheep points and a bullock on the rubber ; and remunerated a doctor for setting a broken limb (no other ailment is ever heard of in the bush) with a cow-fee. Another important \"hand\" employed by the squatter is the bullock- driver \u2014 or teamster; he who conducts the huge wains full of wool from the station to the port for shipment, and brings back the yearly supply of stores. Through heat and dust, rain and mud, over rock and sand, plain and mountain, he plods his slow and weary journey of three or four months \u2014 never seeing the inside of a human dwelling, perhaps, during its monotonous continuance. With his blankets and mattrass, his iron pot and tin tot \u2014 stretched at night under the tarpaulin of his dray, with a smouldering log-fire before him, and his vigilant dog as sentry over his charge, his mind aspires not after higher luxuries. In spite of his rough and reckless character when unemployed, or only em-"], [325, "BUSH WORKMEN AND WAGES. 317 ployed in spending his accumulated wages, and his sometimes barely human exterior, the bullock-driver is generally trustworthy to his employer\u2014 although occa sionally his virtue does succumb to the temptations offered by a cargo of rum or tobacco. I could put my finger on more than one person engaged in this capacity who came out to the colony as men of birth, education, and capital, but, having been ruined by misfortune, mis placed confidence, or misconduct, have betaken them selves to an employment so uncivilized. The worst feature of bush-labour is the almost exclu sive employment of males. This is a remnant, of course, of the old convict system. The habit of engaging married couples to do the duty of shepherds and hut keepers is, however, growing into use, and even children are made of service in carrying the rations to the men in charge of flocks. The wages of this class ranged very high during the whole period of my stay in the country \u2014 from 15/. to 25/. for shepherds, stockmen, and dray men ; watchmen or hut-keepers, 1 5/. The usual ration allowed consists of 10 lbs. of meat, 10 lbs. of bread, \u00a3 lb. of tea, fibs, of sugar, per week. Any extra supplies are booked against their wages. It is needless to say that tobacco is an absolute necessary of the bush. High and low all indulge in smoking \u2014 smoking, solace of the empty head among the rich, of the empty stomach among the poor ! During busy seasons a handsome addition is given to the wages of those employed. All workmen lodge gratis, and at many farms or cattle stations where milk is plentiful a supply is furnished to them. Some of"], [326, "318 OUR ANTIPODES. them find time to cultivate a few vegetables. The bush affords them fuel \" galore\" for warmth and cooking. As for meat, it is such a drug that twice as much as the ration is often devoured or wasted. Alas ! what a pity that some of the lusty paupers of the 1 0 or 1 1 per cent, of England's population receiving parochial relief, are not sharing in the excessive abundance of these colonies, and giving their labour in return for it ! What pity that the small capitalists, who are daily trenching on their principal under the pressure of rates, and taxes, and dear food, do not more frequently bring their money to a market, where with common industry they may make it the nucleus of a handsome competence, and meanwhile assist in the development of the still latent resources of the colony. Trifling as this journal is, I feel some degree of responsibility in making remarks of the above tendency, because, as I have said before, it is not to be disputed that hundreds have met ruin in New South Wales, whether engaged in pastoral or other pursuits ; and that, in the cases of some, no human exertion could have averted the catastrophe ; yet I cannot but gather from all I have heard and read, that the mishaps of the majo rity are clearly traceable to the idleness, ignorance, or imprudence of the sufferers. Halting at Bangaroo this day, the whole of our party went out, in different directions, in search of game.

Others followed the bustard on the Plains. Owing to the wet weather these birds were more than usually shy. Although I found full a dozen of them I did not get a fair shot all day. A curious instance occurred of the method in which the bustard conceals himself from observation \u2014 an instance by no means confirmatory of the old story of this bird, in common with the ostridge, hiding his head only, and then fancying his whole body secure. Espying a very fine bird descending in his flight, I marked him down on flat, open ground about a mile distant, and immediately galloped to the spot. The grass was thin, and not six inches high. There was indeed one trifling bush or tuft which might have held a pheasant. I examined it at the distance of twenty yards, but feeling satisfied that it was not capable of containing an animal four feet high and weighing from fifteen to twenty pounds, I passed on, sorely puzzled ; for, measuring my powers of marking a bustard by what I could do with regard to a snipe, I thought I could hardly be mistaken with the former. After proceeding about 100 yards, I returned with a feeling of doubt towards the tuft, when, sure enough, up jumped the mighty bird, and after two or three strides, took to his wings. I gave him a shot which broke his thigh for him, and might have broken my own neck, for my horse shied and plunged at the report, and for some time refused to be comforted. A stockman on a fast little horse pursued the stricken bird at full speed, and had almost reached him with his whip"], [328, "320 OUR ANTIPODES. when he rose again from a mound on which he had alighted, and with renewed strength swept out of sight. Mr. Fitz Roy was more fortunate. Cantering home towards the station in the evening through the bush, a bustard started up almost under his horse's feet, and so slow was the bird in getting under sail, that he had time to pull up, dismount, and make a successful shot before he was out of reach. This was a very fine bird, weighing upwards of twenty pounds. November 26th. \u2014 Breaking up our quarters at Ban garoo, we retraced our steps amid a storm of rain, across the beautiful parklike Plains, to Canoindra, with the intention to cross the Belabula at that point, in prose cution of our tour. Here a council was held as to the abandonment of or the perseverance in the original plan of operations ; for the roads in advance were merely bush tracks, easily rendered impassable by - heavy rains, and traversed by many rivers and water-courses liable to floods. I gave the casting vote. \" En avant,\" was the word ; and, dashing through the mingled mud and water of the Belabula, the Governor, guided by the police, led the way across the heavy loam of an alluvial country, the rest following on his track. The whole day's journey was like a ploughing match; but in due course of time \u2014 without one moment's reprieve of the elements \u2014 we gained, after sunset, the little bush-settlement of the Clements Brothers. Here, \" far removed from noise and strife,\" except such as may arise among themselves, four of a family with their wives and children reside in as many slab-"], [329, "321 A BUSn LODGING. huts, within a few hundred yards of each other. Would not experience predict family jars and disunion under such circumstances ? I fear me the fraternal establish ments so strongly bound to support each other in the solitude they had chosen, were not connected by such peaceful relations as the ties of blood should have warranted. Whether the Clements themselves or the Clements's wives were of inclement temperament I did not inquire, but the domestic atmosphere was manifestly cloudy, and doubtless the question of which of the four tenements was to shelter the person of her Majesty's representative, was calculated to bring on a storm. The cottage allotted to the Governor, his son, and myself had evidently undergone some considerable beautifying in the expectation of its becoming a tem porary palace. The windows were shaded by clean white dimity curtains, festooned with pink calico. A coarse but snowy table-cloth was spread on the old cedar table, and a regiment of ricketty chairs were drawn round the capacious newly whitewashed chimney lug, in which crackled a cheerful wood-fire. All this, with a suit of dry clothes and a hot beaker of negus, after a substantial and wholesome meal, was far from unenjoyable, while the rain fell in ceaseless cadence on the bark roof, and splashed in torrents off the eaves. Heavy rain in Australia is so completely an exception to the general rule, that I always contemplated it with that degree of interest and curiosity with which one observes a phenomenon of whatsoever sort.

The nuptial couch of the proprietors of the hut, with a green gauze mosquito net and a fine patch-work quilt, was decently spread for his Excellency. His secretary was accommodated with the sofa in the sitting-room, while myself was consigned to what appeared to be the dairy. I cannot enlarge on my share of enjoyment of the bed that fell to my lot, not being its only tenant by some thousands. I can only answer for myself. Suffice it, that I had rather for ever \" press my pillow alone \" than in such sprightly company, Odious, filth-engen dered insect ! There is bliss in shedding the blood of the guilty mosquito caught in the fact \u2014 though, after all, it is our own blood that we spill. There may be felicity in the cracking of a flea in stagrante delictu. But there is no retribution for the bug \u2014 his life and death are alike offensive ! I was too tired, however, to care for the dis comforts of a bed consisting of a sheet of bark, half a foot too short, laid across tressels, and covered with a bag of chaff and vermin acting as a mattrass ; for the night-winds blowing through my hair, nor for the rain drops plashing on the earthen floor till a \" water-hole \" was formed large enough to float my slippers. So I slept until I was awakened, with a start, by a gentle pull at my counterpane. What sort of an adventure was this to turn out? I could see the grey dawn through the chinks in the split logs that formed the outer wall ; and, carrying my eyes downward, I per ceived a white object intruding through a crevice, and"], [331, "323 A BUSH BEAUTY clutching my bed-clothes. Jumping out of bed, I seized my stick, and was about to strike, when my visitor gave tongue in those well-known tones that saved the Capitol of Rome. It was indeed a goose : but why the bird took pleasure in nibbling a dirty rug through a hole in the wall, remains a mystery. Our hostess was assisted in her household operations by a remarkably pretty girl, apparently about sixteen years of age, who I was surprised to see carrying a bouncing child which she said was her own. She was the daughter, it appeared, of one of the brothers, and the wife of a soldier serving in New Zealand. When I told her that the head-quarters of the regiment \u2014 for he was in the band \u2014 was on its way from the land of the cannibal to Sydney, the sunny beam of blushing delight which ought to have suffused the young bride's cheek at the unexpected news, would have fallen warmly on the heart of an old soldier and bachelor like myself. Unluckily for connubial sentiment \u2014 the deuce a beam was there ! On the contrary, a dark cloud passed across the pretty countenance of the absent soldier's wife, and was succeeded by a deadly pallor. On a much slenderer substratum than this, a \" Loiterer,\" or a \" Penciller-by-the-Way \" might have founded his tale of \" The Bush Bride of Mogong;\" for such was the name of the sequestered settlement. There were whispers regarding the visits of a hand some stockman at the family hamlet\u2014\" one,\" perhaps, \"who had blighted many a flower before.\" I closed my ears to the details; yet some months after wards the denoument was, as it were, forced upon x2"], [332, "324 OUR ANTIPODES. me: the returned soldier was in hospital, mad, having lost his reason through repeated paroxysms of jealousy ! November 27th.\u2014 Duly roused at 4 a.m. by the. before mentioned early bird, I called up my fellow-traveller on the sofa; and, putting on our slippers, we repaired through the dusk of daybreak to a pool hard by, where plunging in we cooled our flea-bitten skins. The water seemed deliciously fresh to our feverish sensations, and I mention the trifling circumstance as a warning to inexperienced Australian travellers. The extreme mud diness of the rain-swollen water-hole, imperceptible in the dark, was a bagatelle ; but we heard on returning to the house that the pool was full of horse-leeches, and that, but for the freshet of rain and our hasty bath, we might have suffered phlebotomy to an extent extremely inconvenient on a long journey. During this day's work we occasionally came near the Belabula river, whose course was easily distinguishable by the dark selvage of casuarinas fringing its banks. It forms, at present, the frontier between the located and the unsettled districts, and will probably long remain so, unless the upset price of waste land is reduced. Traversing a remarkably fine pastoral country, with a good deal of land well calculated for agriculture, we passed the grazing stations of Tolong and Roreecabon ; making our mid-day halt for rest and refreshment at Boree-narang, the homestead of Mr. Barton, who gave us as hearty a welcome as a fine, English-looking, and I believe, English-hearted gentleman could offer, while"], [333, "325 RAIN AND FLOODS. lying on his couch with a desperately fractured leg ; his lady being prevented from appearing by a less melan choly cause of confinement.

At about five p.m. we found ourselves on the bank of the Molong creek, which separated us from our destina tion for the night, \u2014 the Molong Inn, \u2014 a lone house on the opposite plain. It was an ugly-looking turbid stream, of the consistency of pea-soup, with greasy and rotten banks. However, our night's lodging lay before us as well as the obstacle.

The bar of the house was filled by a dozen of regular bush-boys \u2014 great hulking fellows, labouring under a temporary plethora of pay, and hanging about the rum butt until it should be spent. There was a fiddler, too, for their delectation ; and these boisterous, half-drunken clowns continued to dance together the greater part of the night, apparently as much inspired by the cracked violin, \"real Old Tom,\" and the rough-muzzled, fustian clad partner, redolent of rum and \" nigger-head \" \u2014 indeed very much more inspired than I have often seen the white-waistcoated, patent-leather-booted dandy, with his Weippert, his iced Roman punch, and the belle of the season as his associate in the valtz.

During the last two days we had enjoyed various"], [335, "CROSSING THE BELL RIVER. 327 fine views of the Canobolas Range, the highest peak of which is 4,500 feet. In a country so comparatively flat, we doubtless owed a good deal of the rain that fell upon us to the great surcharged cloud-butts that rested con tinually on the shoulders of these hills. It was a really fine tract of alluvial land we traversed this day. The grass was plentiful, and two or three feet high ; the trees were more shapely, and less stag-headed than is the case in the sandstone districts. We halted for an hour at the Head Station of the Messrs. Burton, where three brothers, living together, conduct the provincial part of the business, while a fourth attends to its interests at Sydney. The station is one of the simplest construction \u2014 a log-hut or two, bark roofed, for a dwelling-house, and some farm buildings somewhat more carefully put together. The locality is well chosen for grazing purposes, and there appears to be plenty of game in the neighbourhood ; but the idea of comfort could hardly be connected in my mind with so homely a lodging and so few of the less absolute requirements of civilized life as are eu joyed by these gentlemen. It is needless to say a word about the high spirits with which the plentiful supply of rain inspired every one we met. The drenching we had endured for four or five days we were glad to compound for in considera tion of the benefit accruing from the same cause to all the farming interests. We crossed three several times this day the river Bell. Each attempt was both hazardous and doubtful, and delayed us much ; for the stream bad overflowed its banks, (Australian rivers possess two sets of banks, one"], [336, "328 OUR ANTIPODES. for dry, another for wet seasons,) and the strength aud depth of the water could only be proved by actual experiment,\u2014 a duty which devolved upon, and was well performed by, the troopers. The annexed Plate will give some idea of the plan adopted with perfect success at these perilous passages. The leaders, being un manageable in deep rapid water, were taken off, and, with the police horses, assisted in carrying over to the opposite bank the servants, the policemen, and some of the gentlemen, and, with them, a stout green-hide rope, one end of which had been affixed to the carriage-pole. Sir Charles gallantly kept his seat on the box, myself standing on the seat behind him to help in case of need. When all was ready, the wheel-horses were urged into the stream ; eight or ten men hawled on the rope, thus assisting in the draught and keeping the pole straight, and we were soon tumbling about, like a ship at sea, over stumps and stones, some of which were heard rumbling along the bottom of the current. However, after a brief struggle, C\u00e6sar and bis fortunes were safely delivered on the opposite shore. As for the joint phaeton of the Colonial Secretary and myself, every article of baggage having been removed, my servant, sitting up to his waist in water, drove it across, assisted by the rope.

He brought us some black damper and a dry chip of cheese, (for we were famished.) together with a hot beverage in a tin pot, which richly deserved the epithet of \" post and rail \" tea ; it might well have been a decoction of \" split stuff \" or \" iron bark shingles,\" for any resemblance it bore to the Chinese plant. Another notorious ration tea of the bush is called \" Jack the painter.\" This is a very green tea indeed, its viridity evidently produced by a discreet use of the copper drying pans in its manufacture. Hunger is indeed the best sauce ; for, sitting on a fallen log, and watching the gradual retrocession of the water mark, like \" Rusticus \" awaiting \" dum defluat amnis,\" we discussed our damper aud discoloured hot water with more appetite than many a better repast under more facile circumstances. In recalling to mind, on subsequent occasions, the several perils by water encountered this day, it has always appeared to me that our escape from losing car riages, and horses, and even human life, \u2014 a loss that the smallest accident in so fierce a torrent must have rendered nearly inevitable, \u2014 was almost miraculous. The passages of the Bell, indeed, could not have been accom plished at all, but for the strong manual power of our party, assisted by persons sent to help us. These sudden floods are one of the many scourges of the squatter \u2014 as destructive as the blacks, the dingoes, scab, catarrh, drought, or bush-fires.

On the third day, (the poor sheep having long before nibbled off the very roots of the narrow pasture, and the shepherd having swallowed his last crust,) the latter plunged into the current, in the hope of reaching the mainland. His ductile and famished charge fol lowed him to a sheep, the faithful colley followed the last of the flock, and shepherd, sheep, and dog were swept away together. Accounts of loss of life in the bush generally follow news of heavy rains, and minor accidents are of every day occurrence. We hear of Commissioners of Crown Lands, or other itinerant gentlemen, being carried away in their gigs ; losing one or more horses ; and some times of their own lives being sacrificed, or only saved by the skill and intrepidity of the despised black fellow. We saw a good deal of game to-day, four or five bustards, and several kinds of water-fowl ; but there was too much rain and hard work to allow of our pursuing them. At the third crossing of the Bell, we were met by Mr. Maxwell, our host for the night, who welcomed us to his flourishing sheep station of Narrigal. The pro prietor repairs to this place in the shearing season only, his chief homestead being far away elsewhere. He possesses, however, purchased land having eleven miles of water frontage to it on the located side of the river, and extensive runs on the opposite bank, the Bell here forming the frontier of the Colony proper. Mr. Maxwell has the reputation of being what is financially styled \" a warm man.\" With such a mountain of wool as we saw piled under tarpaulins, he can hardly be otherwise. He had \" lots of sheep,\" he said, (which probably"], [341, "PASTORAL HOSPITALITY. 331 meant 30,000 or 40,000 ;) \" but only a few head of cattle,\" (1,000, or so !) The dwelling-house at Narrigal is a mere shieling. The abodes of the servants, (as the performers of any kind of labour, domestic or agrarian, are called in Aus tralia,) form a village street of whitewashed bark-huts, with stables, stack-yards, &c, and a huge wool-shed, like a railway engine-house, in which (the bales having been for the purpose turned out) we dined sumptuously \u2014 claret, hock, champagne, and of course bottled ale, as plentiful as though our carouse had taken place on the banks of the \" blue Rhine,\" the \" arrowy Rhone,\" or the beery Trent, rather than on those of an Australiau bush-river, only a few years ago discovered by the enter prising surveyor, Mr. Oxley. There was a large party of natives, men, women and children, camped behind the station, that is, squatted before a fire and behind a sloping sheet of bark turned from the wind, \u2014 in bush lingo, a break-weather, \u2014 or in guneeahs* of boughs thatched with grass. From the half drunken looks of some of the men, the greedy begging of others, and certain indications of good understanding between their women and the station-men, (not a single white woman was to be seen there,) I set them down as one of the many fainflies or tribes of the Aborigines who have nothing to thank the English for but demorali zation and deeper degradation.

November 29th. \u2014 Started early on horseback, and leaving the vehicles to follow, rode to Wellington, fifteen mdes, through a fine rich valley of naturally clear pas ture land framed in wooded hills. The road passes close to the famed caves of Wellington, where many curious fossU remains, specimens of which were sent home for the examination of Professor Owen, have been discovered. Mitchell describes, I think, three distinct caverns, full of fragments of bones, apparently belonging to a gigantic species of kangaroo. I entered the larger of the caves with another of the party, but having no better light than that procured by lucifers and a bit of bark, we could explore but little. The roof and sides are of limestone, with a floor of soft snuff-like dust, and a temperature, on a day of uncommon heat, cool as a catacomb. We passed, en route, the ruined Apsley Mission station, whereof I have previously given some account, and where, I believe, a most patient experiment of several years' duration, and the united endeavours of two or three zealous Clergymen, did not produce as many true converts amongst these wild and intractable tribes. The situation of the abandoned establishment is beau tiful, and every way suitable for the habitation of civilized man. It was sad to trace the almost obliterated foun dations of some of the buildings, and the deserted state"], [343, "333 JUNCTION OF THE BELL AND THE MACQUARIE. of others, which slight repairs might still render habit able and useful ; and to see the spacious gardens relaps ing into wilderness. The Government had formerly in this fine valley a considerable stock-farm, and an establishment for the custody and employment of convicts. After a delightful canter of about three hours across a country where a horse might well be left to his own pace and guidance, and where the falconer might follow his hawk without one glance at the ground under foot, we found ourselves stopped short at the confluence of the Bell with the Macquarie, just beyond which junction the township of Wellington stands. The latter river, the same that waters Bathurst about 150 miles to the eastward, had increased in importance very much since we last crossed its stream almost with dry ax\\Ies \u2014 in creased both from the tributaries it has received in its winding course, and from the late heavy rains. There was now no question of axles. The ordinary ford was quite impassable. Trees denoting its original rivage stood trembling in the midst of a rushing muddy tor rent. A naked black attempted to swim our horses over, beginning with an old experienced bush-horse whose very experience taught him to refuse the doubtful voyage. So the project of passing them over was aban doned, and, saddles and bridles having been stripped off, the quadrupeds were turned loose into the luxuriant meadows within the loop of the two rivers.

Mr. Wright, formerly of H. M. army, the present Crown Commissioner for the district, who had been our very agreeable fellow-traveller for some days, received the Governor and his suite most handsomely at his residence just beyond the town. The duties of Commissioner of Crown Lands are mul tifarious and important. He is general superintendent of the Crown's demesne, the waste lands of the colony ; looks after the revenue, in so far as it depends upon depasturing licences and assessment of live stock ; and as a government functionary and justice of the peace is in other points a potential person. This officer is furnished with a house, and is tolerably well paid. The dwelling-house of the gentleman holding this post in the district of Wellington, although rude in structure, has all the neatness and order of a barrack. It is beautifully situated on a bend of the Macquarie, which here rolls between high banks, on the further of which Mount Arthur rears its wooded crest, dominating the Plains. Mr. Wright had erected a spacious tempo rary pavilion in addition to the not very liberal residence afforded him by the public ; and, within its walls, this most comfortable of Australian bachelors afforded us practical proof that, even on the confines of civilization, a cuisine recherchee, with perfect cleanliness, may be obtained under the eye of an experienced and attentive master. Every part and article of furniture of the cottage shone with cleanliness. It was possible in this establishment to ask in the morning for a tub of water"], [345, "335 CLEANLINESS VERSUS DIRT. without impressing the servants with the notion that you were about to fulfil the conditions of \" every man his own washerwoman,\" or to perform some rare expe riment in hydraulics. The plate, linen, and servants' dress were neatness itself. Such-like domestic observ ances are too much lost sight of in the bush \u2014 more's the pity, because they cost nothing, and without cleanli ness household comfort is a word of mockery. If in some of the Australian houses in which I have tem porarily lodged a couple of hours a-week were devoted to domestic purification, it is fair to suppose that the travelling guest from cleaner quarters would escape the endurance of a severe course of practical entomology, which, science and joking apart, becomes a serious affair when pursued through a week of wakeful nights. The township of Wellington is 117 miles from Bathurst, and 238 miles from Sydney ; from which city it is the most distant settlement directly inland, or to the westward. Nothing can give a clearer impression of the vastness of the insular continent of New Holland, and of the comparative insignificance of its occupancy by civilized man, than the taking on a map a step of the compasses from Sydney to Wellington, and from thence describing a stride of that instrument across the unknown wilder ness of the interior to the settlement of Swan River on the western coast.

Under their guidance, accordingly, wTell mounted and accompanied by three or four greyhounds of a powerful breed, we traversed a wide extent of forest-land where in ordinary seasons this animal was known to abound. In a long day's ride, however, we only found one kangaroo, fortunately a good specimen of that kind known as a red-flyer, a strong and fleet animal not less than five feet high. The bush was tolerably open, hampered only by fallen timber and occasional rocky or boggy bits. The find was very fine. The kangaroo, which was feeding in a patch of long grass, jumped up under our horses' feet, and at first going off looked very much like a red-deer hind. Its action was less smooth though equally swift ; but no one could have guessed that it consisted only of a series of jumps, the fore-feet never touching the ground. A shrill tallyho from one of the finest riders I ever saw made all the dogs spring into the air. Two of them got away on pretty good terms with our quarry, and, while facing the hill at a pace considerably greater than an ordinary hunting gallop, I thought we should have had a \"whoo \u2014 whoop!\" in less than five minutes. After"], [347, "A KANGAROO HUNT. 337 crossing a ridge and commencing the descent on the opposite side, however, the red-flyer showed us quite \" another pair of shoes,\" and a pretty fast pair too. I never saw a stag in view go at all like our two-legged friend : and, in short, after a sharp burst of twelve or four teen minutes, both dogs and men were fairly distanced. In about half that time I had lost my place by riding at full speed into the fork of a fallen tree concealed in long grass, a predicament out of which there is only one means of extrication, namely, retreat ; for cavalry has no chance against a good abattis. The Australian gentle men present rode with snaffle bridles pretty nearly at full speed, through, under, or over the forest trees, aecording to their position, standing or prostrate, the great art being, it should seem, to leave the horse as much as possible to his own guidance. On the whole, taking into consideration the hardness of the ground, the stump-holes, sun-cracks, and fissures caused by water, the stiffness of the underwood, and the frequency of the trees, living, dying, and dead, burnt and burning, the riding in a kangaroo hunt may be considered tole rably dangerous. It affords, in short, to English man hood that quantum of risk which seems to form the chief seasoning of the dish called sport. In a good run with fox-hounds your person, on a race-course your purse, are just sufficiently jeopardized to promote a pleasing degree of excitement. The dogs employed to-day were in no condition to cope with a \" red-flyer,\" or \" old soldier,\" as a large kind of kangaroo is called, on good ground. In deep ground, either is soon caught by real good dogs. VOL. i. t"], [348, "338 OUR ANTIPODES. I think I perceive the reason why the animal always, if possible, takes a down-hill course when pursued. The hare, which, like the kangaroo, has very long hind-legs, prefers running up hill, but she makes good use also of her fore-legs. At full speed the kangaroo's fore-feet, as I have said, never touch the ground, and therefore, in going dow he has more time to gather up his hinder limbs to repeat his tremendous spring than he could have in facing an ascent. I wish I had had time to measure the stroke of the \" red-flyer\" we chased to-day when at his best pace. I am convinced it would have equalled the well-known stride of the great \" Eclipse.\" The G. M. on the shoulder of the horse in my sketch will give an idea of the disfiguring manner in which Australian horses are branded by their breeders. At bay, the kangaroo is dangerous to young and un wary dogs, from the strength with which he uses the long sharp claw of his hind foot, a weapon nearly as formidable as the wild boar's tusk. The animal, when hard pressed, not unfrequently takes to a water-hole, where from his stature he has a great advantage over the dogs, ducking them under water, and sometimes drowning them as they swim to the attack. The tail of the kangaroo makes excellent soup ; the haunch is tolerable venison, but, like most really wild venison, it is too lean. A good bushman, or a black, knows, how ever, where to find a certain portion of fat when he is about to make a hunter's dish, which might with pro priety be called an Australian kabaub.

Kangaroo \" steamer\" is another bush-dish \u2014 a sort of haggis of venison and s. ' k, very popular with those who have time and patience for the culinary process called simmering. An officer from Van Diemen's Land told me that he had once killed in that colony a kangaroo of such mag nitude, that, being a long way from home, he was unable, although on horseback, to carry away any portion except the tail, which alone weighed 30 lbs. This species is called the boomah, and stands about seven feet high. Besides the single kangaroo we saw this day no other animals, with the exception of a few kangaroo rats, which the dogs occasionally bounded after, with little success, among scrubby rockland ; two large guanas, about two feet long, swarming lazily up a tree, one of which a black fellow brought down dead with a cast of his boomerang; and a poisonous ash-coloured snake, which I cut in pieces with my hunting whip under my horse's fegs. There were also a good many quail, which, as we flushed them, were swooped at by a large black falcon that kept his place near us on the march, now on a tree, now on the wing\u2014 and thus shared our sport. In the grass lands a sort of ground pigeon, called the dudu, a very handsome little bird, got up and went off like a partridge, strong and swift ; and re-alighted on the y 2"], [352, "340 OUR ANTIPODES. ground, running into cover. I never saw the bird except on this occasion. Our hunt led us through some fine tracts of forest pasture. The \" intervals,\" as alluvial flats near rivers are called in Canada, were extremely rich. The trees too were of the most majestic proportions. I measured the girth of one of these bush Falstaffs, and found it no less than thirty-three feet. Along the surface roots of the largest trees, the soil, we observed, had been turned up as if by swine. This is done, as we were told, by the blacks in their search for a species of grub, a favourite article of food with them, and reported to be quite as palatable as marrow. There is something truly revolting in the idea of eating a great white maggot. The thought makes one shudder; yet, after all, the man who first tested the qualities of the raw oyster, \" ripped untimely \" from its mother shell, was no less adventurous than the grub-eating Australian savage. Poor blackey ! although the white usurper will exter minate, devour, or drive away your kangaroo, emu, aud wallabi, and shoot you if you indidge in mutton chops in return ; I do believe he will leave you in undisputed pos session of your tree-grub \u2014 the only grub in which the British maw cannot follow you \u2014 except indeed human steaks, which, I imagine, have never yet been deliberately eaten, by white man\u2014 although it is notorious that dogs, eats, and horses, in unrecognised forms, do occasionally find their way into the London meat-market."], [353, "CHAPTER XI.

I would describe the town of Wellington if I could : but what can be said of a town where there are scarcely two houses within a stone's throw of each other, and every second one is a public-house ?"], [354, "342 OUR ANTIPODES. In the morning we retraced our steps to Mr. Maxwell's station at Narragal, fifteen miles, where we resumed the carriages, and continued our retreat to Coombing through the squatting districts of Wellington and Bathurst, thereby travelling over fresh ground. The most difficult part of the road was the first few miles from Narragal\u2014 the ascent of the Mumble Hill ; which never could have been accomplished without the aid of Mr. Maxwell's bullock teams. Six oxen were added to the Governor's vehicle, and four to mine ; which by this means were dragged slowly but surely to the top of this nearly preci pitous mountain, our worthy host thus speeding the parting guest at the rate of about half-a-mile an hour. Our party were indebted for our supper and beds this night, and our breakfast the following day, to the hospi tality of two squatting establishments. The gentlemen were away at Sydney with their wool ; but it was im possible very deeply to lament an absent landlord, when landladies so very agreeable remained at home. Perhaps it was in consequence of the absence of the master that in the former of these houses there arose, after our retirement for the night, a glorious disturbance among the menials. The scene was the kitchen, towards which my bedroom looked ; and both sounds and sights an nounced a serious affray. Pulling on my boots again I proceeded through the back-door to the spot, and found two rough-looking fellows fighting, or rather sparring, in the midst of screaming women and crashing crockery. I saw at a glance that the combatants devoutly hoped in their hearts that my interference was intended to promote peace : but no, my object was to save our kind landlady's"], [355, "\" SHEPHERD, I HAVE LOST MY \" WAY. 343 property \u2014 not their eyes and noses ; and I read in their looks bitter disappointment when I simply invited them to finish their set-to behind the stable by the bright moonlight, and offered myself to see fair play These pugnacious fellows shook hands immediately ! During the early part of the next day, December 3d, our guides fairly lost their and our way. We got into a boggy tract of country, and became seriomly apprehensive lest the carriages should permanently stick fast. The position was far from pleasant, for we had no provisions, and our next halting-place was at some distance. Horsemen were sent out in different directions in search of a track. At length, sweeping the dreary prospect with eager eye, I discovered a moving object. It was a sheep ;^\u2014 there was a flock \u2014 and near them I found a young girl seated on a log. A youthful shepherdess tending her snowy and bleating charge under the sylvan shades of the forest, sounds highly romantic and charming. One recals at once the sighing swains and tender maids of Arcady the Blest, and the Strephons and Floras of pastoral song;. 6- In this case there was no room for sentiment, except that of pity for the poor girl and anxiety for our own situation. She seemed half idiotic, answering not a word to my inquiries, but pointing to a distant hut. And indeed in any case, especially when nearer large towns, the Australian traveller had best take heed how he in dulges pastoral visions in the bush. The only Flora he is likely to meet with may be one from a bludgeon or bullet, at the hand of some -black-muzzled ranger from behind a gum-tree, which will either bring him to his"], [356, "344 OUR ANTIPODES. senses, or knock them out of him ! Not that my warn ing is of any urgency as addressed to the majority of the people of New South Wales, the safety of whose persons is hardly likely to be imperilled by undue indulgence in sentimental emotions or romantic abstractions. The father of the poor little shepherdess having guided us into the right road to Summerhill, at which place we were to bait, we soon drew near that little settlement ; and at about half a mile therefrom, a deputation of some thirty horsemen advanced to meet the Governor, and conducted him to a very tolerable inn, where we received and digested a loyal address and an early dinner. Little thought his Excellency \u2014 little thought the good folks who were welcoming him with every showy demonstra tion in their power \u2014 that our meeting at Summerhdl in 1846 took place on a \"field of the cloth of gold !\" It was not until 1851 that, in the bed of the Summerhill Creek, not far from this spot, gold was first found, and first announced to the public of New South Wales. Whde we were regaling ourselves in the parlour of the inn, affairs at the bar of the house were going on with spirit. The health of her Majesty's representative, and of each other, was repeatedly and enthusiastically drank by the deputies ; and when our progress was resumed, it had become a kind of bacchanal triumph. The plump and ruddy individual who took command of the escort ought to have been mounted on a leopard, and crowned and cincted with vine-leaves. It was wonderful to see the strength and balance with which he kept his seat in spite of his potations. His aide-de-camp was nearly as remarkable in the same line. It was clear that both had"], [357, "345 A RIGHT LOYAL RECEPTION. practised equitation and inebriety as twin sciences, from their boyhood upwards. In the centre of a dozen jets of mud splashed up by our zealous guardians, our cavalcade passed out of Sum merhill, under a pair of gorgeous banners sustained by two standard bearers standing, or, more properly, stag gering opposite each other, and apparently on the worst of teiTus. I heard one of them, a little old native of the land of pat-riotism, conclude a volley of abuse discharged at his vis-a-vis, by contemptuously denouncing him as \"a bloody immigrant!\" thereby leaving the hearer to infer that the speaker was himself a \" Government man,\" that his rival was a free man, and that it was disgraceful for any one to come to this country except in pursuance of a sentence of a court of criminal jurisdiction. One of the flags bore the motto, \" Welcome, noble Charlie the other, \u2014 \" Here's to the gale That fill'd the sail That brought the patriot to our shores I\" What wonder that the bearer was a sheet or two in the wind! We were just getting somewhat tired and bored with our equestrian companions, who continued to canter by the sides of the carriages, when, just as one of them had sworn eternal friendship to myself and good fellowship with all mankind, and had repeatedly wrung my hand at the risk of his neck, a largish house hove in sight ; a sign-post stood before it; it was a public-house, \"licensed to retail fermented and spirituous liquors.\""], [358, "346 OUR ANTIPODES. To our great relief, this apparition put an immediate, a natural, and a general termination to the attendance of our well-meaning friends. Passing over the rich lowlands of \"King's Plains,\" we reached at 7 r. m. the snug country inn of Mr. Doyle ; and here a council was called on the question of re maining there for the night, or pushing onwards the fifteen miles to Coombing. \" Forward\" was once more the verdict, and accordingly we enjoyed \u2014 the enjoyment somewhat doubtful \u2014 a most beautiful moonlight drive through forest, swamp, and swollen creek, over crackling branches and soughing mud, brier and brake, sand and rock; and for some miles through the \"burnt fathers\" of the bush \u2014 a large tract just passed over by fire, subdued, but not extinguished, by the rain ; and in four hours and a half, at one o'clock of the night, we thankfully reached Coombing ; \u2014 \" and so to bed with great content,\" as old Pepys cozily expresses himself. Thus, with a good day's work of nineteen hours, was concluded our circuit of 230 miles round the Canobolas Mountains and the pastoral districts at their feet. This range has since been discovered to be the axis of an immense gold field. In the spring of the year 1850, when I paid a second visit to Mr. Icely, this night journey would have been impossible. During the preceding winter, or, rather, at the close of it, so heavy and unusual a fall of snow had taken place, that the whole face of the country round about was strewn with branches broken down by the weight of the drifts. Many of these disjected members of the gnarled old gum-trees were thicker than a man's"], [359, "A DISMEMBERED FOREST. 347 body ; and so completely were the bush-pastures cum bered with the debris, that the area of grazing ground was seriously diminished ; nor could it be restored until the whole of the fallen timber had been burnt off \u2014 a dangerous remedy to adopt. The oldest blacks had never seen the like before ; they were alarmed, and their lives endangered, by the continual and general downfal of boughs during two or three nights. The poor wretches could find no safe shelter from the chilly storm, for every tree might be a traitor. If the ordinances of Nature permitted heavy snows to fall upon the English oak or elm in full leaf, they would probably fare no better than did the eucalyptus in this case. The holly, on the contrary, bears, uninjured, leaf, fruit, and snow together. Experienced bushmen seldom sleep under a large gum-tree, well knowing the dangerous brittleness of the branches. This part of the country, so destitute of humidity, has seldom been seen under such flattering circumstances as distinguish it at present, the unusually heavy and con tinuous fall of rain having made it one sheet of verdure. It was easy to see that the squatters were alarmed lest the new Governor should imbibe, together with the numerous wettings he got, too high an idea of the natural wealth of the soil, and thus form too low an estimate of the risks and difficulties of their position, with reference to his future legislation. It must not be forgotten that Sir Charles's inland tour took place in 1846, previously to the cession of further privileges of tenure, &c. to the stock proprietors, as conferred by the present regulations."], [360, "348 OUR ANTIPODES. In the subsequent visit to Coombing which I have alluded to, I found the worthy proprietor, in addition to his other avocations of squatter, landed proprietor, member of the Legislative Council, &c, had got yet another iron in the fire ; but he was introducing it so cautiously as to run little risk of burning his finger..., an accident which has befallen many dabblers in mining. Within 200 yards of his dwelling he had discovered a rich lode of copper, and had got well down to it at fifty or sixty feet. Amongst other mineralogical curiosities, Mr. Icely showed us on this occasion two or three minute speci mens of a \"metal more attractive\" \u2014 of gold in a quartz matrix, found on his own estate, so minute as to be clearly visible only through a microscope. He produced also from his cabinet a letter \u2014 I forget whether printed or in manuscript \u2014 from the hands of Sir Roderick Murchison, dated some time back, in which he states, with reference to a specimen sent home by Mr. Icely, that the precious metal is found in the Ural Mountains in a like deposit, and under similar geological con ditions ; and expresses an opinion that the western slope of the Australian Cordillera would be found highly auriferous. Here was an actual specimen of Australian gold, and the judgment of England's first geologist that it_existed in abundance on or near the spot where we stood. In September 1850, an almost invisible speck of native gold was displayed to me with evident signs of exulta tion by a resident of the Bathurst district : in July 1851, at the town of Bathurst, a single specimen of Australian"], [361, "349 THE FLYING SQUIRREL. gold, weighing upwards of one hundredweight, was exhibited to me ! December 4th. \u2014 We bade adieu to our very kind and agreeable hosts of Coombing, and started early on our return towards Sydney. This day's journey was to terminate at Brucedale, the country seat of Mr. William Suttor, member for Bathurst, about eight miles from that town. Threading the usual number of gum-trees, we performed a very satisfactory day's journey, wholly without accident, except that of his Excellency's carriage passing an hour up to the axles in a boggy bit of ground, from whence it was at length retracted by a stout cart horse borrowed from the only dray we saw on the road. The driver harnessed his beast by chain traces to the back of the vehicle ; and with one \" gee up\" the carriage was released and placed on firm ground, every article of baggage having previously been removed. This mishap arose from leaving the beaten track : the soil of the bush is usually rotten after continued wet weather. Amongst other game we saw to-day several flying squirrels. Mr. Fitz Roy succeeded in killing one with a ball from a policeman's carbine. It is a beautiful little animal ; its fur very dark coloured and soft ; and its floating mode of flight from tree to tree, supported on the membrane stretching between its fore and hind legs, is extremely graceful and singular. Our route took us once more across the Plains of Bathurst ; leaving which town on our right, and driving about four miles over those famous downs, we re-plunged into the bush, and, gradually ascending some four miles more, emerged, late in the afternoon, after a journey of"], [362, "350 OUR ANTIPODES. eleven hours, at Brucedale. The house is large and commodious, situated on a knoll which pushes itself into the midst of a richly cultivated vale, through which winds the pretty little Windburndale rivulet. The prospect is bounded, at the distance of half a mile .r thereabouts, by wooded hills, very picturesque, and making the position of the place romantically sequestered. Yet this is precisely one of the faults I find with the home scenery of New South Wales. To be shut up in a forest, with no outlet for the eye, gives me always a sense of mental suffocation. Thus situated, I should never lay down the axe until I had obtained a vista of sufficient extent to take a long breath in. On the summit of one of the ridges enclosing Bruce dale, there is a singular agglomeration of granite rocks, called the Woolpacks, \u2014 a name as obvious to the squatter who bestowed it, as appropriate to the objects named. I had an opportunity of visiting these singular crags, \u2014 great cubic blocks, piled so loosely one upon another as almost to shake in the wind. The detritus of these hills affords excellent soil for the vine. The climate also favours it; and whereas this plant, though stimulative and assuasive of human thirst, is itself not greedy of moisture, there will doubtless be good wine produced here some day, for the grapes are beautiful. If my gustative acumen is worth anything, that day had not arrived in 1846. In 1850, when I had the pleasure of visiting Brucedale again, it had certainly dawned, if not reached its meridian. Near the Woolpacks we found two kinds of natural bush-fruit, growing in great plenty on the uplands, \u2014"], [363, "QUAILS AND MANNA IN THE WILDERNESS. 351 namely, the \" five corners,\" produced by a beautiful species of fuchsia after the fall of the blossom, and the geebung, a native plum, very woolly and tasteless. With regard to the former flower, the children of Mr. Suttor taught me to find at the bottom of each calyx a single drop of the richest honey-water. We sipped together some hundreds of these fairy cups of hydromel. Depending from some of the larger gum-trees were the most enormous mistletoes I ever saw. One or two of the clusters of this parasite were so uniform in shape as to look like a huge oval chandelier of bronze, (for that was their colour,) hanging plumb down from some slender twig. In the lowlands here, as at Coombing, the Eucalyptus mannifera, or Flooded gum, grows in great profusion and to a majestic size. It sounds strange to English ears, \u2014 a party of ladies and gentlemen strolling out in a summer's afternoon to gather manna in the wilderness. Yet more than once I was so employed in Australia. This substance is found in small pieces on the ground under the trees at certain seasons, or in hardened drops on the surface of the leaves. It is snowy white when fresh, but turns brown when kept, like the chemist's drug so called, sweeter than the sweetest sugar, and softer than Gunter's softest ice-cream. The manna is seldom plentiful ; for birds, beasts, and human beings devour it, and the slightest rain, or even dew, dissolves its delicate components. Theories have been hazarded and essays published as to the origiu of this singular substance ; but whether it be formed by the puncture and deposit of an insect, or is the natural product of the"], [364, "352 OUR ANTIPODES. tree, no one, I believe, can venture to assert. Nor was there wanting hereabouts another special article of the heaven-sent food of the wandering tribes of Israel ; for hundreds of quails were to be found within a few paces of the manna-fields. Mr. William Suttor is one of the second generation of the name settled in the colony. A third is rising pretty rapidly. His father, a venerable and highly intelligent gentleman, whose acquaintance, also, I had the pleasure of making on this occasion, having established himself originally on an estate granted to him by Government, near Paramatta, sent forward his son, still in his teens, to superintend the squatting stations in the Bathurst district. In like manner, the branches, as well as the property, of the family having subsequently increased, some of the younger scions are now about to join a party of other youths on an expedition to seek for locations for flocks and herds, and to take charge of them when established, on the Bargan River, far in the interior. Our host, who appears to be one of those men well calculated to grapple with difficulties, and to make none, gave me some interesting details connected with his early occupation of the country. Surrounded with convict servants, and with numerous tribes of the Aborigines, he never had any trouble with either. Doubtless, his treatment of both was firm, just, and consistent. The mutual relations of these two classes were, however, not so peaceable. Frequent collisions took place, in which blackey of course fared the worst; yet, on one occasion, no less than seven white men fell under their spears."], [365, "A DINNER, A DANCE, AND A DESERTER. 353 Not so favourably impressed with the qualities of assigned prisoner servants was the lady of Brucedale. In the occasional absences of her lord from home in those days, she passed many an hour of uneasiness and fear, lest these already branded knaves should break out into the commission of some dreadful outrage. Mr. Suttor, on the final discussion of the transportation question by the Legislative Council in 1850, spoke strongly and voted as an \" anti.\" Our late host, Mr. Icely, who is a nominee member, or one appointed by the Government, voted as a \" pro.\" Both, as far as I know, are educating their families with a view to per manent settlement in the colony ; and they seem some what similarly situated as to property and pursuit. Mr. Suttor possesses very considerable property in land and live-stock; and has discovered copper, lead, and even indications of gold on his estate. He prudently contents himself, however, at present, with the super ficial produce of the earth. A party of some thirtyr-five ladies and gentlemen from Bathurst and the neighbourhood dined at Brucedale this day to meet the Governor ; and about forty more came to a dance in the evening. During the dinner, I found myself very assiduously waited on by a servant belonging to a gentleman present. His face was familiar to me ; but where, when, or how we had met before I had no recollection. During the noise and bustle occasioned by the ball, he drew near me, and, whispering, said, \" Don't you know me, Sir? Don't you remember James ? I was six years in your company in the 43d.\" I immediately recalled to mind that this man had VOL. i. z"], [366, "354 OUR ANTIPODES. been transported for life by a general court-martial, for deserting from the regiment at Niagara during the Canadian rebellion in 1838. In 1846, I (the Deputy Judge Advocate, as it happened, of the court which tried him) find the disgraced and dishonoured soldier, who was \" marked with the letter D, and transported as a felon for the term of his natural life,\" now the trusted, well-paid, and well-fed domestic servant of a wealthy colonist ! Is not this fact a direct premium for \" mutiny, desertion, and all other crimes,\" for which transportation is awarded by a military tribunal ? How this fellow and felon must chuckle over the loyal soldier who toils through the world, following his colours, for Is. a-day, while he gets his 20/. or 30/. a-year, food, and lodgings, and can go where he lists over this wide continent, \u2014 to which thousands of the poor and honest labourers of England would joyfully repair, could they afford the cost of passage and outfit, both of which were furnished to this criminal at the public expense ! Reformation, I admit, is one of the intended results \u2014 the best, perhaps \u2014 of transportation ; but example is also requisite ; and unquestionably this man's improved condition by \"deser tion before the enemy\" (for American \"sympathisers\" were the worst enemies a soldier could have to deal with !) is a somewhat dangerous fact for discussion in a barrack-room, when duties happen to be heavy or officers severe. Mr. Deserter was very much inclined for conversation with his former captain ; but I told him, that, as an officer in her Majesty's service, I could hold no communication with one who had forsaken his colours and broken his oath."], [367, "MILITARY CONVICTS. 355 This individual had at least been caught, tried, and quasi punished; but it has been my lot to encounter and recognise several times in foreign countries soldiers in a state of desertion, who had never been captured, and who could afford to laugh in the face of their former officer. I have seen th^m in private service, as thriving settlers, as miserable beggars, as musicians in theatres, and as bandsmen \u2014 as well as in the ranks \u2014 of the United States army. The left-hand man of my own company wheeled my baggage by my side as porter of an Ameri can hotel, just a quarter of a mile from the British out posts in Upper Canada. Ruxton mentions that he met deserters from our army on the far prairies of the Kansas River, harbouring with the Shawnees and Kickapoo Indians. I heard myself of such men domiciled with the New Zealand savages, married to Maori women, and tattooed like the barbarians. Military crimes are thought nothing of in New South Wales. Men who have been transported for com mitting such are high in the labour market and eagerly sought for. A wide distinction is drawn between him whom a breach of discipline has made a felon, and him who has gained that title through a civil court for robbery, burglary, perjury, forgery, or other offences against society at large. The soldier who, once or twice a year, scales the barrack walls and makes away with his kit in order to raise funds for a nocturnal spree, aud in a paroxysm of pot-valour trips up the heels of the fat sergeant who is testing his sobriety by putting him through his facings ; \u2014 or who punches or threatens to punch the head of the corporal of the picquet which z 2"], [368, "356 OUR ANTIPODES. captured him \u2014 is, in the martinet's eye\u2014 indeed iu that of every good soldier \u2014 a terrible and unpardonable delinquent. Perhaps when grown a year or two older and wiser, the very qualities of spirit and flesh which induced these disorders would render him eligible for the posts of constable, policeman, overseer, watchman, or such other as a Colonial Government or private employer, in times of scarcity of labour, has great difficulty in filling. This very scarcity and dearness of labour, which has subsisted for so many years in the colony, and which certainly did not decrease during the five years of my sojourn there, present a powerful temptation to desert. Crimps are active and unscrupulous; and when a half drunken private, known to be a tolerable handicrafts man, is promised ensign's or even lieutenant's pay \u2014 and moreover gets it; what wonder that he should forget the obligations he entered into in his attestation ? And should his conscience afterwards urge him to return to his allegiance, he can only do so through the gates of a military court. He has had a taste of liberty ; and finds it difficult to stomach the idea of guard-rooms and courts-martial, imprisonment, or perhaps a sentence to transportation which condemns him to work in irons with a gang of thieves. The facility with which, up to a very late period, soldiers transported to these colonies obtained in Van Diemen's Land, while serving their terms, appointments of trust and emolument under Government, was so notorious, that several men committed felonies with the express and privately avowed purpose of relieving"], [369, "DELINQUENTS REFORMED. 357 themselves from their military responsibilities by becom ing convicts. When this trick became somewhat stale and apparent, however, one or more of the performers were met by a sentence of the lash, followed by im prisonment with hard labour, in lieu of transportation ; and in 1849 the present Governor of the latter colony, at the instance of the local military authorities, signified publicly his intention to carry out to the full extent the sentence awarded by a court-martial in such cases \u2014 where transportation was awarded \u2014 granting the prisoner neither passes, tickets-of-leave, nor other indulgences. I met with, in this colony, more than one deserter or other delinquent from our military service, who, having served the period of their sentence, are now doing well and living as respectable and useful citizens. But there was one case that came to my knowledge, so singular that I am tempted to insert a notice of it here, rather than admit it in its more strictly appropriate place; because I am unwilling to point too directly to the person alluded to. In 1850, when proceeding with my wife on an ex cursion into the provinces, a gentleman recommended us to pass a day or two at a certain rural inn, where the climate was considered cool, and where, as he said, \" Old John , the waiter, will take excellent care of you, and make you very comfortable, if you mention my name.\" Accordingly we soon became very good friends with John, whom we found to be a little weazened old fellow, quick and intelligent, although evidently declin ing in strength, most attentive to our comforts, a first rate cook (for he performed that office in the absence"], [370, "358 OUR ANTIPODES. of the hired one), and full of amusing anecdotes and proverbs a la Sancho. I fear that I must admit that, with all his estimable qualities, rogue was so indelibly written in his countenance, that although it behed his present character, it was still impossible to look in old John's face and feel (however one might place) implicit trust in him. I knew nothing of his history further than that it had been an adventurous one; and one evening while sitting over our tea, which the old fellow had embellished with some regular English-inn buttered toast, I asked him to give us his history \u2014 for he had just told me that he had served \" a little \" in the army. He was nothing loth ; and I took down the following \" Autobiography of a New South Wales Waiter,\" nearly in his own words ; nor have I since taken the trouble to test his dates and facts. \" I was born,\" began John, \"in the island of North Shetland, and was, as early as I can remember, and long before I could lift an oar, employed in the ling fishing trade. In 1806-7, I was in Greenland, where I served a short apprenticeship in whaling. In 1808, when at North Scalloway, plying in my father's boat, I was pressed by a man-of-war's tender. I ran from the press-gang the very same day, and went and en listed with a party of artillery stationed in the fort. Marched with them shortly afterwards to Aberdeen, and was employed there and at Glasgow recruiting, for some time. Being considered too short for the artillery, I was transferred to the 1st Royals, and joined their 4th Battalion in December 1S08, on their return from Corunna.

Thence we went by water to Santarem ; afterwards to Thoinar. I was at the battle of Busaco, and the subsequent retreat to the Lines. In 1811 I was present at the affairs of Pombai and Sabugal ; at Almeida, Fuentes d'Onor, Cuidad Rodrigo ; at the siege and capture of Badajos ; at Salamanca, where I received a bad sabre wound in the side ; at Madrid and Burgos, and the retreat from the latter. I was at Lamego and Visu, (but these were mere skrimmages !) at Vittoria, St. Sebastian \u2014 where I was shot through the thigh, and taken prisoner by a sortie wdiile reconnoitring the horn-work and breach; \u2014 this was 21 July, 1813. Was retaken on the 31st August, when the place fell. I lay for some time in hospital at Santander and Bilboa ; but I was young and strong, and my wound soon healed. I was fit for duty, and present at the sortie of Bayonne. \"In 1815 I embarked at Cork for the Netherlands with the 3d Battalion of the Royals.

Vessel and freight were worth, I suppose, 3,000/. \" Being now totally ruined, I accepted the post of supercargo to a vessel trading to New Zealand; and whilst in that country I lost the use of my limbs from rheumatism. Returning to New South Wales, having once more saved a little money, I rented a farm on the Kurrajong Hills, but the main road from Sydney to Bathurst was diverted from it by the Government ; the caterpillars devoured my crops, and I was compelled to give up the lease.

When I left the colony, I ascertained that the old man had quitted the public line, and had be come major-domo and factotum to an opulent squatter. The narrative is as he gave it to me. Subsequently accident enabled me to fill up one or two of the many hiatus which self-esteem naturally in clined this much-by-fortune-buffeted Shetlander to leave in his autobiography. In a casual conversation with one of the judges of the land, I was made cognisant of John's second entrance into the bonds of matrimony, as well as other bonds. It appears he wooed and wedded one of his own feather, who shortly afterwards was con victed in the colony of being principally, while the hus band was proved to be secondarily, engaged in a grand robbery of ardent spirits. What became of his better half I did not inquire, but my respectable old friend paid a compulsory visit to the two sequestered islands of Cockatoo and Norfolk. His Honour who pronounced the sentence was nevertheless so much impressed with the many valuable qualities of the exile, that, after seven years of probation, he procured his return to New South Wales. Even in Norfolk Island itself his talents did not remain under a bushel; for the officers of the detachment found out his cooking qualifications, and John was once more engaged at a military mess. The above is a long story \u2014 here is a short one, on the subject of convict servants, just as it was related to me by a friend holding an exalted office in one of the Australian colonies.

They are soon haltered, saddled, and bridled, by fair means or foul; for the Australian horses are generally good tempered, and besides, no option is allowed them. The chestnut is a capital hack but a little stale in the fore-legs, for he is a favourite stock-horse, and has passed the greater part of his life at full gallop over ground as hard as the floor of a racket court. Moreover he happens to have only one shoe on, and that a hind one;\u2014 mere trifle!

The weather was beautiful, and we enjoyed a delightful excursion across the plains past Alloway Banks, a pretty cottage residence belonging to the Suttor family, and into the town of Bathurst, where we visited the barracks of the infantry detachment and of the mounted police, the Government cottage, now the quarters of the officer commanding the troops, and other public buildings. The subsequent reduction of the force in New South Wales has deprived Bathurst of the advantages social and financial of a military garrison. Bathurst must have been an excellent and agreeable station for an officer who knew how to maintain his position, select his society, and who had some few more elevated re sources than smoking and drinking brandy and water.

If he chance to be young and pliant, his barrack room soon becomes the estaminet of all the idlers and ne'er-do-wells of the neighbourhood ! If such happened sometimes at Bathurst, it is not the only place in Australia, nor in other colonies, where the like occurs. I purchased at this town a pound of gunpowder and a pair of kid gloves-\u2014 paying 10s. 6d. for the lot \u2014 expensive, certainly, but not exorbitant, perhaps, when the cost and risk of importation is taken into account. I wonder whether the well-dressed ladies who graced the ball at Brucedale, last night, provided themselves at proportionate prices with all the white satin shoes, gloves, silks, muslins, blondes, tulles, ribbons and flowers which are necessary to the composition of what the newspapers style \"an elegantly attired female!\" If so, there must be a good deal of boiling-down to maintain the pin-money ! December 1th. \u2014 G. F. and myself, with a small Aboriginal boy as guide, repaired this afternoon to seek for snipe in a swampy valley not far off, and, for New South Wales, had a very good two hours' sport. My bag contained seven couple of those birds, a wild duck, and four brace of quail. One of the pleasantest passages of the sport was to count the teeth of the black lad, as he grinningly picked up a pair of widgeons which my com panion and I respectively and simultaneously brought down on his head, as they skimmed over the tops of a clump of gum-trees. The floods were very much out \u2014 so were the sun and the mosquitos. I don't know that I was ever, in a short"], [378, "366 OUR .\\NTIPODES. time, so burnt, bitten, and wet through at once.

It was truly a disreputable looking carriage when I turned it over \u2014 for the last time, fortunately ! to Mr. Martyn, coach-builder, Sydney. Widow Jones' is a comfortable road-side inn, beau tifully situated at a place called Green Swamp, just where the Blue Mountains trend gently down into the Plains of Bathurst. Just beyond Diamond Swamp we cheated the Surveyor-general and turned his flank, at least in so far as he is identified with the awful passage over Mount Lambey, by taking the line of Piper's Flat, a fine alluvial oasis in the midst of hills, covered with rich grass and watered by a beautiful stream, on the banks of whk-h the well-fed cattle seemed almost to stagger under their fat.

The Governor and Lady Mary, and others of the party, accepted the invitation of the proprietor to remain for the night at Wallerawong, while Mr. Fitz Roy, myself, and the officer of mounted police, guided by Black George, a native scout of that force, made a moonlight ride of eight miles to the hotel above mentioned, of comfortable memory.

Of the surface peculiarities of the Sydney society, I shall say but little. There is a feature of deeper VOL. I. A A"], [382, "370 OUR ANTIPODES. importance to which I am pleased to be able to bear testimony. I have visited no part of the world where there appears to exist so much of universal competence, so much equality of means, if such were possible. There must be very few individuals in New South Wales spending 1,000/. a-year upon the ordinary appliances of living ; there must be equally few who cannot afford a sufficiency of good clothing, bread and meat and firing for themselves and families every day of the year. The barometer of domestic finance has but few degrees on its scale. No one in health can be at the zero of indigence, and scarcely any will burn like Dives, for the same cause. In spite of the occasional grumblings of discontent on the subjects of the \" exhausted resources,\" the \" paralysed energies,\" the \" universal insolvency,\" and the \" downfall of the colony ! \" \u2014 there exists, in New South Wales, an amount of comfort and happiness for which its people ought to be most thankful. If there be, however, a general sufficiency of means for subsistence, there is not enough for display ; nor, after the lesson which was taught by the general break down of 1841, is there much danger of the good folks suffering a relapse of that malady \u2014 so long, at least, as the impression of its ravages is visible as a warning. The shopocracy of Sydney are a very thriving class, many of them keeping carriages and riding horses, possessing handsome villas and gardens in the suburbs, and even landed property in the provinces. I have heard the society of Sydney accused \u2014 I have"], [383, "371 SYBNET SOCIETY. heard them accuse themselves, of an addiction to scandal and tittle-tattle ; and I dare say, many persons who know the city quite as well as myself, will disagree with me when I exonerate the good people in general from those vices, or at least from possessing it in an inordinate degree. In New South Wales there is no aristocracy, properly so called, no hereditary idlers, no pensioned dowagers, no half-pay loungers, few widows or unmarried elders of either sex ; \u2014 all are working people, from the Governor downwards. There is, therefore, I think, less backbiting and gossiping, less amiable unea- siness about other persons' affairs, than are generally to be found at an English watering place or country town. Except at the very earliest stage of my acquaint- ance with Sydney, its social atmosphere appeared to me singularly calm and placid. On that one occasion, indeed, it was convulsed in all its elements \u2014 from the representative of majesty to the printer's devils of the press \u2014 by a sudden and determined attempt to cause to be erased from the list of the 11, or 12,00 occasional visitors at Government-house the names of two or three persons far advanced in years and much esteemed by those who knew them, who in the somewhat lax infancy of the colony had, it was said, taken on themselves parental responsibilities without due regard to ritual ; but who had long since submitted to its yoke, and had reared for their adopted country one and two generations of excellent and estimable citizens. Truly, at this juncture, such was the social uproar, such the disunion, ill-blood, and recrimination, that, at first, I feared that in venturing to Sydney I had stumbled a a 2"], [384, "372 OUR ANTIPODES. into some hot-bed of active and fearful dissipation ! Whether, as a bachelor, I was disappointed or relieved on finding out my mistake, is of no consequence. At any rate I was as much amused as I was able to be with a circumstance involving as much cruelty as absurdity ; and I could not but congratulate the com munity upon the fact, that, in order to find, a flaw in its immaculateness, it had been necessary to rake up again to the surface frailties that had been forgotten, and had, as it were, become fossilized by the lapse of ages ! As far as I know, this was the only serious crusade against character that occurred in my time. I repeat, therefore, my opinion, that the society of Sydney is not censorious. In the cool weather this society meets together very pleasantly at dinner parties of ten to fourteen, and at soirees dansantes of one hundred to three hundred per sons. The really splendid rooms of Government-house, during the same season, receive a vast number of guests at dinners of twenty to thirty persons, and at balls at which are assembled from two hundred to twelve hundred persons, the latter number being, I think, something under that of the cards of invi tation issued on her Majesty's birthday. The lamentable death of Lady Mary Fitz Roy was in this point, as in every other, an irreparable misfortune to the colony. Her high rank and intimate relations with the most refined circles of the Old Country gave her advantages, as the leader of society, such as none of her predecessors, however estimable their qualities, had pos sessed. Gentle, kind, charitable, affable, accessible, and"], [385, "373 THE MARRIAGE MARKET. gifted with a quiet dignity, which must be innate and can neither be acquired nor assumed, her influence \u2014 had she been spared \u2014 could not have failed to blend and reconcile the crude and discordant elements of a young and growing community. The sudden loss of this much esteemed lady, aggravated as it was by the deplorable accident that caused it, not only made Government house \u2014 in all colonies the great centre of society \u2014 a house of mourning for a lengthened period ; but was, and has ever since continued to be, felt as a grievous public bereavement and misfortune. In spite of the worthy Colonial Secretary's statistics, which tend to prove the still existing undue numerical proportion of males over females in the colony generally, the fair sex preponderates very largely in the ball-rooms of Sydney. The brothers and sons of those pretty girls and respectable matrons are, one must suppose, pushing their fortunes in the Bush or elsewhere ; and, were it not for the officers of the staff and garrison, and now and then a lucky influx of naval men. the young ladies might live unpaired \u2014even for the fugitive engagement of a quadrille or valtz. Viewed as a marriage market New South Wales must at present be set down as decidedly and shockingly bad. A speculative young woman emigrating, without capital, in the hope of securing an establishment for life, will no more succeed than would the young man without funds make a livelihood by coming out as a squatter. In former days, indeed, when times were good and wool remunerative, the prosperous settler, tired of solitude, and desiring with Paul Richter \" to find a gentle girl"], [386, "374 OUR ANTIPODES. who could cook something for him, and who would sometimes smile and sometimes weep with him,\"\u2014 \" A creature not too bright and good Por human nature's daily food :\" desirous, in a word, of assistance and sympathy in the loneliness of the bush \u2014 repaired to the metropolis in deliberate and determined quest of the article desiderated. But the reverses of the colony made men cautious, and unluckily for the ladies they still continue so. Sen timental impulse seems to have utterly stagnated ! Perhaps many of the fair damsels have souls above damper and bark huts. Perhaps some of them really prefer celibacy. Be this as it may, 1 see numbers of nice girls still performing the very natural and graceful duties of daughters, without any apparent prospect of engaging in woman's main mission. Perhaps, as I said before, they prefer celibacy. But, admitting the possibility of there being one or two dear little creatures who do not prefer that state, it is painful to me, who have a soft heart (I write as a married man !) to see the vine, the honey suckle, the passion-flower, stretching out their delicate tendrils, and finding, alas ! no responsive oak or elm to lend its firm and permanent support ! Strange to say, too, the well brought up and pretty maidens of the middle and servant classes of Sydney do not appear to be much sought in marriage. Yet it is undoubtedly in these classes that the well-known preponderance of males exists. The single men do not want wives, and the responsibilities and encumbrances of family life. They prefer working hard \u2014 working like, slaves \u2014 four or five days, and \" larking\" the rest of the week."], [387, "MILITARY MEN MARR1 AGEABLE, OR NOT? 375 One day, in conversation with an old Qui Hi, I was contrasting New South Wales with India as a field of speculation in the above line for the more educated orders ; when I was surprised to hear that things have altered since my time. Since the adoption of the over land route between England and Hindostan, would-be Benedicts go home by steam, and bring back to the east Hyperborean brides, with the rose of England fresh on their cheeks, instead of supplying themselves, as for merly, on the spot. It results from the circumstances I have above noticed, that in Australia, as in other dependencies of the Crown, the members of the martial professions are more graciously regarded in the light of possible husbands and sons- in-law, than they are known to be in the Old Country. There is a vulgar old-fashioned notion among all classes at home \u2014 for which some of the ancient novel and play-writers may be thanked \u2014 that, if the private soldier be notoriously a \"rascal in red,\" the officer must be a dicer, a drinker, and a ruffler \u2014 capable of jilting a woman and bilking a turnpike \u2014 a perpetrator of \" broken oaths, and hearts, and heads,\" and of every intermediate enormity between chuck-farthing and manslaughter; \u2014 or, what is worse, a pauper !

Luckily we have the softer and more influential sex on our side ; \u2014 although occasionally \"a malignant and a turbaned\" chaperon, having a pretty and wealthy daughter or ward, will turn against us and \"traduce the state\" of our morals, finances, and intentions. The \" scor pion\" in England becomes in the colonies an \" eligible !\" As the close application to business, rendered neces sary by the badness of the times, has operated as a deterrent from matrimony among the colonial gentlemen ; perhaps it is the great amount of leisure enjoyed, or rather forced, upon individuals of my profession in this country, that has given the combined forces of Cupid and Hymen such an advantage over them. The shafts which glance harmless off the rhinoceros hide of the money-hunting merchant and the wool-gathering squatter, have transfixed the unoccupied heart and secured the unemployed hand of many a son of the sword in New South Wales and the neighbouring colonies \u2014 to a greater degree perhaps than occurs in any other of the five and forty dependencies of Great Britain.

Not a few of these open-hearted fellows, rendered doubly susceptible by long deprivation of female society, have fallen in love, and into a proposal, with some fair Aus tralian \u2014 some lily of the Pacific. And, as their mission into these seas by \" their lordships\" in Whitehall does not comprise a clause for the replenishment of the popu lation, and the inexorable rules of the service forbid domestic felicity on board ship, the consummation of these tender engagements are necessarily deferred \" sine die\" \u2014 to the injury of society at large by the withdrawal, total or partial, of the plighted fair one from the world ; a practice which I hereby anathematize and hold up to public reprobation !

In these colonies,"], [390, "378 OUR ANTIPODES. and especially in New South Wales, there is no shoot ing or hunting, usually so rife in countries without game laws; nor any other safety valves for exuberant vitality,\u2014 while all the less innocent pastimes common to large towns, and seaport towns in particular, ex tend their temptations to young men of leisure and spirit. I err in saying that there is no hunting. There was none near Sydney when I first arrived. Formerly some approaches were made to an imitation of the good old English sport of fox-hunting; for your Briton generally contrives, in obstinate resist ance to climate and circumstances, to carry about with him the customs and pursuits of the Mother-land. The mere non-existence of the fox in this country \u2014 the play of Hamlet, with the part of Hamlet left out by particular desire ! \u2014 presented no obstacle to the perform ance of fox-hunting by her Majesty's servants in New South Wales. As the jackal obligingly undertook at the shortest notice that character in Hindostan, so, in Australia, the dingo, or native dog, \u2014 (you may see a fine specimen in the London Zoological Gardens,) \u2014 was not permitted, through any diffidence on his part, however natural, to decline the performance of the part of fox to the best of his ability. And truly he is no bad sub stitute. The Cumberlaud Hunt was only a matter of history when I reached the colony. It was left for Mr. George Fitz Roy to establish a regular pack, well turned out, master and whippers in \" pink and skins,\" fixtures advertised, and everything orthodox. The country is as inimical to fox-hunting as can well be conceived ; wide tracts of dense forest, salt creeks,"], [391, "THE FITZ ROY HOUNDS. 379 impracticable ravines, a hard, sandy, scent-repelling soil, and in the cleared and enclosed ground three and four railed fences of hon bark and other unmanageable timber, which might well appal the stoutest heart \u2014 if not break the toughest neck \u2014 that ever put a nag at a fence or tumbled over it. Now and then occurred such slight incongruities as the master, servants, and field coming home with only half-a-dozen hounds out of the twenty couple, and sometimes without a single card of the pack \u2014 -during which absence of the proper autho rities some uneasiness could not but be felt as to the nature of the prey fourteen or fifteen couple of hungry hounds might happen to pick up in their uncontrolled course. Not unfrequently indeed, when legitimate game was scarce, and when the woody nature of the country favoured an outbreak, the mottled conspirators would \"run into\" some stray sheep-dog before they could be whipped off; or, on the way home, woidd \"walk into\" some old lady's fat lap-dog \u2014 the latter a species of \"riot,\" which, while outwardly condemning it, gave me, I confess, unmitigated satisfaction.

Later in the day he is laid up in some rocky bank; and the sun quickly dispels the scent so strong while the turf is yet damp. I beg to insert a short account of a run with this pack, which I joined in and reported to a newspaper. \" Sporting Intelligence.\u2014 Mr. Fitz Roy's hounds had a brilliant run on Saturday last, the 5th of June. The fixture was Vineyard, the seat of H. Macarthur, Esq.; the hour five a.m. On being thrown into covert, the hounds almost immediately unkenneled a fine dingo, which made off at a good pace along the north bank of the river towards Kissing Point. Owing to the dryness of the ground the scent was not very good, but after a slight check the pack hit it ofi' again on the swampy land near the river, carrying it breast high through Mrs. Bowermau's grounds, and across alternate scrub and cleared land till they reached the cross road to Pennant Hill wharf. Here Renard, hard pressed, turned his head northward, and, skirting the road, gave the field \u2014 most of whom had lost ground in the dense bush \u2014 an opportunity to retrieve lee way by racing up this woodland lane. Close at his brush the pack pushed him across the Paramatta-road and through a long rough dingle, without giving him a moment's breathing time, into a large grass paddock of forty or fifty acres, thinly dotted with acacia bushes, the horsemen charging several stiffish flights of rails crossing the country at right angles with the dingle ; until dingo, hounds, and field together, reached the paddock above mentioned, in the middle of which the pack fairly coursed up to"], [393, "381 SPORTING' INTELLIGENCE. him and pulled him down, not a single hound having lost his place. A party of farming people who were working in a field hard by, hearing the whoo-whoop ! joined in the ceremony of breaking up, and appeared highly delighted at this realization in Australia of the good old field sports of the Mother country. \" This capital run occupied twenty-six minutes ; the pace in the low grounds was very fast, and the fences were of a less impracticable nature than is usual in this country. At one point a field of British fox-hunters found themselves in the somewhat uncommon predica ment of thrusting through a dense scrub of burnt wattle-bushes, about the height of hop-poles, to the great disfigurement of white leathers ; and at another charging, at full cry, over hedges of lemon and through alleys of orange-trees, laden with fruit. \" As the worthy master trotted home through Para matta with a white tagged brush peeping out of his pocket, the dingo's head hanging from the whipper-in's saddle, and the hounds following with blood-smeared muzzles, an old fellow, who looked like a retired earth stopper from the old country, exclaimed, \"Well, d me, but this looks like work !\" Mr. Fitz Roy's kennel is at the Governor's country place, Paramatta. But he brings the hounds to Sydney during the session of the Legislative Council in the winter months ; and the sport is here conducted on the stag-hunting principle. In this case getting up by candle-light is not necessary. The certainty of a find is secured by means of the bag ; and, if the dingo should have lost scent by domestication, which is often the case"], [394, "382 OUR ANTIPODES. if long confined, a souprton of aniseed supplies the want. If not added with moderation, so powerful is the odour of this drug that the riders themselves may almost carry the scent breast high. The Botany Swamps are usually the locale of the fixtures. There are but few fences, but the country is covered with a short shrubby bush, in some places rising into thickets \u2014 not unlike the grouse-moors of North Britain \u2014 a similitude noticed by old Cook. As the pace is generally good, the necessary amount of excitement is procured, in the absence of fences, by rushing blindly through the brush, or clearing it at a bound. I have seen some really tolerable tumbles and divorcements of horse and rider on these occasions. The worst accident that can happen is getting bogged. Sometimes in hunting before sunrise a kangaroo is found, and, if not near a gully, affords a fast burst. Among these same sand-hills and swamps there was, in 1848, a course constructed for hurdle-racing, which was attended by immense crowds of people of all classes from the city. I hardly know why this sport was dis continued, unless it was that some terrible falls were occasioned by the stiffness of the fences and the reekless riding of the gentlemen jockies, most of whom were officers of the garrison. The honest dwellers on the swamps, too, invariably made fire-wood of the hurdles. I have little to say about the turf of New South Wales. I have occasionally seen very good running on the Homebush course, which is situated between Sydney and Paramatta, and is well attended by all classes, from"], [395, "383 THE TURF AND THE RING. the Governor of the colony down to the real lord of the soil \u2014 the Aboriginal black. The dullest feature in the Australian racing is the fact of one or two well-known horses carrying off all the prizes. I was sick and tired of hearing the \" ould horse, Jorrocks,\" cheered by his numerous and up roarious friends as he came in \" a winner,\" I do not know how many seasons in succession. The worst feature is the dishonest and scampish characters of the jockies. The same may be said of Australian pugilism. The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong. \" There is a time for all things,\" says the ancient proverb ; \" There is a price for all things,\" says the modern Solomon \u2014 a proverb not always inapplicable to the turf and ring of the old, as well as of this new, country. The latter thoroughly British pastime is in very bad repute here, and I dare say, deservedly so. The \" beaks \" and police hunt down both principals, seconds, and spectators. The guardians of the public peace and property will go any distance to break up the \"stakes and ropes,\" and catch the \"commissaries;\" while Sydney is meanwhile sacked by a juvenile mob of rioters, and the sideboards of Wooloomooloo are swept by burglars. There are no \"Corinthians\" here; and, how ever far T may agree with \"Bell's Life\" that discourage ment of the fistic art may introduce that un-English arbitrator of dispute\u2014 the knife, still I must consider it fortunate that pugilism in New South Wales has no aris tocratic supporters. Amongst the \"Pets\" and \"Chickens\" of the modern English ring there are not to be found"], [396, "384 OUR ANTIPODES. many individuals of high moral worth although some of them have attained eminence as public characters ; nor of excruciatingly polished manners \u2014 although they can \" polish off\" a customer in \" a brace of shakes \" \u2014 as the saying is. It is needless to hint that your Botany Bay \"Slasher,\" or your Hobart Town \" White Headed Bob \" \u2014 con sidering the probable causes of their excursion to these colonies \u2014 are hardly likely to add lustre to the pro fession of the noble art. The authorities seem fully to appreciate this fact. One reason, perhaps, for the little popularity of pugilism, even among the lowest orders of this purely English colony, may be that fistic encounters are here often fatal\u2014 so often as to lead to the suppo sition that the climate may have something to do with it. In reference to this subject, I find a note in my diary of a talk I had one day with a blacksmith on the Para matta-road, in whose forge I had taken shelter from a shower. On my remarking that the name and sign had been lately removed from a large roadside tavern oppo site his shop, he told me that the licence had been taken from the landlord on account of a man having been killed in a boxing match on the premises. The worthy son of Vulcan favoured me with a really sensible lecture on the effects of climate and intemperance. \" Drink is the ruin, body and soul, of the people of this country,\" said he. \" With a pint of East Indy rum inside, and a burning sun like this outside, any little accident will finish a man.

You might as well blow out his brains at once as give him a heavy back-handed fall.\" This \" harmonious blacksmith \" was in excellent health himself, which he attributed to sobriety and good temper. The thermometer must have ranged at about 90\u00b0 in the shade, and he was thundering away at his anvil with a twenty-pound hammer, and within a yard or two of a tremendous furnace. He would not be pitied, however, insisting upon it that the forge heat kept out the heat of the climate. This is the right stuff to make a prosperous emigrant of. Strength of arm, cheerfulness of spirit, sobriety and good sense, must command success in this country \u2014 or any other where the trades are not overstocked. The converse ensures rapid ruin. In the absence of game near Sydney, inveterate shooters engage sometimes in pigeon matches, but these birds being expensive here, aud the real blue-rock seldom attainable, the purveyors for the trap occa sionally substitute parrots, which at some seasons are easily caught in sufficient numbers. The English bird fancier's feelings will be shocked when I tell him or her that I have seen fifty couple of these beautiful denizens of the bush \u2014 blue, red, green, and yellow \u2014 butchered at one shooting match. In all kinds of sport\u2014 quoad destruction of animal life\u2014it is hard to say where cruelty begins and ends.

Moreover, if they fish in their shirts for coolness sake, they are not unlikely to have their shoulders and arms blistered by the sun. Shark-hunting was the only kind of fishing in New South Wales that I thought worthy the trouble. I propose to give a specimen of a day's sport in this line. If there is one luxury greater than another in a hot climate, one exercise more healthy than another, it is bathing. Until late in the year 1849 it might be enjoyed to perfection at Sydney. There is a bathing cottage at Government-house, there is a large hulk moored and fitted as a public bathing-house in Wooloomooloo Bay, and every villa near the harbour possesses a like convenience. A shady bank of the Domain called the Fig-tree is the favourite bathing-place of the populace. Although large sharks had more than once been caught far up the harbour, no accident was ever heard of, and bathers swam about the coves without fear and with impunity. It was in November of the year, I think, that a dead whale was floated by some accident within Port Jackson, and was picked up and \" tried out \" by some speculating fishermen. A troop of sharks must have followed the dead fish, and, having disposed of his carcase, remained foraging near the shores round Sydney. One day a large Newfoundland dog, swim ming for the amusement of his master, near the Battery, was seized by a shark, and only regained the shore to die. The newspapers warned bathers ; but no caution"], [399, "BATHING AND SHARKS. 387 was observed until, early in December, a poor man swimming near the Fig-tree was attacked by a huge shark so near the bathing-place that another person repeatedly struck the fish with a boat-hook, thereby forcing it to release its victim. The unfortunate man was so dreadfully torn that he bled to death a few minutes afterwards. A very few days later I saw a fool hardy fellow swimming about in the very same place with a straw hat on his head and a cigar in his mouth! Soon after the destruction of the man in the Wooloo mooloo Bay, some fishermen reported that, a part of the dead whale having been carried by the tide into Botany Bay, a detachment of sharks had followed it there. An expedition against these tigers of the deep was organized while the desire of vengeance was still vivid, and I accepted an invitation to join it. We were four amateurs, with an old experienced fisherman, and a stout youth his son. We met at the \" Sir Joseph Banks Hotel,\" on the shore of the Bay, and proceeded at high tide to a spot usually frequented by sharks, and by other fish of different kinds, in a good staunch little boat furnished with sail and oars. There was plenty of tackle both for larger and smaller game ; shark hooks, as big and strong as those on which butchers hang up a sheep or calf for flaying, with stout chain lines to resist their teeth; and a graduated scale of others, suited to the capacity of jaw of schnapper, flathead, bream, &c, and adapted to their habits, whether of grovelling at the bottom like the latter fish, or hunting in mid-water for his food like the former. B b 2"], [400, "388 OUR ANTIPODES. We had an excellent day's sport, although my com panions, who had made several similar excursions, were disappointed in our want of success in seeming the largest sized sharks. This was the fault of the tackle, not of our luck. Besides the implements for securing our finny foes, there lay across the thwarts a small magazine of weapons for dispatching them when hooked \u2014 iron lances, with handles of stout ash, and long and strong iron gaffs or landing hooks. Anchoring the boats in about thirty feet water, the first operation was the baiting of the spot \u2014 locally termed \" burley-ing \"\u2014- with burnt fish, and with the eggs of sharks when any have been caught. Lines were then thrown in as far as possible from the boat, the hooks for sharks being baited at first with pieces of star-fish, and afterwards, when some of these had been caught, with huge junks of shark's flesh. The latter seemed peculiarly tempting to the sharks themselves. The huge pot-hook to which it was attached, together with a yard or two of dog-chain, were swallowed as an accompaniment too trifling to mention \u2014 much less to damp appetite. When one of the sportsmen feels a tug at his line, and judges by its energy that he has a shark for his customer, all other lines are, if possible, hauled aboard, in order that there may be no confusion and ravelling. If the fish be strong, heavy, and active, no little care is requisite to save your tackle from breakage and your quarry from escape. He who has hooked the fish holds on \u2014 like grim Death on his victim\u2014 and if you watch his face you will see powerful indications of excitement, mental and muscular. His teeth are set,"], [401, "389 A SHARK HUNT. his colour is heightened, the perspiration starts on his brow, something like an oath perhaps slips through his lips as the cord strained to the utmost cuts into the skin of his empurpled fingers. He invokes aid, and with his feet jammed against stretcher, thwart, or gun wale, gradually shortens his hold. Meanwhile the others, seizing lance and gaff-hook, \" stand by \" to assist the overtasked line, as the monster, darting hither and thither in silvery lightnings beneath the translucent wave, is drawn nearer and nearer to the surface. \" My eyes, he's a whopper !\" cries the excited young boatman. \" He's off!\" shouts another, as the shark makes a desperate plunge under the boat, and the line, dragged through the hands of the holder, is again suddenly slackened. \" He's all right, never fear \u2014 belay your line a bit, Sir, and look here,\" remarks the old fisherman. And sure enough there was the huge fish clearly visible, about ten feet under the keel of the boat, and from stem to stern about the same length as herself. \"Now, Sir, let's have him up.\" And the instant the line was taut, the shark shot upwards\u2014 his broad snout showing above the surface close to the boat. Then comes a scene of activity and animation indeed. The fish executing a series of summersets and spinnings, gets the line into a hundred twists and \" snarls,\" and if once he succeed in getting it across his jaws above the chain links \u2014 adieu to both fish and tackle. But, in the midst of a shower bath splashed up by the broad tail of"], [402, "390 OUR ANTIPODES. the shark, both lance and gaff are hard at work. He is speared through and through \u2014 his giant struggles throwing waves of bloody water over the gunwales of the little boat. The gaffs are hooked through his tough skin or within his jaws \u2014 for he has no gills to lay hold on. A shower of blows from axe, stretcher, or tiller fall on his devoted head, and, if not considered too large, heavy, or dangerous, he is lugged manfully into the centre of the boat, and threshing right and left with his tail to the last, is soon dispatched. A smart blow a few inches above the snout is more instantly fatal than the deepest stab. The \" school-shark \" is dealt with as above. But if the \" grey nurse,\" or old solitary shark be hooked, the cable is cut or the grapnel hauled on board, and he is allowed to tow the boat as he darts away with the line. The tables, however, are soon turned upon him ; and after being played, as this cruel operation in fishing is blandly styled, for awhile until some portion of his vast strength is exhausted, the line is drawn over a roller in the stern of the boat, the oars are set to work, and, towed instead of towing, the shark is drawn into some shallow cove near the shore, where his bodily powers avail him less than in deep water ; and after a fierce resistance and some little risk to his assailants, he falls a victim to their attacks. Man has an innate horror of a shark, as he has of a snake ; and he, who has frequented tropical climates, felt the absolute necessity of bathing, had his diurnal plunge embittered by the haunting idea of the vicinity of one of these sea pests, and occasionally been harrowed"], [403, "A SHARK HUNT. 391 by accidents arising from their voracity \u2014 feels this anti pathy with double force. There is, therefore, a species of delightful fury, a savage excitement experienced by the shark-hunter, that has no affinity with the philosophy of Old Isaac's gentle art. He revels in the animated indulgence of that cruelty which is inherent in the \" child of wrath ;\" and the stings of conscience are blunted by the conviction that it is an act of justice, of retribution, of duty, he is engaged in, not one of wanton barbarity. These were precisely my own sensations, when, drenched to the skin with showers of salt-water, scorched to blisters by the burning sun, excoriated as to my hands, covered with blood, and oil, and dirt, and breathless with exertion, I contemplated the corpse of my first shark. Tiger hunting is a more princely pastime. Boar hunt ing in Bengal Proper is the finest sport in the world. Fox hunting is an Englishman's birthright. The chase of the moose is excellent for young men strong enough to drag a pair of snow shoes five feet long upon their toes ; and Mr. Gordon Cumming tells you how man may follow the bent of his organ of destructiveness on the gigantic beasts of South Africa. Shark fishing is nearly the best sport to be had in New South Wales ; and affords a wholesome stimulation to the torpid action of life in Sydney. The humane or utilitarian reader will be glad to hear that the shark is not utterly useless after death. The professional fisher men extract a considerable quantity of excellent oil from the liver ; and the fins, cut off, cured and packed, be come an article of trade with China\u2014 whose people, for"], [404, "392 OUR ANTIPODES. reasons best known to themselves, delight in gelatinous food. The most hideous to behold of the shark tribe is the wobegong, or woe-begone, as the fishermen call it. Tiger shark is another of the names of this fish. His broad back is spotted over with leopard-like marks. His belly is a yellowish white. But to describe minutely so frightful a monster would be a difficult and ungracious task. Fancy a bloated toad, elongated to the extent of six or seven feet, and weighing some twenty stone ; then cut off his legs, and you have a flattering likeness of the wobegong \u2014 two of which we killed this day. A heavy sluggish fish, he lies in wait for his prey at the edge of some reef of rocks or bank of sea-weed ; swallows the bait indolently ; appears but little sensible to the titil lation of the barbed hook in his jaws ; and is lugged, hand over hand, to the slaughter without much trouble or resistance. Neither lance nor gaff will penetrate his tough hide, but a blow on the head with an axe proves instantly fatal. The schnapper affords a long and strong pull at the line ; and is considered by the colonists as one of their best table fish. We killed one to-day weighing 21 lbs. The flathead is half buried in the sand at the bottom, but bites freely ; and is, in my mind, a much better fish than the former. Our fishing-basket of this day com prised nine sharks, four schnappers, and about forty flat heads. Just opposite La Perouse's monument we saw a Black spearing the rock-cod and groper, which fish feed on the shell-fish torn from the rocks in stormy weather. The"], [405, "MONUMENT OF LA PER0USE. 393 figure of this man poised motionless on a pedestal of rock, with his spear ready to strike, the waves dashing up to his feet, was a subject for a bronze statue. This must have been the very spot where in April, 1770, two natives, armed with spears, opposed the landing of Cook and his party, \" and seemed resolved,\" as he says, \" to defend their coast to the uttermost, though they were but two and we were forty.\" The last of the Botany Bay tribe, old \" Boatswain,\" who had long been per mitted to establish his guneah in the gardens of the Banks Hotel, died a short time before the fishing occasion I have described. The monument of La Perouse stands on a cleared spot near the entrance of the bay. Fifty yards from the obelisk there is an old dead tree, on which still may be faintly traced some words of an epitaph in memory of one of the unfortunate French captain's fellow-travellers, which have since been transferred to a tombstone by its side.

On the evening of my shark hunt I had the pleasure of seeing my twenty pound schnapper at the foot of a friend's dinner table, looking something like a fine English cod-fish.

The cooks in this colony are no more cooks in the European and artistical acceptation of the term, than any one of my coats would have been a coat in the eyes of Brummel ! The word cook leads me to the subject of domestic servants in general. Of all the plagues of New South Wales, and indeed of all the Australian colonies, the household servants are the worst. There are few good and faithful \u2014 as sew skilful. One reason of this is the blameworthy indifference to character and cause of dis- charge exhibited by the employing classes \u2014 a relic, this, of the old convict system. Another cause lies in the unsettled mind of the emigrant, and his trying half a dozen trades of which he knows nothing, before he is driven to accept service. Many old colonists do not scruple to say that they prefer convicts to free servants. \" We have a greater hold upon them,\" says one. \" There are but two classes \u2014 the found-out and the unfound-out,\" mutters a cynic. A servant, holding the most responsible place, discharged in disgrace at an hour's notice and without a character, is engaged the next day in a similar post, and you have the pleasure of seeing him installed as confidential butler behind the chair of the lady or gentleman who may be entertaining you at dinner.

But, as I have said before, a cook \u2014 in the solemn signification of the word \u2014 is in New South Wales a fabulous animal \u2014 fabulous as the Bunyip of the blacks. The men-cooks are mostly ship-cooks, or stewards, dealers in cocky-leaky, sea-pie, plum-dough, and other blue water barbarisms. The she-cooks are \u2014 kitchen-maids at best. Few private dinner parties are given, or can be given in Sydney, without the attendance of a professional cook, as well as a public waiter or two. This has a singular effect in the eyes of the traveller lately arrived from England ; for in the general exercise of hospitality towards him he is led to believe that each well-found establishment has an uniform butler \u2014 white waistcoat and tie, frill, toppin, knock knees, Irish brogue, and all ; \u2014 never suspecting that this functionary is one and indivisible \u2014 the same honest and civil, but glass jingling and plate-rattling Mr. O'Coffee-Tay \u2014 price 7s. 6d. per evening\u2014 public and transferable property !

They greatly prefer engaging by the week. Not un commonly they maintain a kind of running corre spondence with the heads of some neighbouring families, and after coquetting for terms, pass over to the best bidder.

I have been myself the guest at a country house where the lady confessed that she had not only cooked the dinner, but had, with her own hands, carried the logs to the kitchen fire, while the good-man was busy sawing and splitting them in the yard. The cook had run rusty because she had been expected to do what the lady was thus compelled to do, and the man servant, her husband, had gone into the town to drink and fight, \" because the fit was on him.\" I think I must have had twenty or even thirty servants in one year, always giving the highest wages.

A tall, thin, grey -haired man, of polished exterior, next ten dered his services. He had been a solicitor in England ; had met with reverses ; was at present a tutor at a school ; could clean plate, because once he had had a service of his own. Then came a handsome, dark-eyed gaillard, with long black curls hanging over the collar of his round jacket, who threw rapid glances over the furniture and trinkets of the drawing-room \u2014 not forgetting the"], [409, "AN ASSORTMENT OF BUTLERS. 397 maidens as he passed the kitchen door \u2014 in a truly buc caneering style. He gave his name Juan da Silva, and resented any mention of references. At length we were suited. He was a highly respectable young immigrant just landed, who had served in an aristocratic family at home. \" Jeames,\" being steady, attentive, and perfectly acquainted with his duties, we were charmed with our acquisition, and congratulated ourselves on something like permanence of service, when, lo ! in less than a month he gave warning. He had made use of my house as an hotel until he could settle himself; and having at length decided in favour of the drapery line, he was in a few days duly installed behind a counter in George street. This mode of action had probably been suggested for his observance by some crafty adviser in England, and the idea is by no means bad. A gentleman's regular household is not a bad look-out post for the newly arrived, perhaps penniless, immigrant. He gets good pay, food, and lodging ; he disguises his ambitious projects under a show of zeal for his master's service ; no one suspects that he has a soul above crumb and coat brushing. On a sudden the mask is thrown off, and the tape and ribbon measurer elect stands confessed. He quits his temporary asylum, smiling inwardly at your simplicity in taking him in, and being taken in yourself^ and you are once more on the pave for a servant. In the case just mentioned, our old nurse warned us that \" tnat young fellow ain't a-going to stay ;\" and I won dered the less at his want of taste when she told me that she had one son in the ironmongery line getting fifty-two"], [410, "398 OUR ANTIPODES. guineas a-year, and another, only twelve years old, receiving at some shop 20/. and his \" diet,\" The great pleasure of shop-boys, unenjoyed by do mestic servants, consists in going at half price to the theatre, and smoking cigars ad libitum. My first coach man had learnt all the arcana of bis trade by driving a muffin -baker's cart. My second was an old worn-out, long backed, bandy-legged, and gouty man, but an excellent whip, who \"had druv the last four-oss coach between Lunnun and Huntingdon, for Muster Newman,\" and had been beat off the road by the railways. This was an immigrant at the expense of the Land Fund. He remained about a year, and then went off to California (thereby defrauding that same Fund) to dig gold, just three weeks before the gold was discovered in Australia. I may here state as a fact, that the only really steady, sober, active, and efficient coachman I had in the colony was an eman cipated convict. Another specimen of the well-selected immigrants paid for out of the territorial revenue, as an addition to the labour market, was a fine lady cook from London, 1< >'t from the service of Sir , Bart. She had plenty of money and clothes, could not work without an assistant in the kitchen, had delicate health and appetite, pre ferred solitary titbits in the kitchen to dining in the servants' hall with the rest of the household ; was glad to quit service and to set up a shop; failed, and before she had been two months in the colony had advertised to get a passage back again to England as lady's maid, or nurse to a lady returning home.

I have seen something of the helps in the Western New World. The Southern is no better off in this essential article of housewifery, although the homes of Sydney certainly have a larger allowance of what we English associate with the name of domestic comfort, than those of the Atlantic cities. I must not quit the subject of household servants without stating, that during the last year or so of our residence in New South Wales, we had a most excellent knot of servants, with whom we parted with real regret. Talking of the domestic pests of the colony, I must reserve a place for the mosquitos ; and ought to have placed them at the head of the list. Little need be said on the subject ; the mosquito is known, I dare say, in every colony and dependency of Great Britain, from the tirs of Hercules to the foot of the Hymalaias \u2014 from swamps of Hudson's Bay to the boiling springs of New Zealand. In five quarters of the globe, (if such division can exist,) has this minute enemy stabbed at my personal peace. Let me drown him in my bitterest ink ! Those lucky persons who are unacquainted with the mosquito, cannot appreciate the discomfort arising from so contemptible a cause. Reading and writing, riding and walking, eating and sleeping, by daylight and candlelight, indoors and out, during six months of the Australian year, you are hemmed in by an army of these insidious insects.

A Stoic could hardly resist scratching, however undignified the act ; a saint could hardly help swearing, however small the provocation ! But the fair lady is the mosquito's chief victim. Her ungloved hand, her unguarded shoulders, her velvet cheek, are the too tempting objects of the tiny epicures. The truculent proboscis stabs the lily skin, sheds the innocent blood; and, what is worse, plays the deuce with good looks. I believe I have said enough to enlist the sympathies of mankind in active warfare against this detestable insect. How curious its history ! The eggs of the mosquito are laid on the surface of the water. The grub disengages itself, and passes through two innoxious stages of its life in this element. In the second stage the insect lies wrapped in a thin membrane. This soon bursts ; the little water-demon draws itself out of its wrapper, stands for a few minutes on the surface, expanding its wings to dry in the sun \u2014 miniature likeness of Satan surveying the world he was about to ruin, and at length takes flight in search of adventures and- to fulfil its mission \u2014 the art of tormenting carried into practice. As the weather grows colder, the sufferer has his revenge. Although the appetite of the mosquito is as voracious as in the summer of his existence, his move ments are faint and languid, he becomes too weak to pierce the human skin, and he is seen recruiting his waning health by sipping at wine-glasses and tea-cups. The winter arrives, and the vampire that has lived so"], [413, "TARDY POSTAL INTERCOURSE. 401 long on the life-blood of others, ceases to exist. The reprieve to suffering humanity is, however, but short ; returning spring brings back with returning vegetation the mosquito in all his glory, and in countless myriads of legions. It was truly as well as forcibly remarked by an English housemaid in my family, that the mosquitos appeared to be most \" biteful \" just before the cold weather kills them. Amongst the plagues incidental to this colony I must not forget to anathematise the tardiness and uncertainty of epistolary correspondence. I could enumerate a hundred instances of results, inconvenient and per plexing, ludicrous, or truly lamentable, which have arisen, and do still arise, through the irregularity of the mails from Europe. This was more frequent and more palpable, perhaps, when the Government employed certain chosen vessels as post-office packets. These very frequently made the slowest passages in the year. The only vessels compelled under fine to sail from London on a day fixed, they were generally deeply laden, and easily beaten by lighter ships. The bulk of letters and newspapers came by the packets, but a con siderable quantity came also by other vessels. When a vessel of. later date arrived before that which sailed from England a fortnight or a month earlier, the consequences can be imagined. For instance \u2014 to begin with political events. In the first days of October, I think, in 1848, the Charlotte Jane, emigrant ship, arrives at Sydney, bringing the news of a revolution in Paris having been accomplisned , vol. i. c c"], [414, "402 OUR ANTIPODES. a provisional Government formed; the Tuileries and Palais Royal sacked; the throne burnt; and the King of the French a refugee in England ! Unprepared by any revelation of previous events, the intelligence falls like a thunder-bolt on the quid-nuncs of Australia \u2014 upon those especially whose gains depend on the peace of Europe \u2014 and more than any one upon the French Consul at Sydney, who not only held his commission (worth some 1,200/. a-year) under the ex king's hand, but had probably all his fortunes in the French funds ! Not until the 19th of the same month slopes in, at the rate of two knots an hour, the Post-office packet, Achilles, (not the swift-footed!) 133 days from the Downs, with all the public despatches, gazettes, &c, informing us that things were beginning to look some what democratical and republican in La belle France ; that the Reform Banquet was to come off at Paris on Tuesday next ; that the King intended to prohibit it, &c. There is something truly absurd in reading the sage prophecies of an old newspaper or letter which have been utterly falsified by the actual result of affairs received by a faster channel a month before ! I give a case in private life. Mrs. A , of Sydney, receives intelligence from England that her younger sister has evident prospects of becoming a mother. And it is not until several days later that a letter of much earlier date announces the not irrelevant preli minary of that beloved relative's marriage. I record an instance closely affecting myself. I received three"], [415, "STEAM COMMUNICATION. 403 letters from Miss , dated in London just eleven weeks after she had become my wife in Sydney. Steam communication has long been talked of, and it is to be hoped that Her Majesty's Australasian dominions will not long suffer the disadvantage and disgrace of being the only portion of her realm beyond the reach of this great agent. The Singapore route, which would seem to be the most favourable, will reduce the passage from London to Sydney to 62 days or thereabouts. In 1847 the nett revenue on letters conveyed between the London and Sydney Post-office was, as I am informed, 54,000/., and the colony has voted 6,000/. a-year for three years in aid of the project. The cost of establishing steam mail 'packets between Sydney and Singapore will not exceed those sums. But the completion of the Egypt, India, and Singapore line will only be an instalment of the steam due to the great southern colonies ; for it can be available only for the carriage of mails and of the few passengers who can afford the luxury of the trip \u2014 spending in a couple of months what would support them for six. There must, and will be, ere long, steam communi cation for emigration and colonization purposes between England and Australasia, direct. Time and space must be, if not annihilated, so far modified as to dimi nish the difference of distance from England to America and to Australia respectively; for who can doubt that it is the tedious length and exXpense of passage that prevents the emigrant from pitching his c c 2"], [416, "404 OUR ANTIPODES. tent in a colony of his countrymen, rather than among a nation where he will lose his individuality as a Briton ? For the conveyance of emigrants of all classes and their effects, and for the transport of merchandise, the Cape line will probably be adopted. It must not be forgotten that our right of pathway through Egypt is but permissive ; and that notices warning off trespassers on those valuable sand deserts may be posted up at any moment by the Moslem lord of the manor. Up to the day of my departure from New South Wales, nothing definitive had been done, in the way of improved postal communication, to lighten the darkness of the colony. Whilst my brother at his London club formed one of the usual circle of quid-nuncs, ready to pounce upon and appropriate an evening paper before the waiter had time to dry the copy and place it on the table, and felt aggrieved and ill-used if the 4 o'clock issue was with held from him for ten minutes \u2014 myself was compelled, on the 15th of July 1S51, to be happy in the enjoyment of the \" Times \" or \" Chronicle \" of the ides of March. For three years the colonists have been sickening with hope deferred on this point, of such vital importance to their interests and happiness. Amongst the authorities at Home there has been a great deal of vapouring about it indeed, but no steam ! It is a pleasant feature of the Australian social status, that there are no beggars : indeed it is only in the older countries that mendicancy is not only a necessity but a trade. Sydney owes this happy exemption not a little to"], [417, "405 MENDICANCY. her own charitable Institutions, supported equally by Government, and voluntary contributions by the public. But the cheapness of the common necessaries of life is no doubt the chief cause. I am speaking of street begging alone \u2014 beggary which is done to perfection in France and Ireland only, and in which England is not very far behind \u2014 beggary which haunts the traveller, and the lounger, the man of business and the man of pleasure j famine, naked ness, disease and deformity dogging your steps, running by your side, and often extorting alms by exciting feel ings rather of impatience and disgust than of humanity and sympathy. No one but he who has returned to London or Dublin after a long residence in a thriving colony can appreciate the torment of mendicant solicitation, with a concomitant desire to give, poverty of means, and fear of imposture ; nor can know the luxury of exemption therefrom. Not that the givers of alms are saved money by this freedom from street beggary, however much their feel ings may be spared ; for every now and then comes an appeal that cannot well be resisted, and of a somewhat more expensive cast than the mere dole of coppers or sixxpences. A decayed professional gentleman, with a folio full of testimonials to character ; one who not many years ago spent his thousands a-year, and \" had the honour of entertaining at my table many gentlemen of your cloth ; \" waits on you with his memorial.

He begs a loan of 5/., and refuses indignantly the prudent offer of a free gift of smaller amount. Some lady of fashion in England coolly asks the minister or other patron of Emigration for a free passage to Australia, (which she understands is one of the West Indian Islands,) as well as for a recom mendation to the Governor, in favour of \" an excellent creature, an old governess of mine.\" Her style of sing ing is out of date at home ; her voice is cracked, her French somewhat German, her health and nerves rickety. She arrives with two or three letters of intro duction, five pounds in her pocket, and as many smart evening dresses \u2014 fully expecting that before that hand some sum is spent a situation of 2 or 300/. a-year will drop from the Australian skies into her lap. In a month or two the charitable public hears of her having been \"3old up\" by her landlady for board and lodging; some worthy clergyman puts his name and mite to her \" Humbly sheweth ; \" and society supports her until she finds some employment very much less lucrative than her ill founded hopes led her to aspire to. She had better have asked in London how many families in Australia can afford to give 50/. a-year to a governess. Such is by no means a rare specimen of the persons unfairly thrown upon the charity of a poor community. In 1848 a young lad of good family, aged eighteen, with a mere schoolboy education \u2014 to which his father,"], [419, "BEZONIANS. 407 having sundry other children, could not afford to give a college finish, was deliberately sent out here with only 30/. wherewith to begin life \u2014 because this same wise parent had heard that everybody could \" get on \" in New South Wales ! He presented a letter of introduction and his card with smiling con fidence to a friend of mine, occupying a high post in the colony ; and was dumb-struck when he found that he had an excellent chance of starving. I remember some years ago purchasing for 6d. at a book-stall in Covent Garden Piazza, a little work entituled \" How to live well on 100/. a-year, and how to live like a gentleman on 150/. a-year.\" Some of the aimless emi grants I have met with here had better have stayed at home, and lived according to the statutes of that sixpenny code. Sydney was relieved of a good many \" Bezonians \" of a more impudent and pretentious order, at the first outbreak of the Californian mania in this colony. The hotel-keepers, tailors, and other tradesmen honoured with the custom of such persons, were the compulsory fur nishers of alms on these occasions, for it is needless to say that their Exodus from Port Jackson was not accom panied on their part by a \" flourish of trumpets,\" however loud might have been the \" alarums,\" when their absence was, too late, discovered. Whether they dug gold or their graves in California it little signified to the \"sufferers;\" for although the adventurers might be heard of, they were never seen again at Sydney.

He contrives one or two introductions, gets admission, as an Hon.

It is only after the total evaporation of such a visitant that sagacious persons begin to find out no one knew much about him \u2022 that his advent to New South Wales had never been well accounted for ; \u2014 and, indeed, such a visit to such a country does require some explanation. I remember that sometime in 1849 I missed from his \" pride of place,\" on the driving-box of a well turned out and beautifully driven tandem, a dashing looking person age, who from the tip of moustache to that of patent leather boot was the very perfection of point de vice. I may say I was sorry to miss him ; for somehow or other, from my boy hood upwards \u2014 in common with many another of my species \u2014 the spectacle of a tandem artistically and boldly driven always caused a certain undefined degree of pleasurable excitement. Through the medium of the Sydney papers, not many months later, we received the intelligence, that our showy friend had accepted the appointment of waiter at an hotel in San Francisco. This at first sight would appear a downhill stage in the jour ney of life; but as his employers in the gold-country doubtless came down with the \" dust\" pretty freely for his services, he is probably much better paid now than either he or his creditors ever were before. I could"], [421, "409 RE-EMIGRANTS TO CALIFORNIA. enumerate sundry other special instances of rapid wane, but in mercy to my patient reader I forbear. I may mention, however, that some of the human meteors that shot from Australia to California about this time were heard of as helping, for hire, to unload merchant vessels at the mouth of the Sacramento. The re-migration from New South Wales to California has \u2014 all things considered \u2014 been less extensive than might have been expected. Some alarm was created at first by the rush of an adventurous few ; and towards the end of 1849 the legislative council proposed measures to prevent the re-emigration to that state or elsewhere of persons who had arrived in the colony as free or assisted immigrants at the expense of the Land Fund. But the first return ships brought such discouraging accounts, as fortunately deterred all those who had wisely resolved to keep their gold-hunting intentions in reserve until the personal experience of the advance guard had given them the cue.
