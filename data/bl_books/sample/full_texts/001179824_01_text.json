Dry then your tears, and let us offer up our prayers to God, who will not desert us in this, our hour of dreadful need. 'My sweet child, my patient Evelina,' sobbed the distracted mother, pressing the form of her shivering, pale, but lovely girl still closer to her bosom, and gazing, with despairing eyes and a bursting heart, in her face, \u2022 my own loved child, can I cease to weep \u2014 can I cease to weep when I see your gradually declining looks, your poor, tender, sinking frame ; when I hear you ask for foot', and I have none to give you ?

Alas . alas I I fear that your melancholy errand has proved unsuccessful, and tbat, dreading to meet again the famished looks of your wife and child, you have been driven to commit some terrible act. Your proud and honest spirit can never endure this unmerited affliction. ' Mother, dear mother,' Raid the child, looking up in her wretched parent's countenance, with an expression of intelligence far beyond hei years, of which not more than seven had passed over her head,\" ' you cannot think ao badly of our wealthy fellow-creatures as to believe tbat they will leave ns here to perish of want.

Compas sion ! \u2014 alas 1 little is the sympathy that the wealthy have forthe miserable victims-' of poverty ; and Colonel Ormond, I fear, is one whose heart ls seldom softened to pity. Have they not stripped us of everything we had in the world \u2014 merci lessly torn the humble beds from under us? and, perhaps, before many hours have elapsed, will not allow us even the shelter of theBe bare walls, but will drive us forth, like the most degraded reptiles thatcrawltheeartb, into the bleak air, to continue to drag out a wretched existence, through the niggardly charity of strangers, or to perish, unheeded aud unpitied, by the road-side. Heaven, in mercy, look down upon us, for the gloomy prospect befoie us is too dreadful to con template.' Colonel Ormond was in London the day this cruel seizure was made, hut he returned to 1 is mansion the following day, aod Mrs. Marsden entreated her husband to seek an interview with him, and try and move him to compassion. But Marsden well knew the character of the colonel, and felt convinced :*t was by his orders the dis tress had b?eu levied upon him, therefore that it would b_ useless to appeal to him for mercy, and it was not until they had been rc any t;ours without food, excepting a scanty meal supplied to them by some of their humble neighbours, who cou id but ill afford It from their llmite I means, that he yielded to the persuasions of hiB wifa, and the pale countenance of his poor child, his darl ing Evelina, and hastened to Ormond Castle, to seek the presence of the colonel. '1 am oold \u2014 cold, mother!' s_i_ the unfortu* nate child, tiembling more violently than before, _nd her face becoming every moment more pale. Her mother threw her arms ar und her and enfolded her aa well as she could in her own _c__ty apparsl; then she led her to one corner of the room , which was more protected from the howling blast, and they both crouched down npon the floor, the most pitiable objects of misery and destitution tbat the most fertile imagination could form a just picture of. The warring elemen's conspired to render the horrors withuut more appalling. Tha wina howl \u25a0 ed in frightfu' guits, driving hall, rain, and sleet Impetuously before it, threatening the destruc tion of everything in its course. The ponderous clouds which hung over the sky rendered it almost as dark aa midnight ; and the very earth sent up clou s of steam, as horn a mighty engme, from the force ofthe violent t.rrents of hail and rain whxh fell. It was a bleak and dreary afternoon, about the middle of November. AH things appeared cheer less and desolate ; It seemed impossible that even the hearts of those who were blessed with the choicest gifts of fortune could be otherwise than depiessel and gloomy in such a season ; what then must have been the sufferings ot the poor, starving wretch, left destitute by the brutal tyranny and sordid rapacity of man 7 What must have been the argufah of those whose mis fortnnes should have excited tho deepest com miseration, and whose honeBt virtues should have entitled them to respect? The little Evelina grew more pale, and there was a ghastly expression in her eyes, which was truly appalling to behold. Her dis\u00ab tracted mother was so faint, too, that it was with difficulty ahe could support her; or sustain her head upon her bosom, while she shielded her as well as she could from the pitiless b.ast, and wept tears of the bitterest agony upouher cheek?. ' My God I' she exclaime J, ' what will become of us? My poor child, my innocent girl, and must you perish thus? All- pitying He ven, come to oui relief. Richard, Richard, why . o you not return 1' Yet such waa the situation of Richard Mars din, his still lovely wife, and the little Evelina. Three daya before, th j merciless Bt e ward of Colonel Ormond had seized upon every article of his furniture for rent aud other arrears due, dragging the very beds fron underneath them, and laaving them nothing but tho bare walls of their once happy homo to gaze upon ; and accompanied with the threat tbat in a few hours they would be ejected from even that miserable shelter. \u00a3h vain had Richard Marsden appealed to him for mercy ; she brutal answer he received w_s, a recommendation for him to ' beg, or steal, or go to the workhouse I' ' Dear mother,' said the patient child, ' I am bitter\u2014 better now. It was only a little faint ness that came ever m s, aud the terror of the storm was too much for my childish frame. Poor father cannot venture to return till the tempest has abated.' ' No, no, my Evelina !' ejaculated Mrs. Marsden; ' not all the hcr.r___ of the storm, if they were even ten ti-res more dreadful than they are \u2014 no danger, however terrible, could prevent your father from retarning to our dwell-. ing If he had gained the relief he went to seek.

But Maraden was a mam of too prouS arid in dependent a spirit, too full of virtuous integrity, t. conceive a dishonest action ; he had a strong arm and a willing heart to work, let the employ ment be ever so humble or laborious, if he ould gat It io do, and ho scorned the Ida ot bec.ming a p.iuper. He was a man of superior education and i;ir_l ectual aU-ainmenti.

Mrs. Mirsden kissed the g ast y cheek of her \u2022augh'er *i.hfra_tic ar Jour, and then they both fell on their kr-ees, and w th clasped haudg offer ed up to tha Tnrone of Grace those men al aup\u201e"], [11, "OR, POVERTY, CRIME, AND SORROW. 3 plications which they could scarcely find strength to give utt- ranee to. with a feeling ol the moat agonising disappoint ment, ' then it i_ not he.' She staggered across the room as well as she could, and opening the door, gave admittance to the kind-hearted woman aud her sob. It waB a piteous sight to behold them in that coid and comfortless room, with their famished looks and shivering forms, iu that at itude. The wind swept in at the windows and the different crevices with the most cutting effect, and not the least spark of fire burned In the grate, by whose genial influence they might have gained some trifling relief. Surely it must have been a monster, indeed, whose heart could have remained unmoved at such a sight. They were both loaded \u2014 the old woman with a saucepau in hor hand, and something tied up In her apron, and Felix, who was a fine, hands ome intelligent boy, about ten years of age, with a bundle on his shoulder. Tears rolled down the poor boy's cbeoks when he beheld the deplorable condition of his youthful playmate and her mo ther, and placing the bun lie on the floor, he ap proached Evelina, and taking her hand, looked in her pale countenance with an expression that showed the teelings which were passing in his breast. Another hour passed of increasing misery, and still Richard Madden came not, although the evening was rapidly advanc ng, and the distance of the cot age was not far from Ormond Castle. Something dreadlul must certainly hav. happen ed to him. AH kinds of terrible thoughts and conjectures rushed upon the distracted brain of his faithful wite. She knew that the proud spirit of her unfortunate husband could not brook insult, even though sunk In the lowest depths of poverty and misery; an. Bhould Colonel Oi'mond have turned a deaf e_r to his appeal to his humanity, aod to it added score and reproach, she shuddered to think what her hu band, in the frenzy of his excited feelings, might have been exasperated to do. Good God I he might, even at the present time, be the inmate of a prison. The thought waB too horrible for endurance, and, c asping her burning temples, she gave utterance to repeat d groans of insup portable agony. ' Poor things, poor things 1' said the compassion ate old woman, ' oh, what a cruel man must Mr. Flint be to have done this I But take heart, tak* heart; things have come to the worst with you, and surely must soon mend. I have brought you some nice broth, which I have made ou pur pose, and a little bread and meat \u2014 all that I could scrape together, and God knows my means are small enough, or how gladly would I do more. And my poor little Felix said as he had had a good dinner and tea, he could not think of eat ing his supper, knowing that poor Evelina waa without; so hs has added that to the stock, if you will be pleased to accept of it. And then I have brought you some fuel to make you a fire, and a rug or two which may serve to make up somethi .g of a bed. Heaven help you! I wish I could do more. I'm sure my will is good enough, aud I should have come before if it had not been for the storm, I'm sure my heart bled for you, whiie I listened to it.' It was wonderful how the poor child could support her delicate frame at ail, under such a fearful trial; but she battled with it with all the courage of a little heroine, and In the mo ment of her mother's greatest despair, tried to appear more calm. While the garrulous but humane Mrs. Goodson waB thus rapidly speaking, sbe was not otherwise idle; she hastily spread a clean napkin on the floor before Evelina and her mother, placed on it some basins, pUtes, aod knives an _ forks, and the provi-iuns she had brought, and then pro ceeded with uncommon activity, for her age, to kindle a fire in the grate. The tempest at length lulled, the wind gradu ally died away in m.umtul, sullen echoes, and the rain entirely ceased; but tbe sole . n silence \u2014 the death like calm that succeeded was, if possible, almost as awful aa had been the storm in its utmost fury. It appeared like the fore warning of something moro dreadful that was about to happen. Mrs. Marsden's heart was full to bursting, aad she could not _pe_k, while Evelina aud Felix sobbed aloud. Yet to the little and innocent Evelina it afforded a ray of comfort aud hope. ' __ j>d has beard our pra. ens, my dearest mother,' she said, In a stronger voice ; ' see, the s or__ has ceased, and my father will return.' 'Heaven send tbat he may, my Evelina,' returned Mrs. Marsden. ' but my heart still mis gives me. Had I only but strength, and could venture to leave you alone, I would hasten forth ia search of him ; but, alas 1 my feeble limbs will scare. ly carry me ac.oss the room Ahi surely I heard a f lotstep. There Is a knock at the door I Richard, my beloved husband, have you indeed returned to your poor wife and child, aod has your melancholy errand been success* sals' ' Come, come, poor things, do nat fret,' said the kind creature, placing the saucepan ou the fire to warm the broth she had brought. 'God above will not forsake you in this your sad trou ble, and certainly the cruelty of Fliut will come hom. to him. Perhaps I may be the next victim, although I aud my husband have lived upon the estate from childhood, and our parents before na.

' But do you not know whither he has gone V Inquired Mrs. Goodson. 1 Good night, Evelina,' said Felix, \u25a0 my prayers shall be offered up to Heaven for you and your parents. ' The little Evelina could make no reply, bat she suffered her young playfellow to press her hand, and ber tears flowed fa6t. The old woman and her son departed, and Mrs. Marsden followed them to the door, and anxiously looked out to as* cei tain, as well as the darkness would permit her, whether or nother husband waa approaching; but she saw nothing but the retreating forms of Felix and his mother, and she returned into the cottage in despair. ' He went to make an appeal to the humanity of Colonel Ormond, our landlord ; and he has been absent all the afternoon. Much I fear that something has happened to him, or he would never have stayed away from us so long.' \u2022 Oh, no, do not alarm yourself. What can have happened to the poor man? They are having along conversation together, and arrang ing matters; and then the storm might have detained him. Now do let ma see you partake of some food, or I shall be offended, Indeed I shall.' The Are which Mrs. Goodson had kindled now sent forth a cheerful crackling blaza, which cast Yielding to the old woman's earnest and hu mane solicitations, Mrs. Marsden and her daugh ter did partake of a small poitiou of the broth, and some of the other provisions; and that, with the warmth of the lire, which was now blazing in the grate, did considerably revive them ; but stlK they both anxiously watched the cottage door, and listened to the slightest sound, tmstlng every moment to behold the arrival of the object of their deep solicitude ; but still they were doomed to this insupportable state of doubt and sus pense. a lurid reflection upon the bare and lonely walls of the room. The warmth, and the slight but nourishing refreshment which Evelina bad par- taken of, had greatly revived her nearly exhaust' ed strength, aud a slight hectic tinge had super- seded the former ghastly paleness of her cheeks, but still her breast was tortured to the utmost degree, not only at the continued absence of her father, but to witness the almost insupportable agony her mother was enduring. Suddenly, however, they were startled by hearing the sound of a man's voice upon the air, and immediately afterwards the cottage door * as burst open, and Richard Marsden, his counten- ance deadly pale, his eyes distended, his limbs trembling, and his whole demeanour disordered to the utmost degree, rushed into the room. With a frantic cry of mingled delight and alarm, Mrs. Marsden rushed, as well as her enfeeb'od limbs would permit her, towards him, and threw herself almost faiuting in, his arms ; while Evelina, with a strength which from her recent suffering could not bave been expected, sprang to her feet, and running to him, clasped his knees, and looked up in bis face with an expression no language can properly pourtray. ' Richard, my husband, dear partner of my cares and anxieties,' exclaimed his wife, ' oh, are you indeed restored to met Ob, what has detained you so long ? Your countenance, too, is frightfully disordered, and your limbs tremble ; something particular must bave occurred to agitate you in this violent manner. TeU me, have you been disappointed 1 Does Colonel Ormond remain inexorable, and is all hope at au end ?' ' And now,' said Dame Goodson, having ar ranged the rugs aad other articles of bedding she had brought with her to the best advantage on the floor, ' there is a little something better to rest your poor weary limbs upon than the bare boards, and yon will find fuel enough to keep up a good II re all night, and I will bring you some more in the morning. I wish that I could accommodate you at home ; hut there are only two rooms in my cottage, you know, and they are barely enough for me and my family. Besides, most 'ikely, if I had convenience to do so, I should bring down the spite of Mr. Flint, aud he would tuiu us out of our humble house as well. Ah, ma ! it is a sad thing to be lu the po war of such cruel people. But keep up your spirits, Mrs. Marsden, and you, my dear Evelina, for Heaven, I trust, has fresh happiness in store for you.' Mrs. Marsden shook her head, and her tears flowed as fast as ever. ' To you, my good friend,' she said, ' I am in debted for that which I am afraid I shalt never be able to repay, but by gratitude. Ob, what an example do you set to those who are placed in the most affluent circumstances in life, and who take pride only to oppress and tyrannise _ ver their less fortunate fellow creatures, who, oy the honest sweat of their brow, mase that wealth they luxuriate in.

Better would it be for us to rush at one. upon our fate, and save ourselves from the world's scorn aud persecution.' his feelings were evidently in a state of the ut most agitation. At length, turning to Evelina, he gently put her from him, and in a sabdued tone, said \u2014 ' Retire, my poor child ; your young ears must not be polluted by hearing the revolting disclo sure.* ' Oh, for He ven's sake, talk not thus, my dear husband,' said Mrs. Marsden : ' but endea vour to tranquillize your feelings, and to partake of some of the humble refreshment which you mmt stand so much in need of.' ' Fray do, my dear father,' implored the little Ereliaa, looking up in his face with the most In* describable affection. Evelina, with an anxious and bewildered look, retired to the other side of the room, and then Marsden grasping the arm of his wife, and look ing fear.ully in her face, said, in a low hoarse voice \u2014 ' Now, Lydia, you have asked for the disgust ing truth and you shall hear it.

Now, Lydia, can you wonder at my frenzy ?' 'Alas . then, what course is there for us to pursue?' said Mrs. Marsden, wringing her hands.

' Nothing, my love,' replied ber husband. * Your conduct has ever been most unblemished. It is those modest charms, which Bhould rather have repelled his advances, that have excited his diabolical passions, and the cowardly ruffian thought to take advantage of our present miseries to triumph iu the accomplishment of his wishes. But we can, we must, no longer remain here. There is pollution about the very place. We are penniless, friendless, and better would It be for us were we dead, than thus to be exposed to the horrors and degradation of a vagrant life.' ' Oh, no, no, Lydia/ replied Marsden, ' it would be to no purpose. Is not Paul Langston, your uncle, a sordid miser, who could never be induced to part with a single coin, unless he was certain to make twenty by it, and who never acknowledged either you or your parents ? I tell you again that such an application is hope less.' ' Theu there is i_o hope for us at all,' said MrB Marsden. Her husband was about to make a reply, when they were startled by hearing a loud knock at the door of the cottage. Marsden hastily ad vanced towards it, and demanded who was there. 'Alac-! alas I wretched belogs as we are,' sighed Mrs. Marsden, ' what is to become of us ? And must we be thus left to perish of want ? Our poor child, too, must she thus early fall a sacrifice to unrelenting poverty? But no, it must not be; we must seek tbe aeylum of a work house, until foi tune may smUe more favours .ly upon us/ No answer was returned, aud the knocking was repeated.

By my soul's hopes, neverl There is work in tho country, and I will seek it out. Richard Marsden is not to? proud, nor too lazy, to earn his living by the honest sweat of bis brow ; but never will he suffer himself, and those so dear to him, to become tbe victims of ignorant and oppressive parish authorities. Much as my soul revolts at the bare idea of dis honesty, by Heaven! I would rather become a felon, with the chanoe of procuring food for my wife and offspring. Your rich man has eome sympathy for tbe thief, as Is proved by the treat ment he receives in prison, but he has none for the unfortunate pauper, who 1b starved to death, or his heart broken, for the heinous crime of being poor 1' ' Be calm, Lydia,' said Marsden ; ' at the hazard of my life I will protect you and my child.' In a moment, he drew from his ooat-pocket a long. bladed knife; but his wretched wife no sooner beheld t at than, with a shriek, she darted npon him, _ud succeeded iu wresting it from hiB hand.

Bah I my blood toils with indignation at the base aspersion \u2014 I, Richard Marsden, who sprang from as noble a family as you, and who should bave been possessed of equal wealth, had I not been robbed of it.' He slowly unbarred the door ss he spoke, and started back aghast, confounded, and horror-struck when tbe reflection of tbe fire fell upon the fea tures of Colonel O mond. Mrs. Mars 'len uttered a faint scream, aod eunk on her knees, covering her face with her hands. For a few moments, the shameful and heart less libertine and Richard Marsien confronted each other, and both were unable to speak. Tbe face of Marsden beearae red with rage. He set hia teeth, his boBom bw lied with tbe most turbolent passions, and he clenched hls fists, and seemed half inclined to rush on the vi lain at once. During the time that Marsden was thus speak ing, Colonel Ormond knitted his brows, and the changes bis countenance underwent, plainly in. dicated that he was experiencing mingled feelings of _bame, rage, revenge, and desire. He stood by the door, and only once be ventured to cast his eyes towards Mrs. Marsden, but his glance met that of her husband, and he immediately withdrew it. and listened to tbe observations of Marsden with the utmost confusion. He saw that he waa a determined man, and that for him to meet with any chance of success in his dia bolical schemes, he must change the tone of his conduct. ' Base miscreant 1' he at Jength cried, ' dare you venture to this wretched home, which you have rendered desolate, after our interview this day? Begone, libertine, \u2014 monster, lest my just resentment tempt me to hurl you from the threshold 1 ke a dog.* ' You would do well not to threaten Richard Mareden. repHed the colonel, with the most as tonishing coo ness j 'however, I will have the forbearance to heed not what you say ; I came not here to quarrel with you, but rather to come to some amicable arrangement with you.' ' Oh, base, shameless man,' ejaculated Marsden, ' can you look upon this picture of misery aud want, which you have caused, and yet treat your wretched victims thus? Leave me, or my rage will certainly overpower my reason, and I shall be induced to do tbat which I might afterwards repent.' ' Richard Marsden,' he said, ' I am sorry for what happened, which occurred entirely through the misrtp esentatioas of ray steward, Mr. Flint. But I am willing to make you all the atonement in my power, by restoring to you your furniture, and by presenting you with a sum of money, as some trifling compensation for the sufferings I have caused you. You can continue to reside on my estate, if you think proper, and I will render you every assistance to promote your wel fare.' Mrs. Marsden now looked up, and ventured to glance towards the colonel ; but no sooner did she behold the face of the base, designing hypocrite, than she read at once the villanous thoughts that were even at that moment passing in his mind. Crimson blushes of shame and resentment again glared in the poor woman's cheeks, and with a shudder of horror, she avert' ed her looks. 'Again I tell you, Richard Marsden,' said Ormond, ' that your threats are useless aad un called for. I came to make you some atoaemen t lor the distresB I have brought upon you, under the impression that you were idle and improvi dent.' \u2022Idle! improvide_t I' repeated the wretched man.

Your very looks betray you, and I spurn your osier with feelings of disgust and horror, which I cannot find words to give expression to. No, no, I can meet death, and see my wife and poor child dying by my side, even though it be by the slow and lingering process of starvation ; but I cannot, will not, meet dishonour I Begone, sir, begone, while you are safe.' Tbe libertine bit his lips, and his bosom swelled with offended pride and conscious guilt. ' Calm I' repeated Mariden, * and can esn you talk to me of calmness whila I am receiving the insults of a man who has done us so much in jury, and would complete his infernal task by one of the most diabolical acts that ever stained the mind of a human being?

Colonel Ormond, I want no further words with you ; aud if you have one spark of manly feeling left withia your breast, you will immediately retire from the place where your presence excites so much horror.

' Oh, Richard, my husband 1 for Heaven's sake forbear,' exclaimed Mrs. Marsden, dinging more closely to him, as he was about to rush on the colonel ; while the little Evelina, who had ali this time remained trembling by her parents, uttered a scream of terror, and threw herself on her knees, with clasped hands and the most suppli cating looks, between her father and Ormond, who was unarmed, and whose Blender figure pre\" sented a most remarkable contrast to tbe athletic and finely proportioned frame of Richard Mars* den. ' Think no more of It, Richard, think no more of It; but trust in the goodness and mercy ef Providence, and wait calmly till to-morrow. Wqo knows how bright a change a few hours may bring about iu our olrcumstances V 1 Yes, yes,' returned the wretched husband, bitterly ; ' a bright change, truly, perhaps to see me dragged to a gaol, and you left without a protector, unprovided for, and at the mercy of that scoundrel who has had the shameless effrontery to acknowledge his diabolical, his revolting passion.' ' Bathe will not dare, Richard V ' He will not dare I what is there that he will not dare to do!' ' But surely the law will protect us in our forlorn condition V ' And you, Colonel Ormond,' continued Mrs. Marsden, 'I now oondescend to speak to yeu, as well as my disgust and shame will permit me to do, to tell you that your conduct disgraces you as a man, a Christian, and a gentleman.' \u25a0 The law will punish us , my dear wife. There ls no Justice for the poor and oppressed. Oh,. Lydia, it would bs a mercy to us were the Almighty to take us to Himself.\" Colonel Ormond had retreated nearer towards the door, and the rage that filled his bosom needs no description to bring it to the imagination. And so, Richard Marsden,' he said, gnashing his teeth, and frowning frightfully, ( you would commlta cowardly outrage upon me, at the ver/ moment when I would offer you redress for tho wrongs I possibly may have Inflicted on you, and render you assistance In your present difficulties. Mark me, you shall have bitter reason to repent this, unless yeu make an ample apology for what yon have said, and tha indignities you have heaped upon me. This night, for the sake of your wife and child, I will leave you undisturbed, but beware of to-morrow.' \u25a0 It might, it might, Richard,' sighed his wife. ' But His will, and not ours, be done. Come, come, again let me Implore you to partake of some refreshment, and then to endeavour to snatch an hour or two's repose ; there Is no fear of our being any further disturbed to-night.' Marsden's mind wandered in the distraction of his thoughts, and for a time he seemed to he unconscious to the circumstances of the moment. He therefoio made no resistance to his wifo, who, faint as she herself was, led him towards that part of tho room where tbe remainder of the provisions, which old Damo Goodson had brought, were spread, and he threw himself on the floor, and covering his face with his hands, sobbed heavily. Mrs. Marsden seated herself by his side, and by all tho fond endearments she was capable of, endeavoured to rouse him lrom his lethargy of anguish. Evelina had before left the side of her parents, and had stretched her limbs upon the rude pallet which Dame Goodson had made up for them Fatigue, and the genial influence of the Are, had gradually overpowered her, and she was now wrapped in a calm and refreshing sleep. Her mother imprinted a soft kiss upon her cheek, and then fondly directed the atten tion of her husband towards her. It aroused him from Ms fearful abstraction, and he gazsd on her, fora few moments, with the most intense earnestness and agony of thought 'Sleep oo, little sufferer,' h. s'ghed 'and may the all-merciful God aoove watch over With these words, the libertine, without wait ing for any further reply from Marsden, left the cottage, closing the door violently after h'm. ' The cowardly scoundrel,' exclaimed Marsden ; 1 and must I submit to him \u2014 to him that has brought me to beggary, and would add dlshonsur to misery J Oh, God ! Thou art trjlng me too far.

Alas, alas I Where will be your resting place to morrow?' ' sleep presses on my eyelids, and I cannot resist it.' * 0_, do not give way to this dreadful des pair, Richard,' said his wife, looking imploringly in his face, and laying her fair hand on his. ' The Almighty will not reject the humble but devout prayers that we have offered up to Him. He will not leave u9 without a shelter, and friends may yet appear to render us assistance ln our destitution.' ' Sleep, dear Lydia,' replied her husband. 'And oh, may its balmy influence bring you comfort.' 4 But you will seek repoie also, will you not, my dear husband V she inquired. ' Presently, my love, presently. Heaven bless you!' Fondly they embraced each other, aad then Mrs. Marsden laid herself by the side of her daughter, and, olosing her weary eyes, for the present found a rosplte to her miseries. Marsden arose from the posture in which he had been sitting, and for a few mouutes he strode rapidly across the cheerless apartment, and beat his breast, and struck his forehead alternately. Despair was upon his heart, hud madoess had almost settled upon his brain. ' Friends, Lydia I' replied Marsden ; ' where shall we seek them t * Who will commiserate vith us In our hard lot ? We have no friends but our poor neighbours, who have it not in their po_er to assist us. Could I but obtain employment, however menial, that I might be enabled to leave this neighbourhood, I could try to hope, but as it is, alas I and with no other prospect before us but starvation \u2014 can any oue wonder at my madness, my despair V 1 Repose yourself to-night, Richard,' again supplicated Mri. Marsden, ' and to-morrow you may seek and find that employment which you so much require.' Again he returned to the spot where his wife and child were sleeping, and once more sitting down on the floor, he placed his elbows on his knees, and resting his head upon his hands, gazed with frenzied looks at the unconscious sleepers. ' And, In the meantime, what is to become of you, Lydia, aad our poor child . WiU jou not be driven from this wretched abode ?' And as the wretched man thus sat, dark and terrible were the thoughts tbat rushed upon his aching brain, and fearful were the visions that arose to his fevered Imagination. Hideous forms seemed to dince around him, and ti point with derisive looks at the pale countenance us hie wife and child. Then the grim phantom of Want seemed to stand at the head of their rude pallet, and while It waved its (leshless arms over them, their aheeks became hollow and wasted, their eyes sunk in their sockets, like those of a corpse ; and they appeared t . be suffering tbe most insup portable aud indescribable agony. ' Food 1 food ! give us food 1' he thought he heard them cry, and with a srenz.cd exclamation, be started to his feet. ' Oh, no,' answered Mrs. Marsden ; ' bad and oppressive a man as Colonel Ormond has proved himself to be, I cannot believe that he could be so c uel \u2014 so totally heartless as to drive ub forth, destitute and perishing. Besides, Mrs. Goodson, I am certain, poor aB she is, would not see us want.' ( And ahall I submit to receive assistance from the poorest of my fellow creatures, aud to ta he that food from them wh'ch they want for their own family! My heart recoils at the thought. Lydia, it must not be/ Again the weeping Mrs. Marsden tried to remontrate with him, and persuade him to eat, but for s.me time in vain ; at length, to quiet her anguish, for he was too sick at heart to eat, although he had fasted so long, he yielded to her solicitations, and forcibly swallowed a mouthful or two. 'Christ help me!' he cried; ' shall I endure this f \u2014 No, no ; better that I at once terminate their existence and my own, rather than that they should be brought to so horrible a fate. Heaven pardon me for the unnatural deed, and receive their unspotted souls !' ' I cannot eat any more, dear Lydia,' he said ; ' I am not hungry, indeed I am not.' The distracted man seized a knife as he spoke ; madness was upon his brain, and fiends of dark ness seemed urging him on to the bloody doed. He stood over the sleeping forms of hia innocent wife and child, with the knife in his hand, and bared their fair necks to receive the fatal wound. What a moment of terror was this, and the in tended victims all unconscious of the dreadful fate which threatened them, Rut suddenly a sickly faintneas came over him ; large drops of per -pir_tion started to his burning temples, he threw the knife from him, and started back appalled and trembling with terror at the thoughts which returning reason crowded with overwhelm ing force upon his brain. 'Come, then, my husband,' ejaculated Mrs. Mars len, ' let ub offer up our supplications to the Most High, who never turns a deaf ear to the prayers of those who deserve His mercy.' Tm tressed by the solemnity of her manner, Rieiard Marsden made no reply; but immedi ately Bank ob his knees, and clasped his hands together. His wife knelt by his side, and long and fervently did tbey mutually supplicate the Almighty to look down with compassion upon them, and to release them from their present horrible state of distress. When they had con cluded, they fell Into each other's arms, and wept unrestrained, unable to give any vent to their powerful s.elingi. ' Wr_tch 1 unnatural monster 1' he exclaimed, ' what bloody deed was I about to perpetrate f Murder my innocent wife and child in their sleep ? Oh, horror I horror ! Let me rush forth, and wander anywhere, until I have got rid of these inhuman thoughts. Should I remain here, madness may again se;ze upon my brain, and then I m:g tit imbrue my hands in the blood of How long they remained in this state, we oannot say ; but suddenly Mrs. Marsden felt a heavy drovstaess stealing over her senses, which she could not shake off, but which wai not sur pricing, after the ta'i^ue, both of mind and body, waieh sbe had undergone.

Evelina still slept soundly, and nothing seemed likely to disturb her repose for some time. 'Heaven be thanked for this,' said the wretched mother, 'may your sleep ha bound, calm, and refreshing, my poor child; for were you aware of the absence of your father, your anguish of mind would be more thau your en feebled state could bear.' He drew a piece of chalk from his pocket, and, scarcely knowing what he did, he wrote on the wall the following words : \u2014 4 Dear wife, fear not, I shall soon return.' He then snatched up his hat, and with a groan of agony, rushed irom tho cottage, securing the door after him. CHAPTER III. THE ADVENTURE IN THE RUINS. \u2014 THE ROB- BERS. \u2014 THE BURIED MONEY. \u2014 THE MURDER AND ACCUSATION. Richard Marsden had not quitted the cot tage more than half an hour wheu his wife awoke. The fire was still burning briskly in the grate, aud it cast a lurid glare through the empty room. Mrs. Marsden immediately raised her head, and looked around her, and not seeing him an v where, bhe became alarmed, and started to her feet. She pressed a kiss upon the lovely girl's lips, and then resumed her weary watching for the return of her wretched husband ; the most dreadful forebodings entering her mind, as the time elapsed, aid the storm Increased. 'Richard, Richard, my husband, oh, where are you?' she cried, wringing her hands. She then entered each of the other deserted room., but could not find the object of ber anxiety. . * Richard Marsden, on quitting his lonely cottage, with his hands clasping his burning temples, rushed heedlessly on for some distance, with all tbe air of a maniac; aud In truth at that time he wa \u25a0 very little better than one. Still strange and frightful visions seemed to arise to his disordered imagination, and goaded him on to frenzy. ' My God I' sbe ejaculated, ' whither can he have gonef He surely cannot have deserted us in this our misery. Ob, no, no, he could not be so cruel. Heaven preserve him from any rash act to which his agony might drive him.' She teturned to the apartment she had left, and then, for the first time, her eye caught the wilting on the wall. She read the words again and again, with a bewildered brain, and then once more she wrung her hands and beat her breast in the agony of her anxiety. He knew uot whither he was going, and he had no settled purpose; all that he kne.v was that he had been goaded on to contemplate the perpetration as a moBt hideous crime, and that he was rushing from the danger ; but when the remembrance of those few minutes of horror, when the lives of Evelina and her mother bung upon a thread, and that he might have become their murderer, came to his recollection, his agony of thought was almoit more than, in his then distracted state, he had strength to bear up ag.list ' Alas ! alas 1* she sighed, ' what can he mean by this f What purpose could have taken him out at such a time as this, and to leave us alone and unprotected .' Again she seated herself by the side of the sleeping Evelina, and ber tears gushed forth in torrents. I i vain she racked her bewildered brain to endeavour to form a conjecture as to the cause of her unhappy husband's conduct ; aud imagined all Borts of fearful dangers that he would be likely to fall into ; but to no satisfactory conclusion could the wretched woman come. She knew of no place that he could have gone to ; and without auy person to consult with, her suspense and anguish of mind rose beyond endurance. Had it not been so late, and the fear of leaving Evelina alone, she would have sought the cottage of Mrs. Goodson, and making her nad her husband acquainted with the par ticulars, have had their advice upon the eubj.ct. But aa it was, she bad nothing left but to endure ber doubts and her misery alone. At length, breathless with the wild speed at which he had been going, he was compelled to pause, and looking around him, found that he waB a considerab e distance from the cottage, and that it would take him some time to get back again. But could he dare venture to return in hls piesent state of mind, wben probably the frenzy of a moment might plunge him into the perpetration of so horrtble a crimes He could not ; and yet the agony and suspense which his wife aud (laughter would suffer at his disap pearance, should they awake, was cause of numerous conBictiog and racking thoughts in his brain. * My God I my God !' he groaned, striking his forehead, 'what have I dor.e\u2014 of what dreadful crimes have I been guilty, that Thou should'st thus seveiely visit me with Toy wr .th I And now another storm arose, which threat* ened to be as violent as that which had raged in the afternoon. A;ain the bellowing wind, seemed to shake the cottage to the very foundation, and"], [19, "OR, POVERTY, CRIME, AND SORROW. 11 And my innocent wife aud child, why, if I am doomed to suffer, should they be made to par ticipate in my misery t Mercy 1 mercy, I he seech Thee, if not for me, at least for those who are far more precious to me than my life's blood.

And shall another bask in that wealth which by right belongs to me, and I and my wife and child be left to perish of hun.er. By Heaven ! reason and justice revolt at the idea. Lord Vernon, it is well for you that you are not here, or 1 know not what, iu the despair of my mind, I might be tempted to do.' and was really frightful to contemplate and tP listen to. Suddenly Marsden was aroused from the deep lethargy of thought he had sunk into, by hear ing the sound of approaching footsteps, which' seemed to be entering the ruins. He arose upon his feet, and drew in his breath, and listened ; not that he was alarmed, for under any circum stances, he was a man unusei to fear ; bat iu spite of all the terrible thoughts with which hfe mind was haunted, his curiosity was excited1,. and he determined to gratify it if possible. Still* there was nothing surprising in tbe circumstance, as it was more than probable that the sounds only proceeded from some travellers who had sought shelter In the ruins like himself. The fo.tstepa approached nearer, aud pre sently afterwards Marsden beheld a stream of light upon the broken pavement, which seemed to proceed from a lanteru carried by somebody. He drew himself behind the ruins of a wait where he could observe all that paBsed, and with* out entertaining much apprehension of beiDg discovered himself; and in a moment afterwards he beheld two tall men, In long smock frocks, enter ihe space he had just quitted. One of them carried a small dark lantern iu his hand, aad they looked steadily about them, as if they were fearful of some other person being there to observe them. He shuddered as these thoughts occurred to him. ' Alas ! he cried, ' poverty, want, and oppres sion, have made me a villain. Heaven keep atf temptation away from me in this fearful hour, or I know not, when I think upon my starving wife and chiid, what I may be prompted to commit. Colonel Ormond, villain, you are the cause of all this, and may the corse of God pursue you for it to destruction.' He wandered on unknowing where to go, or what to do, and yet not finding courage to return to his miserable aud ruined home ; but at length the wind suddenly arose, howling around him in terrific gusts, and then the rain poured dawn in one complete sheet of water. 2. or the moment the shock overpowered him, the fury ofthe wind almost drove him off bis feet ; but he quickly recovered himself, and s .Id \u2014 Marsden had a distinct view of theic features, and was certain, even bewildered as his mind then was, that he should know them again. They were savage and desperate looking feUows, and one of them had a peculiar scar on his left cheek. They both had thick sticks, and they seemed altogether tbe sort of characters that would not hesitate to perpetrate any crime. He Immediately suspected they had beeu after no good, and this conjecture was quickly con firmed. 'The ragi \u25a0 g tempest comes as if to mock my Bufferings; but I am proof aga ust its fury ; ] heed it not; it is in unison with my mind. But oh, what will now be the terrors of my wife and my poor Evtlma? S .all I return to them ? N ', no ; I cannot meet them yet. I caanot trust myself with them, for there is a demon raging in my brea-t, which goads me on to madness.' He now remembered the ruins of an ancient castle which stood no great distance from the spot, and thither he determined to go, and seek Bhelter until the fury of the storm should bave abated ; but he was eo worn out with the un common fatigues of body and mind he had so long beeu enduring, that it was with difficulty he could proceed ; and being now drenched to the skin, added to the misery of his condition. ' There's not much fear of any one observing us here/ said one of them ; ' for it is not many persons who would seek this gloomy, crazy old place, even for shelter from a storm like this.' ' No,' answered the other; ' but we had better despatch this business as quickly as possible, for I do uot think we are safe a moment whi'e we are here. I heard some footsteps approaching just after we had settled the business for him, and should they trace us here, it would most lkely be a settler for us also.' 'Ay,' coincided the ruffian ; 'but now about the swag. I did not think he had so much about him. I think, as you say, it wo 'Id be better for us to bury it here for a day or two, when wo can call for it, and then if we should happen to be taken on suspicion, they will find nothing about us to criminate us. We will keep a gui nea or two for our present use, of course.' At last, however, he gained the ruins, which had a most solemn if not ghastly appearance in that miserable hour. The wretched man, how ever, entered them without a shudder, and selecting a portion of them that was not so de cayed as the rest, he threw himself upon one of the fallen stones, and gave himself up to the horror and despair of his thoughts. ' Agreed,' said the villain who bad spoken first, ' so quick about It, for 1 don't feel altogether comfortable until we are off. Under this atone will do ; we shall be sure to know the spot again.' Marsden watched the murderers with the most breathless attention, and the conflict of his feel ings, at that time, was of the most extraordinary description. Tbey quickly removed a small square stone His position was, however, a most dangerous one, for, with every gust of wind, eome portion of the ruins kept falling, and threatened to crush him eve-y instant beneath them. But he heeded It not, and, in fact, in the dreadful state of mind he was then, he would have met death ia any shape without terror. But the violence of the storm abated not ; on tbe contrary, it seemed to increase every instant, ,\u00ab__.\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0. ... ___i \u25a0 \u25a0 - in i i__.i .__.__ >i ii.Jl _Hx'_h__i -a \u25a0 \u2014 .!__\u00bb..- -.\u2014 *"], [20, "EVELINA, THE PAUPER'S CHILD ; 12 and that these were persons in pursuit of the assassins, he plunged into a more gloomy and unfrequented way by the roadside, and then pro ceeded towards his cottage by a more circuitous route.

Under any other circumstances, Richard Marsden would have shuddered with horror at the bare Idea of appro priating a single coin of the money to his own use, and he would not have rested until he had given such information as would probably have Ui to the detection of the villains ; but now he was blinded by the horrors and hopelessness of bis situation, and conld see nothing but the pale, haggard faces, and attenuated forms of his wife and child ; and the idea of the means he now possessed of saving them from the most wretched ot fates completely stifled every other thought. AlssI little did he anticipate the dreadful destiny that was in store for bim ; bow dearly he would have to pay for the tem_ oiary possession of the price of blood I from the earth, and taking out a long clasp knife, began to dig a hole with it, which they soon accomplished ; and one of them having taken i couple of pnrses, apparently well filled, from t pocket underneath his smock-frock, extracted two or three pieces of gold from one of them, and then threw them ioto the bole. ' You must not forget the gold tickers, Joe,' mid one of the scoundrels. ' Oh, by no manner o' means,\" returned Joe. 'There he goes, and a very pretty little toy it is too, which, before many days have elapsed, we will take the liberty of conwartln' into the rowdy.' The gold watch, wrapped In a piece of paper, was now placed with the money ; the hole filled up, and the stone placed over it, in the same manner as before- \u25a0 There,' sad the fellow who had been called by h s companion in crime, Joe ; ' that's all as snog as the bank, and they must be cunning indeed, who can discover It. Now for a bolt, while the coast is clear.' They immediately withdrew from the rutnl, and left Marsden In a state of mind that lan guage must fail to do justice to. He could scarcely believe the evidence of his senses, in respect to wbat he had witnessed ; but n\u00bbw came the fearful struggle of passion in his bosom. Tho wretches had evidently committed murder, and that gold was the produce ef their crime. For a moment he hesitated ; he felt that it was his duty to create an instant alarm, eo that the wretches might be pursued and brought to punishment ; but then the famished looks of his wife and child presented themselves to his imagination, and temptation held its sway over hia better feelings. That gold would save tbem iiom want, and would probably be the means of placing them in comfort ; and had he not better have it than tbe wretches who had committed tbe deed I This thought decided him, and has tening to the spot, he stooped down, aod with the aid of his clasp knife, removed the stone, dug out the earth, and came to the valuable booty. And here again his heart tailed him, for hia conscience told him he was doing wrong; but his wife and Evelina again rushed upon bis thoughts, and with the laugh of a madman, he snatched the purses and the watch from their place of concealment. In the utmost agony and anxiety of min \u201e hsd Mis. Marsden watched and waited for tbe return of her unfortunate husband ; and when minu'o after minute elapsed, and still he came not, her misery became perfectly insupportable; and she wrnng her hands, and wept bitterly. Once or twice ahe was half resolved to rush from the cottage, in spite of the storm, and the lateness of the hour, in search of him ; but she, looking at her sleeping girl, could not, dan not, leave her alone. And now, between the pauses of the tempest, the unhappy woman imagined she heard all kind of strange and horrible noises in the air. More than once she was almost certain that she beard the cry of Marsden, followed by fearful groans, as if proceeding from some poor wreteh in his dying agony; and so powerful was that impres sion, that her brain became bewildered and dis tracted ; her trembling limbs could no longer support her exhausted frame, and she sunk on tbe floor, and placed her flBgers in her ears, as if to endeavour to shutout the appallicg sounds she imagined she heard. ' Ob, Richard, Richard,' she ejaculated, ' why did you leave me taus, aod for what purpose t Surely it was cruel thus to add to my dreadful feelings of anguish and suspense. Heaven pre serve him from all barm, for much I fear that sometblog tearful is yet in store for us. Colonel O.mond, cruel mao I it is you that has \u00bbiou_o.t our misery aud destruction. ' Quickly he placed the lll.gotten booty in his bosom, and heedless of the storm, which was still unabated in fury, he rushed from the ruins, and fled breathless along the road which led to his cottage. ' My wife, my child, shall not perish of hunger,' he cried ; ' for I have gold, gold, and I have not steeped my soul in crime to obtain it. Ha, ha, ha I Tyrant Ormond, I now defy you, for I have tbat which will render me independent of you.' Wretched man I he little anticipated the misery that was ln store for him ; but on he ran panting with eagerness to reach his dwelling, that he might, as he thought, impart comfort to his wife and child.

Mr_ Marsden uttered a scream of astonishment and tcrrcr as her wretched huibaid displayed the money ; and a deadly feeling of horrot __t through her frame. To her frenzied imagina tion, at that moment every coin of the money which Marsden strewed upon the floor seemed stained with blood, and the most agonising and insupportable apprehensions immediately took possession of her. 'lam here, my poor child,' said Mrs. Mars d\".n, staggering towards her, and straining her to her agitated bosom ; ' do not be alarmed, your mother will not leave you for an Instant.' ' But where ii my poor father !' asked the child, looking anxiously ronnd the miserable apartment. ' I do not see him.' ' Alas I your father has gone, Evelina,' replied Mrs. Marsden, with a sigh, and wringing her bands in the anguish of her apprehension. ' Ob, Richard, Richard 1' she gasped forth, Axing upon him a look wbich seemed as if it would have penetrated to his very soul; 'what has despair and madness driven you to do r How came this money in your possession!

Should he encounter that cruel man, Colonel Ormond, the consequences might be dreadful.' 'Found its repeated Mrs. Marsden, with a look of increased amazement and terror. 'Ob, Marsden I this suspense is maddening. Wretched man, you would deceive me I' ' I repeat, Lydia,' said her husband, in a faint voice, ' that I know not to whom the money belongs. I found it, not long since, In the old castle ruins.' ' Fear not, Evelina, they will not meet again to-night. It is not likely that Colonel Ormond Is ont at Buch an hour of the night and in such a tempest.\" ' And I had such a sweet dream, dear mother,' sail the poor child. 'I thought tbat our horns was again bappy and cheerful, and yourself and my tet her were ono more smiling and content. Plenty was npon our table, and I imagined that my poor father had a large sum of money, an almost countless heap of glittering gold, and my heart bounded with transport to behold how rioh we were. Alas I alas I to what a terrible dis appointment have I awakened 1' ' Oh, most improbable story,' ejaculated Mrs. Marsden ; ' you never gave me eaose to doubt you before, Rlcbard, and, if you would not drive me to destruction, you will at once reveal to me the truth.' 'Woman,' said Richard Marsden, with a look of sternness and ln accents of anger he had never assumed towards hls wl'e before, ' will you not believe my assertions t Think you that I have committed robbery to obtain this glittering booty! But, hark! wbat noises are those upon the air 1 Do you not hear them t and those lights that are flickering yonder. What can this mean I' Mrs. Marsden pressed her still closer to her bosom, and her tears fell fast upon her face, and choked her utteranco. But suddenly they were both startled by hearing a voice outside the cottage, and before they could move from the spot, the door was burst open, and Richard Mars. den, breathless, and fearfully excited, entered the room. ' See,' cried the alarmed Mrs. Marsden, ' the lights approach nearer. The persons who cany them are coming towards the cottage. God of Heaven I what can be the meaning of this ( Horrible apprehensions crowd upon my brain. Speak to me, Richard, and for the lovo of Heaven give me some explanation.' ' Let me _\u00bbr the door,' exclaimed Marsden, with a wild and ghastly look. ' They must not enter. Let me conceal the money I quick, quick lor I am lost.' Mrs. Marsden and her [daughter, with an ex clamation of mingled joy and alarm, flew towards him, and grasped his hands eagerly. ' Thank God, thank God ! that you have re turned, my husband,* ejaculated Mrs. Marsden, when she at length found strength to speak ; 'but, ob, tell me, how conld you think ef leaving us, and whither have yeu been In such a storm V Marsden, whose brain was disturbed with the various and conflicting thoughts that rushed upon it, looked wildly aod vacantly at his wife and daugher for an instant, and then burst into a loud hysterical laugh. 'Oh, Heaven!' exelalmel Mrs. Marsden, terror nearly overpowering her ; ' misery and despair have destroyed bis reason. Oh, Richard, for the love of God, speak to me ; if only one word.' ' Wretched man,' screamed Mrs. Marsden, clinging to him, ' of what rash and desperate aot have you been guilty f Horror! horror!' 'Father! dear father!' oried the distracted Evelina looking piteously and Imploringly up in his face, ' ch, speak to poor mother, for mercy's sake do.' 'Oh I they are here I' frantically cried Marsden, as the lights from a couple of lanterns gleamed in at the cottage windows, and a loud knocking was immediately afterwards heaid at the door. \" 'Tis done, Lydia, 'tis done,' answered Mars den, in tbe Barne wild manner, ' our misery is over; you shall not perish of want, nor you, my child.

The horror-stricken wife and daughter, clung frantically to Marsden, whose countenance was as pale as death, and the veins of whose forehead were swelled almost to bursting with the in tensity of his agony. ' A very likely story/ said the man. \u2022Oh, surely you will not disbelieve it,' cried Mrs. Marsden, her soul trembling with horror and agony. * So you admit having been to t he castle ru ins recently?' demanded one ofthe men. ' I do/ answeied the distracted Marsden; 'I had not returned many minutes when you name to the cottage. By all your hopes beware how you endeavour to criminate an innocent man. For the Bake of these poor sufTerers I implore you. I knew not even of the death ofthe unfortunate Colonel Ormond, and had not seen anything of him since he visited my cottage in the evening.' * Perhaps you will not attempt to deny that this knife is yours, it is marked with your name, and the blade and handle are stained with blood ?' ' Open the door ; it is useless to disobey us I' said one of the men outside, ' if you do not immediately comply, we will force it open.' 'For the love of God, what do you wants' exclaimed Mrs. Marsden, still clinging with frenzied vehemence to her husband. ' A foul and inhuman murder, and robbery has been committed,' replied the man ; ' Colouel Ormond has been assassinated on hit way home from tbis cottage, and we have sufficient proof that Richard Marsdeu is the perpetrator of this monstrous crime.' Richard Marsden uttered a groan of Indescri bable anguish and despair, and clasped his burn* ing temples. It was the koife with which he had raked the mould from the hole, and which in his excitement he had left behind him. It waa the same knife which his wife had also wrested from him, previous to his interview with Colonel Ormond, and having slightly out his handia getting it from him, had caused the staia of blood mentioned. 'My busbard a murderer and a robber!' shrieked the appalled woman, ' oh, no \u2014 no, no \u2014 it cannot be ! It is some dreadful mistake. He is innocent ; his soul would recoil at the bare idea of such a crime. And yet this gold 1 Hoiror t horror V It was not wlthoit the greatest difficulty that Mrs. Marsden could prevent herself from sinking to the earth, while Evelina clung to her father's knees, and looked the very pictare of despair aod horror. The door wa_ now burst open, and several men entered. No words could do justice to the feelings of tbe wretched Mrs. Marsden and Erelina at this extraordinary combination of dreadful proofs ; in vain Richard Marsden explained this fact; tho men plainly showed that it made little or no im\u00bb pression upon their credulity. ' Seize the villain I and behold, another proof of his guilt 1' cried one of the men, at the same time t .at he picked up the purses which Marsden had dropped on the floor. The unhappy man w. s seized immediately, although he struggled violently, and In the course of which, the gold watchwhich the murderers had also buried in tbe ruins, fell from his bosom. 4 Wretched man/ said one of them, ' the evi \u2022 dences of your guilt are too powerful. Colonel Ormond was found near the wood, barbarously murdered; we instantly went is pursuit of the perpetrator or perpetrators of the inhuman crime ; and thinking it not unlikely that they might have concealed themselves for a time In the old castle ruins, we went tbere, and on searching found this knife ; and knowing that you and the colonel were not on good terms together, our sus picions naturally fell on you, and it ls our duty now to convey you to prison.' 1 Ah !' exclaimed two or three of the men in a breath, when they beheld the watch, ' another and incontestible proof!

Iq vain she struggled, and clung to him; whilst the little Etvina gave utterance to the most piteous c ies ; the men at length disengaged her from him. and forced him away ; and the unfor tunate woman uttered one appalling shriek, and sunk insensible on the floor.

MAESDES. \u2014 THE EX- AMINATION, THE TRIAL. THE CONDEMNA- TION. \u2014 EVELINA AND HER MOTHER BECOME THE INMATES OP THE WORKHOUSE. The cries of poor Evelina rent the air as Bhe proceed on her way; her delicate and tender limbs shivered In the piercing wind, and the horror of her feelings was almost to much for human nature to sustain. Unfortunate child, her sorrows had indeed begun at au early age ; and dark and fearful was the destiny before her. And thus talking Dime Goodson went to inform her hubaod, and to procure such remedies as she might require to restore her to anima tion. Evelina continue, to sob hysterically, and every moment of delay, before her return home, seemed au age to her. At length Mrs. Goodson being all In readiness, reappeared, and they im mediately departed. With frantic speed, Evelina ran on, and was unable to answer the numerous questions which her aged companion put to her. Al hough it waa now past four o'clock, it was still so dark that Evelina could scarcely penetrate the gloom beyond ; bnt she was not far from the village, and soon added speed to her footsteps. She arrived at the cottage, she look up at the windows, all was burled in profound darkness, ahe was so alarmed and bewildered, that Bhe scarcely knew how to act. But the recollection of the situation of ber mother aroused her, and she knocked loudly at the door of the cottage, and at tbe same time she supplicated in tbe mo.it piteous accents for help. The window above was at length opened, and Dame Goodson looked out and beholding Evelina, ber astonishment may be readily imagined. ' Mercy ou us/ exclaimed the old woman, ' what cm bring you, my poor girl here alone, at such an hour? Wait a moment, and I will admit you immediately. Dear, dear, what can have happened ?' Mrs. Goodson left the window, and having hastily sliped on her gown, descended the stairs, and gave admittance to our heroine, who imme diately sunk weeping, and almost lifeless in a chair. They soon arrived at the wretched cottage, and found Mrs. Marsden in just the same melan choly a.d insensible state as when Evelina had left her. Her face was so pale, and her features aa fixed, that Evelina feared at first that she was dead ; and, sinking down by her side, with a cry of horror, Bhe wept scalding tears upon her face, and called with the agony of despair upon her name. But she soon perceived that her heart still \u25a0aintly throbbed ; and the relief the suffer ing girl felt, was like recalling her from death to life. * Poor thing, poor thing !' said the dame, plac ing the head of Mrs. Marsden on her lap ; ' this is, indeed, a dreadful trial for you. God help yon, and your unfortunate huBband.' With what torturing anxiety did Evelina watch her afflicted mother, while Mrs. Goodson applied Buch remedies as she had brought with her, to restore her to her senses ; but for some tim. all her efforts were in vain, as she showed scarcely any signs of returning life. 'For God's sake what is the matter, Evelina V questioned MrB. Goodson; 'and wbat has brought you here at this time, and by yourself ? Come, come, apeak, my dear child/ Mrs. Goodson, with some difficulty, lifted her up, and pl_ced her upon the temporary pallet her klndneis had supplied her with, and then she continued unremitting in her endeavours to restore her to sensibility, and tried all Bhe could to tranquillize the feelings of Evelina; but the wretched glil was completely overwhelmed with grief, and it was a wonder that she did not sink entirely under such an accumulation of horrors for so young a child. ' Oh, pt ay go back with me/ sobbed Evelina ; ' my dear mother is dying ; and my poor father \u2014 ob, dear 1 oh, dear 1' ' Bless my soul 1 but what of your father, child ?'

How bitterly he cursed the fatal temptation which had led him to take the booty of the murdererB, Instead of revealing all he had seen, and been the means of bringing the real perpetratore of the bloody crime to justice. But had he not been driven to It by the most awful misery, and the thoughts of his starving wife and daughter ? He had, and great as had been his error, it surely was most par- donable under all these circumstances. He had never in his life done wilful injury to any mortal being, and surely fortune had been most unkind to him to visit him with such unparalleled trials. He continued in a state of distraction until the time arrived when he was to he taken before tbe justices for examination, and he had then made up his mind for the worst, for how could he com- bat the startling weight of evidence that would be adduced against nlm ; how could he hope to persuade the magistrates of the truth of his answer to the horrible charge . There was nothing but despair and misery before him. A large concourse of persons assembled to see him pass from the gaol to the Town-hall, and the greatest curiosity and Interest were evidently ex* cited. He had previously inquired ofthe o'jjcers after his wife and daughter, but received no satis factory answer from them, no more tban that they would not be permitted to Bee him, and this increased the poignant anguish he was en. during. cottage, and deeply affected he waB at the wretched scene wbich presented itself, and tried, aa well as his wife, to soothe the anguish ofthe suffering Evelina. By degrees they elicited from the poor girl such particulars of the terrible events of the n^ht aa they wished to know ; and it may easily he imagined with what astonishment and grief they listened to them, and how deeply they commiserated with the unfortunate family. That Richard Marsden could ever have been guilty of so dreadful a crime, they could not for a me ment belive ; but so strong did the proofs of his guilt appear against him\u2014 the property of the murdered man being found upon him \u2014 they apprehended that it would go hard with him ; and the story of the manner in which the money and the watch came into his possession was such an extraordinary and improbable one, that they feared no jury would ever he brought to believe It. What a shocking situation was It for this poor child to be placed in ! and If she were thus early deprived of both her parents, what was to become of her ? It was a long time before the efforts of Mrs. Goodson were crowned with any degree of success ; aud then, although Mrs. Marsden wan restored to life and the use of her speech, she evinced no signs of conclousness. She talked wildly and Incoherently, and did not seem to know her distracted daughter. Mrs. Goodson did not consider it safe to leave her a moment, and did all that her humble abilities would allow her to recal her to reason. A* length Evelina was so completely worn out with grief and anxiety, that she was unable to bear up any longer ; and throwing herself by the side of her mother, she was almost reduced to the same state of insensibility. The looks of several persons among the crowd, which he waa hurried rapidly through, convinced him that they pitied his awful situ .rion, aud in spite of the overwhelming evidence against him, were still inclined to entertain doubts of his guNt ; hut that afforded hk % no hope, no co .solaten, f jt what conld interpose b^ween him and the dread ful fate with which he was threatened ? The murder of C _onel Ormond, and the accusa tion of Richard Marsden, caused a most painfnl and extraordinary sensation in the neighbourhood, as soon as It became known ; but although sus picion was so strong against him, no one who knew him could believe him guilty of so diaboli cal a crime, and they deeply commiserated with the misfortunes of that wretched family ; while there were but few only who pitied the fate of Cui nel O rmond, for his character was well known and detested, and the tyrannical and oppressive manner with which he had behaved to Marsden had excited universal disgust. On entering the court, and being placed at the bar, the wretched man cast one melancholy glance around, and then leant forward on the har, and covered his face with his hands. The examination commenced. The several witnesses deposed to the finding of the murdered body of Colonel Ormond (who had been stabbed in several places with a knife); tbey th n des. cribed the pursuit ; the discovery they had made in the old caatle ruina, and which led them to luspect Marsden of being the perpetrator of the ciime ; the subsequent app ehenvlon of him, and discovering the watch and money ofthe deceased in hia possession. But no power of eloquence could possibly depic ture the sufferings of the unhappy prisoner, as he paced the narrow cell to which he had been conveyed when he was forced away from home. He groaned aloud in the insupportable agony of his thoughts, and wa_ several times inclined to dash his head against the wall, and thus put a ptriod to his miserable existence. What would be the sufferings of his wife and child \u2014 and what must hey now be enduring at the thought of his awful situation ? The idea was sufficient to drive ; him to frenzy ; and what would become of them, ' should he bj convicted of the dreadsnl crime with which he was charged? His wife would never survive his untimely and ignominious fate, and Evelina would then be left an orphan in the wide world, buss_ted about at the mercy of any one, snd pointed at as the child of one who had The steward, Flint, also b wore to the purses and the watch as having be'onged to his late master, and swore to a qua rei which had taken place between the colonel and the prisoner on the afternoon bsforethe murder, and to some violent threats which the latter had given uferauce to which all served to make the evidence of the unfortunate prisoner's guilt the more damning, and excited the most painful sensation in the court.

But a minute or two, and he seemed to regain his foitltude in a great degree, and proceeded in a firm but solemn voice to state all those strange and awful facts with which tbe reader has been already made acquainted, and concluded with another earnest and eloquent ap peal for mercy. Richard Marsden trembled not; he was firm in the consciousness of innocence, although his heart was ready to burst with agony, when he thought of the probable fate that awaited him, powerful as the proofs of guilt were against him, and aB the awful situation of his wife and child aroEe to his imagination. A murmur ran through the court when he had concluded, and his statement seemed to have made the most powerful impression upon ever, one present, except the magistrates and the several witnesses, who consulted together in under tones ; but at length a dead silence ensued ; not the least sound, nor the lowest whiaper was heard; and one of the magistrates, who had been an intimate friend to the murdered man, and was evidently prejudiced against the m serable prisoner, said, \u2014 A pause of a moment or two ensued, after the \u25a0teward had given his evidence. [Maraden raised his head, and fixed upon the merciless Flint a look which would have struck horror and shame to the breast of any other than such an insensible and hardened scoundrel. But he met the glance of the miserable victim or untoward fate and circumstantial evidence unmoved, and a smile of triumph even passed over hls forbidden features. ' This story Is, to say tbe least of it, prisoner, a most improbable one ; but even if it be true, it proves that you have, en our own co -session, committed a most heartless robbery, by appropri ating that booty to yourself which you w- re aware had been plundered from the corpse of tbe mur dered vi.tim, and by conniving at the esc .pe of the assassins.' ' Heartless villain !' exclaimed Marsden ; ' it is you who are the cause of all this ; with the malice of a fiend, and for what I know not, you have pursued me. You are the \u25a0 urderer of an Innocent man, his defenceless wife, and un offending child. Oh, man, man, if such indeed you are, the curse of God, before whose terrible judgment-seat you must one day appear, will assuredly pursue you for this.' 'To that I plead guilty/ aniwered Marsden; 'but I was mad \u2014 driven to despair and d-pera ti_n by the tbou .ht of my starving wife and child, and scarcely kne . wtiat I did.' ' You hear him, gentlemen/ said Flint, appealing to the magistrates ; ' you hear wiat the frenzisd conscious less of guilt urges him to \u25a0ay. I claica your protection while I speak the truth, and seek alone for justice on the base and cowardly assassin of my lamented master.' ' Prisoner/ said one of the magistrates, ' this language will do you no good. We sit here to render justice, not to listen to the wild invectives of tho.e who stand charged against the witnesses summoned to give evidence before us. If you have anything to sayin your own defence, we are ready to hear you.'

It was some time, however, before any thing like life was restored to them ; and then Mrs. Maraden, after lo king wildly around her for a second or two, snatched the little Evelina frantically to her breast, and sobbed aa though her heart would break.

With melancholy hearts, Mrs. Goodson and her husband returned to their cottage ; they saw, plainly enough, that nothing whatever could save Richard Marsden from the fatal and dreadful consequences of the weight ofthe overwhelming evidence that had been brought against him, although they felt firmly confident of his inno cence ; and how Jeeply did they commiserate In tbe misfortunes of that unhappy family. Limited as their means were, they would willingly have done their best to support Mrs. Maraden and the little Evelina, until providence should have raised something up in their behalf; but now that they were consigned to the tender mercies of the parish authorities, they could not but entertain the apprehension that their miseries would be rendered complete ; and should Mars den really be convicted, could they ever survive his horrible, ignominious, and untimely fate! Oh \u2014 no; they were certain that they could not ; Thus spoke the Reverend Mr. Cantall, and he and hiB worthy colleagues left the bench and the court together. 'His reverence is too good, too kind, too humane, to interest himself in this manner with such wretches as these,' sail, one of the con stables, helping to ratae the insensible forms of Mrs. Mar .den and her child from the floor. ' I should think it waB quite enough to tax people with the keep of real paupers, without burdening the parish with the wives and brats of murderers and thieves.

The room contained six stump bedsteads, with miserable straw mattresses, and an old dirty rug for a covering. Five of them were occupied by aged females, whose haggard, starved, and spectre like appearance, plainly showed the hor riDle treatment to which they were subjected. There were two windows on each side of this room, secured with iron bars; aud these over* looked a large yard, where were two or three sheda, in which the ' able-bodied' paupers were employed in various disguating and laborious avocatiens ; but that which more immediately arrested the attention was a stone building, of black and prison-like appearance ; and, in truth, it was so, and that of the worst description, com monly called ' The Black Hole.' Into this dread ful place any of the unfortunate wretches who were considered to be refractory were thrust for days, weeks, and even months together, in dark* ness and in filth, with scarcely a BUfficient allow ance of black bread and water to suetaln their wretched existence. not; and thus by one fatal blow would that wretched family be Bwept off. Aad when Mary Goodson, who was a most lovely and amiable girl, about fifteen year, of age, and her brother Felix, were informed of the result of the day, their grief exceeded all bound ; particularly the latter, who loved bis litte playmat whom he never expected to see again, with all the innocence of youth. Most of their poor neigh bours also deeply sympathised in their sorrow, for the MarsdenB had been universally respected, while their cruel oppressors were as much de tested, particularly the hard-hearted steward, Abel Flint, who had ever exercised the duties of bis office with the most unrelenting severity ; and many were the poor families whom he had de prived of a home, and left to beggary. A coroner's inquest was speedily held on the body of Colonel Ormond, aid as the evidence was precisely the same as had been adduced on the examination, the jury felt bound, though with reluctance, to come te no other conclusion and to return no other verdict, than one of wil' ful murder against Richard Marsden. Nothing could exceed tbe sensation which the whole of the melancholy circumstances created ln the neighbourhood; but there were very few that regretted the death of Colonel Ormond, although they expressed their horror and abhor rence of the wretches who had committed so foul a crime, and which had involved one whom they all believed to be an innocent man in so terrible a destiny. Such was the benevolent asylum for those who were reduced to destitution and want, of the parish of Allover ; and the master and matron, Mr. and Mrs. M Doall, were well qualified to be the guardians of this receptacle of death ; and that, we imagine, is saying quite enough at pre sent to give the reader an idea of their character. Poor Evelina trembled with terror when she en tered this wretched place, and clung to her mother, who still remained in a state ot stupified unconsciousness, and stared vacantly around her. Intelligence bad been forwarded without delay to Mr Francis Ormond, the only brother of the deceased colonel, and who was the heir to his immense property. He was residing at Boulogne, and lf report spoke truly, ha possessed all the vices of his brother, and therefore the tenants had little to their advantage to expect from the change. ' Here, MrB. M'D.all/ said the constable who ha^ brought them there, addressing a fat, coarse, burly woman, with a red face, whose general ap pearance presented a most lematkable contrast to the po. r squalid oelngs around. ' Here, ma'am, I have brought you two more lodgers ; and they are recommended to your care by the worthy magis trates/ Mr. Ormond arrived at the castle in a few days, and appeared deeply afflicted at the untimely fate of his brother, and aohorrence of the assas sin, although It repuired no very d.ep penetra tion to discover that he wa3 acting the part of the hypocrite, and that the large acquisition to his wealth more than consoled him for his loss. ' The magistrates !' repeated the matron, with a savage loak, which completely frightened poor little Evelina, if auythicg had been warning tt complete her terror, after having viewed this ter lible place. ' Sonce vagrant wretches, I suppose/ continued Mrs. M'Doall; * too l_zy to work, and without courage to steal, and bo get transported ; and so tbey get themselves foiBted upon us, and think to live a life of indolence, luxury, and inde pendence. But I think they will find themselves rather mistaken, Mr. Snatchem.' The day after the arrival of Mr. Ormond the foneral obsequies were performed with great pomp, and although the melancholy procession was followed by a vast concourse of persona, there were very few that exhibited any signs of regret. Mrs. Goodson and her husband made several applications to the workhouse at Alover, to be permitted to see Mrs. Marsden and her child, but they were peremptorily and insultingly refused ; neither could tbey obtain any answer to their ear nest inquiries after their health. They could, therefore, only come to the most dismal conclu sions, and felt satisfied that they would never rn_re be permitted to leave that abode of misery tlive. Mrs. Marsden and her daughter, on their arrival at the workhouse, were conveyed to one ot the wards, cheerless, dark, and miserable ; it seemed impossible that any human beings could long survive in that wretched place \u2014 the most cruel mind could scarcely have invented a more soul- ' I rayther suspect that they will, Mrs. M'Doall/ coincided Snatchem, with a knowing wink. \u2022I am sure that both I and Mr. M'Doall, who are already such slaves to this establishment, and get bo ciuelly scandalised for our pains, ought to be very much obliged to the uagistrates for tax ing us with this additional burden upon our bands/ * It's all owing to the Christian humanity of the Reverend Mr. Cantall, Mrs. M-Doah,' said Snatchem. sickening den in which to punish iqualid poverty for its misfortunes.

Evelina shrunk still closer to her wretched mother, and endeavoured to make her conacious of what was going on; hut to no purpose, for there Bhe stood, pale and statue-like, as if Bhe were locked in some fearful trance, from which nothing could arouse her. Mr. Snatchem bowed, and smi ed most plea santly at this.

Mrs. M'Doall and the con* stable then quitted the room, bolting and locking the door after them.

Scarcely a ray of sunlight was ad T itted through the dirty windows of that horrible placa, and wbat thtre was only seemed to render its terrors more visible.

The strict hand of the parish, as well as the law, is absolutely necessary.' Every now and then she could hear low moans come from tbe different beds, which p ainly showe that the occupants of them were suffer** ing great agony ; and theie was na one there to administer to taeir wants, and offer them one word of kindness or consolation. Kindness or consolation, in that dreadful den? \u2014 the very Idea was preposterous. ' You are right, Mr. Snatchem, you are quite right/ observed the matron. ' The world ia very much indebted to such peisons as we. But, see, the filthy drink has overcome the creature, and when she is sober, we shall know how to talk to her and to deal with her too.' Evelina could not venture to examine who were her unfortunate companions ; in fact, she almost dreaded to breathe, and the very air she Inhaled seemed pestiferous. The observations of the matron still rang In her ears, and flights us were the c.DJectures they gave rise to. Again Mrs. Marsden, quite exhausted, had indeed sunk up_n the wretched straw _aa( tress which"], [30, "EVELINA, THE PAUPER'S CHILD; 22 which escaped her parent's bosom, ani sh\u00ab moved her form slightly.

Mrs. Maraden did open her eyes, and looked around her, and beholding Evelina, she pressed her to her bosom, and kissed her with frantic fondness. She then passed ner hand across bei forehead, and seemed to be endeavouring to recal her thoughts. * \u00a3he will die/ she sobbed \u2014 ( shB will die, and leave me alone in this shocking place.

In this manner more than an hour elapsed, when Evelina heard the bolt undrawn, and ex pecting again to hehold tbe matron, sbe shrank closer to her mother with a feeling of the most indescribable terror. The door opened, however, aid instead of the dreaded Mrs. M'Doall, two men, clad lu the workhouse garb, entered, 'Mother, mother/ sobbed Evelina, 'do you not recollect youraelf?

Evelina was so weak that she could scarcely Btand, and as for eating, she (elt that would be impossible, but she was afraid to disobey, and she therefore walked timidly to the table, and took tbe bowl from the man. She then dag gered back to the bed, and seating herself on it; perceiving that the m.n were watching her, she pretended to partake of the soup, and put a spoonful of it in her mouth, but the taste was so nauseous that it almost turned ber sick, and even the smell of it was dreadfully offensive. She saw the other poor emaciated creatures rise up iu their beds, aud take tbe portion allotted to them with avidity, and eat it voraciously, plainly showing to what a dread'ul stale of hunger they must have been reduced, by the ' benvolent ' treatment of the workhouse of Allover.

Never, can I and my poor mother partake of such poisonous fare as this. And is this the way that the wretched pauper is treated?

Evelin . in vain clinging to her, and by tears and prayere supplicating her to be calm. The other wretched inmates ofthe ward, alarmed, staggered from their beds as well as they could, and cal'ed loudly for assistance. Hasty footsteps were heard ascending the stairs, the door was opened, and the matron, accompanied by two or three men, rushed into the room. \u25a0 Woman I' exolaimed Mrs. Marsden, in a voice which staggered the matron, ' restore to me my huiband.

Tueir broken sentences, which It would not be very interesting to the reader to quote here, was followed by a very distant resemblance to sieg ing, interspersed with numerous hickups, and then a heavy weight rolled upon the sl <or, ' Dear me/ said the matron, ' that is Mr. M'Doall ; somebody has been insulting him, and it has overcome him, he is so very sensitive. Follow me, for I am afraid he has fallen and hurt himaelf.' ' Gracious me 1' she cried, ' why, tbe woman's mad ! She ought to have been sent to a lunatic asylum Instead of here. Give her back her hus band, Indeed; well I never! Come, come, my good woman, we mu . have none of this nonsense here ; so, if you are not q net, why, we will bave you put in a Btrait-waistcoat in no time/ The wretched woman returned no answer ; she had exhausted herself by her wild ravings of despair, and onoe more sinking on the b d, covered her face with her hands, and burst into a violent flood of tears. Thus saying, Mrs. M'Doall and the men quit ted the ward, and the wretched inmates were once more left to themselves. Evelina sunk on her knees bef.re the matron, and with clasped hands and piteous looks, she exclaimed \u2014 Mtb. Marsden at length looked up; her face was bedewed with tears, and her cheeks were ghastly pale; but the extreme violence of ber anguish had abated and set' led into the calmness of despair. She pressed Evelina to her bosom, and was unable for some time to utter a syllable ; at length she clasped her hands together, and in a voice of impressive solemnity, exclaimed \u2014 ' Almighty Father of all good, look down, I humbly beseech thee, npon thy poor suffering creatures in this their terrible emergency, and release them from the sorrows which now afflict them ; and oh ! most merciful God, watch over my unfortunate huBband, and avert the horrible and ignominoua fate with which he is at present threatened, as thou knowest his innocence. Devoutly did Evelina repeat this prayer after her mother, who then stretched herself upon the hard pallet, and drawing the form of her daugh ter close to her, became totally absorbed in thought. * Ob, for the love of God, madam, do not be harsh with my unfortunate mother ; ihe knows not what she says ; it is the violence o' her grief and despair that overcomes her. Pity ub, lady, for indeed, indeed, we merit it/ Whether it was the application of the title 'lady' to her or the earnest supplications of so young a child, we cannot tell, but certainly she was somewhat tottent ned, and after a pause she said in milder accents than Evelina had yet heard her make nae of \u2014 ' Well, well, I have no wish to be harsh with the woman; no one is treated harshly here ; it is perhaps a falling of mine that I am too for bearant, kind, and indulgent, although I am treated with the basest ingratitude for my pains. If yonr mother is ill, I will send the house doctor and a nu rse to her, but I must not have the place disturbed in this manner/ In a short time the doctor entered the ward, accompanied by an old woman, who was to act in the capacity ol nurse. He was a man mild in his demeanour and tpeecb, and possessed more hnmanity than usuaUy characterises the nature of a parish doctor. He appeared much struck with the careworn appearance and emaciated frame of Mrs. Marsden 1 and after having put several questions to her, he told her that he should immediately order some nourishments for her and Evelina, which he requested that they would take directly, and also said that he would see that they were removed without delay to a more comfortable and wholesome apartment. Ab well as they could, Mrs. Marsden and Evelina returned their thanks for this unex pected kindness. ' Oh, thanks, thanks, madam/ returned Eve lina. * God will surely bless you for any kind ness you may show to my unfortunate parent.' 'But yeu must sleep in another ward, girl, with one of the other pauper children/ said Mrs. M'Doall. ' Ob no, no, no/ cried Evelina, with terror and anguish in her looks ; and again sinking upon her kness, ' do not separate me from my mother, I implore you, or I shall die ; it is only my pre sence that can compose her, and reconcile her to her hard destiny. Fray, lady, do not, oh, do not take me from her.' It certainty must have been the word ' lady' that had the magical effect, for tbe matron was again moved from her usual sternness and seve rity. 'But ohl benevolent sir/ ejaculated Mrs. Marsden, ' shall I not be permitted to see my unfortunate husband? He is innocent! indeed he is.' ' Well/ she said, ' If you behave yourself, I do not mind complying with your request, though it is against the rules to suffer the juvenile paupers to sleep with the elder ones ; but mind me, if I hear any more uproar or disturbance, I will remove you both immediately/ Evelina endeavoured once more to speak her thanks, but emotion choked her utterance, and she hastened to her m ither, wbo waB still weep ing bitterly, which relieved ber heart of a portion ot the excessive anguish with which it was loaded. < 1 cannot say anything about that at present, my good woman/ said the doctor, ' but I will see . what can be done/ \u25a0 Oh, thanks, thanks, my good sir/ said the I poor gratefnl woman. ' God will most assuredly bieBS you for this/ The doctor then departed, telling tbe nurse to j follow him. ' Heaven has raised us up a friend, my dear mother/ said Evelina ; ' this good man will in terest himself in our behalf; and, if we wait patiently, we may sind relief from our present sufferings sooner than we expeoted.

Come, come, get to rest.' ' Rest 1' repeated Mrs. Marsden, 'alas I what rest can poor creatures like us expect to sind in such a place ? Heaven help us! \u2014 Heaven help us 1' ' Alas ! no, my child,' replied Mrs. Marsden, with a deep s gh ; ' think of the terrible situation of your father, and the fearful evidence there is against him, and then say, what is there to hope I They will condemn him ; and oh, horror ! how my heart's blood freezes when I think of the dreadful fate to which he will be innocently eontigned.' S'le sank on herkness as she spoke, and with clasped hands, she mentally, but fervently, sup plicated tbat mercy for herself and her child wliich she could not expect they would meet with there. At this moment the nurse returned, bringing with her some nourishments wiiich the doctor had ordered for them, and of which she desired them to partake. They did, and as tbey had been several hours without food, it greatly revived them. Evelina shuddered, but endeavoured to stifle _Br emotion as much as possible, so that she might not add to the bitter anguish her mother was enduring; but still the kindness of tho nurse, however powerless she might bs, the different aspect of the room they were now in, the attention of the doctor, and several other circumstances, served to impart some degree of consolation to her bosom ; and, looking affec tionately in her mother's face, Bhe threw her little arms around her neck, and tried to soothe ber with her fond aud innocent endearments. ' Do yeu think you can walk V said tha wo. msn ; ' you can lean on me, and I will conduct you to another room, where you will be much more comfortable than you are here.' ' Oh, yes, I will try, although suffering has made me very weak,' answered Mrs. Marsden. ' Come, my child, we wiH together ; at any rate, they will not have the cruelty to separate us.' With th assistance of the nurse, Mrs. Marsden arose from the bed, and then leaning on the shoulder of the former, and taking the hand of Evelina, they left the miserable ward, the very aspect of which was sufficient to excite horror in tho bosom; of those unfortunate beings who en tered it. The old woman was evidently moved by com* passion towards them, and again persualed them to retire to bed, and at length, after having again invoked the protection of the Supreme for the wretched Marsden, they yielded, and the nurse followed their example. It was some time, how. ever, ere either the wretched mother or her daugbt .r conld compose their minds to rest, for the terrible thoughts which racked their bosoms ; but at last nature was completely worn out, and sleep \u2014 refreshing sleep \u2014 came to their relief. And thus wore away the first dreary night in the poorhouse of the parish of Allover. Horrible was the mental sufferings of Richard Marsden in his dismal cell; but his anguish was more exolted on account of his wife and daughter than his own situation, and the fate which in all propabillty awaited him, dreadful, ignominious, and unmerited though it was. They were now, he imagined to himself, the inmates ofthe work house, and ho had heard enough of the brutal doings in the poorhouse of Allover, and of the characters of Mr. and Mrs. M'Doall, to convince him that they would be subjeted to every possible indignity and cruelty. And what would become of them, should he indeed be condemned? He shuddered with horror at the thought, and as he paced the dark and narrow confines of his dungeon, his groans wore terrible to bear. With his clenched hands he struck his burning temples and dashed his body against the cold .amp walls in despair. To have encouraged one ray of hope would have been madness, for every one seemed prejudiced against him, aud how could he refute the overwhelming weight of evidence which would be adduced against him on his trial ? Of what avail would it be for him to protest his innooence, whea he could produce no witnesses to corroborate his assertions? Oh, madman that he was, to suffer tho Ill-gotten hoard to tempt him ; and yet, the abject wretchedness of his situation, the starving state of his wife and Evelina, the brutal insults he had received from the murde ed man and Able Flint, bis mercenary and tyrannical steward, were circumstances that ought, surely, to welgi in his savour, but he knew well that they would not ; that the stern The room they now were removed to certainly presented a wonderful contrast to that which they had left. It was small, but the walls were clean, and there was a oheerful fire in the grate. It had also two beds in it, which were very clean, and there were Borne other rifling articles of fur. ntture in It which added to the comfort of its ap pearance. The spirits of poor Evelina somewhat revived when she beheld it, and a portion of the horrors of the workhoute were banished from her mind. ' You bad better let me assist you to undiess directly/ said the nurse, ' and get into bed with out delay ; you are much exhausted, and if you can get a few hours' repose, it will do you a world of good. I shall remain with you all night, by the doctor's orders, so that if you should want anything, I shall be ready to attend upon yon.' Mrs. Marsden looked at her with gratitude, for such kindness she did not expect. ' Your heart is not insensible to pity, my good woman, _ peroeive,' said Mrs. Marsden; 'and fervently I thank you for your sympathy towards a poor unfortunate woman and her chiid. Never never, did I anticipate that it Would be our bard lot to become paupers. Have you been long an inmate of this bouse 1' ' God help me I' replied the nurse, with a deep sigh, ' for more than ten yeirs, and I wish that I had died before I entered It.' ' Is then the treatment of the wrelched destl. tute mmates so severe V luq Jred Mrs. Marsden, wiih a look of anguish. The nurse shook her head.

The steward lo.ked round upon the spectators with a frown of contempt, and then took his place a no.i. the other witnesses. * # # The assiz.s, has as b:en stated, were now on, and the day which had been fixed upon efor the trial of the unfortunate Richard Marsden at length arrived. It came in, dark, che erlss, and tempestuous, a. if portentous of the dreadful fate which awaited the wretched vie. m of cir cumstantial evidence ; and the humble neigh bours ofthe accused man looked sad and sorrow ful, for they could not believe him guilty, and they anticipated wi h feelings of horror the awful tngedy which, in all prol.it. llty, would shortly be enacted. But what chance wa. there of h s acqiictal when he had no thing but his own solemn protestations of innocence to refute the frightful charge against hia? None; and they therefore made up their minds to the worst, and c uli only deeply lament the miserable fate of that unfortunate family. Mr. and Mrs. Goodson were present; and the painful anxiety and fearful thougiita they were enduring, were plainly visible in their counte nances. Tbe judges now to*k their seats upon the bench, and the prisoner waa ordered to be arraigned at the bar. A death-like silence per vaded the court, aod all eyes were fixed upon the entrance where the accused would be brought in. He was conducted nta the dock by the officers, and again a murmur of commisera* tion, and half stifled prayers for his acquittal, escaped the breasts of numerous of the anxious spectators. But none were more deeply distressed than the amiable family ot the Goodsons ; for tbey viewed the poor sufferers with the same regard as if th.y were their own relations, and would williugl. have made any sac isice in thetr humble power to serve them in this awful hour of trial. Again and again had Mr. Goodson and his wife supplicited the parish authorities to be permitted to see Mrs. Marsden and her daughter, but in vain ; they ony received insul s for their pains, and they were compelled to relinquish their efforts in despair; and to imagine to themselves the sufferings to which they were exposed in that abode of wretchedness, tyranny, and oppres sion. The unhappy man had undergone a most re markable change during the few short days he hid been incarcerated. His once manly and robust frame was worn to a complete sfceletoD, and he was but the mere phantom of whai oe had formerly been. For an instant he raised his eyes, and having bowed respecfully to the j u !gea, looked around the court ; but in the con fusion and despa:r ot his thoughts, he did not seem to recognise any one. Hia countenance was as ghastly pale as that of a corpse, but his lips, although livid, quivered not, and there was an expression of conscious innocence in his demeanour, which forcibly struck every one. Ho was accommodated with a seat, aad thea the trial proceeded. Vainly would we seek to give even a faint idea of the anguish, the maddening anguish, of mind and body that Mrs. Maraden and Eveliaa were suffering ; with no one to pity them, Bave the poor, helpless old nurse ; and she only in secret dared to evince any commiseration to- j wa-ds thorn. The unhappy woman had been made acquainted with the day appointed for the ' trial of her ill -fated husband ; and she could not ' but look forward to that day as one on which he ; waste bs legally murJered ; for that h- would i escape conviction she did not dare to hope.

The doctor had, to no purpose, attempted to administer to Mrs. Marsden a powerful opiate, in order that he might throw her into a state of unconsciousness, which would have been an act of mercy to her at that terrible- crisis ; she successfully resisted every attempt to force ber to take it ; and the more they sought to persuade her, the greater her frenzy became, while Evelina added her tears and supplications to those of hsr mother, and induced them to desist. At length the dreadful moment arrived ; the jury re-entered the box ; all eyes became rlvetted upon them; silence waa proclaimed; and the usual question having been put, the foreman, in a low but distinct voice, pronounced the, fearful verdict of \u25a0* Guilty.\" A thrill of horror ran through the court, and Richard Marsden sunk forward in the dock, and buried his face in his hands in despair. The doctor thought it would be useless to keep the result of the trial a secret from the unhappy woman, as Buspeuae might prove even more fatal than certainty, and he therefore desired, t~at when It waa Known, it should be communicated to hsr as cautiously and tenderly as possible. Tbey also endeavoured to persuade the poor child to leive the room as the trial was far too great for one of her tender years ; but she clung to her parent with terror, who held her frantically to ner bosom, and called d >wn the curses of Hear en upon the heada of those who should attempt to remove her ; and the doctor, there fore, Buffeted tbem to remain together. A painful pause for a few seconds ensued, and then tbe judge put the solemn question to the culprit, \" What he had to say why judg ment of death should not be passed upon him ?\" The unfortunate man once more raised his head, and fixing a vacant look, first upon the judges, then npon the jury who had condemned him, did not at fir. t seem to comprehend the question that had been put to him. But at last he re covered himself, and made such a pathetic appeal to the judges, and again so solemnly pro tested his innocence and horror of the dreadfol crime of which he had been convicted, that it must indeed have been an insensible heart that could have remained unmoved. Abel Flint, however, fixed upon the miserable man a look of malicious triumph, and marked with contempt the feeling of abhorrence with wbich he was viewed by the majority of persons assembled in the court. In this manner another dreadful tour passed away, and Mrs. Marsden and Evelina were left entirely to the care of the nurse, who did all that she could to console them, but with little or no effect. The doctor at length re-entered the room, and Mra. Marsden flew wildly towards him, and grasping his arm, and looking into his countenance, as if she would read his every thought, exclaimed \u2014 ' Now, now, tor the love of God, keep me not in suspense; my unfortunate husbands Oh, tell me, are yon the messenger of good or e.ilf The doctor shook his head. Another painful pause ensued, when the judges put on their black caps, and proceeded to complete their solemn and revolting task. The unfortunate Richard Marsden was sentenced to death. ' Ah!' cried the frantic woman, in a voice so appaling, that It resounded through the ._o!e house, ' they have murdered him I The monsters have accomplished their inbuman task, and doomed an innocent man to the gallows I Let me go ! let me go! I am guilty as he, and we will at leaat die together I Off, off\"! Oh, horror, horror !' It was at this awiul moment that the writched man seemed to lose all self-posseaslo? ; and horror, the most nsupportable, agonised his frame, wben he found that every hope waa at an end. Large drops of perspiration stood upon his brow, and hurried down his cheeks; and it was truly appaling to witness the look he fixed upon th\" judge, aa he clasped his hands together and exclaimed \u2014 She could say no more, her strength failed her, and Bhe sunk lifeless on the floor, while Evelina, with a piteous shriek, fell insensible on her bosom 1 * Mercy, mercy I spare me for the sake of my wife and child!

With sorrowing hearts didtold Dame Goodson and her husband return to heir home after the conclusion of the trial, aud the doom of the unfortunate Richard Marsden was sealed. And many were tbe tears that amiable family shed tbat night ; and the prayers they offered up to Heaven to interpose between him and his fearful and unmerited fate. Felix and his sister were overwhelmed with grief and horror, and their parents were too much distracted themselves to attempt to impart to them any consolation. And what would be the unspeakable torture, of Mrs. Marsden, aud the little Evelina, when they should be informed that all hope was at an end, and that tbe terrible vengeance of tbe law would certainly be carried Into effect. Tbe bare Idea was awful to encourage. Again he Btruggled with the turnkeys in the wildness of his despair; but t. is strength was completely exhausted, and he sunk down on the cold et .ne- bench which served for a seat, and sobbed and wept like n infant. It was a sight to move even the stern hearts of the turnkeys, used as they were to such scenes, to pity, and for a moment they viewed the condemned with emotion. The two turnkeys were ordered to remain with him constantly until the fatal moment arrived, which tbe law had decreed should terminate his existence; and oh, what a night was that to the wretched man ! He thought alone upon hiB w ife and tender, innocent offspring ; iu imagination he witnessed their be&rcre-tding agony, their terrible despair \u2022 he heard their shrieks of horror wbeu the certainty of his untimely and shameful fate was announced to them ; and it was wonder ful that his heaitstrlngs did not burst a-su rider, or tbat reason did not immediately quit her seat and leave him a raving maniac. But a lew honra must intervene, and he would perish on the Bcaffoid, exposed to the gaze of a rude and un feel \u2022 ing populace; be who had never wilfully itjured a human being, and hls wife who had been the patient unmurmuring partner of all his woes, and that poor girl on whom hia own soul doated, would be :ett destitute \u2014 the inmates of the parish workhouse, and soaffold, and pointed at as the wife and offspring of a r. urderer ! These thoughts were worse than even a thousand deaths would have been; and Richard Maraden could have wept tears of blood. And must he never again be allowed to behold them in this world I No, the dreadful decree was past, aud they coyld ex pect no mercy on this Bide t _e grave. Alas I how fervently he regretted that they bad not all perished of want, rather than that they should have been brought to such a revolting fate. Thus he continued to ruminate, and awful were the groans of anguish and despair that escaped his breast. It was a terrible thing to w at oh the emotions of that unfortunate man in his condemned cell \u2014 to Dote his g_a-tly and vivid countenance, his blood shot eyes, his con vulsed frame, and heaving bofcom. It was still more dreadful from the solemn silence that reigned around, and which waa only interrupted at interval by the deep and impressive toaes of the prison bell, which told the rapid flight of time, and near approach of that hour when he must die by the hands of the executioner ; and then to hear occasionally his shrieks of despair, as he called upon tne names of his wife and Never could the poor old people forget the looks of the wretched Marsden when his sen tence was pronounced. Still did his frenzied supplications for mery seem to ring iu their ears, and freeze the very blood in their voins with horror. Sleep that night was a stranger to the inmates of that humble dwelling. The following mornlog Mr. Goodson and his wife once more proceeded to the wo k house, aod again requested to be permitted to a;e Mrs. Marsden and Evelina; but they were, as tbey had been on every occasion before, peremptorily refused, and they were even threatened with being sent to prison if they dared to annoy them with their visits again. The good people were, however, determined not to give up all hope, and tbey therefore resolved to call upon one or two of the Jurymen who had seemed to enter tain a doubt of Marsden'a guilt, ln order that they might ascertain whether or not any steps could be taken by way of a petition to avert the tenlble fate to wbich tbe unfortunate and inno* cent man had been sentenced. They were received by these gentlemen with every kindness and courtesy ; and so far did they succeed, that they obtained a promise from them to get up such a memorial as they requested, and to get the names of all the influential persons they could, appended to it. We need not say how unbounded was the gra titude of Mrs. Goodson and her husband ; and they returned home with renewed hope, trusting that the Almighty would never Buffer an inno cent man to perish in so awful a manner. But not a moment was to be lost, for ou tbe following Monday the awful sentence of the law was ordered to be carried into effect. Mrs. M .rsden continued in a state of utter Insensibility lor several hours, after she had re ceived the fearful intelligence of the conviction and condemnation of her husband ; and Evelina was not without much difficulty restored; and the doctor gave it aa bis opinion that it was extremely doubtful whether so young a child could ever survive bo terrible a shock.

Dreadful were the hours that succeeded ; and as the day of the execution rapidly approached, aud all hope seemed at an end, the suffering woman was obliged to be waiched night and day by two or three persona, and Mrs. M Doall complained most bitter 7 of tbe trouble and responsibility that waB thus placed upon her shoulders by the wife of a felon, who ought to have been con signed to a madhouse in the first instance, instead of being sent there. The awful morning appointed for the execu* tion at length arrived, and all waB terrible ex citement, suspense, and horror among the humble inhabitants of tbe neighbourhood ; and many respectable individuals who had known Marsden as an honest industrious man, and who, not withstanding the conclusive evidence whioh had been brought against him on his trial, could scarcely believe that he could ever have been guilty of so frightful a crime as murder \u2014 these persons had signed the petition with alacrity, and it had been forwarded, with as little delay as possible, to the proper quarter; but np to the , fatal morning no answer had been reoeived, and it seemed but too painfully evident that the law would be allowed to take its course. Exhausted by these dreadful exertions, the distracted woman fell back on her bed, and, clos ing her eyea, seemed to be completely worn out; large drop* of perspiration bathed her temples \u2014 her pale and ghastly features were distorted, and altogether Bhe psesented a spectacle so awiul that the little Evelina's horror became almost in supportable; and it was iu vain tbat the other peraons present tried to rranquillise her. 1 She is dying, she is dying I* sobbed the child, 1 aed I thail b.

It is your poor Ev.liaa who implores you ; oh, if it is tbe will of God to take ) ou from me, let me die with you, my oeioved parent \u2014 let me die with you.' The poor woman did open her eyes at the sound of her daughter's voice, smiled faintly upoa her, and then pressed her with convulsive emo tion to her thr bbmg bosom, but she Beemed in- capable of speaking. The anguish of Mr. aod Mrs. Goodson and the children was almost as intense as that of the doomed man or his wife and daughter could be ; 1 and when tbe morning dawned, and still the j petition remained unanswered, they gave them** j selves up to ab. o ute despair. In va-n had the doctor humanely tried to com- . pel the wretched patient to take a sleeping draught; and indeed such was tbe Intensity of her agony, that it is do-b'fnl whether anything would ha . e beeu powerful enough to h .ve steeped her senses in forgei fulness.

'No.no, dearest mother,' said Evelina, im printing fervent kisses upon the cold lips of her parent, ' they will not part us ; the looks of this good gentleman tell me they will not. R .vive, revive, mother, and apeak to me ; if it is only one word, let me hear the beloved tones of your voice again.' Eight years had winged their rapid flight since the occurrence of the sad events related in the 1 previous chapter. E'ght years I And what re- markable changes have taken place in that period , of time. Eight years of bitter suffering had they been to tbe hapless Evelina, whowas stiU the wretched I inmate of the parish woikhou.e of Allover \u2014 the tender, meek, and submissive victim of the cruelty of the brutal ma.ler and matron, and without a friend in the world to whom Bhe could appeal for redre_a, or who would view her sorrows with a pitying eye. No; where <ould the poor | felon's daughter hope to look for compassion ? \u2014 A mercy would it have been to her had she long since b 'e pt the sleep of death in the pauper grave ' of her unfortunate mother. The Hps of Mrs. Maraden parted, aud st.e made an effort to speak, but could not, and could only embrace her hapless child more fervently than before. A dismal silence of about ten minutes ensued, which wa. only interrupted by the heart-rending sobs of Evelina, and the doctir and tbe matron stood by i_ _ gazed on, expecting every instant to ses tbe suffering mother breathe her last. It was now the hour at which tbe execution waa appointed to take place. Twelve bad sructe by the woikhouse clock, and tbe doctor looked significantly at Mrs M'Doall, as much as to say * The dreadful tragedy Ib over, and R chard Mar_ d -n haB paid the penalty of his crimes of which he was convicted.' And what was V e fate of Richard Marsden? The sentence of deal, had u. \u25a0 n commuted to transportation for life, aua Lo i__ v dragged the felon's chain far from his native land, and iu hopeless misery. Mr. and Mrs. Goodson had long rested in the Bilent grave ; \u2014 Felix waa ploughing the wide and perilous deep ; and his sister having obtained a j situation in a nobleman's family, had not been dL near her native place for several years, and was \u25a0 at present in London. Painful were the thoughts ahe bestowed upon the unfortunate comp_n'ou of her childhood ; and m&ny wera the tears she shed when she reflected npon the sufleriogs Bhe was probably enduring, if sho still lived; for she never hsd been enabled to obtain any information relating to her, and was less alone to dismal con jectures and forebodings of the worst. He stooped down and pereelved tbat the dying woman's features were becoming more fixed and rigid, and that she breathed shorter and quicker. Aga'n, with a look of gentle persuasion, he tried to remove Evelina, but he could not, and lVirul cf disturbing her mother in her last moments, he desisted. At this n clar.choly juncture, a quick and heavy footstep was heard ascending the _ta'rs, i and the doctor hastened to prevent the lntru \u25a0len of any one into the chamber of death; but I befoie he could do so, the door was thrown open, and the coarse and vulgar person and besotted j countenance of Mr. M'Doall made their appear ance. It ia an old-fashioned house, situated in rather ( romantic part of tbe country, to which we must j now convey the reader, and remove the action of our drama. The doctor pointed to the bed, and placed hiB fingers Bigoiflcantly on his lips ; but Mr. M'Doall, who had evidently been partaking of something more powerful in its effect than water, took no heed of his caution, but nodded his head, and winking one eye, observed \u2014 A very old house It was, probably as old as the ; two oak trees which stood on either side of is ivy-mantled porch ; nor could it boast of any architectural beauty; aud having beeu patched up and modernised in different portion?, presented something of a grotesque and ' outre' appearance. This fabric was kDown by the name cf the Dark HaU, and certainly the name was q_ite in keep ing with its gloomy and sombre appearance. 'Hem! ha! -I see \u2014 dying; but they havn't hung her husband, much to the disappointment of a numerous congregation ! He is respited.' ' Respited !' repeated the dying woman, in a moment recovering her speech, and starting up j A smail village, or hamlet, waa contlgiucu. lo"], [38, "EVKLINA, THE PAUPER'S CHILD; OR, 30 1 No, no,' answered Linsjston ; ' I do not feel altogether well.

' It ia the weather, sir, I dare say,* remarked the housekeeper ; ' which, to be sure, is gloomy enough ; but la, sir, why should it trouble you or me, surrounded, as we are, by every comfort that the heart could wish for ?' F_ul Langston was an old man, over whoso head some seventy winters bad passed. H'.s htow was wrinkled, and his -..it was white as the driven snow, but his frame was still stout and robust, and showed tha'. in bis younger days he must have possessed great muscular strength and vigour. His featuiea still retained all the remains ot' a handsome man ; but their was a restless expression at times in his eyes which seemed to say that the mind was a stranger to ease and content. ' Every comfort?' repeated Paul with a peculiar look; ' yes, \u2014 yes, you are comfortable enough, I dare say, but as for me, I hare _t times my re ftecti-ms, my moments of remorse., and then, and then I am miserable.* ' Dear me, Mr. Langston,' said Mrs. Snaeks; ' what can you ever have done to repeat of? You have always been good, amaiable and charitable.' ' Woman !' exclaimed tbe old man, with a bitter look, ' you mock me by that fulsome flat tery. I have never been goo _, amiable, or charitable. I defy any oue to bring forward a single proof of my exhibiting these good qualities. I have had plenty at my command, and allowed those who had every claim upon ray affections to be perishing of want. It is eight years th's very day since the unfortunate Richard M .rsden, the husband of my own niece, was doomed to die a death of shame upon the gallows, for a crime of which, 1 belieye from my very soul, be was innocent; and poor Lydia died broken-hearted in the parish workhouse.

The union had been far from a happy one, and it was said that Paul did not evince any remarkable s:gns of grief at her death. How ever, he behavei very well to her son, notwith standing he was a wild, .hsipated young man, and had associated himself with some of the moet disreputable characters. Paul Langston *as reporte. to bs rich ; how ever, be that as it u-ight, he waa very parsi monious in his habits, was never known to give a shilling in charity, and had no other domestic in his house than a middle-aged widow, named Mrs. Snacks, who a.ted as his housekeeper, and who was at all times and all seasons most sub- Bervient to his every whim, whether from dis interested motives or not will be seen anon. ' But, sir,' remarked Mrs. Snacks, ' allow me to repeat that I consider you have nothing what ever to reproach yourself with. If Richard MarBdeu waa idle and improvident, it waa no duty of yours to support him in it ; aod if he was afterwards guilty of that dreadful crime of which he was convicted * It was a most cold and Inclement December diy ; the hoar froH bound every brook and Stream, and the snow which had been falling almost incessantly for geveral days, lay so thick upon the ground, that the roada were rendered quite impassable. 'If he was guilty 1' interrupted Langston, passionately. ' I tell you, woman, that he was not guilty. 1 knew Richard Musden too well to think for a moment that he could have com mitted a Bingle set of dishonesty, and, therefore, hia soul would shrink appalled from tbe bare cou temRation of murder. He was an injured, a cruelly injured, man; and instead of being re duced to a life of slavery, if he bad had hia rights, he would now have been the lord and master of Charrington Abbey, instead of he who now luxu riates in the wealth.' Mrs. Snacks was sitting at needle work, in her little room, before a cheerful fire, and paid no attention to the miserable weather without, or to those poor creatures who were exposed to it ; In fact, Mrs. Snacks was one ot those easy sort of woman, who nevertrouble themselves to contem plate the gloomy side of things, and who thought that, while she was snug and comfortable herself , she had no business to take upon herse f to in quire who was not; and, she considered, that while theie were eo many par sh workhouses, and such heavy poor-rates, it could only be the truly obstinate who would persist In being house less, and in distress. ' My dear sir, Mr Langston,' said the house- keeper, * I'm sure you cannot mean what, you Bay ; and should Lord Sidley * * What care I for Lord Sidley?' demanded Paul ; ' he is fully aware that I know him, and tbat too for a villain. But \u2014 bot I do not feel welt; my mind ia disturbed, what with these thoughts, and the constant visits of that grace- less ion-in-law of mine, Stephen Bla k thorn, of whom 1 cannot help entertaining a secret dread.' 1 Dear me, Mr. Lang.t n,' said M^a.

I have the means, and it is my duty to snatch her from the miseries of a work house, and to become her future protector. Oh, what sweet consolation it would be to me to contribute all iu my power to her happiness ; to remove the gloom of care and neglect from her youthful brow, and. perhaps, te win her grati tude, her innocent affection.' 'I 'am sure, sir,' said the housekeeper, to whom the expression of this detrmlnation was anything but pleasant, ' I am sure, that you will think better of thia ; Stephen will ref.rm, I dare say, as he gets older, and ' * As he gets older !' interrupted Paul.

Woman, I have no patience to bear you talk thus; but get you gone, and biing me a glass of brandy-and-water \u2014 I will try if that will revive me and dissipate these gloomy thoughts .' Mrs. Snacks was astounded; In imagination Bhe already behold her air-built castles annihl lated, and herself banished from a situation in which she had already r e ape. so many advantages, and where she hoped to gain the consummation of her highest ambition. It was very fortunate for her that Mr. Langston did Dot look at her, being too deeply immersed in his own meditations, or he must at once have read her thoughts. For a moment or two she was so bewildered that she knew not what to say ; but at length she did ven ture to make an observation. Mrs. Snacks was surprised at this order, for it was very seldom that her master indulged in wine or spirits, and ahe hastened to obey it, with the hope that it would serve to banish the gloomy mood which at present beset his mind, and which was anything but agreeable to her, as she knew not what effect It might ultimately have upon him and which might operate to her disadvantage. When she returned to the room, she found him still seated in his arm chair, with his head resting upon his hands, and buried in profound meditation. ' Why, yes sir,' she said, ' if you could get the poor girl some respectable situation, to be snre, it would be better for ber than remaining in a workhouse , and she ought to feel very grate* ful for your kindness.' ' Pat the brandy on the table, and take a chair, Mrs. Snacks,' he said, when he observed her ; ' I would have a few words with you.' Mrs. Snacks courtesyed, and took a chair'im- \u2022 mediately, highly flattered by the unusual con descension of her master, aud curious to know what he had to Bay. ' Send her to service I' ejaculated the old man, with a frown; 'no, no; tbat would indeed be adding insult to inj ustice and neglect. You seem to misunderstand my meaning, Mra.

Stephen Blackthorn was a tall, stout man, about forty years of age. Hi3 countenance was not bad looking, and as he had received a liberal education, and was not quite destitute of natural abilities, he could, when It answered his pur poses, conduct himself as a gentleman. His principles, however, were of the basest order, and there was scarcely anything that be would hesitate to do, to obtain the gratification of his wishes. inqu'red the housekeeper, biting her lips with vexation, and feaiful that if she remained any longer, she should betray herself. ' No, no,' answered her master, ' you can leave me.7 Mrs. Snacks courtseyed, and quilted the apartment. 1 So,' sfce s .id, when she had got to her own room, ' this is a very pretty resolution ; and the woikhouse brat is to be brought here, to be placed above me as my young mistress ? The old fool! But I'll see whether I cannot frustrate his plans. I sincerely hope the victim is dead, or if not, why not let her remain where she is ? It has become her home, and, I dare say, she is very comfortable in It. I must see Stephen upon this subject as soon as possible, or this amiable turn in the old fellow's mind will ruin us both.' On the death of his father he became possessed of a considerable sum of money, which, however, he quickly squandered In acts of dissipation, and afterwards brought his mother to the verge of ruin. He then became connected with some of the most depraved of characters, and it was even suspected that he w*s implicated iu some tran sactions for which his life, or his liberty, would have been forfeited had the offences have been proved against him. The marriage of his mother with Mr. Langston he hailed at a fortunate cir cumstance, and soon contrived to ingratiate himself into the good graces of the old man, from whom he extorted large sums of money at dif ferent periods, which supported him in bit career of folly and extravagance, and he looked forward to his death with anxiety, for he flattered himself tbat be should come into possession of the greater portion, if not the whole, of his wealth. It waB a most extraordinary thing that Paul Langston, who had hitherto never been know to part with a single coin to any of his nearest and needy relations, or any other persons, should become thus Infatuated with Steven Blackthorn, so that there was scarcely any demand that he might make upon hls purse, which he could re fute; but so it was, and Blackthorn did not fa'l to take every advantage of the power he posses sed over him. Mrs. Snacks became more and more enraged and alarmed the longer Bhe reflected upon the unexpected circumstance, and she had not the least doubt that Mr. Langston would keep his word ; for she knew very well that he was a man who, when he had made up his mind to anything, could not be diverted from it. She had scarcely suffered these thoughts to enter her mind, when she heard a loud kr.ock at the outer door, and, on opening it, Stephen Blackthorn entered. 1 Is the old gentleman in his room ?' he de* manded, chucking Mrs, Snacks under the chin, with the utmost familiarity. 1 He is,' answered the housekeeper, ' and In such a strange temper as I never saw him in be fore ; I have much to tell you after you have seen him, Stephen ; and unless we nse some prompt measures, we shall both be ruined, I can tell you.' 'Ruined!' repeated Stephen; 'why, what's the matter now ? However, I must see him; I have another demand upon his exchequer to make.' \u2022You have aleady tired him out, Stephen,' said Mrs. Snacks ; ' and he has said ouly this very afternoon that it is his determination not to do any more for you.' Stephen now associated with some of the most fashionable libertines in the country, and being a man of Infinite mirth, his society was eagerly courted by sucb characters. ' Not do _ny more for me ?' He had early formed a connection with Mrs. Snacks, and on the death of her husband, he con trived to get her engaged by his father-in-law as bis housekeeper, knowing that in her he should find a clever and ready instrument for the work ing out of his plans. In the frequent quarrels that took place between his mother and Mr. Langston, Stephen Blackthorn always espoused the cause of the old gentleman, and by that meanB h -. prepossessed himself more than ever in his favour, and blinded him completely to his faults, Mrs. L .ngston died, and Stephen pos sessed more po wer than ever, and entertained a strong hope that he should be enabled at last to induce old Langston to execute a will in his favour ; but In tbat he was disappointed. The repeated deman.s of Stephen upon his purse begau to shake the confidence of Mr. Lang ston, and he reprimanded him for his extrava* gance, telling him tbat If he continued thus to supply his wants, he must ultimately bring him self to ruin. Stephen presented to be very pen! tent, and made great promises ; and the further to carry out his views, he said that he wished to set tlein some way of business, in order that be mi^ht ' No.' ' Oh, the old boy must have been in one of his mad freaks when he said that he would cut me off with a shilling.

In this design of the profligate Blackthorn, the only end he had In view was that of getting the means for a wider range of dissipation ; and he thought that by blinding old Langston with a pretended repentance of past indiscretions, and a seeming amendment in his ways of life for the tuture, he 6hould be better able to keep pace with his dissipated companions, moat of whom commanded by far more money than he could ; indeed, be had often been compelled to borrow sums of money from several of them, some of whom had hinted to Blackthorn the expediency cf his coming to some kind of settlement with them. Blackthorn had bad his eye for some time past upon a farm ac some distance from the Dark Hall; and if he could but get Mr. Langston to advance the Bum necessary to purchase it for him, he imagined that he should be at the height of what he, with bis evil passions, considered hap- COLONEL ORMOND VISITS THE COTTAGE OP RICHABD MAKSDEN, more wealthy associates, and he was fearful tbat unless he showed some intention or the means of repaying them, he might be deprived of their future friendship, whicb, to a man of his dis position and habits, was most invaluable. In this emergency, to whom could the un principled spendthrift apply but to old Paul Lang ston ? and yet this waa a task which even h\u00ab, in spite of all his boldness and indifference to shame , now shrank from ; and it was not until he was driven to the very last extremity, that he re luctantly compiled with tbe stern necessity. Again in spite of all old Langston had said, notwithstanding his attachment to his gold, piness, and be then enabled to launch out into all tbe wild extravagances at which his more wealthy companions were such accomplished proficients. The old man was prevailed upon ; the farm w.is purchased for him, and for some time he seemed to have abandoned his old habits entirely, and to have beconae quite steady ; but be did not carry on this deception long ; in fact, he launched out Into such a scene of reckless Imprudence, that he became Involved in greater difficulties than before ; the farm was heavily mortgaged ; independent of which, he had borrowed con siderable Bums of money from his abandoned but No. 5."], [42, "34 EVELINA, THE PAUPER'S CHILD; \u00ab Wall, well,' he ejaculated, impatiently, ' what would you now ?' which would not allow him to relieve his nearest relations with a single penny, even when he knew that they were plunged into the lowest depths of penury and wretchedness; again and again he yielded to the demands of his profligate son-in law, and thus pandered to and encouraged his vices. Yet although he did so now, it w_s more from a secret feeling of unconquerable dread which he entertained of Stephen Blackthorn, than any .flection he bore towards him. In tha course of these several interviews, Blackthorn had let drop certain hmtB, almost amounting to threats, which excited the old man's utmost alarm, and he began to find that he had entan gled himself in a snare, from which, he appre hended, it would be no easy task for him to ex tricate himself; and however stern might he the resolutions he at times i .rmed in bis mind, it was extiemely doubtlul whether he would have the courage to adhere to them, when he should be put to the test. Bitter cause had tbe aid man to curs j the hour when he gave his hand to Stephen's mother, and thus become unconsciously the victim ef a profligate villain, who would stick at nothing to accomplish his extravagant desires. ' Why,' answered Blackthorn, ' I have merely called to pay my respects to you, and to inquire after your health.' ' Ahi' said the old man, with a look of sus picion and contempt, 'you \u2014 you are very kindi Stephen ; no doubt you are very kind, and very anxious about my health ; but \u2014 but I am quite well \u2014 that is, I \u2014 I am not well this afternoon \u2014 my mind is ill at rest, and I would be aloue. Dj you mark me, Stephen? I would be alone.' 'But my society may revive you, sir, and bhake off the gloomy effects of the weather.' 'No, no, I am not disposed for company. I shall find enough to do in communing with my own thoughts.' ' But pardon me, Mr. Langston,' returned Blackthorn, determiued not to be repulsed, ' I would speak to you.' ' Another time, another time.* 1 Nay, Bir, my business will admit of no delay, and I know you are too kind to refuse me ' ' And what would you demand of me now?' said Langston, sternly; 'more muuey, I sup* pose?' * Why, Mr. Langston, you have already been so good to me that I almost blush to admit that I do once more oome to solicit your a.si.tance; but it is on a most pressing occasion.' And now, at times, would the recollection of the misery of his neg-eefe . relatives rueh upon the brain of old Paul Langston ; the melancholy death of his niece, and the wretched, and as he firmly believed, the unmerited fate of her un fortunate husband ; and bitterly did his con science repro_ch him when he recollected that he, possessing an abundance, might have pre vented this misery, and had the happiness of contributing to the comforts of those who had a claim to, aod so well deserved bis benevolence, instead of squandering his gold upon an un principled li be 'tine ; who, perhapa, at some future period, would seek his destruction. Some times when these thoughts haunted his brain, Paul Langston waa driven almost to madnees; but a feeling of shame prevented him from seek ing to render that justice to the poor child which he had denied to her unfortunate parents; and from the same feeling he even neglected to in quire after her, or to ascertain the kind of treat ment she experienced in the workhouse. 'Ahi I thought so,' remarked the old man. 'You seldom come to me, Stephen Blackthorn, but to make a demand upon my purse ; and hitherto I have been foolish enough to yield to your request, until I have nearly impoverished myself. But I can do no more, I can do no more.' ' No more, sir?' repeated Stephen Blackthorn, with difficulty suppressing his rage ; 'you do not mean that, I am sure.' 'Indeed, I do; alrea.y have I pandered too long te your folly and extravagance.' ' My folly and extravagance ! Am I to be re proached with my misfortunes?' ' Misfortunes, pshaw ! at the gaming-table. I tell you I can do no more (or you at present. You must depend upon your own exertions.' ' But consider, sir, how I am involved ; and if you refuse me, there is nothiog but beggary and ruin for me.' But to return to that part of tho narrative from which we have thus slightly digressed. Stephen Blackthorn ascended the staiis, and without knocking at the door, he cut red the room. Langston, who had continued wrapt in tbe deep and painful meditation In whish Mrs. Snacks had left him, started on beholding his son-in-law, aud the expression ot his counte nance convinced the profligate of the kind of teception he was likely to meet with. However, he was fully prepared ior it, from whatthe house. keeper bad intimated to him, and he was deter mined not to be daunted. ' I am sorry for you, but caunot help you ; re' collect what I have done lor you ; the large sums of money you have recklessly jquandeicd and all this I have .one, and left my own un fortunate relatives to perish of want. But pro bably their offspring is still alive, although she is the inmate oi a workhou.e, and has been so for many \u2014 many yeare. She must be the object of my future care and solicitude, and by my con\u00ab duct to her, I will endeavour to make some atonement for my cruel neglect of her unfortu nate parents.' ' G.od day, father,' he said, in the most faml liar tone, and extending his hand towards the old man. P_ml rejected it, and the frown became darker on his wrinkled brow, as he said \u2014 ' F .ther ! b_h 1 I am no fathe- of yours ' ' At any rate, you have ever bi-en so to me, sir,' said Stephen Blackthorn, with a well-as sumed look of regard and reverence, which, how ever, bad not its usual elf.ct upon Paul. ' The ofT-priug of a man who brought disgrace u-jon your house I' Stephen could not help re marking, bitterly; ' the daughter of a thief aud a murderer I' 'Itisfalss, Blackthorn,' returned Paul sud denly; 'although Ric_ard Wars len wai con victed of that in_U'j>a . crime, I do beluve that he was as innocent of it as I am; and I trust"], [43, "OR, POVERTY, CRIME, AND SORROW. 35 hat Providence will yet bring to light tbe real assassins.' beggary stares me in the face ? And you, Mr. Langston, may repent this refusal of my last request.' A slight emotion of rather a remarkable character passed over the countenance of Stephen Blackthorn as tbe old man thus expressed him self; but he checked it, and obierved \u2014 ' Those are strong words, Stephen,' said the old mao, in a faltering voice ; ' do you mean to threaten me V ' Well, veil, they might have been mistaken, although the evidence against him was certainly very strong. They might have been mistaken, to be sure.' ' No,' replied Blackthorn, again Bubdniog bis indignation ' but you must make some allow ances for a man placed in my desperate si tua tion ; you .re the only friend I have in the world, and if you fail me, try hopes are a'l at au end. I have promised to meet Mr. WellerdoD, in London, by the day after to-morrow ; and if I do not keep my word, it 'a all over with me 1' * Besides,' said Langston, ' should it even be true that Marsden was guilty, why should this poor child have tosuff.r for the crime of her un happy parent?' 'Oh, I dare say she is comfortable enough in 'the workhouse,' Baid Blackthorn ; ' but no matter, tbat is no bu-iness of mine, and Tin sure I wish the poor girl no harm; why should I? But now, my dear sir, let me again appeal to you, and I am certain, in spite of all you have said, you will not refuse me. One of my credi- tors in London is very pressing, and unless I see him immediately, and come to terms with Men, I shall be entirely ruined; but on the con- trary, if I susceed In coming to some _nder- atanding with him, I have no doubt that I shall, ere long, be able to recover myself, and to repay you these sums of mocey you have at particular times been so kind _3 to advance tome.' Paul Langston reflected for a few minutes; he dreaded to lefusc Stephen, and yet he felt convinced that the money was not intended for the purpose he staged it to be, and that it would not rei eve him from his future extortions ; still, if he were going to London, he might not be annoyed by him for some time, and in the mean while he might devise 6ome scheme to rid him self of him altogether, and that idea de:ided him ' Well, Stephen,' he said, ' I do not wi.h to appear to be hard with you, although I, hav\u00a9 already done so much for you, and you know that you have not the slightest claim, no more than of friendship, upon me. I will let you have the sum you ask, and hope that you will pu it to a good purpose, lor, remember, it is the last I can do for you at present, and that it entirely depends upon your own conduct what I may in suture be induced to do for you.' ' Repay me ?' said Langston ; ' no, no, I do not expect it. I forgive you all, Stephen, but I repent that I cannot do more for you.' ' Nay, sir, you surely will not refute me ; and I solemnly assure you that this stall be the last time that I will trouble you. Now I think that about a hundred pounds would be sufficient to do all that I require, and I shall ever feel most grateful for the obligaiion you will thus confer upon me.' ' Thanks, my dear s-r,' said B ackthorn, taking the choque wbich Paul presented to him , ' I knew you would not refuse me, and you r_a> depend upon it I shall not be forgetful oi your kindness.' ' A hundred pounds 1' repeated the old gentle man; 'what for you to squander io the vices and frivolities of the metropolis ? No, Stephen, I think I have tried you long enough ; and once for all, I tell you that I cannot advance you another guinea. Think you It is likely I would reduce myself to beggary merely to encourage vo. in your Improvident career '\u2014Leave me, leave me.' ' Well, well,' returned the old man ; * I dare say you wil! not ; but leave me, I am in no hu mour for any further conversation. When d.> you depart (or Londoo?\" ' To morrow morning ' answered Stephen. ' 'Tis well,' thought Mr. Lntgaton, and the profligate having wished him good day, quitted the apartment, and made his way to the mum o: Mrs. Snacks, his mind agitated with f.cliogB of alarm and vexation. * And so, Mr. Langston,' Bail Blackthorn, unable any longer to cunceal his rage, ' you will not assist me when misery and ruin stare me in Ihe face \u2014 when a few pounds only would save me, and enable m-e to redeem my circumstances, and probably to obiain a situation in life of respectability and independence ? However, I am determined, let whatever may be the con sequences, I will obtain the sum I require by eome means or other.' This was in do small degree augmented, when the housekeeper made him acquainted with all the particulars __ what had transpired between her and Mr. Langston. ' S j,' he exclaimed, gnashing his teeth ' the old icol woull introduce this woikhouse brat into the bouse, and discard me altogether. But if fortune do not desert me, I will crush his hopes, and m. ke my own triumph secure.' ' Stephen Black'horn,' ejacula'ed Paul, look ing earnestly at bi m, and a feeling of dread taking | ossession of his besom, 'what would .ou do?' ' Probably the girl Is no more,' said Mrs. Snacks. 'Ah,' ejaculated Blackthorn, \" that suggests t j me an idea. The master of the workhouse of Allovei and myself are well acquainted, aud I have no doubt that by rewarding him for his trouble, I can prevail upon him to aid me io my plans. The ghl must be reported dead, whether or no, and then all will be well. I will see M'Doall without delay; he ia just tbe sort osman to eater with readiness into any scheme ot villany. ' Nothing but what is honourable and just, sir,' a_swered Stephen, ' if the opportunity be offered to me ; but if not, I will not hesitate at any thing to avert tbe evils with which I am threatened, however desperate it may be.' 1 RsBh man, forbear, and reflect upon what you would do.' ' Reflect ! of what use is reflection, when ' We must be careful how we proceed, and"], [44, "36 EVELINA, THE PAUPER'S CHILD ; OK, whom we trust,' said Mrs. Snacks, \u2022 or we may not only spoil our schemes but get ourselves into trouble.' ' Oh, never fear that,* returned Blackthorn, ' I will use every precaution, and will not rest until I have the wealth of old Paul Langston secure. I will call at the workhouBe to-morrow i on my way to London.' Thus sayiog, he departed from the house. Mr. Langston felt his mind greatly relieved when Stephen Blackthorn had quitted the room ; but s-ill there was something in the words and the looks of that man which increased his fears and suspicions. \u25a0 And yet why should I submit to the continual demands of this spendthrift?' he said. 'Why should he come upon my purse to support him In his career of vice and profligacy ? He has no claim upon me, and I have been a fool to suffer myself so long to bs infatuated with him. A fool ! no I I have been a heartless villain to support him in his nefarious course, and yet Buffer my own rela tion, that poor unprotected child, to linger out a life of wretededness in a workhouse, without even bo much as making one inquiry after her. And perhaps she is dead! Surely a child eo young could never survive the honors of hi r mother's death, and the fate of her fathsr ; and, if so, my too late formed intentions are frustrated, and the stings of conscience will render me miserable for tho rest of my days. But I will lose ne time in banishing this painful suspense. I will Imme diately write to the parish authorities.' But then a thouiand other doubts and fears arose in the old man's mind. How could the child behold with any other feelings than those of disgust and horror that relation who had behaved with such neglect and cruelty to her parents? Would she not rather remain ln tbe woikhouse, harsh even as might ba the treat ment she experienced, than place herseif under the protection of one whom she could never trust, and towards whom she could not entertain any feeling of esteem I True, the parish authorities would, no doubt, be very glad to re lease themselves from the burden, and to consign her to his care, but if he could not win her regard, his hopes would not be half accomplished. Such reflections continued to rack the mind of old Paul Langston, until the darkness of evening had set in ; and still he remained in his room fexming innumerable plans to forward his wishes. He was glad to think that Stephen Blackthorn was going to London, and he hoped that something would occur to detain him there, for he might present some obstacle to his scheme, as he could not but believe that he would be jealous of the child, should he get her beneath his roof. More dismally howled the wind, and faster fell the snow, and the horrors of the night ex ceeded that of the day. The gloomy thougts of Paul Langston gained strength ; and a melan choly foreboding crossed his mind of something of an extraordinary and important character being about to happen. He walked towards the window, but the dreary scene which presented itself to his view chilled his heart, and once more he resumed his seat before the sire, and gave himself up to meditation. Scarcely had he done ao, when a snrieK eo piercing, so appalling (which seemed to proceed from immediately beneath the window), saluted his ear, that it made him start 'rom his seat and tremble. Never had he heard anything so piteous or awful. Such a cry It was as would proceed from the unfortunate victim of the assassin's knife ; and it chilled the blood in Langston's vein . as he listened to It. 'Gracious Heaven I' he exclaimed, ' what can be the cause of that pitiful cry ? Is it some poor, houseless wretch, exposed to all the ho/rorB of this inclement night, and here am I surrounded by every comfort, and to whom the voice of charity has ever appealed in vain ? Ob, fortune, how unfairly are thy gifts d stributedl Histl what sound is that I' It was a low, wailing sound, which seemed to proceed from the same spot, and which gradually died away until it could be heard no more. Mr. Langston immediately lar.g tbe boll, and Mrs. Snacks quickly made her appearance. * Did you not hear It ?' demanded LangBton. Mrs. Snacks looked at her mas er with an air of stupified amazement, and began to entertain a strong suspicion that he was mad. 'It, sir/ she repeated; 'for goodness sake, what ?' ' Ths shriek, that dreadful slunk, just now, out&ide,' returned Paul ; ' did you not hear it, I say?' ' No, indeed, I did not, sir,' returned the housekeeper; '\\ou must have been mistaken; it could only have been the wind, which, to be sure, howls dismally enough.' 'No, no,' said Mr. Lai gston, ' I could not mistake that mournful cry. It surely proceeded from some poor unfortunate who, ruobably ls peiishing of cold and hunger. Attend me, Mrs, Snacks, I must be satisfied whether or not any person requires our assistance.' He took up the candle as he Bpoke, and moved towards the door, and Mis. Snacks more and more astonished and alarmed at the sudden symptoms of humanity he evinced, reluctantly followed. Having descended the stairs, with much dif ficulty they opened the hall door, owing to tbe large quantity of snow that had drtsied against it ; and no sooner bad they succeeded in doing so, than a violent gust of wind extinguished the light, and left them ln total darkness. * There, sir, I told you,' said Mm. Snacks ; 1 what Is the use of carrying a candle out of doors on such a night as this ? Besides, you will eatsh your death of cold if you venture cut into tbe frost and snow. It was only the wind you heard, depend upon it ; who do you think would be mad enough to venture out such a n'ght as this ?' 'Hold your silly tongue, woman/ sa'd Mr. Langston, angrily, ' and go and place a light in a lantern. I am determined to be satisfied ; quick, lor the life of a fellow creature may depend upon it.' Mrs. Snacks obe. ed, muttering to herself as she proceeded : ' Well, the old gentleman has certainly tiken jeave of his senses, or he would never think ol"], [45, "OR, POVERTY, CRIME, AND SOURO .V. 37 converting the old hall into an aBjIum forthe destitute.* The wretched object of Mr. Laugstoi.'s rnxiety was a young girl, ..pa ient)y not more than fifteen or sixteen years of age, and miserably clad. Beautiful and innocent \u00bbas ihe counten ance they gazed upon; but it was awiul to see the dreadful ravages which care, want, and long suffering, had evidently r_a_o in so young a thing. The light form was the veiy perfection of grace, although much emaciated, and cold, pale, and inanimate aa she was, .he looked lite some exquisite marble statue. Mr. Langston first listened attentively, but no sound met bis ear ; then he railed, but the voice of the wind alone answered him, and the thick falling snow waa driven so violently towards him, that he was forced to retire tor shelter behind the door. He waited impatiently for tbe return of the housekeeper, who seemed to be as long as she could, for tbe purpose of vexing him, but at length she came with the lantern, which her master took from her, and prepared so issne from the hall into the open air ; but Mrs. Snacks. not at all liking the aspect of the night, loitered behind. Even Mrs. Snacks could not help gaz'ng upon the unfortunate giil with feelings of pity and admiration, and exerted herself to the utmost to restore her, by chasing Lei limbs, and endea vouring to impart warmth and animation into them, whi.e her master stood by, and gazed upon the insensible girl with the greatest anxiety. Old Paul Langston found the task he had imposed upon himself not a very easy one, and he had no sooner emerged from the hall than he was nearly up to his knees in snow. However, nothing daunted, he made his way throu h it as well as he could 'owards the epot from whence he Imagined he bad heard tbe shriek, calling upon Mrs. Snacks to follow him, which ste did with no small share of reluctance and the greatest difficulty. ' Hapless child 1' he ejaculated ; ' alas 1 what could have brought her into this wretched situa tion ? So young, and so lovely, too. How unfortunate it is, that, in consequence of tbe snow being so thick upon the ground, we cannot procure the aid of Dr. Leeson. ' Oh, do riot be alarmed, sir,' said Mrs. Snacks, 4 the poor child will recover, I hope.

Aud such may have been the fate of that poor, destitute child, who ' Mr. Lai'jgsttn held the lantern above his head, in order to accelerate his view, and he had no sooner gained the spot to wbich his attention was attracted, than be uttered an exclamation of astonishment, which caused thc housekeeper to exert herse f to the utmost ; her curiosity being excited, and on coming up to her master, she found him stooping down and gazing upon some object wbich seemed to excite his deepest Interest and commiseration ; aud Mrs. SnackB looking moic closely, was astonished to ete a human form, partially buried in the snow, and apparently lifeless. He could not fioish the sentence, for the vio lence of his emotions choked bis utterance. \u25a0Nay, sir,' said Mrs. Snacks, still continuing with increased energy, her efforts to recover the unfortunate little stranger, 'why shculd you indulge in these gleomy thoughts .

Mr. Laugstone's anxiety Increased, and at length his humane hopes were gratified by the hapless object of bis so.icitude opening a pair of the most teauiiful, but melancholy eyes tbat a mortal being had ever been enraptured with ; but, although she gazed eagerly around her, she did not seem to have a perception of anything before her. Mrs. Snacks administered another small i ortion us the restorative to her, and by degrees she seemed to awaken to more consciousness, and gazed with an expression of amazement, not unmlngled with terror, upon Mr. Langston and _is housekeeper. 4 My poor girl,' said the former, in the most compassionate accents, ' be not alarmed ; jou are safe now.

Mr. Langston raised the inanimate form of the unfortunate in his arms, and again waded through tbe mow towards the house, preceded by Mrs. Snacks, with tbe lantern.

But what were the emotions cf the repentant Mr. Langston as he held Evelina's tender frame to his heart and wept mingled tears of anguish, delight, and gratitude upou her pale cheeks? He could not give utterance to them, but raising his eyes towards heaven, mentally offered up a prayer of thanksgiving. That night Mr. Langston felt a happ:er man than he had ever done before in his 1 fe, and Evelina for the firs*, time ior many years reposed in comfort. But so sudden and so gieat was was the change which Bhe had experienced, that she could scarcely persuad . herself of its reality. She had been prevailed upon to partake .lightly of some refreshment, and notwithstanding ihe unparalleled sufferings she bad undergone, and the manner in which her frame bal been reduced, and her constitution injured by years of cruelty, she now felt gieatly revived, and after having poured forth her gratitude to Heaven for her pre serration, and the unexpected prospect that now opened upon her, Bhe fell asleep. The only dissatisfied person of the three actors In this adventure was Mrs. Snacks, and when she was alone in hsr chamber, she gave free vent to her vexation What an unexampled crueltiea had been in flicted upon poor Evelina, in that abominable place, during the eight years she had been an inmate of it ! and there was no one to Wiiom she could appeal for protection. No one who was permitted to Bee her ! she was, indeed, a priso ner left entirely to the tender mercies of the inhuman master and his wife. The old nurse who had evinced such kindness towavo's her a__ her unsortuaale mother, was dead, aud the doctor had been dismissed for his humanity, and a heartless unfeeling man was put in his place; so that, in (act, she had not a single friend, how ever humble, to interfere in her behalf. We left her at the death of her mother, from whose ghastly corpse s .e was taken, and con veyed insensible to another ward, in which a number of miserable, half-starved, friendless children like herself were confined, aud whose haggard looks and atteaua'eu frames plainly showed the brutal treatment to which they were sulj.cted. The doctor, however, was unrernlt ting in his attentions to her, much to the annoy ance of Mr. and Mrs. MDoall, who consi dered that it was both unnecessary and prepos terous to take aoy trouble about th. Use of a pauper child, who, it was their opinion, had no business in the world at all. 4 Who could have thought of such an occurrence taking place ?' she muttered to herself. * Who could have believed that at tbe very critical juncture of time when old Langston had resolved to make inquiries after the girl, accident should place her under his roof, and in so short a time effect all that he was so anxious for ? Fortune frowns upon the wishes of me and Stephen, and what will be his astonishment and rage when he comes to know what has taken place ? This Evelina must be removed by some mean, or other, or all the hopes wbich I and Blackthorn have bo long formed will be entirely annihilated. Isold Paul keep in the same humour be is at present, there can be little doubt that he will make ber the heiress of all his wealth, and en tirely turn his tack on Stephen Blackthorn. This must and shall be prevented. Why did cursed fate guide tbe lootsteps oE the pauper hiiher, or why did she not perish in the snow ? I am dis tracted and bewildered, and Stephen will be on his way to London befors I can make him ac quainted with what has happened, Oh, how my feelings revolted from the task of having to re - ;over the hated being; sooner could I have administered a deadly poison than the restorative [ gave to her; and yet I shall be compelled to tilay the hypocrit*, or my plans will all bs frus trated, and myself ano Stephen detected.' 4 The poor child will not be here long,' said the doctor, ' for In my opinion, It is next to an impossibility that one so young and whose tender constitution has been so greatly impaired by want and suffering, can survive such a terri ble calamity as the death of her mother, and the fats of her unfortunate father.** 4 Well,' returned the matron, * it will only make one pauper less in the world, and goodness knows there is enough of the varmint without her. For my own part, I think it would be better for the child if she were to die.' ' Perhaps it might,' said the doctor, with a significant look ; ' it would save her many years of suffering and persecution.' 4 Persecution, indeed !' retorted the matron, tossing her head, aud looking dagger, at the doctor ; ' what do you mean to insinuate by that, Mr. Mildman ? I'm sure, neither I nor Mr. M'Doall ever persecute any one ; we are far to> kind and indulgent to the ungrateful wretches placed under our care, and that's the reason they take advantage of us. Persecution, indeed I Wel', I like that.'

The Almighty may yet prove your father's innocence, aod restore him to you; but at present you must consider him as no more.' 'Well, I'm sure I' said the matron, within creased rage ; ' I have come to something to be lectured in this manner, as if I were one of the most inhuman and unnatural beings in existence . You had better take the girl out of the work house altogether, Mr. Mildman, and bring her up yourself, since you seem to take io much interest In her.' 'Unfortunate girl,* said MlldBo.n, 4 try and compose yourself under this dreadful trial, and God will help yon. The Almighty may vet prove yoor father's Innocnce, and restore him to you; but at pieeeut you must consider him as no more.' 1 1 wish it were in my power\u2014 I would wil-* Hngly do so,' returned the humane doctor. From that moment, Mrs. M'Doall made up her mind to hate Evelina, and punish her more severely than any of the other young unfortu nates who were placed in her power : and well she kept her word, as wi'l be shown in thc course of the narrative. 4 No more 1' repeated Evelina, wringing her bands, and weeping more bitterly than ever; ' both gone, both dead \u2014 then I am indeed left alone. G.d help me, and take me to Himself. Ah, I remember all now! My poor father was accused of shedding human blood ; he was tiled and condemned to be \u2014 oh, I cannot repeat tha dreads u 1 word. Horror ! horror 1' It was two days before Evelina was restored to any degree of consciousness, and life was only sustained by passing some soothing liquids be tween her lips. The first question the poor child asked was \u2014 what had become of her dear mother? The doctor shook his head, and pointed significantly and solemnly towards Heaven. Eve- Una understood him, and the whole dreadful truth rushed upon her recollection. She pressed her hands on her eyes as if to shutout some frightful spectacle, and her tender frame w- s convulsed with the most indescribable agony. The doctor tried all that he could to console her, but with little prospect of his humane wishes meeting with success. ' Your father did not die, Evelina,' he said ; although such was the awful sentence passed 4 D.ad, dead!' she said : 4 my mother dead t And shall I no more hear hsr beloved voice ? Shall I never again be enfolded iu her fond em brace ? Oh I why am I left here ? Why did I not die too?' upon him ; mercy was extended to him, and the time may come when you will meet agaiu.' 'Yes, in heaven!' sighed the child, 'but never again upon this earth. They have banished hi _i from his native land; they have loaded him with chains, and will inflict upon him a lingering death of torture. Cruel, cruel men ; and they would not permit me to see him agaiu, that I might imprint upon his lips my last fond kiss, and receive his farewell blessing, era they tore me from him for ever I' 4 It is the will of Heaven, my poor child,' said tbe docter, in his kindest accents ; 4 and, however severe the trial may be to yoa at pre sent, you must learn to submit.' ' But may I not see her cold remaiss V cried the dis*r_cted \"girl. 4 May I not be permitted to kiss her cold and icy lips, which ca a so more return my fond salute ? Oh, take me to my mother's corpse, that I may pay my last solemn devotions to ber memory !' Again her tears burst forth ln torrents, and at length, completely exhausted with the violence of her grief, she sank back ou the bed in a state of apathy. ' Your mother's remains are consigned to the grave, my child,' said tbe doctor. Mr. Mild maa left her to the care of the nurss, and desired that every attention should be paid to her by the old woman ; and those orders Mrs. M Doall was afraid to countermand, although her will was good enough to do bo. And so they were; a pauper's grave con tained all that remained of what was once so pure and lovely. 'Buried!' sobbed Evelina. 'And shall I indeed never aga u behold her? Oh, it was most cruel to snatch her from me thus.' Evelina continued in much the same Btate for several days, and was unable to leave her bed, aud was deaf to all the endeavours of Mr. Mild man and the nurse to console her. Indeed it was surprising that the poor, afflicted child was enabled to bear up so well aa she did, and that she did not sink at once under such dreadful calamities. But she was reserved for many more, if not sevorer, calami'ies. She burst into a violent paroxysm ef tears and sobs as she sp_ke, which tbe doctor did not attempt to restrain, for he knew that it would aff.rd her relief; and in this manner several minutes elapsed, and the poor child's excessive agony of grief was quite heartrending to behold. 4 Spirit ef my mother now in heaven,' she solemnly ejiculated at last, clasping her little hands vehement'y together, and ra;sing her innocent countsnaoc towards that sacred place to which she appealed, 4 oh, look down upon your poor, suffering child, and protect her, left help less and friencless as she is. But,' Bhe aided, as a sudden and terrific thought dished upon her braifl, ' my poor father, where is he ? Why is he taken from me? Why am I not permitted to see him? Ob, you wi 1 not, at least deprive me of his protection. My father I take me to my lather, that we may weep our tears together to the memory of my mother I' At length, when a month had worn away, Evelina became more tranquil and resigned, and owing to the skill tnd persevering attention of Mr. M'ldman, she was so far restored to convaN c.cence, as to be able to leave her bed. But it was melancholy to behold that young child moping abiut with all the carewora looks of age, aud buried in the darkness of her own sad thoughts. Th _t countena ace whic _ ihou'd have been clad in the sunshine of happine.s and childish playfulness wa_ ever wrapt in gloom; and those eyes which sh.uld always hav* spoken with lnno;ent joy, was ever dull, tearful and languid.

She recol lected all that that unfeelin g and ignorant woman had said on tbe melancholy occasion, when Bhe and her mother were first brought to the workhouse, and Bhe shuddered with tenor as she reflected upon them. And to think that she must re ma n in tbe power of a woman who was evidently destitute of all seeling filUd her breast with more terror than all. How fervently did the hapless child pray to the Almighty to take her ; for sad and dismal as was the prospect before ber, what had Bhe to hope for? The wretched faces of the children, like herself, half- starved and broken spirited as they were, added to her agony and despair, and proved to her too keenly what she had herself to expect. They were afrai l to speak to each other, for the con stant dread of punishment was before their eyes, and restrained their tongues ; and thus they were deprived of tbe little consolation that con versation might have afforded them, and pro hibited front communicating their sad thoughts to each o her. For the first two months Evelina was tieated with much more kiudnesi than she bad antici pated, and had belter food and a larger quantity given to her than her companions. How often would she willingly have parted with her own meal to appease their hunger ; and tbe sorrowfu and greedy looks with which they eyed her plainly showed the horrible state of want to THE MEETING OF MARSDEN AND HIS WIFE AT THE TRIAL. which they were reduced ; 1 ut she had no oppor tunity of indulging -n her wishes, for there was always some one to watch them, and such an offence would have been certain to be followed by a severe punishment. the 'hole.

But we must pass hastily over the many cruelties wbich Evelina had to endure during the long period that she was an inmate of that awful place, and come at once to the circumstance which prompted her, in a fit of desperation, and reckless about what became of her, to attempt to escape. 4 Ob, for God's sake, madam,' supplicated the poor girl, driven almost to a state of madness, ' you will not be so cruel as to suffer me to re main in this dreadful place, where I must die of cold and terror.' Sick and worn out, she had one day been unable to accomplish the task allotted her, and humbly, but earnestly, implored the forbearance of the inhuman matron. The answer the wretched girl received was a violent blow, whicb stretched her insensible upon the earth, 4 Die, then, for what I care,* said the wretch ; 4 of what value is the life of a felon's brat, like you?' 4 No, no, no, you cannot mean it ; you will not leave me here,' almost shrieked the despair ing Evelina. 4 My heart sickens, and my blood freezes, at the thought. Ob, surely I have been punished enough for the offence which I have uoavoidly commits. . In pity, then, release me, madam ; oh, do not have a deaf ear to my sup plication 1' When she recovered, she found herself in darkness and horror; she was a prisoner, with several unhappy beings like herself, in that horrible prison which was j -stly designated ' the Black Hole.1 The only bed provided for her was a heap of straw, and a filthy rug to cover her from the piercing winter's blast, which swept In fearful gusts in at a small grated hole made high in the wall by removing one of tbe stones. The effluvium tbat arose from this horrible dun geon was loathsome and sickening ; unwholesome damps dripped from the cold stone walls, and vermin sported, with unrestricted liberty, over the floor. 4 Very clever, very clever, indeed,' sneered the matron ; ' no doubt your felon father and vagrant mother took great pains to instruct you in the part you were afterwards to play ; but it will have no effect upon me, girl ; here you shall remain until you have learned better ; and, m.rk me, if you murmur or complain, the whip shall be applied to tame you.' How the blood of the pauper girl curdled at the brutal remarks of the mitrom ; she fixed upon her a look of reproach that would have stung any but the most insensible heart, but returned no answer ; and pressing her hands upon her aching temples, she sighed deeply, and sank upon the heap of straw in despair. Her sen-es realed, and for a time she became unconscious of the horrors of her situation. And yet in such a frightful den as this was the innocent and delicate Evelina confined \u2014 shut out from every hope, from every comfort. It was a wonder that the poor girl did not immedi ately expire with terror; she sank on her knees, and rent the air with her cries. The agonising moans of her fellow prisoners, many of whom had been confined there for several weeks, accompanied her, and rendered the terrors of the place more appalling. Alas ! there was no one to heed their lamentations ; there was no one to pity them in their misery. Then she rent her hair, and beat her breast, and, throwing her. elf into a state of insupportable agony on the floor, her feelings overpowed her, and ber senses left her. The morning dawned, but the faint light that was admitted through the hole in the wall on'y Beived to make the horror of the place more visible, and to reveal to her the ghastly, spectre like looks of her fellow-pri** sonerB ; and, heart-broken and despairing, she clasped her hands together, and implored tbe mercy of God. For more than a week, Evelina remained in this horrible place of confinement, suffering all the tortures of fear and hunger ; so loathsome was the food that was supplied her, that it was only a very small portion of it that she could, with much difficulty, eat aud that made her sick and ill. Constaetly did she pray for death to release her from her sufferings, yet still, although delicate as her constitution was, it bore up in a most extraordinary manner against that which would have killed much stronger persons. Had she been kept confined there much longer, however, she muBt have become an idiot, and already her reason began to totter on its seat ; but a length her brutal oppressors relented, and she was removed from the prison, and placed in the sick ward, where the doctor, by the orders of M'Doall, pa:d every attention to her, he probably having the fear of a coroner's fnq _est before his eyes ; and indeed her frame was bo reduced by the punishment she had received that her situation was a most precarious one.

The Inhuman woman looked upon them all, especially Evelina, with an expression of fiendish exuitation; but our heroine, unable to control her feelings, fell upon her knees belore her, and with streaming eyes, aud in freDzied accents, implored for mercy. 4 Oh, madam,' she cried, ' what have I doae to merit such a dreadful punishment as this?

To increase her hopes, the bricklayers bad been at work at the wall whicb surrounded tbe building for two or three days past, and a ladder \u00abai placed at each side ofthe wall to enable them to carry on their labours. The way to liberty was then easy, hut all that our heroine wanted was tho opportunity when she might not be watched, and that could not be obtained in the daylight, when all eyes were upon her. But her prayers were not heard, and she recovered once more to linger in her dreary career of wretchedness. Frequently had she thought of attempting to escape, for although she knew not a friend in the world to whom Bhe could apply for succour and protection, surely all mankind could not be ao cruel as to view her miseries with indifference, and refuse her relief. Some charitable person might take her into service, and, oh! how will ingly would she toil and do the commonest drudgery for her support, and to obtain her 1 bsriy, and to be peimitted to live aod breathe the sa_e as other human beings; and if she cou.d not prove successful in tbat, she could be content to lie dawn aod die, rather than return to that wore than living tomb. She did not dare te communicate her thoughts to any of ber companions, lest they should, in the hepe of gaining favour w'.th their heartless oppressors, betray her; but she was more than once half inclined to appeal to the humanity of the workman, with the hope that they would assist her; however, timid and doubtful of what the result might b-, she forbore to do s., and perhaps it was as well that she did. She had heard of the death of Mr. and Mrs Goodson, and therefore all hope there was at an end, but Bhe koew where Mr. Mildman resided, and she could not but thi_k, from tbe kindness he had ever shown her, that that humane man would take an interest in her fate, and try to pro cure her a situation. Yes, to him, then, Eve* lina determined to apply cou'd she but effect her escape from the workhouse; but long and an xiously the hapless girl watched, and no oppor tunity presented itself. The wretched inmates of that receptacle of misery were so strictly watched that it was quite impossible to elude the vigil ance of their oppressors, who, no doubt, dreaded the consequences of an exposure, should one of tbem escape. During the whole of that day on which our heroine had resolved to make the hazardous attempt, if possible, the mentally prayed to Providence to aid her, and invoked tbe spirit of ber mother to wa'ch over her. It was a miserable day; the snow fell fast, and the men had been unable to pursue their labours, so that they could not obstruct ber in her daring pro ject. But the horrors of the season somewhat daunted her. How could she wander in such a storm ? and wbat was to become of her witbo at a shelter, and thinly aud miserably clad as she was . She must perish in the frost and enow. However, death would be far more welcome, even in that dreadful form, than the life of extreme wretchedness she was at present leading, and, in spite cf everyihing, she was determined to run the risk. Being considered s.fliclently recovered, she was now again placed in the ' oakum shed,' and doomed to a repetition of tbe same severe tasks to which she had been before subjected. And there the poor girl toiled, with the dread of the powers of the B'iack Hole before her eyes, till the blood gushed from her fingers, and her delicate frame was eo exhausted, that it was with diffi culty she could move her aching limbs. But no pity, no mercy, was extended to her, and Bhe ceased to appeal to the brutal wretches for it, for she knew it would be useless, and that sbe would probably receive not 'only taunts and abuse, but punishment also. 4 Surely,' she thought, ' some kind person will take pity on my youth and misery, and aff-ird me a temporary shelter and relief. Human nature cannot be so cruel as to suffer a poor, frieucless, destitute girl to periBh ; aud if I can but reach the house of Mr. Mil .man in safety, he, I am certain, will receive me with kindness, afford me relief, and advise me how to act. Oh, tbat he would take me as his servant, with what a cheerful hea<t would I work to endeavour to repay him for his benevolence. There is nothing tbat I would not do to evince to him my gratitude. He knows the cruelty I have ex perienced from those inhuman people, and he would not\u2014 1 am convinced he would not \u2014 Buffer me again to fa 1 in their power.' The disgusting habits of the master rendered him an object of terror to tbe young females, whom, when he returned home drunk from his nightly carousals, at the hog and Punch-bowl, he never failed to insult by the most revolting lan guage; and even his better half could not at all times restrain him in his. unmanly behaviour. There were many fearful tales rumoured about this man, which, no doubt, bad t_eir origin in truth, but hitherto he had escaped detection, and avoided that punishment which he so richly merited. These saoguine ideas strengthened her resolu tion more than ever, and already the poor girl began to form the brightest hopis of the future. Tbe day passed heavily en, and at length the darkness of the evening approached, aud the labours of tho wretched inmates of tbe shed ceased, and the man who had them in charge came to conduct them to their waid. Now .as tho moment \u2014 the heart of Evblina palpitated violently, and she cast one anxious look to wards the ladder, and then looked towards the man to see whether his eye w_b upon her ; but he was engaged with the other ,>aupei3, and did not notice her. She slunk behind, a_d Evelina still cherished the idea of escaping, and was determined, at all hazards, to make the attempt, the first chance that presented itself. But it wa3 sometime ere the least shadow of hope came to her relief, and it seemed as if she were doomed for life to linger out her days in that awful place. But the time came.

The cold was most piercing, and the snow fell In large slakes clingiDg to her thinly-^lad form, and impaling a shivering sensation \u00bbo her blood. Although it was little more than five o'clock, it was q'llte dark, and Evelina was uncertain which way to go; but she beheld lights glimmering at a dis tance, which she imagined proceeded from the town, and where she had been g ven to under stand Mr. Mildman resided ; and to his house she determined so make her way, trusting that he wfluld not object to receive her, and fluttering hsraeif that the parish authorities would not think of seaiching for her there. suffered her companions and the man to proceed wlthoit hor. She concealed herself behind tho door ot Ihe shed, trembling with doubt and suspense; but the man never once turned his head, and tho poor girl had tho satisfaction \u00bbf eeelng him and those who followed him enter the house, and she was alone. ' God of Heaven ! I Implore your aid in tho hazardous attempt I am about to make,' she exclaimed, clasping her hands together ; and then \u25a0he looked around to make snra that there was no one in the yard, but the coast was e,nite clear. She had no time to hesitate; a moment's delay aod all might be lost ; and should she bo diseovered larking behind, she knew well the terrible punishment that would be inflicted on ber, and it was quite evident tbat she would soon be missed. Fresh courage nerved her, and having secured the coarse food which had been given her, and which she had preserved during tbe day, she advanced towards the ladder and began to ascend it, but tbe spokes were so slippery with the frost, and she trembled so violently, that she could scarcely retain her footing, and was in danger every moment of falling. However, at length she reached the top of the wall, but, to her horror and deipair, she found that the ladder which had been placed on the outer side was removed, and thus all chance of her escaping was apparently at an end. She wrong her hands in despair, and wept bitterly, for it was impossible that she could venture to leap from such a height, and there fore there was nothing left for her but to return, and the horror of tbe punishment she would be certain to meet with made her blood run cold to reflect upon. Every moment, however, that she wasted in deliberation, wai naught with da user, an ti Evelina, committing hersell to tbe care of Providence, pro ceeded ou her dreary way, every now and then looking back, as ahe imagined that she heard the sound of pursuit. CHAPTER IX, THB FURTHER PROGRESS OF EVELINA. \u2014 DIS- APPOINTMENT. \u2014 A FRIEND IN NEED. Such wss the excitement of our heroine that she felt but little of the cold, and her heart bounded with a sensation amounting to Joy, to find hersell at liberty, notwithstanding the missry with which tbat liberty was fraught. But the snow was so thick upon the giouud that it was impossi ble for her to proceed as quick as she wished, and to the town of Allover, it was a considerate distance. She looked towards the house, and at that moment beheld lights moving ln the window over the porch, and could almost imagine that she heard several voi .'es calling npon her name. Her brain turned giddy, and it Is a wonder that she was not precipitated to the earth from that fearful height. Alas I how pitiable was the destiny of this un fortunate .Irl, and yet there was no one to bestow upon her _ word of compassion. At length, breathless with the exertion she bad undergone, our heroine was compelled to pauBe for a minute to recover herself, and then she looked around her with anxious eyes. Dismal and cheerless was the scene which presented itself to her gaze. Nothing but frost aud snow, whichever way abe looked; the face of nature seemed clothed in the ghastly cerements of the grave. Evelina shuddered, and recalled to mind that awful night when she and her mother were famishing in their lonely cottage and awaiting he; father's return.

Suddenly she reached a part where there was some scafolding, which she could with very little difficulty descend, and uttering an exclamation of joy, Bhe cla.ped her hands and raised her eyes to heaven in gratitude. But at that moment she though she heard a confused noise proceed ing from the house, and, terrified, she stepped upon the scaffolding, and began to descend it, which she could easily do by the ladders which were affixed to it.

But at last Bhe mustered courage, and proceeded towards tbat part ot the lawn where the shop of D . ctor Mildman, she understood, was situated. She gained it. She saw his name over the door, but tbe shop was closed, and tho darkness that pervaded every window seemed to give certain notice that it was vacated. A board affixed to the shutters now attracted tbe attention ' No home, no bed, no parents V cried the man ; * no shelter from the pieiciDg wind, and the frost and snow . poor creature, poor c eat u re I But what could have brought joa te this terrible state .

But you must not be suffered to die in the road of cold and hunger, which you will certainly do if you are exposed to the storm to-night. I am but a very poor man, and have a large family, and G.d knows I have a hard struggle to keep them ; but I can spare a meal, and part of one of my girl's bed, to a poor, suffering girl like you, and I know that my wife and the children wi 1 make you welcome.

The poor girl groaned with despair, as she read this. All her hopes were disappointed, and she was left without the chance of a shelter or relief, and on such a fearful night as this, wbat was to become of her t To the town of Elsbury it was many miles, end It would be impossible for her to travel so far without rest, weary, as she already was, and In such a storm. The sanguine hopes she bad so recently formed were now succeeded by the most abject despair ; she took shelter In the doorway, and wept bitterly. She now per* celved the madmsa of her leaving the work house, bad as It was, without being certain of finding some place of refuge, and for the first time she regretted tbat she had done so. Her limbs shivered with the intense cold, and what '1th tbe terror and anguish of her miad, and the Inclemency of the weather, she was so exhausted, that It was not without the greatest difficulty she could support herself ; hut certainly she must perish if she were exposed to tbe 6torm any leDgth cf time. While she thus stood, she was startled at hearing the sound of some one approaching, and faarful that it was some person sent in pursuit of her, she drew herself _p into the smallest space, aed trembled in every limb. How did tbe bosom of our heroine swell at this unexpected kindness , tears gushed to her eyes, and it was some moments before she could s^eak. The individual came nearer, and her appre hensions were, in a great measure, abated, when she perceived that it was a man clad In the garb of a labourer, who was probably returning from his work ; and so preposessed was she with the honest and good-tempered aspect of his counte nance, that she was half inclined to speak to him; but wbat could he do to assist her in her dreadful difficulty ? As he drew nearer to her, however, she could not repress a sigh, which attracted his attention, and he immediately b e h .id her. * Oh, sir,* she said at last, ' I have not lan guage to express my thanks for this disinterested kindness. I am a poor Bimp'.e girl, who ' ' There, my .'ass,' interrupted the honest fellow; 'that's enough; I do not want any thanks for a mere act of common humanity, and I only wish it was in my pov.tr to do more 'or you.

Tbe heart of Evelina warmed, aud the certainty of at least one night's shelter and reat Imparted some consolation to her bosom. 4 Alas 1' replied Evelina, and her voice was broken by sobs, ' I have no borne, no bed to go to.' The peasant knocked at the cottage door, which #as immediately opened by a healthy, rosy, good-tempered-looking girl, apparently about seventeen years of . ge, and who started with evldeni surprise when ahe beheld Evelin*. The latter shrunk back with the greatest timidity, but the peasant took her hand, and lei her into the t.om, where his wife, a comely -looking dame, 4 No home, no bed !' replied the man, and he g3zed at her more narrowly, and with deeper intetest tbanbe;ore.

They rose ou tbelr father's entrance, and welcomed him home with the fondest affection, but, seeing our heroine, tbey expressed a; much astonishment as their sister had done, aud their mother looked at her through her spectacles, and then at her husband, with much curiosity. 4 No doubt you are amazed, dame,' said her husband, ' to see me accompanied by this un fortunate stranger ; she ia a poor girl who has neither home nor friends. I found her trembling in the frost aad snow ; so I knew that you would not object to let her partake of our humble meal, and share the bed with one of our girls to night. Had she been left exposed to the storm, she mast have perished.' Tbe meal was over, and Evelina, turning to Robert and his wl'e, and sit kinj. on her knees, claeped their hands, and only by her tears and sobs could express her gratitude.

As the old woman said this, Bhe kindly took the band of the destitute girl, aad led ber to a steat before the cheerful blazing fire, while her daughters viewed her with the greatest pity, and bustled about to prepare tbe supper. Evelina burst into tears at this unexpected kindness, and at length faltered out \u2014 4 Oh, madam, my heart is too full to enable me to thank you as I ought ; may the Almighty shower down blessings on your hend for this unexampled kindness io a poor destitute strarger.* 4 We are rewarded suflicieutly, my poor girl,' returned the dame, ' in the consciousnesa of having done our duty. But, al .s, what can have reduced you to this deplorable stato ? Have you indeed no parents, no frieods V 4 None, none,' answered Evelina, and her tears flowed still faster than before. 4 My parents rave been lost to me for many years, and since tbat time I have been an inmate of the workhouse ; but I could1 endure the cruelties practised there no longer, and this night I made my escape, and came to the town, thi. king tofiod ihe benevolent Di.

What do you intend to do . 4 Heaven forbid that I should wound your feelings, my dear girl,' rera.rked the dame ; 4 but your observations have excited my curiosity as well a_ sympathy.

Again did Evelina hesitate, and deep blushes suffused her cheeks; but she felt assurei that it was no idle curiosity which prompted the cot tager's wife, and that she would not look upon her with auy the less compassion because she was the daughter o-f a convict ; and she conquered her repugnance, as Bhe replied \u2014 1 Evelina Marsden !\" 4 Make my way to the plaoe where Mr. Mild man is at present residing, if I can,' replied our heroine, ' and see whether it is in his power to assist me; if he cannot, the sooner that death terminates my sufferings the better.' 4 Oh, do not talk so, child,' said the dame ; 1 God will raise you up a friend in your misery when least expected.

May every blessing attend you and them through life, and way you never experience the bitter sorrows it is my heard lot to endure.' 4 1 am certain he was not,' exclaimed Robert; 4 1 knew Richard Marsden at on j time well, and I am confident that, notwithstanding the misery to which he was reduced \u2014 nothing, I firmly believe, could ever have urged him to commit a dishonest act, much more to perpetrate so fright ful a deed!' 4 Thanks, my poor friend,' Bald the amiable girl; 4 and oh, may the clouds that at present darkenyourdcstiny.be quickly dispersed, aud the brightest sunshine succeed to them.' 4 Alas !

' Heaven knows his innocence, and I trust will yet bring the real as.assins to light.' 4 It will, my poor girl,' said Robert, ' depend upon it. But come, cbild, you had better retire to rest, and we w:11 see you in the Morning, and try what can be done for you, in your distressed situation, although our means, as I have said before, are unfortunately limited.

The looks of Helen showed how willing she was that Evelina should become her companion, and how grateful Bhe was to her pare ts for their kin dne 8 a to tbe wretched wanderer ; and our heroine, as she gazed upon her, was inspired with confidence. 4 It would shock your ears, my kmd girl, were I to detail them to you,' said Evelina ; ' the awful scenes that I have there witnessed freeze my blood with horror and disgust when I recal to my memory. Justice will surely some day or other overtake those who are guilty of such atrocities.' Once more she would have sank upon her knees before Robert and his wife, but they pre vented her; and taking her hand kindly, they fervently wished her good night. 4 It will,' replied Helen ; ' but come, Evelina, yon must be quite worn out ; so let us retire to bed, and there is no no knowing what a good night's rest may do for you.' I Evelina could only press their hands in silence, and weep tears of gratitude upou them ; and then Helen having embraced her parents and her sisters affectionately, took up the light and led the way to the clean and neat little chamber, above etairs. Evelina pressed ber hand, and theu sinking on her knees, Helen followed her example, and they both prayed fervently and devoutly to Hea ven. Our heroine arose from her knees much more tranquil, and embracing her amiable companion, she repaired to retire to bed. Helen was quickly asleep, but her unfortunate companion, notwith_ standing she was so much exhausted with the extraordinary exertions she bad undergone, re mained for some time restless, and buried in the most painful reflections. And r.ow happily did Robert Selborn and his dame sleep that night, and heartily did they re turn their thanks to Heaven that they had been made the humble Instruments in rescuing an un fortunate girl from almost certain death ; and deeply larr ented that they had it not in their power to assist her In tbe way their benevolent hearts prompted them to do. Alas I what was to becomes of her ? Wheu would she again know tbe comforts of this night T In a few hours she would again be exposed to the cold, and the gnawing of want, and where would she find a resting place .' who would, like Robert Selborn, take compassion upon her abject misery 1 She feared there were few like him in this world, and that she might wander far before she would again meet with relief. Her only hope rested upon Mr. Mildman, and many weary miles had she to traverse to the place of his residence, and even then she might be disappointed. Mr. Mildman might have changed in disposition in the course of the number of years which had elapBed since she had seen him, and he might not care to acknowledge her, or take upon himself the responisbility of sheltering her from the parish authorities ; and then she would indeed be cast helpless and wretched npon the world, and there would be nothing left for her to do but to return to the workhouse, and to termi nate her miserable existence and her Borrows at once. CHAPTER X. THE WRETCHED JOURNEY. \u2014 THE ARRIVAL AT THE DARK HALL. It was many years since Evelina had witnessed such comforts as were displayed in that little chamber, and she could not refrain from tsars. Helen took her hand, and gazing with the greatest compassion in her face, said \u2014 4 Come, come, poor Evelina, you must not weep, for indeed it wrings my very heart to see you do so ; and I'm sure we all wish that it was in our power to do more. But great as is your present misery, God will raise you up again ; and I do not despair of seeing you at some future time comfortable and happp.' 4 Good, kind girl,' ejaculated our heroine ; 4 you have a heart I see alive to every noble and generous sympathy.

The storm had not ceased during the night, and it now raged as fiercely as ever. Evelina shuddered as she heard the snow beating against the chamber window, and reflected how soon she must be exposed to its fury. ' You have slept calmly, Evelina,' said Helen, ' aud I hope you feel yourself refreshed.' 'Yes, Helen,' answered our heroine; 'I do feel better than I did ; it Is many years since I have before known the blessingB of a comfort able bed, and God only knows when I shall lest to night.' ' Do not despair, my poor friend,' said Helen; 1 Providence will yet turn something up for you, and I cannot think that my dear parents will suffer you to leave us for a day or two.' 1 Indeed I cannot infringeupon their kindness any longer, Helen,' returned our heroine; 'they have already done more for me, a poor stranger, than they can afford. Besides, I am fearful if I remain much longer in this neighbourhood, my cruel oppressors will discover me, and what my fate would be if I should again fall into their power, I shudder to think on, If the storm would only abate I might be enabled to reach the town of Elsbury to-day, and then, if I can see Mr. Mild man, I should know my fate at once.' 'Alas !' said the compassionate Helen, ' it Is a long, long way for you to walk without money, without food.' < God will help me, I trust, on my dreary journey/ replied Evelina; 'but let whatever may happen, I shall never cease, while I live, to remember the disinterested and generous kind ness of yourself and your amiable parents with feelings of the most boundless gratitude.' 1 Do not mention it, my poor friend, for I'm sure that my dear parents, as well as myself, only regret that it is not in their power to do more for you, and to release you entirely from the dreadful situation in which you are placed. But, Evelina, I hope you will not be offended at what I am going fo aay/ she added with a peculiar look. ' Offended, Helen ?' ejaculated oui heroine. * Ob, I cojld never be offended with anything that you say or do. What mean you?' Helen unlocked a small box which was stand- Evelina took her proffered hand, and then attended her down stairs into the parlour, where the humble morning repast was already spread upon the table, at which Mrs. Selborn and her other daughters were sealed.

How fortunate It was that my good man beheld you last night, or God knows what would have become of you.' ' Ob, Mrs. Selborn,' said Evelina, with much emotion; ' I owe you and yonr worthy husband a debt of gratitude, which I fear it will never be in my power to pay.' ' Do not talk of obligation, my good girl,' said the dame ; ' I should never have forgiven Robert if he had left you in the pelting storm, to perish of cold and hunger.

Mrs. Selborn gave her an encourlng look, and Helen evinced the pleasure she felt at the humane resolution which her parents had come to, and pressed the hand of Evelina In silence. It was sometime before the poor girl could recover from her emotion, and tben she was pursuaded to partake of 'he breakfast which was spread before her. ing on the table In the loom, and took from it a little chain purse. 4 It is only a small sum which I have saved from the few pence my parents have given me at different times,' said the noble minded girl; 4 would tbat it were pounds.

They could not but a. mire h r great beauty, in spite of the ravages which care and long-suffering had made upon her, and Mrs. Selborn shuddered when she reflected upon the snares which might be set to entrap one so young, inexperienced, and unprotected in the sinful world. The snow storm continued with but little cessation throughout the day, and our heroine could but feel the moBt Hvely sensations of gra titude towards her humble friends who had sheltered her from the weather's inclemency. But still she could not conquer the alarm she felt lest her cruel enemies should trace her to the cottage, and at every knock that came to the door she startled, and hurriedly ran into the adjoining apartment. It was iu vain tbat Helen and her mother tried to banish these apprehen sions from her mind, and to convince her of the improbability ofthe parish authorities seek ing her in such a place ; the dread of once more being consigned to the workhouse had made such a powerful impression upon her, that she could not divest herself of It. 4 Oh, Mr. Selborn,' said Evelena, 4 this is in deed most kind, and never shall I be able to matk my sense of it.' * There now, Evelina,' returned Selborn, ' you confuse me by these demonstrations of gratitude, and I'm sure it's little enough you have got to thaDk me for.' 4 You have saved my life, sir,' answered our heroine, 4 and inspired me with hope, and this from one whom I had never seen before. Alas ! I fear there are but few in the world who are like you and your excellent family.' \u25a0 Why,* said the cottager, ' the world is bad enough, and there is but little sympathy it in with the suffering victims of poverty ; however, I trust that you will not find it so, and that the hand of pity and benevolence may be extended towards you. But see about the supper, dame \u25a0 we will talk further of this to-morrow.* Evening came, and Mr. Selborn returned home from his daily toll, and appeared pleased to seo the poor girl seated by the fire, in the company of his wife and children, and the change for the better that was wrought in her appear ance by the night's rest she had enjoyed. He welcomed ber io his usual honest, hearty manner, and Evelina returned his greeting with a modest fervour which spoke more than words could have done the sincerity and warmth of her gratitude. 4__ 4 But I fear, Mr. Selbarn,' remarked Evelina, 'that my terrible enemies will discover where I am concealed, and force me back to that abode of horror.' Helen had got ber father's warm slippers ready, and placed his arm chair by the fire, and"], [59, "OR, POVERTY, CRIME, AND SORROW. 51 ' Oh, there ia not much fear of that,' replied the .cottager, ' though I certainly did hear to-day that your escape hao ca'tsed considerable excite- ment in the parish, an. that they are resolved ' to leave no means untried to find you out, though it is thought, 'that having no friends in the World, you will be driven by necessity to return to the workhouse.' ' Ah !' ejaculated our heroine ; 'then my danger Is certain.1 that you will never forget that there is such an individual as Robert Selborn in existence.* 'Oh, sir,' ejaculated Evelina, weeding, 'what an ungrateful worthless being I must be, could I ever cease to remember with respect and grati tude thos. whose unbounded kindness I have experienced. I will remember you in my prayers, and invoke blessings upon you and your family. God grant that we may meet again, and that I may be able to make you some return for that which I am indebted to you.* 1 Not so ; of all places in the world, it is not Ikely that they would think of searching for you here ; and if they were to do so, I would tafee good care that they should not find you.' 4 N . t for the world woold I have such a cir cumstance take ylace,for you would get yourself into trouble-' 'Name it not, my girl,' said Selborn ; ' that we may meet again I most sincerely wish, but as for any return for the trifling service I have been enabled to render you, I seek it not, neither do I require it. What I more than all regret is, that we are compelled to part bo 6oon, and that it is not in my power to assiet you further ; but I do trust, Evelina, that you will communicate with us as soon as possible, for depend upon it, short as the time is that we have been acquainted with each other, no individuals can possibly have your interests more at heart than Robert Selborn and his family.' 4 What, for doing an act of charity and huma nity, which they are not capable of?' demanded Selborn. 4 That would be -the very reason tbat they would pursue you with their vengeance,' observed Evelina. 4 Not they,* replied the cottager. ' I defy them. I am not beholden to them for a single fraction, and I trust that Providence, which has hitherto been so kind to me, will always keep me and my fa uii !y independent of them.' * I know it, sir, I feel convinced of it,' ejacu lated Evelina, With much emotion ; 4I must be insensible to every proper seeling of gratitude were I not. Ob, Mr. Selborn, little do I expect to meet with Such kind, such disinterested friends again, a3 you and your amiable family.' 4 Heaven grant that it may,* earnestly ejacu- Uted our heroine, 4for death is preferable to being placed at their raer^y.' , 4 Well, well, my good girl,' said Selborn, 'let. me hope that you will be disappointed irfc hose expectations I am sorry that I cannot accom- pany you to the place of your destination to see all safe ; but I am certain that Mr. Mildman, who is an excellent gentleman, or else he would not have been dismissed from tbe office he held iu the parish of Allover, will receive you with every kindness, and do all he can to assist you in your deplorable situation ; but if he should not be able to do so, as I observed before, do not forget that you have at least friends here, however humble, and heBitate not to return to us again. Something in the interim may turn up by which we might be ahle to assist you.' Again did our \"heroine express her thanks for the warm generosity of the honest cottager ; in- deed, her heart was overflowing, and she had not language to express her sewings ; and to think that she must so soon be separated from such kind friends, with tbe uncertainty when, if ever, they might a\u00a3 ain meet, inflicted a double pang upon her bosom. ' Thornberry will depart at five o'clsck in the morning,' said Mr. Selborn; 'so you will be ready by that time, Evelina. We will not bid you fa1 1 well to-night, for we shall all be up at that hour in the morning ; therefore, my good girl, I would advise you to retire to bed as soon as possible, ao that jou may have a good night's rest to prepare you for the fatigues of the journey.' 4 Bless you, bless you all, for the setvi\u0153a you have rendered to the poor destitute victim of oppression,' ejaculated Evelina, emphatically. ' We shall meet a\u00bbain, Bomething assures me that we shall, and under more cheerful circumstances than at present.' The supper was now ready, and although Evelina was not much inclined to eat, fearing that ahe mig^it offend her generous friends, she was prevailed upon to partake of the frugal meal. The Bopper ended, they, after some further conveys .tinn, separated for the night, and Evelina and Helen once more retired to their chamber. Here Helen gently reproached her unfortunate companion for haying divulged the circumstance of the simple gift she had presented her with ; which was only the means of a renewal of Evelina's expressions of gratitude; they embraced each other with the same affection as ii they had been sisters, instead of almost complete strangers to each other; and having offered up their prayers to Ke^ven; they sought their hermb'e and comfortable couch. The next day was passed in a similar way to the previous one, and Evelina, generally speak- ing, was more tranquil and resigned, although a deep sensation of melancholy regret would at times steal over her mind, when she thought how short was the time that che would be pera milted to remain with the kind cottagers, who had Tendered her such essential service, and whom she mi\u00a3_t never behold again. When Mr. Selborn returned from his labour In the evening, after his usual salutations, he said, addressing himself to our heroine, 4 I have Been neighbour Thornberry to-day, and he very readily complied with my request. He ia a veiy honest, good hearted man, and you may safely depend upon him. But indeed, my poor girl, I feel much regret . t having to part whh jou so soon, and especially under such circumstances ; but I hope that before loug we may meet again, and that your prospects may theu have become changed. I trust, tay child, ' Continue to encourage that idea, my dear child,* said the damer 'and it will give you"], [60, "BVELINA, THE PAUPER'S CHILD; 92 \u25a0Alas! alasl' ejaculated the affectionate girl, ' but a few short minutes, and then we must put, Evelina, perhaps sot ever.' ' Not for ever, dear Helen, I trust,' returned Evelina. \u2022 I trust that something will occur to bring ui together again, and that when we do meet once more, it may be under circumstances of congratulation, instead of sorrow.\" 1 God grant that it may!' laid Helen, vehemently ; ' but, w hen I think of the miserable journey you are ao soon about to commence, the destitute state in which you are, and the uncer tainty of your obtainiog relief when you arrive at your place of destination, it fills my bosom with dread and anguish \u2014 indee d It does.' ' Oh, how kind is this of you to expresa io much commiseration and solicitude for one who Is almost an entire stranger to yon,' said Evelina, deeply affected. strength to but with patience and fortitude any future vicissitudes you may have to undergo. You may depend npon it, that oui thoughts will be frequently devoted to yon, and most happy shall we be to hear of your prosperity. ' \u25a0 I know you will, Mm. Selborn,' returned our heroine, \u25a0 and I hope the time will come when wo shall be able to resumo oui friendship with out fear of interruption .' The eyes of the fair Helen expreised how fervently ihe responded to that wish, and after a few more observations, they separated. But there wai little or no sleep for Evelina that night, so fully was her mind occupied with the thought! of her melancholy Journey, and tha uncertainty of her wishes being crowned with auccesi, on arriving at the place of her destination. And Helen felt almost as ud and wretched ai herself, at tbe Idea of their being about io toon to part, and the uncertainty of their ever meeting again. Short al the time waa that they had been introduced to each other, the distressing situation in whloh Evelina was placed, and the troubles she had undergone, had taken the strongest hold upon the kind-hearted girl's sympathy, and many were the apprehensions she entertained, as to what would in future become of her. It waa dreadful to think that one so young, so lovely, and so strictly virtuous, should thus bo made the victim of a cruel fate, and left destitute and friendless in the wide world ; and Helen pictured to her self what would be her own anguish and despair, should aho ever be placed ln a similar oondltlon. She wondered how Evelina could have found strength to bear up against such accumulated and aitrocioul erueltiei, and the thoughta which the melancholy fate of her unfortunate parents must ever engender in her breast. ' I should despise myself,' answered Helen, 'could I do otherwise than sympathise ln the bitter misfortune! of my fellow-creatures, especi ally of one who, I feel convinced, Is entitled by her virtue! to io different a fate. But you will communicate with us at the earliest opportunity \u2014 will you not, Evelinas Dspend upon It that we shall all of us be In a state ofthe molt piin ful anxiety till we hear from you.' ' I should bo most ungrateful, and unworthy of your good opinion, did I neglect to do so. If you do not hear from me In a few days, you may conclnde the worst \u2014 tbat death hat put a period to my miseries, or \u2014 ' ' Ob, Heaven forbid I' interrupted Helen 'No, no \u2014 you must not despair; the Almighty will surely not forsake you, while you put your trust tu Him. Something will occur to release you from your present destitute eondltion. But hark I I hear my parent! stirring; the time ia rapidly approaching, Evelina; may God watch over and protect you 1' Our heroine could not answer, and the two girl! embraced each other al affectionately ai If they had been listers. So deeply wete the poor girls Immersed in the conversation to which these lad thought! gave rise, that it was some time ere they could make up their mlndi to rest, and many were the pro mises of future friendship that were exchanged betnoen them, If Providence should ordain that they should ever meet again. When sleep did at last close the eyelids of Evelina, the moat pain ful vision! haunted her imagination, and it was a great relief to her when ihe awoke. The little Dutch clock ln tbe parlour of the cottage wai Just atricking tha hour of four, but Evelina did not feel inclined to go to sleep again ; aud as the lamp waa still burning in the chimney corner, ihe arose, and prepared to dress herself, as there was no time to spare, before the hour would arrive when Mr. Thornberry must depart with his waggoa. Ibe storm had abated during the night, and had now entirely ceaaed; but it waa evident, from the appearance of the atmosphere, that it would not bo long ere it recommenced la all its orlglnil violence; and therefore the prospect before the youthful and unfortunate traveller was of the molt cheerless description. She, how ever, encouraged a tee lings of hope, and s neceedod much better than might have been expected. It wai now more than half paat four, and our heroine and Helen, having once more mingled their tears together, descended the stairs, and entered the parlour, where they found Mr. and Mrs. Selborn (they not having thought It pru dent or necessary to disturb the younger chil dren) awaiting them. They advanced kindly toward! Evelina, ant took her hand, and her looka wore quite luffl dont to tell the reeling! of regret they were ex* perienclng at parting with her. Sad wai the heart of our heroine at the thought of parting from those honest, warm-hearted friends, from whom in ao brief a space of time ahe had experienced so many inestimable favours, and ibe wept bitterly, which somewhat relieved her. She then supplicated the Supreme to throw over her the shield of his protection, and invoked his choicest blessings npon the humble and amiable family. ' The moment of separation haa arrived,' laid Mra. Selborn, ' and indeed you may believe me, Evelina, that, although short as tbe time la that we 1 ave been Introduced to each ether, I feel ae much solicitude for your future destiny as if you were my own relation. But keep up your spirits, Helen, who had been asleep when Evelina arose, now awoke, and seeing that ihe wal up and dressed, she started from tbe bed with much agitation, and inquired the time. Our heroine Informed her."], [61, "OR, POVERTY, CRIME, AND SORROW. 53 my good girl, and let us hope that your worst troubles are past, and that Heaven has many yean of happiness in store for you.

Farewell, Evelina t and I hope that wo may shortly meet again/ As he thus spoke, he thrust a few pieces of silver into her hand ; and, before she could say a word, he hurried from the spot, and was almost immediately ont of sight. This simple speech, so tenderly and so ear nestly given, affected Evelina to tears, and she \u2022ould only kneel at the good old dame's feet and give expression to her feelings of gratitude by hot looks. Mrs. Selborn raised and embraced her, and the parting soene was as affecting as if the poor girl had been associated with them from tbe earliest daya of childhood, ' The separation must take place/ said Mr. Sei - born ; ' but let na hope that it wl'1 not be for long. It nowonly wants a few minutes to li \u2022 _ o'clock, and Thornberry cannot delay. I will accompany you to him, Evelina.' Evelina was scarcely conscious what she did, and Mr. Thornberry having assisted her into tho waggon, she sunk down in a corner amongst some bay and horse rugs, and gave herself up entirely to the dismal thoughts which were kln d ed in her bosom, both at her parting with those worthy individuals who had behaved so kindly to her, and at the uncertainty of the fato which was yet in store for her. The waggon now proceeded on Its way, toiling through the snow, which in some places seemed likely to obstruct its progress altogether ; the wind also blew piero ngiy keen, but for some time, nothing could arouse Erelina from the deep lethargy into which she had fallen. Evelina and Helen once mon embraced, and mingled their tears and sobs together. 'God blest you all!' vehemently ejaculated ear heroine, ' for your unexampled kindness to tbe wretched pauper girl. Farewell, farewell, piay Heaven, not for over/ Io this manner, two hours or more elapsed without anything particular occurring. Tbe daylight now dawned, but only to render more apparent the dreariness of the scene, and im-* parted a deadly chill to the heart of Evelina. The storm, too, again commenced, and added to the general misery, and Evelina sunk back In the waggon jn a state of mind bordering upon absolute despair. At length they arrived at a small road-si . e house, where Mr. Thornberry stopped, and invited Evelina into the house to partake of some breakfast. She would have deel ned, bat Thornberry would not hear her; and she, therefore, suffered him to assist her to alight from the waggon, and they entered a room where a cheerful fire waa blazing In the grate, and seemed to invite the weary worn traveller from tbe inclemency of tbe weather. Here Thornberry quickly ordered breakfast, which was promptly placed before them, and, notwith standing tho agitation of ber mind, E . elina waa prevailed upon to partake of it. This meal over, Evelina took tbe pnrse from her bosom, which Helen bad given ber, and wan about to pay for what she had eaten, but Thorn berry would not permit her, and begged her to make her mind quite easy upon that point, as be could not think of suffering a poor girl, wbe> could so ill afford It, to pay for anything while she was in his company. Our heroine returned her thanks as well as her emotion would permit her, and was then reconducted by Thorobeiry She took tbe hand of Mr. Selborn as she spoke, and Helen and her mother, who were both moved to tears, followed them to tbe door, and watched them anxiously as they traced their wa. through tbe snow towards tbe dwelling of Mr. Thornberry ; and when they were bidden from their view, they re-entered the parlour, and sinking on their knees, earnestly prayed to Heaven for the future safety and prosperity of tho hapless object of their solicitude. Bat little conversation passed between Evelina and Mr. Selborn as they proceeded on their way, for ber heart wai tro full to allow her to speak. The air waa piercing cold, but our heroine's mind was too much engaged with painful thoughts to suffer ber to need it much ; and at last they arrived at the residence of Thornberry, and be held tbe waggon waiting at the door. Ola Thornberry, who waa a hearty, good tempozed-looklng man, received tbe poor girl with mneb kindness j and seemed deeply to pity ber Situation. 4 1 wish I war a goin' all the way/ he said ; * bat from Ecclestown to Elsbury, it be little more than two miles and a half, and perhaps after a long rest in the waggon, the poor girl may be able to manage that/ * Oh, tbank yon, sir\u2014 I shall ever most grate fully remember your kindness/ said Evelina. * Nay, do not say anything about tbat, lass/ aald Thornberry ; ' my friend Selborn here has told me all about your distressed situation, and I am way glad that I be able to accommodate yon so far. But let me assist you Into the wag gon ; you will find a snug corner whicb I have prepsred for you there, and where you may be enabled to keep yourself warm. I mnst be moving directly, for tbe roads be in sucb a bad \u25a0late that it will take me much longer to do the Journey this time than usual.' to the waggon, and the journey vas resumed. The mind of our heroine gradually became more calm, and she resigned herself to the will of heaven ; but still, many were the melancholy thoughts of regret which she beatowed upoa that excellent family from whicb she bad expe rienced such essential service. Tbe storm increased as the morning advanced and tbe waggon could only proceed at a very tedious pace on its way, but to Evelina It mat tered not ; ber mind was too deeply engaged to Evelina turned to Mr. Selborn, and her heart was full to bursting. She tried to speak, bat could not. Mr. Selborn took her hand, and he"], [62, "EVELINA, THE PAUPER'S CHILD; 54 know anything about me, or whither I am gone for sooner would I meet death than fall again into the hands of my merciless enemies/ 4 Oh, yon may depend upon me, my poor girl,' replied Thornberry ; * Heaven forbid tbat I should 6ay or do anything to bring any poor creature into trouble. But do you, indeed, persist in going to Eisburythls afternoon, when you see how fuiiouBly the storm still rages?' 4 1 cannot come to the resolution to defer my journey, sir,' answered our heroine ; 'therefore the sooner I depart the better, so that I may reach there before the darkness of the night sets in, Will you please to dir e ot me tbe right way V notice the lapse of time, and she was completely sheltered from the inclemency of the weather in the place which Mr. Thornberry had prepared for her in the waggon. It was three o'clock in the afternoon before they reached Eccleston, where the journey of Mr. Thornberry terminated, and now Evelina had to pursue the remainder ot the way alone aud on foot. But Thomberry persuaded her to enter the inn at which they stopped, and take some refreshment, and again stopped her when she would have expressed to him her thanks for this ki-dness. 4 It is a terrible day/ he observed, ' and it is more than two miles and & half from this place to Elsbury, and you will be completely lost in goiDg there. I cannot accompany you, or I am sure I would most willingly ; and I am afraid that every one is ao buiy at the inn, that J could not get a man to conduct you there lor l-.ve or money. But if you will take my advice, you will remain here for to-night, and I have no doubt that I can procure you a comfortable lodg iog. By the morning the weather may have changed, and then you may proceed to Elsbury without so much difficulty. ' I thank you for your kind offer, sir/ replied Evelina, ' but I am so impatient to know at once my fate, that I cannot think of delaying my journey. The distance is but Bhort, and I shall soon be there, and I shall not take mnch harm from the storm : alas ! it perhaps may be neces sary for me to inure myself to such trials as this, for Heaven knows how many more severer ones I may have to encounter.* 44 I will point out to you the way/ said Thorn berry, 4 aince you are determined ; but the snow ls 30 thick upon the ground, that I fear you will never be able to keep to the right path.' Evelina drew the little cloak, with which Mra. Selborn had supplied her, closer around her, and her heart palpitating with wing'ed hopes and fears, she attended Mr. Thornberry to the doer of the inn. Tbe scene which presented itself without was enough to daunt the stoutest spirit, and Mr. Thornberry again tried to persuade her to return ; but she remained resolute, notwith standing ail the dangers which presented them selves, and he therefore pointed out to her the direction in which Bhe was to go, and bidding her adieu, ahe departed from the inn, Mr. Thornbeiry standing watching her with anxiety and compassion as she proceeded on her way. With the utmost difficulty did Evelina regain her way through the deep Bnow, which entirely concealed every sign of a path or road from ob seivation, while the wind blew so keenly, aud the snow pattered againtt her bo violently, that she could scarcely keep her feet. She lelt dread fully cold, and now regretted that she bad not taken the advice of Mr. Thornberry, and was half inclined more than once or twice to return to the inn, and remain there till the morning. \u2014 It certainly was foolish obstinacy on her part to persist in venturiHg on to Elsbury in such a storm, when, as Mr. Thornbeiry had observed, a few hours' delay could not have made much dif ference; butit was a remarkable impulse that had urged her on, and she could not resist it. 4 My poor girl/ said Thornberry, 'yon little know tbe danger of travelling even a short dis\" tance in the state the roads are at present. You bad better let me persuade you ; a few hours surely cannot make much difference, and in the morning I may be able to accompany you, and eee you safe to Elsbury.' 1 1 do not know howit is/ieturned our heroine, ' but something seems to prompt me to perse vere in accomplishing my journey this afternoon, and I cannot resist the impulse, although most deeply obliged to you do I feel for yonr good intentions. See, the snow does not fall so .heavily now, and tbe wind has abited : I will at once depar, if you will direct me which way to go/ * Indeed It is very foolish and headstrong ot you, child/ said the waggoner. ' But I see that His useless to endeavour to prevail upon you, and therefore I will say no more upon the sub ject. God bless you ; may you arrive safe at EU bury, and slud your hopes realised. This is what I sincerely wish.' ' And may God prosper you and your family, \u25a0sir,' eaul Evelina, ' for what you have done for me. Pray, give my best regards to Mr. and Mrs. Selboro aud their family, on your return .home, and assure them that the poor girl they have so greatly b' friended, will not neglect to write to them, and inform them what has become of her, tbe first rroment that au opportunity shall present itself.' 'I will do bo/ said Thor nberry. ' And/ added Evelina, ' I am sure, sir, tbat I seed not request you to keep it a secret tnat you She now stood still for a moment, and looked \\>ack; although she had not beeD able to proceed but slowly, ahe had already lost sight of the inn, and as far as her eyes could stretch through the falling snow, she could not perceive a single individual. Tht. only guides that she had were the different trees which Thornberry had pointed out to her, and she began to fear that she should have some difficulty in finding out the place of her destination. But again she resumed ter miserable journey, and her apprehensions In creased. Her limbs, however, Were so benumbed will, the intense cold, that it needed the exertion of all her strength, and that was little enough, to enable her to move at *_U. To add to her misery and alarm, darkness began to set in, and she could Hot jet see any signs of human habitation or any person who might direct her on her way. And now more bitterly than ever did she regret that she had not been persuaded by Mr. Tb.wTKl.erry to remain"], [63, "~ \" ~_fii_______\u00bb\u2122- ~ _\u25a0\u25a0-\u00bb*-___\u25a0 OR, POVERTY, CRIME, AND SORROW. 55 at the inn ; for what was to become' of her should she be lost and bewildered in that Btrangt place f She could never reach the residence of Mr. Mild man, and she must perish from the effects of the frost, which was more severe than even the stoutest constitution could well endure. She Btrained her eyes with frantic eagerness, to endeavour to see whether there was the least shadow of hope before her, but for some moments not the least ray beamed upon her misery.\u2014 Suddenly, however, she uttered a frantic scream of joy, when Bhe beheld a light glimmering as if from a window at a distance from her. Again ahe paused, not knowing what to do, and while she invoked the Interposition of Hea ven, abe wrung har hands in inexpressible agony and wept bitterly. To attempt to return to the inn, would be as bad as to proceed, and she became completely distracted with the horrors of her situation. But it was useless to stand inactive, and again she proceeded, leaving it alone to Providence to guide her footsteps iu the right way. 4 Heaven be praised !' she cried ; 'I am ap proaching some human dwelling, unless that light deceives me. Oh, give me strength to reach it.' Once more she resumed her course, taking the direction of the light as near as she could calcu. late ; but after glimmering for a few minutes, it disappeared, and Evelina was again left in doubt and fear, aud every instant her strength was failing her more and more ; but still she urged herself on her way. The darkness now deepened ; there was not a star to be seen in the heavens to light her on her way, and the falling snow, and thickly covered ground, which appeared like one immense wind ing sheet, were all that the wretched wanderer could perceive. Her limbs were so stiff that she could scarcely put them into action at all, aud the anguish and terror of her mind nearly des troyed her energies. And now the light again appeared more dis tinct thau before, and Evelina felt certain that she was proceeding in the right direction; but still her limbs were so exhausted and benumbed, that ahe feared Bhe should never be able to reach it. Her head became giddy, and it was with _is_- culty she could preserve herself from falling. Another ten minutes, the most dreadful that Evelina even amidst all her Bufferings had ever experienced, and t_en the dark shadow of a building met her gaze, from the window of which she perceive .i that the light proceeded. It was not many yards from her, and the poor girl determined to make bold to apply there, think- ing it was impossible the inmates could refuse her pity and shelter in her deplorable situation ; but close as she was to it, she felt so completely worn out, that she feared it would be impossible for her to reach it. Her limbs shook ae._Ssho were afflicted with the palsy, and har- brain reeled, and rendered her almost une c__ciou3 of what she was doing ; bat still with a desperation which nothing but despair could have created, she struggled on, and arrived at the gloomy building. She made an effort to reach the porch, but her limbs tottered beneath her j a death-like faiutneBs came over her ; all her energies seemed to be at once paralysed, and uttering one piercing shriek of agony aud despair, she Bank upon the earth. 4 My God!' Bhe exclaimed, 'I am lost I I cannot proceed much farther, but must sink down and perish. Foolish, obstinate girl tbat I was, not to take the advice of Mr. Thornberry ; and in the morning, guided by him, I should have been certain to have reached the place of my destination ia Bafety. AU merciful Father, do not thus abandon thy wretched creature.' : At that moment the solemn tones ot a distant church bell emote her ear: it revived her hopes, and once more Bhe forced her way through the snow, in the direction from whence the sounds had pro ceeded. Full half an hour had elapsed in this manner, and still the poor girl saw nothing to banish her terror or to inspire her with hope, although she thought that, from the distinctness with which she bad heard ths church bell, she could not be far from some town or village. From the time that she had quitted the Inn, notwithstanding the slowness with which she had been compelled to proceed, she felt confident that she had travelled full two miles and a half, and unless she had wandered out of her way, which, alas ! was far too probable, she could not be any great distance from Elsbury.

But to die a death like that was too horrible to tbink upon, and agaiu she roused all her ener gies, and made her shivering limbs perform their unwilling task ; but ever and anon she wascomi pelled to pause to rest herself, aud then she was in danger of being paralysed and frozen to the ground. Several times she shrieked aloud for help, but, alas ! no help was at hand. In her dreadful emergency, the only answer she received was In the voice os' the howling wind, which came with such terrific gusts at intervals, that it nearly drove her off her feet.

Sue a were the harrowing particulars that Eve lina detailed to Mr. Langston, while seated by his side two days after her introduction to tho hall. Need we say with what horror, disgust, indignation, and bitter self-reproach did he listen to the melancholy narratives Frequently he in terrupted his lovely relative, to give veot to his emotioB, and the looks he fixed upon her suffi ciently told the agony be waa enduring. 4 Tbe Almighty has forsaken me 1' she sobbed; ' it is useless for me to contend against my fate.' But what a change had that short period of time wrought in the appearance of our heroine ;"], [64, "EVELINA, THE PAUPER'S CHILD. 56 A pause of tome momenta ensued, for both Langston and his lovely niece were too much overcome by the vehemence of their vailed emotion!, (o infler them at flnt to give ezpresiloa to their feeling! ln words. 'But tbe vlllsln M Doall and hi* inhuman wife shall pay dearly for their cruelty toward! you and others, Evelina,' at last exclaimed Langton. \u2022 They little auapect what has taken place, or Into whose hands you have fallen ; and no time will I delay in bringing them to Justice; I have tha mean! ; proofs of their guilt cannot ha wanting, *nd by Heaven I will not teit aatisfied until I bave obtained ample redren, and exposed the atrocities that have been for so many years perpetrated with impunity to the unsus pecting world.' \u2022 My dear, sir,' remarked the gentle and for. giving Evelina, 'doubtless they will be suffi ciently punished at some future period, by the uphraldlngs of their own consciences, and ' ' No, no, my love,' Interrupted her aged rsla. tlve ; ' the wretohei must not, shall not be per mitted, thui to escape. Justice demands that their inhuman acts should be laid bare to the public scorn and Indignation ; and the unfortu nate creatures whom poverty has placed in their power should be released from their cruelty and oppression. If I am permitted to do this, if Providence will allow me to achieve this object, oh, what a consolation will it afford 10 my mlud. I will but await a few days to mature my plans, and then with energy and determination will I set about my task. But, in the meaatlm . th. so honest, those kind-hearted people who so gener ously and disinterestedly assisted you, Eveliaa, in the terrible hour of need, when but for them you must have perished ; they must not be for gotten. Oh, how greatly are we indebted to them, my dear child; what a noble txai.'e have they set to their wealthy fellow -creatures, who but too often turn a deaf ear t. the pathetic appeal of helpless poverty !' At the recollection of Mr. Selborn and his family, tears came to the eyes of our heroine ; and fervently did ihe invoke blessings upon their heads. no one could have believed that It was the lame wretched creature who had so recently escaped from the brutalities of the parish workhouse, starving and nearly dead from the Inhuman treatment which she had received. Her countenance waa now mild and serene, the glow of returning health might be leen upon her eheeks, and her eyes sparkled with an anima tion wbich had not imparted its fire to them for tsany a day. She was ncat'y, if not elegantly, attired, and the graces of her person were dis played to the utmost advantage, although with. out vanity or ostentation. When she beheld the agony of her venerable i.latlve, whose heart wal at last moved to all Ihoae generous feelioga which ennoble humanity, she beamed upon him one of the sweeteit imilei of encouragement, and which mult have been sufficient to convince him, that she sincerely for gave the past, that she wal anxloui to bury it ln obii ion, tbat ihe wished to see him happy, and that he was preoared to live with him as friendly as li he had always behaved with the greatest kind, en to her parents and herself. But Lang \u2022ton could not so easily forgive himself, however determined he was by his future conduct to make ail the atonement in his power, when he thought of the horrors he might have been the means of preventing; and it would be lome time, he felt cerlain, before he should be able to briDg his mind to anything like a degree of tranquillity. 'Good God I Gaod God,' ho exclaimed, when our heroine had come to the conclusion of her melancholy recital, ' and is it possible that there can be such monsters in the world as to Indict such atrocities upon one so young, so help less, and so innocent J And I, wretch that I am, have been the cauBe of all this. Yes, I had wealth iu abundance, and might have snatched you and your ill-fated parents from misery, and then should hive gained my brightest reward in scenting their regard, and in the approval of my own conscience. Oh, Evelina, deeply injured, persecuted child, look not ao affec tionately upon me, for I deserve it not ; you should rather view me with horror and loathing. Oh, you can never, never forgive me for my cruel neglect of yen ; I can ever forgive myself.' \u2022 My dear sir,' returned Evelina, ln the sweetest loses, which told the sincerity of her feelings, 'for the love of Heaven do not tortore yourself thus. Oh, indeed I do forgive you, and am prepared to love you, to look up to you as my dearest rela tive, my only friend. Come, uncle, if yon would sea me happy, you will banish these feelings of remorse wbich prey too heavily upon your mind, and look forward to the suture with the lame bright hopei that I am prepared to do.' ' Yes,' ihe ejaculated ; ' had it cot been for those amiable p.ople, I must have died on the awful night when I escaped from the workhouse. To them alone an I indebted for my preservation and roy restoration to you, sir; and never can I look upon them with any otber feelings than those of the moit unlimited gratitude, until my heart ihall cease to beat. Dear Helen, how delightful shall I be, when I am permitted to behold you once again. But, with your per mission, sir, I will immediately write to them, for I am certain that they will be molt anxious to know what has become of the object of their solicitude.' 'Sweet girl I' cried the old man, embracing her; 'oh, it is balm to ihe lacerated soul to listen to your voice ; and yet, blind, sordid fool tbat I have been hitherto to deprive myself of sueh a blessing in my declining days. Yes, sweet innocent, you bid me hope, and I will endeavour to do so ; you shall he my guiding an gel; and whenever my heart feels oppressed, your gentle soothlngs sha'.l restore It to peace. Almighty Father, I thank thee for the mercy thou hast extended towards me.' ' Do, my dearest Evelina,' laid Langston ; ' and X request that you will convey to them my warmest acknowledgments for their unexampl d kindness ; informing them that I will communi cate furthor with them at the ear.lest opportu nity. At the same time, request teem to accept of this trifle al tome little assurance of my gratitu.e ; and this to Mr. Thornberry, to whom we are also much Indebted.

She had suddenly stepped in between tha darling hopes which she and Stephen Blackthorn had so long encouraged ; and unless something was promptly done, she would be the means of frustrating all their deep-laid schemes. As Mr. Langston thus spoke, he placed a fifty pound note in the hand of Evelina for Mr. Sel born, and ten pounds for Thornberry. Her heart overflowed at his generosity, and she could only press the hand of her venerable relative to her lips in silent gratitnde, and then, with his permission, retired to another room in order to write the communication to those humble but amiable individuals who had been her only friends in the most trying hours of adversity. When she heard that Evelina was about to leave the presence of Langston, she hurried with noiseless steps to her own room, where she gave the most unrestrained indulgence to her excited feelings. Mrs. Snacks had been listening attentively at the door of the apartment during the time this scene had taken plaee, and the rage, disappoint ment, and alarm which the feelings of that evil- PUMPING ON M'DOALL.

' But wi 1 you not furnish me with your ad dress, so that I may communicate with you, if necessary ?' a*knd the master.

But you .will not forget what I have said to you, and you shall find that I will not fait in my promise to reward you handsomely for your trouble.' 1 I will pay every attention to your instrnc tions, Norton,' returned M'Doall, ' and I only wish that I had the girl at present In my power.' 'Why, perhaps, it would be as well,' said Stephen; ' however, good day, old fellow. I will call upon you again in a short time.' ' Good day, Norton Cranfield,' (which was the only name he knew him by) said M'Doall, and showing him to the door, Blackthorn mounted bis horse, and immediately Btarted off at full Speed to rejoin his friends. He waB so much agitated that it was some time before he was in a humour to rejoin hls wild and diislpated companions, and even then be entered Into their usual scenes of folly with very little of his accustomed vivacity. His in clination wonld have prompted him to return borne without delay, but upon mature reflection, he thought it was better not to do bo, and he therefore despatched an answer to Mrs. Snacks, expressing that opinion, and desiring her to for* ward him all tbe particulars that occurred, and ia the meantime he would endeavour to devise some means to forward their plans. Tbe escape of Evelina was not, after all, altogether satisfactory to him, although he could not see how it was possible tbat she could Io ag survive in such a cold and dreary season, aud friendless and destitute as she was ; but still he would have been more contented if she had still been an inmate of tbe workhouse, for be felt convinced, since his interview with M'Doall, that her fate would then be certain, and that he should have little more to apprehend from her; but after all he considered that he was pretty secure, and that there would be no further ob stacle to obstruct him in the gratification of hi* avaricious wi-hes. But he must pity his cards nicely with old LangBton, for should he offend him it womd be all over. As has been before intimated, the escape of our heroine had caused tbe most extraordinary exl emeut in he w rkhouBe of Allover, especially among tbe paupers, who all of them envied her ber good fortune, as they considered It, for even death was far more to he coveted than tbe linger ing and dreadful Bufferings to which they were subjected. When M'Doall and his wife were made acquainted with it, they could scarcely believe it, and caused a strict search to be made in every part of the bn'lding ; but wheu tho truth became apparent, and the poor girl could no where tie found, their ng\u00ab exoe. _o_ ill Two days after Blackthorn's arrival in Lon don he received tbe letter from Mrs. Snacks, and on opening It, and perusing its contents, we need not try to describe tbe astonishment, rage, and disappointment that Ailed hit breast.

He accused them all of conniving at th. escape of Evelina, and if any of them ventured the least word ln reply, is was punished by a blow, or confinement in the ' black hole . and wheu M'Doall's back wai turned, sullen murmura and threats arose from the poor suffering creatures, which if he had heard, he would probably hav. been seriously alarmed. But the next day was to prove the prelude to the downfall of th. MDoalli la th. workhouse of Allover. kou_.li. Mrs. M'Doall was too 111 to loav. her bid, bat ibe gave vest to her wrath la the most eouie .ad violent language, while her husband, who had not long before returned home drunk from th. Hog aud Punch Bowl, relieved himself \u25a0 little of hil indignation, by seizing s horse wlp and flogging th. unhappy female paup.rs who had been lu the same shed with Evelina, all round. Th. parish beadle aud other dignitaries were apprised of the circumstance without delay, and a strict search after the fugitive was instituted over th. town ; but without the least clue being gained to her discovery. Mr. and Mrs. M'Doall passed a sleepless night, for all sorts of apprehensions haunted their minds. Should Evelina fall into the hands of auy bene volent individual, what an exposure of their cruel practices would take place ; and how could they Itand against the weight of tho public odium and indignation that would bo heaped upon them, .specially when their guilt could be corroborated by so many t They trembled at th. thought, and scsreely knew how to act. And now, as is generally the case with most accomplices in crime, they each accused the other of being the anchor ofthe inhumanities which they so much dreaded being brought to light, and tried to make their own conduct ap pear as most Irreproachable ; and this only served to increase the bitterness of their feelings. They thought that Evelina must have some person to go to, Irom whom she expected relief and protection, or she would never have ventured (horrib e even as her treatment was in the work boose) to expose herself to the terrors and almost certain coniequencei of such a night ai that was on wbioh she had escaped ; and that idea in creased their fears. The master had been walking in the yard for aome time, brooding over the disasters of the last few days, when observing a poor little de licate child in the oakum shed, whom the ruffian thought was neglecting her work, he rushed into the place, and seising her by the hair of her head, he dragged her forth, and struck her se veral brutal blows, which earned the blood to flow lu torrents. Ihe screams of the helpless victim rent the air, but still he continued beating her in a most unmerciful manner ; and a scene of confusion followed, which might well baffle description. The cries of the poor child brought several men aud women, who were at work in tbe adjoining sheds, to the spot, and worked up to a pitch of desperation by their own HMreament, and the present atrocious outrage, they surrounded the s ivage with the most menacing gestures, and for au inttant h. felt somewhat alarmed. 1 Daring wretches,' he furiously exclaimed, ' get back to your sheds, or I will have you all confined iu the black hole I' Their rage and disappointment were increased after the visit of Stephen Blackthorn to the work bouse ; for M'Doall now perceived that he had not only Involved himself ln danger, but that he had probably lost a rich reward from Blackthorn, who seemed so anxious about the fate of Evelina. In vain he racked his mind to endeavour to form a conjecture as to the reason Stephen should feel such an extraordinary interest in the future se. curlty of the pauper girl ; he had never known him under any other name than that of Norton Cranfield, was unacquainted with any of his con. neotions, or tho particulars of hls early or subse. quant life, and consequently was lost in per. plexity the more he reflected upon it. The transactions which he and Blackthorn had been engaged in, as may be imagined, were not of the most honourable description ; and there were oertaln circumstances in which they had been connected with one another, that, If they had been discovered, would have perilled their liberty lf not their lives ; bnt they were both so deeply implicated, that they entertained not tbe least fesr of either betraying the other. ' You ate a cruel monster,' said one of the sturdiest of the paupers ; ' and we can endure this no longer. We are no criminals, and there fore why should we be tretted worse V ' D d scoundrel,' said M'Doall, half choaked with rage, and advancing towards the man ; ' I will teaeh yon to talk to me thus I' However, he had no sooner given utterance to the words than he was felled to the earth, and the poor half-Btarved wretches set up a frightful yell of execration and triumph, and Immediately his arms and legs were secured with cords. The terrified master now struggled violently and called aloud for help and mercy, but they heeded him not, but dragged him along the ground and placing him under the pump, two or three or tbem worked with such right good will that tho unhappy devil was soon half. drowned with a complete deluge of water, and presented a spectacle of the most ludiorous des. crlption. ' Murder 1 murder! Helpl help!\" cried the wretched M'Doall, whenever he could breathe to do so, but the more he bawled the harder they pumped, while the shouts and the yells, and the laughter was truly terrific. The house-beadle made Us appearance at the scene of the riot, but observing what was going on, he made a precipitate retreat, probably Two days more elapsed, and not the least In telligence could be obtained ol the fugltiie, and Mr. M'Doall and his wife gave it np ln despair.

Under all these circumstances, it was not likely that the unfortunate master could feel very comfortable. ' Facts are stubborn things/ and Mr. M Doall now in imagination saw an arry of evidence adduced against him which ho apprehended he should never be able to rebut. In fact, there was sufficient proof of the inhuman conduct of himself and his wife lathe pale, care- worn faces of the wretched beings placed in their care; and in their miserable and emaciated forms, gaunt starvation might be seen, which ! ever way the eye turned in that receptacle of misery; and M'Doall and his worthy partner trembled for the consequences that were likely to result from an investigation. Willingly would they have compromised ttrs disagreeable affair with the paupers, and M'Doall would have even endeavoured to forget the pump ; but there was no possibility of doing so. It had gone too far, and must take its chance. But they felt that their long cateer of guilt was drawing to a close, and that they must endeavour to hide their diminished heads, for public indig- nation would be certain to be aroused against them, and they would nor be safe an hoar, if they remained where they were known. Having at length satisfied themselves with pumping on tbe unhappy M'Doall, they took from one of hie pockets the key ofthe,' black hole,' and having unlocked the door, gave liberty to the poor creatures who were confined there, and then bundling ln the half-drowned master, they turned the key upon him, ln spite of his frantio cries for help and mercy. Having accomplished thus much, the pauper rioters would probably have proceeded to pay the matron a visit, previous to their leaving the house, but at that moment, the beadle, who had I hastened to the nearest magistrate, returned with several coostables, well armed, and after a \u2022hort, but desperate struggle, the riot was quelled, the aggressors were secured, an I placed In the 1 black hole/ aud M'Doall was released, more dead than alive, and presenting altogether a most deplorable appearance. It would be impossible to do adequate justice to tbe shame aud indigaation or Mr. M'Doall, when he was a little recovered, at the treatment he had received. What! revolt against the master of a parish workhouse 1 it was nothing less than high treason, and the wretches who oould perpetrate such a monstrous outrage deserved to be hanged, drawn, and quartered, at least. Such waa the opinion of M'Doall, and his amiable spouse, at any rate ; and no doubt they were right. But amidst all these reflections. It became disagreeably apparent to them tbat To add to the utter despair of M'Doall and his wife, one ofthe overseers called upon tbsm, and produced a letter which he had just received. It was from Mr. Langs tot, informing him that Evelina Marsden was fortunately under his pro tection. He accused M'Doall and his wife ol the most wanton barbarity to the poor girl) aud ex pressed his determination of immediately ge.lt n? redress, and of expressing the unexampled cruelties of the master and matron to the pub lic. M Doall and his wife were perfectly as tounded at this unexpected Information, and plainly saw that theymuRt meet with coademna tlon, for the evidence that would be brought for ward against them would be more than they cou'd combat; but they strongly protested their inno cence, and declared that It was a conspiracy got up against them to ruin them inypublic opinion. the house had already become too hot to hold them, and they feared that the examination of the offenders would elicit some facts which would not redound to their credit, and would by no means add to the felicity of their present situation. They would have been very well satisfied to have swallowed their resentment, notwithstanding Mr. M Doall remarked, that ' the pump stuck in his throat/ rather than that the casa should have to go before the magistrates ; but that could not be, and they felt themselves In a very awkward dilemma indeed. Already in perspective they beheld themselves ejected from the snug little picking of Allover, aad thrown upon the wide world, with M'Doall _ one and a penny-halfpenny a day (for he had formerly been a soldier, and no deubt had been selected as master of the workhouse in consequence of his knowledge of discipline, which It seems Is as necessaiy among paupers, who have a stomach beyond skilly, as soldiers), and although they had taken good care, ln their official prosperity, to lay by a pretty handsome sum ' for a rainy day/ the thought of bsing sent forth in disgrace from that establishment, which might yet produce them a small Goloonda of wealth, drove tbem almost to a state of fren_y. Aad all these calamities to he caused by one little miserable pauper, whose life he considered of no more value than one of the mites which, itself in a state of pauperism, might creep into the black and filthy stuff called cheese, that was at certain perio _8 doled out to the poor starving creatures 1 The idea was monstrous ; he could not at all reconcile It to his thoughts.

It was while they were ln this u_._vU._i state of fear, that Mr. M'Doall made a prepmal to his wife. Everything, he said, combined against tbem.

Lord Vernon Sidley was a libertine at heart, and he could not submit to suffer any restraint in the gratification of his passion, and many were the unfortunate aamsels who had to date their ruin from his artifices. Fearful were the shame and misery he had brought into many a once happy family ; and, although he was now what might be considered an old man, his evil propen sities were as strong as ever. tain not to find any sr.ends,and their condemnation Would be Bure to follow. He therefore proposed tbat they should content themselves with what they had already made by their nefarious tran sactions, and secretly make their exit from that place which now had become too hot to hold them. Mrs. M'Doall could not but view the necessity of Buch a course with extreme regret ; but she could not deny its policy, and therefore imme diately set about packing up such articles as were portable, and many a bitter sigh did it cost her while she waa so engaged. What would now become of them . Never could they find again such a home as Allover ; and tbey must in future bury themselves in obscurity, for they well know what the consequences would be, should they become known. They would be scouted from all society. There was nothing left for them but to assume fictitious names, and to go to some part of tbe country where they were not like'y to be recognised, Westbourne Sidley, his son, was now about twenty years of age, and was as opposite to his father in disposition as could well be imagined. Every noble and generous sentiment found a place in his bosom, and he was universally esteemed by all who had the honour of his ac quaintance. What his father wanted in charity and urbanity was amply made up by him, and the affectionate attentions he paid to his afflicted mother afforded her the most precious consolation under the neglect of her husband. That night when all the Inmates of the work house had retired to rest, and there was no one to watch their proceedings, Mr. and Mrs. M'Do all took their departure, and bade adieu to the parish of Allover for ever. The personal attractions of Westbourne Sidley were equal to his intrinsic qualifications, which rendered him a universal favourite wherever he went. Lord Sidley had always viewed old Paul Lang ston with feelings of jealousy, knowing that he was the relation of the -ate M>. Marsden; and certainly there waB no love lost between tbem, for Luifcston could not bnt view him only In the character of the usurper of the rights of another ; and he had some strong suspicions that the will, wbich bad been purported to have been made by the late Mr. Marsden, was a forgery ; for he could not believe tbat the old gentleman could have been so cruel as to carry his animosity against his Bon to the grave. CHAPTER XII. CHARRIKGTON ABBP.T. \u2014 THE RETURN 07 STE- PHEN BLACKTHORN.\u2014 A PLOT. CHARRit-GTON Abbet, the estate of Lord Vernon Sidley, who is destined to play rather a prominent part in these pages, was a truly mag nificent structure, and could not fail to excite universal admiration in the minds of all who beheld it. It was a very aneient building, and hae formerly been in the possession of Mr. Mars den, the grandfather of our heroine, but who, on the marriage of his son against his consent, im mediattly discarded him, and made a will in favour of Lord Veinon Sidley, to whom he was very distantly rela ed, and bequeathed to him the whole of bis estates, and all his other pro perty. Shortly a'terwards tbe old gentleman died, but he carried his implacability to the tomb, and left his unfortunate sou to misery and Want. It must have been a hard trial for Richard Man-den, who had been brought up in the lap of affluence, and was now compelled to get his livmg by tbe sweat of his brow, to see another enjoying that property which should have be longed to him. But he bore it all with tha most exemplary fortitude, happy in the love of an amiable woman, which, in his estimation, was far more valuable than wealth. Lord Vernon Sidley was married at the time that fortune thus smiled upon him, and had only one child, a son, about four years old, of whom he was doatingly fond, although he treated his mother frith the coldest neglect \u2014 interest, and not affection, having tempted him to make her his wi e. At tbe time to which wenow refer, Lady Sidley had been confined to ber bed for several years ; ud bei lord eoLiideud fees tn inaum brace* that Lord Sidley had condescended to make acorn- J ponion of Stephen Blackthorn ; for in disposition and propensities he Just suited him, and he had frequently lent him valuable aid in the prosecution of his licentious stratagems, and he knew he was a man on whom he could depend. When his lordship heard of tbe extraordinary arrival of Evelina Ma eoen at tbe house of Lang* \u25a0ton. his astonishment and emotion may be readily conceived ; and he could not help feeling a certain pang of conscience when he leflected that be was now luxuriating in that wealth which should have belonged to her unfortunate father, who he could not help imagining had been most unjustly punished. He also felt the greatest curiosity to behold Evelina (for he had been in formed that she was very beautiful), and he was determined to do eo at the first opportunity. Having given this necessary description of Lord Vernon Sidley, we will bow return to that patt of our narrative from which we have thus shortly digressed. The flight of Mr. and Mrs. M'Doall caused a considerable sensation at Allover, and a letter was Immediately forwarded to Mr. Langston, making him acquainted with the circumstance. \u2022The wretches/ said Mr. Langston; 'tsielr being unable to meet the investigation into their conduct is a plain proof of their guilt. But they are sufficiently punished, driven as they are from all society, and goaded as they must be by shbme end remorse/"], [71, "OR, POVERTY, CRIME, AND SORROW. 63 ' Oh, yet/ returned Evelina, ' they must, indeed, be suffering greatly, and their future days will be those of misery and self-reproach. I am not sorry, my dear sir, tbat they have saved us the pain and trouble of an investigation, which would have been attended with many un pleasantries, and could cot have afforded us any more gratification than the present defeat ofthose bad people.' * True, my love/ said Langston ; ' but still I should have liked to see the brutal miscreants brought to condign punishment. When I think of the cruelties tbey inflicted on you, I cannot give expression to ray feelings of disgust and indignation. Alas! alas I and I have been the indirect cause of all your luffe. ings, Evelina. My cursed avarice exposed you to those awful trials which it is astonishing to think tbat you did not Bink under.' for tbem, to mark my seme of gratitude and esteem/ Evelina again returned her acknowledgments to her uncle for his kindness, and the conversa tion ceased. Mrs. Snacks watched the progress which our heroine was rapidly making in the regard of Mr. Lang-tun, and it was with difficulty that she could conceal her rage and disappointment ; but she was forced to stifle her feelings as well as she could, and to assume an air of kindness to wards Evelina, which, we reed not say, was rrost foreign to her mind. The influence which the da_.se! bad gained over her aged relative, Mrs. Snacks felt assnred nothing could dimin ish ; and she therefore saw that unless eome determined step was promptly adopted, the schemes of hereelf and Blackthorn would be frustrated, and tbe ho. ob they had for bo long a time encouraged would be annihilated. \u2014 Again she wrote to Blackthorn expressing tbese fears, and urging him to return without delay, that they might together concoct some plan to prevent the evils they apprehended. Stephen Blackthorn's rage increased every day, and he scarcely knew wbat course to adopt, to destroy the power wbich Evelina had obtained over Mr. LangBton. How deeply he regretted that she had dot perished in the workhouse; then there would have been no Impediment in the way of the gratification of his avarice ; the fortune of old Langston must have become his, for he would have had no one else to leave it to ; but but now he bad completely tired him out by the frequent acts of extortion he had practised upon him; and Evelina, it was evident, would enjoy the whole of his favours, unless he adopted some plan to remove her, which he waB fully prepared to do, however desperate it might be. He would have returned borne immediately, but he could not excuse himself to his gay and thoughtless companions, and he was, moreover, in some measure tempted to remain in London some time longer, In consequence of his meeting with an unusual run of luck at the gamh'ing table. Ho therefore wrote to Mrs. Snacks, telling her to keep a strict eye on our heroine, and to endeavour to ingratiate herself in her favour, which might be the means of forwarding their plans and drowning the suspicions ot Evelina. These instructions Mrs. Smacks followed up to the very letter, and so well did she perform her part, that our heroine was quite deceived, and took her to be a very kind and amiable woman; and Mr. Langston was very much pleased at the attention wbich the crafty house keeper paid to his niece ; little die he Imagine the viper he was harbouring ln his bosom, who was seeking to destroy his happiness, and that of her who was so dear to him. Anxious to behold Evelina, a few days after she had been at the hall. Lord Vernon Sidley made an excuse to call npon Mr. Langston, and his wishes were gratified. He was struck with her uncommon beauty, and young as she was, the most guilty paBsions towards her instantly took possession of his breast, and he secretly made a vow that he would obtain possession of her. ' Do not, dear uncle, thus bitterly reproach youself,' said our hero ne ; ' but let the painful past be buried In oblivion, and may you look forward to the future with the brightest hopes.' ' Your words in-piro me with confidence, dear Evelina,' said Mr. Langston : 'and I will, Indeed, try to anticipate nothing hut happiness for the future. You will cheer my declining days, and impart to me that calm and content ment which I never before anticipated. Provi- dence has, indeed, been most merciful to me, in thus enabling me to render some atonement for my cruelty and neglect/ Evelina raised tbe band of her venerable re lative to her lips, and by her looks expressed the gratitude and esteem Bhe felt towards him.\u2014 There was but one circumstance now to cast a hhadow ot gloom over her mind, and that was the wretched fate of her unfortunate father, and fervently did she pray to Heaven that his inno cence might ere long be established, and that he would again be restored to his native land. ln these prayers, Mr. Langston most heartily joined her, and determined, notwithstanding the number of years tbat had elapsed since Mars. den's sentence had been pronounced, to leave no means untried to briDg the real assassins of Colonel Ormond to justice, and to restore him to liberty. In a few days Evelina was highly gratified by receiving letters from Mr. Selbora and Helen, in which they warmly expressed tbeir gratitude to Mr. Langston for his generosity, which they said was far more than the humble services they had renderd her duerved ; and they congratu lated ber warmly on the especial providence tbat had attended her, and placed her under the protection of her only relat ve, at the very time when she thought she had not a friend in the world. They also hoped that at some future period they might have the pleasure of beholding her again, and that she would ever continue to honour them with ber friendship. ' My friendship .' repeated our heroine; 'oh, yes, my amiable friends, you must ever hold the warmest place In try esteem ; sot do I not owe you a debt of gratitude which nothing can ever repays * You do, indeed, my dear child/ said Mr. Langston ; ' but I am not going to let tbe services of Mr. Selborn and his family pass over in this manner ; I must do something more substantial"], [72, "EVELINA, THE PAUPER'S CHILD. 64 Our heroine, however, was not at \u00bb11 pre. posiessed with the manners and appearance of Stephan Blackthorn, and thought she heheld a larking expression In his eje which was any thing but favourable to her. These thoughts, however, she did not reveal to her unole, for she feared he might think her unjust and uncharitable, and, after all, Stephen might be worthy of her warmest esteem. Mr. Langston received his lordship very coldly, and expressed by his loots that he was not b_g_ obliged to him for his visit. Evelina eeuld Sot but look upon that man, who was tasking in the wealtti which ahinld have belonged t. _et poor father, with feellogs approaching to abborrenoe, and she felt glad when he took Mt dsparlare ; for the had noticed the bold and earnest sue which he at intervals fixed upon her, and which raited a eentatlon of the most Blmgrteeble nature in her breast-. ' I am glad he has gone,' said Mr. Langston, wk.i Lord Sidley had quitted the home ; ' and I hope h. will never again trouble me with his visits. He is a bad tnn, Evelina, and irremo- vable misery hat he eaused in many a worthy fcieily. Bttldet, my child, he is the usurper of year rights, and I wonder at hla boldness in daring to lntrodece himself to you. One would have thought that hls own conscience would have non.

' I Ilk. not hit appearance, dear uncle,' said tkt damee], ' bnt Heaven .pardon me if I do hint wrong. Surely it was most cruel in my grandfather to discard his son, and leave him destitute, lavishing the whole of his fortune upon one who was only ao distantly related to him.' 'It was, Evelina,' continued Mr. Langston; ' but even now I have at times my suspicions that the will purporting to be that of Mr. Marsden was not a valid one. However, time, perhaps, may reveal the truth, and justice, though late, be rendered to the injured.' When Lord Sidley left the hall, as he retraced his way home, the extreme beauty and innecene of Evelina occupied his thoughts, and Inflamed bis guilty passionB. It was with great difficulty that Stephan could conceal the rage he felt at the affection with which Mr. Langston viewed his lovely relative, and which convinced him of the influence she had already gained over Sim ; but still he was determined not to be daunted, and doubted not that he should be able to invent some soherae to annihilate her hopw, and to promote his own wishes. After having passed some time in their com pany, he took his leave, and then made his way to the room of Mrs. Snacks, whom he found anxiously awaiting him. ' Well, Stephen,' said the housekeeper, ' what think you of the girl V 'Curses Hght on her,' returned Blackthorn, with a frown ; \u25a0 why did she not die in the work* house years ago t then there would bave been no obstacle remaining to the gratification of my wishes. Oh, she has played her cards well with Langston already ; the old fool seems to doat upon her with the same affection as if she were his own child.' ' He does,' said Mrs. Snacks, ' and she has completely supplanted you, Stephen, that's evident.' ' She has,' coincided Blackthorn, ' but I am not going to suffer myself to be defeated in this manner. She must be removed, Snacks, even if It be by her death.' ' Ah,' ejaculated the housekeeper, ' but still I hope that our plans may be accomplished with out our being obliged to have recourse to such a desperate plan as that. She is very handsome ; do yon not think she is ?' ' Why, for the matter of that the girl is well enough, returned Blackthorn, ' and that renders her the more dangerous. You tay that Lord Sidley visited the hall a day or two since f ' ' He did,' answered the housekeeper. ' And did he tee the girl V 'Yes, and if I may be allowed to judge by hit looks, he greatly admired her.' ' By Heaven 1' he ejaculated, ' she it the fairest being my eyea ever beheld, and would gtace the throne of a monarch. How I envy old Langston the pleasure of her sooiety, I would willingly sacrifice one half of my fortune to obtain eu.h a price, and I am determined that I will not resign all my hopet of getting her jn my power.' With these guilty thoughts the hoary liber tine entered the abbey, and immediately set about endeavouring to Invent tome scheme to put his diabolical wishes into exeoution. Evelina often thought ot the visit of Lord Sidley to tbe hall, trad tbe bold glances he had bestowed upon her, and she felt a secret apprehension of tome danger to be feared from hwn, for whldh the could not very well acoount. She, however, trusted, after the cold reeeption he had met with from Mr. Langston, that he would not be Induced to repeat his visit ; and she resolved most carefully to avoid him. * Ah !' said Blackthorn, after a pause, ' it would be no bad scheme to persuade him to endeavour to get her in hit power. Should she become hit victim, [it would break her heait, and thus my withes would be consummated at once. I will tound bit lordship upon this subject, and lf I find him in the vein, I will render him all the assistance I can to place her in hls power.' At length Stephen Blackthorn, after baving been absent in the metropolis about six weeks, returned home, and lost no time in visiting the hall, where he warmly congratulated Mr. Langs. ton on the recovery of his niece, and assumed so much of respect and sympathy towarda Evelina, (bat the old gentleman was quite deceived, and gave him a much heartier welcome than be \u00a3lh_twise would bave don.

' At any rate I will lose no time ln attempting to put it into execution,' said Stephen ; ' it la seldom that I bave failed Inanythlng upon which I have fixed my mind.

'So Blackthorn,' said Lord Sidley, * you have returned from the gay metropolis then f There have been Btrange events sine . you have been away; and not the least remarkable is tbe res toratijn of the girl, Evelina Marsden, to her aged relative.' * Oh, ye*,' returned Mrs. Snacks, ' you need not fear me In that respect. I will take good care that Evelina has no . uspicbn of me.' Tbe two worthies now separated, and Stephen Blackthorn made his way home, resolving in hla mind the most . illano _s ech. rues against tbe peace and virtu? of our heroine. 'Corses light upen that event, say I,' cried B'ackthorn, passionately. \u2022 It may be the means of depriving me of my fortune.' CHAPTER XIIT. ' Why, certainly,' remarked Lord Sidley, ' tbe old gentleman seems to be quite infatuated with her, and she does stand a very good chance, in my opinion, of supplanting you In his favour. .'

' Say you so, Stephen?' inquired his lordship, eagerly. * No, no,' said Blackthorn, 'that must not be.

Besides, you will then bave companions suited to your age and taste, and will derive that pleasure which it is impossible, for you to experience in the society of an old man like me.' ' My good, kind uncle,' ejaculated our heroine, lookiog affectionately in his face, ' indeed you underestimate the value your society and coun- sels possess in my eyes, and I much fear th -t I have made but a sorry use of tbe time I have been under your protection, to be unable to satisfy you of the strength of my gruitude aud esteem.' 'My sweet child,' exclaimed Mr. Langston, as he pressed a paternal kiss upon the fair girl's forehead, ' indeed I am fully sensible of tbe sin- cerity of your gratitude towards me forthe duty I have so tardily performed, and tho power of your regard; \u2014 but I feel/ \u2014 I feel myself un- worthy of your affections, he would have said; but perceiving the anxious look and gentle ex- pression of reproach which Evelina fixed upon him, he suddenly checked himself, and then added \u2014 ' But come, child, we will talk no more in this strain. At any rate, I am satisfied tbat the society of Helen Selborn and her parents and sisters will add to yo_r pleasures, and there- fore do I feel the more anxious to evince the sense I entertain of tbe debt of gratitude I am under to them. So I will leave it to you to write to them as speedily as possible. I will leave everything to you, I repeat; you will re- quire no dictation, for you know my wishes and intentions. I sh_ll await most impatiently the answer of Mr. Selborn, and I shall feel greatly disappointed if he declines my offer.' Oh no, dear uncle,' said Evelina, her eyes filling with tears of joy, ' I know he will not do so, and 1 shall have the happiness of once more beholding and being the constant companion of those amiable beinge, but for whose kindness the silent grave would probably have inclosed my cold remains. Oh, sir, howjcan I ever sufficiently repay you for this generous conducts' 'No more.no more, Evelina,' returned her venerable relative, with much emotion; \"you ovetrwhelm me by such ardent demonstrations of 'Thanks, thanks,' said the debauchee ; ' should you require money, it Is at your com mand. I do not mind expending a handsome sum to obtain possession of such a lovely being as Evelina Marsden.' ' Well, then, you have nothing to fear, my lord,' observed Blackthorn; 'the girl ia as secure as it she were already in your power.' Again Lord Sidley pressed the hand of his vilHnouB friend, and after some further conversa tion they parted, his lordship entertaining the moBt sanguine hopes of his diabolical wishes being gratified, and Blackthorn rather more easy in his mind, since Lord Sidley had so readily fallen in with hii desires. Another month elapsed without anything particular taking place, but little did our he roiae suspect the dark plot that was in secret concocted against her peace. Stephen Blackthorn visited tha ha 1 almost every day, and Evelina began to look npon him with feelings of greater respect than she experienced when he was first Introduced to her. Spring had now sncceeded the severe winter which had introduced Evelina to the hall, and with that genial season the spirits ofthe damsel aod her guardian revived, aud every day the be came more dear to him, and warm y he poured forth his gratitude to Heaven for having sent him Buch a comfort in his old age. Evelina had frequently corresponded with Mr. Selborn and his family, aud most ardently did they express their wishes, especially the gentle Helen, that they might shortly meet again. Mr. Langston had made every inquiry into the circumstances of this honest family, and, having ascertained that their means were exceed ingly limited, he determined to do something permanent for tbem at the earliest opportunity. * Do you not think, my dear,' said Mr. Langston to bis niece one day, ' do you not think that the Sei boms would be glad to leave the neighbourhood of Allover, If they could get anything better to do, and were to reside near you?' ' Oh, Bir,' answered our heroine, delighted at the thought, ' most happy, I am certain, they would feel, and nothing could afford me greater gratification, than to bave that amiable family residing near me. What a sweet companion should I find in the kind-hearted Helen 1 but I fear that pleasure will never be mine.'

Alas, how many bitter re proaches of conscience has tae conduct of Mr. Selborn saved me. But come, my dear child, I would fain banish these painful thoughts, and look foi ward to the future with hope and plea sure. Ynu will write the letter, Evelina, will you not.' Blackthorn, and communicating this additional and unwelcome intelligence to him. Stephen utterd curses loud and deep, as his worthy colleague proceeded, and when she had concluded, he paced tbe room with hasty and disordered steps, aod his rage was so great that for a few moments it quite took away from him the power of utterance. ' Oh yes, uncle/ replied our heroine, and hei beauteous countenance glowed with delight, ' I will do so immediately ; never was a tak im posed upon me that afforded me such unspeak able gratification.' Mr. Langston pressed her lovely form to his boso _i, aud invoked a fervent benediction upon her head, and she then quitted his presence, and hastens .( to her ow _ apartment, to give fiee vent to her feeling., and to set about her agreeable task. ' The old dotard,' he cried, at length, ' to suffer this beggar's brat, this wheedling's off spring of a convicted murderer, to gain such an influence ever him, that it seems she has now the power to persuade him to anything. Some thing must be done, and that speedily, or all our plans will be annihilated, and tho whole of the old idiot's wealth lavished upon the girl aad her friends. Already, I may say, that he has dis carded me, for he haa refused to yield in future to my de man .a, and his manners and observa tions plainly show that my visits to the hall ace anything but agreeable to him.' The pior girl's heart bounded with at the bare dea of bavins the gent e II !e _ aod her family residing iu the same ne:_h. _\u25a0 urhood wiHiQer; and making suro that Mr. Selborn wo. Id accept the ganerous offer of her uncle, she formed the brightest anticipations of the future. With what alacrity did she sit herself down to write the letter, aad how eloquent did shab.c.me as she proceeded. The offer of Mr. Langston was made with such bewitching delicacy, at the same ti \u25a0 _e the con*e_t of Mr. Selborn waB so earnest y urged, that it ssemed impossible that he could resist It; and when she had complex J the epistle, Bhe hastened to her uncle, and with a bosom throbbing with eager aad delighted hope:., she placed It in his hand. The old gentleman perused it with eager yes and it waa easy to perceive the gratification it &ff-_ded him. When he had concluded, be pressed her delicate hand in his, and warmly did he express his admiration. ' Ay, Stephen/ returned Mis. Snacks, ' there can be very little doubt of that, and since this girl has been at the hall, I have fancied that he has viewed me with anything bat favour, al though I bave takan especial care to oonceal my real feelings from him. Something must be done, as you say, and that quickly, or we shall find ourselves entirely defeated.' ' And that can ouly be prevented by the de struction of Evelina,' observed the villain Black* thorn; 'but I have already concncted a scheme, as I have before told you, which is likely to meet with success. Lord Sidley has seen her, and is captivated with her personal charms ; I need not describe to you bis character. I have sounded him on the subject, and find tbat his inclinations are all that I could wish them to be ; indeed, he is anxious to add Evelina to the long list of his former victims, aud I havo promised to aid him in the accomplishment of his wishes. Let her at once be removed from the hall, care mast be taken that she does not return there again, and then the success of ouz schemes may be considered certain.' ' Dearest Evilina/ he exclaimed, ' how well, how eloq icntly have you here expressed my wishes ; there is not a word that I could add to this, and most ardently do I hope tbat tbe letter may be attended with success. It must be des patched immediately to Mr. Selborn, aad most impatiently shall I await his reply/ The letter was forwarded without delay, and we need not say that the anxiety of Evelina to receive an answer to it was, if possible, even gre.ter than that of her uncle. Bat if the hopes of our heroine were so san guine at this anticipated increase to her happi ness, how great was the vexation and apprehen sion of the evil-minded Mrs. Snacka, who had been male acquainted by tbe unsuspecting dameel with all the particulars. It was not without the greatest difficulty tbat she could conceal her rage from Evelina ; but she stifled her feelings as well as she could, and pretended to congratulate her on the prospec. of the plea sure 6he must experience in the society of those who had behaved with so much kindness to her, and passeu a high encomium on the disinterested generosity of Mr. Langston, at the same time that she eecr.tly cursed him in her heart, and determined to use her utmost endeavours in con- Junction with Stephen Blackthorn ti thwart him in his plans, and work the destruction of Evelina. She lost no time In seeking the presen.o ot * Oh 1' ejaculated Mrs. Snacks, ' the plot is ex cellent, and cannot fail, if properly managed.

It is only by such means that we may deceive him, and put him off his guard.' In this belief, Mrs. Snacks perfectly coincided; and after some further conversation and arrange ment of their diabolical plans, the t_o worthy individuals separated, fully determined on the destruction of our innocent heroine, and reckless of the course they might take to accomplish it. CHAPTER XIV. the artua.l of mr. selborn and his famtlt. the .furtherance of the plot. eve- lina'borne awat prom the hall. We have stated with what impatience Evelina and her uncle awaited the answer of Mr. Selborn, and how mingled were their hopes and fears; for"], [76, "EVELINA, THE PAUPER'S CHILD; 68 eels, expecting them every mioute, notwithstand ing the earlioess of the hour. But the hour of the morning repast struck, aod still they did not make their appearance; and Evelina, whose patience was almost exhausted, Joined her uncle in the breakfast-room. He greeted her with his accustomed affection, aad endeavoured to banish her anxiety, not doubting but that her friends would be there anon. She did becom . a little more patient, and prepared herself to meet them when they should arrive, anticipating her restoration to Helen with the same emotion and anxiety as If she had been her own sister. Little did she expect that her cir cumstances would be so changed when they met again ; and there were moments when she oould scarcely persuade hersell that it was not all a dream. Mr. Langston was not less anxious than his niece/ tonfldent as he was that the society of those amiable people, especially the youthful members of the family, would contribute so much to the happiness of Evelina. Tha letter cams at length ; and with what eagerness did Evelina break the seal in the pre* sence of Mr. Langston, and peruse the contents I Tears of transport started to her eyes. The con tents of the letter were all that could be wished. Mr. Selborn, after having In the most simple but forcible language, expressed his unbounded grati tude to Mr. Langston for his disinterested gene rosity, accepted the offer, and only waited further instructions from him to remove from the neighbourhood in which he was at present re siding. There was a note from Helen enclosed to our heroine, in which that lovely girl expressed the delight she felt at the thoughts of bo soon behold ing her again, and at being permitted to become her future companion, and many were the antici pations she formed of the happiness it would be productive of to them both. The weather was now charming, and every thing wore so different an aspect to what it did when she made her escape from the workhonse, that Evelina could not hut he most forcibly struck with the contrast : and she wept tears of gratitude to Heaven for her miraculous preserva tion from an accumulation of horrors that were almost too dreadful to reflect upon. Mr. Langston expressed his utmost satisfaction at the language in which both of these epistles were conched ; and the favourable impression they had already made upon him, although he had never seen them, was greatly strengthened. He immediately made arrangements for the pur. chase of the farm, which he completed without any difficulty ; and then another letter was for warded without delay to Mr. Selbsrn, informing him that all was in readiness, and that he could enter npon his new occupation as soon as he thought proper. It was not till towards the afternoon that the vehicle containing the humane Mr. Selborn and hls family reached the old haU ; hut it came at last, and Evelina darted to the outer door to greet and welcome them. It is not necessary to particularise the meet ing, as tbe reader, no doubt, will be able to form a conception of the character ot it ; but Helen and our heroine were affected to tears, and Mr. Selborn and his wife could scarcely find words to express their Joy at beholding Evelina again, aud their thanks to Mr. Langston for the un exampled interest he bad taken In their weN fare. The happiness of our heroine was now all but complete, and abe looked forward to the arrival of her bumble, hut amiable friends, with the greatest anxiety. Little, however, did she imagine the bise p 'Ot that was forming against her peace, and the hitter enemies by whom she was uncon sciously threatened. Mr. Langston's reception of the family ofthe Selborns was, as might be expected, of the most cordial description; and their appearance and manners made the most favourable impression upon him. Helen Selborn, in particular, he thought (with the exception of his own niece) was one ofthe most lovely girls he had ever seen, and that never could two beings have been better formed to share each other's friendship. Encouraged by the hearty welcome tbey had received, the humble family shook off their natural diffidence, and finding Mr. Langston as plain ln his manners as in his speech, they Boon became as much at home as if tbey had been on familiar terms for years. Stephen Blackthorn frequently visited the hall, but the reception he met with Irom Mr. Langston was] anything but fla'terlng to his hopes, and Evelina felt an unaccountable uneasinesB while she was in his company. The villain, however, well acted the part he had assigned to himself, paid the greatest respect to Evelina, and warmly applauded the manner io which her uncle had rewarded Mr. Selborn, who had rendered her such an important service. Mr. Langston was, indeed, somewhat deceived by the Bpeciousness of his manner, and thus entertained not the le_Bt suspicion ofthe dark plot he con templated. Mr. Selborn, although his education had been limited, was a man of natural good sense and intelligence, and his behaviour was far superior to that of most persons occupying his humble position in society. He had seen much of the world, and having a keen perception and a reten tive memory, the experience which had thus been placed in his way was not lost upon* Upon many topics he could argue with considerable ability, and Mr, Langston therefore discovered tbat he should find in him an agreeable com panion. Another letter was received from Mr. Selborn, in which he reiterated his thanks, and fixed the day when they might expect him and his family, and expressed his anxiety to get away from a neighbourhood which, from various circumstances, had become disagreeable to him, especially after the atrocities which had been practised in the parish workhouse. Tbe day fixed upon for the arrival of Selborn and his family came at last ; and no sooner had the sun peeped in at the window of her chamber, .has f. veliaa, who had been unable to sleep dutlng fit.

' True,' said Snacks ; ' she Is the main obstacle ; but after what you h .ve told me, I do not fear but that we shall he able to put her out of the way.' It had been arranged previously that the Sel borns should not enter on their new residence until tbe day after their arrival at tbe hall; and the hours now passed In their society were the happiest which Evelina bad ever expeiienced. 'It shall be no fault of mine if we do not,' said Blackthorn, ' but still it would have saved a deal of trouble had Bhe died in the workhouse. And then, this d\u2014 d officious fool, Selborn to res cue her on the night of the snow-storm, when she must, being Bhelterlesa, have perished to a certainty \u2014 I owe him a grudge for that, which I will repay him one of these days with interest, depend on It.' How affectionately did Helen congratulate her onlbe providential change in her circumstances, and the prospect of future happiness that was before ber ; and many were the tears of compas sion she shed, when she recalled to her memory that night of horror, when Evelina was brought by her father, half perishing, to their dwelling ; and she could not but shudder when she refleoted upon the narrow escape which that Innocent and much-Injured girl had had from a frightful death. * No doubt of It/ returned his abandoned com panion ; * but we must first look to the main chance, the disposition of E.elina ; let her once fall into Lord Ternon Sidley _; power, and I ques tion mueh whether old Langston, should he dis cover her, would feel much disposed to acknow ledge her again ; besides, something might be fabricated to satisfy Paul that she was a willing party to her seduction ; and that would flal.h the matter at once, for he would be almost cer tain, in his Indignation, to make a will in your favour, and to banish Evelina for ever.' \" But something told me, dear Evelina,' said Helen, ' that Providence wo .'_ <-,tch over you, and that, however dark aud u.e.ancholy your prospects were at that time, the day would arrive when you would be placed In those circum stances which your virtues merit. Thank Heaven my anticipations are realised, and that, under the protecting roof of your uncle, cruelty and oppression can no longer reach you,' ' True, true,' cried Blackthorn ; ' that ls not a bad idea, and I will see what can be done with it. Ne doubt Lord Sidley would be ready to lend a hand iu the plot ; for it would in some measure exonerate himself. ' Yes, Helen,' answered nur heroine, ' I bave indeed reason to be grateful io the Almighty for hls mercy to me, notwithstanding the many years of suffeiing I endured; I am more than repaid in the happiness of this moment, and In the assurance that there is at least one whom I can love, and who 1 know will return tbat feel ing with all the ardour of a sister/ * Yes,' replied Mrs. Snacks, Mt would. But what think you of this girl, this Helen Selborn V 1 She is very hanl-ome,' said Blackthorn;\u2014 1 nearly as beauts' \u2022 ._ Evelina.' ' Humph I' sai _.i housekeeper, ' she might also be disposed ui to his lordship.' 'That will be a matter for after consideration. But above all, you must keep a sharp look-out upon what takes place here, and let me know immediately should anything transpire that is likely to aid us in our schemes. Helen looked more than her tongue could at that moment give utterance to, and they having embraced tenderly, rejoined the rest of the com pany. In the course of the day, Stephen Blackthorn, whose curiosi'y was much excited to behold the family of the S.ib rn_, visited the hall, and was introduced to tbem. 'Of course I shall,' said Mrs. Snacks, and they then parted. Ste, hen Blackthorn revolved his evil designs in his mind as he made his way towards his home ; and he gave full indulgence, when there was no one to observe, in the rage and jealousies which filled his boBom. Seriously speaklDg, be was ready to perpetrate any crime, however atrocions, rather than that his avaricious hopes should be destroyed ; and he was miscreant enough not to hesitate at anything, even tbe shedding of human blood, to accomp ish any desperate project upon which he had fixed his mind. Although he received them with much polite ness, still there was something ln his manner which was far from pleasing to them ; and Mr. Selborn Imagined more than once or twice that he observed him eyeing them with anything but favourable glances, and there was someting ln the tone of his voice when he addressed them at times, which seemed to leave a doubt of hls sin cerity. And indeed the villain Blackthorn had the greatest difficulty imaginable in disguising the rage he felt at the appearance of these fresh ob stacles to the accomplishment of Mb designs ; but he was more particularly tban all struck with the surpassing beauty of Helen, and scarcely knew which to consider the most fascinating, she or Evelina. Towards Selborn and his wife he felt a deadly spirit of revenge, not only for their having, most likely, been the means of saving the life of her he most hated, bat on account of the favour which Mr. Langston had shown them, and he was fully resolved to leave no means untried to blight their prospects, and to render them wretched; but this, of course, he must do In the most secret nan Der \u2014 for -hould any suspicion fall upon him, his ruin would bs inevitable. He took his leave at rather an early hour, not much to the dissatisfaction ofthe company, and before he left tbe hall, made his way to the apart' ment of Mrs. Snacks. ' Well, Stephen,' said the housekeeper, < vbat think you of our new intruders ?\" 'Curses light upon then all)' returned the ruffian passionately. ' But still it ia not them vs have to Isa. bo much as the gUl Evelina,' The charms of Helen had made a deep im pression upon his licentious heart, and he already entertained hopes of being ultimately enabled to make her his victim, notwithstanding h*f strict virtue and Innocence, and tbe jealous cast \u25a0 .>"], [78, "70 EVELINA, THE PAUPER'S CHILD; The farm was situate only a short walk from the hall, which was another source of gratifi cation to aU parties, as it was nearly the same thing as if they al resided beneath the same roof, and not a day need to pass without their visiting one ano her. with which she would be watcbed over by her parents. He had got within a short distance of his residence, when he beheld Lord Sidley coming towards him. 'How now, friend Blackthorn,' said his lordship, when he had come up to hi.i: ; ' how is the fair Evelina Marsden V Helen viewed this change *n their circumstances with the moat unbounded delight; but much greater was her pleasure to think i hat she would in future be so near to Evelina. * More lovely than ever, my lord,' replied Stephen. ' Oh, methinks you would now be completely enraptured were you to behold her.' 'No doubt of it,* said Lord Sidley; 'but although I have watched eagerly near the hall for the last few days, I have not been able to meet with that de-lrabie opportunity. Old Paul Langston seems to have a pretty good notion of her value, or he would not keep her so secluded. I know also that he views me with no friendly eye, so I oannot form an excuse to visit him.' This, the first day of their residence in their new house, was passed in tbe most delightful manner, and Evelina aod her uncle did not leave them till the evening, when the latter returned home, with the happy consciousness that he had done his duty, and placed a worthy and virtuous family in a si uation of comfort, and of comparative independence. 'True, my lord,' remarked Blackthorn; ' Langston, I am certain, entertains but a very Indifferent opinion cf your lordship ; but still, in spite of all his care and vigilance, he may be foiled in bis darling hopes, a id it shall be my constant study to do so. If it be your lordship's wish still to get the girl in your power, I promise you that you shall not be disappointed.' Oh, how widely different were now his feelings to wbat the> had been when he was blinded by sordid avarice. How much more calm and happy did he sleep, with the certainty that the blessings of Heaven would be invoked upon his head by Evelina, and those whom he had be friended ; and ne.d we say that they were, and tbat never were prayer, uttered with greater fervour or sincerity I Mr. Langston had indeed conferred the most superlative happiness upon the most worthy individuals, and he met with a Just aad ample reward in the satisfaction it im parted to his mind. 'Thanks, thanks, good Stephen Blackthorn,' said the hoary libertine, with a look of satis faction; ' your words encourage me to hop., for I know you will not deceive me.' 1 Your lordship has good lesson to think so, for you never found me to betray you in all the transactions we have had together.' And great was tbe felicity wbich Evelina ex perienced now tbat she bad thos? beings whom she had so much reason to esteem, so near her, and she pictured to herself the many pleasures Bhe would derive from their society. And she would be the constant companion of the gentle and affectionate Helen, whose disposition was so much in unison with her own, that had they been sisters, they could not have been expected to love each other more tenderly. Tbat thought was ot It .elf more than sufficient to transport the amiable girl to a pitcn of ecstasy Bhe had never before felt tv animate her breast. Hitherto she had known nothing but the gloomy society of thc inmates of the workhouse ; smiles of esteem, or looks of commiseration were unknown to her; sbe was left to the misery of ber own thoughts, without one sympathising bosom to which she could confide her sorrows ; but never having met with anything but cruelty and oppression, looked upon every one with dread and suspicion. But now how striking was the contrast. So marked indeed was the change that she could not, without tbe greatest difficulty, persuade herself that it was but all some delusive dream. ' I never did. And, remember, Blackthorn, that I am no niggard towards those who serve me. But I am all impatience. When will you attempt to put your designs into execution V ' I will delay my plans no longer than I can help, my lord,' answered Stephen ; ' but we must not be in t.o much of a hurry, or we mi^ht render abortive all our schemes. In a few days I hope to be able to let you know more. Yon may depend upon it tbat I am as impatient for the removal of the girl as you can be to bave her in your power.' 1 Well,' returned Lord Sidley, after a pause, ' I will leave everything to you, confiding In your prudence, perseverance, and fidelity.' ' That you may do with safety, my lord,' Baid Blackthorn. He then informed his lordship ofthe arrival of the Selborn family, and after some more conversation of little Importance, they parted. Thus it will be seen, that Evelina and her friends were threatened with the greatest danger ; but whether the miscreants succeeded in their designs or not must be shown hereafter. The following day after their arrival from the neighbourhood of Allover, Mr. Selborn and his family took possession of their new residence, and were accompanied to it by Evelina and her uncle. It was a small house, but particularly neat, abounding with every domestic comfort, and possessing a considerable quantity of Und in a high state of cultivation. AU the other ne cessary appendages of a farm, both animal and mecaaical, it had been furnished with, through the liberality of Mr. Langston ; and the honest family, when they beheld it, were again at a Loss for words in which to express their gratitude to tbe generous donor. That night the most delightful visions flitted before the busy imaginations of our heroine, and when she awoke in the morning, it was with a heart light aud buoyant, and with hopes the most brilliant aud sanguine tbat she had ever before indulged in. She descended to the parlour, and found her uncle already there, and his countenance bore a greater expression of serenity and peace than she had noticed for some slme ; and he felt it too. \u2014 Such is the reward of virtuous actions. Evelina greeted him with the greatest affection, and once more she expressed to him her gratitude for the"], [79, "OU, ?OYgftTY, CRIME, AND SORROW. 71 unexampled benevolence he had shown to those who had rendered her such disinterested service In the time of need.

Mr. Selborn and his family had now been at the farm about two months, and nothing had occurred jo disturb their peace, while the pros pects before them were of the most brilliant and flattering description. Evelina and her uncle, too, were most happy, and the former had learned to look back upon her early sorrows with tran quillity and resignation, although the melancholy fate of her parents would often occur to her recollection, and cast tbe only dark shadow upon that which would otherwise have been all sunshine. But little did any of them suspect the evil designs which were being formed against them. The morning repast bei. g over, Mr. Langston proposed a walk to the farm, and we need not Bay with what pleasure Evelina agreed, and made immediate preparations for the j oyful visit. They found Helen and her parents already waiting to recei.e tVm, and the meeting was as cordial as if they had been separated for years. Mr. Selborn aud hls family were as much at home in tbe fann as if th. y- bad been its occu pants from their earliest youth, aod Mr Langston could pere ive that Selborn would, by his induse try, in the course of a very short time, place himself in a position to realise independence, which he could never, even by the strictest per sever nee, economy, and Judgment, bave done in the humble and laborious situation in which he was bo recently placed ; and he felt the greatest satisfaction in tbe thought that hon eat integrity and worth would he thus properly rewarded. Stephen Blackthorn, although he had not yet had an opportunity of putting his diabolical scheme against Evelina into effect, bad not abandoned it ; aud he and Lord Sidley continued indefatigable in their endeavours to invent some stratagem by which the latter might get her in hls power, and make ber the victim of his un lawful paasions ; but they had not hitherto been able to hit upon any design which met their mutual satisfaction. Mr. Langston's prejudices and suspicions against Blackthorn were somewhat renewed, as he bad lately appeared more steady, and bad not made any more demands upon his parse. And indeed Stephen did not stand In need of it, for Lord Sidley liberally supplied him with money whenever he required it, and. thus the villain reaped a benefit both ways, and was enabled to carry on his secret designs with a greater chance of success. His lordship, however, began to grow impatient at tbe delay In the gratification of his wishes, and several times suggested to Blackthorn tbe propriety of making a bold effort at once, and to seize upon our heroine in one of her rambles, and convey her to an eatate which he had Ina retired part of the country. This, Stephen Blackthorn for the present opposed, s'atlog as his reason, tbat in order to lull .uspl cion and prevent discovery, it would be neces. sary to contrive some scheme by which tbe damsel might be borne away In a more secret manner ; and at length the libertine nobleman consented to abide by his advice entirely. That day, like the previous one, was passed by the friends in tbe greatest harmony and plea Sure, and Evelina felt tbe deepest regret when the time arrived for them to part, although they knew that tbey should shortly meet again. Thus day after day passed away, Mr. Selborn and his family at every meeting which took place between them gaining more favour in the opinion of Mr. Langston, and imparting a sweet conso lation to him in witnessing the happy effects of his bsnevolence on these who so richly merited It. Evelina and Helen were seldom apart, and in the sweet interebange of sentiments, and in fol lowing the most intellectual pursuits, they obtained that mutual instruction which tbey had previously only had an opportunity of deriving In bo limited a degree. Sometimes they would disengage themselves from the society of their relatives and friends, and indulge In long rambles among the beautiful scenery in the neighbour hood, and being both of them the most enthusias tic admirers of the wonders aod beauti.s of nature, these little excursions formed the most delightful sources of their recreations. Just at this juncture tbe unfortunate Lady Sidley, who had, through illness and her hus band's cruel neglect and ill-treatment, been a snfferer for so man y years, expired ; much to the satisfaction of bis lordship, who considered tbat he had thus got rid of an incumbrance, and au obstacle to the full gratification of his aban doned propensities. Certainly be did not play the hypocrite by making any display of grief, wbich he did not feel on the demise of his lady ; and her remains were consigned to the family vault, with scarcely even decent ceremony ; no one evincing any grief, bnt Westbourne Sidley, her son, and some of the oldest of the servants, who had been devotedly attached to her. Helen had a .great taste for music ; she possessed a charming voice, and frequently when they felt themselves tired with their rambles, tbey would seat themselves in some retired spot, and Helen would Bing some of her most simple and beautiful ballads, in a style that must have riveted the attention, and excited the admira tion of all who had the pleasure of listening to her. Our heroine, too, had a voice of the most musical sweetness, and Helen had taken the greatest pains to instruct her In all she knew. \u2014 Sometimes then they joined each other In a duet, and frequently did they impart additiona' plea sure to the family circle by their vocal efforts, or Lord Sidley did not suffer the death of his lady to interfere with his designs against Evelina : on the contrary, he urged Stephen Blackthorn to be as piompt as possible i\u00bb putting them into opera tion, as bis patience was quite exhausted ; and"], [80, "EVELINA, THE PAUPER'S CHILD. 72 ' Stop I stop I I beseech yon, lovely girls ; but one word with you !' his lordship exclaimed ; and they could hear hit footsteps In pursuit of them; but thil only added to their epeed, and at length, having lost Ihe sound of his footsteps, they looke* back, and beheld him standing at tome dlstanoa from them, and apparently gating with mingled feellngt of admiration and disap pointment after them. They turned abroptly Into the lane which le* towards the farm, and there lott tight of him, and they now ventured to panta, and take breath, after the exertion and alarm they had undergone. Although there wal nothing very extraordinary ln thit circumttance, yet It canted tbe fair friends much uneasiness, knowing the character of hit lordship, and especially after the boldness of tbe looks which he had fixed upon them, and the words he had addressed to them to prevail upon them to stop ; and they determined to be more'eautiout in their rambles for the future. They soou arrived at the farm, where they found Mr. Langston and the others most anxiously awaiting their return, and rather surprised at the unusual length of their absence. They per ceived ln a moment, from the agitated expression of their countenances, tbat something had hap pened to them, and they eagerly inquired what it was. With some hesitation they informed them, and the countenances of them all glowed with Indignation. be promised him that, should he once get ber in his power, .he should never trouble him (Black thorn) again. Stephen needed nothing to prompt him to a deed wbich would remove the only obstacle to the gratification of his avarice ; but he did not like to be too preclptfete, lest his designs should be thwarted ; and it being discovered, probsbly, that he was the villanout author of the whole plot, he would not only be exposed to shame, but punishment. The more Blackthorn saw of Helen, too, the more was he captivated with her charms, aod longed to get possession of her. But this was no \u2022asy task, and he knew not how he should accom plish It : however, he could not think of abandon ing all hls hopes with any degree of patience. Thus matters stood at the period from which we have slightly digressed ; and the worthhy Mends conld not have the slightest suspicion of the evil machinations that were being concerted against them, and flattered themselves that no thing would occur to interrupt their happiness ; but It was their fate ere long to discover how much they were mistaken. One day Evelina and Helen had rambled fur ther from home than usual. Attracted by the fineness of the weather, for It was now the middle of summer, and the romantic scenery, when feeling themselves tired, and at It wai yet only early In the afternoon, they sat themtelvet down to rest beneath the cooling shade of some trees, previous to retracing their steps towards home. ' Lord Vernon Sidley it an abandoned, heart less villain, as I have good reason to know,' observed Mr. Langston, ' and mtny ue the sorrowing hearts that he has caused. It is dangerous for beauty and innocence to be placed in his way, for he delights in its destruction. You must be more cautions, my dear girls, in your walks for the future, for there ls no knowing the miscreants that may lurk ln secret te entrsp you, or the guilty designs which may already be formed against you. The boldness of Lori Sld'ey in presuming to address you, surprises me not, for no one ls better acquainted with his character than myself.' The spot was a most inviting oue \u2014 so calm, so quiet, so secluded. As far as their eyes could trace, they did not behold a human being; nothing bat the cattle that were grazing in the adjacent meadows, and the bleating of the sheep, and the mellfluo s notes of the feathered songsters in the trees and bushes, were the only sounds which saluted their ears. They patted a sew minutes in cheerful convert tation, and then t' e two lovely frienda, in the exhubsrance of their spirits, and not observing any one near to listen to them, commenced sing ing one of those simply beautiful duets, with whleh they so often charmed their dearest friends, aud which even the most insensible could not have listened to without feelings of trsnsport and admiration. No two voices could harmonize more sweetly ; and wafted as their melodious tones were upon the tranquil air, it bad a most charming effect. Evelina and Helen shuddered, but they could not make any reply. ' And can it be possfcle,\" said Mr. Selborn, ' that his lordship can disp'ay such levity so toon after the death of hit wises 1 He ls capable of anything, however base,' returned Mr. Lmgston ; ' besides, he never loved the late Lady Sidley, and he behaved to her, at all times, with the greatest barbarity ; ne doubt she died of a broken heart.' They were suddenly aroused and alarmed, however, by beholding the tall shadow of a human form upon tbe grass, and looking up, their astonishment and confusion may be easily imagined when they beheld, standing with folded arms and lookt of delight, immediately behind them, Lord Vernon Sidley I ' He must indeed be a bad man,' remarked Mr. Selborn, ' according to the aoeouut you give of him.' ' And in which, I deeltre to you, I have not exaggerated,' returned Mr. Langston. ' Even the property he now luxuriates la, belongs of right to the unfortunate father of my niece/ With a simultaneous ory of amazement and alarm \u2014 for Mr. Langston had given them a faithful description of his lordship's character, and Evelina could not but regard him with in creased repugnance, knowing that he was usurping the rights of her unfortunate father \u2014 they started immediately to their feet ; and without venturing even to glance towards Lord Sidley, they fled as fast as their limbs could carry them from tbe spot. Tea's trembled in the eyes of Evelina at this allusion to her ill-fated father, and she covered her face with her hands and sobbed bitterly. ' But did not the late Mr. Marsden discard hit ton, and bequeath the whole of hil fortune to hil lordship !' inquired Mr. Selborn.

But let him beware how he attempts to injure me, or she who is dearer to me than my very life ; for old and feeble though I am, I would bave such a revenge tbat he little anticipates.' Evelina looked at her uncle with amazement and alarm, but the received no answer, and the aupper being over, they separated for the night, and she retired to her chamber.

'But it is indispensable that you should give me some idea of what your intentions are.'

He slept but little that night for ruminating upon bis diabolical design., and he awaited the arrival of the next day, when Blackthorn had promised to meet him again, with tbe utmost impatience. Stephen Blackthorn, after he had quitted the abbe^y, made tis way to the placs where he had appointed to meet his colleagues, not doubting bat that they would behold him with no smaU degree of pleasure, when he should impart to them the promises of his lordship, and especially when he presented them with a more substantial gua rantee of the sincerity of his intentions, in the shape of the gold he had given him to bs dis tributed among them. \u2022GoGd evening, Blackthorn ; to-morrow, then, you will call upon me again ?' 1 1 will, your lordship, and then we will further arrange our plans/ ' Which must be crowned with success,' said Lord Sidley. * They must,' replied his villanous myrmidon.

Oh, Richard Marsden, what w mid be your feelings did you kaow that your daughter waa doomed to be the victim of your greatest enemy \u2014 the pos\u00ab sessor of your rights ?

But she must have been too young at the time to ha.e been made acquainted with the particu lars, and if even she were, time must have banished it from her memory. However, it matters not, I cannot expect to win her esteem, but once let me get her within my power, and she cannot help herself; \u2014 she must yield to my wishes. As for her reproaches, I am fully pre pared for them, and can laugh them to scorn.

I know nothing of it, but by name; and the possession of such a damsel es Evelina Marsden were worth any risk tn obtain. She shall, she must be mine. Stephen Blackthorn isa villain admirably suited to my purpose, and it is to his own interest especially to serve me in this particular. He has well laid his plans, aad is doubtless certain of their success ; I will rest my mind satisfied upon thi* t point. Oh, it ls a fortunate thing that Lady Sidley h_s gone to her last home, for she might have presented some obstacle to the accom plishment of my plans ; but now I can leave the abbey without any one questioning me as to whither I am going, unless it is my son ; and he I may easily deceive as to the place of my destination. It is strange that Westbourn should bo so unlike me in disposition; but he always looked up to his mother with the greatest re verence, and no doubt she took great pains to instil her precepts into his mind. Well, be it bo; he cannot obstruct me In any way, and he has ever shown the most implicit obedience to my will. In spile of the difference of his ptin\u00ab The place of meeting was an old public-house, which waB known as the resort of no very re putable characters ; and waa so situated that it \u25a0well answered the purpose of carrying on any secret designs.

Blackthorn knew them well, for they had been his associates in many a diabolical stratagem; and indeed they were so connected together, that they were in constant dread of each other, and it was only fear that now linked them together. ' Well, Blackthorn,' Baid one of the fellows, a sturdy and ferocious -looking ruffian, apparently between forty and fifty years of age ; ' you have come V 'Certainly, Joe Elsby,' answered Stephen; 4 when did you know me hreak my word ?' ' Why, for the matter of that/ returned Joe, ' I don't know that you have, very often, with us, at any rate; because you see that wonld neither have been prudent nor convenient. But have you seea the swell?' ' I have,' replied Blackthorn, taking a Beat, and helping himself to a glass of the spirits which they had before them. ' And does he keep in the same humour?' asked another of the fellows, who was known among his own companions only as Jack D_gley.

Tue mornlog of that day, which was to ter- minate eventually, at length dawned, and Evelina meeting her uncle in the breakfast- roiim was miserably depressed in spirits, though from what cause she could not imagne.

' Dear me, no, sir,' answered Mrs. Snacks, 'consider how early it is, and as she was so poorly last night, she will probably feel Inclined to lie an hour er two later this morning, which it is to be hoped will do the dear young lady good.' The distracted old man rushed all over the house, calling wildly upon her na Tie, and Mrs. Snacks followed his example. Bat when he discovered that she wa., Indeed, nowhere about the mansion, he threw himself on his knees, in a paroxysm of grief, and clasping his hands toge ther, sobbed bitterly. ' Susan,' said Mr. Langston, hastily, as he en tered the ball, ' do you not know this bracelet ?' Mrs. Snacks stared at the bracelet with much astonishment and some confusion, and then ejaculated \u2014 ' Why, surely that must be Miss Evelina's bracelet, sir.' 'Oh, God! \u2014 oh, God 1' he groaned; 'this blow Is more than I can bear; what base trea chery has been st work here ?

Tell mei woman ; did you not hear any noise in the night V 'Oh, lord, no, sir,' said Mrs. Snacks. 'I heard nothing at all. After I had left you, and seen the doors secured, I retired to rest, and being rather fatigued, I slept soundly. But how eould any one have gained an entrance lute the house?' ' It Is,' said Mr. Langston, ' the one I myself presented her. I picked It up just now la the poplax walk.' ' Impossible, sir/ said Mrs. Snacks, * fox the young lady had it on her wrist, I'll b wear, last nigbt, when she xetired to rest. ' Yes, yes,' said Mr. Lanston, with much agi tation, 'I, myself, saw it there; and yet I but just now found it in the place I have mentioned. There is some fearful mystery In this which must be immediately solved. Are you certain that Evelina has not left the hall this morning?' ' Oh, I am quite positive, sir ; it is not likely she would do such a thing, so poorly as she was.' \u2022 I will immediately alarm the whole neigh bourhood,' exclaimed the frantic old man, start ing to his feet, and his countenance exhibiting all the wild expression of a madman. ' Wretch s shall not deprive me of her whom I love dearer than my own life. Evelina ! Evelina ! oh, where a* tbou ?' * Hasten to her chamber, then, immediately, and banish this suspense by ascertaining whsther she has risen yet.' 'I will, sir,' answered the housekeeper, with well feigned alacrity, and walked up the stairs, whle her master entered his study, and throwing himself into a ohalr, awaited her xeturn with much Impatience and many misgivings. Thus Baying, tbe poor old gentleman rushed from the hall, much to the relief and amaze ment of the wretch, Mrs. Snacks, who, as soon as he had left the place, threw herself into a ohalr, and b arst Into a convulsive fit of laughter, which was some minutes before it subsided, and then not till the worthy woman's face was red, black, and blue, with the violence of the exertion she had undergone. Now was the time for Mrs. Snicks to complete the plot ; and she had no sooner entered the chamber than she gave utterance to a piercing scxeam of terror, which reached the ears of Mr. Langston, who rushed terrified up stairs ; he beheld her as he imagined in a dreadful state of agitation, and about to faint. He cast h is eyes towards the bed, and beholding It empty, his heart sank within him; and he eagerly de manded\u2014 \" Capital \u2014 excellent !' she exclaimed ; ' I de clare it's as good as a play.

It seemed to be scarcely possible that such a calamity could have taken place : lor who could have been guilty of so daring and cruel an outrage ? and by what means could the villains have gained admittance to the haH, or have succeeded ln bearing Evelina away without her cries alarming Mr. Langston or hi. housekeeper ? A few minutes of the most intense agony followed, and none of them wexe In a condition to endeavour to Impart consolation to the wretched Mr. Lings ton. and if the girl should, by any accident, be re stored to her crazy old uncle, which I trust she will not, the least suspicion cannot fall upon either I or Blackthorn, as we have not been at all in the matter. I did not think I was half so clever a hypocrite though.' It will be Been by this, that tbe amiable Mrs. Snacks had much underrated her intrinsic qua lifications, a thing quite common with ether modest and unassuming individuals in the world. Having indulged in these little exclamations of delight, MrB. Snacks refreshed herself with a glass of brandy, and prepared herself to receive Mr. Langston in a becoming manner ou hiB return to the ball. Helen wept bitterly and wrang her hands' with anguish, and painfully did she recall to her memory the melancholy forebodings of oor he* rolne the day before. It was some time ere they could form the least conjecture as to the best course to adopt ; but at length, Mr. Selborn suggested that it would be prudent to make the magistrates acquainted with the circumstance without delay, so that tbe most vigilant inquiries might be immediately set on foot. Mr. Langston then expressing a desire to return home, Mr. Sel born accompanied him to the hall, where he waB taken so ill that his fenses leit him, and he was instantly conveyed to bed, and his medical advisor was called in. Shortly after this, the villain Stephen Blackthorn arrived at the hall, and upon being made acquainted with what had happened, 'he evinced much astonishment and excitement, and pretended to question MrB. Snacks very narrowly. In the meantime, the distracted Paul Langaton With his hands clasped to his burning temples, and groaning loudly, dashed along the road which led to the residence of Mr. Selborn, where he arrived shortly, and just as the farmer was emerging from the house, and was about to cross the yard. Surprised to behold Mr. Langston so early, and at tbe wildness of his demeanour, Mr. Selborn was fearful that something serious had happened, and immediately hastened to open the gate, and give him admittance. He had no sooner done so than Mr. Langston staggered towards him, ansi, grasping his arm, was unable to give utterance to anything but a groan. ' For Heaven's sake, Mr. Langston, what is the matter ?' demanded Selborn, with breathless haste. ' Something serious must have happened to agitate yon thus. Pray, do not keep me io suspense, but tell me what it is.' 'My child, my Evelina!1 gasped forth the wretched man. 'This is a most mysterious snd melancholy affair,' he observed, ' and I am at a perfect loss to form a conjecture upon the subject. I could not have believed that the amiable Evelina could have had an enemy in the world, after leaving that wretched asylum where it was her hard lot to pass her days of childhood. But It seems to me impossible that the villains, whoever they may be, can escape long, and immediate steps must be taken to discovex them and bring them to justice, and to restore the poor girl to her friends. MrB. Snacks, see after your master, to whom I feax this will pxove a death-blow, and I will immediately wait on the magistrates and obtain their assistance.' ' Ah 1 what of her V hastily inquired Mr. Selborn. ' Say, is she ill?' * 111, ill I Oh, she has left me. No, no, she has not left me of ber own free will. She was t Jo foad, too virtuouB, to do that.

There must be some mistake in this.' \\\\ Mr. Langston impatiently shook hia head, but 'could not return any answer, and Mr. Selborn, \u25a0 taking his arm, supported him into the parlour, and placed him in a chair. Helen and her mother were there, and, with anxious looks, they iQQulred the cause of Mr. LangBton's vio- lent emotion. ' And if you have no objection, sir, I will ac company you,' said Mr. Selborn. ' As you pleaae, sir,' answered Blackthorn, ' and I thank you in the name of my father-in law, for the interest you take in this business.' Blackthorn and Mrs. Snacks exchanged looks with one another, unperceived by Mr. Selboxn, and then they quitted the Hall. 'My child I my poor Evelina!' at length sobbed the poor old man, aud tears chased each other down his venerable cheeks. ' Last night she retired to her chamber very poorly, as Helen knows she had been all the day; this morning I walked forth early, and picked up her bracelet in the poplar walk, although she had it on hex wrist when we separated last night. I returned home, and on my housekeeper repairing to her room, to ascertain whether she bad risen, it was found tbat she had dial ppeaxed, and that her bed had never been slept in. Oh, God 1 have mercy on me, and suffer me to retain my seuses under this dreadful calamity.' Having made the magistrates actual .ted with all the particulars, Blackthorn and Mr. Selborn separated, promising each other to bo indefati gable in their endeavours to discover the villains and to restore Evelina to ber distracted uncle. Tho plausible manner ol Blackthorn quite de ceived Mr. Selborn, and did away with many prejudices which he had previously imbibed against him. Selborn returned to the hall, and found his daughter there, and ia an excited state of feel* ing which may be vexy readily imagined.

'You have every reason to be, my lord,' replied Blackthorn. 'JoeElBby and his com panions would use all the expedition they could, and probably arrived at tbe place of their desti nation before daylight this morning.' 'And if they did, I may hope fox their return between this and the evening.' 'The fates promise to favour me,' he mut tered to himself, as he walked on ; ' and I did not expect to be half so successful. The girl, no doubt, is by this time in safety, and where they will find it a difficult matter to discover her. She must never appear to trouble me again. Oh, no, I will take good caxe of that ; or, if she even should escape, before then, old Langston will probably be no more, and I shall have secured to myself tbe whole of his property. I shall have no reason to fear her then, and if she can obtain her liberty she may and welcome for me. Mother Snacks has well played her part, or we should never have been able most likely to have put our plans into execution. She deserves a good reward, and I will not be worse than my word with her, in one respect, but lf she expects I am sincere In the other promises I have made hex, Bhe is a fool.' ' You may.' ' I await it with the utmost anxiety, and if they use promptitude, I will make them an extra reward to that which I have already pro mised them.' ' They will lose no time far their own sakes,' said Stephen ; ' but talking about the reward, my lord, it will be as well to settle that business at once.' ' Very well,' said Lord Sidley. 'Here is the money I agreed to pay them, which I will leave to you to settle with them ; as for yourself, I must leave you to name your own sum, and any thing within the bounds of reason, I am ready to give you.' * What is between you and I, my lord,' re marked Blackthorn, ' we will settle another time. But there is another who needs some guarantee of your gratitude, for the active part she has taken ln our plot.\" On arriving at the abbey he wa\u00ab instantly shown into the presence of Lord Sidley, who received him with much eagerness and plea sure. 'Mrs. Snacks?' 1 The same.' 1 Well, Blackthorn/ he inquired, ' have yon heard anything from the hall ?' ' Ay, I am indeed greatly Indebted to her, aud I request you to ask her acceptance of this purs?, with a promise that I will remember her hand somely another time.' ' Ay,' replied Stephen, ' I was there not more than an hour ago, and left old Langston in a state ofinsen .ibility.' ' The fool parts most freely with is money,' thought Blackthorn; ' probably thinking that by right it belongs to his iutended victim.' ' And they have no suspicion f I mean Lang ston and those friends of his, Selborn, is not that their name ?' ' Anl now,' said Stephen, 'are you still resolved to depart yourself for Sarnscombe to morrow ?' ' Suspicion ?' repeated Langston ; ' certainly not ; bow is It likely they can have ? The business was managed too cleverly for that, I have pretended tbe greatest affliction at the mysterious disappearance of the girl, and myself and Selborn have been to inform the magistrates of what has taken place, and to obtain their as sistance in the capture of the villains who have committed this daring outrage.' 1 That depends upon the time when the fellows return, and the Intelligence they bring,' his lord ship replied. 1 For my part,' observed Blackthorn, 'I think you had much bettet defer your journey for a day or two. Should you absent yourself too soon, some suspicion might be excited against you.' 'I do not veay well see how it can,' returned Lor _ Sidley, ' besides I cannot rest until I have had an interview with tbe lovely Evelina, and poured forth my passion at her feet.' ' Ha ! ha I ha !* laughed Lord Sidney, ' and of coarse you heartily hoped they might succeed, Blackthorn?' ' Certainly,* coincided Blackthorn, with an ironical smile, ' but you must acknowledge, my lord, that this p'ot has been managed with re markable Ingenuity.' ' Yea,' returned his lordship, ' thanks to you, ' It is not at all unlikely that the grief and horror she will naturally experience at being thus torn from her home, will render her in a condition not fit to behold you, and you must allow her some time to recover herself, or yon cannot expect to accomplish your wishes.' my friend, whom I shall never forget.

'And you will call upon me Immediately after you hsve seen them, to let me know what suc cess they have met with, will you not?' asked his lordship. Blackthorn replied In the affirmative, and then took his leave, and once more bent his course towaxds the hall, pondering with much satisfac tion upon the present aspect of his affairs. He found Mr. Langston in a most deplora- ble condition, still quite insensible, and raving ln the most mslanoholy manner. He was attended by Mrs. Selborn, much to the annoy- anc. of Mrs. Snacks, who was, however, \u2022ompelled to stifle her vexation, aud pretend to be mnch obliged to her for the solicitude she evfnosd in her matters misfortunes, and the assistance she rendered her. Blackthorn affected ti bs deeply concerned at toe situation of the old gentleman, and was not at all sparing of his curses upon tbe headi of the villains who had committed so daring end inhuman a deed; but it need not be aald that he ear nestly wished that every moment would be Mr. Langaton s lost. Stephen Blackthorn who was present when the distracted old man made nae of these observations, concealed his real feelings with wonderful ability, and even reciprocated Mr. Langstoa'e malediction. So well did the villain play his part, that every one who saw hi n was deceived, aad whatever prejudices they might previously have enter tained against him, they were now completely r .moved by the apparent sincerity of his man ner. Oh, how the mlacreant exulted at the success of hia nefarious schemes so far, and he enter* tained the strogest hopes that tbe shock would have suoh aa effect upon the system of old Paul Langstoo, that be would never recover from II ; and then Indeed his __rtune was made. Who was t,_ stand between him and the old mau'i wealth? He knew very will, from what Mrs. Snacki had communicated to him, and which indulgence she had gained by her usual prying syatem, that Paul had made a will la favour of Evelius ; that will he had every hope of abstract ing from Ita depository, and substituting another which he ha _ already forged, and which in the event of tbe old man's death, would establish his claim to all he possessed without de . put.'. Tha magistrates had lost no time la taking the proper steps for the detection of the villains, and the recovery of our heroins ; but hitherto they had not been enabled tu gain the least Infor matlon, and it seemed not at all unlikely, eo cleverly had the plot been contrived, that it would remain, for some time at lent, Involved In myatery. It waa strange by what means the perpetrators of the outrage bad obtained access tv the house, for none of the entrances had been forced, and all the doors w_re found the same In the morning as they had been se cured ou the night before. Suspicion never for But moat anxiously did the villain wait the return of Joe Eiaby and his companions. Iu spite of all his assorts to the oontrary, he eould not help having some misgivings as to tbe result Of their plot ; and yet he could not account for such thoughts entering his breast. The opiate which had been administered to E7ellna by Mrs. Snacks, would, no doubt, maintain Its effect for a considerable time, and until tbey had arrived at the place of their destination ; and even if she should recover, they would know how to deal with her, and prevent her cries from bringing any assistance, although it was not likely that she coald de so considering the liteness of the hoar, and the lonely and unfrequented route they purposed to travel. Of their fidelity, he enter tained not the least doubt, as he bad tried It on frequent import int occaslonB h. fore, and they had never failed to accomplish their designs with the greatest ability, which they were more likely than ever now to do, as they had the promise of ao much larger a reward than they had been in the habit of receiving. After Blackthorn bad pasted some time with a moment rested on Mrs. Snacks, who was gene rally believed to be a very faithful servant \".o Mr. Langaton, and thua every one who reflected on the circumstance became lost in the maze of fruitless conjecture, and give up the task in des pair. Thus were Blackthorn and Mrs. Snaoks left to exult in secret at the success of th.ir diabolical schemes.

In vain she tried to imagine Into whose hands ahe had fatleu, but \u25a0he waB unable tu fix upon any one the slightest suspicion ; and as the day advanced, and still not tbe least intelligence could be gained of the poor girl, Helen's anxiety and apprehensions Increased, and she formed all binds of fruitleis conjectures, and gsve her up as entirely lost.

Of their prudence and fidelity, he en , tertained not the smallest fear, but there were ' many accidents which might have occurred to them, aad thus have thwarted their schemes ; ' and he continued to traverse the little back par- lour of the tavern with hasty and disordered steps. The clock struck nine, and they were still absent ; and Blackthorn unable to control his impatience or to wait there any longer, do- parted to the abbey, in order that he might con- sult Lord Sidley on the subject. He knew that his lordship would, if possible, be enduring even greater anxiety and impatience than himself and on his arrival at the abbey he found that he was not mistaken. ' Well, perhaps it would have been better had I dooe so,' returned Blackthorn ; ' but I did not think of it/ 'It would have saved us a deal of anxiety.

' Never !' exclaimed the libertine : ' my pas sion may and must Increase in strength, but can neve, abate.'

' We understand one another perfectly well upon that point, my lord,' satd Blackthorn. \u2022gain.' ' It is on that understanding that I have ' I believe we do,' returned his lordship.

' A very short time will do so, take my word for it.'* ' You appear most sanguine, Blackthorn ; are you sincere !\" * I am. Why should I seek to deceive you * ' I do not know why you should wish to do so.' Lord Sidley remained for a few minutes wrapped in deep meditation, after he had departed, and his mind wai in a state of the most unconquera ble aoubt and apprehension. He did not enter tain the least suspicion of tbe sincerity of Ste phen Blackthorn, for be was aware that he must be as anxious aa he was himself that Evelina should bo secured ; but notwithstanding all tbat he had said, he could not place quite so much confidence in the fidelity of Joe Elsby and his companions, and it waa in vain that he tried to banish from his bosom the most powerful _ ppre hensions of tbe failure of their scheme; ia 'Certainly not, when I am as much inter ested ln her captivity as your lordship.* ' Exactly so. Oh, Blackthorn, only let mo know that the beauteous damsel is in my power, and I shall be the happiest man in existence. I have triumphed over many a lovely specimen of nature's work in my time, but never one who half so captivated my sensea as this maiden. Methinks that I could almost worship her.* * You a-e indeed most enthusiastic, my lord,' (aid Blackth rn, with a amile."], [100, "92 EVELINA, THE PAUPER'S CHILD; which case, not only would his disappointment be almost insupportable, but the other conse quences would be most dangerous and disagree able to him. Should Evelina be made acquainted with the author of the brutal outrage, the expo sure he would meet with vould be overwhelm ing, and would render all his future plans abor tive. The bare idea filled the depressed noble man with terror, and he continued to pace the apartment in a state of the utmost disorder. unexpected delay, something seems to assure me that all will be right. If the fellows perform their task well, I will so remunerate them that I will secure their future hearts' co-operation in anything I may require of them, and ensure their fidelity.' These thoughts tranqulllised his feelings, and after a short time he succeeded ln falling asleep. Notwithstanding all that Blackthorn had Bald to his lordship, he could not divest his mind of certain misgivings as to the success of the scheme ; not that he doubted for a moment the fidelity of Joe Elsby and bis companions, for they had had so many guilty transactions toge- ther that they knew each other well, and Black- thorn was convinced that the prospect of the reward would urge them to exert themselves to the utmost of their power ; but he apprehended some accident, by which they might be defeated, and Evelina restored to liberty; and lf such were to be the esse, he had reason to dread the worst consequences, for it would probably then become known that he was the author of the villanoua plot, and he would not only meet with present punishment, but all his future hopes and pros- pects would be annihilated. Those thoughts filled the bosom of the villain with much uneasi- ness, which was rather increased than dimin- ished, when on his arrival at the tavern he found that tbe men bad not yet returned, and as the hour was getting late, it did not appear very likely that they would get back that night.\u2014 ' And yet I so particularly enjoined them to lose no time in returning, as soon as they had placed their fair charge ia security at Sarnscombe,' said. Blackthorn to himself; ' and they must be fully aware that myself and his lordship would be in the greatest state of suspense, until we were made acquainted wi h tho result of their expedi tion. I begin to fear that all is not right. And yet, what can have happened 1 The girl would probably remain in a state of torpor during tbe whole of the journey, and there was nothing at all calculated to excite suspicion about the ap pearance of the carriage. Psha ! I am bother ing myself with groundless fears, and a few hours will doubtless convince me tbat all has succeeded as well as we could wish.' 1 1 cannot get rid of these torturing forebod* ings,' he soliloquised ; ' notwithstanding all that Blackthorn has said, something tells me that the sanguine hopes I had at first formed are not destined to be realised, and that the girl will escape, to my shame, confusion, and dis appointment. By h ! I would rather sacri fice one half of my wealth than that such should be the case. I was a fool to bave her conveyed at present to such a distance, when she might have been brought here secretly, and no one could have had any suspicion. There are plenty of rooms ln this abbey where Bhe might have been safely concealed, and my own domes* tics would not have dared to betray me. I have acted very injudiciously in this matter after all. So impatient am I, that I could willingly start at once to Sarnscombe to set my doubts at rest; but in the meanrlme the men might return, and my abrupt departure might, as Blackthorn had observed, excite some suspicion. I must await the tedious hours with all the patience I can. Oh, Evelina, most beauteous damsel, I have fixed my mind on you, and could not brook the disappointment.' In this mood he continued ; but when hour after hour elapsed, and midnight had long flown, he gave himself up to despair, and formed the most painful conjectures. Concluding at last that Blackthorn would not visit him again that night, be reluctantly retired to bed, bnt his mind was too much disturbed to suffer him to sleep, and be lay tossing abou* in a state of the greatest agltaion, frequently giving vent to the most fearful maledlc .ions, as his feelings became too powerful for control. Sometimes he firmly believed that the men bad both deceived him and Blackthorn; and so powerful did that im pression at laBt become, than he could not con tain himself within the bounds of reason; and he ardently longed for the arrival of the morning, that he might hive his suspicions either confirmed or removed. Certainty would be far less torturing than suspense. 'Bnt the raecala would surely never dare to attempt to deceive me,' he said; 'especially when I promised to reward them so liberally for being faithful to me. They are outcasts from society ; marked men; and in seeking to betray me would only consign themselves _o the hands of justice. Besides they could not expect to make a better bargain. No\u2014 no ; I will endea vour to think as Blackthorn suggested; namely, that they have thought proper to rest themselves for awhile after their journey, and that they will not be able to arrive here till the morning. Had they been defeated in their plans, and the girl rescued from their power, we should doubt less have heard something of it before this. I will not give way to despair, for, in spite of this He endeavoured to compose himself with these thoughts, and succeeded muoh better than might have been expected. He had his glass replenished ; but, at length, it being one o'clock, and the landlord wishing to retire to rest, he con cluded that it was useless to wait any longer, as his colleagues would certainly not come then. He departed towards home, ln no very agreeable or sanguine state of mind. It is now time that we should return to cur heroine, as no doubt the cariosity ofthe reader Is greatly excited to kuow what was the result of her al .rming adventure. The carriage proceeded at the same rapid rate at wbich it had started from the hall, and by the moBt lonely route; but there waB very little occasion for that, as the poor girl was in no con dition to create any alarm, and as it was now getting late, there were very few persons about, in whom the appearance of the vehicle, being nothing out the ordinary way, excited no cu\u00bb rio.ity or suspicion."], [101, "OR, POVERTY, CRIME, AND SORROW. 93 The countenance of Eve'ina was paid but still her sleep appeared to he calm and sound, and It did not seem as though she would be likely to Buffer any material 111 effects from drug which had been administered to her. * She's sound enongh, at any rate,' said Joe. might have been imagined that her fair spirit had quitted its earthly tenement. In this manner, more than an hour and a half had elapsed since they had quitted the hall, and they had already proceeded a considerable way on their journey ; and the horses, although tbey had been driven at such a rapid pace, did not seem to be at all fatigued. 'Ay, answered his companion, ' and it Ib to he hoped she will keep so for some time; for, after all, the alarm she would he sure to create might be attended with danger.' They now entered upon a narrow and very little frequented road, and perceived lights, which they knew proceeded from a small inn, glimmering at no great distance before them. ' It is the Antelope, kept by old Will Emerson/ remarked Joe. ' The girl is all right enough. He has no occasion to know anythiog about her being with us (though I do not think he would blab if he did), and so we may as well stop there a few minutes to obtain some refreshment.' ' Oh, never fear, Jack,' said the former ; * tho dose she has had is evidently a strong one, and ahe will not arouie for some time. And if she should, what the devil have we to fear from a poor, weak girl r We could very soon silence her cries. My eyes, Jack, how surprised the young lady will be when she recovers her senses, and finds what has happened to her. No j b could have been managed more cleverly.' To this his companion very readily agreed and, calling to their associate, they told him to, stop at the house in question. In a few minutes they arrived at the inn, and Joe and his com panion alighted, entered the house, and left tbe insensible damsel in charge of the other ruffian. ' You are right, Joe; and if ahe only remains quiet and insensible till we get pretty near oor journey's end, we shall earn our reward easily enough.' ' We shall,' answered Elsby ; ' and I suppose his lordship will not be worse than his word V ' Certainly not ; Stephen Blackthorn will take good care of that. Besides, Lord Sidley would not dare to attempt to deceive us, as he might be certain that we would not fail to have revenge, and we should very soon turn the tables upon him.' Will Emerson, the landlord, who was a coarse, hard-featured ma i, seemed surprised at behold ing the fellows, whom he had known for several years, but he put no questions to them j neither did he know anything of the unfortunate damsel being In the carriage. Having procured such refreshment as they required, and cautioned the landlord to be ' mum,' if any pressing inquiries should be made after them, they again entered the vehicle, and resumed their dreary journey. ' Right \u2014 right, he's safe enough. I say, Jack, she's a fine looking wench, though.' ' Yes/ returned the other ; ' his lordship has no bad taste.' ' Indeed he has not, and I wonder Blackthorn did not secure her for himself.' 1 Oh, the girl did not take his fancy; in fact, she is hateful to him, being the ouly obstacle in his way to fortune. He is anxious to get rid of ber, and a better opportunity could not have presented itself than this offer of Lord Sid ley's to take her into his possession.' 4 Very good/ coincided the ruffian ; ' the loss of her will probably be the death of old Lang ston/ * I shouldn't wonder/ ' And then Blackthorn will lay hit hands upon tbe whole of his wealth.' ' As a matter of course ; and I shall expect him to pay us pretty handsomely, after we shall have rendered him such good service.' 1 Oh, leare him alone for that ; we bare always found him a trump, and he knows better than to offend us now. I fancy that this will turn out to be a very good job, take it altoge* ther/ * At any rate wa shall hare both Lord Sidley and Blackthorn in our power/ < We shall/ Thos the ruffians continued to converse, while the vehicle continued on its way with the utmost precipitation, dashing through the in tricate ma^.'s of the wood, and across a most dreary tract ofthe country, where the least sign of a human being or habitation could not be seen for miles. Our heroine remained in the sa re state of undisturbed torpidity, and but for the slight breathing tbat gently agitated her boiom, it Still Evelina remained la tho same state of utter unconsciousness, and it did not seem as if she were likely to recover for some time to come, and thus everything favoured the designs of the villains la whose power she was. The hour of midnight was fast approaching and all was dark and dismal around ; for the moon had long been obscured by dense clouds. which seemed to betoken a coming storm, not withstanding the evening had been so fair and promising. They had been for some time travelling through another wood, which seemed to be of considerable extent, when Joe and his companion were sur prised by the other ruffian suddenly stopping the carriage ; and looking from tbe vindow, they found themselves involved in almost impenetra\u00bb ble darkness, and nearly hemmed in by the tall trees which grew so thickly around. \u2022Why, what's tho matter now, Bilkers' de manded Joe Elsby, impatiently ; ' why do you not proceed ?' ' Blow me,' repHed Bilker, ' if I know how ; it is as dark as pitch, aud burn me if I have not missed the way, and have not the least idea in what part of the forest I am.' ' Confound it,' cried Elaby ; ' how could you have been ao foolish, Bilkers I thought you knew every inch of the grouid well.' ' And bo I do,' returned Bilker ; ' but it is so infernal dark tbat it is oot surprising I should misB my way.' ' Well, it is no use hesitating about the matter,' observed Jack Dagley ; ' you mat push"], [102, "94 EVELINA, THE PAUPER'S CHILD ; on as well as you can through the wood, and leave it to chance to set us in the right road. We cannot be far out of the right track.' Bilker growled an oath, and cracking his whip once more urged on the horses through the intricate mazss, but from the obitructions that were placed in his way, he waa only enabled to proceed at a very slow pace, and the horses frequently had a difficulty in keeping their feet, many miles from the hall ; that we may have taken the liberty of removing you from thence, while you were In a state of insensibility ; that you have been travelling in this vehicle for above these three hours, and in a very short time, I trust, we shall arrive at the place of ourdestina' tion.' It would be impossible to describe the look of horror which the appalled snd he jvlldered girl fixed upon the miscreant as he gavo utterance to those words; then she gave expression to another piercing cry, and overcome by the power of her emotions she sank back in the seat, aad for some moments almost relapsed into a state of insensibility. Bat she cast her eyes towards the carriage window, and perceiving the dismal scene they were then tr. veiling through, ber worst fears were confirmed, and bitterly she wrung her hands and wept, and for a few minutes her anguish was so great tbat she could not give utterance to a syllable. The ferocious looks of the men appalled her very soul, and she could see at once that she could not hope to make any impression of a favourable natuie upon ruffians who were doubtless hardened in every vice. At length they got into a more open part of the forest, and the heavy clouds having disper sed, the moon shone forth with all its former brilliincj , and showed them tho way clear before them. 'AU right,' said Bilker; 'I see where I am now.* He lashed his horses into Increased . r eed, and the vehicle was carried along with the utmost rapidity. ' Another couple of hours, I should think, will bring ue to the eud of our journey,' said Joe Elsby; 'if the horses do not become fatigued, and they keep up famously at present. Hollo; what's that?' Joe cast a hasty look of alarm towards our heroine as he spoke, for a deep sigh had escaped her besom, and she muttered some incoherent words as if she were dreaming. 4 Alas I alas T she groaned, 'what could thus have steeped my senses in this death-like torpor ? Oh ! for the love of Heaven, tell me by whom are you employed ; for what purpose, and whither you are about to taae me? I have never injured you; I have never, to my know ledge, seen, you before ; why, theo, should you thus cruelly snatch me from my home and that venerable relttion who has so long been my pro tector, aod whose heart my loss will assuredly break 1 Oh ! pity me \u2014 spare me ; and do no keep me in this dreadful state of suspense.' ' You must wait patiently, when you will doubtlessly be made acquainted with all,' said Joe Elsby, 'it is not our place to do so, and therefore it is no use to question us.* 'Mercy! mercy I' shrieked our distracted heroine; ' consider my unprotected state, and release me, I implore you,' ' The girl ls about to awake, I'm afraid,' *\u2022 1 Joe ; ' she seems to have pretty well slept o's.

' Well,' returned his companion ; ' I do not see that ft is of much consequence if she does ; for we have her safe enough now, and it's no use her raising any a'arm when there is no one to listen to her.' ' Very true, but it would have saved us a deal of trouble if she had remained insensible till we had arrived at the place of our destination. Hash. Again Evelina sighed ; her frame then under went some slight emotion, and she planed her fair hands to her head, with some sensation of returning consciousness. She gradually opened her eyes, bnt her mind was confused, aud she gazed up n vacancy. 1 Yes, that is very likely, my girl,' sneered Jack, ' we shall be paid too well for our job not to perform it faithfully. You may as well be quiet, for you cannot escape from us, and it Is not probable that at this hour and in this place, any one will come to your assistance.' 'My head, how it aches,' she murmured; ' and I have had such a singular dream. But \u2014 but \u2014 it mu6t be time to rise and,' she uttered a piercing- scream of terror, for she felt the motion of the carriage, and her eyes at that moment rested on the forbidding countenances of the ruffians who were seated by her side. She started u;> hastily, and her whole frame trembled with astonishment and consternation, but still she could hardly persuade herself tbat she was not yet labouring under the effects of some frightful dream. 'Villains! my shouts shall rend the air,' ex claimed Evelina, with frantic gestures. ' Ob, help 1 help !' \u2022Pshaw I' ejaculated Joe; 'will you cease your cries, or we must take means to make you, that's all ? and remember that we are men who will not submit to be trifled with. Come, come; you will be quiet if you are wise, and no harm will come to you.' \u25a0 Be not alarmed young lady,\" said Joe ; ' but sit yourself down quietly, you are right enough.' ' Gracious Heaven,' again shrieked the unfor* tunate damsel, * what villanouB transaction is this? Where am If Where is my aged rela tive 1 Who are you, and whither are you con-/ veying me?' 'My God t my God 1' sobbed the wretched girl : ' can I endure this ? By whose orders am I thus seized, aud what are your dark designs against me?' ' I have before repeatedly t .Id you that la no use to question us,' said ElBby; ' but If it will Batisfy you any way to know, I do not mind in forming you that wo act by the orders of one who has rank, wealth, and power, and who it s not likely will be moved from the purpose on which he has fixed his mind.'

Never had her feelings been worked up to such a pitch of distraction since the night she had made her escape from the workhouse ; and even the certain prospect of a fearful death conld not have presented half the horror to her mind as did her present situation, and the uncertainty of the fate that was in store lor her. carriage window, and herreiolu'ion was strength ened. The three men wete all busily engaged with the horse, and with a silent but hasty step tbe poor girl bounded from the vehicle, and darting round to the back, she fled as fast as her limbs could carry her, her heart palpitating with min gled hopes and fears. ' Oh, Goa, my beloved uncle,' she cried, ' what has become of you? Oh, tell me, I earnestly supplicate you, it you have the least spark of pity left In your breasts, where is that aged man, and what dreadful outrage have you committed ln tearing me from him 1' 'Oh, the old fellow Ib safe enough, and at home in his bed, no doubt,' returned Elsby. 1 We did not molest nor disturb him, so you may make your mind easy on that point.' Poor Evelina could not make any reply, for her tears choked her utterance, and she threw her self back in her seat, and gave herself up entirely to the despair and horror of her feelings. The vehicle continued on Its way with un abated speed, but the dismal aspect of the country appeared unchanged, and the power of the wretched girl's emotions needs no descrip tion. The threatening and repulsive looks of the ruffians terrified her; and the loneliness of the hour, and the silence of all around, convinced her that her cries for help would indeed be entirely futile, for there was no one near to listen to her. In vain she tried to imagine who was tbe author of this Infamous and daring plot ; but it was quite evident that his intentions were of the most base description, and this strength ened her anguish and despair. And by what means the ruffians had accomplished their de signs she could not conceive, and by what means they had contrived to gain access to the hall, and to bear her away, was equally inexplicable to her. CHAPTER XVI. THE RESCUE. \u2014 THE RESTORATION. \u2014 RAGE AMD DISAPPOINTMENT. \u2014 WE8TBOORNE 6IBLEY. With breathless haste Evelina continued her flight, without venturing to look behind her, and trusting that Providence would assist her in eluding the vigilance of her enemies. She had not the slightest idea as to the part of the country in which she was, bnt could she only avoid them she hoped to he able to meet with some habitation \\-'i\u00abre she might find protection, and she therefore _ i on with a courage she did not think Bhe could have mustered on such an occasion, and under such peculiar and cheerless clroumBtances. She made her way with all the rapidity she could towards the entrance of a Wood, wbich she perceived at no great distance, and where she hoped to be able to conceal herself until Providence should send her some assist ance. It was Just at this critical juncture, tbat Elsby and his companions having succeeded in raising the horses, returned to the carriage, which, to their astonishment and contusion, they perceived was empty. 'Hell and furies I' cried Elsby, foaming with rage, and stamping passionately, * where is the girl? She has never dared to Ahi see, yonder she flies I She is making towards the wood, and if she gains it before we overtake her, she will escape. Quick, quick I Stop, girl! on your life !' And how dreadful would be the agony of her uncle at her loss, and that the probability that she would never be restored to him again, or at least, not till after she had become the victim of some hardened and inhuman villain. Her heart sickened at these thoughts, and she was reduced almost to a state ef frenzy. They rushed from the spot in quick pursuit of her, uttering curses all the way they pro ceeded. Evelina heard the threatening shouts of the ruffians, and terror added speed to her footsteps, and now she in her turn shrieked aloud for help, although at such an hour, and in such a spot, it seemed entirely hopeless. Nearer and nearer the ruffians approached her, and louder became their shouts and execra tions npon the air; but still the poor girl con tinued her flight, screaming for help as she rushed on. She was aroused from these reflections by the carriage undergoing a violent shock, as lf it were about being upset, and In a moment it was stop ped, and Elaby and his companion proceeded to inqnlre of Bilker the cause. It appeared that one of the horses had stum bled over something that had fallen across the road, and as Bilker could not raise the animal himself, Joe and Dagley went to assist him. Not dreaming that Evelina would have tbe courage to make any attempt to escape, tbey incautiously left the door of the carriage open, which caught our heroine's attention in a moment. It was one of the severest description of trials that Evelina had ever experienced, and as the ruffians had now so far gained upon her that she could even hear the sound of their footsteps on the ground, her heart sank within her, and she gave herself un for lost. But just at that instant, when it seemed impossible tbat the men could fail to overtake her, her cries were responded to by the voices of men, and immediately after wards three persons, mounted on horseback, emerged from the wood, and made towards ber. Evelina advanced a few paces further, when overpowered by her feelings, and her strength completely exhausted, she sank, fainting and The thought was a desperate and almost a hopeless one, situated as she was ; bat it imme diately occurred to her, and she determined to put It in practice, let whatever might be the con sequences. She cast one eager glance from the"], [104, "EVELINA, THE PAUPER'S CHILD. 96 vehicle, followed himself, giving his horse to t_\u00bb other servant, and they were driven off with th* greatest speed towards the nearest town. (Jreat waa the excitement which this unex pected event caused in the bosom of Westbourne Sidley, and he could not remove his eyes fiom the bsauteous and Innocent features of our heroine for an instant. Never before had ha beheld a being half so lovely, and his curiosity was greatly excited to know who she Wi\"S, and what had brought her into such a strange and dangerouB situation ; and yet he imagined that be had seen her before, but he could not re member where it was. He awaited her recovery with some impatience, that he might obtain from her an explanation, and assure her of her safety ; and he could not but be thankful to that provi dence which had sent him to her deliverance. They had not proceeded far, when our heroine gave some signs of returning sensibility, and immediately afterwards she opened her eyes, and fixed them, with astonishment and confusion, upon Westbourne Sidley. inseniible upon the ground. The travellers instantly rode up to her, and the foremost of them, _ ho was a handsome young man, of dig nified and commanding appearance, dismounted, and raising her in his arms, geaed in her pale but lovely face, with feeling of the deepest admiration and compassion. The young man who had so opportunely come to the protection and deliverance of Evelina, was no other than Westbourne Sidley, the son of the degraded nobleman, who was the cause of this inhuman outrage, and who with his two attendants was on his way, for particular rea sons, at that unseasonable hour, to the abbey, when the cries of the damsel assailed his ears. Westbourne still continued to gaze upon the features of Evelina with the most unbounded astonishment and delight ; but his attention was quickly diverted to the ruffians, who were ad vancing towards him, and he therefore with hia faithful attendants, prepared to protect the poor girl from their violence, fully determined to resign her only with his life. ' Follow me,' said Joe Elsby, to his colleagues, his eyes flashing with rage, when he beheld the position of Westbourne Sidley. ' By H 1 if we are not determined, the girl will escape now. On to these fellows and make them relln. quien. their prize I' ' Ab, where am 1 1\" she ejaculated ; ' and thole fearful men, what has become of them!' \u25a0 Pear not, miss,\" replied Westbourne, ' you are now perfectly safe. I have had the good fortune to rescue you from the power of tha ruffians who have taken to flight. I am merely now conveying you to a place of security, where you can remain until you are sufficiently re covered from your fright to be restored to your friends.' ' Stand back, scoundrels I' exclaimed West* bourne, when Joe and his companions had got to within a short distance of them.

Elsby uttered a dreadful oath, and Instantly followed his colleagues, plunging into tbe wood, and abandoning tha carriage in his confusion and dismay. 'Oh, sir,' ahe faltered out at length, 'how greatly am I indebted to you for my preservation from those terrible men, whose purpose, and by whom they were employed, I know not.

Evelina withdrew her face with some confu sion, and, notwithstanding his prepossessing appearance, she could not help feeling a sensa tion of regret at beholding in her preserver tha son of that man whom Bhe had so much reason to look upon with repugnance and suspicion.

The servants of Westbourne knocked and rang loudly, but for some time to no pur pose, for no one answered ; and they had began to fear that they should not gain admittance, when a man put his head out of a small window over the door, and apparently ha'.f-aaleep and haU-attake, and not In one of the moat egret able of temper) st being disturbed, Inquired what they wanted. no* i_"], [106, "OS EVELINA, THE PAUPER'S CHILD; Sidley answered the Interrogator from the carriage, and requested immediate accomodation, for which he should be handsomely rewarded. This promise, and the sight of the carriage, which he had not particularly noticed before, had a magical effect upon the man, and telling them he would be down directly, he drew in bio head. In two or three minutes the door was slowly opened, and the landlord appeared with an el- derly woman by his side, who no aoubt was his wife. Westbourne Sidley assisted our heroine to alight from the carriage, aud they were con- ducted by the host and hostess to a comfortable room, where Evelina sank on a seat much ex- hausted. Mr. Sidley immediately desired the landlady to bring some refreshment, but our .heroine declined partaking of any, and requested that she might be accommodated with a chamber for an hour or two, as she felt that rest was in- dispensible to her recovery from the evident shock her feelings had sustaired, and tl at not- withstanding, she was anxious to be restored to her dear uncle and her other friends, it would be impossible for her to encounter the fatigue of travelling until she had obtained it. ' But ob, sir,' she earnestly ejaculated, fixing a look of the most Impressive supplication upon Westbourne Sidley ; ' let me beg of you to fulfil the promise you eo kindly made to me, and ap.. prise my beloved guardian of my safety without delay. Already do I owe you muih, for the service you have rendered me, but how greatly will that savour increase the obligation.' Westbourne Sidley fixed upon her a glance of the most respectful sympathy and admiration, as he replied \u2014 ' Fair Evelina, I request that you will not disturb yourself respecting that ; but try to com- fort yourself. I will Instantly despatch my ser- vant to the hall, and a few hours will, doubtUts, relieve the dreadful suspense that must at pre- sent torture the minds of your friends.' Again most ardently and sincerely did our heroine return her acknowledgments, and having, at the request of Westbourne Sidley, hastily written a few lines to her uncle, to con- vince him that the messenger was not attempting to deceive him, they were given to the servant, and he was sent off without any further delay, and instructed to use al) the speed be could possibly make. Eveline now felt her mind relieved ol a great weight of anxiety, and the expression of her lovely countenance becoming less agitated, pre- sented additional charms to the imagination of Westbourne. Fain would he have detained her in conversation for hours, but perceiving how much she laboured under fatigue, he respectfully bade her farewell for the present, and she accompanied tbe landlady to a chamber. Westbourne Sidley continued to sit for some time after she had left him, meditating upon the adventure, ssd the incomparable charms of the innocent heroine of it, and the longer he did so, the more he found his interest and agitation increase. No one was more suscepti- ble to ihe beauties of the gentle sex then he was, but Evelina, he emsidered, surpassed in loveli- ness and modesty, and Innocence of demeanour, allthe damsels he had ever before seen; and when he reflected upon the manifold sorrows and persecutions she had experienced, his bosom was wrung with the tenderest emotions of pity. And could one so gentle, so virtuous, so every way intrinsically captivating, be the daughter of a felon 1 Oh, no, he thought it was utterly Im- possible ; and the more he thought of all the melancholy circumstances connected with hei his- tory the mere convinced he became that Richard ' Marsden could never have been gnilty of the dreadful ciime of which he had been convicted, and for which he was now receiving an igno- minious punishment. And should he cast any opprobrium upon that poor girl, because of that convictions Perish the thought! He should despise himself if be could. But there was another thought which caused Westbourne the greatest anguish of mind, and tbat was the manner in which the fortunes of Richard Msrsden were connected with his father. He felt too well satisfied that Lord Sidley was enjoying that fortune which belonged to Mars- den and his daughter, and he frequently had his doubts as to whether or not possession of it had been honestly or surreptitiously obtained. How, theja, in spite of the service which it had been his good fortune to render her, could Eve'.ina look upon him as the son of the usurper of her rights, with any other feelings than those of suspicion and repugnance t These thoughts greatly tortured the amiable Westbourne Sidley, and he would have given anything could he but have removed the cause. But what would have been his agoay and disgust, had he been aware that his father was the guilty instigator of the outrage which had been perpetrated against the beauteous object of bis solicitude ; and that ha was even then nursing himself with the idea of her shortly becomiog the victim of his brutal passion ? But Westbourne was not ignorant of his father's vices, and bitterly did he deplore them, and pray to Heaven to banish his evil propensities, which bad brought disgrace upon his name, and had already been productive of so much misery to many innocent individuals. Having given strict injunctions to the land- lord not to Batissy any inquiries which might be made as to the arrival of himself and our heroine at the inn, and ordered that every attention should be paid to the poor girl, Westboorne also, after partaking of some refreshment, retired to a chamber, in order that he might obtain some rest, and so prepare himself for the journey. Evelina, when she entered the loom which was aliottsd so her use, during the short time she was to remain at the inn,- knelt down, and with the most heartfelt emotions of gratitude, poured forth her thanks to the Most High for her preservation, and fervently she prayed that her aged uncle might be enabled to bear the shock of her disappearance with fortitude. Towards Westbourne Sidley the poor girl felt the most lively sensations of gratitude, and when she recalled to her mind his amiable aud respectful demeanour, she could not but deeply regret that he should be the son of that man from whom she had every reason to date tbe rain of her unfortunate parents, and whose vicious propensities were so notorious The"], [107, "OR, POVERT., CRIME, AND SORROW. 99 I manly and handsome features of young Sidley had made the deepest impression on her, and Ihe could not help blushing, when she found how vividly they were f resented to her mind's eye. before. He was pleased, however, that the beauteous object of his thoughts was much better, and that she waa wrapped in a calm and refresh ing Bleep, and the doctor gave it as his opinion that there would be no necessity for her to delay her joumey auy longer than the morning. We must now once more return to Stephen Blackthorn, who, on leaving the tavern where he always met his infamouB colleagues, hastened home, and retired to hia chamber in no very agreeable state of mind, for he was vexed and disappointed at the continued absence of the villains, and he had some torturing misgivings that the plot had not succeeded so well as he had anticipated, and should Evelina be rescued from their power, it might lead to the defeat of all future schemes. But still, on more mature consideration, he could not see how it could happen, and he endeavoured to await with pa tience the result. She continued wrapped in theie reflections for some minutes, but at length, tired and sleepy, she threw herself on the bed, and sought that repoio of which she so much stood in need, after the unusual fatigue and excite* ment ahe had undergone, and which in a very short time came to her relief. Three hours or more elapsed in this manner, when Westbourne Sidley arose and despatched a female servant to the chamber of Evelina, to inquire how she was. The answer he received filled him with considerable grief and alarm. Evelina felt so poorly that she found it impos sible to leave her bed, notwithstanding the pain ful anxiety she waa under to return home ; bnt she requested that Sidley would not put himself to the inconvenience of delaying his departure from the inn on her account. At last, tired of thinking, Blackthorn fell asleep, but how long he had been so he knew not, when he was suddenly aroused by a loud knocking at the door. The darkness of the night had not yet disappeared, and Blackthorn throwing up the window, and putting his head out, conld only very indistinctly catch a glimpse of the figures of two or three persons standing below, and he hastily demanded who they were and what they wanted. This, however, Westbourne could not listen to with any degree of patience, and he returned an answer to that effect, at the same time assuring our heroine that his business was not so urgent as to make the delay of any consequence. He also sent for a medical man, who after having visited Evelina, declared that she was merely suffering from fatigue and over excite ment, hut that it would not be possible for her to venture to travel till the following day, at the earliest. -\u2022- This was a great trial to the patience of Evelina, who waa well aware of (he dreadful state of sus pence her ancle and her other fiiends would be in, although they would, in the meantime, he assured of her safety ; but she was compeUed to submit to it, and endeavoured to sleep the inter vening hours away, in order that it might restore her, and render any farther delay unneces sary. ' Quick, open the door, Blackthorn ; we have much to toil you/ answered one of the men. ' Ah I' exclaimed Blackthorn, with mingled feelings of pleasure aud area ., as he recognized the voice of Joe Elsby. 1 Yon have come at last then _ A pretty state of suspense yon have kept me and his lordship in, by beiug abient so long ; but wait a moment and I will admit you/ Hastily he struck a light as he spoke, and slipping on a morning gown he hurried below, in a state of great trepidation. He unbolted the door, and the men walking into the parlour, seated themselves without any further cere' mony. Westbourne Sidley passed that tedious day in the greatest uneasiness of mind, for not only waa he anxious about the health of Evelina, but most impatient once more to have the happiness of ber society, and to contemplate those transcen dent charms which had so completely ravished bis senses at the first sight. He could not but flatter himself with the idea that this adventure would prove the introduction ot him to hsr friend ship, and could he but gain the esteem of that fair and gentle being, he thought that he should experience grester happiness than had ever yet fallen to hia lot. Her features were stamped as vividly upon his imagination as if she stood be fore him, and all that was lovely in creation appeared to his sanguine ideas to be concentrated in them. To win the regard of one so fair and innocent would indeed be bliss inestimable, and how blessed that man then would be who could create a sentiment of a more tender description in her bosom. Westbourne Sidley sighed deeply as these thoughts occurred to him, and sensations of a different character to any which he had ever before known, gained possession of his breast. He walked a short distance from the inn, with the hope of being able to compose himself, but he returned in a state of greater agitation than Blackthorn held the lamp above his head, and examined their features narrowly and impa tiently, and perceiving Elsby's arm bound up in a sling, he eagerly demanded \u2014 1 Why, how's this . What's the matter with your arm . ' I am wounded/ waa the answer. ' Wounded V ' Yes, shots ' Ah I there Is something wrong then.

' She has escaped 1' ' Hell and destruction 1' furiously cried Stephen ; ' do you speak the truth I' ' What's the use of my telling a lie f returned Joe Elsby ; ' she has been rescued from our power.'

' Ily all my hopes this disappointment will drive me mad, I think,' said Blackthorn, biting his lips, and frowning dreadfully. 'Come, Blackthorn,' observed ElBby, 'It Is no use talking in that manner ; what's done cannot be helped, and though the girl is rescued now, another time she may not be eo fortunate.' ' She and her friends will be on their guard in \u2022Cowarisl' repested Elsby, with a frown; ' nay, Stephen Blackthorn, you are rather too hasty there ; we do not deserve that title any more than you do.

But tell me who has done this V future, and prevent the execution of my plans.' ' Old Langston cannot live for ever.

Bat we need eome refreshment, for we have had a few most weary hoars of it, I can tell you.* 'D\u2014 n! the thought maddens me. But how did it happen ?' 'I will tell yon, if you will only have a little patience.' 'Quick, quick, then!' Joe Elsby then proceeded to relate all that had taken place, to which Blackthorn listened with feelings of the mon uncontrollable rage and disappointment ; and when he had concluded, he once more started from his chair, and paced tbe room with disordered footsteps, and giving vent to the most horrible maledictions. * You had better not remain here/ said Black thorn, after he had pointed to a decanter of brandy wbich was standing on a lide* beard in the room ; \u2022 the neighbours will be stirring pre sently, and should they see you leave the house, it might create their suspicions, and lead to no very pleasant discovery/ 1 Why, that is true to be sare/ coincided Eleby ; * what would you have us do then V 1 Why, hasten to the house of meeting/ answered Blackthorn ; ' and I will join you, after I have seen Lord Sidley, and made him acquain* ted with these disagreeable particulars.' 1 And so/ he said, ' you snfiered yourselves to be defeated by three men ?' 'They were more than a match for as, espe cially after I was wounded/ returned Joe Elsby ; ' and I could not help thinking that \u2022discretion was the better part of valour.' ' Now by the infernal host/ ejaculated Black thorn, ' this disappointment is insupportable. How can I ever make Lord Sidley acquainted with it ? and the girl whom I had hoped I had got rid of altogether will be restored to annoy me, and probably to destroy my future In tentions.' ' Very well,' returned Elsby ; ' but of coarse you will represent it in the best light you can to his lordship V * I am afraid I shall have a difficulty in persuading him that you have acted in this matter with the ability and determination he was led to expect. ' We should have acted more imprudently had we suffered ourselves to have been apprehended, wbich might have lead to a discovery of all.' ' Why, it is very vexatious to he sure/ re. marked Joe Elsby, ' but still I think you muat admit that it is no fault of mine, or my com panions.

' You did not see, then, whither her preserver conveyed her V \u25a0 Not longer than I can help/ replied Black thorn ; and Elsby and his companions then quitted the house. ' Certainly not/ When they were gone, Blackthorn gave free indulgence to his rage, and uttered curses, loud and deep, against the individual, whoever he was, who had rescued Evelina, and thus dis appointed those guilty hopes he had so warmly entertained. ' And what sort of a man was he ?' ' Young, handsome, and of noble bearing/ ' You would know him again V * Yee/ * May the fiends of hell pursue him I' cried the Infuriated Blackthorn. \u2022So I say,' returned Elsby; ' If it le only for (he wound he has inflicted on me.' * Aod she will be restored to her home/ he muttered, ' and for a time triumph over the defeat of her secret enemies.

And how do I know that they have not betrayed me I and if such is the case, my shame and disgrace must inevitably follow/ He was compelled to wait for an hour or two, because it was yet too early to visit the abbey; but at length, revolving in his mind how he should open the unpleasant business to his lord* ship, he depaited. 1 No, my lord/ said Blackthorn ; ' there is no fear of their having done that, or they would never again have ventured to show themselves to me. I tell you, as I have told you all along, that I can place the most Implicit confidence in their fidelity, and though they have failed now, I do not doubt but that they will succeed another time.' Lord Sidley had been unable to sleep, for mingled doubts and fears disturbed his mind, and at an early hour he left his chamber, and before any other portion of the family were stirring he quitted the mansion, and rambled through the adjacent fields, burled in profound thought. ' I do not half like this delay of the fellows,' he soliloquised; ' and notwithstanding all that Blackthorn has said to me to the contrary, it strikes me that he also had some apprehensions that the plot will not succeed so well as we at first were led to anticipate. And should the girl escape this time she will be put on ber guard, aud render all ourfature schemes abortive.

But still the girl is too lovely to resign, and is worth mnnlrj g almost any risk to become possessed of. She must be mine, even at all hazards.' Lord Sidley bit his lips, and his rage and dis* appointment rather increased than abated. ' And who can this officious individual be to whom the girl is indebted for her deliverance?' he said. ' That, no doubt, we shall shortly discover, my lord,' answered Blackthorn. ' Let him beware, for most assuredly will I visit him with my deadliest vengeance. Oh, this defeat is wormwood to my feelings.' ' And you msy be certain that my rage and disappointment are equal to your own, my lord, considering bow hatefnl the girl is to me. But although she has escaped this time, I will Invent some other scheme by which she will be certain to fall into your lordship's power.' ' I must possets her at every risk, Black. thorn.' He was aroused from these reflections by hearing his name repeated, and looking up with some surprise and satisfaction, he beheld Black. thorn. 'And you shall, my lord, depend on it. I give you my word for it, and will not break it.' ' Had I not been a fool,' said is lordship, after a pause, ' thiB would not have happened.'

He little expected the surprise and vexatioir which were in store for him. ' She shall not, Blackthorn,' said the guilty woman, vith a fiendish look, ' and this fellow who has dared to interfere to save her, he shall not escape our vengeance.'

Blackthorn soon arrived at the hall, and in' quiring after Mr. Langston, was Informed that he was still in a most deplorable state, and that the doctor was obliged to he in constant attend ance upon him. After some further conversation, tbe two woi* thiea parted : and Blackthorn, who had deter* mined to continue for some time at the hall, to hear whether any intelligence waa received of Evelina, hastened to the chamber of the sick man, where, as Mis. Snacks bad Informed him, be found the doctor and Mrs. Selborn in atten dance upon him. The hypocrite inquired, with. much apparent solicitude, how he was, and the doctor shook his head in a significant manner, which afforded Blackthorn no small satisfaction, as he was in hopes that, even though Evelina should be restored to him, hia system had received such a shock, in consequence of het abduction, that he would never recover from it, and then he felt convinced that he could carry out bis diabolical schemes of villany without tlie least fear of detection. Indeed there was nothing he was not prepared to do, even to the shedding of human blood, to accomplish his wishes. ' Would that he had breathed his last,' mut tered Blackthorn, as he passed on to the apartments of Mrs. Snacks, who had opened the door to him, and who saw, by the gloomy aspect of his countenance, that something to vex him had happened. ' Would that he had breathed his last,' he repeated ; ' then I should bave nothing to fear.' He entered the room with the housekeeper, and closed the door. ' Who is with the old man ?' he inquired. ' Only the doctor and Mrs. Selborn, who have never left him the whole night,' answered Mrs. Snacks. \u25a0 And have you not received any news V asksd Blackthorn. ' No,' said Mrs. Snacks ; ' but you have, I suspect, Stephen, and lf I may judge from the expression of your countenance, not of a very pleasant description.' Mrs. Selborn could not help viewing Black* thorn with a feeling of dread and repugnance, for she thougbt she beheld miscreant and hypo crite stamped upon hie features, and she waa confident, from certain h intB which he had ' You are right/ Our present scheme is a failure.' 1 The devil it is,' said the housekeeper, hastily."], [111, "OR, POVERTY, CRIME, AND SORROW. 103 Inadvertently dropped, that he bore her and her family no good will ; but still sbe had not the least suspicion that he could have had anything to do with the abduction of our heroine, not wltBtanding that she was aware that he must view the damsel with feelings of jealousy, and as an obstacle to the fall accomplishment cf his avaricious views. Mr. Langston seemed much impressed with the attention which Blackthorn seemed to pay to him, and the anxiety he evinced for his recovery ; and all those prejudices which he had lately began to encourage towards him were banished from his breast, and the deluded old gentleman even began to fear that he had done him injus tice. Poor old Langston looked fearfully bad, but he was perfectly sensible \u2014 sensible to the dreadful calamity that had befallen him, and therefore he felt it the more acutely. ' Oh, may the vengeance of the Most High,' he ejaculated, ' addressing himself to Blackthorn, as he stood by hia bed side ; ' may the vengeance of the Most High overtake the wretches who have done this inhuman deed, and deprived me, in my declining days, of all that I held dear on earth. Beloved, affectionate, suffering, innocent Evelina, whose gentle spirit shed consolation upon my conscience-stricken soul, I shall never behold you again ; you are lost to me for ever, and the sooner that death terminates my misery the better.' Towards the middle of the day, when the patience of Mr. Langston was almost exhausted, and they had the greatest difficulty In keeping him in bed, they were all startled by a loud knocking at the ball door, and a minute or two afterwards, Mrs. Snacks entered the room ln breathless haste, with a letter in her hand. Sbe and Blackthorn hastily exchanged glances to gether, and they immediately understood each other. ' She is found I \u2014 the dear young lady is rescued,' she cried. Mr. Langston started up wildly In the bed, and fixed a stern look of inquiry upon the house keeper. ' Woman!' he exclaimed, 'have you come here to mock me ? Beware ! beware I' ' Nay, sir,' said Stephen, with well-assumed anxiety and compassion, ' you must not give way to despair. Alarming as the mysterious dissppearance of Miss Marsden ls, Providence may interfere sooner than you expect, to rescue her from the power of those who have stolen her from you. Rest assured that every effort ls being made to that purpose, and I have the strongest bopes that such exertions will be crowned with success.' ' Mock you, sir ?' repeated Mrs. Snacks ; ' dear gracious me, how can yon think that I shonld wish to do to ? A man is below, who has rode post haste all the way from the place where he says the young lady aud her preserver were stay ing when he left them, and he brings this letter to you, which, probably, will convince you.' Mr. Langston snatched the letter from her with a trembling hand, and his eyes bad no sooner fallen upon the superscription, than he ex claimed \u2014 ' You entertain those hopes, Stephen V said the old man with emphasis, and fixing upon Blackthorn a peculiar look. ' Ah, gracious Heiven I they are \u2014 they are the well .known characters of my beloved child 1' 'Yes, I have, sir/ returned Blackthorn; 'surely you cannot doubt that I am sincere in ray assertions V Blackthorn and the others looked on with anxiety and impatience, while tbe old man hastily broke tbe seal, and glanced over the con tents of the epistle. 'No, no,' said Mr. Langston, extending his hand to tbe villain ; ' I \u2014 I do not doubt you, Stephen. Pardon me if I have appeared to do bo, but grief distracts me, and I scarcely know what I say. Oh, I had flattered myself with such a bright prospect of the future, which this dreadful and unexpected blow has at once destroyed. Poor girl, poor girl, was it not enough that she should suffer such unparalleled and undeserving cruelties, during the dreary years of her childhood, but that Bhe must now be consigned to a fate probably worse than all V Blackthorn could not help muttering a secret curse to himself, and turned away to conceal his emotion. To think that he should be foiled in this his first attempt was torture almost insup 1 portable, and every word tbat old Paul Langston had given utterance to was poison to his-ears and feelings, for he pictured to himself the change he would shortly experience, from the most abject despair to joy on the restoration of his niece. 'Almighty God, I thank you for this I1 he cried. ' She is saved ! My beloved Evelina will be restored to me, and\u2014 \u2014 ' He oould not finish the sentence ; bis feelings overpowered him, and he sank back Insensible upon the bed. * Heaven be praised for this !' exclaimed Mrs. Selborn emphatically; 'the poor girl Ib saved, and her affectionate relative will be rescued from untimely death.' Blackthorn bit his lips; but eagerly picked up the letter which Mr. Langston had dropped on the bed, and glanced at the contents. Need we describe his astonishment and rage at what he there read 1 He could scarce refrain from giving utterance to an oath. ' Wonderful I torturing I' he was about to add, but be checked himself, and said, ' this is, indeed, a most fortunate and remarkable circumstance. You and this gentleman will probably see to the recovery of Mr. Langston, Mrs. Selborn ; I will return shortly.\" Hour after hour elasped, and Blackthorn did not quit the chamber of the suffering old man, whom he was very well pleased to perceive grew every moment worse, and he was not without hope that the shock his system had received by the loss of Evelina would be attended with the results he wished, notwithstanding the certainty of her speedy restoration to him. Thus Baying, he abruptly quitted the room, Mrs. Snacks having preceded him, as she was anxious to hear all the particulars ' And who, think you, Ib the preserver of the girl 7' he asked, when they had got down the stairs."], [112, "EVELINA, THE PAUPER'S CHILD. 104 heart ; this news is torturing ; and the mot insurmountable difficulties are likely lo arise from this adventure.'

'I tell you it is true!' ' Then, may lightnings blast him I cried tbe brutal woman, and her countenance assumed an expression which it was perlectly revolting to contemp'ate. ... ... ' Ay, bo I say,' remaiked Blackthorn ; but I have no time to talk to you on the subject now. I must hasten to tbe abbey, and make his lordship acqnainted with it. What will be his astonishment and rage when he comes to hear it ! By what strange accident could this have been brought about V Before Mrs. Snacks could make any reply. Blackthorn darted from the hall, and made his way towards the abbey. ' Now, by all the infernal host !' he growled to himself, as he proceeded, ' this is intelligence which I never expected to hear.

This must be pievented, and Lord Sidley has the power to do so.' He hurried on bis way as he uttered these words, and very shortly arrived at the abbey, and was shown into the presence of his lordship, who was most anxiously awaiting to receive him, and to hear what further particulars he had to relate to him. ' But surely, my lord,' said Blackthorn, 'you have it in your power to prevent thoBe difficulties you apprehend V \u2022 I know not that,' replied Lord Sidley ; ' but at any rate, I must pretend to praise Westbourne for that which so excites my rage and disappoint ment. There has been a spell upon this pro ceeding altogether. There is everything to vex, torture, and perplex me.' ' Calm yourself, my lord,' said Stephen, \u2022 the girl shall yet be yours, in spite of the protection she may receive from your son.' ' Ay, you say so,' answered his lordship, with a doubtful shake ofthe head. ' And I will pledge my life for the fulS'ment of my promise. Oh, we must net give w_y to despair, because we have happened to faii (his time. I have never yet suffered myself to be daunted at such trifles, and I am not going to do so now, especially when I have got so much at stake.' ' Well, I do believe you are a determined fel low, and shall depend upon you entirely, Black. thorn.' 1 And you will have no cause to repent of your confidence, my lord.' ' I would have sacrificed any money sooner than this should have happened.' ' No doubt of it ; but as it cannot bs helped, we must make the best of it. Your \u2022ox* will, of course, never have the least suspicion that the abduction of Evelina Marsden took place, through your means.' 'Certainly not, that is not likely,' said his lordship. ' Now, then, Blackthorn/ he said on his en trance, 'your looks bespeak something of impor tarce. Hae Evelina arrived at Mie hall yet?' '.No, my lord,' answered Stephen, * but a messenger has arrived, bringing a communica tion from her.' ' And therefore, after all, if we only act with proper precaut on, he cannot present any ma e rial obstacle to the accomplishment of our wishes.' ' No, but it enrages me to think that he should be the means ofretculng the girl from my pjwer. However, I will adopt some course to prevent any annoyatice from him, and to crush any hopes that tbe beauty and intrinsic accomplishments of Evelina may create in his breast. I have already secured an alliance for him, with a lady of wealth. To be sure, she i3 old enoug'a to be his mother, aud cannot boast of any great per sonal attractions, so that I cannot expect he will be very favourable to the match, but it is my will, and I do not think he will venture to act ia disobedience to it; if be docs, I shall kuow how to deal with him.' 'Ah!' ejaculated Lord Sidley, 'then it is known who is the person who rescued her ?' ' It is.' 'A:d who la he?' 1 Your lordship will, no doubt, be astonished and incredulous.' ( Do not keep me in suspense, Blackthorn. Who is the cslicious fool V ' Your own son, my lord.' Lord Sidley started with amazement, Indeed, when he heard this, and grasped the arm of Blackthorn.

Blackthorn then, after enjoining his lordship to prepare him self to meet his son in a manner bo as not to cause the le. st doubt or suspicion in hiB breast, and buoying him up with the hope that he would speedily invent same other stratagem that would be certhi i of meeting with success, took his leave, and once more departed to the hall, to I await the arrival of Westbourne Sidley, and his fair charge. ' No,' answered Lird Sidley ; ' and I must see tha owner of it, and make him some compensa tion for its Iobs, foi it will not do for him to lay any claim to it,' ' Certainly not, for that would betray all.' At this moment a servant entered, and in formed hia lordship ofthe arrival ofthe atten. dant of Westbourne Sidley, and he was immedi ately ordered into his presence.

The day passed tediously away, and when night arrived, and still Evelina and her preserver came not, the most unaccountable doubts and fears again began to take possession of the bosom of Mr. Langston, and it was as much as they all could do to pacify him In the least. He appre- hended that something else had happened to her on the road, and that he should yet be prevented from again beholding her. Nor were Mrs. Selborn and her daughter without their fears also ; but they struggled with them as well as they could, and concealed them from the observation of Mr. Langston, knowing that it would only serve to increase his agitation. his lordship; 'for Evelina would, of course, be most anxious to return home as quickly as pos sible, knowing the dreadful state of suspense that her uncle would be in.' ' I only wish that his suspense would be tho death of him,' said the villain Blackthorn. ' Our triumph would then be Immediate and certain.' ' Ar,' coincided Lord Sidley ; ' that would be as well, as I suppose you have matured your plans, so far as securing the old man's wealth. But still I am not satisfied about the girl. She must be too ill to remove from the inn.' ' And if such had been the case,' returned Stephen, ' I should bave thought that they would have lost no time ln forwarding intelligence of the same to the hall.' ' Very true ; I scarcely know what to think, said the nobleman. ' At any rate, Westbourne does not seem in any hurry to see his father ; I have no doubt that he is captivated with the charms of Evelina, and does not want to resign her society any sooner than he can help.' Blackthorn scarcely knew what to think, and he was in as great a state of suspense as the rest, but he only hoped, and that sincerely, too, that something of a fatal description would happen to our heroine on the road, so that she might be prevented from e . er annoying him again. ' Why, that is only natural, my lord, and he may make much of it now, for it will not be long that he will be permitted to enjoy it.' ' Would that he bad never Been her.' So great was the emotion of Mr. Langston that he could not be appeased at all, until a trust worthy messenger was despatched, on horseback, to the inn which Evelina had informed him in her letter they had stopped at, to ascertain all the particulars he could, and he was promised a handsome reward if bo used all possible expe dition. ' What, do you fear him, my lord V ' No, but he may cause me more trouble In the affair than T bargained for.' ' Oh, I will find a way to prevent that.' ' You promise me, Blackthorn ?'

The next game we play shall be a sure one.' ' I hope it may, or I shall begin to despair altogether. But you will have your work to do, Blackthorn; for after this ontrage, the friends of Evelina will be sure to keep a watchful eye over her.' The night passed away, and still no intelli gence arrived, and Mr. Langston now gave him self up to tbe most entire despair, and his suffer ijgs were, if possible, even greater than they bad been before, and he was deaf to every attempt at expostulation or consolation. Poor Helen Selborn gained but little sleep that night, and the sanguine hopes Bhe had suffered but a few hours since to obtain such an ascen dancy over her were now almost stifled lu her bosom. But still she could not help thinking, after some further reflection, it was wrong to entertain these apprehensions, after the assurance of Evelina's safety which had been received from herself ; end she trusted that Providence would protect her until she was restored once more to her home. From all that she bad heard of the character of Westboirne Sidley, she placed the utmost reliance on his honour and integrity, and tbat he would not rest until he had completed the good task be had begun. ' Let them,' replied Stephen ; ' but they must be watchful indeed to guard her from my power. Why dirt not the girl perish in the workhouse I' * That might have answered your purpose very well,' observed his lordship ; * bnt you will re collect tbat had she done so, I should have been deprived of the felicity I am now so anxious to obtain, and for which I am ready to make almost any sacrifice. Nay, this disappointment has but served to strengthen my desires.' But there was another fear which Helen could not so readily get rid of, and that was, that the ruffians from whose power Evelina had been rescued, might surprise them in greater number on the road, and if so, the most dreadful conse quences might be apprehended. ' I am glad to hear your lordship Bay so, for the certainty that your wishes remain unchanged, will render me more firm in my determination. I have no doubt after all that Evelina has only felt fatigued with the shock she has sustained and the fatigue she has undergone, and has been compelled to rest awhile. I have not much fear hut that Bhe will for a certainty arrive at the hall to-morrow.' This Idea Helen communicated to her parents, who could not deny the reasonableness of it, hut it was resolved not to mention it to Mr. Langston, since it might probably most unnecessarily, create his alarm, and increase the anguish he was al ready enduring. \" Well, I will endeavour to wait patiently till then,' said Lord Sidley ; ' and trust that I may not be again disappointed.

A small repast was also prepared on the table. ' Yes.\" ' They must keep themBelves concealed, for no donbt there will be a hue and cry after them, and should they be Been, they would most likely be regonised.* ' Leave them alone for using caution, my lord,' Bald Blackthorn; ' they are not so foolish as to run into a scrape of that kind, when there is no necessity for them doing so.' With these assurances his lordship was satis fied, and they again separated ; but the abandoned nobleman was far from being easy in his mind at the continued absence of Evelina, and he formed various conjectures upon the subject. Sidley greeted the lovely girl with the utmost respect, and expressed the pleasure he felt at seeing her look so much better. Our heroine replied to him with unaffected simplicity and modesty, while hsr heart, at the (ame time, bounded with the warmest feelings of gratitude and esteem towards that man who had rescued her from eo dreadful a fate, and who was now about to render her so invaluable a service. ' Should anything happen to her after all,' he said, as he paced his apartment, before retiring to test, ' I should never be able to endure the disappointment to my hopes. The longer I re flect upon the gentle beauties cf that all-en chanting damsel the more does the passion with which she has inspired me, increase in strength, and the more eager am I to obtain possession of her. Cursed ill-fortune it was that sent my son to her deliverance ; the debt of gratitude she owes to him will naturally engender feelings of a more tender nature in her bosom, and can Westbourne be Insensible to the power of her beauty ? It is Impossible I However, why should that trouble met he can never hope to possess her, and will not dare to encourage a passion to which he must be aware I would never give my sanction. Besides, if fortune does not again frown upon me, ere many weeks have elapsed, I will have her se curely in my power, and then n> triumph, and the annihilation of his hope?, if he presumes to form any, will bo certain. What would be his thought, did ho but know tbat it waB by the order of his own father, Evelina Marsden was torn from her home V At the earnest solicitation of Westbourne, Evelina partook slightly of the repast, and theu all the little arrangements being completed, he handed her to the carriage, took his seat by her side, and tbey departed from the inn. And now that tbey had commenced their journey, the heart of our heroine gradually became lighter, and her eyes brightened, adding increased lustre to hsr charms, which Westbourne could not help contemplating with the most un bounded admiration. Many persona smile at the idea of love at first sight, but when beauty intrinsically and personal, bo lucidly (it we may be permitted the word) present themselves to the observatioo, Ib it at all to be wondered that the affections should at once be enlisted in favour of the being who has engendered the feeling t Westbourne Sidley had an index to the mind of our heroine in her lovely countenance, which ho felt satisfied could not deceive him, and could he but win favour in that beauteous maiden's eyes, hls every hope, hia highest ambition, would be completely gratified. And similar were the thoughts which passed in the mind of Evelina. His candid manly conntenance, and tbe respectfulness of hie geneial demeanour, inspired her with confidence, and she received his attentions with a modest a_a* bility, that showed she felt aa much at her ease in his company as if they had been the acquain tances and companions of many years. Indeed the poor girl felt a sensation at her heart, which was entirely new to her, and whioh she could not understand. She lingered with delight and admiration upon every observation be uttered, and thought tha t he was certainly one of the most agreeable of his sex that Bhe had ever enoountered. Doubtless the gratitude natural upon the service he had rendered her, was one of the principal causes of this sentiment { but at the same time she felt a fluttering sensation at ber heart whenever he addressed her, which to those at all acquainted with, and experienced in the heart's secrets, could not have been mis construed. The hardened libertine smiled with a sort of fiendish triumph as these thougts occured to his depraved mind, and he became more resolute than ever in the accomplishment of his atrocious wishes at any risk. In the meantime Evelina passed a restless night at the inn, notwithstanding she had quite recovered from the fatigue and fright she had endured ; for she pictured to herself how anxious her aged uncle would be to clasp ber once more to his affectionate bosom, especially after he had been made acquainted with her deliverance from the power of the miscreants who had Beized her, and the terrible apprehensions that would torture his breast at her delay in returning home. He would imagine, probably, that she was dan gerously ill, or that Bhe had, by some means or other, again fallen into the hands of the vlllalnB, and that uncertainty would be equally as agonis ing as the first discovery ot her abduction had been. Again and again she prayed to Heaven to give him fortitude and patience to endure the delay, and tbat no other accident might occur, to retard her return to him, for that, she felt fully coBfldent, would prove fatal to him, if her mysterious disappearance had not done bo already. Westbourne Sidley, at our heroine's request, had given instructions for the carriage to be in Here then again was what is often spoken of with far too much levity and contempt, love at first sight. And it is not at all surprising that two minds so assimilated, formed together in the same noble and generoue mould, should so sud denly beeome attracted towards each other. Heaven had in virtues formed them so alike, that"], [116, "EVELINA, THE PAUPER'S CHILD; 108 ' It is strange,' said Westbourne i ' but eurely they could never have accomplished their Id* famous plot, unless tbey had some colleague Immediately concealed with tha household of yonr uncle.' It was Imposslb _ for their thoughts and wishes to be disunited. But amidst all this, sad reflections came over the mind of our heroine. Westbonrna was tho eon of that man she could not bnt look upon with repugnance, not only as tho usurper of tne rights of her unfortunate father, but also as tne general enemy of his fellow-creatures, the des- troyer of female Innocence ; and Westbourne, she thought, must view her with some degree of pre judice as the daughter of a supposed murderer. Under these circumstances she could not help feeling some degree of restraint in his company, which Westbourne, who seemed to, and probably did, read her thoughts, endeavoured by every means that he could at tbat time venture to make use of, to dissipate. ' There is no one at the hall but his house keeper,' returned Evelina, ' and I do not believe her to be capable of treachery. Besides, she haa ever behaved with the greatest kindneas and respect towards me since I have been at the hall.' ' It is most extraordinary how the men could have gained access to the house,' remarked Sid ley, ' and that yon should be wrapped in such a state of stupor aa not to be conscious of anything until after tbe lapse of several hours. It would almost appear that some stupifying drug had been administered to yon by some means or other.' ' Ob, who conld have been base enough to do that V eaid our heroine. How keenly did the amiable young man feel for the early and unparalleled sufferings of bis beauteous companion, with which particulars, although she was not aware of it, he vas thoroughly acquainted. Many times before be had seen her, and he reflected and sorrowed over them, and glaring was the picture tbat ho bad in hia mind drawn of her ; but how much more did she than realise it I He bad more than once mentioned the subject to bis father, hut the latter always affected to treat it with Indifference, and teemed to think her worthy of sympathy in con sequence of the crime with wblcb her unhappy and ill-fated parent was stigmatised. Bnt had this expression of prejudice any effect upon West bourne Sidlty 1 Yes, but it was to excite his greatest possible disgust, and to strengthen his commiseration for tbe poor orphan girl, who, whatever the fault! of her father might have been, ougkt certainly not, he considered, to be held ac countable or punished for them. Ho felt satlsled also, that his father had done Richard Marsden a serious Injury, and that he bad prejudiced his father against him, It ho had not absolutely been guilty of more dishonest prac tices, and he could not but consider tbat even if Marsden had erred, Lord Sidley had been tho In direct cause of it, by depriving him of his rights. Such were tho feelings that Wesboutne Sidley and Evelina had entertained towards each other ; but at they proceeded on their journey, their mutual embarrassment greatly diminished, and they entered more freely into conversation, Evelina, in tha most ardent terma, anticipating the delight and gratitude of ber uncle on ber restoration, and again with the greatest earnest' ness expressing her acknowledgments to West bourne for the service he had rendered he. With what delight he listened to her ; her voice was heavenly muilc, and again he assured her of the happiness he felt at having been made the humble instrument of saving her from, probably, the most horrible of fatet. ' But have you no Idea, Mitt Marsden,' he said, ' who hat been the originator of this des perate and brutal outrage t' \u25a0 Not tho least, I assure you, sir,' replied our heroine. ' I know not where to look for an enemy, unless it be those wretches from whom I experienced to many yeara of misery. The ruffians who bore me away, I do not remember to have ever seen before.' ' I know not ; but to say the least of it, It looks suspicious. Tha strictest inquiry should, and doubtless will, bo made Into all the circum stances, to guard yon against any future attemps.' ' I trust that Providence will not suffer my enemies, whoever tbey may be, to triumph,' said Evelina. ' I have never wilfully offended any one, and why then should they thus pursue me 1' ' True, Miss Marsden,' returned Westbourne, warmly, and fixing upon her a look of the most expressive description ; ' bnt beauty and in nocence are sure to meet with some oppressors.' These remarks, even respectfully as they were delivered, called the deepest blushes Into the cheeks ot Evelina, and she averted her face. A silence of some minutes ensued, and Sidley felt rather confused and fearful that he had presumed too much ; but they wera tbe feelings of his hesrt, and he could not holp giving utterance to them. Swiftly the carriage proceeded on its Journey, and the nearer it approached towards the place of Its destination, the higher the heart of Eve' Una became. But yet, in spite of the agreeable conversation of Westbourne, and the prospect of her so shortly being restored to her friends, the journey appeared to her a most tedious one, and she bad scarcely patience to bear the necessary stoppages they had to make to change horses, and procure refreshments, so great as sbe knew the suspense and anxiety of her beloved nncle would be, until they again met, even after he he had been assured of her safety, which ahe had no doubt he was by that time. The distance that she had been taken from tho hall waa much greater than she had anticipated, and tho day was far advanced before they ap* proached anywhere near the termination of their journey. Westbourne had extr ed himself to the utmost to compose her feelings, and although he succeeded much better than could have been anticipated, he had a most arduous task to perform. But as they drew near to the neigh bourhood In which the hall was aituated, and the scenery was familiar to her, the emotion of oar heroine Increased, and her feelings found vent in a copious flood of tears, which her companion did not offer to Interrupt, well knowing the source from wbich they flowed, and that they would bring her some relief."], [117, "OB, POVERTY, CRIME, AND SORROW. 100 And now the hall appeared In sight, and then the heart ot Evelina palpitated so violently against her side, that it seemed ready to bust from its tenement. Again she poured forth her gratitude to Heaven for her preservation, and by the looks she bestowed upon Westbourne Sidley, expressed much more than it would have been possible for her to hare done by words. Sidley had thought it prndent to despatch hia \u2022errant forward to the hall, to announce their approach, ao tbat Mr. Langston might not be taken too much by surprise, but might be prepared to meet them ; and be now exerted himself more than ever to tranquillise the feelings of Erelina. Tbey arrived at the ball; tbe gate was opened to them immediately, and the next moment they were driving along the avenue which led to the house. CHAPTER XVII. TOE MEETING.\u2014 THE INTERVIEW BETWEEN WESTBOURNE SIDLEY AND HIS F..TUER.\u2014 THE PR POSEI\u00bb ALI I AR CE. For some time before this, Mr. Langston had persisted in rUt' g from his bed, and waited for the ariiral of his niece in a state of mind which I Lie r_adtr may very well imagine, and which was almost insupportable. Nor was the anxiety of Stephen Blackthorn, who was present, and that of Helen and her mother, less intense. But when the servant of Westbourne arrived at the hall, and informed them of the approach of his master and her fair companion, the frantic emotions of Joy, yet half incredulity, which the old man experienced, were so great, that it was not without the greatest difficulty that he could be persuaded not to rush from the house, in order to meet tbe beloved being whom he had never expected to behold again, and to enfold her once more to his throbblg heart. He threw himself on his knees, and with clasped hands, while the big tears chased each other down his venerable cheeks, he poured forth his thanks to the Almighty, and inroked his choicest blessings on the head of Westbourne Sidley, Helen and her mother experienced the same feelings of transport and thanksgiving, but Black thorn bit his lips, and could with difficulty con ceal the dark though.s which were at that moment passing in his mind. Mentally he cursed both Evelina and her preserver, and wisbed them every misfortune that could possibly befal them. A few minutes afterwards, the vehicle was beard rumbling along at a rapid pace towards tbe house. Mr. Langston, and the others, with an exclamation of delight, hurried to the windows. They saw the carriage stop at the portal, tbe door was opened, they beheld West bourne Sidley alight, and then hand out the lovely object of their anxiety ; they heard light but hasty footsteps ascending the stairs. Mr. Langston could wait no longer; he rushed from the room, and the next moment he clasped the tender form of the Bobbing and almost insensible Erelina to his heart. The reader will not, we imagine, requue to be informed ofthe scene which followed, nor of the emotions evinced by our heroine, her uncle, Mn. Selborn, and her daughter. For some time, utter ance was denied them, and they could do nothing but weep like children npon each other's bosom, while Westbourne Sidtey stood by, and viewed the affecting scene with the deepest interest. As fox Stephen Blackthorn, be conteu. plated all that was passing with the most bitter malice, and had Sidley 'b attention been directed towards him, he must have observed the feelings that were passing in the ruffian's mind. Freely could Blackthorn, if he bad had tbe opportunity, at that moment have wreaked his vengeance upon his head. * My child\u2014 my beloved Evelina,1 at length ejaculated Mr. Langston, clasping het more fer vently to his bosom. 4 My dearest uncle,' sobbed forth our heroine, looking up in hie aged face with the most un bounded affection. \u25a0 Ob, the Joy of this meeting fully repays me for all the misery I hare suffered.' ' A od aie you, Indeed, restored to me uninjured, my poor girl?' said the old man, parting the silken hair from her forehead, and gazing into her lovely countenance, as if he conld scarcely trust the evidence of his eyes. ' God of heaven, receive my heartfelt thanks for this. The restoration of all f bold most dear on earth has rescued me from certain death.' Again he embraced Erelina, and gare free vent to his feelings, while his heart rose in gratitude to Heaven. At length our heroine gently dliengaged her self from Mr. Langston, and turned towards Helen and her mother, who were weeping tears of ardent joy. The manner in which they greeted each other folly showed the sincerity of the friendship that existed between them, and the happiness they experienced now that they were restored to each other. But suddenly Erelina seemed to recollect her self, and she turned her blushing face towards Westbourne Sidley. Her uncle followed the di rection ofher eyes, and he understood her thoughts in an instant. He advanced towards Sidley, and cordially taking his hand, Bald, \u2014 ' Pardon me, my dear sir, for my apparent inattention to you ; but the power of my feelings on the restoration of my poor child will, I trust, plead my excuse. How can I ever sufficiently express to you my thanks for your noble and disinterested conduct { In what manner can I possibly ever return the obligation you have conferred upon me by the preservation of one so dear to mer But if my sincere thanks \u2014 ' * I pray you do not mention it, sir,' Interrupted Westbourne, 'I am only too happy in having been sent by Froridence to the rescue of your fair niece, and in witnessing the happiness I hare thus by a fortunate accident been the means of conferring, X trust that Miss Marsden will be, in future, protected from the power of her secret enemies, and if I may he considered worthy of your friendship, I shall feel myself amply re warded for what I hare done.' 1 And most honoured shall I feel in ranking among my friends one who I am convinced is every way worthy of my esteem,' said Langston. Blackthorn again bit his lips, and was obliged"], [118, "EVELINA, THE PAUPER'S CHILD; 110 to walk to the other side of the room to conceal ' It ls involved in the most impenetrable mys \u25a0 i tery,' remarked Helen. ' But oh, Evelina, what ! might you not expect from such wretches who could perpetrate such a plot 1' ' True, Helen, and I shudder, even now, to think of the danger from which I have escaped.' ' And you are certain that you never saw the \"plains before, Evelina 1' asked Mr. Langston. ft Oh, quite, my dear uncle,' answered the I $_nael. ' Where is it likely that I could have i seen them V h:s rage. Some time elapsed in this manner, and all the parties most deeply interested gave free vent to their feelings ; and it was quite evident that no one felt more earnest joy than Westbourne Sidley. Frequently his eyes wandered to tbe beauteous countenance of Evelina. Two or three times their glances met, and it was manilest from the crim son blushes which suffused her cheeks, that hsr feelings were in unison with those of her hand some preserver. .__\u25a0 The conversation that * _>aa wt>s ut .flat agreeable nsture whish the occasion gave rise to, and Westbourne Sidley could have remained in their society for hours; but at length, fearful that he might appear Intrusive, and knowing tbat his father would be expecting him at the abbey, he arose to take his leave. ' True, my child. But do you think that you should know them again if you were to see them I' \u2022 Undoubtedly; I eould not help recognising them.' ' They must be detected, if possible, and brought to justice ; for I shall not consider that you are safe a moment, while they are at liberty V ' Their defeat on this occasion may deter them from making any further attempt,' returned Evelina. ' Will you permit me to call again, sir, to en quire after your health, and that of Miss Mars den V he said, in a faltering voice. ' I shall at any time be most happy to sse you, Mr. Sidley,' replied Langston, 'and I hope, therefore, you will make no scruple in visiting us as often as you feel disposed to do so. ' It will not do to make too sure of that, my child,' said her uncle. ' They are doubtless desperate villains, and not easily frightened from their purpose. Providence has preserved you this time, but should you again be taken from me, I eould never, never survive the calamity.' ' Ged will avert such an evil, my dear uncle,' said our heroine affectionately, ' for your sake.' This was indeed a day of happiness to Evelina and her friends, and when tiiey separated for the night, they did so with hearts lightened of care and anxiety, and with renewed hopes for the future. Sidley bowed, and Evelina conld not conceal the secret pleasure she felt at this cordial invita tion ; he then took his lesve, and Stephen Black thorn, whose mind was much disturbed by wbat had taken place, shortly afterwards followed his example. ' Noble youth,' said Mr. Langston, alluding to Westboume, ' from what a terrible bte has he probably saved you, my beloved Evelina ~_ owe him a debt of everlasting gratitude.' ' We do indeed, my dear uncle,' coincided our heroine, and her bosom throbbed with tbe most powerful emotion as she spoke, ' and his conduct convinces me that he is worthy of our warmest eBteem.' When our heroine found herself once more alone in her chamber, and recollected the dan gers she had escaped from, Bhe could no longer restrain her feelings, but sinking on her knees offered up a prayer of gratitude to the Father of Mercy. Nor did she forget her preserver, but invoked the greatest blessings upon his head, fervently hoping that he would be amply re warded for the service he had rendered her- She felt the greatest pleasure at the reception he had met with from her uncle, and could not help looking forward with impatience to the time when Bhe should beheld him again. ' Ah,' ejaculated Mr. Langston, 'how different is he to his father, whose character I believe to be all that is base and contemptible. And most extraordinary it is that you should be rescued by the son of that man from whom your ill-fated father might trace the whole of his misfortunes.' ' Alas I alas 1' sighed Kvelina, and tears started to her eyes oa the mention of her unfortunate parent's name. That night Westbourne Sidley haunted the imagination of Kvelina in her dreams, and when she awoke in the morning he was almost the first object in her thoughts. ' Tou are restored to me, Evelina,' said her uncle after a pause, and looking fondly in her face, ' and God grant that we may never be sepa rated again but by death, for it would eertainly break my heart. Heaven only knows how . .ave survived this terrible shock.' Westbourne Sidley, on leaving the hall, saun tered slowly on his way, burled in profound meditation, but Evelina was the fair being wbo occupied his thoughts beyond everything else, and caused him feelings of mingled pleasure and uueasiness. ' Thank the Almighty, who in His isAnlte mercy has given you strength to support it, my dear uncle,' ssid our heroine, fervently. ' Ob, when I recovered my senses, and found myself in the power of Ihe villains, never did I expect to behold you again.' The flattering invitation he had received from Mr. LangBton gratified him much, aud he deter mined to avail himself of it ; he also Imagined that Evelina bad evinced no less pleasure at tbe reception he had met with ; but when he reflected upon the unhappy position in which his father stood, as regarded the family of our heroine, and the prejudice which it was only natural hls aban doned character should create in her mind, he could not but feel the deepest melancholy and regret. But how much greater would have been ' Who can be the author of this atrocious out rage ? I am completely at a loss to conjecture.' ' There Is no one I know upon whom my sus* picions can possibly alight,' replied Evelina. ' Nor can I imagine by what means they could have gained admittance to the house, without being overheard and detected.*"], [119, "P0V1__T, CRIME, AND SORROW. 111 bis anguish, hia indignation, ud despair, hed he Vnown all I What would he not have suffered had he been aware that it was to gratify the base desires of Lord Vernon Sidley, his father, Evelina had been taken away from her home, and that he was still plotting the destruction of 1 er innocence, and only watched a fitting opportunl * feo-w ilete he work he bad secretly begun. \u2022*\u00a3 But Westbourne could not rec_> tne transmit dent beauties of Evelina to h .s memory, without feeling hia admiration increase, and he became impatient until he had. beheld her again.

His father bit his lips, and the former could uot help noticing Mb extraordi nary emotion with increased surprise. 'I sincerely hope,' added Westbourne Sidley, after a brief pause, * that the miscreant who is the author of this nefarious stratagem, may be de tected and brought to punishment. Tt seems evident to me that he ia eome wealthy libertine, whose mind exults in the destruction of female virtue, and in the misery of his fellow-erasures.' Notwithstanding all his efforts, Lord Sidley found it impossible to conceal his rage and con fusion at these observations of bis son, and it was two or three minutes before he could return any answer, bu* at length he said, with a bitter sneer \u2014 him happy. In this state of mind he arrived at the abbey, and Immediately sought the presence of hit fa ther, who received him with his usual coldness ; but If Sidley had watohed him narrowly, he might have observed an expression of indignation upon his eountenance, and also have perceived that he was making a powerful effort to conceal his real feelings, and to stifle the wrath whieh had taken possession of his bosom. ' So, Westbourne,' he remarked, with a sneer, 'you have turned knight-errant, I understand ; and at the hazard of your own life, have rescued this girl, this Evelina Mandan, from the power of ruffiani?' ' True, my lord/ replied his eon ; ' and mott happy am I to think that Providence led me that way in time to save one of the most gentle, the most amiable, and lovely of har sex.' 1 Indeed 1' said Lord Sidley, with increased sarcasm and indignation ; ' but hark ye, boy, you will act with prudence and wisdom, by avowing such quixotic achievement! for the future, \" Quixotic, my lord f ' \" Ay; such fool-hardy adventure! might k.n done very well for tho age of romance and chi valry ; but In the present age, they do appear, to say the leaat of them, rather preposterous.'

' Pardon me, my lord,' returned Westbourne, unable to conceal his resentment, 'but I must say Chat you appear to me to view this subjeot with a great deal too much levity.'

' Leave me, boy, and reflect maturely upon what I have said,' commanded the nobleman. ' I obey you, father,' returned Sidley, moving towards the door, ' hut no reflection can alter my determination.' He quitted the room at he spoke, and made hit way towards hia own apartment. CHAPTER XVIII. THE CONSUITATIONS OP VILtANY.\u2014 THE AS\" SAULT AND THE UNEXPECTED DISCOVERY. | Mrss Lucretia Norman waa the only daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Norman, who had both been dead about fire years ; since which time she had been residing with her uncle.

' And aay I take the liberty of inquiring, my lord, who the object It, to whom you are pleased to allude V \u2022 Miss Lucretia Norman,' replied Lord Sidley. Westbourne could not repress a smile, at he re plied,\u2014 ' Miss Lucretia Norman! well, she Is certainly, I believe, a very respectable lady, op the wrong side of forty, and I am prepared to treat her with evory respect, as your friend.' ' Respect, boy ; you must be prepared to love her, to look upon her as your future wife.' ' Pshaw 1 my dear sir, you really cannot be serious.' ' I am not accustomed to joke upon such sub jects, and you will find me most serious on tbit occasion. Miss Norman honours you with her affections ; her rank it noble, her wealth enor mous, and \u2014 ' ' And,' rejoined Westbourne, again smiling, ' would no doubt be very acceptable to some respectable old gentleman of her own tastes and habits ; as for myself, I am not inclined to pur chase wealth at the sacrifice of my happiness, and therefore, great as the honour probably is that Miss Norman intends me, I must take the liberty of declining it.'

Westbourne Sidley was at that time at one of the universities, so that they had nDt an opportunity of being intro duced to him, but that was reserved for a future occasion when the lady and her uncle were on a visit to the abbey. Westbourne had then re turned home, and hia extremely handsome per sonal appearance, and his elegant and agreeable manners, notwithstanding the great disparity of their ages, kindled that sentiment in Lucretia's breast which had for so many years lain dormant.

It happened, however, thataccidentintroduced MR. LANQSTON MEDITATES UPON THE PROBABLE FATE OF EVELINA. canuot say, but, strange as It was, and apparently unnatural at ber mature time of life, the passion daily gained ascendancy over her, and rendered her wretched, hopeless, and uneasy. The memory of Miss Norman, however, like most maiden ladles, was somewhat impaired as regarded her own age, and she bad learned to forget at least one half of the number of years that had passed over her head; consequently that delusion gave her some encouragement to hope that she might be able to make a favour able impression upon the object of her regard ; and which hope was greatly strengthened by the opinion sbe entertained of her own personal at. tractions, Independent of her other great attrac tion, namely, the wealth she possessed in such abundance. She, therefore, prolonged her visit to the fullest extreme, and endeavoured to make herself as agreeable as posslb.'e to Westbourne, who received her attentions with every polite* ness, but, of course, never lor an instant dreamt of their real purport ; and if he had, the know ledge would only have served him to laugh at as a most outrageous piece of absurdity. Lord Sidley, however, was r.ot bo blind. He had observed the impression which hia son had made upon Miss Norman's heart, bo long in vulnerable, with much astonishment and satis faction. Caring little about the future happiness of Westbourne, and looking only to the aggran disement of his family, he was disposed to look upon such an alliance as a most desirable one. _ _ 1 ."], [122, "EVELINA, THE PAUPER'S CHILD ; 114 ' Upon my word, my dear father, I cannot understand you.' \" If I am not mistaken,' said his lordship, ' Miss Norman has now a husband in her eye, or, at any rate, whom she would wish in her heart.

' And very old ; that is, according to my notions of a desirable young lady. But you must be mistaken, my lord; Miss Norman, I believe, possesses too much good sense to suffer such a ridiculous idea to enter her mind. Now, had she fixed her thoughts upon some such an old gentleman as the admiral, her uncle, there would have been something more reasonable ln it.' ' Bah I' exclaimed Lord Sidley, impatiently, ' you talk like an idiot, Westbourne. But mark me, you will find what I say is correct.' ' Then I can only say that I pity the sll'y woman,' retorted Westbourne. and was determined that it should be no fsult of his if it were not brought about. He, therefore, doubled his attentions to Miss Norman and her uncle, and took every oppor tunity of throwing his son in the lady's way. This was, however, by no means so pleasant to Westbourne, who began to think that the lady was rather more liberal of her smiles, and amorous allusions, than was at all consistent with her age, or the prudish character she had acquired, after so many years of celibacy. He found it, notwithstanding, impossible to excuse himself from her company ; and what annoyed him more than all was, that his father en* couraged it by every means in his power; but any idea of the thoughts which were passing in the lady's mind, never for an instant oc curred to him. Miss Norman and the admiral prolonged their visit for three weeks beyond the period they had at first intended; and when they left, they gave Lord and Lady Sidley, ana their son, a most pressing invitation to return the visit to Wlnchelby House, at the earliest opportunity ; and Miss Norman, as she was handed into the carriage by Westbourne, gave him a look which was meant to express volumes , but which made no other impression upon him than to create his wonder, and to excite feelings approaching to mirth in his breast. For the life of him, he could not help thinking her a most eccentric lady, and marvelled not that she had remained unmarried for so many years, taking her pecu liarities and personal pretentions into considera tion. A day or two after the admiral and his niece had quitted the abbey, Lord Sidley took an opportunity of eliciting his son's opinion of the iady, whish Westbourne gave in the moat unequivocal manner, and with a certain tone of levity and irony which was anything but pleasing to hia lordship. ' You ought to think yourself highly flattered.' ' And can you suppose for a moment, air,' said Westbourne, more seriously, ' that I could ever return or encourage so unnatural a passion ?' 'I do suppose bo,1 answered his lordship ; ' and what is more, I shall expect you to do it. Such alliances are not to be met with every day, and the lady's fortune ought amply to compen sate for what she may want ln youth and beauty. Westbourne Sidley could not help looking at his father with an expression of astonishment and disgust, and he scarcely knew how to answer. ' My lord,' he said, at length, ' you have com pletely amazed me by all you have said, but It ls necessary that I should as candidly express my feelings as you bave done. Once ior all, then, I solemnly declare that I will never unite my destiny to that of any woman upon whom I cannot bestow my heart, which It is not at (il likely Miss Norman can ever possess ; and I beg of you, therefore, if you should discover that your surmises are correct, which I oan scarcely believe they are, that you will not for a moment encou rage her hopes, which would bo cruel to her, and acting with injustice towards me. I have not yet seen the woman upon whom I could fix my affections, and certainly Miss Norman can never be that Individual.' ' Bnt, if you act wisely, I tell you,' remarked Lord Sidley, sternly, ' you will learn to tbink differently.' ' You are a giddy, inexperienoed young boy, Westbourne,' he remarked, ' or you would be ready to admit that Miss Norman is a very agreeable young lady, and ' ' Young lady, father 1' Interrupted the young man, smiling. ' Now, really, I must presume that you are yourself inclined to be facetious. I wonder, then, at what period people may reasonably be accounted middle-aged or old.' 'Bah I' ejaculated his father; 'you are too ready with your foolish Jokes. But I think you must admit that Miss Norman is a very accomplished, Intelligent, and amiable lady.' ' I do not for a moment doubt it, my lord ; and what a pity it is that a lady, possessing all those amiable and excellent qualities, should net have selected for herself a husband before life had advanced so far upon her.' \u2022Do not treat the matter ao lightly, West bourne \u2014 I have most serious reasons for wish ing you not to do so.' ' Indeed I my lord,' said the Honourable Mr. Sidley, looking at his father with no little as tonishment ; ' why should either I or you trouble ourselves seriously about the subject?' ' You will probably soon know,' answered Lord ' It Ib impossible.' ' But I say It is not only possible, but that It Sidley. must be.'"], [123, "OR, POVERTY, CRIME, AND SORROW. 115 1 Never.' Weitbourne during the tedious time that they were staying at Winchelby House, and the pains which Miss Norman evidently took to amuse him, and render herself agreeable, convinced him that the suspicions of Lord Sidley were correct ; and he felt the more vexed and annoyed In this conviction, and was determined, by every means in his power, to destroy the hopes wbich Miss Norman had formed. He therefore con ducted himself with cold and formal politeness to her, and was at times most chillingly reserved, much to the disappointment of the lady, and tho anger of his father, who took every opportunity to reproach him for his conduct whenever they were alone together. This, however, had no other effect upon Westbourne than to make him the more determined ; and Miis Norman, per ceiving how indifferently her attentions were received, when she had flattered herself, with a very little effort, to make a sensible impression upon bis heart, began to give way to melancholy and despair. 1 You had better not arouse my indignation.' 1 1 have no wish to do so ; but In a matter io important to my happiness, I must claim the right to act according to my own will and incli nations.' ' This obatlnancy will do you no good, West bourne.' 1 It is elucidated by reason and justice, and whatever axe the consequences I will adhere to it.' ' We wiU talk of this anon,' aaid lord Sidley, ' when I hope to find you in a different state of mind,' * My determination is unalterable, my lord/ returned Westbourne, and he then retired. This circumstance cat eed the yonng man con siderable annoyance, and at tho first opportunity he mentioned it to his mother, who was aa much astonished at it as himself; but she knew it would be uaeless to remonstrate with her hus band, who was blind to all reason or arngment, when he had fixed his mind npon anything : and she had experienced too mnch from his unkind ness lately to suppose that anything she could eay to him would have the leaat effect upon him. It waa about this time that the constitution of Lady Sidley, which had been long declining, was so much reduced, that she waB compelled to take to her bed ; but her illness did not seem to affect her husband ln. the least, and it caused no Interruption to him in his riotous pleasures. She had confided her secret to the admiral, who, after having remonstrated with her on the folly of encouraging, at her time of life (yes, he ventured to say thai,) a passion for a mere boy, which could never be returned, agreed, at the first opportunity, to broach the subject to Lord Sidley. However, euch an opportunity never occurred, or the admiral did not think proper to avail himself of it ; aod so the time of West bourne and his father's stay at the mansion passed away without the disconsolate maiden lady having advanced her suit one step, and Lord Sidley was also vexed and disappointed to think that no chance had been afforded him to bring about an alliance he coveted so macb. Lord Sidley had received frequent letters from the admiral and his niece, condoling with him on the illness of his amiable lady, but still most warmly pressing him and bis son to visit them at Winchelby House ; and at length, notwith standing the situation of her ladyship, he deter* mined to accept the invitation, and told West* bourne to prepare himself for their departure from tbe abbey. As for Westbourne Sidley, we need not say that he felt the greatest relief when they quitted Winchelby House ; and not all the arguments or threats or his lordship could make the smallest impression upon him. He now hoped that they would abandon all thoughts of the disagreeable and revolting project, and not annoy him any more; but what afterwards occurred proved how much he was mistaken. Westbourne would fain have excused himself, not only on account of his mother, bnt he ima gined the species of annoyance he should be subjected to ; and he eould no longer endure, with anything like patience, the society of the satlquated Miss Norman, although, after all, he could soaroely bring his mind to believe that the preposterous ideas of hls father were correct. But Lord Sidley would hear no excuse, and accordingly, a day or two afterwards, they left tile abbey, and departed for Winchelby House, Westbourne heartily wishing that the visit was over, and entertaining the greatest apprehensions for the situation ln whioh he had left his beloved mother. \u00bb We now return to that part of our narrative with which we concluded the preceding chapter. After Westbourne had retired, Lord Sidley continued to pace the room some time, and his wrath increased every moment. 'He Btlil remains obstinate,' he said, 'and It is clear that he defies me. Well, then, I know the course te adopt. If he does not consent to make Miss Norman hls wife, I will no longer own him as a son of mine; I will discard him \u2014disinherit him, and banish him for ever from my presence. And yet he may even then find means to annoy me, especially should he by any means discover my designs against Evelina Marsden. Curses light upon the accident which sent him to her rescue I The warmth of his manner when speaking of her convinces me that her beauty has made a powerful Impression on him; how could I expect otherwise, susceptible as he is, and alluring ae are the charms of the girls Who's there I' ' It Is only I, my lord,' said Stephen Black thorn, entering tbe room. Nothing paitioular happened to them on the journey, and in due course of time tbey arrived at Winchelby House, where they were received with all possible cordiality by the admiral and his niece, the letter of whom had taken especial pains with her personal appearance, and had assumed the most youthful, though certainly not the most becoming costume for the occasion. When sbe beheld the object of her thoughts, a gracious smile overspread her leatures, while Westbourne was so confused, tbat he scarcely knew what he did, and would willingly have given anything to be fifty miles away. The marked attentions thst were paid to"], [124, "EVELINA, THE PAUPER'S CHILD ; 116 1 If he does not consent, I will disinherit him, and banish him from my roof for ever.' ' A wise resolution, my lord,' said Blackthorn ; * but in the meantime, I think it would be advi- sable to contrive some means to get hftn out of the way, so that you may get Evelina securely in your power, without being in fear ol any inter- ruption from him.' \u2022 True, true,' coincided his lordship ; ' we must endeavour to think of some plan. But what course do you now propose to adopt !' ' Why, I have not yet had time to think of anything yet : but you may depend upon it I will make no more delay than I can help, for my own sake. A short time had better be suffered to elapse, so that the fears of her friends may be quieted, and then we can accomplish our designs with greater certainty.' 1 Ah I* ejaculated Lord Sidley ; \u25a0 that is, I conftsj, necessary, but still it Is a great trial to my patience.' 'I am glad you are come,' said hfs lordship ; * I wanted some one to communicate my thoughts to.' ' Your temper seems somewhat ruffled, my lord,' remarked Stephen. ' Ay, ay ; I am not in the best of humours. So the girl has arrived V ' Yes, curses on the disaster that brought her back. And your lordship .has seen your son, I suppose?' * Yes ; we have had an interview of no very agreeable character, 1 cao assure you.' ' I hope you have not suffered your disappoint ment to get the better of your reason, my lord, and to have led you to throw out any remark which might excite Westbourne -Suspicion !' ' Oh, no ; of course I was too cautious to do that .* 'I should think you would be.' ' The beauty of Evelina seems to have had its due effect npon him. He appears to be com pletely captivated with her.' * Yes, I noticed that at the hall,' said Black' thorn ; ' I also watched the girl narrowly, and I am convinced that he baa made equally as favourable an impression on her.' 1 Your lordship must submit to it ; I again promise you that your hopes shall not fail to be gratified.' 1 Well, I believe you are sincere.' ' You have no reason to think me otherwise. ' D n !' passionately exclaimed Lord Sidley. Am I not in danger of losing fortune, everything, while Evelina remains beneath the roof of her uncle ! The very sight of her is odious to my eyes.' ' He must be looked after narrowly, or he may prove a dangerous obstacle to the accom plishment of our wishes. He has received a warm invitation from old Langaton, too, to visit the hall whenever it is agreeable to him, and I noticed the pleasure which lighted up the coun tenance of Evelina when the Invitation was given.' 'In that respect, our feelings are decidedly different,' said the libertine. ' But is Mrs. Snacks still willing to assist us V ' She is sworn to do so.' ' And the men!' 1 Ob, they are all ready whenever they may be wanted agsin.' 'The distance from tbe abbey to the h_M Ib trifling, and she might easily be conveyed here, in the darkness of the night.' ' But he will net dare to disobey ray injunc** tions, and they are that he shall not visit the hall on any pretext whatever.' ' That is all very well, my lord,' said Black thorn ; ' but it is not likely that will deter him from meeting the girl at all hazards.' 4 That could not be done with safety, my lord, while your Bon is in the way.' 1 Well, we will see about removing that diffi culty very shortly ; and yet Buch is the manner in which Evelina has captivated him, that I do not think he will be persuaded to leave the neighbourhood voluntarily.' ' Then my vengeance Bhall descend on his head.' ' It would be muoh better if you could get him out of the way altogether. Send him on the continent, for instance.' * I much doubt whether he will comply with my mandates ; but I have another plan to get rid of him.' ' You surely can exercise some authority over him, my lord.* ' I will endeavour to do so, of course, but he seemed to Bet me at defiance lately. I did not expect that he would have returned from the visit to his friends so shortly.' ' And what is that, my lord . * By his marriage.' ' His marriage i\" ' Yes, a lady of fortune has long been in love with him, and would willlingly become his wife.' ' And what Bays he to the proposals!' ' He will not consent.* 1 It would have been a fortunate Job, if he had not,' said Blackthorn. * Ay, indeel it would,' coincided Lord Sidley, ' for Evelina would now have been ln my power.' ' There is no doubt of it, they were within a mile or two of Sarnscombe when the accident to the horse occurred, aud would have been almost certain to have reached there in safety.* 1 That is awkward,' remarked Blackthorn; but what are his reasons, my lord V 4 He cannot love her.' * And why V 1 Merely because the lady happens to be some twenty years older than himself,' remarked his lordship. 'It was along journey to undertake, under such circumstances,' said Lord Sidley, ' and it would have been better to have brought her here ; for the strength of the drug would not have evaporated by that time, and no alarm could possibly have been raised.' ' And is that h's only objection V asked Stephen with a sarcastic grin. ' It Js/ replied the nobleman ; ' and he seems determined in his opposition.' ' And you must be equally determined to compel him,' 'Well, it is useless to regret now; we sliall know better another time.'

I will see your lordship again to morrow; in the meantime, I will not lose a mo* ment in setting my ingenuity to work, to invent some scheme by which eur triumph may be rendered certain.' The expression of the villain's countenance was fearfully determined as he uttered these words, and darker and darker became the thoughts that gained possession of bis mind the longer he reflected. He was fully resolred that no danger, however great, should sta.id betwixt him and the gratification of bis avaricious desires. He had only proceeded a short distance from the abbey, and was wrapped in these meditations, when happening to look up, he observed Helen and her mother, who were returning from the hall to their own dwelling. Not wishing them to see him, he drew himself aside into a retired spot, and watched them as they proceeded. The light and graceful figure of Helen fired the rery ruffian's soul, and filled his bosom with numer ous conflicting passions. If such a heart as Blackthorn possed, could possibly be susceptible of any tender sentiment, he might be said to lore tbat fair and Innocent girl but a knowledge of his own unwortblness, the coldness, almost amounting to fear, and, as he at times imagined, suspicion, with which she viewed him ; the utter hopeless of his erer being able to win her aslec tions, and every idea that suggested Itself to his mind upon the subject, rendered him desperate; and he was as yet undecided how to act to gain possession ot her. ' Do so, and I shall not know how sufficiently to reward you.' ' Oh, there will be time enough to talk about that when business Ib dtne.' * Right, right, and there is not much feu of our quarrelling upon that subject.' 1 There is not,' said the villain ; ' we know each other very well.' ' We do,' returned his lordship ; \u25a0 farewell, then, till to-morrow.' 4 Farewell, my lord,' said Blackthorn, and he quitted the abbey. As he hurried on his way, he pondered deeply vpon all the circumstances which had recently taken place, and likewise upon all that Lord Sidley had said to him respecting hls son, and his anxiety to be revenged on him became greater. Bat above all, he considered It was absolutely necessary to get him out of the way, as soon as possible, and be was resolved to keep hls lordship firm to that purpose. He was certain from what he had himself witnessed at the recent interview at the hall, that both West bourne and Evelina were prepossessed in each other's favour, and therefore it would be advis able to adopt eome means to separate tbem without any further delay, or the watchful eye of the young gentleman might perchance penetrate Ihe dark plot that was being laid, and take imme diate steps, determined and courageous as be was, to frustrate it. ' Bat she shall be mine/ he ejaculated as he gazed after her ; ' yes, at any risk, at any cost I will obtain her. Let me but once dispose of Evelina, and I will then boldly make my advances towards her, although I feel satisfied that I shall only meet with her scorn. However, that shall not daunt me, and when I have fortune at my command, I shall not entertain so much appre hension of my succesB.' Helen and her mother now having turned Into the lane, which led almost immediately to the farm, were hidden from Bight, and Stephen Black thorn, filled with these guilty ideas, retraced his steps towards home. The bosom of Westbourne Sidley was tortured with varionB painful thoughts, after his interview with his father, and be saw plainly enough that there were numerous troubles in store for him. That his father should persist in endeavouring to persuade him to marry Miss Norman, filled him with disgnst ; and he was resolved, whatever might be the consequences to himself, even should Lord Sidley fuldl bis threat of discarding him, he would never give bis con sent to an union so repugnant to his feiings. Marry a woman old enough to be his parent, and thus at once sacrifice all his hopes and prospects! the thought was monstrous, it was unnatural. And yet he too well knew the character of his father, not to fell assured that he would remain inflexible. ' Yes/ mattered Blackthorn to himself, ' I like not the appearance of this young gallant, and the glanees which he and Evelina bestowed upon each other. And then the cordiality with which old Langston received him, and invited him to renew his visits to the ball, was wormwood to me. He must be removed, or we Bhall find some difficulty, I imagine, in putting oar plans into execution. The idea of Lord Sidley thinking to persuade him to marry this ancient dame, not- withstanding all tbe attractions of wealth, Is preposterous ; but still if I can only keep him in the mind to fulfil his threat of banishing and disinheriting him if he does not eonsent, it will be glorious food for the hatred I bear him, and render him, as it were, powerless to obstruct me In my plans. It must, it shal be done. But still, knowing the dislike which old Paul Lang- ston bears towards his father, I do not believe that he will ever encourage the addresses of Westbourne to hls niece. Let him then marry her clandestinely, if he can gain her consent, aad that would answer my purpose just as well a* if she fell into the power of bis lordship ; for her act of disobedience woold probably set the mind of tbe old man against her, aod the wealth which he now intends for her would, doubtless, The observations wWch Lord Sidley had made respecting Evelina had not much surprised him, although they filled him with juit indignation. That he Bhould ridicule, if not reproach, him for an act of common humanity, and that towards an innocent unprotected girl, inspired him with feelings of the utmost resentment, and was what"], [126, "EVELINA, THE PAUPER'S CHILD ; 118 suture, In order to endeavour to elicit what waa the nature ot the connexion that existed between him and Lord Sidley. Westbourne had noticed the conduct of Stephen during tbe time he had been at the hall, and notwithstanding the pleasure he expressed at tbe restoration of Evelina, he thought he eonld per. ceive the hyprocrlte lurking beneath ; and he had two or three times observed him casting sinister glances towards h'm, esnecla'.ly when Mr. Lang ston invited him to visit the hall whenever be pleased, and when the old gentleman so warmly expressed bls gratitude to him for hit con duct; and all these things, simple though they might be, had made an Impression upon the mind of Westbourne, which be was not likely soon to be able to banish. He firmly believed that Blackthorn had frequently pandered to the vices ot his father, and assisted him in the exe cution of those profligate transactions, ef which he too well knew him to have been guilty , and which had broken hit unfortunate lady's heart ; and that alone was enough to inspire him with tho utmott contempt and abhorrence of hit character. Westbourne had also no doubt that Black thorn had made certain of becoming tbe pos sessor of Mr. Langston'a property at hia death, and now that he had taken his beauteous and gentle niece under hit proteotion, those hopes would be destrojed, so that he must view Evelina with feelings of Jealousy, If not of hatred ; and he therefore eonld not believe that the pleasure Stephen bad evinced at ber restora tion could be sincere. He watched Blackthorn's tall and mnacular figure until It was hidden entirely from hit view, and be then again resumed his seat, and relapsed into the same train of thought that had previously occupied hit mind. His reverie, however, was shortly Interrupted by a message from hit father, desiring to tee him in his etudy. He was ln no humour to see him again that day, and would gladly haye excuted himself ; but be knew it wal no ute doing to ; so he immediately hastened to obey the sum moot. He fonnd hit lordthlp seated In hit chair, with a letter ln hit hand ; and hit countenance waa stern and forbidding. He coldly motioned hit ton to take a teat, and then looked tteadfaatly In his face for two or thee minutes, as if he would penetrate the thoughts which were putlog in hit mind. ' I told yon, Westbourne, on our recent meet- ing,' be at last aaid, ' that I had received a proposal from Mlas Norman, through the admiral her uncle. It is necessary that you should peruse the letter, in which you are so Immediately Inter- ested. It la here; and I direct your particular attention to It.' ' Excuse me, my lord,' repUed Westbourne, firmly ; ' I have no wish to see the letter, since the subject on which it dwells Is so opposed to my feelings. The lady had better try her fortune with one more worthy of her, and of a more appropriate age; it is utterly impossible tbat she can ever make any impression on me.' 'Headstrong boyl' exclaimed Lord Sidley, passionately, ' would you reject an alliance that he had never supposed his lordship capable of; but little did he imagine the real motires from which those sentiments sprung. What disgust, what indignation, what horror would he hart felt bad he known the full extent of his parent's guilt. He would hare been ashamed to havf looked Evelina, that blight object of his warmes admlratioD, in the face again. It was a subject ot the greatest alarm and aDxlety to him, tha tbe damsel should possess Buch secret and appar ently determined enemies, and he had fully mad< up his mind to endearour to discover them, and bring them tojustice. The hours which Westbourne Sidley had passed in the society of our heroioe had been some ofthe happiest that had ever fallen to his lot ; and now that he was no longer gladdened by her presence, and no more listened to the soft music of her roice, he felt uneasy and loney; but he was somewhat comforted by the reception he had met with from Mr. Langston, and the permission he received to visit the hall, and he felt certain from the expression he had obserred to beam la the eyes of Erelina when that consent was giren, tbat she felt as much gratified as himself. He should then frequently be allowed the felicity of her company, and in listening to her observations, and contemplating her transcendent beauties, he should experience the most unbounded happiness. But should his father discover his visits, he would uo doubt sternly prohibit them, and thus he would be placed in a position c i'the most awkward and painful nature. But even at the risk of his lordship's displeasure, he felt certain he could never consent to deprive himself of a pleasure that was so essential to his peace of mind. 1 Oh, how fortunate will that man be, who can win tbe heart and mind of one so incomparably beautiful, both in persan and miad 1' he fervently cried. 'With such a lovely companion, tbe Humblest Btation of lite would possess unbounded charms. Wealth and rank are mere contempt!* ble baubles compared witb such heavenly bliss. But, alas 1 it will never fall to my lot to Inherit such supreme felicity ; I can never hope to win more than the esteem of Evelina, and why, therefore, should I presume to encourage such t houghts V But in spite of all his efforts, be cou'd not bauish them, for the Image of our heroine was too deeply stamped upon his mind, and rendered him miserable until be should behold her again. He continued for some time absorbed in these and similar reflections, when he arose from Mb seat and walked to the window. At tbat moment Blackthorn was leaving tbe abbey, and West- bourne immediately recognised him. He had heard much of the depraved character of this man; and he had ever looked upon him with feelings of repugnance and suspicion, for although he liked not to judge any one hastily, he was firmly inclined to beUeve tbat villany lurked at his heart- He had ever shunned his advances of friendship, and he sou greatly surprised at the intimacy that existed between him and his father ; under those circumstances, it is not to be marvelled at that he should look upon his pre- sent visit to the abbey as a bad omen, and he determined to watch him more narrowly for the"], [127, "OR, POVERTY, CRIME, AND SORROW. 119 even the proudest nobleman In the land might envy!' 1 1 have candidly acknowledged my thoughts upon that subject to your lordship. You have heard my decision.' WeBtbourne made no reply, but anxious once more to escape from the presence of his father, he quitted the room. This interview caused him for the remainder of the day the most unpleasant reflections, aud he could not but severely condemn the sorbid and tyrannical motives which made his father so urgent to enter into an union so obnoxious to his feelings, and which It was quite evident could only be productive of the greatest misery to both him and the lady whom his lordship wished him to expouse. Was it to be expected, under any circumstances, that a young, handsome man, of Westbourne's tastes and habits, would ever con sent to become the husband of ench a woman, as Bliss Norman? The very Idea was outrageous, and he ceuld not but feel both astonishment and disgust at his father for encouraging it for an instant. But it was quite clear his happiness in hia father's mind, was only a secondary considera tion; and there were moments when Westbourne even thought that his lordship viewed him with a sort of antipathy, in consequence of the attach ment he had ever shown towards his mother, and the opinion he had more than once ventured to express of his father's treatment of her. Bitterly he lamented the state of dependanoe in which he was placed, and was anxious to follow any pursuit, rather than lead a life of Indolence. These manly thoughts he had frequently urged upon his father, but received in return only the most sarcastic reproaches, for what he was pleased to term his grovelling spirit ; and even his wish to be allowed to follow the profession of arms, was rejected with scorn. It seemed indeed a3 if his lordship felt a gratification in thwarting and disappointing his son in all his hopes, and was determined that he should become entirely the victim of his stem will aud caprice. 'Your decisions' * Yes ; the woman whom I consent to make my wife, must possess my heart, even though she were a princess,' * Obdurate I hut you had better alter your decision, or you will have cause to repent It.' 'I cannot help It, sir,' returned Westbourne ; 1 but once more I solemly repeat that nothing whatever will induce me to give my consent.' 'You have formed another attachment un known to me,' said Lord Sidley. 1 You are mistaken, my lord,' answered West bourne ; and yet he could not help feeling some confusion whan he thought el Evelina. 'This letter must be answered, and that promptly/ said his lordship. ' That task I must leave for your lordship to perform. It is more proper for you to do it than me, and as you know my determination ' ' D n! exclaimed Lord Sidley, furiously interrupting hia son, and fixing upon him a look which was meant to frighten him into obedience. ' You will not, dare not refuse I1 ' I am sorry to be compelled to act contrary to your wishes, my father; but I cannot, nay more, I will not give any encouiagemeut te the ridicu lous suit of Miss Norman ; and, therefore, it is useless to hold out any false hopes to her.' ' Bnt I will answer this letter,' said Lord Sidley, with a frown, ' and that to the lady's satisfaction.' 'Then allow me to say, my lot d,' said WeBt bourne, his bosom swelling with indignation and wounded pride. ' that you will bs guilty of great injustice not only to me, but the lady herself ; and, of course, I shall consider myself bound in honour at the earliest opportunity to undeceive her. Lord Sidley bit his Hps, and reflected for a few moments ln silence. 'You will think better of this, Westbourne/ ha at length said, in a somewhat aubdued tone, 1 and under that impression I will give you two or three days to make up your mind.' * My mind Is made up already, my lord,' an swered his son, 'and therefore it is useless to tamper any longer with Miss Norman's feelings.' ' And my determination Is also fixed,' said the nobleman, sternly, 'and therefore yon wi.l do well to deliberate maturely before you give a positive refusal.' ' it requires not a momsnt's deliberation, my lord, and that refusal 1 have already given/ ' Boy, are you mad V * No, my lord, but I should begin to think that I were if I could consent to unite myself to eue These thoughts occupied the mind of West bourne during the night, and caused his sleep to be d'sturbed and unrefreshing. But nothing could shake his resolution t. resist the attempted unnatural and hateful alliance, let the conse quences to himself be whatever they might. He arose at any early hour, aud as the morn ing was floe he left the abbe/, thinking that the air would refresh him after the many hours of mental agony he had suffered. Unconsciously Westbourne bent his footsteps in the direction of the hall, and was wrapped in deep meditation, when he was suddenly aroused by some individual rushing hastily past him. He looked up and beheld a man proceeding at a rapid rate in a contrary direction to that be was pursuing. He started ; lor the dress and person of tho man struck him in an instant. He was certain he had seen him before, and looking more narrowly after him, he was convinced that he was not mistaken, but that It was one of the ruffians from whom he had rescued Evelina. whom I could scarcely ever esteem even.' ' Some otber damsel possesses your heart. I soe it plainly ; but mark me, you may at once stifle the passion in your breast, for never will I sanction the addresses of any other than the amia ble Miss Norman. You may retire, and I caution you not to scorn my words, but to act in obe dience to my will, studious as J am of your (relfara.' Surprise and indignation for some seconds held him In confusion, but quickly collecting himself, although he was unarmed, he rapidly pursued the fellow, who carried a large stick, and called loudly upon him to stop. The man looked back, aud although he bad got to some distance, Westbourne immediately distinguished and re cognised bis features, and waa satisfied that he wm right in the conjectures he fcad formed."], [128, "EVELINA, THE PAUPER'S CHILD. 120 1 Stop, villain !' he cried, ' on your Hfe, I com mand you 1 I know you, and you shall not eicape me !' Jack Ddgley, 'or be it was, only replied to this by a scornful laugh, and then pursued his way ; but fiading that Westbourne still persisted in following him, and was gaining fast upon him, and perceiring that be was unarmed, he sud denly made a stand, and with an air of defiance, waiting for his coming up. 'And now, Mr. Westbourne Sidley,' said Dagley, when the former had arrived at the spot where he was standing, ' what is yoar business with me !' ' Miscreant 1* said the young man, his faoe glowing with resentment, ' I know you; you are one of the wretches who commited the oat rage upon Evelina Marsden.' ' I know it, and what then?' 1 Scoundrel ! for what purpose are you lurking ln this neighbourhood 2' ' That is my business. Think you I am going to gratify the prying curiosity of every officious fool ? Get you gone, while you are safe, for you will find that I am a man not disposed to be trifled with.' ' Ruflian ! dare you threaten? I have met you now, ana am determined tbat you shall not escape the hands of justice.' As Westbourne uttered these words, he made an attempt to seize Dagley by the collar, but before he could accomplish his object, the fellow raised tbe stick he held in his hand, and felled him to the earth with a tremendous blow, which rendered him completely insensible. How long he had remained In that state he did not know, but when he recovered, he found himself in a cottage which was on the estate of his father, and the honest inmates of which had exerted themselves to the utmost to bring about bls restoration. Westbourne look.d eagerly around him, and then demanded \u2014 'Is the ruffian secured, Philip?' \u25a0 What ruffian, sir?' asked Philip. ' The fellow who committed this outrage,' replied Westbourne ; * he has surely not been allowed to escapes' ' I and my son found you lying insensible in tbe road, sir,' said the cottager; ' but we saw no one near the spot. Have you been robbed, eir, and are you much hurt?' 'No.no,' impatiently returned Westbourne ; 1 but I would bare given a hundred pounde sooner than the miscreant should have escaped.' * Aud 1 should hare been moct happy to have earned the money, sir,' Bald Philip, with much sincerity. ' But what kind of a man was he, sir ? and what ' ' It is useless to answer those questions,' in terrupted Westbourne, 'for the scoundrel, no doubt, is safe enough by this time. I know not what means to adopt to detect him and his in famous associates, who are prebably concealed eome where !n this neighbourhood, waiting another opportunity to put their designs into execution. Evelina and her fr.ends must be cautioned of their danger, or the worst consequences may be apprehended.' ' It is a fortunate job tbat you are not more severely hart, sir, aud t .at the man did not rob you,' remarked Philip. ' His object was not robbery,' said Weatbourn. ' But I must lose no time. Here Is a trifle to reward yon for the trouble you have been at, Philip.- The old man returned many thanks, and Sidley left the cottage, and retraced his steps borne, as it was yet too early to'go to the hall. Wo need not state the fear which haunted his mind after this unexpeoted adventure, and he was completely at a loss what plan to adopt which might lead to the detection of the villains and prevent the accomplishment of the further designs they probably contemplated against our heroine. His father met hi n at he entered the abbey, tnd immediately noticed the agitation of his demeanour. ' You have taken an early walk this morning, Westbourne !' he observed. ' But what is the matter ; you do not seem much at your ease.' ' I have met with a surprise, my lord,' said Westbourne, ' and have bean assaulted, ' Assaulted I by whom ?' 1 One of the miscreants from whom I lately rescued Miss Marsdtn, whom I met and attemp ted to seize/ 'Abi' ejaculated Lord Sidley, and he frowned. ' Yet, my lord,' returned hit am ; 'itis quite clear that the wretches are somewhere conoealed in the neighbourhood.' ' Well suppose they are, pray what business ls that of yours V demanded his lordship. ' What business is it of mine V repeated West bourne. ' You surprise me, my lord, by putting such a question to me, after what has so recently happened.' 'Let me caution you, Westbourne,' said his father. ' not to trouble yourself any more about these men, or you may, perchance, have to pay dearly for your folly. 'Folly, my lords surely you canaot mean what you say. Is it not my duty to endeavour to bring these miscreants to justice, and to pre vent them from carrying out their diabolical plans against an innocent girl V \u2022 I again tell you that you have no bnsinett at all with it ; and why ahould yon be continually running tha risk of a broken head, when it is the duty of the girl's friends to protect her t Let me hear no more of this, for you have far more seriout matter to occupy your thoughts at pre sent.' Westbourne looked at his father with lnoreated attonlthment. ' My lord,' he said, ' I cannot ttand tamely by, and tee an Innocent girl like Evelina Marsden sacrificed to tho vlllauoua designs of these wretches. I will detect them, and bring them to punishment, if there Is a possibility of my doing so.' \u25a0 The boy is certainly going mad,' aaid his lordship. ' Beware, beware, for you know not the danger you run yourself into ; and for what I and mark me, Westbourne, it strikes me that think too much of this girl, and that you have you suffered her to make too great an impression upon you.' \u25a0 I own, my lord, that I pity her for the mur fortunet ahe hat encountered, and admire her"], [129, "EVELINA, THE PAUPER'S CHILD ; OR, POVERTY, CRIME, AND SORROW. 121 man, for It has put him upon the scent, when he would otherwise not hare had the least suspicion tbat the fellows were in the neighbourhood. However, ttu rascal acted wisely in pr3 renting him from watcMng whither he went.

It is clear enough that the beautr of Evelina tas captivated the heart of Westbourne, and no wonder, therefore, that he should show such an obstinate opposition to the proposed alliance with Mist Norman. However, I will remain firm ln my de termination , and I hare no doubt when he finds that, he will yield.

' Away with this romantic foolery !' cried Lord Sidlev, impatiently, 'lam sick of listening to it. Retire ; I would bc alone.' Westtjourue, who was quite disgUBted with his father'*, observations, gladly obeyed, and Lord Sidley was then left alone. * This headstrong boy must be watched narrowly,' he muttered to himself, 'or he will yel manage to detect and to frustrate our designs.

Wettbourne shortly afterwards met his father at the breakfast table, aud it was quite evident from his manner that bis anxiety and agitation were not at all abated. Lori Sidley, who bad somewhat conquered the warmth of his feelings. requested him to relate more minu _!y tbe par ticulars of his meeting with Dagley ; \u00ab. iiich West bourne complied with, and his father listened to him with mute attention. And he had, assuring that gentleman tbat Westbourne fjlt hiebly honoured by the favour able sentiments which the amiable Miss Norman was pleased to entertain towards him, and that in a few days sbe might expect a communication from him, in which he would more fully explain tbe passion with which she had inspired him. However, he thought it as well not to let West bourne know anything of this at present, for he knew very well in his present state of mind that he would take the readiest means to undeceive her, and thus at once to destroy the amlbitlout and jealous hopes of hit lordship. ' But alter all,' he said, ' you might have been mistaken, and this might not have been the man you took him to be.' ' Oh, no/ said Westbcurne, ' I could not be mistaken.

' I think it is much better for you that you did not,' remarked Lord Sidley ; ' for you might have paid for yonr headstrong folly with your life.' ' Ob, no,' returned Westbourne. ' I do not fear that. I would have procured the assistance of the officers of jaetice, and the miscreant would have been sure to have been apprehended ; and ail future danger from them would have been at an end. I shall not rest until I have discovered what their purpose with Evelina is, and who is their villanous employer.' 'Indeed!' said his lordship, with a sneer; ' metbinks your taik, then, will be a fruitless one. But how know you that the men are employed by any person .' ' Time will probably discover, my dear sir, answered Westbourne ; ' but, in the meanwhile, I trust that Providence will watch over and protect Mies Marsden from his power.' Evelina looked her thanks, and Westbourne was more than repaid. The heart of the damsel nsturally warmed towards him, from tho interest which he Beemed to take in her safety and happi ness, and Bhe felt tho greatest pleasure in his Bociety, and in listening to his agreeable con versation; and she regretted when the time arrived for him to take his leave. Tbe accomplishments of Westboarne Sidley were of tbe highest order, and to which his fine m .nly virtues, his candour, generosity, and openness, of behaviour, added a luBtre which could not fail to excite tbe warmest esteem and admiration in the minds of all who had the honour of his society. ' I feel confident that they are ; and that it is some heartless libertine wbo is at the bottom of all this.' Lord Si.ley bit his lljis, and It w?s not with out considerable difficulty that he was enabled to conceal his rage. However, he made no further observation, and the repast bemg over, West bourne, feeling himself uncomfortable in the presooce of his father, made au excu_e, and retired. Unused to the world as Evelina was, she having from the earliest childhood until recently been immured in that horrible receptacle of misery, the workhouse of Allover ; and since she bad been under the roof of her uncle, her life having been almost equally secluded, the estim able qualities possessed by Westbourne wero quite new to her; and after the service he had rendered her, and the deep interest he seemed to taka in her welfare, it was not at all remarkable that he should make a powerful impression upon her mind; nor could she see how she should act imprudently in admiring and esteeming one so every wa. worthy of her friendship, and to whom she was so much indebted. Watching his opportunity, Westbourne quitted tbe abbey, and made his way, vith a palpitating heart, towards the haU ; anxious once more to behold Evelina, and to made her and her uncle acquainted with the adventure of the morning, and which would warn them of tbe danger that still threatened them, and would prepare them to adopt some plan to guard them, against It. Mr. Langston evinced Boms surprise, for he did not expect to have Been Wesibourne so soon, but Evelina could not help expressing the plea, are she felt at bis appearance Feeling confident that Westbourne's attentions sprung from the purest motives, Bhe gradually felt less timidity and confusion in his society ; love was a passion she knew by name alone, e.-en when it was exerting its strongest in fluences over her susceptible heart. Sbe felt pleasure that Mr. LaDgsfon viewed him with the same feeling of friendship, aud that he had so crdially encouraged his visit, to the Dark Hall j but still she could not help obse.-ving a cenain restraint at times in his manners towards Westbourne Sidley, which sbe attributed, no doubt, to the right cause, namely, a feeling of regret that he should be tbe son ot Lord Vernon, who, independent of his questionable character, they had so much reason to look upon with feelings of repugnance, from the manner in which he tad been connected with the ruin of Evelina's father. He was luxuriating in the property that by right belonged to that unfortu nate man, and but for him be might still have been living in every happiness tbat wealth and virtue could produce. Mr. Langston gave him a hearty welcome, which was most gratifying to Westbourne's feelings: and after the usual compliments had been exchanged, he proceeded to relate the par ticulars! of what had occurred to bim. Evelina and her uncle listened to him with tbe most breathless attention ; and the former, as Westbourne proceeded, turned very pale, aad trembled violently. ' This is a most alarming event, Mr. Sidley,' Bald Langaton, when he had concluded; ' aud I feel greatly obliged to you for the interest which you are pleased to take iu the welfare and safety of my niece; but are you certain that you were not mistaken as regard's the man's identity!' ' Oh, no,' answered Westbourne, * that is im possible; the fellow has a remarkable counte nance ; and I had taken such notice ou first meeting with him, that I was sure to recognise him again.' 'The rascals, then, are evidently secreted somewhere close at hand,' said Mr. Langston ; ' and It Is plain enough that they have not abandoned their guilty designs. What can be doue to defeat them, and bring them to justice V And WeBtbourne, who knew all the painful circumstances connected with this part of Marsden's history, felt tbe same degree of regret, and had at times his doubts of tbe in tegrity of his father's conduct ; and these thoughts were the only drawbacks to the plea sure he otherwise felt in the society of our heroine, although he felt confident that Evelina wes too charitable to feel the least reproach towards him for the faults of his parent. 'Why, sir,' replied Westbourne, 'I think it is necessary that a full description of these persons should be advertised without delay, and a reward offered for their apprehension.' ' That course shall be immediately adopted, Bir,' said Mr. Langston, ' and I am much"], [131, "OR, POVERTY, CRIME, AND SORROW. 123 Such were the reflections that occupied the mind of Westbourne on his way back to the abbey, and much was the anxiety and uneasiness that they created in hia bosom. He might win the love, but he feared that he could never hope to gain the hand of Evelina, and, therefere, would it. perhaps, have been better that they had never met. his amazement, beheld Stephen Blackthorn just emerging from it, and on beholding him he ex hibited some confusion, mingled with resentment, as Westbourne thought ; but he merely bowed, and walked on, without speaking. What could be the business of Stephen so frequently with Lord Sidley ? Westbourne reflected ; and why should their conferences be held in so secret a manner? It was, he was fearful, from no goo_ cause; for he well knew the vicious character of Stephen ; that he had been engaged in many nefarious transactions; and he was surprised that his father, for the Bake of his own credit, should have anything to do with him. He could not help thinking that his lord ship had some secret design in contemplation, which he (Westbourne) waB unable to penetrate, or even to form tbe least conjecture upon. Had he bad the least idea that that design was against the peace and honour of Evelina, how great would have been his indignation, and bow quickly would he have exerted himself to prevent it, even at any risk. And then a source of much speculation and uneasiness to him, was the certainty that Evelina had some secret enemy, who sought her destruc tion, and that, as be bad hitherto escaped dis covery, he mfght sind an opportunity of ac complishing his evil designs in so secret a manner that it would be impossible for any one to thwart him. There were many observations which Lord Sidley had made on that subject which created his greatest surprise, and bad caused him much reflection; but, of course, never for a moment could a suspicion enter his mind that he was the author of that infamous plot, or his disgust, indignation, and anguish would have known no bounds. Upon Stephen Blackthorn he certainly looked with doubt, for he thought he read the villain in his countenance, and he knew that he had reason to be jealous of the affection which Mr. Langston bestowed upoo Evelina, since it would no doubt greatly interfere with bis pecuniary hopes, on the demise of the old gentleman. In spite of ail his congratulations on the restoration of our heroine to her home, he had frequently marked the expression of his countenance, aud could uot but imagine that rage and disappointment lurked beueath his specious professions. He also knew him to have been engaged in many scenes of profligacy and vice; and for all these reasons Westbouroe resolved to keep a strict eye upon him. His frequent secret conferences with Lord Sidley, also excited his suspicion, and gave rise to various doubts and conjectures in bis mind. On entering the abbey, he made his way to his own apartment, as be did not feel disposed, in hiB present state of mind, for any society; but he had not been long there, when he received a summons from his father to attend him in his study. He felt convinced that the subject his lordship desired to speak to him upon, was his marriage with Miss Norman, and he would fain have excused himself, but he knew it would be to no purpose, and he therefore assumed as much composure as he could, and obeyed. He found his lordship pacing the room with impatient steps, aad on Westbourne's entrance, he turned suddenly round, and eyed him with looks in which anger and curiosity were mingled. 'So, Westbourne,' he said, ' it seems tbat the society of your father has become so disagreeable to you that you constantly absent yourself from home.' ' Would,' reflected Westbourne, ' that I had been the son of any other man, and had been made the humble instrument of rescuing the beauteous Evelina from danger ; then, even though my circumstances might have been the most lordly, I could have urged my passion to the fair being who has inspired it, with far greater confidence ; but as it is, I fear that I can never hope to gain more than the gratitude and esteem of Evelina. Oh, how miserable, hopeless, and dependent, do I feel my situation to be.* * Your lordship does me wrong by supposing anything of the kind,' said Westbourne in reply. ' I trust that my conduct has hitherto never been wanting in proper respect to you ; but the fineness of the weather ' ' And the charms of Evelina Marsden, are more attractive than the company ot your father. You have agaiu visited the hall.' 'Tis true, my lord,' answered Westbourne candidly, at the same time that he felt his pride mortified at the imperious tone of his lordship, and the unjust restraint be sought to exercise over his actions; \u2014 ' I do not deny that I have visited the residence of Mr. L .ngston, nor do I see anything at all objectionable in my having done so.' Such were the reflections of Westbourne as he pursued his way towards home ; he well knew tbe weakness of encouraging them, but still he could not help doing so; and coupled with his father's determination that he should unite him self to the antiquated Miss Norman, they made him feel truly wretched. * Indeed 1' returned Lord Sidley, with a bitter sneer. ' But 1 see plainly how it is ; the girls few personal charms have dazzled yonr senses, and doubtless she is sufficiently proficient in the arts of her sex to make the best use of the advan tage she has obtained.' Not that Westboarne was undecided how to act, as regarded that preposterous alliance, for his mind was fully made up to encounter any thing i-ooner than submit to make any such a sacrifice ; but he could not but feel the utmost pain at tbe anticipation of incurring his father's wrath ; and be too well knew his inexorable character, to think that he would hesitate to carry his threat into effect. ' My lord,' ejaculated Westbourne, unable to retrain his indignation, ' I am surprised to hear you give utterance to such insinuations against an innocent girl, who, I am certain, entertains no other feeling towards me than one of gratitude lor having rescued her from danger.

I Lord Sidley stamped bis foot passionately, and I wared his hand command ingly, and Westbourne, I who had no wish to remain any longer in his pre- I senca, left the room.

'Then, sir,' returned Westbourne, firmly, 'as a man of honour, it will be my painful duty to nndeceire the lady and her uncle without delay.' ' Headstrong boy,' cried his lordship, with increasing rage, ' would you make me appear ridiculous lu the eyes of the world?'

The coarse epithets which his father had made use of in allu sion to ber, created in his breast the greatest disgust; and again he regretted that he was the son of a man who could entertain such foelings towards a poor innocent giil, wim o, .id never have done bim an injury, but towards whose parents, he firmly believed, he had acted a part of treachery, and tbat the greater portion of the wealth he possessed, by right, belonged to her. These painful ruminations followed Westbourne Sidley to hiB couch, and he slept but little that night; but at last he came to the conclusion thet it were better for him to refrain from visiting the ball for a day or two, in order that he might, in the meantime, endeavour to conciliate his father, and to quiet his suspicions ; but he resolved to watch his actions narrowly, for he strongly sur mised, from the frequent visits of Stephen Black thorn, that he had some secret design in con teraolation, though what the nature of it could be, he could not form the least conception of. to her friend, but Bhe was fearful that she might appear too bold, and might have lormed a wrong opinion of the sentiments of Evelina, and she therefore forbore to do so; and whenever tbey were together, she tried to divert the conversation to Bome otber subject. Evelina, however, never seemed so happy as when she was dwelling upon the virtues of Westbourne, her preserver; and when three days elapsed, and still Westbourne came not to the hall, her uneasiness and dis appointment became so great that she could not conceal tbem from Helen, and scarcely from Mr. Langston, who, however, had no suspicion of her real feelings. Evelina was fearful that Westbourne was ill, but Helen was of a different opinion, and con sidered it most probable that Lord Sidley had discovered his son's visits to the hall, and had prohibited them; but still Bhe waa almost as anxious as our heroine could be to behold him again, or to her something from him. Stephen Blackthorn came to the ball almost every day, and hel _ private conferences with Mrs. Snacks, and he marked the emotion of our heroine whenever the name of West.otirne was men tioned with secret exultation, well knowing the scheme he had in contemplation would not only prove the destruction of all her hopes, if she had raised her thoughts to Wes ib au me, hut remove the only obstacle which presented itself to the possession of old Paul Langston's wealth. The oftener he gezed upon the beauteous Helen too, the more determined, and the more auxions was he topossesB her; and whenever he was in her company, he exerted himself to the utmost to make himBelf agreeable to her. But Helen always felt uneasy in her presence, and received his attentions with disgust and repugnance, which Stephen perceived with feelings of rage and dis appointment he could with difficulty conceal. Nearly a week had passed away since West bourne had visited the hall, and Evelina began to think that he had abandoned them altogether, and she could not but feel both vexed and dis appointed, especially after ihe cordial invitation he bad received from Mr. Langston. Nor was the image ofthe accomplished and amiable Westbourne Sidley ever absent from the thoughts of our heroine for any time together, and she felt the greatest Impatience to behold him again, although she bad no Idea thai that anxiety had its origin in anything else but a seel ing of gratitude. She delighted to talk to the gentle Helen about him, and to expatiate upon his numerous virtues and accomplishments, and Helen was no less ardent ln ber encomiums ou his numerous noble qualities, and exhibited no astonishment at tbe powerful impresbion which Westbourne bad evidently made upon her young and Innocent friend. Helen was gifted with a keen penetration, and it was not long ere sbe was convinced that Eve- Una possessed a far more tender feeling than that of mere admiration towards him. And it was not without considerable regret that she discerned this, for she saw at once the many obstacles there were in the way to the gratification of their pas sion, If it should be mutual between them, uot only from the differenee of the'r rank, and the melancholy circumstances of Evelina's history, but the certain refusal of Lord Sidley to sanction their love, and the repugnance which our heroine murt naturally feel to enter the family of a man who had probably done her unfoitunate father so much wrong. And although Mr. Langston beheld Westbourne Sidley with feelings of friendship and gratitude, and admired him for his numerous virtues, Helen knew the dislike with which he viewed his lordship, and it was not likely, therefore, that he would ever give his consent to the encourage ment of their passion, if even Lord Sidley should offer no objection. One afternoon as Helen was engaged by some business at home, Evelina visited her at the farm, and the time passed away so agreeably in conversation, that tbe shades of evening began to fall ere Evelina arose to depart, and she would not permit Helen to accompany her instead of her father, who was from home. In the meantime, Westbourne Sidley had visited the hall, and could not help e. pressing his regret at finding Ev-lina abient from home. However, he remained ia conversation with Mr. Langaton till the evening, and he then took his departure, and made his way towards the farm, with the hope of meeting Evelina, and of having the pleasure of escorting her home. He had pro ceeded to some distance from the hall, when his ears were assailed with the loud shrieks of a female, and he quickened his pace in order that he might come up to the spot from whence tbe cries ofthe woman pro:eeded, fearful that so_ie violence waa being committed, which required hls interference, at the same time that a thought slashed through his mind that it might be Evelina who called tor help. These were difficulties which Helen saw plainly they would never be able to surmount, and she consequently hoped that both Evelina and West bourne would be able to .tide their love in Its infancy, which might otherwise be productive of io much unhappiness to them both. Helen w.uld ain have Imparted these thoughts"], [134, "126 EVELINA, THE PAUPER'S CHILD; The moon had just risen, and having hastily crossed a stile into a large field, he beheld, at some distance before him, a male and female form struggling together, while the woman continued to scream ior help, but was evidently almost ex hausted. which he felt at the unexpected and disgusting occurrence. Evelina trembled violently, and crimson blushes suffused her cheeks ; but still Bhe could not decline the proposal of Westbourne, and suffering him to take her arm, they walked on a short distance in silence, although the thoughts that were passing in their minds were of the most agonizing description. This sight aroused all tbe manly indignation of Westbourne, and he shouted aloud, aod in a com manding tone, to the man to hold, and redoubled his speed to come up to them. What were his emotions wheu, on approaching nearer, he reco nised in the poor struggling damsel, Evelina Marsden I But Westbourne Sidley never for a moment Imagined the real designs of his father, and thought that the reason of his having dared to insult Evelina, was in consequence of the hatred that he bore towards her, and the apprehensions that had entered his mind tbat she had made an impression upon his (Westbourne's) heart ; and never could he sufficiently deprecate the cruelty, injustice, and cowardice which could have promp ted hie lordship to such an outrage upon one so young and innocent. Onr heroine knew him at the same moment, and called upon his name. The man released hiB hold .nd turned round, and Westbourne started back aghast wheu he beheld his father. Lord Sidley uttered a loud curse, and imme diately hurried away, and Westbourne hurrying to the spot caught the terrified and almost faint ing Evelina in his arms. He felt doubly grieved at the circumstance, as it would probably be the means of interrupting, if not entirely destroying, the friendly intercourse which had sprung up between him and Evelina, and her uncle, and thos at once annihilating thus _ hopes be had ventured to encourage. Lord Sidley had accidentally met Evelina aa she was returning from the farm, and unable to control hia gui ty passions, and seeing no one about, he seized her and attempted to bear her away to tbe abbey ; but little did he expect such an interruption as that he had experienced. Westbourne Bcarcelyknew wbat to say, in order to express to Evelina his regret at what had taken place, and to try to tranquillise her wounded feelings ; but be at length broke the silence, and implored her not to suffer him to be lessened in her esteem and friendship, through the misconduct of his father, at which he ex pressed his most unbounded indignation aud disgust. CHAPTER XIX. THE QUARREL BETWEEN LORO SIDLEY AND HIS SON. \u2014 THE BLOW. \u2014 THE DEPARTURE FROM THE ABBEY. Evelina, who had become more composed, assured him, with tbe most innocent simplicity, yet energy of manner which bespoke her sincerity, that Bhe could not be so unge werous as to blame him, to whom she was under such a weight of obligation, for the faults of his father; but still she urged the absolute necessity of Westbourne discontinuing his visits to the hall, as It would doubtless excite the displeasure of Lord Sidley if it should reach his knowledge. Westbourne could not deny the truth and force of this argument, but he could not bear to con template the stern necessity, and Evelina might have discovered from the agitation of his manner, that s he had excited a far wanner sentiment than that of mere friendship in his bosom ; nor could she anticipate the interruption of their friendly intercourse without the most sincere and painful regret. To picture the emotions of Westbourne Sidley at tais terrible discovery, which at once seemed to be the annihilation of all his hopes, v. ould indeed be an arduous task. Evelina gently with drew herself from his arms, aud after fixing upon him a look of anguish, she turned aside her head and burst into tears. ' Good God,' exclaimed Westbourne, ' Is it possible thai my father can have been guilty of this unmanly outrage T On, Evelina, how can I look you in the face, after this? \u2014 But I am not to blame. You will not believe me to be sot' ' No, no, Mr. Sidley,' replied our heroine in a voice ol the greatest emotion, while her looks expressed far more than words could give utter ance to ; \u2014 ' 1 do not, cf course not. I cannot attach any blame to jou; it is his lordship, your father. ' And has he indeed Insulted yon, Miss Mars den!' asked Westbourn* eagerly, and bis heart palpitated at double its u\u00bb__l J_W*. 'My God I what would I not have g. -.in 1 ..her than this should have happened.' Before their arrival at the hall, Westbourne had succeeded in so far tranquillising the feeliags of Evelina, that ahe exhibited but little emotion, and he also elicited from her a promise that she would not, for the present, mention the circum stance to Mr. Langaton, as it might only bring him and Lord Sidley into a painful collision, without tending to any beneficial result; and he had no doubt his father would repent of his con duct, and never be guilty of the like offence again. * Oh, suffer me to return how \u2022*/ naid Evelina. ' It was imprudent of me to be &;it so late; but still how could I expect to be thus amnoyed, and especially from one who \u2014 but I will not reproach him ; be must have been mad at the time he dared to shock my ears with Ms odious declara tions, and will surely repent his conduct. I will return home, for my uncle will begin to be alarmed at ray absence.' Mr. Langston had begun to feel alarmed at the protracted absence of Evelina, and he was there fore much gratified when she returned, aud thanked Westbourne for bis kindness in conduct ing her home. He did not notice the agitation of her manner, _ud thus both Evelina and West- ' You will suffer me to escort you thither, Evelinas' said Westbourne, with looks that showed the regret, resentment, and anguish"], [135, "OR, POVERTY, CRIME, AND SORROW. 127 \"ourne were spared the disagreeable task of evad ing the questions he would otherwise have put to them. Westbourne did not remain long at the hall, first instance, she would now have been in my power, and my triumph would have been complete ; but still there is no risk that I will Bhrink from encountering, sooner than that she shall escape me.' aud when he took his leave he exchanged a look with Evelina which she was at uo loss to under stand , and she fervently responded to the feelings which she was convinced at that moment agitated his bosom. He was so completely absorbed in these guilty meditations, that he had unconsciously strayed from the right road, and on looking up, he was surprised to find himself close to Ihe residence of Stephen Blackthorn, and he therefore determined to call upon him so tbat he might make him ac quainted with what had happened, and receive his advice. When Evelina retired to her chamber, how ever, she gave free indulgence to the emotions which struggled in her breast, and her tears flowed fast and unrestrained. That she should have been so grossly insulted, and that too by the father of Westbourne, to whom Bhe was so much indebted, created iu her bosom the most poignant anguish, at the same time that Bhe felt tbe greatest apprehensions for the future. That Lord Sidley would so readily abandon any designs upon which he had fixed his mind, sbe could not belive, and she, therefore, feared that she might at some future time be subjected to some fresh an - noyance from him. Sbe felt satisfied tbat her uncle ought to be made acquainted with his conduct, in order that he might guard her against him, and yet she could not think of breaking the pro mise she had made to Westbourne not to reveal what bad taken place to Mr. Langston. He found Stephen alone, and he was much surprised at beholding his lordship, and Inquired to what he might attribute the honour of his visit. 'To rage, and disappointment,' replied the nobleman, walking into the room, and flinging himself on a seat. 'Ah!' exclaimed Stephen, 'and what is the matter now, my lord ?' Lord Sidly, in as few word [as possible, related to Blackthorn the adventure of the evening, and that ruffian listened to him with evident dissatis faction. ' What folly was it in you to make such an attempt, my lord,' he observed. Much Evelina feared also, that the circumstance might be the cause of a serious qnarrel between Westbourne and his father ; and most deeply would she regret being the cause of any difference between them, which might be the means of ruining the future prospects of Westbourne. These thoughts kept her waking nearly the whole of the nigh, and she felt astonished and alarmed to find the interest which Westbourne held in her bosom. His numerous virtues were exhibited In still more glowing colours than ever to her imagination, and when she reflected that they might probably meet but seldom again, she could not restrain her tears, and acknowledge to herself that the friendship and esteem of West bourns were most indespensable to her peace of mind. ' Ay, I see it now,' returned his lordship, 'but It is no use regretting it, it is done, and it cannot be undone. On meeting the girl, my passion got the better of my reason, and seeing that there was no one at hand, I thought th_t I might be able to force her to the abbey.' ' A most preposterous idea,' said Blackthorn ; ' you might have felt certain that it could not succeed. Why could you not wait with patience, until I bad au opportunity of putting my plans into executions' * My patience is exhausted.' * This rash impetuosity will only serve to retard if not to frustrate the execution of our designs. You bave discovered yourself, my lord, and it is most probable that suspicion will attach to you in future. And then to be seen by your own son.' The rage and disappointment of Lord Sidley aftei leaving the spot where he had been surprised by his son, may be easily conceived : and for some minutes he oould only give ntterance to the most bitter imprecations. 'Curses li_ht nnon him,' exclaimed Lord Sidley, passion- tely 'it seems as if he were always doomed to b \u25a0 an obstacle to the further ance of my plans. Hut nomething must be done to quiet him, and to p. ivent his intimacy with Evelina.' ' And am I to be thwarted in all my designs by this officious, headstrong boy V he soliloquised. \u2022 What cursed accident brought him to the spot at such a critical time . He has now dis covered my intentions, and I have no doubt he will be bold enough to attempt to frustrate them. The girl has evidently captivated him, and there is nothing, I am convinced, that he will hesitate to do in her defence. But It will be my fault if he succeeds ; no, be shall either consent to be come the husband of Miss Norman, or I will adopt such a course towards him as he little ex pects, aod take effectual means to prevent him from being any obstacle to the gratification of my wishes. And yet it was foolish of me to make this attempt to-night when I might be sure that Evelina's cries would create an alarm. They will now be on their guard, and the execution of my plot will be retarded, if not entirely defeated. Had the girl been conveyed to the abbey In the * Ay, I am certain tuat he loves her,' remarked Blackthorn. ' What are your intentions with regard to him ?' ' To compel him. to marry Miss Norman,' an swered Lord Si_L>, ' or to discard him.' 'But that will not prevent him from paying his attentions to Evelina, but on the contrary, it will render him the more determined. Nothing in my opinion can be done with him without removing him a together. Now If you could per suade him tu go to sea or to enter the army, I think it would be the most advisable.' ' I will think further ou that subject. But have you nothing to suggest \u2014 no plan by which I may get the girl in my power ?' ' Nothing at present,' returned Blackthorn, 'and I would advise you to affect to be stung with remorse at your conduct towards Evelina,"], [136, "EVELINA, THE PAUPER'S CHILD. 128 and to make an ample apology to old Paul Lang ston, shoull he demand satisfation ; by that means you may lull suspicion, and thus we may be able the better to carry our designs into opera tion.' * I will do as you advise,' said his lordship, ' but still I shall be all impatience until the girl is safe within my clutches, and I care not what sacrifice I make so that I can but accomplish my desires. Hare you seen your colleagues lately V 1 1 saw them not more than an hour ago.' ' And are they still ready to act when they are called upon?' ' Oh, yes, there is no fear of them, especially while you continue to act with liberality towards them.' ' That I shall not fail to do. But you must keep a strict eye upon them/ ' Ay, ay, I shall do so, certainly, but they will not attempt te deceire me, so you may rest your mind easy on that subject.' Lord Sidley remained Bilent for some moments, and it was evident from his lowering brow, and tbe whole of his demeanour, that some dark thought was passing inhis mind. ' Blackthorn,' he said, at length, in under tones, as if he feared that tbe<e might be Borne listeners at hand, 'an idea bas suggested itself to me, which, if carried into effect, would at once obtain for us both the gratification of our wishes, namely, you the possession of Langston's wealth, and I the girl. ' Ah,' demanded Stephen, eagerly, ' what is it ?' ' May I trust you?' ' Why should you ask such a question * Hare you not known and tried me long enough to trust me?' * True, true,' said Lord Sidley, ' but the sug gestion I hare to make is of such a peculiar nature that I almost fear to gire utterance to it.' ' Do not hesitate, my lord, for you know that you hare nothing to tear from me, if eren I do not approve of it.' ' Weil then,' eaid the guilty nobeman, after another pause, ' to come at once to the point, old Paul Langston is the principal obstacle In the way of the gratification of our desires.' ' Right, be is so.' ' It he were removed?' added Lord Sidley, in a hoarse voice, and seemingly almost afraid to give expression to bis thoughts. 1 Ab 1' ejaculated Blackthorn, apparently partly guessing at his meaning. ' If he were removed,' Lord Sidley went on to say, ' Evelina would be left without a protector, the fortune of old Langston would become yours, I might get the damsel iu my power without diffi culty, aud \u2014 aud \u2014 and \u2014 do you not understand me, Blackthorn ?' * Not exactl',' replied the latter, determined tbat his loidship should fully explain himself. ' How would you remove the old inau ?' *A;e there not plenty of means?' demanded Lord Sidley with a fiendish look; \u2022 are tl.ere no subtle poisons, no ' 1 Ah 1' interrupted Stephen, grasping his arm, and looking him steadfastly in the face, \u2014 ' surely, my lord, you would not hare him murdered ?' ' His death would remove all tbe difficulties in our way, and the deed might be perpetrated without any suspicion lighting upon the authors of it.' ' No, no,' said Blackthorn, with affected horror, 'you may deem me a villain, but I cannot shed human blood.' * Bah I you are not the man I took you to be. One bold resolution, and your fortune would be made, whereas while Paul Laogeton lives, there seems to me but little hope of the accoinpliBh ment of our wishes.' ' This is a subject, my lord, tbat requires the greatest deliberation,' said Stephen, 'and we will talk further on it at some future period.' ' There may be the greatest danger in delay.' ' And it would be worse than madness to be too precipitate,' returned Blackthorn. * Besides, I have not the least doubt but that I ehsll be able to accomplish our designs without having occasion to resort to any sueh desperate means.* ' You will never dirulge a word of the conrer sation which has this night paBsed between us V Baid Lord Sidley, win a look of alarm, and fear ing that he bad almost ventured too far, and had placed himself to much in the power ot Black thorn. 1 1 have given you my word,' answered the latter; 'you hare nothing to fear from me. Only act yourself with prudence and precaution, and all will he right.' Lord Sidley still looked doubtfully, bnt he said nothing, aud after some more conversation, he took his departure. ' So,' said Blackthorn, when he was gone ; ' you hare only exposed to me your real character, my Lord Sidley ; and have confirmed all the Buspl ciona I entertained of you. You would commit murder, would you, to gratify your desires f \u2014I have you In my power, most virtuous nobleman, and will not fail to take advantage of It. Yes, I may even be compelled to take the old man's Use if I cannot accomplish my ends in any other way, but you must not know it. Ob, no, Stephen Black thorn is too cautious to entrust any one with secrets of that description.' Thus the villain continued to ruminate for some time, and the longer be reflected, the more determined he became. Lord Sidley returned to tbe abbey in a most bewildered and disturbed state of mind, and in spite of all, he could not help dreading to eucoun ter bls son, for he felt that he should have no argument against his reproaches, and that he must appear both contemptible and degraded ln hia eyes. He regretted that he bad Bald so much to Stephen Blackthorn, for by so doing he had placed himself more than ever in his power, and be knew full well that he would not hesitate to take erery adrantage of it to suit his owh purpose, \u2014 and should tin;/ a any time quarrel, he might be plunged U> to tuu ys isa test danger in consequence.

Evelina wa\u00ab walking in the little garden at the back of the hall, and on beholding Westbourne approaching, ahe exhibited conainersble conrusion, although it was quite evident that she beheld him with pleasure, as she was most anxious to bear .0. 17."], [138, "130 EVELINA, THE PAUFER'S CHILD; I lament the consequences that are likely to follow.' could not help thinking that something bad occurred t. disturb him; thoagh he did not, of cou-se, take the liberty oi questioning him ou the subject. * It will certainly be much to be regretted,' returned Helen ; 'but still you will have nothing to reproach yourself with, as it waB mere acci dent that .rought Westbourne to the spot; and it was fortunate that it was so, or Heaven unly knows the other insults to which you might have been subjected. It is impossible that Lord Sidley can defend his conduct, aud therefore be may bo more likely to yield to the justice aud force of hiB son's remonstrances, who has acted only as any man of honour would have done. It was fortunate that Westbourne recognised his father In time, or be might bave proceeded to violence, and felled him to the earth.' Evelioa endeavoured to appear as easy as pos sible, but it was not without the greatest difficulty that she could do so when she reflected upon all that bad taken place, and the probability of the quarrel that would ensue between Westbourne and his father, io consequence. Westbourne did not leave the hall until the afternoon; and it w_s with a sad heart tbat Eve lina eaw him depart ; for she fearful that he wou d not be permitted to repeat his visit many more times, and she now found that his society waa more necessary to her happi ness than she could ever have anticipated, and that she was already beginalug to view him with a much warmer sentiment than that of fiieodshlp. It was not wonderful indeed that a young man of Westbourne's personal and intrinsic merits, should quickly make a powerful impres sion upon a heart so susceptible as that of Evelina ; and Mr. Langston had not failed to notice the pleasure she evinced in his society, and the melancholy which always pervaded her mind whenever be took his departure from the hall. With a feeling of regret he noticed this, for much as he admired the virtues of Westbourne, and greately indented to him as he wa\u00ab for the preser vation of his beloved niece, he was still the son of Lord Sidley, and as such he could never give any encouragement to those sentiments which he and Evelina ml .ht form for each other. Evelinaendeavoured to think that Westbourae and his lordship might yet be able to settle this painful and unexpected a_f_lr amicably, and that Lord Sidley would be awakend to a sense of the disgustiug criminality of his conduct, and aban don any sinister thoughts which he might have encouraged for the future; but this was a task more easily suggested than accomplished, and our heroine could not still help entertaining some apprehensions of the dangers which might b.aet her from his lordBhip, and the consequences which might result to Westbonrne from his father's displeasure. Evelina, however, stifled her feelings as much as possible, in order that they might escape the observation of ber uncle ; for she considered that under all tbe circumstances, it was more prudent to act upon the advice of Westbourne, and not to bring Mr. Langston and his lordship into collision. Soon after Westbourne had departed, Helen arrived at the hall, and the two damsels being left together, Eveiina related the painful adven ture of the preceding night, to which Helen listened with much astonishment, and feelings of indignation against Lord Sidley. Westbourne had not long returned to the abbey, and bad sought his own apartments, than he received a peremptory summons from his father to attend him in his study. He had folly prepared himself for the Interview, and he therefore immediately obeyed, and entered tbe room with a cool and collected demeanour, and found his lordship pacing the apartment with disordered steps, and on beholding him, he turned upon him astern look, yet tbe expression of his countenance, Westbourne could not fall to remark, was somewhat confused and abashed, aod his lips quivered, as if with ill- subdued rage. ' He must indeed be a villain, my dear Evelina,* said Helen, ' to offer so cruel an insult to an innocent and unprotected female ; and it is only proper that your uncle should be made acquainted with it, in order that he might demand a satisfac tory ap Jlogy from his lordship, and be on his guard to protect you against him in future.' ' For the 6ske of Westbourne, whose feelings are already sufficiently wounded, I will forbear to say anything to my u .cle on the subject,' returned our heroine. ' But surely Lord Sidle, must by this time be heartily ashamed of his conduct, especially as it Ib known to hit son, and will not attempt to offend in a like manner agaiu.' Westbourne met his glance with a steady eye, and awaited hia speaking. Lord Sidley, however, continued to gaze at his son with a contracted brow, and the latter at last, growing impatient, determined to break the silence, . nd he therefore said in a firm but respectful tone\u2014 ' I hope, Evelina,' said her companion, ' tbat you may not be deceived ; but alter hiB lordah p having acted in such a manner, you have reason to be in constant dread ot him. it seems but too true that the teports that are circulated to his disadvantage are not without foundation, and that he is indeed an abandoned ptofligate and Lbertine. How much is it to be regretted that so amiable a young man as Westbourne Sidley shouid bave so unworty a fat! er.' ' You sent for me, my lord V 4 Ay, boy,' replied bis, lordship, and he frowned more severely as he spoke. 'I sent for you to demaud au explanation of your conduct, and to demand atonement for the i nsuit you have offered me.' ' Insult, my lords' returned Westbourne, with swelling pride, aud looking with shame aud surprise upon bis father. * 1 de not understand you; neither have I any explanation to offer.

' I deny it,' returned Westbourne, warmly, and his cheeks glowing with insulted pride ; ' I would never so far degrade myself as to become the secret spy upon the actions of any man, especially tbat man my own father. It was accident that led me to the spot, at tbe critical moment when Evelina Marsden was struggling In your grasp ; and I had no idea, I could not possibly entertain the least suspicion that it was your lordship, until I beheld your countenance. Ob, my father! surely you must feel the deepest remorse for having thus committed yourself, and wounded the delicacy of an innocent maiden. You could not possibly have done so, I am con vinced, only in a moment of madness ; and \u2014 \u2014 ' Westbourne Sidley trembled with excitement as he listened with breathless impatience to the observations of bis father. He could scarcely credit the evidence of bis ears ; and so numerous and torturing were the feelings that rushed into his bosom, that, for a few moments, they com* pletely choked bis utterance. ' Beware, headstrong boy, what you say,' furiously interrupted Lord Sidley, and the calm diguity of Westbourne's manner added to his shame, confusion, and indignation. ' Am I to be thua schooled by my own offspring ?' 4 My lord,' be said at last. ' I am your son, and as such am ready to yield all that obedience to you which duty and justice demand. But reason and manly pride revolt at such oppression. I will never become tbe slave of any man's ty rannical will.' ' I bave ever, and would still, my lord, behave to you with every respect; but when I find you thuB degrading yourself, wounding the feelings of a defenceless female, and bringing disgrace upon your own name, justice compels me to speak out boldly the sentiments of my mind, painful though it is to my feelings to be con strained to do so.' 1 By hell 1' hoarsely cried hls lordship, * this Is more than I can endure.

' Oh, shame, shame, my lord, to give ut tt ranee to such vile aspersions on the honour and virtue of that lamented parent whose cold remains now moulder in the tomb.' .

Lord Sidley quailed beneath the bitter but just teproacbes of his son, and his lips quivered with tbe power of his increasing wrath. \u25a0Presumptuous wretch I' he e- claimed, ' will you still dare to defy and taunt me?

A disagreeable ironical expression passed over tbe features of Lord Sidley, as he gave utterance to these coarse and vulgar observations. But how did the bosom of hit son ewell with honest resentment as be li.tend to them! He cast -pon his father a look of tbe keenest reproach, as he replied \u2014 'By Heaven, 'tis false, most cruelly false!' replied Westbourne, unable any longer to res train the full express. on of hia indignation, and rendered almost mad by the base Blanders cast upon Evelina by his father.

But still he was determined that nothing should In- duce him to give up his designs against Evelina, for the disappointments he had hitherto expe rienced only served to strengthen hia desires. The blood mantled ln the face of Westbourne, bis brain aeemed to whirl round, his broad and manly chest heaved with emotion, he set his teeth close together, and compressed his lips, then he clenched his fists, and made two or three steps towards his father ; but, in a moment, he seemed to recollect himself, and with dignified resentment, he ejaculated\u2014 ' A blow, a degrading blow I Am I a man, and \u2022hall I not resent it I But, no, although you have discarded me, my 1 jrd, csst me from you, treated me worse than a dog, I will not forget that you are the author of my being, and forgive you. \u2022> Farewell, sir; perhaps, wheu we meet again, if that should ever he, you will bo ready lo acknowledge the injustice with which yon have treated me, and lo repent of your present conduct.' He waa interrupted in these reflections by the arrival of Stephen Blackthorn, who entered the apartment, and fixed an earnest look upon hia lordship's countenance. 'You have arrived very opportunely, Black thorn,' said Lord Sidle;,; \u2022 I wish to consult you.\" Thus saying, the young man fixed upon hia father ono look of bitter reproach, and abruptly qu tied the room.

' Mr. Westbourne has only thi. minute quitted the abbey, my lord, attended by Philip hia groom,' answered the servant. < Ay, I would not that we should part in the manner we have 'lone.' ' Why, I thought you would have been glad to have got rid of him on any terms, especially when he presented such au obstacle to the gratification of your designs against Evelina.' ' Ah I' ejaculated bis lordship with some emo tion, ' then it is probably too late. But hasten, and endeavour to overtake him, and tell him that it ls my earnest desire that he should return without delay. ' And he may alill prove an obstacle, and that, too, a more effectual one, since he may keep a strict watch over the ea'ety of Evelina, without our being able to discover him, and to guard against his plans.' ' My young master left on horsnback, youi lord ship,' remarked the servant. ' Th.u you mount a horse also, and use every means jou can to discover tha route he has taken.' ' Nay,' remarked Stephen, ' he must be more ingenious than I take him to be, if he is enabled to frustrate my designs. But let me know the particulars of your Interview, and then I shall be better able to come to a decision in what manner, it will be advisable to proceed.' Lord Sidley complied with this request, and Blackthorn listened to him with a dissausfied ex. pression of countenance. The servant bowed aud left the room ; and for some time after he wa. gone, Lord Sidley tra. versed (he apartment iu a state of the greatest excitement. CHAPTER XX. ' My lord,' he said, when he had concluded, ' you suffered your rage to go too far, and by doing ao betrayed too much of your designs to Westbourue.'

'True, ture, but it cannot be helped now.' Should Westbourne return, I might contrive some means of effecting a reconciliation with him, and thus quieting hiB suspicions.'

But surely Westbourne bad not incurred the eternal displeasure of his father, surely he could not have abandoned his home for ever, and sacrificed all his suture prospects? She dared not think so, for that would have made her, indeed, truly wretched. And should she never behold Westbourne again I A feeling of apprehension came over ber tbat she should not ; and with tbat Impression was couple a feeling of tbe most poignant regiet and anguish. She now mote than ever felt the influence that Westbourne had gained over her mind, and bis numerous virtues were presented more vividly to her recol lection. 'He can never so: get tbe blow that I struck him/ returned his lordship; ' his manly spirit will not suffer him to brook that Insult. Be sides, he has a small fortune at his command, from his mother's family, which tenders him in a manner independent of me.' \u2022You should bave thought of that before, said Blackthorn ; * but still I do not see that you bave any cause to regret bis departure, and I will take especial care that be shall not prevent the execution of our plans, that is, if you will entrust everything to me, and do not again attempt to act without my ad vi e.' 'I will be guided entirely by you In future, Blackthorn/ said Lord Sidley. ' Enough ; then I will undertake to promise every success/ The servant who had been sent In pursuit of Westbourne now returned, and informed his master that he could trace nothing of him ; and after some further conversation on the subject, Stephen Blackthorn took hia leave. In the morning Helen came to the hall, and as she bad already beard of tbe departure of West bourne from the abbey, and that he bad not yet returned, neither had anything been heard of him, she was more prepared to consult with and console Evelina upon the subject. She endea voured to convince our heroine that an am icab.e understanding would soou bo effected between Westbourne and his fatber, and that, let the result be whatever it might, sbe, at any rate, had nothing whatever to reproach herself with. Evelina made a strong effort to tranquilllse her feelings, and she at last succeeded much better tban might have been expected, and tried to await the issue of his unfortunate affair with patience and hope. Evelina passed the whole of that night and the greater part of the day following in a state ot considerable anxiety to know what bad been the result of the meeting between Westbourne Sidley and his father, and she formed various conjec tures as to tbe time wben it might be likely tbat ahe should behold him again. But at the eve ning advanced, her uneasiness increased, as she had fully expected that Westbourne would have paid a visit to the ball before tbat time. While she was still in this state of mind, Stephen Blackthorn came to tbe hall, and in the course of tbe conversation that ensued between him and Mr- Langston, he mentioned tbat a serious quarrel bad ensued between Loid Vernon Sidley and his sou, upon what subject he knew not, aud that, Inconsequence, Westbourne had abruptly quitted tho abbey, it was anticipated, for ever. We have described the feelings of offended pride and indignation with whicb Westbourne quitted the presence of hls father, and they were not the least abated when he gained his own apartment. To be struck, abused, and to hear the character of Evelina calumniated, was more, far more than be could brook with patience, and let whatever might be tbe consequences to him self, he determined not to remain at the abbey another hour ; and he therefore immediately packed up what articles of leweilery and ready caih he possessed, and summoning his faithful gioom, Philip, he left the abbey ln a few minutes after he had retired from the room where the quarrel had ensued between him and Lord Sidley. He was reckless what road he took, as he had yet no fixed place of destination ; but to leave Evelina to the mercy of his lather, aud with the probability that be might never behold ber again, excited tbe bitterest anguleh in his breast. He recalled to his memory tbe observations which Lord Sidley had made use of after he bad rescued Evelina from tbe ruffians, and he now began to suspect that be had been the author of that base plot ; and if b uch was the fact, ihere waB nothing, he was certain, tbat he would hesitate to do to accomplish his wishes. Evelina tamed ghastly pale when she heard this, aud sbe could scarcely repress a scream ; but perceiving the dark and penetrating eye of Black thorn fixed upon ber with a peculiar expression, ahe struggled with her feelings as well as she could, and endeavoured to appear as composed as possible. Mr. Langston expressed much regret at this occurrence, and warmly eulogised tbe character of Westbourne, to whom he felt himself so greatly indebted ; and Blackthorn affected to reciprocate his opinion, althoogh his sincerity might have been reasonably doubted by any one who had narrowly watched him. One moment he was half Inclined to make hls way to the hall, in order to make Evelina acqsin ted with w bat had happened, and to bid her fare well ; but he feared that the anguish ofthe part ing would cause him to betray the ieal stale of his mind, and cause her the greatest uneasiness, and he, therefore, determined to abandon tbe Idea Wben Evelina retired to her chamber for the night, she could no longer restrain her feelings, but gave vent to them In a copious flood osteus."], [142, "134 EVELINA, THE PAUPER'S CHILD ; Sbe became every day more sad, and her uncle could not but notice the chaDgo in ber spirits, and interrogated her anxiously upon the . ubject ; but she contrived to evade Mb questions, and aud to leave the disclosure to some future oppor tunity.

To ; Helen, however, she hesitated _\u00bbt to communi i cate her thoughts ; and was even constrained indi- rectlyto acknowledge what her fair friend had been confident of before, namely, that Westbourne had Westbourne coveted not the title and riches of his father; bis wishes were bumble and unam bitious, and, as has been already shown, he inherited a small fortune independent of his father, which was mote than sufficient to gratify all his wantB. inspired her with a far more ardent sentiment than tbat of mere siiendihip. Hthn pitied ber for having imbibed a passion wbich at present I seemed so unlikely ever to be gratified, and tried j to banish such thoughts from her bosom. H.ivirg come to this determination, Westbourne urged on bis horse, reflecting deeply upon the melancholy change in his circumstances, and looking forward with the most dismal foreboding to the future. To think ihac she should bave been tbe cause of Westbourne's banishment from his tome, and probably of incurring his father's future displea sure, afflicted Evelina more than all, and Bincerely did Bhe regret that they had eye en countered each other, o\\ that ber deliverance from Lord Sidley had not been effected by any other person. Ou his way be passed near the hall, and as he caught aglinapBe of its ivy-mantled walls through au opening in the trees, he was once more half disposed to visit it, and to seek a patting Interview wi.h Evelina ; but again reflecting upon tbe emotion it might cause (hem both, he changed his mind, and with a deep Bigh, and mentally invoking a blessing on our heroine's head, and supplicating Heaven to protect her from the machinations of her enemies, he hurried on bis way, and gave himself up entirely to the dismal thoughts which crowded on bis mind. Diy after day she became more melancholy, and Helen had the greatest difficulty in arouBing her at ali from it. Mr. LangBton, too, also observe^ her increasing sadness and depression of spirits with alarm, and again questioned her upon the eu.ject ; hut, as before, sbe evaded his inquiries, and he had no suspicion of the cause from which her angush arose. Darkness having set in, and being fatigued, Westbourne put up at the first respectable inn he anived at for tbe night ; and after having par taken of a slight repast, he retired to the chamber prepared for him, and endeavoured to obtain some repose, but for some hours all his efforts were useless. Mr. Langston himself admired Westbourne Sidley for his numerous ma ly virtues, and while be regretted tbe quarrel be ween him and bis father, be felt somewhat surprised and mor tified th. t he had not called at tbe hall previous to his departure from the neighbourhood, to bid them adieu, especially after the friendship he had ever evinced towards him. Stephen Black thorn, who now became a daily visitor to tbe hal., noticed with exultation the sorrow which Evelina was enduring , and now that Westbourne w_s out of the way, he resolved to lose no time iu putting his designs against her into execution. Lord Vernon Sidley was still very anxious to behold his son again, and to bring about a recon ciliation with him, notwithstanding all that Black thorn had said; but wheu three days elapBed, and he did not return, _nd be could obtain no information respecting him, he began to think tbat he had really abandoned his home for ever, and bis conscience was stung with remorse for the manner in which he had behaved towards him. He was ><1bo much surprised that Mr. Langston had not sought an explanation from him, for hiB conduct towards Evelina, and was at last conduced tbat she had not made ber uncle acquainted with it; wbich supposition waB corroborated by Stephen Blackthorn, who from all he had elicited in bis vi.its to the hall was satisfied that Mr. Langston was ignorant of it ; still Lord Sidley was fully determined not to abandon his designs again&t Evelina, but to leave no means untried to get her In his power. He frequently thought of the suggestion of his lordship to tak- the old man's life, but although he so greatly coveted his wealth, and was well aware that th it would be tbe readiest means of obtaining it, he shrank with teror from the deed, and was resolved to try every means which stratagem and artifice could devise to achieve his object, rather than be guilty of so hideous a crime. The charms of Helen also held more powerful influence than ever over the mind of Blackthorn, and he determined that te would posaesss her at any risk. He well knew how to play tbe hypocrite, and therefore exerted all his art to insinuate himself in ber favour. He was constant in his attentions to her, and took great pains to convince her of the sentiments which ebe had inspired in his boiom ; but be was not long in discovering that Helen \\ie*ed him wiih suspicion and fear, if not with absolute averBion, and took every means to _v_id his society; but this, while it mortified his vanity, at the same time lie eased his determination, arm he had not the lea.t doubt but that he Bhould ultimately succeed. As day after day passed away, and Westbourne remained absent from the abbey, and no tidings conld be gained aa to whither he had gone, our heroine became more melancholy, anxious, and untasy ; and it was only in the society ot Helen that she could find any relief; lor she was fearful tbat her uncle should discover the secret that agitated her bosom, now that he was aware of the c.uappearance of Westbourne. Nor could ehe help feeing a sensation of regret and disappoint* ; ment that Westbourne should have .eft bis home, ; without bo much as saying to her one friendly word at parting. Helen, from the first moment she beheld Ste phen Blackthorn, had conceived the greatest"], [143, "t\" OR, POVERTY, CRIME, AND SORROW. 135 dislike towards him. Her penetrating eye soon discovered that beneath all his specious exterior lurked the villain, and the account she afterwards heard of his former depraved and dissolute con duct, prejudiced her still more against him, therefore it may readily be imagined bow hurt and annoyed she felt by his cold advances, and tbe uneasiness she experienced whenever she was in his society. entertained no very ardent feelings towards me, or surely he could not have departed without seeing me, to utter at least one word of fare well.1 She sighed as this painful thought suggested itself to her, aud she could scarcely refrain from tears. ' But still/ she added, after a pause, ' I can never forget the attention and esteem be evinced towards me : and I am certain that his mind Ib too noble, too honourable to aot tbe hypocrite. Wuuld tbat I could once more behold him, or could leart what has become of him. Oi, West bourne, I may endeavour, but in vain, to deny the influence you have g.ined over my heart; and why should I be ashamed to acknowledge those sentiments wh ch are created by one of the noblest and most ami_b1e of human beings f* She took no pains to conceal from him the feelings she entertained towards him, hoping that It might at once annihilate any ambitious and presumptuous thoughts he bad encouraged ; but Stephen was not the man to be easily abashed or diverted from any object on which he had Axed his mind, and the colder Bhe became the more ardent were his attentions and the more frequent were his visits to the farm. Her tears fell fast as she uttered these words, and when Bhe recollected tbat Westbourne was the son of Lord Sidley, the enem. of her unfor tunate father, tbe primary cause of all his miBeries, the utc.ost anguish and despair settled upon her heart. Helen's parents also had but an indifferent opinion of Blackthorn, and were by no means anxious to cultivate bis friendship, but as he was related to Mr. Langston ; they felt bound to treat him with respect, and consequently tbe greater opportunity was afforded him of advancing his object. She reflected npon the awful destiny of her father, susseing under the stigma of a murderer, and dragging out a wretched lite of slavery aud degradation in a foreign land, aud the picture that ber tortured imagination thus drew was almost too horrible for contemplation. Well sbe remembered the fatal night, when, cold and perishing she and her poor mother, were anxi ously awaiting his return ; and ail the subsequent events ; the trial and coodemnation of her lather ; the removal of her and ber mother to the work house ; the melancholy death of that best of parents, and the years of misery she (Evelina) had afterwards endured, crowded upon her brain with overwhelming force. Westbourne bad now been gone nearly a month, and Lord Sidley not having been able to learn anything of him, concluded at once that he bad indeed left him for ever. He bad not expected that be would have taken such a deter mined course, aod it was a source of much anno- ance and confusion to him. The deceitful part behai acted towards Admiral Norman and his niece was fully exposed ; for Westbourne had dispatched a respectful letter to the former, in which he related the whole affair, and declared that he had never for a moment given his consent to an alliance with Miss Morman. The admiral was naturally exasperated at tbe duplicity with which Lord Sidley had acted, and the gross insnlt offered to his niece, and he immediately repaired to the abbey and demanded satisfaction. A hostile meeting was the conse quence, in which the admiral was so severely wounded that his life was despaired of. And was her father still in existence ? She fervently hoped that Heaven had released him from his sufferings, for to her it seemed quite eertain he was ost for ever. Such were the thoughts which continued to torture Evelina, and she found it impossib.e to arouse herself from them, although she exerted herself to the utmost to do so, aud Helen also used her most powerful efforts for the same purpose. Lord Sidley, alarmed, tbooght it advisable to fly from the neighbourhood until the result should be known ; but before he did so he had an interview with Stephen Blackthorn, and arranged a plan of communication with him, at the same time urging him to prosecute his designs against Evelina with increased zeal, which we need not say Blackthorn promised to do mo t ialthfuliy. Now tbat Lord Sidley had left the abbey, and not apprehending any danger, Evel ina re. sumed her customary walks, in which she was usually accompanied by Helen; and those little excursions relieved her mind more than any thing. The departure of Lord Sidley from the abbey afforded Evelina much satisfaction, for she was in hopes tbat she should not only be relieved from any further annoyance from him, but that Westbourne would return, and that ahe would again behold him. It was on a beautiful summer's day that Evelina and Helen had just left tbe hall, and were about to proceed to one of their favourite spots, when they beheld a livery servant mounted on horseback, riding at great speed towards them. They paused, and on his approaching nearer, Evelina could not help giving utterance to a mingled cry of joy and surprise when Bhe recognised Philip, the groom of Westbourne. Her heart trembled, and she leant upon the arm of Helen for support. The next moment the groom rode up to them, and stopped, and bending respectfully to them both, he drew forth a letter from his pocket, and handing it to Evelina, he rode away without uttering a word, aud bei. re Days, however, passed away, and still West* bourne Sidley came not back to the abbey, and Evelina's anguish and disappointment became almost insupportable ; and even the gentle arguments of Helen failed to console her. 1 And yet/ she would say to herself, when Bhe was alone; 'why should I encourage these thoughts? \u2014 Is it not mighty imprudent of me to do bo?

No language can portray the emotions of Evelina while Helen was perusing tbe melancholy epistle, which left them still in a state of com plete ignorance as to where the unfortunate Westbourne was ; but no sooner had Helen come to tbe conclusion of it, than she uttered a deep sigb, ana immediately tainted away. But what could he have to say to her ? And ought she Indeed io receive any communications from him, without the consent of her uncle ? Tbe letter in her hand, she looked up in the countenance of ber fair companion for advice. Helen understood perfectly well the thoughts which wete passing iu her mind, and wbat she would Bay, and she observed \u2014 CHAPTER XXI. THE SUFFERINGS OP EVELINA. \u2014 THE niSCOVERT 'Dear Evelina, I know your feelings, and duly appreciate tbem; but looking upon Mr. Sidley only as a friend, there can be no harm in perus ing his epistle, and it will relieve you, no doubt, from a world of anxiety by making you ac quainted where he Is, and wbat are his inten tions.' OF HER LOVE DT MR. LANGSTON . TUE ADVENTURES OF WESTBOUi.NE SIDLEY. Helen was in a state of great alarm at the situation of Evelina, and tried all that was hi ber powerto restore her to sensibility, but it was some time ere sbe succeeded. At length, however, the poor girl did revive, but was eo greatly agitated, that Helen knew noi: what to Bay to trai quilll-0 her. With a trembling hand, and fluttering heart, Evelina bioke the seal, and unfolded the letter, but her brain was confused, a mist seemed to float before ber eyes, and she could not distin guish a letter. 1 Ob, Helen !' she sighed, ' little did I rxoect this acknowledgment, and how much does it . ffllct me, although my feelings are, I co_fe*s, ln unison with his own, for it can be productive of nothiug but misery to ub both, since we can never hope that our passion will be gratified, aud we may never behold each other again.

Apd be says that he has ruined himself, and rendered himself unworthy of me. What can be the dreadful meaning of his words . Oh, why did be not more clearly explain hin_\u00abelf and not leave me in this agonising state of sus pense? And he is gone, too, Heaven knows whither ; and I shall never see or hear from him again.' 'Deer Helen,' she ejaculated, 'Icsnnot read ft. D .. you peruse it for me, for there is nothing It can contain which 1 should not wish yon to be__r,' Helen took the letter, and she and our heroine having sea ed themselves on a gentle mound, she read the contents of Westbourne's epistle In Ihe following wordt \u2014 ' Fair and amiable Evelina, * Pardon the presumption of the wretched Westtoume in addressing you, but absence and tbe ardour of my feelings render me bold, and 1 cannot longer keep confined to my own breast tbe secret of my Ik art. 4 By tbe time you receive this, I shall be far far away, and as we may never meet again, (for one act of folly baa ruined me, and rendered me almost unworthy of your esteem, although 1 may merit your pity), before Ibid you adieu forever, permit me, most lovely and virtuoua of women, to pour forth in your ear the imperishable and fervent sentiments with whicb you have inspired the bosom of tbe unhappy wanderer. Again Halen tried to comfort her, and to in* spire her with hope, but Evelina's tears slowed fast, and Helen did not offer to interrupt the ebullition of her grief, as sbe hoped that it would tend to relieve her heavily surcharged heart. They continued their walk, Evelina having carefully refolded the letter and deposited it lu her bosom ; and they conversed affectionately and freely upon this most iinportaut aud in teresting subject. 1 And yet my pen falters at the task, and trem bles to proceed. But why should I hesitate, since I seek alone to unberthen my mind, and can never hope to bold a higher place in your memory (if indeed you ever deign to bestow a thought upon me) than that of a friend? And it Is moie than probable tbat we may never meet again. In vain they endeavoured to coujecture what fresh misfortune had befallen Westbourne, aod how it could possibly be of such a nature as to disgrace him. They were satibsled that he was the very soul of honour and iote^rity, and, there - foie, that he must wrongly have accused hioneif, or otherwise toat iu the anguish ot his feelings he>c_rcely knew what he wrote. But su'ely it would have been better hnd he been more explict, and Evelina could not help thinking that it was cruel that he did not give her any information as to where be was to be found, or what w*re bis future intentions. It was leaving her to form all kinds ol feaiiul apptehensious, and yet 'Here then, sweet maiden, I reveal to you my whole heart, aud dare to confess io you that from the first hour I beheld you, tbat heart has owned you fur Us lovely mistress, and that to love and worship your image has been, and i* now the chief, nay, the only solace of my life; and oh, had fortune placed ub in different circumstances, I would even have presumed to encourage that passion with a hope tbat it might meet with a"], [145, "EVELINA, TfiE PAUPER'S CHlLB; OR, POVERTY, CRIME, ANB SORROW. 137 he surely eould not wish to agonize her mind more than he might be certain it was at present. evil consequences descend only npon hi \u25a0 head !

They proceeded in their walk to some distance farther, and Helen still exerted herself to calm the feelings ot her friend, and she at last suc ceeded much better than she could bave antici pated. It was not until late in the afternoon that they returned to the hall, and our heroine felt bo much oppressed with care and anxiety, that it was not without difficulty she coald conceal her emotions from Mr. Langston ; however, at last, by great exertion, she conquered them, and soon afterwards, Helen having taken her leave, she excused herself on the plea of having a preislon of her countenance showed hot* utterly unable her bosom was to receive such hopes. ' Bat ought I to conceal this eommunlcation from my uncle . she said ; ' and yet how can I ever find tbe resolution to make him acquainted with all the particulars, and the stste of my mind?

' The time may come, Evelina,\" said Helen, ' when you may find courage to open your mind to Mr. Langston, but for tbe present make your self easy npon the subject, and rest assured that your uncle loves you too well to reproach you, when yon are absolutely not to blame.

One day, however, as Bhe was passing through the hall, by some accident the precious epistle escaped from her bosom, and fell upon the floor, and shortly afterwards Mr. Langston going that way beheld it, and picked it up. Here Bhe renewed the expression of her an guish without any fear of interruption, and passed several hours ln tbe moe t painful thoughts, psrusing again and again the letter of West bourne, aud watering it with her tears. Then she invoked the blessings of Heaven upon his he_d, and implored the Almighty to protect him from those dangers which she apprehended. But in vain Bhe tried to fathom the mysterious portions of the letter, and to imagine what deed of folly Westbourne could have been guilty of, that he should so bitterly reproach himself, and the longer she ruminated, the greater became her perplexity. He had bidden ber adieu for ever ; what unutterable anguish did tbat part of bis letter convey to her bosom ! She did not dare to believe that tbey should meet no more, for that would have rendered her misery insup portable; and yet, under all circumstances, how much more than probable did it seem. She felt also that she was acting wrong in keeping the letter a secret from ber uncle, and yet sbe could not sind resolution enough to make him acquainted with it, as sbe must then reveal tbe state of her own mind, and she could not deny tbat her affections were devoted to West bourne, and certain she was tha Mr. Langston would never sanction their passion, although she knew that to do anything derogatory to her wishes, would be most painful to his feelings. Wben sleep descended upon her eyelids most torturing were the visions wbich were presented to Evelina's Imagination. She saw Westbourne surrounded by every danger, and sunk in tbe lowest depths of misery and despair. She be held his attenuated form and care-worn visage, and heard the groans of anguish that heaved his bosom ; she saw him encompassed by every borror without tbe chance of escape; and shriek ing with agony, she awoke. Perceiving that it was addressed to Evelina, and written in a masculine hand, his curiosity waB excited, and taking it with him into his study, he unfolded it, and proceeded to read the contents. We need not attempt to describe his astonishment and emotion as be did so, and wheu he bad concluded, he still sat gazing at the letter, as if he could scarcely credit the evidence of his senses. The quarrel between Westbourne and his lordship, and the deep melancholy which Evelina had evinced since the departure of tbe former, particularly the last few days, was now fully explained, and Mr. Langston felt the most extreme regret, as it would probably be produce tive of the greatest misery to both Wesbourne and Evelina, for it was not possible that their wiBhee, if they were in unison, could ever be gratified. But did Evelina really return the love of Westbourne ? Mr. Langston remembered the pleasure she had ever evinced in bis society, and her deep anguish of mind since his disappear* ance from the abbey, and he had not the least doubt that she did, and this conviction filled hia bosom with tenfold uneasiness. Mr. Langston felt the greatest admiration for for amiable qualities of Westbourne Sidley, and deeply sympathised in hiB misfortunes ; but he could not forget that he was the son of Lord Sidley, for whom he had always entertained the greatest abhorrence, and as such he could never, he thought, give his consent to an union between him and Evelina; if even hia loidshlp should b_ willing, which it was not likely that he would. For two or three days after the receipt of Westbourne's letter, Evelina struggled hard with her feelings, and endeavoured to conquer the gloomy fears and presages which distracted her bosom, but in vain, and Mr. Langston beheld with tbe most serious alarm tbe constant mel ancholy in which she was absorbed, and ear nestly entreated her to explain to him tbe cause, for he was certain that some secret and powerful grief pressed upon her spirits, which might be productive of serious consequences, if It were not abated ; bnt he received no satisfactory answers to his questions, though Evelina was frequently half resolved to reveal to him the truth, knowing that be would listen to her with compassionate indulgence; but maiden modesty, and a still more powerful feeling withheld her, and still she cherished the torturing secret within her bosom, although it was pi eying so fatally upon her health and spirits. As olteu as Bhe could, she left the hall in com pany with Helen, and it was on such occasions as these tbat she could alone venture to give free indulgence to her feelings, and met with He waited most anxiously for the return of Evelina, whom he resolved immediately to question as gently as possible upon the subject; but be trusted that if she had indeed imbibed an affection for Westbourne, she would be able to conquer it, convinced as sbe must be, of the impossibility of their ever coming together. * In the meantime, Evelina had missed the letter, and was in a state of much alarm, think- ing she had lost it, and she waa certain that sbe had placed it, as usual, in her bosom before leaving the hall. The letter was, in her fond estimation, of itself a treasure, but should it have fallen into the hands of strangers, bow doubly painful w ould be the circumstance. Such an exposure she would not have for the world, and tbe bare thought of it filled her with terror. But another apprehension flashed across her brain ; should she have dropped it in the hall, it might have been found by her uncle ; and what would be his feelings on reading itB con- tents? Sbe shuddered at the thought, and her emotion was so great, that Helen haa the greatest difficulty in at all traoquiliising her feelings. stould this be the case, her uncle would proba- bly accuse her of want of candour, and what excuse could she offer tor her conduct _ the utmost sympathy from her affectionate com panion. She invariably carried the letter of Westbourne in her bosom, aud often wou.d she re-peruse it,"], [147, "OR, POVERTY, CRIME, AND SORROW. 139 So strongly was thia supposition Impressed npon ber mind, that she almost dreaded to re turn to the ball ; and it was not until Helen had nearly exhausted all her powers of argu ment and persuasion, that sbe could be induced to ventuie home. But she knew well the affec tion which Mr. Lsngbton felt towards her, and was therefore at last convinced that he would treat her with every leniency and indulgence, and sbe retraced her steps towards the hall with fresh fortitude and hope. Helen accompanied her, and on their arrival at the ball, Evelina immediately sought her own apartments, where Bhe commenced a strl.t search after tbe lost letter, thinking it was not unlikely that she might bave dropped it there. On her entrance he arose from his seat, and advanced towards her with hia usual affection, but a melancholy expression was. imparted to hia features by the nature of tbe thoughts which crowded upon his mind. Evelina's heart flut tered, and she trembled, scarcely daring to raise her eyes to her uncle. ' Evelina,' said Mr.Lansjston, In gentle accents, ' I sent to speak wi'h you on a subject of the most serious importance, and one that I fear will likewise prove of the most painful nature, unless you have fortitude to make a bold effort and to banish thoughts which may have entered your breast, but which prudence cannot ssnctlon or encourage.' Evelina's agitation increased, and Mr. Lang ston could feel her band tremble in his, while her countenance became pale and crimsoned with slushes alternately. ' Compose yourtelr, my dear child,' he said, ' I am not going to say anything to you, but wbat is prompted by the affection I bear you, and the anxiety I feel for your happiness and welfare. All tbat I request of you is candour and confi dence, and I am certain tbat my Evelina will not disappoint me in my expectations,' But she searched in vain, and agaiu her an. guish aud alarm were excited to tbe most pain ful degree. 'Alas I alas. I' she sighed, 'that treasured letter, the last I shall probably ever receive from poor Westbourne, is gone for ever ; but could J only know that it had not fallen into any person's hands that would take advantage of the contents, I should be more easy.' Helen was about to make some reply, wben she was interropted by the entrauce of the young female who had been recently hired In addition to Mrs. Snacks to attend upon Evelina, with a message from her master, requesting to see our heroine immediately. The heart of Evelina palpitated violently, and a foreboding ofthe truth flashed across her brain. * Ob, my dear uncle,' ejaculated Evelina In a voice of deep emotion, ' you have ever been most kind to me; you are the only friend and pro tector I have upon earth, and I fear that I have not appeared sufficiently grateful for the weighty obligations I am under to you. Tell me, then, in what I have erred, that I may make atone ment, and I solemnly declare that I will never in future do anything without your counsel and approbation.' 'You tremble, my dear friend,' said Helen, 'as if you had committed some unpardonable error. Come, come, do not give way to this emotion, for which I can see no sufficent cause.' ' Erred, Evelina 1' said Mr. Langston, * oh, no, think not that I am thus going so unjustly to accuie you. You have ever been most kind, gentle, obedient, aod grateful, and Heaven knowa that even were you my own offspring, I could not love you more fondly than I do. But to the subject on which I requested to see you. In crossing tbe hall this morning, I picked up this letter. It ia addressed to you, and is from that UDfortnDate young man, Westbourne Sid ley/ ' Ab, Helen,' returned the damsel, ' I feel satisfied that the letter has fallen into my uncle's hands, and I dread to meet him.' 'And why .hould you do eo, Evelina? Surely, although Mr. LaDgston may lrom particular motives object to enconrage the sentiments wbich you and Westbourne entertain for each otber, you need not beaihamed to acknowledge a passion which is devoted to a worthy and amiable object.' 'Bat will not my uncle reproach me for my want of candour and confidence V said E . elina ; ' will he not blame me for not having immedi ately acquainted him with my receipt of this letter, aud tbe feelings with which its contents haveiuspired me ?' Evelina no sooner beheld tbe letter which Mr. Langston held In his hand, than overwhelmed with emotion, she burst into tears, and sank at his feet. ' Oh, my dear sir,' she sobbed forth, ' pardon me, I implore you, for having received that letter, and not having immediately communi cated it to you. But, bat-' ' Ob, no, Evelina, I am certain that Mr. Lang ston is too kind, too generous, and has too high confidence in your virtue and integrity to do that. He will make every allowance for tbe peculiarity of tbe circumstances, and the timidity of your nature ; at the same time, knowing the high opinion he has always expressed of Westbourne, he will feel tbe deepest sympathy for his misfor tunes, nor entertain one i_ea derogatory to his honour. Courage, my dear girl, and depend upon it, ail will terminate much better than you now anticipate. I will wait here until after your interview with your uncle/ She could not finish the sentence, for the violence of her agitation checked her utterance.

Poor Westbourne, I sineerely pity him, and trust that Providence will not desert him in bis present troubles/ 'Oh, would tbat I had never beheld him,' sighed Evelina ; ' wbat misery would it bave saved us botb.

It was quite evident to Mr. Langston the feelings which were passing in her bosom ; and sadly did be regret tbe anguish she waa enduring, and be lamented that she and Westbourne had ever met.

Would tbat I could sanction your youthful love, and render yon completely happy ; but it must not be. Westbourne is the son of Lord Sidley, the usurper of your ill-fated parent's prosperity ; the primary cause of all his misfortunes, his sufferings, and as such Evelina Marsden must never, even though circumstances should permit, become bis bride. 1 know it is bard that Westbourne should have to suffer for the sins of his father; I duly appreciate hls merits, I perceive his virtue, I pity his mlsfor* tunes, and, as a friend, willingly would I assist him to the utmost of my power; but lam cer tain tbat Evelina would ratber sacrifice her own feelings than she will ever consent to compromise the respect and reverence sbe owes to the author of her beings' Here her emotions stifled her voice, and ahe covered her face with her handkerchief, and wept bitterly. Mr. Langston tried to comfort her, and after some further conversation, he suffered ber again to retire, that she might give free indulgence to the feelings which _at urally agitated her bosom. ' It is over,' ejaculated Evelina, throwing her self Into the aims of Helen, when ahe had entered tbe room where the latter bad been anxiously awaiting her ; ' the secret is divulged \u2014 my uncle has seen the letter, and \u2014 and \u2014 the decree is sealed. I must think no more of Westbourne Sidley, save as a friend. Alas! wbat a painful task is imposed upon me ; but reason and duty compel, and I must submit/ ' Be calm, Evelina,' said Helen, * and trust in the Almighty, who will not fail to give you forti tude to bear this disappointment to your early hopes. And e.en something may yet occur te bring you and Westbourne together, and to do away with the obstacles which now present themselves to the encouragement of your senti ments towards each other/ ' Ob, no, no, said Evelina, emphatically, ' I cannot, dare not encourge euch an idea. West bourne is the son of Lord Sidley, and numerous as are his virtues, that is enough to destroy all my hopes. But to think that he is reduced to such misery, to know that he has become a friendless wanderer npon tho wldo world \u2014 and with the uncertainty of ever learing wbat has become of him, tortures me more than 01. Un happy Westbourne, it was indeed an unfortunate hour for us both tbat introduced me to yon/ At this allusion to ber ill-fated and deeply wronged father, the tears of Evelina flowed more rapidly than before ; convulsive sobs agitated her bosom ; she drooped her head upon her uncle's shoulder, and for some moments was unable to speak.

And then ber tears flowed freely, and for some time she became unconscious to every thing but the sorrow which so deeply afflicted her bosom. Again and again she pressed the letter of Westbourne, which her uncle and restored to ber, to her li_s, and in piteous accents she implored Heaven to watch over and protect him from harm, and to restore him to that prosperity and station in society, from which he had been go unjustly banished. But could she hope that he would forget her . Could she pray that they might never meet agaiu, although fate frowned so darkly upon their passion? Oh, no; the poor girl's heart revolted at the idea, and she only regretted and lamented that all their hopes and wishes should have to be sacrificed to stern necessity, and unpropitious destiny. requested hrr presence tbat evening, thinking that it would be much better if Bhe were left to the free Indulgence of her own thoughts. Sincerely Mr. Langston regretted the early blight that had been thus cast upon the hopes and affection, of his niece ; and had it not unfor tunately been for his near connection with Lord Sidley, whom he firmly believed to have obtained possession of the property of Richard Marsden by the most fraudulent means, there was no man to whom he would sooner have seen Evelina united than Westbourne, for he waB convinced that he waB every way worthy of her, and he was fearful that Evelina would have a bard trial to subdue her passion, if indeed, she could ever love any otber man but him. He felt the deepest sympathy for the misfor tunes of Westbourne, and was most anxious to know what had become of him, but he was per fectly at a loss to imagine, knowing the strict integrity of bis character, by wbat act ol impru dence he could have reduced himself to the state of ruin and wretchedness he had described. But certainly, now that Mr. Langston knew the real state of ber mind, and sbe wss no longer pnt to the pain of concealment, Evelina felt much relief, nor could she attempt to deny the truth and reason of his arguments, hard, however, as tbe restrictions were which they Imposed. He was sorry that Westbourne had not msde Evelina acquainted with the place where he was to be found, so that he might have communicated with him, and tendered him his advice and con- Eolation under the painful circumstances ; but he doubted much whether he would for some time, if ever, return to the neighbourhood, for he was convinced that the proud spirit of Westbourne, and the unprovoked InBult be had received from his father, would never suffer him to submit. Had Mr. Langston, however, been aware ofthe real cause ofthe quarrel between Westbourne and his father, and of the outrage which the latter had committed against his niece, how doubly powerful would have been his indignation. But should she never more hear from West bourne? sbe reflected \u2014 would he not enter into a further explanation of his present circuit stances, and what had been the fatal cause that had reduced him to them ? S jrely, if he really loved her as he professed to do, he could not, would not leave ber ln such a state of suspense ; for suspense and anxiety he must be aware would be sure to be excited In her breast by tbe tenor of bis letter, He must bs confident tbat she regarded him with esteem, if not with love, and that she must there fore feel the greatest solicitude in hls welfare, es ?ecially when she was the innocent cause of bis misfortunes. Many times did she peruse that part of his letter in whieh he stated that he had by one act of folly rendered himself unworthy of her, and brought ruin upon his head ; and the longer sbe rnmlnated npon it the more did she become lost and entangled in the mazes of doubt and perplexity. But let us now pursue the progress of West bourne Sidley, whom we left at the inn where he and Philip his groom had put up for the night. How agonizing were the thoughts that still continued to rack the young man's mind ; but Evelina, the image ofthe beauteous, tbe innocent Evelina, completely superseded every other, and absorbed his very soul. And to what danger, what outrage, might not the poor girl in future be exposed ; and that even from bis own father, whose base intentions were now unmasked by his conduct, and there would be no one at hand to protect her, for wbat could the efforts of her uncle do ? He was half inclined to return to the neighbourhood of the hall, incog, and to watch in eecr.-t the actions of his father, and endeavour to frustrate any evil designs he might have in contemplation. Then again he thought of writing an anonymous Utter to Mr. Langstun, to warn him against Lord Sidley; hut he was fearful of bringing him into collision with his lordship, wbich might bs the means of inflicting greater misery upon Evelina. Tortured by theso reflections, it was some time before Westbourne could com pose himself :o sleep, and then the moat painful visions haunted his imagination, so that he arose in tbe morning unrefreshe_, and as miserable as when he had sought bis pillow. Having partaken of a slight repast, he was preparing to resume his journey, when, having emerged from tbe coftee-room, just as he had His mind most have been wandering at the time he wrote tbat passage ; for she waB confident that his mind was too noble and honourable to be guilty of a single act which he should afterwards be ashamed to acknowledge. How deeply she regretted that Philip had departed before she had perused the letter, for then she might have been able to have elicited from him all the particulars ; though doubtless he had acted entirely by the instructions of his master, and even then might bave declined to gratify her anxiety. Alas alas! sbe knew not what to think, for it did not appear probable that Westbourne would thus bave accused himself, unless it wsre true, and then she waB surprised that he had not concealed it, as he must be aware, under all the clrcumitances, how deeply it must atfllct her. And now again she sunk npon her kness, and fervently she supplicated the Supreme to release him from his difficulties whatever they might be, and to avert any impending evils wbich might threaten him. Thus wrapped in gloomy meditation, poor Evelina continued for several hours, and her uncle did not offer to interrupt her, and no more"], [150, "EVELINA, THE PAUPER'S CHILD ; 142 \u25a0 Unfortunately it is too true : and I was now on my way to Ihe mansion of Sir Humphrey Sidmouth, thinking that in his society I might find consolation and advice/ ' Lncky then it is that I have met you,' said Lord Sl.pdash, ' for I am direct for London, the gay metropolis, my boy, the place to dissipate ennui, and ihitherlam determined you shall accompany me.

Westbourne had no sooner beheld this gentle man, than he started back a few paces in no little surprise, and the latter fixing his eyes upoa him at tbe same moment, uttered an exclamation of aitonisbment and pleasure, and gra.pcd West bourse cordially by the iand.

These observations were uttered with such ex. traotdinary volubility that it would have been impossible for any one to have understood a single word, and Westbourne, who was com- pletely taken by surprise, was hurried by Lord Slapdash into the room to which the host was ' Most remarkable,' exclaimed the young nobleman; ' 1 could not have believed it of yonr father.

And her uncle, too, might be induced to pot some unpleasant construction upon it, which he could not explain without exposing tbe conduct of Lord Sidley, bis father, aud putting Mr. Langston and bis niece to much trouble and annoyance.

Lord Slapdash was a w.ld and thoughtless young man, who, having a large fortune at his command, and who having married a wealthy heiress, whose whole soul was devoted to the frivolities and extravagances of fashionable life, bad plunged into many scenes of dissipation. But BtL'l he had his good qualities, and West bourne could not help feeling towards him a sincere friendship, wbile at the Barne time he deprecated his n_any foiables. Situated as he now was, it mattered little to Westbourne whither he went, and be, therefore, by degrees, as they pursued the journey, yielded te the vivacity ef bis lordship, and anticiapated tbe change of scene in the metropolis with some thing like satisfacton. He endeavoured to banish from his mind the gloomy thoughts which at present oppressed it, and to look for* ward to the suture with renewed hope; bnt, alas 1 that was a most difficult task, and he suc ceeded but indifferently. ' Your lordship does me honour by your friendly invitation,' said Westbourne, ' but I am afraid you would find me but a sorry and gloomy companion, and I must, therefore, beg to decline.' ' But indeed you shall not,' said the gay young nobleman ; ' it is some time since we met before, and the pleasure is so great that I cannot part with you on any terms.' ' The gaiety of the metropolis is in no way in unison with my present feelings,' said West bourne, ' and I must, therefore, again beg to be excused.' Lord Slapdash kept up a constant round of cheerful conversation during tbe journey to London, and Westbourne was compelled, in spite of himself, to laugh occasionally at his frequent brilliant sallies of wit. But still bis thoughts were constantly fixed on Evelina, and be felt that absence from the neighbourhood where she resided, could only add to the misery which afflicted his bosom. Had be been aware of tbe thoughts which at that time occupied the mind of Evelina, aud that her heart beat re' sponBive with his own, how great would have been his emotion ; wbat feelings of delight would have mingled with his S-dness, and in spite of tbe present gloomy aspect of his affairs, he would not have been disposed to have banished hope entirely from his bosom. ' And I must agaiu positively decline to ac cept of any excuse. Now, Westbourne, you knew me before today for a determined fellow, and therefore yon might as well yield at once. Sir Humphrey Sidmouth is but a sage, dull fellow at the best of times, and if you were left to his keeping, I predict that you would absolutely die or go mad with ennui in less than a month.' Westbourne tried many other arguments In order to excnse himself, but in vain ; the volatile young lord was resolved not to bo defeated, and ultimately he gained his point. Westbourne yielded, and tbe consequence was that in less than another hour he and Lord Slap dash were on their way to London. Nothing particular occurred on the journey ; and as the evening advanced, the spacious streets of London appeared in sight, and in spite of everything, Westbourne could not but feel his mind diverted by the life and bustle aud variety tbat abounded on all sides of him. Lord Slapdash's mansion wes situated in Cavendish-square, and was furnished in the first style of ostentatious elegance. It was the constant resort of tho gay, the wealthy, and the beautiful, and most animated and voluptuous were tbe scenes that nightly took place in it.

But she wes moat inordinately vain But notwithstanding all the efforts of the sparkling and vivacious roue, Westbourne found It impossible to dissipate from hls mind the gloomy thoughts which beset it.

But, alas 1 of what use was it for him to encourage such hopes, sinca even if he sh.uld succeed in winning her heart, he could never expict to make her bis wife, connected as he was, and ruined as he was in prospects i of her own personal charms and accomplish ments, aod lent a willing and gratified ear to all the fulsome flattery that was so abundantly lavished upon her from all eideB. His lordship never felt the least jealousy of the attentions which were paid to her by his giddy companions ; in fact, he was the complete slave of her will and caprice, and never on any account attempted to question her conduct, although it very frequently overstepped the bounds of prudence, and was what would have been c.-si^ered highly reprehensible in a more humble and domestic family. But could he ever love any other female as he loved her ? Oh, no; he was certain that no other damsel could ever gain his heart, and tbat as he could not hops to possess her, life possessed but few charms in his estimation. Sometimes be thought of addressing a letter to Evelina, making her acquainted with where be was, and revealing to her the secret of his heart ; but some irresistible power withheld him from so doing; and he remained in the same state of indecision, anxiety, and suspense. Lord Slapdash also had his secret amours, nor would he have felt any dread of her lady ship discovering them, for in wbat is called fashionable life, such things are t.o often looked upon, by the parties most immediately interested, with the most perfect indifference. Aod would his father make any Inquiry as er him; or regret his abrupt departure? Notwith standing what bad taken place between tbem, he could not help thinking that he would, and be waB almost sorry that he had not left a note behind him ou quitting the abbey, explaining bis future intentions. Bat the degrading language his father hid uttered to him, the blow he had struck him, arose to his recollection ; and while his bosom swelled with indication, he was deter mined that he would never again submit himself to similar insult. No; let whatever might be his fate, be would not, for his manly pride would not suffer him to do so, or subject himself to the haughty will and caprices of bis father. Tbe constant round of gaiety and p'easure tbat prevailed at the mansion of Lord Slapdash, the numerous fashionable parties tbat constantly assembled there, the unrestrained indulgence that was given to every kind ofloxurious dissipa tion, and the vivacity of the couversaziones, ln which Westbourne joined, to prevent himself from being rendered conspicuous, and subjected to unpleasant observations, .eft him but Httle time to think; but when alone In hiB chamber, he gave himself up to all tbe anguish of his feelings, and bemoaned his wretched fate ; for, though iu the midst of such lively society, b_ felt himself lonely and an outcast. Westbourne had frequently been in her lady* ship's company prior to her marriage - with Lord Algernon; and while he could not but warmly admire her prepoisessing beauty and the ele gancies of ber mind, he regretted her many failings, and lamented to see oue who in every other respect was bo admirably formed to create universal esteem, resign hersell to those follies which must ultimately be productive of the wor. t consequences. Lady Clementina received Westbourne with much courtesy and cordiality, and with her usual sweetness of manner expressed the plea sure sbe felt at his unexpected addition to their society. Westbourne struggled as much as poBBib'e with the melancholy feelings whicb tortured his miud, and replied to her ladyship with becoming gallantry, at the same time he joined in the conversation that ensued with more freedom and cheerfulness than, under all the circumstances of bis situation, could have been expected. Tbe party that were assembled at the mansion a > this occasion separatea at an earlier hour than usual, ln consequence of his lordship and West bourne being fatigued after their joaruey, and the latter retired to the chamber allotted to him, worn out with fatigue consequent upon the change of scene, and sick at heait. He had more than once intimated to his lord ship the distaste he had for the present scenes in which he mingled, and his wiBh to retire into private life ; but Lord Algernon would not listen to it for a moment, and always rallied him so severely upon what he Was pleased to call his misanthropy, in wbich he was ever seconded by L3dy Clementina, that Westbourne was fain to yield a tacit submission to their arguments, in the hope that an opportunity would shortly present itself for him to escape, without otTending Lord or Lady Slapdash. It anything couli possibly have won the affao tions of Westbourne from the one dear object tbat constantly occupied his thoughts, surely amongst the rare galaxy of beauty thtt was constantly lo be met with at the mansion, that must have been accomplished. But although there were many a fair damsels who would have been proud to have won tho heart of the handsome and accomplished young man, he looked upon them all with indif ference, and the irna.e of our heroine being oon atantly present to his imagination, he could lee no other maide** whom he could admire. And now again he questioned the prudence of hit having yielded to tbe importunities of Lord Algernon, and visited London, where he most constantly mingle in scenes of riot and dissipa tion, so dissonant with his present feelings, and which had ever been foreign to his tastes and pro pensities. He almost resolved to excuse himself to his lordship as soon as possible, and put bis first intention into operation ; namely, to make his way to the residence of Sir Humphrey Sid mouth, in whose more retired habits and excellent advice he hoped to find some consola tion. Evelina had now probably beard ofthe quarrel between him end his father, and his abrupt departure from the abbey ; and he was anxious to know what herweiings were upon the subject; though he could no. help flattering himself that she could not but view it with regret and anguish. Ho felt confident that xa. icspectful attention he had ever bestowed upon her had been far from disagreeable to her; and he was inclined to > \u25a0 = - \u25a0"], [153, "EVELINA, THE PAUPER'S CHILD ; OR, POVERTY, CRtME, A.ND SORROW. 145 And what would Evelina think of him, he reflected, did she but know the daDgerous scenes of faihionable revelry in which he was cons' anlly engaged ; would not the good opinion he flattered himself she had formed of him b_ greatly dimin ished ? He feared that it would, an _ even the peculiar circumstances under which he was placed, could not very well be received as any excuse for it. Th S idea made him ihe more anxious to leave tha mansion of L^rd Slapdash, and he resolved that not all the seductive allure ments which were held out to him should much longer detain him. Play was nightly cirri ' n. to the greatest excess at the mansion ot Ljrd Alge-non, and 1 rge sums of money were lost aud won.

Madness almost seized upon his brain ; his eyes Beemed to flash fire ; he s'arted from the table, ard clasping his forehead with a groan of agony ai d deip tir, he lushed from the room and hurried away from the mansion. He had o_ly just descended the steps when he met bis servant, Philip, whom he commanded to follow him ; he then dashed wildly on, he knew not whither. He did n t stop until he had got some distance from Cavendish-square, when he was forced to cling to a lamppost to save himself from falling.

It was some minutes before be could become the leaat calm, and then again Philip endeavoured to persuade him to return to tbe msnBlon. 'Philip,' said the agitated young man, 'you will exjs erate me, if you continue to urge this. I tell you they have reduced me nearly to beggary ; and think you that I can ever meet again in friendship the author of my ruin ? Oh, why wai I ever permitted to accompany Lord Algernon to London !' After having performed this task, Philip re turned with all the speed he could to London ; but on reaching the hotel, his astonishment may easily be imagined when he was informed that his master had quitted the hotel that morning, after having discharged his bill, and left ten pounds with the proprietor of the house, to deliver t _ him as tbe balance of his wages. Weslhourne paused for a short time, and silently brooded over the misery of hiB situation; but at length be beckoned PhUip to follow him, and then with hurried step be made his way to the nearest hotel, which he entered, and engaged apartments for himself and servant for a week. Almost immediately after his arrival at the hotel, Westbourne was so worn out with anguish, that be retired to his chamber, and Phi _p seeing him so violently agitated was almost afraid to leave him ; but his master commanded him to do so, and strictly enjoined him not to go near the mansion of Lord SlapdaBb, or to let him know what had become of him, on pain of hiB future displeasure. CHAPTER XXII. THE FURTHERANCE OF THE PLOT THE FORGED LETTER. \u2014 THE CONSEQUENCES. The alarm of honest Philip oa the receipt of this intelligence even exceeded bis astonishment, and he knew not what to think. However, he strongly apprehended that in his despair, West bourne might be tempted to commit seme rash act ; and that idea Increased his agitation ; especially as the proprietor of the hotel informed him that his master appeared in a very forlorn and dejected state of mind, when he took his departure. When Philip was gone, Westbourne continued to pace tbe apartment for some time in the moBt distracted manner, and be beat his breast, and tore his hair, with all the wildness of a maniac. 'Ruined, beggared, disgraced!' he groaned ; ' and all by my own folly. What is now to become of mes Whither can I go t And oh, what would Evelina think of me, did the but know the li/e of dissipation I have lately been leadings \u2014 Would she not despise me? Would not all those feelings of friendship I have every reason to believe she entertained towards me be des troyed ? Oh, I can endure an>thingbut that thought.' Philip, after some time considering what it would be best for him to do, made his way to the mansion ef Lord Slapdash, but they had seen nothing of him, and until then bad no idea whither he had gone, wben he so abruptly made his depart', re from the house. Lord Algernon, who, as we have before stated, possessed many good qualities, and felt the greatest esteem for Westbourne, expressed his deep regret at what had occurred, and promised to exert himself to the utmost to ascertain what had become of him ; and that promise he ful filled to the very letter ; but all the efforts of his lordship and Philip, after several days, proved fruitless, for uot the least clue could they obtain as to the fate of the unfortunate young gentle man. Again he groaned with more intense anguish than before. His brain was distracted, and had he had the means, in his frenzy he might have been driven to lay violent hands on himself. Al length be threw himself on the couch, and com pletely worn out by the violence of his suffering., be full asleep. But sleep brought no relief to his anguish; the most frightful dreams haunted his imagina tion, and when he awoke in the morning he was so ill that he was unable to raise his head from the pillow. Philip was greatly alarmed when he beheld the situation of bis master, and imme diately procured medical aid ; but the whole of tbat day Westbourne was in a state bordering on insensibility, rnd it was three days beiore he was able to leave hiB bed. He was then so weak that be could scarcely stand; but my degrees the vio ence of his anguish abated, and settled into a calm and melancholy despair; and it waB plain to be teen from the expression of his countenance and his whole demeanour, that ho had made u_> bis mind to something determined and des perate. Philip's fears now knew no bouuds, and he was ata peifect loss how to proceed. Lord Sidley, having fought the duel with Almiral Norman, had fled from the abbey, and no one knew whither he was gone, so tbat Philip had no means of consulting him on the subject, or even to make him acquainted with what had happened. At last, however, he resolved to hasten to the resi dence of Sir Humphrey Sidmouth, with the hope that he might have seen or heard something cf him; and on that errand, filled with mingled hopes and fears, he took his departure sroui Lon don. On arriving at the residence of Sir Humphrey, that gentleman was extremely surprised and afflicted to hear the account Philip gave ; but he had neither seen nor heard anything of West bourne, and the whole affair was still enshrouded in the same mystery. It -.as flow that Westbourne wrote the letter to our heroine, which caused euch a sensation in ber breast, and with the contents of which the reader has been already acquainted. He strictly"], [155, "OR, POVERTY, CRIME, AND SORROW. 147 Sir Humphrey and Philip made every inquiry, where it was at all likely they would gain any information, but all to no purpose ; and they now indeed began to apprehend that something serious had happened to him; for what rash act might he not be prompted to commit, dreadfully excited as he had been when he quitted the hotel ? P_iUp having failed to gain any Information In other places, resolved to hasten to the neigh bourhood of the abbey, although he could have no hope of being more successful there, as it was not likely that his unfortunate master would direct his steps thither. self to the utmost to find him out. Foolish Westbourne, to plunge at once into folly and extravagance ! It is fearful to thiDk what rash act he may have been tempted to commit. And you say that he was ruined, Philip V 4 Alas 1 he raid bo,' i. plied the latter, ' and I have too much reason to fear, from the despair which he exhibited, that he spoke the truth. Ah, Mr. Blackthorn, it ia a melancholy Job.' 'It is indeed, Philip,' returned Stephen, with well-assumed sincerity ; ' but still we must hope for the best. Every exertion must be made to discover him, aud there shall be nothing wanting on my part to do so.' It was with a sad heart that Philip commenced his journey, and gloomy were the apprehensions he formed of Westbourne's fate whom he feared he should never behold again. As be travelled on, Pnilip made inquiries at the different inns he stopped at, and where he was known ; bat with out gaining the least information ; and havi :g arrived at the place of his destination, he pro ceeded direct to Charrington Abbey, where he was received with a hearty welcome by tbe servants, and who expressed much surprise and regiet at what he stated to them ; for Westbourne was universally esteemed by them, and they all were sorry when he had quitted the abbey. Not one of them, however, could or dared give him the least idea as to where Lord Sidley had gone ; as he had left no instructions, but departed in the night ; and, therefore, Philip was left without any means of making him acquainted with what had happened, though he felt assured that his lordsliip, in spite ofthe quarrel which had taken place between him and hie son, must experience considerable alarm at his mysterious disappear ance, and be very anxious to ascertain his fate. 'You are a particular friend of his lordship, Mr. Blackthorn,' remarked Philip, ' acd surely you know whither he has retired, \u00a7o that he may be made acquainted with it.' 'Indeed I do not, Philip!' answered Elack thorn, ' but no doubt he will soon return to the abbey, as Admiral Norman, I bear, is fa_t re.overiag, and I dare say a reconciliation can be effected between them. But whither are jou going now, Philip?' \u2022 To the hall.' 'To the hall !' ' Yes,' said Philip, ' for I thought Mr. Langston and h s amiable niece might be anxious to hear the particulars, as I know that they felt the greatest friendship for my poor master.' 'True I true! they had a rght to do so, after the eervice which Mr. Westbourne had rendered them,' observed Blackthorn. * But I am going there myself, aad therefore will save you the trouble.' Philip bowed, and after some few more obser vations had taken place between them, he returned to *he abbey, and Stephen Blackthorn made his way to the hall. Philip knew very well the sentiments which Westbourne entertained towards our heroine, and he could not help thinking from wbat he had himself observed of ber, and the emotion she had exhibited on his delivering his master's letter to her, that sbe returned his passion, and he, there fore, at last resolved to go to theha'l and apprise her and her uncle of the painful particulars. Nothing could equal the gratification which be felt at the disappearance of Westbourne, who he had very little doubt would never trouble them again, and the villain imagined to him. elf tbe anguish r>hich Evelina would feel when sbe was informed of the royeterioas disappearauce of him to whom, be was convinced, her whole heart was devoted. So great was the hatred he bore her, tbat he felt the greatest delight in Beeing her luffsr, and he was determined that now West bourne was out of the way, he would lose no time in placing her in the power of Lord S'dley, aud thus completing her misery, and accomplish ing his own covetous wishes. He had already be come acquainted with the fact of Evelina's hav ing received a letter from Westbourne, which he had communicated to his lordship, and they had even now a design in hand to secure the penon of the poor girl, wbich they bad no doubt would be crowned with success, and Blackthorn felt satisfied that the present circumstance would tend to accslerate the plot, and to place Evelina in Lord Sidley's power. In the meantime, Eve lina had been enduring the greatest anxiety to know what had become of Westbourne ; but as day alter day elapsed without her receiving any communication Irom him, she gave herself up to despair, and feared that she should never hear from him or behold him again. The morning after his arrival at the abbey, he, therefore, bent his steps towards the hall, but he had not proceeded far on his way when he met Stephen Blackthorn, who betrayed no little surprise on beholding him, and immediately greeted him. Philip entertained no very good opinion of Blackthorn, but, on tbe contrary, he believed him to be a deep designing man, and to have no very good feeling towards his un'ortunate master ; however, he questioned him in such a way tbat be could not avoid making him acquainted with the particulars ; and Blackthorn could scarely conceal the secret exultation he felt while he listened to him; but he did disguise his real thoughts, and affected to feel the graatest sympathy in the misfortunes of Westbiurne, and the utmost anxiety to discover what had become of him. ' Unfortunate young man,' he said, ' he was very rash to leave the abbey so abruptly, when an explanation and reconciliation might have been effected between him and his 'ather.

He was the constant companion of her thoughts, bis image was ever present to her mind's eye, and she found it utterly impossible to think of him as a friend only. Mr. Langston saw the feelings that occupied her mind, and he wondered not ; for he could not deny the great merits of Westbourne Sidley, but still he trusted that time would abate the ardour of her hopeless passion, and that .he might meet with some other man, who was worthy of her, and on whom she could place her affections. Evelina could not restrain her tears, and feel ing completely overwhelmed by her grief, and the shock she had sustained from the fatal intel ligence Imparted to them by Blackthorn, she was compelled to seek her chamber. Here she gave free vent to the emotions which filled her bosom, and formed the most dreadful apprehensions of the fate wbich had befallen Westbourne. No sooner had Stephen B!ackthorn entered the room in which Evelina and her uncle were seated, than they could see by his countenance and demeanour that he bad something to com municate, and they both apprehended that it was no good. Evelina's heart fluttered, but she was not long kept in suspense. Blackthorn, without further delay, related to them all tbo fatal parti culars of Westbourne's misfortunes, and his dis appearance, as they had been detailed to him by Philip, and our heroine no sooner heard them than, unable to control her emotions, she gave utterance to a cry of agony and fainted. ' He waB himselfdriven to despair,' she s'ghedj ' and what desperate deed might be not have been urged to do in that wretched state of mind ? And it was through me that be qaarrelled with his father, and tbat he was thus driven from bis home. Alas! alas! that idea must ever haunt and torture my imagination. Unfortunate West bourne, I feel now more powerfully than ever the strength of that passion with which your numerous virtues inspire me. Banish you from my memory ! suffer any other man to supplant you in my heart ! Oh, no, that is indeed impos sible.' ' Poor girl \u2014 poor girl,' said Mr. Langston : ' this is indeed painful intelligence lor you, devoted as your innocent heart still Is, I am convinced, to the unfortunate WeBtbourne. I fe-r, alas! that your peace of mind is ruined for ever. Would to Heaven that you had never beheld each other.' She claiped her hands together, and fervently she supplicated the p'Otection ofthe Almighty for .Vest bou me, and implored Him to avert the dangers she now apprehended. Soon afterwards, Helen arrived at the hall, and being made acquainted with what had happened, she immediately entered the chamber as Evelina, to offer her all the consolation in her power. This, however, she found to a most difficult task ; and Bhe feared that this additional anxiety, and the uncertainty of the fate of Westbourne, would have a most serious effect upon Evelina's consti tution. Blackthorn and Mrs. Snacks exchanged glances with each other aside; and it might have been evident to any one who had noticed them, that the most malicious feelings of exultation were passing in their minds. ' Westbourne Sidley hSB acted with great impetuosity and imprud.oce,' remarked Black thorn. ' It appears from Philip, his servant, who would not bo likely to misrepresent the facts, that immediately on his arrival In London ha plunged into every excess, spending his days and nights in dissipation and extravagance; the consequence of which was that he speedily brought bin self to ruin. And I fear that, in his despair, he haB been driven to lay violent hands on himself.' Helen continued with our heroine for two or three hours, at the end of which time, finding her somewhat more tranquil, aud that she was inclined to go to sleep, she left her. Blackthorn, on bis return home, immediately communicated the account which he had received from Poillp, to Lord Sidley, and likewise sug gested to him a plan for the accomplishment of his wishes, which was afterwards put into exe cution. He felt the greatest satisfaction at the disappearance of Westbourne, and was resolved to delay no more time than was possible before the whole of his desires should be gratified, and he had already concocted a deep-laid plan of villany to possess himself of the wealth of Mr. Langston, and to have Evelina completely in bis power, which will afterwards be expla'ned. Philip, finding that no information was likely to be obtained where he was, left the neighbour hood with a melancholy heart, and Blackthorn was very glad that he bad done so, for he did not wish him to hold any communication with Mr. LangBton and his niece, lest it might in some way mar his plans. ' It is a melancholy affair altogether,' said Mr. Langston, ' and deeply do I regret that West bourne should have been lured Into such scenes. Bat I do not believe that he has committed suicide; or certainly that would have been dis covered before now.' Blackthorn still maintained his opinion, and having achieved hit object, he took his leave. In a short time poor Evelina recovered, and raising ber eyes towards her uncle, with a most piteoui expression, she exclaimed \u2014 'Oh, ray dear sir, you will not reproach me for this display of emotion I Unfortunate West' bourne, what has become of you 1 What dread * fal act, ln your despair, have you been tempted to commit ?

She always enjoyed the most refined and exquisite sensations, while wandering over the lofty bills which reared their heads immediately at the back of Charrington Abbey. Often did she wind along the summits of craggy heights, beneath whicli/ the rapid torrent rolled its misty waves that long were heard to roar, until falling into its deep and native channel, it awhile glided gently on, reflecting on its translucent bosom the awful forms of the neighbouring mountains, who.e barren horrors were scarcely hid by a scanty vegetation; than its waves being impeded by some enormous rock, it suddenly arose, and, dashing its impetu ous course in foamy surges over a stony bed, rushed on to pay its tribute to the ocean. Sbe liked best to be alone, when she would sit and ponder for hour* over every circumstance of her connection with tbe unfortunate West bourne ; recall to her memory every word he had ottered when they been together ; and weep tears of the bitterest agony over the letter he had rent ber, and which she treasured as a gem of the most inestimable value. At night, too, his form was ever present to her imagination iu her dreams, and various, and all equally torturing, were the ideal shapes in which his fate waB pre sented to her, adding to the anguish and terror of her mind. Scenes like these were calculated to soothe the mind of Evelina, and harmonise her thoughts, for through nature she looke i up to nature's God. Sometimes she would also wander, accom panied by Helen, to those places which 6he knew had been the favourite resorts of Westbourne ; places that she seared would never be traversed by him again. But how greatly were they endeared t. her by thail association with him; and what increased misery would she endure, if it were possible, if sbe were removed from them. Even the disappointment of her hopes lost in some measure its keenness while surveying with enthusiastic rapture the matchless works of the Omniscient Architect. Her vigorous mind, ani mated by reflection, launched into the world unknown, and anticipated immortal bliss. In these moments, terrene joys and sorrows shrunk to their original nothingness, and her soul seemed eager to burst its prison-bouse ; but when the thread of her ideas was broken by the necessary avocations of life, a calm and; melan choly presided in her breast ; the image of West bourne was restored, present misery remem bered, and Bhe sensibly felt herself a weak mortal. Admiral Norman bad quite recovered from the effects of the wound he had received in the duel, but still Lord Sidley remained absent from the abbey, nor could it be imagined what had become of him, though his servants frequently received written instructions from him ; but what part of the kingdom they came from, they had no means of ascertaining. Blackthorn, how ever, was in daily communication with his lord ship, and a plot of villany .,_ being concocted by them, which was shortly fated to deaceod with overwhelming force of misery upon the head of Evelina and her uncle. One morning, 'after having psssed a restless night, Evelina left her chamber at an early hour, and in order that she might give free and unin terrupted indulgence to the thoughts which crowded upon her mind, she bent her steps towards those romantic scenes near the abbey, where she delighted most to saunter. The day began to dawn, as she emerged from the hall, and distant objects were but dimly perceived ; a blue vapour enveloped the tops of the majestic hills, aud an universal stillneas reigned around, save that the early lark sometimes broke it with hiB melodious notes. All remained involved in the same state of mjstery as regarded the fate of Westbourne Sidley ; and Evelina now gave herself up entirely to despair, for it appeared but too evident that he would never be beaid of or seen again, and his father appeared to take not the least interest in what had befallen him. Sometimes our heroine could not help entertaining dark suspicions that Lord Sidley was not unacquainted with the manner of hiB disappearance ; and that he had sacrificed him to his vengeance and hatred ; but these thoughts she kept confined to her o\u00bbn heart, though they cost her many an hour of bitter anguish, and frequently drove sleep away from her pillow. She felt glad that Lord : idley did not return to the abbey, for she was con- vinced that she had every reason to dread him, after the insult which he had boldly offered her; and she knew that he was a man who would not shrink from the performance of anything, however base, to accomplish his ends. Six weeks had now elapsed since our heroine had been plunged into this horrible state of un- certainty and alarm, and still nothing waB heard of WeBtbourne, and not even the slightest ray ef hope now lingered in the bosom of Eve. ina. Still she continued her melancholy rambles, and ever , But soon the eastern Bky glowed with the golden beams of morning, the curling smoke ascended from the lowly cottageB, and the hoary summits of the mountains, which the dispenBivo mist discovered, reflected innumerable beauties to the sun's bright rays, that played on their majestic brows.

Her tears flowed fast as these thoughts crossed her mind, anrf more poignant became the pangs which shot through her bosom. While she was thus employed, sbe was sud denly aroused by hearing her name repealed, and that in the voice of a man. She was astonished and trembled, for who could know her in tbat lonely epot, and wbat might not be their inten tions at that early hour. The wild appearance of the man too, wbich was anything but natural, creited the most fear ful sensations in our heroine's breast ; and she would have given the world, could she: but have escaped him, while what his purpose could be she was at a loss to conjecture. How deeply she regretted that she had left the ball at so early an hour, and mentally but fervently che implored the protection of HeaveD, from any danger with which he might threaten her. Again the man approached her, and fixed him self in an attitude of earnest attention before her. Evelina found this suspense insupportable, and at lenght found courage sufficient to demand \u2014 ' Strange man, who are you? And for what purpose do you thus appear before me, and obstruct my path V She turned her eyes ln the cirectiou from whence tbe voice proceeded, but at first she did not perceive any object, and thought she must be mistaken, but ber _a . e being once more repeated, Bhe cast her eyes below, and beheld standing on the brow of a hill beneath a figure which filled her with surprise and alarm. It was that of a tall and muscular man, dressed ln a rude garb, and with a tattered cloak, depending from hiB shoulders, who was leaning on a staff, and w_s gaz'ng up intently at her. Hs eyes were large, black, and penetrating; his features course and Irregular ; his complexion swarthy, and his hair flowed dishevelled far over his shoulders. Evelina gazed at this singular being with the most indescribable amazement, and no smali degree ot terror, for what could his purpoie be with her, and how could she help herself in that lonely spot, if his intentions were evil ? 'Who am I?' repeated the man, in a hoarse voice. ' Oh, damsel, it would inspire tby gentle breast with horror to know. I am a wretch oppreEsed with the weight of a guiltyconicience, that has sapped my peace, aud gnaws at my heart like hungry wol .es.' ' Oh, spare me I' supplicated Evelina, terrified by his words, and thinking him some wretched maniac, who, in the fury of his delirium, might iuflict BOme violence upon her; ' suffer me to depart, I beseech you.' Again the stranger repeated ber name, and motio.ed her to approach him, and Evelina could not leave the spot without encountering him. Sbe knew not what to do, or what to imagine was his purpose ; nor could she form the least conception how be had come to tbe knowledge of her name, as she had no recollec tion of having ever seen him before. * Fear not, Evelina Marsden,' Baid the Btraoger, ' though I have been the cause of misery and shame to those connected with thee, I will not harm thee. Oh, tiat 1 had courage to \u2014 but no matter, for the preient it must not be. I come to warn the', maiden ; danger snrrounds thee; shun temptation, beware of deceit ; think not of Westbourne Sidley ; be not imposed upon by wbat may appear all fair and specious, as thou wouldst avoid destruction.' S_e looked around her as far as her eyes could extend, hut perceived no other individual at hand, eo that she was lett entirely to the mercy of this mysterious man, let his intentions be whatever they might. Once more tbe man beckoned her to approach him, and finding th-t sne still hesitated, he moved from the spot on which he had been sta i ding, and advanced with slow and measured steps towards her, until he stood within a few paces only of the astonished and terrified girl ; and as he gazed upon her with a most extraor dinary expresaiou of countenance, Erelina felt the most powerful and irresistible emotions steal toto her bosom, nor could she repress a cry of alarm, when he grasped her arm, but with a gentle viulence that showed he did not wish to harm her, but merely to detain her. Evelina, however, was so frightened at hia singular be haviour and appearance, tbat unable anj longer to support ber terrors, Bhe sank upon the earth insensible. ' Merciful Heaven I' exclaimed the astonished Evelina, ' mysterouB man, what are the meaning of your words? Wbat have I ti* fear from the unfortunate Westbourne Sidley, whom I may never behold again .' ' Westbourne Sidley is good and honourable,' repl'ed ihe stranger, 'and would sooner perish than offer thee wrong; but still, if thou studiest ths welfare, tbou wilt banish him from t ny thoughts. Mark well my words, Evelina Marsden, and disregard them not.' ' How know you my name, and ' ' How do I know thy name, girl?' interrupted the mao, and a most extraordinary expression overspread his features.

Your father returned ; with gold and jewels he came back, but to be seized aud afterwards condemned for murder!' and her limbs trembled go violently that she had the greatest difficulty in rising to her feet. Her brain was still giddy, and pressing her hands upon her temples, she gazed around her with a wild and searching glance ; but she was alone; the mysterious stranger waa gone. All that he had sa:d now rushed upon her memory, aud added to her dis'raction. But who could he he that was thus so minntely acquainted with her melancholy history ; and what could be his motives for thus appearing before her? Her father lived, and was in his native land I Those assertions rang in ber ears with overwhelming force, and involved her in the most dreadful aud insupportable state of perplexity, horror, and suspense. ' Oh, God 1 oh, Gad 1' groaned Evelina, horror struck at the dreadful recital, every word of which fell like burning coal upon her brain ; and she gazed with tenfold amazement and conster nation upon the mysterious man who stood before ber, and whose broad chest now beaved convul sively with the extraordinary excitement of his feelingB.

And oh, all-merciful Supreme, if it indeed be true that my poor father is still in existence and at liberty, humbly but fervently I implore thee to wach and protect him, to make 1 is innocence manifest, and once more restore him to my arms.' ' The tale is true, damsel,' returned the man, 'as thou, to thy Borrow, too well knowest. But thy father was innocent, innocent as tbou art; the real assassins ts.aped, but, one of them at least, to endure the tortures of the damned.' ' Ah !' screamed Evelina, ' you know them. I see by your manner, I hear by your observation that you do. Oh, if mercy lives within your breast, reveal the names of the wretches, and at once remove the odious stigma from the name of my unfortunate, my ill-fated parent.'

Notwithstanding his repulsive features, tbe singular interest he seemed to take in her welfare had created a favourable impression in ber mind, as regarded him ; but still the longer she reflected upon his words, and the warning he had given her, especially his injunctions for her to banish Westbourne from her memory, the more did sbe become involved in perplexity.

Evelina uttered a shriek of agony and astonishment, grasped the stranger's arm, and gazing into bis countenance with half frenzied looks, gasped for breath. And how had he become acquainted with the secrets of her heart ? How had be been enabled to penetrate these thoughts which bad never been communicated to any one but ber uncle and Helen ? This was altogether inexplicable, and our heroine was unable to come to any satisfac tory conclusion upon tbe subject. ' Richard Marsden,' said the man, In a firm and solemn voice, ' no longer bears the felon's fetters, and at this time breathes in Mb native land.' ' God of Heaven I' exclaimed Evelina, sinking to the earth ; ' he is then a returned convict I' Sbe could not utter another word ; the blood seemed to rush from her veins to ber head. Strange and hideous forms fora moment danced before her eyes, and her senses left her. At length Evelina, with a sad heart, and distracted and bewildered brain, slowly bent her steps towards the hall, ever and anon Icoking around to sea whether any person was fol lowing her ; for in spite of all that the stranger had said to the contrary, she was not without ber misgivings that he had some evil design against her; and yet if such had been the fact, would he not have taken advantage of the moment when she was completely powerless to resist him ?

But it could not be. Notwithstanding that an ignominious death assuredly awaited him, if he should be discovered, Bhe felt convinced tbat her unfortunate father would run any risk, if be were in England, to behold her; certain as he must be that both herself and Mr. Langston would devise every means to conceal him from the officers of the law, un'il his innocence should be made ap parent. 'And his age; what does that appear to bet' asked Mr. Langston. ' More than titty years,' answered our heroine. ' And have you never before encountered him in any of your walks V ' Never.' 'I am lost in amazement. And I do not remember having ever seen an individual an swering his description since I have been in the neighbourhood.' Evelina clasped her hands in agony, aod her tears flowed last as tbeae thoughts rushed to her mind, and Bhe was compelled to pause on her way, in order that she might, in some measure, recover herself. ' He may only recently bave come to it, my dear uncle,' remarked Evelina. She met not a single individual on her way home, . nd when she had arrived at tbe hall, and entered the parlour, she was bo overcome by ber conflicting feelings, that she sunk in a chair, without being ab e to speak a word, and covering her face with her bands, she burst into tears.

' But if jour unfortunate father has escaped from transportation and is in England, what terrible risk does he run, until hiB inn. cence is fully established. I tremble for him.

' 0_, my kind uncle,' Bobbed Evelina, ' I have seen and heard that this moruing which has greatly added to the anguish which before dis tracted my miud.' ' E_ lain yourself, child,' Bald Mr. Langston with a look of astonishment ; 'for your words are ambiguous, and only serve to add to my suspense and curiosity. Do any fresh troubles threaten you ? Tell me, I beg of you/ Most fervently and with tearful eyes did Evelina respond to that prayer, and it was several minutes before she was able to reaume the conversation. But vain were all the conjec tures which she and her uncle endeavoured to form upon this mysterious and important subject; and the longer they refleoted the more they became bewildered. ' Ala?, sir,' answered our heroine, ' I fear they do; but I am at a loss to think. lam corn* pletely bewildered, amazed, and alarmed. But liBttn tome, and I will endeavour to explain to you the extraordinary adventure I have met with this morning, and which has more of the cha racter of romance than reality about it.' A miserable day did Evelina pass, and Helen, when she was made acquainted with what had taken place, was equally involved in perplexity, and was unable to offer any opinion which appeared at all reasonable. Mr. Langston took a seat by her side, and after Evelina had for a few moments strugg.ed with the numerous feelings which held powerful conflict In her bos im, she detailed to her uncle all tbe particulars of her meeting and conversa tion with the mysterious stranger. Mr. Langston became mere anxious than ever to behold this remarkable stranger, thinking that he might, probably, be able to elicit from him a further explanation ; but although he made every inquiry in tbe neighbourhood, he was unable to discover any one answering his description, and both he and Evelina were moie involved ia mystery than ever. The astonishment with which Mr. Langston listened to her, weneed not attempt to describe ; aud the emotion he evinced was almost equal to her own. But after a day or two, our heroine resumed her v.'\u201e! k. ; not apprehending any danger, and wishing that she might again encounter the unknown, and trace some clue to the place of his concealment. Forbidding even as his appearance was, she did not think that he intended her any ' Most extraordinary,' he exclaimed at last ; ' had you only j_st quitted your chamber, my love, I should have been inclined to believe that your imagination waa disordered, and under the influence of some remarkable dream.

Oh, no, that was totally impossible.

EVELINA ACCOSTED BY THE MY9TEHIOU3 STRANGER. satisfied him that she could never fix her affec tions on any other man, at least so ardently as to consent to become his wife. He saw also the uncertainty of the site of Westbourne was preying deeply upon her con stitution, and he greatly seared wbat the suture consequences might proie to be. But now ano ther circumstance was about to take place, which would involve them all in the greatest misery, and place our heroine in the most imminent danger. Evelina had one afternoon returned from her customary walk, when on Mrs. Snacks opening the door to her, she drew her aside with a signi ficant look, and whlspeied In hei \u2022_, \u2014 ' May I request you to accompany me to my room for a few minutes, miss f I have some- whatever could destroy; and deeply he lamented the annihilation of her hopes, wnich he feared would overcloud all the sunshine of her future days ; and he dreaded the dangers which might befal her, if it should please the Almighty to deprive her of his protection and advice. For ber sake, he fervently hoped that that event might be yet long deferred; although, from his advanced age, he could not expect his hopes would be gratified. How happy would he hare been could Erelina meet with some worthy youth whom she could love as well as Westbourne, so that he might see her united before bis death : but, alas ! there seemed no prospect of tbat. and indeed the dis appointment which she aheady experienced No, 20."], [162, "EVELINA, THE PAUPER'S CHILD; 154 Mrs. Snacks, she made her way to her own apartment. \" Ha ! ha 1 ha !' loughed the housekeeper, when she was gone. ' Poor fool ! you little think how cunnin.ly you are deceived ; and the snare that is laid to entrap you. Il this device fail like the former one, I am much mistaken.

But if fate does not frown upon us, wo shall shonly get rid ot her, and I dare say Lord Sidley will take good care ihat she does not trouble ub again.' Thus saying, the infamous woman laughed again with the malice cf a fiend ; and then waited with impatience to see what effect the letter would have upon Evelina. Yes, at the suggestion of Stephen Blackthorn this epistle had been forged by Lord Sidley, and entrusted to Mrs. Snacka for delivery; and the guilty nobleman awaited with impatience tho result of the diabolical scheme, while Blackthorn had made every arrangement ser its completion, and had not the least doubt in his own mind of its success. thing to impart to you of the greatest conse quence.' ' To me V said Evelina with surprise. ' Yes, Miss,' returned the housekeeper in the same low and cautious tone 'Will you be pleased to attend me?' Evelina nodded her assent, and Mrs. Snacks led the way to her apartment. ' I know not whether I have done right, miss,\" she observed, when she bad closed the door; ' but I had scarcely time lo deliberate for the person was in such a hurry, that he departed again be fore I hsd an opportunity of saying ye9 or no. 'What person! To whom do you allude?' inquired our heroine, impatiently; ' and wnat is the nature of the business you wish lo sp:ak to me upon ? Piay be explicit.' ' I hope, miss, that you will not mention any thing of the circumstance to jour uncle, for I am afraid that I should get myself into sad disgree, if he were to know it.' 'Know what!' demanded Erelina, with In creaied eagemess; 'if it is anything roy uncle should not be made acquainted with, I ought not to listen to it.' \u2022 Well then, miss,' said Mrs. Snacks, \u25a0 to come to the point at once, I was standing at the hall door about an hour ago, when a man, whom I never remember to have seen before, walked up tome in a great hurry, and inquired if Miss Erelina Marsden was at home.' Evelina turned pale, and trembled. ' What sort of a man was this !' she inquired ; * and what was his business with me !' ' He was dressed as a respectable labourer, misB,' answered Mrs. Snacks, \u2022 as to what his business was, you shall hear. When I replied in the negative to his question, he asked me if I could keep a secret ; I answered that I could, perhaps, better than moBt women ; whereupon he placed a letter in my hand, which he desired me to deliver to you, and to make no one else acquainted with it, and before I could put any more questions to him, he abruptly quitted the spot, and was cut of sight iu an instant.' ' A letter to me I' ejaculated our heroine in a tremulous voice ; * this muet be some miBtake.' ' No, miss,' replied the housekeeper, ' it is all correct enough, and here is tbe letter. But I hope you will not be offended with me, nor say anything to your uncle about it. You may depend upon it, ser my part, that I will be quite silent.' Evelina took the letter with a trembling hand, When Erelina had gained her own apartment, she sank on her knees, with the letter clasped in her hands, and for some time was totally ab sorbed in the emotions which so violently agitated her boBom. Then in accents of the utmost ten derness and gratitude, she returned her thanks to Heaven that Westbourne was Btill alive, and fervently hoped that fortune no longer frowned so darkly upon him as it had lately done, but that he might yet live to enjoy every happiness that this li e can beBtow. But the letter! ought she to venture to peruse it before she had made her uncle ac quainted with the receipt of it ? Prudence would have dictated to her to seek his presence immediately, and to make him aware of all, and the manner in which she had received it; but might it not contain something that Westbourne meant for her eye alone! and could she deny him that wish, now that they were separated from each other, and might never meet again ? She coold not ; aod rising from her knees, she prepared to break the seal ; but her hand fal tered, and a deadly sickness came over her, and once more the tears gushed from her eyes, so that they completely blinded her. Alas! what dreadful intelligence might not that letter con vey t WeBtbourne might be ill, dying ; or sur rounded by some fresh tronbles, even of a more painful natute than those he had hitherto expe rienced. but Bhe had no sooner glanced at the superscrip tion than Bhe uttered a faint scream, and sank into a chair. The superscription on the letter was in the handwriting of Westbourne. * God ot heaven 1' she ejaculated, unable to control her emotions ; \u2022 God of heaven, I thank Thee ; he is still in existence ' This thought came with the power of an elec tric shock to her brain, and once more she fell or her knees, and pressed the letter to her heart, as though it were something animate that could sympathise with her emotions. There was a peculiar expression of satisfaction upon the countenance of Mrs. Soacks ; but Eve lina noticed it not, for her whole attention was absorbed by the letter. Again and again she traced the well-known characters, and pressed the letter to her lips ; and then giving vent to her feelings for a few moments, she arose from her seat, and w th (al tering footBteps, and without uttering a word to ' Almighty God 1' 6he ejaculated, ' Oh, give me strength to support with fortitude and re signation, any fatal intelligence that may be reserved for me ; and mercifully ordain tbat the unfortunate Westbourne may be preserved from every danger.'

Oh, no, ahe could not. She would ever most bitterly reproach herself afterwards, for having inflicted such additional misery and anguish upon one whom she believed to be the very soul of honour and virtue. Every line of tho letter breathed the fervour of truth and honesty. There was not a syllable contained which should lead her to suspect the integrity of the unfortunate writer's intentions. But still her hand trembled when she again prepared to break the seal, and melancholy fore bodings came over her more terrible than she could very well support. She faltered to the door, and locked it, to prevent the sudden intru sion of any cne. Returning to her chaU, and by a strong effort calling all ber fortitude to her aid on that trying occasion, she broke the seal, and then with eyes bait dimmed by tears she read the following words : \u2014 *Yes, dear, dear Westbourne, for such my heart prompts me to call you/ she ejiculated, as she fervently pressed the letter to her lips, ' I will meet yo_, let tbe consequences be what ever they may. My uncle, I am certain, will readily pardon me for this dereliction from the _uty I owe him, when he is made acquainted with the feelings that urge me on. Oh, how thankful am I to the Almighty who has hitherto preserved the wretched Westbourne from the fate into which I feared his misery had plunged him.

' Evelina, since I have been driven away from your presence, I bave suffered all tbe most poig nant feelings of anguish and despair ; and at length I have been urged by some instinctive feeling which I cannot control to return to tbe neighbourhood whicb is graced and honoured by your sweet self residing in it, with tbe hope tbat, if you really feel any commiseration for the troubles which have so unexpectedly come upon me, you will not refuse me a private Interview to-morrow evening at eight o'clock, in the chest nut avenue, wben I will explain every circum stance which probably you may feel anxious to know, and which bave plunged me into my pre sent misery and despair. Unable to meet her nncle in her present agi tated state of mind, Evelina pleaded a slight indisposition, as au excuse for remaining con fined to her chamber for the rest of the eveniog, and sbe was thus allowed free and uninterrupted communion with the thoughts to which this important and Interesting event had naturally given rlBe. It was late before she retired to rest, and then it was some time before sleep closed her eyelids, so busily was her mind occupied with the im\u00ab poriant event of the day. She a * oke at an early hour in tbe morning, just as the sun had begun to gild tbe summits of the eastern hills. Tbe image of the unfottu nate Westbourne Sidley was still uppermost in her thoughts, and the longer she reflected, the more determined was she to meet him at the appointed place. 1 Most forcibly do I feel the boldness and pre sumption of this request, especially wben I earnestly deBire (for reasons which probably you will understand) that you will come alone, and not reveal the seciet of this note to aoy one ; but too well do I know the charitableness of Eveline's heart to imagine for a moment that Bhe will suspect mo cf any dishonourable motives in the jtqueat which I make. Heaven forbid tbat I should harbour one thought derogatory to the peace of her whom I muBt ever love while life remains, beyond all earthly beings. It is the last request I will ever presume to make of Evelina Marsden and if it be granted me, it will be my only consolation in my d reary wanderings, a solace to me in the hour of affliction and of death. In the chestnut grove, then, to-morrow evening at eight o'clock, I shall be anxiously awaiting the result of my petition, but till then a ray of hope will cheer the despair ot As the family had not yet risen, and the morn ing was fine, she determined to take a stroll in the gardens attached to the hail, hoping that the fresh air would revive and invigorate ber. She placed the letter she had received in her bosom, and then silently left her chamber, aud descend ing the stairs, she passed out of the hall by tbe back door. For some time Evelina continued to walk about tbe well laid out gardens, wrapt in medi tation upon tbe iemarkab e events which had occurred within tha last fe* days, and more than al the Bti anger whom she had met, and who bad assured her of the existence of her be loved and ill-faied father.

But where could tbat beloved parent b- ? Wnere ' Westbourne Sidley,' We need not, we are sure, attempt to de -cribe the emotion of Evelina, while Bhe perused this epistle. Deep sobs heaved her gentle bosom, and her tears fell fast, without her having the least power to restrain them.

How could he manage to exist under his pecu liar and terrible circumstances I Oh 1 how the poor girl's heart yearned to see him, to be once more pressed to his bosom, and to bail him free aod u nstigmatlsed with tbe hideous crime which had been bo unjustly laid to his charge! But who was the stranger she had met, and who had given her tbe information t He had pro claimed her father's innocence ; therefore, that showed that he was friendly disposed towards him. Would that she could behold him again, that she might solicit some further information from him, for probably he was not ignorant of his place of concealment. 'No doubt of it,' Bald Mrs. Snacks, ' and we shall be rid of this workhouse brat for ever, and then to lay siege to tbe well-stocked .oilers ot Faol Langston/ 1 Right, we know how to deal with him , his gold we must bave, even if we should have to take bis life to got it.' The blood ran cold through the veins of Evelina, as these dreadful words met her ears, and sbe noticed the almost fiendish looks of Stephen and his guilty associate in crime. She could with difficulty repress a scream, but she controlled her feelings much better than might bave been expected, and again listened atten tively. These reflections distracted the brain of Eve lina, and made her, for a time, totally unconscious of everything around her; but, at length, feeling somewhat fatigued, sbe entered a small arbour, which was her favourite place at al) times for rumination, and seating herself, gave free indul gence to the conflicting thoughts whicb occupied her mind. But the conversation was now conducted in so low a tone, that she could only catch a word here and there, and those were not calculated to throw any further light upon the nefarionB plot. ,' Well,' said Stephen at last, rising, ' I must now leave you. I go to complete my arrange ments with the men, and to make every prepara tion for the seizure of the girl this evening. Good morning.' She bad not been long there, when she heard footsteps approaching, and peeping forth, her astonishment and curiosity were not a little excited to behold walking that way, arm in arm, in the most familiar manner, Stephen Black thorn and Mrs. Snacks. They were deeply engaged in conversation, and the peculiarity of their looks struck Evelina with a feeling fast approaching to dread. She did not wish them to discover her there, for she always felt a most uncomfortable sensation in tbe presence of Stephen Blackthorn; she therefore stole into one corner of the arbour, where she could dis tinctly notice all tbat passed, without being observed herself. ' Good morning, Stephen,' responded Mrs. Snacks ; ' to-morrow morning at this time, I trust, Evelina Marsden will be far away from here.' The two guilty wretches now separated, Stephen Blackthorn letting himself out by the garden gate, and Mis. Snacks returning to tbe hall. The two worthies passed by the arbour, convening in an under tone, but occasionally laughing loudly, as if the subjact they were discussing afforded them infinite satisfaction, and took their seat on a bench beneath the wide spreading branches of a venerable oak, ao immediately contiguous to the pace where Evelina was concealtd, that she could distinctly overhear all that passed. CHAPTER XXtV. THE PLOT DEFEATED. \u2014 VILL ANY ENTRAPPED. \u2014 THE POCKET-BOOK. With what feelings of astonishment, horror, and disgust did Evelina listen to this guiliy conversation. How had she been deceived ! From what a terrible fate had she thus provi dentially been rescued. Aod was it possible that Lord Sidley was the projector of all the cruel designs against her 1 he tue father of that amiable Westbourne, whom she so fondly loved ? The idea was monstrous. And what miscreants were Stephen Blackthorn and the old house keeper ! How Bhe trembled when she reflected upon the words or Stephen, namely, to the effect that if he could not obtain her uncle's gold by any other means, he would not hesitate to shed hia blood I It seemed scarcely possible that there should be such monsters in existence. Stephen Blackthorn's countenance, and that of bis companion, exhibited the most malicionB triumph, and Evelina could uot help shuddering with an instinctive seeling of horror and di. gust as sbe gazed upen them, and in vain endeavoured to Imagine what could be the meaning of Ste phen's early visit to the hall, and foi what purpose he and the housekeeper met. Her name being mentioned in no very respect ful way by Stephen, Evelina's curiosity was more than ever excited, and she listened to catch tbe conversation with breathless attention. * It is a capital forgery,' were the first words sbe distinctly heard Stephen speak, * and reflects much credit on Lord Sidley's ingenuity. So Evelina received tbe letter with avidity, and seemed to think it a genuine one V It was some minutes ere she could sufficiently recover herself to leave the arbour ; but at length, with faltering steps, she arose, and making her way to the hall, entered at the same door from which she had issued forth. She immediately Bought her chamber, where, sinking on the bed, ahe remained for some lime totally absorbed in thoughts of the most distracting and conflicting ' She did,' answered hia companion ; the poor fool was gulled, I could see in a minute, and immediately hastened to her own apartment. Nothing could have been planned better.' ' Ha l ha ! ha !' laughed Blackthorn triumph*"], [165, "OR, POVERTY, CRIME, AND SORROW. 157 nature. Then she sank on her knees and fervently poured forth her gratitude to the Most High for her preservation from a fate that waB too dreadful to think upon. to interrupt him ; in fact, she was too much agitated herself to do so. At length Mr. Langston became m.ie com posed, and as a sudden thought seemed to flaBh npon his brain, he exclaimed* \u2014 Nor was the uncertainty she was still left in as to the fate of Westbourne less agonising to her feelings. Her tears slowed fast as this reflection rushed upon her mind. ' Ob, it is most fortunate, my Evelina, tbat you happened to overhear this guilty conversa tion. The wretches shall be caught in their own snares. You shall keep the appointment this evening, child.' But what was to be done in this emergency ? Concealment was no longer possible; it would be criminal. She was determined to seek the presence of her uncle without delay, and reveal everything to him. ' Keep the appointment, my dear uncle ?' said our heroine, with the greatest amszement. 'Yes, Evelina, but I will take good care tbat there shall be tboie at band who shall pounce upon and seize the villains, just at the moment of their expected triumph. I will instantly go to my friend the justice, and making him acquainted with all tbe particulars, obtain his assistance. You shall go to the place of assigna tion, but closely followed by those who will protect you from danger. Think you tbat >ou will bave sufficient fortitude to accomplish the task, Evelina V Having exerted herself to the utmost to regain some degree of composure, she hastened from her chamber to the apartment in which she knew Mr. Langston was to be found. He looked amazed and alarmed on her en trance, wben he noticed the paleness of her looks, and the agitation of her general domeanour, especially when she sunk on her knees before him, and gazed imploringly up In his face. He raised her tenderly and with much anxiety, and then begged that she would endeavour to calm her emotions, and to inform him what it was that so alarmed her. ' Oh, yes, my dear uncle,' answered our he roine ; ' but bow will you act towards that bad woman, Mrs. Snacks, ln the meantime V 4 Ob, my dear uncle,' she at length ejaculated, 'how shall I address you? How supplicate your forgiveness V * Take no more notice than as if nothing unusual had happened, until her guilty accom plices are secured,' returned Mr. Langston ; ' and I would advise you, my love, to keep our of her way as mnch as possible during the day, lest you should, by betraying any particular emotion, excite her suspicions. Your friend Helen will be here shortly, I dare say, and you will receive the benefit of her advice and society.' Mr. Langston started with the most unfeigned amazement at her words. Forgive you, my dear child,' he said ; ' what can there possibly be that should compel you to seek forgiveness from met' * For having concealed that from your know ledge, my dear sir, which might have been productive of the most dreadful consequences,' exclaimed Evelina. ' Oh, I shudder wheu I think of them.* Neither Evelina nor ber uncle could partake, except but sparingly, of the morning repast, and as Boon as it was over, the latt r took his hat and stick and departed to the house of the magistrate ; and Evelina sat herself down to ruminate upon all that had taken place, and to prepare herself for the adventure of the evening, which she could not but hope might have been avoided. ' For Heaven's sake, what can you mean, Evelina V ' I have, my uncle, some fearful facts to disclose which will fill your breast with horror. But it will not do to hesitate ; there is no time to be los'. Listen to me, then, with patience, I beg of you.' Mr. Langston, overwhelmed with astonish ment, drew his chair closer to her, and awaited the revelation with the utmost anxiety, but frequently, during Evelina's recital, he inter rupted her to give vent to his feelings of resent ment, disgust, and horror. * Good God f he exclaimed, when she had concluded, * to what a tale of guilt have I been listening. Can it be possible that there are such monsters iu the world ! And that miscreant, Stephen, to whom I have been so warm a friend, whom I have fostered in my home, to be the grand mover in these hideous designs, and ev_n to contemplate shedding the blood of his benefactor ! Oh, the villain ! But he is discovered now, and justice Bhall at last overtake him, and hls lordly employer. That infamous woman, too, whom I have ever treated with so much kindness, and whom I believed to be a very paragon of excellence, oh, Bhe shall have good cause to repent her brutal and un grateful conduct.' The old man paused to give vent to the power of bis emotions, aud Evelina did not offer Mr. Langston speedily made arrangements for the defeat of the villains, and bad enlisted into his service the stnrdy labourers of Helen's father, la addition t _ a good force of constabulary. * * * * The day passed slowly away, evening set in, and at length the time arrived when it was necessary that Evelina should depart on her important task. She felt unusual courage on the occasion, and her uncle having embraced her, and given her his blessing, she left by the back way, in order that the suspicions of Mrs. Snacks might not be excited. With hasty steps, she proceeded towards the chestnut avenue, her heart throbbing with expec tation. She arrived there \u2014 the moon was shining brightly, but sbe saw no one near the spot. Sbe bad not been there many minutes, however, wk.n she beard a shrill whistle, and immediately afterwards she found herself in the arms of a powerful man, who wore a mask, and surrounded by several otber ruffians, who were masked like himself. Scarcely bad he seized ber, however, when the constables rushed out from their p'ace of concealment, and the man who held Evelina was felled to the earth, and"], [166, "EVELINA, THE PAUPER'S CHILD. 158 I Immediately secured. That man was Stephen Blackthorn, whose countenance, on being de tected, evinced the evil passions of a demon, while his rage was eo great tbat he could not give utterance to it. But a few days more, and it was ascertained that Richard Marsden had also given himself up to the officers ofthe law, to take his trial as a returned transport. Oh, how vain would it be for us to attempt to pourtray the ogony of Eve lina aud Mr. LangBton when they received this intelligence ; or to give anything like an adequate idea of the scene which followed when tho father and daughter met once more after the lapse of so many years within the gloomy walls of a dun geon. Wa must leave it to the imagination of tbe reader. A few minutes decided the affray ; several of the ruffians were secured \u2014 otherB fled. Black thorn was conveyed to prison, and Evelina was conducted to the hall, where Bhe was welcomed by her nncle with the most unbounded feelings of delight. In the meantime, Mrs. Sua-ks, who by some means or other ha_ been apprised of what had taken place, had contrived to effect her escape. Lord Sidley lingered on so? some week*, wb*n he breathed his last, truly penitent, and conBoied by the presence of his sod, who no sooner beaid ofthe dangerous situation of the earl, than he broke from his seclusion, which bad ooly been a few miles from the vicinity of the Dark Hal!, and hastened to his bedside, where a mutual recon ciliation took place. On searching the person of Blackthorn, a pocket-book w.s found containing numerous letters from Lord Sidley, fully disclosing their guilt ; and also a printed bill, apparently some jea-s old, offeting a reward for the apprehension of a man who had committed a daring highway robbery, and the description of whose features and person exactly corresponded with those of Stephen, leaving but little room to dou.t .hat be was the actual!, guilty man. And now tbe day of the three important trials arrived ; \u2014 Stephen Blackthorn was charged with committing a highway robbery ten years previous, to which he pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to perpetual banishment. Joseph Hecshaw was charged on hiB own con fession with the wilful murder of Lieutenant - Colonel O/mond, and was convicted on the most unquestionable evidence, at the same time that the innocence of Richard Marsden was fully established. CHAPTER XXV. STRANGE EVENTS. CONCLU ION. Towards the evening of tbe day following ihese remarkable events, a horseman rode up with breathless baste to tbe door of the Dark Hall, and requested to see Mr. Langaton imme diately ; and on that gentleman making his appearance, to his utter amazement, the . es senger informed him that he came from Lord Sidley at Sarnscombe, am' delivered into his hand a letter addressed to him in his lordship's handwriting. Mr. Langston hastily broke ihe seal, and persued with wonder the contents. The unfortunate father of our heroine was then arraigned at tbe bar, charged with having been illegally found at large iu this country after having been transported beyond the seas for the term of hia natural life. The sensation this trial excited was immense, and every one deeply com miserated the misfortunes of the prisoner. Of course, the jury could not do otherwise than find him guilty, but wiih a strong recommendation to mercy. It stated that a few hours before his lordship bad been taken suddenly ill, and was considered in great danger. He also stated that be was now suffering all the pangs of an overburdened con science. He fully confessed his guilty Intentions towards Evelina, and implored her and her uncle's forgiveness. He also acknowledged that although possessed of an ample fortune of bis own, avarice bad goaded him on to take advan tage of tbe favour with which he was viewed by Mr. Marsden's father, and that he bad forged the will by *hich he deprived that uufortunaje man of bis rights, and be informed him where tbe real will was deposited. He concluded his letter by once more supplicating forgiveness for all the injuries he had done them. No time was lost; every influence waB em ployed, and soccessfully ; in less than a week Mr. Marsden received bis mostGracious Majesty's free pardon, aud was not only restored to tbe arms of bis beloved daughter, but to the property of his ancestors, of which tae had been so long deprived. Two years elapsed, and in that time the gloomy past was almost forgotten, and they all looked forward to future happiness. Wtstbournehad been received by Mr. Marsden as the lover of bis daughter ; he forgot the errors of the father in the virtues of the son ; aud all the preliminaries beiog settled, Evelina, once tbe pauper child, became the Countes Westbourne Sidley. We need not say wbat excitement this letter caused in tbe minds . f Evelina and her uncle. In the course of a few days more another i_c portart event occurred\u2014 a wretched object of humanity gave himself up as the murderer of Coonel Ormond, and at tbe same time stating that he should be able to. exculpate Richard Mars den from any participation in the dime. Two years afterwards, Helen was united to an rslicer in the aimy, a mosteBtimable man, and with whom the experienced every felicity. Mr. Langs on lived for mary years a*_tr these events, ?nd ever blessed the night ef the snow storm, which led the little Evelina to the door of bis own hospitable mansion.
