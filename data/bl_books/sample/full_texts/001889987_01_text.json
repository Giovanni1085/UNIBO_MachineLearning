IF Topographical History be considered either useful or entertaining, an account of Berwick upon Tweed, and its Vicinity, in their ancient and modern state, has pe culiar claims to public patronage.

Some have sup posed that being a Town of the Bernicians, Berwick hence derived its name ; but from the silence of writers previous to the inva sion of the Danes, it has little claim to its present appellation from this circumstance. The probability is that Berwick owes its name to the Anglo-Saxons, from the un clothed or naked appearance it every where exhibits ; and the Saxon word Bar, naked, and Wic, a Village or Castle, is the probable origin of Berwick.* It is not easy however \u2022 Chalmer's Caledonia."], [17, "HISTORY OF BERWICK. 7 to ascertain whether TPlc applied to the Town or the Castle,* but most likely to the latter ; for Castles affording protection and shelter in rude ages produced a village under their walls, and some powerful North umbrian Baron may have built the Castle of Berwick for his own accommodation, on the naked and rugged height, where its ruins in mutilated grandeur still remain. Thus the Castle gave protection to the Town, and the Town gave rise to the Bridge across the river Tweed in those un commercial times, f Others have supposed that Berwick de rives its name from the circumstance of being placed at the mouth of a river, and that it was originally called Aberivic, from t Ibid. * Chalmer's Caledonia. a2"], [18, "8 HISTORY OF BERWICK.

Richard I. of England, the most warlike Prince of his time, moved with pious indignation for the sufferings of the Christians in the East, and perhaps equally moved with the love of mi litary glory, was easily induced to lend his assistance to the other Powers of Europe, to stop the victorious Saladin in his career of Conquest, and deliver imperial Salem from the hands of the unbelievers. \u2014 B"], [28, "18 HISTORY OF BERWICK.

His departure from the East was likewise hastened by the dis agreeable intelligence that Philip King of France, instigated and assisted by his bro ther John, whom he had left Regent of England during his absence, had invaded his French Provinces, and persuaded his subjects to throw off their allegiance to Richard. \u2014 But in attempting to pass through Germany, he fell into the hands of the Emperor Henry VI. by whom he was unjustly detained a prisoner for twelve B 2"], [30, "20 HISTORY OF BERWICK. months, and at last released by a vast sum raised for his ransom by his faithful sub jects in England.

A few years previous to this event, John had incurred the displeasure of the Pope, respecting the election of an Archbishop to the vacant See of Canterbury Weak and wavering in all his Councils, this unhappy Monarch sent to solicit the Pope's confirma tion of the choice that had been made, who immediately declared it null and void, and commanded him to nominate Stephen $3"], [32, "22 HISTORY OF BERWICK.

This ill-timed and useless menace brought upon him all the fulminations of the Vatican ; his King dom was laid under an interdict ; himself excommunicated ; his subjects absolved from their allegiance, and a formal donation of England made to Philip King of France.

Langton, in order to revenge himself on John for the opposition he had met with, exhorted the Barons to insist on the re newal and observance of the Charter, granted by Henry I., and after various at tempts* to evade the demand, he was at last"], [35, "HISTORY OF BERWICK. 25 obliged to set his Seal to the Charter which was required of him, on the 19th day of June, 1215. \u2014 This famous deed, commonly called Magna Charta, either granted or se cured very important liberties and privileges to every order of men in the Kingdom ; to the Clergy, to the Barons, and to the People. * During this struggle, the discon tented Barons in the North of England purchased the friendship of Alexander, the young King of Scotland, by doing homage to him, and he immediately proceeded to invest the Castle of Norham with all the forces he could collect.

Al though the merits of this great cause were examined and discussed with much solem nity, Edward was suspected of using undue influence with the Judges appointed to try it, and the preference was given to Baliol, because it was expected he would prove a more submissive vassal to Edward than Bruce, and under him, a recognition of his sovereignty over Scotland would more rea dily be acknowledged. In virtue of this assumed sovereignty, orders were issued by the English Monarch, for placing Baliol on the throne of Scotland, and, being solemnly crowned at Scoone, on the 30th day of November, 1292, he short ly after did homage to Edward, at New castle-upon-Tyne, for himself and his King dom."], [43, "HISTORY OF BERWICK. 33 Baliol, however, soon found, that al- though seated on a throne, and surrounded with all the insignia of royalty, his power was only nominal, and that upon every trifling complaint of his own subjects, he was imperiously summoned to appear be- fore Edward, to answer for his conduct.

It was further stipulated, that, during that time, a cessation of arms should take place, the lives and property of the inhabitants to be protected, in case they were forced to surrender, and the Governor permitted to repair to the Scottish camp to communicate the conditions to the Regent. To ensure the performance of these conditions, the two sons of Sir Alexander Seton, who as-"], [72, "62 HISTORY OF BERWICK. sumed the command in the Governor's ab sence, were delivered as hostages, and hos tilities immediately ceased on both sides. But Edward, hearing that the Scots were collecting in great numbers, and dis regarding not only the sacredness of an existing treaty, but his own honour as a King, and a man, demanded the immediate surrender of the place, threatening, in case of a refusal, to hang the two Sons of Seton in view of the garrison.

For more than twenty years, Berwick remained in possession of the English, when in 1355, it was taken by assault, by the Earls of Angus and Dunbar, but soon after retaken by Edward, who concluded a peace with the Scots, and David, brother of Robert Bruce, after seven years' capti vity, was, in consequence, restored to the Throne and Kingdom of Scotland.

Rules for the regulation of their time and their studies, were form ed, and strictly observed, and hence they re ceived the name of Methodists. \u2014 Although this was the origin of the name, it is often contemptuously applied to every individual who is particularly distinguished for piety * Smith's Sketches of the Relief Church."], [111, "HISTORY OF BERWICK. 101 of Use, or a more than ordinary concern for the salvation of Mankind. In the year 1735, this Society was joined by the celebrated Geoige Whitfield, whose unwearied exertions, and ardent zeal, in preaching the Gospel of Truth, are perhaps unequalled. A difference arose between Wesley and Whitfield, in the year 1741, which in some measure still continues to divide their followers ; the former profess ing the doctrines of Arminius, whilst Whitfield declared his full assent to the doctrines of Calvin.

SEVERAL measures for accelerating the commercial prosperity of the Town of Berwick have been adopted by the present inhabitants, amongst which the building of a New Pier is not the least important.

This sum was intended to be appropriated exclusively to the relief of the labouring Poor, and to combine the utility of the object with the industry of the people. Accordingly, two roads from the Town, one leading to the New Pier, and the other down the steep Banks, near the Old Castle, along the side of the River above a mile, were projected and immediately begun, and * The present Mayor is William Pattison.

The Quay extends from the Bridge upwards of 200 yards down the Rive-; and is well calculated for loading and unloading vessels, with safety and ex pedition.

The Fisheries lie on both sides of the River, although those on the South side are reck oned the best, and the limits of each Water, as it is called, are distinctly marked out. The mode of fishing is thus described by Mr. Pennant : \u2014 \" One man goes off in a small flat-bot \" tomed boat, square at one end, and \" taking as large a circle as his net admits, \" brings it on shore at the extremity of his \" boundary, where others assist in landing \" it.

DURING the Thirteenth Century, al most all the Foreign Trade of Scotland was conducted by the Merchants of Berwick. In carrying on this Commerce, they suffer ed much from the Garrison of a Fort, erected at Tweedmouth by King John ; and which, in consequence of their com plaints, was twice destroyed by William I. King of Scotland. Under the protection and encouragement of Alexander III., the Foreign Trade of Berwick was very con siderable ; and proposals were made to him, by several of the most eminent Mer chants in Europe, for establishing different"], [153, "143 HISTORY OF BERWICK, Manufactories here, and in other parts of Scotland. When Edward III. became Master of Berwick, after the battle of Hallydown Hill, he issued a proclamation, inviting foreign Merchants to take up their resi dence here ; but in 1350, prohibited Wool, Hides, and other articles, to be imported into Berwick, or sold to any native of Scotland. This illiberal order was relaxed in 1399, and in 1414 was rescinded altoge ther. Berwick does not possess so much foreign Commerce as might be expected from its situation ; which perhaps may, in some measure, be owing to the exclusive right to trade formerly claimed by the Burgesses of the Town, in virtue of a Charter granted to them as a Corporate Body."], [154, "144 HISTORY OF BERWICK. Of this exclusive right, they were then rigidly tenacious ; hence adventurers were prevented from establishing Manufactories here, and hence the Burgesses deprived themselves of those advantages, which other places enjoyed, where Commerce was encouraged, unfettered by such selfish and illiberal restrictions. It is however but candid to state, that the exclusive right to trade, claimed by the Freemen, has of late years been very pro perly from time to time relaxed, and much to the credit of the Borough, has given place to a more liberal line of conduct. In 1753, a very judicious Order of Guild was passed, for the encouragement of Trade and Manufactures in the Town ; which was published in all the Papers of that day, offering to any Person beginning"], [155, "HISTORY OF BERWICK. 145 any new Branch of Trade or Manufacture, the same Privileges in respect to Trade as Burgesses then enjoyed.

Timber - 2336 Loads. Deals - 57 Hundred. Staves - 99 ditto. Iron - 59 Tons. Hemp - 795 Cwt. Flax - 33 ditto. Tallow - 195 ditto. Whale Oil - 177 Tons.
