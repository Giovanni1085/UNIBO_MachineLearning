CHAPTER I. A.T the commencement of the year 1824, numerous and unprovoked aggressions committed by the Burmese upon the S. E. frontier of the possessions of the Honorable East India Company, having induced the Right Honorable the Governor-General in Council to decide upon attacking them in their own country, a division of troops was ordered to be embarked at Calcutta, under the command of Brigadier Michael M'Creagh, C. B., and another division at Madras, under Brigadier-General William Macbean : the command of those forces united was entrusted to Sir Archibald Camp bell, K. C. B. On the 12th March, 1824, George Swinton, Esq. Secretary to the Supreme Government, in the Secret and Political De partment, addressed a letter to Commodore Charles Grant, C. B., commanding His Majesty's squadron in India, of which the following is an extract : \u2014 \" I am directed by the Right Honorable the Governor-General in Council to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch of the 25ih ultimo, and to convey to you the cordial acknowledgments of the Government, for the prompt and valuable aid, which it is your intention to afford his Lordship in Council, in the prosecution of offensive operations against the Burman nation. B"], [12, "2 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, \" In the event of your being able, without injury to the service in which you are now engaged, to proceed to Rangoon \u2022 in the months of May or June, either touching at Madras, for the purpose of accompanying the second division of troops from that presidency, or repairing at once to the scene of action, his Lordship in Council would anticipate the most essential benefit to the expedition, from the presence of his Majesty's ship, and your personal superintendence of the measures which it may be found ex pedient to undertake against Rangoon, and the other maritime possessions of the enemy.\" Commodore Grant was then at Bombay, in the Liffey 50, busily employed in superintending the equipment of the Asia, a new 84-gun ship, which he was anxious to despatch to England. He had previously directed Captain Frederick Marryat, of the Larne sloop, to proceed to the river Hooghly; to take the Sophie brig, Captain George Frederick Ryves, under his orders ; and to follow the directions of the Su preme Government as to the best means of employing the Larne and her consort. On the 2d April, Mr. Swinton acquainted Captains Mar ryat and Ryves, that the expedition under the command of Sir Archibald Campbell, being about to proceed against Ran goon, after touching at Port Cornwallis, in the Great Anda man island, he had been directed to intimate to them the re quest of the Governor-General in Council, that the senior officer of the sloops of war, detached by Commodore Grant to accompany the armament, should assume the naval com mand of it, subject to the direction of the Brigadier- General commanding the forces. \" Sir Archibald Campbell,\" added' the secretary, \"will apprise you in detail of the objects of the expedition, in which the services of the naval force ivill be of the most essential use ; and his Lordship in Council relies with confidence on your affording that cordial and zealous co-operation, which ever distinguishes His Majesty's navy, when employed with land forces in the service of their country.\" At the particular request of Captain Marryat, the Governor- The principal sea-port in the dominions of the Kin** of Ava."], [13, "DURING THE BURMESE WAR. 3 General in Council directed a 6mall steam-vessel, the first ever seen in India, to be purchased, and added to the expedi tion *. Sir Archibald Campbell left Calcutta on the 8th April, embarked with his staff on board the Larne, and pro ceeded in that ship to Port Cornwallis. The Bengal trans ports sailed thither without any escort, but those from Ma dras were convoyed to that place by the Sophie. The celerity with which the Governor-General in Council determined and acted upon his plan of operations precluded the possibility of Commodore Grant proceeding from Bombay to Calcutta, in time to superintend the naval preparations, even had he not been engaged in other important duties. Owing to calms and very light winds, the Bengal division did not reach the place of rendezvous before the end of April, and the Madras division not until the 2d of May ; at which period several ships from both presidencies were still absent. Sir Archibald Campbell had, however, determined to sail with the force then assembled at Port Cornwallis, and would have done so on that day, had he not been prevented by a general report of the scarcity of fresh water on board the Madras transports, some of them not having enough for more than four days' consumption. \"This difficulty,\" says he, \" was very speedily removed by Captain Marryat, whose indefatigable exertions in collecting and appropriating the scanty supply which the land springs afforded, and distri buting a proportion from such vessels as were well supplied to those most in need, enabled him, on the following day, to report the fleet ready to put to sea. As we were accordingly getting under weigh, H. M. S. Liffey appeared in the offing, and likewise several of the absent transports. Judging that some of them might also be in want of water, and being de sirous of making the necessary arrangements with Commodore * No where can steam-vessels be employed more advantageously than on the Irrawaddy ; but they should never draw more than five feet water, when deep, and their bottoms ought to be flat and very strong, as they must often be unavoidably run with force upon sands which shift every monsoon. b2"], [14, "4 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, Grant, relative to our future operations, I determined upon remaining in harbour one day longer. On the following morning (May 5th), we finally put to sea, detaching a part of my force, under Brigadier M'Creagh*, against the island of Cheduba, and sending another detachment, under Major Wahab, of the Madras establishment, against Negrais, pro ceeding myself with the main body for the Rangoon river, which we reached on the 10th, and anchored within the bar.\" The naval force attached to this expedition consisted of the Liffey 50, Commodore Grant ; Slaney 20, Captain Charles Mitchell ; Larne 20, Captain Frederick Marryat ; and Sophie 18, Captain George Frederick Ryves ; four of the Honorable Company's cruisers, under the command of Captain Henry Hardy; a Penang government vessel ; eighteen brigs, schoon ers, and other small craft (formerly pleasure yachts on the Gan ges), each armed with two light carronades and four swivels, and maimed with twelve Lascars, under the command of a Eu ropean ; twenty row-boats, lugger-rigged (formerly Calcutta pilot- boats), each carrying an 18-pounder in the bow, and manned with from 16 to 20 Lascars ; the Diana, steam-vessel ; and about forty sail of transports, only one or two of which had English crews. The Hon. Company's cruisers were manned with British sailors, Hindoos, and Mahometans ; and all the row-boats were under the command of Mr. William Lind quist, of the Bengal pilot service. The total number of fighting men embarked at Calcutta and Madras, in April, 1824, was 8701, of whom 4077 were British troops. On the morning of the 1 1th May, the fleet, led by the Liffey and Larne, sailed up the Rangoon river, without any pilots on board, and in the course of a few hours arrived off the town, meeting with no greater opposition than some insig nificant discharges of artillery from one or two of the guard houses on either bank. \" Henzawaddy, or the province of Rangoon, is a delta * In the Hon. Company's timber-ship Eranud, Captain David Jones, escorted by the Slaney sloop of war."], [15, "5 DURING THE BURMESE WAR. formed by the mouths of the Irrawaddy, and, with the ex ception of some considerable plains of rice-ground, is covered by a thick and tenacious jungle, intersected by numerous creeks and rivers.*\" The town of Rangoon is situated on the northern bank of a main branch of that great river, where it makes a short bend from east to west, about 28 miles from the sea. It extends for about 903 yards along the river, and is about 600 or 700 yards wide in its broadest part : at either extremity extend unprotected suburbs, but the centre, or town itself, is defended by an enclosure of palisades, ten or twelve feet high, strengthened internally by embankments of earth, and protected externally on one side by the river, and at the western end by a morass, over which there is a bridge. The palisade encloses the town in the shape of an irregular pa rallelogram, having one gate in each of three faces, and two in that of the north : at the river gate is a landing place, de nominated the King's Wharf, in which situation the principal battery, of apparently from 12 to 16 guns, was placed, and opposite to which the Liffey anchored about 2 p. m. This battery was manned and ready to open its fire. \"Still,\" says Sir Archibald Campbell, \"from motives of hu manity, the Commodore and myself were unwilling to com mence so unequal a contest, thinking the immense supe riority on our side, within full view of the shore, would have induced the authorities in the town to make an offer of ne gociating : their presumption and folly, however, led them to pursue a different course; a feeble, ill -supported, and worse directed fire was opened upon us, which the first few guns from the Liffey effectually silenced, and cleared the battery. I had previously ordered the plan of attack, and now gave directions for two brigades to be in readiness in their boats for landing. His Majesty's 38th regiment, com manded by Major [Thomas] Evans, above the town; Major [Robert Henry] Sale, with H.

On the three succeeding days, the boats, with some soldiers of H. M. 41st regiment, were again despatched on the same service ; and in executing the duty assigned to them, they had five men wounded by the fire of musketry from villages and fortified breast- works. In the mean time the troops at Rangoon were put under cover ; one brigade in the town, and the others in the vicinity of the Shwe-da-gon pagoda (about two miles and a half distant), which is the largest and most ancient in the Burman empire. Although so little resistance had been offered by the Bur mese at Rangoon, the following general order was issued by the Supreme Government, June 2d, 1824 : \" A royal salute and three vollies of musketry to be fired at all the stations of the land forces serving in the East Indies, in honor of the cap ture of Rangoon, by the combined naval and military forces under the command of his Excellency Commodore Grant, C.B. and Brigadier-Gene ral Sir Archibald Campbell, K. C. B.\" The first hand-to-hand conflict with the enemy took place on the 16th May, and is thus described by Captain Richard Birch, of H. M. 38th regiment, in a letter of that date, ad dressed to Sir Archibald Campbell : \" I have the honor to inform you, that in obedience to your orders, I this morning embarked with the grenadier company of H. M. 38th regi ment, under my command, on board the boats of H. M. S. Liffey, com manded by Lieutenant James Wilkinson, R. N. for the purpose of dislodg ing the enemy from the village of Kemmendine* and the adjacent villages. \" Agreeable to my instructions, I landed the troops at a small village about a mile from Kemmendine, where I observed a party of the enemy had stockaded themselves, and immediately attacked their position, which I carried, after exchanging a few rounds and killing 10 or 12 of the ene my. I then endeavoured to penetrate the jungle towards the village of Kemmendine, for the purpose of assailing it by the rear, while the boats attacked it in front ; but I regret to say, that I found the jungles so im pervious, as to prevent me from executing this part of my instructions. I therefore re-embarked my detachment, and proceeded in the boats. \" On approaching a point higher up, intending to land, we found our selves suddenly exposed to a heavy fire from a stockade, till then unob- * A war-boat station, three miles above Rangoon."], [18, "8 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, served ; and as any attempt to retire would have given encouragement to the enemy, Lieutenant Wilkinson and myself resolved upon immediately landing and storming the stockade. \" We had many unforeseen difficulties to overcome, the enemy having placed bamboos and spikes so as to make landing both difficult and dan gerous. Nothing, however, could withstand the gallantry and determina tion of both soldiers and sailors, who shortly established themselves within the stockade, defended by about 400 men, who were quickly driven out at the point of the bayonet, leaving 60 dead. \" The enemy were well armed, a great proportion having muskets, and a small field-piece was taken in the stockade. I must do them the justice to say that they fought with very great spirit, many of them receiving our charge with their spears. \"I again re-embarked my party, and proceeded to the opposite side of the river, where we drove tbe enemy from a third stockade, which we de stroyed in the same manner as we had done the two former. \" In concluding, I regret to state, that Lieutenant Thomas Kerr, of H. M. 38th regiment, and one private were killed, and nine privates wounded, in taking the second stockade ; and I have further to regret, that Lieutenant Wilkinson, R. N. was severely wounded (by a musket-ball) through the thigh, with eight or nine of his crew, one of whom has since had his arm amputated. I have much satisfaction in reporting the conduct of the offi cers and men under my command to have been steady and soldier-like. / hope I may be allowed to express the highest admiration of the cool and intrepid conduct of Lieutenant Wilkinson, R. N., who, although severely wounded, continued to render me the greatest assistance in giving directions from his boat ; also of the officers and men under his command.\" Not a syllable of this conflict is mentioned by Major Snod grass, in his \" Narrative of the Burmese War.\" On the 31st May, Captain Marryat succeeded to the chief command of the naval force at Rangoon, on the departure of Commodore Grant, in ill health, for Pulo-Penang, where that excellent officer died on the 25th July following. The Su preme Government had previously requested that Captain Marryat might be allowed to command the expedition up the Irrawaddy, and this was most readily assented to by the commodore. Some heavy rains had fallen previous to the departure of the Liffey ; and it very soon appeared, there was little chance of the army quitting Rangoon and its neighbourhood before the end of the S. W. monsoon, as the disappearance of the inhabitants rendered it impossible to provide and equip a"], [19, "9 DURING THE BURMESE WAR. flotilla necessary to proceed up the Irrawaddy, or even to man it with rowers if one had been equipped. The same circumstance, and the desolate state of the country, from which nothing in the shape of supplies was to be procured, rendered it equally certain, that both for the temporary occu pation of Rangoon, and the eventual march into the interior, the force was entirely dependent upon the presidencies of Bengal and Madras, for every description of conveyance and food : a state of things which was little to have been expected, from the known commerce and supposed resources of Ran goon, and for which, accordingly, no previous preparation had been made. \" Every act of the enemy,\" says Sir Archi bald Campbell, in a despatch dated June 1, 1824, \" evinces a most marked determination of carrying hostility to the very last extremity ; approaching our posts day and night, under cover of an impervious and uncombustible jungle, constructing stockades and redoubts on every road and pathway, even within musket-shot of our sentries ; and, from their hidden fastnesses, carrying on a most barbarous and harassing war fare ; firing upon our sentries at all hours of the night, and lurking on the outskirts of the jungle, for the purpose of carrying off any unlucky wretch whom chance may throw in their way*.\" On the 2d June, Sir Archibald Campbell received informa tion, that the enemy had assembled in great force, and were stockading themselves at Kemmendine, intending to attack the British lines. He therefore ordered two strong columns of reconnoissance from the Madras division, to move, on the morning of the 3d June, upon two roads leading from the Shwe-da-gon pagoda to the above village, and proceeded him- * At Rangoon, the S. W. monsoon sets in about the 5th May, with rain and squalls for four or five days. Fine weather succeeds for a fortnight, when heavy rains commence, and last with few short intervals till July.

From the end of October till the beginning of May, the weather is delightfully cool and settled, but the heavy fogs which prevail the greater part of that time are very pernicious, exciting agues and fevers."], [20, "10 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, self in the H. C. cruiser Mercury, Captain Richard E. Good ridge, with three companies of the 41st regiment, the Thetis cruiser, and several row-boats, under the command of Captain Ryves, for the purpose of observing the Burman force, and making a diversion in favour of any attack which might take place by land. At 7 a. m., the cruisers and flotilla anchored and com menced firing on a large stockade, while the soldiers of the 41 st regiment landed and burnt the enemy's encampment, destroying also one war-boat, and capturing another, with out the least annoyance. In the course of the morning, the two columns coming down from the Shwe-da-gon pagoda met close to the principal stockade, a work of unusual strength and extent; but as they moved through a thicket, within gun-shot of their friends afloat, they were mistaken for a body of Burmese, and re ceived a heavy cannonade, which occasioned some loss, and disconcerted the troops, so that they could not afterwards be led to the attack. The following is an extract of the report made by Captain Ryves to Captain Marryat : \" The pinnaces of H. M. sloops Larne and Sophie, when proceeding in advance, carried a small stockade, from which was brought an 18-pounder carronade ; they were afterwards engaged under a most harassing fire of carronades and musketry from another stockade, and I am sorry to say, suffered severely, though infinitely less than could have been expected on such service \u2022. \" The commander of the Honorable Company's cruiser Thetis being severely wounded when I was on board, I took command of her j but Sir A.

M. sloop Sophie, and has always met my warmest approbation ; indeed I cannot speak too highly of this meritorious officer ; he has passed his examination for a lieutenant nine years and three months; I hope, therefore, you will take the conduct of this deserving officer into your consideration, and recommend him to the favourable notice of Commodore Grant ; and I trust it may be the means of procuring for him that promotion he so richly deserves *. \" I have every reason to be much satisfied with the co-operation of Lieutenant Thomas Fraser, who commanded the Larne's pinnace, and whose exemplary zeal and gallantry were both conspicuous. \" The zealous conduct of Mr. Charles Scott, who has passed his ex amination for a lieutenant four years, reflected on him great credit +. \" At about 3 p. m., the enemy being in great force, the troops were re embarked; the cruisers and flotilla then weighed, and returned to their former anchorage.\" Previous to this failure, between fifty and sixty large cargo-boats had fallen into the hands of the British ; and Sir Archibald Campbell, anxious to prepare water-transport for part of his army, had ordered them to be cut down and made more manageable : they were calculated, on an average, to carry a complement of 60 men each. In a despatch to the Supreme Government, dated June 4th, he reported the arrival of a reinforcement from Madras, consisting of part of H. M. 89th regiment and two battalions of native infantry, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Miles, C. B. The numerous fire-rafts which the enemy sent down from Kemmendine, had hitherto occasioned to the shipping at Rangoon the most imminent danger of destruction, and kept the naval force in a constant and harassing state of exertion. The incessant annoyance experienced from these attacks rendered it indispensably necessary that the stockades which commanded that part of the river should be occupied by the British forces ; and they were accordingly again attacked, and at length carried, on the 10th June.

At 2 a. h. the Jessey and the row boats took up the position assigned them, about three-quarters of a mile below Kemmendine. The Thetis was anchored at the entrance of a creek about the same distance above Kemmendine, and abreast of the stockade from which the gun was taken on the 3d instant, but which has since been greatly strengthened. The gun-flotilla were to have been placed abreast of the opposite point, forming the entrance of the creek (distinguished by a pagoda), on which, since the 3d, there has been erected a formidable stockade ; but in consequence of the ebb-tide making against them, with the exception of the Robert Spankie and two others, they failed in their endeavours to take up their position, and were brought up a short distance below the Thetis. \" About 10 a. h., the batteries opened their fire against Kemmendine ; the stockade on the pagoda point at the same instant commenced a fire of musketry, and from four small pieces, apparently 4 or 6-pounders, upon the Robert Spankie and the other two gun-vessels opposite to it, which was returned by them, and kept up on both sides for upwards of an hour. The stockades abreast of tbe Thetis not having fired a shot the whole time, and observing that the flotilla did not succeed in silencing the other, I took advantage of the flood-tide just then making, to drop abreast of it in the Thetis, and after a fire of half an hour, so far silenced the enemy that from that time they only fired an occasional musket at intervals when we had ceased, but altogether so badly directed that we had only one man wounded, belonging to a row-boat at that time alongside the Thetis. Having observed a great number of boats, many of a large size, collected about two miles above us, and considering it possible that at night, during \u2022 About 300 Chinese and Malay sailors had recently joined the com bined force at Rangoon, and some time afterwards 500 Mugh boatmen, natives of Arracan, arrived from Chittagong, to assist in transporting the army up the Irrawaddy.

At 6 p. h. the Thetis weighed, and, with the boats a-head to tow, began to drop down the river. \" From the place where we had been at anchor we had seen a great smoke and flame, apparently proceeding from the back of the stockade on the pagoda point ; but which, on our opening the entrance of the creek, we discovered to be a very large fire-raft, composed of a number of coun try boats fastened together, and rapidly drifting down with the stream. By endeavouring to avoid the raft, together with the effect of the strong current setting out of the creek, the Thetis unfortunately grounded on the opposite bank of tbe river, where, in spite of every exertion, she remained until high water next morning. \" The raft grounded on the pagoda point, where it remained burning the whole of the night ; although occasionally large masses separated from the main body and drifted down the river. The most dangerous of these masses were towed on shore by Mr. [George] Winsor, of the Sophie, in the Larne's gig, who described them to be composed of canoes, filled with tar, matting, bamboos, &c. During the night there were some shot fired at the Thetis from the stockades, but without effect. At day-light on the 12th, having succeeded in getting her afloat, we proceeded down the river and anchored at Rangoon *.\" On the 1 1th June, Brigadier M'Creagh addressed an official letter to Sir Archibald Campbell, of which the following are extracts : \u2014 \" I have the honor to report, that in execution of the service you as signed me, I anchored on the eastern side of the island of Cheduba, with the transport Anna Robertson in company, on the night of the 12th ultimo, and found the other transport, and H. M. ship the Slaney already there. I immediately conferred with Captain Mitchell, and, on the 13th, Lieu tenant Mathews, of that ship, made a bold and very intelligent recon noissance up the small river on which the enemy's town is situated, and Here again Major Snodgrass is silent respecting the navy."], [24, "14 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, in our entire ignorance of the localities, his report was of essential use to me in arranging the disembarkation. \"The sbip3 lay three miles from the shore outside of a mud flat, which stretches parallel with the land, and is nearly dry at low water, and the coast on this side is covered with jungle to the edge ; indeed the mouth of the river is not distinguishable at a very little distance. We moved towards it on the morning of the 14th, with as many men as the boats would hold \u2014 200 of H. M. 13th light infantry regiment, and 100 of the 20th native infantry. \" On the southern bank, a short distance up, was an out-post, which was immediately taken possession of by a small party from the leading boat, the Burmese retiring from it without resistance. The river varies in breadth from about 40 to 100 yards, the jungle on both side3 extending far into the water. About half a mile farther up, the ground is cleared and cultivated, and the enemy became visible, lining a trench of 300 yards extent, on the edge of the northern bank, with their right flanked by a bridge over the river. They permitted our boats to range along until the headmost arrived opposite their right, and then opened a fire of musketry and swivels, accompanied by nights of arrows. The bank was steep and somewhat difficult ; but two or three parties of the 13th were soon on its summit, in spite of the enemy's efforts, who opposed them with consider able boldness : a few minutes firing followed, while the remaining boats landed their men, and they fled, leaving upwards of twenty killed and many wounded. Their village or town commences near the spot at which we had landed, and I immediately moved up the street in pursuit ; on ar riving at the end of it (about a quarter of a milel we found a stockade, into which they had retired, and from which they opened a fire as soon as we appeared. It was a square of about 200 yards each face; the outward piles from sixteen to twenty feet high, and an embankment and a parapet within them, salient gateways in each face, and a triple row of railing round the entire exterior, appeared to be in good order, and the fire was from several 6-pounders, as well as swivels of various calibre, and mus ketry. \" I immediately lodged parties at such points close to the work as afforded tolerable cover, ordered the howitzer and two or three ship guns ashore, together with the remainder of the sepoys, and meantime marked off a battery within 1 00 yards of their front gateway. The weather now became exceedingly unfavorable ; but as all gave their most hearty and zealous endeavours to the execution of what was pointed out to them, our want of proper materials, implements, and workmen, was surmounted. Repeated feints upon the enemy's left, sufficed to turn his attention from our work ing parties on his right, and during the night of the 16th, two 9-pounders and a carronade, on ship carriages, were placed in the battery, the hut that masked it was pulled down, and it opened in the morning. Its fire was soon decisive on the gateway, which having been their last thoroughfare,"], [25, "DURING THE BURMESE WAR. 15 was not so strongly embanked as the others. Having prepared some sea men with axes and ropes to accompany the column, I ordered it forward : it moved rapidly to its point, headed by Major Thornhill's company of H. M. 13th ; a few moments sufficed to complete the destruction of the wounded spars, and we were speedily in the stockade, followed by the re serve under Lieutenant-Colonel Hampton, of the 20th native infantry. The Burmese chief in command was killed near the point of attack ; they abandoned their interior defences (a trench and breastwork), and fled through their rear-gate, leaving a great number killed. \" Considering that, throughout these little operations, our investment was very close, and the enemy's fire kept up without any intermission, I am happy to say that our loss has been singularly small \u2022. \" Where all evinced not only ready obedience, but the utmost zeal, it would be difficult to remark upon individual claims to notice; but I must do myself the pleasure to acknowledge the cordial co-operation that I re ceived from Captain Mitchell, of H. M. S. Slaney, who accompanied me at the disembarkation, and to whose readiness in affording me every assist ance his ship could supply, the service was importantly indebted ; and the exertions of his seamen, under the immediate command of Lieutenant Mathews, in getting the guns landed, and assisting in the battery, contri buted essentially to accelerate the result.\" Having succeeded in capturing the Rajah of Cheduba, and made such arrangements regarding the island as circum stances admitted, Brigadier M'Creagh re-embarked the Eu ropean part of his force, and hastened to Rangoon, leaving Cheduba in charge of Lieutenant-Colonel Hampton, and under the protection of the Slaney, which sloop, we believe, was not engaged in any of the subsequent operations against the dominions of Ava. The island of Negrais, a barren de sert, covered with an almost impenetrable jungle, and deep inlets of 6alt-water, was also taken possession of by Major Wahab and Captain Goodridge, who, finding it a place so little calculated for a military post, had already rejoined the commander-in-chief at Rangoon, having previously de stroyed a stockade and twenty-eight boats at the mouth of the Bassein river. After the capture of the Kemmendine stockades, the Bur- * The military detachment had two men killed, and three officers and thirty-three men wounded : the Slaney one marine killed, and her first lieutenant (Henry Bathurst Houston Mathews) and four seamen wounded."], [26, "16 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, mese retired for a short time from the immediate vicinity of the British lines, and concentrated their forces at Donoobew, a strongly fortified town upon the Irrawaddy, about 60 miles to the northward of Rangoon. The rains had now set in, and the effects of a burning sun were only relieved by the tor rents that fell from the accumulated clouds, and which brought disease along with their coolness. Constantly ex posed to the vicissitudes of a tropical climate, and exhausted by the necessity of unintermitted exertion, it need not be matter of surprise that sickness soon began to thin the ranks, and impair the energies of the invaders. No one was ex empt from the operation of these causes, and many officers, including Sir Archibald Campbell and Captain Marryat, were attacked with fever during the month of June. On the 14th, the latter wrote to Commodore Grant, reporting, that he had not a commissioned or warrant officer capable of doing duty; that seven of the Lame's crew had already died from cholera morbus or dysentery, and that 26 more were in the hospital dangerously ill, besides many others slightly attacked or re maining convalescent. \"I am afraid,\" added he, \" that we shall lose many men before we leave this place. The heavy and incessant rains, the unwholesomeness of the water, and the impossibility of procuring fresh provisions, to restore strength to the convalescent, forcibly point it out as the grave of a large part of the expedition.\" From the above circumstances, and as her services were not then essentially required, the Sophie was ordered to Calcutta, and directed to return as soon as possible, with provisions for both sloops, and as many seamen as she could procure, either by entering or impressment. Previous to the Sophie's departure from Rangoon, six 32-pounder \u00abarronades were taken from her, to be mounted with four of the Larne's guns on board the Satellite transport, formerly a sloop of war in H. M. service. On the 25th June, two fire- rafts were destroyed by a small detachment under the command of Mr. Henry Lister Maw, midshipman of the Liffey, who had been left behind by Com modore Grant to act as naval aide-de-camp to Sir Archibald"], [27, "17 DURING THE BURMESE WAR. Campbell, and who was then employed in surveying the river above Kemmendine. On receiving intelligence of the occupation of Rangoon, by the British armament, the Court of Ava was far from feeling any apprehension or alarm : on the contrary, the news was welcomed as peculiarly propitious ; the destruction of the invaders was regarded as certain ; and the only anxiety entertained was, lest they should effect a retreat before they were punished for their presumption. Notwithstanding the unseasonable period of the year, therefore, orders were sent to collect as large a force as possible to surround and capture the British, and Sykia Wongee (third minister of state) was despatched to assume the chief command. The result of these arrangements was little calculated to inspire the Court with confidence either in its officers or men. On the morning of the 1st July, the Burman force was discovered in motion : the main body drew up upon the left of the British lines in front of the Kemmendine stockades and the Shwe-da-gon pagoda ; but they were screened from observation by the intervening thicket, and their disposition and strength could not be ascertained. Three columns, esti mated at 1000 men each, moved across to the right of the line, where they came in contact with the piquets of the 7th and 22nd regiments of Madras native infantry, which steadily maintained their ground against these superior numbers. The enemy then penetrated between the piquets, and occu pied a hill, whence they commenced an ineffective sire, but were speedily dislodged by three companies of the above regiments with a gun and howitzer, under the personal com mand of Sir Archibald Campbell, who had the satisfaction of seeing them fly in every direction towards their favorite haunt, and only place of safety, the jungle ; leaving at least 100 dead on the field. \" Major Snodgrass seems to have forgotten the part which the navy bore in repulsing this large force ; and that, when, to distract our operations and destroy the shipping, not fewer than fifty-three of their huge fire- rafts, protected by gun-boats, were sent down the river towards the fleet at c"], [28, "18 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, the same time, all of these were, by uncommon skill and ex ertion, towed off and rendered harmless *.\" The activity and zeal of Mr. Lindquist, commanding the row-boats sta tioned at Kemmendine, were very conspicuous on this oc- casion. About the same period, Captain Henry Hardy, of the Teignmouth cruiser, then stationed just within the bar, and employed in examining a creek, to which Captain Marryat had directed his attention, destroyed eleven large country boats, some already loaded, and some loading with stone, for the purpose of blocking up the entrance of the river. The check sustained by the Burmese, on the 1st July, did not alter their plans, and they continued gathering strength in front of the lines and giving constant annoyance. It again, therefore, became necessary to repel them to agreater distance; and on the 8th, a column, about 1500 strong, under Briga- dier-General Macbean, moved upon Kummeroot, a stockaded position about five miles from the Shwe-da-gon pagoda, whilst Sir Archibald Campbell embarked, with 800 men, for the attack of a fortified and commanding point of land, which not only obstructed the navigation of the river above Kem mendine, but afforded an excellent situation for the construc tion of fire-rafts, by the judicious employment of which, the enemy contemplated the destruction of our shipping. The result of these movements was thus reported by Sir A. Campbell, July 11, 1824: \" Having observed a disposition to re-cross part of their force to the Dalla side of the river, I determined, on the 8th instant, to make as gene ral an attack as the very woody and inundated state of the country would possibly admit of. For that purpose, I formed the force to be employed into two columns of attack; one proceeding by land, under the command of that excellent and indefatigable officer Brigadier-General Macbean, for the purpose of surrounding the enemy on the land side; while I, with the other, proceeded by water to attack their stockaded position, along the banks of the river in front. To this post the enemy appeared to attach the great est importance, and the stockades were so constructed as to afford u\u00bbu- * Quarterly Review, xxxv, 516."], [29, "19 DURING THE BURMESE WAR. tual support, presenting difficulties apparently not to be overcome with- out a great sacrifice of lives. I therefore resolved to try the effect of shelling, and consulted with Captain Marryat upon the employment of such armed vessels as he might select to breach, in the event of our mortar practice not succeeding. The shells were thrown at too great distance to produce the desired effect, and the swampy state of the country would not admit of any advance. The armed vessels, viz. the Satellite, Teign- mouth, Thetis, and Jessey, the whole under the command of Lieutenant Fraser, of H. M. S. Larne, now took their stations according to a disposi- tion made by Captain Marryat, and opened afire, which soon silenced that of 14 pieces of artillery, besides swivels and musketry from the stockades, and in one hour the preconcerted signal of ' breach practicable,' was dis played at the main-mast head. The troops, as previously arranged, en- tered their boats on the signal being hoisted. The assault was made in the best order and handsomest style : Major Wahab, with the native in- fantry, landed, and immediately attacked the breach, while Lieutenant- Colonel (Henry) Godwin, almost at the same instant, pushed ashore a little higher up, and entered the work by escalade: the enemy kept up a sharp, but ill-directed fire, while the troops were landing, but, as usual, fled on our making a lodgment in the place. I now ordered Lieutenant- Colonel Godwin to re-embark with the detachment of the 41st regiment, and attack the second stockade, which was immediately carried in the same style. The third stockade was evacuated by the enemy. \" The cool and gallant conduct of all the troops on this occasion was, to me, a most gratifying sight. To the officers and men of the breaching vessels every praise is due ; and I much regret that severe indisposition prevented Captain Marryat from being present to witness the result of his arrangements *. \" The inundated state of the country did not admit of any communica tion with Brigadier-General Macbean from the shipping, nor did I know the result of the operations of his column, until I returned to Rangoon in the evening. Nothing could be more brilliant and successful ! He took, by assault, seven strong stockades in the most rapid succession, throwing the enemy into the utmost consternation ; and be had also the good fortune to fall in with a large body flying from a stockade attacked by the ship ping, of whom a great number were killed.\" Ten stockades were thus taken from the enemy in one day, and upwards of 800 of his best troops were left dead * The Satellite's crew consisted of every effective officer and man belong ing to the Larne, some volunteers from the Moira transport, and a small detachment of infantry and artillery. c 2"], [30, "20 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, on the ground; great numbers afterwards died of their wounds in the jungle ; 38 pieces of artillery, 40 swivels, and 300 muskets were captured ; \u2014 a loss of no small importance where fire-arms were so scarce. Soomba Wongee (second minister of the empire), a Woondock, and two other chiefs of the first class, were found among the slain ; and the sur viving troops, deprived of their leaders, either dispersed, or fled in confusion to the rear, there to await the arrival of the King's favorite brother, the Prince of Sarrawaddy, said to be advancing with 70,000 men. The loss on the part of the British was comparatively very small \u2014 four rank and file killed ; one captain, 35 soldiers, and 1 1 sailors wounded. The subjoined is a copy of an official letter from the com mander-in-chief to Captain Marryat, dated July 9th, 1824 : \" Sir, \u2014 I request you will accept my very best thanks for your able ar rangement and disposition of the vessels employed in the attack of the enemy's stockades yesterday ; and I beg you will also do me the favor of conveying them to Lieutenant Fraser, R. N. Captain Hardy, and the officers in command of the Honorable Company's cruisers Thetis and Jessey. \" I had the greatest satisfaction in observing the general good conduct of the row-boats and the boats of the transports ; they carried the troops up to the assault in very handsome style, and Captain O'Brien, of the Moira, was the first man who leapt on shore, and entered the breach with the foremost of the troops. I am, &c. (Signed) \"A. Campbell.\" On the arrival of Sir Archibald's despatches at Fort William, the secretary to government addressed him thus : \"The Governor-General in Council unites with you in regretting, that the severe indisposition of Captain Marryat, the senior naval officer, pre vented his witnessing the successful result of his judicious arrangements on the occasion alluded to. You will be pleased to assure Captain Mar ryat, that his Lordship in Council entertains the highest sense of his valu able services, and will not fail to bring them under the notice of his Ex cellency Commodore Grant.\" On the 1 1th July, Captain Marryat wrote to the Commo dore as follows : \" I must now call your attention to the condition of H. M. S. Larne, whose crew I am sorry to say have been rendered quite inefficient by"], [31, "21 DURING THE BURMESE WAR. disease. Since we have been on this expedition, we have had 1/0 cases of cholera and dysentery. We have had thirteen deaths \u2014 we have now thirty patients at the hospital on shore, and twenty in the sick list on board ; our convalescents are as ineffective as if they were in their hammocks ; they relapse daily, and the surgeon reports, that, unless the vessel can be sent to cruise for a month, there is little chance of their ultimate recovery. When I sent away the expedition, under Lieutenant Fraser, on the 7th instant, I could only muster three officers and twelve men fit for duty. \" The conduct of Lieutenant Fraser, in the several expeditions which he has commanded, has been that of a gallant and steady officer; and I am under the greatest obligations to Mr. Atherton, not only for his active services in the boats, but for carrying on the whole duty of the ship, dur ing the absence and sickness of the other officers. The behaviour of stir. John Duffill, master's-mate of this ship, and of Messrs. Winsor and Maw, midshipmen, lent from the Sophie and Liffey, has been very satisfactory, and I trust, that when future opportunities may occur, they will so dis tinguish themselves as to have a fair claim for promotion.\" On the 13th July, Captain Marryat dropped the Larne down as far as the Dalla creek, on her way to the mouth of the river, from whence she returned, with the sickness much decreased, on the 27th of the same month. During the absence of that ship, her first lieutenant, William Burdett Dobson, who had long been confined by severe illness, conducted a reconnoi- tring party up the Puzendown creek, where Sir A. Campbell succeeded in releasing a few Burmese families, who were de- sirous of returning to their houses at Rangoon. \" To the influence of their report of the kind treatment they experi- enced,\" the British \" were subsequently indebted for the return of the great body of the people, to whose services and exertions the army was so much indebted in the ensuing cam paign *.\" Being again despatched with a considerable force, after Captain Marryat's return, Lieutenant Dobson captured thirty-five large cargo-boats, deeply laden with rice and salt fish f. On the 4th August, Sir Archibald Campbell proceeded up the Syriam river, with a detachment of 600 men and some Snodgrass, 2d edit. p. 60. t The village of Puzendown, where the Pegu and Rangoon rivers meet, is about a mile below the town of Rangoon."], [32, "22 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, gun-boats, under the command of Brigadier William Smelt and Lieutenant Dobson, for the purpose of dislodging the enemy, who were employed in finishing a large field work, intended to command the river, and protect the surrounding country. Captain Marryat also went up, with two boats from the Larne, to superintend the debarkation, and to ren der every assistance in his power. Upon approaching the landing place, which led to the pagoda of Syriam, they observed the remains of the old Portuguese fort, situated upon a commanding height, at the mouth of the Pegu river, a little above its junction with that of Rangoon, and which had long been concealed from view by trees and overgrown brush-wood, cleared, and scarped where the old wall had fallen down, and from fifteen to twenty feet high. Upon this the enemy had raised a para pet, and suspended huge logs of wood on the outside, in tended to be cut away during the assault, and to carry the assailants before them in their descent. The troops landed under the fire of the Jessey, and of a sloop named the Powerful, fitted as a mortar-vessel, and the advance-party moved on towards the fort until stopped by a deep, uhfordable nullah, the bridge over which had been destroyed, imrposely to check the progress of the invaders. This difficulty, however, was speedily removed, \" and a very tolerable bridge cotistructed by Captain Marryat and his people *,\" exposed to a galling fire, both of great guns and musketry. This service being effected (\"with,\" as Major Snodgrass observes, \" the characteristic coolness and acti vity of British seamen\"), the advance was sounded, and the enemy abandoned the place with the utmost precipitation, leaving behind them eight pieces of good artillery, and a considerable quantity of ammunition. In this affair three of the Larne's crew were wounded : the good conduct of Messrs. Duffill and Winsor was particularly noticed and re ported by Captain Marryat. Sir Archibald Campbell next directed Lieutenant-Colonel Hastings M. Kelly, of the Madras European regiment, to pro- * Official despatch."], [33, "DURING THE BURMESE WAR. 23 ceed with part of the combined force to the Syriam pagoda, which is five miles in the interior, and was then occupied by about 300 men. The Lieutenant-Colonel, on arriving near it, found the enemy inclined to dispute the possession of their almost impregnable post ; but they lost confidence as the British ascended a long flight of steps leading up to the pa goda, and fled in the utmost confusion, leaving behind them four pieces of artillery, and a great quantity of gunpowder. In his report of these affairs, Sir Archibald Campbell ac quainted the Supreme Government, that \"from Captain Marryat and the officers of His Majesty's navy he ever re ceived the most prompt and cordial co-operation.\" The province of Dalla was at this time in a very distracted state, owing to orders having been received for a general levy of every man capable of bearing arms : the order had been most strenuously opposed, and even blood had been shed on the arrival of a person of rank, to enforce obedience to the measures of the Burman government. Sir A. Camp bell thought the opportunity favorable for a little interfer ence, to assist the opposition and escape of the discontented, and, therefore, ordered a detachment of 400 men, under Lieutenant-Colonel Kelly, to embark in boats on the morn ing of the 8th August, and to proceed up the Dalla river, accompanied by Lieutenant Fraser, with directions to act in furtherance of the object alluded to, and to attack any part of the enemy's cordon they might fall in with. The follow ing is a copy of the Lieutenant-Colonel's official report : \" I proceeded with the detachment you were pleased to place under my command, at 1 1 a. m., and after entering a large creek on the east side of Dalla, and proceeding about two miles, I observed two stockades, one on the right, and one on the left bank, immediately opposite to each other, both in commanding situations, particularly that on the left bank, which I in stantly decided on attacking. The boats were hove-to for a short time, to make the necessary preparations for the attack ; and as soon as these were completed, the whole moved on under a heavy fire from the guns and musketry of the enemy in both stockades. The landing was effected under an incessant fire from them, and after great labour and exertion in getting through the mud, which was remarkably stiff, and thigh deep, the scaling ladders were placed, and the stockade stormed and imme-"], [34, "24 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, diately carried. Some of the troops then re-embarked, crossed the river, and took possession of the opposite stockade. \" Our loss, although severe, is not so great as might have been expected from the nature of the ground we had to go over, and the sharp and se vere fire kept up by the enemy until the scaling ladders were placed. The loss on the part of the enemy was but small, in consequence of the vicinity of the jungle, into which they escaped the moment our men entered their works. \" Of the conduct of the troops, I cannot speak in too high praise, al though it will be impossible for me to particularize the officers who so gallantly led their men to tbe assault, as they are too numerous ; many of them assisted in carrying the ladders to the walls. \" I felt myself highly indebted to Lieutenant Fraser, and a party of seamen and marines of H. 31. S. Larne, whose unremitting exertions throughout the affair, greatly contributed towards the success of the day. \" It is with regret I have to report that Mr. Maw, R. N., your acting aide-de-camp, was severely wounded at the early part of the day, whilst he and Captain John Campbell, H. M. 38th regiment, your (second) aide de-camp, who was a volunteer on the occasion, were cheering on some of the seamen who accompanied us *. \" I have further to report, that the enemj', previous to their flight, threw some guns into a wet ditch that surrounded tbe fortifications. We found but two small ones, which were brought away. All the houses in both stockades were destroyed by fire, and a part of the palisade pulled down, before the return of the detachment to camp.\" Finer or more characteristic traits of British soldiers and sailors were never witnessed than on this occasion ; the offi cers, less encumbered than their men, forming line breast deep in mud and water, and passing the scaling ladders from one to another to be planted against the walls of the stock ade. The Bengaleese sailors, however, in the row-boats, badly as they had often behaved before, were now more cowardly than ever ; and a great part of the loss sustained by the assailants was occasioned entirely by their gross mis conduct, a circumstance not adverted to by either Lieutenant- Colonel Kelly or Major Snodgrass. It amounted, altoge ther, to 6 men killed, and 39, including 4 officers, wounded. In an official letter, addressed to Commodore Grant, of * Mr. Maw received a ball in his head, and was obliged to return home for the recovery of his health."], [35, "25 DURING THE BURMESE WAR. whose death he was then uninformed, Captain Marryat says : \"The gallantry of the officers employed in this expedition, viz. Lieutenant Fraser, Mr. Atherton, and Messrs. Duffill, Winsor, and [J. H.] Norcock, deserves the highest encomiums. I am sorry that our list of killed and wounded is so heavy *, but it will be accounted for when I state, that in these attacks the Lascars, who man the other boats, will not pull into the fire unless they are led by the officers and men of H. M. sloop the Larne. The conduct of Mr. Maw, midshipman of the Liffey, has, during the whole period of his service here, been a series of gallantry. I have great plea sure in transmitting a letter from Sir Archibald Campbell, relative to his conduct, and adding my testimony to that of the commander-in-chief.'' \" I regret,'' says Sir Archibald, \" the severe wound received by Mr. Maw. Of this young man's gallantry of conduct and merit I cannot 6peak too highly : he has repeatedly distinguished himself by the most conspicuous and forward bravery.\" At this period, H. M. squadron on the East India station consisted of the following ships and vessels ; \u2014 Tees 26, Cap tain Thomas Coe (senior officer), on her return from New South Wales and Manilla ; Alligator 23, Captain Thomas Alexander, C. B., proceeding to Calcutta, after landing specie at Rangoon ; Slaney 20, Captain Charles Mitchell, lying in the river Hooghly; Arachne 18, Captain Henry Ducie Chads, recently arrived from England, and on her way from Trin comalee to Madras ; Larne 20, Captain Frederick Marryat, at Rangoon ; Sophie 18, Captain George F. Ryves, daily expected there from Bengal ; and the Liffey 50, commanded pro tempore by Lieutenant George Tincombe, still at Pulo- Penang. In the impossibility that existed of engaging in any active operations in the direction of Ava, it was now judged ad visable to employ part of the combined force, at Rangoon, in reducing some of the maritime provinces of the Burman empire. The district of Tenasserim, comprising the divi sions of Tavoy and Mergui, was that selected for attack, as containing a valuable tract of sea coast, as well as being likely to afford supplies of cattle and grain. Accordingly, an ex- \u2022 Four men killed, aud 15, including Messrs. Maw and Norcock, wounded."], [36, "26 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, pedition was despatched against those places, consisting of details of H. M. 89th regiment and the 7* Madras native infantry, the whole of the Honorable Company's cruisers, three gun-vessels, two row-boats, three Malay proas, and six transports, the whole under the command of Lieutenant- Colonel Miles, C. B., assisted by Captain Hardy, of the Telgnmouth. This force sailed from Rangoon on the 20th August, and reached the mouth of the river leading to Tavoy on the 1st September. A conspiracy amongst the garrison facilitated the capture of the place ; the second in command making the governor and his family prisoners, delivered them to the British ; and the town Was occupied without oppo sition. At Mergui, whither the armament next proceeded, and where it arrived on the 6th October, a more effective resist ance was offered : a heavy fire was opened from the batte ries of the town, but returned by the cruisers with such effect, as to silence it in about an hour. The troops then landed, and after wading through miry ground between the river and a strong stockade, which defended the town, being exposed to a brisk fire from the enemy, they advanced to the stockade, and escaladed in the most gallant style. The Burman warriors fled, and the town, when first taken, was deserted by the inhabitants, Who, however, soon returned, and shewed themselves perfectly indifferent to the change of authorities. Leaving part of the Madras troops to garrison Mergui, and some of the flotilla for their protection, Lieutenant- Colonel Miles returned with the remainder of his force to Rangoon, in time to take a part in the more important oper ations about to occur. The capture of Mergui was effected With the loss of only six private soldiers killed, one missing, and two officers and 22 men wounded. On the 2hd September, In compliance with a request from Sir Archibald Campbell, that he would take the necessary steps to dislodge the enemy from the stockades upon the Dalla creek, which they had re-occupied, Captain Marryat proceeded thither for that purpose, accompanied bytwomor-"], [37, "DURING THE BURMESE WAR. 27 tar vessels and a detachment of gun-boats manned by the crew of the Larne. The mortar-vessels and one gun-boat, with two or three howitzers mounted, having been anchored within 600 yards of the stockades, and the other boats having taken up a more advanced position, in a battering line, the whole opened their fire at 6 a. m., which was smartly returned by the enemy, both with guns and musketry. At 9 o'clock, a detachment of row-boats, with troops un der the command of Major Richard Lacy Evans, of the Ma dras army, pulled up the creek. By this time, the enemy's great guns were silenced, and their magazine blown up ; they still, however, held possession of the stockades, and main tained a constant fire of small arms. The ditches of these works had been so widened as not to allow the scaling ladders to be planted, and a strong chevaux de-frise was found placed across the creek to impede the ad vance of the flotilla. The original intention of storming the stockades from the river side was therefore abandoned^ and Major Evans determined to attack the smallest in the rear* At 9-30, he landed with 150 men, forced his way through the jungle by single files, and succeeded in dislodging the ene my. Possession having been gained, the advance was sound ed, and the boats pulled up to the main stockade, which was stormed without loss, the enemy retreating into the jungle. From the precision of the mortar practice, and the excel lent fire of the gun-boats, which had completely riddled the stockades, the enemy's loss must have been considerable t the British had only four men wounded this day, of whom three belonged to the navy. Eight gun carriages were found in the main stockade, and subsequently two very fine brass gilns, which had been sunk in the ditch. Leaving a sufficient force to defend the stockades, Captain Marryat and Major Evans then pushed higher up the creek, Where they discovered between twenty-five and thirty boata and canoes, laden with arms and ammunition, the whole of which were either destroyed or brought away. The zeal and activity of Lieutenant Fraser, Mri Henry Hodder, acting master of the Larne, Mr. Duffill, and Mr."], [38, "28 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, Alexander Cranley (midshipman), who had charge of the gun-boats on this occasion, \" were as highly satisfactory to Captain Marryat \" as creditable to themselves.\" In his official report of this affair, Sir Archibald Campbell says, \u2014 \" I cannot do adequate justice to the sense I entertain of the ability and readiness with which I find myself at all times supported by Captain Marryat and the officers and crew of the ship under his command: nor ought I to omit mentioning, that the officers and crew of the transport ship Moira are volunteers on every occasion when the enemy is likely to be met ivith.\" Major Snodgrass makes a brief allusion to the capture of the stockades, upon the Dalla creek ; but he is again silent respecting the navy. On the 4th September, the Sophie returned to Rangoon, with provisions and a few volunteer seamen. Captain Ryves reported the loss of seven men, who had died of cholera morbus, and that he had been obliged to give his sloop a thorough caulking, in consequence of the severe weather she had encountered when proceeding to Calcutta. About this time, the gig of the Larne found floating the remains of an English sailor, whom the Burmese had first tortured to death, and then sawed in halves. The captured stockades now became the site of con stant warfare, the Burmese proving peculiarly tenacious of any passage being opened up the creek leading to Thon tai, (the capital of Dalla, and the retreat of the Rangoon people). The gun-vessels, row-boats, and soldiers left in defence of these works, were each succeeding night assailed with musketry from the surrounding jungle, and the officers and men of the navy were constantly in their boats, watch ing, grappling, and towing away fire-rafts. On the 5th September, at midnight, a straggling fire was again heard in the direction of the Dalla stockade, and shortly afterwards a rocket was thrown up, the signal pre viously arranged with the detachment, in case of immediate assistance being required. With the advantage of a strong flood tide, the boats of the Larne proceeded rapidly to the"], [39, "29 DURING THE BURMESE WAR. point of contention, where a heavy fire was exchanged ; and as their approach could not be perceived, in consequence of the smoke, the officers and men cheered, to announce that support was at hand, and had the satisfaction to hear it warmly returned, both by the military and those afloat. The attacks of the enemy had been simultaneous ; the gun-vessels in the creek having been assailed by a number of war-boats, while the troops on shore were opposed to a force estimated at from 1500 to 2000 men. Upon Captain Marryat's arrival, he found the enemy's troops had not retreated, but still kept up a galling fire. The war-boats, which had endeavoured to board the Kitty gun-brig, had been beat off by the exertions and gallantry of Mr. Robert Crawfurd, commanding that vessel, and were apparently rallying at a short distance up the creek, with a determination to renew the attack ; but on perceiving the Larne's boats advancing a-head of the gun-vessels, they made a precipitate retreat. Chase was immediately given, and five of them, which had been most severely handled, and could not keep up with the main body, were successively boarded and carried. The spears remaining in the sides of the Kitty, the lad ders attached to her rigging, and the boarding netting cut through in many places, proved the severe conflict which had been sustained, and induced Captain Marryat to recom mend the very meritorious conduct of Mr. Crawfurd to the favorable consideration of the Governor -General in Council. From the number of dead found in the captured boats, and the crippled state of many others, the loss of the enemy in this water attack, cannot be estimated at less than 250 men. The Kitty had only two sepoys (doing duty as ma rines) killed, and her commander and four men wounded. The active and zealous support which he received from Lieutenant Fraser and Mr. Duffill was again publicly ac knowledged by Captain Marryat; who also gave great praise to Messrs. King and Frames, commanding the Narcissa and Tiger gun-vessels, for the well-directed and destructive fire which they poured into the enemy's war-boats."], [40, "30 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, Two days after this first rencontre with the enemy's flo tilla (of which Major Snodgrass makes no mention what ever), the commander-in-chief issued a general order, of which the following is an extract : \" Sir Archibald Campbell will take an early opportunity of communi cating to Captain Marryat, R. N. how gratified he was by his prompt support at the point assailed, and the gallant pursuit of the flying enemy by himself and his brave followers; and which he will not fail to request Captain Marryat to communicate to the officers and men of H. M. uavy, and also those of the transport service, who so handsomely came forward on this, as they have done on many former occasions.\" On the 9th September, Lieutenant Fraser was sent to search for the passage up to Thon-tai, by way of the Dalla creek; but, after an absence of three days, he returned without being able to find it. While on this service, Mr. Lindquist, commanding a detachment of row-boats, and one man, were wounded, by musketry from the shore. The scurvy was now making a rapid progress among the crew of the Larne, in consequence of their having been for some months confined to a diet of salt and damaged pro visions, added to a total privation of vegetables, and the usual effects of a long continued wet season. Supposing that a period of at least six weeks would elapse before active operations could be re-commenced, Captain Marryat was thereby induced to submit to Sir Archibald Campbell the propriety of proceeding with his ship to Penang, leaving the Sophie and Satellite to protect the transports, &c. at Rangoon.. On the 10th September, he received the follow ing answer : \" Under these circumstances, I most fully coincide with you in opinion, that no time should be lost in proceeding to Penang, where those comforts essentially necessary for the recovery of your crew are at present most conveniently to be had ; aware as I am, that the most urgent necessity alone induces you to suggest the removal of the ship under your command. I feel fully convinced that you will not lose a moment in returning to partake of the farther, and I trust rpore active, operations of the ap proaching campaign. \" In taking I hope a very short leave of yourself, and the officers and men of the Larne, I shall not dwell, as I otherwise would, on the valuable and ready aid I have invariably received from you all, since the commence-"], [41, "DURING THE BURMESE WAR. 31 raent of the present service, embracing duties of perhaps as severe and harassing a nature as ever were experienced by either sailors or soldiers, and under privations of the most trying nature. Any number of Malay sailors you may require, to assist in navigating the Larne to Penang, are at your service. (Signed) \"A. Campbell.\" At the request of Sir Archibald, Captain Marryat left Lieutenant Dobson, with sixteen of the Lame's crew, and nine supernumerary seamen belonging to the Alligator, in charge of the armed transport Satellite, stationed at Pagoda Point, where he had been for several weeks, \"performing the anxious and important duties imposed upon him, in every respect as a valuable officer *.\" On the 11th September, the Arachne was reported off the bar. Captain Marryat, with only 27 of his original ship's company, including officers, on board, was then dropping down from Rangoon ; but he deferred quitting the river for two days, in order to give Captain Chads every information in his power. At this period, the European portion of the army fit for active service in the field was reduced to less than 1500 men. Seven hundred and forty-nine British sol diers had fallen victims to the climate, and upwards of 1000 were in the hospitals. Nearly one-fourth of the Sophie's crew had died, and as many more were sick. We must here remark, that the command held by Captain Marryat, under such peculiar circumstances, from May 31st to Sept. 11th, 1824, was so important, that, had it been in time of extended war, it would, in all probability, have been delegated to a flag-officer ; that, during a period so novel and trying to a young commander, he never once incurred censure ; and that he did not give over the charge to Cap tain Ryves until the enemy had been so decidedly repulsed that Sir Archibald Campbell officially stated to him his con viction that the Sophie and Satellite were sufficient protec tion for the shipping. His various official reports were transmitted to the Admiralty, with the following letter from \u2022 In order to give protection to boats passing up and down the Rangoon river, gun-vessels, with ten sepoys in each, were anchored off all the creeks, from the bar to Pagoda Point."], [42, "32 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, Captain Coe, by whom he was promoted into the Tees on that officer assuming the command of the Liffey. \" I have the honor to enclose sundry despatches from Captain Marryat, of H. M. S. Larne, in command of the naval force in the river Rangoon, detailing various successful attacks on the enemy, while cooperating with the army under Sir Archibald Campbell ; and I feel much pleasure in re commending to their Lordships' notice that officer, as well as those named in the margin *, to whose zealous exertions and cool intrepidity are to be attributed the successful results of the various attacks which they con ducted against the enemy. I am pleased in having it in roy power to recommend in the strongest terms, Mr. Henry Lister Maw, midshipman of this ship, who volunteered his services to Sir Archibald Campbell, and who accompanied him in all his operations ; and I trust, from the high encomiums passed on his conduct, their Lordships will be pleased to con sider his services, and his having been most dangerously wounded.\" The Larne did not return to Rangoon until the 24 th De cember, 1824. CII AFTER II. On the arrival of the Arachne at Madras, July 29, 1824, Captain Chads found that Commodore Grant had given di rections to his agents there, to detain all despatches for him which might arrive after the 15th of that month, and intimated his intention to leave Penang on the 1st of August. Under these circumstances, the commander of the Arachne con sidered, that the surest way to join his commodore was to remain stationary; but at the same time he offered the ser- * Lieutenants William Burdett Dobson and Thomas Fraser, actino- Lieutenant George Goldfinch, Mr. Robert Atherton, and Messrs. John Duffill, George Winsor, and Charles Kittoe Scott."], [43, "DURING THE BURMESE WAR. 33 vices of his sloop, should the Madras government deem them necessary for prosecuting the war in Ava. On the 28th August, he received the first intimation of the death of Commodore Grant ; and on the 3d September, having em barked on board the Arachne four lacs of rupees, for the use of the invading army, he took his departure for Rangoon, at the especial request of the Governor-in- Council of Fort St. George. On the 15th Sept. he assumed the chief command of the combined naval force attached to Sir Archibald Camp bell's army. We must here remark, that the Arachne was sent from England to relieve the Sophie ; but in consequence of a re quest from the Supreme Government, contained in a letter signed by Mr. Swinton, and dated Oct. 8, 1824, and seeing the absolute necessity of detaining that sloop, to co-operate in carrying on the war, Captain Chads took upon himself the responsibility of ordering her to remain. On the 19th Sept., Sir Archibald Campbell directed a movement to be made upon Panlang, where the enemy had established a post, and were busily employed in constructing combustible rafts and boats for the destruction of our ship ping. The force employed consisted of about 500 troops, under the command of Brigadier-General Hugh Fraser; the Satellite, manned with 45 British sailors and 20 soldiers ; the Diana, steam vessel ; all the boats of the Arachne and Sophie, and several belonging to the transports, but manned by the former sloop and the Moira ; nine gun-vessels, and sixteen row-boats. On the 21st, the troops were embarked, and Captain Chads moved upwards -with the flotilla, which was in three divi sions, under the command of Lieutenant Charles Keele, first of the Arachne; Lieutenant John Bazely, first of the Sophie ; and Mr. Stephen Joshua Lett, master's-mate of the former sloop. In the evening, heavy guns were heard, not far distant; and next morning, five stockades were seen, three on the right side and two on the left : the Satellite, towed by the Diana, was far a-head of the flotilla, and soon ran up with the ene- D"], [44, "34 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, my's works, receiving, as she advanced, a heavy raking fire of great guns, jingals, and musketry ; which was not returned, however, till the vessel was placed directly in the centre, when both broadsides were opened on them, and Captain Chads had soon the satisfaction of seeing the enemy fly in all directions. Some troops under Major Sale were imme diately landed, with trifling opposition, and the whole of the stockades destroyed. About fifteen guns of various sizes were taken, and the same number of one-pounder swivels. The enemy are supposed to have been about 2000 strong ; but they took especial care not to allow our troops to close with them. The expedition now proceeded about twenty miles higher up the river, and, on the 24th, fell in with three more stock ades, which were bombarded for a short time previous to the landing of the troops, who found them all evacuated. About twenty-five war boats, rowing 30 and 40 oars each, were also discovered ; but, owing to their superior speed, it was found impossible to overtake them. On the 25th, the flotilla again advanced, till the river nar rowed to eighty yards, when Captain Chads sent Lieutenant Keele about four miles further up, who reported that it was there very deep, but only sixty yards across. The expedi tion returned to Rangoon on the 27th, when Brigadier-Ge neral Fraser addressed a letter to Sir Archibald Campbell, of which the following are extracts : \" I am happy to add, that no casualties occurred amongst the troops during these operations, but I understand 2 or 3 sailors were wounded. \" The ordnance was taken possession of by the naval commander, with the exception of one gun burst, and another sunk in the river. \" My best thanks are due to Captain Chads, of H. M. S. Arachne, for the cordial co-operation I received from him during the whole operations ; and I cannot omit to notice the zeal and alacrity with which Lieutenant Keele and Mr. Lett, H. M. S. Arachne, and Lieutenant Bazely and Mr. Winsor, H. M. S. Sophie, performed the different duties assigned to them by Captain Chads.\" We shall here give an extract of a general order issued by Sir Archibald Campbell, on the 27th Sept. \" The commander of the forces begs Brigadier-General Fraser and Cap-"], [45, "DURING THE BURMESE WAR. 35 tain Chads, R. N. will accept his best thanks for their perseverance in the fatiguing and harassing service in which they have been engaged, and it is with great pleasure he has received a report of the unanimity and good feeling with which the best exertions of the officers and men of both ser- vices were brought forward upon this, as on all other occasions where they have been employed together, and which it has so often been his pride lo report to the highest authorities. (Signed) \" F. S. Tidy, Lieut. Col., D. A. G.\" Major Snodgrass contents himself with saying, that \"the stockades upon the Dalla river, and those upon the Panlang branch, or principal passage into the Irrawaddy, were attacked and carried with few casualties on our part, while the ene my in both instances suffered severely, with the additional loss of many pieces of artillery.\" In an official letter to Cap tain Coe, dated Sept. 28th, Captain Chads expresses him self as follows : \u2014 \" A chart drawn by Mr. Winsor, Admiralty midshipman of the Sophie, to whom I feel much indebted for his exertion and ability, he having had the arduous charge of the steam-vessel during the whole of the time, will enable you to judge of our progress ; the Satellite was on shore three times, and the Diana once, but without the slightest injury. It now be comes a most pleasing duty for me to express the high satisfaction I feel at the conduct of the officers aud seamen I had the pleasure to command; their privations and harassing duties were extreme, under heavy rains, guards by night from fire-rafts, with the enemy's war-boats constantly watching close to them, and incessant towing of the flotilla by day; their high spirits were unabated ; and without the utmost zeal aud fatigue in the officers commanding the divisions, it would have been impossible to have advanced, manned as they * are, with natives only. Lieutenant Dobson rendered me every assistance, and was of great service ; he was severely burnt on the 22d. From the exemplary conduct of these officers and sea men, allow me, Sir, to recommend them to your favorable attention. The casualties, I rejoice to say, have been very few \u2014 four seamen of the Arachne wounded.\" li The rains continued during the whole month of Sep tember, and sickness had arrived at an alarming height. An epidemic fever, which prevailed all over India, made its ap pearance among the troops, which, although in few instances of a fatal tendency, left all those whom it attacked in a de- * The gun-vessels and row-boats, D 2"], [46, "36 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, plorable state of weakness and debility, accompanied by cramps and pains in the limbs : men discharged from the hospitals were long in regaining their strength ; and their too frequent indulgence in pine-apples, limes, and other fruit with which the woods about Rangoon abound, brought on dysentery, which, in their exhausted state, generally termi nated in death.\" The situation of the combined force at this time \" was, indeed, truly melancholy ; even those who still continued to do their duty, emaciated and reduced, could with difficulty crawl about. The hospitals crowded, and with all the care and attention of a numerous and experienced medical staff, the sick for many months continued to increase, until scarcely 3000 duty- soldiers were left to guard the lines. Floating hospitals were established at the mouth of the river ; bread was furnished in sufficient quantities, but nothing except change of season, or of climate, seemed likely to re store the sufferers to health. \" Mergui and Tavoy, now in our possession, and repre sented by the professional men who visited them as possess ing every requisite advantage, were accordingly fixed on as convalescent stations. To these places numbers were sub sequently sent, and the result fully justified the most sanguine expectations that were formed. Men who had for months remained in a most debilitated state at Rangoon, rapidly re covered on arriving at Mergui, and were soon restored in full health and vigour to their duty*.\" On the 5th October, a detachment of Madras native in fantry and some pioneers, with a few camel howitzers, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Francis Smith, C. B., was sent to attack the enemy's stockaded position in the neighbourhood of Annauben and the pagoda of Keykloo, fourteen miles from Rangoon ; and at the same time another military detachment, under Major Thomas Evans, was em barked in the flotilla, and directed to make a simultaneous movement upon Than-ta-bain, about 30 miles distant from * Snodgrass, 7'J,"], [47, "DURING THE BURMESE WAR. 37 Rangoon, which latter service occupied six days in its suc cessful performance. The result was the destruction of five stockades, seven or eight war-boats, and large preparations for sire-vessels and rafts. \" The naval part of the expedi tion,\" says Sir Archibald Campbell, \" was prepared and led by that zealous and excellent officer Captain Chads, of H. M. S. Arachne, the senior naval officer on the station. How well my orders have been executed, the accompanying detail of operations will shew.\" ENCLOSURE. \" Camp, Rangoon, 1 Uh Oct. 1S24. ** Sir, \u2014 In obedience to orders I had the honor of receiving from you, to feel the strength and disposition of the enemy upon the Lyne river, and to attack him as often as opportunities might offer of displaying the valour of the troops under my command, I embarked, on the morning of the 5th inst., with 300 men of H. M. 38th regiment, 100 rank and file of the 18th Madras native infantry, and a detachment of Bengal artillery, under Captain Timbrell, on board a flotilla of gun-boats, &c. &c. under the immediate command of Captain Chads. The first day's tide carried us as high as Pagoda Point, above K^mmendine, at the junction of the Lyne and Panlang rivers. Having been joined by the armed transport and flotilla, at 2 p. m. next day, the whole force proceeded up the Lyne river with a flowing tide. Bodies of the enemy were seen moving up on the right bank, while numerous war-boats hovered in our front, keeping up a continued but distant fire. After the flotilla anchored, the light boats in advance, under Lieutenant Kellett, of H. M. S. Arachne, pursued the enemy's war-boats ; and having closed with one carrying a gun and full complement of men, boarded and took her in the handsomest style, the Burmese jumping overboard to save themselves. On the 7th, after pro- ceeding about four miles, I observed two stockades, which were taken pos- session of without loss, and we reached, with this tide, within a short distance of the large works and fortified village of Than-ta-bain, having in the course of the day destroyed seven of the newly constructed war- boats. On reconnoitring the village, 1 found it was defended by three long breast-works, with a very extensive stockade, constructed of large teak-beams ; and fourteen war-boats, each mounting a gun, were anchored so as to defend the approach to it. \" Having consulted Captain Chads, we advanced to the assault, the steam-boat, with the Satellite and bomb ketch in tow *, and the troops in their boats ready to land when ordered. In passing the breast-works, we * One of the gun- vessels fitted with a mortar."], [48, "38 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, eceived a smart running fire from jingals and musketry, which was re- turned with showers of grape from the Satellite ; and observing the enemy evidently in confusion, I directed the troops and scaling ladders to be im mediately landed, and in a few minutes every work about the place was in our possession. During this night, some fire-rafts, of a most formidable appearance, were floated down the river; but very fortunately they passed without touching any of the vessels. \"At 6 o'clock next morning, we again moved with the tide, and in passing a narrow neck of land at the junction of two rivers, were received with a brisk discharge of musketry from a long line of breast-works, and a cannonade from a very large stockade on our right. The fire of the latter was soon silenced by the well-pointed guns of the Satellite. \" The troops and pioneers vvere ordered then to land, and this formida- ble stockade was carried by assault without a struggle. It is, without exception, the strongest work of the kind I have ever seen \u2014 the length of the front and rear faces is 200 yards, and that of the side faces 150. It is built of solid timber, fifteen feet high, with a platform inside all round, five feet broad and eight feet from the ground \u2014 upon this platform were a number of wooden guns, and piles of single and double-headed wooden shot, and many jingals ; below, we found seven pieces of brass and iron ordnance. In front, the stockade is strengthened by breast-works and regular demilunes, and would contain with ease above 2,000 men. In the centre of this strong hold, we found the magnificent bungalow of the Kee Wongee, who, I presume, fled early in the day. I cannot doubt but the enemy's loss must have been severe, though we only found seventeen dead bodies, which they had not time to carry off. \" The advanced boats having pushed up the river some miles, without seeing any other works, I considered the objects you had in view fully ac complished, and we accordingly began to move back to Rangoon. * * \u2022*\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022/ cannot adequately acknowledge my obligations to Captain Chads, for his zealous, judicious, and cordial co-operation ; and the spirited conduct of Lieutenant Kellett, in command of the advanced boats, attracted the notice of every one. *\u2022\u00ab\u2022\u2022\u00bb] neefj SCarcely add, that every officer and man evinced, on all occasions, that cheerful readiness and determined valour you have so often witnessed. * * * * Much powder, and an immense quantity of petroleum oil, and warlike stores, were destroyed at the different stockades.\" (Signed) \" T.

James Ward Tomlinson, (son of Captain, now Rear-Ad miral Nicholas Tomlinson), Archibald Reed, George Winsor,"], [49, "39 DURING THE BURMESE WAR. Charles Michell, and Murray, Admiralty midshipmen. The following is an extract of a letter from Captain Chads to Captain Coe, dated October 11th: \" Every thing which I had in view having been most fully accomplished, and our provisions wholly expended, it was necessary to return, and we reached this place yesterday afternoon, having been six days away, during which time hardly a man had an hour's rest, whereas the whole were subject to the most harassing duty, with extreme heat and heavy rain; but the same good spirit I had the pleasure on the former occasion to recommend to your favourable attention, still animated the seamen and marines under my com mand : and I beg particularly to bring to your notice Lieutenant Kellett, who was in command of the light division, with Lieutenant Goldfinch and the other officers, before named. On all occasions they were foremost\u00bb and led the gun-boats with the troops up to every stockade. From Lieu tenant Dobson I received great assistance on board the Satellite ; Mr. Winsor, of the Sophie, had again charge of the steam-vessel, and conducted her with the same judgment I before noticed to you ; he will now add to the chart I then sent you, made by him, the extent of our last expedition.\" On the 16th October, Sir Archibald Campbell, in general orders, expressed \" his satisfaction at the series of uninter rupted success which had marked the progress of the com bined forces under Major Evans and Captain Chads,\" to whom he gave \" his best thanks for their persevering exer tions, which cost the enemy eleven pieces of cannon and twenty wall -pieces, as well as all the means of annoyance which he had long been collecting.\" The Governor- General also expressed * his high approbation and applause of the brilliant and decisive attack\" on Than-ta-bain. \" You will be pleased,\" says Mr. Swinton, in a letter to Sir Archibald Campbell, \" to convey to Major Evans and Captain Chads the sense which the Governor-General in Council entertains of the gallant service performed by them and the officers and men under their command, which has not been surpassed by any of the most distinguished affairs with the enemy since our first occupation of Rangoon.\" During the above successful operations against Than-ta bain, (of which no notice is taken by Major Snodgrass) the military detachment under Lieutenant-Colonel Smith carried a stockade at Tadaghee, and a succession of breast-works in"], [50, "40 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, the vicinity of Keykloo ; but was repulsed in an attempt to escalade the entrenchments surrounding the pagoda, and obliged to retreat with the loss of 21 officers and men killed, and 74 wounded. The bodies of 28 sepoys and pioneers were afterwards discovered by Brigadier M'Creagh, \" fastened to the trunks of trees on the road side, mangled and muti lated in every manner that savage cruelty could devise.\" Sir Archibald Campbell now determined to reduce and oc cupy the city of Martaban, situated at the bottom of the gulf of that name, and about 100 miles to the eastward of Ran goon. The naval part of this expedition was commanded by Lieutenant Charles Keele, whose force consisted of six gun vessels, one mortar-boat, seven gun-boats, thirty men from the Arachne and Sophie, and an armed transport, having on board 450 troops, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Godwin. On the 27th October, the above armament entered Martaban river, and the flotilla, led on in most gallant style by the Arachne's jolly-boat, under the command of Mr. George Bourchier Dewes, a youngster only fourteen years of age, succeeded in destroying about thirty of the enemy's war-boats, two of them pulling 50 oars each, and the whole armed with muskets, spears, and swivels. \" This service,\" says Captain Chads, \" was performed in a manner to reflect great credit on Lieutenant Keele, and Lieutenant-Colonel Godwin men tions in high terms his gallantry and zeal.\" On the 29th, when closing the town, the transport grounded too far off to make use of her carronades with good effect. The enemy then opened their fire from a stockade, which was returned by all the row-boats, forming a line close alongshore, until after sunset ; the mortar-vessel likewise took her position, under Captain Thomas Ynyr B. Kennan, of the Madras artillery, and kept up a well-directed fire the whole night, killing, from report, great numbers of the enemy. The appearance of Martaban is thus described by Lieutenant- Colonel Godwin : \" The place rests at the bottom of a very high hill, washed by a beau tiful and extensive sheet of water ; on its right a rocky mound, on which"], [51, "DURING THE BURMESE WAR. 41 was placed a two-gun battery, with a deep nullah under it. This battery communicates with the usual stockade of timber, aud behind this a work of masonry, varying from twelve to twenty feet thick, with small embra sures for either cannon or musketry. The stockade runs along the margin of the water for more than three-quarters of a mile, where it joins a large pagoda, which projects into the water iD the form of a bastion. The de fences then continue a short distance, and end at a nullah, on the other side of which all is thick jungle. The town continues to run in an angle way from the pagoda for at least a mile, and terminates in the house of the Mayoon, close to a stockade up the hill. The whole defence is the water line, with its flanks protected. The rear of the town and work is com posed of thick jungle and large trees, and open to the summit.\" Lieutenant-Colonel Godwin was prepared for a determined resistance on the part of the enemy, by seeing a number of armed men crossing, as he went up the river to reconnoitre. \" At 5 o'clock in the morning of the 30th,\" says he, \" the men composing the first division were in their boats \u2014 98 of H. M. 41st regiment, 75 of the 3rd native light infantry, 8 of the Bengal artillery, and 38 seamen of the royal navy ; and I was fully aware that these men would have the business to themselves, as I had no where to wait for the remainder of the force, and every boat was already occupied. The ad vance sounded a little after five, and the boats rowed off, and soon came under a very heavy fire of all arms. On approach ing the shore, I perceived there had been a misunderstanding with respect to the spot at which I wished to land, and that we had got on the wrong side of the nullah. As we could not carry the ladders through the mud, I ordered the boats to push off and put in at the place I appointed ; at this time, a heavy fire of artillery and musketry was on us, and the Las cars would not face it *. Lieutenant Keele, of the Arachne, commanding the naval force with me, pushed on shore, and gallantly went to see if the nullah could be passed : he came back almost directly, and informed me there was a boat in the nullah, over which the men could go, and that the side * At Than-ta-bain their conduct was equally bad. Although cheered on by the European troops in their vessels and boats, not one of them could be got to assist in rendering the fire-rafts harmless."], [52, "42 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, of the rock to the battery appeared practicable. Trusting to the gallantry of the people with me, I determined to try it; and from the men getting on shore, there was not a halt till we had possession of it. It was stormed under a heavy fire of musketry ; the enemy did not leave the fort till we were within a few paces of them, and they even threw stones at us, when we were too much under the fort for their fire to reach us. It is due to Captain Borrowes, of H. M. 4lst regiment, and Lieutenant Keele, R. JV., to say they were in first. I now felt secure of the place, and after waiting till the men had recovered from the exertion, and to get them together, they marched down along the works, and cleared all before them. On marching through the town it was, as usual, deserted, except by a great many women. The empti- ness of the houses shewed every preparation had been made, if the place was captured, to prevent our getting any pro- perty. I enclose a return of the guns taken, as also the ordnance stores ; the quantities of the latter immense, kept in a stockade about half a mile up the hill, and a regular manufactory to make the powder. Our loss has been com- paratively small \u2014 seven killed and fourteen wounded. In this immense place, with so many facilities to escape, I cannot guess what the enemy's loss may have been ; but from the prisoners, of whom we have a great many, and other sources, it must have been great ; as allowing that two-thirds of the number reported were within this place at the attack, there must have been between three and four thousand.\" The ordnance and stores captured at Martaban consisted of 16 guns of various calibre, 100 wall-pieces, 500 muskets, 7,000 round shot, 1 ,500 grape, 100,000 musket-balls, 9,000 Ibs. of lead, 20,000 flints, 10,000 musket-cartridges, 6,000 ditto for wall-pieces, 26,500 Ibs. of loose gunpowder, 10,000 Ibs. of saltpetre, and 5,000 Ibs. of sulphur. The Hon. Com pany's gun-vessel Phaeton was found at this place, with her crew in irons. Her commander had put into Martaban by mistake, and was then a prisoner at Ava. The loss sustained by the naval detachment was two men killed, one dangerously wounded, and three severely. In con-"], [53, "DURING THE BURMESE WAR. 43 eluding his report to Sir A.

Godwin, Lieut.-Col. 41st Regt.\" Lieutenant Keele officially reported to Captain Chads, that \" Lieutenant Bazely rendered him every assistance ;\" and he also spoke \" in high praise of the constant good conduct of Mr. Lett.\" Sir Archibald Campbell describes the capture of Martaban as \" an achievement no less honorable than beneficial to the British arms, reflecting the highest credit on every indivi dual composing the force employed.\" On the 26th Nov., Mr. Secretary Swinton wrote to Sir Archibald as follows : \" The Governor-General in Council commands me to express his fullest concurrence in the tribute of applause which you have bestowed on Lieu tenant-Colonel Godwin, and the officers and men under his command, and on Lieutenant Keele and the seamen of the royal navy, composing the expedition fitted out against Martaban. \" The ability and judgment with which Lieutenant-Colonel Godwin planned the attack, and the gallantry with which the place was carried by the small force of 220 men, against the numerous and well-armed troops of the enemy, reflects the highest credit on the professional character of the officers in command, and the cool and resolute intrepidity of the handful of men by whom so important and brilliant an exploit has been achieved."], [54, "44 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, \" His Lordship in Council accordingly desires, that you will be pleased to express to Lieutenant-Colonel Godwin the very high sense which Go vernment entertain of his conduct on this occasion. You will also be pleased to convey to Lieutenants Keele and Bazely, of H. M. sloops Arachne and Sophie, the acknowledgments of the Governor-General in Council for the eealous and gallant exertions of themselves and the British seamen under their command.\" The capture of Martaban, \" long considered as a place of some note, both in a political and commercial point of view, as the capital and mart of an extensive province, but more especially as a frontier fortress and depot of military stores, where the Burmese armies were usually assembled in their frequent wars with the Siamese,\" is thus briefly re lated by Major Snodgrass : \" Owing to light and contrary winds, the expedition did not reach its destination so soon as was expected; and instead of taking the enemy by surprise, they found him fully aware of their approach, and that every preparation had been made for their reception. The governor, Maha Oudinah, a bold and resolute chief, had fortified with skill and labour every commanding eminence about the town, and its distance from the coast, nearly 20 miles, offered many serious obstacles to the approach of our troops. By land, difficult forests, marshes, and extensive plains of rice grounds, still covered with the inundations of the monsoon, prevented a movement from the coast in that way; while the intricate navigation of a shallow, winding river, presented many impediments to an approach by water. The latter course, however, was at once resolved on, and by toil and perseverance, the vessels were finally anchored nearly abreast of the town ; and the governor evincing no disposition to come to terms, au assault took place, when the enemy was driven with severe loss from every part of his defences.\" The destruction of the war-boats, and Lieutenant Keele's subsequent services, have not been considered worthy the Major's notice. After arranging matters at Martaban, Lieutenant-Colonel Godwin despatched a party against Yeh, situated to the eastward, which fell without resistance. By the capture of these places, the previous reduction of Mergui and Tavoy, and the voluntary submission of the whole coast of Tenas serim, the British obtained possession of very large stores of grain, ammunition, and ordnance, together with numerous boats fit for the conveyance of troops, and the command of"], [55, "45 DURING THE BURMESE WAR. all the Burman sea-coast from Rangoon to the eastward, a district ultimately ceded by treaty. In October, the sickness and number of deaths at Ran goon were greater than in any previous month. In the beginning of November, however, a sensible change in the health of the troops was apparent. At this latter period, four of the Arachne's crew had already fallen victims to the climate, and forty-four were reported unfit for service ; her total complement was only 100 officers, men, and boys. On the 7th Nov., Lieutenant Greer, of the Bombay marine, then commanding the Thetis cruiser, being on his way from Elephant Point to Rangoon, in a row-gun-boat, with six sepoys as a guard, Succeeded in beating off two war-boats, carrying from 30 to 40 men each, which had come out from the intermediate creeks, with twelve other boats of the same description, purposely to intercept him. The bold and de termined conduct of Mr. Greer was duly appreciated by Sir Archibald Campbell and Captain Chads, who were weU aware, that the capture of even a single boat would have been a source of the highest exultation to the Burmese, and emboldened them to give further annoyance on the river. Unfortunately, the seeds of jealousy, respecting the com. mand of the Honorable Company's naval force in Ava, had previously been sown at Calcutta ; and Mr. Greer's gallant exploit was followed by a painful correspondence, in the course of which, however, Captain Chads most firmly and successfully supported the dignity of His Majesty's service. On the 29th November, Captain Chads, in company with Lieutenant-Colonel John W. Mallet, of H. M. 89th regi ment, visited the ancient capital of Pegu, which was found in melancholy ruins, reduced to a mere village, and deserted by all except a few old men and women. During this recon noissance, which occupied four days, several large fire-rafts were destroyed by a division of light boats, under Lieutenant Kellett. On his return to Rangoon, Lieutenant-Colonel Mallet called the attention of Sir Archibald Campbell \" to the zeal and ability shewn by Captain Chads, in conducting"], [56, "46 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, the flotilla up the river, and the valuable service he at all times received from him.\" During the whole of November, the troops at Rangoon en joyed a state of comparative repose ; and this interval, toge ther with the gradual approach of a more healthy season, and improved supplies, contributed materially to diminish the number of sick, and to preserve the health of those who had hitherto escaped. The army was therefore gathering vigour, for the renewal of active operations. Nor were the Burmese idle. The successive capture of their strongest stockades, the defeat of their most celebrated chieftains, the capture of their maritime provinces, and the prolonged occu pation of Rangoon, had produced no pacific disposition on the part of the King of Ava ; he, on the contrary, had turned his eyes to Maha Bandoola, a most distinguished warrior and statesman, who had previously been ordered to sack Calcutta, and lead the Governor-General in golden fetters to Umera poora, at that time the capital of the empire. Maha Bandoola was recalled from Arracan to the Irrawaddy, with instruc tions to concentrate his veteran legions at Donoobew. No pains nor expence were spared to equip this favourite general for the field ; and by the approach of the season for active operations, at least 50,000 men, well-armed, with a nume rous artillery, and a body of Cassay horse, were ready to ad vance upon Rangoon. On the 30th November, the enemy's war-boats, &c. were seen by the Teignmouth (then stationed at the advanced post above Kemmendine), coming down in great numbers, loaded with men. The same evening they came forward with fire rafts, which induced Captain Goodridge (who had succeeded Captain Hardy in the command of that cruiser) to slip and go below the point, to avoid them. This unfortunately left the post exposed to a most furious attack both by land and water; but it was nobly defended by the garrison under Major Charles W. Yates, consisting of the 26th Madras native in fantry and a mere handful of Europeans, supported on the river by a small naval force."], [57, "DURING THE BURMESE WAR. 47 On the 1 st December, at day-light, numerous and appa rently formidable masses of the advancing enemy were dis covered issuing from the jungle, and moving at some distance upon both flanks of the British army, for the purpose of sur rounding it, which Sir Archibald Campbell allowed them to effect without interruption, leaving his own troops only the narrow channel of the Rangoon river unoccupied in the rear. Observing the right corps of Bandoola' s force cross to the Dalla side, and one division occupy the almost inaccessible ground on the bank of the river, from which a distant fire was soon opened upon the shipping, Captain Ryves (his senior officer not having yet returned from Pegu,) immedi ately procured from the commander-in-chief a guard of 100 sepoys for the transports ; then placed the Arachne in her usual situation, about one mile and a half in advance of the fleet, to enfilade the Madras lines, and ordered Captain Goodridge back to support the post at Kemmendine. In the afternoon, a detachment under Major Sale, consist ing of H. M. 13th regiment, and the ISth Madras native in fantry, broke through the entrenchments which the enemy, with their usual dexterity, had already thrown up; and after killing a number of men, and destroying their works, returned loaded with military spoil. In the evening of the same day, two companies of the 38th, under Captain Hugh Piper, drove back a considerable force, which was approaching inconve niently near to the N. E. angle of the Shwe-da-gon pagoda ; and, on the following morning, a party was dislodged from a commanding situation in front of the north gate of that stately edifice, by Captain Christopher Wilson, with two companies of the 38th, and a detachment of native infantry. During the night of the 1st December, the Teignmouth was again driven from her station by fire-rafts, and the post at Kem mendine thereby subjected to furious and incessant attacks. In his account of the operations of December 1st, Major Snodgrass at length acknowledges the value of naval co-ope ration, which his excellent commander-in-chief had long before fully discovered and appreciated. At page 99 of his narrative, the Major says, \" the day had scarcely dawned"], [58, "48 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, when hostilities commenced with a heavy fire of musketry and cannon at Kemmendine, the reduction of that place being a preliminary to any general attack upon our line. The firing continued lona: and animated ; and from our commanding situation at the Great Pagoda, though nearly two miles dis tant from the scene of action, we could distinctly hear the yells and shout6 of the infuriated assailants, occasionally re turned by the hearty cheers of the British seamen, as they poured in their heavy broadsides upon the resolute and per severing masses. The thick forest which separated us from the river, prevented our seeing distinctly what was going forward ; and when the firing ceased, we remained for a short time in some anxiety, though in little doubt as to the result of the long and spirited assault. At length, however, the thick canopy of smoke which lowered over the fierce and sanguinary conflict gradually dissolving, we had the pleasure of seeing the masts of our vessels lying at their old station off the fort \u2014 a convincing proof that all had ended well on our side.\" At page 104 et seq., we find the following pas sages : \u2014 \" During the day, repeated attacks on Kemmendine had been made and repulsed ; but it was not until darkness had set in, that the last desperate effort of the day was made, to gain possession of that post. Already the wearied soldiers had lain down to rest, when suddenly the heavens and the whole surrounding country became brilliantly illuminated by the flames of several tremendous fire-rafts, floating down the river towards Rangoon ; and scarcely had the blaze appeared, when incessant rolls of musketry and peals of cannon were heard from Kemmendine. The enemy had launched their fire-rafts into the stream with the first of the ebb tide, in the hope of driving the vessels from their stations oft'the place ; and they were followed up by war-boats ready to take advantage of the confusion which might ensue, should any of them be set on fire. The skill and intrepidity of British seamen, however, proved more than a match for the numbers and devices of the enemy : entering their boats, they grappled the flaming rafts, and conducted them past the shipping, or ran them ashore upon the bank. On the land side the enemy were equally unsuccessful, being again re pulsed with heavy loss, in the most resolute attempt they had yet made to reach the interior of the fort. \" The fire-rafts were, upon examination, found to be ingeniously con trived, and formidably constructed, made wholly of bamboos firmly wrought together, between every two or three rows of which a line of earthen jars"], [59, "DURING THE BURMESE WAR. 49 of considerable size, filled with petroleum, or earth-oil and cotton, were secured; other inflammable ingredients were also distributed in different parts of the raft, and the almost unextinguishable fierceness of the flames proceeding from them can scarcely be imagined. Many of them were con siderably upwards of a hundred feet in length, and were divided into many pieces attached to each other by means of long hinges, so arranged, that when they caught upon the cable or bow of any ship, the force of the current should carry the ends of the raft completely round her, and enve lope her in flames from the deck to the main-top-mast head, with scarcely a possibility of extricating herself from the devouring element. With possession of Kemmendine, the enemy could have launched these rafts into the stream, from a point where they must have reached our shipping in the crowded harbour; but while we retained that post, they were obliged to despatch them from above it, and the setting of the current carried them, after passing the vessels at the station, upon a projecting point of land, where they almost invariably grounded ; and this circumstance, no doubt, much increased Bandoola'6 anxiety to drive us from so important a position.\" Things were in this state when Captain Chads returned from Pegu, at 8 a. m., on the 2nd December. He immedi ately sent the Arachne's pinnace up, under Lieutenant Kellett and Mr. Valentine Pickey, admiralty midshipman, to gain information and reconnoitre ; and shortly after, three row boats, under Mr. William Coyde, midshipman, with a party of seamen to fight their guns. This assistance was most timely, the garrison being pressed in every direction; from which cri tical situation, Lieutenant Kellett's highly judicious and deter mined gallant conduct immediately relieved them, by clearing both their flanks of the enemy, by showers of grape shot. This service performed by the pinnace, with a single carron ade, in the face of hundreds of the enemy's boats, was the admiration of the whole garrison ; and Major Yates ex pressed himself to Captain Chads in terms the most grati fying, \" for the able assistance Lieutenant Kellett had afforded him.\" The Teignmouth shortly afterwards resumed her station, and was constantly engaged with the enemy's war-boats, which had long guns in their bows, and annoyed her a great deal. In the afternoon, finding the Burmese were making every effort to gain possession of Kemmendine, and as that jjost was of the last importance, both in a military and naval E"], [60, "50 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, point of view, Captain Chads ordered the Sophie up for its support, with three more gun-boats, and those already there, under Lieutenant Kellett, to remain. Observing, also, that the enemy upon the Dalla side had begun to throw up works, he likewise directed the Satellite, in charge of Lieutenant Dobson, with a party of seamen from the Arachne, to the support of the Good Hope transport, and several small gun vessels, already for some time stationed there. Early on the 3rd December, the Sophie took her station off Kemmendine. The enemy again brought fire-rafts down, with their war-boats firing shot over them, to prevent the approach of the British. The Sophie cleared the rafts, but the Teignmouth was touched by them, and on fire for a short time, sustaining however no serious damage. \"British seamanship,\" says Major Snodgrass, \"finally tri umphed over every device of the crafty and ingenious enemy.\" During this day the Burmese war-boatmen be came extremely daring, finding their shot went farther than those of the British ; upon which Captain Chads sent Captain Ryves two long 9 -pounders, and enabled him to keep them farther off. Still, however, they continued to evince surprising boldness, and it was thought right to endeavour to give them a check. Accordingly, the latter officer placed the whole of his disposable force of Euro peans, about 80 in number, (including Lieutenant Goldfinch, Messrs. Pickey, Coyde, Scott, and Murray, midshipmen; Lieutenant Curtis Clarke, of the Bombay marine; Mr. Lindquist, in charge of the row-boats ; and Messrs. George Boscawen, midshipman in the Hon. Company's service,) under the orders of Lieutenant Kellett. This force was put into the Arachne' s pinnace and eight other boats, and, as the moon went down on the morning of the 4th December, they shoved off, and pulling upon the contrary shore to the enemy, by day light came abreast of and boldly made a dash at them : the Burmese were completely taken by surprise, but did not run till the British were within pistol shot, when their confusion was great, and they fled with all haste, keep ing up a smart fire. Lieutenant Kellett, in the pinnace,"], [61, "51 DURING THE BURMESE WAR. came up with some of the rearmost, which were soon run ashore and deserted; and Lieutenant Goldfinch, passing him whilst taking possession, captured one bearing the flag of the Bur man chief, her crew also flying into the jungle. The chase was continued three or four miles, when Lieute nant Kellett judged it prudent to secure his prizes, having an enemy of considerable force in his rear, up another branch of the river. The result of this gallant attack was the capture of seven war-boats, one of which was 96 feet long, 13 feet 6 inches in breadth, and 6 feet deep, pulling 1% oars, and, as did three of the others, mounting a long 9-pounder on the bow. \" Lieutenant Kellett's conduct on this, and on former occasions, speaks for itself, and,\" says Captain Chads, \" I trust will meet with its due reward. Lieutenant Goldfinch is a valuable officer, and merits every praise; Lieutenant Kellett reports the high gallantry of every individual under his command. On their return, they cut adrift and brought down a large floating stockade from Pagoda Point ; and what adds to the value of this service is, that it was performed without the loss of a man.\" In Sir A. Campbell's report to the Supreme Government, of the operations of his army at this period, we find the following passages : \" During the 3d and 4th, the enemy carried on his labours with inde fatigable industry, and but for the inimitable practice of our artillery, commanded by Captain Murray, in the absence, from indisposition, of Lieutenant-Colonel [Charles] Hopkinson, we must have been severely annoyed by the incessant fire from his trenches. \" The attacks upon Kemmendine continued with unabating violence ; but the unyielding spirit of Major Yates and his steady troops, although exhausted with fatigue aud want of rest, baffled every attempt on shore, while Captain Ryves, with H. M. sloop Sophie, the H. C. cruiser Teigs inouth, and some flotilla and row-guu-boats, nobly maintained the long established fame of the British navy, in defending the passage of the river against the most furious assaults of the enemy's war-boats, advancing under cover of the most tremendous fire rafts, which the unwearied exertions of British sailors could alone have conquered.\" Sir Archibald next proceeds to acquaint the Governor- General in Council, that the \" intrepid conduct of- Lieu- e 2"], [62, "52 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, tenants Kellett and Goldfinch merits the highest praise ;\" and he then adds i \" The enemy having apparently Completed his left wing, with its full complement of artillery and warlike stores, 1 determined to attack that part of his line early on the morning of the 5th. / requested Captain Chads, the senior naval officer here, to move up to the Puzendoivn creek during the night, with the gun-flotilla, bomb-ketch, fye. and com mence a cannonade on the enemy's rear at day-light. This service teas most judiciously and successfully performed by that officer, who has never yet disappointed me in my most sanguine expectations. The enemy was defeated and dispersed in every direction. The Cassay horse fled, mixed with the retreating infantry, and all their artillery, stores, and reserve depots, which had cost them so much toil and labour to get up, with a great quantity of small arms, gilt chattahs, standards, and other trophies, fell into our hands. Never was victory more complete or more decided, and never was the triumph of discipline and valour, over the disjointed efforts of irregular courage and infinitely superior numbers, more conspicuous.\" The naval force employed in the Puzendown creek was composed of the steam and mortar-vessels, a few of the gun flotilla, and several transports' boats, with about 40 Euro pean soldiers to make an appearance. Mr. Archibald Reed, admiralty midshipman, was with Captain Chads, and \"ren dered him much service.\" In the mean time, the Satellite was very closely and warmly engaged, as she had also been during the nights of the 2d, 3rd, and 4th, with the enemy at Dalla, whose shot struck her in every direction, and greatly injured the rigging ; but as Lieutenant Dobson had taken the precaution to stockade her all around with bamboo, she fortunately had not a man killed or wounded. The Burmese left wing thus disposed of, Sir Archibald Campbell patiently waited its effect upon the right, posted in so thick a forest as to render any attack in that quarter in a great measure impracticable. On the same day, he wrote to Captain Chads in the following terms : \u2014 \"My dear Sir,\u2014 A thousand thanks for the essential diversion you made this morning to the left and rear of the enemy. Their defeat has been, indeed, most complete ; the game is, I think, now up with them, and the further conquest of the country easy\u2014 thanks to all the good and fine fellows under our command by water and land.\""], [63, "53 DURING THE BURMESE WAR. On the 6th in the morning, finding the enemy still per sisting in his attacks on Kemmendine, Captain Chads sent the mortar-vessel up there, which rendered the post very es sential service, and relieved the garrison considerably. The war- boats still continued in sight in great numbers, but at a respectful distance. On the same day, Sir Archibald Campbell had the pleasure of observing that Maha Bandoola had brought up the scat tered remnant of his defeated left, to strengthen his right and centre, and continued day and night employed in carry ing on his approaches in front of the Shwe-da-gon pagoda. This he was allowed to do with but little molestation, as it was rightly imagined that \" he would take system for timid ity.\" On the morning of the 7th, he had his whole force posted in the immediate front of the British army \u2014 his first line entrenched so close, that the men in their barracks could distinctly hear the bravadoes of the Burmese soldiers. Upwards of thirty fire-rafts and large boats, all lashed toge ther, and reaching nearly across the river, were brought down against the shipping ; but, although the Sophie was touched by one of them, they were productive of no mis chief. The time had now arrived to undeceive the enemy in their sanguine but ill-founded hopes. Sir Archibald Campbell made his arrangements, and at 11-30 a. m., every thing was in readiness to assault their trenches. A short but heavy cannonade ensued, and at noon the British columns moved forward to their respective points of attack. They were sa luted, after a momentary pause, by a very spirited fire, in spite of which they advanced to the works, and quickly put their defenders to the route. The Burmese left many dead behind them, and their main force was completely dispersed. On receiving this information, Captain Chads sent every disposable man from the Arachne, under Mr. James B. Manley, acting master, with twenty sepoys, in the steam vessel, up to Captain Ryves, to endeavour to intercept their boats and cut off their retreat ; they had, however, already deserted the neighbourhood of Kemmendine."], [64, "54 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, \" Thus,\" says Captain Chads in his official report, *' has this formidable attack ended in the total discomfiture of the enemy; having called forth from the very small force I have the honor to command, in every instance, the greatest gallantry and uniform good conduct, under the utmost exer tions by day and night, the greatest part of them having been in the boats since the starting of the expedition for Pegu, on the 26th ultimo. \" From Captain Ryves I have received all the aid and counsel that a good and valuable officer could afford ; his determined perseverance in holding his ground, when the fire-rafts came down, merit the highest com mendation ; and from his ready and zealous co-operation with the post at Kemmendine, that place was greatly relieved in the arduous contest it was engaged in. \"Of Lieutenant Kellett I cannot speak in terms sufficiently strong to express my admiration of his uniform gallantry. \" Lieutenant Goldfinch's conduct has also been most conspicuous, toge ther with that of all the midshipmen named in my reports, not one of whom but has shewn individual act3 of great bravery. \" Also to Mr. Manley, the master, who has, from necessity, been fre quently left in charge of the ship during my absence, I feel much in debted *.\" In another despatch, addressed to Sir Archibald Campbell, the commander of the Arachne says :\u2014 \" It becomes a most pleasing duty to me to recommend to your favor able notice, officers in the Honorable Company's service, whose good con duct has been conspicuous in the recent attack of the enemy. The first I ought to name is Mr. W. Binny, agent for transports of the Bengal divi sion, in charge of the Good Hope transport \u2014 that ship, Sir, with the British crew of the Resource, who handsomely volunteered, did all the duties of a man-of-war, in silencing the enemy's gun3 as they mounted them at Dalla. Mr. Hornblow, agent for transports of the Madras division, in charge of the Moira, has also shewn very great zeal in forwarding all the late arduous services ; and the British crew of his ship, in charge of the mortar- vessel, have continued their usual good conduct. In the attack on the enemy's war-boats, Lieutenant Kellett speaks in high terms of the gallantry of Lieutenant Clarke and Mr. Boscawen, of the H. C. cruiser Teignmouth, and Mr. Lindquist, in charge of the row-boats ; this latter young officer I have also had much reason to be pleased with.\" * Lieutenant Keele was then at Martaban, where he remained in com mand of the naval detachment until all the European troops were ordered back to Rangoon, about the end of 1824."], [65, "DURING THE BURMESE WAR. 55 The loss sustained by the Burmese, from the 1st to the 7th December, is supposed to have been at least 5000 men killed and wounded; but they suffered most in arms and ammu nition, which they could not easily replace ; 29 guns (of which eight were brass), 200 jingals, 900 muskets, 360 round shot, 2000 spears, and 5000 intrenching tools, fell into the hands of the conquerors ; besides which, 10,000 pounds of gunpowder, many muskets, spears, swords, and other imple ments, of which no account appears to have been taken, were captured and destroyed. The British had not more than 26 killed and 252 wounded. On the 8th December, Sir Archibald Campbell reported to the Governor-General in Council, that his \" obligations to Captains Chads and Ryves, and the officers and seamen of H. M. navy, were great and numerous. In Captain Chads himself,\" says the General, \" / have always found that ready alacrity to share our toils and dangers, that has ever characterized the profession he belongs to, and the most cordial zeal in assisting and co-operating with me on every occasion.\" On the evening of the same day, Sir Archibald Campbell found that the enemy's corps of observation on the Dalla side of the river had not been wholly withdrawn, probably from ignorance of what had taken place on the 7th, in front of the Shwe-da-gon pagoda ; and as he was well aware they would not remain long after the news of Bandoola's defeat reached them, he at once determined to assault their works. De tachments from three regiments were immediately ordered under arms, and Captain Chads was requested to make a diversion up the creek upon the enemy's right flank. After dark, all the boats assembled alongside the Good Hope transport ; and, just as the moon arose, they moved across the river ; the troops, under Major Charles Ferrior, of the 43rd Madras native infantry, landed to the northward, whilst Captain Chads, accompanied by Lieutenant Kellett and Mr. Reed, proceeded up the creek, and opened his fire; the Satellite doing the same to distract the enemy : the troops then advanced, and jumped, without a moment's hesitation,"], [66, "56 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, into the trenches ; many Burmese were slain in the short conflict that ensued ; they were driven, at she point of the bayonet, into the jungle in their rear; and several guns, with many small arms, taken. In this affair, the British had two killed, and several, including five of the naval detach ment, wounded. Lieutenant Dobson having landed imme diately after the troops, was one of the first to enter the ene my's works. In a general order, issued at Rangoon, on the 12th De cember, Sir Archibald Campbell again \" acknowledges his highest obligations to Captain Chads,\" and \" requests that he will communicate to Captain Ryves, who so effectually supported the post of Kemmendine, his warmest thanks.\" The passage concludes thus : \" the conduct of both officers and men during the whole affair was characteristic of the British navy ! What can be said more to their Ho nour?\" On the evening of the 12th, a deserter from the enemy informed Sir Archibald Campbell, that Maha Bandoola had re-collected his beaten troops, and received considerable re inforcements on his retreat ; which latter circumstance had induced the chiefs (to whom he had for the present resigned his command) to determine on one more great effort to re trieve their disgrace. For this purpose, it afterwards ap peared, they succeeded in forming a force amounting to be tween twenty and twenty-five thousand men ; with which they returned to Kokeen, distant four miles from the Shwe-da-gon pagoda, and immediately commenced intrenching and stock ading with a judgment, in point of position, such as would do credit to the best instructed engineers of the most civilized and warlike nations. The deserter also declared it to be their intention to attack the British lines on the morning of the 14th (pronounced a fortunate day by their soothsayers), de termined to sacrifice their lives at the dearest rate, as they had nothing else to expect than to do so ignominiously, by returning to the presence of their monarch, disgraced and defeated as they had been. This information was too cir cumstantially given to be disregarded, and Sir Archibald"], [67, "57 DURING THE BURMESE WAR. Campbell prepared accordingly : the enemy's movements, next day, left little doubt on his mind of the truth of the deserter's information. Previously to this, the Sophie had been recalled from Kemmendine, and the Hon. Company's cruiser Prince of Wales, commanded by Lieutenant William S. Collinson, ordered to relieve her. On the 13th, the gallant defender of that post addressed two letters to Captain Chads, of which the following are copies : \u2014 \u25a0 \" My dear Sir, \u2014 Mr. Midshipman Lindquist acquaints me, that I am to be attacked this night. May I beg Kellett and his brig, and his boats, and the Powerful ? Alas ! the dear Sophie has forsaken me, and no Prince or Potentate can replace her in my confidence and affection. Prithee keep the Prince of Wales, and cheer my heart again with the presence of Sophie. Believe me ever your obliged and faithful, (Signed) \" C. W. Yates.\" \" My dear Sir, \u2014 My little band are at their post. The fires of the enemy are all arouud me. I hope you will excuse my having detained Mr. Lindquist, and his three boats, until I may hear from you. I have 200 natives short of the force I had the other day, and 27 Europeans. If the Prince of Wales comes I can expect no aid, as her commander is junior to the captain of the Teignmouth, which ship, having twice deserted me, I cannot look for aid from. \" Yours ever faithfully, (Signed) \" C. W. Yates.\" In consequence of this pressing request, Captain Chads sent the Sophie back to her former station ; and with her, the steam-vessel, the mortar-boat, the Prince of Wales, and a detachment of seamen under Lieutenant Kellett. The commander-in-chief also directed 100 sepoys to proceed thither with Captain Ryves. In the night of Dec. 13th, the enemy recommenced offen sive operations, particularly by annoying the vessels off Kemmendine with immense fire-rafts, one of which consisted of upwards of sixty canoes, besides bamboo rafts, all loaded with oil and combustibles. On the 14th, about 2-30 a. m., their emissaries succeeded in setting fire to Rangoon, in several places at once, by which one-fourth of the town, in cluding the quarters of the Madras commissariat, was de stroyed, notwithstanding the utmost efforts of the garrison."], [68, "58 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, the officers and men of the Arachne, and the well-disposed part of the inhabitants, to subdue the flames. The 14th passed -without any other attempts on the part of the enemy ; during the day, however, he was seen above Kemmendine, transporting large bodies of troops from the Dalla to the Rangoon side of the river. For many urgent reasons, Sir Archibald Campbell determined to attack him on the following day, rather than wait his pleasure as to time and place of meeting. Thinking it probable that the enemy's preparations for fire-rafts might be destroyed, and as he had before sent a force up the Panlang branch of the river, without finding any thing, Captain Chads now resolved to despatch one up the Lyne branch, under Lieutenant Kellett, consisting of the steam-vessel, with forty marines and soldiers for her de fence; the Prince of Wales, towed by the Diana; and the pinnaces of the Arachne and Sophie. He thus describes the result of this expedition, in an official letter to Captain Coe, dated Dec. 16, 1824. \" Before day-light yesterday morning, they proceeded with the first of the flood, and at a short distance above Pagoda Point, saw large numbers of the enemy's war-boats, at least 200, who retired in good order as they advanced, keeping up a smart fire from their long guns, five boats having them mounted, and taking their distance that the carronades should not reach them ; when about seven miles up, a raft was drawn right across the river, and set on fire by them, to prevent the advance of our vessels ; but an opening was found, and Lieutenant Kellett, now seeing the river quite clear, with great judgment, decreasing the power of steam, deceived the enemy, and lulled them into security ; when, putting on the whole force again, and casting off the Prince of Wales, he was immediately within grape and musketry distance ; the enemy, finding themselves in this situ ation, drew up in a regular line to receive him : this little band was not, however, to be daunted by their show of resistance, but nobly dashed on, although the Prince of Wales was out of sight ; the heavy fire from the boats' carronades, and musketry, threw the enemy into confusion and panic, and they flew in all directions, leaving us in possession of three of their large war-boats ; one belonging to the chief, mounting three guns, and pulling 60 oars ; the other two, one in their bow, 9 and 6-pounders ; with about forty other boats of all descriptions, many of them loaded with ammunition and provisions for their army before Rangoon. \" The securing of thirty of these boats, and destroying the others, took"], [69, "59 DURING THE BURMESE WAR. Up the whole of the flood ; when Lieutenant Kellett, having most fully accomplished my instructions and wishes, returned, destroying, on his way down, quantities of materials for fire-rafts, and a great many canoes laden with earth-oil. The enemy's loss in killed and wounded must have been very great; we, I rejoice to say, had not a man hurt, the steam-vessel having been stockaded to secure the people. \" I cannot find words sufficiently strong, in which to recommend Lieu tenant Kellett's uniform gallantry to you ; his conduct on this, as well as former occasions, proves him a most valuable officer. Lieutenant Gold finch, of the Sophie, I have also frequently had occasion to name to you, and, with pleasure, I repeat my former recommendations ; he was in the Sophie's pinnace, with Mr. Murray, midshipman. Mr. Tomlinson, admi ralty midshipman, commanded the Arachne's pinnace; and Mr. Winsor, admiralty midshipman, was in charge of the steam-vessel, and shewed his usual judgment and good conduct. \"Lieutenant Kellett speaks in the highest terms of the determined steady conduct of every man under him, soldiers, sailors, and marines ; and feels much indebted to Lieutenant Collinson, commanding the Prince of Wales, for the able assistance that vessel rendered him.\" During these operations, of which Major Snodgrass takes no notice, Sir Archibald Campbell attacked the enemy in the same direction, and gained a most brilliant victory. With only 1300infantry, he stormed, and carried by assault, the most formidable intrenched and stockaded works which he had ever seen, defended by upwards of 20,000 men, under the com mand of the Maha Silwah, an officer of high rank and cele brity, late Governor-General of Assam. In the despatch an nouncing this great achievement, Sir Archibald says, \" our gallant friends afloat were determined not to let the auspi cious day pass without their share of its operations. Every day's experience of the zeal and cordiality with which Cap tain Chads, and every individual composing the naval part of the expedition, co-operates with me in carrying on the combined service, increases my sincere obligations, and merits my warmest thanks.\" The loss sustained by the British army, on the 15th December, amounted to 18 killed and 118 wounded. Previous to the intelligence of Sir Archibald Campbell's last victory reaching Calcutta, the Supreme Government had issued a general order, of which we shall here give two extracts : \u2014"], [70, "60 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, \" The official despatches already published in an Extraordinary Gazette having announced the late brilliant achievements of the British arms at Rangoon, the Right Honorable the Governor-General in Council now proceeds to the discharge of a most gratifying duty, in signifying, in the most public and formal manner, his high admiration of the judgment, skill, and energy, manifested by Brigadier-General Sir Archibald Camp bell, in directing the operations of the troops under his command, on that important and arduous occasion. \u2022 * * \u2022 \u2022 \" The Governor-General in Council seizes this opportunity of expressing Ms warm acknowledgments to Captain Chads, of H.

C. cruisers, as well as the officers and men of the transports who volunteered their services, the sense which Government entertains of their gallant conduct in the several actions with the enemy's war-boats, when they so conspicuously displayed the irresistible and characteristic valor of British seamen.\" On the 17th December, the following correspondence took place between Captain Chads and the commandant of Kem mendine : \u2014 \" My dear Sir, \u2014 Considering your post now secure, and the war, as a war against fire, I have deemed it right to recall the Sophie and mortar boat, as the more vessels the greater risk, and the responsibility is very great and heavy on the shoulders of so junior an officer as myself. Whilst danger threatened you, I was willing to incur all risk, and make any sa crifice, feeling the very welfare of the whole expedition hung on the result of your gallant exertions. The two cruisers remain, and they have my directions now not to be too tenacious in holding on against fire-rafts. Believe me, my dear Sir, yours very faithfully, (Signed) \" H. D. Chads.\" \" To Major Yates, fye. fye.\" \" My dear Sir, \u2014 Believe me, I feel as I ought the depth of obligation I owe to you ; and that, while grateful for the aid you have afforded me, I was fully sensible of the extent of responsibility to which your ardour in the cause had induced you to expose yourself. I feel with you the necessity of your present arrangements, and am confident that your own personal exertions, in the active employ of your boats, will impart to those arrange ments stability which will secure your ultimate object. I cannot tell you how proud I feel of your approval. Believe me it is infinitely more valued than that received from any other source, by yours, my dear Sir, ever faithfully, (Signed) \" C. W. Yates.\" \" To Captain Chads, R. N.\""], [71, "DURING THE BURMESE WAR. 61 In the latter part of Dec. 1824, Captain Chads sent several reconnoitring parties up both branches of the river above Pagoda Point, as far as Thesit on the one, and Than-ta-bain on the other. On the 22d of this month, Lieutenant Kellett destroyed three fire-rafts, each at least 100 feet square, com posed of dried wood, piled up with oil, gunpowder, etc. On the 24th, the Larne returned from Calcutta ; and soon after wards, the army received large reinforcements from Bengal, Madras, and Ceylon : the naval force also was encreased by the arrival of about twenty additional gun-boats from Chit tagong. The character of the war was now completely changed . The enemy no longer dared attempt offensive operations, but restricted themselves to the defence of their positions along the Lyne and Panlang rivers, to harass and detain the British force, which, agreeable to the policy that had been enjoined by the events of the war, prepared to dictate the terms of peace, if necessary, within the walls of the Burmese capital. The retreat of Maha Bandoola, to Donoobew, left the field com pletely open in front of the invaders' lines. Not a single armed man remained in their neighbourhood ; and \" numbers of the people, at length released from military restraint, and convinced of the superiority of the British troops over their countrymen, and of their clemency and kindness to the van quished, poured daily into Rangoon : the most important result attending the return of the inhabitants to their houses, was the means which they afforded of equipping canoes for the transport of provisions, and of obtaining servants and drivers for the commissariat, with which the force was before very scantily provided, owing to the impossibility of in ducing that class of people in Bengal to volunteer their ser vices in Ava *.\" In the beginning of 1825, Sir Archibald Campbell and Captain Chads prepared to advance upon Ava, to which city the Burmese Court was then about to remove from Umera- * Snodgrass, 128\u2014130"], [72, "62 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, poora. The joint crews of the Arachne, Larne, and Sophie, including supernumeraries and the officers and men em- ployed in the flotilla, at this time amounted to no more than 237 persons. In order to leave no obstruction in his rear, Sir Archibald Campbell, on the 1 1th January, directed a detachment of 200 troops, under Lieutenant-Colonel R. G. Elrington, of H. M. 47th regiment, to be embarked on board two divisions of gun-boats, commanded by Captain G. T. Finnucane, of H. M. 14th regiment, and Lieutenant Joseph H. Rouband, of the Bombay marine, for the purpose of driving the enemy from the old Portuguese fort and the pagoda of Syriam (the latter doubly stockaded), both which posts they had re-occu- pied since their last defeat. The naval part of this expedi- tion \"was most nobly conducted\" by Lieutenant Keele, then just returned from Martaban, who took with him 48 officers and men belonging to H. M. sloops of war. The detachment landed under the fort, and found the bridge across the nullah removed : to make another, with planks sent for the occasion, gave the navy an opportunity of displaying their usual activity, skill, and steady courage. On this point the enemy kept up a heavy and well-directed fire, by which nearly 30 men were killed and wounded, including among the latter Mr. Atherton, acting purser of the Larne, and five sailors. In a few minutes, however, the bridge was laid, by the blue jackets swimming across with the planks ; two of the gun-boats were also brought up the creek. On the soldiers gaining the opposite bank, and rushing upon the works, the enemy instantly fled, although the place was as strong as considerable art and indefatigable labour could render it, and was capable of making a most formidable re- sistance. Four guns were found in the fort, and upwards of twenty swivels. At the attack of the Syriam pagoda, next morning, \" the sailors assisted in manning the scaling ladders, and Lieu tenant Keele teas the first person over\" the stockade at the foot of the edifice : here ended the military operations, for"], [73, "DURING THE BURMESE WAR. 63 the enemy made no further resistance, and parties were im mediately formed to burn and destroy the works*. Lieutenant Keele reported in the highest terms the steady bravery and good conduct of Lieutenants Fraser and Bazely; Messrs. Lett, Coyde, Michell, Cranley, and Scott, midship men ; Mr. Atherton, and of every man attached to the flotilla. One occurrence we feel it but justice to name, as shewing a truly British spirit. A soldier, in crossing the bridge, fell overboard and would have been drowned, but for the gal lantry and humanity of Mr. Scott, who instantly jumped after him, under the enemy's heavy fire, and was himself ex hausted when brought on shore. On the 15th of January, a letter arrived from Maha Ban doola, addressed to the European merchants who were resid ing at Rangoon previous to the invasion of Ava. Although of a vague and indefinite character, it evinced a material alteration in the temper of that chieftain, and a disposition, if not to treat for peace, at least to respect his antagonists. The tenor of this letter (which was the first that had ever been received from him), and its being addressed to non official persons, precluded its being made the basis of a nego ciation ; but an answer was written by Sir Archibald Camp bell, pointing out to Bandoola the propriety of addressing the British General direct, if he had any communication to make, to which he was desirous the latter should pay regard, and assuring him that Sir Archibald would ever be accessi ble to any correspondence of an amicable purport. No notice of this was taken by the Burmese commander, and even if sincere in his first advance, the re-assembling of his forces at Donoobew probably encouraged him to tnake another appeal to the chance of war. On the 22nd January, H. M. ship Alligator arrived at Ran goon, and Captain Chads was succeeded in his extremely ar duous command, by Captain Alexander.

On the 24th of the same month, Captain Coe, then at Trin- comalee, acknowledged the receipt of his various despatches, and thanked him for his \"zeal, activity, and officer-like conduct, evinced in the various successful attacks on the enemy, by the combined naval and military force employed in the river Rangoon.\" Captain Coe also requested him to convey to Captain Ryves, the officers, &c. &c. &c. of the Arachne and Sophie, the high opinion he entertained of the bravery and coolness displayed by them, in the many oppor- tunities they had had of distinguishing themselves in action with the enemy. \" My warmest acknowledgments,\" said he, \" are due to Captain Ryves, acting Lieutenant Goldfinch, and Mr. Winsor, with Lieutenant Kellett of the sloop you command, whose name ranks foremost amongst those who have distinguished themselves ; and I beg to add, that the services of those officers, as well as all employed, shall be laid before the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty.\" In another letter, dated March 29th, Captain Coe says, \"I have to acknowledge the receipt of your communications of the 14th and 17th January last, and feel much gratified by the continued and successful exertions of the officers, sea- men, and marines under your command, to whom I am again lo request you will convey my warmest thanks, more particularly to Lieutenant Charles Keele, of the Arachne, and Mr. Scott, of the Sophie, whose gallant exertions in the cause of humanity, shall be represented to the Lords Com- missioners of the Admiralty, to whose attention I have before had the honor of submitting various despatches relative to the gallantry of the squadron employed at Rangoon.\""], [75, "65 DUstING TUB BURMESE WAR. CHAPTER HI. \" Th e means of the British commander-in-chief, did not en able him to equip a large land column, nor under any circum stances would it probably have been practicable to attempt an exclusive land movement, upon a point at the distance of 600 miles from his depots : an unlimited command of carriage could alone have enabled him to do so \u2014 in which case he might, probably, have advanced by the shortest and best road upon the capital, via Pegu and Tonghoo, turning all the ene my's positions on the Irrawaddy, and taking him unpre pared on a new line of operations, with his troops posted at a distance. It was, however, obvious, that these advantages must be sacrificed to the one great and important point of securing the river communication, for the conveyance of sup plies to the army in the field, and for which purpose a com bined land and water movement was determined on \u2014 the land column advancing in a direction parallel to, and at no great distance from the river, with a view to mutual co-operation and support*.\" In the beginning of Feb. 1825, the flotilla was employed in supporting a large body of Peguers, who, in consequence of a proclamation circulated by Sir Archibald Campbell, had left Panlang and retired into the Dalla district, where they maintained so good a front, that, although followed by a Burmese force, the latter dared not to attack them. Previous to the advance upon Ava, it was necessary to open a passage up the Lyne river, for which purpose a force was detached under Lieutenant-Colonel Godwin and Captain Chads, who captured a large stockade at Than-ta-bain, with 36 guns mounted, and destroyed an immense number of fire- * Snodgrass, 1 32, et seq. F"], [76, "66 NAVAL OPEHATI0NS IN AVA, rafts and canoes filled with combustibles, for the annoyance of the British shipping. \" A detail of the operations of the column,\" says Sir Archibald Campbell, \" affords me another opportunity of bringing to the notice of the Right Honor able the Governor- General in Council, the judgment and de cision of Lieutenant- Colonel Godwin and Captain Chads; and bearing no less honorable testimony to the irresistible intrepidity so often displayed both by soldiers and sailors on this expedition.\" The naval force employed consisted of the Satellite, Diana, Prince of Wales, fifteen row gun-boats, seven boats belong ing to H. M. squadron, and several fiats and canoes. The officers sent under Captain Chads were Lieutenants Dobson, Keele, Kellett, and Fraser ; acting Lieutenants Goldfinch and William Hayhurst Hall ; Mr. Lett, master's-mate ; Messrs. Norcok, Winsor, Wyke, Biffin, Pickey, Reed, Coyde, Tomlinson, and Scott, midshipmen ; and Mr. Wil liam Watt, surgeon of the Arachne, who had invariably vo lunteered, and been with Captain Chads on every previous service, and whose kind care of the sick and wounded was always unremitting. On the 5th Feb., the troops selected for this service were embarked, and the expedition proceeded up the river. On the morning of the 6th, a flag of truce was sent forward with two Burmese prisoners, conveying a proclamation issued by Sir A. Campbell, which was received by the enemy, and re plied to most respectfully, explaining the inability of the chief to surrender, in a language of mildness rarely used by this vain and barbarous people. At 5 p. it., the Satellite, towed by the Diana, advanced upon the enemy's position, which was a strong and imposing one, upon the point of a peninsula, forming a branch of the river going off at a right angle to Panlang, measuring three-quarters of a mile on its water front, built of teak timber, very high, strongly stockaded, and abattised down to the water's edge, but entirely open in the rear. The boats, in three divisions, were led by Lieutenants Keele, Kellett, and Fraser."], [77, "67 nUltlN'G TMF, BURMESE WAR. - The British vessels were allowed to approach within half a mile before the enemy opened their fire, whichprovedextremelv heavy, and raked the Satellite until she brought up by the stern with a bower anchor, the Diana hanging by her, at about forty yards distant from the enemy's works, enfilading the whole of their right, and commanding their left abreast of her ; in per forming which Lieutenant Dobson and Mr. Winsor rendered Captain Chads much assistance. The Satellite's broadside was then opened with great effect, and on board the Diana a detachment of the Bengal rocket-corps, under Captain Charles Graham, showed admirable practice; in a quarter of an hour the enemy were seen in great confusion, and orders given to storm, which was done in gallant style. Lieutenant Keele and acting Lieutenant Hall, with their boats' crews, \"were the first to enter the enemy's position, and,\" adds Lieutenant- Colonel Godwin, \" their conduct was most conspicuous. These were followed by Captain O'Reilly, with the grenadiers of H. M. A\\st regiment.\" The resistance within was trifling, although the place was garrisoned by two thousand fighting men. The enemy suffered severely, and were followed for a mile and a half ; a few prisoners were taken, and many de serters came in the following day. The loss on the part of the assailants amounted to no more than one seaman drowned, and three soldiers, four British sailors, and two Lascars wounded*. \u00bb Upon approaching the stockade, Mr. George Wyke, midshipman of the Alligator, jumped overboard from that ship's launch, holding his sword, by the becket, in his mouth, with a hope of getting on shore before any of his companions. The strong tide and great depth of water rendered his situation extremely dangerous; but fortunately he got hold of an oar, thrown to him by Mr. Valentine Pickey, and was rescued in time to enable him to enter the stockade amongst the foremost of the assailants. While Mr. Wyke. was resting on the oar, the loom of it was carried away by one of the enemy's shot. . On the lSthDec. 1827, this young officer, then serving under Sir Thomas Staines, in the Isis 50, jumped from the taffrail of that ship, aud saved the life of a valuable seaman, who had fallen overboard in the Mediterranean ; the wind then blowing strong, the ship in stays, and the weather very cold. stir. Wyke has since passed his examination. f2"], [78, "68 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, Immediately after the capture of the above stockade, Cap tain Chads sent a division of boats up both branches of the river, under Lieutenants Keele and Kellett, who took and destroyed many of the enemy's war-boats. On the morning of the 7th, Lieutenant Keele was again sent with some gun-boats and troops up the Panlang branch, to explore ; and Captain Chads, with Lieutenant-Colonel Godwin and the remaining gun-boats, went up the main branch for the same purpose. The former officer proceeded about twenty-two miles with abundance of water, and the river never less than thirty-five yards wide ; his commander ascertained that there were no local obstacles to the pro- gress of gun-vessels carrying provisions for the army to Meondaga, formerly an extensive village, on the banks of a rivulet falling into the Lyne river, and about fifty miles dis- tant from Rangoon ; but positive directions for the return of the troops by a fixed period prevented him proceeding to the commencement of this branch from the great river, which he had reason to believe he could have accomplished in another tide. Both divisions met with and destroyed hun- dreds of fire-rafts and canoes similarly prepared, lying on the bank of the river for upwards of fifteen miles, some of which the enemy lighted and launched as the boats ap proached. This service was effectually performed by acting Lieutenants Goldfinch and Hall. Never were there a better spirit and mutual good will shewn between the two services than on this occasion ; every individual, military and naval, did his duty with the greatest cheerfulness and gallantry. Some of the troops were left to occupy the captured stockade as a military post, and the Prince of Wales was ordered by Captain Chads to remain there, with four gun-boats, for its support. On the 10th Feb. he received a letter from Captain Alexander, of which the following is a copy : \u2014 \" With the greatest pleasure I acknowledge the receipt of your letter of yesterday's date, detailing your proceedings in the attack of the for midable stockade of Quangalee *, and congratulate you most heartily on * Than-ta-bain."], [79, "DURING TUE BURMESE WAR. 69 h aving carried it with such a small loss, which can only be attributed to the handsome manner you brought the Satellite up. \" By the first opportunity I shall forward your letter to Commodore Coe, and shall not fail to state the many obligations I am under to you, for the judicious arrangements in planning the attack, and for the Panlang and Lain branches of the expedition getting ready.\" On the same day, Captain Alexander wrote to the acting Commodore as follows : \u2014 \" The judicious manner of anchoring the Satellite by the stern on the flood tide, with the steam-boat ahead of her, does Captain Chads the great- est credit. His arrangements and assistance since my arrival call forth my warmest thanks ; a better or more indefatigable officer is not in the service, aud I trust you will bring him, with the other officers, seamen, and marines employed on this service, to the favorable notice of my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty : I hope you will excuse my noticing an individual, where all did their duty so gallantly; but in justice to acting Lieutenant Hall, I beg to call your attention to the handsome mention made of him by Captain Chads ; he is in every respect a good officer, and has passed for a lieutenant near five years.\" Extract of a letter from George Swinton, Esq. to Sir A. Campbell, dated \" Fort William, \\%th March, 1825.\" \"I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch relative to the capture of the strong post of Than-ta-bain, or Quangalee, by a de tachment of troops under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Godwin, aided by a party of seamen under Captain Chads and Lieutenants Keele and Hall. The Governor-General in Council is happy to observe, in the signal and complete success which attended the operations against Than-ta-bain, the same judgment, energy, and skill, on the part of Lieutenant-Colonel Godwin, which distinguished his conduct on the occasion of his being de tached against Martaban, and which again demand the unqualified appro bation and applause of his Lordship in Council. \" To Captain Chads the Governor-General in Council desires to express his constant acknowledgments for the distinguished share he bore in the action. His Lordship in Council has also noticed, with particular satisfaction, the characteristic gallantry displayed by Lieutenants Keele and Hall, who, with their boats' crews, were the first to enter the enemy's fort, followed by Captain O'Reilly, of the grenadiers of H.

His Lord ship in Council requests that these sentiments of the Supreme Government may be conveyed to Captain Chads and Lieutenants Keele and Hall, through the senior officer of his Majesty's ships. *\" \u2022 Major Snodgrass says not a word respecting the expedition against Than-ta-bain."], [80, "70 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, Every thing being now ready for the advance upon Ava, Sir Archibald Campbell formed such force as he possessed the means of moving, into two columns ; one to proceed by land, and the other by water. With the former, 2468 strong, he purposed moving in a direction parallel to the Lyue river, driving the enemy from all his posts upon that branch ; and to join the Irrawaddy at the nearest accessible point, for the purpose of co-operating with the marine column in driving the Bandoola from Donoobew, should its aid for that purpose be required. The point upon which the land column would join the Irrawaddy, in a country so little known, could not be fixed. The island formed by the Lyne and Panlang rivers, was represented as a wilderness of im passable jungle, but across which, it was said, the Carians, by Bandoola's order, had cut a path for the sake of commu nication from Meondaga to the Irrawaddy, opposite to Do noobew, by which, should it prove correct, it was intended the column should advance ; but by much the most certain route, and in many respects the most eligible, led to Sar rawah, on the great river, about sixty miles from Donoobew.* The marine column, which was placed under the orders of Brigadier-General (now Sir Willoughby) Cotton, consisted of 799 European infantry, 250 sepoys, 108 foot-artillery, and twelve of the rocket corps : these were embarked in the flotilla, consisting of two mortar-boats, six gun -vessels, thirty armed row-boats, about sixty launches, flats, canoes, &c. and all the boats of the men-of-war remaining at Rangoon, contain ing every disposable officer and man of the Alligator, Arachne, and Sophie ; the whole escorted by the Diana and Satellite, and under the immediate command of Captain Alexander.

A third division, 780 strong, under Major Sale, accompanied by the Larne and Mercury, was sent up the western branch of the great river, to attack Bassein ; after reducing which, it was expected sufficient laud- carriage might be obtained in the district, to enable it to push on to Donoobew, and form a junction with the water column, or to Henzedah, where a communication with the land division might be opened ; and both places were believed to be within fifty miles of Bassein. f The rest of the force at Rangoon (3/81 effective men, and 134 sit only for garrison duty) was left there under Brigadier M'Creagh, who was to form a reserve column as soon as means of transport could be col- lected, and to follow the advance of Sir Archibald Campbell. The3e arrangements completed, the commander-in-chief be- gan his march on the 13th February; the water column moved on the 16th, and the expedition against Bassein sailed on the l~th of the same month. The charge of the shipping at Rangoon was entrusted to Captain Ryves. On the latter day, three newly built, but unoccupied stock- ades, were destroyed at Thesit, by the combined force under Brigadier-General Cotton and Captain Alexander. From thence to Panlang were numerous strong breast- works, and both banks of the river covered with fire-rafts. A few miles above Thesit, the light division of boats, under Lieutenant William Smith, of the Alligator, had two men mortally wound- ed by musketry from a stockade, which our sailors soon burnt to the ground, the enemy flying as they advanced to storm it. All the other works were found deserted. During the night of the 18th, some formidable fire-rafts were launched by the Burmese ; but owing to the activity of Lieutenant Smith, their effect was totally lost. On the 19th, the extensive stockade of Panlang and its outworks were taken, after a feeble resistance, although the enemy's force was estimated at between 4000 and 5000 men, supported by a number of * -Suodgrass, '36. t Id. ih."], [82, "72 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, war-boats, and commanded by the Kee Wongee *.

No certain information could be obtained of any road across the Lain island ; on the contrary, the Carians distinctly stated that none existed. To Sarrawah, the road was known and cer tain, with the additional advantage of being able to take on the provision-boats many miles further.

Previous thereto, the light division had put thir teen war-boats to flight, while a few soldiers of the 89th re giment were landed, who drove the enemy from an outpost on the left bank of the river, killed several men, and brought off one prisoner. In the mean time, the land column had forded the Lyne river, at Theeboon, (about 58 miles from Meondaga), and marched on to Sarrawah, the head-quarters of the Burmese war-boats in Pegu. At Theeboon, Sir Archibald Campbell received a note from Brigadier-Gene ral Cotton, announcing the capture of Panlang, and the immediate advance of the marine column into the Irra waddy. \"To this point,\" says Major Snodgrass, \"the indefatigable perseverance of the naval officer in charge had brought our provision-boats ; and here all our commissa riat-carts, and means of transport, were, for the last time, fully replenished. Lieutenant Dobson, of the Larne, but who continued to command the Satellite until the middle of April, 1825, was charged with the important duty of defending the transports, &c. at Panlang, and displayed \" great zeal and alacrity in forwarding the supplies from thence.\" On the morning of the 6th, the flotilla took up a position about two miles below the white pagoda of Donoobew, while Brigadier-General Cotton and Captain Alexander pro ceeded to reconnoitre a succession of formidable stockades, commencing at the pagoda, and increasing in strength until completed by the main work, which was lofty, and situated upon a very commanding site, surrounded by a strong abbatis, with deep ditches and all the customary defences : the guns appeared to be numerous, and the garrison were seen in crowds upon all the works. At 1-30 p. m., Brigadier-General Cotton sent a flag of"], [84, "74 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, truce, with a summons to Bandoola to surrender the place, giving one hour for a reply, which arrived at half-past three. It contained a civil but decided refusal to accede to the proposed terms. A detachment of 160 men, covered by the light division and some row-boats, had been prepared to land on the left bank of the river, to reconnoitre a point opposite the main stockade, which was in possession of some men belonging to war -boats, that were lying under cover of the bank. This party was immediately advanced ; some of the war-boats retired under the guns on the opposite side, where they were unassailable, and the object of the reconnoissance was com pletely gained. During the time that the British boats were in progress, and while lying at the point, the enemy kept up an incessant fire from about thirty pieces of cannon, many of heavy calibre. The precision with which they were di rected, gave a colouring of truth to the report, that the Burmese generalissimo had been for some time practising his artillery. The range had been well ascertained, and the river was commanded all across. Not having a sufficient force to attack the main work, and at the same time maintain a free communication between his column and the depot at Panlang, upon which the success of the campaign entirely depended, Brigadier-General Cotton found he had no option but that of landing below the whole of the stockades, and attacking them in succession, while the flotilla defended the river. Preparations were accordingly made to commence with the pagoda stockade; and at sun-rise, on the 7th, five hun dred soldiers were disembarked one mile below it : the men were formed into two columns of equal strength, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel John William O'Do noghue and Major James L. Basden, of the 4/th and 89th regiments ; two 6-pounders were landed under Captain Kennan, of the Madras artillery ; and Lieutenant James Paton, of the Bengal establishment, had charge of a small rocket battery. Both columns were led with the utmost"], [85, "75 DURINC THE BURMESE WAR. steadiness ; as they advanced, the armed boats pulled in and cannonaded ; while, at proper range, a steady fire was opened from the field- pieces and rocket-battery. This the enemy returned with a perseverance and spirit that had seldom been evinced by them ; the gorges of the work attacked were narrow, and completely occupied by the gallant troops who were forcing an entrance, which, when made good, left the Burmese, who are reported to have been 3000 strong, no alternative but a passage over their own formidable de fences. They were overtaken in the last abbatis, where they stood to fire, until closed upon by the troops inside, and checked by others who had run round outside in search of an entrance to the body of the work. The dead, the wounded, and the panic-struck, fell in one common heap, in and close upon the abbatis ; of the two latter, 280 were brought in prisoners ; and the total loss of the enemy, in this affair, cannot be estimated at less than 450 men. The assailants had about 20 killed and wounded. The second defence was about 500 yards from the pagoda stockade ; and for the immediate reduction of it, two more 6-pounders, four 5|-inch howitzers, and a fresh supply of rockets, were brought up, and placed in position. The gun boats again began to cannonade ; \u2014 the enemy kept close, inducing the supposition that he intended to reserve his strength for the main stockade. When it was presumed that a sufficient impression had been made, 200 men, under the command of Captain R. C. Rose, of the 89th regiment, ad vanced in two parties to the assault ; a destructive fire was immediately commenced from all parts of the face of the work, which caused the columns to diverge to the right of the point of attack, and get into a ditch, described to be filled with spikes, and scarped, so as to expose it to the fire of the work. All who presented themselves were knocked down ; and here Captain Rose, who had already received one wound, fell by a second shot, while persevering in the attack, and shewing a gallant example to his troops. Captain Charles Cannon, also of the 83th, a brave and deserving officer, was killed ; three other officers of the same regiment vsrere"], [86, "76 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, wounded, and-the loss, in men, was extremely heavy*. The party was at length directed to retire. The two mortars and four 12-pounder brass guns, were landed from the flo- tilla to increase the field battery. The enemy likewise strengthened his work, and towards evening brought more heavy guns into play. \"It now became necessary to con- sider what would be the ultimate result of the operations ; and,\" says Brigadier- General Cotton, \"although I feel con- fident that I could have carried the second work, it would have been with a further loss, which would prevent an at- tempt upon the main stockade, and I should have been either left in a position exposed to one of superior strength, or have to relinquish the post after carrying it at a great sacrifice. There was another alternative, and, with much regret, the conviction that I should thus best forward the service, in duced me to adopt the measure of re-embarking and occu pying a position until I could receive a reinforcement. The guns and stores of every description were re-shipped, and after spiking the enemy's cannon, and destroying the nume rous jingals and other arms which had been taken, the troops marched out steady, at 2 a. m. on the 8th, and embarked with perfect regularity, without any description of loss.\" The flotilla then dropped down to Youngyoun, ten miles be low Donoobew, and re-occupied a strong position, from which Jt had moved early on the morning of the 6th. The heavy and long continued cannonade at Donoobew was distinctly heard by the troops at Sarrawah, and left a strong conviction on their minds that the place had fallen. \"Numerous natives, in the course of that day and the follow ing night, confirmed the belief, by unqualified accounts of Ban doola's total rout. \" Many urgent reasons,\" says Major Snodgrass, \" called for our immediate advance, as well to prevent the enemy from reaching, and perhaps occupying Prome with his defeated army, as to deprive the people in our front of sufficient time for burning and laying waste the \u2022 About 94 killed, wounded, and missing ; in addition to which, the flotilla had two men slain and thirteen wounded."], [87, "DURING THE BURMESE WAR. 77 country, which they would no doubt immediately commence, when the fall of Donoobew was known. The following day was, however, given to the chance of hearing from Brigadier- General Cotton, and accounts still poured in of the Ban doola's hasty retreat.\" Early in the morning of the 11th March, Sir Archibald Campbell, then at U-au-deet, a town of considerable extent, upon the banks of the great river, about 26 miles above Sar rawah, received official intelligence, that the water column had failed in the attack upon the outworks of Donoobew, and that, without a large reinforceriient, the place could not be carried, being both strong and well defended by a nu merous garrison. \" On receiving this unpleasant and unex pected news,\" says the Major, \" two questions naturally arose, \u2014 whether to push on to Prome with the land column, and reinforce Brigadier-General Cotton from the rear, by a strong detachment which was about to move forward from Rangoon, or at once to retrograde, and finish the business at Donoobew. The latter measure was decided on \u2014 the flotilla, upon which the land column depended for sup plies, being stopped, and the navigation of the Irrawaddy so completely commanded, that not a canoe could pass the ene my's position. Our commissariat too, at the time, had not ten day's rations left: no reliance could be placed upon the country for furnishing even one day's consumption. The people every where fled before us, and even when chance threw an individual in our way, he only answered all our questions and requests, by pointing towards Donoobew, and exclaiming 'Bandoola! Bandoola!' In a word, starvation stared us in the face at every step, had we proceeded ; and the occupation of Prome, however desirable, was not to be attempted under circumstances so imminently hazardous.\" On the 13th, the land column again reached Sarrawah ; \" and here an obstacle of a most serious nature presented itself. To reach Donoobew, the Irrawaddy, one of the widest and most rapid rivers of the East, must be crossed by an army, with cavalry, artillery, and commissariat equip ment, and unprovided with any means for such an under-"], [88, "78 NAVAL OPKHATIONS IN AVA, taking, beyond a few small canoes, which had been with difficulty procured. Energy and perseverance, however, aided by the cheerful and hearty exertions of the soldiers, finally triumphed over every obstacle. Rafts were construct ed to cross the artillery, stores, &c. ; and by continued la bour, day and night, on the 18th, every man had reached in safety the right bank of the Irrawaddy *.\" On the 24th, Sir Archibald halted at a village, from which he had a to lerable view of the enemy's works, distant only four miles. A fleet of war-boats lay above them, at a little island ; and on the approach of a reconnoitring party from the British camp, \" they came out in very pretty style, and commenced a cannonade. The flotilla was also seen lying at anchor some distance below, and every thing seemed to promise a speedy trial of strength with the now confident and embold ened garrisons-\" On the 25th, the army moved upon Do noobew, and endeavoured to invest the main stockade at long gun-shot distance : it was, however, found much too exten sive to admit of its being surrounded even by a chain of posts, by so small a force ; and a position was consequently taken up. While this was going forward, the enemy manned his works, and fired upon the British troops ; \"his cavalrv hovered on their flanks, while they continued in motion ; and everything about the stockade bespoke system and judgment in the chief, with order, confidence, and regularity in the garrison %.\" Captain Alexander, not yet aware of the near approach of Sir Archibald Campbell, had previously moved the armed flotilla up to an island about a mile below the white pagoda, where he waited, in most painful anxiety, the arrival of the land column ; and was each night annoved by the distant firing of the Burmese war-boats, and of guns brought down to the bank of the river, which sometimes did mischief, and was always extremely harassing. On the 26th he was relieved from suspense by the sight of the Deputy- Quarter-Master-General, who had been sent with a small party to open a communication with Brigadier-General Cot- * Snoilgiass, 158 et seq. t Id. 163. + Id. 1G4."], [89, "79 DURING THE BURMESE WAR. ton, and who informed him that the enemy had been repulsed, the preceding night, in an attack upon the British camp. On the morning of the 27th, the Diana, with one mortar boat, four gun-vessels, and a number of flats, &c. in tow, the latter carrying provisions and breaching guns recently ar rived from Panlang, pushed past the enemy's works, and formed a junction with the land column, then vigorously em ployed in digging trenches, and throwing up batteries for guns and mortars. The flotilla was no sooner observed in motion than the garrison of Donoobew sortied in considerable force, infantry and cavalry, with seventeen war- elephants, fully caparisoned, and carrying a proportion of armed men. This attack was, as usual, directed upon the right of the line ; and while the flotilla came up in full sail under all the fire of the enemy's works, \" the British cavalry, covered by the horse-artillery, was ordered to charge the advancing monsters : the scene was novel and interesting ; and although neither the elephants nor their riders can ever be very for midable in modern warfare, they stood the charge with a steadiness and Courage these animals can be rarely brought to show. Their riders were mostly shot ; and no sooner did the elephants feel themselves unrestrained, than they walked back to the fort with the greatest composure. During the heavy cannonade that took place between the flotilla and the stockade, MahaBandoo'a, who was superintending the prac tice of his artillery, gave his garrison a specimen of the disci pline he meant to enforce, in this last struggle to retrieve his lost character and reputation. A Burmese officer being killed while pointing a gun, by a shot from the flotilla, his comrades, instantly abandoning the dangerous post, could not be brought back to their duty by any remonstrances of their chief; when Bandoola, stepping down to the spot, in stantly severed the heals of two of the delinquents from their bodies, and ordered them to be stuck up upon the spot, ' poi.r encourager les autres.*\" In forcing the passage past Donoobew, the flotilla, although exposed to a very heavy fire \u00bb Snodgrass, 171, et snj."], [90, "80 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, for an hour and a half, had only eight men wounded. One of the gun-vessels received a shot between wind and water, but fortunately reached the shore before she filled. On the 28th, \"the working parties continued making approaches towards the place ; and the steam- vessel and some light boats, pushing up the river after the enemy's war boats, succeeded in capturing nine of them : their crews, when likely to be run down by the steam-boat, jumping into the river, effected their escape.\" On the 29th, 30th, and 31st, the British \" continued constructing batteries, and landing heavy ordnance ; the enemy on their part remaining very quiet, and busily employed in strengthening their works *.\" On the completion of the breaching batteries, one, mount ing four brass 12-pounders, was manned by the royal navy, and placed under the command of Lieutenant Smith. On the morning of the 1st April, the mortars and rockets began the work of destruction ; and continued firing, at intervals, during the day and succeeding night. On the 2nd, at day light, the breaching batteries opened, and almost immediately afterwards, two Lascars, who had been taken prisoners, came running out, and informed the besiegers, that Maha Ban doola had been killed the day before by a rocket ; and that no entreaty of the other chiefs could prevail upon the gar rison to remain, the whole having fled or dispersed, during the preceding night. The British line was, in consequence} immediately under arms, and the place taken possession of: 28 pieces of brass ordnance, 110 iron guns, one carronade, and 269 jingals, were found mounted on the works ; a consi derable quantity of gunpowder, sulphur, saltpetre, shot, musket-balls, and pig-lead, and a depot of grain sufficient for the consumption of the whole combined force for many months, likewise fell into the hands of tb conquerors, whose total loss during the siege was 14 killed and missing, and 69 wounded. After detailing his operations against Donoobew, Sir Archibald Campbell says : * Snodgrass, 172."], [91, "81 DURING THE BURMESE WAR. \" I now Leg leave to acknowledge my obligations to Captain Alexander, C. B., senior naval officer, and commanding the flotilla, for his hearty and cordial co-operation on all occasions since we have served together, and for his very great exertions on the present occasion, in bringing up stores and provisions. Since we have been before Donoobew, eleven of the enemy's large class war-boats have been captured by our advanced boats, under his own immediate orders ; making, with others, evacuated by their crews, thirty-eight first-rate war-boats now in our possession; and I have every reason to think that only five of the large squadron, the enemy had stationed at this place, have succeeded in escaping. A vast number of other boats, of an excellent description, have also fallen into our hands. By Brigadier-General Cotton, and all the officers embarked, the zeal and incessant labour of His Majesty's navy are mentioned in terms of high admiration.\" The following is an extract from Captain Alexander's offi cial report to Captain Coe, dated April 2, 1825 : \" In my former despatch, dated Feb. 24th, I gave you the names of all officers and young gentlemen commanding boats*, and I again request you will be pleased to recommend them to the favorable attention of my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, with the seamen and marines I have had the pleasure to command, their conduct having been such as to merit the highest encomiums \u2014 their privations, hardships, and fatigue, during up wards of six weeks, by day and night, in open boats, have been borne with cheerfulness, and every duty performed with alacrity. \" Of Captain Chads I can only say, he has fully supported his former character, and has my best thanks. I trust I may be allowed to name my first Lieutenant, Smith, au already distinguished officer. Mr. Watt, sur geon of the Arachne, a volunteer, has been of most essential service in attention to the sick and wounded.\" After the fall of Donoobew, Captain Alexander was joined by Lieutenants James Wilkinson and the Hon. George John Cavendish, with the boats of the Liffey and Tees, which ships had recently arrived at Rangoon. On the night of the 3d April, Sir Archibald Campbell re commenced his march towards Prome, one of the largest towns in the Burman empire, celebrated as the scene of many long sieges and bloody conflicts, and the occupation of which was the grand object of that year's campaign \u2014 \" a * Lieutenants Smith, Keele, Kellett, and Bazely; acting Lieutenant Hall ; Mr. Reed, master's-mate ; and Messrs.

The passage by water from Donoobew to Prome was excessively tedious and fatiguing, owing to calms and the strength of the current ; the flotilla, however, maintained a communication with Sir Archibald Campbell ; and on the 19th Captain Alexander sent him an elderly man, the bearer of a pacific communication from the chiefs of the Burman army. \" An answer was returned, expressive of the readi ness of the Supreme Government to conclude a peace, and that upon the arrival of the combined force at Prome, every opportunity and facility in opening negociations would be afforded f.\" On the 24th, Sir Archibald arrived with the head of his column in the neighbourhood of Shudaung-mew, formerly the frontier fortress of the kingdom of Pegu, and concerted measures with Captain Alexander for attacking Prome on the following day. The enemy, however, did not await his advance, but retired during the night, apparently in the greatest confusion. Next morning, the place was occupied without the necessity of firing a shot. It proved to be a position of great strength, from its natural defences of high hills, each crowned with a strong pagoda, and fortified to the \u2022 Sir Archibald Campbell's official despatch of April 9, 1&25. t Saodgrass, 179."], [93, "83 DURING THE BURMESE WAR. very summit ; there were 101 guns mounted in the different stockades, all of which %vere new, and must have cost the enemy immense labour in the construction. Extensive and \u25a0well-filled granaries, a considerable quantity of ammunition, and many boats of different descriptions were found there. The command of the lower provinces, acquired by this cap ture, inspired the population of the surrounding country with confidence ; chiefs of towns and villages sued for passes of protection ; the inhabitants of Prome soon resumed their usual avocations ; markets were formed along the river ; and the resources of the country began to be fully available both for carriage and support. After the occupation of Prome, Captain Chads was sent, with part of the flotilla, to Rangoon for supplies ; and the light division, under Lieutenant Wilkinson, was despatched up the river, as far as Napadee, to reconnoitre. On the 1st May, the latter officer returned, having succeeded, after a long chase, in capturing eight war-boats, pulling from fifty to sixty oars each, and another, laden with guns, jingals, and spears. This service was rjerformed without any loss, under a heavy fire from 500 musketeers and 50 horsemen, part of the force commanded by the Prince of Sarrawaddy, who was then retreating direct upon the capital, burning and laying waste the villages on his route, destroying all the grain within his reach, and driving thousands of helpless inoffensive people from their houses to the woods. \" The capture of these war-boats,\" says Captain Alexander, \" liberated 3,000 canoes, &c. with families they were driving before them ; and all the people claimed protection, and returned with Lieutenant Wil kinson. The boats got up to Meaday, a distance of about 50 miles,\" where they met Lieutenant-Colonel Godwin, who had been detached in command of all the flank companies, for the purpose of scouring the country ; \u2014 \" at some of the rapids they did not pull a boat's length in an hour.\" On the follow ing day, Sir Archibald Campbell wrote to Mr. Secretary Swin ton as follows : \u2014 \" It affords me the greatest pleasure to forward another instance of the zeal and judgment with which Captain Alexander, commanding the G 2"], [94, "84 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, flotilla, has uniformly co-operated with me on this service, and another proof if any such be wanting, of the gallantry, spirit, and enterprise dis played on all occasions by that part of H. M. navy serving on this expe dition. * * * The guns taken by the light division of boats, are, no doubt, part of those intended for the defence of this place.\" About this period, Captain Ryves was invalided; and Lieutenant Edward Blanckley, of the Alligator, appointed acting commander of the Sophie ; which sloop, we believe, took her final leave of Rangoon towards the end of the fol lowing month. Early in May, the Hon. Company's gun-vessels Sophia and Swift, the former loaded with provisions, the latter with ordnance and stores, foundered in a heavy squall, by which disaster one soldier and a camp follower perished. The temporary repose enjoyed in the cantonments at Prome was, in the early part of the wet-season, enlivened by the accounts received of the success of Major Sale and Captain Marryat, whose departure from Rangoon, on an ex pedition against Bassein, we have mentioned at page 71 : the following is an outline of their proceedings. After a tedious passage, the Larne and her consorts arrived off Great Negrais, at the entrance of the Bassein river, on the 24th February ; the next day, her boats, under Lieute nant Fraser, were sent in to reconnoitre and sound the pas sage, in the execution of which service they received a harm less fire from two stockades, apparently full of men, and distant about a mile from each other. On the 26th, at day light, the armament weighed and stood in ; the Mercury cruiser, on account of her light draught of water, taking the lead *. At noon, the first stockade commenced firing ; and shortly afterwards the Larne and the Mercury took their positions within 100 yards : the enemy soon fled, and the troops landed and occupied the work. The second stock ade was taken in the same manner, without loss ; both of them were burnt, and two 9 pounders, six sixes, two large \u2022 She was then commanded by Lieutenant Drummond Anderson."], [95, "85 DURING THE BURMESE WAR. wooden guns, and thirty- four jingals, either brought off or destroyed. On the following morning, the Larne, Mercury, and Argyle transport, weighed and ran past four deserted stockades, three of which stood in commanding situations on the island of Negrais. Continuing their course with a fair wind, they anchored, at dark, about 35 miles above the entrance of the river. From this point, the stream being very narrow, and the wind blowing strong down every reach, the ascent be came extremely arduous ; the ships often getting on shore, towing and warping day and night, till the evening of the 3d March, when they anchored about three miles below the still smoking ruins of Bassein. During their passage thither, the British commanders received information, that the head person of Bassein had superintended the partial defence of the stockades at the en trance of the river ; that upon his return after their capture, he found himself opposed by a strong party amicably inclined towards the British ; and that a contest ensued, the result of which was the destruction of the town, and the flight of the chief with about 200 followers, to Lamina, nearly 140 miles distant. This intelligence proving correct, Major Sale landed his troops on the evening of the 3d, and took post in the area of the principal pagoda, a strongly fortified and commanding position. He subsequently made a reconnoi sance as far as Lamina, with 300 troops and 70 seamen, pro ceeding up the river in boats, and bivouacking at night upon the banks. The fugitive chief was but a short distance a-head, and the detachment was repeatedly upon the eve of overtaking him ; he contrived, however, to escape. All the villages on the banks of the river were deserted, and the population driven into the interior by the retreating Burman force. Lamina also, although a place of great extent, was found abandoned ; and as no resources, therefore, were avail able for the support, or the further progress of the detach ment, Major Sale returned to Bassein on the 23d, bringing with him a state barge and several war canoes. During the expedition, two men were wounded by musketry from the"], [96, "86 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, jungle, five died from fatigue and privation, and many others became incapable of service. On the 26th of March, the Larne weighed and dropped down to Naputtah, a considerable village which had accepted British protection. On the 27th, Captain Marryat received information, that the guns belonging to the deserted stock ades were at the town of Thingang, situated up a branch of the river leading to Rangoon ; that 150 Naputtah men were detained there, to be forwarded to Donoobew ; and that the enemy's force consisted of 800 men. On the morning of the 28th, Captain Marryat proceeded against Thingang, at the head of fifty seamen and marines, twelve sepoys, and fifty villagers whom he had prevailed upon to fight against the Burmese, and armed with swords and spears. At 3 p. m., while forming for the attack, a canoe came off, with intelligence that the enemy did not wish to fight, and would submit to his terms : these were, that all arms should be surrendered, the Naputtah men to be pro vided with canoes to return to their homes, and the Wongee of the town placed at his disposal. This personage being one of Bandoola's principal chiefs, who had commanded 1000 men at the attack of Rangoon, and been invested with the gold chattah, was brought away as a prisoner. On the night of the 30th, the same force was sent, under Lieutenant Fraser, to surprise the village of Pumkayi, where the enemy were stated to be 300 strong, and commanded by another gold chattah chief. The attack was successful ; the Burmese submitted to the same terms as at Thingang ; and the Wongee, who had fled into the jungle, was followed and taken by the Naputtah men, who, in consequence of their former good conduct, were now entrusted with muskets. A party of 100 men, the only force that remained between Negrais and Bassein, subsequently sent in their submission. Previous to their separation, Captain Marryat received Major Sale's \" sincere thanks for his valuable and cordial co operation .\" The conduct of Lieutenant Fraser, Mr. Atherton, and Messrs. Dewes and Norcock, midshipmen, was reported to Captain Alexander in terms of high commendation."], [97, "DURING THE BURMESE WAR. 87 By the annexation of Bassein to the other conquered pro vinces, the enemy was deprived of all his maritime possessions from Cape Negrais to Tenasserim. By referring to the map of the Burman empire, the reader will perceive, by the relative posi tions of the Irrawaddy and the Bassein river, the important re sults accruing from Captain Marryat's plan of operations. Do noobew received considerable supplies of men from this delta, and a chain of communication was kept up by a line of chiefs from Negrais to Lamina, who supported the operations and plans of Maha Bandoola. Major Sale was not only unable, as we have already shewn, either to form a junction with the water column, under Brigadier-General Cotton, near Donoobew ; or to open a communication with Sir A. Campbell, higher up the river ; but was actually obliged to fortify himself at Bassein. Captain Marryat, however, partly by bribes and partly by force, suc ceeded in bringing most of the chiefs to submission ; and by his prevailing upon the Burmese to fight against their countrymen who still adhered to Bandoola, the chain was completely un linked. Had this not been achieved, a large army would, not withstanding Bandoola's death, have been collected in the rear of Sir A. Campbell, to cut off his supplies ; and the expedition to Ava might have proved as unfortunate as it was ultimately successful. This service was effected by Captain Marryat after the return of the force which he had sent to Lamina under Major Sale, and at a time too when the Larne had not more than forty efficient men. It was, perhaps, the greatest instance of achieving much with small means, which occurred during the whole war : nor should we omit to observe, that Captain Marryat incurred the greatest personal risk in going ashore unarmed, among thousands of Burmese, who, had they been treacherous, would have soon put an end to him. Captain Marryat assumed the command of the Tees, at Ran goon, April 15th, 1825 ; and finally left that river about the middle of May. It is almost superfluous to add, that he was repeatedly thanked for his valuable services in Ava, every opera tion which he had arranged or conducted having proved emi nently successful. At Prome, the ensuing three months were necessarily spent in inactivity, from the setting in of the rains, and the prevalence of the inundations. The monsoon, however, proved mild; the"], [98, "NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, 88 troops and seamen were comfortably hutted ; there was no want of provisions ; and, although extensive sickness occurred, it was not more than was fairly attributable to the nature of the ser vice and the season of the year. The only men-of-war remaining stationary at Rangoon, were the Alligator and Arachne ; both of them unrigged, and roofed in with bamboos thatched with leaves, which proved a great saving of lives and stores. The duties of the naval department there were conducted by Captain Chads, with his usual ability and zeal. Two divisions of gun-boats, armed with 24-pounder carronades, having arrived from Arra can, and got into the Irrawaddy by the way of Bassein, all the gun-vessels were now stationed at regular distances, so as to form a chain of posts up to Prome, for the protection of boats proceeding thither with provisions, (Sic. to form a depdt for the ensuing campaign. In compliance with the repeated injunctions of the Supreme Government, that no opportunity should be omitted of entering upon pacific negociations, Sir A. Campbell judged it expedient, as the season for active operations approached, to address a let ter to the Court of Ava, declaratory of his being authorised, and desirous, to abstain from further hostilities. The enemy, at this time, were making great exertions to collect a large force, which, as it was formed, advanced to positions approaching the British cantonments : the whole force in motion, in the begin ning of August, was estimated at 40,000 men, under the com mand of Memia-boo, a half brother of the king, besides 12,000 at Tonghoo, under his eldest brother. To oppose them, and to garrison Prome, Sir A. Campbell had, at that place, 6,148 effec tive officers and men, and had ordered 2,148 to join him from Rangoon and Donoobew, in time for the opening of the campaign. On hearing of the advance of the Burman army, Sir A. Camp bell despatched Brigadier-General Cotton, in the Diana, with fifty soldiers and several gun-boats, to reconnoitre. The enemy was discovered on the morning of the 15th Aug., at Meaday, once a town of considerable importance, on the left bank of the river. A large nullah runs into the Irrawaddy immediately below that place, from the mouth of which the enemy's force was ranged to the extent of a mile and a half upon the bank of the main stream. This bank had several pago das upon it, near the nullah, all of which the Burmese had"], [99, "89 DURING THE BURMESE WAR. entrenched and were stockading ; they had also thrown a ditch and breast-work between them and the river, to pro tect their boats, which were ranged underneath. During the progress of the reconnoitring party along their line of defence, the enemy opened a battery of sixteen guns, from 4 to 6-pounders, upon the steam-vessel ; but the width of the river being at least 1,500 yards, their shot fell short. The force displayed by the Burmese was estimated at be tween 16,000 and 20,000 men, -who appeared to be all armed with muskets ; and twenty golden chattahs were counted. They had also a small force on the right bank, with jingals, opposite to the right of their line, as it faced the river. On the return of the party, the gun-boats, under Captain Alex ander, cannonaded the enemy's line, to make them develope their whole force ; and it was then ascertained, that they had an advanced party across the nullah, already mentioned, thrown on the road leading to Prome, and employed in stock ading some pagodas which overlook it. This party were working likewise on a breast-work on the side of the hill, which would also command the road : three golden chattahs were visible with the latter force. On the 6th September, exactly a month after the date of Sir Archibald Campbell's letter to the Court of Ava, a war boat, under a flag of truce, presented itself at the British advanced post on the river, having on board two Burman deputies and ten or twelve followers. Upon being conducted to head-quarters, and all seated, Sir Archibald Campbell asked to what circumstance he owed the honor of their visit ? The leader of the deputation then delivered a letter in great form, and said, that he was acquainted with its contents, and instructed to communicate verbally many good words on the benefit that would accrue to both countries on the restoration of peace, which they understood the British were anxious for. Sir Archibald replied, that they were rightly informed, as the desire of his government was to be on terms of peace and cordiality with all its neighbours, and he made no doubt, if the feeling was mutual, that that most desirable event would soon be brought about. They then declared that such was their most earnest desire."], [100, "90 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, The deputies next asked if Sir Archibald would, in return to their being sent to him, allow two British officers to visit their commander-in-chief; adding, that such a measure would be received as an esteemed mark of his confidence in them, and a pledge of his government wishing to return to terms of peace : Sir Archibald answered, that he would, with the great est pleasure and confidence, comply with their request ; or, if it would be more acceptable, that he would meet their Prince and his party at any central place that might be pointed out betwixt the two armies. They, however, preferred the former. \" I therefore,\" says Sir Archibald Campbell, \" se lected for that complimentary mission, Lieutenant-Colonel Tidy, my Deputy-Adjutant-General ; and Captain Alexander, who was present at the conference, proposed Lieutenant Smith, of H. M. S. Alligator, to accompany him \u2014 two of ficers of conciliating manners, and much firmness of charac ter. They were accompanied, at my special request, by the Armenian merchant Mr. Sarkies Manook, as interpreter, a man well known and respected at the court of Ava, and one who has been of much service to me, since the opening of the last campaign.\" Lieutenant-Colonel Tidy and his naval colleague were met, when within about five miles of Meaday, by six war-boats, each carrying a chief of 500 men, with bands of music and singers. On arriving at a jetty, built expressly for their ac commodation, several chiefs of a much higher rank came into their boat, and at one time they counted ten with golden chattahs, six of whom carried golden swords and drinking cups. On landing, they were conducted, by two chiefs still higher in rank, and followed by the others, with much cere mony, through a guard of about 2,000 musketeers, to a com modious house, built the same day, for their reception . On the morning of the 11th, the British envoys were vi sited by the late governors of Prome and Sarrawaddy, who complimented them in the name of the Kee-Wongee, second in command of the Burman forces, and assured them of his anxiety to conclude a pacific treaty ; but requested them not to urge immediate negociation, as it would be necessary to receive instructions from Prince Memia-boo, whose head-"], [101, "DURING THE BURMESE WAR. 91 quarters were at Melloone. On the 14th, they had an in terview with the Kee-Wongee, and on the 16th, it was inti mated to them, that he had obtained full powers from his Court, and would be ready to receive them, at their own hour, the next day. On the 17th, they accordingly pro ceeded, in great state, to the house of audience, where it was settled, that the Burman minister and another person of rank should meet Sir Archibald Campbell half way between the two armies, at a village named Neoun-ben-zeik, to enter into negociations for the re-establishment of peace and amity ; the terms of an armistice were also agreed upon, by which it was stipulated that there should be a cessation of hostilities till the 17th of October; the line of demarcation was drawn from Comma, on the western bank of the Irra waddy, through Neoun-ben-zeik to Tonghoo ; and the armi stice included all the belligerent troops on the frontiers in other parts of the dominions of Ava, none of whom were to be allowed to make a forward movement before the 18th of October. On the 22nd September, Sir James Brisbane, Knt. & C. B. who had been appointed to succeed Commodore Grant in the command of H. M. squadron in India, arrived at Prome, bringing with him the boats and seamen of the Boadicea fri gate. On the 30th, Sir Archibald Campbell proceeded to Neoun-ben-zeik, accompanied by the naval commander-in chief, whom he had requested to act as joint commissioner. The ground was found prepared for the encampment of the respective negociators, and a Lotoo, or house of conference, erected in the intermediate space, equi-distant from the British and the Burman guards. On the 2nd October, two officers of rank arrived from the opposite side to conduct Sir Archibald Campbell to the Lotoo ; Lieutenant-Colonel Francis Skelly Tidy and Lieutenant Smith were despatched at the same time to pay a similar compliment to the Kee- Wongee. After all the commissioners, with their respective suites, were seated, Sir Archibald opened the conference with an appropriate address to the Burman chiefs, who re plied in courteous and suitable terms, and expressed their"], [102, "92 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, hope that the first day of their acquaintance might be given up to private friendship, and the consideration of public business deferred until the next meeting. This was assented to, and a desultory conversation then ensued ; in the course of which, the Burmese conducted themselves in the most polite and conciliatory manner, enquiring after the latest news from England, the state of the King's health, and si milar topics, and offering to accompany Sir Archibald Camp bell to Rangoon, or wherever he might propose. On the ensuing day, another meeting took place, at which Sir Archibald Campbell, Sir James Brisbane, Brigadier-Ge neral Cotton, Captain Alexander, R. N., Brigadier M'Creagh, Lieutenant-Colonel Tidy, and Captain John James Snod grass (military secretary and aid-de-camp to Sir Archibald) \u00bb were the only British officers present; the Kee-Wongee having requested that no more than six chiefs on each side should take part in the discussions. The principal conditions of peace proposed by Sir Archi bald Campbell, were the non-interference of the Court of Ava with the territories of Cachar, Munnipoore, and Assam ; the cession of the four provinces of Arracan, and the payment of a certain sum, as an indemnification for the expences of the war ; one moiety to be paid immediately, and the Tenasserini provinces to be retained until the liquidation of the other. The Court of Ava was also expected to receive a British re sident at the capital, and consent to a commercial treaty, upon principles of liberal intercourse and mutual advantages . In the discussion of these stipulations, it was evident, notwithstanding the moderate tones of the Burman deputies, and their evident desire for the termination of the war, that the Court was not yet reduced to a full sense of its infe riority, nor prepared to make any sacrifice, either territorial or pecuniary, for the restoration of tranquillity. The pro tection given to fugitives from the Burman territories was urged in excuse for the conduct of the Court, although the actual occurrences of the war was attributed to the malignant designs of evil counsellors, who had misrepresented the real state of tilings, and suppressed the remonstrances addressed"], [103, "DURING THE BURMESE WAR. 93 by the government of India to that of Ava, \u2014 thus virtually acknowledging the moderation of the British authorities. It was also pleaded, that in the interruption of trade, and the loss of revenue, the Court of Ava had already suffered suffi ciently by the war, and that it became a great nation like the British, to be content with the vindication of its name and reputation, and that they could not possibly be less generous than the Chinese, who, on a former occasion, having con quered part of the Burman territory, restored it on the return of peace. To this it was replied, that the Chinese were the vanquished, not the victors ; whilst the British were in posses sion of half the kingdom, the most valuable portion of which they were still willing to relinquish ; but that, as the war had been wholly unprovoked on their part, they were fully en titled to expect such concessions in territory and money, as should reimburse them in the expence they had incurred, and enable them to guard more effectually against any future collision. The manner in which these points were urged, satisfying the Kee-Wongee, &c. of the firmness of the British commissioners, they, at last, waved all further objections, and confined themselves to requesting a prolongation of the armistice till the 2d of November, in order that they might put the court fully in possession of the views of the British negociators, and be empowered to give them a definitive reply. This request was readily acceded to, as, from the continued wetness of the ground, Sir Archibald Campbell found he could not move with comfort to his troops before, perhaps, the middle of November. On the representation of Sir Archibald Campbell, the Kee-Wongee pledged himself, that all British and American subjects detained at Ava, \" under the Golden Feet,\" should immediately be set at liberty ; in return for which, the British were to liberate the whole of the Burmese then confined in Bengal.* * Among the detenus at Ava were two American missionaries, who re mained in close confinement for the space of fifteen months, loaded occa sionally with heavy chains. It may be thought incredible, but these gen tlemen declared that the principal cause of their detention was their having"], [104, "94 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA,' The notion of treating upon a perfect equality, which evi- dently pervaded the recent negociations on the part of the Burman commissioners, and which probably originated not only in the haughtiness of the Court of Ava, but in an impres- sion entertained by it, to which the acknowledged anxiety of the British authorities for peace had given rise, that they were unable or disinclined to carry on the war, rendered the ultimate result of the conferences at Neoun-ben-zeik little problematical, and arrangements for resuming hostile opera- tions were actively pursued. Their necessity was soon evinced. The Court of Ava, indignant at the idea of ceding an inch of territory, or submitting to what, in oriental poli- tics, is held a mark of excessive humiliation, payment of any pecuniary indemnification, breathed nothing but defiance, and determined instantly to prosecute the war. In the short interval that ensued before hostilities were renewed, Sir Archibald Campbell addressed the Kee-Wongee, relative to the prisoners, whose liberation was refused on the plea of British troops having moved by way of Negrais to Rangoon ; and in reply to his enquiry, as to the probable termination of the truce, it was intimated, that the demand for any ces- sion of money or territory precluded all possibility of a re newal of friendly intercourse. Nothing remained, therefore but a further appeal to arms. white faces ; and as they spoke the same language as the English, the Burmese would not believe that they were subjects of any other country."], [105, "DURING THE BURMESE WAR. 95 CHAPTER IV. One of the first acts of Sir James Brisbane, after his arrival at Prome, was to address the following order to Captain Chads, who had accompanied him thither from Rangoon. \"Whereas the important service of co-operating with the army engaged against the dominions of Ava requires the best exertions of all ranks, but more particularly of those who are acquainted with the service of warfare ; and as I have, with this view, made an accession, by the boats of the Boadicea, to the flotilla hitherto employed on the Irrawaddy, with the happiest results, I do hereby avail myself of your zeal, intelligence, and local knowledge, on which the highest eulogiums have been passed by the Supreme Government, in appointing you to command the light division of the said flotilla, under the immediate orders of Captain Alexander, who anticipates from your promptitude and resources the most effectual assistance, especially for maintaining that cordial union between the naval profession and all other departments, which is so essential to the success of the present expedition, and will be highly gratifying to me. \"Given under my hand, at Prome, on the Irrawaddy, this 24th day of September, 1825. (.Signed) \" Jas. Brisbane, Commodore. \" To H. D. Chads, Esq. Commander of H. M. S. Arachne, and a volunteer on the expedition against the dominions of Ava.\" On the 7th November, Captain Alexander died at Rangoon, and Captain Chads was immediately appointed his successor in the command of the Alligator ; but directed to remain with the flotilla in the Irrawaddy. A commission promoting him to the rank of Captain had been signed by the Admiralty on the 25th July preceding, and was conferred upon him in the most flattering and gratifying manner, their Lordships directing that he should not be superseded, but that the Arachne should be sent home. He did not hear of his pro motion, however, until after the termination of the Burmese"], [106, "96 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, war. The officer appointed by Sir James Brisbane, to succeed Captain Chads in the command of the Arachne, was Lieutenant John Francis Dawson, first of the Boadicea. On the 15th November, the Burmese having pushed for ward a division of troops to the village of Watty-goon, distant from Prome about 18 miles in a N. E. direction, and it appearing desirable that the columns of the British army should not be harassed and delayed at the very commence ment of their march, Sir Archibald Campbell directed Lieu tenant-Colonel Robert M'Dowall, of the Madras establish ment, to move forward with four regiments of native infantry, and dislodge the enemy from their posts. The result of this attempt was disastrous, owing to the very superior force of the Burmese, and the strength of their positions. Lieutenant-Colonel M'Dowall and 53 men were slain ; Major R. Lacy Evans, four captains, eight subalterns, and 110 men wounded; and 42 rank and file missing. Lieu tenant John C. Ranken, of the 43d regiment, subsequently died of his wounds. The ultimate consequences of this disaster were not unfa vorable, as it encouraged the Burman chiefs in the high opinion they were still inclined to entertain of their own power, and induced them to adopt a system of confident warfare, which brought them within the reach of the British commanders. Relying on the manifestation of their purpose to attack him in the position he then occupied, Sir Archibald Campbell determined to await their advance, and Prome was soon surrounded by upwards of 50,000 warriors. As their numbers enabled them to spread over a considerable tract of country, they detached parties past both flanks of the British position, by which the communication with Rangoon was threatened, and the districts below Prome, on both banks of the river, exposed to the depredation of ir regular and marauding bands. About this period, H. M. sloop Champion arrived at Rangoon, and her commander, John Fitz-Gerald Studdert, was entrusted with the charge of keeping the navigation open between that place and Prome."], [107, "97 DURING THE BURMESE WAR. Deeming it of importance to retain possession of Pa doung-mew, on the western bank of the river, Sir Archibald Campbell stationed 200 troops there, supported by a division of the flotilla, under Lieutenant Kellett. This party was re peatedly attacked by the enemy in great force, and the meri torious conduct of the officers and men of both services, obtained for them the high approbation of the commander-in chief. On the 25th Nov., Captain Charles Deane, of H. M. 1st regiment of foot, commanding the military detachment at Padoung-mew, reported as follows : \" A little before day-break, we had embarked twenty men of the Royals and thirty sepoys of the 26th Madras native infantry, intended to co-operate with Lieutenant-Colonel Godwin, on the opposite side of the river. They were just in the act of shoving off from the shore, when the enemy, to the amount of five or six thousand, made a rush at our works, howling most horribly, and at the same time setting fire to the village, which they had entered at all points. We had fortunately got an 18-pounder into the battery late yesterday evening, which, added to two twelves, already there, did great execution. \" Lieutenant Kellett, R. N. was at the moment shoving off with the row boats, but instantly returned to our assistance, with all his men, and kindly undertook the superintendence of the guns, the well-directed fire of which so mainly contributed to our success. The enemy, after nearly two hours sharp firing, retired in admirable order, carrying off great numbers of dead and wounded. I am happy to add, with the exception of one man slightly grazed in the elbow by a musket-shot, we have not a man either killed or wounded. The guns in the boats were of the greatest assistance in scouring the village with their grape.\" Respecting the defence of Padoung-mew, Major Snod grass merely says, \u2014 \" The centre of the Burmese army was now distinctly seen from Prome, stockading and fortifying the heights of Napadee above the river. The corps of Sudda Woon was also seen actively employed in a similar duty on the opposite bank, while a strong detachment was pushed forward for the purpose of occupying Padoung-mew, a town situated on the west side of the Irrawaddy, about ten miles below Prome : in this measure, however, they were antici pated by the British general, the place being already in pos session of a party of our troops, which subsequently baffled every attempt of the enemy to drive them from it.\" Between this period and the 30th November, Lieutenant- n"], [108, "98 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, Colonel Godwin's detachment, and the flotilla, cleared the left bank of the river for fifteen miles below Prome. On the 27th, Thomas Campbell Robertson, Esq. Judge of Cawnpore, who had been appointed to the general superintendence of civil affairs in the conquered provinces, and to the conduct, jointly with Sir Archibald Campbell, of political intercourse with the Burman Court, arrived at head- quarters. On the 30th, measures were taken for making a general attack upon every accessible part of the enemy's line, extending, on the east bank of the Irrawaddy, from the commanding heights of Napadee, distant from Prome only five miles, to the village of Simbike, upon the Nawine river, distant eleven miles in a N. E. direction. The Burman army was divided into three corps. The left, commanded by Maha Nemiow, an old and experienced general, who had been sent to introduce a new system of conducting the war, was stockaded in the jungles at Simbike and Hyalay, amounting to 15,000 men, Burmese, Shans, and Cassayers, of which latter force 700 were cavalry. The centre, under the immediate orders of the Kee-Wongee, was strongly entrenched upon the Napadee ridge, inaccessible, except on one side by a narrow path way, commanded by seven pieces of artillery, while the na vigation of the river was commanded by several batteries of heavy ordnance. This corps consisted of 30,000 men, and the space between the left and centre, a thick and extensive forest, was occupied by a line of posts. The enemy's right, under the orders of Sudda Woon, occupied the west bank of the Irrawaddy, strongly stockaded, and defended by artillery. On the 1 st December, shortly after day-light, Sir James Brisbane, with the flotilla, commenced a heavy cannonade on the enemy's centre, and continued for nearly two hours to at tract his chief attention to that point, while the troops under Sir Archibald Campbell were marching out for the real at tack upon Maha Nemiow. At the same time, the 26th Madras native infantry advanced along the margin of the Irrawaddy, to drive in the Kee Wongee's advanced posts upon the main body. On reaching the village of Ze-ouke, the attacking force"], [109, "DURING THE BURMESE WAR. 99 was divided into two columns ; the right, under the com mand of Brigadier-General Cotton, continuing to march along the straight road leading to Simbike, and the other, ac companied by Sir Archibald Campbell, after fording the Na wine river, moving along its bank in a direction nearly parallel with the Brigadier- General's division. The route followed by the latter officer brought him in front of a succession of stock ades, which he at once assaulted and carried. In less than ten minutes the enemy was completely routed ; and Sir Archi bald had only an opportunity of cannonading his panic-struck masses as they rushed through the openings of the jungle before him, endeavouring to effect their escape. The enemy left 300 men dead upon the ground, with the whole of his commissariat and other stores, four guns, twelve jingals, more than four hundred muskets, a very considerable quantity of gunpowder, and upwards of 100 horses. The body of Maha Nemiow was found among the slain. The enemy's left corps thus disposed of, and finding, from the testimony of all the prisoners, that Meaday had been fixed upon as the point at which to re-unite in the event of any disaster, Sir Archibald Campbell immediately determined upon marching back to Ze-ouke, for the purpose of attacking the centre on the following day. At 6 p. m., the whole force was again assembled at Ze-ouke, after a harassing march of about twenty miles, which the troops underwent with the greatest cheerfulness and spirit. During the night, a mes sage was sent to Sir James Brisbane, requesting him to be in readiness to move forward with the flotilla, as soon as the troops were seen debouching from the jungle in front of Napadee. Early in the morning of the 2d, the army was again in motion, and many hours had not elapsed before the numerous stockades and breastworks upon that formidable and almost inaccessible ridge, were successively stormed and carried, the enemy flying from hill to hill, over extremely dangerous precipices, until the whole of the position, nearly three miles in extent, was taken. Previous to the assault, Sir James Brisbane cannonaded the heights from the river, and the land artillery also opened upon them with great h 2"], [110, "100 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, effect. During the attack by land, the flotilla pushed rapidly past the enemy's works, and succeeded in capturing nearly 300 boats, with five brass and iron guns, four hundred muskets, about a ton of gunpowder, and large quantities of shot, grain, and military stores, intended for the use of the Burman army. In a letter to the Admiralty, dated Dec. 3d, 1825, the Com modore says : \" I have much satisfaction in stating, that the whole of the officers and men employed in the flotilla conducted themselves throughout this service in a manner that reflects the highest credit on each individual, composed as this force is of various establishments. The officers of the Honourable Company's marine vied with those of the royal navy in gallantry and ex ertion. Captain Chads, of the Alligator, who commanded the light divi sion, displayed the same zeal, judgment, and intrepidity, which have characterised his conduct since the operations in this quarter began. I have, however, the painful duty of announcing the death of Captain Dawson, of the Arachne, whose high professional character had induced me so recently to promote him to the rank of Commander. The gallantry of this much lamented officer was conspicuous on all occasions ; inviting, by his example, the exertions of all under his directions, he fell just as success had crowned our efforts.\" On the following day, Sir Archibald Campbell, in a letter to Mr. Secretary Swinton, \" solicited the attention of the Governor-General in Council, to the judicious and cordial co-cperaiion afforded him by Commodore Sir James Bris bane, and the boats of H. M. squadron employed on this service.\" The defeat of the Burmese on the east bank of the Irra waddy was now most complete ; but the right corps of their army, under Sudda Woon, still occupied some high ground on the west bank, and measures were immediately taken for dislodging that division. This operation was performed on the morning of the 5th, by the troops under Brigadier-Gene ral Cotton, in conjunction with the flotilla, and attended with the most complete success ; the enemy left 300 men dead on the field, and dispersed in every direction. Five long guns, -me carronade, a number of jingals, and about 350 muskets, were taken. The British had only one man killed and four wounded. The totalloss sustained^y the armyonthe 1st, 2nd,"], [111, "101 DURING THE BURMESE WAR. and 5th Dec., was twenty-nine officers and men slain, one hun dred and thirty- three wounded, and one private missing. Bri gadier-General Cotton, in his report of the victory obtained over Sudda Woon, says to Sir Archibald Campbell, \" the operations of this day naturally connecting me with his Ma jesty's navy and the flotilla, I hope it will not be construed into presumption my venturing to bring to your Excellency's notice the ?nost cordial co-operation and valuable assistance I derived from his Excellency Commodore Sir James Bris bane, who directed, personally, the whole of the boats ichic/i cannonaded and cleared the advance of the troops, from their disembarking above their position to their entering the enemy's works.\" The beneficial results of this battle were immediately ap parent in the disappearance of the enemy's flanking parties, and the re-establishment of a free communication along the river ; but in order to realise all the advantages to which it was calculated to lead, Sir A. Campbell immediately ad vanced in pursuit of the retreating army. \" Aware that the Burmese had been long employed in fortifying the banks of the river, from Meaday to Paloh, it became an important consideration to endeavour to turn these positions, naturally strong, and extremely difficult of access. For this pur pose,\" says Sir Archibald, \" I determined to march upon Meaday, with one division by the route of Watty-goon, Seeyangoon, Seindoop, and Tonkindine, turning the posi tions as high as Bollay, while the column under Brigadier- General Cotton should march by the road of Neoun-ben zeik, nearly parallel with the river, and in communication with the flotilla, on board of which I had placed a force con sisting of H. M. royal regiment and details, commanded by Brigadier Richard Armstrong, to act in close and constant co-operation with the naval forces under Commodore Sir James Brisbane.\" From the rapidity of the current, and the numerous shift ing sand-banks, it became absolutely necessary to track or kedge the heavier boats along the banks of the river, until the flotilla reached Ycondoun, a military post, recently occupied"], [112, "102 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, by the \" royals.\" Proceeding up the Irrawaddy, Sir James Brisbane came in sight of Meong, where, by previous ar rangement, the flotilla formed a junction with Brigadier-Ge neral Cotton's division, for the purpose of attacking the enemy in his strong posts of Pettoh and Paloh. Brigadier Armstrong and the Commodore then made a reconnoissance, as a preliminary measure, and found, to their great surprise, that these important positions had been abandoned. In ad vancing up the river, it was impossible not to be struck with a degree of admiration at the happy choice of situation of the enemy's posts, aided as they were by the decided natural advantages which the face of the country presented : their extensive and formidable works could have been erected only by the manual labour of the masses of men at the command of a barbarous government. The channel of the river was, in many places, so narrow as to oblige the boats to pass within 200 yards of the banks, on the one side or the other : the destruction which the enemy might have caused, had they been so inclined, is self-evident. \" When I consider these advantages,\" says the Commodore, in a letter to Sir Archibald Campbell, \" I cannot imagine why the enemy should have so hastily relinquished them, unless the recent successes of your force, and the knowledge of your advance, had so far operated on their fears as to leave no hope of their retreat on your turning their positions.\" The total abandonment of the enemy's works enabled the flotilla to pass this excellent chain of field- defences, and to gain sight of Meaday on the afternoon of the 17th. Captain Chads was then sent to reconnoitre ; and he reported to Sir James Brisbane, that that formidable post had been evacu ated by the Kee-Wongee, as the advanced guard of the army made its appearance ; also that a war-boat, with three guns, had been captured, which, in the hurry of their retreat, the Burmese could not take with them. During this reconnois sance, the boats of the Arachne had two men killed and two wounded. Certain information of the enemy having rallied at Melloone, $ strongly fortified aud entrenched city, reached Sir Archi-"], [113, "DURING THE BURMESE WAR. 103 bald Campbell shortly after he began his march from Meaday; and it was at the same time stated, that a chief of rank had been sent up to Ava, after the defeats at Prome, for the pur pose of representing to \" the golden footed monarch,\" the hopeless state of his affairs, and the impossibility of the in vaders being arrested in their advance upon the capital of the empire, by any military arrangements. On the 2Gth De cember, these reports were confirmed by the arrival on board the Diana (which vessel Sir James Brisbane had made his head- quarters), of a messenger, under a flag of truce, commu nicating that Kolein Menghie had arrived at Melloone, de puted by the King of Ava, aud with full powers to conclude a treaty of peace. In answer to this message, Sir Archibald Campbell, in concurrence with Mr. Robertson, sent Lieu tenant-Colonel Tidy and Lieutenant Smith, R. N., to the Burmese camp, to ascertain what arrangement the envoy proposed making with them. A truce of twenty-five days was requested, and positively refused, the above offi cers being directed to say, as was afterwards communi cated in writing, that nothing beyond twenty-four hours would be given for the first meeting with the Burman depu ties, and that the truce was to be considered at an end as soon as the Lieutenant-Colonel and his naval colleague should have left the place. On reaching Melloone, on the morning of the 29th December, Sir Archibald found the place strongly occupied, and the river, on the enemy's side, covered with boats, which attempted to escape ; a few shot, fired over the headmost, shewed the determination of their hostile visitors to prevent it, and the attempt was given up. In the mean time, Sir Archibald Campbell received informa tion that the Diana was seen passing the enemy's works un molested, accompanied by two gilt war-boats ; and although the Burmese appeared throwing up entrenchments on the opposite shore, and marching and counter-marching, as if making preparations for defence, he accepted their forbear ance to the steam-vessel, as a proof of their sincerity and desire to treat. Hostilities here ceased, for the present,"], [114, "104 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, and, in the course of the same day, a correspondence com menced, and led to negociations which Sir Archibald hoped would render it unnecessary for him to write another military despatch upon the war in Ava. On the 3rd January, 1826, a letter, of which the following is a copy, was addressed to Sir James Brisbane, by the Su preme Government : \" Sir, \u2014 By the despatches received from Major-General Sir Archibald Campbell, announcing the highly gratifying intelligence of the success which has attended the British arms in the engagements with the enemy on the 1st, 2d, aud 5th ultimo, we are apprised that the boats of H. M. squadron and the Hon. Company's flotilla, under the personal directions of your Excellency, bore a distinguished share in the operations of those days, and, acting in conjunction with the land forces, afforded most im portant aid and support, the value of which is acknowledged by Sir A. Campbell in the warmest terms. \" We desire to avail ourselves of this occasion to express our high sense of that zeal for promotion of the public interests, which has distinguished all your Excellency's proceedings, since you first assumed the chief naval command in these seas, and which induced you lo repair in person to Prome, with a view to the more effectual direction and superintendence of the river part of the service in the enemy's country. The beneficial effects of your Excellency's presence have been strikingly manifested, in the suc cess which has attended the late combined attack on the Burmese positions, as well as in the uniform spirit of harmony, cordiality, and gallant devotion prevailing in both services. \" It is to us a source of high gratification to learn from your communi cation to Major-General Sir Archibald Campbell, that the conduct of the officers and men of the flotilla belonging to the H. C. has merited and received your approbation. \"Of the zealous and important services which the officers of the royal navy have performed in conjunction with the land forces employed in Ava, we have repeatedly signified our warmest acknowledgments, and we gladly seize this opportunity of renewing the expression of them to your Excel lency, as the naval commander-in-chief.

The Commodore will long remember, with feelings of the highest gratifi cation, the period which he has commanded this branch of the expedition, and the personal acquaintance it has afforded him with individual merit. \" The Commodore begs the officers, without distinction, to be as sured that he has brought under the notice of their superiors, his opinion of their merit, and the brave men who have served with them, giving as they have the most striking examples of activity and exertions, under the greatest privations in open boats. \" Although it is not the province of the Commodore to eulogize the enthusiastic gallantry displayed by the military part of the force employed in the late operations, he cannot avoid expressing his admiration of those soldierlike qualities when embarked, which are indispensable in combined operations. \"The selection of Brigadier Armstrong to command the water column, and the well earned character of H. M. Royal regiment, were most eminently calculated to ensure that hearty unanimity which has been fully manifested. \" The good conduct of the native seamen in the H.

(Signed) \"James Brisbane.\" .\" To Captain Chads, of H. M. S. Alligator, and the officers of all descriptions employed under the command of Commodore Sir James Brisbane against the Dominions of Ava.\" There were at this time, 56 of the Honorable Company's gun-vessels and row-boats, forming five divisions, the whole under the immediate controul of Sir James Brisbane. The officers of that service, attached to this flotilla, and particu larly recommended by the Commodore, were \u2014 Lieutenants Joseph H. Rouband and George Laughton (Bombay marine), Mr. William Lindquist (senior officer of the row-boats), and Messrs. Crawfurd, Ravenscroft, Robson, Power, Leggatt, and Cooper, all of the Bengal Pilot service. Lieutenant Michael Nagle, H. M. 47th regiment, was entrusted with the com mand of one of the divisions ; and Mr. George Winsor \"continued to render most essential service,\" as con ductor of the Diana. At this period, the walls of Ava had been recently erected, and as yet, not the slightest appear ance of a rampart, or a support of any kind on the inner side, was visible, without which, in the event of a siege, they possessed no stability. After affixing his signature to a treaty of peace, Sir James Brisbane was compelled, in consequence of extreme indispo sition, to retire to Pulo-Penang; and, we lament to say, that that highly distinguished officer never recovered from the effects of the disease he had contracted on the Irrawaddy. The Boadicea's boats, however, were not withdrawn from the flotilla, the chief command of which again devolved upon Captain Chads. Sir James Brisbane died at New South Wales, Dec. 19, 1826. He was then about to proceed to the west coast of South America, with his broad pendant on board the Warspite 76, to which ship he had removed it on his being superseded in the East India command, by Rear- Admiral Gage, about the middle of August, 1826."], [117, "DURING TUB BURMESE WAR. 107 CHAPTER V. It was with extreme regret that Sir Archibald Campbell and Mr. Robertson reported, for the information of the Governor-General in Council, that the treaty concluded at Melloone, on the 3d January, 1826, not having been ratified by the King of Ava, and none of the stipulations having, within the prescribed period, been fulfilled, all amicable intercourse with the authorities at that place was necessa rily broken off, and war renewed on the morning of the 19th. On the 18th, the day appointed for the return of the ratified treaty, &c. the commander-in-chief and civil com missioner finding that, instead of a fulfilment of this promise, a further delay of six or seven days was solicited, under such equivocal circumstances as left no doubt that a total want of faith guided the Burman councils, it was definitively de clared to the deputies, that their request could not be complied with, and an article proposed to them, in which it was stipulated, (together with the performance of others already agreed to), that they should evacuate Melloone, by sun-rise, on the morning of the 20th. On their positive rejection of this proposition, they were told, that after twelve o'clock, that very night (the 18th), hostilities would re-commence. Deeming it of the utmost importance that no time should be lost in punishing duplicity of so flagrant a character, Sir Archibald Campbell ordered the construction of batteries, and the landing of heavy ordnance from the flotilla, to commence immediately after midnight, and every requisite arrangement to be made for an early attack upon Melloone, \" the defences of which place were represented as a"], [118, "108 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, chef-d'\u0153uvre of Burman fortification *.\" By ten o'clock the next morning, 28 pieces of ordnance were in battery, on points presenting a front of more than one mile on the east ern bank of the Irrawaddy, which corresponded with the enemy's line of defence on the opposite shore. The preceding night had been devoted by the enemy to preparations equally laborious, and the construction of extensive and well planned works, with a view to the resistance on which they had re solved. At 1 1 a. m., Sir Archibald ordered his batteries and rockets to open their fire, which was warmly kept up, and with such precision of practice as to reflect the highest credit o.i that branch of the service. During this period, the troops intended for the assault were embarking in the boats of H. M. ships, and part of the armed flotilla, at a point above the British encampment, un - der the superintendence and direction of Captain Chads. About 1 p. M., the desired impression having been pro duced by the cannonade, and every thing reported ready, Sir Archibald directed the above brigade, commanded by Lieute nant-Colonel R. H. Sale, to drop down the river, and assault the main face of the enemy's position, near its south-eastern angle ; and Brigadier-General Cotton's division to cross above Melloone, and, after carrying some outworks, to at tack the northern face of the principal work. Although the whole of the boats, &c. rowed off together from the left bank, the strength of the current, and a strong norther ly breeze, carried the gallant Sale's brigade to the given point of attack, before Brigadier-General Cotton's division, notwith standing every exertion, could reach the opposite shore. The Lieutenant-Colonel was unfortunately wounded in his boat ; but the troops having landed, and formed with admirable regularity, under the command of Major William Frith, of H. M. 38th regiment, rushed on to the assault with their usual intrepidity, and were, in a short time, complete masters of a work which had been rendered most formidable by la- * Snodgrass, 245."], [119, "109 DURING THE BURMESE WAR. bour and art, and was such as to afford the enemy a pre sumptive assurance of security in their possession of it. When Brigadier- General Cotton saw that the enemy's work was carried by the 13th and 38th regiments, he very judi ciously ordered a brigade, under Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Hunter Blair, of the 8/th foot, to cut in upon their line of retreat, which was done accordingly, and with much effect. Thus was accomplished, in the course of a few hours from the renewal of hostilities, forced upon the British by perfidy and duplicity, a chastisement as exemplary as it was merited. Specie to the amount of 30,0U0 rupees was found in Prince Memia -boo's house ; and a very ample magazine of grain, 76 guns, 90 jingals, 1700 muskets, 2000 spears, 18,000 round shot, a quantity of quilted and loose grape, 100,000 musket- balls, more than twenty tons of gunpowder, an im mense quantity of refined salt-petre and sulphur, upwards of a ton of unwrought iron, three gilt and fifteen common war-boats (all in good condition), eight large accommodation boats, forty-nine store-boats, from 200 to 300 canoes, and small boats of various descriptions, with about seventy horses, fell into the hands of the victors ; whose total loss did not exceed nine, including four Lascars, killed, and thirty-four, among whom were Major Frith, Lieutenant William Dick son, of the Bengal engineers, five men belonging to the Alli gator, and nine Lascars, wounded. \" To Captain Chads, of the royal navy, and every officer and seaman of H. M. ships,\" Sir Archibald Campbell again publicly acknowledged himself \"deeply indebted for the able and judicious manner in which the troops were transported to the points of attack ;\" and they were once more requested by him \" to accept the un feigned impression of his thankfulness.\" The men-of-war boats employed in the above attack were, the Boadicea's launch, commanded by Lieutenant William Smith; her pinnace, by Lieutenant Joseph Grote; her barge, by Mr. Clarke, gunner ; and her cutter, by Mr. Sy denham Wilde, midshipman : the Alligator's pinnace, by acting Lieutenant Valentine Pickey ; barge, by Mr. William"], [120, "110 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, Hayhurst Hall; and her two cutters, by Messrs. George Sumner Hand and George Wyke, midshipmen : lastly, the Arachne's pinnace, under Mr. Stephen Joshua Lett, with whom was associated Mr. William Coyde, midshipman. In a letter to Sir James Brisbane, dated Jan. 20, 1826, Captain Chads says : \u2014 \" I have the pleasure of assuring you, that the gallant good conduct of every individual, both of H. M. navy and the H. C. service, fully equalled that which you have yourself so lately witnessed and highly commended.\" On the 23rd January, a combined force, under Brigadier Armstrong and Captain Chads, destroyed an \u2022 evacuated stockade several miles above Melloone ; and next morning, these officers were joined by nearly 300 family canoes with merchandize, which, taking advantage of a fog, had escaped from the Burmese warriors, in the general confusion occa sioned by their late defeat. In less than three weeks after the capture of Melloone, the operations of the British, by land and water, had released from the tyranny of the enemy above 25,000 wretched inhabitants of the lower provinces, and not less than 4000 canoes, &c. which had been detained, and driven before the retiring army and flotilla, many of them ever since the commencement of the war. On the morning of the 24th, Captain Chads saw the remains of six poor creatures who had been crucified on the banks of the river, for attempting to escape from their oppressors. The laborious duty of collecting and destroying the cap tured stores and iron artillery, together with a heavy fall of rain, prevented Sir Archibald Campbell leaving Melloone before the 25th January ; at which period the navy had lost seven men, and forty-four were sick in the boats. On the 29th, Mr. William MfAuley, the only remaining medical gentleman attached to this arm of the service, was reported ill and delirious. On the 30th, one of the largest gun-boats struck upon a sand and bilged ; the remainder passed over a bar with only five feet water. On the 2nd February, Captain Chads anchored the Diana about two miles below Zaynan-"], [121, "111 DURING THE BURMESE WAR. gheoun (or the \"fetid oil brooks\"), where Sir Archibald Campbell had already established his head-quarters, in the immediate vicinity of the celebrated Petroleum wells. The light division of boats, under Lieutenant Smith, was then about ten miles in advance, employed in liberating numerous canoes, and in throwing his shot and shells amongst the enemy *. In the mean time, advices of the capture of Melloone reached the capital, and created the utmost consternation. In the uncertainty of the ultimate result of negociations for peace, the military operations were suffered to proceed ; but the Court of Ava determined to renew communications of a pacific tendency with the British commissioners. It was, however, no easy matter to find negociators in whom Sir Archibald Campbell and Mr. Robertson could now confide ; and the Burman officers of state were very reluctant to be sent upon what they considered a hopeless, if not a dangerous errand. In this dilemma, the Court applied to Doctor Price, one of the American missionaries then in confinement at Ava, and obtained his consent to be employed as an envoy to the British camp. In order, also, to amend the chance of success, Dr. R. Sandford, surgeon of the royals (who had been taken prisoner on his way down to Rangoon), was associated in the negociation, upon his parole of honor to return again to Ava. The commander of the Hon. Company's gun-vessel Phaeton -f and three British soldiers were, at the same time, restored to their liberty, as a compliment from the Court. The deputies reached head-quarters on the 31st of January, hnd, after conferring with the commissioners, returned to Ava on the following day. The astonishment excited in the capital by the re-appearance of Dr. Sandford is inconceivable. The ministers themselves declared that they never expected to \u00bb The Petroleum wells are scattered over an area of about sixteen square miles.

This was the only instance during the whole war, in which the Burmese departed from the cautious system of defence, be hind field-works and entrenchments, which forms their usual device of war. Relying on their great numerical superiority, and singular advantages of ground, they ventured on a suc cession of bold man\u0153uvres on the flanks and front of the in vaders ; \u2014 but this false confidence was rebuked by a reverse \u2014 \u2022 severe, signal, and disastrous. They left behind them many killed and wounded ; hundreds jumping into the river, to escape their assailants, perished in the water ; and, with the exception of from 2000 to 3000 men, the whole host dispersed upon the spot. Strange as it may appear, the British had only two men killed and missing, and one officer, fifteen men, and two horses wounded. The flotilla, from the great difficulties of the navigation, which daily increased, and the rapid movements of Sir Archibald Campbell, was not up to share in his success this day, and consequently sustained no loss, except what arose from the effects of climate, exposure, and fatigue. On the evening of the 12th February, Dr. Price was again despatched to the British camp, to signify the consent of the Burman Court to the terms of peace which had been"], [123, "113 DURING THE BURMESE WAR. stipulated in the treaty of Melloone ; to offer the immediate release of all the prisoners then at Ava, and the payment, in seven days time, of six lacs of rupees, as part of the indemni fication money demanded ; and to promise the delivery of nineteen lacs more (the remainder of the first instalment) on the return of the invaders to Prome. He was also in structed to solicit, that the army should not approach nearer to the capital than Pagahm-mew. Dr. Sandford, now set wholly at liberty, was allowed to accompany the envoy, and arrived in camp with him, at sun- set on the following day. Captain Chads, from his official situation, was requested by Sir Archibald Campbell to attend the ensuing conference, when it was unanimously resolved, that not less than twenty five lacs of rupees, on the spot, should be accepted, and that the advance of the army should be continued until the rati fication of the treaty, the prisoners, and the money, were brought to head- quarters. On the morning of the 14th, Dr. Price took his leave of the Commissioners, stating the cer tainty of his coming back in a day or two, accompanied by some of the Burman ministers, for the purpose of making a final and satisfactory settlement ; adding, that, as an ambas sador, he had only done his duty in endeavouring to prevail upon them to accept of the smaller sum. In the British camp and flotilla, it was generally considered and hoped, that the advance of the combined force, which was resumed on the 16th, would conduct it to the Burman capital. Previous to the departure of the flotilla from Pagahm-mew, Captain Chads was under the necessity of despatching a gun boat, commanded by Lieutenant Rouband, to Rangoon, with Messrs. Hall, Wyke, and Coyde ; Mr. Michael Nugent, as sistant-surgeon ; and eight seamen, all extremely ill. On the 17th Feb. he anchored, in the Diana, off Keeozie, and was there joined by Dr. Price with six war-boats, containing six lacs of rupees, and having on board Dr. Judson, (the other American missionary, sent from Ava as a mediator) ; twenty Burmans of rank ; Lieutenant Richard Bennett, of H. M. Royal regiment; Mr. Henry Gouger, a British merchant ; and 1"], [124, "114 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, thirty-five other prisoners*. On the 18th, the missionaries and war-boats returned to the capital, after making an ineffec tual attempt to induce Sir Archibald Campbell and his col leagues, then at Yebbang, to receive the money they had brought, and to wait ten days longer for the payment of the remainder. On the22d, they again made their appearance at Yandahoo, only forty -five miles from the capital, bringing with them twenty-five lacs in gold and silver bullion, and an assur ance that two ministers of state would speedily follow, in order to ratify the treaty. Captain Chads was now officially re quested to act as one of the Commissioners for the affairs of Ava and Pegu. On the 25th, he issued the following general .memorandum to the officers and men under his command: \u2014 \" I feel the highest gratification in announcing to the flotilla, that the unwearied exertions, gallantry, and zeal of the officers and every indivi dual composing it, have been crowned by honorable peace ; and on resigning the command of it, I beg to express my unfeigned thankfulness for the alacrity and cheerfulness with which this arduous service has been performed, and the personal attention which I have at all times experi enced will ever be remembered by me with most pleasing and grateful feelings. The flotilla is now to be at the disposal of Major Jackson, Deputy-Quarter-Master-General, and the officers will report to him.\" In a letter of the same date, addressed to Sir Archibald Campbell, Captain Chads strongly recommended Lieutenant George Laughton, of the Bombay marine, to the favorable notice of the Supreme Government; \"his conduct and ability on all occasions, from the very commencement of the war, having met with the constant approbation of his supe riors, and the esteem of all others.\" Among the officers of the flotilla, at this period, was Lieutenant Keele, who, al though in an admiral's barge, with extra rowers, and not withstanding every exertion and the greatest perseverance, had been no less than twenty-four days on his passage from Rangoon to Yandahoo \u2014 so great are the difficulties of as cending the Irrawaddy. * A narrative of the captivity of Lieutenaut (now Captain) Bennett, was published in the United Service Journal, Nos. vi. vii is. and xii."], [125, "115 DURING THE BURMESE WAR. By the treaty of peace, signed at 4 p. m. on the 24th Feb. 1826, the Honorable East India Company have obtained a large accession of most valuable territory, nearly equal to one-third of the whole Burman empire, affording an inex- haustible supply of the finest teak timber for naval purposes, and all the other productions of the East. They .have also derived from this treaty the still greater benefit of a state of security infinitely less likely to be disturbed than in former times, by the formidable barriers interposed between them and the kingdom of Ava ; and thus, not only is the pro- bability of future annoyance greatly diminished, but the chance of any successful irruption almost entirely removed. Besides renouncing all claims, and engaging to abstain from all future interference with the principality of Assam, and its dependencies, and also with the contiguous petty states of Cachar and Jynteea; to recognize Ghumbeer Singh as Rajah of Munnipoore (should he desire to return to that country) ; to cede in perpetuity the provinces of Arracan, recently conquered by the British, including the four divi- sions of Arracan, Ramree*, Cheduba, and Sandoway, (as divided from Ava by the Unnoupectowmien mountains), and also the provinces of Yeh, Tavoy, Mergui, and Tenasserim, with the islands and dependencies thereunto appertaining, (taking the Salucen, or Martaban river, as the line of demar cation on that frontier) ; to receive a British resident at Ava, and to depute a Burman minister to reside at Calcutta ; to abolish all exactions upon British ships or vessels in Burman ports, that are not required from Burman ships or vessels in British ports ; and to enter into a commercial treaty upon principles of reciprocal advantage ; the King of Ava, \" in proof of the sincere disposition of the Burman government to maintain the relations of peace and amity between the * The harbour of Kheauk-pheo, at the north end of the island of Ramree, is described as sufficiently large to accommodate the whole navy of Great Britain.

It should here be remarked, that nothing but the dread and certainty of the capture of their capital, and, with it, a large amount of treasure, would have induced the Burman government to accede to these terms ; \u2014 this, indeed, clearly appears evident, from the long protracted war, and their refusing to fulfil the treaty of Melloone. It was not till the 8th of March, that the army com menced its retrograde movement on Rangoon, at which place Captain Samuel Thornton, of the Slaney sloop of war, had been left by Captain Chads to carry on the naval duties. A sufficient number of boats were provided by the Burmese to convey thither the greatest part of the European troops, escorted by the men-of-war boats, under the command of Captain Studdert. The remainder of the British accompanied the native troops by land as far as Prome. By the early part of May, the whole force had returned to Rangoon, and some of the regiments immediately sailed for Calcutta and Madras. On the 11th April, 1826, the Governor-General in Council issued a proclamation and general order, of which latter, the following are extracts : \u2014 \"The relations of friendship between the British Government and the State of Ava, having been happily re-established by the conclusion of a definitive treaty of peace, the Governor-General in Council performs a most gratifying act of duty, in offering publicly his cordial acknowledg ments and thanks to Major-General Sir Archibald Campbell and the army in Ava, by whose gallant and persevering exertions the recent contest with the Burmese empire has been brought to an honorable and successful termination. \"In reviewing the events of the late war, the Governor-General in Council is bound to declare his conviction, that the achievements of the"], [127, "DURING THE BURMESE WAR. 117 British army in Ava have nobly sustained our military reputation, and have produced substantial benefit to the national interests. \" During a period of two years, from the first declaration of hostilities against the Government of Ava, every disadvantage of carrying on war in a distant and most difficult country, has been overcome,, and the collective force of the Burman empire, formidable from their numbers, the strength of their fortified positions, and the shelter afforded by the nature of their country, have been repeatedly assailed and defeated. The persevering and obstinate efforts of the enemy, to oppose our advance, having failed of success, and his resources and means of further resistance having been exhausted, the King of Ava has, at length, been compelled to accept of those terms of peace, which the near approach of our army to the gates of his capital enabled us to dictate. Every object, the Governor-General in Council is happy to proclaim, for which the war was undertaken, has been finally and most satisfactorily accomplished. *\u2022*\u00bb\u00bb\u2022 \"To the consummate military talents, energy, and decision manifested by Major-General Sir Archibald Campbell, to the ardour and devotion to the public service, which his example infused into all ranks, and to the confidence inspired by the success of every military operation which he planned and executed in person, the Governor-General in Council prima rily ascribes, under Providence, the brilliant result that has crowned the gallant and unwearied exertions of the British troops in Ava. Impressed with sentiments of high admiration for those eminent qualities so conspi ously and successfully displayed by Major-General Sir Archibald Campbell, his Lordship in Council rejoices in the opportunity of expressing to that distinguished soldier, in the most public manner, the acknowledgments and thanks of the Supreme Government, for the important service he ha3 rendered to the Honorable East India Company, and to the British nation. The thanks of Government are also eminently due to the senior officers, who have so ably and zealously seconded Major-General Sir Archibald Campbell in his career of victory. \u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\u2022 \" Amongst those zealous and gallant officers, some have been more fortunate than others in enjoying opportunities of performing special services. The ability with which Lieutenant-Colonel Godwin, of H. M. 41st, achieved the conquest of the fortified town of Martaban, and its dependencies, appears to confer on that officer a just claim to the separate and distinct acknowledgments of the Governor-General in Council. In like manner, Lieutenant-Colonel Miles and Brigadier-General M'Creagh have entitled themselves to the special thanks of Government for their services ; the former, in the capture of Tavoy and Mergui ; and the latter, in that of the island of Cheduba. \" The limits of a General Order necessarily preclude the Governor-Ge neral in Council from indulging the satisfaction of recording the names of all those officers whose services and exploits at this moment crowd upon"], [128, "] 18 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN AVA, the grateful recollection of the Government, by whom they were duly appreciated and acknowledged at the time of their occurrence. His Lord ship in Council requests that those officers will, collectively and indivi dually, accept this renewed assurance, that their meritorious exertions will ever be cordially remembered. * * * * \" \"The conduct of that portion of the naval branch of the expedition which belongs to the East India Company has been exemplary, and con spicuous for gallantry and indefatigable exertion; and it has fully shared in all the honorable toils and well-earned triumphs of the land force. * \u2022 \u2022 The Governor-General in Council has not overlooked the spirit aud bravery, characteristic of British seamen, manifested by several of the masters and officers of transports and armed vessels, in various actions with the Burmese in the vicinity of Rangoou. \"It belongs to a higher authority than the Government of India to notice, in adequate and appropriate terms, the services of His Majesty's squadron, which has co-operated with His Majesty's and the Honorable East India Company's land forces, in the late hostilities with the govern- ment of Ava. The Governor-General in Council, however, gladly seizes this opportunity of expressing the deep sense of obligation with which the Supreme Government acknowledges the important and essential aid af- forded by his Excellency Commodore Sir James Brisbane, in person, as well as by the officers, non-commissioned officers, seamen, and marines of H. M. ships, who have been employed in the Irrawaddy. Inspired by the most ardent zeal for the honor and interest of the nation and the East India Co;npany, his Excellency, the naval commander-in-chief, lost no time in proceeding, with the boats of the Boadicea, to the head-quarters of the British army at Prome, and directing, in person, the operations of the river force, rendered the most essential service in the various decisive and me- morable actions which, in the month of December last, compelled the Burmese to sue for peace.\" On the 12th April, 1826, the following letter was addressed to Captain Chads, then in Diamond harbour : \" Sir, \u2014 The Commissioners in Ava having reported the considerations which induced them to propose to you to be associated with them in set tling with the Burmese Commissioners the treaty of peace, I am directed by the Right Honorable the Governor-General in Council to express lo you the acknowledgments of Government for the readiness with which you complied with their wishes. \" The Governor-General in Council proposes to take an early oppor tunity of conveying to his Excellency the naval commander-in-chief the sense of obligation entertained by the Supreme Government for the essen tial aid rendered to the Honorable East India Company by the ships of His Majesty's navy serving in Ava; but, on the occasion of your arrival at this presidency, his Lordship in Council cannot deny himself the grati-"], [129, "119 DURING THE BURMESE WAR. fication of expressing to you the sentiments with which he is impressed towards yourself individually, as well with advertence to your services generally, as to the special one alluded to at the beginning of this letter.

From the foregoing detail, our readers will be enabled to appreciate the great importance of the services performed ; the sufferings and hardships they entailed on the army and navy; and the discipline, gallantry, and zeal necessary to attain success. They were sent into an enemy's country at the commencement of the rainy season, the longest, perhaps, that is experienced in any part of India ; and, during the whole of the first campaign, they had to encounter not only the danger consequent upon ordinary warfare, but privations and hardships almost unparalleled in either service. Scarcely had the deserted town of Rangoon fallen into the hands of the\" invaders, ere the country for many leagues around was completely devastated by the Burmese, so that it was im possible, for a very considerable period, to extract therefrom supplies even of the first necessity for the use of the hos pitals, which were unhappily too soon filled, from the sea men and troops being constantly exposed to the climate in a series of harassing duties, as well as from living on un wholesome salt provisions, thereby subjecting the remain der of the combined force to incessant duty. Bullocks were very seldom to be obtained for any money ; fresh provisions of every kind were almost equally scarce ; so much so, that a pound of mutton sometimes sold for five shillings, a duck for eighteen, a fowl for twenty, a pound of soft bread for two, butter for four, cheese for five, tea for twenty, a basket of potatoes (weighing about 130 Ibs.) for twenty, and a bottle of wine or spirits for ten shillings. Six months elapsed before any vegetables whatever could be procured ; animals for draught were equally inaccessible, and when a few ponies were captured they fetched nearly 100/. sterling per head. During the whole of the advance towards the capital, the seamen and troops suffered severely from the heat by day, r."], [138, "II and the heavy cold dews by night, which fell with all the violence of rain ; the thermometer ranging from 55\u00b0 in the morning to 110\u00b0 at noon. From this weather they had but very indifferent protection, the extremely limited means of conveyance, by land and water, only admitting the transport of a few tents for the Europeans, and provisions not more than sufficient for ten or twelve days ; \u2014 for future supplies they were compelled to trust to their being forwarded by the native canoes from Panlang. This latter circumstance, on some occasions created distress, and, at all times, ex treme anxiety of mind. The seamen on this advance, which lasted upwards of ay ear, never returnedto their ships; remain ing constantly by their boats, rowing and tracking by day against a rapid stream, and, except when cantoned with the troops at Prome, sleeping in them by night, protected from the inclemencies of the climate by their awnings only ; rarely meeting with a fresh meal, and, at one period, upwards of two months without so great a luxury; \u2014 still not a murmur was ever heard; \u2014 on the contrary, every service was per formed with the utmost alacrity and cheerfulness. It is also to be recollected, that the officers and men of the royal navy had to contend at once against the batteries on shore, the attacks of the Burmese war-boats, and the still more formidable danger of destruction from numerous fire rafts sent down the different rapid streams ; \u2014 whenever it became necessary to attack a stockade, seamen were obliged to direct and man the guns of the flotilla, the Lascars alledging, that they were told, when hired at Calcutta, that they were \" only to pull and not to fight ;\" \u2014 when troops were to be landed, the British sailors were likewise obliged to precede the Hon. Company's row-boats ; and only one battle was fought during the whole of the advance upon Ava, in ivhich the royal navy had not a full share. There was another circumstance which at all times placed the naval officers in an extremely painful and delicate situa tion, more particularly the senior Commander, and which arose from the endeavours of the Bengal Government to place the whole of the Honorable East India Company's"], [139, "( \"I ) marine force under the General, independent of his Majesty's naval officers. To such an extent did a Board of military officers, appointed by the Supreme Government, under the name of \" Embarkation Committee,\" wish to usurp the command, that it was only stopped by Captain Chads threatening to withdraw the men-of-war if such insults were offered to his Majesty's flag, and the following extract of a letter addressed by him to the senior naval officer in India shews the feeling that this conduct of the Bengal Govern ment excited: \u2014 \"I should wish to know,\" enquires he, \" how I am to proceed on these points so greatly at variance with the customs in similar instances, when expeditions are formed by his Majesty's Government, inasmuch as the royal navy can now hardly be considered a co-operating indepen dent force, but almost subservient to military officers of the Honorable East India Company, quite contrary to the high rank we have ever before held in India ?\" This may account for the little notice taken in Major Snodgrass's work, of the eminent services rendered to the expedition by his Majesty's naval officers, seamen, and marines ; and it may also have influenced the decision of the Bengal Government against them, in the distribution of extra batta since the termination of the war, which reward has been bestowed upon all their brethren in arms; and it is to be deeply lamented, that this decision has been not only confirmed by the Honorable Court of Directors in England, but acted upon in a further reward granted by them, as the documents in the Appendix will shew. i2"], [140, "APPENDIX.

This period to be calculated from the date of landing in the Burmese territory, until the final termination of hostilities, on the 24th February, 1826, or re-embarkation, whichever may have occurred first. \" To the officers and men of the Ava and Arracan forces, whose period of actual service within the Burmese territory falls short of Twelve Months, the Governor-General in Council is pleased to grant a Donation of Three Months Batta. \" His Lordship in Council is further pleased to grant the Donation of Six or Three Months Batta respectively, as the case may be, to such of the officers and men of the flotillas employed in the Irrawaddy, and on the coasts of Tenasserim and Arracan, as may not have drawn the Batta awarded by the Resolution of Government in the Secret Department, dated the 19th November, 1824.

This is not mentioned as a complaint, but to show that the resolution of Government ought not to be given as a reason for the present exclusion of the navy, as it under went, to the fullest extent, the same privations and expenses as the land forces and the flotilla, and of the latter it was certainly the right arm. t trust it will also be considered that the navy shared equally in the sacrifice of booty, that the capture of the capital would doubtless have afforded, and which was made to the political interests of the Honorable Company by the treaty of peace, by which both territory and a large sum of money were ceded to the Honorable Company.

N. fye. fye. fyo.\" Extracts of a Memorial, containing an outline of the conjunct oper- ations in Ava, presented by Captain Chads to the Lords Commis- sioners of His Majesty's Treasury, June \\7lh, 1828. \" On the part of the forces it is humbly submitted, that they have a strong claim to reward for their successful exertions, and the severe pri-"], [144, "VIII vations so patiently endured ; and they humbly look forward to His Ma jesty's gracious approbation and generous consideration. \" It has hitherto been impossible to detail the particulars of the ord nance, arms, stores, ammunition, grain, boats, and treasure, which were taken possession of by the different forces engaged during this arduous and destructive war, the greater part of which, from the nature of the warfare, it became absolutely necessary to destroy, to prevent the chance of their again falling into the hands of the enemy, and this was a measure indispensable to the success of the expedition. There was also a very considerable quantity of property taken, consisting principally of bells, some of immense weight, particularly one at Rangoon, which weighed several tons. Property of this description has been usually con sidered as prize or booty, and divisible amongst the captors ; the Govern ment of India, however, conceived that it would be more advantageous to their public interests to have these bells again replaced, and accordingly they were restored ; some of them, which had been sent to Calcutta, were for that purpose returned from thence. The whole of the property thus enumerated, which may strictly be denominated prize of war, may not exceed in value 300,000/., and the amount for actual captures lodged in the Company's treasury does not exceed 80,000/. The army have as yet received no other compensation for the extraordinary expenses occasioned hy the peculiar circumstances of this war, especially arising from the high price of provisions and all other necessaries, except an allowance of batta from the East India Company, and such allowance is no more than what had been usually given to other armies engaged in former wars in India. The navy have not been allowed even lo participate in such advantage, however inadequate ; and by them nothing whatever has been received since the termination of the war. \" The distribution of so small a sum of money as prize amongst the combined military and naval forces will afford a very inconsiderable reward to those who have succeeded in bringing this war to a successful termination. A war which at one time, from the obstinate resistance of the Burmese, and the numberless difficulties to be surmounted, was considered by those best aide to form a competent judgment, almost hopeless. It is to the judgment and perseverance of Sir Archibald Camp bell, and the courageous exercise of the discretion vested in him, by which he incurred a deep responsibility, supported by the ardent devotion of the combined forces to their duty, that the East India Company have reaped such ample advantages. Not less merit, it is to be observed, may be fairly attributed to that forbearance which was shewn in so exemplary a manner hy abstaining from continuing the advance upon Ava, when the spirit of the enemy was broken from repeated defeats, and when the conquest of the capital and the large booty therein contained, was certain. Strictly following the dictates of his duty, Sir Archibald Campbell consulted only the great political interests committed to his charge, and concluded a"], [145, "( IX) treaty which at once banished the hope entertained by the whole force, of realizing a rich reward for their toils, and which prospect had been so long before them \u2014 but this, his forbearance, secured to the East India Company not only a large accession of valuable territory, but also the payment of a million sterling in money \u2014 when such benefits have been derived from the exertions of the army and navy, they entertain an humble hope that they will not be left with the bare distribution of the value of that property which is strictly denominated prize, and the partial allow ance of extra batta to the land forces only, not sufficient to compensate the officers and men for the expenses by them necessarily incurred ; \u2014 they look forward with confidence, that your Lordships will recommend to His Majesty by his gracious interference to procure for them the money stipulated to be paid by the treaty, together with the prize property which has been acquired by such great sacrifices. \" Your Memorialist humbly prays, that His Majesty will be graciously pleased to grant these sums to be distributed in such manner as His Majesty may judge right from the peculiar nature and duration of the war ; and he further prays, on behalf of the officers and men of the royal navy, that His Majesty will also be graciously pleased to appoint Vice-Admiral the Right Honorable Sir George Cockburn, G. C.

Court of Directors to the Lords of His Majesty's Treasury : \u2014 \"East India House, 19th Feb. 182.9. \" Sir, \u2014 The Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the East India Com pany have communicated to the Court of Directors your letter dated 16th ultimo, with copy of a memorial addressed to the Lords of His Majesty's Treasury, by Captain Henry D. Chads, C. B., as senior officer of the royal navy at the termination of the Burmese war, and the Court having ex amined the representations and statements which Captain Chads has made, I am commanded to observe, that the Court are deeply sensible of the merits and services of tbe several officers and men who composed the marine part of the force employed in the late war ;\u2014 the opinion which the Court entertain upon that subject was embodied iu a unanimous resolu tion of the 24th Nov. 1826, of which the following is a copy :\u2014 \" ' Resolved unanimously, that the thanks of this Court be given to"], [146, "( x ) Commodore Sir James Brisbane, C. B., and the captains and officers of His Majesty's and the Company's ships and boats, who co-operated with the army in the Burmese war, for their cordial, zealous, and most useful exertions, and to the crews of His Majesty's and the Company's ships and boats employed in that service, for their spirited and intrepid conduct on all occasions, and that the commander of His Majesty's ships on the India station be requested to communicate the thanks of the Court to the officers and men under his command.' \"Independently of this general expression of thanks, the Court have not failed specially to record their concurrence in the high approbation bestowed by the Bengal Government on the exertions of Captain Chads, both when senior officer and when charged with several of the most difficult enterprises. \" Upon those points of Captain Chads's representation which refer to pecuniary compensation, the Court instruct me to remark, that both branches of the service, naval and military, were remunerated by the grant of batta ; the only difference being, that, in the case of the navy, the batta was issued during the progress of the war, and for the whole period of service, whereas in the case of the army, it was not issued until the war had terminated, and then only for a limited period, not exceeding, in any instance, twelve months. Hence the Lords of the Treasury will perceive that Captain Chads is mistaken in sayingthat the navy were not allowed to participate in the grant of special batta. \" The Court beg leave further to state, that the extra batta granted to the navy, upon the occasion of the Burmese war, was in addition to the allowance of batta which the Company regularly make to the officers of the royal navy in the Eastern Seas. \" Of the crore of rupees which the Government of Ava agreed by treaty to pay, as ' part indemnification for the expenses of the war', there had been received at the date of the last advices, 62 lacs 66,672 rupees, nearly the whole of which has been expended in the special batta paid to the army and navy for their services during the war, and the Lords of His Majesty's Treasury are fully aware of the severe pressure which that war has brought on the finances of India. \"The sum deposited in the Company's Treasury on account of the proceeds of property captured during the war, appears by the latest accounts, to amount to no more than 13 lacs 687 rupees, but the Court have no doubt that other monies may have been subsequently realized on the same account. \" The Court have given directions fora memorial to be preferred, .praying the distribution iu the usual manner of whatever sum may be in deposit in respect of the same property.

Directors would again be induced to give it their atten tion, and consider the royal navy as equally entitled to their liberality as the other branches of the expedition.\" \" Up to the close of the war,\" added he, \" there was no invidious distinction as to emolument ; and had that peace, which was so honorable to the whole force, not taken place, the navy would not now, in all human probability, have to deplore the neglect they have hitherto experienced. I feel confident the Honorable Court will have every liberal disposition to do justice to those who have undergone such unprecedented hardships and privations in their service with so much zeal and courage.\" The facts adduced by Captain Chads on this occasion, together with his remarks, appear in a second memorial to the Lords of his Majesty's Treasury, a copy of which will presently be given. The answer he received from Mr. Auber is as follows : \u2014 \" East India House, \\st January, 1830. \" Sir, \u2014 The Court of Directors of the Ea6t India Company have had before them your letter,- requesting, upon the grounds therein set forth, a re-consideration of the claims of the detachment of the royal navy which was employed in the Burmese war, to participate in the donation of batta granted to the army upon its termination, and I am commanded to inform you, that it is with much regret the Court feel themselves compelled to maintain the decision passed by the Government of Bengal, and which has received the Court's confirmation.

Rank of Army. Battaper diem. \" Captains, three years post - Colonels - - - - 25 rupees. \" Captains, under ditto - - - Lieutenant-Colonels 20 rupees. \" Commanders Majors - - - - 15 rupees.\" \" A similar regulation had been adopted on former occasions by the Bombay Presidency. \" It was generally understood, that this arrangement was intended to place the army and navy, whilst serving in the expedition, according to their relative ranks, on the same footing (although, in fact, the army had considerable advantages), and the allowance was gratefully accepted by the navy ; unfortunately, from the peculiarity of the service and the nature of the country, it proved barely sufficient to cover the enormous additional expence incurred by the scarcity of provisions, and the very high price of all the common necessaries of life. With this allotment of batta, the navy continued to co-operate with the army for nearly two years, until the end of the war, during which period the officers and men quitted their vessels for long spaces of lime, and became in effect a part of the land force, sharing all the dangers of the army, exposed to the same privations and hardships, bearing the same expenses, and even messing with their relative ranks in the army, and encamping with them during several months in the wet season. The sufferings necessarily incident to this peculiar warfare pressed most severely on the navy, from being unaccustomed to this kind of service, but all was borne cheerfully and without complaint. \" Your Memorialist further begs leave to state, that the navy always considered, that at the conclusion of the war, they had good reason to ex pect to receive the same remuneration as should be made to the army ; the maritime force had, in every respect, equally contributed to the ultU"], [149, "( rin ) mate success of the war, and therefore to withhold from them the advan tages enjoyed by the army, has the effect of creating an invidious distinction between the two services. \" At the conclusion of the war, the Governor-General granted a dona tion of three and six months' field batta to the troops, according to the time of their services, as a remuneration for the losses and expenses they had incurred ; from this donation tbe navy was excluded upon the plea that they had received extra batta during the war, although their whole allowances were inferior, according to their relative ranks, to those enjoyed by the army \" ; indeed so great was the necessary expence of subsistence, that without these allowances it would have been impossible for the officers and men of the navy to have procured what was absolutely indispensable. This donation to the troops obtained the sanction of the Honorable Court of Directors, and another similar grant was made to them, still ex cluding the navy on the same grounds as before ; and so strongly was this preference in favor of the army evinced, that in addition to the extra batta which was granted to His Majesty's 45th regiment +, and other troops who had arrived just at the close of the war, the donation of six months' batta was made to them, whilst the officers and men on board of, and belonging to, His Majesty's ships who had been employed for a few months only pre vious to its termination, merely received (extra) batta during the period of their actual services, and no more. \" Your Memorialist deems it right to inform your Lordships, that he is almost the only individual in command who received extra batta beyond the donation of twelve months ; but this circumstance arose from his hav ing, though with impaired health, withstood for a longer period the extreme variableness of the climate, and the severity of the service, when three of his superior officers had fallen victims to it ; and consequently his services were for a greater space of time devoted to the interests of the East India Company. \" Your Memorialist requests your Lordships' particular attention to the fact, that the resolution of the Indian Government whereby the Bombay marine as well as the royal navy were excluded from receiving the donation, has been altered by the Supreme Government at Calcutta, and by the orders of the Bombay Government, dated the 22d of September, 1828, the Bom bay marine were directed to receive the donation and allowance of batta, and a grant to that effect has been made to Commodore Hayes, commanding the flotilla in Arracan, as flag-officer, which appears by the letter hereto annexed, whilst by reference to the treaty of peace it will be seen that your Memorialist was in command of the flotilla that was in strumental to the honorable termination of the war. * And their losses and expenses fully equal. t A corps not at all connected with either of the Indian Presidencies."], [150, "( XIV ) \" By these measures, the royal navy is the only branch of the force now excluded from that benefit which it has been deemed right to confer on their associates in this war. Your Memorialist humbly represents to vour Lordships, that such an exclusion is in itself not only an unmerited hardship, but must necessarily be considered as throwing, comparatively at least, discredit on the services by them performed. Your Memorialist confidently avers, that with regard to exertion, suffering, and privation, there exists no reason which ought justly to place the navy in an inferior and more disadvantageous condition. \" Your Memorialist begs leave further to state, that an application has lately been made to the Honorable Court of Directors, by Major-General Sir Archibald Campbell, for a grant of the crore of rupees stipulated to be paid by the Burmese Government in pursuance of the treat}', in order that the same should be distributed as prize to the forces engaged. Amongst many other reasons, one of the grounds on which this applica tion was founded, was the loss sustained in relinquishing the immense booty which would have fallen into the hands of the British forces by the capture of the Burmese capital, which was in their grasp. To this re quest the Court have deemed it proper to withhold their consent, alleging as a reason the donation of batta for twelve months, and stating that, from this crore of rupees, the troops received the same benefit as had been granted in t/ie previous case of Seringapatam. And your Lordships *, in reply to Sir Archibald Campbell's memorial on the same subject, state, 'that you should not be justified in recommending' [to the Directors of the East India Company to make] ' any addition to the gratuity which the army has already received.' These decisions of your Lordships and the Honorable Court of Directors greatly strengthen the claim of the roval navy, for that branch of the forces engaged was as instrumental in procur ing this crore of rupees as any other, and if any part of the property so acquired, or any monies in lieu of it, be made the subject of donation, it is but consistent with justice and impartiality that all engaged should partici pate in the advantage, and your Memorialist humbly prays your Lordships to recommend to His Majesty to cause the same, by his gracious inter ference, to be effected towards his royal navy, by the distribution of a sum equal to that received by his army. \" In thus addressing your Lordships, your Memorialist begs to disclaim any feeling of personal advantage, and to avow that lie is actuated solely by a sense of duty he owes to the brave men who served under his com mand, who look to him to maintain their claims and protect them, to the utmost of his power, from all injustice.

The following will shew the result of his second application to the Treasury : \u2014 \" East India House, 3d June, 1830. \" Sir, \u2014 The Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the East India Com pany have laid before the Court of Directors your letter dated the 11th ultimo, transmitting a copy of a memorial from Captain II.

I have the honor to be, &c. (Signed) \" P. Auber, Sec.\" \" To the Hon. J. Stewart.\" On the 17th of the same month, Mr. J. Stuart Wortley, Secretary to the Board of Controul, acquainted Mr. Barrow, for the information of the Lords of the Admiralty, that a reference had been made to the Directors of the East India Company, and an explanation received, on the subject of Captain Chads's memorial. This, however, proved quite as unsatisfactory as either of Mr. Auber's former letters, and induced Captain Chads thus to follow up his appeal to their Lordships : \" Fareham, Hants, 24th June, 1830. \" Sir, \u2014 I hope it will not be considered presumptuous, that I again intrude by replying to the letter from the Secretary to the Board for the Affairs of India, of the 17th June, 1830, which my Lords Commissioners of the Ad miralty have done me the honor of sending to me. Silence might be at tributed to my acquiescence in the justice of the remarks of the Honor able Court of Directors of the East India Company. Whilst I admit that the fullest credit should be given to the Court of Directors, that they desire the royal navy should derive every advantage from the war in Ava that has been granted to the army, and that they really believe it has done so, I trust their lordships will also give me credit for neither desiring nor requesting any thing further ; and that in asserting the claims of the navy now, or heretofore, I am not actuated by a selfish or mercenary motive, but solely from an anxiety that the service I have the honor of belonging to should not be placed in an inferior point of view with any other service. \" The Court of Directors have now given specific reasons for with holding the donation of batta to the navy, and in the language they have used it might be imagined that the navy had been a favored branch of the expedition ; but I trust in the explanation I shall now have the honor of submitting, with all due respect, I can shew that they have been totally mistaken in the view they have taken of the subject, and which I am persuaded only requires to be pointed out to them, to obtain a revision of their judgment, in favor of the claims I have submitted. \"The Court have in their reply made two distinct statements, which I"], [153, "( xvii ) beg to quote at length, for the purpose of replying to them seriatim, and thus incontrovertildy to point out the fallacy under which the Court labours. \" 1st, ' That both branches of the service, naval and military, were re munerated by the grant of batta, the only difference being thai in the case of the navy the batta was issued during the progress of the ivar, and for the whole period of service, whereas in the case of the army it was not issued until the tear had terminated, and then only for a limited period, not exceeding in any instance twelve months.' \" The principle on which the batta was given to the navy during the progress of the War was taken from that of the army ; the latter, on going on service or taking the field, is placed on full batta, and which is an extra daily allowance not paid whilst in garrison. The troops did leave garrison or half batta stations, and went into the field on full batta, thereby ac quiring additional half batta, for which assertion I appeal to any person at all conversant with this subject in general, and specifically for this occasion I have the authority expressly given of Lieutenant-Colonels Elrington and Godwin, who commanded the 47th aud 41st regiments ; the former em barked on the expedition at Bombay, and subsequently from Fort William, and the latter from Madras, thus including the three presidencies of India ; this full batta was received by all ranks of the army during the progress of the war, and for the whole period, and was the guide to and precisely the same sum granted to the navy on its taking the field with the army ; and in the resolution of the Bengal Government, granting it to the navy, it was most properly called 'full batta of corresponding ranks in the army.' The navy received the full batta during the progress of the war only, each ship respectively for the time it was employed, and no ship for the whole period, whilst many regiments did so, and some even that were in Ava but a very short time, a single day entitling them to six months' donation. \" ' The extra batta granted to the navy upon the occasion of the Bur mese war was in addition' to the allowance of batta which the Company regularly make to the officers of the royal navy in the Eastern Seas.' \" The army likewise received their additional or extra batta in addition to their usual allowance. \" I now submit, Sir, that the resolution of the Bengal Government was as necessary as it was equitable. The navy was employed in every pos sible situation with the army, even to messing and encamping, and ought to be considered, as they were in fact, an extra corps attached to the Company's forces, and without which branch the war could not have been prosecuted. It could not reasonably be expected that the officers and men of the royal navy should be called to serve on this unprecedented service by the Honorable East India Company (for it was of a nature not to in duce any one to intrude on) and placed side by side with the army, in a country where every necessary of life was to be procured only at an M"], [154, "( XVIII ) enormous expence, ruinous to the individuals if left on the common allowances of India, and I confidently hope it will be deemed that the navy was entitled to the same field allowances as their companions in arms. \" 2d, \u2014 ' That it is a mistake to suppose that the Bombay marine gene ral/y received both the daily gratuity batta, and the donation after the war, the latter being expresslq limited to cases in which the daily gratuity batta had not been drawn.' \" To this the reply is concise. Captain Hardy, who commanded the Bombay marine under my orders, assures me that he did receive the batta during the progress of the war, as well as the donation batta at the con clusion, and that there are several officers of that service now in England, as well as Captain Hardy, who have received the same and can attest it. By the following certificate it appears that the second donation batta was made during the administration of Lord Amherst. \" 'Superintendent's Office, Bombay, 20th January, 1829. \" ' This is to certify that Captain Henry Hardy, of the Honorable Company's marine, has not yet received the second donation batta granted by the Supreme Government under date 2\\st September, 1826, to the officers and men of the marine establishment of Bombay, employed in the late war against the Burmese. (Signed) \" ' Charles Malcolm, Sup1, of Marine.' \" I have every reason to believe, although the order is dated September 21st, 1826, it was not promulgated in General Orders, as in the case of the army, and indeed was not sent to Bombay until a very considerable time had elapsed. \" ' And that if Sir John Hayes received donation batta, as well as daily gratuity batta, he received it without the sanction, and contrary to the intentions of the Court.' \" With respect to Sir John Hayes, I have before sent the official docu ment granting him the donation as a flag-officer, and it is under his own hand that he has received it ; as it is three years since, the public accounts ought to shew the Directors the fact and the amount. \"Having now endeavoured to afford my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty every information, I have to request their Lordships will be pleased to communicate it to the Board of Centroul, and I feel confident the claims of the navy to participate in the renumeration granted to the army since the war, and which has been paid from the money obtained by the treaty of peace, will receive a further consideration, founded on the explanations which I have happily had it in my power to furnish, and which I doubt not will be sufficiently satisfactory to induce the Board to view the claim I have made as only fair and just.
