And silence listens on the slumb'rous waste: B"], [8, "2 When tyrant frost his strong dominion holds, And not a blade expands, a bud unfolds, But nature dead, divested of her green, Cloath'd in a solemn pallid shroud is seen : When gather'd thunders burst, abrupt, and loud, And midnight lightning leaps from cloud to cloud, Or rends, with forceful, momentary stroke, The ivied turret, and the giant oak ; Can faint remembrance of meridian mirth, Bedeck with visionary charms the earth ; Renew the season when each wak'nine: flow'r Lifted its leaves to drink the morning show'r ; Dispel the gloom, the fi'ry storm remove, Gem the wide vault and animate the grove ?

Alas ! all inefficient is her pow'r, To cheer, by what is past, the present hour, For ev'ry good gone by, each transport o'er, She may regret, but never can restore. Yet shall her fest'ring touch corrode the heart, Compel the subjugated tear to start : She calls grim phantoms, from the shad'wy deep, And sends her furies forth to torture sleep : The lapse of time, the strength of reason dares, And with fresh rage her straining rack prepares.

Their soft emotions charm'd his youthful breast ; And as he gave each wild idea scope, Look'd to new joy with renovated hope ? Ah no ! his thought with melancholy range, Traces the progress of the afflictive change, Adds to the immediate evil he endures, By strong controul each struggling pang secures ; Till tir'd, and shock'd, he turns him in despair, From things that have been, to the things that are. For what avails it now that once his mind Was light as air, and frolic as the wind, Alike to sorrow or to vice unknown, That ev'ry moral solace was his own, Since at an alter'd season, mis'ry gave Sighs for the past, and wishes for the grave ?"], [11, "5 How swiftly fly the raptures of our prime,. Swrept by the tempest of destroying time, Whose whirlwind lays the pride of empire low, And mingles nature in a wild of woe ! Shall we then pond' ring on its varied rage, By recollected bliss our cares assuage, Expatiate freely on the ravag'd plain, Where flow'd the stream, and wav'd the golden grain, Where fountains cool refreshed the summer shade,. And hamlets gay diversified the glade, Where show'd the sculptur'd fane its splendid site, And groves, the grandeur of diurnal night ?

Where'er we cast our retrospective eyes, A waste of rocks, a dreary desert lies, Here desolation's grasp has rent his flow'rs That scatter'd fragrance round our infant bow'rs, There the wide ruin of our hopes extends, Mark'd with memorials of departed friends. So the poor trav'ller from some alpine height, Looks backward on his journey with affright, For still the dangers past his thoughts confound, And other dangers threaten still around ; The headlong precipice, the icy pass, The whelming avalanche's monstrous mass, The tumbling cliff, the torrent's sudden rise, The tangled forest reaching to the skies,"], [13, "7 The clust'ring clouds that wrap the mountain's side, The frozen mists that o'er the valley glide, These all in dread confusion strike his heart, He fears to stay, nor ventures to depart.

Or to her sad fate left, condemn' d to rove The lawless paths of desultory love ; Will not her tortur'd bosom throb the more, Whene'er she thinks on what she was before, And finds recoiling from the insidious joy A secret canker ev'ry rose destroy."], [17, "11 While all that memory's sorcery can dispense, Shall add new pangs to loss of innocence.

Did'st thou not skill and artifice employ, To lure the hapless maid, and then destroy ? What kind persuasion woo'd her soften'd sense, AVhat cunning falsehood, and what fair pretence, What fond endearments, mingled with the kiss, That promis'd constancy, and nuptial bliss !

Nor vice alone, remembrance ! dreads thy reign, Virtue alike can sicken at thy pain. Why does that drooping youth, with footsteps slow, Pace the dark desert, or the vale of snow ; Why hold fantastic converse with the wind ? 'Tis thou art with him, tyrant of the mind !

Then, then thy scorching fires convulse his veins, Her image settled on his thought remains ; In ev'ry shade her pensive form he sees, Her wailing voice is heard in ev'ry breeze ; He feels the pressure of her circling arms, Traces her sweet redundancy of charms,"], [22, "16 And still revolving on the dear display, Sinks to the earth, in desolate dismay.
