I hope you do not mean it.1 Her daughter was silent for a moment. ' Well, it isn't likely I want to marry his mother as well as himself,' she said presently ; ' he ought to know that.' ' Mr. French \u2014 Tom, I thought we were going to call him \u2014 is placed in a very awkward position, Polly. You see, she has lived with him all his life till now.1 ' And means to all the rest of it,1 replied the girl. She tossed her head. It was fair as was the soft complexion, whilst the large blue eyes, the small round face, the full but well-shaped little figure, all revealed a healthy beauty and a love of life over which that moment's petulance was but a passing shadow. ' I hope not, my dear,1 sighed her mother. ' Hoping is little good, mother. He has never said she shan't live with him, and I know she means to.1"], [10, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 2 ' But I dare say he's thinking it over, dear ; you should give him time. He'll do everything he can, I know. Yes, I know he will,1 said Mrs. Somers, nodding her head at the girl with a smile of confidence. ' I don't think you do, mother. If he cared for me, he would act differently. Oh, there is father !' ' Dear me, he's bringing someone in again ! How fond he is of it I1 exclaimed Mrs. Somers. Polly had run to the door, but, on hearing a second footstep, stopped short. ' Ah, my love, that's right !' said her father, entering upon her. ' I've brought someone to see you ;' and he patted her on the cheek. He was a short man of about fifty years, and very stout. His face, which had once been that of a pretty boy, was now broad and rubicund, yet there was as youthful a twinkle in his blue eyes as ever. His stout ness seemed to make him short of breath, and he brought out his words with difficulty. His voice, too, was thin and wheezy. The man who followed him was very little like him. The Rev. Edgar Mayland was lank and spare, of, per haps, scarce thirty years of age. His pale, shaven face, his light gray eyes, were the revelation of a delicate and sympathetic soul, his figure and motions those of one highly nervous and keen-strung. He was the curate, or, rather, one of the two curates of that parish of Great Marley, whose fine old fourteenth-century church stood just on the other side of the wide rickyard of the Church Farm, of which Mr. Somers was the prosperous tenant. He had not many months before arrived in the parish, and this was the first time the hospitable"], [11, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 3 farmer had encountered him alone, and succeeded in persuading him to enter his house and make the ac quaintance of his wife and daughter. It was at once evident that he was not quite at his ease, and that the bucolic companionship, rough but hearty, in which he found himself was something new to him. He advanced hurriedly towards the farmer's wife and shook hands with her. In a flurried way he said something about not having had the pleasure of meeting before, then turned back towards his host, who, having closed the door, was ponderously moving after him, with Polly upon his arm. ' My daughter,' he said. ' Think you've not met her either \u2014 only child.1 Mayland bowed, but said nothing. ' Take a seat, sir, won't you ?' said Mrs. Somers. He dropped into a chair, and remarked that it was a lovely night. Now, neither the farmer nor his wife, in spite of the former's hospitable feelings, had great powers of con versation, so that, beyond allowing that it was so, neither offered any original observation in reply. A deadlock threatened, had not Polly, who was fairly innocent of shyness, come to the rescue. ' We are so glad to see you,' she said. ' I have been hoping ever so father would bring you in.' ' Thank you,' a slight colour coming to his pale face. ' I told him to look out for you,' she said. ' Indeed !' ' You see,' she went on, ' the church being so close we can always see from the yard who is going in and out ; and you go so much more often than Mr. Jebb.' 1\u20142"], [12, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 4 'Ah, you have seen me?' he exclaimed in an un pleased tone. ' Yes \u2014 why not ?' ' Oh,1 he stammered, ' I only did not know exactly ' ' I'm sure, sir, there's nought to be ashamed of, look- ing after the church,' said Mr. Somers from his arm chair, where he had now recovered some of his breath. 'I like to see that there door open a bit weekdays as well as Sundays. Looks careful-like, and airs the place.' Mr. Mayland was relieved. It had never occurred to him that people would not know that he turned so often into the silent church on his way past for prayer and consolation, for those intervals of peace and inspira tion without which a nature such as his could not fight on. So much so that, being reluctant to have the news of his frequent visits to that edifice carried to a certain quarter, he had usually crept up to it, key in hand, by the path from the river meadows at the back, a roundabout and unpleasant way of entrance, owing to the rough and rotten nature of the ground, but one by which he had flattered himself he was safe from obser vation. It was something of a comfort now to find that the only person who, in spite of all precautions, had perceived him, had concluded that he went there for the purpose of opening windows and putting things in order. He smiled contentedly. ' Yes,' he said, ' it is good in every way. For my part, I think the door of God's house should never be closed.1 ' Well, it 'ud be a mighty deal healthier, no doubt,1"], [13, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 5 said the farmer ; ' those walls are wet enough, but I fancy you'd get more inside of 'em than you'd care for, maybe. Every loafin' chap as comes by ' ' So much the better,' broke in the other, his uneasi ness vanishing under the excitement of a subject dear to him \u2014 ' so much the better !' At which startling declaration Mr. Somers stopped short, feeling himself face to face with a new view of things, which imposed silence till the time when he should comprehend them. But Polly thought that he was discomfited, and came to his rescue. ' You see, we are old-fashioned folk,' she said, ' and don't take easily to new ideas. I'm afraid you can't altogether like this place ?' He cleared his throat with a ringing little cough. ' Ah, thank you,' he said in his high-pitched voice ; * on the whole I think I can say I have enjoyed my time here very much. But there are many things, as you say, a little strange to me, though I shall certainly carry away most pleasant recollections.1 ' Carry away ! You don't mean you are leaving ?' ' I fear so, before very long. When one does not give satisfaction to one's superior it is best to part. That is, unfortunately, my fate.' ' Ay, dear me !' exclaimed Mr. Somers. ' I'm sorry to hear that.1 ' So am I very sorry to say it,' returned the other. 'I had looked for a long stay here \u2014 a comparatively long one, I should say \u2014 and I am finding many friends, especially among the poor people. To leave Mr. Jebb is sufficiently painful also to make me think twice ; but I am afraid there is no alternative.1"], [14, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 6 ' And may I,1 said the farmer, ' be so bold as just to inquire ' ' Oh, it's simple enough,1 said Mayland ; ' it's a case of mere incompatibility of spirit. Mr. Hargreaves, our rector, you know, is of the old school ; and its views and ours are diametrically opposed. No doubt, the ill health he has so long suffered from, and which has for so many years prevented him from taking any truly active part in the services of the church and the many duties of this large parish, has always disinclined him greatly to any change. You, as warden, Mr. Somers, must have felt this also, I am sure.1 The farmer winced. He could not remember having pressed for any particular reformations, on his part, which could call for resistance. He had thought things fairly well as he had found them ; but he was a modest man, and he realized that others might think differently, so he nodded assent. ' \" The old order changeth, yielding place to new,11 you know,' continued the curate, ' and it is but a matter of time, though I confess I have been surprised how much time. When, on my health breaking down, I was ordered to throw up my work in Murkington for a while, and seek out some Sleepy Hollow where I could forget the misery and strain of that sad place among green fields and silent lanes, I felt it my duty to honestly obey my doctor's orders, and I believe I did so. I understood, from a friend of mine who had stayed here, that here I should find everything restful ; and I came. And certainly I found it so, and in less than a fortnight I was a different man. Strength and energy returned to me, and with them a sense of duty. I felt"], [15, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 7 that that which God had so graciously restored to me should be freely given for the benefit of that by which He had so worked. I wished to commence at once a more active labour, a more vigorous ministry, a larger effort to uplift the souls of those whose bread I ate. And my friend and colleague, Mr. Jebb, I was delighted to find, felt likewise, and thanked me deeply for the stimulus I brought him. We proposed a scheme of extra services both in this church and in the outlying hamlets ; and also I wished for this very thing we have been mentioning, the keeping open of the house of God at all hours, for all comers. Well, we took our proposi tion to the rector, confident that if we were willing to take this extra burden on our own backs, without resort to him in any way, he could not possibly object. We were destined to be bitterly disappointed. We were met by an absolute refusal. Now, though I had under stood that Mr. Hargreaves was a man of poor enthusiasms, I had never imagined that he was one to resist the full and faithful accomplishment of our mission in its highest meanings, at any rate by others. I was utterly aston ished. But after that refusal I felt it my duty to cut short my stay here and go back to Murkington, feel ing that it would be wicked to waste any longer in a restricted sphere the powers so wonderfully restored to me.1 ' Dear, dear I1 exclaimed Mr. Somers. ' And is Mr. Jebb going too ?' ' Oh no. Mr. Jebb has not said so. Though he has stood by me truly in this matter, he is, if I may say so without depreciating a valued friend, a trifle less, shall I say, impatient of obstruction than I have always found"], [16, "8 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH myself. Tis no reproach to him. It speaks, perhaps, a gentler nature in him, if an easier.1 ' Or a lazier,1 put in Mrs. Somers quietly. ' No, no, you mistake him,1 said his friend ; ' really, I know him well. Three months, now, under the same roof, we have spent together ; and since he has a character of the simplest and most transparent, I ought to know it. He is as fond of work as I am, and has as strong a sense of duty. But he needs initiative. In that, I own, he is a little wanting. Only that.1 Mrs. Somers looked incredulous, but did not respond. ' What a pity ! And you really mean to go ?' said Polly. ' I have not absolutely decided,1 he replied. ' The rector and I have left it open.1 ' Oh, don't go then,1 she cried ; ' please don't.1 He was startled, and regarded her closely for the first time across the table where she sat with her hands clasped before her. She blushed slightly. ' Why not ?' he asked simply. She coloured deeper, but said nothing to explain herself. ' Because she thinks folks '11 maybe like you better nor ' i But the good farmer did not complete his sentence. Mr. Mayland flushed. ' I hope you are not again comparing me with Mr. Jebb,' he said ; ' because, if you are, I shall suspect you of a pleasantry. A man who is welcomed in every house in the parish ' Polly said something under her breath, and withdrew her arms from the table."], [17, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 9 ' Oh, Jebb's not a bad sort,' said her father. ' But it is very kind of you to wish me to remain,' continued Mayland, looking again at her with increasing courage ; ' and I, for my part, shall be very, very sorry to leave you.' She dropped her eyes coyly, and he suddenly realized that he was speaking to a pretty girl, who might be affecting to construe personally this merely formal declaration of his sorrow. Then, with a mild flush of indignation, he reassured himself. Why should she ? It was quite preposterous. He had never spoken to her before. And, pretty as she undoubtedly was, she could not surely think herself sufficiently lovely to affect him at first sight. Aud yet she had dropped her eyes and blushed. He turned to address himself to her parents. But, unfortunately, he could not think of anything to say to them, and they did not assist him ; so that there was a short silence, during which Polly moved round to that side of the table by the fireplace where he sat, and, dropping into a little stool almost at his feet, looked up into his face. And yet, sitting there, with her fresh little figure and air, half childish, half coquettish, her golden wisps of wavy hair, through which she had just drawn her fingers, hiding the low, smooth brow with a natural fringe to the blue eyes, could even this young man, young only in years as he might be, to whom it seemed that duty was his sole desire, and love only a strange function of a world to which, in a way, he was accredited, but not a part \u2014 could even he look down upon her from where he sat without discerning that"], [18, "10 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH deep in his nature there were fibres more responsive to that sentiment than hitherto he had ever reckoned on ? At any rate, he seemed inclined to push a little further back his chair, though in actual fact he did not do so. The girl rested her face in her little fists, her elbows on her knees. ' You are very different from him, anyhow,1 she said. ' Polly !' exclaimed her mother. The father chuckled softly in his chair. ' I hardly understand you,' said the curate. ' Why, you speak so differently, to begin with,1 she said. ' Do we ?' he said with a light laugh ; then innocently assuming that she meant the comparison in his favour, he added : ' But I don't think it fair to discuss my friend in his absence.1 ' No, no, Polly,1 said her father. ' But with regard to him,1 went on the curate, ' I think you should know, in mere justice to him, that he has not had the advantages I have had. He is, in the first place, a self-educated man. By sheer force of character he has raised himself to be worthy of his call ing, whilst I, from my earliest years, at school and at college, have been forced and fostered by the care of others. And until I left Oxford I moved always among congenial souls, receiving more than I had to give, without care or distraction of any sort. He, on the other hand, as I have said, when almost a lad, was forced to put the powers within him into practice, to com mence on work for which I was about to receive another ten good years of training. I have been made,"], [19, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 11 and he has made himself. So you see why you should not compare us.1 ' Ay, ay,1 said the farmer. Polly threw down her hands before her. ' Was it nice at Oxford ?' she asked. ' Well, yes. I think it is a place from which most men carry away affectionate remembrances. But there are different ways of appreciating life in a place like that. For some it is a field of work, for others play.1 ' For you work,1 she exclaimed admiringly. He flushed. ' It is very charitable of you to think so.1 ' Who could doubt it ?' she said. ' And you are very clever ?' ' Really, Miss Somers, you overwhelm me with con sideration I do not deserve ; so I think it is time for me to say good-night ;' and he partly rose. ' Oh, no, no, don1t, please ! You must not go !' she exclaimed, springing up from her stool and play fully menacing him with her hands. ' I won't compli ment you any more. I'll run you down, I'll say all sorts of nasty things about you, I will ! Do sit down, really ; you don't know what I won't say.' He was flushed and confused, and before he himself was aware of it he had fallen back into his chair. ' That's right ! that's right I1 cried Mr. Somers. ' Now, won't you take something to drink, sir ?' Mr. Mayland declared himself an absolute abstainer. 'Now, father,1 said Polly, 'isn't Mr. Mayland, the new curate, one of the most objectionable, unsuit able ' ' Polly, how can you !' broke in her mother."], [20, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 12 Her father laughed. ' Haven't we said we hoped he would never come inside our house ? Haven't we always wished ' ' Then I shall have to take you at your word,' inter rupted the young man, laughing and entering into her mood in a manner that surprised himself. ' Oh, then I must begin again and praise,' she said hurriedly. ' In that case I must certainly be off,1 he exclaimed ; and starting up again, in earnest this time, he reached the door, when he remembered the proprieties, turned, and stepping back to where Mrs. Somers had risen from her seat, held out his hand. She took it not unwillingly, and wished him good night. He shook hands with her husband also. ' Good - night, good - night, sir,' said the farmer cheerily ; ' sorry you won't stay.' The curate excused himself, and with a bow to Polly, who was opening the door for him, was in the act of disappearing, when he turned once more. ' Let me see,1 he said, ' I hardly know the way. Straight across the rickyard, is it not ?' ' Straight on, sir. I'll come and show you,' said Mr. Somers. ' No, father, I will,' said Polly \u2014 ' I will show him. Come.' The curate thanked her, and they both went out. When the door was closed, and the farmer had re seated himself, his wife began : ' I don't like this of Polly, John.' ' Eh\u2014 what ?'"], [21, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 13 ' This being so free with strangers. It's not right, and it will bring trouble.1 ' Tut, tut I1 he said ; ' it's only her spirits ; it's all play.1 ' Yes, but it will, John, Look at that Jebb.1 ' She soon sent him to the rightabouts,1 he said. ' But he was dreadfully bit with her, and we had great fears,1 she answered. ' And it was all through your bringing him in here evenings, just as you are doing with this one.1 ' But this is the first time,1 he said ' Yes, but how often after ?' ' Oh, well, don't you fear,' he said ; ' she's too sensible to go and throw herself away upon a poor scarecrow of a parson like that there, when there's a young chap like Tom French fooling around her.' 'Fooling!' she exclaimed. 'Yes, that's all it has been.\" ' What !' he cried. ' A fact, John. And now they've had words, and from what she has told me I shouldn't be surprised if he never came here again.' ' Dear, dear !' exclaimed the farmer. ' At any rate, she's not tied, and so we don't know what may happen ; and we don't want that Jebb trouble over again.' ' Never fear,' he answered ; ' this here's a bird of another feather.1"], [22, "CHAPTER II. The Church Farm house stood back a good way from the main highroad, and faced a narrow lane which ran at right angles into it. All between the house and the broad road was rickyard, across which a footpath ran to a wicket-gate ; and at the left of the rickyard, as you faced it, running parallel with the back of the house, was the long, low wall which separated the homestead in its entirety from the graveyard, with its innumerable stones and fine old square-towered church beyond. It was by the aforesaid footpath and by the kitchen entrance that the farmer had introduced his clerical friend into the house, and now it was by the same informal route that the latter, guided by Polly, issued from it. As they did so, the stars were out, for it was near ten o'clock, and the time of year was late July. But the air was soft and warm, and lightly lifting her hair as it drew around the ghostly forms of gaunt hay ricks and barn-ends, did not suggest the least necessity for a hat. She laughed as they stumbled amongst loose straw and general farmyard litter ; and when he started in real alarm as an old hen flew chuckling out of a stack corner, where she had hygienically preferred to pass the night a la belk etoile, rather than in the stuffy"], [23, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 15 interior of the common roost, her mirth became so great and so convulsive that she actually had to place her hand upon his arm to enable her to bear it. He was not a trifle embarrassed, and perhaps just the least also mortified. In her eyes he felt himself ridiculous. ' I am afraid,' he said, ' we greenhorns of the city must appear very laughable to you, so familiar with all this. I have been already three months in the country, and I seem no more accustomed to its sights and sounds than when I came ; and yet I think I could both get very used to them and very fond of them.' She suppressed her mirth immediately. ' Oh, it would soon come if you would stay,' she said, ' but you won't.' ' Won't is can't, Miss Somers.' ' When there's a will there's a way,' she answered with a pout. They had come now to the wicket-gate which opened on the highroad, and he endeavoured to release the latch. He fumbled over it in the dark in a nervous manner, but failed to open it. ' Let me,' she said ; ' it is stiff.' ' I am a great muff,' he sighed, as he stepped back. She moved forward and placed her hand on the latch ; but instead of attempting to raise it, she stood dreamily looking out over the road. Presently she said : ' You could stay if you liked.' He was surprised at her insistence. ' I don't know why you should think you would miss me,' he replied. ' I fear I have been of very little service to you so far.1"], [24, "16 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH ' Is Murkington very dirty, very horrible ?' she asked. ' It is a great manufacturing city,1 he answered ; ' and such places are always dark and full of misery. ' And you are going back to it ? How you must dislike it ! I should.' ' It is not a question of like and dislike,1 he replied ; ' my work calls, and I obey.1 ' You have to get your living ? Yes, of course,1 she said. He suffered quite a shock. He, the priest, the celibate, who had yearly disbursed nearly the whole of a comfortable private income in the services of charity and the church, retaining but the barest sufficiency for his own small needs, had almost forgotten that it was possible that duty, in the sacred sense in which he held it, might yet be co-existent with necessity. But the next moment he remembered it, and thanked her in wardly for the rebuke her words had brought him. Had not he nursed a secret pride in the elevation over all considerations of pounds and pence, which, after all, only the accident of birth had given him, and without which, trifling as were his needs, they still would have had to be provided for ? Yes, he thanked her. ' I have to earn my living,1 he repeated slowly. 'It is tiresome,1 she said, taking him at his word. ' What a pity it is we must have money ! If it only wasn't so, we could then live where we liked ; but I suppose it is impossible. And then, perhaps there are other reasons why you do not care to stay here. No doubt you find it very slow.' Once more he looked at her in amazement. Was it possible she had not heard or comprehended the ex-"], [25, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 17 planation he had given but just now within as to his departure ? Slow ! What an expression, too, was that ! As though he were a mere crowd-lover, a creature of excitements, a hater of green fields and silent walks. Slow ! He was almost nettled. ' I scarcely understand you,' he observed. ' Oh, it was only because I remembered he said it was,' she answered. < Who ?' ' Mr. Jebb. He told me he longed ever so to live in town.' ' Indeed ! Then he has favoured you with more con fidence than he has ever me. In fact, I have always understood him otherwise \u2014 a countryman in heart and soul.' ' Have you ?' she exclaimed. ' Then he has changed.' ' Since when ? You see him often ?' ' Not to speak to for a long time,' she replied, some what dejectedly. ' How's that ? Does he not call ? I must ask him why.' ' No, no, you won't !' she begged. ' At least, you won't say I wished him to ?' ' By no means, if you ask it. Only I must jog his memory ; it will be a kindness to him. And now, if you will let me say good-night.' But she held her place before the gate. ' You haven't really said why you must go,' she per sisted. ' I believe you could stay if you liked.' ' In that case,1 he replied, ' I should stay, for I should like to very much. But I thought I told you, did I not, the reason ? My disagreement with the rector \u2014 2"], [26, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 18 or, rather, his with me. I merely wanted a free hand, and he refuses it ; he drives me from him.1 ' And from us,' she said. ' And from you,' he answered mechanically. 'Oh, it is too bad, just when we've got to know you !' she exclaimed, with many pouts. ' And it is hard on you ; for now you say you're sorry to be turned away, and I can see you are.' Her eyes were sweetly sympathetic. He sighed him self, perhaps unconsciously. ' Ah, there, it is a shame !' she cried, her face straining on his. ' It's cruel of him to send you back like this so soon, before you're strong again. As if anyone couldn't see you're not half-well yet, or you'd have more colour, and so thin besides. You're nothing like recovered. What a shame ! I wish that I could talk with him, I'd let him know ! Why, to go back now to that horrid place will kill you, that it will. Oh, how I wish I could do something to prevent it !' There was a genuine sympathy and tenderness \u2014 at least, so he thought \u2014 in her tone, such as he had little expected from one of apparently so light a disposition. He was much struck, and observed her closely, as far as the dim starlight let him. And as he gazed a strange thrill ran through him, a revelation of possibilities un weighed by him, and which hitherto in his life had come but seldom to him, and then had been invariably shunned, not faced. And besides, on such occasions had not the tender looks and words, which otherwise to his susceptible soul were fraught with danger, had they not come mingled with the adoration and respect that to his priestly character were due, thereby remind-"], [27, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 19 ing of it, giving the wound and remedy with the same sure hand ? Whereas now this girl's sympathy, her marked interest, seemed to him shorn of any the like safeguards, to be given spontaneously and on equal terms as girl to man. It seemed that her regret over his departure for the gloomy town was quite inde pendent of the nature of his employment in it, and that, for all it weighed with her, he might be returning to a stool and desk in a dusty ledger-laden centre of commercial bustle, instead of to the altar and the offices of holy Church and the bedside of the sick. Somehow, for his own sake, he felt he must enlighten her. ' I am very grateful to you for your sympathy,1 he said ; ' but you must not make me think too much of this mere matter of my bodily health. That, I am glad to say, is sufficiently restored for all purposes And it is, perhaps, not well for him who has to cany consolations unto others to appear too comfortably secure from suffering himself. I am a clergyman,' he said. ' Ah !' she exclaimed softly, as though with apprecia tion of a fact she had well-nigh forgotten, 'quite so. But still,1 she went on, ' you say yourself you had to come away because you broke down. That will occur again.1 ' And if it does, it must,' said he. ' If it would bring you here once more I should be glad of it ; but now, of course, it won't.' ' I fear not,' he said. ' And yet, who knows ? Our rector may regret me.' ' Oh, I do hope he will, I hope he will !' she cried. 2\u20142"], [28, "20 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH He looked at her with some alarm. Did the thought just for a moment visit him, that should some day the rector of Great Marley in penitence request him to return, granting his every wish, he still would do well to refuse ? At any rate, he felt it some assur ance to reply with force : ' And I am sure that he will not.' ' He is a wretch !' she cried. ' No, no ; he acts according to his lights.' ' Then, certainly, they must be very feeble ones,' she answered. ' So may not mine become !' he murmured. But she caught the words. ' What did you say ? What ? So may not yours ? What did you mean ?' She laid her hand upon his arm, and, strangely enough, he found that he could not resent the liberty. He stood quite still, absorbed in a new feeling. But presently he started. ' I hear a step,1 he said. ' GoocUnight ! I must \u2014 I must be off ;' and hurriedly he pushed forward to the gate once more. This time obediently she raised the latch and let him through. ' Good-night, and come, do, soon again,' she said. He only raised his hat and strode hastily away."], [29, "CHAPTER III. Edgar Mayland hurried on with swinging steps. He passed the great front gate of the wide churchyard without once even looking up at the silent face of the old edifice, black and looming down the broad avenue of elms leading thereto. He strode on more briskly still down the long incline, at the foot of which the little village or hamlet of Great Marley stood, and crossing over, when nearly at the bottom, to the left side of the road, approached the line of red brick tene ments which formed its western outposts. At one of these he stopped, and opening the small wicket-gate which closed upon a tiny plot of unkempt garden ground, stepped up to the door and rapped with his knuckles thereupon. The window to the right of him was shuttered now, but he knew that in the daytime it disclosed a neat dis play of sweets and petty grocery, to which that door stood continually wide open for such seldom customers as might come by. But at this hour of the night the only evidence that the house was one not entirely devoted to private use was a dark, oblong opening, clearly visible in one of the shutters near to hand, evidently intended for the reception of letters, for above it and below it in"], [30, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 22 black characters were the words, faintly decipherable even at night, ' POST OFFICE.' ' Clearance,' etc., in smaller letters below. He rapped again impatiently ; but before his summons met with any response, a strong and somewhat heavy step approached behind him, and a figure in black, with a broad-brimmed, soft felt hat, swung through the gate and came towards him. ' Why, what a pace you went at P cried the new comer. ' Have been after you right down from the Church Farm.' ' Simeon !' exclaimed Mayland. ' Now, I thought I heard footsteps behind me.' 'And were anxious to escape them, it seemed to me,1 said the other. ' I hope not,1 said Mayland. But a guilty remembrance of the alarm with which he had parted company at the rickyard-gate assailed him as he spoke. ' Hope not ! So do I,1 returned Simeon Jebb, with an intonation that sounded not a trifle serious, and quite shocked his friend. ' Well, knock again and let's get in ;' and, without waiting for his companion to obey, he struck his own fist on the door with a vigour fit to burst it open. ' When will that woman string up a bell ?' he muttered, as at the same moment the door fell back, and a kindly, comfortable-looking female of about forty years of age appeared, making herself as small as possible against the wall of the narrow little vestibule for her two lodgers to come in. She greeted them both with a cheery civility as they passed by her ; but it was easy to see on which of the"], [31, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 23 two she smiled the kindliest. And he, Edgar Mayland, stopped before her, while the other went brusquely on, and taking the staircase at three to a step, made for a room above. ' I hope Georgie is better, Mrs. Merritt ; but I am afraid it was the gooseberries,' he said, shaking his head with a smile. ' Yes, sir, he's that incautious, is Georgie ; he takes no sort o' care. I don't know when he'll get prudenter. But thank you kindly, sir ; he's better now and gone to bed.' ' Ah, I'm afraid he is a martyr to too much health,' returned the curate with a laugh ; ' it's a sad thing to be so well. Prudence and pain, they come together.1 ' Yes, sir, they do,' sighed Mrs. Merritt ; ' and ' \u2014 seeing him about to turn away \u2014 ' and I hope you'll find your supper right, sir; it's been laid this two hours.' 'Thank you, thank you, no doubt of it. Good night ;' and with another smile and a nod he moved on upstairs after his friend. He opened the door and entered beamingly. The Reverend Simeon Jebb was already seated at the table, and attacking lustily a piece of cold boiled bacon placed before him. ' Hungry, my friend ?' cried Mayland. ' And so you should be, like the labourer that you are !' ' \" Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn,\" ' said the other, without looking round, and hack ing off a hunch of bread from a small loaf by him. ' Yes, yes,1 returned Mayland, ' it is true ; arise and eat.1"], [32, "24 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH ' Or rather, sit down and do likewise,' answered Jebb, filling his mouth. ' My dear friend,1 said Mayland gravely, ' I would rather you didn't speak like that, though I know you do not mean it. There are some things we may not joke about.' ' No joking about it, Mayland ; in real earnest. If I did not sit down to something soon, I should be a dead man. I've spent the evening at the Rectory, and you know what that means.1 ' Indeed I1 ' Of course,1 he went on \u2014 ' of course, they were dining when I got there, and I was turned into the study, and wasn't even asked to lick the plates as they left the room. I merely sat and sniffed. Presently he comes limping in, hopes he hasn't kept me waiting, wipes his mouth, drops into the best chair, keeps me over accounts for two mortal hours, and sends me starving at the end of it, without so much as a cup of coffee or a scrap of seed-cake, on an illiberal mission to an old woman at Wood End. Is not that muzzling the ox ?' Edgar Mayland smiled sympathetically, though his friend's tone was hardly to his taste. ' Yes,' he said, ' I am afraid hospitality is not our rector's strong point.' ' I should rather think it was not,' replied Jebb. ' A full habit, and a fine way of making others careful of it, and feel it a favour to be allowed to do so \u2014 those, I take it, are his strong points ; and very comfortable ones they are.' ' I do not think we should speak of him like that, Simeon,' said Mayland. ' While we are here he is, at"], [33, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 25 any rate, our superior before God ; and though we may differ from him, we should think of him only with respect. And, besides, we should remember that our complaint has been, not that he leaves us to do the work, but that, on the contrary, he refuses to let us do it, to do it thoroughly, as our conscience tells us it should be done. Is not that so ?' 'True, true,' returned the other, with a gesture of impatience ; ' so let him rest. But hast thou supped thyself ? Why sittest thou there, then ? Arise and eat, if thou wilt have it so, but eat.' Without other response than a weak smile, Mayland drew up the chair into which he had dropped, and breaking off a small crust of bread and cutting a slice of cheese, slowly commenced eating. But as he filled his mouth he kept his eyes fixed upon his companion, ruminating on the mysteries of a nature so unlike his own, and yet devoted to the same ends. And the more he thought about it all, the more he was filled with wonder and awe at the strange ways of God, and the infinite incongruity of souls He summons to His aid. The young man before him had, to all appearances, not yet passed his twenty-fifth year, though, from where he sat, on the other side of the little round table, his broad shoulders, square head, and bull neck indi cated a man of solid constitution and great frame. Mayland knew that, on standing up, this effect of massiveness was somewhat spoiled, not only by the ex treme shortness of his legs, which reduced his height below the average, but also by their apparent spare ness in proportion to the full development of the body they had to bear, and their rather rickety manner of"], [34, "26 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH progression. His hair was dark and cut extremely short, his face all over was the same full colour, the neck likewise ; his strong beard was not too closely shaven, and showed dark over the great jaws as they worked with the determination of hunger and good teeth. His cloth by daylight showed a shade of green, and where it touched his neck over the low collar was not suspicionless of grease. His hands were large and bronzed, and seemed more fitted for the spade than for the pen. AU such was Simeon Jebb, yet, in spite of an ex terior so little charming, a certain broad bonhomie, lit up by an intelligence of sound dimensions, and a humorous twinkle of the small brown eyes, together made a personality not wholly without friendly interest, and even capable of inspiring in some simple natures a sentiment of frank respect. Among these last was Edgar Mayland. ' Yes,' he said to himself as he regarded him \u2014 ' yes, my brother, we are cast of different stuff; but I wish that I were as sure my substance were as free of flaws as I know thine to be. Good old Simeon ! Work and eat!1 At last the object of his kind objurgations put down his knife and fork with a clatter, pushed away his plate, and pouring out the last drop of thin cider in the jug beside him, which his companion had not touched, turned round in his chair and crossed his legs with a groan. ' That's better,' he said. ' I am glad you find it so,1 replied Mayland with a laugh."], [35, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 27 ' Well, yes, I do,1 said Jebb. ' But you have legs P Mayland started. His friend's tone recalled that with which he had that evening first accosted him. ' I am sorry. I did not know you were behind me,1 he said meekly. ' Well, I must say you were rather in a hurry. May I ask whence ?' ' Certainly, my friend. You have a right to know everything I do,1 said Mayland. ' Indeed I1 said the other suspiciously ; ' so what's up now ?' ' New acquaintances, that's all. I have been to the Church Farm.' ' How was that ?' asked Simeon sharply. ' Ah !' said Mayland, with a nervous little laugh, ' I knew you would be upset if I encroached on your domain.' ' Well, it was your own choice, you know,' returned Jebb ; ' you undertook the cottagers and poorer folk, and I said I'd go the round of the farmers. You know you said you didn't feel at ease with them, and I didn't mind ; all's the same to me.' ' I know it, Simeon, and I adhere to my choice. This was a pure accident this evening. Mr. Somers literally dragged me in.' ' But then you ran into his net.' ' Well, one does that always when one visits the church. The place is so close.' ' H'm !' grunted the other, and there was silence for a minute or so. ' You find you must turn in there every evening ?' presently he asked. ' I find it a great comfort, Simeon,' replied Mayland."], [36, "28 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH ' Queer. I don't. How do you account for it ?' ' You forget,' said the other, ' the great difference in our ' \u2014 he was going to say ' in our bringing up,' but he stopped short ; he always wished to avoid references to the superior advantages he had enjoyed, lest they might hurt his friend's feelings \u2014 ' in our dispositions and character,' he went on. ' My dear friend, you yourself must see that, though we work to the same ends, we are as unlike as God could make us : you, strong and self-reliant, an Elijah upon the hills with Him alone, and happy so to be ; and I, weak, trembling, a Timothy in the faith, backsliding, needing continual confirmation and support, yearning to get a peep of the heaven I fear no longer may be near me, a thing, perhaps, of the imagination merely, even ' ' Edgar Mayland !' exclaimed Simeon in a voice of stern reproof. ' It is so, Simeon. Be my confessor \u2014 let me tell it you. And that is why I must from time to time, even in the course of one short day, find myself within the walls of God's house ; for there alone in that silent stillness, with all the emblems and the means of worship round me, I feel my faith restored in the noble evidence before my eyes that others share it. I see the stalls all full of kneeling forms, I hear the great notes of the organ rising to the timbered roof; I live over again the rapture of the Sabbath morn, and forget that it is only one in seven. All days thus become alike to me ; other wise these six were longer than I well could bear.' Simeon Jebb sat motionless whilst the other spoke, though he cast an eye towards him once and again in grave mistrust. A change seemed to have taken place"], [37, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 29 in their relationship. He who some time before was the reproved seemed now reprover, and that, not for a mere slip of a too jovial tongue, but for a far deeper and more unhealable \u2014 a feeble faith. But when May land had finished, he appeared to have no word to say for the expression of his disapproval, or for the conso lation of his friend's infirmity, but sat merely with vacant looks, tapping his fingers on a plate near him, while the other waited for his words with earnest, anxious eyes. However, presently he spoke. ' And so you went in ?' ' The church ?' ' No ; to the Somers'.' ' Oh yes ; I had no alternative, he pressed so. He seems a most kindhearted man. Though he is warden, I have hardly spoken three words with him before ; but, of course, you know him well ?' ' I used to.' ' What ! Has there been anything amiss ? She told me you never called now.' ' She did, did she ?' ' But why is it ? You surely should go.' ' My dear Mayland, what need, if you go for me ?' The other regarded him closely. Presently he said : ' You know Miss Somers ? What do you think of her?' ' Why do you want to know ?' ' Because you are my friend, and I prize your opinion upon all things.' ' It is not worth having in the matter of women,' answered Jebb ; ' and besides, I thought we were agreed that that was terra periculosa f ' True, Simeon, but only in the bodily sense, as beings"], [38, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 30 of flesh and blood, did we mean that. As souls they are as much our charge as any other, and must needs be studied ; or how else can we help them ? This one seems to me especially to require it.' ' Indeed !' ' It is a young woman of naive and open tempera ment, and, I fancy, sympathetic, also innocent.' ' You seem to have conscientiously examined her,' said Simeon. ' I had an exceptional opportunity,' returned May land. ' She accompanied me to the gate, and we con versed freely. I found her all I have told you.' ' And nothing else ?' ' No. What ?' ' That, soon enough.' ' What ?' ' Well, shall we say coquette ?' ' My dear Simeon !' exclaimed Mayland, flushing, ' You entirely misconceive me. Our intercourse, as I should have thought you would have known, was of a character with which that term would be wholly un connected. You cannot mean it !' ' I mean it, every word,' he answered. ' In that case, Simeon, I have nothing more to say about her.' ' It might be just as well,' said Jebb, rising. ' Come, I'm off ! What say you ?' and striking a match, he lit a candle and left the room without another word. Edgar Mayland followed his friend's departure with eyes of pained amazement. But though not a shrewd man or profound, he was not so dull as not slowly to appraise the meaning of his most unwonted manner. A"], [39, "A COMEDY\" OF THE CLOTH 31 past chapter in his friend's life-story stood revealed to him, and one that had been written not so long ago. He had been in love, and his love had not gone well. And the object of his passion had been that very same young person whose acquaintance he, Mayland, had made so unexpectedly that same night, and whose name he had but just so fortuitously introduced as a subject of impartial conversation \u2014 to him, the rejected one, whose jealousy of his friend's superior luck in being able to go where he could not was as transparent as it was absurd. Yes, this was all now as clear as day, for which, if confirmation were wanted, it was to be found in the otherwise inexplicable abstention from the precincts of the Church Farm on his friend's part, to say nothing of the qualified references to his name on the part of the good farmer and his wife, and the girl's own evident interest in his doings, half reluctantly expressed, but none the less distinct. And did not this last indicate in no unhopeful manner that her refusal of his friend was not entirely her own heart's choice, that pressure had been brought to bear upon her, most probably by the mother, in view of poor Simeon's slender eighty pounds a year, and that she still clung to his remem brance and the unconscious hope that time might bring him to her feet again ? Edgar Mayland felt a flush of pride in his own acumen as he put and answered promptly that sug gestion. ' And what is more,' said he to himself, as he sat there transfixed with the brilliancy of his discovery \u2014 ' what is more, I now see why she was so singularly"], [40, "32 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH pressing for me to remain here. Of course, she knows I am his friend, living together as we do, and that through me there is a chance of at least hearing some thing of him, and perhaps even of sending him some indication of the hold he still possesses on her heart. Whereas, if I left, and the rector reverted once again to a single curate, all hope of communication would be quite cut off from her ; for it seems certain that Simeon is forbidden the house. Yes, I have hit on it. I see it all now. And who knows that I shall not meet her wishes ? Who says that I shall not stay on and do him, my friend, a good turn in his hour of need \u2014 a service at once just and innocent and well deserved ? For it is clear he loves her desperately as ever. And the love of such a man as he is not a thing for one to be ashamed of aiding. Poor, is he ? Rich I call him \u2014 rich in forcefulness and faith, and honest sense. And what does any girl want more ? What, indeed ! Simeon, I mean to let them see I know it !' Edgar Mayland rose also, and extinguishing the lamp, moved off to his own chamber with a joyful smile."], [41, "CHAPTER IV. It was later than usual that night that Mr. George Merritt, senior, retired to rest. He had come in moody and silent, and had exchanged scarce half a dozen words with his spouse whilst he put out of sight the ' bit o' supper' she had ready for him. Finding him in no sociable mood, she had left him soon to his own reflec tions, only waiting, as was her invariable custom, until she had heard each of the gentlemen above, her lodgers, safe in their respective rooms. And so it happened that she was in bed and half asleep before she heard his slow footstep \u2014 one foot at a time \u2014 come climbing up the uncarpeted stairs, and vexing her with fear lest it should disturb those young men as he passed, now possibly in their first sleep. George Merritt was by trade a thatcher, in the pursuit of which industry he had, many years before, come by a bad fall which had broken his thigh-bone, and, being badly set, had left him with a crab-like limp, which apparently should have prevented him from ever mounting a ladder again. But necessity having no laws, George Merritt had laughed at such a possibility, and, plucky fellow that he was, had managed still to keep in his hands the monopoly of such work as the 3"], [42, "34 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH parish could provide. But he performed it painfully and laboriously ; and his wife's good heart often bled for him as she watched him limping off to his frequently distant labour ; and now to-night, as she listened to his noisy steps, pity and tender sympathy mingled with the annoyance that otherwise it caused her. It was a long ascent ; for the Merritt household were, during the night, crammed into the attic story of the little house, the three rooms on the first floor being let to the two lodgers as bedrooms and common sitting room. But he arrived at last, and slowly opened the door of the tiny chamber with the low, sloping ceiling over it, but which had been made as cheery and bright as possible by the good woman's care, so that her husband should not feel too much the loss of his room below, which the acceptance of a second lodger had occasioned. He entered and closed the door after him with care. Mrs. Merritt sat up in bed and greeted him. 'So you've come at length, George. I was afeard you'd gone to sleep down there.' ' Sleep ? No,' he returned. ' I bain't in form for sleepin'. I've got summut to think about, I 'ave.' ' What's that, George ?' cried his wife, her ears alive on the instant. ' Nothin's 'appened ?' ' Yes, Betsy, my girl,1 he replied, with studied gravity ; ' summut \"as, summut 'as.' ' You've not been and had words with Mrs. French, now ?' she asked, with sharp anxiety. ' You can leave that to me, Betsy,' he replied. ' Little as I like 'er, I ain't such a fool as that.' ' What is it, then ? Why don't you speak ?' She"], [43, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 35 sat bolt upright now, anxiously questioning him with her eyes.

However, she slipped out of bed and moved softly to the little paper-covered door in the wall of the room, which opened into a big square cupboard for holding boxes and other lumber, and which had been turned into an impromptu bedroom for the nine-year-old lad, who had been born to the middle-aged couple long after their other children had grown up and left them. The door had not been close shut, for ventilation's sake, and the good woman, as she approached, had a quite natural fear lest their talk might have wakened the small man up, especially as he had retired to rest with a bad attack of stomach-ache brought on by a too free indulgence in the unripe produce of their own and neighbour's gardens. Her alarm was not lessened when, as she opened the door, she thought she heard a movement of some sort within. However, she was soon relieved. Georgie slept the sleep of innocence, and did not appear to be even dreaming, as he well deserved to be, that he was caught by the hand in the middle of a great gooseberry-bush armed with big prickles of vicious and quite peculiar ferocity, and that it was a plain case of amputation if he was ever to be set free. She stepped back gently, and, with a warning gesture to her husband, retired once more to rest."], [47, "CHAPTER V. The two curates did not see much of each other during the day, their work, as we have heard, being kept apart by common consent \u2014 Jebb retaining his rounds among the farmers and residential folk of the better class, and Mayland taking in charge the poorer labourers and village folk, and also the entire care of the distant village or hamlet of Longleigh, which, with a chapel of-ease, was a part, and an important part, of their parish. To balance the apparently larger share of work which this last charge entailed, Simeon Jebb had undertaken the conduct of all matters of business with the rector, duties from which, for various reasons, Mayland was glad to be relieved. Three days out of six the latter departed soon after breakfast for his distant cure, from whence he would not return until evening; whereby as often, his friend and colleague missed his company for the principal mid-day meal, and for the five o'clock tea as well. So it was mostly after nightfall, when their work was done, that, in their common room together, they had formed that intimacy which, on one side at least, was heartfelt and sincere. Now, it so happened that the day following that"], [48, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 40 evening of insight into his friend's heart on the part of Edgar Mayland was one of those three aforesaid; and the hamlet in question lying some three or four miles along the river bank, his path lay through the lush meadows there beside, from which on his way he had almost invariably turned up toward the church, which stood upon the rising ground scarce out of flood's way, to the right, and entering by the gate into the graveyard at its lower end, he had gone on into the sacred edifice itself, carrying with him, as was his wont, the large key of the porch that stood upon the side towards the homestead of the Church Farm. And there in its solemn silence he had been accustomed, as he himself has above explained, to gather in some minutes' prayer and meditation sufficient comfort and assurance for the day's work before him. But now, on this particular day he took a different course. On issuing from his lodging, instead of turning to the left to gain the bridge and the stile which led down to the stream, he moved off in the same direction to the right by which we watched him returning home the night before \u2014 by the main highway which rose up the long slope towards the church and the Church Farm house \u2014 and entered the churchyard by the great front-gate, a proceeding almost without precedent on his part, for reasons that we think have been already given. Why, then, for the first time now ? One answer he gave himself was the unsatisfactory condition of the other entrance, the ground having recently become very wet and rotten after heavy rain. But he knew that that was not the sole one, and was"], [49, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 41 not sufficient to explain so considerable a diversion from the nearest route to his destination, the hamlet four miles off, as this was. It was true that by the lane which ran down before the Church Farm house he could regain the meadows without either wading through the wet ground or returning through the village, but even then he knew that more than half a mile was added to the distance reckoned by his usual route. Some other explanation, therefore, was forth coming. He confessed it \u2014 his resolution of the night before. But to put it into execution was no easy thing, and the morning light brought no access of confidence. Y^et it remained. How then ? As he thought of it, he grew well aware that to act as a medium of reconciliation in the manner he had at first conceived was a very delicate undertaking. For he had no means whatever of meeting the girl except by visits to the farmhouse itself, which he could hardly do without Simeon knowing it, and then the jealousy which the latter had shown at the admission of another where he himself was barred would become intensified, and before he, Mayland, would have had opportunity to test the girl's sentiments might bring about a catastrophe of despair in his friend's heart that might undo all the good that he was working for. And to lie in wait for the girl outside her father's house in lanes and fields where he remembered now to have more than once passed her was not only repugnant to his sense of straightness, but would, if oft repeated, expose himself to the malice of gossiping tongues, which, little as he might mind it himself, would certainly ere long reach Simeon's ears, with the same sad result."], [50, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 42 It was indeed a difficult matter. Then he wondered how it was, seeing the proximity of the farmhouse to the church, in his almost daily visits to the latter he had never, at any time, caught sight of her within the precincts of the former. But he called to mind that he had constantly approached the church from the back end, and that it was only by the broad walk that led from the main highway that a full view of the farm premises was obtainable over the long, low wall which separated the churchyard from them, whereas, by the other way, the little path, except where it approached the small side-porch, was almost entirely screened by an overgrowth of greenery, of lilac and laburnum, and broad, bushy cobnut-trees. A sufficient explanation. For almost the first time during the three months he had been in the parish he had chosen the other route. And as he moved up the broad avenue of elms and turned to the right to gain that side-entrance to which alone he had a key, he found his thoughts, also for the first time, were fixed on something else than the condi tion of his soul, and its preparedness for administering to those of others. They were contemplating the possi bility of a girlish form somewhere amongst the medley of stacks, barns, and buildings of all shapes which clustered round the back of the square brick farmhouse. His eyes were running keenly over these. But, except for the figure of a man, whom he did not recognise, operating on the roof of one of the great haystacks, and innumerable poultry of all descriptions chuckling and scratching among the universal litter of loose straw, no life was visible."], [51, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 43 With a growing sense of the impossibility of his self-imposed task, he passed round to the porch and entered the church. But immediately inside, he realized the difference of his mental state that day compared with formerly ; the image of a fair head and blue eyes was on his brain, and prayer was far from him. With a sigh, and assuring himself of the sincerity of his undertaking, of his simple sympathy for his poor friend, whose whole happiness in life might possibly hang upon his care, he issued out again into the bright morning air, locking the door behind him, and proceed ing briskly back to the highroad, he turned to the left and then down the small lane aforesaid by the farm house front, and thence on to Longleigh. And what of her, the possessor of that fair head and blue eyes so altruistically impressed on the imagination of the Rev. Edgar Mayland, and so difficult in their charming reality to meet once more ? Polly Somers, as the reader may have guessed, was not a little spoilt, and not a little petulant and incon siderate in consequence. Not that she was a girl without a heart, but the possession of a pretty face and an attractive personality, combined with the adoring tenderness of parents, and all amongst whom she had been brought up, was inclined to bring forgetfulness that there were others not so blessed ; and that even to her some share of the world's crosses were likely to be due ; and that even if she had escaped them so far, the access of a new era \u2014 the era of love \u2014 might safely be relied on to bring them in its train. And so, when the fine young fellow to whom she had given her heart from the very first, and who seemed"], [52, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 44 only to have arrived upon the scene just when wanted, to be one step more in the unbroken happiness of her young life \u2014 when this young man, just when he had finally come to feel assured of her, after a playful inter lude of coyness to which she had treated him, and which had never for a moment hidden her real feelings, actually hesitated to promise that he would give the mother with whom he lived notice to quit his house before his young bride entered it, at this first hindrance in her path of perfect bliss a little hurricane of indignation took possession of her ; and she spoke such passionate words that young Tom French forgot how much he loved her, and answered back in such high dudgeon as left him nothing else but to bid good-bye and ride away till such time as one or other of them should get sensible once more, and plead forgiveness. And this one most certainly was he, though he delayed and hesitated how to set about his reconcilia tion. She, on the other hand, was by no means so soon pacified ; and indeed she told herself over and over again that she meant every word that she had said, and that she hoped he would never come near her again till he had recognised his folly and obstinacy to their fullest extent. But, in the meantime, she was not guiltless of a wish to hasten his enlightenment ; and to her woman's mind, of course, the simplest and promptest means thereto was to excite his jealousy. But, unfortunately, this was not easy ; for her virtual acceptance of the well-to do young farmer, though not absolutely confirmed, was a fact well known to that countryside, and was sufficient"], [53, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 45 to prevent other admirers from hovering near whose attentions now would be most serviceable. In this dilemma, she was put in mind of the two curates, the only mankind now readily accessible to her, by the accidental visit of one of them, Edgar Mayland ; and, with a wickedness quite startling in such an ap parently simple nature, and which can only be explained by -the proverbial selfishness of suffering hearts, she at once resolved to turn them to account, if possible. But here again were obstacles, for with Simeon Jebb she had already had an experience not too pleasant ; and though, when the crisis came, she had treated him tenderly, still, it was a treatment, under her parents' pressure, none the less decisive ; and there was every reason to believe that he was by this time quite beyond recall. And as for this other, why, on the face of it, he was a man too removed among the saints to lightly listen to the voice of any earthly charmer, much less to one, as she well knew herself to be, of quite another plane of life and thought and education. But, still, impracticable himself, might he not yet be used to open negotiations with the former, to bring the broken-hearted Jebb once more upon the scene, or, at least, to get an inkling of the sentiments which now possessed him, and by which she hoped to profit ? She did not in as many words suggest this, but she more or less vaguely felt it ; and, in spite of the repug nance of her better nature, wild with the wish to find a fitting punishment for the intractable Tom, she set herself to act on it. But how ? Clearly, to learn something of the ways"], [54, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 46 and habits of this creature who was to be her tool \u2014 that was the first necessity. And so, about a week after that first visit of Edgar Mayland's to the Church Farm house, she put on her broad-brimmed straw-hat with its blue trimming that went so sweetly with her golden hair, and dropped down on the village post-office for the ostensible purchase of stamps and other trifles. Master George Merritt was behind the counter serving a bunch of halfpenny dips to another village urchin as she entered the small room, originally parlour, now converted into an extem pore shop, with shelves and stands for canisters and bottles. On seeing her, he dumped down the goods before his customer with precipitation, and, not even stopping to pick up the pence she had deposited upon the counter. fled to a little window which had been let into the back wall of the room, and screeched at the top of his voice : ' Mother, 'ere's Miss Polly ; 'er's 'ere !' So exuberant an announcement must inform the reader that Miss Somers' presence was of no common interest to Mrs. Merritt and her son. And that was true. Mrs. Merritt, like her good husband, had dwelt in that parish all her days, and her interest in and know ledge of its inhabitants were equally acute. But there was not one who shared so much of her head and heart as Polly Somers. From the earliest days, when the bright little girl used to run down to her shop for pennyworths of sucks, and the good woman would lift her in her arms and kiss her, and give her very full weight indeed in the little sugarloaf paper packet,"], [55, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 47 while the child's large blue eyes grew greater than ever to see the skill with which she rolled it up and tucked it in, she had watched over her with a motherly interest and genuine love, of which we are afraid Miss Polly never was aware, or, if she was, never did anything to repay. And so you may be sure that Mrs. Merritt was not the last to hear of a certain love affair, and discuss it freely and not altogether contentedly. For the clear sighted woman saw ahead the trouble betwixt the young couple that the presence of Mrs. French would occa sion ; and, knowing well the influence that that bustling person had upon her son, she foresaw the certainty that there would be a struggle ere she quitted the roof she had so long lived under, and the unhappiness of Polly in the meanwhile. Therefore, when her husband brought her news of a new love, she was by no means so displeased as she assumed ; and her dissatisfaction was not increased by her own very warm feeling for her new lodger, whose tenderness and sympathy shone in marked relief against the burly indifference of the old one. In fact, the news filled the good woman with the liveliest excitement, and made her long for more, particularly a word from Polly herself, in confirmation. She had expressly ordered Georgie, who was spending the fortnight's vacation given each summer to the members of the parish school in serving customers, also himself, with groceries and small confectionery, to let her know upon the instant if, by chance, when she was away, the object of her interest should come into the shop. At his summons, she entered from the passage with a"], [56, "48 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH beaming face. The little girl with her dips at the same time curtsied to Polly and slipped out. ' My dear !' exclaimed Mrs. Merritt, shaking hands with the familiarity of an old friend, ' what a time it is since you've been in 'ere ! An' I've been lookin' out for you day in, day out !' Then, remembering the boy, ' Georgie,' she said, ' I thought you was goin' to see to that 'encoop ? Well, go at once, you naughty boy ; d'you 'ear ?' For Master Georgie was by no means inclined to be excluded from a tete-a-tete which he was well aware was in prospect on matters of which he already had information, with a thirst for more. ' D'you 'ear me, Georgie ?' she repeated. Georgie moved to the door sheepishly and passed out, but his figure was still half-seen behind the jambs. His mother advanced upon him smartly with a ringing box of the ears for her first intention. But Georgie, in the face of so much resolution, seeing that compromise for once was not allowed him, turned and fled. His mother came back into the shop and found Polly blush ing ; for the girl knew Master Georgie well, and sus pected his interest was personal to her. ' Naughty boy !' exclaimed Mrs. Merritt. ' But 'e's that sharp, 'e's beyond 'is years, 'e is. There's no keepin' nothin' from 'im. And now, my dear' \u2014 dropping her voice \u2014 ' tell me all about it.' Polly regarded her questioner for a moment. She was uncertain what she knew. ' So now you're rid of 'im ? An' a good thing too, my dear.' ' Do you think so ?' said Polly, not too pleased. 'Why, yes, I do, my dear \u2014 I should think I do."], [57, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 49 That there woman would 'a been a thorn i' your side till your dyin' day.' Polly sighed deeply. 'But you ain't regrettin' it surely, Miss Polly ?' ' Perhaps, Betsy.' ' What ! As if this gen'l'man wasn't worth two of 'im!' Polly opened those blue eyes of hers wide. ' What gentleman ?' ' Ah, now, now, my dear ! come, that won't do now. We know things as has 'appened,' said the good woman, shaking her head kindly. ' Come, now.' Polly naturally thought that it was her episode with Simeon Jebb that had at last leaked out in some distorted shape or other, and had as promptly been assumed by the good woman to be the cause of her rupture with Tom French. How absurd ! And yet, after all, was it not concerning the sentiments of this very gentleman that she was in that shop that day ? She would be discreet and learn. ' He doesn't care for me,' she said. ' Doesn't 'e ? I knows better than that \u2014 and you, miss.' ' What do you know about him, Betsy ?' ' More things than one, my dear. I' the first place, I knows 'im for the kindest-'earted, most considerin' gen'l'man as I've come across since I was born. That's one thing, eh, my dear ?' Polly stared with astonishment. 'An' a good deal, I think,' went on Mrs. Merritt, ' an' I knows I've felt it in a way that t'other's never made me, never. Not that I've any fault to find with 'im, not the least bit. 'E pays up reg'lar week in 4"], [58, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 50 week out, an' don't grumble, an' eats his victuals as a man should, as though 'e relished 'em, which is the one only thing as I find fault with in Mr. Mayland, as 'e picks 'is food, though 'e never utters not a breath of unsatisfaction like, not 'e ; still, 'e don't eat 'earty. But that's no matter ; I know summun who'll soon teach 'im better nor that.' And she smiled and nodded at her visitor. ' And then, as I was sayin', put 'im beside that other ; well, comparisons, they say, is odious, but all I knows is Mr. Jebb ain't fit to lace 'is shoes.' Polly dropped into a chair and took off her hat. The morning was warm, the air of the shop smelt of soft soap and cheese, with a touch of the aroma of the tallow-candle. What could it all mean ? ' You're lucky to have such a good lodger at last,' she said. ' An' you're lucky, my dear, to 'ave such a good lover,' returned the other, in low tones, bending down to her. ' Betsy Merritt !' exclaimed Polly, jumping up again. ' You really are too extraordinary !' Mrs. Merritt drew herself back and assumed an air of reproach. ' Miss Polly,' she said gravely, ' this ain't treatin' old friends as they expects to be treated. I 'ad thought as I should 'a' been one o' the first to be told o' things ; but I must take the disappointment, it seems. An1 seein1 I've to be kep1 dark, I must 'arken for myself, I must.' ' What have you heard ?' ' I've 'eard what my 'usband's telled me, for one thing, an' 'is word's good enough for me, miss.

Don't I know ? Can't I see ? No, miss, Betsy Merritt's no' so dull as that.' .Polly had listened with a growing calmness as the good woman spoke, and all the time her brain was working busily on this new scheme of things unfolding for her. When the other had finished, she fixed her hat on her head again, and held out her round little hand. ' Good-bye, Betsy,' she said, with a smile, ' and if you don't think much of me, don't tell him.' ' Miss Polly ! My dear !' exclaimed her old friend, stepping towards her, with arms as if ready to embrace her. ' My dear ! An' you can doubt it !' But Polly seized her hand and shook it, and with a laugh escaped into the open. 4\u20142"], [60, "CHAPTER VI. Mrs. Hargreaves, the wife of the rector of Great Marley, had many admirers. Not the least among these was Mr. Somers, of the Church Farm. ' What a woman that is !' he would say to his wife. ' Look how she carries herself, straight an' lithe as a saplin' ash. And smart, too, every bit as the best of 'em. I declare Sir Henry's wife wasn't worth lookin' at beside her as they come out o' church, neither in looks nor walk.' ' I can't think how she came to marry the rector,' his wife would answer, ' such a dead log as he is.' But Mr. Somers disliked strongly any depreciation of those he felt it his duty to look up to. ' No, no,' he would reply, ' she could have done worse than him, though he is near twice her age, an' gouty. The rector's a man of breed. He comes o' the upper ten, and you soon know it when you're with him. And, besides, he's got the cash \u2014 folks say fourteen hundred a year or thereabouts.' 'Which the parish don't see much of,' she inter posed. ' Ah well, ah well, I've known worse,' was all he could reply to that ; and then he would let the subject drop, as serving no good purpose."], [61, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 53 It was true that most people would have agreed with Mrs. Somers if they could have seen the rector and his wife as they sat in the large, cool dining-room of the Rectory on a certain July afternoon, and would have wondered greatly how that graceful and still charming woman of thirty-five, reclining in the low rocking-chair at the open window, with a book upon her knees, could have thrown herself away upon the heavy-bearded dyspeptic of near twice her age who sat sluggishly in his armchair on the far side of the room, with one of his large feet slippered and swathed on a chair before him, and lazily running over the columns of the morning's paper. But it is a question which, fortunately, does not concern us in this story in the least. Suffice it to say that they were there, and everything was quiet around them in the big house ; for of family they had none, and the maid-servants in that establishment were industrious and well-ordered to perfection. And from time to time the cooler air from the shaded side of the house came in through the open window and just touched those wisps of dark loose hair upon the lady's forehead, and even stirred the leaves of the journal in her husband's hand. Then at length he put it down ; but she kept her eyes fixed upon her page. He gave a grunt ; she still did not desist. He gave another, and then broke into speech. ' Somers promised to be here this afternoon, to discuss that drainage matter,' he said. ' Interesting subject,' said his wife, still reading. 'The dirty water from his pond is working its way into the churchyard,' he went on. ' Jebb says it's"], [62, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 54 over your boots at the lower end. It's impossible to get up to the church from the meadow side.' ' Mr. Mayland gets up that way,' she said. ' Oh, there is no saying where he won't get,' he answered. ' I know exactly where Mr. Jebb won't get,' she replied, laughing ; ' he won't get beyond a good dinner, if there's one to be had within half a mile of him.' ' My dear Margaret, you are mistaken \u2014 you really are. You listen to those twaddling, niggardly women who expect a man because he is a parson to walk across country in wind and rain and all weathers to look in on them and bring them news, and then when he just does not refuse to sit down with them as a man and a fellow-being, accuse him of gluttony and coming only for what he can get. And, besides, I have myself strong reason to think otherwise. Only the other night when he came in over the accounts he took care to arrive when dinner was finished, not as some curates we have had, who were always mistaking our dinner hour, and getting a good feed before they fell to work \u2014 no, quite the reverse ; and then a steadier, soberer fellow for the two hours' or more hard figures that followed I never want. No, you do him wrong. And who told you Mayland goes in that way ?' ' Mr. Somers. He has seen him often.' ' We don't want that kind of man here,' he answered \u2014 ' always fussing and fuming and wanting to get at work that isn't given him, and leaving undone ' ' No, no,' she interrupted, firing up ; ' that is not true.' The rector sighed. ' But, my dear Margaret,' he said, ' don't you see"], [63, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 55 what a position this conduct of his places me in ? Here is the work of this parish already too much for me, with the aid of one curate, and that a hard-working one ; so I procure another, and he, instead of seeing at the first glance that his primary duty is to relieve me, in my state of health, of still more of the burden and responsibility, immediately sets about creating fresh ones, and declares his conscience will not permit him to stay with me unless I consent thereto. If his conscience is so strangely ordered as all that, all I can say for my part is, \" Go, and good riddance !\" ' ' But he has promised to undertake it all himself, and Mr. Jebb supports him.' ' Does he ? He may do so under pressure from the other, being an amiable fellow ; but from what he let drop to me in private, I know better.' ' It is very mean of him then,' she said. ' Not so. Jebb has more consideration for me, my dear. He knows well that I cannot afford always to keep two curates ' \u2014 she laughed \u2014 ' and when I revert to a single one, all this extra work will fall on me. I am not able to bear it.' She sighed. 'It is a pity,' she said. ' Oh, here is Mr. Somers.' And she smiled and nodded to that very corpulent gentleman as he came slowly up the short drive, and raising his hat, approached the front - door. In a minute, he was ushered into the room. 'Ah, my friend,' said the rector, holding out his hand, but without stirring an inch from his chair ; ' so you've come.' n Mr. Somers took the hand silently, and bowed to the"], [64, "56 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH lady. He was always awed and nervous when he entered that house, with its rich, luxurious furnishings and formal atmosphere, so contrasted with the cosy and simple homeliness of the Church Farm house. And, to add to all this, he felt keenly that here were his superiors, the only two members of that much respected body known as ' the gentry ' with which, by reason of his official position as churchwarden, he was accustomed to come in contact. But the rector, though not inclined to forget that he was an earl's great-grandson, and who, in fact, in spite of his gout and general ungainliness, had always a distinctly aristocratic inbred air about him, had constantly exhibited towards John Somers an especial freedom, feeling, no doubt, safe in doing so on account of the bond of duty that drew them together. And this was always gratefully appreciated by the good hearted farmer ; and though it was not sufficient to set him thoroughly at his ease, yet considerably lessened the shy reluctance with which otherwise he would have paid such visits as the present one. After some preliminary talk on parish matters in general, the rector broached the subject which occa sioned this visit. ' So your duck-pond has overflowed its limits and wants to annex the churchyard also ? We shall have to take measures to restrain it. Whence comes this encroachment ?' 'Well, I don't exactly know, sir,' returned the farmer ; ' but I imagine some sort o' a spring must have broke out in it. Never did it afore since I've been here, and that's twenty year or more.'"], [65, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 57 ' No,' said the rector, ' quite so ; 'tis an innovation, and we must suppress it, Mr. Somers. We want no innovations in this parish' \u2014 this with a look at his wife. The farmer looked a trifle puzzled by the rector's tone; he sought relief, however, in a fit of sneezing and the use of his red pocket-handkerchief. ' So they tell me the lower side of the churchyard has become quite rotten in consequence, and quite impassable that way. Is that so ?' ' Well, I believe it is, sir. I haven't been exactly in there myself, but I'm told it's bad enough. So much so, that Mr. Mayland, the new gentleman as was wont to come in that way weekdays, has had to give it up and come the front road if he comes at all.' ' In that case, I am grateful to the water, and to find that one innovation may sometimes be the enemy of another. I think we will let your duck -pond have its way, Mr. Somers.' The farmer laughed a little uncomfortably ; then he turned with a start as the lady's voice came clear from the window: ' Do you see any objection, Mr. Somers, to the church being entered and made use of during the week \u2014 by, at least, responsible persons ?' The poor man was in a fix. He saw clearly that there was a difference of opinion betwixt his betters, and having no very strong one on the matter himself, he looked for an opening to escape without offending either, which was not easy to discover. But an answer was expected of him. ' No, ma'am, no,' he replied doubtfully ; then with a"], [66, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 58 deprecatory glance at the rector : ' Airs the place, you know, sir,' he said. Mrs. Hargreaves laughed. ' Is it for that Mr. Mayland wishes it open ?' she asked. Mr. Somers remembered a certain conversation with the curate himself, and he answered with anxiety to show his complete comprehension of that young man's purposes. ' No, ma'am, no,' he said hurriedly ; ' I know he thinks the poor folk on the road should have a place to turn into if so be the weather's bad, and they be goin' by. Oh, there's reason in that, sir,' he went on, growing courageous and turning to the rector, ' whatever one may say about the utility \u2014 the general utility and so forth, as you may say \u2014 there's sense in that.\" 'Nonsense, you should say, Somers,' roared the rector. Mrs. Hargreaves laughed again. The poor man looked the picture of snubbed discomfiture. ' Now listen to me, my friend,' said the rector in a milder tone, touching with his hand the other's knee ; ' all that talk is so much twaddle. Nothing of that kind has ever been done in this parish before, and I see no reason why it should be done now. So do this which I tell you, and pay no attention to anyone else. If you at any time during the days of the week see the door of that church open, I will trouble you, without delay, as warden, and with my authority, to walk up to that door and close it promptly ; and if the key is in it, to take it with you to your own house, and let"], [67, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 59 Mr. Mayland or Mr. Anybodyelse seek it there when they have proper occasion to make use of it.' ' Til do it, sir, that I will !' exclaimed Mr. Somers, rising with unwonted energy to his feet, delighted to find, by a simple act of obedience to his superior, a means of deliverance from the uncomfortable position in which he found himself, between two fires. 'It shall be done ; leave it to me. And I wish you a good day, sir. Good afternoon, ma'am ;' and he bowed himself to the door in the liveliest impatience to cut short the interview and escape outside. ' And the water,' cried the rector. ' Why, you must put one of your men to cut a ditch.' ' It shall be done, sir, it shall be done ; leave it to me ;' and he disappeared, altogether annulling the main purpose of his visit, to get the rector at his own expense to undertake the very work which now he was promising so freely to perform himself, and for the expenses of which he well knew he would never see a single shilling. He let himself out of the house, and proceeding down the drive at a quicker pace than he had come up it, he felt distinctly happier when safe in the road with his face towards home. The distance was but short, but as he walked he had time to ruminate with con siderable annoyance upon the doings of the new curate, which not only had evidently set at loggerheads the rector and his wife, but had brought him, of all men, into the discord also, and had imposed on him now a duty for which he had little taste. For he wished to be at peace with all men, and that the carrying out of his instructions must be followed by ill-feeling between"], [68, "60 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH himself and Mayland he felt there could be no doubt. ' Ah well, it can't be helped,' he ejaculated, ' and perhaps as the missis seems to think it best on account of Polly as we shouldn't get intimate with him, if he does take offence, 'twon't matter much. It's to be hoped he'll be leaving soon. But I'm sorry.' By this time he had arrived at the wicket-gate leading into the rickyard, and he raised the latch and entered. He had taken but a few steps among that labyrinth of stacks and stone settles on which great yellow corn ricks would, a few weeks later, stand, when he came on a ladder leaning against one of the former \u2014 a very large one, high, warm-scented, built of that year's well-gathered hay \u2014 and on the top of the ladder as he looked up he saw the figure of a man, with his back towards him, busy with the roof thereof. It was George Merritt. Mr. Somers stood still and regarded him a moment. Then he cried out : ' George, how much more straw shall ye want for that there job ?' George turned on the ladder top; then slowly realizing that it was the master down below ad dressing him, without answering a word came cau tiously down step by step with his back to the ladder. On reaching the ground he grasped the great hooked stick which he always left handy at the foot of his ascents, and hobbled up to where the farmer stood. The latter surveyed him with a dry amusement ; he was well used to his slow ways. George, when he had come close enough to speak in a low voice, touched his forehead and said :"], [69, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 61 ' I should like to 'ave a word with ye, maister, if it's convanient.'

' Anyhow, let's have it, George,' said the other.

He moved towards his ladder once again. ' Look here, George,' cried Mr. Somers in a grave voice. George stopped and turned.

Mr. Somers walked into the house with a face full of thought. ' Well,' said he to himself, ' after all, this job the rector's put me on to mayn't be no bad thing.

Master Georgie Merritt, it has been said, was not behind his years. He kept an intelligent eye on all things that went on around him, and passed judgment on them according to his lights. And against nothing was he more bitter than any attempt to exclude him from the general information ; and, indeed, such attempts met rarely with success, only stirring him to greater efforts to prove their futility, and giving him reason to view as something less than sacred secrets of which he was in possession solely by his own address. And so it was that the severity with which his otherwise too indulgent mother had expelled him from her inter view with Polly Somers was answered promptly in his breast by a determined resolution that certain incidents connected with that young lady of which he happened to be cognizant, and which he had reason to believe both she and his mother wished to remain private matters, should be passed on at least to one ear that he knew, without delay. Why that ear more than any other is easily explained. Simeon Jebb was not wanting in one thing \u2014 a distinct enjoyment of the humours of child-life, which in his early career as Bible-reader in a large north-country"], [73, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 65 parish had put him on familiar terms with all the children, and endeared him, in spite of his burly brusqueness, to the hearts of not a few of the poor mothers amongst whom he went. So that, when, on taking orders and finding his first curacy under the rector of Great Marley, he had sought a lodging at the village post-office, though he made but an indifferent impression on the good landlady, he had found a ready friend and early advocate in Master Georgie, then scarce seven years old. Not that he exhibited any special tenderness towards that infant prodigy, or showed any considerable concern as to his moral character and bringing up, or discussed at all with his young friend the many difficulties and obstacles of human life ; but then, all those were matters which Georgie himself had little interest in. It was sufficient for him that the new gentleman tickled him, and romped with him, and let him walk at times for a short way with him along the lanes, and even sometimes found a halfpenny for him in the bottom of his pocket. And these were virtues which he entirely missed in the Rev. Mr. Mayland when, nearly two years later, he joined the other under the Merritt roof. The new comer, though he smiled sweetly at him, and bent tenderly down to him, and in a gentle voice inquired after his health, and if he liked school, and all the other silly things those silly grown-ups always asked, just for the sake of something to say \u2014 you can see that \u2014 was certain afterwards to turn aside to his mother, if she were by, and speak in low and serious tones about ' childlike souls ' and ' innocence ' and all that sort of rubbish, which sent him, Georgie, flying into 5"], [74, "66 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH the back -garden to get out of hearing, and find another gooseberry or two, if, by chance, there were any ripe ones left after the exhaustive search that had already taken place. No, there was no doubt in his mind as to the merits of his mother's lodgers \u2014 in fact, his regard for the one was as great as his repugnance for the other. And so, having in his possession information which he well guessed his favourite ought to know, and which the other was most probably hoping he would not know, Master Georgie, who had no slight inkling of a certain episode in the former's life, did not hesitate. He watched his opportunity to impart it. And has it not been shown how the ignominious treatment to which he had been subjected that morning at his mother's hands was not inclined to moderate his zeal ? ' Why, Mr. Jebb's gone out, mother !' he exclaimed, with some irritation, when, having escaped from his mid-day meal, he had rushed up to his friend's bedroom to catch him again before he left upon his rounds, and had found the door locked. 'Well, my dear, I expect 'e is,' said Mrs. Merritt, ' if, at least, 'e's not in the sitting-room with Mr. Mayland.' Georgie, who had listened carefully at the door, was able to inform her to the contrary. ' Now I remember,' said the mother, ' 'e told me 'e wouldn't be back till nightfall, so I 'spect 'e's gone to Leasowes.' ' What, French's ?' But Georgie said no more, and, presently, he had slipped from the room, and, snatching up his cap, was."], [75, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 67 soon running up the hill towards the church. A thick figure clad in clerical black was in front of him, walking with vigorous steps, though clumsy and uneven, and with a weighty briar stick in hand, used now and again as swinging pendulum to steady the unequal gait, and now to cut up stones and dandelions on the footpath side. In spite of the apparent pace, progression was not fast. Georgie soon came up. ' What, you, little nipper !' exclaimed Simeon, turn ing round on him. Georgie was out of breath, and, now that he had gained his opportunity, found speech deserting him. He merely smirked and tramped briskly by the longer legs of his companion. In a moment they were at the top of the hill and passing the church gates. ' Who told you to turn up now ?' asked Simeon, with a wry look. ' Nobuddy,' replied George, grinning. ' Then suppose I pitch you over there ' \u2014 pointing through the railings to the graveyard \u2014 ' and leave you with the ghosts till midnight ?'

One of a family of thirteen, his parents hard-working, hard handed, pious people, market -gardeners by trade, in his boyhood he had seemed more fitted, with his thick frame and solid countenance, to make a success in life by following his father's footsteps than by any other. But, unfortunately, he had elder brothers, and they had already monopolized the opening in that direction, so that Simeon, with the practical shrewdness born in him, saw early the necessity of striking out for himself in a new vein. This resolution was not a little confirmed in one direction by a certain rough but unmistakable piety which his pleased parents thought they found in him, and a precocious capacity for scriptural diction and dissertation, of which he himself was not a little proud. In this way he came into some reputation, not only among his twelve brothers and sisters, but also with the neighbours, and it slowly grew on him and them, until it became a fixed idea, that he was destined to become a minister of the Gospel. And yet, this, it must be said, without any special growth of spiritual fitness for the calling ; but almost solely by reason of his superior powers, and the valuable use to which he saw a hope of putting them, did that way of life more and more recommend itself. But his poor parents, with their numerous offspring, had no means to educate him beyond the parish school, or even to support him long in self-improvement under their own roof, so that at sixteen he was glad to accept the offer of a neighbouring clergyman to let him work for him as Bible-reader and sick visitor at the handsome"], [77, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 69 stipend of thirty pounds a year. But Simeon Jebb was not one to be depressed. Having chosen his way of life, he stuck to it with a bull-dog determination, and he worked harder than ever to become fit for it. By the kind assistance of the clergyman and the loan of his library, he pushed himself up to a pitch of education on all subjects necessary to his profession with such speed that by his twentieth year he was able to compete successfully in the examinations of a well-known college of theology, and to prove himself a suitable candidate for Holy Orders. Now, whether he at any time doubted of himself, and wondered whether, after all, kind Nature had not made him for a drawer of radish and hoer of spring carrots, rather than a gleaner of souls, cannot be said, for Simeon was not one to look back or let others know it, if he did. Certain it is he performed his duties without faltering ; but it is equally certain that he performed them without enthusiasm. They were his way of life, to be done and made the best of, and at least as good as any other, with the marked advantage of social estimation, and for the privilege of performing which he had laboured long and hard. But he did not conceal from himself that he had no call for them, and that ambition and the suggestion of all about him from his earliest days alone had animated him to seek them. The budding piety of his childhood, as has been said, had not responded to its promise, had shrivelled in the frost of enterprise and aspiration, and left a wood-growth only. He had won and lost. He did not disguise the fact. Some times, alone, he would burst into loud guffaws of cynic laughter. In this mood the strong sensual vein"], [78, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 70 shown in his thick neck and broad jaws, which was the inheritance of a virile race of labouring ancestors, soon reasserted its supremacy and marked him for its own. He had not been long in his new duties, when he began to measure up the prospects of comfort and good things thence to be derived, and he could not deny that they were meagre \u2014 eighty pounds a year, and in all probability, seeing that he was no University man, and was without influential friends, not much more for many a year to come. Not hard lines, you say, for the gardener's son, who, with very little fall from his birth level, might otherwise have been breaking clods at fifteen shillings a week. But even on that sum a labourer can marry and settle down, which was what a curate could not do. And Simeon Jebb desired this no less than other forms of happiness. He saw clearly that a bride with money was the one thing for him, and he commenced at once to look for one, with no very exalted standard of female charm before his eyes provided that other requisite was in liberal evidence. But, as if Fate was resolved not to be niggardly with him, he found at the very outset of his quest both beauty and means in the same sweet person baited ready for him \u2014 at least, so he thought. For Polly Somers, as we have seen, was inclined to somewhat free behaviour towards her male admirers ; so much so, that poor Simeon, in spite of the mercenary motives with which he first approached her, knowing her to be the only child of prosperous parents, and telling himself all the while that her prettiness was rather a drawback to his suit than otherwise, and that he wished it less con-"], [79, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 71 spicuous, fell head over ears in love with her, and, letting the monetary side of the question nearly pass from his reckoning altogether, became the pure and simple worshipper that a young man should be. What, then, was the blow, when he discovered that the girl had been only playing with him, when she gave him to understand, kindly enough, but with a smile as if she could not bring herself to believe he really meant it, that the seriousness of the situation was on his side only, and that she had simply sought a little innocent amusement ! ' It came on him with a crushing suddenness, and swamped, once and for all, the higher and more senti mental leanings of his mind that this pure passion had called forth, and sent him back more irredeemably than ever to his former self. With a scornful laugh he com menced again his search, with a resolution absolutely determined now to let only one consideration, that of \u00a3 s. d., affect him. And with this convenient limita tion, success in one quarter, as we shall see, again seemed to wait on him. But deep in his heart, held down by the man's strong will to not let his life be spoilt, lay still his passion for a round little figure and fair head. And though he could go no more to her own home, yet when, as often hap pened, they would meet and pass with barest recognition in lane and field, and on Sunday in the prominent warden's pew when he would see her coldly avoiding his eyes as they shot for a moment over the great brazen lectern in a breathing interval \u2014 then, ah ! then, he would choke down a silent rage, and forget for a time the ignoble consolations of comfort and good things which"], [80, "72 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH daily he was hugging closer to his soul as their possi bility drew nearer. When, on this occasion, Polly had disappeared from view, he merely quickened his pace, with eyes fixed firmly on the ground, until he had passed the precincts of the Church Farm ; which acceleration affected yet again adversely Georgie's powers of speech. But once past the railed fence that girt the great rickyard, and past the little lane that led down to the front entrance of the Church Farm house, Simeon's pace again slackened to that somewhat waddling gait which was his natural and unforced method of progression. Then Georgie took breath and courage also. ' 'Er 's a-lookin1 out for 'im,' he observed, with a know ing wink. Simeon stopped, and turned sharply on his small companion. ' What was that ?' he asked. ' 'Er 's a-lookin1 out, I said, sir. An1 so 'er was. You seed 1er.1 ' What do you mean ?

' I only knows as 'e an' Miss Polly's a-spoonin', like as \u2014 like ' He was going to add, ' like you did,' but he thought better of it. ' Come,' said Simeon, with a suddenly resumed calm ness, ' come now, come along.' And, with his one hand on the boy's shoulder, he started off again slowly, push ing him steadily before him. ' So, then, they are spooning, are they ?' he went on. ' Well, now, just tell me, Georgie, where it may be that you have dropped on that piece of information, eh ?' ' 'Eard it,' said Georgie shortly, not relishing alto gether this severe catechetical treatment. ' And where did you hear it ?' ' 'Eard father saying it.' ' And to whom ?' ' 'E was tell in' mother, an' I was in bed in the box- room.' ' And you overheard ? ' But 'twarn't my fault. I couldn't 'elp 'ear,' said Georgie, suddenly alarmed. ' Well, and what did you hear ?' ' I 'ear father tell mother as they was a-meetin' nights i' the rickyard there, an' a-kissin' an' all that,' he replied freely, relieved to find that his interlocutor was ready to participate in his crime of overhearing, and at the same time enlarging somewhat on the verities."], [82, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 74 But what did that matter ? There was not the least doubt it was all true in fact. Georgie, who himself was a lover, and had a pink little miss of his own years in the same class at school, around whose neck his small arm often went, knew well that when the other ' chaps ' weren't looking he never hesitated to salute her in just that way himself. ' Your father works for Mr. Somers ?' asked Simeon. ' 'E often does odd jobs there \u2014 thatchin' an' such.' ' And you are certain ?' ' Cert'in sure. Mother cries out, thinkin' 'e meant ' Georgie hesitated. ' Me, Georgie ?' ' Yes, sir ; but father says : \" No ; Mr. Jebb wouldn't do things that wise.\" ' Which last was not even the truth enlarged, but a piece of the most fulsome fiction. Georgie watched for the effect. ' I am much obliged to your father,' said Simeon gravely, ' very much, for his excellent opinion of me, Georgie. And now, is there anything more ?' Georgie racked his brains, for he had begun again to enjoy his role of news-bearer, and wished to prolong it. Then he remembered Polly's visit to the post-office, and revenge stirred once more within him for the affront offered him on that occasion. ' Only it's mother who's a-'elpin' 'er,' he said. ' Helping ? In what way ?' ' Miss Polly an' 'er's been puttin' their 'eads together. 'Er's been down at our place. I seed 'em ; but they wouldn't let me 'ear. But I know'd it all.' ' H'm !' releasing the boy and stepping out. ' Well,"], [83, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 75 Georgie, you've got good ears, but you have not good legs. I must push on.' ' I can keep up,' said Georgie, straining every muscle. But Simeon stopped short again. ' No, no. I think you had better turn back now. Good-evening, Georgie, and thank you for your informa tion. That's the way to get on in the world. Use the senses God has given you. Still, we must not be con stant eavesdroppers. Don't you know what that means? Well, it means you must keep your head under the bedclothes the next time your mother and father dis course in too high terms. 'Tis more respectful. And now let me see if that halfpenny's got through a hole in my pocket. No, here it is still. There ! Now carry custom to your good mother, and get toothache as a reward. Such is the way of things. Good-bye. We shall meet again.' And dropping the little dark sou into the small palm, he nodded smilingly and turned away, leaving mystification and joy on the countenance of his little friend. Simeon Jebb moved briskly on ; the sun blazed down upon his head, the dust rose beneath his feet ; but his stick no longer swung freely, cutting at thistle-heads and stones, but served its simple purpose of support to his poor limbs. He passed the Blue Lion, that solitary hostelry, scarce offering a word to his good friend the landlord, who, as usual, in his shirt-sleeves, seldom very snowy ones, was lounging in his own doorway, com pletely shutting out the sweet summer air from the beery gloom behind him. He turned over the stile to the right, and struck across the pasture through which"], [84, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 76 the footpath ran that he knew so well to the Leasowes Farm, and then, dropping down into the spinney with the little brook rippling among the moss, he crossed its plank-bridge, cast high above it from side to side, and mounting again the close-nibbled turf, dotted with sheep, of the upland rise beyond, came finally in view, a half-mile or more yet further on, of a red-gabled house clustered in ricks and barns, with a thick grove of dark Scotch firs set round the stackyard side to break the western winds, and apple-orchards spreading to the east and rear in all their green profusion. But of this prospect Simeon Jebb saw nothing, his mind was too preoccupied. That his rejection by Miss Polly Somers had been final and complete he had not doubted. Though with gnashings of teeth, he had accepted it as the inevitable. There was an end of her for him. And when later he learned that another had been successful where he had failed, and that other a fine young fellow, full of health and means, of the same world as hers, straight of limb and stark of purpose, he had only realized his fate the more, and with a profounder determination than ever to forget her, and to find entire consolation in a solid conquest such as that he was even that very afternoon pursuing. But now came other news. And yet it seemed in credible, not to speak of the certainty with which he had heard from various quarters of the virtual victory of young Tom French, that this Mayland, this man of professions so far beyond his own, of so mild a spirit, so expressive a devotion and good faith, so humble and depreciative of his own wants that even he, Simeon,"], [85, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 77 had felt a flush of real warm-hearted fellowship towards him \u2014 that he should be the man to carry on a liaison in this dark, surreptitious manner, and even to make use of the most hypocritical pretences for blinding both him, Simeon, and the girl's parents also, seemed a thing altogether impossible of belief. And besides, for what purpose such concealment, unless from mere shyness at having to confess himself of flesh and blood as other men ? \u2014 a too unlikely supposi tion. And then their conversation of but a week ago, and the vigorous repudiation of his, Simeon's, hint that friendship with Miss Polly Somers was apt to be a trifle perilous. All that came back to his mind. Such hypocrisy seemed scarce conceivable. And yet that boy's words and his own eyes declared it to be so \u2014 at least, unless the little rogue had been lying beyond all conscience ; and that also seemed scarce conceivable. An angry flush spread over Simeon's head and neck, and increased into a perfect welter the burning of his blood under exercise and the hot sun. ' What a canting snake of a false !' He choked almost with rage. He had always guessed what these ascetic posers were at heart. Had he not himself once had a weak inclining to that tone of theirs, and had luckily saved himself in time from affectation so contemptible? As if all men were not at heart alike ! Humbug ! cant ! Now, Simeon Jebb had another reason for his evident dislike to the new turn of things than this of disgust at the hypocrisy of his would-be friend. For we shall see before long that he had every wish why, failing himself, the young farmer to whose dwelling and over whose"], [86, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 78 acres he was then tramping that blazing July afternoon should be blessed with the little hand and, let us hope, big heart of Miss Polly Somers. But we will not inquire further for the present, but will be content with watching his square black figure as it mounts the last slope of the pasture to the home stead gate which shuts off the broad green lawn and flower-beds in front of the farmhouse from the road track running through unbordered turf to join the highway half a mile there to the right."], [87, "CHAPTER VIII. The Leasowes was indeed a dwelling place of good and kindly aspect. Not only the smart front of the house itself, to which through the trim full-flowered garden a weedless, bright red sanded path led up, but also all things far and near around its walls \u2014 barns, stacks and fowl-pens, fold-yards, shedding, cattle-stalls and troughs, fencings, the very pigstyes even, to make an end \u2014 seemed brand new, in their very best attire, as if the carpenter, the mason, and the boy with pot of good red paint had but just retired and left them to themselves. It was evident at the first sight that a prosperous purse and an active ordering brain lay somewhere at the back of all this goodly scene. And certainly it was so. The Frenches were not tenant farmers ; they owned the land they tilled, and mortgage free ; and they had made a good thing out of it. The present proprietor, 'young Mr. Thomas' as he was always called, though his father had died when he was but a lad, intended to continue doing so ; and, luckily for him, when he had come into his inheritance, he had found that he had had an excellent regent during his minority in his"], [88, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 80 buxom mother, who had always been possessed of the same purpose. And so, though when that time came he had reso lutely striven to get the management of his own good acres out of her hands into his own, he had not been by any means unwilling to leave her all the cares and more of the house and homestead, to which her energies might be devoted with still greater thoroughness than when the whole guidance of the farm was in her keeping. It was true he had had a smart struggle to circumscribe her rule to these dimensions ; and she still retained over him so much control, born of his years of tutelage, that he even yet feared to take any con siderable step without consulting her, life without her by his side and her vigorous opinions on all matters seeming hardly to be grasped ; and she certainly had had no intention of permitting him to feel otherwise. For though she had a comfortable income of her own, and could easily have left him alone to pick up a wife as a young man should, she was far too fond of those affairs over which she had so long presided to contemplate a possible retirement ; and he as cer tainly, even had he wished it, would never have had the courage to suggest it. This state of things might have gone on indefinitely, and the knowledge that her son had found her a successor would not have altered in the least her determination to ignore it, had not an influence from .another quarter quite unexpectedly interposed. Mrs. French was both fat and fairish, although four dozen years were close upon her ; yet, though her husband had died some thirteen years before, she"], [89, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 81 honestly had never contemplated another. Indeed, her attachment to the place which would one day be her boy's had disinclined her to anything that might drive her from it, or interfere with her sole direction ; so that when suddenly an admirer in the shape of a clergyman \u2014 for which species of the human male family she had ever a preference, possibly from a perception that they were mild and easily managed \u2014 when one of these, poorly off perhaps, and not too handsome, but youthful and good-hearted, began to hover round her with many notes of tender admiration, she herself was quite alarmed at the flutter of sentiment provoked within her bosom. However, things went at such a pace that a time was not long coming when her anxiety was not how to forestall any attempts on the part of her son to oust her from the home she had known so long, but how to broach to him without a foolish shame her manner of leaving it. For the young man had often expressed those vigorous opinions on the subject of second marriages which are peculiar to youth in the ardour of first love, and which are apt to become a trifle modified with the run of years. In this position, the one thing that gave her hope that he might receive the tidings with something like equanimity was the fortunate condition of his own affections, and the certainty that he himself must be scheming with much anxiety a means of obtaining her consent to quit his roof and take up her abode else where. And so it was with great alarm that recently she had noticed a falling off, in fact a complete cessa tion, of Tom's visits to the Church Farm ; and so great 6"], [90, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 82 was her fear that something had occurred, that she actually trembled to question him about it. Eagerly she looked forward to a certain spiritual visitor who, for the sake of appearances, confined his ministrations to a bi-weekly call, and that casually assumed, and whose dark form, trudging up the slope yonder, was never-failingly perceived far off by her good eyes. And this time soon as ever. Simeon Jebb had no need to ring or knock. The door, as usual, was opened to him by the lady of the house herself. He entered with scarce a word into the cool, roomy hall, where everything was of the cleanest and the best, and silent too, for the servants at the Leasowes were never linger ing about or laughing and chattering kitchenwards ; and there were hours of the week when the mistress, especially of late, had found good reasons for setting them smartly to their work in parts of the big house not too near to the front apartments. Into one of these, the large dining-room upon the right, she now showed her visitor. And here also Simeon's comfort - loving eyes met everything they held most dear \u2014 carpets, curtains, arm chairs of the cosiest and the best, the firm table of black oak on which his elbows had comfortably rested more than once, the sideboard of the same material, massive and richly-carved, whose generous compart ments he well knew were stocked with liquors and good condiments ad lib., the spacious hearth towards which he had turned up his heels on many a wet and windy night, and wondered when he would have the resolution to pluck himself away for his long tramp home. But he was not in the mood this day to have regard"], [91, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 83 for these things, or to draw comfort from the thought that their present mistress could renew them readily under another roof for his lifelong appreciation.

He flung his broad hat upon the table and gasped out that it was hot. The lady closed the door and approached him shyly. Her own forebodings were confirmed in his demeanour. She had expected a tender greeting in the privacy of that chamber, but she had to bear with disappointment. She laid her hand upon his arm instead and waited for him to speak.

It was unfortunate, therefore, that the necessity of gaining her consent to the publi cation of their mutual bond compelled him to resort to language which she could only answer with effusive demonstrations, especially when these were accom panied with a persistent opposition to his wishes.

She could not deny that Simeon had good cause to be hurt with her poor squeamishness, to which she was sacrificing a devo tion as flattering as unexpected. But she had become so possessed with fear of her son's ridicule, if not anger,"], [94, "86 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH which now would not be lessened by any desire to be rid of her, or toned down by the fact that he himself was, if more appropriately, still in the same boat, that she could not consent to break the news to him, at any rate, for the present. ' Perhaps,' she began again, at length \u2014 ' perhaps it's only a quarrel they've had, and will get patched up again. I wish I could do something ; but I never had much liking for that Somers girl ; she's been always too much fancied and saddled with for me. Let's hope things will come right. After all, Tom's too good a catch for her to let slip so easily. Things '11 come right.' ' I fear not,' said Simeon gravely ; ' I fear not, Susan. I have reason to know not.' ' Oh !' she gasped despairingly. ' On the contrary,1 he went on, ' I have strong reason to feel certain that another gentleman has replaced Mr. Thomas French in the affections of that young lady.' ' Simeon ! I wish you wouldn't talk so unless you know !' ' But I do know. And I know the gentleman also. He is a personal friend of mine ; in fact, we are living at this moment under the same roof.'

There's something in this body to look at, not through. Flesh and blood for you. She must have overlooked me, surely. I wonder how it is. She's made a miss, and no mistake. Hard lines for me. A pretty girl like that. A prize, I call her.' She writhed and squirmed. ' A prize, indeed !' she breathed, with indignation, ' A spoilt minx !' ' With golden hair, blue eyes,' he went on ; ' with the largest ' ' And much good may they do her !' she exclaimed, ' or anybody who comes near them. I've always pitied Tom dreadful, though we do want him to have her.' ' Ah ! you're a woman. We men think differently.' Her eyes flashed. ' I wonder you haven't fallen in love with her your self,' she cried, and could have swallowed the words as she spoke them. ' I wonder, too,' he answered, pondering. She drew herself up to her full height. ' Simeon ! I think you are going too far. You forget you are joking with my feelings.' ' She's worth looking after,' he went on, as though he"], [96, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 88 had not heard her, ' and, as you say, I ought to be able to wipe out Mayland. She's not such a bad judge as that. And, after all, a man of parts and education with a healthy appetite, if with not much to stop it, is not to be picked up every day by a country girl. She'll be proud to feed him.' ' Ah yes !' she sighed. ' I know, Simeon, I've brought this on myself, I have. But I never expected you to try me this far, I never did, Simeon. Of course, it's all playful like, I can see that ; but a poor woman's heart is a pitiful thing to play with, Simeon.' 'And a poor young bachelor's also, Susan,' he re sponded. ' It's not every man would have waited as long as I have for an acknowledgment. Still, ye gods, give me patience \u2014 patience I need !'

' And now here's to Miss Polly,' he said ; ' and may she have more and better successors to Thomas French, Esq., than she has yet found in the Rev. Edgar Mayland !' And he drank a huge draught. As he put down the cup, she flung herself again upon him. ' Simeon !' she cried. ' Simeon, darling ! I will speak this very evening ! I will tell him all !' He started. ' No, no !' he said eagerly ; ' I have done wrong to press you. Take your own time, Susan; there is no need of hurry. I don't know why I worried you. It is better, as you say, delayed a little till we know more as to Tom's affairs. Till then we are free \u2014 both of us. Where is he ?'"], [97, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 89 It was her turn to start. She looked at him with astonishment. What meant this change of tone, this almost welcome reference to their mutual freedom? Had, then, his bantering talk contained a vein of earnestness ? Could it be that those rash words of hers had given herself a rival? Had, then, they struck a spark that had already fanned itself into a permanent and vicious flame ? \u2014 a mere slip of the tongue as they had been, a simple accident. His next words did not help to reassure her. ' Yes, as you say,' he went on, as if speaking to him self, ' a poor creature like that. She must be only playing with him. Let us wait. That can't go on. 'Tis better so. In the meantime I'll find out more about it all. And now I must be off again.' And he rose to his feet, and took up his hat. She exclaimed at his unwonted hurry. It was his ordinary habit to stay not only for tea, but supper also. Another ominous occurrence. ' I can't stay to-night,1 he said. ' Perhaps I shall meet Tom on the farm. Good-bye. Things will come right, as you have said.' She stood silent and miserable as he pressed her hand and brushed his cheek to hers. She followed him in silence as he let himself out of the house, and went down the garden-path with just one hurried wave of the hand back towards her. He was soon out of sight behind the buildings of the farm. His brain was busy. Yes, he was a poor creature, was Mayland ; and it was utterly impossible the girl who had so turned away from his superior could mean any thing serious for him. This, as he moved along, Simeon"], [98, "90 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH told himself again and again with apparently unneces sary vehemence. Were, then, the widow's fears a trifle justified ? Did he once more, seeing that the object of his genuine love was floating evidently again fancy free, aspire to find some means of fixing her regards in his direction ? And yet, how could he, after the finality of the refusal he had already taken from her? How indeed? But still Still what ? Simply this : that that refusal might have wanted very much of its decisiveness, but for the presence of the young man with whom she now had evidently quarrelled very desperately, and without any apparent wish for reconciliation. And even if in her heart she were longing for this last, and had been merely acting out of pique, or desire to provoke the jealousy of the man she was too proud to yield to, was it his, Simeon's, place to further it, or to think too closely whether the means he took to do so were not just as likely to be followed by a contrary result ? He could but act, and let things take their chance. The interval was his, and he was free to profit by it. He inquired of a cowman cleaning out a stall if he knew in which direction his master was to be found. Then, with a cheery nod of thanks, he pushed on, his step distinctly lighter than that of an hour before, towards the meadow where the man had expressed his belief that he would come across ' the gaffer.' He crossed the rough metalled road by the horse-pond, and turned into the pasture, where the big red cattle lifted their heads to look at him, expectant of the hour when"], [99, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 91 they should be driven in to have the weight of those great udders for the second time that day relieved. He turned out of it again by the gate on the far side, and moving down the narrow headland of a broad-bean field, with its swelling pods, came out at length upon a small, wet, squashy little meadow, where the rushes grew among the grass, and a small streamlet trickled on the lower side, to lose itself in the larger brooklet that flowed through the spinney earlier mentioned ; and there he found his man. Tom French was at the further end of the small plot, mounted on a big bony bay, inspecting certain draining operations in the damp turf which a labourer was industriously performing under the master's eye. Simeon Jebb stood still and shouted. In a moment the other had heard him, and was cantering his great animal towards him. Tom French, as has been said, was a fine young fellow, long in limb and straight of back, big in feet and hands, his features heathily developed, if not fine. His face was tanned like a seaman's, beneath . a white sun-helmet; he was clothed from head to foot in a fresh new suit of light-gray tweed. His spurs were as bright as the bit and bridle and glistening coat of his close-clipped steed. He raised his helmet with a broad salute, and bowed to his visitor as he reined in. ' An unexpected pleasure !' he cried, in a tone not free from banter. ' Why, this is grand, man ! You'll be as good a farmer as me before long.1 And he slid from the saddle and held out his hand. Simeon took it and shook it heartily, laugh ing."], [100, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 92 'You forget I am a farmer by birth, Mr. French. I was born to the trade, you know.1 ' Ah ! so you told me,1 returned the other. ' Then why the deuce didn't you stick to it ? Better than ramming your old sermons twice a week down our throats, and trying to look happy over it. Still, you bear up, and no mistake.1 ' It's philosophy, Mr. French, and spare diet. Nothing like those two things for equanimity. I'm forced to find comfort in both.' ' As for your philosophy,' said Tom, ' that's Greek to me ; but for your feeding, I always thought you knew there was enough of that at the Leasowes whenever you cared to come in for it. Eh, my friend ?' And he winked and poked Simeon in the ribs with his riding-whip. The latter flushed somewhat, so far as his rubicund visage permitted him to show his feelings in that manner. He was aware that he made free use of the table of many a house where he visited, but he had sensibility enough not to care to be told of it. Tom French saw his mistake. ' But now, look here,' he said, putting his firm hand on the other's shoulder, ' I hope you'll continue to know it, and act accordingly. There's no face either I or my mother look out for more than yours, Mr. Jebb.' ' I have been speaking to her just now,' said Simeon, ' and she has given me some information ' ' Ah !' exclaimed Tom. ' Some information which, as a friend, I find interest ing.' ' The deuce you do ! I'm glad of it.'"], [101, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 93 ' My dear Mr. Thomas, you won't mind me speaking out ?' ' D n it, no !' cried Tom. ' Just Avhat I'm wait ing for.' ' Well, it's about a matter that concerns you closely.' ' Go ahead.' ' You have been thinking of marriage, I believe ?' Tom kicked over a little red mole-hill at his feet, then looked the other in the face. ' Well, what about it ?' he asked bluntly. ' Until recently ?' ' That's my affair.' ' Quite so \u2014 entirely so ; and I should not speak about what is naturally a delicate question, but for your mother's confidence.' ' She's been a little outstepping her own trade, hasn't she ?' dryly asked Tom. 'A mother's heart, Mr. Thomas \u2014 and, after all, I am your pastor.' ' Two things I'll not deny. And for the rest ?' ' Simply this, Mr. Thomas, that she thinks I can help you.' \u2022t ' Very much obliged. And what to ?'

' I have eyes, Mr. French, and I have feet, and they carry me about. And I have ears, too. Now, come, take this from me, a friend who lives nearer the Church Farm than the Leasowes, and sees more of its inmates. B\" I have not gathered that a certain fine young man is as much looked for there as ever, and if I haven't seen a little figure on the look-out for him more than once, watching the high-road from the churchyard wall there day by day, an apparition that surprised me greatly till from your mother's lips I have just heard its explana tion ; if I haven't reason to believe that just one word from him would put all right again just as it was before he took it into his head to ride off in a huff \u2014 all about nothing, too \u2014 why, then, take me for the guzzling dullard that that young man has sometimes hinted that he thought me.' ' My dear sir !' cried Tom, grasping the other's hand, ' you do both me and yourself injustice to talk like that. Really you do. A friend I value before any other that I know. By Jove ! but you must take that back ! I never breathed such a suggestion.' ' I believe you, Mr. Thomas ; 'twas but my fun,' said Simeon. ' By Gad ! I should think it was ! And if ever I can do anything to thank you for the interest you've taken"], [103, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 95 in me, let me know it. Hang it ! It's not every man would do as much,' said Tom. ' Come, then,' said Simeon. ' I see I've acted for the best ; and with Heaven's blessing my task was not a bad one \u2014 to let a lad know that his girl was waiting for him. And a girl like that ! I wish someone would bring me such news.' Tom shook his hand again heartily. ' And I hope some day they will, my friend,' he said ; ' for you deserve it. By Jove, I do ! And so the mother told you, did she ? Guessed she must know. Yes, we had a tiff \u2014 a mere flare-up on nothing. Fool I was to make so much of it ! I may tell you now, a friend like you, but there's not been a day since that I haven't cursed this stupid tongue that's wagging now. And I've cursed the pride that kept me from going down to tell her so. And yet I couldn't move. I had a sort of impossible-to-explain sort of feeling that kept me here. And now you've spoke it's gone clear off like mist. Ah, well, what fools we are !' ' Say what fools we can make of ourselves. It won't do to forget we are wise men at bottom,' said Simeon, laughing. Tom French laughed also. ' Well, it's d d hard to believe,' he said. ' But now let's get homewards. Come, you'll mount and ride up again, and I'll race you on foot.' Simeon declined, and the other pressed him ; but not now with the roguish wish to enjoy the curate's confusion on the back of his big strapping cob as would certainly have animated him at another time, but with a genuine courtesy. And the moment he saw the refusal was"], [104, "96 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH genuine also, he desisted, and led his horse by Simeon's side along the bean-field and the pasture, by the same way the latter had just come, talking of crops and stock, and other questions quite unsentimental. But, arrived near the house, Simeon, suddenly remem bering the claims of his profession and its many duties, excused himself, in spite of ardent invitation, from entering again, and took his leave for home. Then Tom gave his horse to the stable-boy and went within. He sought his mother. She was in the dining room, and tea was laid waiting for him. She rose to meet him. A nervous seriousness was on her face, words difficult to utter were halting on her lips. But before she could bring them out, she was struck dumb by the radiance of his countenance, which had been wholly otherwise for some time now. And while she stood astonished, he had put his arm around her com fortable figure, and given her a kiss upon the forehead. ' There, mother !' he exclaimed. ' Now we're going to be as jolly as ever, eh ?' That settled it. For the life of her she could not tell him now. Without a word, she sat down to the table, wondering at the change that had come over him. But he, who had regained his love, had gained every thing beside ; not only victory in this its first dilemma \u2014 a fact of consolation and good omen in itself enough \u2014 but also practical exemption from the haunting task of choosing between his mother and his wife-to-be \u2014 deliverance from an ever-present dread. Rather, it was she, Polly, who had had to choose, to take him on his own terms or not at all. And she had chosen \u2014 clearly. She was his again, free from all price."], [105, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 97 He hummed and sang as he ate and drank, and chatted in the highest humour with his mother, whose answers were by no means so inspired ; and when the meal was over he retired to his office, where he kept and worked his farm accounts, and wrote a letter and stamped it, and addressed it. Now Tom, although a good book-keeper and neat, was not at all a ready writer, and so it was well into the evening ere these last operations were com pleted, and gray twilight was already over field and croft as he strode towards the main highroad where, in a little hamlet of labourers' cottages, a post-office was found. But with his big limbs he soon was there and had dropped his letter in. Then, in the ordinary course of things, he should have turned back home again. But a restless fever of joy was on him, and instead, he trod on, preceding by some hours his careful epistle on the same road, to the same end. 7"], [106, "CHAPTER IX. It was some time after sunset that same evening that another figure, from another quarter, was moving towards the same point and the same object as the young farmer with whom we parted at the end of the last chapter. Edgar Mayland had had a hard day at the village of Longleigh. A case of serious sickness in a labourer's child had all day long absorbed his anxious care, and he had not left until a change for the better had set in, and he could find his way back home again with an easy heart. Now, whether it was this fortunate issue to the anxieties of the day, or the calm, cool beauty of the evening landscape, green and restful after the hot sun had gone down to the under-world, or both, that so inspired him, certain it is that he turned with a more bounding step than was his wont towards the little lane earlier mentioned that ran up from the meadows before the square front face of the Church Farm house. He even hummed to himself the air of a Scotch love-song that an itinerant bugler, standing among a crowd of gaping chits before the village inn, had worked into his brain that afternoon. And with its theme his thoughts"], [107, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 99 also were in harmony. For what was love as expressed in these pure and simple melodies but a thing Divine, perfecting the full providence of God as much as birth and death and the new way hereafter ? And why should he have ever fled from it and allowed himself to think of it as a thing, to say the least, destructive of the highest life ? Highest ? Rather should that be called the lowest which seeks to shun His laws, His world, as if He had not made them. Ah, how he wished that he could have always seen this so ! With what regret he remembered conversa tions with Simeon Jebb in which he had upheld the celibate state as something, though, if not essential, worthy of admiration in the priest of God ! Poor Simeon ! And he had seemed to give consent, though against his better nature ; his more sound and nobler sense had been seduced and overweighed by the false authoritativeness of one whom he humbly looked upon as his superior on account of spurious gifts of birth and education, but who, in honest truth, was ignorance itself beside him in all great things human and divine. Poor Simeon ! But if he had done him this injury, the more glad should he, Mayland, now be to seek the means of reparation which, for a whole week, had occupied a considerable portion of his leisure thoughts, but, alas ! without success. With some disheartenment, that checked his step and stopped the air upon his lips, he mounted slowly the little lane before the house, using his eyes more earnestly than ever to inspect the precincts of the farm, though at that late hour he felt the chances of catching any glimpse of the small round face and figure that were 7\u20142"], [108, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 100 now so fixed upon his mind were very slight ; but not one was to be lost. Who could say what luck even the dusk might not bring forth ? But again, as ever, not a sign. A deserted stillness everywhere, blinds drawn, and shutters closed, and silence over all. The very poultry, even the most recalcitrant of ducks and geese, had been swept in to safety and repose. He passed on, with something of a sigh. Presently he reached the main highway, and turned along to the right by the great stackyard-side. He approached the wicket-gate from which but a few nights before he had so precipitately fled. As he saw it ahead of him in the clear dusk, that hasty leave-taking came vividly before him as it had not done since. He stopped short, seized with a momentary hesitation, a sort of self-surprise to find himself now ardently desiring what then he had so wildly shunned. What a change must have come upon him ! Even so \u2014 a change for the better, a revela tion, of the beauty of love, in whose workings he was at last called upon to take his share \u2014 for another's sake. He moved on once more. For the sake of his dear friend. And if chance were given him, he would take it, without fail. And so it was. He came to the gate, from which was a clear thoroughfare through ricks and stacks to the farm house itself. He looked across it, and there, sauntering in the straw-littered way, as though she had no purpose in the world but to breathe the cool evening air, and let it fan among the golden wisps of her unbonneted little head, was she he had so long been seeking. Again he stopped, stunned and mute with a realization so prompt and unexpected. It was only after the first"], [109, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 101 shock was passed that he remembered to raise his hat. She smiled brightly as she came towards him, and held out her hand over the gate, at the same time with the other opening it, as though she did not doubt his entering. He hesitated a moment, and then did so. ' How long you have been coming !' she observed. ' Indeed !' He had prepared a careful scheme of conversation for this fortunate occasion, but now it left him utterly. He was quite at a loss how to commence. But she came to his relief, scarcely being able to suppress a secret chuckle at the awkwardness and bashfulness of this singular lover. ' Why, of course. I thought you would be sure to call again soon now you know us.' ' But, let me see, it's only a week since,' he answered, with a strange joy to find himself so scolded. 'I have feared to make myself a nuisance.' ' You !' she exclaimed, with a look of tender in credulity ; ' you to say that !' ' It is very good of you to speak so,' he observed. ' I wish that I had known.' ' And you have been so near so often,' she returned. He flushed a trifle. How did she know that ? Had she watched him, guessed his meaning, and there waited for him that night ? It seemed so. ' I naturally pass this way often,' he explained. ' To go to Longleigh ? I thought by the meadows was your nearest way ?' ' True,' he allowed guiltily, ' but \u2014 I like a change.' She bit her lip with vexation. 'What a creature he was ! What absurd shyness ! Why couldn't he speak"], [110, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 102 out ? And she giving him every opportunity ! Clearly he must be forced. ' But you always go this way now,' she said. ' No\u2014 do I ?' She fairly gasped with surprise. Could it be possible this man was really in love with her ? Must it not be that Mrs. Merritt had indulged in some enormous mis conception, some feat of imagination born of a too forward interest in the fate of those she had a feeling for? That was a matter which must be solved. By hook or by crook he should be made to speak. They had moved slowly towards the house, but were still in the shadow of great ricks to right and left, where the dusk was almost deepened into dark. Now, from the corner of one of these a great slice of fodder had been cut away, but not completely to the ground, leaving a warm, soft bench under the cover of the huge sweet-scented mass for such as cared to take it. ' Don't let us go in, let us sit here a bit,' she said, suiting action to the word. Hardly knowing what he did, he sat down likewise by her side. They were quite concealed from view, either from the road or from the house. ' Now tell me, what do you think of me ?' He started. ' Really, Miss \u2014 a \u2014 Somers,' he began (' He couldn't even recollect my name,' she muttered) \u2014 ' really, that is a question I was not prepared for.' ' You haven't even thought about it !' she exclaimed. ' Indeed,' he answered truthfully, ' you have been on my mind more than you can ever have the least idea. I ought to say that you have completely filled it.' ' Ah,' she thought, ' now it is coming, is it ?'"], [111, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 103 But she said nothing, merely cast down her eyes. He was glad to see it. ' Coquette ' Simeon had called her, but he was quite wrong. She was modesty itself. He could speak out with safety, though, of course, with much discretion. He must travel round the point, with careful soundings and all the skill that he could muster, and not rush wildly on it. ' But if you have filled my thoughts, it is you yourself who are not a little responsible for it,' he said. ' You showed so much interest in me and my profession when last we met. I was flattered, you see ; I had not expected it.' ' Of a country girl like me ?' she said. ' Of a country girl like you. But all the more was I pleased to see it.' ' Thank you exceedingly,' she said ; ' it is nice to give satisfaction.' ' I hope I have not offended you ?' he answered, with alarm. ' Oh, not in the least. Do tell me all about it, and how you live. It is true that I am a country girl, and ignorant. I wish to know, and have always wondered, how things must seem to you \u2014 how they would seem to me if I were one of you.' His eyes glowed. ' As wife and helpmeet,' he muttered audibly. ' A clergyman should be married \u2014 you think so, don't you ?' she asked. ' Most certainly,' he said, with warmth. ' What is he worth without ?

We all have them, and that is why we can't interfere with"], [115, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 107 one another, either you with me or I with you. So please don't answer me. Shall we go in ?' She turned slightly to move away. But he put his hand upon her arm. ' But I will, I will answer you,' he said. ' Stay a little.' She looked up at him. Was he not trembling with excitement ? Or was it her own alarm that made her think so ? ' Oh, don't !' she said, ' don't tell me ! Why should you ?' ' Because I have deceived myself, him also, and done him wrong, great wrong ! because I ought not to be here ! I should have known it ! I know it now !' ' That is strange !' she said. But secretly she flattered herself it was not strange at all. She understood him perfectly. And so it was true, after all, that which Betsy Merritt had revealed to her. This man was in love with her, but, having found out that his friend was in the same case, with a fatuous devotion, he had determined to sacrifice himself for him, and even to go so far as to plead his cause, and after much patient waiting had actually done so. But, now that he saw that therein he had completely failed, the temptation to let out something of his own feeling was not to be suppressed. She understood it all. But, whatever truth there might be in the former guess, in this latter she was quite unfair to him. On the contrary, his mind now was more than ever filled with his friend, with the duty that lay on him to undo the mischief which his rash intervention had brought"], [116, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 108 on him. And it was in this anxiety that he seemed to see the motives of his own action suddenly revealed, and in a clearer shape than there was any warrant for, and rushed at once to accuse himself of conduct base and hypocritical, in seeking under cover of a service to his best of friends an interview which now he had to acknowledge was a pleasure for himself, and which he should have known could do that friend naught else but harm. And to let her know this seemed the only way to remedy the mischief he had done \u2014 to let her see that Simeon had no part in the course that he had taken, that she had no reason to nurse indignation against him for that he had confessed to another his love of her, and even asked his aid to gain hers in return. Which last piece of conduct was evidently to her outrageous. Yes, it was a case for plain confession. ' Strange, you will call it,' he said, in quivering tones, ' but I call it something much worse, worse than dis honest, treacherous ! Yes, I ought never to have been here. Only your face has haunted me with a fascina tion I have neither had the courage to allow nor the virtue to shake off, knowing all the while I had no right to think of it, which was another's. And even if it had not been, could never have been mine, whose life is bound to ways where such as yours would wither up and waste away in the want of everything that hitherto it had enjoyed. Ah, how could I forget !' She had sat down again now, and was looking at him in wonder. ' Why is your life to be so miserable ?' she asked. ' Not miserable for me !' he exclaimed. ' Mine is the call \u2014 'tis mine to glory in it !'"], [117, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 109 ' Then why not for \u2014 for a wife ?' He started. It seemed as if she had been just about to say ' for me.' Was it possible ? He must make an end of this. ' You do not understand,' he said, ' the circumstances under which I live. They are exceptional, and my work is one that can never be left. I think I told you I am here only for a time, for my health's sake, and must go back eventually. And you have no idea of the life there, you who have never had, I should imagine, any contact with the dark side of our city life. And, oh ! it is dark ! For a woman delicate-souled and unprepared it would be nothing but deadly, horrible, that Murkington ! Those who have never seen can never imagine its sordid grime, its smoke, its desolation, its hideous poverty and awful sins. Even I, who have lived amongst them now for some years and have grown accustomed to them, can hardly think of them without a shudder. It is no place for a wife.' ' It must be horrid !' she said. ' I should hate it !' He was pleased to hear her speak so. ' Oh, most certainly you would \u2014 you, who have known no other life than this, amongst these sweet surroundings, and I hope will always continue to know no other \u2014 even as I shall never know but that,' he added in an undertone. Tears came to her eyes, tears of genuine admiration and pity for this young man who loved her \u2014 had loved her at first sight, but loved his duty more. Though it was getting dark, there was just light enough for him to be aware of them. ' For Heaven's sake,' he cried, ' what have I done !"], [118, "110 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH I have upset you with this miserable talk ! Forgive me!1 She rose and wiped away her tears. She was con science-struck. For she remembered the motives that had brought her there that night, remembered how cruelly she had meant to turn this noble heart to her own ends. She could hardly bear the thought of it. If only she could persuade herself that she had acted on the information given her by Mrs. Merritt in a spirit not entirely wanton, that a mere particle of feel ing for her victim had entered into her desire to bring about this meeting with him, she felt she could endure it. But no. She was only too bitterly aware that no trace of such had entered her thoughts \u2014 that she had considered him solely as a means to repair her broken love, and to bring once more to her feet the only man that she could ever care for. Oh, was there nothing she could do to lighten just the least her weight of guilt ? Friendship and sympathy, alas ! were all. But she could show him those, if only he would not refuse them \u2014 would give her opportunity. She racked her brains for ways and means. But he held out his hand, smiling. ' I must go,1 he said ; ' I have done wrong to worry you so with me and my affairs, fishing for sympathy, while all the while I was pretending to be strong and self-reliant. Forgive me, won't you, and I promise you you shall see very little more of me.' ' Oh, don't, don't say that !' she cried. ' How can you think that you have worried me ! Do stay. I want to speak of lots of things.' ' I must not. I have done harm enough already. I"], [119, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 111 am too much a blunderer. There are things we cannot safely talk about.1 ' Then we will talk of something else,1 she said, ' of anything. Do you admire our church ?' He laughed. ' Oh, yes,1 he said. ' I believe there are some points in it that are unique \u2014 the corbels of the main arch beneath the tower, for instance.1 ' Lideed ! What are they ? Do show them me !' She had sat weekly in that edifice for years, but had never, as yet, been struck by any of its beauties. ' You will \u2014 you will come,' she cried, seeing him hesitate, ' to-morrow morning ? Now, I shall look out for you between nine and ten.' She held out her hand and he took it, though without response. A footstep on the road alarmed them. ' There, then, it's settled ! Good-night, good-night !' she cried, and left him. He turned towards the wicket-gate and opened it, this time with more address than on the first occasion, and passed into the road. The tall figure of a man was standing in the dark upon the path some yards away. Edgar Mayland did not recognise him, and, turning nervously away, he strode off home."], [120, "CHAPTER X. When Mayland entered the sitting-room, he found, as he expected, his friend was there before him. The usual cold supper was on the table, of which Simeon had already plentifully partaken, and had dropped back into his easy-chair with his short pipe in his mouth. He greeted the new-comer with more than ordinary brusqueness, and went on reading the paper in his hand. The other respected his clear wish to be let alone, and sat down quietly, to eat with more zest than usual. For, though little satisfied with his night's work, and not a little shaken by the failure of its principal intent, he was, on the whole, in spirits. He felt like one coming from confession, with a burden of dishonesty and deceit cast from him, and with the fair certainty \u2014 as he now felt the assurance \u2014 that its temporary possession of his soul had harmed none else but him self. And now he was quit of it, and he could look his friend in the face and speak out without qualms, especially since on his way home he had decided abso lutely to avoid the meeting with Polly on the morrow,"], [121, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 113 and, what was more, to depart from Great Marley itself for good and all at the earliest date possible. So he ate and drank with a light heart, though his meat was but tough hackings from a well-persecuted ham-bone, and his drink a pale and acrid liquor yclept ' cider ' out of courtesy to its provider and the country side. But presently he had finished, and then he turned himself in his seat and eyed his friend. And soon the latter's face was raised from his page to meet him. ' You were late to-night, Mayland,1 he said. ' Yes, Simeon ; I was unexpectedly detained.1 ' Unexpectedly ?1 ' Certainly. Why not ?' ' I did not exactly catch the word,1 replied the other dryly, turning away his head. ' Simeon,1 began Mayland again after a pause, ' I want to make a confession.' ' Go ahead.1 ' I have done wrong. I have spoken without suffi cient thought.1 ' That's not unlikely. I do often. What matter ?' ' But it matters very much, my friend,' returned Mayland ; ' I have misled you, Simeon.' ' A mild way of putting it,' thought Simeon, as he put down his book. So, then, a true and full account of it all was coming. And a pretty story of humbug it would be ! ' I don't think you have,' he said bluntly. ' You are too good to say so,' replied Mayland, ' but unfortunately I know better. Simeon, it is the love of woman that I refer to.' 8"], [122, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 114 ' Guessed as much.' ' Indeed ! Your thoughts are mine, then. Yes, Simeon, I regret them now, sorrowfully and profoundly, the words I have so often allowed myself to use to you on this matter. I regret deeply that I should have said that the priest of God had no concern therein \u2014 that another life was set before him. I see now my error; I see the beauty of a pure affection, and I am very sorry that anything that I have said should have dis inclined you also to perceive it, or, at least, not to pursue it with the resolution you otherwise would have had.' ' Don't trouble about me, Mayland,' said Jebb, ' let's hear about yourself.' ' It is about us both I speak, Simeon, since we have found ourselves so alike in mind, if not in person, since we have lived like brothers, from the first moment we met opening our minds to each other without reserve of any kind. And shall I commence now to keep to myself apart, as if this had not been, the new light I receive, especially when the darkness that it comes to dissipate is of my making, and has been imposed on you against your better sense ? No, let me speak for both of us.' ' So you have found that celibacy is a good creed until one falls in love ?' said Simeon. ' I agree with you.' Edgar Mayland felt a shock of pained perplexity. He paused. ' I did not mean anything of the kind,' he said at last. ' I was about to say that I had discovered that celibacy \u2014 that is, a self-imposed celibacy, not one that"], [123, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 115 comes from an inward tendency of certain shrinking, and perhaps shrunken natures \u2014 was a wrong thing and hypocritical, an egoism, a self-exaltation, a wanton turning aside from the good things of God which He has given us for our consolation and perfection.

' I believe it has been dawning on me for many days, but the crowning revelation of it I received to night.' ' And the Divine agency ; how came it to you ?' ' I cannot tell you how it came.' ' That's strange. And will it come to me also, do you think ? I am of the flesh as you are, and, indeed, I had reason to think myself a little more so. Surely I should share with you this great enlightenment.1 ' I know you will, Simeon,1 replied Mayland warmly, ' I know you will, for all I see you are a little scornful, and I fear the poison of my former doctrine has sunk deep in you \u2014 yes, deep, and that explains all things,' he added quietly. ' Explains what ?' ' Ah, we know what,1 with a tender playfulness ; ' still, a day will come.1 ' You are mysterious, Mayland,1 said Simeon, rising with ill-concealed disgust. ' And I thought that every thing was open between us, eh ? Brothers, was it not ? Well, I think I'll clear off. If I stay longer I may discover something too, which perhaps Fd better not.

'Jealous,' he murmured \u2014 'jealous ! And who knows but it is as well ? It may be mine to make you more so yet.1"], [125, "CHAPTER XI. Breakfast over, Simeon Jebb retired to his room and wrote a letter which he addressed to Mrs. Susan French ; and then he sought his good friend Georgie for its safe delivery that very morning. Now, the way from the village of Great Marley to the Leasowes we have already followed in the company of Simeon Jebb himself, and we know that its two miles by road were considerably curtailed by a short cut across the fields, and should easily be covered there and back in one good hour. And yet it was not often that that errand, which he had run many times of late for his friend the curate, was accomplished on the part of Georgie Merritt in much less than three. In the first place, Georgie was one of those blest individuals to whom time is no great object, and by whom, if it were to be considered at all, it would only be with a view to its best means of destruction. And during holidays this was a problem that beset him with such an importunate persistence that he had at last become of sheer necessity a past master in the art of its solution. So when he started out on that fine morning for the Leasowes, the last thing in the world that entered into his head was the duty of executing"], [126, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 118 his commission with promptness and alacrity. On the contrary, he understood himself merely to have received instructions to deliver his charge that morning, that was all. Hence, in doing so, that length of time was before him, which, as he reckoned it, would be four long hours. To which he must do his best to adjust himself. But now it was with some real concern for his reputation as a time-killer that he recognised this to be more than the maximum duration to which he had ever been able to prolong this mission. It was a matter which would require great skill. Still, he would do his best. So having moved for the most part of the way through the village with his face turned backwards, and having chased Mrs. Gamble's ducks into her yard, from which they had wandered, with so much vigour as to bring that good lady out to her cottage door with more strong words than thanks, and having stopped at the smithy at the village end to offer his assistance in calming Mr. Brown's bay pony, which had never been properly broken, and had a temperament that held in detestation many things, and not the least small boys, and having been told plainly by the perspiring smith that his presence was more disadvantageous than other wise, and thus being compelled for want of other claims upon his philanthropic interference to pursue his way up past the church into the hot silent country road, he was driven to exert his intellectual faculties with more than ordinary acuteness to devise some means whereby, other than merely lying in the hot grass, he might spin out that task imposed on him. Now after revolving many possibilities in his brain"], [127, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 119 which were all on further cogitation found in some thing wanting, he struck at last on one idea with which he had often wrestled, and which now he felt, in the presence of surpassing opportunity, had germinated sufficiently to put it to the test. It was in reality a simple one enough, no doubt, and one with which we are all familiar; but to Georgie it was original, and therefore precious. It was merely this : that by applying moisture to the exterior surface of an envelope in the part where it had been stuck down, it might be made to yield to gentle treatment in the matter of revealing its hidden con tents, and that afterwards the same could be all neatly re-adjusted without the faintest suspicion on the part of anyone, however prying, of what had taken place. It was the daily observation of so many mysteriously directed epistles that entered the big bag in his mother's shop-window, and which the postman removed and sorted sometimes before his eyes that had inspired him with this bold idea. One day, at last, he had ventured to suggest it to his mother, when he had been met by so vigorous a denunciation of its criminality that he had felt it thenceforth his imperative duty to seek an early opportunity of pursuing it to a practical issue. And now it recurred to him with the force of inspiration; for the means of experiment and the time were both well within his reach. He pulled out that letter from his pocket and examined it on all points, especially its well -secured adhesion. Yes, it was a good case, and typical, and one worthy of essay."], [128, "120 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH But water; whence that? Not far to seek. That little runlet at the foot of the spinney crossed by the old plank bridge was right before him. He hurried with enthusiasm towards it. He was soon descending the rough, brambly slope to the water's edge. There arrived, he sat himself down, with his feet half in the stream, and took leisurely counsel with himself again. And things were soothing down there in that depth, with the bridge high above his head. Many besides Georgie would have been dis inclined to hasty action in that shaded, rippling peace, among the small green rushes and the waterweeds, on which the straggling rays of the great sun far up above blazing the broad world came down through barring branch of ash and sapling oak, and filled those stream worn meshes of green life with a wealth of glistening air beads. Yes, Georgie felt that he might well take time to meditate, and perhaps, when he was a little cooler, light would come to him on a vexed question of pro cedure which in the glare and bewilderment of that other world above he had felt a trifle hard to settle. It was this : whether it would be better to stoop down and place the whole of the one surface of that envelope in contact with the clear running water, or whether it would be neater and easier to raise on his forefinger a sufficiency of the fluid, and apply it to the right place in the right amount. He soon decided on the latter ; he felt it to be a more scientific and direct procedure, even if it took more time \u2014 and certainly more safe. And so pre sently, feeling the time for action had arrived, he got"], [129, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 121 upon his knees, and dipping his outstretched finger in the stream, carried the dripping moisture to the letter in his other hand. Now, one objection to this method Georgie had not taken into account, which was the possibility of his fingers being dirty \u2014 in fact, their normal state \u2014 when the drops that fell upon the clean surface of that envelope would be dirty also, with a plain result. He was painfully aware of this calamity as soon as it occurred, but, none the less, with the dogged resolution of the true investigator, he determined to ignore it and pursue his purpose to the end. And a great deal of pursuing it demanded, of dabbing not only with the forefinger, but with all the other fingers, before the realization of his theory gave the first sign of ac complishment in the loosening of the upper portion of that paper lip that Simeon's strong fist had flattened down so firmly. At the sight of this, enthusiasm overcame his prudence, and he applied a feeble tension to accelerate the glad success that now in measurable distance he saw near. But, unhappily, sodden paper is poor stuff, and preferred to rip rather than wrestle in its integrity with the still obstinate adhesive. After that Georgie pulled up and grew more circumspect, so that when, finally, the whole of that operation of unloosening had been accomplished, there were altogether not more than two or three big rips to spoil the beauty of his work. Georgie felt that they were trifles in view of the neat and happy verification of a long-treasured inspira tion. A smile ineffable as he thought of his mother's silly prohibition crossed his face."], [130, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 122 For a time he sat quite still, and brooded with the open letter in his hand, enjoying the contemplation of his own cleverness and the sense of work well done. Then he drew up his legs, stretched himself, and asked what next. Simply to reseal that letter and take it on to its destination. To do him justice, that was the first answer to the question that at once occurred to him. For was it not true that the operation which he had just conducted with so much address had been directed only to the one simple end of demonstration of fact, which his mother's narrow-mindedness had nettled him to make, and was entirely void of any prying and improper curiosity as to the contents of that envelope, which were doubtless on dry matters with which any self-respecting boy, particularly in holiday time, would no more care to soil the fine freedom of his soul than he would with physical cosmography or the rule of three ? And yet that still present problem, the employment of four hours on a task where one sufficed, returned on him with all its force and gave him pause. Now, was not here another heaven-sent means to its solution ? Could, after all, a half hour be better or more conscientiously spent than in deciphering a difficult manuscript, that in itself was a matter of no interest whatever, and probably in comprehensible to a plain intelligence? Of course, the answer must be in the affirmative, if only he were willing to undertake so hard a task. With a sentiment of noble resolution he drew that piece of paper out, and, placing the envelope upon the damp moss beside him, opened it and made essay. It was a good, round hand, and its subject, after all, was"], [131, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 123 not unnecessarily obscure. Georgie absorbed it with a quaint grin, which spread wider and wider over his face. But, as he came slowly to the end, he realized what he had done, that he had broken in upon secrets of other souls, and in nervous trepidation he sought the envelope to hide his indiscretion. He gave just another hurried glance at the epistle before he reinserted it, and then set to work to readjust things with vigour. But it was a bad performance, for, in consequence of the over-soaking of the gummed edge, it seemed to have entirely lost its character, and required violent and re peated efforts to make it stick, and, in consequence of the before-mentioned rents his impatient fingers had in flicted, together with the muddy impress they had left behind, the aspect of the reverse side of that envelope was not exactly what it should have been, and supplied Georgie with much food for regret and speculation as to its probable reception at the hands of the awful Mrs. French. A hot flush ran over him as with one hand he scratched his head and with the other pressed with the whole weight of his small body on the obstinate in adhesiveness of that still sodden surface. A hot flush, and we are not sure that the desperate necessity of doing away with that epistle altogether and trusting to luck to save him from the consequences was not budding in his brain. But if so, it did not have time to long gestate there. A sharp whistle came from the bridge above him, and a sharper voice. ' Hello ! what are you doing down there, young nipper ? Bring that up.' Georgie looked up with burning face, and recognised"], [132, "124 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH Tom French. The tall young farmer was leaning on the one hand-rail to that giddy little bridge far up aloft, but not so far that he could fail to see every thing that he was doing down below. Now Georgie admired Mr. French as a knowing agriculturist, but did not love him. He was generally a trifle brusque and patronizing to little boys, and was inclined to treat them all as if they were his own farm lads. Georgie resented this, and felt defiance ; but, for all that, he did not dare now to disobey. ' Come on, look sharp !' cried the voice again. He scrambled to his feet, and slowly and reluctantly worked up that bank again to the open ground above. A thought of flight then took possession of him, but it was nipped upon the instant, for his enemy had turned back to meet him, and was now face to face with him. ' What is it you have there ?' demanded Tom sternly. ' Where is it ?' Georgie had shoved the letter into his pocket, and now affected ignorance of Tom's request. ' That letter, or whatever it was. Come, out with it.' ' It's not for you,' said Georgie sullenly, standing at bay. ' Not for me, isn't it ! Who is it for, then ? And what were you doing down there with it ? Show it up !' ' Ain't told to,' muttered Georgie stubbornly. ' Mr. Jebb said I wuzn't ter give it to no one.' 'Indeed. Mr. Jebb told you that, did he? And that's a letter he has given you to deliver, and you've been playing tricks with it ? Very well. Unless you hand it over to me sharp, on the spot, I shall just let him know.'"], [133, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 125 Georgie began to weep bitterly. ' 'E said \u2014 it wuz \u2014 only 'er I wuz ter give it to,' he sobbed ; ' pert'ickler not you.' ' Come, quick,' said Tom. ' How long ?' Slowly, and with much reluctance, Georgie's one hand went down into his pocket, whilst he wiped his eyes with the back of the other, and produced that wretched wreck of a letter, of which the masterful Tom at once relieved him. It was indeed a woeful spectacle, for though under the vigorous inducement that Georgie had administered in those last throes of fright the envelope had actually consented to be once again stuck down, yet in what fashion ! With bigger rents than ever, and all awry, and, to add to the grimed aspect of the back, sodden with the washings of those fingers that last were fidgeting with the blacksmith's tools, the face of the envelope also was now all daubed with fresh red stains of mother earth. It was a bad business, Georgie did not deceive himself about that, and one that even any amount of lying could not remedy. Tears alone were left to him. He called upon them with all the abandon of despair. He threatened to become hysterical \u2014 at any rate, he sank down upon the grass, and tore great handfuls of it like a maniac as he sobbed. And all the while the cold-blooded Tom stood there, looking now at that awful envelope, and now at him, as if measuring the enormity of the crime and its reward. 'And you were to give this to Mrs. French, were you,' he said at last, ' and to no one else, particularly me, eh ?' ' Ye-e-e-s,' sobbed Georgie."], [134, "126 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 'And so you thought that hardly straightforward, eh, and required looking into ?' Georgie stopped sobbing, and regarded his inter locutor with some surprise. A luminous suggestion had occurred to him. ' I thought 'e'd no business ter go carryin' on be'ind 1and that ways,1 he said. Tom French stared blankly at him. ' Then if you thought that, get up,1 he said. Georgie rose to his feet again with hope. But Tom took him by the scruff of his neck and held him out before him with his face away from him. ' Well, then, remember for the future,1 he said, ' that I can carry on behind as well as he can.1 And he administered with his free hand two rousing cuffs on each side of that juvenile head, and then, with a shake, he sent the small sinner homewards once again, sobbing enough to burst every button on his person, and, turning back himself across the bridge, he strode with swinging steps up the pasture towards his own threshold. But he had scarce gone twenty paces up the slope when he stopped dead once more, and, looking around, took thought. ' Carrying on behindhand.1 Those were the boy^ words, and the little beggar must have meant something by them. What could it be ? From Simeon Jebb ! Tom remembered now that more than once lately he had noticed his mother to have received letters brought at other times than by post, but he had never troubled to guess from whom they came. Could all have been from that one quarter ? Why, and wherefore ? ' Carrying on behindhand.1 Those were the words."], [135, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 127 And the lad was as sharp a little customer as any about. What could it mean ? Then, for the first time, flashed on him the possibility of there being anything betwixt his mother and Simeon Jebb of which he had been kept ignorant, and which this boy now knew of. For was it not fairly certain that the young scamp had had the letter out and read it ? And not this one for the first, either. ' By Gad I1 cried Tom, ' if there should be anything, to have it known by this small lout and all his folk before me ! To be made a laughing-stock all round !' Then he looked again at the letter. And what was the good of delivering it to his mother in that state ? Why, actually it had become again unsealed. ' Well, now she'll swear I've read it, so I'd better put her in the right once for all. Here goes.' He tore out the note, and this is what he read : 'My Dearest Susan, ' It's all up with T and P or as near as it doesn't matter. That fellow's got her.

I told him I believed she wanted him, and he believed me.

The dust rose thick beneath his horse's feet, but he did not heed it ; some heifers had strayed on to the roadside, but he did not stop to inquire whose they were. He spurred on hurriedly, and when he did stop, it was only because he was hailed vigorously by a limping figure from over that same stile that Simeon Jebb had crossed to take his short cut to the Leasowes Farm. It was old George Merritt. He, too, was taking the same track, and, seeing the young master on the high-road behind him, had turned and hailed him. With painful gait, he came back to the stile while Tom rode up close to the other side. George held out a letter. Tom took it, and knew from whence it came at a glance."], [137, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 129 ' You have just left them, and are coming to me ?' he said. ' That's it, sir,' answered George, 'just o' the way.' ' All right, and if you meet that young hopeful of yours, send him on home quick, where his mother will be waiting for him, and someone else besides.' With that Tom trotted on, leaving old George to turn slowly and wonderingly towards his son and heir, who, with suffering spirit, was at that very moment to be seen creeping along the footpath at the far side of the field. Scarcely round the next bend in the road, Tom pulled up once more, and tore out and read that second letter. And, after he had done so, he drove his spurs into his horse's flank in a mood by no means milder. 9"], [138, "CHAPTER XII. It was with a somewhat broken and a contrite spirit that Miss Polly Somers had retired to rest that night of her last interview with Edgar Mayland. She sighed much, and informed herself very frequently that life was not worth living. As has been indicated, this was an altogether new discovery on her part, and one, until recently, she had never dreamed of. But now, none the less, it was a fact beyond dispute. For more than a fortnight she had seen or heard naught of the person who was always in her thoughts, and the daily expected letter with the news that Mrs. French had at last received her conge, begging forgive ness for the delay in administering it, and declaring that now the writer was for her and her- alone, though watched for morning after morning, never came. And now, finally, the one resource she had clung to as a means of bringing about that desirable end had been taken from her also, and was replaced with shame that she could ever have entertained it. And she felt fear fully angry with the cruel Tom for having driven her to think of it. It would punish him well if she were to clear herself of its reproach in a manner he, perhaps,"], [139, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 131 would not like. It would serve him right if she were to cultivate a genuine feeling for this poor young clergy man who loved her so, and yet would not allow his love to attempt to drag her down to the hard level of his own sad life, for which he saw she was not fit. Master Tom had better take care and not go too far. If this other were not so handsome as he, he was, at least, tenderer and far less masterful ; and these were con siderations to be thought about. Besides, it was not certain that it was absolutely impossible to wean him from those slums to which he had said his life was dedicated ; there was no knowing how his tone might not alter if he found his love reciprocated, or what he might not then do for the sake of her. True, he was an ignoramus as regarded her world, and she found it difficult to suppress her innate contempt for such \u2014 her hero having always been one who could at least sit well in the saddle, and use the right terms for all things of fur and feather. But, then, in a clergyman all this was different, and its want would be certainly excusable. There might even be some pleasure in initiating her husband into the mysteries of country life, and claiming and receiving a title of superiority thereon \u2014 a privilege worth having. It was a dream that was new to her, and, although she had no taste or instinct for the role of a cleryman's good-wife, it was not without allurement. It was at least worth considering. But, when she rose early the next morning, as was her habit, fresh and bright from a healthy sleep, she found that threat of a new departure less alluring in the light of day, with the fresh hope that it never failed to bring her, and her faith in her 9\u20142"], [140, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 132 old lover's sooner or later restoration to her rose as strong as ever \u2014 his obdurate resistance to demands that any girl would have a right to make seeming quite impossible. And so she found herself again, as always, listening eagerly for the postman's step, and as she moved about the little duties of the morning which she cheerfully called her own, giving out the corn for the fowls, inspecting the milk-pans, etc., she turned her ears repeatedly in one direction for the well-known footstep which arrived with regularity in the early hours ; for the Great Marley postman had many miles to cover every morning ere he could get back in haste to his garden and his family of porkers at the village end. And when at length he did come, instead of letting Bessie, the kitchenmaid, as was her wont, waste five minutes of her time in giggling chatter at the back door whilst she herself waited \u2014 patiently sympathizing with Bessie's flirtings \u2014 for her slow return, she for once forestalled the girl completely, and went in haste to meet him, a kind of inspiration moving her to expecta tion that this morning would not, could not, fail her. Nor did it. With a cheerful touch of his forehead, the good fellow thrust into her hands a letter, and she did not need to inspect it twice. She smiled and nodded, and slipped it into her pocket as she turned away. Now Polly knew quite well that her affairs were almost as interesting to some others as to herself, and that two eyes at least besides her own knew that she had received a letter. So, instead of running off to her bedroom on the spot, she affected the greatest uncon-"], [141, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 133 cern to know its contents, and lingered in the large kitchen finishing her various operations till Bessie's impatient longing to see what impression that morning's message made on her young mistress's face was quite worn out. Then she stole carefully away, and, locking her bedroom door behind her, tore it open. Its handwriting was round and clear and painstaking, its spelling was not irreproachable, its punctuation nil. It ran thus : 'My Darling Polly*, ' I am writing this in great haste because I cant for the world let another day go by and you not hear from me How its hapened that I have behaved like this is more than I could tell you if you were to ask me Because we just had a little word on a small matter of next to no account whatever in the long run and what I ought to have known you couldent realy mean to make so much of I must go right off in a hot tiff and leave you all by your poor little self all this while to wonder how I could be such a wretch And now its me who has to wonder how I shall ever dare to meet you face to face again O Polly it seems past beleiving I could have so behaved to you write me quick and tell me you forgive me Polly my darling wont you.

' Soon ! Never !' she exclaimed, as she crushed the letter in her hand, and sprang to her feet, her face flushed, her eyes moist with anger and disappointment, and paced her little room with tragic passion, all the more startling as she was not one to whom that mood was natural. ' A small matter ! Next to no account ! Indeed ! After what I said ! A small matter, is it, Tom French ? You will find it, I think, a very big matter \u2014 a matter that once and for all, Mr. French, parts you and me, sir !

And then she fell again into her chair and sobbed bitterly. Once she essayed a second time to read the miserable epistle through her tears ; then, failing, she tore it into little bits upon her lap. After a while she grew calmer, rose and threw the fragments into the empty grate, and, pushing them into a little heap, struck a match and burnt them. And then she washed her face and removed as far as possible the marks of tears, recombed her hair, and generally restored the brightness of her person. After that, she got out her writing-case, and inscribed the following \u25a0"], [143, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 135 'Sir, ' I hope you will not trouble me any further with your extraordinary communications.

So, as she folded up that letter and addressed it, she was not unconscious of a certain satisfaction in the dexterity with which she was committing that act of felo-de-se. This consoled her, and, besides, she was by no means entirely prepared to acknowledge it to be such. Already, as she ran downstairs to breakfast, she was restoring to her imagination once again the half-formed fancy of the night before ; already, while at table in the"], [144, "136 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH presence of her parents, whose laconic qualities were favourable to the current of her thoughts, she was striving hard to reconcile with her old inborn sense of a fine hfe and healthful another, soberer and more re strained, and with a life's companion of another cast, whose need of her would be expressed in strangely different words from those she had looked forward to \u2014 a need of one to share his toil, to animate his hopes, to tend his sick, to succour his forlorn, to make perfection of the imperfections of his strength, to know herself his indispensable, in truth, his better half ! It was a prospect that had sent a shiver through her frame out there last night, but, singularly, not so now. How was it that at this moment it almost grew to seem congenial and familiar \u2014 how that strangely she commenced to wonder whether, after all, she had not brushed aside her better fate ? How, indeed ! Cer tainly she could not tell. But, as certainly, she rose from breakfast with new spirits, and her face was almost joyful. ' George Merritt's finishin' this mornin',' observed Bessie, ' and goin' on to Leasowes. He's jest telled me hisself.' ' Yes,' said Polly ; ' and I shall be glad when he is gone.' She was not a little ashamed now to remember why she had been hitherto welcoming his presence in her father's rickyard \u2014 to play the part of spy. But pre sently she slipped out there herself, and hailed him from his work. ' A letter for Mr. French,' she said. ' You will give it carefully ?'"], [145, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 137 A smirk of satisfaction crossed old George's features to find that correspondence was moving again in the right direction. He gave the necessary assurances of prompt and personal delivery, and Polly turned away. But she did not straight re-enter. On the contrary, having her broad straw-hat upon her head, she wandered down by a private way to the meadows that lay below the church, from which, as she knew, a morning visitor might be met making his way up towards it in response to her last-night's invitation. But, seeing no one coming, she entered the churchyard by the wicket -gate therefrom, and crept up the leaf-screened path \u2014 now once more sound and dry, owing to her father's care \u2014 and approached that small side-porch before alluded to facing the homestead of the Church Farm. There arrived, she saw to her delight the door within was open, and she entered promptly. Though for nearly twenty years she had lived beside it, she could never remember having entered that silent edifice upon a week-day in that way before, except when once or twice she had assisted in the Christmas or Harvest decorations \u2014 an employment in which she had felt none too happy and a little patronized as a simple farmer's daughter by the ladies who usually undertook those duties. As she stepped in, the dark, chill air impressed her, and her healthy, sunny nature shuddered at the contrast of that grave interior with the warmth and open geniality of the outer world.

For her part, she had always felt it to be pervaded with an atmosphere too artificial to be more than just supported \u2014 since that, of course, was the right thing to do at least once a week \u2014 and in reality a place to be cheerfully escaped from, and to be thought of, if at all, with respect, but never love. And now, empty, sonorous, and chill, it seemed almost uncanny \u2014 by no means a pleasant rendezvous. And there was no evidence of a single soul within it ; and yet the door had been open. On tiptoe, with a nervous dread, as though she were breaking into a neighbour's house, and picking up her pale-blue-striped print dress with one hand, to prevent it rustling on the matting beneath her feet, she moved up between the stalls to the altar-steps. And there, she turned and stared wonderingly about her at the absence of all clue to the whereabouts of him she sought. Then to one side of her there was a motion, and from an aisle she saw him suddenly approaching, his face a little flushed, his manner flurried. He had probably, by the way in which he lightly dusted his lower limbs with his one hand, just risen from his knees. She gave a little cry of surprise ; then, blushing strongly, went to meet him. ' You are here ! I am so glad !' she cried. ' I feared you were not.' He flushed a little as he shook hands, but found no words. ' You did not expect me ? Is that it ?' she asked. ' Oh yes, indeed I did,' he answered ; ' but you came ill so quietly. I did not hear you.'"], [147, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 139 ' I was afraid,' she said, laughing ; ' it seemed so creepy-like \u2014 all empty. I didn't like it.

For you, at any rate, it only has to be sought and taken \u2014 and sought not far.1 He had spoken with a visible effort. There was now a pause. How was it that that advocacy for which he was again beside her was so much harder than he had expected it to be ? But she was wondering if he could be speaking for himself. If not \u2014 oh dear ! \u2014 how much would she have to say and do to make him ! ' I wanted so to know about all that,1 at last she said, with a wave of the hand to the walls about her.

Are they not quaint \u2014 I believe there is not another example like them in the United Kingdom \u2014 and beautiful, too, I think.1 She pursed her little lips. ' You don't think so ?' he went on.

When I am in that pulpit I have no doubt your eyes wander even through short sermons.1 ' How can you say so I1 she interposed reprovingly. ' But, luckily, you have not had that temptation often, nor will you in the future.1 ' It is unkind to talk so I1 she replied with warmth. ' You wish to get away from us just when we've got to know you. You might at least think of me !' He looked at her with some surprise. After what he had said the previous night, how could she so speak ! Had he not clearly said that he had thought of her, alas ! too much, and explained all else beside ? If she were going to commence again on dangerous ground, he should wish he had not come again to meet her. He had understood all that was settled. He affected to ignore her observation. ' But I wish to say,' he went on, ' that you could do worse than let your eyes wander, as wander they must, to these fine tokens of our faith in stone and glass \u2014 far better than to let them wander, as with so many, to their neighbours' bonnets or other finery.1 ' Oh, you think us very silly creatures I1 she exclaimed with irritation.

He flushed, and as she raised her eyes again he felt she saw it. Why had he come there against his better judgment? Why had he so soon forgotten the fear that had assailed him on the night before that she was not absolutely indifferent to him ? Why had he been so well per suaded that to pity alone was attributable her conduct then, her final warmth and friendliness, and that by the stern picture of the fate before him which he had painted for her, he had effectually nipped in the bud any tendency to deeper sentiment ? For was it not clear that he had failed, and that he was once more treacherously, under pretence of working for his friend, playing the part of rival, and snatching upon the sly a portion of this girl's unsettled heart, perhaps never after to be wholly restored to that other in its perfect state ? Why had he come ? Why did he not now, under any or no excuse, go \u2014 go on the spot ? But he did not \u2014 he could not. Did he tell himself that he could yet be justified by further advocacy of his friend's cause as before ? Hardly"], [150, "142 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH that, for the plain failure of his first attempt was still too vivid to be passed by. Did he tell himself that he was strong enough to play out his part unharmed, and by cold words to let her see once for all his feeling ? Hardly that either ; for this very feeling gave the lie to such a confidence, and was by his own confession to her of a nature far removed from coldness. And yet he stayed.

' I don't know of anything worth talking about,' she answered drearily. She gave him up. He was hope less. He was positively maddening. It was true that on the night before she had shown genuine feeling for the motives which were actuating him in his refusal of all effort to obtain her love. But then, she had not entertained a serious thought con cerning him, whereas now the case was vastly different. She had come prepared to show him such a clear return for his own feeling as she had little doubt would speedily overcome his scruples either as regarded his friend or the way of life he had selected. She was now quite aghast at her mistake. She was utterly at a loss to know what to do next. It was most vexatious. Besides, she felt almost as if she had been insulted. He had had no business to make what was practically a confession of love for her, and then to refuse all response like this. Such conduct might be very cruel. As if any man was called on to sacrifice himself in the matter of love ! His friend, indeed !

And she might have known it. The very wildness of his speech should have revealed this to her. Indeed, for his part, he had felt all the while he spoke that it was doing so. He had felt as a drowning man who casts his arms into the air to make one last and greater protest against the watery hold around him, and thereby sinks the sooner to the depths of its merciless embrace. He had said truly his brain was in a whirl. His limbs seemed weak beneath him. To add to his distress, her altered and unhappy tone fell on him with an accusation of unkindness and of the mischief he was fated to pursue. He found no words.

The mere effort to arrange his thoughts, not to appear too utterly inconsequent in his treatment of a subject in itself impersonal and remote, and, if anything, the visible expression of past conquer ing souls, all this regained him gradually that mastery of his own that had been slipping from him, and presently he found himself composedly permitting his regard and hers to meet, as when from time to time she ventured on some query more or less inept, and which to the ear of a preceptor less enthralled and less conscious of inconsequence himself would have been exasperating proof of his pupil's inattention or stu pidity. But for her it was quite different. In proportion as she saw him growing prosaically serene again, her vexation was continually augmented ; bitterly now she regarded the impatience at a first check which had inspired her to turn him off on this side track, when a little more persistence might perhaps, after all, have brought him to the mark and forced him to declare his scruples past and overborne \u2014 when, clearly, as she saw now in the contrast of his in creasing coolness, he had been well - nigh at working heat, to be forged and moulded as she would. She was as angry with herself as with him. Soon she could suffer it no longer, and, after some further efforts to arrest his talk or change its course, at last flushed, and with flaming eyes, she found some hasty excuse as to affairs awaiting her, and with the barest handshake and o-ood-bye, fled from that place and left him standing there alone to his own thoughts. 10"], [154, "CHAPTER XIII. Edgar Mayland was alone once more within the church. She was gone, and all was silent round him. He moved back from the door to which he had accompanied her, and fell upon a cushioned seat against the nearest stalls. Then he buried his face in both his hands.

The latter had as good as hinted that he was indifferent how soon. A slight excuse would serve. Thank Heaven for that ! And there was every hope that the attachment which his mischievous interference had done its best to ruin would sooner or later be resuming its true course ; for, if his friend Simeon were the man he had taken him for, he would not long be able to preserve his present mood ; and as for her, she had most certainly been strongly drawn to him, and, if she had let her fancy stray now for a while, it would assuredly return ere long to its old flame. No, there could be no doubt of her. Had she not made him, Mayland, certain of her feeling from the very first ? that she had sought his acquaint ance solely for his friend's sake, hoping vaguely for his aid, though, when it came too brusquely, she had shown no small offence?

A prayer of thanks passed through his heart as he strode gladly on. Two hours later he was ascending Mrs. Merritt's staircase with a spirit soothed and gratified from inter course with those poor folk, who had already learnt to love him, and still more conscious than before that he could now look his friend in the face with a clear mind. He pushed the door of the sitting-room open freely, and stepped in. Simeon was there, punctual as usual, awaiting dinner, for which the cloth was laid ; but with him there was also another. Mayland started. For a moment he did not recognise the face.

But, none the less, a feeling of real anger with his friend Simeon for his coyness, a conduct which had already brought him, Mayland, much trouble and heart-pain, rose within him. He felt inclined to read him a lesson \u2014 and in public, too. 'Mr. French,' he said, turning to that gentleman, who stood with an expression of strange astonishment, 'you are a young man yourself, and will, no doubt, be"], [159, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 151 soon putting into practice the hint you just now gave me, and which, not being at heart young myself, I handed on to my friend here. So you can tell me. What do you think of one who, with a passionate and pure attachment, as I am sure he has, for a youno lady ' ' What on earth are you raving about ?' cried Simeon. * Are you mad, Mayland ? Shut up, and stop talking balderdash.' Mayland turned again with a look aghast, but at that moment Mrs. Merritt entered with the steaming joint, and there was mutual silence while she placed it on the small, round table. Only Tom gave a low whistle, and then they all three sat down, for Simeon had evidently previously invited the young farmer to stay dinner. No one spoke. Simeon, luckily, was able to give his whole attention to the carving, and, until the landlady had retired, conversation had a plausible excuse for not flourishing. But when they were alone again, the guest, at least, felt it his duty to offer some observation. Mayland certainly was incapable of one, for he was trembling all over, being horror-struck to think of the explosion he had brought upon himself, and to see by the expression of his countenance how deeply Simeon was raging inwardly against him. He had always said that his friend's character was a problem to him ; now it was something more, almost a terror. He felt too unhinged to think or talk, and could only keep casting shy glances at the other to see if his face were softening. But Tom spoke. ' Not bred to the country, Mr. Mayland ? Thorough townsman, I suppose ?'"], [160, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 152 ' Yes.1 ' New sort of life for you here, then ? Going back soon ?' ' Yes, very soon.' Tom nodded dubiously. ' I only came to recruit my health a little,' went on Mayland, forcing himself to speak. ' I had never any intention of a long stay. I have work elsewhere where I am wanted more. I must return to it.' Simeon and Tom exchanged glances. ' Why, I should have thought there was work enough to do here,' said the latter. ' Quite so, but of a different quality, and more are ready to undertake it. There is sin and suffering here, and enough of it, but it is less benighted ; at least, it is upon a brighter background, bathed in sun and air, and bounded with the green earth, whereas, where I go the earth is black, the air also, the sun a white disc scarcely discernible from the gray sky around it. Your sins, at least, are smiled upon, whilst over ours is one dark pall of gloom.' ' All the less excuse for these folk here,1 cried Tom sturdily, whose sense of the well-being of the work people dependent on him was not small, and whose indignation with the endless peculations and evasions of duty with which they repaid him was at all times ready ; ' all the less excuse, and all the more amazing that they don't seem to know how to thank their betters for putting up with them. And that's what it comes to, putting up with this, that, and the other from year's end to year's end, sheer trying not to notice things, till you can't stand it any longer, and there's a"], [161, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 153 good blow up. After that things settle down just as before. By Gad ! there's work enough for you here to teach these folk that good pay means good work, and no pilfering. That's as good a job as any you've got away there.' There was a moment's pause. Mayland was secretly admiring the naivete of the young fellow, who seemed to regard a minister of religion mainly as a sort of unpaid bailiff supernumerary for the protection and furtherance of the rights of agriculturists as a long- \u00a9 \u00a9 \u00a9 suffering body, and for the generally economical cultiva tion of the soil. ' I don't deny,' he said at last, ' I don't deny \u2014 indeed, I have but just allowed it \u2014 that your rural innocence is as much fictitious as the universality of our town vice, both mere suggestions of poetical propriety that fail on near examination. I don't deny that there is work here, and abundance of it, none the less exacting of one's highest efforts in that perhaps it has a character not so sensational and stimulating as that of diving into those abysms of dirt and degradation that all the world now talks of \u2014 those slums of our great cities about which so much is written, and in which so little is wrought. And yet for me this last is the only possible work, at which, no doubt, you wonder. But the ex planation is not difficult. It is in myself. If that world does not need me more than this, it is I need it.' ' What ! You'd rather spend your days in those stinking holes than get your lungs full of fresh air in a place like this ? That's odd taste with a vengeance !' ' It is not exactly my taste,' returned the other, ' it it rather the necessity of my nature that directs me."], [162, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 154 You, perhaps, will not understand, you whose dis position, no doubt, like my friend's here, is of a less fickle character than mine. But you cannot conceive how much to me is the mere force of surroundings, how they impress me, either for good or bad, for strength or weakness. Now away there, face to face with the grim ness and hideousness of poverty, its attendant sin and suffering becomes fixed upon my mind as an ever-present certainty, a claim upon my energies that keeps them screwed up to the pitch of battle, holding them constant even to the extent of forgetting what a strain I may be bearing till it all grows second nature. But here, on the other hand, all is different. The very aspect of the world about one assumes the absence of misery and sin, and smiles its innocence. With what result ? For me, at least, this, that I accept, do what I will, this kind deception, I become unstrung, I waver on the way to indolence, the sensual in my nature gathers strength, I cease to strive against it. Given time, I might become its slave. So I must fly.' He returned to his plate, and, finishing in a few hurried mouthfuls the remainder of the food before him, put down his knife and fork, and waited for an excuse to withdraw himself. Tom French eyed him closely, but with much mystification, and Simeon cast sceptical glances towards him from time to time in the intervals of eating. ' My friend, you see, is a man of sensibility,' he said at last, addressing Tom, ' for all a trifle imprudent in speech at times. But the one thing goes with the other. Luckily, he is so in speech only.' ' How do you know that, Simeon ?' said Mayland,"], [163, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 155 shaking his head gravely, with his eyes upon the table. ' I wish I could agree with you. I wish I could say that I had never been imprudent in action also. I have wished it many times. I shall go on wishing it.' ' In what way ?' Mayland flushed, and tapped his fingers on the cloth, but did not answer. Slowly then he rose, and, offering his hand to Tom, excused himself and left the room. Once more alone, the two young men looked long into each other's face. Then Simeon pushed away his plate, and, turning sideways in his chair, crossed his legs. ' Well,' he said, after a while, ' what do you make of it ?' ' Can't say, stepfather,' returned the other, his arms on the table. ' To say the least, it's queer. It seems to me you've dropped on a mare's nest.' ' How's that ?'

' Go on, go on,' said the other. ' No disrespect to the cloth, Simeon, but, to speak plain,' continued Tom, ' I know that Polly would sooner marry a molecatcher than go and mix herself up for life with the sort of maundering you fellows have to put on. I know it's all right, it's part of your trade, and candidly, my good friend, I own you're freer from it than most of your kind, else I could never have awayed with you ; but a chap like this, who can't say so simple a thing as that he likes town life better than country \u2014"], [164, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 156 and quite right of him if he does \u2014 without going into a long-winded perambulation of sentimental rubbish about Heaven knows what, when six words in plain English were all was needed, and all in a voice as thin as a week-old calf s, and with a face as long as a sturgeon's \u2014 that this is the sort of chap to cut me out with a girl like Polly Somers, I'm not going to believe yet awhile. No, no, I know her better than that.' ' Well,' said Simeon, ' I merely tell you what the boy says, and I don't see why he should go out of his way to lie to that length.' ' I don't know,' replied Tom. ' A young nipper who'll go opening letters in that fashion is up to a good deal.

But for all that, my boy, there's circumstantial evidence in favour of his statement. To begin with, you saw him coming away from there last night yourself.' ' Simply that,' said Tom, ' not with her. Calling, no doubt.' ' He never told me he had called there,' replied the other. ' Then, to follow on, she has sent you herself this morning a communication which you allow is very much of a smasher. How about that ? Why and wherefore ? On the face of it, we have found her reasons.' i ' I wish to goodness,' burst out Tom, ' you'd not played the fool with me all this time and kept things dark about you and mother !

I tell you it's only within the last fortnight that I have had the satisfaction of knowing your mother's feeling towards me \u2014 a consummation well preceded by your unfortunate rupture with Miss Somers, and which, appearing to be final, deprived your mother of the one way whereby she had dared to hope for your consent.' ' Idiots, the brace of you !' exclaimed Tom. ' You are no doubt right to say so, my dear boy,' replied Simeon ; ' but lovers, you see, Tom, lovers ; they are fools proverbially, so you must treat us charitably in the light of your own great wisdom.' ' Yes, and you say well there,' cried Tom ; ' I have played the fool to a fine pass myself.

Meanwhile, however, their brains were busy. Simeon Jebb had retired to rest the night before thoroughly disheartened, and his mood did not change by the next morning, as evidenced by the letter he then wrote to his affianced. May land's behaviour had left him in no doubt as to its cause. And yet it seemed, even as he wrote, inexplicable. For the very considera tions that weighed so strongly with Tom French in estimating the probabilities of Polly's attachment for"], [166, "158 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH one so very apparently unsuited to her weighed, as we have seen, no less with him. The whole affair seemed unnatural. And again, the secrecy of this courtship ! Even this fellow's possible dread of letting him, Simeon, know that the sudden reversal of his doctrine on the marriage question was a convenient prelude to the reversal of his practice also did not seem sufficient to account for it. But had he heard of Simeon's former pursuit of the same prize that he himself had now some hopes of winning? and did he fear not only his jealousy and opposition, but also a like reception at the hands of Polly's parents ? It was certainly not impossible that he had heard. Yes, and if he had, he might not a little feel for his less fortunate friend. Simeon would do him that justice. It was then that an altogether new and startling possibility occurred to him \u2014 that which, as the reader knows, was nothing less than the truth. Mayland would feel for him ; that, at the bottom of his heart, Simeon knew well. Then, was it not possible that he could feel for him to the extent of a complete self-sacrifice, and that therein was the secret of his last night's tone, it's frank and innocent expression, and its quite uncalled for eloquence to persuade him, Simeon, to his altered views ? At the mere suggestion, all the old tender traits of his friend's character which, till these latter days, he had acknowledged freely, surged back upon his mind, and held him for the moment. But soon again he cast all this aside as too far-fetched. It was only when his visitor came in on him some"], [167, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 159 half-hour before dinner-time, and, after congratulations, they had fallen to the serious discussion of affairs, that Tom's repeated hesitation to believe in the possibility of such a rival as Edgar Mayland, even before he had interviewed him closely, resuscitated in Simeon's mind this novel theory and made him pause. How, then, was it not proclaimed and verified by Mayland's words, those last preceding dinner, and more, with a most startling addition ! For what else could they mean but that the latter had discovered \u2014 by what means could not be guessed \u2014 that Polly's heart was still his friend's, in spite of all ? How else would he have dared to speak so ? He, Simeon, had shut him up peremptorily as the presence of their guest demanded ; but he had, none the less, drunk in each word, and all the while that poor May land had been trembling under his imagined anger, his silence had but bespoke the turmoil and delirium of his thoughts. Could it be possible that he had made such a colossal blunder? \u2014 that Polly had not, after all, given him an answer irrevocable, or, at least, had retained sufficient inclination for him for this other to so soon perceive it ? Could it be possible ? He cursed the presence of his guest, which postponed the hour of explanation ; he cursed it also for the unkind chance that had occasioned it, the now most premature and awkward revelations which that ill timed letter on the mantelpiece had brought about, and which would need intensest circumspection to escape; but, nevertheless, he braced himself to the attempt."], [168, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 160 One thing was indispensable : Tom French must still continue to believe in his new rival. But that was just the one thing the young farmer positively declined to do. And the more he gave vigorous expression to that refusal, the more it gained upon him with an absolute conviction ; and the more he felt resolved, under the new hope occasioned by the merciful deliverance which his friend Simeon had pre pared for him, to approach the object of his affections personally and promptly once again, and put an end to this ridiculous comedy which he felt sure she was only man\u0153uvring for his benefit. But, on his side also, one thing was indispensable : there must be no break or hitch whatever in the happy relations on which his mother and Simeon had embarked.

' Let me advise you to think twice of what you do, Mr. French,' said Simeon in a low tone, ' or you may, after all, be the bearer of false tidings.1 He then turned back into his room without another word. He was hot and flushed, but he felt that he had given the last blow. Soon his eyes fell on that unhappy letter where Tom, in his haste, had left it. He opened it and re-read it. Then he went for his inkstand, and wrote another in its place. ' My Dear Susan, ' All is up. That fellow I told you of has done for poor Tom. He's got her, for certain.

So, if he assails you on the subject, put him off for the present. Say, if you like, that you have some regard for me, but don't say all. It will give him time to digest it. It is the safer plan.

When Simeon had turned away after uttering that last threat of his, Tom French proceeded down the narrow staircase and along the passage to the open door with a distinctly weakened resolution. What could it mean, this conduct of his future step father, this evidently intense desire to suppress for the present, at any rate, in a certain quarter, the news of his engagement ? It was, on the face of it, so strange, so contrary to the spirit of that letter which he himself had written only that very morning. There seemed no explanation, unless it was that Jebb had suddenly become half-hearted in the whole matter, and contem plated a possible withdrawal. In that case, thought Tom, much shocked, it was all the more imperative to checkmate this treacherous desire, and that, promptly, to call the public conscience to his aid in holding this fellow to his bond. But what on earth could have brought about such a change ? That letter had been warm enough for any - thing. Some explanation must be sought. Was it possible that, after all, and under all his affected anger, Simeon had a secret sympathy and preference for his friend Mayland, and feared lest, in"], [174, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 166 approaching Polly again with news he knew would please her, he, Tom French, might once more win a place in her affections to his friend's hurt? There seemed some probability in this by the assurance with which he had persistently proclaimed his colleague's victory, and by his evident anxiety to prevent him doubting it. It was true that he had expressed in that intercepted letter much annoyance at the turn affairs had taken ; but that was for reasons which were now removed by the accidental discovery and glad accept ance of his secret by the man so long feared, after which his sympathy would, no doubt, revert to the friend he, in his heart, liked best \u2014 for Tom had never concealed from himself that Simeon had little love for him apart from the good things his board had provided him. But what bosh it all was ! what a waste of sympathy ! As if Polly for a moment could have been serious over this pitiful scarecrow ! As if the news he was about to carry her would not turn the scale as surely and as thoroughly as it would show the nature of the senti ment she indulged for this convenient victim of her pique, her jealous mood ! What rot ! Kissing indeed! He did not believe a word of it ! That young nipper wanted a sound hiding for his lies, for spinning such a tale from a few words no doubt dropped from the parental lips and caught without their context. He was too cle\\rer by half, that young man, and the sooner his education was cut short and he found himself pacing the furrow, the better for him and all else ! Education indeed ! Confounded humbug, Tom thought it, these fourth standards and fifth standards and the rest of it, whereby it was impossible to get"], [175, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 167 good boy-labour at any price, and one more was added to the already crushing burdens of the struggling farmer. For what on earth was the use of grammar and geography to a lad whose vernacular would mostly be put to swearing at a carthorse, and whose knowledge of the earth's surface would be most probably coter minous with the area of his own parish ? Sheer waste or worse ! As Tom strode on towards the smithy where he had left his horse, he gave expression to the force of his sentiments by cutting out with his whip-stock at nothing in particular, but with an inward aspiration that its long lash might some fine day be attached to it, and curling around the errant legs of a certain juvenile person as a final protest against the precocious erudition and its attendant evils of which that small figure was the most pestilent example. And so we see that the inspiration which had moved Georgie Merritt to seek his afternoon's occupation in another direction than that in which Mr. Thomas French was now pacing was a decidedly happy one. In fact, it had been fostered by the feeling of no small alarm which the appearance of the young farmer on his own premises had occasioned him, which, together with the angry word he had received from his father on passing, was sufficient to utterly interfere with the good digestion and enjoyment of his dinner, and had driven him to rise from the table prematurely and put space as speedily as possible betwixt himself and the wrath to come ; for he never doubted on what errand of further denunciation and chastisement his enemy had come."], [176, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 168 But the latter was now in the saddle once again, and was jogging slowly up the hill towards the church and the Church Farm house. But, as he proceeded, the determination to stop at the latter place and defy Simeon a trifle quailed, and he began to think twice before he took a step that might have serious conse quences. Gradually, however, a compromise grew visible \u2014 to publish the engagement of his mother, but at the same time to keep secret the name of her betrothed. That would answer his purpose with Polly, but would not affect Simeon. A good idea ! But again, as he approached the precincts of the farm, the courage to perform even this began to fail him, and he urged his cob to a quick walk, half purposing to pass it altogether. He was saved from this last fatality by an opportune encounter. A big stout figure leaned over the little wicket-gate that led into the stackyard, a figure topped with a broad red face and square-crowned hat, and dwindling away below to limbs closely corduroyed and gaitered to the heavy boots, all clearly visible through the open woodwork of the gate. ' Hello, there !' cried Mr. Somers, opening the latter and stepping out into the road ; ' where away ?' ' Home, it should be,' said Tom, pulling up \u2014 ' and quick, or the whole place will be gone to the dogs.' ' What ! with the missis at the back of you !' said Mr. Somers with a wry grin.

If not, I never know'd one.'"], [177, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 169 ' Business with variations,' said Tom ; ' at least, so it seems.' i Now, Mr. Somers, apart from the exaggerated curiosity in his neighbour's concerns peculiar to the countryman, had good reason to feel a special interest in anything that might casually be revealed as to the inner life at the Leasowes Farm. In this particular instance he suspected that young Tom and his mother had had a difference, and such news, in face of certain facts which weighed upon him, was not unwelcome. He eyed the young man closely, waiting for more. But more did not seem exactly inclined to come. Tom was silent. ' Var \u2014 i \u2014 ations !' said Mr. Somers, at last driven to speak ; ' and in what manner o' thing may they be then ?' ' Oh, I don't know. We all need a change,' replied Tom indifferently. ' Ay, ay,' said Mr. Somers in swelling wonderment ; ' and if it's not meddlin', in what way now might your mother be lookin' for such like ?' ' An altogether brand new way,' returned Tom, still gazing before him over his horse's head, ' coming out in a new character.' ' The deuce she is ! And perhaps I might venture to inquire what that might be.' 'Well, I don't know if it's for me to answer,' said Tom.' ' Gad, then ! I will for you !' said the other, approaching close and throwing his arm behind the saddle. ' Come, now, she's never going to get you a new guv'nor ?' he asked in a lower voice. \u00a9"], [178, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 170 ' Not for me,1 replied Tom, with a laugh ; ' for herself maybe. That depends on what comes after.' Mr. Somers raised his hand and brought the flat of it down with such a whack upon the animal's hind quarters as made that well-corned quadruped protest no little, and shake and twist his rider in the saddle for some time before he was brought up once again square to the wicket-gate. ' Solemn fact ?' demanded Mr. Somers. 'Solemn, if you like,1 said Tom, in whose secret judgment ' ridiculous ' was more the word. There was a time when he would have used a word ruder still \u2014 ' Yes, solemn enough.1 ' By Gad ! but you shall come in and tell the missus!1 exclaimed Mr. Somers, seizing the bridle. ' Yes, you shall ; I say you shall ! Here, Jim, here ! take Mr. French's horse. Yes, you shall ! Come, now, come J1 And before he could decide, Tom was half dragged from the saddle, and grasped and pushed by the short, but weighty farmer through the gate, across the yard, while his horse was led off by the lad, who had run up at his master's call, towards the stables. Mr. Somers was transported. Only that morning he had withstood in the best humour possible a long and querulous assault from his wife as to why he did not do his duty as a good father and sympathetic parent, and find out, either directly or indirectly, the true cause of Tom French's continued abstention from the Church Farm house, for which the reason that Polly herself had given seemed certainly not sufficient, and which a kindly word might perhaps readily remove \u2014 a word in season to that young man whom he had many more"], [179, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 171 opportunities of meeting or hearing about than she had, and which would be the easiest thing in the world, if he would only make an effort, and set about it. Only he wouldn't, and so everything must go on miser ably, to the ruin of their own child's happiness, and, consequently, their own, and that would be the end of it. Now, to poor Mr. Somers, sincerely doting as he did on his daughter, and anxious for her welfare, interference in the delicate region of her affections was a thing un thinkable, and a necessity he could not imagine himself facing except under the severest pressure. And thus he had felt all the while his wife was haranguing him o \u00a9 that her words were wasted, though he endeavoured with much kindliness to conceal from her this certainty. Besides, to add to his incapacity, there were also now the revelations of old George, which \u2014 though he was inclined shrewdly to appraise them at their true worth \u2014 were ever present to his memory, and paralyzed him yet further. But, none the less, the consciousness of his complete inaptitude to answer her objurgations was highly pain ful to him, and he had gone about through the whole of that morning with a degrading sense of cowardice and dereliction of duty clinging close upon him like an ill-made coat, which the unusual wretchedness of Polly's expression at dinner-time had not diminished. Indeed, he had then become conscience-stricken to an extent intolerable, till he could not sit and look at her any longer, but had risen at length abruptly from the table, and had wandered out, and so was just in time to drop on the very man who most occupied his thoughts, with"], [180, "172 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH startling news that gave the best hope of deliverance from his most sad dilemma. Tom French followed him across the yard with some uneasiness, though withal not unwillingly, glad to have the problem of his conduct taken from him in so masterful a manner. And how strange and almost hostile seemed that walk among the stacks and over the clean-swept flags to the old house now, which, but a few weeks earlier, had been as familiar as his own door step ! He was shocked to realize what an estrangement, not only with its inmates, but with its very bricks and mortar, this immediate past had bred. He found it difficult to believe that possibly that very afternoon his old relations with them were to be resumed. But he trod on calmly by the other's side with a face of unconcern, and entered the back-kitchen door \u2014 which was the way of exit and entrance invariably resorted to by the master of the house \u2014 with a smile and a nod for Bessie, who was scouring pails, and who immediately let one drop with a ringing clang on the red quarried floor at an apparition so unexpected and exciting. And as they paced the long ill-lighted passage leading from the kitchens to the parlour in front, the whole house seemed to more than one ear electrified with the loud clatter of four heavy boots, of which two had been listened for very much in vain of late. Mr. Somers, getting his portly figure past the spare one of his visitor, opened the door with a proud flourish, and Tom stepped in. And you may be sure his eyes skimmed that interior with a glance, though they were rewarded only with the person of the farmer's wife, seated sewing, as was her invariable custom after the"], [181, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 173 mid-day meal, in a very stiff and straight-backed chair, in defiance of her inevitable drowsiness at that hour. Mr. Somers, we have said, opened the door with a flourish, and, following his visitor into the room, gave his wife a look of self-confidence recovered, mingled with a mild reproof of her too hasty condemnation of his parental interest and capabilities. She rose and greeted the new-comer with much friendliness, and apologized for her daughter's absence quite naively \u2014 she believed she had gone across the fields ; should she send for her ? but, doubtless, she would be back again soon, and so on. But Tom, in the near prospect of a success which he felt to be confirmed by the welcome he was receiving from both of Polly's parents, and which he took as a sure sign of their acquaintance with their daughter's heart, found suddenly rising within him an unexpected purpose of which, before, in the hour of uncertainty, he had not dreamt, that of punishing her just a little for her past behaviour, particularly for that letter which, that very morning, had brought him such bitter disappointment. So, instead of flushing, as the good woman had expected, and showing in unmistakable ways his longing for the girl's quick return, he merely answered nonchalantly : ' Oh, please don't trouble. You see, I must be off' again soon myself. Mr. Somers would bring me in, or I really ought not to delay getting home.1 At this response, so cold and formal, the wife glanced at her husband a look of blank despair, and he returned her one of the same kind, but as if to say, ' I cant help it ; I've done my best ; I've brought him in \u2014 that's more than you have done.1"], [182, "174 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH And it was true. For the fact was that Mrs. Somers, in spite of the severity with which she had treated the passivity of her husband, was, equally with him, incapable of active, personal interference on her child's behalf. To her it had been quite as much owing as to him that what was practically an engagement between her daughter and Tom French had been allowed to proceed without any open, formal acknowledgment ; and so the way had been left easy for the rupture that followed \u2014 an event that had taken place in a manner equally as informal. And so, at this juncture, she did nothing but look at Mr. Somers, whilst he, on his part, did nothing after the first shock but endeavour to look innocently indifferent to the situation which Tom's tone suggested \u2014 though, in truth, it had not been less crushing to him than to her ; so much so, that it had knocked all his hilarity clean out of him, and even left him for the time oblivious of the tidings that had inspired him so much. An uncomfortable silence prevailed as the two men took their seats, and Mr. Somers, to relieve it, rang for refreshments \u2014 an unfailing accompaniment in his mind to any interview betwixt man and man. However, after a while, Tom \u2014 who, it must be confessed, had seen the effects of his words with a half-malignant satisfaction \u2014 broke the ice by asking for information as to the prospects and intentions of his fellow-agriculturist in the matter of the approaching harvest. And to this opening Mr. Somers answered gladly, welcoming any subject of conversation which obliterated, for the present, the delicate ground on which they stood. They soon got well into a broad discussion of the great"], [183, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 175 interminable labour question, during which, though both were agreed on general principles, the characters of the two men were each clearly shown : the elder easy, phlegmatic, inclined always to make the best of a bad job, and thank goodness it was no worse ; the other full of the martinet-like enthusiasm of youth for bring ing everything, willy nilly, into prompt and obliging compliance with its own desires. And all the while the good-wife sat silently stitching, wrestling with her wish to send someone to seek Polly and bring her in\u2014 which her own pride and the girl's told her she had better leave undone \u2014 and writhing under the stupidity of her mate, who seemed, for all the world, absolutely unconscious of the waste of the precious moments of a visit, perhaps the last that luck would bring. But the only action she allowed herself was to fill from time to time the young man's glass with sparkling perry on the table by his side, in the honest hope that as long as there was drink there would also be delay, and thereby Polly's natural and uncon cerned return be rendered possible. And at last her wish seemed on the point of being fulfilled ; her daughter's voice was heard by her keen ears kitchenwards, and Bessie must be telling her of their visitor with eager joy. Would she then come in? Mrs. Somers feared not. She was on the verge of finally yielding to her inclination and fetching the girl in herself, when the young man rose. Mr. Somers rose also. He knew his wife's desire, and that it was his duty to delay his guests departure by all means in his power, and that of this she was reminding him by winks and frowns that set the poor man in a burning heat, as"], [184, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 176 he knew his inability to respond thereto through sheer exhaustion of all possible topics of conversation. He turned upon her with a look of blank despair. But, at that moment, the door opened, and Polly entered. Her face was pale, and Tom, at a glance, saw the emotion which his presence caused, and hardened his heart accordingly. He shook her hand with cold formality and passed on towards the door. Mr. Somers braced himself to the occasion. ' Don't be in such a hurry to go off !' he cried ; ' we dont see you now too often.1 ' Have been up to my neck in work,1 said Tom, ' and shall be more than ever before long.1 ' Ah I1 exclaimed the other, recovering himself at this welcome allusion to an event which had been driven from his mind, ' ah ! when the happy little affair comes off, eh ?' ' Just so,1 said Tom, flushing. The young fellow felt more shy over his mother's amorous experiences than most do over their own. ' Well, I wish her luck and you !' said the other ; ' she'll make a good wife.' ' Glad you think so,' said Tom. Polly and her mother looked at each other ; it would have been hard to say which face was the whiter. The master of the Leasowes had found a wife elsewhere ! The girl turned away \u2014 her eyes were filling. The mother shot a look quite ferocious at her husband, who dared to grin with satisfaction over the ruin of his child's life ! ' And no one knows how to keep things shipshaper,' continued Mr. Somers."], [185, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 177 ' We've always thought so,' said Tom, with a laugh. ' But, at any rate, it means work for me.' He held out his hand to the other, who shook it heartily, and to his wife, who touched it and dropped it as though it had been the handle of an electric battery. To Polly's back he gave the slightest bow, and disappeared from the room. Mr. Somers panted after him to see him out. A minute later, when he returned to the room, his wife and daughter were standing in the middle of it ; the girl hysterically sobbing with her face hid in her mother's breast, the latter, erect, with scathing eyes and compressed lips, awaiting his arrival. He stopped dead in the doorway and gasped. For once in his comfortable life a scene of tragic emphasis was before him, on his own calm hearth. He dared move no nearer. ' Mr. Somers, for the first time I realize that you are a monster,' said his wife. That was hardly a sympathetic greeting. Indeed, to the ears of the poor man to whom it was addressed it seemed so shocking, so paralyzing, that he stepped back to the door, and would have crept from the room. But she, his better-half, sprang forward, leaving her child to fall sobbing on her knees alone, and, clutching him firmly by the arm, drew him in. ' You will not go !' she cried. ' You will stay here, and you will tell me, Mr. Somers, me, your wife, and her, your own daughter, Mr. Somers, who you won't lift your little finger to save from lifelong misery \u2014 you will tell us, Mr. Somers, what you mean by daring to go sniggling in our very faces while you're shaking and 12"], [186, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 178 shaking the hand of that cruel, that vicious \u2014 I haven't got words !' she gasped \u2014 ' who's broken the heart, he has, of my poor child \u2014 your child, Mr. Somers, though you don't act as if she was \u2014 and wishing him all this and that, when you ought to have been speaking your mind to him and kicking him out of this house, you ought ; that he's the brazenness to show his wicked head in, when, all the while, he isn't ashamed for you to know, Mr. Somers, or any of us, that he's going to marry \u2014 to marry an \u2014 an \u2014 another ! \u2014 she burst into tears \u2014 ' another !'

' I'm a woman, I am, and your wife, too ; and you'll please remember to at least attempt to be decent, Mr. Somers !' It was his turn now. ' Not marry her ? Why shouldn't he ? \u2014 if he can find someone to marry her to ?' ' What do you mean ?' ' Mean !' he cried, staggering back into his big arm chair with a loud laugh \u2014 ' mean ! Well, I leave that to you, my girl. Find out !' She went to his side and shook him by the shoulder, as far as his ponderosity permitted, at which he only laughed the heartier. Then, with a face in which immense relief was dawning, she turned round once again to where she had left her daughter on the floor. But the girl had slipped from the room."], [187, "CHAPTER XV. It was again late that evening when Edgar Mayland was returning from Longleigh, following the footpath by the riverside that passed from stile to stile through the short mown grass just thickening again towards an aftermath, and now already wet with the night-dew which cooled his feet as by chance he stepped to right or left of the bare track. From time to time, as he moved along through the gathering dusk, some silent, cowering creature would stir on either hand, alarmed by his sounding feet on the hard way \u2014 now a hare to her form in the coarse grass, or now a dew-drinking frog hopping still further from the danger of his unwitting feet. Or, perchance, a couple of brown moths, chasing each other in zigzag flight, would blunder \u2014 so absorbed in their own playful dalliance \u2014 into his very face, and force him instinctively to strike out with his hand to warn them of their want of care. But of all these Edgar Mayland only felt the presence ; he discerned them not. His mind, introspective always, wrestling habitually with the weaknesses and com plexities of self, was more resolutely than ever this evening turned within, whilst his eyes were bent upon his feet, which swung in nervous haste beneath him. 12\u20142"], [188, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 180 For on this day, which was now so nearly passed away, he recognised that a crisis of his life had been passed also, and, by Heaven's assistance, safely. And the dimen sions of the danger he had gone through grew to him now more and more clear as, in some distance, he saw it fall behind him, daring now to explore its depths for the first time. And the unmitigated hypocrisy and self-deception of these days came out before him now in all their naked shame. Now he remembered \u2014 as, indeed, he told him self he could have remembered any day had he so willed \u2014 the impressions of that first evening at the old farm-house \u2014 his nervous but unsuspicious entry into the room to which the good farmer had ushered him, almost unwilling, his first surprise and emotion at the girl's beauty and the freedom of her address, the efforts he had made to disregard them both, and to escape, only to find her by his side in the broad night, first playful and then grave, with all her expressions of sincere interest personally in him, which at the time he had pretended to disregard, and after to construe in his friend's behalf. All these memories, and more, came back upon him now with clearest accusation of the truth which, after all, he had honestly confessed the previous night, that ever since her image had been wrought upon his brain, her voice upon his ear, that all his advocacy of another's hope in these had been but a poor device to bring them once more to him self. And in this he had succeeded but too well, and now must suffer for it, and with shame. Yes, suffer. Suffer more keenly than in the optimism of that morning's victory he had thought possible. For"], [189, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 181 now this evening, as the full renunciation demanded of good faith grew more distinct, he realized what a marvellous grasp of his heart this girlish form had taken, how strangely, surreptitiously, he had been struck in the hour of relaxation from the stern ideals to which his life was vowed, how true what he had said that day at dinner, that the smiling bounty of the fields and woods could only serve to weaken his resolve, to wean him from the hard, high way that hitherto he had trod without a swerve, and now never with the same firm step, with the old accustomed confidence. From hence forth something had entered into his life which, how ever forcefully expunged, would leave its mark behind, a yearning perhaps never to be outlived, or, at least, a far keener sense of that renunciation than he had been awakened to before, an instinct of that other life that might have been his, his own, but for For what ? He ceased suddenly to move, standing with leg out stretched and eyes half closed. A shiver of doubt ran through him. For what ? Almost for the first time in his life an answer seemed to fail him ; for the first time he could not tell why he had never doubted that for him personally the stern claims of sacrifice, of joyless labour amongst joyless things till death relieved him, had always been as imperative an inheritance as were the qualities of his mind, the individualities of his frame and face. Truly, they were all this for someone, some must accept them, gladly, kindly, but why so surely he, who now saw to the full extent their"], [190, "182 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH But the next moment he had started on again, with strides swifter than before, and the shadow of doubt was swept ruthlessly aside. Certainly those claims were his. Did not the finger of God direct him to no other answer in this very experience that he had just passed through, in binding up with this one glimpse into the warm world of love this firm, inflexible denial, that by its bitterness should part him from the possibility of the like dreams for ever ? Was that not clear ? Yes, and he would be thankful for it. He walked briskly on, his lips firm, his eyes set blankly on the ground before him. Yes, he had made that clear by the firm, inflexible denial dictated by the faith of a true friend, whose heart had been laid bare before him \u2014 yes, laid bare. Yet, even as he said this last with repeated emphasis to leave no room for doubt, his mind began surprisingly to wander away in search of proofs of all those evidences in which this certainty had taken shape. And now, it was most strange, but for the first time those evidences, such as they were, appeared to him in a light, to say the least, not so convincing by any means as they had appeared before. A growing wonder seized him that, in face of the fact that he had never received one single word of plain confession of his sentiment from Simeon's lips, the possibility of a mistake had not more entered into his consideration. And besides, even if he had not misread a chapter in his friend's past, on what ground had he supposed so confidently that it was still an open one ? Indeed, was there not reason to suppose quite otherwise after his violent and really"], [191, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 183 unmannerly repudiation only that day, behaviour which had put him, Mayland, in a position of much embarrass ment before a stranger, not to speak of his personal feelings at being thus addressed ? Yet even as he asked all this, and his doubts \u2014 to which this mild resentment at his friend's rebuff gave no little impetus \u2014 grew stronger, a great dread of his own sincerity, a shudder of alarm lest here was rising in him but another commencement of temptation, passed over him, and brought him to that state of mental deadlock which he a second time expressed in action. Once more he stood stock still, and, leaning on his stick, took off his soft round hat, and bathed his temples in the cool evening air. And then he glanced around him, as if he expected some ministering form to approach and be his guide. Aoid sure enough it was so. A figure moved towards him through the gloom from the river-bank ; but not a form angelic, by no means, only that of a small boy, very much disordered as to his toilet, very muddy, and altogether giving signs of mental and bodily disorganization. ' What ! you here, Georgie, at this time ! You ought to be in bed.' Georgie returned no answer until he had shuffled up through the damp grass to where the other stood. Then, with eyes upon the ground, he mumbled some thing which the curate could not catch. ' What's that, Georgie ?' 'Want you to tell mother as I'm drowned,' came from between half-opened lips. ' You are drowned ! What do you mean ?' ' 'Cause I'm goin' to be,' returned Georgie."], [192, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 184 ' What are you talking about ?' ' 'Cause then she'll wish she 'adn't 'earkened to nothin' 'e's said ; 'er'll be sorry, 'er will.' ' And who is he, and what's it all about ?' ' It's \u2014 it's that there Mr. French, as come up \u2014 upon me unawarst,' began Georgie, but his words were finally lost in an excess of uncontrollable emotion. Tears ran briskly down his small white face ; his little body heaved and shook with convulsive sobs. Edgar Mayland was sore troubled. ' Poor little lad !' he said ; ' what is it ? What has he caught you at now ? Trying to make yourself ill again on his damsons ? Come, never mind, he'll forgive you that, I know.' ' No, no, it warn't that,' said Georgie, checking his tears, ' it warn't that at all, it warn't, not likely ; they're only green as yet, they is, an' 'ard,1 he went on, casting a look of scorn at the supreme ignorance of simple facts displayed by the other ; ' 'course it warn't that.1 ' What was it, then ?' demanded the curate, wincing a trifle at the blunder he had made. 'Its that there letter as did it,1 said Georgie, returning to his grief with rising sobs. ' Well ?' Mayland was determined to await further information, and not expose himself to another assault of scorn. ' Well ?'

' A-courtin1 \u2014 'er 'e's a-courtin,1 repeated Georgie, with much petulance at the thickness of intelligence displayed by the other. ' It wuz for 'er the letter wuz.1"], [193, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 185 Edgar Mayland drew a deep breath. ' Mr. Jebb gave you a letter to take to a lady ?' he began slowly, measuring his words. ' I telled you all that a'ready,' interrupted Georgie, with a puckered brow. ' Well, my dear boy, I wished you to say it again, because, you know, I was not aware ' But Georgie had turned away with a look of impatience and disgust at this long-winded interference with a plain statement, which was none too pleasant telling, and one to be got through as quick as possible. ' Well, tell me as you like, then,' exclaimed the curate, fairly snubbed. ' What happened ?' Thus appeased, Georgie turned again towards him. ' I wuz takin' it to 'er, an' it came open, an' I couldn't 'elp it, could I ?' he said ; ' it warn't my fault, an' when I tried to stick it down again it tore right up, it did.

' You think I don't mean it !' he cried fiercely, his tears all dry now and his face hot. ' Then you'll find yourself mistook, then, just a bit, you will !' And he moved away some paces. ' Come here,' said the other calmly. Georgie hesitated. ' Come here, I say.' Sullenly and slowly the boy obeyed. Mayland took him by the arm and led him on. ' Now look here, Georgie,' he said gravely, ' what's all this ? Is it you who are threatening to throw away your life, with all its potentialities for good? Is it you, George Merritt, born with so much intelligence and such ' But exhortations of this kind were little to Georgie's taste at any time, much less now. He made such efforts to break away that the other was forced to lay two hands upon him to retain him, being really fearful as to what the boy might do. ' Georgie, Georgie Merritt,' he cried, 'you must really listen to me. I am in earnest. This is not a trifling matter. I shall see you in your mother's hands at once.' At this there was another overwhelming burst of woe, mingled with bitter protestations against the"], [195, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 187 treachery of this threat, this abuse of generous confidence, which stifled all attempts at further explanation for some time, until at last, through sheer exhaustion, there came calm. ' Now listen to me, Georgie,' then said his captor. 'You are afraid to return because you think punish ment awaits you. Now, will you trust to me if I say I will do my best to save you from it ? Very likely Mr. Jebb has not spoken to your mother, and if I ask him to forgive you, he will not, I am sure, refuse. And if he has spoken, I will see your mother herself and get you pardoned. Do you hear? Very well then. Now come with me and tell me all about it.' He released the boy, who, thus assured, obeyed him as he moved on once more. 'Now tell me. It was a letter to the lady he is courting, did you not say ? And it came open ? Well, that was not your fault. It was not as if you had attempted to read it.' ' I couldn't much if I tried, it was that bad written,' said Georgie, losing his hold of the truth entirely. ' What ! you did try then ! That was a very serious offence. Well, well, now don't cry. You should not have attempted it. But, as luck had it, you could not, so there is that much to be thankful for. And I shall be able to tell Mr. Jebb so. And then Mr. French caught you trying to stick it together again and was rough on you ? Did he take it from you ?' ' Yes,' said Georgie with a smile at last returning to his face, ' 'e did, an' 'e read it, too, I'll bet a penny.

' What ! you don't mean to say he \u2014 he wants to marry her himself !' cried Mayland. At that Georgie burst out into a fit of laughter, uncontrollable, reeling and swinging himself about in the paroxysms of his mirth, and finally flinging himself down in the damp grass and rolling over and over until Mayland really began to fancy that the boy was not quite sane, and to wonder whether he ought not to carry him off bodily to the parental care without further parley. ' Get up, Georgie, get up ; you will give yourself a fearful cold if you lie there.' But the boy merely sat upon the ground, grinning from ear to ear. ' You said as per'aps 'e'd want to marry 'er 'isself,' he said. ' 'Why not ? why not ?' demanded the other, inclined to reason patiently with this juvenile eccentricity; ' why not, Georgie ?

He took off his hat again, and the two stood face to face in the narrow pathway for some time without speaking. Presently, in a tremulous voice, the curate said : ' Georgie, will you explain ?' ' Wot ?' ' Who the lady is to whom you refer \u2014 the lady with the \u2014 the chink.' ' 'Is mother, 'course ! \u2014 Mr. French's mother. That's Mr. French o' Leasowes.

Could this be true ! And in a moment flashed back on him the memory of that mid-day meal, the unex pected presence of the young farmer, his marked familiarity with Simeon, the latter^ rude repression of his own well-meant but most untimely banter \u2014 all these, were they not confirmations ? If so, then what an incredible blunder he had made ! what waste of strife and stress ! what conscience-stings uncalled for ! what reproach \u2014 almost ridiculous ! He could have laughed out loud. But he did not. For a flood of closer and exacter images followed on those incontinently. He saw him self again within the walls of the old church, already visible through the gathering gloom on the rising ground upon his left ; he saw beside him a bright face, turned full upon his own with beaming pleasure, in which no doubtful sentiment was half-coyly, half coquettishly, revealed ; he saw himself closing thereto his senses with a delirious dread lest in a moment of abandonment he should come to rank himself for ever among the faithless and forsworn ; he saw that face turn finally away from his with a look of keenly dis-"], [199, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 191 appointed hope and wounded pride, to which his own heart had responded with an equal pang that had demanded every power within him to suppress. And now it seemed that pang of his, that pain of hers, were felt for naught ; that instead, had he but known, he might have yielded sign for sign, have given glance of love for Might ! What was he saying ! he, the called, the set-apart, to whom the finger of God had ever shown the way of sacrifice, the narrow way, the hard and Ah ! but it seemed that now, for once, He had not shown it \u2014 had rather shown him the warm world, and held it very near, and with that vision bound up after all no, as he had thought, inflexible denial \u2014 no, none whatever ! And she must have loved him more, much more, than he had ever guessed. This boy knew it, therefore others ; no doubt young French himself, his rival, and Simeon too. Clear, then, was the latter's cynical dis trust, and the young farmer's bantering dislike, which, as he now remembered, had been expressed in every word he uttered. She loved him \u2014 had loved him even at first sight ! And so had he loved her ! A new vision of new days rose up before him. He saw himself, as now, returning in the cool summer evening through fields new-mown or ripening to the scythe \u2014 fields that to him were not as these, a passing presence, to be soon seen no more, and only vaguely remembered from the grim distance of dark streets and darker skies, but, on the contrary, familiar as one's own plot of garden-ground in all their detail of cultivation"], [200, "192 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH and possession ; familiar as the faces of old friends \u2014 returning with his face towards a little ivy-mantled home, nestling beneath its line of lofty elms that all but hid the gray church tower beyond, his own snug nest, though low and unpretentious, warm with wel coming love. And, drawing near, his feet move ever faster, the day's work well done, his wages there before him. And already he is passing through the little gate that gives on to the gravel path, bright bordered, leading to the door ; and already he is half way there, when it is opened wide, and a sweet face and form appear within the twilight of the rose-twined porch ; and in a moment they are his, that face pressed to his own, the blue eyes bluer in the evening shade, the hair as golden, to his fancy, as if the sunlight were not gone. And in they walk, they two, and whispering low; for something sleeps aloft in its small cot, to which they both ascend, and stand beside it together for some time, hand in hand, in silent pride. And he having touched the smooth forehead with his lips, with a look of infinite content, they creep downstairs once more to share with simple food the comfort of calm talk on all the hundred interests of the past day, until, with hope and joy for yet another, night and sleep comes in good time for them as well.

The latter looked up with inquiry. It was then that, with much dis satisfaction, he found himself pushed gently to the right.

The boy reluctantly obeyed. 13"], [202, "CHAPTER XVI. ' Father's indoors with mother,' said Polly ; ' let's go in and tell them.' ' No, wait a bit,' said Tom. ' Why ?' she asked. ' It's cold here.' She drew closer around her shoulders the gray shawl which was all she had against the cool evening air. He did not reply, but stood looking down upon her as he held her by the arm. ' Ah, I see !' she said. ' You still don't quite believe me? How I wish I could prove it !' She sighed. ' I wish you could, Polly,1 he replied. ' I almost wonder you came back here this evening,' she said in an injured tone. 'I know what it is; you think it's only when I heard about your mother that I came after you.

' I'm told differently, Polly,' he answered doggedly. ' By whom, I should like to know ?' ' By Mr. Jebb.' ' Wretch ! Just like him ! He's just the one to go saying that, because he's jealous.' ' Of what ?' She was silent. ' He has nothing to be jealous of, you know that. He is engaged to my mother and is very fond of her. To talk of jealousy is absurd.' ' Oh, of course it is, no doubt,' she answered hurriedly. ' Of course he must be very fond of her.' ' I've not the least doubt of it,' said Tom, ' and so, I don't see why he should go out of his way to tell lies.' ' What has he said ?' ' He says you have been meeting here again and again ; that he's been pretending to turn in to that church there merely for an excuse to hang about and come on you ; and that you've not disappointed him. You've been seen together often.' ' Nothing of the sort !' she exclaimed \u2014 'just once or twice by accident.

' All that's queer and old about it, you silly ! Of course, you're pretending, just to try me. Oh, Tom, it's too unkind !' Tears began to fill her eyes. He cursed himself for his suspicions. But he, who a few hours earlier in the day had laughed to scorn their present cause, now that he had her once more in possession, found them un expectedly assertive. 'Well, I dont know what Jebb meant, then,' he began painfully. ' I know,' she muttered. ' What ?' But she bit her lip and remained silent. She could not dare explain. It was impossible to let him know the story of Simeon's affections, which he had transferred so suddenly to another quarter. For she knew him too well not to foresee how certainly he would resent it, even to the marring of his own happiness and hers. ' What ?' he repeated. She sighed. ' I can't exactly tell you, Tom. I have suspicions. But I may be wrong. Still, a time will come when I will prove to you that I and Mr. \u2014 Mr. Whafs-his name were simply friends and nothing more. There'll be a time.' ' It seems it has come now, Polly,' replied he, looking"], [205, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 197 away towards the low meadows through the gathering dark ; ' for, if I'm not mistaken, your friend, as you call him, is now approaching ; quite accidentally, no doubt \u2014 coming just to see if the church hasn't run away, and say his prayers in the porch there, no doubt. Pity it's so overlooked though, from here \u2014 leads to interruptions.' She gave him a look of fear. Then her mouth set. 'You shall see,' she said, 'and judge for yourself. Stay here in the yard behind this wall. I will go over and meet him. You shall judge for yourself if we are lovers !' Now, there were three or four steps built solidly against either side of that low wall which divided the farm premises from the churchyard, for the convenience of the inmates of the former in going to Divine service and returning \u2014 also they were used daily as a mount into the saddle by the master of the house. Polly sprang up them, but, having passed the summit of the wall, she stopped short, and seated herself upon one of the first steps upon the other side. Tom drew back at the same time to where above the wall, which reached barely to his elbows, a thick lilac-bush screened him thoroughly from view. Some time they thus remained, but no footstep drew near. ' It was him ?' asked Tom in a whisper, regardless of the parts of speech. ' Yes ; but he's standing at the gate. Why doesn't he come on ?' They waited yet awhile. Then Tom broke out ' Confound him ! what's he up to ?' 'Still standing,' she answered low. 'Now he's"], [206, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 198 turning round. I believe he will go away without entering. How vexing !' ' Can't he see you ?' he asked, ' No, I am hidden yet by the trees till he comes further. Oh, why doesn't he come on !' Tom could see her face from the height where she sat, and, though the light was poor, he perceived the distress upon it, and a wave of shame passed over him. ' Enough of this, Polly,' he cried. ' Come back and let him be !' ' No, no,' she answered with determination, ' you shall see ! Go lower down the wall, there, and I will go to meet him. I'll bring him up to where you are, and you shall hear and see !' And she sprang down the steps, and, threading her way beneath the trees, moved quickly down the slope to where Mayland stood. But Tom refused to obey her by following down the wall, restrained partly by a healthy repugnance to the work of spying, partly by increasing contempt for his own conduct after the unquestioning reconciliation of that afternoon, when, leaving the old farmhouse behind him, he had turned and seen a small figure watching him from the wicket gate, and in a moment his horse was trotting briskly back again, and he had taken her without a word of explanation to his arms, and pressed her lips. And then, upon a footstep nearing, they had parted with a promise to meet again that night and \u2014 and now, what had come over him ? In self-disgust he turned away. But she, not knowing, had advanced to meet that other with a sure sense that her lover's eyes were on her, and a sure confidence that what they saw would give"], [207, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 199 them every satisfaction. How thankful she was now for the result of that morning's interview within those walls beside her, and which, she remembered with a shiver, might, for all she had herself then wished, have been so different ! What luck that she could approach this creature now with confidence in her reception ! She was soon rudely undeceived. Edgar Mayland had stood leaning against the gate in an attitude of hesitation ; but immediately on seeing her hurriedly approaching he drew himself erect, and, opening the gate, rushed forwards to meet her with a warmth that had but one interpretation. She stopped dead in the pathway, neither daring to go on, or turn and fly, and in a moment he was there before her, holding out both his hands. Dark as it was, she could see his eyes were full of a new light. ' I am come back,' he said ; ' and you expected me ?' Then, immediately, his hands dropped beside him. Her face had answered. ' Have I \u2014 am I then wrong ?' he stammered. ' I fail to understand you,' she replied. ' I thought \u2014 forgive me ' ' Thought ! You have no right to think !' she breathed in a low voice, hoping against hope that Tom would fail to hear, and mad with the certainty that he must have seen that first advance, the rapid step, the outstretched arms. ' You have no right to think ! You must be beside yourself!' ' Good God !' he muttered, and fell back. ' What did you mean ?' she hissed, stamping her foot. ' I did not know,' he answered piteously ; ' and you \u2014 you came to meet me.'"], [208, "200 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH She remembered then that by the haste of her approach she had given him some cause to think that he was welcome. What explanation of her conduct could she find ? One came, and none too soon ; for she saw that by her hesitation he showed signs of renewed hope ; he moved again forward just one step. ' Why,' she cried, but still in a half breath, ' why did I come ! Do you ask that ? Have you forgotten, forgotten everything \u2014 forgotten him, your friend, your dear, dear friend ?' He raised his hand to his forehead. ' Can it be ?' he cried. ' It seems so,' she answered, ' though I could not have believed it ; that I could not ! How can you look me in the face ? Go !' ' I was deceived,' he moaned ; ' forgive me.' But she was in an agony lest by his actions he should betray her still more, although she feared that this must be already hopelessly accomplished. ' Go, go !' she cried, ' don't speak another word ; I do not want to hear. Go back at once ! How could you be so false, so faithless \u2014 and to think me so too ! Oh, if I'd known, I never would have listened to you ! 'Twas wild of me to do it. Of course, I should have guessed. And now it's happened. A friend, indeed ! Go, I say, go at once !' She stamped her foot again. He raised his hat mechanically, and rapidly and silently he turned away. She stood and watched him pass through that small gate which, but a few minutes previously, he had thrust open in so very different a mood. She watched him pass away along the low meadow to the left with"], [209, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 201 feverish haste, and not a glance about him till he disappeared. And still she stood there motionless, stunned and shamed \u2014 so shamed, to her credit be it said, that for a moment she was near to running after him, and calling on him to stop. But now he was gone. With a shudder she turned away herself, and moved back through the trees towards that long, low wall, conscious of a crime which, after all, could not have saved her. On arriving there, this certainty was but too well confirmed. Tom was nowhere to be seen. The worst had come, then. He had left her, for once and all, in anger and disgust. With a beating heart she pushed along through the coarse docks and nettles that lined \u00a9 \u00a9 the foot of the wall to the before-mentioned steps, and, bounding up them, she saw with joy a form approach ing her. It was he, and he strolled on towards her with an air quite unconcerned. In a moment her arms were round his neck. He had not seen ! He still was hers ! But he noticed her excited mood. That roused his doubts anew. ' What ! he wouldn't come up ?' he asked. ' No, wasn't it vexatious !' she replied, showing, how ever, little vexation in her voice. ' Why didn't you make him ?' ' I couldn't.' ' Did you try ?' ' You ought to believe that,' she said, releasing her arms from his neck. ' If you had done what I told you, you would have seen for yourself.' ' Oh, I wasn't going to play spy,' he said. ' I went off the other way.'"], [210, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 202 ' Then you ought to trust me,' she said. He was silent for a while, though he put his arm around her. ' So I do,' he said presently, ' so I do, Polly. But what was it, then, made Jebb say that ?' ' Oh, I don't know,' she sighed wearily. ' Can't you explain ?' he said. She hesitated. ' Yes,' she said ; ' I told you.' ' Told me ? What ?' 'He's jealous.' ' Nonsense ! Jealous of what ?' ' Of you.' ' Of me ? What do you mean ? Polly, what do you mean ?' he repeated. She bit her lip. Then at last she said : ' I mean that he's wanted to marry me himself.' Tom stepped back. ' You tell me that, Polly ! Do you see what that means ? Either I must not believe you, or I must let my mother into your secret. And with what result ? You know.1 ' Why ?' she asked. ' Why must you ?' ' Can you ask that ? And I'm her son !' ' And what am I ?' cried Polly, flashing out into anger at last. ' Am I nothing that you should treat me so ? Have you not made me love you, and pretended you did me? And am I, then, nobody, whose happiness isn't to be thought about ? You her son ! And so are you my I don't know what you are !

And she turned away through the darkness, that had now completely gathered, and he knew that she was sobbing as she went."], [212, "CHAPTER XVII. That evening Simeon Jebb sat long over the tea-table. He was alone, as often happened at that repast, nor did he think it probable that his colleague would return in time to join him in it. But still he sat, hoping against hope that that familiar figure \u2014 which usually provoked in him a sentiment of not whole-hearted welcome \u2014 should appear, following a nervous step upon the stairs, at yonder door. A sincere greeting awaited it for once. For the whole character and colour of his life were again at issue, again open to a possibility he had thought was passed for ever into the limbo of dead dreams, and from his colleague's lips must come that night its last determination. And if \u2014 if But could it be ? Had she not rejected him without reserve ? Had he ever doubted that she had absolutely meant it ? and had he not already crushed the yearning to rebel within him with a large measure of success, till he had come to regard life with contentment on a lower plane of happiness, a plane of comfort and good things, the husband of a well-left widow, who adored him, and hung upon his every word and want ? Why, then, this new unrest? Why should that old intoxicating"], [213, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 205 hope be born again at a mere hint, a passing word \u2014 why ? Yet so it was \u2014 a mere hint, a passing word : ' I believe there is in store for him a young wife and a pretty one.' And yet, how could the speaker have allowed himself to utter such a statement unless He sprang to his feet and paced the room, then fell again into his chair, swaying his body in the agitation of his thoughts. Mayland had said it, and he must have meant it. And as he sat there, with his face aglow, confirmations flooded his memory anew, and he saw how clearly lukewarm had been the attachment between Polly and the young farmer, an attachment that had been ruptured at the first slight friction, an attachment which perhaps never would have taken place but for the stupidity which had restrained him, Simeon, from repeating his first unfortunate assault upon the girl's heart. And he recalled now the evident confusion of her face and manner always exhibited whenever by chance he had encountered her upon the road \u2014 an expression of feeling quite unnecessary had she been heart-whole to him ; and he blamed himself vastly now for the obstinate blindness with which he had refused to give this notice. What could it be that had possessed him ? At any rate, his heart was beating now, his blood flowing as it had never done since that wild morning so many months ago, when he had walked up to the Church Farm house, to get an answer so very different from his dearest expectation that, foolishly, under the sudden shock, he had accepted it as final. He could not sit for long ; he rose and paced again ;"], [214, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 206 he looked at his watch ; he turned to the window, and gazed at the yellowing light beyond the trees ; and then once more he fell into his big armchair and set himself to think. And an amusing vision rose before him of that idealist, that saintly friend of his, that scorner of the flesh, coming down slowly from his pedestal before that selfsame object that he, Simeon \u2014 having no such height to fall from \u2014 had honestly and plainly worshipped, only to find himself too late, and under the necessity of clambering up again with weak and tardy congratula tions to the friend whose straighter way had won the prize before him \u2014 all this rose up before him ever clearer, till at last with swelling spirits he burst into a laugh, and clapped his hand upon his knee. How droll it was \u2014 how irresistibly, gloriously droll ! He could almost be fond of the fellow for providing such a comedy. At any rate, when he came in he would grasp him by the hand, and wring it till he winced again. But would he ever come ? He had gone, of course, to Longleigh, though it was not his day for visiting that place. Otherwise, he would certainly have turned up by now ; for, going only among the poor as was his custom, he was never delayed by offers of hospitality. It was peculiarly vexatious, such irregularity just this evening of all others, when a word from his lips was to be a pronouncement of his, Simeon's, fate, whether his future life was to include love as well as ease \u2014 a great enrichment, and one that made the alternative seem poor indeed. Now, the reader may think it strange that, having recovered such strong hope, Simeon Jebb should have"], [215, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 207 determined to await its confirmation from his colleague's mouth rather than put an end to all uncertainty by an immediate interview with the girl herself, in whose sentiments he felt now such confidence. But, if so, the reader does not fully appreciate the Rev. Simeon Jebb. He could love and seek love passionately, but he could be prudent also. In fact, prudence was the one permanent part of his nature through all the fluctuations of the hour and mood. Now, though life with easy means and love thrown in was as superior to life with the former less the latter as a good dinner in Mrs. French's luxurious parlour was superior to the same in Mrs. Merritt's bare and ugly apartment at thirteen shillings a week, still, for all that, he knew well that to have neither was a condition of things as always possible as it was horrible to con template. And he clearly saw that this last misfortune might be in store for him if, after all, he should have fallen on a misconception, and should be denounced by the indignant girl to the son of the woman who was ready to bestow on him the former and most lasting of those indispensables to happiness above recorded. So he preferred to wait, and know absolutely before he moved. But waiting is very wearing, especially when a great issue hangs on the awaited. So Simeon, having risen and sat himself down again, as we have said, many times, and allowed his impatience to bring to his lips now and then a word not exactly Scriptural, at length rose with a final determination, and placing his broad black soft hat upon his head, went from the room, and, descending into the road, turned off to the left with the intention of following the"], [216, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 208 track by the riverside by which Mayland should be then returning. But he had scarce gone in that direction fifty yards, when a servant from the Rectory came running up behind him with a message from her master wishing his presence that evening on pressing affairs. Simeon knew well what that meant \u2014 accounts, as usual ! accounts, of all things ! and three or four hours over them, unravelling the blunders into which the rector's figures were found always to have fallen ; accounts which he, nevertheless, would persist in under taking, thus giving more trouble in the end to others than if he had left them to perform this duty from the beginning ! And just this evening of all others, when a man's blood was running warmer in his veins, his pulse throbbing with a delighted expectation, to sit down to worry over pence, and pick the tangled skein of another's making for the fiftieth time, with the pleasant certainty that it would soon be once again in the same delirious disorder ! Was not this enough to draw strong words from anyone less patient than the patriarch of old ? Indeed, to Simeon's lips such observations came, and nearly passed. But there was no escape. With a blunt acknowledgment, he traced slowly back his steps, stop ping at his own quarters on the way to put his toilet a trifle more in order. He was greeted on the doorstep by his landlady with a distressful face. ' Oh, please, sir,' she said, ' I was lookin' out for you, when I 'eard you go by. An' I just wanted to ask you, sir, if you'd be so kind, if you do come across that lad"], [217, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 209 o' mine anywheres about loiterin' \u2014 if you'd be so kind as to send 'im in, sir, sharp.

Simeon started. For the first time in the stress of that afternoon's excitement he remembered Georgie, and that the story of his misconduct had never been carried to his mother's ears. Acutely he realized that this absence of the boy was most probably due to that possibility. For a moment it was on the tip of his tongue to offer his explanations ; but immediately an honest reluctance in his own rising fortunes to assist in the depression of another's smote him, and he held his peace. He gave a short nod of assent to the poor woman's prayer. ' I will do so,' he said, and hurried to his room. Soon he was tapping at the Rectory door with an exterior smartened and much brushed. It was quite dark before he left \u2014 escaping with all the feeling of a boy on break-up day and hurried down the dark road homewards with limbs that were not swift enough. He was moving towards his fate with certainty. May land must have returned by now. As he approached the row of houses of which we have said that Mrs. Merritt's was one of the foremost, he glanced up at the window of their joint sitting-room to greet the lamplight which should tell of this event. He was surprised to find it wanting. The window was quite dark ! But possibly his friend, fatigued and solitary, had retired early to rest in his own chamber at the back. 14"], [218, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 210 Very well, then ; asleep or not, it would go hard if he were not waked to tell his tale. Simeon marched swiftly to the door and knocked. It was opened instantly by his landlady. She was pale and tearful. Old George, her husband, was at the parlour-door behind her. ' Oh, sir, you've come !' she gasped ; ' we are in such a fright, sir ! Georgie's never come 'ome yet, an' Mr. May land's gone !' Simeon staggered back, then entered hastily. She looked out into the night ere she closed the door. ' Georgie ! Mayland ! What's this ?' he demanded.

And yet \u2014 I am thankful that your absence forces me to write it ; for what it would be to me to face your frank and honest eyes with such a tale \u2014 to see the shock which such a revelation of treachery and baseness must bring to one so steadfast and so true, so free from guile as you are, is more than you can ever dream of. For will you ever believe it, that I who have posed before you as a man of lofty calling, as one who accepted the claims of our pro fession in their most exacting sense, as one to whom the pleasures of this world were naught, not even in the category of temptations as things to be lived over and lived down, but rather as unrelated to the very nature of my soul ; that I, all the while so posing \u2014 prating, canting, I ought to say \u2014 was secretly, hypo critically, without resistance, surrendering to that strongest of them all, to that passion, in itself of"], [222, "214 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH noblest importance and the most divine, but in my case monstrous and impure, seeing that it was for one whom I well knew, by all the laws of God and His well-found affinities, was for another, and that other none but he who had listened nightly with a tender patience to my lying tongue ? ' And yet it is all true \u2014 true as the golden truth you have so often stopped me with, that the kingdom of heaven is often nearest those who make no showy claim to its inheritance. Yes, Simeon, it is true. And yet, even now, as I write, I know that in its first beginning I meant it not. Yes, I can say that. But, alas ! how soon I fell ! Let me tell all. ' In the first place, I had guessed before our friend ship had continued long that you had a trouble of the heart \u2014 and now I look back on the past, I do hope that some of my false talk against love and marriage was stimulated by a sincere desire to find you consola tions in the life of sacrifice and its rewards. But your proud and quite justifiable reserve denied me all knowledge of the circumstances of your suffering until that other night when, as you remember, I came from my first visit to the Church Farm and spoke of its inmates, and of that one. I then saw, dullard as I am, the truth. And oh, my friend, will you believe it ? that I had only one thought that night, and that was how I might render you assistance. And I resolved to do so if I could. But I knew not my frailty. I was carried away by self-conceit. I went about to meet with her, not openly, but furtively, under the pretence that I could thereby best work your cause, but really, as I see now, to satisfy my own selfish yearning without awaken-"], [223, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 215 ing your suspicions, or, indeed, my own. And I was fortunate beyond my hopes \u2014 how, I know not, unless, as I believe now fully, she sought for me herself in order to speak and hear of you. And I essayed to do so, but failed, and went away \u2014 Simeon, forgive me \u2014 thinking not of you, but her. ' And so it has come to this, that in heart not alone have I betrayed you, but in deed also, yes, in deed also, and this very day. But I swear to God that lies were told me, Simeon, strange lies and purposeless, incomprehensible, save that they came from a mouth I should have known better than to trust. And you, too, did you not help to weaken me ? Witness your wilfulness only to-day at dinner when I endeavoured publicly to place you as a barrier upon the slope I knew myself inclining. ' But how or why, the fact remains, and I have done it. I have attempted, Simeon, to rob you of your life, to step between you and your love, to steal your fate and fasten it to mine, and leave you, poor old man ! to fashion for yourself another and a sadder, and to wonder if all friends will be so false as you have found this first. Oh, Simeon, I did attempt it, but, thank God ! I failed. I go, and carry with me the lightning indignation of her eyes till death. I cannot stay another hour. I must be off and bury its remembrance and my shame in earnest work among those haunts of toil, beside those beds of pain, in the centre of that sordid, stressful life I never should have left, no, not even for a space, for I am not to be trusted. For me it is the collar and the rein, or else I go astray, I leave the track. How blest are you, and such as you, who know self-guidance, and"], [224, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 216 can love good, in calmest confidence always to perform it ! Simeon, remember that, and bless yourself for your great gifts, and pity me, and let this help you to forgive me. And, thank God ! you can do this the more readily since all my sin has failed, since I can tell you with a sureness now of brass or adamant that her heart is yours, yours wholly, to be asked for when you will. Oh, go at once, my friend, and take it up, this pearl thrown at your feet ! Leave it no longer. Had you done so earlier, this shame had been kept from me, my life would have been free of this dark blot that hence forth will disfigure it. And more, by doing so you will afford me just the one redeeming point of my deceit, to know that it has served to straighten the approach to such great bliss, of which your over-sensibility was upon the point of depriving you for ever. Do, Simeon, my friend, do go at once, before it is too late, before some other evil influence intervenes, and give me this one consolation for my cruel shame, for you can do it now with so much ease, such safe success. ' And then, when you write me of that blest result, when the letter which every morning I shall look for, in the good old hand, arrives at last, and I tear it open and read the news of my redemption in the fulfilment that I did my best to hinder, then, and not till then, will this great weight of sin be lifted from me, and I shall be able, as before, to go about my work without a conscience rankling with the ruin of another's life.

I feel very thankful to know that he will be glad to be rid of me. That makes this easier. Good-bye again. You see now what I ask, little as I may deserve it, Simeon, forgiveness and good news, ' Yours always for life, ' Edgar T. Mayland.' Simeon Jebb put down that letter, and his fist went with a thump upon the table. Then greedily he snatched it up again, and once more went through it from the first word to the last, dwelling on every phrase, and rubbing his hand across his eyes as though he scarce could trust them. But no, they did not fail him ; the word he had so eagerly awaited had been given, and not an hour too soon \u2014 even now, perhaps, too late. Even now she who had loved him all along, if only he had known it, might be listening to the story of his success in quite another quarter, and be casting. him in anger and disgust from her thoughts for ever. For it was fairly certain that Tom French, in spite of the strong threat with which he had been dismissed that afternoon, would not long consent to keep her ignorant of the removal of the one obstacle \u2014 as he"], [226, "218 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH thought, foolish fellow! \u2014 to her reconciliation with himself. Oh, why had he not known all this before ! But he knew now. And his old luck, and to-morrow, were before him. His thoughts were rudely interrupted by a consider able fracas without \u2014 the voice of old George Merritt spluttering disjointed epithets of wrath, his wife's voice pleading and assuaging, and through them both, with clattering feet upon the staircase, hysteric sobs bursting from the small breast of that infant criminal, their son and heir. Master Georgie had returned, then, and had met with the reception he had had every reason to expect from the .sense of misdemeanour and the quality of mercy peculiar to his male or female parent. But, though the treatment of the former was serious, and but feebly modified by the intercession of the latter, consisting, to say the least, of several smart clouts upon the head, which made Georgie for the moment feel as though the whole miserable world were tumbling about \u00a9 \u00a9 his ears, he did not conceal from himself \u2014 when he had gained the safe shelter of his own little chamber un pursued, his glad surprise that his punishment had gone no further, and more, that the reproaches with which it had been accompanied had dwelt only on the delinquency of staying out, and in no wise on the misadventure of the morning, the fear of the con sequences of which had been the sole cause of that nights behaviour. And he spent the moments em ployed in hurrying supperless to bed in much wonder, mingled with keen aspersion of the now unquestionable folly which had led him to make so sure that the visit"], [227, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 219 of Mr. Thomas French had been anent his further castigation ; a certainty so strong, that it had driven him, after the failure to encounter his false and fickle comforter on his way down from the church, as he had promised, to remain still longer out, gathering with night such fear to face the storm that, till the yet greater dread of cold and dark and bedlessness had grown sufficiently intense, he could not overcome it. But now all was well, and, hungry as he was, his bed was warm, and sleep soon came to put an end to other pangs. And Mrs. Merritt put her head in at the door, and informed Simeon of that with which his ears already had acquainted him, the happy issue of that evening's fears. His face was radiant. 'Not drowned, then, eh?' She laughed. 'Good night ! good-night !' he cried, shuffling across to his own room. ' Not drowned !' he muttered, as he closed the door ; ' there's a chance, then, yet, for the gallows tree !'"], [228, "CHAPTER XVIII. Mr. Somers' aster-dinner nap had lasted a little longer than usual. It was a slack time on the farm, that between hay -harvest and the ripening of the corn ; and he could afford then to take life easily, and let the sultry part of the day pass by in the restful gloom of the old farm parlour, which was the one place on earth that was the epitome of comfort to his comfortable soul. Comfort ! Yes. The cool and roomy leather covered old arm-chair, the good square table at his side, which he could thump with his full fist without fear of shaking its well-founded firmness and the various flower vases thereupon, always kept freshly filled by Polly's hand \u2014 not to speak of others containing something more directly serviceable to the life of man \u2014 his wife's mild face at its far end, for ever following her stitching fingers, with her work-box open wide before her in which from time to time she searched with a familiar sound, the cool half-light of the small high window framed smaller still by the encroaching green or bronze of the great Virginia creeper on the wall outside \u2014 all this, together with the consciousness that times, if bad, might yet be worse, and that a sufficient balance was in"], [229, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 221 his banker's books beneath his name \u2014 all this was to him, John Somers, as it might well have been to others like him \u2014 the finest expression of that word ' comfort ' so dear to the heart of every Englishman. Peace and comfort ! And of the former as of the latter he had enjoyed his share. His life domestic had been singularly blessed. Indeed, never until now had serious friction with his wife, the ground-swell of the storms into which their daughter's life had so suddenly been plunged, arisen to disturb its even way. And as such, it was felt all the more painfully by both of them, and by him especially. And though, in his cheerful optimism, he did not doubt that this unfortunate invasion of unrest would sooner or later be repelled and all be peace again, he shrank none the less keenly from the contest, and the expectation that at any moment his wife would commence again upon the awkward topic inspired him this afternoon to simulate a longer sleep than in reality he had enjoyed, by keeping closed his eyes till the customary hour should arrive for rousing himself once more, and taking another turn about his fields before tea-time. But he was not to be so let off. 'John,' said his wife, with that firmness of tone assumed by one who will be trifled with no longer. He blinked his eyes and half opened them, but moved not his head one inch from its comfortable pose. ' John,' she repeated still more firmly. There was no alternative. He turned his face towards her. ' About Polly,' she began ; ' we must think what to do.' ' Oh, things'll come round,' he said ; ' leave 'em alone a bit.'"], [230, "222 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH ' I cant bear to hear you talk like that,' she said ; ' you v ex me beyond measure.' ' Why, what on earth have I done ?' he asked stupidly. ' That's exactly it, John ; you've done nothing.' Mr. Somers had been told that a good many times lately, and to little purpose, so far as he could see. He now sat up straight in his chair and stretched his short legs. ' I'd like it best,' he answered, ' if you'd tell me, Mary, what I am to do.' ' Anything better than nothing,' she replied. ' Well, didn't I bring him in yesterday ? What about that ?' ' Oh, yes, you brought him in, but you did nothing else. You never a bit brought him to book about it all. You talked of everything imaginable but the one thing that ought to be in the mind of a father with an only child \u2014 her life's happiness.' 'Nor did you, Mary, as far as I could see. And what was there to talk about ? He came in to tell us of his mother's little doin's.' ' And you didn't even get to the truth of that \u2014 who she's marrying !' ' He wouldn't tell ; I told you that. So what's the good of talking ?' 'John, it's every good. Things have got to be talked ; they've got to be settled ; they've gone too far.' ' What has ? She's settled ; so I take it.' 'I'm not talking about that creature,' she replied with rising irritation ; ' you know that. I'm talkinf of Polly. What's to be done for her ?'"], [231, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 223 ' Blest if I know !' he muttered. He was really fond of his child \u2014 doted on her, in fact \u2014 but he could not persuade himself that her future was in a sufficiently precarious condition to deserve the trouble that was being made about it. ' You ought to have spoken long ago,1 she said. ' Why me ?' he asked mildly. ' If you had, he never could have behaved like this,' she went on. ' But I'll know why, I will, John, if you wont. He shant treat my child like this !' ' Why, but its Polly's own doin1 quite as much as his,1 said he. ' John, you know it's not ! You saw her yesterday sobbing in my arms and him walking away just as if nothing had ever been between them \u2014 and, what's more, when the very thing they made out had parted them was took away. No, it's all nonsense ; it\"-* not been that all the while, and this shows it. There's something else, and I'll know it !' Now, Mr. Somers, as we have said, had by no means forgotten the communication which old George Merritt had made him that afternoon on his return from the Rectory. At the time, he had done his best to dis regard it and persuade himself that Polly had only been taking a little diversion in this troubled interval of her true attachment to Tom French. But now, under the more serious aspect in which his wife had shown the matter, his conscience smote him, and he wished strongly he had handed on to her his informa tion on the spot. It worked within him whether he should do so now ; but his natural inclination to hush up awkward questions, hoping they would adjust them-"], [232, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 224 selves, together with some dread of his wife's anger at his having kept his news to himself so long, at length conquered, and he held his peace. ' The poor child's making herself quite ill, you can see that for yourself,' she said. 'Look at her this morning! You wont have your Polly long to talk about if things go on like this \u2014 she'll be dead.1 'Nonsense!1 he mumbled; 'things1!! come all right if you'll just let 'em be.' ' Ay, ay,' she sighed, ' so you always talk.' There was a breakdown of the conversation at this point, and Mr. Somers hoped to close his eyes again in peace for a few minutes. But again he was destined to disappointment. There was a knock at the front door \u2014 an occurrence which ever sent a shock of alarm to the inmates of that household, being the signal of the arrival of some formal visitor, a rara avis as good luck would have it \u2014 at least, so thought Mr. Somers. He pulled himself up in his chair, his wife bustled into the workbox her effects scattered round her ; he appealed to her with a mute look demanding explanation as to who might now be breaking in upon their peace ; she merely, in response, looked ignorance and nervous expectation. Mr. Somers then made his stock remark on such occasions : ' I can't think why, Mary, you don't use that there front drawin'-room for visitors and folks.' For he knew that the caller, whoever . he or she might be, was about to be ushered by Bessie into that very room, and before he had even time to take shelter in flight, heavy mover as he was, or to scarce collect his wits. But Mrs. Somers always answered with a silent head-"], [233, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 225 shake ; and as he never pursued the subject except in such moments of alarm, the drawing-room of the Church Farm house remained always in its inhospitable condition of chilly and silent conservation, close shuttered and chintz-covered, year in, year out. And so the next moment the dreaded troubler of his peace entered in the shape of Mrs. Susan French. She was attired in the usual black bonnet and mantle of her widowhood, but now, to the quick eyes of Mrs. Somers was evident at the first glance an unusual relief of ribbon of a salmon pink which went but poorly with her ruddy face. Mrs. French was no great favourite of hers, and, especially since her existence had clashed with her child's happiness her feeling of repugnance to her more managing and independent neighbour had grown greater still. But Mr. Somers always expressed it as his opinion that she was ' a woman of parts, and a fortune to any man who could get hold of her.' So on this matter they agreed to differ. She entered with a bustling friendliness, and was greeted by the two with every sign of welcome, and with a quite unwonted flutter, seeing that she was most probably come to confirm the news of the new departure in life she was about to take. But when they were all three seated, the husband and wife both smirking with expectation of the tale about to be unfolded, the visitor, flushed and hot, without any sign of being conscious of their curiosity commenced a rambling exposition of the various and sundry reasons for the long interval since last she came to see them, among which were to be reckoned princi- 15"], [234, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 226 pally the increasing cares of household, every year more difficult owing to the increasing untrustworthiness and thorough good-for-nothingness of the female sex in that part of the country in which it was her melancholy fate to have found herself located, and from which she was eager to depart, bag and baggage, but for her boy Tom who wouldn't \u2014 and whom she could never desert so Ions as he wanted her, as he did now \u2014 selling every acre of land they owned between them, to start afresh in some more favoured quarter of the land of Britain, where girls and working-folk generally were to be found who had a love of honest labour for its own sake, and not for every penny they could squeeze out of you, with all sorts of plunder into the bargain. At all of which Mr. and Mrs. Somers simply stared. They had heard all this before, many times, and knew how much it meant \u2014 how little Mrs. Susan French had ever meant to lose her hold upon that comfortable homestead which, as a model to the whole countryside, was greatly her oavu creation. But this time, however, they had awaited something different. They had expected a statement, sincere and bona fide, of her proximate uprooting from the spot she had so long presided over, but not from sheer weariness with an unreformable world of working-folk, but, on the contrary, by the unexpected impulse of an altogether new activity, and one it had always been supposed she had abjured for ever. And so they glanced at one another, each with the same look of surprise. ' Just like her !' thought Mrs. Somers with indignation. ' To the last moment she'll keep it dark rather than let us know. She cant bear the thought of Polly"], [235, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 227 being in her shoes. She must have gone in head over ears, or she'd never do it. However, she doesn't know he's let it all out, though, silly creature !' But, with a fine suppression of her inner feelings, she said : ' Ah, yes, he has found you of use to him ; he'll miss you if you ever leave him, Mrs. French, that he will. And perhaps that day's not far off ; who knows ?' ' Goodness ! I'm not going to die yet, Mrs. Somers. Lord ! don't put me on too far !' exclaimed the widow. ' Oh, dear no ! I didn't mean that ! I meant some thing much pleasanter than dying,' returned Mrs. Somers with a knowing smile ; ' there's other ways of leaving a house than in a coffin.' Mrs. French regarded her with some suspicion. Had, then, some inkling of her secret got abroad \u2014 and to these people, of all others, the last she wished to know of it ? \u2014 before even her son dreamt of it ! He would be hurt ! For Tom French, on leaving Polly the previous night, had gone home in a troubled mood. He was placed between two alternatives, that of disbelieving her in her statements as to Simeon's past attentions, or that of accepting it ; in which case the suspicion, only too obvious, that Jebb was merely wooing his mother for her money was painfully confirmed. And, seeing that he leaned strongly in his own mind to this latter, the whole subject had filled him with no little nausea and repugnance, and he had consequently left his parent entirely in the dark as to his discovery of her relations with the curate. He had even, in his suppressed disgust, gone out of his way to drop observations more than ever assuring her of his io-norance, which had now driven her to take desperate 15-2"], [236, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 228 steps towards removing the obstacle to his easy enlightenment, which had so disastrously cropped up. To this, Simeon's letter of that morning had stimulated her the more. She was there for that purpose. And now it seemed that others might do the work she dreaded. A stop must be put to that at once ! ' I am sure I dont know what other way you may mean, Mrs. Somers,1 she said, in a tone of cold offence. ' Oh, I meant nothing,1 returned the other with a laugh. ' Leavin1 it with the bailiffs in, like Joe Westrel at the Hope,1 put in Mr. Somers with a loud guffaw. His wife gave him a glance of irritation. It was just like him to go turning the matter aside with a joke when she had been doing her best to bring it to a head. \u00a9 \u00a9 ' Nonsense, John I1 she said. ' As if Mrs. French could be likely to come to that I1 But that his wife could take seriously his suggestion was so absurd that he burst into a still louder roar, and would not be suppressed.

The flatteries her"], [237, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 229 husband always paid to the widow seemed to her absurdly excessive. She did not by any means see so much to admire in a woman who, after all, had come into a good thing, and had but just kept it going. Besides, she always suspected that Mr. Somers had a secret respect for something more than the mere business abilities of their neighbour. In an unguarded moment he had once let slip that he considered her a very good specimen of fat, fair, and fifty, with some emphasis discernible on the middle attribute. So Mrs. Somers did not laugh. But that was no hindrance to the other two. ' Oh, Mr. Somers !' said the widow, shaking her head at him, 'you do always think so much of us. It's no use trying to undeceive you ; you will have your way. But there ! men are always flatterers. Don't you find 'em so, Mrs. Somers ?' she asked. ' Well, it isn't always complimentary to be told you've known how to feather your own nest,' replied that lady dryly ; ' at least, there's two ways of looking at it.' ' You think so ?' said the other, in a tone of genuine, ironical surprise. ' How so, Mary, how so ?' said Mr. Somers, coming to the rescue of their visitor, whom he could see his wife was inclined to handle roughly. 'I should think it very complimentary.' ' Oh, if you think so, all right, John,' she replied. ' But I've always believed in live and let live.' 'So do I, girl, so do I,1 cried her husband, in the biggest voice at his command. ' A good heifer to my mind is one as'll feed fast ; but thats no reason for her"], [238, "230 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH to put her horns into every other poor beast as comes near her. She aint got time for that, neither.1 ' Silly John I1 exclaimed his wife ; ' as if there was any sort of comparisons betwixt us and dumb creatures in that fashion I1 Mr. Somers was silent. In his verbal contests with his wife he ever had an uncomfortable feeling that she would turn out in the right. There was too much common-sense about her. But the visitor came to his rescue. ' I am sorry, very sorry, Mrs. Somers, that you should feel like that,1 she said. ' I'd always thought you put as much store in good management as most folks ; but seems I\"m wrong. It's quite interestin', I\"m sure, to find what mistakes one can make. Dear me ! best, is it, to go about with your eyes shut ? Ah, well, that accounts for it, then !' ' Accounts for what ?' asked the other lady shortly. ' Oh, for just that I came to see you about this after noon, something as concerns you a little nearly \u2014 at least, so I thought ; though, perhaps, as you say, it's best to let things slip.' ' No, no, I never said so,' returned the other. ' No, no,' cried her husband ; ' you've mistook.' ' Oh, I'm glad of it,' smiled the widow ; ' I'm very glad indeed you say so. How strange I should have thought you meant it ! Well, then, my time and pains won't be wasted. Tom's gone into town, so I just took the opportunity to let him drop me here ; and he'll pick me up on his way home, if you can put up with my company for an hour or two.' ' Gladly ! welcome !' cried both her hearers. ' You'll"], [239, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 231 stay to tea, of course you will,' continued Mrs. Somers ; ' and now you'll tell us what it is, this that concerns us. Nothing bad ?' ' Well, bad's a strong word,' replied the other ; ' and that depends just how you care to take it. I know how I should.' ' Dear me !' exclaimed Mrs. Somers. She felt quite nervous. She glanced at her husband. He mopped his forehead and blew his nose and coughed, and did his best by all manner of noise to retard the critical moment of disclosure of what, he felt sure, was some unpleasantness, all the while quite unconscious of the wincing impatience of his wife. ' Well ?' repeated the latter. ' I thought long what I should do,' commenced the \u00a9 \u00a9 ? visitor, with an expression of great and conscientious judgment ; ' I've not acted rash, Mrs. Somers \u2014 at least, I hope you'll not think so \u2014 in interferin'. If I thought I had, I'd leave this house this very minute, though I walked all the way back home, I would.' ' No, no, of course not,' said the wife. ' There are things as nobody's got any call to meddle in except the parties themselves ; and perhaps you'll say this is one of them, though there I and you'll dis agree. I'm a mother, Mrs. Somers.' ' So am I,' replied that lady. 'I know you are; and that's what brings me here. Where is she?' she went on, looking sharply round. 'Not in the room? That's a good job; then I can speak up.

Then, remembering his visitor : ' Not but what I was glad when you came, ma'am,' he said ; ' that woke me uP; ' What a nuisance !' broke from his wife. ' Inter rupting ! John, who can it be ?' That question was answered on the instant by the approach of a firm foot, and, the door opening, by the entry of the Rev. Simeon Jebb, curate of the parish. He was attired in broadcloth of his best, a well starched collar circled the vigorous fulness of his neck, his locks were brushed and oiled to perfection, his broad cheeks shaved with quite unusual care. He was in his best and bravest, and he entered as if he knew it. But a change came over the spirit of the man as he perceived the company to which he had introduced himself. A certain, not to say failure of the limbs, but a perceptible hesitation was manifest in the midst of his advance ; his head betrayed him ; he blundered palpably. Instead of greeting first his hostess, he moved in the direction of her visitor, and shook her hand in the most awkward imaginable haste, then tumbled past her clumsily, and did the same, in the same manner, with the other two. All four were quite unbalanced ; not a word was spoken. Such a diversity of sentiment as they were"], [241, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 233 suffering produced an impasse from which no immediate delivery seemed possible. It was left to Mr. Somers himself to solve it. He did what he was accustomed to do on the arrival of a male visitor of his own class \u2014 he rang the bell. ' Why do you ring ?' mercilessly demanded his better half. ' Why, for drink, of course,' he said \u2014 ' must do some thing.' Then, turning to Simeon, who still stood in much discomfiture : ' Take a seat and welcome,' said he ; ' it's such a time since you was here.' ' Welcome, is he ?' said Mrs. Somers to herself. ' So now, he's coming on again, with John abetting him !' Mr. Somers was well awrare of his wife's sentiments ; indeed, he knew they ought to be his own ; for he re membered keenly the painful amount of cold-shoulder ing he had had formerly to apply, under her instructions, to this very personage in order to discourage visits, which happily at last had been put an end to altogether by Polly's own action. He knew all about this ; but, for the life of him, he could not utterly decline to welcome anyone who crossed his threshold, even though they were the sheriff's officers themselves. ' And how are things with you ?' he asked. ' You're lookin' well.' Simeon had dropped into a chair. He was slowly recovering his self-possession, and blessing his stars that by his manner he had effectually suppressed any sign of familiarity on the part of the lady opposite, whose presence was as unexpected as it was disconcerting. He drew his chair towards the farmer with an expression of perfect innocence, and answered :"], [242, "234 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH ' Thank you very much, Mr. Somers ; I am in my usual condition, which is not altogether bad. But I am glad to see you so well. I believe you beat me, after all, in every way.' ' Nonsense !' returned the farmer, with a laugh ; ' me, who's old enough to be your father ! What do you say to that, Mrs. French ? Is it likely as we can stand up beside these young uns, eh ?' The lady winced. ' I didn't quite catch what you were saying, Mr. Somers,' she replied. ' Were you calling yourself old ? Come, that's too bad. You forget you are saying the same for Mrs. Somers ; for I've always been told you were both the same age when you were married \u2014 twenty five each.' ' And the same for you, too,' said Mrs. Somers, with a sardonic sniggle. ' Ay, ay, we're all in the same boat,' cried her husband, who by no means was so dull as not to perceive the widow's attempt to slip out of the net, and not to relish his wife's mild interposition \u2014 ' ay, ay, one and all of us, we shall soon be old uns and be leaving the field for these folk !' And he slapped his hand on Simeon's knee. ' Ah ! if we were his age,' he continued, ' I'll bet things ud look different, eh, ma'am ? Gad, if they wouldn't !' ' Ah !' she answered, beaming, though it was easy to see how little she enjoyed his words, 'no doubt you look back on your young days and think a lot of what they were. But that's a good deal, isn't it ? because they are a long way off, and you've forgotten. People are so apt to, when they get on in life. Now, I can remember my experiences of girlhood naturally much better, and"], [243, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 235 I can assure you that I find life when one is forty more easy and interesting in every way than when I was twenty, that I do.' The farmer and his wife glanced at each other. He winked one eye. Such an assurance of his ungullibility gave her much comfort and no little courage to resume the offensive. If this woman had been candid enough to inform them of her new departure, she, Mrs. Somers, might have found it her kindly duty to smile at her attempts, however ridiculous, to discount the number of her years ; but, as it was, since she had preferred to grudge them the satisfaction that such news would probably bring them, she had deprived herself of any such grace, and must take the consequence. She leant towards her, and with a forced smile said gently : ' Didn't you \u2014 make a \u2014 a little mistake ?' ' Indeed ! \u2014 -what ?' snapped guiltily the widow. ' Oh, nothing of any importance \u2014 only- ' Only what ?' ' I thought you said \u2014 but perhaps I was mistaken \u2014 but you meant, did you not, fist ' ' I think I meant exactly what I said, Mrs. Somers. Is there anything \u2014 is there \u2014 a ' ' Mary, why doesn't that girl come in ?' cried the farmer, alarmed at the length to which his wife was going, and ringing again vigorously the bell. ' Ah ! here she is. Bessie, what's come to you ? Bring in some cider sharp ! Gadding about or gossiping again, that's it ! Ay, you may well look hot !' It was true that Bessie's face was flushed. She had been busy since Simeon's arrival hunting up her young mistress to inform her of the unusual gathering, and"], [244, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 236 had only found her after much trouble in the arbour at the bottom of the garden. For she had a notion that that young lady's affairs were moving in an acute direction, and that every eventuality was in some relation to them. At least, the presence of two such visitors could not be wholly uninteresting. She hurried down to the cool cellar, key in hand, anxious to return and see if Polly had obeyed her summons. ' Ha, ha ! what does it matter, eh, Mr. Jebb ?' went on the farmer, continuing an awkward subject with his usual vialadresse in social difficulties, ' what does it matter, this old or that old, so long as you're happy, eh?' ' Quite so,' said Simeon. ' 'Course I know, as the sayin' is, old folk and young folk won't go on together. Well, who wants 'em to ?' ' Quite so,' said Simeon again. ' None but fools,' said the farmer. ' Let 'em keep apart, that's best. Why, come now, a young man like you, for instance, is it likely you'd care to spend much o' your time with old folk like we ? Not a bit of it. Taint natural. Very good of you to come in,' he went on, floundering deeper, oblivious of his wife's warning eyes, ' very good indeed ; much obliged to you, and hope you'll come again, but there, it ain't likely as you don't care a lot more for company o' your own age more. There's twenty year twixt we as'll ne'er come back again, eh, Mrs. French, eh, missis?' Receiving nothing but frigid looks and silence from both those ladies, he turned once more with some dis comfiture towards the curate, and essayed to explain himself."], [245, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 237 ' It ain't, of course, as I mean there can't be pleasant company twixt old and young in a sociable sort of way like; what I mean is, they cant throw in their lot together, that's what I mean \u2014 none o' your old men marryin' young women, for instance, or vicey verser.1 ' Quite so,1 repeated Simeon, but he kept his eyes upon the ground. ' Of course not. Ah, here's Polly ! That's right, my lass. Here's the age for you, fresh as a daisy,1 and he drew her on to his knee, after she had shaken hands with the two visitors, and pinched her cheek with his own fat thumb and finger. She slapped his hand playfully, and pulled herself away from him, and sought a chair on the far side of the room. No manner of doubt was in Pollys mind that the two were come together to announce their new relationship, and as she sat down she looked expectantly to her parents to repeat for her benefit the statement they had most probably just been listen ing to. The very tightness of the clasp of Simeon's hand as he greeted her was indication that he had recovered his one time familiarity in the light of his new position as her probable and prospective father in-law. She was therefore no little surprised when it seemed that no such statement was forthcoming, but, instead, an awkward silence held possession of all parties. She glanced from one to the other of them. Her father alone seemed at all at ease, and regarded her with his usual satisfaction. Simeon's eyes caught hers in a side glance. The other two did not even turn their heads in her direction. ' Been down to the village, my dear ?' at length asked"], [246, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 238 her father. ' You look hot. Shouldn't walk so much i' the sun, my love.' ' Great waste of time,' said Mrs. French. ' \"What ?' said Polly. ' Walking, my dear, when you can ride ; and a farmer's wife hasn't got any time to waste, let me tell you that.' ' Haven't walked a mile on the straight since I was his age,' said Mr. Somers, pointing to Simeon. ' But we aren't all farmers' wives,' said Polly, with a laugh, ' nor perhaps going to be.' ' No, indeed,' said Simeon, with glowing approval. ' Hey, dey !' exclaimed the widow, with wide-open eyes. ' Polly !' ejaculated her mother, in mild reproof. 'Now, a clergyman's wife is nowhere if she can't walk,' said Simeon. ' I didn't know I said I couldn't walk,' replied the widow. ' I meant to say \u2014 and I thought you would understand \u2014 that, having a horse, I prefer to use him, and, having my hands full, I think it's best not to take an hour over what you can do in ten minutes. Things perhaps'll be different some day, when you'll find me as good a stepper as the best of 'em.' She met his look straight in the face, like one at bay. She was becoming decidedly bold and reckless. The discussion on ages to which she had but just been subjected had strained her patience to the breaking point. ' Ay, ay,' said Mr. Somers easily. ' Why, I should have walked here,' she continued, determined to vindicate her future as a parson's spouse"], [247, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 239 according to Simeon's postulate, ' but for my son Tom offering to drop me down and call for me on his way back ' (here Polly could not quite conceal her interest). ' You know I'm a good walker. Why, haven't I ' But she stopped short, seeing a sharp contraction of the brow of her betrothed. ' I thought we were referring to Miss Somers,' he said dryly. She regarded him distressfully. ' Quite so,' she said. ' I was only giving her a little advice, but, it seems, it was uncalled for.' ' No, no,' said Mrs. Somers. 'Thank you very much for saying so,' replied the other. ' At least there is one person understands me, and knows that if I speak I speak from experience. Mrs. Somers, I'm sorry your daughter seems to know her own mind so little as to pretend now she's going to turn her back on the ways she's been brought up to.' ' She's only up to her fun, missis ; she dont mean it,' said her father. ' I hope she doesn't,' said the widow. ' But perhaps I do mean it,' reasserted Polly. ' Goodness me !' exclaimed the widow. ' Why not ?' asked the girl. ' Polly, my dear,' said her mother, ' you are not thinking what you are saying, or before whom either. You know you don't mean it. Mrs. French, you must not listen to her.' ' I dont much care if she does or not,' said Polly, under her breath. Since the catastrophe of the previous night she had been in no amenable mood, and this interference with"], [248, "240 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH what was a question of sacred privacy, and bound up with so much bitterness \u2014 and that, too, by the very person who had been its chief cause \u2014 was past en durance. ' Well, Miss Somers,' exclaimed the widow, quick of ear, and now boiling with indignation, ' so that's your feeling, is it ? It's well I know it !' ' Polly, how dare you !' cried her mother. ' Let her be, let her be !' put in her father. ' I will let her be !' said the widow, rising. ' You say right, Mr. Somers ; I'll interfere no further with her. I won't speak another word about her \u2014 she's not worth it !' ' Oh, please don't go- \u2014 do sit down again !' pleaded Mrs. Somers. ' She's sorry now ; I can see she is \u2014 she's crying. There now, there !' For tears were visible in Polly's large blue eyes. She also had risen to her feet. But now Simeon, who had heard with delight and glowing satisfaction her refusal to become a farmer's wife, well knowing, as he thought, the meaning of her resolution, now he also bestirred himself under the influence of the strong emotion her tears engendered ; he too rose from his seat and glowered upon the widow, who was, however, far too much overcome by her own feelings to take notice of his sudden attitude. ' Mrs. Somers,' she said, ' its very kind of you to speak so, and I know you mean it for the best, but, none the less, you're wrong \u2014 you're quite wrong ; and, though she is your own daughter, I must say it : she's been deceiving you, and she's deceived my poor boy too, and near broke his heart. I say it to her face !' But there the good lady was mistaken, for the girl had"], [249, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 241 vanished from the room. ' It is true, every word of what I say,1 continued the widow, addressing Mr. Somers and his wife in turn, and still apparently forgetful of Simeon's presence ; ' and I think it my place to tell you, for I know neither of you has the least notion of what's been going on, or you'd have put a stop to it, that I'm certain of, as certain as I'm standing here.1 ' Which is a very unwise proceeding, and one quite unnecessary, with a chair behind you,' said a big voice beside her. She started. 'Altogether so,1 continued Simeon, 'and to go out of your way in this manner to meddle with what I hope you will allow me to describe as not your business. My dear madam, you will excuse this bluntness, but I must repeat, not your business. I see you wonder why I should say so, seeing, as you have indicated, the feelings of your own son are involved in this affair, and you consider yourself his guardian, as a mother should be. And guardian un- doubtedly you are of much of him \u2014 of nearly all of him \u2014 of his goings in and coinings out, of his eating, his sleeping, his shirts and shoes, and all and sundry of the small but manifold requirements of his daily life.

' Of his heart, in the delicate direction of his soul, its intimate attractions and repulsions, its moods im- measurable and mysterious, subject to influences unseen and undivined \u2014 in these you have no part ; your care is not so much as called for, and, given without, I fear is not even kind ; and so to the point. If your son and Miss Somers have failed to find themselves possessed of souls congenial \u2014 as, I take it, at one time you have 16"], [250, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 242 been led to hope might be the case \u2014 there is nothing for you but to accept this discovery in all good faith, being quite certain they would have found otherwise if by any means they could have done so, and as a matter entirely beyond your interference, only permitting your self the little liberty of thanking Providence that the discovery was made in time ; for your son's happiness, I see well, is very dear to you. But no more, if you would use discretion. More means misery on all sides. Take my advice.1 He finished. Mute and bewildered, she fell back into her chair, and gazed up at him. Mrs. Somers, too, regarded him with a look of mystification, mingled with suspicion ; but neither spoke. It was only the good host who seemed to have listened with complete understanding and approval. ' Gad I1 he exclaimed ; ' and you're right, sir, every bit you are ! It's what I've been telling the missis this month past. \" Meddlin' means mischief,\" said I, and I'm darned glad to hear you bear me out ; but, Lord ! what a world o' trouble one has to convince a woman !' His wife regarded him with an eye of scorn. ' And a world more there'll be yet,' said she. Now, the presence of even one hardened unbeliever destroys the perfect unction of the preacher's soul. Simeon felt it, and found it better to retire. With mechanical courtesy he shook hands all round, offering some slight excuse all three were glad of, and, declining vigorously to let the farmer follow him, saw himself out. They were alone again, those three. ' Good riddance !' exclaimed Mrs. Somers."], [251, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 243 ' Why say so ?' returned her husband. ' Sure enough he spoke sense.' ' Rubbish, John ! Just to hear his own voice ! What business of his to interfere I should like to know ! Mrs. French, you'll explain now, wont you ?' ' I think I'd better not,1 said that lady, in a thoroughly crushed and humbled tone of voice. ' I think I wont. They must go their own ways. It's not for me.1 ' Ay, ay,1 said Mr. Somers, ' I agree with you, ma'am, and the parson. It aint for we to interfere.' ' Not when your own child has been deceiving you ? Well, John, how you can talk like that !' ' She's not deceived me,1 he said recklessly ; ' I've known it all along.1 ' Known what ?' ' What she's come to tell. It's old George Merritt you had it from, eh, ma'am ?' The widow shook her head sadly. ' It's him, I know, the blatin1 old rascal !' he con tinued. 'Promised me he wouldn't, solemn, that he did!' ' John, what is it ? If you two don't speak soon, you'll drive me lunatic !' ' It aint nothing,1 he said, with final emphasis. 'Mrs. French1 \u2014 she turned in despair towards the widow \u2014 ' are you going to treat me like this, too ?' ' My dear Mrs. Somers,' replied that lady, ' you have heard the words which have been addressed me ?' ' What of them ?' ' In which your husband joins, as you see, from begin ning to end ?' 16\u20142"], [252, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 244 ' What of him ?' ' Ah ! but you mustn't say that,1 replied Mrs. French, with tender disapproval ; ' we must obey them who are our masters, as we've sworn to.1 ' Well, you havent got a master \u2014 not yet, at any rate,1 said the other keenly. The widow sighed. ' \" Pastors and masters \" \u2014 isnt that it ?' she said ' Bosh !' exclaimed Mrs. Somers, whose impatience at last got the better of her politeness. Her husband coughed and blew his nose. ' Well, my dear Mrs. Somers, if you are so pressing,1 said the widow, resigning herself to the force of circum stances, ' I suppose I must give way. And I hope your husband will forgive me ; he sees how Fm placed. And I'm sure, for all Mr. Jebb said \u2014 with which I agree every word in principle \u2014 there are exceptions ; and if he'd waited, I could have made him see them. My son and your daughter, Mrs. Somers, are congenial \u2014 that's the word, wasn't it ? \u2014 it's all nonsense to say they aren't. They're made for each other, as bacon is for beans \u2014 a blind man can see that.' Mrs. French was well aware that, according to that dictum, she must have been formerly more than blind herself, having opposed with every insinuation possible the alliance now so much desired. She felt fairly safe, however, in the ignorance of her past sentiments on the part of her hearers. She was much surprised, therefore, at the look of suspicion and astonishment that came into the eyes of one of them. She hastened to remove it. ' Of course they're made for each other \u2014 everybody knows it as knows them, and none more than me and"], [253, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 245 you, Mrs. Somers ; and if I'd had my way, they'd have been married now and safe. Then this other would never have come between 'em.' ' What other ?' ' Just as I guessed ! You've known naught about it ! And your husband he makes light of it !' ' John !' exclaimed Mrs. Somers, with smiting emphasis, ' if all this while that I've been wearing myself thin and ill over wondering what's caused this trouble, and trying to listen to your pretence as it would all come right, if all the while you've known yourself ' But Mr. Somers rose in his wrath. ' Gabble ! mere gabble !' he exclaimed, shuffling to the door. ' An' it's her who's the cause ot all !' he added, pointing to the widow; 'you've said as much yourself !' ' Mr. Somers !' cried that lady. ' You've said it yourself, Mary, an' you know it, as it was her was in the way ; and they've quarrelled over it, an' there's an end !' And he looked his wife in the face as he left the room. He took down his hat from the peg in the passage, where for twenty years it had been his wont to hang it, and, making his way through the kitchen into the broad yard, where innumerable poultry of all kinds were nestling and scuffling in the sun, he moved heavily away across it in no particular direction, having only a deter mination to get clear of female tongues for at least that afternoon, and recover from this rare disturbance of his equanimity. But it was not so easy a matter. For the sense that"], [254, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 246 his wife's anger was not a little justified \u2014 that the supineness with which he had received the information old George Merritt had given him had merited this unusual visitation and placed him roundly in the wrong \u2014 would not be quieted, and stung him with a burning desire, secret and unconfessed, but none the less over mastering, to find some way of restoring, both in her eyes and his own, his paternal reputation. But his heart sank as he felt and knew that courage to interfere directly between his daughter and this young man was wholly wanting to him. And, for the life of him, he couldn't altogether see why this fellow might not be as suitable for Polly as any other \u2014 only his wife wouldn't hear of it. A pleasant young man enough. And if he was rather out of another world, so to speak, and hadn't perhaps much in the way of worldly goods, he'd got good manners and a livelihood ; and he, her father, would always see she did not want. But there ! what was the good of arguing ? And, after all, Polly herself was clearly only humbugging with the poor chap, and running great risk thereby of losing the man she did want ! No, there must be an end to it. But how to accomplish that result was not so easy. Then, in a flash of thought, the rector's desire, so forcibly expressed, that he would seize an early occasion to give the new curate an open snub in the matter of that church-door, recurred to him, and also the good use to which he had perceived he might apply a prompt obedience to it, in effectually offending this strenuous and doubtless sensitive young man, and so putting an end to any possible intimacy between them \u2014 certainly"], [255, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 247 giving him a hint that as a son-in-law he was not wanted. A good idea ! Why had he not sought an oppor tunity before to put it into execution ? There was the church, and there the door, and yet not once in these past days had he examined it. Better late than never. He moved towards that long low wall already fre quently referred to, and peered to left and right among the trees. A few moments later he had struggled over it by means of those same few steps which Polly had so nimbly scaled the previous evening, and was making determinedly for that familiar little porch. And the door within was ajar ! He stepped in briskly, though as softly as his weight allowed him, and, firmly, closing it, he removed the key from the outside keyhole where it stood. He moved back with some pecipitation, and was soon again on his own premises. There he called to him a small lad, sheepishly escaping from this apparition of the master from an unexpected quarter. ' Here, Dick, take this to the Rectory, and say it's with my compliments,' he said ; ' and be quick about it !' And he put the key into the boy's hand. Then he went on towards the house, with a blessed feeling of relief in that, at last, he had performed the duty of a father and a man."], [256, "CHAPTER XIX. Polly had fled from the room and from the house. But those tears still in her eyes as she regained the little arbour were less of anger than vexation. Oh, why had she behaved so ? What had come over her ? The woman had meant well towards her ; and Tom, it was clear that he had not as yet accepted her defiance of last night \u2014 as yet had kept her secret to himself, had finally refused to credit it, or, still, still better, had placed her happiness, as she had claimed of him, before all else. He had loved her first and best, in spite of all ! And how had she repaid him ? By insulting the mother he had every right to love \u2014 should have tried herself to love ! Her tears now were tears of shame ; she did not check them. Yes, he had not abandoned her ; he would return, perhaps that very day, and laugh at the dilemma of last night, and tell her it was nought for him. It was a probability that gradually, but slowly, dried her tears. A time came when she rose once more to her feet, and took a turn in the bright sun, in order to free her face from the last traces they had left around those eyes now bright."], [257, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 249 Her first impulse, then, was to go back to that room, and there, before them all, apologize. But as she neared the house again for that, her courage failed her. Instead, she turned irresolutely aside across the court yard in the direction of the church. It was then, as if to atone for her cowardice in one direction, the thought of an apology due elsewhere occurred to her. To that poor young man whom so unnecessarily she had ill-treated over there the previous evening surely some word of explanation or regret was due. And he should have it \u2014 if, by chance, against his custom, he should be within the church at that hour of the afternoon. She crossed the wall and hurried to the porch. And so it was. She pushed back the half-open door, and entered, and the next moment two great arms were round her ! She freed herself with a scream. Simeon Jebb stood between her and the door. He kept his eyes firmly fixed on hers the while he closed it. Then he stretched out his hand towards her. ' Polly,' he said, ' this won't do ; we've played at this long enough.' ' I fail to understand you,' she replied. He stood silent. ' Good heavens ! You say that ?' he exclaimed at length. ' Certainly !' ' Polly !' 'Mr. Jebb!1 ' There is some mistake, then ?' ' I am not aware of any.1"], [258, "250 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH ' But I say there is !' he insisted, in a louder tone. ' I am sorry to hear it; He regarded her silently for some seconds. Then his big face began to twitch, his broad mouth to pucker. ' I thought you \u2014 you loved me !' he broke out. ' Mercy ! what can you mean ? What can you mean, when you \u2014 when you yourself ?' ' What ?' he gasped. ' Are promised to an ' But he had rushed upon her and seized her one hand by the wrist.

How could I ? You know well Avhat she is. No, no ; it was an act of blank despair \u2014 because I thought \u2014 for a time I thought you meant it, that you did not care for me ; and so I flung myself away \u2014 yes, flung myself away upon a creature that I ' ' Dont say it ! don't ! don't !' she cried.

' Don't be too upset,' she said, reapproaching him ; ' perhaps ' But he moved away from her and again took up the same position further up the aisle. A shiver seemed to pass across his frame. She was much shocked \u2014 and shamed. For was not here another creature suffering at her hands ? Yes, it was all her fault. But who would have thought that jealousy alone would not have been sufficient to have prevented that other from ? Ah, she should have remembered the sort of man he was ! She sighed as she thought of all the evil and distress that she had brought about. ' Mr. Jebb,' she said wretchedly, ' it is all my fault. Can you forgive me ? Do speak ! It will be dreadful for me if you don't !' But her distress, had she known it, might have been a little less sincere. Simeon had received once more a severe blow \u2014 and suffered from it. But, for all that, his was a nature far too practical to collapse beneath it \u2014 not to remember that a worse fate yet might follow. The life with love and ease combined was not, then, to be his. What if, after the words he had just spoken, the life of ease alone were to be also lost to him ? Could he look this girl in the face, or even trust her silence, if, after what he had just said as to his feelings for the widow French, he ?"], [260, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 252 For Simeon was wholly ignorant of the strong reasons she possessed for welcoming his action in that quarter. Already, when he moved away from her for the second time, the possibility of unsaying those contemptuous words was passing through his brain, or, at least, of explaining them away. No easy task. He cursed his folly \u2014 he cursed still more the folly of that would-be friend there, far away in the slums of the great city, who, possibly, at that very moment, was sweetening the bitter of old burdens reassumed with serene self-gratulation over the provi dential issue of a painful and happily well-past experience. ' Meddling idiot !' was the best that he could say of him. Deeply he ruminated on his mistake and sought a remedy. But the only possible one appeared in putting her wholly in the wrong as the cause and mainspring of his own behaviour, and by so wringing the con science that must be within her as to deprive her of the right or spirit to denounce him in return. To this her own confession prompted him. ' Forgive you !' he said presently. ' How can I ?' Her face quivered. He saw his power. ' Yes,' he went on, ' it is you \u2014 all you \u2014 you who have done it. Is he such a fool, or I ? Are we mad, the two of us ? A misconception ! A mistake ! Bah ! Could two so blunder ? Not we ! Have you no heart \u2014 no conscience either ? Flirt ? Call you that flirt ing ? You have no right to flirt if it means this, the ruin and the wreck of two young lives ! You have no right ! I say again, you have no right !' He waved his arms about, he trod to right and lest,"], [261, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 253 and, finally, he withdrew still further from her as if proximity to so infamous a person were too painful to support. His words took full effect, and perhaps the echoing reverberations of those solemn walls worked them the more irresistibly upon her brain. An even exaggerated consciousness of her misdeeds assailed her. She burst into tears, and, having again followed him, she fell on her knees at his feet. He was at once disarmed. ' Oh, don't \u2014 dont say that !' she cried. ' I didn't know what I was doing.' Presently he placed his hand upon her head. He was more cut up himself than he cared to own by this outburst of tears. ' No, Polly, you never meant it,' he said gravely ; ' I think I can give you credit for that.

As she wiped away her tears, she stared at him. ' With Mr. French, I mean,' said he. She paused before she spoke. ' I *ou haven't spoken too well of his mother,' she said, pouting. He winced. ' Then why should I ?' she asked. And then she thoroughly enlightened him. His ears drank in every word ; but he showed no sign of pleasure. ' She's kind and nice at heart, no doubt,' said she ; ' but you saw this afternoon that she's a little managing ; and, besides, you've said yourself you can't '"], [262, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 254 ' Well ?1 said he sharply. ' Can't anyhow care for her.' ' In that case your quarrel stands a chance of being permanent,' he answered. ' Things have fallen out somewhat unfortunately.' But though his words were sad, sadness was by no means revealed to a keen observer in his eyes. ' It seems so,' she said miserably. They were silent for a time. ' Oh ! is there no way out of this ?' she cried at last. ' I fear none, now,' said he. She looked up at his face piteously. ' But you did think \u2014 before \u2014 that you ' She hesitated. It was enough ; she had said the word. But he was not prepared to fall at once into line without some attempt to save appearances.

It has become a habit with him ; I have had occasion to observe it frequently.1 He watched her wince and stamp her foot. ' She is much more masterful than he is,1 he went on ; ' you can see that in their faces. She is bound to rule \u2014 and rightly, too. No wonder he believes in her, and trusts her word in everything. I myself have much admired her in many things. You would soon do so yourself.1 He saw the torture of his words, and, to his credit be it said, he did not relish their effect upon that face before him. Nevertheless, he added : ' You can quite under stand how he could never without the greatest pain give such a mother notice to quit his roof.1 She could endure no longer. She wrung her hands. ' Oh, save me ! Can't you \u2014 can't you, if for my sake only, do it ?' He regarded her for some moments silently, con templating the possibilities of renunciation for one so dear. ' Ah, me !' he sighed. ' I fear you know your power.1 She flung her arms round his neck and kissed him on the cheek. ' You will ! you will !' she cried. ' Oh, you are good !

The unaccountable delay in her son's return from town had compelled the widow to accept the invitation, not too sincerely given, to join in that homely meal, which took place at five o'clock, winter and summer, with unfailing regularity. Of all three, only one showed an equable countenance, the host himself. The two women, besides the unrest displayed in intermittent exclama- tions on account of the prolonged absence of their respective son and daughter, were altogether too much disconcerted by the events which had preceded, and were still at issue, to indulge in easy conversation, or assume an expression of comfortable and unconstrained enjoyment. Such observations as from time to time they did make always seemed sooner or later to revert to the anxieties of the situation on which both their minds were fixed, and of which the singular absence of the two principal characters seemed to accentuate the sense of strain. Ejaculations of surprise became at last the sum total of their talk. ' Pooh, pooh !' said Mr. Somers finally. ' What is there to worry at ? The child's gone for a stroll \u2014 was a bit upset and wanted to get round again, that's all. 17"], [266, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 258 And as for your son, ma'am, half a hundred things might be keeping him.

'There's a lot of harm the way she's carrying on,' returned Mrs. Somers ; ' and though she's my own daughter, I say it : she's been behaving more like a fool than ever I thought her capable of.

To this sentiment the widow agreed with grave head shaking. 'Tut, tut !' said Mr. Somers philosophically ; ' things'll come round.' ' They're coming round a queer way, then,' said his wife. ' Leave it to me !' said he, conscious of the master stroke that afternoon accomplished. ' Oh-h-h-h !' she exclaimed, as though the absurdity of that suggestion were too great for words. 'Leave it to me,' he repeated firmly, 'and if I don't put a stop to all this humbug, I'm not John Somers !' His tone was such as to inspire respect even from his wife. ' Only this afternoon,1 said he ; ' I've given that fellow a hint, and a broad one, too, as he'll find no friend in me. He can take it if he likes, or leave it; ' Why, whatever have you done ?' she asked.

That quieted her, and their guest, who had sat silent for some time, now rose, suddenly remembering she had one or two small affairs in the village to see to, for which the unexpected delay in her son's return afforded her an excellent opportunity that she must on no account let slip. Mrs. Somers pressed her not to leave them with an earnestness born of much suspicion, but without avail. Hastily, with a request that if Tom should arrive before she had returned they would desire him to wait for her, she excused herself and hurried off."], [269, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 261 On the disappearance of their visitor Mrs. Somers ventured to express herself once more. ' But I wish you hadn't done that, John,' she said with some vexation. ' Well, as if that isn't just like a woman !' he replied. ' First worry the life out of a man to get him to do a thing, and then find fault with every step he takes a-doin' it ! I wish I hadn't paid no heed whatever to you!' Mrs. Somers sighed. ' Well, it's very odd of Polly,' she observed. ' I've never known her not come in to tea before \u2014 and after being so upset ! I hope no harm is come to her. Perhaps she's drowned herself. If she doesn't come in soon we'll have to send someone in search of her, and the Lord forbid we mayn't in the end wish you'd shut her in there !' He tried to answer this by a loud laugh ; but it fell short and forced. An exceedingly uncomfortable sus picion began to get possession of him, and to become more than he could well conceal. It was necessary to retire and think it put. He rose once more and shambled from the room. He had scarce got to the back-door when he was waylaid by Bessie, entering in much haste. ' Please, sir,' she said, ' 'ere's Dick as is jest come back fro' the Rectory where you sent 'im, an' he says as he seed Miss Polly agoin' over the churchyard wall, he did, but where her went arter that he don't know, not a bit.'

Dick looked expectant of a demand for a repetition of his news, with a sense of the importance its possession was conferring on him in the master's eyes. But he was soon rudely disappointed. ' Well, what have you been seein' or not seein' now, eh ?' cried the latter. ' Just like you, starin' everywhere but at the work afore you ! Now get about it sharp ; d'ye hear ? And don't take near an hour on an errand you could do i' three minutes next time neither ! D'ye hear that, too ? Eh ? Now then, be off with you!' Dick skulked away quite crestfallen, but not so his companion ; he merely approached a little closer. ' Well, what do you want, young nipper ?' ' Mother sent me,' began Georgie in a weak, timorous voice, ' to know, sir, if Mr. Jebb, sir, 'ad been up 'ere, sir ; or if, as maybe, you know'd where ' ' D n it !' broke in the other.

It required a masterful effort to collect himself. Mayland was gone. So then, if anyone was shut within those gray walls over there it was not he ! He was accounted for. But there were two, at least, who were not. And one of them had been seen to cross that wall ! It was then that he remembered certain occurrences of that afternoon : the long unfamiliar visitor, his sleek attire, the unctuous warmth with which he had pressed the hand of the object of his former passion, the singular and almost impudent manner in which he had under taken to defend her feelings in the skirmish with the widow French, his speedy disappearance in her train.

' I'll go an' look.'"], [272, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 264 He suited action to the word ; but, ere he had gone a dozen paces, he was rudely checked. It was the farmer's voice, shouting at him to come back and go about his business. Mr. Somers waved his stick, and seemed to put a quite unnecessary amount of earnestness into this expression of his will. The boy turned and stared. But there was nothing to do but to obey without further protest, he being only too well accustomed to the rough humours of the world in general, and especially those of the so-called ' masters ' towards tender and juvenile spirits such as his. But, though his obedience was humble, its haste was by no means immoderate ; and the farmer found himself compelled to stand with ill-restrained impatience on that spot for certain lengthy minutes while Georgie painfully drew one leg past the other, and, with many injured glances round in his direction, finally disap peared into the road. Then, and not till then, Mr. Somers turned and glanced around him. Not a soul in sight. With a precipitation that would have astonished anyone who knew him, he plunged once more towards that wall and, for a second time that afternoon, he scaled those steps and, hot and panting, made for that little porch. He stepped in ; he crept towards the door. His first impulse was to seize the great iron ring that served as a handle to the latch within and rattle it. However, on second thoughts, he checked himself, and, stooping, put his ear to the large keyhole near. And then all his worst fears were realized."], [273, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 265 He heard voices not far away \u2014 in fact, quite close \u2014 in low tones \u2014 in tones of ! And both voices he well knew. Poor man ! That an apoplexy did not strike him on the spot was not the fault of his emotion, or of the blood-flow to his head and face. He drew himself erect, and leaned his arm against the massive stone jamb of the door. That darnation old fool of a George Merritt ! He had mixed his men ! He thought of his wife. What would she say to him now, to him who had always pooh-poohed her fears lest Polly should at any time come to feel differently towards this fellow whom once she had treated with no little tenderness, and who he himself had received that very afternoon with such effusive hospitality in spite of the warnings of his wiser half ? What, indeed ? And now he had shut them in this place together ! In that critical moment he thought of his wife's scorn and anger far more than of the impropriety of the position in which he had placed his child. For which he must not be blamed ; for in his honest mind he never conceived of any other unpleasantness for the latter in her imprisonment than that which would be involved in facing whosoever should arrive to let her out. And if he himself could be that one, even that unpleasantness should be reduced to a minimum. And his wife might never know of this mishap whilst opportunity would be given him in private to repair it. If he could be that one ! Instantly he turned, and, with the very lightest step that he could take, he stole from out the porch, and"], [274, "266 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH was soon on his way to the Rectory, thanking his stars that not a soul had seen him recrossing that low wall.

Master Georgie Merritt was agreeably employed, as was his wont, in putting two and two together.

The rector and his wife were seated and occupied much the same as when the reader last saw them. A news paper, as usual was on his knee. In her hand this time, however, was not a novel, but a letter. It bore the postmark of some place upon the way to Murkington, and might have been written by some traveller thither on the night before. She read it closely. When she had finished, she looked up and found his eyes upon her. ' A letter ?' ' Yes, from Mr. Mayland,' she replied, as she returned it to her pocket. She did not share with him the secrets of her corre spondence. She had long trained him not to expect it. ' Why does he not call, if he has anything to say,' he remarked irritably, ' instead of writing ? It is such affectation. So fearfully busy, of course \u2014 no time. Now, Jebb is always ready to turn up.' ' You always send for him.1 ' Because he conies when he is sent for,1 he replied. ' I don't get a message back to say he won't be in till nine or ten, or some other unearthly hour, as if the affairs of half the diocese were in his keeping \u2014 that's why.'"], [276, "268 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH ' That is not so this time, then,' she observed, ' you sent down to Merritt's quite an hour ago, and he has not yet come \u2014 unless this is he.' She listened to a footstep approaching the front garden gate. The next moment it was being thrust back, not by the strong figure of the curate, but by another equally vigorous, that of a female, whose features just for the moment she could not recall. It was not Mrs. Hargreaves' habit to visit much among the more prosperous class of her husband's parishioners ; she preferred to confer the favour of her graceful presence on those from whom any presumption of familiarity was well removed by the gulf between their place in life and hers. Thus the features of Mrs. French, as has been said, were for the moment doubtful to her. Then she remembered. ' It is French's mother, from the Leasowes,' she remarked, as she drew back from the window. ' What can she want ?' A minute later Mrs. Hargreaves was sailing into the large drawing-room to meet her visitor, her husband hobbling after her. The widow rose and held out her hand. The other took it with a supercilious grace ; the rector stiffly bowed. All three were soon reseated. It was a long time since they had had the pleasure of meeting, said the lady. The widow distressfully allowed it was. The rector gave a grunt. ' Wherefore now ?' it said. Mrs. French was well aware of their surprise. 'I've called,1 she began, 'about a matter which I"], [277, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 269 think you'll own, Mrs. Hargreaves, I ought to call about.1 ' Yes ; what is it ?1 ' Fd better begin at the beginning.1 ' Certainly.1 ' Well, then, in the first place I wish to know whether you and Mr. Hargreaves consider a church \u2014 which Fve always understood was the Lord's house \u2014 is a proper place for folks to be love-making in ?' Mrs. Hargreaves uttered a laugh. ' Why, no ; nor a convenient one, either,1 she said, ' now the pews are so low. In old times it was different. Has Mr. French been ?' She hesitated, smiling. ' I'm not speaking of the Sabbath, Mrs. Hargreaves,' returned the widow, with some offence ; ' I speak of week-days. Nor is it my son I refer to. I leave it to you whether it's likely he'd be inside that place those times. No, I dont speak of my son.1 ' I hardly know, then ' ' Week-days I1 exclaimed the rector. ' Will you have the goodness to explain ?' Mrs. French wiped her eyes with her handkerchief. It seemed there was some danger of her feelings getting the better of her. She breathed a moment and began. ' No, Mrs. Hargreaves,' she said, with a sigh ; ' but though it's not of my son I speak, it's for him I feel. He's been treated hard \u2014 real hard, though he should have known what to expect of a hussy like that. Perhaps you've not heard, Mrs. Hargreaves?

Is it possible you can be so blind ? What other man is there but one who has hypocritically been entering ?' ' I don't believe it ! If she means Mr. Mayland, she has been deceived.'

Why should I ? You know it is said he has been in love with her a long time.' ' I don't know any such thing \u2014 nor you either !' ' You suspect me of romancing,' returned the rector's wife. ' On the contrary, I am surprised that you were not aware of the talk also ; but perhaps, after all, I take more interest in my neighbours than you do. At any rate, I have heard this a long while. It is true, I understood she had repulsed him. But for all that, it is far more probable that she has renewed relations with him than that she should have taken up with poor Mr. Mayland, who is a man not at all, I should think, to her liking. And why should you be upset ? Does it matter to your son which it is ? In either case he has been cut out. I am very sorry for him \u2014 and you. What can I do to help you ?' She smiled at the widow with complacent sym pathy. But her mind was with her husband, and her anxiety to save herself from being proved completely in the wrong in the long dispute as to the merits of"], [280, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 272 the two curates. She thought she had returned a telling blow. And so his silence indicated. He had always been himself quite ignorant of Simeon Jebb's relations with the Church Fann. But though she saw that her words had taken effect with both her hearers, she had but little confidence in them herself. She knew that she had spoken very much at random. None the less, she smiled serenely. In the meanwhile, Mrs. French's physiognomy under went a transformation ; her indignation, her assurance, left her, and gave way, for a second time that after noon, to a nervous palpitation and alarm. Odd, inexplainable suspicions of the past rose up in confirmation of the supposition she had just been listening to, and wrung her soul. Mrs. Hargreaves wondered at her silence, ' What can I do for you ?' she repeated. ' Prove, it,' said the other in a low voice. ' Prove what ? That Mr. Jebb is the successful rival, not the other. That I cannot. I only give you facts. From them you can judge of probabilities.' ' Which are against you, my dear,' said the rector stubbornly. ' It is not likely Merritt could be so mistaken ; and we know ourselves who it is who has been hanging about that church. No, no.' The widow looked up with renewed courage. ' Stuff an' nonsense ! so it is, sir !' she exclaimed. ' And it's me who'll prove it ! He's in there now, most likely.' The eyes of the rector's wife opened wide. ' In where ?'"], [281, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 273 'In the church \u2014 and the girl with him, locked in. That's why I came.' A smile came over the other's face as her fingers closed around that letter in her pocket. ' Will you explain ?' she said. Shortly, the widow described the position at the Church Farm : how the girl had defied her and left the house ; how her conduct with the new curate had been discussed between her parents and herself, and the singular measure taken on the spot by the good farmer himself to put an end to it. ' And, sure enough, I believe he's shut them in,' she ended ; ' for the girl's been missing ever since.' Mrs. Hargreaves still smiled incredulously, which nettled both the others. ' You may smile, ma'am,' said the widow ; ' but will you come and see ?' ' It's true, it's true !' exclaimed the rector. ' Somers sent up the key just when you say.' His wife laughed outright. The widow flushed angrily as she rose to her feet. Then the maid entered and spoke low to her mistress. ' Ask him to come in \u2014 he must !' replied the latter. In a moment a heavy step was in the hall, and shyly and reluctantly the ponderous figure of Mr. Somers was ushered in. The poor man was in a dripping perspiration ; he gasped for breath. He staggered the least bit on seeing the widow, bowed awkwardly around, and turning to Mrs. Hargreaves, addressed to her a few words in an undertone. ' Mr. Somers would like the key of the church again,' she said to her husband with a smile ; ' he thinks the * 18"], [282, "274 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH foxhound pup may have got shut in there, as he's nowhere to be .seen.'

And he hobbled off to his study for the key."], [283, "CHAPTER XXII. Simeon's first inclination was to laugh ; but on turning round, and seeing the horror on his companion's face, he, too, realized the situation. To be shut in there for long hours, perhaps for the whole night, was bad enough ; but to be discovered there together, she and he ! She stamped her foot and wrung her hands. Nevertheless, the discovery must be faced, and the sooner the better. ' You had better shout,' said she. He did so. He shouted at the heavy wooden door ; he banged and shook it ; he struggled with the lock. In vain. His voice and all the noise that he could make were lost unless an opening could be found. Now, the windows of that church were all high and out of reach, save one small casement near the door, and that one of small leaded panes, unlatticed. But at the sight of her distress he did not hesitate. He looked around for something with which to break the glass. Then she clutched his sleeve. 'I have just thought,' she said; ' could you \u2014 could you do something, just for me ?' ' Why, as if you don't know it !' he replied. ' If when they come \u2014 if you could hide, and let 18\u20142"], [284, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 276 them think it's only me ! I'll come back afterwards and let you out.

You'll say, finding the door open, that you just walked in. Polly, you leave the rest to me.' He was honestly and sincerely glad to show his love for her, even at the expense of much annoyance to him self. She thanked him with effusion. He glanced around once more for something with which to smash that glass. But finding nothing to his hand, in his impatience to demonstrate his devotion he turned and struck the window with his fist. A pane flew out. But a red stream also trickled down his hand. With a cry she grasped his arm. She was little skilled in first aids to the wounded. But she was not one to lose her head ; she saw that he had severed a main artery, and that that blood-flow must be stopped. She bent the forearm back, held it aloft, stripped bare the wound, and in a moment had bound it with her handkerchief, and stopped the flow. He submitted to her treatment like a child. He would have been glad to have his other arm cut at the price. He let her lead him to a bench, on which they both sat down, without a word. She still held his arm aloft. He could not take the burden from her. Poor Simeon ! It was the first time in his life that fingers \u2014 and those fingers of all others had And that kiss, too, still on his cheek, which in her wild gratitude she had allowed herself to give him !"], [285, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 277 That gentle touch of her hand, he could not beg that it might cease. ' Ah, Polly !' he said presently, ' where should I have been but for you ?' She laughed. ' Why, much better off,' she said ; ' for you would not have been here.' 'You call that better off? Far worse, I call it,' he replied. ' Better off ! Not to be here, with you beside me, we together, we two, and one of us who could sit here for ever ! Polly, you know it !' ' I shall have to drop your arm if you talk so,' she said ; ' only I dare not \u2014 it may bleed again. And I think it does not now.' ' Then it is happier than my heart,' he answered gloomily. She started, and half released her hold ' I say it is happier,' he repeated. She dropped her hand entirely, and moved back. He was forced to take his arm into his own keep ing. ' Why do you do that ?' he asked. ' Why do you talk like that ?' she returned, ' Can't you see I cannot help it ?' ' It is a pity, then,' she answered. ' Polly,' he said, ' don't be angry with me. You can see, at least, it's hard.' ' I am very sorry.' ' Though you are beautiful and I am very ugly, we are both young. We feel the same, do we not ?' ' I suppose so.'

' Not quite,' she said. ' How, then ?' ' There are many things,' she answered, ' which she can give you, are there not ? \u2014 things that will go a long way to make life ' He sprang to his feet. ' There ! I knew it !' he cried angrily. ' You put me down for that ! And so you console yourself for the sacrifice that you are forcing on me. But let me tell you I am not consoled. I love you and you never, never shall forget it !' She, too, rose and moved away. He followed her, his bare and wounded arm folded across his breast, his eyes aflame. ' Oh yes,' he cried, ' you wish to pretend I do not suffer \u2014 that, at any rate, I shall not, in order that your mind may be at peace, your joy unmarred ! But I tell you you shall not deceive yourself \u2014 no, you shall tell me that you know I have lost all in losing you, or I will not let you go !' And he flung his uninjured arm around her. She uttered a slight scream. But at the same time, another sound was audible behind her. In spite of his passion, he, too, heard it. 'It was only a book falling,' he said, without re leasing her. But she pointed to a window up aloft. He turned, and saw a boy's face grinning down at them through the unstained panes \u2014 for a moment only. The next, and it was gone."], [287, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 279 He let her free. With a flushed face, he moved towards the door. A key was already rattling in its lock ; whisperings were audible without ; and then the latch was raised, the hinges creaked, and both stood face to face with their deliverers. They were unnecessarily numerous \u2014 so both thought. And they appeared to be unnecessarily excited also, or, at any rate, one member of the party. With heated face, Mrs. French pushed her way in before them all. Mrs. Hargreaves laughed. Her husband looked unhappy. Mr. Somers puffed and blew, and turned his head away. Simeon stood erect, his wounded wrist, with his coat sleeve replaced, thrust beneath his coat. ' This gentleman,' said the rector's wife, pointing to the farmer, ' has given you a brief imprisonment. But it seems he now regrets it ; so here he is come to let you out.' ' It was an ill-played joke, then,1 said Simeon. Mrs. Hargreaves laughed again. ' Not so,1 she said ; ' you had good company.1 ' Mr. Jebb,1 said the farmer gravely, ' you must excuse me. But I didnt know, not a bit, as you were in this place.1 ' It was only when he missed my young friend here,1 continued Mrs. Hargreaves, pointing to Polly, ' that he guessed he had been a little indiscreet. He should have looked inside first ; only he naturally was dis inclined to thrust himself where certainly, he was not wanted.

She glanced round at her husband, heavily supporting himself upon his gold-mounted black malacca cane \u2014 he whose certainty of the immediate and complete exposure of his wife's misjudgment had overcome the reluctance of his gouty feet to make one of their party. ' You are glad, are you not ?' she asked again. ' I should very much doubt it,1 said a sharp voice beside her. She turned towards the widow. ' What ?' she asked. 'That he's glad to see us. Very much, indeed, I should.1 ' Why not ?' said Simeon. ' I wonder at your asking,' replied Mrs. French. There was an unpleasant pause. ' I don't know what you mean !' cried Polly at last. ' Perhaps it's you don't wish to, Miss Somers.' ' Tut, tut !' said the farmer, laying his hand on the widow's arm. ' There is no \" tut, tut \" about it,' she replied.

There was a medley of voices at this point; but Simeon's rose above the rest and drowned them. ' Mrs. French,' he cried, ' there is some misconception. Yes, I swear there is ! Miss Somers, let me speak. I have the right. 'Tis most preposterous, tis utterly incredible, that the mere accident which has placed us in this position should be made use of for such insinua tions as are these. I should have hoped that my reputa tion alone would, at least, have saved me from such treatment. Mr. Hargreaves, sir, I appeal to you whether this is ordinarily fair or just to condemn a man like I am before hearing him, and on such paltry evidence \u2014 a mere fortuitous mishap, ridiculous, if you like, but nothing else, for which this gentleman is mainly, I am bound to say, responsible \u2014 nothing else.' ' Ay, ay,' said Mr. Somers, gladly accepting the reproof. But the rector pushed through to the front, and, holding out his hand, clasped Simeon's. ' Mr. Jebb,1 he said, of course we know it. And, of course, this lady here1 \u2014 pointing to the widow \u2014 'is labouring, as you say, under some mistake. And, no doubt, the disappointment her son has suffered has rendered her unduly sensitive on the subject of this young lady's friendships. But what does that matter ? I am sorry for her. But it is no concern of ours. What does concern us is our mutual reputations ; and let me fully assure you that yours will in no way suffer, at least, in my eyes, by the fact that you were acci dentally locked in a church in the sole company of a"], [290, "282 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH young lady, to whom, I have no doubt whatever, your attentions would never be anything but both honour able and discreet. So let that be enough. I have no doubt whatever.1 As he finished, he shook once more the hand he held with many smiles. A moisture even came to Simeon's eyes. ' My dear James,1 said the rector's wife, in cold, clear tones, ' how nice to hear you speak so ! It is quite a lesson in good feeling. I am sure there is not one of us who Why do you laugh ?' This last was addressed to someone behind her, to whom immediately all eyes were turned. It was a small boy, who, emboldened by the possession of certain facts to which it was probable some others there were strangers, had crept in close, and, with both eyes and mouth wide open, was absorbing earnestly the scene before him, for he had knowledge enough of the principal performers therein to be able to enjoy its evolution, and so, also, he had no mind to have his pleasure prematurely shortened. The rector's attitude, opposed as he alone knew it to be to the solemn and sacred facts, was inclined to threaten this, and thus it was that, betwixt indignation and vexation, his feelings got the better of him. Passive witness he could remain no longer. A sarcastic chuckle broke in his small throat. ' Why do you laugh ?' asked Mrs. Hargreaves, shrewdly guessing why. But beneath the general observation bashfulness assailed him, and he remarked with much confusion that he didn't know. But her husband, so she felt,"], [291, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 283 had overridden her and snubbed her, and she was not inclined to let slip any chance she saw of answering him. ' Why, boy, why did you laugh, though ?' she repeated. Simeon grew pale and Polly scarce drew breath. But the boy refused to speak. ' Who is he ? Merritt's boy ? Send him about his business !' cried the rector. ' What's he doing here ?' ' Be off with you, and sharp !' said Mr. Somers. But the lady interfered. ' Stay,' she said ; ' that boy was laughing, and perhaps he'll answer why.' ' My dear, I am surprised !' exclaimed her husband. But she turned from him and pointed to the window. ' Speak to this lady, boy, and tell her what it was you saw up at that window there. She has a right to know.' She was aware of the sensation which her words produced. It was most amusing that she alone of all of them should have observed up there, at a certain window, on entering the churchyard But Georgie, anxious as he had been to derive the fullest entertainment from a situation of surpassing interest, was by no means so far gone in egoism as to wish, after all, to get it at the expense of an old friend ship, and one which, since the exemption of the previous night from the retribution proper to his sin, he had considered to have stood the test of a great strain, and merited return. So he merely smirked, and wished very much now that he had not so far disclosed himself. But the lady was not to be denied."], [292, "284 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH ' Come,' she said, ' you can tell her, no doubt, that everything you saw there was \u2014 what were the words ? \u2014 \" both honourable and discreet \" ; of course you will.' Thus put to it, the boy found dissimulation more than he could any longer manage. He writhed and squirmed, with a broad grin upon his face of little doubtful meaning. The widow gave an exclamation of supreme disgust, the rector thumped his stick upon the floor, the farmer looked as if he would like to lift that lad by the aid of his thick boot as far as the middle of the horse-pond on the off-side of yonder wall. Polly began to sob, but Simeon cleared his voice and spoke. Nevertheless, it was husky with emotion. ' Mrs. Hargreaves,' he said, ' you have taken me severely by surprise. Yes, madam, I must say it. You, the wife, the respected wife, of my revered master here, you have prepared for me a shock such as only my constitutional buoyancy and the integrity of my conscience can enable me to bear. Yes, indeed, you have not spared me. You have delivered me a blow as cruel as it was undreamt of, and by a hand, after that of my dear master here, hitherto by me the most esteemed in all this world \u2014 a hand that I had thought had been held out to me in sincere friendship, and which, accordingly, in my turn, I had pressed with a like emotion, all the more profound as it was that of a young man far your inferior in birth or station.

' But, madam, let me remind you that it is often said that even a worm will turn, and I most certainly shall do so. I shall not submit without a struggle to the loss of honour dearer to me than life. ' And, first, as to that boy there, on whose evidence you would rely in an attempt to prove that I have abused a chance position by behaving in a manner unbecoming a gentleman, let alone a clergyman, towards this lady here. A word about him\u2014 and I ought to be able truthfully to speak one, for I live, as you are aware, under the same roof with him, and have interested myself no little in his character and general education ; and I must say it has been no cheering occupation, and, were it not for his poor parents, I should long have abandoned a task so sad and hopeless, for, I regret to say, I have found him simply bad \u2014 bad altogether, and I have had to tell him so. Which explains his present conduct, conduct all the more infamous as, by an act of his, for which I had meant to pardon him, he knows, strangely enough, the secret of my heart, that sentiment which in itself would render absolutely absurd this charge which you, madam, are so willing to prefer against me ; for it so happened that only yesterday I sent him with a letter to that lady for whom my life is sacred, full of expressions of my feeling, which, seeing that he thought fit to open it and read it on the way, he cannot possibly have failed to comprehend."], [294, "286 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH ' Now, fortunately, it so happened that he was caught in the very act of doing this by that dear friend of mine, this lady's son, who brought that letter back to me much torn and fingered, and who is, therefore, a witness, if you want one, of the truth of what I say, and will support it. However, I only mention this to show you the quality of your informer. But let that pass ; I tell my tale, which should suffice.' ' Enough ! enough !' cried the rector, grasping again his hand. 'More than enough, I say. Waste no more words \u2014 enough !' ' Every bit,1 said Mr. Somers. ' Let's get out o1 this. Come on.1 He moved towards the door, with Polly, once more radiant, by his side. The widow wiped her eyes. But Mrs. Hargreaves still stood unrepentant, whilst she scanned the boy's face more closely. He scowled. ' It's lies !' said he. ' I see'd 'im 'uggin' 'er, I did, an' 'e seed me !' At this, there was an explosion of strong words on every side, Mrs. Hargreaves standing protectress of the boy against her husband's threatening cane, Mr. Somers vigorously expostulating, Polly entreating the widow, well-nigh in hysterics, to be calm. But Simeon's voice again rose over all, and it was towards the latter lady that his words were this time turned. ' And so you weep, do you ?' he cried, in well-feigned wrath. ' Well, weep, then \u2014 howl away ! I don't care what you do if you have no more faith than that ! Nor do I care what I do any more than I did then, when, finding myself shut in here in the company of that young lady, instead of seizing the opportunity, as you"], [295, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 287 believe, to pain her innocence and degrade myself within these holy walls, I smote a piece of glass from yonder window in my burning haste to set us free, and cut that vein which, possibly, but for her prompt care, might by now have borne me out of reach of your mistrust. And if in her anxiety to save my life she allowed herself to approach my person nearer than otherwise she would have done, and so exposed herself and me to the accusations of that wicked lad, whom we both saw at the window with no thought of shame, I can only say that, since her conduct gives you so great pain, I much regret it ; I much regret that an im peccable propriety did not restrain her, that from the first, rather than run the risk of censure, she did not leave this gaping wound to flow and drain my life to its last dregs, as it shall now !' And he snatched his hand from beneath his coat \u2014 where hitherto with calm discretion he had strictly held it \u2014 and, waving it aloft, ripped off the blood-stained handkerchief that bound the wrist, and let the red stream flow afresh from the really ugly, if not dangerous, wound. A wild scream came from the shivering object of his stern address ; the next moment, she had rushed upon him and, seizing his arm, began to rebind that wrist the while she leaned her head against his breast. Now, the reader can well imagine that for three, at least, of the onlookers the termination of this tragic scene came as a more wonderful surprise than all before, and one, for the two males, most heartily acceptable. They advanced towards the sufferer with loud con gratulations and expressions of sympathy, in which she,"], [296, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 288 the lady, was also fain to join them, having, for her part, to offer apologies as well, which cost her much. Nevertheless, she honourably performed them, and they were as generously accepted. In the meantime, Polly had thrown her arms around her father's neck, and they were kissing each other like two children in their joy. It was then that the rector called to mind that small and spiteful being, the cause of all this unnecessary agitation so happily passed through. He swung upon his heels with all the verve his gouty limbs would grant him, his fingers clutching his thick cane ; but the object of his wrath had disappeared. However, Georgie's discreet abandonment of a scene which had so steadily evolved to his complete discredit, perhaps, was not regretted even by the elder clergyman himself. For all was now aright and as it should be ; and gladness breaking into hilarity but for the restrain ing precincts \u2014 in which, now that the heat of action was past by, all grew conscious they were standing \u2014 shone, with but one exception, on each face ; and even hers, that of the rector's wife, looked pleasant. ' Oh, father !' exclaimed Polly, still with her arm around his neck, ' you were an old silly to go and shut us in. You were, indeed ! Whatever made you do it ? Well, never mind. I am even glad now that you did. Yes,' she repeated, glancing at Simeon and her now possible mother-in-law \u2014 ' yes, I am so glad !' ' And so am I.' However, it was not the good farmer from whom came this response; but from a voice behind him. Everyone started."], [297, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 289 ' I am, indeed ; I also am exceedingly grateful to you, Mr. Somers, for shutting me in here.' ' You ?' ' Quite so. Why not ?' replied Tom French slowly, in answer to this general exclamation, a grim look on his face. ' I'm interested here as well as others. It's true I didnt mean to spend so much time in the place, nor in quite such a confounded sort of corner, with my back half broke into the bargain. But there ! you cant have everything. I had business on, you see \u2014 mighty interesting business, too. I came for facts, and \u2014 well, I've got 'em.' He twitched his mouth and nodded, and seemed in no hurry to proceed. Now, at those words, at this new presence, the senti ments of two of his hearers may be again imagined. Once more \u2014 yes, for Simeon Jebb, all was once more over \u2014 a certainty assured by the whole manner and tone of the new-comer, and only feebly modified for her, Polly, by the consciousness, which flashed in that supreme moment through her brain, that she had been faithful to the latter in that scene which he must now have overheard, had declared her love for him in no vague words. For would that, could that, be enough to overcome his sense of filial duty, to enable him to overlook certain expressions \u2014 not to speak of other conduct \u2014which had fallen from the lips of his father-in-law to be ? Alas ! she felt it could not. His manner fully justified her fear. She clung to her father's arm, and with piteous eyes awaited his next words. 19"], [298, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 290 Simeon's eyes rolled guiltily in the direction of his feet. But while for these two this last surprise was such a shock, it was taken very differently by the other members of that party. And first, the good farmer burst into a loud guffaw, which not even the sanctity of that spot could sup press. ' Well, I'll be blathered !' he cried ; ' if this don't lick it all right out ! And if I don't deserve to be put in that there horsepond myself ! Gad, if I don't !' ' Sh-h-h ! my friend, and remember where you are,' said the rector, laying his hand upon his shoulder with a smile of genial rebuke. ' The current of affairs a little carries you away. And certainly this is a droll occurrence. You were unfortunate, I must confess, in your first attempt to carry out my wishes. You snared the wrong birds altogether. But now, all's well that ends well. Mr. French, I am sorry for your mishap, as I, in part, occasioned it, not knowing my friend's zeal would be so active. Accept my apologies. And now let us get without. You must have had enough of such confinement.' He waved his hand towards the porch, anxious to cut short the interview ; for he already saw a look of renewed confidence in his wife's eyes. She stepped towards him. ' Stay a while,' she said, touching his arm. ' Mr. French has not yet finished what he has to say. He came for facts and got them.' She turned and faced the young man with a look of full inquiry."], [299, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 291 All faces now followed hers, but mostly with an expression very different. Polly's was blanched even to the lips ; Simeon's was blue as though the blood were stagnant in it. Instinctively, the widow had dropped his arm ; but her new-found faith was powerful enough to keep her near him as she set her features to await her son's next words. That calm and masterful individual at last began : 'Well, in the first place, I dont mind telling you how I came here, if you want to know,' he said leisurely. ' I came in upon the spy \u2014 that's how. And not much to be proud of? Well, I dont know that it was. But then, you see, I thought that I was getting bested ; and perhaps I'd some good reason to think so' \u2014 he glanced at Simeon \u2014 ' at any rate, I came to see.

Well, now, it's not for me to say he'd not as much right to go after her as I have \u2014 not at all ; but only how he sets about it is the thing. Play if you like, but play fair. Now, I ask you, sir ' \u2014 turning to the rector \u2014 ' is it fair play of him to take advantage of the nearness of this place to the young lady's, and the opportunity he's got of turning in here at all hours, to make this church a meeting place where he can talk with her, and all the rest, and me not in it, nor, as he thinks, in'any danger of being in it ?

' Well then, sir,' continued the young man, ' that's just what brought me here.

At least, I found two of them inside, and busy, too, if jabbering at each other goes for anything \u2014 so much that I squeezed in and took my place back there without so much as interrupting them one word, or losing one, into the bargain, seeing they spoke a good bit above a whisper, each of 'em. And so much the better, eh, my boy ?' he added, turning to Simeon and digging him in the ribs \u2014 ' so much the better, eh ? I came for facts, and I got 'em !' Simeon tried to smile, but gulped instead. Polly gasped. Mrs. Hargreaves gave a silent inward laugh. ' I got 'em !' repeated the young man with emphasis, ' though I warrant you this back of mine didn't like it much, the getting. But what matter that, when I was learning so much, when after two good hours or more of stooping I'm at last able to come out of my earth with a light heart like a fox on a May morning, and congratulate my good friend here on the happy days in store for him, which none knows him to deserve better than me.

Need it be said the scene which followed was a glad one ? Need it be told how the girl sobbed upon his breast, and how upon Simeon's the widow's blushes were a second time concealed, while the good rector smiled his pastoral blessings upon either couple and shook his warden by the hand. And if his wife did not exactly join him in his benedictions, she had the taste to look equally content and kiss the girl, whose happiness, now that her own contentions were matters of the past, she was sincerely pleased to witness. And if some momentary rebellion against the untoward circumstances which, even now, she could not but feel had placed her unjustly in the wrong arose from time to time within her as her fingers closed around a certain letter in her pocket, she told herself that with her best philosophy she must submit, since in that envelope was written once for all the end and close of further argument ; for to the spiritual and clerical administration of the parish of Great Marley was harmony once more restored."], [302, "CHAPTER XXIII.

And so, as leisurely that morning he let his eyes fall upon the scene without, he rubbed his hands. The door behind him opening, he slowly turned ; it was the maid with breakfast. As she entered the comfortable room, with its well ordered furnishings, its heavy chairs and massive side board \u2014 a little out of harmony perhaps with that modern dwelling-place, and seeming to have been trans ported from beneath some older and robuster roof\u2014 she brought therein no access of disorder, being herself, in her person, of the neatest, and that which she carried of the best and brightest.

And, underneath a dish-cover that gave back one's features in lines not complimentary from its mirrored face, the master, eyeing all with measured gaze, knew that a titbit would be found, done to a wonder of perfection, the possibility of which had only been revealed to him on entering that stage of his career in which, with every reason for congratulation, he now was moving. Following close upon the maid entered the good lady of the house herself. Though evidently long past the prime of youthful beauty, her figure was of amiable proportions and her face wholesome and full-coloured. Indeed, it was very much so at that moment ; for she had come straight from the kitchen fire where, with her own hand, she had been manipulating those viands to that fine finish we have just suggested.

' What ! don't you want to hear ?' ' I know all he's got to say,1 said he. 'But about Polly?1 she persisted. 'You would surely like to hear about her ?' He did not answer, but he seemed to wince. 'You dont seem very anxious about your step daughter,1 she said, with a smile. Again he winced. ' I cant eat and listen,1 he replied That was sufficient. Of course his relish of her culinary labours was not to be spoilt. She tore open the envelope, and commenced to read its contents to herself. ' Well, she's going on famous !' she exclaimed presently, ' and the child too ; and I'm sure I'm glad to hear it. But he does dote on her. I believe he worships the very ground she walks on, getting her this and that, and everything that comes into that head of hers to ask for. So she'll be more spoilt now than ever. Ah, what things men are ! And what queer judgment ! And Tom, of all others, to have taken up with such as she! However, there's no denying it, he's lost himself entirely over her, and I do believe, after herself, she's fond of him as can be. Well, well,' she sighed, ' they're happy, I suppose, so there's an end of it !'"], [306, "298 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH Her eyes rested on her husband's face with the look of one whose satisfaction with her own matrimonial selection was not to be disturbed by the anomalies of others. But he exhibited no outward feeling, facial or otherwise, at her remarks, nor did he even raise his head. It was true that a fine morsel on the way to his mouth did never get there, for the hand that bore it stopped halfway, and then gently restored it to the plate from whence it came ; but that was all. And yet, as she regarded him, a mild astonishment began to take the place of her serenity ; a chill wave of vague per ception visited her. She rose to combat it. ' But it's a wonder, all the same,' she said, ' that he's so fond of her, for she's been a worry to him all this while, and no mistake. Poor boy ! he's had to go without his comforts, I know well ; and no more able to than you, Simeon, after always having them. Dear, dear ! I sometimes wish we hadn't come so far away. He must be patient with her to have stood it, mustn't he?' ' No doubt,' said Simeon. ' Hey-day !' she said. ' I fear there's many a trouble with it all in store for him, poor boy !' But he did not respond. His fingers were trifling with that envelope beside his own plate, the address of which, in this breakdown of gastronomic pleasure, for the first time he regarded closely. It had been much redirected, from the Great Marley post-office to the Leasowes farm in that same parish, and finally on to its right destination. She did not hasten to inquire from whence it came, for his correspondence, which was very limited, existed almost entirely with members of"], [307, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 299 his own family, from whom, being, as she was well aware, of a social status much inferior to his, and requiring often pecuniary assistance, which from time to time he had persuaded her to forward them, she was not by any means too anxious to hear, and, somewhat unjustly, she supposed him to share the same sentiments. So she was not surprised to see him take up that letter with a clear reluctance, and tear it open gingerly. She returned to the reading of her own. In the meantime he read thus : ' Brick Lane Mission, 'Murkington, ' September 18, ' My dear old Friend, ' I must again sit down to beg of you, to pray to you, to write me, though your inexplicable silence has refused me any satisfaction for the letters I have already sent you, and which I would not have desisted sending but for this wretched illness, which has now laid me again for more than four months on the shelf. But now that, thank God ! I am afloat once more, I cannot wait without another appeal to our old friendship to make you speak to me and let me know the best or worst, whichever, by God's will, it was I brought upon you. And, alas ! my friend, your silence makes me fear the latter ; you could not otherwise so refuse to drop the crumbs of your great happiness upon poor me \u2014 to let me put this weight of guilt behind me as a nightmare of the past. Oh, Simeon, is it possible that after all I did deprive you of your one life's bliss \u2014 that love so truly made for you, and you for it, that now, as I look"], [308, "300 A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH back on it, I wonder how it was that anything was able to postpone its consummation ? No, even now, I cannot, will not, credit it. Even now, in spite of all your silence, I must believe that she is yours, that a long scene of earthly joy is opening before you by her side, rich in each other's love and youth and blessed health, and that it is only the very fulness of your bliss that leads you to forget my need to share it, or perhaps that even yet will not quite let you pardon him who sought to rob you of so great a prize. Yes, Simeon, even this last explanation gladly will I accept, hard as it is, if only it be true. Despise me, hate me, if you will ; so long as I do not hate myself as the ruin of your life, I am content. Send me but these three words, \" She is mine,\" and, if you wish it, you shall never hear from me again. This is my sole request, and if consideration for me alone is not enough to move you, think of my work which crowds upon me here, and suffers from my heaviness of heart \u2014 my work, which is yours also, to which, under whatever fate, I see you bracing daily all your powers with that grand earnestness and trust in self you know I always envied so. Let this alone decide you not to deny me further, nor let any merciful reluctance to tell me of the worst that I have brought about \u2014 if, as I dread to think, that may be the motive of your silence \u2014 hold you back, for anything but this uncertainty would be welcome, doubly welcome. The truth ! I want the truth ! ' Here, then, I send you, Simeon, one more appeal, assured that you will answer me at last, and not drive me to the alternative over which I long have hung with great reluctance, that of applying to the Rectory or to"], [309, "A COMEDY OF THE CLOTH 301 our old landlady \u2014 and perhaps still yours \u2014 for informa tion, for in doing so I should expose to other eyes this painful breach between us, and perhaps unwarrantably expose you to an accusation of neglect. And, besides, since the singular answer Mr. Hargreaves thought fit to send me to my letter of excuse, I am loath to correspond with him, or even with his wife, whose sentiments as regards me he was good enough to hint were scarcely more favourable than his own. And so to you, my friend, to you yourself once more I must resort, believing firmly that this time my entreaty will not fail of its result. I must believe it. ' Your old friend, yearning for relief, ' Edgar T. Mayland.' As Simeon read, he cast a look from time to time across the table towards his better-half, but she was well absorbed in her own reading. His eye ran swiftly to the end, when, with feeble prudence, he crushed that letter hotly in his hand and pressed it into his side pocket. The crumpling noise aroused her. She looked up. ' What is it ? Another come to grief? What a lot there are ! Well, don't be upset, dear ; let me see it. I'll do what I can, I'm not so mean as that !' she cried, with glowing generosity on the top of the good news her son had sent her \u2014 ' not me ! Come, let me see, and go on with your breakfast like a good boy, do.' And she held out her hand. But he declined, whilst his complexion took a tone of deeper red.

LODGE, Author of ' The Mystery of Bloomsbury Crescent,' * A Son of the Gods,' etc. Country life and its amusements, county society and its amenities, mingled with much realistic and really stirring romance, make up the staple of this interesting story. Mona, the heroine, arrests the reader's attention from her first introduction, and the strange mystery of the first Lady Sandrock is skilfully woven with a masterly touch into a moving plot which tempts one on from chapter to chapter. There are many characters, and all are well individualized. The Mitford family supply of themselves a fine vein of genuine comedy, and there is abundance of unexpected incident to keep the tale moving briskly on to its very striking denouement. Some Press Opinions. Daily Telegraph. \u2014 ' Mrs. Lodge's \" mystery \" is one of considerable perplexity, in the preparation of which all sorts of unlikely incidents happen, while its denoue ment is painfully, nay, distressingly, tragical ; a story which is unquestionably fraught with sustained interest from its first page to its last. . . .
