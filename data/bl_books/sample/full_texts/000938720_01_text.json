CERTAIN men were journeying along a road, when some learned ones amongst them stopped, and de clared there was no road at all beyond the next turning ; and, without more ado, they chose another, \u2014 a cross-road over the moor, whilst the remainder went on as before. Presently other learned men came up, and began arguing scientifically on the subject ; but, as their data varied, so did their con elusions ; and those who agreed with the men who had turned aside, laughed at those who did not. Then some one who was of no account among them, and had a very small voice, said the cross-road led straight into a quagmire ; but scarcely any one of either way of thinking listened to him, for they thought it impertinent of him to say anything about it. Nevertheless, though of no account, he was right in that matter (as anyone might have seen, by being at the pains to look a little way before), and, if A 2"], [6, "U INTRODUCTION. anyone happened to hear his small voice he was veiy glad. And he said to himself : \u2014 \" The multitude of swallows, though they be but little birds, impresses the advent of summer on people's minds ; and the multitude is composed of units.\" So he said, and repeated, that the cross-road did lead straight into a quagmire ; and he said \u2014 \" Per haps one or two insignificant as myself may listen.\" And I say the same in respect of the following lines. The learned and the scientific argue in favour of the two different roads. 1, an insignificant unit, simply say in a small voice, \" Quagmire ahead.\""], [7, "VALUE OF FAME.
