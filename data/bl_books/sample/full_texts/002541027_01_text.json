Although the verses of Mr. Moore, in which allusion is made to the scenery of the Meeting of the Waters, and their course through the Vale of Avoca, refer rather to his own feelings than to surrounding objects \u2014 to the enjoyment de rived from the society of dear friends, than to the charm of the landscape; \u2014 though the poet distinctly tells us, \" 'Twas not the soft magic of streamlet or hill \" that gave birth in his bosom to the wish for a life of seclusion in this happy valley, where, mingling in easy intercourse with those whom lie esteemed and loved, his days might glide peacefully away \u2014 a wish as gentle in its nature as it is by him felicitously expressed ; \u2014 yet there are few lines in the English language, the pre cise local appropriation of which has occasioned more discussion. B"], [18, "2 THE MEETING OF THE WATERS. Mr. Moore states, that \" the Meeting of the Waters forms part of that beautiful scenery which lies between Rathdrum and Arklow;* in the county of Wicklow; and\" that his verses \" were suggested by a visit to this romantic spot in the summer of the year 1807.\" In an other note he adds, that the waters of which he sings are those of \" the rivers Avon and Avoca.\" Poets have ever been considered privileged persons when dealing with mere matters of fact ; and as Spenser of old has blundered about the Irish rivers Allo and Blackwater, so has Moore, although in a different way, confounded the Avon and the Avoca, which appear, from his expression, to meet, whereas the one loses itself in the other,- \u2014 as we, in our character of illus trators of the Landscape Scenery of his Irish Melodies, are in duty bound to prove. And this, perhaps, will he best done by a topographi cal sketch, which, by means of A, B, and C, we can expound to our readers, as we would a geo metrical problem. A, then, is the town of Rath drum, and B the town of Arklow ; C the point * Rathdrum is about thirty miles south of Dublin, and Arklow is further distant ten miles from Rathdrum."], [19, "THE MEETING OF THE WATERS 3 at the Meeting of the Waters, which our view represents.* The bridge in the distance crossing the Avonmore, so is the river from A to C called ; the bridge in the fore ground crossing the Avon- beg, which flows from D to C. From the junc tion of the Avonmore and Avonbeg, at C, to the town of Arklow (B), the river receives the name of Avoca. Avon CUBdn, compounded of <U), sweet, me lodious, musical, murmuring, and <^n, water,) signifies in English a stream; more (mop) great, and beg (be<^3) bttle. Hence the great and little streams terminate at their meeting (C), and their united waters become the Avoca (&n boc^n), in Enghsh the crooked water, evidently so called from its course. The name is of the highest antiquity ; for on a reference to Ptolemy's Geo graphy, it will appear that the river Oboca (sic in editione Coloniensi per Gerard. Mercat. 1584) empties itself into the Irish Channel south of Eblana (Dublin). * The sketch from which it was taken was made in 1815."], [20, "4 THE MEETING OF THE WATERS. \" Avonmore, which name signifies the great winding stream,\" says Fraser, in his Survey of Wicklow, (thus, by an attempt at translation, confusing the Avonmore and Avoca), \" corre sponds most happily with its character, the banks continually forming the finest waving lines, either covered with close coppice-woods, or with scattered oak and ash of considerable growth ; the ground in some places smooth meadow and pasture, in others rising in roman tic cliffs and craggy precipices. At Avon dale, the Avonmore meeting with the Avonbeg or little Avon, the united streams assume the name of Ovoca ; and passing by Shelton, it emp ties itself, through a bridge of nineteen arches, into the sea at Arklow, whence it keeps its stream distinctly marked from the sea for near half a mile from the shore.\" But the question raised is, whether, as an other river, marked E, called the Aughrim (as descending from a mountain-village of that name), or the Derry, and sometimes the Avon hue C^lbAn buiSe, yellow stream), from being joined by a brook (H) out of the Gold Mine district, which stream falls into the Avoca at F, does not form the meeting sung by Mr. Moore ? The writer of a recent ramble in the county of Wicklow"], [21, "5 THE MEETING OF THE WATERS. observes, that \" the birthplace of Homer was not more keenly contended for by the several cities of Asia, than the honour of the real Meeting of the Waters by the inhabitants of the head and bottom of the valley. They are both,\" he con cludes, \" well entitled to the honour, for both are very beautiful.\"* Mr. Wakefield, who travelled through the county of Wicklow in June 1809, two years after' the visit of Mr. Moore, thus describes the situa tion of the grounds of Cronebane (G), with con siderable local accuracy, although, to any one uninformed of the change of name in the river, with an extraordinary vagueness of expression \u2014 \" The two rivers, the Avon and the Avoca, wind round it (G) in a semicircular form ;\" and he continues, \" this curious spot has given rise to tbe delightful lines of Moore, entitled ' The Meeting of the Waters,' which have been set to music. \"-j- From which extract it would seem that in 1809 the locality was fixed on the eastern bank of the river (at G), where the Avonmore merges itself into the Avoca. * Dublin Penny Journal, vol. ii. p. 235. f Wakefield's Account of Ireland, Statistical and Po litical, vol. i. p. 53."], [22, "6 THE MEETING OF THE WATERS. Mr. Wright's Wicklow Guide* informs us, that \" at the distance of three miles from Rath drum (A), the sheltered road at length opens to the valley of Cronebane (G) and the Meeting of the Waters (C). On your right the Avonbeg (D) rolls its rapid torrent over a rugged, rocky bed, while the more majestic flood of the Avon more (A to C) is heard beneath the hill upon the left. In front stands a beautiful little demesne, the house belonging to which is in the cottage style, occupying the tongue of land (C) formed by the rivers at their junction. It was on a rustic seat here, formed from the root of a tree, that Moore is said to have written the words of that Irish melody called ' The Meeting of the Waters.' This pretty cottage,\" adds Mr. Wright, \" has, in the space of a few years, submitted to the dominion of different masters. It is now, in 1822, in the possession of W. Lees, Esq.\" Thus, in the course of a dozen years, the scene of Mr. Moore's composition was transported across the river from G to C, and a rustic seat, not improbably made out of the root of an oak from the far-famed woods of the neighbouring Shillelah, appropriated to the poet : * Page 70."], [23, "THE MEETING OF THE WATERS. 7 0 poet's chair ! what discords mingle In thee ! \u2014 Sweet thoughts of worldly quiet By strange association jingle With broken heads and drunken riot ; Avoca's bright and peaceful valley With Donnybrook's wild shout and sally.* We confess ourselves unwilling to scrutinise too closely into the authenticity of these national associations, or rudely to disturb the \" memo ries of sweet songs,\" so ingeniously combined ; rather do we desire that they should flow on together, like the waters of the Avonmore and Avonbeg, \" mingled in peace.\" But it is im possible not to be struck with the fact, that this seat was dedicated to Moore soon after the re cord placed by Lord Holland in an alcove of his grounds at Kensington, respecting Moore's friend and brother-poet : \" HERE ROGERS SAT, AND HERE FOR EVER DWELL TO ME THOSE PLEASURES THAT HE SINGS SO WELL. And the playful lines of Mr. Lutterell, written in that alcove, will sufficiently vindicate our reason :1 Who has e'er had the luck to see Donnybrook fair, An Irishman all in his glory is there, With his sprig of Shillelah and shamrock so green.\" Popular Song."], [24, "8 THE MEETING OF THE WATERS for not minutely questioning all that is assert ed; as \u2014 \" Nor garden nor grove, Though poets amidst them may linger or rove, Nor a seat e'en so hallow'd as this, can impart The fancy and fire that must spring from the heart.' The successful transfer of a locality from one side of a river to the other renders it no matter of wonder that we should find such locality boldly carried down the stream. In the Angling Excursions of Gregory Greendrake through Ire land,* it is asserted that \" this [Meeting of the Waters], although, in my [Mr. Greendrake's] opinion, the more beautiful, is not the celebrated Meeting of the Waters, which is about three miles further in the vale. Here the scene is closer, and of more concentrated beauty.\" \" On a promontory,\" says that worthy disciple of ho nest Izaak Walton from whose Angling Excur sions we have just quoted \u2014 \" On a promontory (F) formed by the conflux of the Avoca with a mountain-stream from Aughrim (E), opposite to the woods of Ballyarthur, is a point of view per haps excelled by none in any country. From this spot no less than five valleys or glens may be * Part I. p. 91. 1824."], [25, "9 THE MEETING OF THE WATERS. seen, all bearing some features of resemblance, yet each so distinguished by peculiar and appro priate beauties, that no person, having any per ception of the sublime and beautiful, could be hold this magnificent scene without admiration and delight. It is this spot that furnished the inspiration to one of Moore's Melodies\u2014 ' There is not in the wide world a valley so sweet.' ' Where tourists, guides, and travellers, are at issue upon a point, \u2014 where the poet himself, in the notes annexed to his verses, has not very satisfactorily fixed the precise spot of his inspira tion, \u2014 where it is said that he was actually appealed to in order to terminate the contro versy between the points C and F, \u2014 it may be asked, upon what authority we have ventured our illustration ? We do so upon the general character of the scenery, and upon the effects which close and extended views produce upon the mind ; the one naturally suggesting ideas of retirement ; the other leading the thoughts away to distant ob jects, each possessing its own association, and thus creating thoughts and desires as numerous as those objects, and as varied as the prospect. Mr. Moore, who, of course, must be considered"], [26, "10 THE MEETING OF THE WATERS. the first authority in this contention, replied, we believe, to the letter addressed to him upon the existing controversy between C and F ; and, willing to give \" a local habitation\" to the verses which had acquired for him \" a name,\" conceded all that was desired of him in favour of the point C, from the possessor of which the application came. In consequence a tablet was placed, or it was intended should be placed, with an in scription, possibly recording, like many other inscriptions, \u2014 what was not the case. No one can doubt, however, from the inter nal evidence, as well as the external polish, of the verses in question, that although the ideas they contain may have occurred to the poet's mind in the Vale of Avoca, yet that the verses were the product of a subsequent period, when the memory of a happy visit came mellowed upon the heart ; and that they must have proceeded from a re collection of the general effect of the whole valley, rather than from a vivid sensation excited by any particular spot. In all ages of the world, and in the various migrations of the children of Noah from the plain of Shinar in Mesopotamia (su fieo^> tun iroTXfiuv) to the boundaries of the earth, there has existed in the fancy of mankind a strong"], [27, "11 THE MEETING OF THE WATERS. predilection for such spots as were enlivened by the junction of two or more streams, and recommended by the \" meeting of waters.\" Ever since our first parents were expelled that delicious garden whence issued \" four streams to irrigate the four quarters of the globe,\" it would seem as if a reminiscence of Paradise had mingled itself in the fondness which the confluence of limpid brooks is sure to generate in the human breast. We find the same feeling prompting the early settlers, the founders of the most celebrated cities, in the selection of such points of territory as were distinguished by the union of two or more mighty rivers ; and though commercial foresight may have had some share in the arrangement, it cannot be doubted that other and more mystic attraction was mixed up in the preference. The children of Japhet, when they scattered themselves through Europe \u2014 which was \" All before them where to choose, And Providence their guide\" \u2014 were not unmindful of this in the adoption of their places of abode ; as the many cities in Greece and Italy seated at the junction of classic streams abundantly testify. In Gaul,"], [28, "12 THE MEETING OF THE WATERS. Lyons at the confluence of the Rhone and the Soane ; in Palestine, C\u00e6sarea at the junction of the Jor and the Dan (Jordanis) ; nearer home, the Roman station of Dorchester, where the Thames falls into the Isis (Thamisis), \u2014 illustrate this position : and following the course of the Thames, we actually find the chosen residence of England's poet, Pope, at Twickenham, which \" is as much,\" says Norden, \" as Twynam, quasi inter binos amnes situm, a place scytuate between two rivers.\"* The first-mentioned instance, \" lentus Arar Rhodanusque celer,\" has been often selected by the poets of the country as a spot with which many mysterious associations are connected. The slow, gentle, and silvery tide of the one * Although quoting the words of Norden's Speculi Britannia in support of our argument, we are aware that some distinguished Anglo-Saxon scholars derive Twicken ham from Tpejen ham \u2014 two houses. The facetious ob servation of Mr. Jacob Jones Johnson, in his Elements of Colonial Statistics, page 231, when coupled with the opinion of Father Prout, given subsequently in our text, is not only remarkable, but well worthy of consideration : \" Wherever two houses were found associated as a village, one of them was sure to be a store for the sale of spirits, and the meeting of travellers naturally led to the flowing of strong waters.\""], [29, "THE MEETING OF THE WATERS. 13 gliding into and absorbed by the fierce and rapid current of the other, has furnished the Muse of the Troubadours with many a fanciful illustration of the union of female sweetness with martial energy \u2014 the blending of souls dif ferently gifted, but still formed to combine into one harmonious flood of existence. The old erotic poetry of Clement Marot is full of such allusions : ex. gratia, in his \" Fare well to Lyons :\"* \" Adieu, la Saone, et son mignon Le Rhone, qui court de vitesse, Et s'en va droit vers Avignon,\" &c. And, no doubt, his German brethren of the lyre found equal source of fanciful illustration in the several tributary streams that fall into \" the arrowy Rhine,\" as at Coblentz (confluentia). The junction of the Missouri and Mississippi was looked on by the Cherokee Indians who wandered in those parts as a spot sacred to inspiration, and the meeting of these mighty rivers raised awe and veneration in the natives. Whether Mr. Moore was conscious of these recondite matters, in localising his feelings at the * Vol. ii. p. 189. edit.

It was the strong conviction of this undoubted truth, that set the mind of the late respectable P. P. of Watergrasshill, the Rev. Andrew Prout, on the scent ; he seeling satisfied that some thing beyond what met the ear could be elicited from the lyrics of Moore. That worthy divine, in a commentary on the Irish Melodies (as yet in MS.) puts a query to the reader, the sagacity of which, we think, will strike every Irishman at the first glance ; viz. whether the real Meeting of the Waters (Hibernice Uif5e, Anglice whisky) was not to be sought in the fusion and com mingling of common spring-water with that dis tilled ambrosial fluid called alcohol, either in the shape of dew from the mountain, or in regularly manufactured spirit ? During one of those periodical visits which \" the poet of all circles, and the idol of his own,\" was wont to pay to his ghostly adviser, the mountain hermit \u2014 \" My child,\" did Prout say to him, \" believe me, all this metaphysic about blending of souls, and all these reflections \" from looks that we love,\" must be resolved into their"], [31, "THE MEETING OF THE WATERS. 15 simplest expression to suit homely and primitive tastes like my own.\" And then the old Father would hum somewhat as follows \u2014 to the air of \" Noch bonin shin doe:\" \u2014 You may talk about songs while the kettle is singing \u2014 But your streamlets and naiads I vote them a bore.

Inniscattery, or the Island of Scattery,* near the mouth of \" The spacious Shenan [Shannon] spreading like a sea,\" has been styled in an Irish MS. called the Book of Ballimote, \" the wonder of Ireland.\" And well it may, if we are to credit the legend which Mr. Moore has followed in his version of the dialogue between St. Senanus and the lady who sought his holy isle, in a vessel guided by an angel, \" Through wintry winds and billows dark,\" and was inhospitably repelled. * Inniscattery was anciently called Innis Cathai \u2014 without doubt from the Irish word C<^cA3 which signifies worship \u2014 the Island of Worship. The name Scattery seems to be derived from the legend respecting the ex clusion of women, and literally means, the island devoted to one species : [fC&C, a kind, species, gender ; and pe, belonging to.\u2014 O'Reilly.]"], [33, "I\"-\u2122 \"Ill Engraved by S.Rawle. n NHIHATHEIIY. /uisie- asia, have, this sacred fsU tJn/buly baric, ere tnorntfuj smite ' -hcd bv -I Power. 3i.S a Sketch by the Hon.*?\" Mils _"], [34, ""], [35, "17 INNISCATTERY. This lady, it appears, was no less charming a person than St. Cannera of Bantry \u2014 a cele brated beauty in her day ; but Senanus adhering literally to the stern doctrine of St. Augustin, that even angels are not to be loved, to prevent all chance of such a result, most rudely refused the visit of the pious sister. A commentator upon the incident (Mac Slatt), some of whose observations upon Inniscattery we shall here after transcribe, is pleased thus to declaim : \" What a model of inflexibility the worthy saint appears ! Even despite of the reasoning of the lady, and his own disrelish to offer any thing like it in reply, he carried his point \u2014 avoided all occasion for a breath of scandal, and esta blished a laudable precedent of sanctified stub bornness for those who thereafter were to suc ceed him. Would that others beside him could follow his example ! and we should soon see the overbearing domination of the tyrannical sex pulled down, and their haughty power levelled with the dust. \" There is an unwarrantable license,\" he continues, \" taken with the saint on this occa sion by Mr. Moore in his song of ' St. Sena nus and the Lady.'

' But legends hint, that had the maid Till morning's light delayed, And given the saint one rosy smile, She ne'er had left his lonely isle.' As a hint may be equivalent to a broad asser tion, I applied myself to the consideration of it in all its bearings ; but, though I have examined every legend on the subject, oral and written, and have been most painstaking in my re searches, I have to declare \u2014 and it befits my gravity, and Sinon's reputation, to set the pub lic right \u2014 that no such hint is any where to be found, and that the poet has been guilty of an intent to libel, in alleging its existence, which even his license cannot justify. This you will be so good as to mention in Bantry, where, I understand, the ladies have assumed some airs, on tbe strength of the imagined success of this rosy smile of their countrywoman on our vener able recluse.\" Now, we maintain that it is only under such boyish affectation of misanthropy, protected by a nom, de guerre, that the conduct of Senanus can, for one moment, be defended. He was, accord ing to his biographers, a native of Ireland ; and if no other circumstance than that under dis cussion were recorded of his island, the want i"], [37, "19 INNISCATTERY. of hospitality in an Irishman, and in a situation where hospitality is so much required, would have been sufficient to stamp the spot as a wonderful exception in that land of which old Owenson was wont, and with truth, to sing \u2014 Hospitality, all reality, no formality, There you'll ever see.\" The saint is said to have been a native of Hy-ConaH ; a district affording food \u2014 for ru mination at least \u2014 to its starving peasantry ; having, through the mutations of time, \" fallen from its high estate,\" and now become Connel loe, in the county of Limerick. It is not, per haps, an uninteresting inquiry, to trace the gradual extinction of every kindly feeling in Senanus : like the infant Hercules, who in his cradle strangled the snakes which attacked him, so do we perceive Senanus stifling in his youthful breast the feelings of the heart. Fe rocity, cruelty, revenge, and obduracy, are the fruits. A single act of rudeness, or indeed an iso lated act of almost any sort, may, by the mere exercise of Christian charity, be excused or ac counted for. But when unkindness seems asso ciated with our nature \u2014 to \" grow with our"], [38, "20 INNISCATTERY. growth, and to strengthen with our strength,\" it admits of no defence. We appear not, then, as apologists for Senanus, the very first act of whose official career was an outrage upon the sympathies of nature : \" Qui ad abbatis imperium* Custos factus pecudum, Citm quodam die precibus Incumberet attentiits, Videt matrum uberibus Jam imminentes vitulos, Quos pastor fidelissimus, Ut lac servaret fratribus, Intermittens piam precem, Segregavit ab invicem, Et figens ibi baculum, In signum vel obstaculum, Rursum incumbit precibus, Nee potuerunt amplids Diei toto tempore Ad invicem accedere, Per viri Dei baculum Disjuncti ab alterutrum.1 Who, being bound by holy vows, Was sent to tend the abbot's cows : When so it chanced, one day while praying, Most fervently his bead-roll saying, He saw the calves by stealth approaching, And on their mothers' teats fall poaching.

And as it is not unfair to conclude that the same cause will produce the same effect, to what other can we rationally attribute the awe with which both cow and calf regarded the bludgeon of Senanus ? There is nothing in the words of the chronicler to shew that this respect was not inspired by terror : in fact, after the poor animals had been most unmercifully belaboured, the mere sight of the cudgel raised in the ground was suffi cient to keep them asunder. Yet this is called a miracle ! So much for the statements of partial and poetical biographers. There is no wish on our part further to investigate the conduct of Senanus. He is ad mitted to have been rude and inhospitable. We have advanced sufficient to convict him of cru elty under the 3rd Geo. IV. cap. lxxi. ; and we question if a most plausible indictment against the saint could not be framed upon the fol lowing statement of the informal manner in which he empounded the horses belonging to a neighbouring prince, who, in a very quiet way (for an Irish prince,) caused a few to be ferried over from Kilrush, or somewhere thereabouts,"], [41, "23 INNISCATTERY. just to fatten a little upon the pasture of Se nan's island. The saint's mode of pounding cattle for trespass was truly a summary pro ceeding. We will copy the poet's account of the transaction, which we recommend to the at tention of geologists ; prefacing it with what he says of the provocation \" Jubet equos ad pascua Duci in ipsa insula, Humanum est consilium ; Terra enim aperuit Agens in modis omnibus Ut exiret episcopus : Sed nihil contra Dominum Os suum, et absorbuit Caballos quos direxerat, Nee unus supererat.\" Which in our jingling way may be rendered : Then horses sent he from the strand To graze upon the saint's fat land, Thus taking every means he might To cheat the priest out of his right. But, man will aye be disappointed, Who seeks to hurt the Lord's anointed : The gaping ground yawned wide and hollow, And gulped the horses at a swallow ; Nor left was one the tale to tell, What to them one and all befel.

No fewer than eleven churches are recorded to have been built upon Inniscattery by its pa tron saint, who is stated to have died there on the 1st of March, 544. The word church, how ever, thirteen hundred years ago, and even some centuries after, had a very different meaning, as applied to a building, from the import of the word at present. It was in fact a mere cell, her mitage, sanctuary, or even grave, as the name ceill or all, which corresponds with the Latin cella, imports, and which in the form of Ml is to be found so fearfully compounded in Irish local names, that perhaps no better motto could be found for Holbein's \" Dance of Death\" than Pat's well-known speech of, \" I've been at Kil many, and I'm going to Kilmore.\" Connected with the former sanctity of In niscattery, the most remarkable object at pre sent is the Round Tower represented in the Plate. We have used the word \" remarkable\" advisedly ; for this tower is an important land mark in the navigation of the Shannon, and it is also probably the most ancient building upon the island. It is said to measure one hundred"], [43, "25 INNISCATTERY. and twenty feet in height, and springs from a base twenty-two feet in circumference. Although scathed and rent by lightning, the original roof remains. While its fellow pillar-towers, as at Kildare and Cloyne, have been compelled to assume embattlements, that of Inniscattery re tains its primitive covering, and stands proudly crowned with that barrad, or conical cap, which, according to Walker,* the national architects and sculptors of Ireland regarded as a dress becom ing even to angels. Thus also commanding re spect and admiration, like the man who, through the chances of time and changes of fashion, pre serves his rectitude and supports his character. Various have been the conjectures, and angry the disputes, about the date, origin, and use of what Giraldus Cambrensis describes as \" turres ecclesiastic\u0153 \" nor is it yet perfectly clear that, amid the cloud of mystery which conceals the origin of these buildings, hawk eyed Truth has pounced upon the quarry. This, however, being a delicate subject, it is for us merely to state what does not appear in our view, \u2014 that the entrance to the tower of Innis cattery is level with the ground ; a circumstance * Essay on Irish Dress."], [44, "26 INNISCATTERY. deserving of notice, as one of very rare occur rence in the construction of the Irish pillar tower. Within a few feet of this \" blighted cy linder, [as Mac Slatt calls the Round Tower of Inniscattery], there is a beautiful well, of course full of sanctity, and almost universally sanative. There is,\" he adds, \" a descent to it of about thirty steps ; but at the time of my visit the water had risen up nearly to the margin.\" Although it has been asserted that eleven churches were built upon the island by Se- nanus, the remains of seven churches or cells only are now to be traced ; from a glance at which it is evident to the eye of the architec- tural antiquary, that the date of the build- ing of three of these ruins must have been long subsequent to the days of the ungallant saint. \" The cathedral, [which is seen in the Plate, close to the Round Tower], St. Mary's church, and one other,\" observes a modern pil grim to Scattery,* \" are in the pointed style, but possess no particular attraction. The neigh bourhood of the latter is used as a burying- * See Dr. Mac Slatt's Pilgrimage, in Bolster' s Quarterly Magazine, No. X.

Teampul an eird, i. e. the church on the height, is of similar dimensions, and equally unadorned. The light was admitted into each of these Liliputian temples by one or two very small windows, little superior to loop-holes, so narrow, that, when entirely open, we must be struck with surprise, how the light which they admitted could have sufficed.\" But the learned Mac Slatt's wonder, and the somewhat tedious train of reasoning into which he falls in consequence, might have been spared to his readers, had he studied more closely the metrical legend of Senanus preserved by Colgan, and from which he quotes, as, ac cording to it, a brother belonging to the pious community, wondering, like the Doctor himself, at the saint's power of reading in so gloomy a cell \u2014 \" Per fenestram \u00e6dicul\u00e6 Sinistr\u00e6 mantis digitos Videns, hujus Christicol\u00e6 In modum lucis fulgidos."], [46, "28 INNISCATTERY. Meaning, in plain English, that \u2014 Peeping through the narrow casement, He beheld, with great amazement, The saint's left hand as five wax tapers, Each finger tipped with gas-like vapours. How curious it is that this miracle, which seems to have escaped the notice of so grave a commentator, should illuminate the Comic Annual for the present year (1835), where it appropriately appears as a light-fingered il lustration, \u2014 for not one word is said in the way of acknowledgment ; and an attempt, more over, has been made to identify the saint with a London pick-pocket \u2014 \" one of the light fingered gentry.\" Let Mr. Hood look to this matter while he may ; remembering what befel the original discoverer, \" Grus qui ibi fuerat, Fecit in eum impetum, Eique avulsit oculum.\" Ut Senanus pr\u00e6dixerat, That is : So, as Senanus had foretold, A crane, who thereabouts was flying, Attacked the peeper, and behold ! Poked out his eye to check his prying. During the ninth and tenth centuries, Innis cattery suffered severely from the incursions of"], [47, "INNISCATTERY. 29 the Danes. But through the revolutions caused by Danish invasion and Anglo-Norman conquest, its community strictly maintained the founder's vow against the admission of a woman into the island \u2014 even to refusing the rights of sepulture. In one case only, that of tbe abbess of a neigh bouring convent, on the main land, whose dying request was to be buried at Inniscattery, a compromise appears to have been made. \" On the shore, at low-water mark, a large stone is pointed out, called Leacht an bhan banuha, i. e. the funeral stone of the holy woman. It was raised in consequence* of St. Sinon's rule, which was firmly adhered to for several ages, to per mit no woman, either living or dead, to enter his sacred island.\" In a Memoir for the reformation of Mun ster, which was drawn up for the information of the English government in the reign of Henry VIII. by Edmund Sexton, who was Mayor of Limerick in 1535, and who had pre viously distinguished himself by his efforts to advance the English interest in Ireland, Inniscat tery is described as an island within tlie mouth of the Shannon, distant eight miles from Loop- Head, at the northern entrance of that river. Upon the island the merchants of Limerick"], [48, "30 INNISCATTERY. dwelt, and had castles and stone houses of their own inheritance, \" with a provost or warden, who might dispend a hundred marks yearly.\" There was, adds Sexton, much devotion in the island to an image called St. Shenard, and a great old church, wherein never went a woman since the death of that saint. He recommends the place as a proper situation for a fortress, which, with one ship of sixty tons and two or three galleys, would keep O'Brien, Desmond, (that is to say their countries, the present coun ties of Clare, Limerick, Kerry, and Cork,) and all the Irish from Waterford to Gal way, in awe. It is somewhat remarkable, and a proof of the slow progress of the reformation of Ireland, that, at the distance of three hundred years, we should find a floating fortress moored off Innis cattery, in His Majesty's sloop of war the Nim rod, (1831), in order to keep in check the insurgents of Thomond and Desmond (North and South Munster). \u2022 In 1583, Queen Elizabeth granted the abbey of Inniscattery, with twenty-four acres of land, some buildings thereon, and certain customs, to the mayor and corporation of Limerick. \" Also ten cottages, one church in ruins, twenty acres of wood and stony ground in the said island,"], [49, "31 INNISCATTERY. called Beachwood, with all the tithes, &c.\"* at the annual rent of 3/. 12s. 8rf.

Giraldus Cambrensis, who visited the place in 1185, has recorded an incident in which the benevolence of Kevin's disposition is evinced even to almost superhuman endurance. It was the holy man's custom, during the season of Lent, to retire to a little chapel of difficult access, still to be seen at Glendalough, beneath the frowning cliff of Lugduff* there to pray and meditate. Whilst wrapt in his orisons, with his hand ear nestly extended towards heaven, a blackbird alighted upon it, and in it deposited her eggs.

Are not Kevin and Senanus enshrined in the verses of Moore ? and will not St. Patrick live in song, as \" a gentleman Who came of decent people ? \" It is time, however, that we should arrive at our immediate subject\u2014 the Bed of St. Kevin; and in this there is some difficulty, as the reader possibly has felt, and will perceive when it is ex plained that the bed in question is a cavity in the face of the nearly perpendicular side ofLugduff, marked in the Plate by a cross at one end, and the figure of an anchorite at the other ; and that this hollow is at a fearful elevation above the dark waters of a deep lake. Whether the bed was excavated by art, or was originally a natural recess, has not been satisfactorily demonstrated. Probably, Nature, like the genuine inventor, gave the idea, and Art, stepping in with a little aid, seized upon the hint, adapted it to her own purposes, and carried off the reputation.

A subsequent publication, at the close of 1834, makes the height of St. Kevin's bed \" some twenty-five feet\" over the lake, and fully con firms the average annual motion of either rock or water, to be deduced from the statements of Mr. Wright.

If rescued from transmutation, these relics are consigned to the cabinets of the curious, and, there buried, leave only on the memory the present poor condition and gloomy aspect of the country, in which gold formerly abounded, more dark and cheerless.

And though true it is, that the hope of wealth which the announcement of a gold mine excited, has not been realised, yet the fact that a considerable quantity of this precious ore was collected, is a proof how little even of superficial observation was ever bestowed upon the country ; and it is therefore fair to argue how much of what is concealed from the eye remains to be explored in Ireland.

From him and his brothers I learned that about twenty-five years ago (1770), or more, one Dunagboo, a schoolmaster, resident near the place, used frequently to entertain them with accounts of the richness of the valley in gold; and that this man used to go in the night, and at break of day, to search for the treasure ; and these gentlemen, with their schoolfellows, used to watch the old man in his excursions to the hill, in order to frighten him, deeming him to be de ranged in his intellects : however, the idea of this treasure did at last actually derange him. \" John Byrne told me, that, about eleven or twelve years ago, when he was a boy, he was fishing in this brook, and found a piece of gold of a quarter of an ounce, which was sold in Dublin ; but that, upon one of his brothers telling him it must have been dropped into the brook by accident, he gave over all thoughts of searching for more.

When the story of the Gold Mine became bruited abroad, which was towards the close of the year 1795, and fortunately after the golden har vest of autumn had been gathered in, the sensa tion it produced upon the lower classes is not to be described. Thousands, of every age and sex, hurried to the spot. \" From the labourer who could wield a spade or pick-axe, to the child who scraped the surface of the rock with a rusty nail,\" all were eagerly employed in searching after gold. The Irish are a people possessed of a quick and rich fancy ; and the very name of a gold mine carried with it, to the ignorant mind, ideas of inexhaustible wealth, and conjured up into reality the Bardic tales they had heard repeated in their childhood, many of which rival in gorgeous imagery the romances of the East. The Valley of Diamonds sparkled on the north side of the county of Wicklow ; and covery at the time, but gave no credit to it, as he never found any gold, and lives very near the place.

De Latocnaye, a French emigrant, who has published an account of his rambles through Ire- land, and who visited \"the Wicklow Gold Mines\" immediately after the government had placed a guard upon the ground,* says \u2014 \" I was often obliged to ask the way, and my demand excited the curiosity of the peasants : they quitted their work before they answered me, asked me some question in my turn, wanted to know if the mine would be soon worked, if government had sent me there, and a thousand things of the same nature : they soon began to tell me of a person who sent his children there on a Sunday morn- ing after it had rained, and that they brought back gold to the value of twenty guineas. In such cases,\" M. de Latocnaye truly observes, \" the persons who find any are remembered ; and those who lose their time, and sometimes their life, in a fruitless search, are forgotten.\" \" I had,\" he continues, \" a letter from Mr. B. Conyngham for the officer of his regiment, * \"On the 14th October, 1795, two companies of the Kildare Militia marched into Arklow, and on the following day proceeded to guard the mine, on the part of his majesty.\""], [83, "59 THE WICKLOW GOLD MINES. who commanded the troops stationed to guard the mine, and to prevent the peasants from work ing there.

The gold has been found in pieces of all forms and sizes, from the smallest perceptible particle to the extraordinary mass of twenty-two ounces, which sold for about eighty guineas. \" This piece was irregularly formed ; it measured four inches in its greatest length, and three in breadth ; its thickness varied from half an inch to an inch;\" and a cast of it, gilt, has been deposited in the museum of Trinity College, Dublin. So pure was the gold gene rally found, that it was the custom of the Dublin goldsmiths to put gold coin into the opposite scale to it, and to give weight for weight. \" Stanesly Alchorne, Esq., his Majesty's Assay-master at the Tower of London, assayed two specimens of this native gold.
