MADE INTEKESTTNG. INTRODUCTION. The present work is in great part based on a lecture delivered by the Author before a highly influential, intelligent, and fashionable audience in the Concert Room of the Queen's Royal Hotel, Dalkey. The lecture had its origin from a conversation on Dalkey, its ancient port, holy wells, and its seven castles, with Mr. Henry Parkinson, T.C, and Mr. J. Burke. By these gentlemen, the idea of delivering the lec ture on the antiquarian and historical associa tions of the place, in connexion with the beauties of the Bay of Dublin, was first suggested. The welcome with which the lecture was received, the warm approval elicited through out its delivery (manifesting the intensity of the interest felt on the subject), and the express desire of many resident ladies and gentlemen of influence, that matters of so much local concern should assume a more permanent form than that of a mere lecture, have induced the Author to compile and publish the following pages containing the substance of the lecture,"], [14, "Introduction. VI and very many additions, which he hopes will render the work more acceptable and entertaining, and more worthy as an historic record of the just celebrity of this and other localities on the shores of our charming Bay. The Author has used every exertion, and spared himself no labour of research to attain these objects. The Concert Hall of the Queen's Royal Hotel, Dalkey, formed a portion of the cele brated \"CastleHouse\" \u2014 the hospitable mansion erected by Sir John Hasler,* who with his friend Sir Harcourt Lees, came over to Ireland in the Court of Viceroys, the former with the Duke of Rutland, and Sir Harcourt with the Marquis of Townshend. t The history of this house is replete * The present Mr. John Hasler, Poor-law Guardian of the Rathdown Union, and the active and intelligent Commissioner of the Kingstown Township, and Surgeon Hasler of Killiney, are grandsons of the hospitable Sir John Hasler, who did so much in the last century to beautify Dalkey and preserve its ancient castles, one of which stood at the entrance to his gardens, which reached the sea, on part of which Mr. Edward Harrison's (the worthy Towd Commissioner), establishment is built. It was here the find of Saxon coins of the time of Edgar took place (referred to iu this work;, while removing the old castellated pillars of Sir John Hasler's gateway. Portions of the walls and extensive stabling of this mansion are yet standing. Sir John Hasler entertained, on many occasions, the humorous and facetious, though somewhat eccentric, Sir Boyle Roche of Dublin Castle. See Appendix, \" The Castle of Dublin in the Olden Time.\" t The Marquis of Townshend, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, was the patron of the elder Sheridan. The following anecdote and witticism is related of this great actor : \u2014 During Lord Townshend's viceroyalty Mr. Grenville and his brother left Bath for Dublin, on a visit to his Excellency.

How ever the Author may justly affirm that the social reunions and festivities of the present day among the fashionable circles of Kingstown, Dalkey, Knliney, Clontarf, Shanganagh, Howth, and Bray, may fairly challenge comparison for good taste, elegance, and refinement. Social life at Dalkey, Killiney, and Dun leary, in times past, was enlivened by many illustrious and distinguished men of various professions who left the impress of their genius upon science and literature, and adorned social life by the bright corruscations of their wit, the fascinating elegance of their converse, and the lustre of their lives.

It was here that Curran first read his popular song, ' ' The Deserter's Meditation, \" which he had written in the West of Ireland, under the following circumstances : As Mr. Curran was travelling upon an unfrequented road, he per ceived a man in a soldier's dress sitting by the road-side, and ap parently much exhausted by fatigue and agitation. He invited him to take a seat in his chaise, and soon discovered that he was a deserter. Having stopped at a small inn for refreshment, Mr. Curran observed to the soldier that he had committed an offence of which the penalty was death, and that his chance of escaping it was but small : \"Tell me, then,\" continued he, \"whether yon feel disposed to pass the little remnant of life that is left you in b"], [20, "Introduction.

Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, landed here with a strong force, against Hugh O'Neil, Earl of Tyrone* * Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex (Queen Elizabeth's particular favourite), a distinguished soldier, and passionately fond of military glory, was created Lord Deputy of Ireland in 1599, and sent over with a larger force, and invested with more extensive powers than had ever been committed to a Viceroy, to extricate the affairs of the government from the pressure which threatened them with destruction. He had a commission for disposing of the lands of the insurgents, for proclaiming aud executing martial law, and for placing and displacing all officers at pleasure. He had an army of 20, 000 foot and 13,000 horse, and a military chest well provided with money to pay them. Essex found even this force to be unequal to that of the enemy, whose troops were better disciplined and more patient of fatigue. He first led his troops into Munster, by the advice of certain privy counsellors, whose property lay in the south, which they wished should be protected. Here, he could do nothing effectual against the enemy, who, avoiding an open action, iu which only he coidd have a superiority, attacked him from their retreats, hung for days together upon the rear of his army, which was considerably diminished and exposed to pressing difficulties. Meanwhile, Sir Henry Harrington, whom he had left in the Wicklow Glens with 600 men, was attacked by the O'Byrnes, and defeated. Hugh O'Neil, Earl of Tyrone, had not been inattentive to his interest ; and having received ammunition from Spain, seized par ticular passes necessary to his security, and received into pay a number of Scottish forces. He took possession of an advantageous situation in the neighbourhood of Newry, which he fortified by strong entrenchments, and there determined to await the approach of Essex. The Earl had now returned to Dublin from Munster. By this time he was acquainted with the number, with the strength, and with the military skill of the insurgents, and fore saw the difficulty of reducing them to obedience by open force. Impressed by this conviction, he had written to the Queen, and given it as his advice, that to guard the Irish coast, to prevent the enemy from receiving foreign aid, to waste their country, to destroy their provisions, and thus gradually consume their strength, was,"], [43, "Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex. 17 \"In 1560, the troops, ammunition, and ordnance sent from England to be employed against Shane O'Neill, were landed at the crane on Merchants' quay, Dublin.\"* though more tedious, the sure and effectual method of compelling them to return to their allegiance. Elizabeth was annoyed, rejected the advice, and enjoined him to march directly against Tyrone. Even now, instead of obeying, he marched into Leinster against the O'Moores and O'Connors. In this expedition, equally unfortunate with that into Munster, he so diminished his army, that he was obliged to write to England for a supply of 1,000 men. He was equally unsuccessful in an attempt which he made to call the attention of Tyrone towards Baleek. There, 1, 500 men, detached under the command ot Sir Couyers Clifford, being attacked at dis- advantage by the chieftain O'Rourke, were defeated ; and, had they not been relieved by a body of horse, which fortunately came up to their assistance, would have been entirely destroyed. At last, Essex resolved upon an expedition to the north ; but, on reviewing his troops, he found that he could not lead there more than 1,300 foot and 300 horse. With this inconsiderable force he set forward, and reached the borders of Ulster about the middle of September. To engage the enemy with such inferior numbers might have been fatal ; he therefore parleyed with Tyrone, and concluded a truce of six weeks, to be renewed for a like space until the 1st of May, neither party to commence hostilities without fourteen days' notice. By this step, Essex still more highly provoked Elizabeth, who ex- pressed her resentment in a letter to him on the occasion, in very warm terms. In confidence that by a personal interview he would be able to revive that affection with which the Queen had formerly treatedhim,hesetofffromDalkey immediately for London, not only without permission, but in express contradiction to her order. To guard against the advantage which his enemies, of whom he had many, would take of this rash step, by making an impression unfa- vourable to him on the mind of her Majesty, immediately on his arrival he hastened to her apartment, cast himself on his knees, and endeavoured to disarm her resentment. Surprised by the un- expected appearance of her favourite, which prevented reflection, and excited a sudden emotion of that regard which he had long ex- perienced, she received him graciously. The comfortable hopes with which this reception inspired him w6re transient. With re- collection, the displeasure of Elizabeth returned. She confined Essex to his apartments, and then committed him to the Tower. Having regained his liberty, he was hurried, by the impetuosity of his temper, into an act of open rebellion, for which he was executed. * \"History of Dublin,\" by J. T.

Iu 1178, the celebrated Archbishop O'Toole* (Lorcan * This truly illustrious Irishman, and venerable and excellent prelate, who succeeded to the high preferment of Archbishop of Dublin in 1162, was the youngest son of the hereditary Lord or Petty Prince of the territory of Imaile, county Wicklow, the head of one of the septs eligible to the kingdom of Leinster, and which maintained the privilege of electing the bishops and abbots of Glendalough, even for centuries after that see was united to Dublin. His father's principality was situated in the district of Wicklow, to which he was also attached in the maternal line ; his mother having been one of the O'Byrnes, a family equally re vered in the memory of their countrymen. In the depth of the romantic \" valley of the two lakes,\" which gave name to the See of Glendalough, and where the ruins of its little city and cathedral are still traceable, there was at this period one of those schools for which Ireland was justly celebrated: and within its walls the pious Laurence O'Toole imbibed the rudiments of his education. He was consecrated Archbishop of Dublin in 1162, at Christ Church, by Gelasius, Archbishop of Armagh, assisted by many bishops, the people offering up the thanksgiving of their hearts ; and from that period the custom of sending the bishops of the Irish cities which the Danes had occupied to Canterbury for consecration, was utterly discontinued. This excellent prelate devoted himself at an early age to a monastic life, the duties of which he discharged in a very exemplary manner. This laid the foundation for his future dignities. He was remarkable for his benevolence, for the"], [47, "Archbishop O'Toole (Lorcan O'TuathaV). 21 O'TuathaT) assigned to Christ Church (amongst se veral) the church of St. Begnet of Dalkey, with all its tithes, and his grant was further assured by letters patent from Prince John. The manorial rights and strictest chastity, for piety, temperance, hospitality, and, above all, for the love of his native country. Contrasted with the ser- vility of his interested cotemporaries of the sacred order in this re- spect, his patriotic and noble conduct appears in shining colours. In 1167 was held the general council of the archbishops and chieftains of Ireland at Athboy, to acknowledge the sovereignty of Roderic, and to consider the means of resisting the expected invasion of Dermod M'Murough's Welsh auxiliaries under Strong- bow. He assisted at the council, and firmly adhered to the inde- pendence of his country. Strongbow arrives \u2014 Dublin is besieged \u2014 the citizens, through the mediation of the Archbishop, treat for a surrender. During the negotiation the walls are scaled, and the city treacherously taken, with fearful carnage. In 1171, Hasculph, the late Danish governor of Dublin, arrived with thirty ships, and a strong and well-appointed force from the Isle of Man and the islands of the north. Archbishop O'Toole, on this occasion, considering that much national good might result from opposing the power of the new invaders by that of the old, became the most zealous in his appeals to the native princes to promote Hasculph's project ; and his devoted patriotism, and the sanctity of his character, gave great weight to his exhortations. The people rose in arms to his Call, collected all their strength, sur- rounded Dublin by land ; while the Dane occupied the harbour, and threatened the hitherto victorious Strongbow with total annihilation. From the height of the citadel he beheld with alarm the allied natives at last united in the defence of their country, and extend- ing their lines from sea to sea around him. Roderic was encamped at Castleknock, whence his army extended to the ancient town of Finglas ; O'Rourke and the petty princes of Ulster mingled their forces along the strand of Clontarf ; the Lord of Hy-Kinselagh occu- pied the opposite shores of Dalkey ; while the Chief of Thomond advanced so near as Kilmainham to the walls of the metropolis ; and even Archbishop Laurence communicated the inspiration of his character to this cause, and, gliding amidst the ranks of war, animated the several septs of his countrymen to the assertion of their common liberties. \u2014 Cambrensis Eversus, 1662. Within the city were Earl Strongbow, Maurice FitzGerald, Ray- mond le Gros (the Achilles of the invasion), Milo de Cogan, and some other chosen chieftains ; but their scanty soldiery bore a fearful comparison with the host that were to oppose them, and Strong bow, in the prudence of necessity, withheld them from an encounter that might but reveal their weakness. It was the crisis of Ireland's destinies, but her monarch was not equal to the emergency. For two mouths the closest blockade was maintained.

In 1200, the then Archbishop of Dublin had a grant of a Wednesday market here, and an annual fair, to be held to lead them against the enemy. The fearful state of FitzStephen in Wexford aggravated the despair of those within the city. Nego tiations with the Irish failed; a council was held, and it was resolved to sally forth on the besiegers. They sallied forth the following morning, and completely surprised the wing of Roderic's army - a merciless and miserable slaughter of the natives ensued. The victorious garrison returned, enriched with spoils and an ample store of provisions. Roderic himself narrowly escaped from the field ; the native princes fled ; the Danish allies retired. Has culph, however, was taken prisoner and executed. Strongbow marched to the relief of FitzStephen. (a) Thus, through fatal negligence and misconduct in the leaders, the powerful combination against the English invasion was crushed, and the relative situation of the contending forces, by the result of an almost hopeless but successful saUy, entirely reversed. Nevertheless, the patriotic Archbishop O'Toole exerted himself to revive the hopes of his countrymen, to animate them to continue the struggle, and to inspire them with hope and resolution in asserting the sacred cause of national independence. Meanwhile, Henry II. procured the Bull of Pope Adrian. In obedience to the papal injunction, the principal archbishops, bishops, abbots, and native chieftains, ever influenced by religion and devotion to the Holy See, tendered their allegiance to Henry. Thus was secured the annexation of Ireland to the crown of England, not by the right of actual conquest, but by voluntary submission to the will of the head of the Roman Catholic Church.

In 1273, his descendant, another Reginald, was summoned to attend a great council in Dublin, in right of this feod. In 1306, it appearing by the King's letters that the wines sent to him out of Ireland were bad, mixed, and for the greater part sour, an inquiry was instituted, on the oaths of merchants, as to the cause ; whereon they found that the wines in question were shipped about Michaelmas at Bordeaux, and were, after All Saints' Day, landed at Dalkey, whence they were re-shipped to \" Skynburness,\" but on the latter occasion were tossed about by tempests until the Epiphany, and then delivered in the state of de terioration complained of, but not arising from any adulteration or default of the mariners or merchants. 1323.

In the reigns of the Henrys and Edwards other penal laws were passed against the native Irish without the Pale, to compel them to change their names, and take English surnames. 1538.

' ' That the Irish clergy, as well as their brethren in England, occasionally exhibited mysteries and moralities previous to the reign of Henry VIII. , may be safely inferred from the following record preserved amongst the MSS. of Robert Ware : \u2014 \"Thomas FitzGerald, Earl of Kildare, and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, in the year 1528, was invited to a new play every day in Christmas, Arland Usher being then mayor, and Francis Herbert and John Squire, bailiffs ; wherein the tailors acted the part of Adam and Eve ; the shoemakers represented the story of Crispin and Crispianus ; the vintners acted Bacchus and his story ; the carpenters that of Joseph and Mary ; Vulcan and what was related to him was acted by the smiths ; and the comedy of Ceres, the goddess of corn, by the bakers. Their stage was erected on Hoggin -green (now called College-green), and on it the priors of St. John of Jerusalem, of the Blessed Trinity, and of All- Hallows, caused two plays to be acted ; the one representing the Passion of our Saviour, and the other the several deaths which the Apostles suffered. From this record (which is the first express mention that has occurred to me of the representations of mys teries and moralities in Ireland), it should seem that it was customary with the chief magistrates of Dublin to invite the Lord Lieutenant to a new play every day in Christmas ; and there fore, as I have already observed, it may inferred, that dramatic entertainments were exhibited in Ireland before this period. I have been informed that it was also formerly customary with the several corporations in Dublin, to invite the Chief Governor to a play at St. George's Chapel, on the anniversaries of their patron saints.\" \u2014 \"An Historical Essay on the Irish Stage,\" by Joseph C.

She afterwards had an iuterview with Queen Elizabeth, and made her peace with her. On her return to Ireland, her vessel lay for some time in the roads of Dalkey Port. She after wards landed in a little creek in Howth. She walked up to the castle, and found the gates shut (the family being at dinner). She soon discovered that the heir to the title was nursing not far off. She carried him on board ship, and immediately set sail, and arrived safe at Carrick-a-Owly ; nor did she return him until paid a large ransom as a punishment for Lord Howth's inhospi tality.

Dublin Bay at sunrise, and the graceful Killiney Bay at sunset, are Claudes, treasured in the cabinet of the memory, which neither accident can injure, nor beggary deprive me of. Nature has done much for this far-famed \" Beautiful Bay.\" She has disposed of some of the numerous objects of her creation in the most picturesque and artistic style, in decorating its gently sweeping and undulating shores. Edwin Hayes, R.A., the greatest marine painter that Ireland has ever produced, whose numerous art productions, sketched in calm, sunshine, and storm, in the Bay of Dublin, have been highly prized by the Royal Academy of London, be lieves that, for the artist and lover of nature, it possesses more real and ideal beauty, caused by the happy grouping of its charming accessories, than any other bay he ever sketched, either on the coasts of England, Scotland, France, Spain, or Holland. To him, in the days of his youth, it was a never-failing source of interest and beauty. Creswick, another marine painter, of European reputation, said that Dublin Bay, in an autumnal sunrise, was one of the finest prospects of nature that he had ever seen.

His recent work, \"The Home of the Sea Gull,\" has been much admired. t \"On Friday and Saturday some of the Clontarf fishermen went in pursuit of seals to Howth. They swam into the caves with lights, where the dams bring forth their young.

SECTION II. DALKEY \u2014 THE PURITY AND SALUBRITY OF ITS ATMOSPHERE \u2014 OPEN AIR FETES. The purity of the Dalkey air has, from the most remote times, been esteemed by the citizens of Dub lin. When this city was visited and wasted by a most remarkable plague in 1575, the terrified inhabitants, with one accord, rushed to Dalkey as to a sanctuary, a sure refuge against the awful visitation. An im mense camp was formed on the hills, on the shore, on the common, and also on Dalkey Island. On this occasion the grass grew in the streets of the deserted city. In the years 1704, 1705, and 1706, a virulent plague raged within the city, and again the citizens repaired to Dalkey, which preserved its ancient reputation undiminished. The canvas tents extended in every direction, music and amusement was the order of the day, and the fearful idea of the prevailing distemper was effec tually dispelled.* * For years Dalkey has been the favourite summer resort of all the leading medical men of Dublin, many of them having built handsome villas, foremost amongst whom stands Sir Dominic Cor rigan, Bart., the eminent physician, author, and naturalist, who has expended thousands in the formation of a small boat harbour and fish ponds at his charming residence, Inniscorrig. Surgeon Tuffnell has also done much for Sorrento, by the improvement he has of late effected at his house in that portion of Dalkey. It is also worthy of note, that not a single case of cholera occurred during the last visitation, save and except one, and that was a young man improperly sent in the last stage, it may be said, by his friends, out of Kingstown to die in Dalkey. Many people have lived to a great age in Dalkey. Dr. Parkinson had a few years ago under his charge three persons whose united ages amounted to 320 years. One was a superannuated pilot, named Pat, aged 105 ; he used to walk, up to a few weeks of his death, from Bullock to Dalkey every morning, to attend his devotions. The second was also an old pilot, well known as Red Bill ; he was over 100 when he died."], [71, "Modern Dalkey. 45 And now, at this day, what is the proud position of Dalkey ? Let the value of land for building purposes attest. The \" common \" covered with magnificent viUas and stately mansions ; the rocks themselves bear witness to the march of improvement and the ad vancing tide of civilization, supporting the noble and numerous structures wherein reside the wealthy citizens of our metropolis seeking health and relax ation in the pure air, amid the romantic and un rivalled scenery of the surrounding country. Nor was it in the fatal and disastrous event of pestilence alone that the citizens of Dublin availed themselves of this healthy and invigorating retreat. In the happy and merry days of the \" good old times,\" the rocks and dells of Dalkey common were, on fes tivals, and even ordinary week-days, crowded with numerous pic-nics and sod parties. The fashionable world of Dublin assembled there, and had their rural fetes (al fresco) on a magnificent scale.* The last, and perhaps the grandest, of these great The third was a woman called \" Mud Macklin ;\" she lived on Dalkey Hill, supported in her old age by an attached and grateful servant, who had served her mistress in better days. Mrs. Macklin reached the age of 114 before she died, and often told Dr. Parkinson strange stories of 17S2, when she entertained a large party of the Volunteers at her house, before the}7 marched into Dublin. * The Knight of lnnishowen, writing of Modern Dalkey in \" the season,\" says \u2014 \"There was music, too, in all directions, music afloat \u2014 fiddles, and flutes, aud cornopeans, and the voices of the merry boys and girls, rivalling each other in snatches, not from Tommy Moore, who is laid on the shelf, but from the Christy Minstrels, or the last opera ; music on the heights, where the ancient piper was enthroned, ' '\u00e6ria sub rupe, \" on a druidical dais of granite or gorse, in front of the coast-guard flagstaff, maintaining Ireland's pristine fame by giving, in his best style, the planxty that was played before Moses ; music on the shore from Cliff Castle to Cullamore, and thence to Milo Burke's well, the Khyber Pass, and Sorrento \u2014 from every villa and cottage around, where the sea bathing daughters of Eblana, coming hither with the swallows, aud departing with the fall of the leaf, resort to play in the hygienic waters half the day, and on their Bioadwoods half the night."], [72, "46 Music on the Waters \u2014 Irish Melodies, &c. open air fetes, was given by the Alexanders and the Armitts, and by the late highly esteemed and popular Commander of the Forces in Ireland, Sir Edward Blakeney, then Lieutenant-Colonel of the 18th Royal Irish Fusileers (at that time quartered in Dublin). On the morning of as beautiful a day in June as ever beamed, the inhabitants of the leading thorough fares of the city, and those along the road sides from Dublin to Dunleary, were surprised at the unusual crowds, continual and constant stream of open car riages of all kinds, conveying the youth and beauty of the aristocracy of the city to the chosen scene ; and when the fine band of the Fusileers, in their magni ficent full-dress uniforms of blue and gold, were seen to pass along on the same route, innumerable bodies of the middle classes of the city and eastern suburbs were hastily formed, and followed in their wake. At noon, not only the majority of the original and prin cipal party were assembled in a beautiful and exten sive green amphitheatre, surrounded by rocky and lofty cliffs, but these rocky eminences themselves were covered by a crowd of smaller parties, \u2014 tributary stars around the more splendid galaxy that occupied the centre of the brilliant scene. Two splendid marquees had been erected, one for the accommodation of the ladies, the other for the dinner party ; beautiful pleasure yachts, which con veyed a portion of the invited guests to the scene, lay at anchor in Dalkey Sound, and, with their white sails and coloured streamers, contributed their share of life and beauty to the attractive scene. Imagine what a fair and bright spectacle was pre sented, when the groups of quadrille dancers, the beauty and gallantry of the city and its vicinity, commenced their graceful movements on the green sward, to the exquisite music of one of the finest of military bands. What a delight to the happy multi-"], [73, "Irish Melodies 47 tude of spectators who beheld and admired the grace and tempered gaiety of high life ! The pencil of that accomplished painter, Watteau, in his finest pictures of the fetes champetre of the French, never pourtrayed a scene so exquisitely beautiful and romantic. Ere the sun had gone down on this charming tableau many of the company (including some first class amateur vocalists and performers) went aboard the gaily-dressed yachts lying at anchor in Dalkey Sound. The gentlemen sang with grand effect \" Anacreontic Moore's \" fine song \u2014 \" 'Tis when the cup is smiling before us, And we pledge round to hearts that are true, boys, true, That the sky of this life opens o'er us, And heaven gives a glimpse of its blue.

It is num bered among the ancient manors belonging to the"], [75, "Dalkey a Fortified Town. 49 Archbishopric of Dublin, was a place of considerable strength, but, at present, consists of the venerable remains of some old castles, the ruins of an ancient church, some good dwelling-houses, and about twenty cabins, for the most part occupied by poor labouring people, and serving indiscriminately for themselves, their cattle, and their swine. \" By the ruins, it appears the town was formerly defended by seven castles, and on the south by a moat or ditch, which is still open. The entrance to the west was through a gateway, secured by two castles, of which few or no traces remain. From various circumstances, I am inclined to believe that the east end was walled in, but it is now open on that side. The present road to the common leads directly through the town ; but the old one ran on the south, across some grounds long since converted into mea- dow ; but so tenacious are the inhabitants of the right of passing this way, that they usually carry their dead through the old road, although it is both an indirect and inconvenient passage to the church- yard. Upon these occasions, I am told, the meadow gates are thrown open, or, in case of obstruction, levelled with the ground. In my recollection, the street was so much incumbered with rocks, that it was absolutely impassable for carriages, and even a single horse must step from rock to rock, in continual danger of falling ; but these obstructions have been in part removed by cutting a carriage-way through the rocks, and smoothing the surface of the ground between them. One of the castles has been re- paired, and, by means of some additional buildings, converted into a commodious habitation. A second has been roofed, and affords room for a good billiard table. A third and fourth are inhabited by publi cans; indeed, the most antique and complete of the whole is occupied as a stable. A sixth, or rather the small remains of it, may be found in the walls of an ii"], [76, "Early History. \u2014 Henry II. \u2014 The Ostmen. 50 old cabin. And the seventh has been totally de molished a few years ago, merely for the sake of the stones. To illustrate this description, I have en closed a sketch of one of the castles, from a view taken by my ingenious friend, Mr. Beranger, who, with great industry and correctness, hath drawn a curious col lection of ruins, principally in the neighbourhood of Dublin, and means to have them engraven and made public, if suitable encouragement be not wanting. After diligent search and strict inquiry, no inscrip tion can be found to show by whom or when these castles were erected. A few years since, I am credibly informed, that a piece of oak timber, with some characters thereon, was discovered in one of them; but as no one that saw it could decipher the meaning, I presume it was soon converted into fuel. \" I shall, therefore, forbear entering into a minute discussion of their antiquity, but barely mention the conjectures of others, and submit tbe rest to your better judgment. These castles, in the opinion of some, were built in the reign of Henry II., to favour the landing of the English, who might be safely and speedily transported hither from Wales, whence, it is certain, the first adventurers were embarked for Ireland. Others suppose they were erected by the Ostmen or Danes, who, about the ninth century, either built or fortified the city of Dublin, ex tended their conquests on this side as far as Bray and the Wicklow mountains, and, at length, like a deluge, overspread the kingdom. \"At these periods of time, it is supposed the har bour of Dublin was not navigable for ships of burden, who might lie in the Sound of Dalkey, land either men or merchandizes on the common, and send them to the castles (which, perhaps, were then made use of as storehouses), where they could remain in secu rity from the depredations of the mountaineers"], [77, "Dalkey, its Fairs. \u2014 Interesting Associations. 51 until they were conveyed to Dublin, on the road to which are other castles built at proper distances, to insure their safety in the passage. What greatly strengthens this opinion is the remains of a very strong causeway, that runs across part of the com- mon, and was evidently calculated to facilitate the carriage of goods between the coast and the town. Certain it is, however, that Dalkey has been a con siderable landing-place between England and Ire land ; and even some of our chief governors, from time to time, have landed here ; particularly, Sir Edward Bellingham, in the reign of Edward VI. ; Sir Anthony St. Leger, in the reign of Queen Mary; Sir John Perrot,* in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and others. \" By an exemplification of some Acts of Parlia ment, passed in the 22nd year of Edward IV. (1482), and to be found in the Black Book of the Archbishop of Dublin, folio 242, it appears that, long before that time, the town of Dalkey could raise 200 men-in arms ; and seven fairs, besides weekly markets, were annually held here; and that the Bailiff had power to levy and receive, from all manner of wares and mer chandize coming and resorting for sale to said fairs and markets, such customs as were levied by the Mayor and Bailiff of the customs of Dublin, to be employed in walling and paving the town. \" Besides these castles, the ruins of the old church are not unworthy of notice. The belfry is Gothic and picturesque, the inside arch dividing the church from the chancel well executed, the east window in the antique style, and the baptismal font still there. By some old church records, it is learned that a clergyman was once presented for the cure of souls in this parish (now united to Monkstown and Killiney) at the yearly stipend of five pounds ; also, that, in * The couuties of Ulster were laid out by Sir John Perrot, A.D. 1584."], [78, "Dalkey Lodge \u2014 Romantic Prospects from. 52 the year 1641, John Wilson was vicar of Dalkey and Killiney, and lost his life by means of the re bellion. \" At the east end of the town, adjoining the com mon, is a summer lodge, belonging to Robert Barry, Esq. This house, being partly ancient and partly modern, makes but an indifferent appearance in front, where, having little or no prospect, the owner, perhaps not injudiciously, hath closed up most of the windows on that side. In the rear, indeed, it hath a pleasing and romantic view open to the sea, and a garden laid out with skill and taste, planted with a variety of fruit-trees, flowering shrubs, and ever greens, and decorated with busts, statues, and other ornaments. This house is united to one of the old castles, and contains, besides lesser apartments, a spacious parlour and dining-room, with circular bow windows, that open into the garden. In a neigh bouring castle, Mr. Barry hath erected the billiard table, already noticed. O]jposite the church, and near the centre of the town, is Dalkey House, of interest ing associations, the occasional retreat of Crosdaile Malony, Esq., who hath lately improved it with some additional offices; but the house itself is so unluckily situated, that it looks directly into the churchyard \u2014 a termination which, however disagreeable it may be to some, it must be confessed, we cannot too often or too seriously contemplate.

About a quarter of a mile dis tant from the common, the island of Dalkey, or, as it called in some old sea charts, the island of St. Bene dict, presents itself to view ; it contains, by estimation, twenty-one acres, and is esteemed a very good marsh for cattle. In the summer season it is grazed ; and in the winter, frequented by plenty of duck, teal, widgeon, and other fowds. This island is destitute of inhabitants and buildings, excepting- the remains of an old church, dedicated, I suppose, to the before mentioned St. Benedict. Here it may not be unen tertaining to mention, the reveries of some specula tive persons respecting this church and island. One supposes that the island was formerly united with the neighbouring coast, by an isthmus or neck of land, long since destroyed; a second, that it was the residence of some hermit, who caused the church to be built for the exercise of his private devotion ; a third, that it was erected for the accommodation of the principal inhabitants of Dublin, who retired hither when the city was visited by an extraordinary plague or pestilence ; and a fourth, that the clergy, by building this and other churches in places remote and difficult of access, thereby meant to inflame the devotion of their followers, and possibly to impose a penance, when they obliged them to frequent such obscure places of worship. Be that as it may, the island is now frequented only by parties who go out for fishing and pleasure, and sometimes land here for the purpose of dining and refreshment. \" Eastward of the island is a cluster of barren rocks,"], [81, "Bullock or \" Bloyke ;\" its Old Castle, &c. 55 well known by the name of the Muglins, among whose immense cavities large quantities of fish are taken.

Notwith standing the immense size and weight of this stone, it seems to have been raised from its former bed, and turned over on the contrary side, where it is sup ported by a few lesser ones. To what end or by what means it was placed in this elevated situation, is to me unknown ; but it is not improbable that it was raised in the times of paganism, by way of altar to offer sacrifices to the unknown deity. \"About half a mile north of Dalkey, stands Bullock, or rather Bloyke \u2014 i.e., the little bank \u2014 the former being only a corruption of its proper name ; and very likely it is, that the two great banks in the bay of Dublin, well known by the name of the North and South Bulls, were so called from a like corruption of their real one.

RESIDENCE, DALKEY CASTLE. [Established 1840.] INTERESTING DESCRIPTION BY WAKEMAN* OF DALKEY AND BULLOCK CASTLES. \" Dear Sir, \u2014 The following remarks upon the age and character of the Dalkey and Bullock castles, as coming from one who has carefully drawn, measured, and critically examined those most interesting re mains, may probably be acceptable to you at the present moment. You are quite at liberty to make any use you may think proper of my communica tion : \u2014 \" When no documentary evidence of the age of a structure can be obtained, it is generally possible, by a careful examination of the building, to deter mine the period to which the work should be assigned. In Ireland, our earliest structures, whether churches, towers, or castles, are almost invariably very plain in character ; but there is scarcely an ancient edifice in the country in which some attempt * Author of The Arch\u0153ologia Hibernica."], [97, "Bullock Castle \u2014 Pointed Doorways. 71 at ornament \u2014 a moulding or sculptured corbel, for instance\u2014 -does not occur. Now, from the eleventh century, down to the period of the Revolution of 1688, there was no century which did not possess a style of ornamentation more or less peculiar to itself. In the castles or tower houses of Dalkey, Bullock, Monkstown, Kilgobbin, Puck's Castle, and Shanganagh, all structures of the same, or nearly the same age, and exhibiting the same form of windows, mouldings, &c, we find in the arches and apertures a struggle between the semicircular and the earliest form of pointed arch head, for predominance. It is a fact well known to the architectural antiquary, that, towards the close of the twelfth century, the semicircular form of arch was very generally super seded by the first pointed or ' Gothic' True it is, that the older form of arch is found in buildings of almost any age of the Christian period in Ireland ; but it is equally true that the pointed arch head, formed of curved lines, does not, in one instance, occur as an original feature in any structure in Ire land older than the twelfth century. \" In the castles of Dalkey and Bullock, and more particularly in the latter, first pointed doorways, evidently original, are found side by side with others which have round or semicircular headings. This circumstance alone would indicate that tbe buildings cannot be older than about the middle of the twelfth century \u2014 a period to which the plain depressed moulding, which runs round the external angles of the small semicircular windows, would seem to point. The simple barrel-arch, which forms the vault at Bullock, Dalkey, and elsewhere, is also highly cha racteristic of the same age. A similar remark applies to the continuous rowof pointed archeswhich projected from the interior of the wall of the upper chamber of the Dalkey castle, now destroyed, and of which my sketch, taken more than twenty years ago, is a faithful"], [98, "Bullock Castle \u2014 13th Century. 72 representation. But of all the architectural evidences of the age of the buildings under notice remaining, a warrior's head, which standsoutfromthe south-western angle of the western tower of Bullock castle, at a con- siderable distance from the ground, is the most im- portant. This head is represented as protected by a conical helmet, without vizor, but furnished with a nasal or straight bar, which defended the front of the face, and particularly covered the nose of the wearer. There are numerous sculptural and pictorial authori- ties for assigning this curious carving to a period not later than A.D. 1200. Taken by itself, it might possibly be considered older ; but as the building to which it is an original appendage contains features, such as first pointed and other arches of the so-called 'Gothic' style, we cannot suppose that it can date much earlier than about the year 1160. One other little attempt at ornamentation worthy of notice, may be observed in the larger castle of Dalkey ; it is the arrangement in chevron fashion (on a line with the base of the tower parapet) of the stones of the chimney. This has a most decidedly twelfth-century look. \" The larger remaining structure at Dalkey is a strong quadrangular tower, measuring internally 29 feet 3 inches, by 19 feet. The thickness of the walls, which rest upon a solid rock, varies from about 8 feet to 5 feet C inches. There were originally three stories, to which access was gained by a rude stone stair, passing diagonally along the internal side of the wall from floor to floor. The first floor, which was of wood, has disappeared ; but provision for its supports remains. Off this is a little cham- ber, and passage which seems to have con- ducted to a garderobe. The second floor rests upon a strong barrel or semicircular arch of stone. Tbe third floor is of wood, and contains a staircase leading to the parapet, which is now quite plain, though indications of the old battlements or"], [99, "Dalkey Castle \u2014 Dr. Petrie's Residence. 73 ' corbie steps ' may still be traced. The original entrance, now stopped up, was on the ground floor, facing the sea. It is pointed, and was defended by a bartazan or projecting turret, commonly called, now and of old, a murthering-hole, projecting- from the top of the tower. The windows are small splayed open ings with flat or semicircular heads. It is an interest ing fact, that about sixty years ago this castle was, for one summer, the residence of the late lamented Dr. Petrie. \"The smaller remaining castle at Dalkey measures internally 22 feet 10 inches, by 13 feet. It was divided into two stories, of which the lower was timber, as the holes for rafters show. The second story forms a strong vault of stone. The wall of the tower which faces the road is seven feet in thick ness, and contains straight flights of steps, which lead from floor to floor, and to the battlemented parapet, from which a number of steps ascend to a watch-tower ; all the doorways and windows in this tower are either pointed, square-headed, or semi circular. The doorway is commanded by a murther ing-hole of the kind usually found in towers of the twelfth century. \" Bullock castle is an oblong building, originally two stories high, with towers of unequal height, and rising above the body of the structure at either end. The seaward tower, upon the ground-floor, contains the original doorway and inner porch. From the right hand side of the latter feature rises a spiral stair, communicating to the upper apartments, and to a series of small rooms in the same tower, which appear to have been bedrooms. Beneath, or through the opposite tower, is a round-headed gateway, lead ing into the spacious courtyard or bawn of the castle. The upper portion of this tower was divided by floors into small closets, probably bedrooms. The apartments between the towers are large, measuring L"], [100, "Puck's Castle, similar to the Dalkey Structures 74 23 feet 6 inches, by about 17 feet. The first and second stories were furnished each with an ample fireplace and spacious deeply-recessed windows, with round or rather semicircular-headed opes. The ground-floor is vaulted by a heavy barrel arch of stone. There is a garderobe to the first floor, and the whole of the upper walls are gracefully battle mented, in a style which is almost peculiar to Ire land. At an angle of the bawn or courtyard, may be seen a small watch-tower with similar finishings. \" Monkstown, Kilgobbin, Shanganagh, and Puck's castles scarcely come within the range of my obser vations, but I may say they display many features in common with the Dalkey structures. Monkstown and Puck's have suffered much from modern altera tions, but enough of their original work remains to indicate their character. My sketch of the Dalkey castle, now destroyed, was made about 1841, at which time the vault was used as a forge. It stood nearly opposite Mr. Connolly's bakery, as many people still residing in Dalkey remember. \" Yours very truly, \" W. F.

They would have come to England, of course, and given as good an account of it as the Romans or the Normans, considering the poor sticks, with scarcely a bit of British oak amongst them, that supported the Heptarchy in those days. Then, in due course, they would have crossed St. George's Channel, and looked in upon us where the Norman-Welsh (not the Sassenach) invaders landed. Ireland was strong enough in monasteries aud churches, the ' templa serena ' of the wisdom of the time, the highest type of the civilization of the middle ages, the vis conservatrix of the sublime and the beautiful of the old world, aud the pioneer of the intellectual wonders of the new.\" ' ' It was civilization worthy of the name, \" said the friar.

The Danes, whose com mercial enterprise equalled that of the Ph\u0153nicians, although they did not conduct their exchanges so regularly, and whose political economy was almost as hard-headed, and quite as hard-hearted, as that of the Whigs, estimated the value of Ireland's resources, as we can easily understand, by the number of settlements which they formed around her coast ; and amongst these the wealth of the Wicklow hills attracted their attention. The lords of the soil, how ever, those unfortunate O'Byrnes, O'Tooles, and Kavanaghs, who have been always giving trouble to their godfathers and godmothers, were just as uncivil to those highly enlightened and disinterested foreigners as they were afterwards to their Norman-Welsh visitors, although the former came under the auspices of the gods of Scan dinavia, preaching the divine religion of tbe sword, and the latter under the openly proclaimed and sacred sauction of two consecutive popes of Rome. It has been ever and always the vernacular blot and misfortune to show the cold shoulder, and too often the red hand, to those who came over to us for our mental and material improvement, knowing what was for our good in either case much better than we knew it ourselves, and treating them like filibusters, instead of receiving them as apostles of progress.\" \u2014 The Knight of lnnishowen. \" It is strange to say, that although the Danes and Ostmen held possession of Ireland for upwards of two centuries and a-half, it was never brought under the power of the Romans. Tacitus ( ' Vita Agricola ') says : \u2014 ' In his fifth voyage, taking his passage iu the first ship, by many successful battles he vanquished nations till then unknown, and planted garrisons in that part of Britain which lay opposite to Ireland ; and this he did rather from a motive of hope and fear, for Ireland being situated between Britain and Spain, and commodious also for the Gallick Sea, would unite the most powerful parts of the empire with a strong communication of interests. If it need be compared to Britain, it is less in compass, but larger than the islands in our seas. The soil and climate, nature and dispositions of the people, differ but little from those of Britain ; but the ports and havens that give admission into it, are better known by means of a more extensive commerce, and a greater resort of merchants. Agricola had received several of the petty princes of that nation, who had been driven out of it by some domestic sedition, and under colour of friendshipdetained them with him till an opportunity should present. I have often heard him say that Ireland might be subdued and brought under by one legion and moderate succours, and that it would be a great ad vantage against Britain, which then would be surrounded by the Roman arms, and the prospect of liberty removed out of sight.' Thus far Tacitus, from whose words Camden draws this conclu-"], [103, "The Commons of Dalkey. 77 sion, that numbers of people from Spain, Gaul, and Britain, had retired into Ireland to withdraw their necks from the Roman yoke. I must observe, that in England, France, and other countries the Roman arms aud inscriptions on marble, as so many miracles of antique workmanship, have been discovered, which were left there by the ancient Romans ; but in Irelaud none of these curi osities are to be seen, no, not so much as the Roman coin, unless such as has been brought into it from other parts, from whence one may conclude, with William of Neuburg, that Ireland has been inaccessible to the Roman arms, though they held the dominiou of the Orcades.\" \u2014 Sir James Ware's \"Antiquities of Ireland,\" p. 1S7.

Songs commemorative of a good day's sport are common in Ireland, and resemble the \" Kilruddery Hunt\" in enumerating the sportsmen, the ground run over, and the finale ; a jovial dinner, with sometimes the description of a will made by the dying animal. A specimen of one composed about the close of the seventeenth century, although sadly messed by an ignorant transcriber, has been preserved in the British Museum among the Sloane Manu scripts, No. 90U ; the \" Fingallian Hunting of the Hare,\" where the hospitality of St. Lawrence's Hall (Earl of Howth's) is commended, and the sportsmanlike qualifications of Michael St. Lawrence aud his companions are duly set forth, f Hark ! hark ! jolly sportsmen, awhile to my tale, Which to pay your attention I'm sure cannot fail ; 'Tis of lads, and of horses, and dogs that ne'er tire, O'er stone, walls and hedges, through dale, bog, and briar A pack of such hounds, and a set of such men, 'Tis a shrewd chauce if ever you meet with again : Had Nimrod, the mightiest of hunters, been there, 'Fore God, he had shook like an aspen for fear. * See Appendix. t In this song, the dying hare is thus made to settle her worldly affairs : ' ' But in a fine mead, she being almost spent, She made her last will, aye, aud testament.

Towards the close of the autumn of 1834, the inha bitants of Dalkey and the surrounding district, then rural in the extreme, became much interested and excited, on account of the rather singular dreams \u2014 \u25a0 a sort of emanation from mournful fancies \u2014 with which Etty Scott, of \" Dalkey Stone Common,\" had long been troubled.

Mr. O'Rorke is one of those shrewd Irishmen, of quick percep- tion aud great natural intelligence, who, in 1848, after Ireland had passed through a political fever and heart-rending famine, saw the immediate necessity of reforming and enlarging certain com- mercial dealings through the country. He then laid the first stone of his future success, working with perseverauce, unre- mitting industry, and self-reliance. While others were panic- stricken by the wail of sorrow and woe which went through the land, he grappled manfully with difficulties, and surmounted them with the most signal success. He saw the wants and neces- sities (commercially) which the country n quired. He created and fostered a home manufacture to supply those wants, successfully competing with England and Scotland in quality and price, thereby practically serving his native land.

Her rich brown hair clustered down her neck, and lay in massive curls upon her sunburnt bosom. To strangers, who met her while wandering across the hills to Rochestown and Shanganagh, her manners were shy and reserved ; to some of her companions, she was both affable and affectionate \u2014 yet, at times, she became silent and moodish. While the quarrymen colonists, with pipe aud dance, were amusing themselves after their daily toil, Etty spent her evenings reading romances and stories of the \" Scottish Borderers ;\" nevertheless, she was looked up to with respSct by the \"squatters\" of the com- mon and the good people of the village. In 1817, the first great powder-blast took place in the quar- ries of Dalkey, which now present the appearance of having been riven asunder by some earthquake or convulsion of nature. The granite stones taken from these immense chasms, have furnished the enormous amount of material for the construction of the Dun- leary aud Kingstown harbours \u2014 which occasioned tbe hills at the time to be somewhat abundantly peopled. By the aid of a simple combination of the mecha- nical powers \u2014 -principally a series of three inclined planes and three large metal wheels, each with a strong endless chain passing through a groove \u2014 one man was enabled to set in motion and control six trucks or carriages, aggregately bearing twenty five tons of granite \u2014a task which, on common roads, in the ordinary mode of draught, could not be accom plished with fewer than thirty-five horses. Etty Scott's father, an intelligent, shrewd man for his position in life, had the charge of one of those inclined"], [112, "The Long Rock and Strait of St. Benedict. 86 planes. Scott, amongst others, \" pitched his tent,\" \u2014 or rather constructed, for himself and Etty, a rude yet storm-proof cabin, consisting of three rooms, enclosed by a loose stone wall, totally unconscious of mortar, which encircled about a- third of an acre \u2014 on the commons, situated under \" Geraldine,\" the property of Mr. Patrick Byrne. Here, on a wet and stormy night, in the middle of October, 1834, the pastoral Joan of Arc of this wild district \u2014 then of as little value as the wide-spreading prairie of South America \u2014 the dreaming enthusiast, and indi rect prophetess of its future value and prosperity \u2014 Etty Scott, the quarryman's daughter, who for months had been weaving wild fancies in dreamland, first communicated the particulars of her vision of the rock near the seashore, where vast treasures were hid, to her father, his fellow-labourers, and their families, and also to the \" natives \" ef Dalkey, some of whom were fishermen, pilots, and humble traders. For weeks Etty's dream of there being immense quantities of gold concealed under the \" Long Rock,\" became the topic of general conversation. The granite-bound shore of the ancient strait of St. Benedict, where those beautiful mansions, \"Innis corrig,\" \" Elsinore,\" \"Lota,\" &c, now stand, sud denly became crowded with anxious and wealth seeking spectators. Etty's enthusiasm rose with public excitement. The fever of the anticipated gold find still increased. Her dreams were no longer looked upon as shadows ; they were daily becoming seeming realities, which would make an El Dorado of her adopted home \u2014 Dalkey, the \" Port of the Seven Castles.\" ETTY SCOTT, THE BEAUTIFUL DREAMER OF SECRETED TREASURES. ' Thou art like the depths where the seas have birth, Rich in the wealth that is lost from earth \u2014 A 11 the sere flowers of our days gone by, And the buried gems in thy bosom lie."], [113, "Etty Scott's Prophecy. 87 \" Yes, thou art like those dim sea caves A realm of treasures, a realm of graves ! And the shapes through thy mysteries that come and go, Are of wealth and terror, of power and woe \" The gold-dreamer's manner to the villagers and people of the hills became importunate and demon strative. Ballads were written and sung through the streets, in which the name of our heroine was freely introduced. In the meantime, Pat Byrne, an honest dairyman, and well-known opponent to the general union and partnership milk-and-water com pany, who owned the \" Long Rock,\" not by lease \u2014 for leases were unknown in Dalkey in these days \u2014 became seized with the treasure epidemic, and believed himself the Monte Christo of the place \u2014 and rale \" King of Dalkey.\" At the suggestion of Etty, a preliminary meeting was held on the \" common,\" a council of goldfinders formed, money liberally sub \u25a0 scribed to purchase tools, powder, torches, &c, \u2014 she again, in the most solemn manner, repeating her dreams and vision. Riches, immense riches, promised \u2014 faithfully promised, to her followers, who strictly attended to her instructions, in accordance with the spirit of her dreams. Her commanding and well proportioned figure, dark flashing eye, dishevelled hair, and earnest manner, surrounded by a set of believers in her prophetic power, each carrying a torch previous to their taking possession of the \" Rock,\" over which ceremony she was to preside, formed an ensemble worthy of the pencil of a great artist. This youthful \"Meg Merrilies\" of Dalkey Common became awe-inspiring, while, with a deep toned voice, she exhorted them \u2014 \"WATCH WELL -WORK WITH ENERGY! BUT, ABOVE ALL, BELIEVE IN MY DREAM, AND BE SILENT AS THE GRAVE WHILE WORKING.

They became absolute slaves to her \" golden councils \"- \u2014 they forsook their legitimate employment in the quarries, and blindly yoked them selves to the rude chariot of a peasant girl's romantic and excited enthusiasm. She was, for the time, queen of all she surveyed. Large sums of money were spent in blasting-powder and flambeaux. Never did men work with such energy for twelve hours a day, in strict accordance with Etty's mysterious in junctions.

During Etty's exhortations to the people, and while the miners were blasting the rocks by the ton weight, she was never known to smile. This solemn mien of hers gave additional zest and interest to the whole proceedings. The group of workmen presented at times a most picturesque appearance. The ringing of the ham mers on the boring irons ; the blazing torches stuck even churches or the shrines of the saints, which were then im mensely rich, and abounded with costly ornaments of gold and silver.

This novel scene was repeated night after night, and day after day, in the presence of thousands of people, many of whom, in cluding my intelligent cicerone, Mr. Pat Byrne, are now alive to tell the tale. Facts are stubborn things, and \" Truth is stranger than fiction.\" A month passed away, and still no treasure met the miners' anxious gaze, or the wistful look of the Dalkey gold-dreamer. She still entreated them to persevere \u2014 that their hour of triumph was at hand, when their efforts would be crowned with the most signal success. \" All went merry as a marriage bell,\" up to this period. Alas ! a change shortly came o'er the spirit of poor Etty's dream. One dark evening, in the midst of the gold excitement, a number of persons met in Mr. P. Byrne's garden, Castle-street, Dalkey \u2014 then a great resort for the Dublin and Dunleary folk. A few medical students formed a conspiracy to ruin Etty's long-cherished hopes. Two black cats, brought from Dublin, were produced ; long cords were attached to their tales, to which were fastened several sponges, saturated with spirits of wine and turpentine ; while their bodies were rubbed with dry phosphorus, which occasioned no pain.

The cats were silently unbagged in a recess \u2014 the matches applied to the sponges. In a few minutes, strange spectral visions presented themselves in the sur rounding darkness, springing and flying from rock to rock, in all directions. The miners stood aghast in groups, when the full diapason of feline screams and mewlingswere echoed through the night. They felt as if they were invited to revel with the hideous ghoul of the place. Fear, intense fear, took pos session of all presents \u2014 save Etty. The workmen and spectators fled in all directions. The joke was soon discovered \u2014 loud laughter resounded from all quar ters \u2014 Etty, the gold-dreamer of Dalkey's wild com mons, went home to her rude cottage, and dreamed again : \u2014 On her parted lips there's a quivering thrill, As on a lyre ere its chords are still ; On the long black lashes that fringe her eye, There's a large tear gathering heavily \u2014 A rain from the clouds of her spirit press' d ; Sorrowful Etty ! this is not rest !\" The broken-hearted gold-dreamer of Dalkey sickened and died ; but not before she saw her dream of the \" Long Rock \" partly fulfilled. In a few months after this remarkable and exciting scene, thousands of pounds (paid to the squatters in gold) were expended, by persons who had been brought by curiosity to Dalkey, in purchasing the little patches of land, some of it perched on beetling rocks, from those squatters and natives who subscribed to Etty's dream, and worked and lost their time on her vision of the Long Rock. One of the most indefatigable of Etty's miners was Pat Kavanagh, alias Ali Baba.

He died a few years ago, in the service of the talented and much-respected Dr. Par kinson, of Tudor Hall, whose private worth and bene volence is only exceeded by his innate desire to do good to all who may come within the circle of his professional duties. A DALKEY LAND-ACQUIRING MANIA IMMEDIATELY SUCCEEDED THE GOLD FEVER. The late Mr. Martin Burke was the first in the field. He not only purchased the most desirable sites facing the Coolamore, but actually rented Dalkey Island from the Government, which, it is to be hoped, will yet be the property of the Commissioners. Pat Byrne, one of Etty's miners, sold the Long Rock for a very considerable sum. On it is built \"Lota,\" \"Elsinore,\" and \"Inniscorrig.\"* J. Molloy, another of Etty's miners, sold his place at a high figure. It contained part of Mr. Leslie's beautiful lawn, and the ground where Loretto Abbey stands, which was purchased by the late Judge Ball's sister, for \u00a3700. The Briens (Etty's miners) sold their place, on which Knockallen stands. The Denisses (Etty's miners) sold their place, on which Tempe-terrace stands. Edward Neil, one of Etty's miners, and Michael Brien, sold their place, on which Prince Patrick's terrace stands.

The following picture of the exquisite scene that bursts upon the view as the train rushes through the tunnel at Dalkey, is given in a poem by Denis Florence M'Carthy, called \"Spring Flowers from Ireland,\" which appeared in the Dublin University Magazine for May, 1865. Of this poem, one of the many uncol lected pieces of the author, a distinguished living writer, himself an eminent poet, has written : \u2014 \"The lore of our native land has never been expressed with finer feeling, or with a finer handling, than in this poem.\" We extract a few stanzas, which refer directly to our subject. The poet, writing from abroad, has a home-sick vision of the many beautiful scenes that adorn his native land. The Pass of Keimaneigh, the scene of his \" Alice and Una,\" and the Arbutus Islands of Killarney, glide as in a panorama before his eyes ; and he then proceeds to his favourite \" Vale of Shan ganagh \" : \u2014 I see the long and lone defiles Of Keimaneigh's bold rocks uphurled ; I see the golden-fruited isles That gem the queen-lakes of the world ; I see \u2014 a gladder sight to me \u2014 By soft Shanganagh's silver strand, The breaking of a sapphire sea Upon the golden -fretted sand. \" Swiftly the tunnel's rock-hewn pass, Swiftly the fiery train runs through ; Oh, what a glittering sheet of glass !

Dalkey Church, the ruins of which are situated under the shadow of the most perfect of the old castles, has been known by the title of St. Bonett, St. Boneis, St. Begnet, St. Bennett, and St. Benedict.

St. Jerome incontestably proves that there were Christian churches in Ireland in the fourth cen tury ; and in the \" Annals of the Four Masters,\" in the year 650, we are told that \" St. Beraid, Abbot of Dublin, died that year.\" From this it appears there was a monastery church established in Dublin at an early period, although, like Dalkey and Killiney churches, not mentioned in the \" Monasticon Hiber nicum.\" Dr. Petrie attributes the church at Killiney to the fifth century \u2014 a primitive Christian temple, at present in \" ruinous perfection.\" This great Irish scholar often expressed a wish to be buried near this ruin, where the first beams of the morning sun would rest on his grave. He had a profound veneration for this place. Here, in the winter months, the night- wind shakes with solemn effect the ivied tapestry which drapes this ancient church. The following interesting details of Killiney Church * In Dr. Hanmer's \" Ancient Chronicles of Ireland,\" it is stated that \" the Abbey of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Dublin (Mary's Abbey) was founded by the Danes, iu the year 948.\" \"These people, on their first conversion to the Christian faith, most probably constructed their churches after the manner of the Irish ; but their connexion with their countrymen in Britain brought them acquainted with the new method of building; and masons were brought over to construct their sacred edifices in the Norman or Gothic fashion : whence Christ Church, in 1038, and St. Patrick's, in 1190 ; the Cathedral of Waterford, about 1100 ; that of Limerick, in 1170 ; and Cork, about the same period, were the first Gothic buildings Ireland saw.\u2014 Ware's ' Bishops ;' Harris' 'Dublin.'

Its extreme dimensions upon the interior are thirty-five feet, the nave measures but twelve feet and eight inches, and the chancel nine feet and six inches in breadth. The church originally consisted of a simple nave and choir, lighted in the usual manner, and connected by a semi circular arch ; but at a period long subsequent to its original foundation, an addition, the architecture of which it will be well to compare with that of the more ancient building, has been made on the northern side. The original doorway, which, as usual, is placed in the centre of the west gable, is remarkable for having a cross sculptured upon the under part of its lintel. It measures in height six feet, and one inch, in breadth at the top two feet, and at the bottom two feet four inches. The next feature to be noticed is the choir arch. This, which may be looked upon as a most characteristic example of its class, measures in breadth, where the arch begins to spring, four feet seven inches, and at the base four feet ten inches and a-half ; its height is onlysix feet and a-half. The chancel windows display the inclined sides, so indicative of antiquity when found in Irish ecclesiastical remains ; but, with the exception of that facing the east, they are in a state of great dilapidation. The eastern window is spear-headed both within and without, and exhibits the usual splay. The comparatively modern addition on the northern side of the nave, which appears to have been erected as a kind of aisle, is connected with tbe ancient church byseveral openings broken through the north side- wall.

In reading over the lives of men distinguished in arts, arms, literature, &c, we feel great pleasure in a memoir where we can trace, during the progressive course from childhood to maturity, that development of talent which so strongly indicates future ex cellence. Reflecting on this subject, I have been in duced to submit an account of a poet, one of the greatest his country has ever produced. If to have known him from his birth, and to have witnessed those early effusions of genius which surprised and delighted his friends, may qualify me for the task, why, then, I think, I may attempt it without incur ring the imputation of vanity. I had the pleasure of knowing his parents from the time of their marriage ; so that I had frequent opportunities of seeing my young friend after his probationary state of infancy, when introduced to visitors. At three years old he was an entertaining little fellow, with his childish prattle, which he commenced with in clambering up my knee. When seated there, we began to converse. I have often been astonished at his intellectual dis course ; but at five years his mind expanded to a de gree unparalleled by any child that ever came under my observation. So matured was he at that period,. he threw aside all child's play, toys, &c, and clinging to me with earnest entreaty to recite passages from Shakspeare, which sometimes I indulged in, and which he attended to with all the patient endurance of a sage, and entered so fully into the subject, that I was induced, at his own request, to give him in structions in some speech for his recital. He chose Hamlet's soliloquy on his mother's marriage \u2014 he soon got perfect in the words, and (with such tuition only as I was capable of giving) he spoke that beautiful and difficult speech before a large party of friends at my house. The astonishment and pleasure"], [128, "Samuel Whyte, Moores Tutor. 102 enjoyed by the whole party were fully evinced by the most unqualified approbation. He was then under six years of age ; and such discrimination, taste, and ability, as he exhibited, would have done credit to any young man. Had his parents, like Master Betty's, been induced to lead him on to that pursuit, we should not have pronounced that young Roscius such a wonder, for he was more than double the age of Master Moore at his debut. I next recognized him at the celebrated English school, under Mr. Samuel Whyte, from whom the late R. B. Sheridan had received his lessons of elocu tion. Under Mr. Whyte's tuition, my little friend became a perfect prodigy \u2014 he bore off all the pre miums at examinations, and was caressed by the auditors, amongst whom were persons of the first note. When Moore arrived at his twelfth year, he was a finished speaker. At that period I had a private performance \u2014 Henry the Fourth \u2014 at my house, to which I invited all my friends. Young Moore performed Prince John of Lancaster in a manner so easy and natural, we could have wished the part longer, to have enjoyed more of his interest ing performance. After the play, he spoke the poem of the Old Man and his Ass with great point and humour; so that he shone conspicuously, and gave further proof that the stage would have been graced by his persona] exertions, had he turned his thoughts to that profession. His genius, however, led him to poetry, and he commenced writing his little songs. I had the good fortune to witness the first efforts of his pen, and often saw those young ladies, his models, who presented that variety of character which he painted with such truth of nature in those matchless ballads. Every one was a faithful portrait. There was a young gentleman, Wesley Doyle, who fre quented Mrs. Moore's evening parties at that period. fie had a sweet voice, fine taste for singing and"], [129, "Trinity College Historical Debating Society. 103 accompaniments, having been cultivated in music by his father, Dr. Doyle, a celebrated musical professor. This young Doyle sang our poet's labours in succes sion, as delivered from the muse in his peculiarly sweet manner. It was truly a delectable treat to witness the united efforts of those highly-talented young aspirants ; no such entertainment could be had, even in the highest circles. Our young hero's next display was in Trinity College, Dublin, where he entered as a pensioner. The Historical Debating Society was then in full health and vigour. Young Moore, in his first speech, made an impression on the auditors that engaged their attention, and struck deeper at every successive debate. He invited me to his rooms, in College, to hear him and his fellow-students at rehearsal ; their compositions were exceedingly clever, but my friend had the best, and his delivery was easy and natural, much superior to any that competed with him \u2014 his speeches had all the effect of extemporary effusions. Near the period of 1798, Trinity College was dis turbed in its internal management by the insidious arts of spies and informers, who never stopped at any charge that promised reward ; lies and calumny were more current than truth. They reported that several students bad been sworn United Irishmen. To ascertain the credit that was to be given to this vile information, Lord Chancellor Clare held a scru tiny at the college, and examined the students him self, as patron or guardian. In the course of this inquiry young Moore was questioned : his answer was so prompt and ingenuous, that Lord Clare was satisfied he was clear of imputation ; but there was strong reason to believe some of his fellow-students were guilty, and he desired to know from him what he knew of them as regarded the accusation against them. Moore hesitated to give an answer to that"], [130, "104 Lord Chancellor Clare. peremptory demand of his lordship, upon which Lord Clare repeated the question : then our young friend made such an appeal as caused his lordship to relax, rigid and austere as he was. The words I cannot exactly remember ; the substance was as fol lows: \u2014 that he entered college to receive the education of a scholar and a gentleman; that he knew not how to compromise these characters by blowing upon his college companions ; that he had not a single associate that, so far as he knew, he could not acquit; and that he felt his own speeches in the debating society had been ill-construed, when the worst that could be said of them was, if truth had been spoken, that they were patriotic ; that he had always been taught to believe patriotism a virtue, not a crime ; then how could he venture to speak of the character of another, when he could not defend his own from the tongue of calumny ; that he was aware of the high-minded nobleman he had the honour of appealing to, and if his lordship could for a moment condescend to step from his high station and place himself in his situation, then say how he would act under such circumstances, it should be his guidance. Lord Clare passed him, and proceeded with the inquiry ; some were expelled ; and, sad to say, the debating society was put down. Thus that monster, rebellion, destroyed the finest school of oratory that was then known in Europe, where some of the brightest ornaments in eloquence were matured and polished ; the effect has been felt by parliament, the bar, the pulpit, and the stage ; for such a dearth of talent have we to deplore as we never felt since the origin of that society until its suppression.

I can- not, however, close this memoir without offering him my most grateful return for all the pleasure afforded me by his fascinating powers ; but not to these alone am I indebted to him \u2014 to his patronage in my pro- fessional life, both as a portrait-painter and actor : his influential power was considerable with persons of the highest fashion, and he exerted that power for me with the zeal of an ardent friend ; nay, he voluntarily wrote an article in one of the Dublin periodicals, defending my going on the stage, and eulogising my performance. Until the present opportunity, I had no public way of making my acknowledgment ; and I could not get forward with my view of Irish times, characters, &c, if I had not selected, at an early part of my work, those nearest my heart. I am, therefore, proud to have it in my power to select Anacreon Moore as one of my coun try's brightest ornaments ; \u2014 a splendid poet, a vir tuous patriot, a sincere and indefatigable patron and friend.

Lord Barymore left a fine house at Castle Lyons, county of Cork, formerly called Castle Lehan, on the foundation of O'Lehan's castle. In throwing down some of the old walls of the castle, a chimney-piece was discovered with the following inscription, \"Lehan O'Cullone hoc fecit, MCIIIL,\" which proves that stone buildings were much earlier in Ireland than some modern antiquarians allow them to have been. Those holy men who built, our early Christian churches, and preached the Gospel of Christ through out the entire of the country, obtained the name of the \" Island of Saints \" for Ireland. Their actions, together with the times wherein they flourished, may be read in \" The History of the Bishops, &c, of Ireland.\" Our ancestors were deep in learning, pious in their religion, wise in their institutions, just in their laws, and continued for many ages the most generous and valiant people that ever lived upon the face of the earth.

Twenty thousand men embarked, in 1854, at this place for an arid peninsula in the remotest extre mity of the Black Sea, where they and their French allies wrote a new page in the history of Europe, on the battle-fields of the Alma, Balaklava, and Inkerman, and by the storming and fall of the for tress of Sebastopol. The Grande Armee Irlandais (then stationed in this country) sailed from this pier for the Crimea, full of strength, full of life and hope for the future, full of heroism, proud of their past victories, so richly emblazoned on their colours, yet leaving many a mournful and saddened heart behind. \" Ec\u0153tivard, Ho!\" was the watchword and reply on this pier for upwards of two years.

He was now about to leave, in utter prostration, his physical powers wholly exhausted. This reflection affected and deeply moved an affectionate and warm-hearted people. They were sensible of their own great loss, yet deeply lamented tbe sad and afflicting cause ; their sorrow ing hearts sympathized with the sufferings of their friend and noble benefactor. An immense concourse were assembled to bid their esteemed Viceroy farewell \u2014 a fond, and as it proved, a last farewell. The vast assemblage poured forth humble blessings upon him, and fervent hopes for his recovery, and that he would soon return, to assume again the office of Viceroy, with renewed health and vigour. How overpowering must have been the emotions \u2014 what mingled feelings of sorrow, pride, and pleasure, must have pervaded the mind of Lord Carlisle at this, the closing scene of his bright, official career ! His natural display of feeling on this affecting and memorable occasion, was felt to be no indication of physical weakness, but rather the farewell of tender regard.

Sir Robert Peel, speaking of the loss of Lord Car- lisle, and his departure, well and vividly describes the interesting scene : \u2014 \" I do venture to say, that never did a man leave the shores of Ireland towards whom a deeper regret at the affliction which had befallen him was felt, than towards Lord Carlisle. I do not know if I may observe on one particular fact connected with his departure ; but I would venture to say, that there was no person who witnessed the departure of Lord Carlisle from the shores of Ireland who was not affected at the spectacle that was presented. Crowds of people were assembled in Kingstown, in silent re- gret, to wish him good-bye ; and I have been told, when my gallant friend, the Commander-in-Chief, advanced to bid him a last good-bye, and when he took his hand and grasped it for a few minutes, and said, ' God bless you, Sir !' I do believe \u2014 that there was not a dry eye in the crowded assembly that was there to wish Lord Carlisle farewell. He stood till the last moment on the deck of the vessel ; and, as it was leaving the shore, he cast a long, lin gering look behind him at that country where he had spent almost the whole of his public life, and where his public services had been given. Many a person in that assembly must have recollected those touching lines of Moore, where he says : \u2014 \" ' As slow our ship her foamy track Against the wind was cleaving, Her trembling pennant still looked back To that dear isle 'twas leaving :"], [151, "Extract from Sir Robert Peel's Speech. 123 So loth we part from all we love, From all the links that bind us ; So turn our hearts, where'er we rove, On those we've left behind us.' \" So parted the noble lord, amidst the regrets of the citizens of Dublin, of the people of Ireland, and their yearning for his return.

KINGSTOWN HARBOUR. The quarries of Dalkey supplied the granite* for the construction of the piers of this harbour, the first stone of which was laid in 1817, by Lord Whitworth, then Viceroy of Ireland. The East Pier stretches out into the Bay of Dublin 2,800 feet : \u2014 it affords a most charming promenade, particularly to convales cents who may require the invigorating sea breeze. A monument is erected on this Pier in memory of the heroic and intrepid Captain Boyd, who with a number of seamen of the \"Ajax\" lost their own lives while nobly trying to save the lives of others in a fearful storm, February 9th, 1861. He after wards had a public funeral, and was buried in St Patrick's Cathedral, 1st of March, 1861. The author who was present at Kingstown during this memorable storm, addressed several letters to the public journals on the sad and painful event.

The first body was found at half-past two o'clock. On searching through the rocks near the debris of the wreck in company with Mr Charles Nichollsthe well-known artist,and a sailor boy, we dis covered the body of an old man, closely held between the rocks, entangled in the cordage and a remnant of the sails of the ill-fated vessel. He was evidently at the helm when she struck, having the remains of a seacoat and large boots attached to his person, whilst his comrades, who were afterwards found, were nearly naked. We extricated the body with much difficulty from the wreck and rock work, placed it on the path way of the pier, composed the limbs, and covered the face (which had been bleeding from a severe- con tusion) with his woollen tie. During the recent gales on the coast of England we were told that tie entire fishing, seafaring, and naval population of the villages turned out and lined the coast and head lands anxiously watching to see if they could render any assistance to vessels in distress. Was such the case this day at Kingstown ? Certainly not. It was a matter of much surprise to those gentlemen pre sent that, out of the large nautical population of this rising town, there were only two men present who lent an assisting hand to recover the bodies of those who perished in the cause of mercy. At twelve o'clock a ship was seen in distress surging in towards the rock-bound coast where poor Boyd met his death. The moments were anxious and terrible. She was already given up as lost. The wind veered a point, the vessel answered her helm, and with a yard or so of canvas she drifted into the harbour.

His sympathies were awakened, and true and heartfelt sorrow was depicted on his countenance when he found that his gallant and pure-minded friend, Captain Boyd, was no more. A highly intelligent seafaring man explained the morning's disasters to his Excellency, who stood within a few yards of the dead body of an aged sea man, \u2014 made further inquiries relative to the melan choly incident, and shortly afterwards took his de parture. The Eastern Pier is again left in comparative loneliness, the tide is on the rise, and the storm as boisterous as ever. A carriage approaches the scene - \u2014 a lady, closely muffled \u2014 the wife of Captain Boyd, of the Ajax \u2014 steps out ; the boat of the Ajax is hailed; she enters \u2014 her heart \" with silent grief oppressed ;\" and as the boat puts oft* for the ship of mourning, exclaims, with mingled feelings of hope and anguish, \" He cannot be lost, and, through the mercy of God, he will surely return.\" We had at this time occasion to visit Kingstown to change our clothes, which were completely saturated with rain, sleet, and seawater; at the corner of George's-street a group of idle men were \" stopping the way,\" scarcely a mile from a scene of misery, where the least of them conld have been of use.

We again searched among the rocks and found a leg with a good boot and neat sock, protruding from, a crevice, upheaved granite rocks concealing the remainder of the body. We immediately gave the alarm, thinking at the time it was Captain Boyd's body. A messenger was at once despatched to procure the attendance of the men of the \" Ajax,\" who quickly came to the place, the body was extricated with the greatest possible difficulty from under the huge mass of rock-work, which must have been dashed about like small pebbles on the shore. It was found to be poor Curry, one of the finest and hand somest men in her Majesty's navy. The scene was truly heartrending when the men recognised their ship-mate, who left the \" Ajax \" that morning in the prime of life and manly heart, to lend a willing hand with his beloved c aptain in the cause of mercy. Curry's features were beautiful, even in death. Those honest, brave, and affectionate tars bore him on their shoulders, nearly a mile to the admiralty yard, which had now presented the appear ance of a morgue. They had some refreshment, and afterwards returned in sorrow to the frigate.

On Saturday, October the 4th, 1834, the first trial of the steam engine \" Vauxhall,\" with a small train of carriages filled with ladies and gentlemen, was made on this railway from Dublin to the Martello Tower at Williarastown. Large crowds of people were assembled at various points to witness the passing of the engine. The experiment is said to have given great satisfaction, not only as to the rapi dity of motion, ease of conveyance, and facility of stopping, but the celerity and quickness with which the train passed (by means of the crossings) from one line of road to another. The distance \u2014 about two miles and a-half \u2014 was performed four times each way, at the rate of about thirty-one miles per hour. The control over the machinery was complete, the stopping and reversing the motion was effected without a moment's delay. On the 9th of October, 1834, a train of carriages, crowded with ladies and gentlemen, proceeded the entire length of the line from the station-house at Westland-row to Salthill. There were eight car riages attached to the train ; one of the first class, three second, and four of the third class.

But many causes have concurred in re quiring a continual change in the transverse sections of the railway, which have, certainly, greatly added to the novelty and interest of the work, though, at the same time, difficulties have been increased, and expenses augmented far beyond what has ever been required to form a level passage through the most dif ficult districts where railways have been introduced. Among those causes may be enumerated the ex pediency of penetrating deeply into the centre of the metropolis ; the attention requisite to be paid to pub lic safety, and to vested and incorporated rights ; the great value of the property, whether as building sites or suburban grounds ; the interposition of secluded demesnes ; the preservation of the bathing, boating, and other accommodations of individuals, and of the public along the coast; the necessity of making the course of the road as direct as possible, and of con necting the several changes of direction by easy curves ; the caution to be exercised in tracing a complete and isolated route for the peculiar machines to be employed (through the rich and populous district in the vicinity of a large commercial city), to a termination on the quays of the finest artificial harbour in the world \u2014 where the smallest nautical conveniences had to be preserved from interference,"], [163, "The Kingstown and Holyhead Mail Service. 135 or to be amply compensated for and replaced \u2014 close to the streets of a rising and populous borough, the conveniences and even the apprehensions of whose inhabitants had to be consulted.

It is put on board the packet at the Pigeon-house Dock. If the wind blow fresh from the east, or north-east, the packet cannot sail ; and thus an entire tide, some times two tides, or twenty-four hours, are lost. If the wind happens to blow fresh from the north at neap tides, the packet is sometimes neaped in the dock, as happened last summer, and, therefore, cannot sail; all this to the very great injury of trade. When the packet sails, unless the wind be to the westward, she has considerable difficulty in working out, to the great loss of time.

When the mail returns to Holy- head, nearly the same delays arise there again, (for that also is a tide harbour,) so that, taking the average, a letter written from Dublin to London is in general not answered in less than a week ; but, supposing the packet to lie and take in the mail at the Sound of Ireland's Eye, the mail would then be despatched at a certain hour every night, for the packet could sail at any given hour, and with any wind that blows, and could go out in weather that she could not work out in from the Pigeon-house Dock, and in fifteen minutes from the time the mail is put on board, she would be completely at sea, lying her course. When the mail arrives at Holy- head, if, instead of sending it across two ferries to Chester, it were sent from Bangor ferry, along Lord Penryn's road, coming out at the head of the valley of Llanroost, to Shrewsbury, by paying a little attention to shortening the road through Anglesea, and finishing Lord Penryn's road about four miles, the distance might be shortened by twenty-four miles.

LORD CLONMEL \u2014 THE SHAM SQUIRE AND MAGEE \u2014 \"TEMPLE HILL\" (OTHERWISE FIAT HILL) \u2014 MAGEE's FETE AND PIG HUNT. At Dunleary is \" Temple Hill,\" once the favourite country seat of Chief Justice Clonmel, a personal friend of Mr. J. Fitzpatrick's immortal \"Sham Squire,\" where the highly popular journalist, Magee of the Dublin Evening Post, got up his celebrated \"Olympic Pig Hunts,\" &c, to worry his enemy, Lord Earlsfort, afterwards Earl of Clonmel, of Irish lettres de cachet notoriety. The Sham Squire and Chief Justice Clonmel were chums in early life, and the judge constantly went out of his way on the bench to decide unconstitu tionally in favour of Higgins, and to the prejudice of Magee of the Evening Post, who, with a courage"], [168, "140 Fete on Fiat Hill {Temple Hill) \u2014 Dunleary. unapproached, denounced the dark doings and the pernicious influence of the Sham Squire, to whom it really seemed the country was bowing down as to Baal. Higgins put Magee in dungeons on successive fiats of Lord Clonmel ; but when he regained his liberty, on enormous bail, he resolved in turn to be revenged on the chief justice, who lived at Temple Hill, Monks town, now the seat of Robert Gray, Esq. It was magnificently planted and laid out in costly pleasure grounds. Magee hired the fields adjoining, where he advertised foot-races, ball-kicking, running in sacks, and pursuing pigs with soaped tails, which were to become the property of the winner. A fine fat boar was christened Shamado, and other pigs, wearing wigs of different forms and hue, were known to personate Lord Clonmel, Daly, and others of that clique. Eight thousand people assembled, the great bulk of whom were supplied with porter by Magee. The pigs having been let loose, burst through the fences into Lord Clonmel's pleasure grounds, followed by the mob, who utterly destroyed its beauty, on which the chief justice expended several thousand pounds, and many an hour of his precious time in superintending. The following is a copy of the original placard in which Magee announces to the citizens of Dublin, washed and unwashed, the forthcoming fetes at Fiat Hill. The intimation that this festivity was in honour of the birth of George, Prince of Wales, was an ingenious pretext, framed by legal advice, with the object of averting renewed strokes of vengeance from \" the Premier of the King's Bench.\" Magee's real object, it is hardly necessary to repeat, was to worry Lord Earlsfort, for his lordship had not, for a month later, obtained the earldom of Clonmel, a sop thrown, as he himself confesses, to allay the ruffled feelings which Magee's persecution caused. Here is"], [169, "Irislc Festivity \u2014 Lau Braugh Pleasura. 141 the placard, but in the original every line was, as is technically termed, \" displayed :\" \u2014 \" Magee, of the Arms of Ireland, Steward of the Irish Festivity, or Lau Braugh Pleasura in honour of the Birth of George, Prince of Wales, on old Lammas Day, Wednesday, August 12th \u2014 Presents his grateful acknowledgments to the men of Ireland, and most respectful compliments to those who are the fairest objects of this creation \u2014 the lovely daughters of Hibernia \u2014 that every preparation is made, and will be positively ready for their reception, to grace with their presence and honour by their appearance, the Irish Festivity, or Lau Braugh Pleasura, which will commence with a Boat Race \u2014 the Boats all ranged and to start from the Pier of Dunleary to a minute at 11 o'clock.

Lord Norbury, indeed, was the chief object of public odium and ridicule in the public journals, for tbe abusive exercise of this power. A rather impious parody on the Nicene Creed, beginning \u2014 \" I believe in Judge Bladderchops, the Father of ' Fiats,' \" appears in Cox's Magazine for February, 1810. \" Bladderchops \" was a nick name applied to Lord Norbury, in allusion to his Eolus-like cheeks.* But this practice of issuing fiats bad at length become so odious and intolerable, that it was summarily checked by Parliament. TOPOGRAPHY OF DUNLEARY AND KINGSTOWN. On almost every map of Ireland which has been published during the last two centuries, a place called the \" Three Churls,\" appears marked on each map, near Dunleary. The author sought information in vain from the \" oldest inhabitant\" as to the present locality of the Churls, until he forwarded a letter of enquiry to the Irish Times, to which he received the following courteous and interesting reply : \u2014 \"THE THREE CHURLS. \" Blackrock, Dublin, July 7th, 1868. \" Dear Sir, \u2014 In reply to your favour of this day, I regret much that I did not keep any copy of my * \"Ireland before the Union,\" by Mr. J. Fitzpatrick, the eminent biographer of Dr. Doyle, Lord Cloncurry, Lady Morgan, and author of the justly celebrated works \"The Sham Squire,\" aud \" Ireland before the Union ;\" works replete with the most interesting features of Ireland's past history."], [172, "The Three Churls. 144 note to you in reference to the ' Three Churls.' How ever, I shall try to comply with your request in this letter as far as I can. On reading a letter from you in a number of the Irish Times newspaper of last week, requesting information as to the locality of the ' Three Churls,' it gratified me to be able to point out, by modern names, the exact place referred to. In the year 1826, the Tithe Commissioners then acting, de scribed in the tithe composition assessment book of the parish of Monkstown, under the column of toivn lands, the ' Churls,' and of owners, ' Lords Longford and De Vesci.' My personal knowledge of this part of the country enables me to acquaint you that the ' Churls ' comprise that portion of Kingstown extend ing from Old Dunleary harbour, by Clarence-street, to Lower George's-street, thence by the left-hand side, to a point in Upper George's-street nearly on a line with the east pier, and thence to the sea. These lands were formerly in the possession and occupation of the then tenants of the Messrs. Walnutt, Hanlon, and Sexton, and are now familiarly known as Gresham Terrace, and the lands in front of it to the sea. The lands embracing and adjoining the police-office, for merly the nunnery, and the lands belonging to the Commissioners of Kingstown Harbour, also the 'Quarry Field,' belonging to the Corporation of Dublin Port, Crofton Terrace, Mr. Walsh's hotel, now known as the ' Anglesea Arms Hotel,' Plunkett Lodge, and the land belonging to the Harbour Commissioners of Kingstown. It may also be interesting to you to know, that in the key to the print of King George the Fourth's embarkation at Kingstown, on the 3rd September, 1821 (now in my possession), by John Lushington Reilly, Esq., the following description is given: \u2014 'No. 16, J. L. R., Esq., taking his sketches from the Churl Rocks.' The spot indicated appears to be just about where the Kingstown Railway ter minus now stands. This description fully supports"], [173, "Departure of O'Connell from Kingstown. 145 my statement, and may be satisfactory to you.

On the evening of the day on which he left for London, a great fall of snow took place, by which many persons lost their lives. \"Ancient and Modern Times.\" From the Portfolio of an Artist. Written on George the Fourth's Visit to Ireland, 1821. To the air of \" The Old English Gentleman.\" ****** In this posture of affairs, his gracious Majesty George the Fourth intimated his intention of visiting his Irish dominions at no very distant day, Then each party call'd a meeting that preparation might be made for his reception, so that when he should come, they would know what to do and what to say : The Catholics rehearsed their complaints, intending to make them a subject (after salutation) for the royal ear, by the way, When fresh advices declared that the king would set off imme- diately for Dublin, that is, with the least possible delay After the coronation, coronation, the wonderful coro- nation. The good sense of the Roman Catholics caused them to change their intention of annoying, with their complaints, the royal ear ; And they propos'd having a public dinner to celebrate the corona- tion, at which was expected the very best of good cheer ; U"], [174, "146 The King expected at Dunleary. Then an unexpected proposal came from the Protestants to the Catholics so very distinct and clear, That all hostilities and jealousies should cease, and both parties assemble at dinner without any doubt or fear At the celebration, celebration, oh ! the wonderful cele- BRATION. This proposal was accepted, the parties reconciled, and nothing but the general happiness was then in view, When, lo! on the 12th of July, King William was dressed up as usual, in orauge and in blue ; The Catholics, filled with disgust and horror, proceed by revoking their compromise, and forming resolutions anew, When the lord mayor declared it was done in defiance of his orders, without his knowledge, and by some persons that nobody knew : This caused reconciliation, reconciliation, oh ! wonderful, reconciliation. Then came the great and aggregate meeting at the Royal Exchange, which took men of all parties into the ring, \u2014 There was such shaking and squeezing of hands between the Roman Catholic advocate, O'Connell, and the lord mayor, Abraham Bradley King ; Then came Sir E. Stanley dressing councillor O'Gorman in blue silk, like King William. This was really an excellent thing. And master Ellis, caressiug Ned Conlau, the brewer. At this sight you could not, if you had a stave left, refuse to sing Tergiversation, tergiversation, oh! wonderful tergiver- SATION. And now the king is expected to land at Dunleary, great prepara- tions are made all along the shore, Engineers are moving mountains, levelling roads, raising fences, erecting scaffolds, seats, pavilions, and twenty thousand things more. The commissioners, swelled with importance, look big at their officers ; the officers, in their turn, swell at the people ; at which the people feel uncommonly sore ; And this was all but expectation, expectation, oh ! it was wonderful expectation. And now the long wish'd for day is come. His Majesty's fleet is seen off Dunleary, where you'd think half the world had col- lected. The fleet have come to anchor under the salutation guns of batteries and cruisers, when all eyes on the Royal George Yacht were turn'd and directed. But no king appearing on board, it is surmised that his Majesty has put in at Howth ; and at ten o clock at night this wonderful step is much more than suspected."], [175, "His Majesty lands at Howth. 147 The King's landing at Howth is confirmed. It gives a death- blow to the hopes of the south-side company ; the disappoint- ment is felt the greater, as it was so unexpected. This may be called extra vexation, extra vexation, oh ! it was wonderful extra vexation. His Majesty's reception, on landing, was so flattering that he was induced to extend on all sides his royal hand. The people throng'd and press'd around him, anxious to see their sovereign on so good a footing in their devoted land. And, tho evidently fatigued, he, with the greatest affability, did for several minutes stand. At length he gain'd his carriage, which bore him off amidst the proudest cheers to his palace in the Ph\u0153nix Park, where he was to take the command. This was consummation, consummation, oh! 'twas wonder- ful consummation. The King's grand entry into Dublin next takes place, attended by his noble peers and all the officers of state. The procession moved on in regular order, without impediment, until his Majesty and suite had arrived at the City Gate, When Athlone, herald-at-arms, made proclamation that King George the Fourth into the City of Dublin desired to be admitted straight. Then you could see the army, navy, church, bar, college, custom- house, with all the attendants and dependants that on their betters wait, \u2014 A trick of the corporation, corporation, oh ! 'twa a WONDERFUL CORPORATION. And now the lord mayor, presents the city keys, and on his knee doth humbly bend ; His Majesty, tho' teased and tired, submits with courteous patience ; yet seems anxious that this city mummery would have an end. Then the lord mayor and his party, common council and citizens, with the procession unite and blend. The recorder speaks a speech, by way of address, to his Majesty, to which the king did most graciously attend, To THIS EXHORTATION, EXHORTATION, OH ! 'TWAS WONDERFUL EXHORTATION. Of the city now made free, his Majesty proceeds in open carriage, happy at being relieved from the usual precautionary cares and fears. He passes thro' a multitude of his joyous people of all classes arranged in the streets ; some on benches ; others in windows and tops of houses, in rows and tiers, \u2014 A spectacle so splendid (if ever) hath not been seen for some hundreds of years ; \u2014"], [176, "148 A Royal Levee \u2014 Presentation.

It was acclamation, acclamation, a happy and wonderful acclamation. His Majesty is next seen on horseback viewing his troops in the Ph\u0153nix Park, and occasionally giving the royal word, Which showed (if necessity required) the king was as well acquainted with the use as the power of the sword. He was pleased to compliment the officers and men on their skill and quickness of man\u0153uvre, which, to his Majesty and to thousands of spectators, did such great entertainment afford, That again did his Majesty repeat his praise to the officers, to whom he gave a dinner that day at his splendid board. NOW, THIS WAS TRULY APPROBATION, APPROBATION, OH ! IT WAS WONDERFUL APPROBATION. The next day, being Sunday, his Majesty attended divine service at church ; after which he held a royal levee, at which many of motley character attended. The chamberlain's order for the next evening was, in consequence, ordered to be amended. It was expected no gentleman would come but such as had to attend ladies. This kept the vulgar at home, \u2014 many of whom it most sorely offended ; But it enabled his Majesty to receive the ladies that attended with more ease when the ceremony of presentation ended. This was royal presentation, presentation, it was wonder- ful PRESENTATION. His Majesty next visited some public establishments ; and first, that very useful one, called the Linen Hall. Then did the king go to view the National Bank, formerly the House of Parliament, but now used as a house of call ; \u2014 With these points in mind, he expected to have met the governors, directors, with their attendants, clerks, and all ; Instead of which he beheld a tavern, and, in the former House of Lords, a house of ladies dressed out as if for an assembly or ball. This produced consternation, consternation, oh ! 'twas wonderful consternation. The Dublin Society now prepare a breakfast, and receive his Majesty in the tented field. The king most graciously attended, and not to be offended at what he found the people's liking, was induced his own taste to yield ; Yet plainly showed by his manner of tasting, that feeding was not the chief consideration of every king that doth a sceptre \u00ab icld."], [177, "Embarkation at Kingstown. 149 To convey reproof, yet avoid showing disgust, he shortened his visit, which saved him from extra feeding, and from indigestion did his royal stomach shield. YET IT SHOWED HIS DISAPPROBATION, DISAPPROBATION, OH ! WONDERFUL DISAPPROBATION. The King was induced (though reluctant to feeding) to dine at Trinity College, where he met the best of good fellowship, with plenty of excellent malt, He was addressed by a very odd fellow, who, though a good scholar, could not entertain his Majesty with either poetic taste or attic salt. The address, though it came off but lamely, was amply made up in feeding, which did in no instance either limp or halt. All went off smoothly ; the dinner was well served, and better eaten ; the wine of the purest quality, brought directly from a long and cool repose in the sunken vault. This was mastication, mastication, oh I 'twas wonderful mastication. The lord mayor and aldermen, though well affected to church and king, have great reliance upon the good things of this life, and also to avoid getting thinner, Resolved on building a circular room, capable of entertaining his Majesty, and permit themselves and the corporate bodies to ex- pand at dinner. This cost several thousand pounds ; but, whoever lost, the worshipfid lord mayor, by getting a baronetcy, became a winner. This made him smile, and made his Joan a lady. The two sheriffs, in being knighted, each, in addressing his wife, became a grmner. Oh ! this was royal remuneration, remuneration ; oh ! it WAS WONDERFUL REMUNERATION. His Majesty, having promised relief to the Roman Catholics, fixed upon his return to England ; and on the third of September it accordingly took place from Kingstown, where some fifty thousand persons had collected. There was O'Connell on his knee, with a laurel wreath in his hand, and an address in his mouth. The one was not spoken, nor the other presented, as his Majesty and the other party were inseparably connected. The king thus escaped this and many other addresses, by making a most gracious speech to his affectionate people, whom he visited with pleasure, and parted from with regret ; this was as much as could reasonably be expected. The crowd closing and pressing about the king, he hasten'd to the boat, which conveyed him to the yacht, as it was order'd and directed.

Upon the summit of the centre one, at a height of 475 perpendicular feet from the sea, stands an obelisk, erected by Colonel Malpas, in 1741, after a severe and continuous frost (for the same excellent purpose which induced Sir Pigot Piers to build the more beautiful pillar at Stillorgan, in the year 1740), to give employment to the people, and thus mitigate the general distress then prevailing. Killiney was subsequently planted and greatly beautified by Viscount Loftus, who, as well as many of our Viceroys, resided there. In the year 1831 a stone coffin, containing a perfect skeleton and numerous ancient coins (Saxon and Danish), were found by a ploughman at Quatre Bras, in a field which then belonged to a Captain Richard son, near Killiney. J. Aspin, in his systematic Analysis of Universal History, speaking on the subject of coins and medals, observes, that \"few studies are of more importance to history than that of coins and medals.

There is also a ram's horn (the sym bol of strength and power ascribed to Jupiter Ammon, whose son Alexander was ambitious of being thought), twisting round from the back of the ear. This horn was also an attribute of Bacchus, and it might be, that he took it together with the chaplet ; or it might be the goat's, which was the symbol of Macedon. However, the former is the most probable supposition. On the reverse is the figure of Her cules, clad in the skin of the Nemean lion, and hav ing the club in his hand.\" Aspin says the figure of Hercules is common on the coins of Alexander the Great.

To the right opens, superb and unrivalled, Dublin Bay, stretching into the Irish Sea, a noble expanse of water, blue and placid, melting into the almost cloudless sky ; the sails of many vessels, faintly discernible in the extreme distance, alone direct the eye to the nearly imperceptible line of the horizon. To the north of the bay stands, boldly prominent, the Hill of Howth, its rugged outline, reduced by distance to an almost level plain, whence the low sandy isthmus of Howth (above which is seen the craggy rock called Ireland's Eye)* sweeps towards the city, studded with villages .villas, and white cottages to the water's edge.

Ireland is a spot peculiarly marked by such customs; some derived from the earliest annals of Druidism \u2014 others coeval with Christianity, all richly deserving the enquiry of the critic, or the ingenious conjecture and research of the antiquary. The antic mummeries of a rude, unpolished peasantry \u2014 the boisterous and hearty mirth that at certain periods of the year bursts forth through every impediment, levelling the barriers that modern refinement would interpose, and giving full scope to the strong ebullition of national feeling, show, that in sunshine or storm \u2014 in times of dearth or plenty \u2014 in the calm and sluggish stillness of debas ing servitude, or the hurricane of political agitation \u2014 under every vicissitude or clime, the Irish peasant is the Irish peasant still \u2014 the light-hearted, generous, enthusiastic lover of his father-land \u2014 the ardentpane gyrist of the olden time, and the scrupulous observer of the various fetes of fun and superstition handed down through a long series of years ; no matter how inconsistent with reason or common sense they may be \u2014 whether the cause of their institute be remembered or forgotten.

Brideog, of Bridget's night \u2014 from the startling rites of A 11- Hallowed-Eve to the pancake tossing of Shrove tide, we have seen comments and discussions, from Vallancey to the present day ; but why, in the festi vals of Christmas, the holly and ivy should, in prefer ence to all other shrubs, adorn the house or embower the dresser ; or, huddled together and hung with rib bons, become the throne of a murdered wren, no attempt has yet been made to explain. It appears to me a very reasonable supposition that, in a season of universal gladness, sensible and mercurial people, who knew the value of the senses as conduits of information, would avail themselves of the opportunity of blending instruction with amusement, and thus point out to the aosog of that day, whilst they carolled and gambolled round the object of their delight, its grand and mysterious associations. Like the Jews and Egyptians, the Irish were extremely fond of figure and hieroglyphic ; and like the old Fire worshippers of Persia, in their May-eve fire (Baalteine is the name of May) worshipped Baal or the Sun, who was considered the supreme dispenser of life and light to this nether world. On the introduction of Christianity, as may well be conjectured, they naturally looked around for suitable emblems to represent the object of their new faith. As an illustration of the Trinity, the Shamrock was immediately adopted ; whilst the wren, embedded in holly and ivy, might not be considered an inappropriate type of the incarna tion. Indeed they could scarcely have chosen a more expressive symbol of the wondrous humility of the Deity in taking the helpless form of infancy than the wren, the smallest and most despicable of the feathered race in our island.

And who is there that has visited Kil liney, and ascended its summit, that has not felt gratified and pleased at being allowed to rest his wearied limbs, after toiling itp the hill, in the little reception room in the obelisk, which was some time raised by Mr. Boucher, to commemorate nothing ! but to point out to the stranger in search of the picturesque, a spot from which he can at once obtain, by merely turning on the pivot supplied by the heel of his shoe, some of the finest views of maritime and inland scenery to be met with in our island.

There were few quiet contemplative men who had won more friends than George Petrie \u2014 friends of whom any man might be proud.

The man who was revered by Lover and Otway, O'Curry and O'Donovan, Anster and M'Cullagh, Todd and Graves, Ferguson and Stokes, Dr. Russell and Lord Dunraven, can hardly have been called poor.

For our own parts, fervently hoping that he may be enabled to complete his glorious task, we venture the Popish wish, that be may have the blessings of all the saints in the Festilogium of Aengus.' In this language Doctor Kelly simply echoed the feel ings, not only of the scholars and people of Ireland, but of the entire scholars and arch\u00e6ologists of Europe, without exception. It is the life of this man we have now laid before us in the present volume, the record of whose labours and works forms the history of his life \u2014 a life that was destined not only to resuscitate the long-neglected fine arts of our country, but more especially and beneficially to lay on a sure and solid, clear and simple foundation, its general and special history.

In the biography of such a man, unmixed with the party politics of the day, bis hours spent in his studio and study, in wild glens, island- solitudes, or the bosom of his family, little of stirring incident was to be expected, and little came, and yet what we catch of adventure and romance in his journeyings in search of the beautiful and true, whether in Scotland, Wales, or his own loved island, will be read again and again with pleasure. \" Doctor Petrie was the son of James Petrie, a por trait painter in Dublin, whose father, a native of Aberdeen, had settled in Ireland some time early in the last century He was born in Dublin in 1789, his mother, a Miss Simpson, of Edinburgh, being, we are told, a lady of great beauty. When about ten years old he went to the well-known school of Mr. White, in Dublin, at which Sheridan, Moore, and several others of our distinguished countrymen were educated, after which, his tastes and feelings impelling him to an artist's life, he began his special education irnder his father's guidance, in his father's studio. And here it was, about this time, that an incident occurred, which we have ourselves heard him narrate with the deepest emotion, as one whose painful re collections could never be obliterated, and which, perhaps, gave the key-note to many things in his after life. It occurs at the end of the volume, but is"], [196, "166 Tlie A rtist's Studio \u2014 Miss Curran. more properly connected with his early days. Of the eminent men of the day whose portraits his father had painted, were Lord Edward Fitzgerald, Emmet, and Curran. ' After the execution of Emmet, he was requested to paint a portrait of him from memory, with the aid of such studies of the head and face as he had by him. It is needless to say from whom this order came. When the work was finished the artist wrote to Miss Curran, requesting her to come and see it. He was out when she called, but she entered his studio notwithstanding. Petrie, then a young boy, was sitting in a corner of the room, when he saw a lady, thickly veiled, enter, and walk straight to the easel on which the work rested. She did not notice the boy, and thought herself alone with the picture of her buried love. She lifted her veil, stood long and in unbroken stillness gazing at the face ; then suddenly turning, she moved with an unsteady step to another corner of the room, and, bending forward, pressed her forehead against the wall, heaving deep sobs, her whole frame shaken with a storm of pas sionate grief. How long this agony lasted the boy could not tell. It appeared to him to be an hour ; and then, with a sudden effort, she controlled herself, pulled down her veil, and as quickly and silently left the room as she had come into it. She was unaware of his presence, unconscious of the depths of silent sympathy she had awakened in the heart of the boy, whose sensitive and delicate nature kept him from intruding on her grief That grief that mourned so deeply her buried love, will live for ever, embalmed in song and story by the hearts and pens of Moore and Washington Irving.* * In reference to this tearful event, and to the surpassing skill she was known to possess in attuning the harp of her country, Moore composed this exquisite morceau : \u2014 \" She is far from the land where her young hero sleeps, And lovers around her are sighing ; But coldly she turns from their gaze, and weeps, For her heart in his grave is lying."], [197, "\"She is Far From the Land.\" 167 \" We next find him at the drawing school of the Dublin Society, obtaining the silver medal in his fourteenth year ; and next, in 1808, in the Dublin and Wicklow mountains, sketching, collecting the ancient music of his country, examining its remains, and discussing their origin and uses, ' starting at nightfall, that he might reach before sunrise some chosen spot for study among the mountains,' and there gaze on their undimmed beauties in all their freshness the Sabbath stillness and glory of the morning. In the following years he visited Wales and London, and in the latter, through the influence of Sir Benjamin West, enjoyed full opportunities of examining the public, as well as many private collec tions of paintings in the metropolis. But he soon returned to Ireland, and spent the next five years in landscape drawing, principally from studies in Lein ster and Kerry. For many of these he had to study architectural drawing, which afterwards proved of inestimable value in forming his style, adding accu racy and faithful delineation to his easy, graceful manner. These studies were chiefly for engravers, supplying ninety-six illustrations to ' Cromwell's Excursions in Ireland,' twenty-one to ' Brewer's Beauties of Ireland;' sixteen to 'Fisher's His torical Guide to Ancient and Modern Dublin,' besides contributions to ' Wright's Tours,' and ' The \" She sings the wild songs of her dear native plains, Every note which he loved awaking ; Ah ! little they think, who delight in her strains, How the heart of the minstrel is breaking.

We cannot afford space for many of the other paintings described, all dedicated, as every creation of his genius was, to the illustration of Ireland, yet one, as connected with Ulster, we cannot pass over. It is that of the Caah Hill, near Dungiven, in the county of Londonderry, a monu mental circle of stones, where lie interred some of the great Milesian chiefs on the field of their triumph and defeat, and which, with others of the same kind, have erroneously been designated Druidic temples. ' The circle is one of several still remaining on the mountain, which, according to the tradition of the peasantry of the district, are the tombs of the chiefs slain in a great battle fought here, and from the mountain has received its name of Caah, or Battle hill. The tall stones raise their dark forms against the saffron sky, through which the evening star is just appearing, and shedding its soft light, while a few cattle stand perfectly motionless on the horizon. The sense of solitude and breathless silence conveyed in this picture, and the deep poetry in the simple treatment of the whole, can be felt only by those who have seen it.' In 1820 and subsequent years he visited Clonmacnoise and the Isles of Arran, in the former of which he was so singularly fortunate as to discover several monumental inscriptions of the sixth and seventh centuries, which, as he wrote, went farther towards establishing the truth of our ancient records than all the writings of the learned for the preceding two hundred years. He kept journals of these tours, which he intended to publish, a design never realised, though, as Dr. Stokes writes, the information col lected was in part used in his greater scientific works, ' while the beautiful descriptive passages \u2014 the little touches of human feeling and sympathy"], [201, "Clonmacnoise and the Isle of Arran. 171 with all that is simple and holy in nature \u2014 have lain for forty years unknown and forgotten.' We are much disposed to extract some of these charming pictures, so highly interesting in every point of view, and so characteristic of the feelings of the man, and select the following from many others we had noted. How very graceful and beautiful is the following description of the pilgrims at Clonmacnoise, how full of sympathy, reverence, and truth : \u2014 \" ' It will be seen from the above outline that the scenery of Clonmacnoise is of a character altogether lonely, sublime, and poetic. These qualities are rather enhanced than abated by the appearance of the figures usually found here, and which are so identified in character with the ruins that they may be truly said to belong to each other. These figures are of pilgrims who came hither from various and frequently the most remote parts of Ireland, to court the favour or avert the displeasure of God by a long and painful penance. Their simple costumes, of every varied colour, give animation to the landscape, while the character of their countenances presents subjects for observation of the deepest interest. They consist chiefly of females and men of middle age, in whose physiognomies the indications of in tense devotion or despairing guilt are often strongly defined. Characters of a most pleasing kind, how ever, are by no means uncommon. The anxious mother may be seen endeavouring to procure health for her decaying child; the blind and decrepid to obtain deliverance from their ailments ; the unfortu nate to obtain a cessation of their afflictions ; and the aged, with their white locks floating on the wind, shortening their road to a better world by a toilsome penance in this. Their attitudes, too, and the situations in which they are grouped, are often in the highest degree picturesque and striking \u2014 some times kneeling or prostrated round a grassy hollow \u2014"], [202, "The Irish Peasant at the ruins of a Holy Shrine. 172 the ruins of some holy shrine ; at other times creep ing on their bare knees to some place of still higher sanctity ; now arranged in silent prayer round the rude but gorgeously sculptured stone cross, which they afterwards kiss with the utmost fervency of devotion ; and now hurrying rapidly along to some more distinct object of worship. In all their move ments there is an abstracted intensity of feeling that carries the mind back to remote times, and a raptu rous expression of devotion and holy love may occa sionally be observed, which a philosophic observer might, perhaps, envy or wish to participate in. The casualties of season or weather are wholly disre garded, and the observations of strangers unnoticed. Figures of a higher rank and less picturesque costume seldom appear here, and such indeed, I have seen but once. They were a lady and her two daughters, habited in elegant mourning dresses, who, entering the graveyard with hurried step, advanced to a tomb of recent erection, round which they knelt in silent prayer for an hour or two, while the tears, which flowed continually down their cheeks, showed the intensity of the sorrow which brought them hither. After they retired, I had the curiosity to examine to whom the monument had been raised. He was a gentleman of the name of Coghlan, a descendant of the ancient princes of the country. . . . Few days, however, pass over in which Clonmacnoise does not for a while present a scene of wild commo tion, when the silent solitude is disturbed by the relligaun or death-cry, raised as some peasant of the country is borne to the grave of his ancestors. On these occasions the sorrowing kindred give full vent to their excited feelings of grief and affection at sight of their graves, throwing themselves on the grassy hillocks, which they kiss and press with melancholy ardour, now praying fervently, and now making the most distressing lamentations.'"], [203, "Tl\u0153' Ancient Melodies of Ireland. 173 \" Petrie was from his earliest youth passionately fond of music, but more especially of the wild strains of his own native land, and during his professional tours he never failed to garner up all the old airs he heard sung or played, or versions he considered superior to those already printed. And thus it was that his collection became so extensive that when the Society for the Preservation of the Ancient Melodies of Ireland, of which he was President, published its first volume, containing one hundred and forty-seven airs, with a supplement containing thirty-six additional ; all had been contributed by him, and noted by himself from the singing of the peasants and wandering musicians. What added considerably to the value of the work were the his- toric notes appended to each air. It is very interest- ing to learn what, in some cases, for instance in the remote islands of Arran, was the procedure he adopted to obtain pure and authentic settings. In 1857, after the visit of the British Association to those next neighbours of America, Dr. Petrie re- mained for some time with the author, Mr. Ferguson, and the late Professor O'Curry, to examine in detail some of the relics of the past, and particularly some monumental inscriptions, the readings of which had been debated. The village of Kilronan was their head-quarters, near which an appointment would be made to meet parties known to possess and sing some of the old airs. ' To this cottage, when evening fell, Petrie, with his manuscript music-book and violin,' (on which he was an accomplished performer) and always accompanied by his friend O'Curry, used to proceed. Nothing could exceed the strange pic- turesqueness of the scenes which night after night were thus presented. On approaching the house, always lighted up by a blazing turf fire, it was seen surrounded by the islanders, while its interior was crowded with figures, the rich colours of whose"], [204, "Petrie, an Accomplished Violinist. 174 dresses, heightened by the fire light, showed with a strange vividness and variety, while their fine countenances were all animated with curiosity and pleasure. It would have required a Rembrandt to paint the scene. The minstrel \u2014 sometimes an old woman \u2014 sometimes a beautiful girl, or a young man \u2014 was seated on a low stool in the chimney corner, while chairs for Petrie and O'Curry were placed opposite ; the rest of the crowded audience remained standing. The song having been given, O'Curry wrote the Irish words, when Petrie's work began. The singer recommenced, stopping at a signal at every two or three bars of the melody to permit the writing of the notes, often repeating the passage until correctly taken down, and then going on with the melody, exactly from the point where the singing was interrupted.' The entire air being obtained, the singer, gave the song continuously, and then Petrie played the air on the violin, as he alone could play it, the people listening with rapt pleasure, and, when the music ceased, murmuring their delight in their own native language. We would willingly copy the entire chapter on the ancient music of our country, but it is too long for our pages, and we can only refer to parts. It contains many interesting strictures on the peculiar qualities and composition of Irish music, as of itself, and whether of common origin with Scottish, on the genuineness of the Harp of Brian Boroimhe, on the melody of Robin Adair, which is shown to be the Irish composition of Aileen Aroon from the corrupt version of ' You're welcome to Puckstown, Johnny Adair,'* and of the discussion between Petrie and Bunting, whether the words of the song were adapted to the air, or the air composed * Oh ! you're welcome to Puckstown, Johnny Adair, Johnny Adair !

But for the present we hasten on to give some extracts from his journals as to that music which, in his opinion, stood pre eminent among those of all other Celtic nations, in beauty and power of expression in her caoines, lamentations, and love songs \u2014 the latter by their strange fitfulness and sudden transitions from glad ness to pathos and longing, marked by a character peculiarly their own: \u2014 'The music of Ireland has hitherto been the exclusive property of the peasan try \u2014 the descendants of the ancient inhabitants of the country. It is characteristic of their ardent and impassioned temperament, and expressive of the tone of feeling that has been for ages predominant. The upper classes are a different race \u2014 a race who possess no national music ; or, if any, one essentially different from that of Ireland. They were insensible to its beauty, for it breathed not their feelings ; and they resigned it to those from whom they took everything else, because it was a jewel of whose worth they were ignorant. \u2014 He, therefore, who would add to the stock of Irish melody, must seek it, not in the halls of the great, but in the cabins of the poor. He must accept the frank hospitality of the peasant's humble hearth, or follow him as he toils at his daily labours ; but he must choose a season to do so \u2014 unlike the frightful How does Will Aldigar do ?

Happily for students of Irish history, Ireland can produce docu mentary testimony of very ancient date to certify occurrences, and has preserved the code of ancient laws, as revised by the earliest Christian mission aries, to guide speculation as to her former modes of thought, action, and comparative civilization. It is likewise a fortunate circumstance for the historian that the course of events has brought her into con tact with many other races, so that he can test, and if needful modify, the statement of native annalists by the records of friendly or hostile observers.

This temple not very many years since, contained two other chairs, similiar to the one remaining, one of which we have seen in an adjoining field, and was en compassed by a circle of stones, eighteen or twenty in number. These stones have either been removed, or are covered with an embankment which appears to have been thrown up round it. The area outside the circle has been converted into a kitchen-garden ; and when first turned up, some ornaments, celts and spear heads, were discovered. About 1790, a num ber of rude slate coffins, containing skeletons, were found between the temple and the shore ; and about ten years since (1813), five large urns of baked clay, containing calcined bones, were dug up in a field near the village of Killiney.\" \u2014 Brewer's Beauties of Ireland.

No sooner had the Norman knights set their feet upon the verdant island, and gazed around upon its golden valleys and fertile pasture lands, than they at once found themselves filled with an inordinate desire to become possessed of something more than the mere vision of such luxuriance. They smacked their lips at the glittering prospect, and, in the abject subserviency of selfish expecta tion, prostrated themselves before their gracious and beneficent monarch. Henry received these advances with complacency ; he was desirous of rewarding the services of his faithful knights; and, as he had no land to spare in England, he gladly distributed amongst them, with a lavish hand, the Irish manors, which he only knew by name. One there was, situated in the vicinity of Dublin, that made the Norman mouth of Sir Hugh de Lawless water. It went by the name of the Manor of Shanganagh, and was, in sooth, a most ethereal spot. Slumbering beneath the mountain parish of Killiney, and sheltered by the umbrageous foliage of Old Connaught, the vale of Shanganagh, with out stretched arms, while embracing a creek of the dark blue ocean, grasped into a focus all the naturally picturesque beauty of that eminently rich district.

The family were then in possession of large estates, in Dublin and Wicklow. \" In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries,\" observes Dalton, in his History of the County Dublin, \" the Lawless family were in possession of Shanganagh, Kilruddery, Corkagh, and Old Connaught; but in 1473 tbe Vicars of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, petitioned Parliament, stating that they and their predecessors were seized of the seigniory of Shanganagh from time immemorial, had leased it to Thomas Lawless, and had also leased eighty acres within said seigniory to Edmund Walsh, who disowned their authority, and would pay no rent.\" Shanganagh about this time, 1473, passed out of the family ; but the Lawlesses were too much attached to the old property not to re-establish themselves as soon as possible in its immediate vicinity. This they did by erecting a castle at Shankhill, and a dwelling-house at Cherrywood, townlands situated within a stone's throw of Shan ganagh. In the fifteenth century, the Lawlesses were in possession of considerable landed property in Kilkenny.* * \"Cloncurry and His Times,\" with the permission of the author, W. J. Fitzpatrick, Esq., J.

Our ancestors, not content with deriving the origin of nature from an eternal almighty Being, delegated the works and operations of nature, to subordinate divinities of different orders and degrees ; some having immediate intercourse, and ultimately connected with the Divine Being, from whom they originated, whilst others, though far superior to mankind, were only ministering spirits to those of higher diguity. In every order and degree, myriads of these spiritual existences were supposed to inhabit all parts of the universe ; some dwelt in the sun, some in the moon, and others in the planets and stars ; whilst others again were stationed on earth, superintending not only the affairs of mankind, but every animal and vegetable production ; nay, rivers, lakes, plains, vallies, rocks and mountains, were under their protection, aud even the ele- ments have their guardian genii. The descriptions given of these aerial beings, in the traditions and superstitions of the people, are elegant and pleasing. They are generally defined blooming in full perfection of youth and beauty, enjoying the most elegant and finished forms, and clothed in loose and flowing garments of azure, blue or purple, skirted with gold and silver, whilst chaplets of the most beautiful and odoriferous flowers of the different seasons, adorn their heads, necks and arms ; and gems, which exceeded in brilliance the pellucid drops of early dew, gave a lustre to their elegant golden tresses. Of these beings some sported in living crystal waters, rivers and fountains ; others pre- siding over groves, forests and plains, reposed on carpets of violets and primroses, in bowers of jessamines, woodbines and roses ; whilst others, furnished with gold plumed wings, rode through the regions of the air in cloudy chariots of the most splendid hues, where they directed the winds, rain, storms and tempests. Those which were supposed to preside over the forests and vegetable productions of the earth, the Irish and Britons denomi- nated Feadh-Ree, pronounced Fairy, or woodland divinities. They were supposed to hold their habitations under the ground and in the bodies of trees ; to them appertained the care of corn, fruit and cattle. They were generally favourable to the human race, though when, through the ingratitude of mankind, they were injured in any of their charges, they frequently notified their resentment on several subjects committed to their charge ; the springs became turbid, the corn aud fruit blasted, and the cattle"], [220, "Puck's Castle \u2014 The Loughlinstown Camp. 190 Not far from Brennanstown House, Cabinteely, is the plain or area where 4,000 were encamped in 1795, commonly called Loughlinstown camp. Here, also, the army of King James encamped for five successive days after the battle of the Boyne. On one of the intervening nights the King slept at Puck's Castle, upon the side of Shankill, which over looked the camp.* The following extract is from Wright's Wicklow, published many years ago : \u2014 \" In this edifice called Puck's Castle,\"f\" the unhappy monarch, James, slept sickened and died. On which account great care and attention were employed to merit the favour of these guardian spirits ; and no small degree of homage was paid to them. The ancient Irish generally sacrificed to them by pouriug a part of what they drank upon the earth ; aud so firmly did they believe in their exist ence, that there were persons in rural districts called Fairy Doctors, who were supposed to hold immediate intercourse with them, and prevented them from not only injuring the cattle, corn and trees, but cured them of such diseases as they were supposed to have in flicted on them. These imaginary beings among different nations have various names and employments, according to their situation and mode of life. Among the northern nations they were called Aafe, Fairies and Elves. With the Greeks, Names : with the Romans, Naiads, Nymphs, Silvans, Satyrs. &c, and with the Hebrews, among whom they make a considerable dejiartment in their theology. From whence it is evident that the opinion respecting Genii, Fairies, Spectors, and Apparitions, so prevalent amongst most nations, arose from this ancient doctrine. * There is a house at the village of Chapelizod, Ph\u0153nix Park, Dublin, which was occupied by King James in the morning, and by King William in the evening of the same day. t The very peculiar state of Irish scenery in the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries rendered such strong frontier resideuces as Puck's Castle necessary. It was customary, at these periods, for hordes of men, under the O'Toole, to leave their territories and march on the palesmen of Loughlinstown, Shanganagh, Shankhill, and Bray, very much, it may be supposed to their annoyance and discomfiture. These harrassing incur sions appear to have been kept up until James the First ascended the throne. A flight of stone steps leading to the roof of Puck's Castle, is still in excellent preservation.

Enormous masses of granite, many tons in weight, are tossed about in the most irregular manner, and so imperfect and unfinished was the effort of nature in creating this gulf, that the opposite sides of the pass are distant only the breadth of a narrow road from each other ; in some places enormous masses actually interrupt the continued regularity of the limit of the road. ages, when the level of the ground was, perhaps, lower than at present.

The ancient burial-place of \" Tullagh,\" near the village of Cabinteely, in the county of Dublin, con- tains within its precincts many objects of interest to the antiquarian. The ruins are approached from Cabinteely by a winding green lane, which, from its elevated position, presents some charming views of the surrounding country, that will amply repay the visitor, irrespective of the time-honored associations of the place. The church of Tullagh, i.e., \" of the green eminence,\" is supposed by Dalton to have been originally built by the Danes, and dedicated to their king and patron, St. Olave, who became a martyr in 1030. In 1178, Archbishop O'Toole confirmed the church to the Priory of the Holy Trinity ; and the taxation roll of 1306 shows that there was a certain portion of land next the church approjjriated to St. Patrick's Cathedral, valued at \u00a30 per annum. Dalton also states that in.the Irish Chancery R.olls of 1370, there is an entry that Matthew, the son of Raymuncl de Bermingham, was despatched to Tullagh by the Lord Deputy to oppose the Kavanaghs, O'Byrnes, O'Nolans, and other \" Irish enemies\" of the English Pale. It is the opinion of the same historian that the church and its surroundings were formerly a sanctuary or asylum founded to protect the perse- cuted and penitent, similar to those mentioned in sacred and profane history. The numerous crosses or portions of same which still may be seen at a distance from the ruins of the church, favour this idea ; as it is reasonable to suppose that sanctuaries were in many cases surrounded by certain outposts, such as crosses or other symbols of Christianity, which formed a sacred line or boundary for the better protection of those who fled there for refuge."], [225, "Tullagh Chuivhyard \u2014 Annular Inscriptions. 195 Of the church, only what was probably the choir now remains, which is of small proportions, and presents but few features worthy of notice, further than a well- built and perfect semi-circular arch. At the entrance of this apartment lies a tombstone of large dimen- sions, which denotes the grave of the Mercer family. It may be interesting here to remark that from the date, and one of the names, Mary Mercer, on the slab, it is not unlikely that Miss Mary Mercer, of charitable memory, who in 1734 founded \" Mercer's Hospital,\" one of Dublin's noblest institutions, found here her last resting place. In the grave-yard, close to the ruins of the church, at its western side, is a very curious monumental stone of great antiquity, having on its upper surface a cross carved in bold relief with sunk panels. It is supposed that this stone originally formed a portion of the lid of a stone coffin in which an ecclesiastic of note was buried. Next to this stone lies, a remarkable mon- ument of a very remote period of this island's his- tory ; on its smoothest face appears a triple set of well defined, of what are called annular inscriptions. They differ in size, and each set is composed of four or five circles, with a boss in the centre. Mr. Henry Parkinson, who first drew attention to this curious monument, read an interesting paper on it and some other stones with similar inscriptions he found in Rathmichael church-yard* at a recent meeting of * In this old churchyard are six monumental stones, with annular inscriptions ; two of them were found by the late Dr. Petrie, in 1815 ; the remaining four were recently discovered by Mr. H.

A gentle man, who has taken the farm of Rathmichael, discovered, a short time ago, the remains of a subterraneous passage evidently commu nicating between the Castle and the old church at Rathmichael. The country people think that a quantity of treasure will be found in the passage some day or other.

Dr. Graves, Bishop of Limerick, has written an instructive article on this class of inscriptions. The late Dr. Petrie also de scribes, in the Dublin Examiner for October? 1816, two of these stones he found at Rathmichael. Mr. Henry Parkinson, Barrister, author of that beautiful work, the \" Illustrated Record of the Dub- lin International Exhibition\" of 1865, thinks that the following conjecture is worthy of consideration, namely, that the inscribed stone at Tullagh, was the monument of some former chief, and the carving, representing perhaps three shields were the symbols of his name, rank, and tribe. In the Irish grammar it is stated that \"Fiacra was slain at the battle of Corny, his uacht or funeral stone, was erected, and on his tomb was inscribed his ogum name.\" Outside the grave-yard of Tullagh, on the roadside, stands a fine specimen of the ancient Irish cross belonging to the order which Ledwich calls that of Odin. A few yards from this latter may be seen in a field another cross, which Dalton describes as belonging to the Maltese pattern, with a good deal of carving on its shaft, and although greatly mutilated, is a most interesting relic. Next to this are the stone pedestals of two crosses which have disappeared. At first sight one is led to think that this triple group of crosses was erected as sym- bolical of Calvary ; but on consideration it is mani fest that these crosses were removed to their present position at no very remote period, and they once stood, together with the cross first described, in the four cardinal points of the compass, at some distance The foundations of the houses can still be traced. Stretching up the hill at the back of the ruins of Rathmichael lies one of the finest fair greens in Ireland, aud there are people alive who remember fairs being held there not far inferior to the now famous Ballinasloe.

At Rathmichael are the ruins of an old church, and the lower section of a round tower, seven feet high, and twenty yards in circumference, called by the people of the district the \"\"Skull Hole.\" On an eminence of Rathmichael is the finest Danish Rath in Ireland, which is really worth th e notice of all antiquarians. It extends over an area 86 feet in diameter, the circum- ference of which was marked by a circle of stones, most of which are now nearly sodded over. Below this the Rath was encircled by a deep fosse of a much wider range, parts of which are still discernible. A wall and mound of an immense circumference enclosed all. The position of this fort was most commanding. Almost every Dane who arrives in this country visits this great military station of their ancestors. A few hundred yards from the fort in a hollow may still be traced the remains of another Rath, but of smaller dimensions. Moore, in his history of Ireland, says \u2014 \" It has been conjectured, however, and with much probability, that the stone circles of the Druids were employed, no less as rude observatories, than as places of judicature and worship; and the position in both of them of the great perpendicular stones, of which some, it is said, are placed generally in or near the meridian of the spot, * In Mervyn's \"Letters on Ireland,\" is quoted the following epitaph on a tombstone in Tullagh churchyard : \u2014 Ye, who the power of God delight to trace, And mark with joy each monument of grace, Tread lightly o'er this grave, as ye explore \" The short but simple A nnals ot the Poor.\""], [228, "198 Rochestown Avenue and House. while others are as carefully stationed to the right or left of the centre, would seem to indicate in their con struction some view to astronomical purposes.\" ROCHESTOWN AVENUE AND HOUSE.

On the death of Squire Malpas, the last of his race, Rochestown house gradually went into decay, till at length it fell into the hands of an aspiring dominie who sought to convert its classic groves into an.

Nor is it improbable that Pope, with whom he lived in habits of intimacy, taught him to soften into a curve the obdurate straight line of the Dutch, to melt the terrace into a swelling bank, and to open his walks to catch the vicinal country. These gardens at Del ville still remain a monument of Delany's taste.* Swift has left a humourous poetical description of them, in which, though he has contracted the features, he has preserved the likeness.\" \" Would you that Delville I describe t Bebeve me, sir, I will not gibe ; For who would be satirical Upon a thing so very small !

He was educated at Westminster School, and Trinity College, Dublin, which university he suddenly quitted, after having graduated M.A., and turned actor, in which profession he obtained great celebrity. He died on the 14th of August, 1788. He was the father of the celebrated Richard Brinsley Sheridan. t Barry was the son of a silversmith, aud born in Werburgh- street, Dublin, on the 20th of February, 1719. He determined to try his success on the stage, and accordingly in 1 744 he made his debut on the Irish boards, in the character of Othello. He after- wards played at Cork with equal applause, and thence returning to Dublin, made one of that galaxy of talent which drew such full houses in the summer, that it was very common to say that a person had died of a Garrick, a Quin, or a Barry fever. In 1746 he went to London, and was engaged at Drury Lane, where he per- formed both in tragedy and genteel comedy with much approbationg After having for some time divided the applause of the town with Garrick, Barry removed to Coveut Garden in 1749, when a de- cided competition took place between the two great actors, each playing against the other their principal characters, with various success. The grand struggle made by both was in the part of Romeo, in which the majority agreed in awarding the palm to Barry. He died January 10th, 1777. The admirers of Garrick were in the habit of allowing Barry every physical and denying him every mental qualification. They sneered at him as \"the silver-toned lover,\" \"the elegant automaton,\" &c. ; but there is no doubt \" in the silver scenes of dramatic love, conjugal tender- ness, and agonizing distress, Barry was Garrick's master.' Victor, in his History of Theatres (1761). states that on January 20, 1745-6, he went over to Ireland, and when he arrived in Dublin he found \"his good friend Mr. Garrick \" at the Theatre Royal with Mr. Sheridan, as sharers and adventurers, and Mr. Barry engaged at a salary by the proprietors. There were several tragedies, in which Victor had the pleasure of seeing these three performers appear together, as, in \"The Fair Penitent,\" Garrick acted Lothario, Sheridan, Horatio, and Barry, Altamont ; and, he adds, in his belief, ' ' that he was much envied that happiness. \""], [238, "The Earl of Chesterfield visits Delville. 208 \"Delville, Oct. 22, 1745. \" Yesterday we were honoured with a visit from our Vice roy* and Queen.

The O'Byrnes and O'Tooles were two powerful Septs who owned the greater part of the county Wicklow. The castles and strongholds of the O'Byrnes were situated in the romantic valley of Glendalough, while those of the O'Tooles were situ ated in the lovely and picturesque glens of Imaile, Glenmalure and Anamoe.

From time to time the citizens sallied out, and carried the war into their mountain districts ; these were called \" hostings,\" in which they were occasionally suc cessful, but were more frequently obliged to return with considerable loss.* In 1331, O'Toole of Imaile, at the head of a nu merous train of armed followers, plundered the palace of Tallagh, carried away a prey of 300 sheep, slew many of the bishop's servants, and defeated, in a pitched battle, Sir Philip Brett and a body of the citizens of Dublin that came out against him. Watch and ward were constantly kept here and at Bray, to repel similar attacks. In 1349, the abbot of the religious house of the Blessed Virgin, of Dublin, on his part, freely and voluntarily consented to find, at his own cost and charges, two complete horsemen and six hobillers, to assist the King's warders at Bray, in protecting the country from the O'Tooles and O'Byrnes, the king declaring, and it being understood, that such volun tary act of the abbot should not be drawn into a precedent to the prej udice of future abbots.

Their projects of destruction were unfortunately attended with too much success. The events which so rapidly succeeded each other in France at that time, surpass, in atrocity, all that ever stained the page of history.

To your laud be it spoken, that while the chosen ministers of the Gospel in the surrounding nations have abandoned the primeval simplicity and exemplary lives of the primitive Apostles \u2014 while they have quit the pious labours of the GosjDel vineyard, to launch into the regions of speculative controversy and polemical discord \u2014 while they have rent the seamless garments of their Divine Leader, and in- stead of conciliating among mankind the precept of charity and brotherly love laid down in my text, they have sown amongst them hatred and disunion ; in- stead of infusing into their souls the meekness of Christianity, they have inflated them with the rage of furies and the phrenzy of fanaticism, and taught them to manifest their piety, their charity, and their love to an omnibeneficent Creator by all the horrors of fire and sword, of devastation and massacre \u2014 while they themselves, instead of illustrating their avowed faith and the truth of their doctrines by the hu mility, meekness, and purity of their lives, have 2 F"], [264, "Coronation Sermon, 1792. 234 built hierarchy upon hierarchy, grasped at all the pomps, vanities, and vices of this wicked world, rioted in all its luxuries, or wallowed in all its car- nalities, and ground the face of the poor to raise revenues for the purpose of administering to avarice and extravagance; preaching at the same time, in solemn mockery, from their stalls or pulpits, which, as they never practised, so nobody would suppose they believed. \" Thus, true virtue and piety were forgotten, brotherly love and Christian charity were exploded, and men taught to contract mutual attachments or implacable hatreds to each other and posterity, not upon the merits or demerits of conduct or morals, but on the nature of mere speculative opinions in religion. \" In the meantime, you, ye venerable successors to the Druids of old \u2014 ye gentle missionaries of concord and peace \u2014 have followed with pious steps the example of the primitive apostles, teaching to your disciples the saving truths of Christianity, and not the polemical substitutes of fantastical schoolmen \u2014 the charity and brotherly love of your Divine Leader, and not the rancours of bigotry.

Or who amongst them would refuse a tithe pig because it was not a sheaf of corn, or a sheaf of corn because it was not a lamb ? Tributes to the Church, however various in kind, are all acceptable, because all converted to one aggre gate revenue.

In the third chapter of Ecclesiastes, and the first verse, are these words : \u2014 \" To every thing theee is a season, and a time to every purpose under the Heaven.\" These are the words of King Solomon, surnamed The Wise. Yea, he was a wise man, indeed ; he was wiser than any alderman of Dublin \u2014 nay, than any of the aldermen of Dalkey \u2014 nay, than the sapient privy counsellors of this realm, or any man, except ing our sovereign, who is wisdom itself. Now, what does this wise King teach us ? Why, iu the words of my text, that there is a season for everything, and a proper time for every purpose. Thence we may conclude that everything is right that is done in season, and at a fit and proper time ; and, therefore, there is a fit time for the celebration of the high festival we now commemorate, and that we aught in it to give way to every kind of festivity. To this we are urged by the words of the same wise King, who, in other parts of the same chapter, ex pressly declares, \" there is a time to laugh ;\" there fore let us laugh. \" There is a time to dance ;\" therefore let us dance. \" There is a time to em brace ;\" therefore let us embrace, whenever oppor tunity offers.

His Majesty, King Stephen, is so well convinced of the loyalty and in tegrity of his people, that though it is the richest crown in Europe, he does not intend offering a higher reward than HALF-A-CEOWN. Dalkey Gazette \u2014 Extraordinary. August 16, 1796. Never was there a day of greater festivity and harmony. His Majesty, by the advice of able ministers left politics entirely out of the question, and on the singing of \"God save the King,\" it was received with the most enthusiastic demonstrations of joy. Among the variety of deputations to the King of Dalkey, a very respectable one from the clergy deserves particular notice, as follows : \" The Commissioners having adjusted to the mutual satisfaction of both parties, the contested rights of presentation to the Deanery of the Muglins, and having superseded the ponderous of political discussion, the clangor of the trumpets proclaimed the approach of an harbinger preceding an herald, who demanded an immediate audience of the King. \" This being by the proper officers communicated to the lords in waiting, and by their lordships announced to his Majesty, He, with his accustomed condescension was graciously pleased to command the herald to be conducted into the royal presence, which being done, and his credentials duly examined and ascertained, the Lord High Chamberlain was ordered to enquire into the nature of his mission, and silence being proclaimed, he thus unfolded the subject of his dispatch \u2014 ' Please to inform the most august and happy of the European powers, that I am charged by that beneficent prelate, his Grace of Lambay and Kilbarrack, to signify that he is perfectly satisfied with the equitable determination which his Majesty and Council have made, respecting his Grace's claim to the Deanery of the Muglins, and he drinks"], [275, "The \" Palace \" at Eustace Street, Dublin. 245 his Majesty's health, and wishes that God may long preserve the royal family.' \" This was received with every demonstration of unfeigned pleasure by the King and nobles ; and his Majesty facetiously observed \"the herald who bears Cousin of Kilbarrack's greeting does in no wise disgrace his Lord's diocese \u2014 for by holy Paul he is as fat as butter, and will, in our mind, fitly become our noble order of the Scollop ; I do, therefore, direct that a chapter of emergency be forthwith holden.\" Proclamation being accordingly made, the herald was in due form invested with the ensigns of the order, and the sword of state being presented to his Majesty, he gently laid it on the herald's head, and dubbed him Sir Harry Icikle, amid the plaudits of surrounding millions. His Majesty having drunk the health of his Grace, and prosperity to the united dioceses of Lambay and Kilbarrack, was pleased to direct same conduct to Sir Harry, and to order the Attorney-General, the Speaker, and Sir James Turf, to bear his gracious greetings, to his trusty Cousin, and assure his Grace that every right, royalty, and privilege of his should be preserved inviolate.

His Majesty's arrival was announced by firing of rockets, discharges of artillery, and the most unbounded shouts of applause from the surrounding multitude. His Majesty entered his dominions at Dalkey, at one o'clock, and was received as the father of a country ought to be, with adoration.

By order of the Assembly the Viceroy of Ireland's Eye, King at Arms, went forth to the people, preceded by an herald \u2014 and proclaimed the King's resignation of the crown and sceptre, with the nature and causes of his resignation, and demanded of them to nominate a king from amongst the great body of the nation whom they would choose to rule over them, in consequence of his resolution \u2014 and the whole, with one voice, named their beloved monarch \u2014 Stephen I.

A deputation from the order of Periwinkle immediately came to the bar of the assembly, and presented four articles of impeachment against the Lord Chancellor.* First, for corruption in a former official capacity. Secondly, violating a sacred and solemn obligation, taken on his being appointed one of his facetious Majesty s most good humoured privy council. Thirdly, mal-administration of justice in his capacity of Chancellor, and \u2014 Fourthly, his late unconstitutional conduct in using undue influence, as a peer of the realm, at a meeting of the order of the Scollop, to make them declare contrary to the known laws of the empire, that the members of the orders of the Periwinkle had no right, individually or collectively, to petition the King and Senate for a redress of grievances.

Lord Jocular observed, that it had been frequently re marked, and with too much justice, that titles of nobility, instead of being considered as the rewards of the past, and the inducements to future virtues and great actions by their possessors, were too often used as substitutes for virtue itself, and only served as the empty supporters of ignorant pride, of vicious and tyrannical principle ; no man could consider the dignity of a mere titular distinction in a more frivolous light than himself, aud no man more pointedly despised the owner, if his actions were not such as marked the superiority of his virtues, as well as his title did that of rank. His lordship observed, that the monarch of the country had nobly come forward, and disclaimed all hereditary pre tensions to distinction, placing his claims to the rank and power on the most honourable of all foundations, that of personal virtue and merit, he therefore thought the least that should be expected of the nobles, was to follow the example of their king, and subject their titles to annual appointments, and their conduct to annual revision. Titular honours, he said, were the strongest sarcasms on demerit, and the very pillory of vice, for who but an idiot, or an atheist, would wish to be blazoned in titles, that are supposed to distinguish superior virtue, yet whose notoriety in the lowest vices sunk him to the level of abandoned reprobacy. A rascal in robes, said his lordship, is a character infinitely more ridi culous and contemptable, than a bedlamite emperor or a mountebank buffoon. His lordship said, that though he did not wish, like tha"], [281, "The Dalkey Convention Adjourns Sine Die. 251 French Assembly, to abolish all titular distinctions, he would not wish to settle a lease of titular honours upon any man longer than he should deserve it ; much less entail on his posterity, without proviso or condition. Human nature was frail, and in nothing more than ambition. If a man must need wear a title, he should wear it like a gentleman, and keep it clean, like his coat ; and the best way to insure his decency in this respect was, to subject him to annual revision ; his lordship concluded by moving, that no titular honours be enjoyed longer than one year without a revision of the conduct of those who wore them, before a committee of honour, to be chosen from the members of the Convention. Carried unanimously. His lordship then moved, that the title virtuous citizen, do henceforward stand as the highest rank of noble distinction in the state next to royalty. Carried unanimously. After which, with his Majesty's concurrence, the Conven tion adjourned, sine die. His Majesty, attended as before, returned to the great hall, where a sumptuous banquet was prepared ; and in the meantime, the Lord Mayor and municipality, attended by Lord Seaview, and several other noblemen, knights, and squires, perambulated the franchise of the city of Dalkey. They were met at Stormy-gate by a party of the Liberty boys of Dalkey, who, according to custom, took the sword from his lordship's sword-bearer in triumph to the great mole, from whence his lordship threw the civic dart into the sea, and then returned to the royal hall and participated in a most sumptuous repast, in the course of winch a plenipoten tiary arrived from the Grand Duke of Bullock, with a pre sent of potatoes ready boiled for his Majesty's table, which was most graciously accepted ; and his Majesty was pleased to confer the honour of knighthood on the ambassador. After dinner a council of war was held, in which it was resolved, that the thanks of his Majesty in council, be re turned in the name of the king and people of Dalkey, to Captain Wm. Power Keating French, of Dublin garrison, for his politeness and assiduity in endeavouring to obtain musicians from the garrison to supply the deficiencies of the royal band of Dalkey, and that the messengers who bear the said thanks be instructed to express to Colonel York of that garrison, the proper sense which the court of Dalkey enter tains of his Yorkshire politeness, in a surly refusal of his permission for any of the military bands to attend. It was also resolved, that the thanks of his Majesty in council be returned to the captain, officers, and seamen of his Britannic Majesty's frigate lying off Dunleary, and also"], [282, "The King's Song \u2014 \"Love's my Passion, etc.\" 252 those of his Britannic Majesty's yacht, the \" Dorset,\" in Dublin Bay, for their polite and honourable attentions to the Dalkey squadron, on passing them. The council having broken up \u2014 The grand chambers of hilarity were thrown open, the royal band filled the orchestre. His Maj esty was graciously pleased to sing the first song, '\" Love's my Passion and Glory,\" the Lord Mayor the second, and the evening concluded with a grand ball, to which the fair visitants of the island were invited ; while the exhilerating cup went round aud the loyal subjects of the empire of mirth, jovially supported the honours of their facetious government. The remarkable toasts on this occasion were as follows: \u2014 By the King \u2014 The people and constitution of Dalkey, with a grand signal of rockets, by a party of fire workers, under the direction of Lord Portfire, Master-general of the Ord nance, and three cheers by the people. May the will of the people be the law of the land. Three cheers. Prosperity to the commerce, and lasting happiness to all the subjects of the Empire of Dalkey. Three cheers. Lord Seaview then gave, on the part of the people, \" A long life and prosperous reign to the King of Dalkey.\" Three cheers, uncovered. Equal liberty, political and religious, to all the sons of Adam. Three times three. The fair visitants of the island, and all the fair sex of the earth. Three times three, uncovered, and with flowing bumpers. The ball and entertainments being ended, his Majesty retired towards his yacht, and all the subjects of his kingdom formed around him a circle, and performed a festive dance, after which his Majesty embarked, and his example was followed by all his subjects, who went on board hundreds of vessels, and the whole fleet immediately weighed and sailed for Dublin.

In the first place Dalkey Island, in Dub lin Bay, is a small piece of land, which in fine weather is invitingly eligible to pass a day and partake of a cold collation, and it is frequented by citizens, particularly on Sunday, for that purpose. One of those parties, becoming numerous, formed a government, and elected a king and court. All the officers of state, the military, the church, and the bar, furnished places, or at least titles ; and the same ceremonies practised at courts were observed, and the re spectful homage paid to rank and station ; the speeches used, and the mode of addressing, copied from the court, senate, bar, and church ; these were strictly attended to : the whole was a playful burlesque upon forms and prescribed rules. Stephen Armitage, of vocal memory, was king when I first witnessed this scene of hilarity and mockery. I obtained a ticket, and was permitted to land, for they had even land waiters, who were very strict ; all officers were kept on the alert. \" Kane O'Hara was poet laureat of the mimic kingdom at the time \u2014 I believe he obtained that high favour for \" My Lord Altam's Bull ;\" \" The Night before Larry was stretched,\" another song from his pen. In the course of the day, while business was transacted, many sub jects were discussed before his majesty ; those subjects were questions on some public measure that was perhaps not decidedly passed, and therefore such objections as might be made were slily introduced ; but the gravity of the speaker, the whim, the satire, were beyond endurance, with out bursts of laughter. Never had comedy and farce, or burlesque, such fair display ; when business ended and refreshments were administered, then came the tug of war ; but all was in good humour, every one was served, and there were great numbers admitted as visitors. After dinner, and drinking a few glasses, his majesty, king Stephen, honoured his subjects by singing. He had a good voice, and gave his song with great energy, which the open space where we were assembled required. Then followed calls, and many excel lents songs, duets, catches, glees, slang, and other humorous compositions, perhaps matchless in any other assemblage, entertained us the whole evening. The party then retired, boats in requisition surrounded the island, and we all got home generally without accident.

But King Stephen died, and John West, brother to my worthy master, Francis Robert West, was chosen king. This new monarch came into power too near the Rebellion in Ireland, 1 798, so that the satire was not deemed such a safe conductor of sentiment as it had been in more peaceable times. The kingdom of Dalkey was therefore neglected, and the government died a natural death on the demise of King John. Oh, Rebellion ! thou destroyer of all the social vir tues ! I saw one rebellion, and I never shall, I hope, see another.\" Among the persons who took part in the convivia lities of the Kingdom of Dalkey, was the celebrated T. O'Meara. As the times became menacing, and Ireland infected with French principles, the Lord Chancellor Clare was vigilant in watching every society which was formed, and, among the rest, the kingdom of Dalkey and its Druids attracted his notice. O'Meara was personally known to him, and supposing he could enlighten him, Lord Clare sent for him. \" You, sir,\" said the Chancellor, \" are, I understand, connected with the kingdom of Dalkey.\" \" I am, my lord,\" said O'Meara. \" Pray, may I ask what title are you recognized by ?\" \" I am Duke of Muglins.\" \"And what post do you hold under the govern ment ?\" \" Chief Commissioner of the Revenue.\" \" What are your emoluments in right of your o\u00c6ce ?\" \"I am allowed to import ten thousand hogsheads duty free.\" \" Hogsheads of what, Mr. Commissioner ?\" \" Of salt water, my lord.\" The chancellor was satisfied without further ques tion.

Among other anecdotes told of him was one very characteristic. An Englishman of rank and fortune visited Ireland, and accidentally met him at dinner at a friend's house. It was then the hospitable cus tom for every person who met a stranger at a friend's house, to ask him to dinner, and show him every attention. This was done with more than usual attention by O'Meara, who attached himself to the Englishman, invited him to his house in the country, and, in the display of his good-nature and sense of hospitality, gave up his time and business to make the visit agreeable and instructive to his acquaintance, who left Ireland with many expressions of obligation for the kindness and attention he had received. Soon after, O'Meara for the first time visited London, and being a total stranger there, was well-pleased to see one day his English acquaintance walking on the other side of Bond-street ; so he immediately crossed over, and with outstretched hand declared how delighted he was to see him again. The gentleman was walking with a group of others of a high aristocratic cast, and dressed in the utmost pro priety of costume ; and when he saw a fine-looking man, with soiled leather breeches, dirty top-boots, not over clean linen, nor very close shaven beard, striding up to him, with a whip in his hand and the lash twisted under his arm, he started back, and with a look of cold surprise, said \u2014 \" Sir, you have the advantage of me.\" \" I have, sir,\" said O'Meara, looking at him coolly for a moment \u2014 \" I have, sir, and by I'll keep it ;\" and turned from him, casting such a look of con tempt and superiority, as the other did not think it prudent to notice. Moore, in his Memoirs, edited by Lord John Rus sell, in speaking of the anniversary of this convivial"], [286, "256 Passage of his Majesty from Dublin to Dalkey. society (1796), at which he was present, says : \u2014 \" My recollections of poor Mrs. Battier have brought back some other events and circumstances of this period, with which she was connected. There was a curious society or club established in Dublin, which had existed I believe for some time, but to which the growing political excitement of the day lent a new and humorous interest. A mere sketch of the plan and objects of the club (to which most of the gay fellows of the middle and liberal class of society belonged) will show what a fertile source it afforded not only of fun and festivity, but of political allusion and satire. The island of Dalkey, about seven or eight miles from Dublin, was the scene of their sum mer reunions, and here they had founded a kingdom, of which the monarchy was elective ; and at the time I am speaking of, Stephen Armitage, a very respect able pawnbroker of Dublin, and a most charming singer, was the reigning king of the island. Every summer the anniversary of his coronation was cele brated, and a gayer and more amusing scene (for I was once the happy witness of it) could not be well imagined. About noon on Sunday, the day of the celebration, the royal procession set out from Dublin by water ; the barge of his majesty, King Stephen, being most tastefully decorated, and the crowd of boats that attended him all vieing with each other in gaiety of ornament and company. There was even cannon planted at one or two stations along the shore, to fire salutes in honour of his majesty as he passed. The great majority, however, of the crowds that assembled made their way to the town of Dal key by land ; and the whole length of the road in that direction swarmed with vehicles all full of gay laughing people. Some regulations were made, if I recollect right, to keep the company on the island itself as select as possible; and the number of gay parties there scattered about, dining under tents, or"], [287, "Moore's Birth Day Ode to King Stephen. 257 in the open air (the day being, on the occasion I speak of, unclouded throughout), presented a picture of the most lively and exhilarating description. \" The ceremonies performed in honour of the day by the dignitaries of the kingdom, were, of course, a parody on the forms observed upon real state occa sions ; and the sermon and service, as enacted in an old ruined church, by the archbishop (a very comical fellow, whose name I forget) and his clergy, certainly carried the spirit of parody indecorously far. An old ludicrous song, to the tune of \" Nancy Dawson,\" was given out in the manner of a psalm, and then sung in chorus by the congregation ; as thus \u2014 \"And then he up the chimney went, The chimney went \u2014 the chimney went ; And then he up the chimney went, And stole away the bacon.\" \" There were occasionally peerages and knighthoods bestowed by his Majesty on such ' good fellows ' as were deserving of them ; on this very day which I am describing, Incledon the singer, who was with a party on the island, was knighted under the title of Sir Charles Melody. My poetical friend, Mrs. Battier, who held the high office of poetess laureate to the Monarch of Dalkey, had, on her appointment to that station, been created Countess of Laurel. I had myself been tempted, by the good fun of the whole travestie, to try my hand (for the first time I believe) at a humorous composition in the style of Peter Pindar, and meant as a birthday ode to King Stephen. Of this early jeu d' esprit of mine, which I remem ber amused people a good deal, I can recal only a few fragments here and there. Thus, in allusion to the precautions which George III. was said to be in the habit of taking, at that time, against assassination, I thus addressed his brother monarch, Stephen : \u2014 2 I"], [288, "Robert Emmet \u2014 His Brilliant College Career. 258 \" Thou rid'st not, piison'd in a metal coach, To shield from thy annointed head Bullets, of a kindred lead, Marbles and stones, and such hard-hearted things.'

The political ferment that was abroad through Ireland soon found its way within the walls of our university; and a youth destined to act a melancholy but for ever-memor able part in the troubled scenes that were fast approaching, had now begun to attract, in no ordi nary degree, the attention both of his fellow-students and the college authorities in general. This youth was Robert Emmet, whose brilliant success in his college studies, and more particularly in the scientific portion of them, had crowned his career, as far as he had gone, with all the honours of the course ; while his power of oratory displayed at a debating society, of which, about this time (1796-7), I became a member, were beginning to excite universal atten tion, as well from the eloquence as the political bold ness of his displays. He was, I rather think, by two classes, my senior, though it might have been only by one. But there was, at all events, such an interval between our standings as, at that time of life, makes a material difference ; and when I became a member of the debating society, I found him in full fame, not only for his scientific attainments, but also for the blamelessness of his life and the grave suavity of his manners. On the very morning after the celebration at which I was present, there appeared in the newspaper which acted as his Majesty's state gazette, a highly humour ous proclamation, offering a reward of I know not how many hundred crobanes or Irish halfpence, to whatsoever person or persons might have found and would duly restore his Majesty's crown, which, in"], [289, "Royal Palace of the Revels, 1797. 259 walking home from Dalkey the preceding night, and \" measuring both sides of the road,\" according to custom, he had unfortunately let fall from off his august head.

His Majesty then proceeded to the great hall of the palace, where he took his seat on the royal throne of granite, under a canopy of celestial blue ether, surrounded by the officers of state in the robes and ribbons of their respective orders. \" The great verdant table of nature was then spread in the royal hall of hospitality for a grand dejuner,"], [291, "\" O'Rourke's Noble Feast.\" 261 and instantly covered by the royal sutlers with abundance of hams, sheeps' tongues, roast mutton, and other cold viands, and two tuns of nutbrown stingo from the royal cellars were broached in the grand saloon. \" A herald sounded the trumpet of hospitality, and invited all the world to come and partake of the good cheer of the king's table.

House or Noes, Die Stephani, 1799. Their Wigships being assembled in their best bibs and tuckers, his honor, the Seneschal, who had in the morning taken the diversion of bull-beating, came down to the hall in great snuff. His honor was attended in the State Jingle, by Nob Nothing worth, commander-in-chief to the Pimlico guards, who bore the cap and bells, and his grace, Moses, Marquis of Truck-street, who bore the axe of state. His honor entered the hall about five o'clock, ushered by Cross Poddle, king-at-arms, and being seated on the great stool, (after three solemn re verences thereto made), a message was sent to the lower assembly by the gentleman usher of the oak stick, requiring their attendance forthwith. The lower assembly being accordingly come to their place, preceded by Mr. Orator Mum, their chairman, his honor, the seneschal, was pleased to deliver the following most facetious speech to both houses.

The brilliant successes which have so recently distinguished the arms of Dalkey and her allies against the Zooder-Zealanders ; the cheap bargain we have bought of their bumb-boats, and, above all, the splendid retreat secured for our gallant legions ; a retreat unincumbered by horses, artillery, camp equipage, stores, or other such trumpery as must have proved highly embarassing to that singular and unparalleled man\u0153uvre, beggars everything told in history of the races ot Dunkirk or Ballinamuck; and gives the strongest pledge of indubitable success in our new expedition to the Fingallian coast, and the brightest promise to our hopes, that some time in the course of the nexv century, such order of things may be established amongst the Skerrinians as may warrant the Dalkeian cabinet in condescending to listen to terms of peace.* * Throughout the Pimliconian debates, which extend to a con siderable length, there is frequent allusion to the King of Dalkey, and other mock titles from that quarter."], [299, "BULLOCK,* Section VIII. \" Boulek,\" or \" Bloyke.\" The village of Bullock, with its remains of an ancient castle, and pier of Danish erection, commands a grand view of the Bay of Dublin.

The village of Bullock was formerly defended by a fortified castle and watch-towers. A great por tion of the wall that connected the barbican with the castle is still perfect. It also had a bawn of considerable extent. Grose, in his \" Antiquities of Ireland,\" states that he could not discover who constructed this castle, which was formerly of an octangular shape, with few windows, and surmounted by a granulated parapet. Some writers suppose the castle of Bullock to be coeval with those at Dalkey, * Bullock is a corruption of the proper name ; and, probably, the great and well-known sandbanks on either side of Dublin Bay (the North and South Bulls) were so called from a like corrup tion.

Among the Harleian MSS. in the British Museum is preserved a highly curious volume, towards the * Trim castle, standing on the banks of the Boyne, forms a pleasing object in the landscape. Sir R. C. Hoare says, that it ' ' is almost the only building in Ireland that deserves the name of castle.\" It was originally erected by Hugh de Lacy, to secure his large possessions in Meath, or, as Camden asserts, by William Peppard, previously to the grant of Meath to De Lacy, and con tinued during successive centuries to be the most important strong hold of the English Pale. According to an historical fragment by Maurice Regan, published by Harris in his \"Hibernica,\" Hugh de Lacy on completing the building, departed for England, leaving it in the custody of Hugh Tyrrell, \" his intrinsicke friend.\" The King of Connaught, taking advantage of De Lacy's absence, as sembled all his powers with a view to its destruction ; and though Tyrrell, advised of his coming, dispatched messengers to Strongbo w for assistance, and though the earl marched towards Trim in all haste, yet Tyrrell, seeing the enemy at hand, and thinking himself too weak to resist their numbers, abandoned the castle, and burnt it ; upon which the Irish Monarch, satisfied with the success of his expedition, returned home. Strongbow, however, pursued him, and falling upon the rear of his army, slew 150 of the Irish ; which done, he retired to Dublin, and Hugh Tyrrell to the ruined castle of Trim, to re-edify it before Hugh de Lacy should return from England. The castle was built in a much stronger manner, upon the ruins of the old one. Here, in 1399, Richard II. who was then in Ireland, hearing of the progress of the Duke of Lancaster in his English dominions, imprisoned the sons of his rival and of the Duke of Gloucester ; the former of whom was afterwards drowned on his passage to England. In 1423, Edmund Mortimer, Earl of Meath and Ulster, who had possessed the inheritance of Trim, and, as Lord Lieutenant of the island, had enjoyed more than customary authority in that office, died of the plague in this castle. + Sir James Ware calls him Earl of Desmoud, and says he was drowned in 1263, while crossing from Ireland to Wales ; but both these errors are corrected by Cox. The first Earl of Desmond was Maurice Fitzthomas, created by Edward the Third, August 27, 1329.

The poem is founded on a quarrel which occurred there between Sir Morice and Sir Walter, A. D. 1265. This is not a very accurate description, since the ob ject of the writer was not to relate a quarrel between two anonymous knights, but to give a detailed narra tive of the erection of the fortifications and walls of Ross, occasioned by the dread felt by the inhabitants, lest the unprotected and open situation of the place might cause them to suffer from a feud, then raging wTith violence, between two powerful barons, Maurice Fitzmaurice, the chief of the Geraldines, and Walter de Burgo, Earl of Ulster, whose deadly wars, in the year 1264, brought trouble throughout the realm of Ireland. So little is known of the early history of New Ross, it is merely described by all topographers as having once been a place of great strength and extent, situated in a large ravine, formed by the junction of the rivers Barrow and Nore. Of its high walls and frowning towers and gates, some remains continue until the present day. It was a place of considerable trade so early as the reign of Henry the Fifth, and ob tained charters from several of the English sovereigns, the earliest of which is supposed to be that of Henry the Fourth. Its port is so capacious, that ships of nine hundred tons burden may come up to the quay ; but the commerce of the town decreased, subse quently, to such a degree, that in 1776 we only find five or six brigs were to be seen in it. It has since rapidly improved, for upwards of thirty large ships, chiefly employed in emigration, belong to the m erchants of the town.

A seal was appended to the document, with the arms of Ross, being a greyhound pulling down a stag, and beneath, a bridge raised on several arches, from which bridge the appellation of Ross Pont was doubtless derived. Round the edge we read, \" S. Office, superiour, Newe Ross.\" In 1257, the Franciscans are said to have settled there ; and a convent of St. Au gustine's was founded in the reign of Edward the Third. Sir John Devereux subsequently erected the convent of St. Saviour on the site of the Franciscan monastery, and part of it is still appropriated to the irse of a parish Church. The more modern history of this place is chiefly remarkable for the defence made against the \" United Irishmen\" and misguided peasantry on the 6th of June, 1798, by the garrison under the command of General Sir William Johnson, Bart. The author of the poem commences in the fol lowing abrupt manner : \" I have an inclination to write in romance, if it pleases you to hear me ; for a story that is not listened to is of no more value than a berry. I pray you, therefore, to give attention, and you shall hear a fine adventure of a town in Ireland, the most beautiful of its size that I know of in any country. Its inhabitants were alarmed by the feud existing between two barons, whose names you see here written, Sir Maurice and Sir Wauter. The name of this town I will now disclose to you \u2014 it is called Ros \u2014 it is the New Pont de Ross.\" He then proceeds to relate how the principal men of the town, together with the commonalty, assembled to take measures for their safety ; and they resolved to sur-"], [303, "Ross, a Mercantile Port in Thirteenth Century. 273 round the town with mortar and stone. They com menced, accordingly, on the feast of the Purification, (February 2, A.D. 1265,) and marked out the fosse or line of circumvallation. Workmen were speedily hired, and above an hundred each day came out to labour, under the direction of the Burgesses. When this step was taken they again assembled, and deter mined to establish a bye-law, such (says the poet,) as was never heard of in England or France ; which was publicly proclaimed the next day to the people, and received with applause ; this law was as follows : \u2014 \"That on the ensuing Monday, the vintners, the mercers, the merchants, and the drapers should go and work at the fosse, from the hour of prime till noon.\" This was readily complied with, and above one thousand men, (writes the poet,) \" went to work every Monday with brave banners, and great pomp, attended by flutes and tabors. \u25a0 So soon as the hour of noon had sounded, these fine fellows returned home, with their banners borne before them, and the young men singing loudly and caroling through the town. The priests, also, wbo accompanied, fell to work at the fosse, and laboured right well, more so than the others, being young and skilful, of tall stature, strong, and well housed. The mariners, likewise, proceeded in good array to the fosse, to the number of six hundred, with a ban ner preceding them, on which was depicted a vessel ; and if all the people in the ships and barges had been hired, they would have amounted to eleven hundred men,\" a convincing proof of the importance of the town, at that time, as a mercantile port. On the Tuesday this party was succeeded by another, con sisting of the tailors and cloth-workers, the tent makers, fullers, and celers,* who went out in a similar manner as the former, but were not so numerous, Celers,\" mean saddlers, from the French word \" selliers.\" 2 L"], [304, "The Fair Ladies of Ross. 274 amounting only to four hundred men. On the Wednesday, a different set was employed, viz., the cordwainers, tanners, and butchers ; many brave bachelors were among them, and their banners were painted as appertains to their craft. In number, I believe, they were about three hundred taken to gether, little and great; and they went forth, caroling loudly as the others did. On the Thursday came the fishermen and hucksters. Their standards were of various sorts ; but on one was painted a fish and a platter ; these, five hundred in number, were asso ciated with the wainrights, who were thirty-two in number. On Friday went out the (illegible) in number three hundred and fifty, with their banners borne before them, unto the border of the fosse. On the Saturday succeeded the carpenters, blacksmiths, and masons\u2014 in number about three hundred and fifty. Lastly, on the Sunday, assembled in procession the ladies of the town ! Know, verily, that they were excellent labourers, but their numbers I cannot certainly tell ; but they all went forth to cast stones aud carry them from the fosse. Whoever had been there to look at them, might have seen many a beautiful woman \u2014 many a mantle of scarlet, green, and russet \u2014 many a fair folded cloak, and many a gay coloured garment. In all the countries I ever visited never saw I so many fair ladies. He should have been born in a favourite hour who might make his choice among them.\" The ladies also carried banners, in imitation of the other parties ; and when they were tired of the duty assigned to them, they walked round the fosse, singing sweetly, to encourage the workmen. On their return to the town, the richer sort held a convivial meeting, \" and,\" as we are told, \" made sport, drank whiskey, and sang,\" en couraging each other, and resolving to make a gate, which should be called the ladies' gate, and there would fix a prison.

Never, in any town, beheld I so many good glaives, nor so many good cross-bows hanging on the wall, nor so many quarrels to shoot withal, and every house full of maces, good shields, and talevases. They are well provided, I warrant you, to defend themselves from their enemies ; for the cross-bow-men, in reality, amount to three hun dred and sixty-three in number, as counted at their muster, and enrolled at their muster-roll. And of other archers have they one thousand two hundred brave fellows, be assured; and besides these there are three thousand men, armed with lances or axes, in the town ; and knights on horseback one hundred and four, well armed for the combat.\" The poet then assures us that the object of the inhabitants was by no means to court an assault,\" but simply for their own protection ; \" for which,\" says he, \" no one ought to blame them :\" they appear however, to have amply provided for their safety; for the writer continues, \" when the wall shall be completely carried round and fortified, no one in Ireland will be so hardy as to attack them ; for by the time they have twice sounded a horn, the people assemble and fly to arms, each anxious to be before his neighbour, so courageous and valiant are they to revenge themselves on an enemy.

I commend the town and all who inhabit it to God, amen.\" This was done in the year of the Incarnation of our Lord, 1265. The ancient family, \" Fagan of Feltrim,\" were the owners of Bullock and the adjoining lands. In 1611, John Fagan was possessed of one castle, one ruinous tower, thirty messuages, ten acres of meadow, 200 acres of pasture and furze, with the fishing and haven to the main sea. In a survey of 1654, it states, that Bullock, in the parish of Monkstown, containing ninety acres, of which sixty were arable, twenty- three rocky pasture, and seven meadow, was the property of Christopher Fagan, of Feltrim. At that time, there were,\" on the premises, a fine slated castle, a good haven, and bawn ; the chief fish, tithe fish, custom fish, and corn tithes, belonged to the proprietor of the castle. The King's (HeurylV.) son, Thomas of Lancaster, landed at the old Danish pier of Bullock, as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, in 1402. Bullock was in cluded, in 1448, as one of the places on the bounds of \" the four obedient shires.\" In the year 1559, the Earl of Sussex landed at Bullock haven as Lord Deputy of Ireland. The whole district is an inexhaustible bed of granite. Goshawks were found, in the last century, in the immediate neighbourhood of Bullock. Ware, in his \"Antiquities of Ireland,\" says : \" Among the feathered kind, there breed in Ireland eagles \u2014 hawks, which, from their preying upon wild geese, are called in English gos-hawks, of which those that breed in the north of Ireland are reckoned the best.\" There was formerly at Bullock one of those re markable rocking stones, which are asserted to have"], [307, "Punch's Offering to O'Connell. 277 been used for divination by the pagan priesthood of Ireland, and are additional evidence of the eastern colonization of this country, being identically the same as the b\u0153tylia \u2014 the animated stones of the Ph\u0153nicians, mentioned by historians, as moving or rocking in the air. It is supposed the Bullock rocking-stone was destroyed at the same time that the Druids' circle on Dalkey Common disappeared. About the year 1797, on that part of the common opposite Dalkey Sound, near Bullock, stood a circle of granite blocks in a rough state, enclosing within its area a cromleach. At that period the upper stone or slab had slipped off the perpendicular rocks or pillars which originally supported it, except at one end, where the passage was still left sufficiently wide under the upper flag. The stones were over grown with fern. When the martello towers were being erected, the stones composing the ring, which were from ten to fourteen feet square, together with the cromleach, were blasted and quarried, under the special direc tions of the late General Fisher, who had the management of the line of military stations then being erected between Bray and Dunleary, along the coast. The antiquarian or lover of Ireland's \" by-gone days,\" must ever regret this destruction of an interesting relique of antiquity, so worthy of preservation ; and this vandalism was perpetrated with the miserable object of obtaining some few hundred loads of stone, comparatively of little value. Bullock, Dalkey, Killiney, and Rochestown, were favourite places of resort, during the \" long vacation,\" by O'Connell, whose remains were recently removed from their temporary tomb at Glasnevin to the mag nificent mausoleum, erected from designs by the late Dr. Petrie.

Mr. Mathew was possessed of a large estate in Tipperary, which produced a clear rent of \u00a310,000 a year. As he delighted in a country life, he resolved to build a large, commodious house for the reception of guests, surrounded by fifteen hundred acres of his choicest land, all laid out upon a regular plan of im provement, according to the then adopted mode of English gardening (which had supplanted the bad Dutch taste, brought in by King William), and of which he was the first who set the example in Ireland ; nor was there any improvement of that sort then in England which was comparable to his, either in point of beauty or extent.* As this design was formed * Gardening is entitled to a place of considerable rank among the liberal arts. It is as superior to landscape painting as a reality to representation. \u2014 Wheatly. The English introduced the formal style of gardening into Ireland. Of this style several specimens remained till 1790. Dr. Smith, writing in this year, says : \u2014 \"At Ballybeggan, in the county of Kerry, there are some good old improvements which escaped the universal devastations of the times, particularly some fiDe avenues of walnut, chestnut, and other trees, with a large, old, but thriving orchard, planted in a rich limestone ground, beneath which are several subterraneous chambers, lined with stalactitical exudations.\"1 The same author states that, at Bangor, in the county of Down, \"there are gardens which are large and handsome, and silled with noble evergreens of a great size, cut in various shapes.\" The pensile gardens of Thomastown, in the couuty of Tip perary, were laid out in the reign of Charles II. They lie princi pally on the gentle declivity of a hill, resting on terraces aud filled with \" Statues thick as trees.\" 1 \" History of the County Kerry.\" \u2014 Subterranean structures of high antiquity abound in Ireland; but the vaults at Ballybeggan were probably coeval with the gardens, and built in imitation of the ancient English bower. Rosamond's bower is supposed to have been of that kind.

When all was com- A long fish-pond sleeping under \" a green mantle \" between two rectilineous banks, appears in the midst. And in one corner stands a verdant theatre (once the sceue of several dramatic exhibitions), displaying all the absurdity of the architecture of gardening. In the reign of Charles II. we find some of the clergy of the Established Church content to forego the academic shade and the luxury of pleasure-grounds, soliciting permission of Parliament to turn their gardens to account. Their prayer being propitiously heard, an act was accordingly ordained, enabling the Precentor and Treasurer of the Cathedral Church of St. Patrick's, Dublin, and the Arclideacon of Dublin, to make leases of part of their yards and gardens for sixty years. The French and Italian mode of gardening, which had been introduced by the English, continued to prevail in Ireland until the arrival of William III., when it soon yielded to the Belgian style.1 Such of his followers as settled here indulged their passion for \" trim gardens ;\" instead of mending, they changed the features of nature, totally regardless of this golden precept \u2014 \" Consult the genius of the place in all.\" Extensively acquainted with the vegetable kingdom, to them we probably owe the introduction of flowers. These they dis played in giant knots, designed with geometric skill, and edged with box.2 Moryson says that, in his time, \" Ireland was not quite desti tute of flowers,\" and instances the county of Kilkenny as most abounding in them.3 A few flowers might, perhaps, have been propagated by the 1 Of this style a specimen was given under his Majesty's auspices in his gardens at Chapelizod, near Dublin, which are now (1740) a scene of desolation. In the year 1717, an overseer of these gardens was placed on the Civil establishment, with a salary of \u00a3120 per annum. 2 Barras, or box, employed in edging the knots, was an article of importation in the reign of Charles II. 3 It is recorded that when the Earl of Essex, in his progress through Ireland, in the year 1529, visited Kilkenny, amongst other demonstrations of joy, the streets were strewed with flowers \u2014 A nthologia Hibernica. 2 o"], [328, "The Huguenots establish the Florists' Club. 298 pleted he returned to his native country ; and after some time passed in Dublin, to revive the old, and cultivate new acquaintance, he retired to his country seat, to pass the remainder of his days there. As he was considered one of the finest gentlemen of the age, and possessed of so large a property, he found no difficulty, during his residence in Dublin, to get access to all those whose character, for talents or probity, made him desirous to cultivate their acquaintance. Out of these he selected such as were most con formable to his taste, inviting them to pass such leisure time as they might have upon their hands at English settlers ; but it is to the Huguenots we are to attribute their diffusion through the kingdom.1 It was principally exotics they introduced. Walker in his Progress of Gafdening in Ireland, says, that in the reign of George I., \"Many a beautiful flower grew spontaneously in several parts of this kingdom, where the human foot has seldom made an im pression.\"2 To the Huguenots, too, we are chiefly indebted for our knowledge of the use of the shears, that enemy \"to the long wildness of form with which nature (says the elegant Walpole) has distinguished each various species of trees and shrubs.\" This direful engine began its depredations in the neighbourhood of Dublin, aud continued them, with unremitting fury, amongst all the noblemen's and gentlemen's seats in the kingdom.

They held their meetings for many years at the Rose Tavern, in Drumcondra-lane (now Dorset-street, Dublin), where they adjudged premiums to the members who pro duced the most beautiful flowers to the club on given days. This club existed till the close of the reign of George II. The Rose Tavern was in being up to 1793. 2 Mr. Leslie, in his poem of \"Killarney,\" speaks of several flowers and shrubs growing naturally on the mountain of Man gerton, in the early part of the 18th century, which hold a dis tinguished place, rank amongst the favourite productions of the modern gardens in 1792 ; but he omits the myrtle, which flourishes not only in the wilds of the counties of Wexford and Wicklow, but on several islands in the Lakes of Killarney."], [329, "Gardening in the Reign of Queen Anne. 299 Thomastown. As there was something uncommonly singular in his mode of living-, such as was never carried into practice by any mortal before in an equal degree, the reader will not be displeased with an account of the particulars, the first account of which was published in 1761. His house had been chiefly contrived to ansvver tbe noble purpose of that constant hospitality which a box nor a yew tree was now to be found which had not assumed the human shape, or that of some inferior animal.1 Like Milton's genius of the woods, to ' curl the grove With ringlets quaint,\" was now the business of every gardener. Even water was no longer permitted to flow in the undulatiug line of nature ; checked in its course, it was spread into an expanse, which a mathematical figure was taught to circumscribe. Such is the powerful influence of custom, that though \"the mind of man (says Addison) naturally hates everything that looks like a restraint upon it, and is apt to fancy itself under a sort of confinement when the sight is pent up in a narrow compass,\" yet these formal followers of King William, strangers, perhaps, or averse to the suuk fence, rear lofty walls around their improvements, and unkindly shut out the view of the neighbouring country. However, they are to be excused : 1 \"An old gentleman of my acquaintance (J. C. Walker, M.R.I. A., 1792), remembers to have seen in Mr. Forteck's garden, near Drumcondra, Dublin, the figures of men with their aims in various positions, cut in yew and box ; and the figure of a colossal goose in the latter. He recollects, also, to have observed, in the garden of Beamore, in the couuty of Meath, the representation of a large cock, with bristled feathers, cut in yew. In the gardens of Bullen, New-street, Dublin (now O'Keefe's nursery), which were laid out in the reign of Queen Anne, there was a hare hunt aud a boar hunt in box. The first pine apples produced in Ireland were raised by Bullen, a native of Westmoreland, who settled in the vicinity of Dublin in the reign of Queen Anne. He had a a nursery in New street, consisting of four acres, which he rented from oneRowe, who had been his predecessor iu that line. It is supposed that the fantastical fashion of cutting yew and box, so as to represent the human figure, &c, was in earlier date in Ire land than 1700. An anonymous traveller, iu describiug Bishop Usher's Palace at Drogheda, says, 'here is a prettie neat garden, and over against the window, in the gallery end, upon a bank, these words in fair great letters are written \u2014 L* Oh, man, remember the last great flay.'"], [330, "Gothic Architecture \u2014 Its supposed origin. 300 he intended to maintain there. It contained fifty commodious apartments for guests, with suitable ac commodations to their servants.

When a guest arrived, he shewed him his apartment, saying, \" This is your castle, here you are to command as absolutely as in your own house ; you may break fast, dine, and sup here whenever you please, and invite such of the guests to accompany you as may be most agreeable to you.\" He then shewed him the common they came from a country incapable of landscape. But they did not confine their constraint of nature to the limits of the garden ; they trammelled her wherever they attempted to heighten her charms. The whole demesne confessed their tyrannic power. Even the avenue assumed the gloom and appearance of the Gothic cloister; the stately pine, the murky fir, or the \" star proof\" elm, were marshalled in fraternal rows, nodding at each other, until their intermingled branches formed a verdant canopy, excluding the face of Heaven. ' Passing from this gloom, you ascended to the dwelling-house \u2022' with aching feet,\" terraces piled on terraces, covered with green parterres \"buttoned round\" with flower-pots, and bearing on pedestals in their centres the whole progeny of the heathen deities.

These arches appear of an equilateral shape, and of a regular uniform size. The mouldings, even now, bear evidence of very good workmanship, and the capitals of the piers are composed of mouldings nearly circular.\" The history of the Audoins or Audains, of which family the pious and illustrious St. Audoin, the founder of an order, to whose memory this church was built and dedicated, was so bright an ornament, is eminently characteristic of the strange vicissitudes of families. Audoin, the founder of the family, the guardian of the son of Walter, succeeded him to the throne of the Longobards in A. D. 548 (Valesius). He was celebrated for his justice, indomitable energy aud fortitude (Gibbon's Fall and Decline of the Roman Empire), and was particularly memorable for having led the Lombards into Paunonia, part of which the Emperor Justiuian ceded to him, giving him the Thuringian princess, Rodelinda, a daughter of King Hermanfrid, in mairiage. Audoin conquered Thurissimus, the King of the Gepid\u00e6, and was succeeded by his son, Alboin, who finally overthrew the Gepid\u00e6, and with his victorious Lombards invaded Italy, and established himself at Milan, taking with him the celebrated Iron Crown, and forming an epoch in the history of the nation. The fate of Alboiu was highly tragic. He was poisoned at Verona by his wife, Rosamond,"], [332, "302 St. Audoen's Church \u2014 The Audain Family. you are never to know me as master of the house, and only to consider me as one of the guests.\" In order to put an end to all ceremony at meal time, he took his place at random at the table ; and thus all the daughter of his foe, the last king of the Gepid\u00e6, in revenge for having caused her to drink his health out of a goblet fashioned from her father's skull. The descendants of Audoenus were driven out of Italy by Charlemagne, when they settled in Nor mandy. There was a saint, besides a pope, bishop, archbishops, writers on divinity, military science, natural history, and other subjects, among the distinguished men of the family. St. Audoin was blessed by St. Columbanus, in requital for hospitality shown to the great Leinster missionary by the saint's father, a nobleman nf Brie (Gilbert's History of Dublin). St. Audoin afterwards became highly eminent for piety, and acquired the favour of Glotbaire II., to whose successor, Dagobert, he was appointed chancellor. A handsome abbey church was dedicated to St. Audoin, at Rouen, regarded as one of the finest specimens extant of pointed Gothic architecture, and in it were deposited the heart of Richard C\u0153ur de Lion, and the remains of most of the early rulers of Nor mandy. In 91S the relics of Audoin and Langefrid were placed under the protection of St. Germain, in the delicious vale of Campaign Villiers, on the borders of his camp, near Port Orson. The period of the erectiou of St. Audoen's Church in Dublin, by the Anglo-Norman settlers, in honour of the patron saint of the capital of their original country, is not recorded, but the parish of St. Audoin appears to have been founded before the close of the twelfth century. This church was highly esteemed, and many important families made it their burial-place, including those of FitzEustace, Molyneux, Ball, Bath, Blakeney, Browne, Cusack, Desminier, Fagan of Feltrim, Foster of Ballydowd, Fyan, Gilford, Gilbert, Malone, Mapas, Molesworth, Pulteney, Perceval, Quinn, Talbot, Usher, Henrys, &c The subsequent history of the Audoins or Audains, as they came to spell their name, the old French (o) being changed into fa} is not uninteresting. They remained as\" a family of conse quence in Normandy, possessing large landed estates at Rouen, at Caen, and Brotend, at which latter place was a \" palace of chase, in the vast Arelaunensis silva,\" frequented by 'the kings of the Moravingian, or second race of Franko \u2014 Saxon kings\u2014 until the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, at which period, having embraced the new religious opinions of the Huguenots, they were forced to quit France, emigrating to the West Indies, where they purchased large sugar plantations.

There was a large room fitted up exactly like a coffee-house, where a bar-maid and waiters attended to furnish refreshments at all times of the day. Here, such as chose it, breakfasted at their own hour. It was furnished with chess-boards, sively as a soldier, a sailor, and a large landowner in the West Indies, a mining capitalist in South America, a churchman, and eminent popular preacher in Bath, and president of the Republic of San Domingo or Hayti. This remarkable man, who could fight, write, preach, bargain and sell, or legislate, with equal facility, and could deliver an extempore address, or harangue a mob in several different languages, signalized himself by the exhibition of indomitable heroism, great fertility of resources, and military and strategic talent in numerous encounters with the Spanish and French expeditions against the West Indiau Islands, voluntarily placing his privateering vessels and the tenants on his estates, in the hour of danger, at the service of the English Government. At the siege of St. Kitts, by a French fleet, he organized aud headed the defence in person, and defeated the Marquis of Bouille, who was so charmed with his gallantry and military skill that, afterwards learning he was of French extraction, offered him a high command in the army, and the restoration of his family property in Normandy, which had been forfeited to the French Government, if he would join the French, and that if he refused, his government contemplated converting the chateaux and estates into a model-farm. The offer to betray the country of his asylum, his adoptiou, and his inclinations, was rejected with scorn by the gallant emigre', who, some years afterwards, in accordance with the spirit of the lax and stirring age in which he lived, although at the time in holy orders, he headed the defence of the Island of Dominica, which was besieged by the French, and ably kept the enemy at bay until an English squadron came to the rescue. The published memoirs of this distinguished man, who, at different times, made aud dissipated several fortunes (and of which Coleridge's \"Six Months in the West Indies\" is, in great part, a reprint), teemed' with hairbreadth escapes and anecdotes of eccentricity ; and several novelists, including Sir Walter Scott, have been indebted for some of the most trenchant episodes in their works to the facts and realities of his life. His grandson, Colonel Willett Payne Audain, at present residing at Fitzroy avenue, Belfast, is the surviving representative of this historic family.

But the most extraordinary circumstance in his whole do mestic arrangement, was that of a detached room in one of the extremities of the house, called the tavern. As he was himself a very temperate man, and many of his guests were of the same disposition, the quantity of wine for the common room was but moderate ; but as drinking was much in fashion in those days, in order to gratify such of his guests as had indulged themselves in that custom, he had re course to the above-mentioned contrivance ; and it was the custom of all who loved a cheerful glass, to adjourn to the tavern soon after dinner, and leave the more sober folks to themselves. Here a waiter, in a blue apron, attended (as was the fashion then), and all things in the room were contrived so as to humour the illusion. Here every one called for what liquor he liked, with as little restraint, as if he were really in a hotel. Here, too, the midnight orgies of Bacchus were often celebrated, with the same noisy mirth as is custo mary in his city temples, without in the least disturb ing the repose of the more sober part of the family. Games of all sorts were allowed, but under such restrictions as to prevent gambling ; and so as to answer their true end \u2014 that of amusement \u2014 without injury to the purse of the players. There were two billiard-tables, and a large howling-green ; ample provision was made for all such as delighted in country sports ; fishing tackle of all sorts ; varies}7 of guns, with proper ammunition ; a pack of buck hounds, another of foxhounds, and another of harriers. He constantly kept twenty choice hunters in his stables, for the use of those who were not properly mounted for the chase. It may be thought that his income was not sufficient to support so expensive an establishment ; but when it is considered that ten thousand a-year at that time was fully equal to double"], [335, "Domestic Economy at Thomastown. 305 that sum at present; that his large demesne, in some of the richest soil in Ireland, furnished the house with every necessary except groceries and wine, it may be supposed to be easily practicable, if under the regulation of a strict economy ; of which no man was a greater master. His plan was so well formed, and he had such checks upon all his domestics, that it was impossible there could be any waste ; or that any article from the larder, or a single bottle of wine from the cellar could have been purloined without immediate detection. This was done partly by the choice of faithful stewards, and clerks of approved integrity; but chiefly by his own superintendence of the whole, as not a day passed without having all the accounts of the preceding one laid before him. This he was enabled to do by his early rising ; and the business being finished before others were out of their beds, he always appeared the most disengaged, man in the house, and seemed to have as little conduct of it as any of the guests. And, indeed, to a stranger he might pass for such ; as he made it a point that no one should consider him in the light of master of the house ; nor pay him the least civilities on that score ; which he carried so far, that he sometimes went abroad without giving any notice, and staid away several days, while things went on as usual at home ; and, on his return, he would not allow any gratulations to be made to him, nor any notice to be taken of him, than if he had not been absent during that time. The arrangements of every sort were so prudently made that no multiplicity of guests, or their domestics, ever occasioned any disorder; and all things were conducted with the same ease and regularity as in a private family. There was one point which seemed of great difficulty, that of establishing certain signals, by which each servant might know when he was summoned to his master's apartment. For this purpose, there was a great hall 2 p"], [336, "Swift and Sheridan as Guests. 306 appropriated to their use where they always assembled when they were not on duty. Along the wall bells were ranged in order, one to each apartment, with the number of the chamber marked over it ; so that when any one of them was rung, they had only to turn their eyes to the bell, and see what servant was called. He was the first to put an end to that inhos pitable custom of giving vales to servants, by making a suitable addition to their wages ; at the same time assuring them, that if they ever took any afterwards, they should be discharged with disgrace ; and, to prevent temptation, the guests were informed, that Mr. Mathew would consider it as the highest affront if anj7 offer of that sort were made. As Swift had heard much of the place from Dr. Sheridan, who had been often a welcome guest there, both on account of his companionable qualities, and as being preceptor to the nephew of Mr. Mathew, he was desirous of seeing, with his own eyes, whether the report of it were true, which he could not help thinking to have been much exaggerated. Upon receiving an intimation of this from Dr. Sheridan, Mr. Mathew wrote a polite letter to the Dean, re questing the honour of a visit, in company with the Doctor, on his next school vacation. They set out accordingly on horseback, attended by a gentle man who was a near relation of Mr. Mathew. They had scarce reached the inn where they were to pass the first night, and which, like most of the Irish inns at that time, afforded but miserable entertainment, when a coach and six arrived, sent to convey them the remainder of their journey to Thomastown ; and at the same time bringing store of the choicest viands, wine, and other liquors for their refreshment. Swift was highly pleased with this uncommon mark of attention paid him, and the circumstance of the coach proved particularly agreeable, as he had been a good deal fatigued with his day's journey. When they came"], [337, "Dr. Sheridan's \"Arts Pun-Ica.\" 307 within sight of the house, the Dean, astonished at its magnitude, cried out : \" What in the name of God can be the use of such a vast building V \" Why, Mr. Dean,\" cried out their fellow-traveller, before men- tioned, \" there's no less than forty apartments for guests in that house, and all of them, probably, occupied at this time, except what are reserved for us.\" Swift, in his usual manner, bawled out to the coach- man to stop, and bade him turn about and drive him back to Dublin, for he could not think of mixing with such a crowd. \" Well,\" said he, suddenly after- wards, \"there is no remedy, I must submit; but I have lost a fortnight of my life.\" Mr. Mathew received him at the door with uncommon marks of respect, and then conducting him to his apartment, after some compliments, made him his usual speech, acquainting him with tbe customs of tbe house, and then retired, leaving him in possession of his castle. Soon after the cook appeared with his bill of fare, to receive his directions about supper, and the butler at the same time with a list of wines and other liquors. \"And is all this really so,\" said Swift, \"and may I com- mand here as in my own house ?\" The gentleman before mentioned assured him he might, and that nothing could be more agreeable to the owner of that mansion than that all under his roof should live con formably to their own inclinations, without the least restraint. \" Well, then,\" said Swift, \" I invite you and Dr. Sheridan* to be my guests while I stay, for I * Dr. Thomas Sheridan the personal friend of Dean Swift, who enjoyed Mr. Mathew's hospitality at Thomastown, published iu 1719, with the concurrence of the Dean, his \"Arts Pun-ica, sive Flos Linquarum in seventy-nine rules, for the further improvement of conversation and help of memory.

On the fourth day Swift entered the room where the company were assembled before dinner, and addressed Mr. Mathew, in one of the finest complimental speeches that ever wrote this work, turning punning into ridicule, as the only effectual means to cure this folly. Dean Swift subscribed to the work, and addressed the following verses to the Author. \" Had I ten thousand mouths and tongues, Had I ten thousand pair of lungs ; Ten thousand skulls with braius to think, Ten thousand standishes of ink, Ten thousand hands and pens to write, Thy praise I'd study day and night. 0 may thy work for ever live (Dear Tom, a friendly zeal forgive).

He showed that he had a full comprehension of the whole of the plan, and of the judicious adaptation of the parts to the whole ; and pointed out several articles which had escaped general observation. Such an address from a man of Swift's character, could not fail of being pleasing to the owner, who was at the same time the planner of these improvements ; and so fine an eulogium from one who was supposed to deal more in satire than panegyric, was likely to remove the prejudice enter tained against his character, and prepossess the rest of the company in his favour. He concluded his speech by saying : \" And now, ladies and gentlemen, I am come to live among you, and it shall be no fault of mine if we do not pass our time agreeably.\" After dinner, being in high spirits, he entertained the company with several pleasantries. Dr. Sheridan and he played into one another's hands ; they joked, they punned, they laughed, and a general gaiety was diffused through the whole company. In a short time all constraint on his account disappeared. He entered readily into all their little schemes of pro moting mirth, and every day, with the assistance of his coadjutor, produced some new one which afforded a good deal of sport and merriment. Never were such joyous scenes known there before ; for when to ease and cheerfulness there is superadded at times the higher enjoyment of gay wit, lively fancy, and droll humour, nothing can be wanting to the perfec tion of the social pleasures of life. When the time came which obliged Dr. Sheridan to return to his school, the company were so delighted with the Dean, that they earnestly entreated him to stay there some time longer ; and Mr. Mathew himself for once broke through his rule of never soliciting the stay of any guest (it being the established custom of the house"], [340, "Knights Errant in Quest of Adventure. 310 that all might depart when they thought proper without any ceremony of leave-taking), by joining in the request. Swift found himself so happy in his situation there, that he readily yielded to their soli citations ; and, instead of the fortnight which he had originally intended, passed four months there, much to his own satisfaction, and that of all those who visited the place at that time. Having given an account of the owner of this happy mansion, I shall now relate an adventure he was engaged in of so singular a kind as deserves well to be recorded. It was towards the latter end of Queen Anne's reign, when Mr. Mathew returned to Dublin after his long residence abroad. At that time party spirit ran very high, but raged nowhere with such violence as in that city, insomuch, that duels were every day fought there on that score. There happened to be, at that time, two gentlemen in London who valued themselves highly on their skill in fencing ; the name of one was Pack, of the other Creed ; the former a major, the latter a captain in the army. Hearing of these daily exploits in Dublin, they resolved, like two knights errant, to go oyer in quest of adventure. Upon inquiry, they learned that Mr. Mathew, lately arrived from France, had the character of being one of the first swordsmen in Europe. Pack, rejoiced to find an antagonist worthy of him, resolved, the first oppor tunity, to pick a quarrel with him ; and meeting him as he was carried along the streets in his chair, jostled the fore-chairman. Of this Mathew took no notice, as supposing it to be accidental. But Pack afterwards boasted of it in the public coffee-house, saying, that he had purposely offered this insult to the gentleman who had not the spirit to resent it. There happened to be present a particular friend of Mr. Mathew of the name of Macnamara, a man of tried courage, and reputed the best fencer in Ireland. He immediately took up the quarrel, and said he was"], [341, "Mathew, Macnamara, Pack, and Creed. 311 sure Mr. Mathew did not suppose the affront intended, otherwise he would have chastised him on the spot ; but if the major would let him know where he was to be found, he should be waited on imme diately on his friend's return, who was to dine a little way out of town. The major said he should be at the tavern over the way, where he and his companions would wait their commands. Immediately on his arrival, Mathew, being made acquainted with what had passed, went from the coffee-house to the tavern accompanied by Macnamara. Being shown into the room where the two gentlemen were, after having secured the door, without any expostulation, Mathew and Pack drew their swords ; but Macnamara stopped them, saying he had something to propose before they proceeded to action. He said in cases of this nature, he could never bear to be a cool spectator ; so, Sir, addressing himself to Creed, if you please, I shall have the honour of entertaining you in the same manner. Creed, who desired no better sport, made no other reply than that of instantly drawing his sword, and to work the four champions fell, with the same composure as if it were only a fencing-match wTith foils. The conflict was of some duration, and maintained with great obstinacy by the two officers, notwithstanding the great effusion of blood from the many wounds they had received. At length, quite exhausted, they both fell, and yielded the victory to the superior skill of their antagonists. Upon this occasion Mathew gave a remarkable proof of the perfect composure of his mind during the action. Creed had fallen the first, upon which Pack exclaimed, \"Ah, poor Creed ! are you gone?\" \"Yes,\" said Mathew, very composedly, and you shall instantly pack after him\" at the same time making a home thrust quite through his body, which threw him to the ground. This was the more remarkable as he was never in his life, either before or after, known to"], [342, "312 Curran\u2014 Native Hospitality of his Country. have aimed at a pun. The number of wounds received by the vanquished parties was very great; and, what seems almost miraculous, their opponents were untouched. The surgeons, seeing the desperate state of their patients, would not suffer them to be removed out of the room where they fought, but had beds immediately conveyed into it, on which they lay many hours in a state of insensibility. When they came to themselves, and saw where they were, Pack, in a feeble voice, said to his companion, Creed, I think we are conquerors, for we have kept the field of battle. For a long time their lives were despaired of ; but, to the astonishment of everyone, they both recovered. When they were able to see company, Mr. Mathew and his friend attended them daily, and a close intimacy afterwards ensued, as they found them men of probity and of the best disposi tions, except in the Quixotish idea of duelling, whereof they were now perfectly cured. Curran, in one of his celebrated speeches, thus. beautifully described the native hospitality of his country : \" The hospitality of other countries is a matter of necessity, or convention ; in savage nations, of the first; in polished, of the latter; but the hospi tality of an Irishman is not the running account of posted and legered courtesies, as in other countries \u2014 it springs, like all his other qualities, his faults, his virtues, directly from the heart.

All these attractions and advantages combine to render Bray a favorite place of abode with the nobility and gentry. No wonder that progress and prosperity should, in an eminent degree, result. And now to speak of the enterprise and energy of the worthy and zealous men who designed and carried out, at vast labour and expense, the various and grand improvements, to whom Bray is principally indebted for its rising prosperity and proud position. First and prominent, stands the name of the late noble-minded, generous, and good William Dar gan, a man of nature's true nobility. By him the sea-beach, from the mouth of the Dargle river to Bray Head, was levelled, a good road formed, the Espla nade planned and perfected, and the Turkish baths built. Sir William Wilde, the eminent physician, erected several ranges of first-class mansions along the shore, overlooking the Esplanade. However, Bray, in a great measure, owes its present proud position to Quin,* Breslin, Fortune, and * Mr. J. Quin may be justly styled the father of Bray. His hotel had a European reputation. He lived many years to enjoy the affectionate intercourse of his numerous friends. \" Quin, of Bray, \" had a kindness of heart which made every tourist who visited Wicklow his well-wisher. He was also a celebrated agriculturist."], [348, "316 Mr. Breslin \u2014 His magnificent Hotels at Bray. the much-lamented Brennan, wdro built the Inter national Hotel, whose many useful and amiable qualities are recorded in the hearts of his friends. His successful exertions for the improvement of Bray, have left lasting testimonies of his merit with the public. Mr. Edward Breslin is now the ruling spirit of progress and tbe presiding genius of Bray's future prosperity. In his hands the International Hotelh&s risen, Ph\u0153nix-like, from the ashes of decay. The \"Royal Marine Hotel,\" which faces the grand Esplanade of Bray, is also the sole property of Mr. Breslin, This aristocratic and fashionable marine resi dence is patronized by the nobility of Great Britain and Ireland, as well as of France, Italy, and Germany. These spirited and enterprising men, with sustained energy and noble self-reliance, performed their role in the drama of life ; and by their example, excited their countrymen to emulate their virtues and their worth. A writer in the Dublin University Magazine truly says : \u2014 \" Let Irishmen cease to revile or envy Eng land, and seek to emulate, if not to equal her. With more native talent, if prudently directed, and as much energy, if properly sustained, we have but to try, to persevere, and to succeed. Let Ireland plant her young shoots henceforth rather in the soil of principle than that of impulse ; let her girdle her loins with honourable endeavour ; and, above all, casting aside for ever the whine of entreaty and the rags of her mendicancy, let her weave for herself the rough but honest garment of independence \u2014 of the true Dargan pattern \u2014 the robe of self-respect, warmest near the heart, in which she will walk as a queen and a lady, amidst the applause of nations, and shine forth more ' great, glorious, and free,' than ever she could have done had she listened to the voice of agitation, and unsheathed the wild but fruitless sword of rebellion.\" The pithy and brilliant Shiel, in his speech in the House of Commons upon the discussion of the \" Re-"], [349, "Bray \u2014 Its Resident Nobility and Gentry. 317 peal of the Union,\" emphatically exclaimed \u2014 \" What! Repeal the Union !

(the founders of modern Bray), sought no visionary shadows; they effected substantial realities \u2014 and by their peaceful achievements for the advancement and prosperity of their native land, merit more justly living honour, and the grate ful remembrance of posterity, than the proud and triumphant conqueror, who has risen on spoil, rapine, and desolation, to dignities, greatness, and fame. Among the residents and visitors at Bray, the number of distinguished artists is worthy of special comment. When a country is progressing in opu lence and civilization, Art progresses pari passu, and the residence of many of that honoured profession is presumptive, nay, conclusive evidence of the gradual increase of wealth and refinement. May we hope that Art will be more generally diffused through every part of our land* Bray, also, in addition to its natural attractions and the improvements referred to, owes its prosperity to a great extent in being blessed with a resident nobility and gentry Bray and the surrounding *At present Art is almost nothing in Ireland, lt is unpatronised, undervalued, if not despised.

Sir James Ware, in his \" Antiquities of Ireland, \" published in 1639, says, \"Bray Head is a high and large cape, stretching a considerable way into the sea, on the south side of the Bay of Dublin, from which a river and town take their names. Perhaps it was so named from some fancied resemblance it bears to a neck, which is called Braighe in Irish, or from Bri, a hill. The country lying between this town and Dublin was, in the Danish times, called Dubb-Gall, or the lands of the Black Foreigners, who were the Danes, in opposition to Fingall, which lay on the north side of Dublin, and was inhabited by the Norwegians, or White Foreigners. \" Maurice O'Regan, secretary aud interpreter to Deriuod Mac- Morough, King of Leinster, when writing the history of Strong bow's invasion, in the year 1177, says \"Maurice Fitz-Gerald got the county of O'Felin, formerly the estate of Mac-Kelan, lying between Bree and Arcklow.\" In 1173, the manor was granted by the Earl of Pembroke, Lord- Deputy, to Walter de Riddlesford, a Norman adventurer. In 1215, the Abbot of the Monastery of St. Thomas obtained it at a fine of sixty, and an annual rent of three marks. On the dissolution of the monasteries, the manor, with other lands of the above abbey, were granted to Sir Thomas Brabazon, an ancestor of the Earl of Meath, who is the present owner of the fee of the greater part of the town, which is situate in the counties of Dublin and Wicklow, the river Bray being the bouudary between the two counties. Bray town was frequently assailed by the powerful mountain septs, the O'Byrnes and the O'Tooles.

In 1402, a fierce battle took place in Bray between the citizens of Dublin (from the Pale), who were headed by John Drake, their provost. Camden, the historian, says 4,000 of the O'Tooles and the OByrne's were slain, but Hervey aud Marlbrigg, other historians, say 400. Bloody Bank, at Bray, is supposed to derive its name from this battle. THE DARGLE, \"A VERDUROUS WALL OF PARADISE UPRAISED.\" As we stood upon an eminence near one of Lord Powerscourt's beautiful cottages, a new world of rural beauty opened upon us, of rich valleys and mountains covered with wood, melting into air, whilst below a serpentine river glistened in the sun, until it lost itself in the Dargle. Impossible as it is to convey, by verbal painting, a just idea of this exquisite scene, I approach an attempt to describe it with consider- able apprehension. The Dargle is a deep glen, or narrow valley, of about a mile and a half in length. At the entrance where we approached it, opposite to us a beautiful little pleasure-cottage peeped over the ridge of one of the hills which form the green, heathy sides of this glen. It was just discernible in a little plantation which crowned the precipice upon which it stood. This elegant and romantic little summer retreat was raised after the tasteful design of Mrs. H. Grattan, the lady of the illustrious member of that name, to whom it belongs. As we descended by the paths which have been cut through the woods, new beauties opened upon us. The hill, on the sides of which we stood, was covered with trees, principally young oak, projecting with luxuriant foliage from masses of rock half green with moss, which reminded us of Milton's description of the \" Verdurous wall of Paradise upraised. \" Here, concealed by over-arching leaves, the river, like fretful man in his progress through this unequal 2 i;"], [354, "322 A contrast \u2014 The Dargle and Barony of Erris. world, was scarcely heard to ripple ; there it flashed before the eye again, as if in anger at its conceal ment, rolled impetuously over its rocky bed, and roared down a craggy declivity. A little further, having recovered its calmness, it seemed to settle for a while, resembling, in sullen silence and placidity, a dark mirror; then never destined to long tranquillity, it proceeded, and was again lost in arches of foliage, under which it murmured and died upon the ear. It was in this spot, under the green roof of native oaks starting from their rocky beds, sequestered from the theatre of that world upon which he afterwards sustained so distinguished a character, that Grattan, when a very young man, addressed the tumultuous waters as his auditory, and schooled himself, like Demosthenes, in that eloquence which was destined to elevate the glory of Ireland with his own.* We ascended the Lover's-leap, a vast high grey rock, whose base is concealed by sloping trees : it rises higher than any other object, and commands a very extensive view of this verdant scenery, which travellers, who have visited Italy, pronounce to be equal to any spot in that lovely land. Heavens ! what a contrast to tbe luxuriant rich ness of this scenery has Mr. A. Young given us, in his clear and invaluable account of Ireland, when he speaks of that vast, wild, and impenetrable tract of mountain and bog, called the Barony of Erris.

It was once the residence of the eminent Irish author, W. Cooper Walker, who was well known to a large circle of friends for the excellence of his heart, and to the world for the learned and elegant literary productions with which he gratified it. A variety of knowledge, ancient and modern, a long residence in Italy, a correspondence with tlie most distinguished literary men of the age in various parts of the world, a felicity of temper, and a resignation to the hand of Heaven, enabled this elegant scholar to support a long visitation of sickness with perfect serenity. He modestly but forcibly depicted himself in his sequestered retreat of St. Valori, which overshadows the romantic and picturesque cottage of Fassaro/f in his highly interesting \" Historical Memoirs on Italian Tragedy.\" * ' ' The Stranger in Ireland,\" 1805. t \" Soon after my arrival in my native country, ill health obliged me to retire from the busy hum of men ; and I sunk into rural"], [356, "Dermody, the Chattertcm of Ireland. 324 The following beautiful lines were addressed to him at St. Valori, by that extraordinary, early but unfortunate genius, Dermody, the Chatterton of Ire land : \u2014 ' 'Tis thine with fond research to trace The shrinking river's latent vein ; From dust to dig th' imperial face. Or raise to light the lofty strain. ' Then, like the bee, full fraught return, Instruction pour from wisdom's uru, And bid the Alban Graces smile On lost Juverna's barren isle. ' Oh! could'st thou, from some gentle shade, Retrieve the lost, the priceless page, The depths of elder time invade, And brighten blank oblivion's age ! ' The wish is vain : What taste can do, What elegance with sense combiu'd ; Thy learned toil shall bring to view, And nourish the abstracted mind. \" Near St. Valori was an ancient cross, which was removed, in the early part of the 18th century, from the old church in the Glen of Ballyman. Between this cross and St. Valori there are the ruins of the Castle of Fassaro, which once guarded this pass into the mountains. Dean Kirwan, one of the greatest devotional ora tors that ever appeared since the days of Massillon, was a constant visitor at St. Valori.

The principle which forms its groundwork is, I am glad to inform you, of the most liberal and expanded nature. Children of all religious persuasions may be educated without any attempt on the part of their gover nors to instil sentiments contrary to the judgment and choice of their parents. Such perfect religious liberty must ever recom mend similar establishments to men of enlarged ideas, who (be their own mode of worship what it may) will always unite in their support upon the broad and generous ground of philanthropy alone. Philanthropy, my friends, is of no particular sect ; it is con fined by no paltry form of rule ; it knows no distinction but that of the happy and unhappy ; it is older than the Gospel, eternal as that great source from whence it springs, and often beats higher in the heathen's breast than in those of many who are called Christians, who, though under the influence of the most benevolent of all possible systems, yet not unfrequently refuse both relief and compassion to the petition of the wretched, and the entreaty of the unhappy. God forbid that the genuine feelings of the heart were confined to this or that mode of faith ! God forbid that any ridiculous prejudice should hinder me from reverencing the man (however we may differ in speculative notions) whose gentle spirit flies out to soothe the mourner ; whose ear is attentive to the voice"], [358, "326 Want of Humanity and the Vanity of Wealth. of sorrow; whose pittance is shared with those who are not the world's friends; whose bountiful hand scatters food to the hungry, and raiment to the naked ; and whose peaceful steps, as he jour neyeth on his way, are blessed, and blessed again by the uplifted eye of thankful indigence, and the sounds of honest gratitude from the lips of wretchedness. Should such a man be ill-fated here, or hereafter, may his fate be light ! Should he transgress, may his transgressions be unrecorded ! Or, if the page of his great account be stained with the weaknesses of human nature, or the misfortune of error, may the tears of the widow and the orphan, the tears of the wretched he has relieved, efface the too rigid and unfriendly characters, and blot out the guilt and remembrance of them for ever. WANT OP HUMANITY. \"The individual whose life is dedicated to a constant warfare with his passions, whose life is a scene of temperance, sobriety, assiduous prayer, and unremitting attendance on divine worship, such an individual is certainly entitled to all the merit justly due to such Christian works ; but, my friends, if, under so fair and plausible a surface, there be a dark and frightful void ; if, under the show of virtue, the stream of sensibility does not flow, if such a character, pure and evaugelical as it may appear, has never been marked by one solitary act of humanity, by any instance of that brotherly affection and mutual love which hourly breaks out into offices of mercy aud useful beneficence, who will hesitate to avow that so specious an exterior is a mockery on true virtue, an impo sition on the good sense of the world, and an insult on the life of Christ and the morality of His Gospel ? Who will hesitate to admit that such a man may be aptly compared to a mountain remarkable for sterility and elevation, which encumbers the earth with its pressure, while it chills all around with its shade ?

PRIDE. \" How often have we seen the column of pride, erected upon the basis of infamy, and just when it hath begun to attract the gape and stare of the adulatory multitude, death, like a rocky fragment rolling from the mountain, crumbles into nothing the imaginary colossus.

True liberality is more \u2014 it is expanded as the earth, stimulates the bosom to promiscuous bene volence, urges it to feel and to relieve the distresses of Turk or Jew as readily, and with as much warmth as those of the indigent who raise their hands within those walls ; it wafts the mind over the waste of oceans into distant hemispheres, to let fall a tear at the couch of the afflicted infidel, as well as at the bed of a sufferer of our communion; these are the operations of this beautiful and angelic virtue, and are the pride and glory of every great soul . Thank God ! that in the age aud land we live, religion is at length. becomiug free and natural, aud that all zealous contentions about particular systems are now clearly discovered to be unfriendly to the true interests of the community, as well as the peace and hap piness of the world. Thank God ! the day is rapidly advancing (and it is a day we should all look forward to with rapture and delight) when every citizen may think as he pleases upon subjects of religion, and freely offer sacrifice in whatever temple his incli nation and opinions point to\u2014 the day, aud I will call it the glo rious day, when all religious societies, all ranks and degrees of men, will be collected together by one common and eudearing tie of Christian benevolence and love ; when the rancour of parties will cease, the altars of uncharitableness cease to smoke ; the illiberal, narrow, and sophisticated reasonings of bigotry be drowned in the vast and public cry of an enlarged philanthropy ; the hoary and venerable tyrant, superstition, plucked from his throne ; when the frivolous and ridiculous contest about primoge niture will be no more ; and the God of benevolence, of humanity, of mutual forbearance, and ardent charity, appear in the threshold of every sanctuary, and obtain an undisputed empire in every heart. Thank God ! that day is advancing \u2014 1 know it \u2014 I feel it, I can assert it ; a period devoutly to be wished for ; and, perhaps, the first opening since the Christian era of human happiness. If there is yet some prejudice, it is giving way; it must give way to liberal inquiry; it must retreat to the dark, uncultivated corners of the earth, and of course perish where it cannot grow. The tears of a few fanatics may accompany its fall ; but I believe that every man who wishes to see the glorious restoration of reason, its dig nity unfettered, and the dominion of real vital religion established ; every man who has at heart the enlargement of human nature, and wishes to see the peace of society established upon a secure and permanent basis, will joyfully sing to its requiem, and manfully exert himself to oppose its second appearance in the world. \" On the day when Dr. Kirwan preached every avenue used to be crowded long before he ascended the pulpit.

The sure mark of a good preacher is his being much followed and much applauded. The Rev. Walter Blake Kirwan stands first in reputation for pulpit eloquence in this kingdom. His sermons are rather orations, resembling those of the Gregories and Chrysostoms in their most popular discourses. They touch on no controversial points, which most unchristianly inflame the minds of one sect against another, and prepare them for blood and slaughter, rather than the practice of the milder charities of the Gospel. They are not theological dissertations, on thorny, dark, and disputed points of divinity, which bewilder the best understandings, and fill the weaker with gloomy notions. Is it possible, with our present limited faculties, to fathom, or by lan guage to explain, the mysteries of the Trinity, of election, and grace % Simple belief of these and other incomprehensible doctrines, is only necessary for salvation ; their investigation is far beyond the powers of our reasoning faculties ; whatever divines have written concerning them are mere phantasms; as ideal as tbe celestial illuminations of Baron Sweden borg, or his conversations with angelic spirits in the New Jerusalem. Mr. Kirwan administers no such unsolid food to his hearers, which may inflate but never can supply healthful nutriment. Neither does he waste his time in an useless display of subtle reasoning, nor metaphysical refinement, or in detail ing curious erudition, the result of critical and extensive reading ; these he relinquishes for matters of more general and higher importance.

The drawing rooms are also very elegant; the avenues to the house beautiful; and the park, spread over the mountain, uncommonly fine.\" \u2014 \" The Stranger in Ireland,\" 1805. * See Appendix \u2014 Tinnahinch. 2 s"], [362, "SECTION XL HOWTH, OR BEN-ED AR. On the right of Dublin Bay is the rugged hill of Howth, with its caves and rocky indentations, want ing only a volcano to afford to the surrounding scenery the strongest resemblance to the beautiful Bay of Naples. On a summer day Ben-Edar appears in all its majesty. The softening hand of distance would seem as it were to cover its craggy sides with a russet robe. \" Its natural wildness of scenery and sub limity of prospect, early attracted to it the attention of all who could feel interested in such associations. The cairn-crowned height of Sleivemartin is one of the landward summits of Howth first seen from the Irish Sea. The summit of Howth is elevated 578 feet above low water-mark. The north-eastern side of the hill presents somewhat of the appearance of a miniature Gibraltar. Dalton says that it was anciently called Ben-na-dair, as it is supposed from the quantity of venerable oaks that then waved over its fertile declivities, and religiously shadowed one of those pagan altars or cromlechs, which yet remain attributable to a species of the Magian priest hood.\"* * ' ' Aid me to pierce the shade of ancient days : The \u00e6ras lost, assist me to regain ; Those wrapt in song amidst the sylvan reign : * * * # Whose date the antique sage hath sought in vain ; Which braves the wreck of time and swift decay, That sweeps the labour'd domes of man away."], [363, "Dean Swift, a Visitor at Hoivth Castle. 331 Corr Castle, a small square tower, is all that re mains of the ancient castle of the Earls of Howth \u2014 Their modern residence is a long battlemented struc ture, flanked by square towers \u2014 the spacious hall of which is furnished with relics of antiquity, while in the saloon are several fine paintings and portraits, especially one of Dean Swift, by Bindon. It was painted in 1735, and represents him in his clerical costume, with Wood at his feet, to the right of the picture, writhing in agony. Dean Swift had been a frequent visitor at Howth Castle. In one of his letters, in 1734, he writes : \" The weather, yesterday, being very fine, I rode to Howth Castle, and as I was getting on horse-back to Time that from brass doth characters efface, And drops the cloud-hid turret to its base, Throws the symmetric temple to the ground, Its site forgot nor marble columns found : * * * * How vain ! \u2014 to plan, to rear the immortal dome ; While this rude pile hath countless ages stood The sap of time, and stemm'd oblivious flood ; Mysterious circles, from your gloom'd recess, The priest, perchance, the implicit train might bless, For furious Odin might obtest the skies, And bless a hetacomb for sacrifice. While from this fane, just opening to the skies, Their mystic rites and hid oblations rise, Still by what powers raised, \u2014 remains unseen ; Nature's august retreats are better known. ***** Hark the burst anthem swells its notes around, And structur'd rocks grow vocal with the sound ; For now the Druids seek their inmost place, Recess rever'd \u2014 forbid but to their race, To their high priest a reverent train succeed, With sacred mistletoe for rights decreed, The hallow'd parasites from oak they drew, Cut by the empyreal bill now borne to view. The Druid sisters rais'd the sacred mound, Their mantling coifs with holy fillets bound, Each in her dexter hand an oak-branch bears ; Whose viscid leaves the etherial honey bears, Those mystic rights no Druid dare unfold, Enwrapt from sight, and never must be told.\""], [364, "332 Howth \u2014 Its Book, Bells, and Abbey. return, I was seized with so cruel a fit of that gid dinesss which at times had pursued me from my youth, that I was forced to lie down on a bed for two hours before I was in a condition to ride.\" The harbour of Howth cost \u00a3300,000, which did not ad mit vessels of large burthen or great draught. So injudicious was its location that, had it been con structed but one furlong to the eastward of its present situation, the navy of Great Britain might have been moored within it, sheltered from the prevailing winds, in a safe anchorage, and a depth of water uninfluenced by ebb or flow of tide. This harbour, so dearly pur chased by the nation, has been superseded by the one at Kingstown, and another generation may traverse the mossy causeway, and vainly seek the spot where the first English Monarch landed in 1821 (George IV.), who came in peace to Ireland. One of the few specimens of Gothic pointed archi tecture which the county of Dublin affords, is to be found in the venerable remains of the ancient Abbey of Howth, which is picturesquely situated on an emi nence overlooking tbe sea. The orginal bells of this abbey are still preserved at the castle. The \"Book of Howth,\" compiled in this abbey, which contains a romantic chronicle of Irish affairs from A. D. 432, is yet extant. The plain of Moynalty, which can be seen from Howth, is that rich tract of tillage and pasture, extending from Clontarf over the northern part of the county of Dublin, and forming part of the more extensive plain of Bregia. It was called by the Irish \" Plain of Flocks,\" from the flocks of birds re sorting to it ; \" When through the wintry air The wide- winged wild geese to their pools by Liffey's side repair.\" and received its name of \"The Old Plain\" \u2014 Sean Mhagh Ealta \u2014 from the traditionary tale that, of all the other plains in Ireland, this is the only one"], [365, "A Sublime Link in Religion. 333 which never was covered with forest, but was always a \" place of flocks and herds.\" Howth is connected with the mainland by a dreary and uncultivated isthmus. On this isthmus, close to the sea, are the interesting ruins of the church of Kilbarrack.* Dalton, in his admirable work on the Topography, &c, of the co. Dublin, offers the following remarks on the ancient graveyard of Killbarrack : \u2014 \"Unretarded by wall or ditch, or fence, the visitor, gliding among a few sodden and slippery graves, and forming his steps by the headstones and crosses that distinguish them, finds himself in the once votive chapel of the mariners who frequented the Bay of Dublin, and at whose altar, on their arrival, they had prayers offered up for the souls of those of their mess mates who perished at sea ; a dutiful commemoration, which, however, some may deem superstitious, is the sublimest link in the religion of the Roman Catholic \u2014 the link that prolongs communication with the parent, the relative, and the friend, on whom this world is closed for ever. . . . The architectural appearance of Kilbarrack chapel is not imposing, only exhibiting some circular and pointed arches, without any visible remains of a steeple or belfry ; * The frequent recurrence of the names of places beginning with Kill, is not a little alarming to a stranger in Ireland, more espe cially if he be under the influence of those stupid prejudices which have been excited against this country. I have just enumerated in my memory no less than forty-nine of those Kill places. The name produced the followiug ridiculous mistake during the re bellion of '98 : \u2014 A soldier, a native of Devonshire, who was stationed at an outpost, stopped a couutryman, and demanded who he was, whence he came from, and whither he was going. The fellow replied : \" And my name, my dear honey, is Kilbride ; d'ye see, I've just been to Kill/many, and am going to Killmore, \" upon which the sentinel immediately seized him, expecting to receive a high reward for having apprehended a most sanguinary rebel, by con fession, just come from murder, and going to a fresh banquet of blood.\" \u2014 Carr's Tour in Ireland, 1805."], [366, "334 The \" Garland of Howth.\" the vista and sections of prospect, however, as framed by the arches and windows of the ruins, afford a series of views which cannot fail to gratify the commonest observer, and even well to recommend the artist. A broken tombstone in the graveyard has now ceased to record the once celebrated Higgins, well known by the soubriquet of the ' SHAM SQUIRE.' \" There is a peculiar freshness and purity in the atmosphere of Howth. So far back as the sixth century, this characteristic of its scenery was felt, and beatifully expressed in a poem, which is attri buted to St. Columba : \u2014 \" Delightful to be on Ben-Edar, Before going o'er the white sea ; Delightful the dashing of the wave against its face, The bareness of its shore and its border.\" In old Irish topography, Bregh and Edar were brothers, who gave their names to the two headlands now known as Bray Head and Howth. Howth (Hoved) is a Norse word, signifying \" head.\" The native Irish still know the hill as Ben Edar, and Ireland's Eye as Inis Meic Nessain, or \" Island of the Sons of Nessan.'' This beautiful islet, in the day of Ossian, bore the name of Inis-Faithlenn, or Inis fallen. It was not till three centuries later that it became the abode of the sons of Nessan \u2014 three holy men, brothers, who here became eminent for piety and learning, and from whom it took its second name of Inis Meic Nessan. In the Felire Aengus, a calendar of Irish Saints, it is said of these holy men, \" The sons of Nessan, of this island, loved the true knowledge of Christ.\" The remains of their stone oratory and round tower may still be traced near the beech on the side of the island towards Howth. Here was preserved, and probably executed, the re markable manuscript copy of the Gospels, called the \"Garland of Howth.\" The history of this wonder ful book, with those of Kells, Durrow, Kildare and"], [367, "\" Wonderful\" Books of K ells, Durrow, &c. 335 Armagh, must prove interesting to every Irishman. It is from the pen of the late Dr. Petrie. The love of ornament would seem to be an in stinct in human nature ; and some will even say that beauty in decorative art is a more healthy and de sirable thing for a nation than beauty in the painting of pictures and the carving of statues ; just as to use the illustration of a modern writer, \" A nation blessed with lovely national melodies is better off, as a musical people, than one which, without these, might produce here and there a composer of lofty symphonies and oratorios.\" Whatever truth is to be found in this statement, we may, at all events, feel a just pride in the knowledge that the Irish nation was possessed of this gift, this instinctive power of expressing the beautiful, both in form and sound, of which we have so many proofs, as well in the specimens still preserved of their ancient illuminated manuscripts, sculptured stones, and jewellery, as in the stores of ancient melodies that have descended to us from the past. It is acknowledged by the best writers on the sub ject that the Irish monks, from the fifth to the end of the eleventh century, brought the art of ornamenting manuscripts to marvellous perfection ; and it would appear that the Scoto-Celtic form of this art spread from Ireland through Western Europe, carried by those men whose love and reverence for the sacred writing found expression in the beauty of line and splendour of colour wherewith they delighted to adorn their copies of them. The most remarkable specimen of this art now existing is the \" Book of Kells,\" so called from having been preserved in the great Abbey Church of Kells, in the diocese of Meath. It was saved from destruction by James Usher, who was Bishop of Meath from the year 1621 to 1024, and was found in his library, which, having been con fiscated during the Commonwealth, was granted by"], [368, "An Illuminated Copy of the Gospels. 336 Charles II., on the Restoration, to Trinity College, and thus the \"Book of Kells\" passed into the possession of that body, with whom it has since remained. \" The Garland of Howth,\" is preserved in the library of Trinity College, Dublin. It is an illumi nated copy of the Gospels, spoken of by Archbishop Allen and by Usher as the \" Cethar Leabhar\" \u2014 the Four Books. It belonged originally to the Church of Inis Meic Nessan, or the Island of the Sons of Nessan, a de scendant of Cathair Mor, King of Ireland, by whose sons, in the seventh century, the Church of Inis Meic Nessain, now Ireland's Eye, was founded. Part of the tower belonging to this building was standing within the last few years, and some remains of the church may still be seen. The ornamentation of \" The Garland of Howth \" bears all the marks of the highest antiquity. The frontispiece of the Gospel of St. Matthew, with that of St. Mark, still remains in tolerable preservation. On the first page, surrounded by interlaced orna mental work, two figures may be seen, both bearded ; the first with upraised hands, the second holding a sword in one hand and a book in the other. In the frontispiece to St. Mark there is a figure standing at a desk, the face beardless, the hands folded in prayer. All three heads are without the nimbus. The \"Book of Dimna\" is a copy of the Gospels, written about the seventh century, which contains representations of each of the Evangelists in a very rude style of art. At the end of the MS. the scribe has thus inscribed his name : \" Finit. Amen. $f Dimma Mace Nath. \u00bbJi \" This Dimma is believed to be the scribe men tioned in the life of St. Cronan, who lived A.D. 634, as employed by him to write a copy of the Gospels"], [369, "A Monument of Christian Antiquity. 337 This book was preserved at the Abbey of Roscrea, founded by Cronan. The \"Book of St. Moling\" exhibits internal evi- dence of having been written in the seventh century, as it contains the name of the saint in autograph, who was Bishop of Ferns, A.D. 600. The \"Liber Hymnorum \" is a beautiful manu- script, which cannot be assigned to a later date than the tenth or eleventh century, and was believed by Usher to have been, in his time, one thousand years old. It may safely be pronounced one of the most venerable monuments of Christian antiquity now remaining in Europe. It is ornamented in a very beautiful and elaborate manner, the illuminated letters exhibiting the same style of art as that found in the other MSS., and coloured with yellow, blue, and green.* The \" Book of Armagh \" is most remarkable for the exquisite delicacy of execution and elegant forms of its initial letters ; the whole writing in the book, indeed, is a wonderful specimen of penmanship. The date of this book has been determined by Dean Graves, who has proved it to have been written by Ferdomnach, described, in the \"Annals of the Four Masters,\" as \" a sage and choice scribe of the Church of Armagh,\" who copied out this manuscript, while Torbach, himself a scribe, was Abbot of Armagh, A.D. 808. There is reason to believe that this Fer- domnach retired to end his days at Clonmacnois, when Armagh was plundered by the Danes, in 831 ; and the late Dr. Petrie has found at Clonmacnois a tombstone bearing his name, which is most probably that of the Armagh Ferdomnach.

This Gospel was found, after twenty nights and two months, with its gold stolen off, and a sod over it.\" It is scarcely possible to doubt that the book now in the library of Trinity College, Dublin, is \"the large Gospel of Columbkille,\" to which this record refers. That it belonged to the church of Kells in the eleventh century is evident, from the curious charters relating to the clergy of Kells which it con tains ; and it continued among the treasures of that"], [371, "The \" Wonderful Book of Kildare.\" 339 church down to the time of Archbishop Usher ; that is to say, down to the seventeenth century, for which fact we have the archbishop's own testimony. It may also be brought forward as evidence in favour of the antiquity of the book, that many manuscripts of the same style of art, and of equal beauty, seem to have existed in Ireland at this early time. Thus we cannot omit to mention another great copy of the Gospels, which was preserved in the Cathedral of Kildare up to the twelfth century. This has been de scribed by Giraldus Cambrensis, who came into Ireland as secretary to Prince John, A.D. 1185, and his account of it might seem, indeed, to have been written as a description of the \" Book of Kells \" itself, so exactly does it apply to that book. \" Of all the wonders of Kildare,\" he says, \" I have found nothing more wonderful than that mar vellous book, written in the time of the Virgin (St. Bridgid), and, as they say, at the dictation of an angel. The book contains the concordance of the Evangelists, every page of which is filled with divers figures, most accurately marked out with various colours. Here you behold a majestic face, divinely drawn ; there the mystical forms of the Evangelists, each having \u2014 sometimes six, sometimes four, and sometimes two wings \u2014 here an eagle, there a calf ; there, again, a human face, or a lion, and other figures of infinite variety, so closely wrought toge ther, that if you looked carelessly at them, they would seem rather like a uniform blot than an equisite interweaving of figures, exhibiting no skill or art, where all is skill and perfection of art. But if you look closely, with all the acuteness of sight that you can command, and examine the inmost secrets of that wondrous art, you will discover such delicate, such subtle, such fine and closely- wrought lines, twisted and interwoven in such intricate knots, and adorned with such fresh and brilliant colours, that you will readily"], [372, "The Book of Durrow. 340 acknowledge the whole to have been the result of angelic, rather than human skill.

But whatever doubt may be felt as to the exact date of \" The Book of Kells, no doubt whatever can be entertained as to the age of the \" Book of Durrow,\" the writing of which is also ascribed to St. Columba, and in which there are illuminations of the same style of art, though inferior in beauty of execution ; for, in this manuscript, we find the usual request of the Irish scribe for a prayer from the reader, expressed in the following words : \u2014 \" Rogo beatitudinem tuam sancte pr\u00e6sbiter Pa trici, ut quicunque hunc libellum manu tenuerit meminerit Columb\u00e6 scriptores qui hoc scripsi ipse met evangelium per xii. dierum spatium gratia Domini nostri.\" \" I pray thy blessedness, Oholy presbyter, Patrick, that whosoever shall take this book into his hands, may remember the writer Columba, who have myself written this gospel in the space of twelve days, by the grace of our Lord.\" An inscription in Irish was found upon the ancient Cumdach, or shrine, which was made for this work, by Flann, King of Ireland, who reigned A.D. 879-916. This shrine, or cover, has long been missing, but a copy of the inscription is preserved, and is thus translated : \u2014 \" The Prayer and Benediction of St. Colum kille be upon flann, the son of malachi, King of Ireland, who caused this Cover to BE MADE.\""], [373, "Ferguson's Ode \u2014 The \" Cromlech on Howth.\" 341 This book, which was preserved at Durrow down to the Reformation, was given to the library of Trinity College, Dublin, by Dr. Jones, Bishop of Meath, A.D. 1584, in whose bishopric the church of Durrow was situated. The \" Psalter of Ricemarch\" is a manuscript beau tifully executed, with illuminations which exhibit the same style of art, but the ornamentation of which is less in design than the \" Book of Armagh.\" . The central spaces of the capitals are filled with plain colour, and bear a striking resemblance to those in the \"Book of Leinster,\" a book of the twelfth century. In the seventeenth century this Psalter passed into the possession of Bishop Bedell, Provost of Tri nity College, A.D. 1627, and by whom the MS. was presented to the University. Interesting evidence of the literary reputation which Ireland enjoyed up to the end of the eleventh century, occurs in the \" Life of Sulgen,\" who was Bishop of St. David's about the year 1070, in a poem, written by his son John, and in which we read that Sulgen came to Ireland to study there for ten or thirteen years, when that country was still termed sacred, and \" a workshop of men famous for learning and sanctity.\" \" It would then appear that for a period of not less than six or seven centuries, Ireland possessed a school of art, which seems to have spread its in fluence over a large portion of Western Europe.\"* The following are extracts from this highly des criptive poem : \u2014 * Extracted from the valuable Notes on Ornamentation, given in the \" Cromlech on Howth :\" A Poem, by Samuel Ferguson, Q.C., M.R.

Howth \u2014 Its Historical Associations. The Hill of Howth is celebrated in the most ancient annals of Ireland as the place of settlement of Partholanus and his colony. The celebrated Fin Ma Coule and his band made Howth one of his great military stations, in the fourth century. Howth was devastated by the Danes in the ninth century. Sitric, the converted Dane, bestowed, in 103S, a considerable part of the lands of Howth, and the adjoining country, on his ecclesiastical foundations, and is also said to have built the church here. Sir Armoricus Tristram, one of the most active adventurers during the English invasion, landed at Howth, with Sir John De Courcy, at the head of a chosen band. The place was then inhabited by Danes. They defeated them in a signal engage ment at the bridge of Evora, the mountain stream that falls into the sea at the north side of Howth, opposite Inis Meic Nessain (Ireland's Eye). Sir Armoricus acquired the Lordship of Howth and the title of St. Laurence, in honour of the day of battle. The sword with which he fought is still exhibited amongst the relics at Howth Castle. St. Laurence and De Courey made a compact in the Church of Rouen to unite their fortunes in arms, and abide its dangers aud rewards. At one time a pattern was annually held on the Hill of Howth, on St. Laurence's day, to commemo rate this victory. Some time ago, when sinking the foundation for the new church, a large quantity of bones, an antique anvil, bridle, bits, and portions of horse armour, were found. In 1375, the King directed that proclamation should be made within the Lordship of Howth, that none should cross the sea from Ireland, merchants excepted, without license from the crown. In 1449, Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York, father of Ed ward IV., landed at Howth, as Lord Lieutenant. Sir Nicholas St. Laurence, the sixteenth Lord of Howth, was devoted to the interests of the House of Lancaster, and, during the frenzy that shook Ireland from its propriety and allegiance in the cause of Lambert Simnel, was one of those who most faith fully defended King Henry's title. He afterwards did homage before Sir Richard Edgecome, in the great chamber at St. Thomas's Court, Dublin. He died in 1526, and was buried with his ancestors in Howth Abbey. In 1539, the celebrated \"Silken Thomas,\" in the Geraldine"], [377, "Celebrated Irish Authors, &c. 345 rebellion, had artillery placed on Howth, and from its commanding height cannonaded the English ships that were sent to reduce him. In 1641, Howth was established a navy station by the Lords of the Pale for Leinster. In 1690, King William is said to have slept in Howth Castle. The Baily Light-house is situated on the most southerly point of Ben-Edar. The Bay of Dublin, from this point, is one of the most beautiful scenes the eye cau repose upon. Projecting far into the sea, at the end of a long white line, is the Poolbeg Light house, which resembles a figure of white marble rising out of the ocean. According to tradition, the Baily Light-house is the spot where, on the memorable battle of Clontarf (fought on Good Friday, April 23, 1014), the most obstinate of the discomfited Danes retired, insulated the promontory of Howth, and defended themselves until they were carried off by the vessels of their countrymen. \"Night closed around the warriors's way, And lightning showed the distant hill.

The ceremonial of laying the foundation stone of the proposed new harbour at the Coolamore, Dalkey, took place on the 9th September, 1868. James Milo Burke, Esq., J.P., on presenting him self for that purpose, was received with a warm and cordial greeting. He expressed his deep sense of the honour, privi lege, and duty devolving upon him as Chairman of the Commissioners. He had been elected to that responsible office by his esteemed fellow Commissioners on the formation of the township, and he was extremely gratified that he had retained their confidence during the five years of their arduous and useful labours \u2014 but no circumstance more impressed him with the honour of that position than the present, enabling him to take a principal part in laying the foundation stone of a new pier \u2014 as the port of Dalkey had been at all times to him an object of the greatest interest. The general management of the township was, he was justified in saying, carried out by the Commis sioners with undeviating rectitude of purpose and"], [382, "The Coolamore Harbour \u2014 J. M. Burke's Speech. 350 solicitude, ever keeping prominently in view the improvement of Dalkey as the sole object of their exertions. The work so auspiciously to be inaugurated to-day is but the prelude to many important improvements designed by the Commissioners. In due time, and having due regard to the limited finances at their dis posal, these improvements will be accomplished. Compare the present prosperous position of Dalkey with the past \u2014 not many years since it was a bar ren, rocky, yet picturesque waste, dotted over by squatters' huts, and inhabited solely by the poorest and humblest classes of society, including the work men employed in the great and valuable granite quarries. Now, magnificent terraces and beautiful villas \u2014 occupied by the wealthy and princely merchants, and elite of the medical profession of the city of Dublin, and the most refined and fashionable circles of society, legal and other professions \u2014 attest the wonderful magnitude of the change. But recently a poor and inconsiderable village, to-day we see an extensive town arise around us, with a large and increasing population, requiring the management and constant superintendence of a corporate body, selected by the people themselves. When, in 1834, his father and himself made their first purchases of land in this district, they were con sidered as bereft of their senses. It was not believed that they would be allowed to retain their acquisitions \u2014 but that the people (termed Squatters) who were unjustly, and without good reason, stigmatised as \" lawless ruffians,\" would forcibly resume occupation in the same manner as they had originally appro priated the land. The prophecy was not verified; the aspersion cast upon these poor but honest men was proved to be unjustifiable. These evil forebodings did not deter nor divert his father or himself from treating with the humble occupiers of the soil, on"], [383, "The Sacred Principles of Justice. 351 equitable terms ; they resolved to confide in the squatters \u2014 to treat them liberally and fairly for what they had to dispose of. The squatters were perfectly satisfied with their terms, and they fulfilled their en gagements honourably and faithfully. Thus relying on the sacred principles of justice im planted by nature in the mind of man, and in no portion of the human race more deeply than in our own fellow-countrymen, and resolving to act upon the golden rule \" to do unto others as we would wish that they would do unto us,\" we proceeded in our course fearlessly. We were justified in our confidence by the result. The squatters on their side received the just reward of their fidelity \u2014 they had constant and good em ployment, with liberal wages. By them the barren waste was reclaimed; new roads and avenues laid out and constructed. Some purchasers did not act in this spirit \u2014 dealing fairly and liberally. His father denounced their sordid and illiberal selfishness, and declared that he would do all he could to make Dalkey the admiration of the kingdom, in despite of every obstacle. \" You may thwart me,\" said his father, \" but neither you nor those who act with you shall scare me from my purpose.\" In opening and widening the roads \u2014 in some places barely eight feet wide \u2014 many difficulties were en countered, but happily all have been successfully overcome. Some who caused these difficulties have gone to their account \u2014 some remain, and see their former mistaken views and errors ; and now all pull together harmoniously. I have refrained from stat ing names. I wish from my heart all bitterness and unpleasant recollections to be obliterated from our minds ; all animosities and ill-feeling to be buried in the past \u2014 all our hopes, aspirations and united efforts to be directed to the welfare of Dalkey for the future."], [384, "352 Dalkey and her Granite Quarries. On the rock overhead (said Mr. Burke pointing to the tablet cut thereon), I had the Irish name of \" Coola more inscribed, with a short history of some remark able events which occurred at the place. I regret extremely that some mischievous and ill-disposed persons (no doubt enemies of Dalkey), have wan tonly and maliciously defaced the tablet, and nearly erased the inscription. Mr. Burke concluded his address by reverting to the interesting ceremony of the day, and entered into some details about the Port; \u201e '\u201e ... The port of Dalkey was at one time (he stated), designed as the site of an asylum harbour. Howth, and ultimately Kingstown, or rather Dunleary, was preferred, and the many natural advantages of Dalkey overlooked. A large grant has been expended in the construction of Kingstown harbour, which is, after all, insecure from the disastrous effects of storms from the N. E., and inadequate to the requirements of commerce ; so that an extension is under consider ation. What a magnificent harbour, perfectly land locked, and safe from every wind that blows, could have been raised at Dalkey at a comparatively small outlay ; and \u2014 strange caprice of fortune \u2014 the very stones of Dalkey, from her granite quarries, have been made to contribute to the greatness of her favoured rival.

Mr. Parkinson proposed the health of their worthy host, Mr. Cunningham, and referred to the extensive works which, in the course of his career as a contrac tor, he had executed.

The harbour commenced that day would be a work of which Mr. Cunningham would be proud.

Mr. Cunningham,* who was most warmly received, returned thanks in appropriate terms, and gave the health of their universally esteemed and talented friend, Mr. Henry Parkinson,-f- who had already done so much good for the public institutions of the country (loud applause). * Mr. Cunningham is a gentleman who has been reared in that school of self-reliance, progress, and enterprise, founded by Dar gan, in which patieuce, untiring energy, and persevering industry were strictly inculcated. The origin of this school may be attri buted to the Irish Industrial Exhibition of 1853, on which occa sion, William Dargan, the man with his \"hand in his pocket,\" refused a baronetcy, so graciously offered by Her Majesty the Queen. How applicable to such men are the following lines of the great poet, Pope : \u2014 \" Bid harbours open, public ways extend, Bid temples worthier of the God ascend, Bid the broad arch the dangerous flood contain, The mole projected break the roaring main ; Back to his bounds their subject sea command, And roll obedient rivers through the land. These honours peace to hopeful Ireland brings \u2014 These are imperial works, and worthy kings.\" t The author takes the opportunity of remarking that there are but few gentlemen who have rendered, during the past few years, so many and so distinguished public services to his fellow-citizens and the country at large, as Mr. Henry Parkinson, and that with out any adequate recompense, or Government recognition, for the time he has lost, which otherwise might have been profitably em ployed in professional pursuits. It is, therefore, but common justice to briefly allude to one or two events in the history of this country with which Mr. Parkinson's name has been closely con nected. In the year 1860, he was invited to take the post of Secretary to the Committee of the Royal Dublin Society's Fine Art Exhibition of 1861, and which, owing in a great measure to the exertions of Mr. Parkinson, in procuring works of art in Eng land and elsewhere, and to his subsequent spirited management, was allowed to be not only one of the most interesting collections of"], [387, "Mr. Parkinson and the Nine Apothecaries. 355 Mr. Parkinson responded, and, speaking of the healthy character of Dalkey, stated that he had known nine apothecaries obliged to leave the place from want of business (great laughter). He proposed the Municipal Corporations of Ireland, coupled with Fine Arts, for its size, ever brought together in Ireland, but a pecu- niary success. At the close of that Exhibition, it occurred to Mr. Parkinson that a permanent institution, analogous to that of the Crystal Palace in London, might be formed with advantage to the City of Dublin ; and the Author can bear witness to the fact, that he was consulted on the subject by Mr. Parkinson, before he commenced to organize the Winter Garden Company. That to Mr. Parkinson's exertions, at least at the commencement, must be attributed the erection (no matter what may be its fate) of the noble building which now stands next Stephen's Green, at Earls - fort-terrace ; and, further, that Mr. Parkinson was instrumental in causiug the building to be opened with the International Exhi- bition of 1865, which was, undoubtedly, a great success, and brought thousands from all parts of the world into Ireland. Rail- way directors, in their reports, still allude to their receipts that year. The foregoing facts are verified by the following recorded words of the late lamented member for Dublin, Sir B. L. Guin- ness, Bart, when presiding at a public meeting, at which Mr. Parkinson was presented with an address by the citizens : \u2014 \"Mr. Parkinson, from my very long knowledge of you, and more especially from recent and continual observation of your zeal and efficient assistance in bringing to so successful a termination our great enterprise, the International Exhibition, I can bear my testimony to its success being greatly owing to your unwearied attention and exertion. I have also had an opportunity of know- ing your courtesy and kindness to visitors that came there. I am sorry to say it was not followed up by others, to whom I shall not allude ; but the fact only rendered your kindness and exertions the more conspicuous. \" The Exhibition could not have been held had not the previous undertaking been accomplished of building the Palace. Knowing something of the origin of that Palace, and the way in which it was got up, I can state that the citizens are indebted to you, and one or two others, for that magnificent building. I, therefore, feel not only a pleasure but a pride, in presenting to you this testimonial, as an expression of esteem and approbation for the manner in which you discharged your duties as Secretary of the Exhibition.\" Mr. Parkinson, at the close of the Exhibition, published the magnificent book, at an outlay of \u00a3600, recording the principal features of the Exhibition, with descriptions of existing Irish manufactures, and the products of different countries.

He alluded to the original formation of municipal institutions. \" In the middle ages,\" he said, \" when trade was in its infancy, they were designed to defend the Burghers from lawless aggression and rapine. By their means, the germs of freedom in the municipal towns, were nurtured to maturity, and a firm basis laid, on which great and thriving centres of commer cial industry were raised to greatness, power and magnificence. \"In this enlightened age of reason and civilization, the arts of peace prevail \u2014 mutual defence is not now the essential object of municipal associations. \" The peace, progress, and prosperity of each and every community, now virtually and mainly depend on the due and faithful discharge of the important functions which devolve on the several municipal bodies in the different cities and towns through the kingdom. \" It is well,\"continued Alderman Manning, \" to see municipal institutions extending under the provisions of the Towns' Improvement Act, in all directions \u2014 and a certain recognition of their general public utility, as well as a sure indication of commercial progress, and national civilization.\" The worthy Alderman then dwelt upon the impor tant and arduous business transacted by the Dublin Cor poration. He said \"he did not claim to be a frequent niary loss to Mr. Parkinson.

You are all aware that the society now assembled, the Tayleur Fund Committee, was es- tablished in 1854 on the occurrence of the lamentable disaster, when the Tayleur was lost off the coast at Lambay, and several hundred persons met with a watery grave. The circumstance at the time created great attention. It was melancholy in the extreme.

After satisfying every demand on the Tayleur fund, there was a considerable surplus ; and upon considera tion it appeared to us that it could not be devoted t.> a better purpose than providing for the necessities of the shipwrecked, and rewarding the exertions of those who were foremost in rescuing victims from a watery grave. We have frequently given donations for this purpose, and, although they have not been made in the public manner of our proceeding this day, I think, without any feeling or any wish to show ostentation, it is a good course to do these things in a public manner. An example is contagious, whether for good or evil, and it is useful that there should be, on certain occasions, a display of the recognition which follows noble deeds. The facts connected with the event which has brought us together are patent to all. We are going now to present medals to two gentlemen who have distinguished themselves in the highest degree, who have rescued five individuals from a most dangerous position. It is no ordinary man who has the power both of body and mind to come for ward on occasions of great peril. There are many noble deaths. It is a noble thing to die on the field of battle, fighting for the rights of one's country. There are other great deaths, if I may use the ex pression, but I must confess that if I was to choose a death, there is none I would sooner select than a death which would overtake me in the effort to save the life of a fellow-creature. This, indeed, would be euphanasia.

From my youth I have been accustomed to swimming, and to do battle with the boisterous waves for my amusement.

I have received a medal before this, my lord, from the Royal Life-boat Institution. Of that medal I feel very justly proud, but I feel an immense number of times more proud of the medal presented to me this day by your lordship in this public manner, before some of the most eminent citizens of Dublin (applause). I feel very grateful also to the members of the Tayleur Committee, especially to my dear friend, Mr. Stokes, for their very great kindness on this occa sion. I should also thank the Chamber of Com merce for their kindness in giving the use of the room to-day.

Dermond* Kyng of Leinster, was a powerful prince ; he invaded O'Neal and the Kyng of Meath, compelled them to gyve hostages, and constrained O'Kerrall to send hym his son for a pledge into Leinster. At that tyme O'Rory, Kyng of Lethcoin,t whose country was woody and full of boggs, had to wyfe the daughter of Melaghlin MacColman, Kyng of Meath, a fair and lovely lady, entirely beloved of Der mond, Kyng of Leinster, who also hated O'Bory for an affront which his men had received at LethnuthJ in his country. Dermond, by leters and messingers, pursued her love with such fervency, as, in the end, she sent him word that shee was ready to obey, and yeld to his will, appointed him a tyme and place where he should find her, and prayeing him to come soe strongly, as that he might by force take her away with him. Dermond presently assembled his forces, and marched into the county of Lethcoin ; at Trimbruin\u00a7 * Dermond from the beginning of his government was a great oppressor of his people, and a cruel tyrant over his nobility, which made them ready to embrace the first opportunity of changing their master. \u2014 Cambrensis. t This must certainly be an error in transcribing (Lethcoin being mistaken for Leitrim), for Regan could not be ignorant that O'Rory, more truly O'Roirke, was King of Breifni, a territory now comprehending the county of Leitrim, and not of Leithcoin, which was the half of Ireland, being all that lay north of the mouth of the river Boyne in a straight line to Galway. \u2014 Antiquities of Ire land.

O'Rory, full of grief and rage, addressed hymself unto the Kyng of Connaght, complaining of the wrong and scorne done unto hym by the Kyng of Leinster, and in treating his aid in the revenge of so grete an outrage. O'Conner, Kyng of Connaght, moved .with honour and compassion, promised him succour, and presently he dis patched messingers to the King of Ossory unto Melaghlin, King of Meath, to Hesculph, Mac Turkell* Lord of Dub lin, and Morrough O'Birne, wyth whome he so muche prevailed, as they turned heads upon their Lord King Dermond. The King of Leinster seeing hymself forsaken of his kins men, friends, servants, and principal followers, having sume more confidence in Murrough O'Birne than in the rest, took horse, and rode to speak with hym. King Dermond being returned to Femes, and lodged in the Abbey at Femes, dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary, commanded the abbot to write a letre, which he subscribed, and to deliver it to one of his monks to carry it to the Morrough O'Birne, hoping thereby to perswade him to a meeting. The monke being dispatched, discharged the trust imposed upon him soe well as that he delivered the letre to O'Birne. The King followed the monke, and at a woodside saw Morrough O'Birne, who, beholdinge the King, menanced him presently to depart, or else he would repent it. The distressed King, almost destracted with griefe and anger, returned to Femes, and fearing to be betrayed there, and delivered by his people unto the King of Connaught, resolved to abandon his country, and instantly without delay he went to the Horkeran, where he imbarqued hym self for England, having in his company no other man of marke then Awliffe O'Kinade, and about sixty persons. With a prosperous gale he arrived at Bristoll, and was lodged with all his companie in the house us Robert Har dinge, at St. Augustins, where, astir some staie, he addressed his journey towards France, to speak with King Henry, who then had wars in that kingdom with the French King. * Hesculph Mac Turkil was at this time the Danish petty King of Dublin and Fingall, which he held of King Dermod by tribute ; but now. he, as well as the King of Ossory, who was also subject to Dermod, took up arms against him to recover their bberties which he had invaded. The same thing did the O'Birnes in the now county of Wicklow."], [401, "Moore's Song, \" The valley lay smiling before me.\" 369 When he came to the presence of King Henry, he related at large unto hym that he was forced to run into exile, and beseeching hym to gyve hym aid, whereby he might be restorid to his inheritance, which yf it should please him in his goodness to grant, he would acknowledge hym to be Lorde, and serve hym faithfully during his life.* This pitifull relation of the distressed king so much movid King Henry to compassion as that he promised him aid, and willed him to return to Bristoll, there to remain untd he herd furtliir from hym ; and with all he wrote to Robert Harding, requiring hym to receve King Dermond and his followers into his house, and to intreat them with all courtesie and humanitie he could ; whereof Robert failed in nothing. After King Dermond had remained more than a month in Bristol, and seeing no hope of aid from King Henry, weary of delaye, and comfortless, he went to the Erie Richard, intreating succours from hym, and promising, that if by his means he might be re-established in his kyngdome, that he would gyve hym his daughter to wife, and with her the whole Kingdom of Leinster for his inheritance. The Erie, tickled with so fair an offer, made answeare, that if he could obtain leave of the King, his mastir, he would not fail to assiste hym in his person, and bring suffi- cient aid ; but for the present he desired to be excused ; for unless the King would give his assent therunto, he durst not entirtaine a business of that importance. This faire and discreet answeare so well contented the exiled King, as he solemnly swore that whensoever the Erie did bring aide unto hym, he would give him his daughter in marriage, and after his death, the Kingdom of Leinster. These conditions being agreed to on either party, Dermond departed, and went to St. David's, where he staid untill shipping was provided to transport hym into Ireland. #*#*#\u25a0** The King of Leinster finding it to be an impossibility for hym to recovir his kingdome, and to prevaile in his designs, without aide out of England, dispatched his trusty servant and interpreter, Maurice Regan, with letres in Wales, and with authority in his name to promise all such as would come to serve hym in his wars in Ireland, large recompence in landes of inheritance to souche as would staye in the * Cambrensis asserts that King Dermond swore allegiance to King Henry, and to be his vassal and subject, whereupon King Henry took him into his protection, and gave him letters patent directed to all his subjects, to aid and help him. 2z"], [402, "370 The King of Ossr&.y \u2014 Dermond's Enemy. country, and to those that would returne, he would gyve them good intertainment eyther in money or in cattle.

The next day Dermond and the Englishe marched directly to Wexford, and instantly gave an assault unto the towne, in the whiche eighteen Englishe were slain, and of the defendaunts only three. Nevertheless, the towns men perceavinge themselves to be unable to make any long defence, demanded parle, which being graunted, they offered hostages to the King and to sware from thence forward to be evermore his loyall vassals. By the advice of the Eng lishe the conditions were accepted, and the town of Wexford rendered itself unto Dermond. Which done, he went to Femes, as well to cure his hurt men as to feast the Englishe, where they rested three weeks. Then Dermond called to hym Robert Fitz-Stephen and Maurice de Prindergast, teUinge them how much they and their nation were feared by the Irish ; wherefore he had a purpose to invade the King of Ossory, his mortal enemy, and to chastise hym ; but furst he required their advise and consent ; who answered, that they came to that land to no othir end than to serve hym in his warrs, and that they would not forsake him in any interprize whatsoever he would undertake. Dermond assemblid with grete expedition all his forces, to the number of thre thousande, besides the thre hundreth Englishe, and marched towards Ossory. \"When he was entree! into the country, they found that Donald, King of Ossory* plashed a place, made large and deep trenches in the * This Donald was surnamed Macgilla-phadruick, or Fitzpa trick, and was the head of a powerful sept in Ossory, from whence the Barons of Upper Ossory, a title now extinct, were descended, as also the Lord Gowan, now living (1745)."], [403, "Maclise's Historical Picture \u2014 Ends Marriage. 371 same, with hedges upon them, and manned with five thou sande men, through which place his enemies, of necessitie, must passe.

Then Dermond's light men harissed and burnt all the coun try, and returned with a huge prey. 1169. \u2014 After a number of engagements, Dermond, with his Englishe and Irish troopes, marched towards Glindelagh to chastise The O'Tohill* for refusing to come unto hym. When he came into the country he found no resistance. \u00bb 1170. \u2014 At this tyme, Richard, Erie of Pembrooke, sent Reymond Le Gross into Irland with nine or ten knights, and some foot.

The success was good ; fur upon St. Bartholomew's Eve the town was taken by force, with grete slaughter of the citizens ; which done, they sent to King Dermond, pray ing hym with his Englishe to come unto hym, who without delay went to Waterford, and according to his promise made in England, he marryed his daughter unto the Erle,\u00a7 and with her he gave after his death the kingdom e of * O'Toole's Country was called Imayle.

From Downdonnell Reymond came to the Erie, and when the marriage was solemnized, by the general con sent of the Kiug, the Erie, Reymond, Maurice de Prinder gast, Meyler Fitz-Henry, and the rest, agreed to march to Dublin. Dermond with the Erie and the Englishe, went to Femes, there to remaine untill their preparations were fully made. In the meanwhile the Erie was not unmindfull to leave a sufficient garrison for the defence of Waterford. In this tyme the Englishe invasion had bred feare and terror in all the Irish throughout the land ; to prevent insueinge dangers, the King of Connaught amassed an army of thirty thousande horse and foote, to impede the intended enterprise against Dublin ; and the better to performe the same, he plashed and trenched all the places through whiche the Englishe and Dermond must have passed ; and the King of Connaught himself encamped at Clondalkin.* King Dermond, being advertised thereof, imparted the same unto the Erie, layeing before his judgement the difficulties whiche they should find in their passage to Dublin, and praying hym to advise upon the same. After consultation held, it was agreed by the chiefs of the army, that the enter prize should be attempted. The daye of their puttinge into the field beinge come, Miles de Cogan, a gentleman of grete worth and valour, was ordained to march in the vanguard, with a regiment of seven huudreth strong, and with Donell Kavanagh, with his Irish : next unto hym, Raymond le Gros led the battle, with his regiment of eight hundreth English ; and with him, the King of Leinster, with a thou sand of his followers. The rear, with three thousand Eng lish, was commanded by the Erie ; and in the rear of him, a regiment of Irishmen. When they came nere the enemy, their orderly march appalled them so much, as they gave way ; so as the army passed by the way of the mountaine, without any fight, till they came to Dublin ; and the King of Con naught, by the advice of his councill, dissolved his army, and returned to his own country. Hesculph MacTurkill, to withstande his enemies, drew all the forces he could make or procure in the city of Dublin, whereof he was lord. The Erie and Dermond quartered a pretty distance from the towne ; but Miles de Oogan lodged close to the walls. From the Erie and Der mond, Maurice Regan was sent to summon the citty to yeld, and, for their better assurance, to demand thirty pledges.

The soldiers got good spoile, for the citizens were rich. The same daye, which was the daye of St. Matheu the Apostle, Dermond and the Erie made their entry, and found in the towne abundance of victuals. After a few days' stay in Dublin, Dermond returned to Femes ; and immediately after Michellmas, the Erie Kichard (leaving the citty of Dublin in the guard of Myles de Cogan) tooke his jornay for Waterford ; and in the same winter, Dermond, King of Leinster, died at Femes ; after whose death, none of the Irish (except Donald Kavanagh, King Dermond's son, MacGely, of Tirbrun,t and Awliffe O'Carvy), came to the Erie ; and Moriertagh, with the Kin sellagh, made warr upon the Englishe. 1170. \u2014 O'Connor, the Monarque of Ireland, levied a great army, with intent to besiege Dublin.

The men of Wex ford (who evermore hated Dermond and the Englishe), finding it to be now, as they conceaved, a fit opportunity to serve their turns, assailed Robert Fitz-Stephens, slew his men, and took him prisoner, whom they sent to Beckerin, which is a castle seated on the river of Slaine. Doiial Kavenagh, with some of the O'Kinsellaghs, MacGely, and Awliffe O'Carvy, were the messengers that brought unto the Erie, Fitz-Stephens' disaster ; which, although it exceed ingly troubled him, yet he seemed to make slight of it, willing them not to be dismayed or discouraged .at the ill fortune.

The Archbushope being returned with this sad answear, they were amazed with the proud and exorbitant demands of the Irish Monarque, and grew to be pensive. Then Miles de Cogan (rousing up his spirit) brake silence : \" We are here,\" said he, \" a good number of good men ; our best remedie is to make a sallie which is least doubted by the enemy, and I hope in the goodness of God, that we shall have the victorie, or, at least, dye with honnor ; and my desire is that I maye be the firste man appointed to give upon ther quarters.\" With generall applause Cugan's cuucell was approvid aud the captains commanded to draw forth their companies ; the vanguard was designed to MUes de Cogan, consisting of two hundreth ; Reymond le Grusse with othir two hun dreth, commanded the battle ; and the Erie, with two hun dreth, marched in the reare.

Captain Glas was a native of Scotland, and bred a surgeon ; in that capacity he made some voyages to the coast of Guinea, and was at length master of a Guinea ship, in which station he continued till the late war began. Having saved a good sum of money in trade, he ventured part of it on board a privateer, and went himself as captain. He was not three days at sea before the ship's crew mutinied ; but at length, by fair speeches, were pacified ; and still more so by the capture of a French merchant-man of great value, which followed immediately. This good fortune was soon dispelled by the appearance of an enemy's frigate about twice his strength, with which, however, he engaged. The contest was very warm for more than two hours ; but another French ship appearing, Captain Glas was obliged to strike, with the loss of more than half his crew, and himself shot through the shoulder. He re mained some time in a French prison in the West Indies, and was treated with much severity ; but, being at last exchanged, he embarked the remainder of his fortune upon another adventure in the privateering way.

However, he had, upon the conclusion of the late peace, amassed about two thousand pounds, and being an excellent seaman, he resolved to go upon a discovery in his own ship. He found out a new harbour on the coast of Africa, between the river Senegal and Cape de Verd, to which he supposed a very great trade might be driven. He returned to England, and laid his discovery before the ministry ; and at length obtained an exclusive trade to his own harbour,for twenty years. Having prepared for his de- parture, with the assistance of one or two merchants, he left England, and arrived at the new-found harbour. He sent one of his men on shore with propositions of trade, but the natives murdered him the moment he landed. Captain Glas found means to inform the king of the country of the wrong done him, and the mutual advantage that might accrue from trading thither. The king seemed to be pleased with his proposal, only to get him the more securely in his power ; but Glas, being on his guard, he failed in effecting his design. The king's next attempt was to poison the crew by provisiens sent as presents to the captain ; this also failed of effect ; but Glas, for want of necessaries, was obliged to go to the Canaries in an open boat, in order to buy some from the Spaniards. In the meantime the savages fell upon his ship, but they were repulsed by the crew ; and the ship being obliged to quit the harbour, and not finding her captain return, sailed for England, where she arrived in safety. In the meantime, the unfortunate captain landed upon one of the Canary Islands, and presented his petitiun to the Spanish Governor, but who, instead of treating him with the desired hospitality, threw him into prison as a spy, and there kept him for some months, without pen, ink, or paper. He at length bethought himself of writing with a piece of charcoal on a biscuit, to a captain of an English man-of-war, then in the harbour, who, though with much difficulty, and after being previously sent to prison himself, at length effected the captain's release. Here he continued for some time, till his wife and daughter (a beautiful girl of eleven years old) came to him from home ; and from the Canaries they all joyfully embarked for England, on board the Sand- wich, Captain Cochran, commander. The ship sailed from Londun about the month of June or July, 1765, laden with bale-goods, hardware, hats, <fec, for Santa Cruz ; at which place they arrived, discharged their cargo, and thence sailed to Orataira, one of the Canary Islands, and took in a cargo of Madeira wine, raw and 3 A"], [410, "Captain Glas and his Murderers. 378 manufactured silk, cochineal, and a large quantity of Spanish milled dollars, some ingots of gold, some jewels, and a small quantity of gold-dust ; and about the month of November, sailed from Orataira for London, and had then on board John Cochran, captain ; Charles Pinchent, mate ; Peter M'Kinlie, boatswain ; George Gidley, Cook ; Richard St. Quintin, Andrees, Zekerman, and James Pinchent, (brother to the mate) mariners ; and Benjamin Gallipsey, the cabin boy ; and they took on board, as passengers, Captain Glas, his wife and daughter, with a servant boy belonging to them. Before the ship left the Canaries, Gidley, St. Quintin, Zekerman, and M'Kinlie, entered into a conspiracy to murder all the other persons on board, and to possess them selves of the treasure. Accordingly, on Sunday, November 30th, at eleven at night, the four assassins, being stationed on the night-watch, and the captain coining to see every thing properly settled, on his return to his cabin, M'Kinlie seized him, and held him fast, till Gidly killed him with an iron bar, and then threw him overboard. The noise occasioned by this murder, and the captain's groans having alarmed the Pinchents and Captain Glas, they rose from their beds, and immediately came on deck ; and the Pinchents being foremost, they were attacked by the villains, knocked down, and thrown overboard; Captain Glas instantly returned to the cabin for his sword, and his retreat being observed by M'Kinlie, who judged of his intent, secreted himself at the foot of the steps in the dark ; and as he was ascending the steps to get upon the deck, M'Kinlie seized him in his arms, and held him fast, and called out to his associates to assist him, who immediately rushed upon Mr. Glas, and with much difficulty wrested his sword out of his hand, in which scuffle Zekerman received a slight wound in his arm ; and in stabbing Mr. Glas, M'Kinlie received a wound through his left arm. When they had thus murdered Mr. Glas they threw him overboard. This soon brought Mrs. Glas and her child on deck ; and she having seen what the villains had perpetrated, implored for mercy ; but Zekerman and M 'Kinlie came up to her, and she and her daughter being locked in one another's arms, they threw them both into the sea. Having thus despatched all the persons on board, except the two boys, and being then in the British Channel, on their course to London, they immediately put the ship about, and steered for the coast of Ireland ; and on Tuesday, December 3rd, about two in the afternoon, they arrived within ten leagues of the harbour of Waterford and Ross,"], [411, "The \" Black Bull \" Inn, Thomas-street, Dublin. 379 and then determined to sink the ship ; and, in order to secure themselves and the treasure, they hoisted out their cock-boat, and loaded her with bags of dollars, to the quantity of about two tons, and then, knocking out the ballast port, quitted the ship, and got into the boat, and left the two boys in the sinking vessel to perish. One of the boys having entreated to be taken on board, but refu-ed, leaped into the sea, and by swimming laid hold of the gunnel of the boat, when one of the fellows gave him a stroke, and knocked him off, and he was imme- diately drowned. Soon after they quitted the ship she filled with water aud overset, and they saw the other boy washed overboard. The boat having reached the harbour's mouth, about six in the evening, they rowed her about three miles up the river, and being afraid to proceed further with such a quantity of treasure, they landed within two miles of the fort of Duncannon ; and having left out as much as they appre- hended they could carry, they buried un the strand the rest of the dollars, amounting to 250 bags ; they then proceeded up the river with the remainder, the ingots of gold, jewels, and gold dust, and landed at a place called Fisherstown, within four miles of Ross, and refreshed themselves at an alehouse, where a bag of 1,200 dollars was stolen from them. On Wednesday, December 4, they proceeded to Ross, and put up at an alehouse, and there exchanged 1,200 dollars for their amount in current gold, and bought three cases of pistols, hired six horses, and two guides, and on Thursday, the 5th, set out for Dublin, where they arrived on the 6th, and stopped at the Black Bull Inn, in Thomas-street. Having lavished a considerable sum in Ross, and an account having arrived there, that a vessel was driven on the coast, richly laden, without a living soul on board, it caused a suspicion that those persons had destroyed and plundered the ship ; upon which the collector sent two gentlemen express to the chief magistrate of Ross, then in Dublin, to inform him of their suspicions, with intent that the said persons should be taken, and required to give an account of themselves. Those gentlemen arrived on the 8th, aud having informed the said magistrate of their errand, he, with proper assistance, apprehended St. Quintin and Zekerman, who, being examined separately, each confessed the murders, and other matters before related, and also, that since they arrived in Dublin, Gidley and M'Kinlie had sold to a goldsmith dollars to the amount of \u00a3300, by which means M'Kinlie was apprehended,"], [412, "The Rapparee Fields and Beaux Walk. 380 and intelligence got that Gidley had set out in a post-chaise for Cork, in order to take shipping for England. Having received an account of the dollars that were hid, the magistrate of Ross despatched back the two gentlemen with directions to the Collector of Ross and the commanding officer of the fort of Duncannon, to make search for the bags of dollars. In returning they apprehended Gidlie on his way to Cork, and had him committed to Carlow gaol, where they found upon him 53 guineas, a moidore, and some silver. On the 13th they found 250 bags of dollars sealed up, and brought them to Ross under a guard, and lodged them in the custom-house. There were found in the possesion of M'Kinlie, Zekerman, and St. Quintin, some toys, a few guineas, an ingot of gold, and a small parcel of gold dust. On Saturday, March 1, the four assassins were tried in Dublin, and found guilty ; and on Monday, the 3rd, they were executed at Stephens-green ; their bodies were brought back to Newgate, and, on the Wednesday following, they were hung in chains, two of them near Macarrell's- wharf, on the South-wall ; and the other two about the middle of the Piles, below the Pigeon-house.

Richard St. Quintin and Andrea Zekerman, the other two concerned in this cruel affair, are to remain on the Piles at the Pigeon House. Accordingly, the same Journal, on the 1st and 12th of April, 1767, announces the removal of the bodies, in deference to public opinion, from the new wall, and that they were carried by sea to the rock on the Muglins, near Dalkey Island, where a gibbet was erected, and they were hung up in irons, said to be the completest ever made in the kingdom.

Fleming and W. B. Kirwan.\u2014 The An- thologia Hibernica. \u2014 In Memoriam. Page 78. There was a preacher of great eminence in Dublin, in my early days, of the name of Fleming ; he was a Roman Catholic clergyman of an enlarged mind, free from bigotry, and gifted with attributes of the highest quality to form a"], [414, "Sermons should be Pictures of Human Life. 382 perfect orator. His taste for composition was pure and original ; his language natural, yet poetically chosen to express his subject ; his imagery grand, so that his sermons were pictures of human life, held up to view, and descanted upon with judgment, derived from a thorough knowledge of mankind, and prepared with a remedy for every vicious habit or reigning folly. In description, he was so dear that you could not mistake nor blink the question ; then his voice was so harmonious, and his articulation so perfect, yet without apparent effort, that he delighted his hearers. _ I have attended, for sixty years, to every preacher of note in all places of Christian worship within my reach in Ireland, England, Scotland, and Wales, and I have never met any one equal to him. From the time I first heard him, when I was but nine years old, he never preached a sermon that I knew of previously without attending to his edifying dis course. Lest I should be considered partial, I can adduce some respectable names of members of the Protestant Church that were always to be found ranged round the foot of his pulpit, and often so numerous as to fill a gallery opposite. Nearly the whole of the Hutchinson family, the head of which family was the Provost of Trinity College, Grattan, Curran, Ponsonby, Yelverton, Michael Smith, L. Gardner, Isaac Corry, Brownlow, Hussey Burgh \u2014 I could add more, were these not sufficient to give some idea that excellence alone could have drawn such an assemblage of luminous characters, and to a place of worship not their own. Dean Kirwan was the only preacher I have heard that could attempt to compete with Mr. Fleming ; and the Dean having been exclusively employed in the cause of charity, prevents any fair comparison, although I think comparison by no means a fair test of superior abilities \u2014 for, unless the parties are similarly gifted in requisites, the comparison ends. Now, Fleming and Kirwan were differently supplied with natural attributes, and their modes, style of composi tion, delivery, action, &c, differed likewise ; but each felt his power,' and adapted the means of using it exactly to suit his purpose. The contrast might be discovered by referring to their respective manner of delivery. Fleming was easy and familiar in his exordium, divided his subjects into parts, and proposed treating it in that order ; he then gradually raised his voice, which was powerful and clear, so that he could be heard at the door of the chapel, without much effort. He painted in glaring colours the enormity or vice he wished to correct, and the attendant miseries brought on, perhaps, a whole family by a"], [415, "Orphans recommended to their Creator's Care. 383 wretched husband or wife ; the contrast drawn between the innocent children and their depraved parent formed so strong yet so true a picture of distress, that one might sup pose, if he ceased speaking, and ended there, the horror and disgust were so felt, that a change would take place, if any power of reflection remained in the minds of those the painting might resemble. He generally sat down for five minutes, then rose and gave another picture, sweetly touched, of the pleasure to be enjoyed in our correcting any of our passions, but particularly of such destructive power as that one he had described ; then of the value of reli gious application, and calling upon our Maker for His assistance ; and, lastly, of the happiness hereafter promised to those who repent truly of their sins. He then made a feeling appeal, when his voice changed to a tone so truly fervent and pathetic, his auditors were moved, many to tears ; and he closed with leaving an impressive interest in the hearts of all his hearers. Dean Kirwan commenced with the Lord's Prayer ; then looking at his paper, gave out the text, and proceeded to expose the helpless state of orphans left to casual supplies, obtained in the manner in which he was then engaged, pleading the cause of so many young, destitute creatures, preserved so far from starvation and ignorance, but entirely dependent from that day on the bounty of his auditors. He then drew pictures of luxury, and thundered his artillery against the great and opulent. His language was well chosen, and perfectly adapted to express his meaning ; his figures transcendently beautiful, and following each other in rapid succession, delivered with great energy, and some times impassioned to a degree to the very extent of his powers, so that he was often obliged to pause for rest, from exhaustion. No man ever was more zealous in a cause that seemed to possess his heart and soul, and to have engaged his faculties of mind and speech to the utmost stretch ; in fine, he appeared inspired on that part of his discourse ; he used much action, and evinced talent for an excellent actor, statesman, or advocate. He was truly eloquent, and seemed to speak not from previous study, yet his deportment ap peared studious and preconcerted. When he was nearly finished, in a subdued tone he lamented that his exertions were, he feared, likely to fail. He had not the art of touching their feelings. He then pointed to a number of the children, placed in a situation for public view ; their claims were evident in their innocent looks and mild appearance ; then, recommending them to the care of their Creator, he, in a fervent appeal, closed his discourse, always"], [416, "384 The Rev. C. Fleming \u2014 In memoriam. with some happy sentence. The effect of his eloquence was such upon his congregation, that many persons, after having emptied their purses, left their watches, until released by a further donation. These two clergymen, it is said, studied in the same col lege, and were competitors for fame in speaking ; they were to the last friendly when they met in company, although of different religions. Mr. Kirwan became a Protestant, and was made a Dean, as the following paragraph will ex plain : \u2014 Mr. Grattan, the great orator in the Irish Parliament, finding the Rev. W. B. Kirwan poorly provided for, although he had quitted the Roman Catholic religion and embraced the Protestant, and had been indefatigable in the cause of charity, so as to have severely injured his health, he (Mr. Grattan) rose one day and addressed the house thus : \u2014 \" I rise,\" said he, \" to speak in the neglected case of the Rev. Walter Blake Kirwan, a man of talent, of true Christian piety and virtue, a man who, in feeding the lamp of charity, has nearly extinguished the lamp of Use ; and what has been his remuneration'? St. Nicholas-without or St. Nicholas within* Oh, shame ! shame ! shame ! shame ! \" He sat down. Not long after, Mr. Kirwan was made a Dean, and some comfortable emolument attached to it. I believe, however, he did not relax in his labours, but advocated still the cause of charity, until exhaustion placed him at rest in the grave. It is but justice to the fame of those two eminent persons to say, that the sermons published in their names as their compositions, are vile impostures, and bear scarcely a sen tence worthy of their admirable discourses. I, therefore, hope and trust my readers, should these garbled fragments meet their eye, will turn from them with merited disgust and aversion. The following notice is taken from the Anthologia Hibernica, 1794 : \u2014 The Rev. Christopher Fleming, the celebrated preacher and contemporary of Dean Kirwan, died in December, 1794. He was a Roman Catholic clergyman, connected with Adam and Eve Chapel, Dublin. The recollection of the man and his excellence will form his eulogy. As a preacher, his elo quence formed an era in pulpit oratory : unlike those who, possessing much speculative benevolence, permit it to eva- * St. Nicholas- within and St. Nicholas-without are two livings of very limited means, and were even jointly a poor recompense to a man of such luminous talent, effectively employed in the cause of charity."], [417, "The great Granite Chain, Dublin and Wicklow. 385 porate in theory and sentiment, his practice was a living comment on his doctrine. His splendid abilities excited general admiration and respect. His virtues prevented their brilliancy from being ostensive or oppressing. He was peculiarly distinguished by a sublime simplicity of manners. His versatile genius made him a pleasing, instructive com- panion to every age and description. In social life we have seen the man who, in the morning declaimed with more than oracular solemnity, in the evening become the soul of innocence and gaiety. He brought with him no unsocial gloom to damp the sprightly effusions of cheerfulness and wit. His attic festivity and good humour gave an animated glow to conversation, and communicated a high zest and elegant reasoning to the rational language of life. Dear to talent \u2014 dear to religion, he died universally regretted ; and his memory will be universally respected as long as regard to departed merit remains among us. APPENDIX H Objects of Geological Interest in the vicinity of Dublin.\u2014 The great Granite Chain from Kings town to Waterford, read at the British Asso- ciation in August, 1835. Page 123. The -vicinity of Dublin offers a great variety of interesting matter for the study of the geologist. Within a very limited distance from the capital, we are presented with an important series both of primary and secondary rocks. To the south of the bay of Dublin, primary rocks alone occur ; which are remarkable not only from their variety, but from the indications of violence exhibited in the contortions of the strata, the intrusion of granitic veins into the micaceous schist, and the chemical changes which the schists have suffered when in contact with the granite. The primary rocks of the vicinity of Dublin consist of a central ridge of granite, on each side of which the micaceous and argillaceous schists, the quartz rock, and mountain limestone are arranged. This granite chain extends from Kingstown on the north into the county of Waterford on the south, a distance of nearly sixty miles. In the vicinity of Dublin the course of the granite chain is well ascertained : it extends from 3 B"], [418, "The Granite Chain \u2014 Kingstown to Waterford. 386 Dalkey Island to Blackrock, and from thence passes south ward to Dundrum and Rathfarnham ; it then crosses the Military-road behind Montpellier-hill, and running across the northern extremity of Glenismaule, forms the basis of Seechon, and consequently supports the schist which con stitutes the greater portion of that hill. On the east, that is, next the sea, the boundary of the granite is very apparent ; from Dalkey it runs along the shore to Killiney, from thence it runs inland to Rochestown-hill, extending in nearly a right line to the Scalp, passing on to Glencree and Lough Dan, holding a southerly course. This central granite ridge includes some of the loftiest hills in the vicinity ; they are, however, rivalled by the ad joining quartz mountain, called the greater Sugar-Loaf, and the schistose mountains of Seechon and of Djouce. This granite ridge is destitute of the sharp and spiry outlines which so often characterize mountains composed of this rock ; a circumstance apparently dependent on the incon siderable elevation of the hills, and also on the very decom posible nature of some of the kinds of this rock, which disentegrate rapidly with exposure to the weather. The mineral nature of the granite in general exhibits, nevertheless, but little variety, and is almost completely free from hornblende or other ingredients, not essential to its character. The felspar is for the most part of a pearly white ness, and forms a striking contrast with the black mica. The stone is much employed for architectural purposes in Dublin and the vicinity, and considerable quantities of it are ex ported to Liverpool, and there employed for paving the streets. Near Killiney, at the junction of the granite with the schist, the quality of the former is rather different from that obtained in the quarries near Kingstown. It is harder ; and the mica, instead of occurring in plates, has assumed the form of plumose mica. At Glencullen, Glenismaule, <fec, the granite is more coarse-grained, and the mica is of light colour, forming large hexagonal plates, sometimes half an inch in breadth. This variety is less compact than the granite of Killiney, and contains more felspar and mica ; hence, perhaps, its more decomposible nature. In the vici nity of Glenismaule the granite is often completely disinte grated for a depth of four feet or more ; and the decay of the rock would proceed with great rapidity, if the covering of peat did not afford a protection against the destructive effects of the weather. This decomposed granite sand is brought to Dublin under the name of freestone, and is em ployed for scouring and other domestic purposes. The mass of granite, whose limits have been defined, is"], [419, "Micaceous Schist. \u2014 Killiney, and the Scalp. 387 almost everywhere in contact with the micaceous schist, both on its western and eastern flanks, and the junction of the rocks may be studied at Killiney, the Scalp, and Rath- fainhani. In the first of these situations, the schist is seen resting on its upturned edges, on a basis of granite, and traversed by numerous veins of that substance. As the granite veins run in two directions they often intersect, and one set runs parallel to the lamination of the schist, while a second set cuts across the strata. Many of these veins con- tain fragments of the schistose rock. Along the line of junction of the two rocks, the schist is much curved, and contains abundance of crystals of chiastolite, arranged in stelliform groups. The schist is not the only rock which is in contact with the granite ; for, from Blackiock to Dun- drum, the limestone succeeds the granite, aud consequently the whole series of primary strata are absent. The actual contact of the two rocks has not been observed, but at Blackrock they are within a few yards of each other ; and the limestone is extremely compact, consisting of angular fragments, as if it had been shivered into small pieces and subsequently re-united. The quartz rock of Shankhill, if not in actual contact with the granite, is only separated from it by the intervention of a thin film of micaceous schist ; and at Ballinascomey, the argillaceous schist is not far re- moved from the granite ; but, as the two schists graduate into each other, it is not easy to characterize them, in every instance, by precise mineralogical distinctions. On the western side, the micaceous schist commences at Rathfarnham, and the junction of the two rocks may be seen, on the road side, near the commencement of the Military-road ; it then runs across Glenismaule, and forms the mountain of Seechon. The micaceous schist exhibits the usual mineral charac- ters of that rock, and consists of a mixture of quartz and mica, in valuable proportions. Sometimes alternating lamin\u00e6 of the two ingredients are so fine that the mica appears to pre- ponderate, and the quartz is not so apparent ; on the other hand, the quartz sometimes attains the thickness of an inch, and almost excludes the mica. Not unfrequently the quartz is replaced by argillaceous lamin\u00e6, and thus the rock passes into an argillaceous schist ; which, when in contact with the granite, is sometimes changed into hornblende schist. At Killiney the schist exhibits a peculiar mode of decomposi tion, which it is difficult to explain. At first little circular depressions may be observed in the schist, and as these en large, little cavities are formed, often the size of an orange, and giving the rock a remarkably corroded appearance, asif"], [420, "Bray, the Dargle, and Glen of the Downs. 388 it had been an amygdaloid which had lost its mineral nodules. This, however, is not the case in the present instance, for the cavities are not caused by the falling out of nodules or portions of conglomerate, but appear to depend on some ill understood concretionary structure. The mica schist is followed by argillaceous schist and quartz rock ; the former occurring on both sides of the granite chain, whilst the latter is only found on its eastern side ; quartz rock also appears on the north side of the bay, constituting the peninsula of Howth. The schist occurs in continuous strata, which may be traced over a wide extent of country, but the quartz rock is found only in detached portions. On the eastern side of the granite ridge, the argdlaceous schist, being the outermost of the rocks on that side, is bounded by the sea. The other margin of the clay strata is bounded by the micaceous schist, and may be defined by a line drawn from Shankhill and passing to Enniskerry, and to the west of the great Sugar-Loaf, and continuing in the same direction beyond Loch Dan. It includes the country around Bray, the Dargle, and Glen of the Downs \u2022 and also includes several extensive masses of quartz rock, such as Shankhill, the two Sugar-Loafs, Bray Head, the Glen of the Downs, &c. On the western side of the granite ridge, the commence ment of the argillaceous schist may be seen, beyond Rath farnham, where it is bounded by the river Dodder, which separates it from the micaceous schist ; it then passes to the west of Seechon till it reaches the sources of the Liffey. There is often considerable difficulty in tracing the junction of the two schistose rocks, as they pass into each other by insensible gradations, and have both been greatly disturbed and contorted. The lower parts of the argillaceous schists often pass into greywacke schist, viz, into schist containing fragments of schistose rocks, which are fine in some cases, as near Bray, while they are coarse conglomerates near the Tallaght Hills. Near the granite, these rocks undergo a very remarkable change ; and as we trace them they gradually lose the strati fied appearance, and even their schistose structure ; they have become, in short, hard and compact, passing into a very close-grained green stone, consisting of hornblende and fel spar, and where the crystals of felspar attain a larger size, a green stone porphyry is the result. In the ravines, portions of schorl in acicular crystals are very common, but they have not been traced to their source. Lambay Island, to the north of Dublin, may be included"], [421, "Masses of Quartz Rock at Bray Head and Howth. 389 under the head of argillaceous schist. The island consists of strata of schist and beds of green stone and porphyry. The schistose strata are much indurated, and are contorted in a most intricate manner, and these contortions occur both on the minute and the great scale. These strata often lose their stratified appearance, and pass into green stone and porphyry. The porphyry is sometimes amygdaloidal, containing nodules of calcareous spar. The crystals of felspar often exhibit a very peculiar laminar structure. The quartz rock exists in two states, either alternating with schist, and in that case decidedly stratified, or destitute of all foreign intermixture, and in these examples the strati fication is very indistinct. The hills composed of quartz rock are easily recognized by their conical outline, a circum stance which has served to give names to some of them. The chief masses of quartz are Bray Head and Howth, in which it alternates with schistose strata ; Shankhill, and the greater and lesser Sugar-Loaf, in which no schistose strata occur. The quartz of the peninsula of Howth exhibits the pheno menon of contorted strata in a very beautiful manner. The stratification is very obvious, and the schistose beds exhibit a great diversity of hues, from purple to red, thus rendering the contortions more apparent. Some of the strata rest on their edges, others are undulated, and sometimes curved upon themselves, so as to resemble the concentric crusts of some spheroidal concretion. The same phenomenon is ob servable at Bray. The only secondary rock that occurs in the vicinity of Dublin is the Mountain Limestone, which constitutes all the country beyond the primary strata, occupying the counties of Meath and Kildare, and greater part of the county of Dublin. No limestone is found in the county of Wicklow, and the farmers of that county, on the eastern or sea-side, obtain their supplies from Howth, or from the beds of strati fied calcareous alluvium, the only condition under which limestone occurs in that county. On the opposite side of the county the supplies of lime for building and agricultural purposes are chiefly drawn from the county of Carlow. The limestone exists in two very distinct states in the vicinity of Dublin ; in the one it has the character of the or dinary carboniferous limestone, containing the usual organic remains ; but near the primary strata it is very impure, has a schistose structure, contains but few organic remains, and is the calp of Kirwan. The calp is distinctly stratified, the strata seldom exceeding two feet in thickness, and being separated by thin beds of slate clay. This limestone, which is much used for architectural purposes, occurs in many"], [422, "Last moments of Louis X VL. and M. Antoinette. 390 localities around DubHn, and everywhere exhibits marks of contortion and violence, which may be observed in almost every quarry around Dublin. At Lucan there is a beautiful example of contorted limestone strata ; and equally interest ing instances may be seen at Portrane, where the sea-coast has exposed numerous sections, in which the nature of the calp is fully displayed. Besides the calp, magnesian limestone occurs in a few localities, as at Howth, near the junction of the primary and secondary strata, and on the Dodder, between Milltown and Classon Bridge. This limestone contains no organic remains, but occasionally, as at Howth, we find it contains imbedded fragments of the mountain limestone. APPENDIX I. An Irish Priest, Father Edgeworth. \u2014 Short Sketches of the Last Moments of Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette. Page 224. When she heard her sentence read, she did not show the smallest alteration in her countenance, and left the hall without saying a single word to her judges or to the people. It was then half-past four o'clock in the morning, October 16th, 1793. The Queen was conducted to the condemned hold in the prison of the Conciergerie. At five o'clock the general was beat. At seven o'clock the whole armed force was on foot ; cannon were planted in the squares, and at the extremities of the bridges, from the palace to the Square de la Revolution. At ten o'clock, numerous patrols passed through the streets. At half- past eleven in the morning Marie Antoinette was brought out of the prison, dressed in a white dishabille. Ldte other malefactors, she was conducted upon a common cart to the place of execution. Her beautiful hair from behind was entirely cut off, and her hands were tied behind her back. Besides her dishabille, she wore a very small white cap. Her back was turned to the horse's tail. During her trial she wore a dress of white and black mixture. On her right was seated, upon the cart, the executioner ; upon her left a constitutional priest, belonging to the Metropolitan Church of Notre Dame, dressed in a grey coat, and wearing"], [423, "\"Long Live the Republic/\" 391 what is commonly called a bob- wig. The cart' was escorted by numerous detachments of horse and foot. Henriot, Rousin, and Boulanger, generals of the revolutionary army, preceded by the rest of the staff-officers, rode before the cart. An immense mob, especially women, crowded the streets, insulted the Queen, and vociferated, \" Long live the Re public !\" She seldom cast her eyes upon the populace, and beheld with cold indifference the great armed force of 30,000 men, which lined the streets in double ranks. The sufferings she sustained during her captivity had much altered her appearance, and the hair on her forehead appeared as white as snow. The Queen, without anguish or bigotry, was speaking to the priest seated by her side. Her spirits were neither elevated nor depressed : she seemed quite insensible to the shouts of \" Vive la Republique !\" She showed even a kind of satisfaction to look forward for the moment which might rid her of her miserable existence. When she passed through the Rue St. Honore, she sometimes attentively looked at the inscriptions of the words liberty and equality affixed to the outside of the houses. She ascended the scaffold with seeming haste and impatience ; and then turned her eyes with great emotion towards the garden of the Tuilleries, the former abode of her greatness. At half -past twelve o'clock the guillotine severed her head from her body. She died in the thirty-eighth year of her age. The executioner lifted, and showed the blood-stream ing head from the four direct corners of the scaffold, which is shown only from one side in all other common executions. The mob instantly vociferated, \" Long live the Republic !\" A young man'who dipped his pocket handkerchief in the Queen's blood, and pressed it with veneration to his breast, was instantly apprehended. Upon him were found the portraits of Louis XVI. and of Marie Antoinette. The corpse of the ill-fated Queen was immediately after buried in a grave filled with quicklime, in the churchyard of the Madelaine, where Louis XVI. was buried in the same manner. last moments of LOUIS XVI. Paris, Jan. 22, 1793. Conformably to the arrangements made by the Executive Council, Louis was yesterday put to death, at the Place de la Revolution, heretofore Place de Louis XV."], [424, "Father Edgeworth and Louis X VI. 392 Twenty-five citizens of known principles, well armed, acquainted with the manual exercise, and having each sixteen rounds of shot, were chosen from each section, to form a guard of twelve hundred men, who accompanied the unfortunate monarch to the place of execution. Strong detachments from the different legions were posted in the streets through which the royal prisoner was to pass, and also in the avenues leading to the Place de la Revolution ; to prevent any confusion, and each section had a body in reserve, ready to move at a moment's notice to maintain public order. Cannon were also distributed in every quarter where it was thought they could be any way serviceable, had even events made it necessary to employ them ; for, even to the last moment, the sanguinary faction who pronounced the death of the unfortunate monarch, manifested symptoms of fear that some attempts might be made to rescue him. Between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, Louis proceeded from his apartments in the Temple, and got into the mayor's carriage, who accompanied him, as did also M. Edgeworth, an Irish priest, who he specially requested might attend him. Louis was dressed in a brown great-coat, white waistcoat, black breeches and stockings \u2014 his hair was dressed. The procession, commanded by Mareschal Santerre, pro ceeded along the Boulevards to the place of execution. One hundred gendarmes, on horseback, formed an advanced guard to the procession. The rearguard was composed of one hundred national guards from the military school, also mounted. Various reserves of calvary lined the procession, and patrolled all the outskirts of the city. The unfortunate monarch arrived at the foot of the scaffold at twenty minutes past ten. He mounted the scaffold with firmness and dignity ; he appeared desirous to address the people ; but even this last wish was denied him ; drums and trumpets gave the signal, and, at twenty-two minutes past ten, HIS HEAD WAS SEVERED FROM HIS BODY. The Place de la Revolution was so strongly guarded by troops that no person was suffered to pass after the King had entered it. Some, however, who had previously taken their stand near the scaffold, notwithstanding the indecent noise of drams and trumpets, heard him plainly pronounce these words : \u2014 \" Citizens, I forgive my enemies, and I die innocent !\" After his death the nearest spectators divided among them what of his hair had been cut off by the stroke of the"], [425, "Inhumanity \u2014 \" Behold the Blood of a Tyrant!\" 393 guillotine, and several persons were so inhuman as to dip their handkerchiefs in his blood, which they afterwards carried about, crying, \" Behold the blood of a tyrant !\" When the executioners showed his head to the people, cries of \" Vive la Nation ! Vive la Republique !\" was heard on all sides : and several groups made use of the following expressions : \" We always wished well to him, but he never wished well to us !\" Many, however, showed emotions of a different nature, but which they were obliged to conceal as much as possible for their own personal safety. His body was taken to the Church of the Madeline; where it was interred between the persons who lost their lives during the illuminations on account of his marriage, and the Swiss who fell on the 10th of August. Louis, before his departure from the Temple, delivered to the Commissioners of the Council General, who were upon guard, his latter will, two copies of which he had written on the 25th December, 1792. The city remained quiet, in gloomy silence through the day ; in the morning the shops were shut, and no woman was allowed to be in the streets till the procession had returned with the body of Louis. APPENDIX K. Irish Eloquence \u2014 Grattan, Curran, Flood. Page 322. Specimens of their Eloquence. GRATTAN. During the latter part of the ninteenth century, many Eersons asserted that Grattan was the author of Junius's letters. The very soul of that immortal writer seemed to vivify all his speeches and writings : the same sagacity, the same richness of language, the same irony, the same impas sioned energy of expression, combining conciseness with ornament, strength with beauty, and elegance with sublimity. Extracts from his Speeches. providence. \"So it frequently happens; men are but instruments of provi dence, and without knowing it, fulfil her way.

' ' When a bill for she improvement of barren lands, and the encouragement of industry among the lower orders of the people, was, in the last session, resisted by the spiritual peers, a right reverend prelate was said to have declared as a principle, that the poor should not be relieved, if the clergy were to be at the expense. Such a sentiment coming from a Christian and a Protestant bishop \u2014 Grattan was a Protestant \u2014 must have smitten every breast with deep and sincere affliction ; but, if we are cast down by so great and grave an authority on the one side, we are consoled again by a still higher interposition, the express commands and practice of the Scriptures on the other. The Saviour of man suffered on a principle different from that which the right reverend prelate has introduced. The apostles, the martyrs, and that flaming con stellation of men, that in the early age of Christianity shot to their station in the heavens, andfell, andfalling, illumined the nations of the earth with the blaze of the Gospel, they rose and they fell with inspirations of a different kind. Had Christ been of the prelate's opinion, he never had been born, and we never had been saved. Had he said to his apostles, ' The poor are not to be fed, the valley is not to laugh and to sing at the expense of our church ;' or, had the apostles said to the nations of the earth, ' Ye are not to be benefited at the expense of Christian pastors;' or, had the martyrs expostulated with themselves, 'we will not suffer for mankind,' what had become of the Christian religion ? Let the pagan priest of Jove, or the sensual priest of Mahomet, deliver such doctrine, but don't you part with the palm of Christianity, nor relinquish the lofty self-surrendering precepts of your Gospel, to poach in politics for little and wicked tenets, in order to brand your prayer book with the image of sorry selfishness, which would disgrace the frontispiece of Machiavel.\" DESCRIPTION OF A GREAT CHARACTER. \" I speak of some, not all. There are among them men whom I revere. Such is one whom I don't name, because he is present; mild, pious, and benevolent; a friend to the meekness of the gospel, and a friend to man.

The man I allude to I know him not, or know him as we know superior beings, only by his works. WEAKNESS OF HUMAN NATURE. \"Our contemplation, the most profound, on Divine nature can only lead ua to one great conclusion \u2014 our own immeasurable inanity ; from whence we should learn that we can never serve God but in serving his creature ; and to think we serve God by a profusion of prayer, when we degrade and proscribe his creature and our fellow-creature, was to suppose Heaven, like the court of princes, a region of flattery, and that man can there procure a holy connivance at his inhumanity, on the personal application of luxurious and complimentary devotion.\" THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. ' ' A- gigantic form walked the earth at this moment, who smote crowns with a hundred hands, and opened for the seduction of their subjects a hundred arms.\" EXTENDED EMPIRE. \"When England had conquered France, possessed America, \u00a7uided the councils of Prussia, directed Holland, and intimidated pain ; when she was the great western temple to which the nations of the earth repaired, from whence to draw eternal oracles of policy and freedom ; when her root extended from continent to continent, and the dew of the two hemispheres watered her branches \u2014 then, indeed, we allowed with less danger, but never with justice that she might have made sacrifices of the claims of the Irish.\" BOROUGH INFLUENCE. \"The king had another instrument more subtle and more pliable than the sword, and against the liberty of the subject more cold and deadly, a court instrument that murders freedom without the mark of blood \u2014 palls itself in the covering of the constitution, and in her own colours, and in her name, plants the dagger \u2014 a borough of parliament.\" REFORM. ' ' In that American contest we saw that reform which had been born in England, and banished to America, advance like the shepherd lad in Holy Writ, and overthrow Goliah. He returned, riding on the wave of the Atlantic, and his spirit moved on the waters of Europe.\""], [428, "396 \" The Good and Gracious Earl of Charlemont.\" SELF LEGISLATION. \"Self legislation is life, and has been fought for as for being. It was that principle that called forth resistance to the House of Stuart, and baptized with royalty the House of Hanover, when the people stood sponsors for their allegiance to the liberty of the subjects ; for kings are but satellites, and your freedom is the luminary that has called them to the skies ; but your fatal comphances (speaking of the then parliament) have caused a succession of measures which have collected upon us such an accumulation of calamity, and which have finally, at an immense expense and through a sea of blood, stranded these kingdoms on a solitary shore \u2014 naked of empire, naked of liberty, and bereft of innocence, to ponder on an abyss which has swallowed up one part of their fortunes, and yawns for the remainder.\" Grattan thus finally portrays some of the great political characters of Ireland, during the latter part of the 18th ceil tury \u2014 Mr. Malone, Lord Percy (Lord Shannon), Duke of Leinster, Mr. Ponsonby, Mr. Brownlow, Sir William Osborne, Mr. Burgh, Mr. Daly, Mr. Yelverton, Mr. Ogle, Mr. Flood, Mr. Forbes, Lord Charlemont, and Gerrard Hamilton. THE EARL OF CHARLEMONT. \"In the list of injured characters I beg leave to say a few words for the good and gracious Earl of Charlemont. An attack, not only on his measures, but on his representative, makes his vindication seasonable \u2014 formed to unite aristocracy and the people, with the manners of a court and the principles of a patriot ; with the flame of liberty and the love of order ; un assailable to the approaches of power, of profit, or of titles, he annexed to the love of freedom a veneration for order, and cast on the crowd that followed him the gracious shade of his own accom plishments, so that the very rabble grew civilized as it approached his person ; for years did he preside over a great army* without pay or reward, and he helped to accomplish a great revolution without a drop of blood. Let slaves utter their slander, and bark at glory which is conferred by the people ; his name will stand ; and when his clay shall be gathered in the dirt to which it belongs, his monument, whether in marble or in the hearts of his country men, shall be consulted as a subject of sorrow and a source of virtue.\" FLOOD. ' ' Mr. Flood, my rival, as the pamphlet calls him \u2014 and I should be unworthy the character of his rival if in his grave I did not do him justice \u2014 he had his faults, but he had great powers, great public effect ; he persuaded the old, he inspired the young ; the castle vanished before him ; on a small subject he was miserable ; * \"The Irish Volunteers.\""], [429, "Mr. Forbes \u2014 He preferred Exile to Apostacy. 397 put into his hand a distaff, and, like Hercules, he made sad work of it ; but give him the thunderbolt, and he had the arm of a Jupiter ; he misjudged when he transferred himself to the English Parliament ; he forgot that he was a tree of the forest, loo old and too great lo be transplanted at fifty ; and his seat in the British Parliament isa caution to the friends of Union to stay al home, and make the country of their birth the seat of their action.\" MR. BURGH. Afterwards Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer. \"Mr. Burgh, another great person in those scenes, which it is not in the little quill of this author to depreciate. He was a man singularly gifted \u2014 with great talent, great variety, wit, oratory, and logic ; he, too, had his weakness \u2014but he had the pride of genius also ; he strove to raise his country along with himself, and never sought to build his elevation on the degradation of Ireland. \" I moved an amendment for a free export ; he moved a better amendment, and he lost his place ; I moved a declaration of right. ' With my last breath will I support the right of the Irish Parlia ment, ' was his note to me when I applied to him for his support ; he lost the chance of recovering his place, and his way to the seals, for which he might have bartered. The gates of promotion were shut on him, as those of glory opened.\" MR. DALY. \" Mr. Daly, my beloved friend \u2014 he, in a great measure, drew the address of '79, in favour of our trade, that 'ungracious measure;' and he saw, read, and approved of the address of '82, in favour of constitution, that address of ' separation ;' he visited me in my illness, at that moment, and I had communication on those sub jects with that man, whose powers of oratory were next to perfection, and whose powers of understanding, I might say, from what has lately happened, bordered on the spirit of prophecy.\" MR.

Flood bitterly reflected upon the conduct of Grattan, and even stooped to personalities,"], [430, "Curran \u2014 \" Universal Emancipation.\" 398 which drew one of the finest philippics ever heard from the latter, who observed, turning to Flood, whose nose was dis figured :\u2014 \" He resembles an ill-omened bird of night, that with sepulchral notes, a cadaverous aspect, and broken beak, hovers over the dome of this assembly, shedding baneful influence, and ready to stoop and pounce upon his prey ; he can be trusted by no man ; the people cannot trust him, the minister cannot trust him ; he deals out the most impartial treachery to both ; he tells the nation it is ruined by other men, while it is sold by himself ; he fled from the Embargo-bill, he fled from the Mutiny-bill, he fled from the Sugar-bill ; I therefore tell him in the face of his country, before all the world, and to his very beard, he is not an honest man. \" IRISH GENTRY. \"I think,\" said he, \"I know my country; I think I have a right to know her. She has her weaknesses ; were she perfect, one would admire her more, but love her less.

The errors incident to such a principle of action must be their errors, but then the virtues belonging to that principle must be their virtues also ; such errors may give a pretence to their enemies, but such virtues afford salvation to their country.\" CURRAN.

Be you, then, their saviours ; let your verdict snatch them from his ravening maw, and interpose between yourselves and endless remorse.\" FREEDOM OF THE PRESS. \" I do not pretend to be a mighty grammarian, or a formidable critic ; but I would beg leave to suggest to you in serious humility, that a free press can be supported only by the ardour of men who feel the prompting sting of real or supposed capacity ; who write from the enthusiasm of virtue or the ambition of praise, and over whom if you exercise the rigour of a grammatical censorship, you will inspire them with as mean an opinion of your integrity as your wisdom, and inevitably drive them from their post ; and if you do, rely upon it, you will reduce the spirit of publication, and with it the press of this country, to what it for a long interval has beeu, the register of births, and fairs, and funerals, and the general abuse of the people and their friends.\" AN INNOCENT VICTIM. ' ' That after that period of lingering deliberation passed, a third respite is transmitted ; that the unhappy captive himself feels the cheering hope of being restored to a family that he adored, to a character that he had never stained, and to a country that he had ever loved ; that you had seen his wife and children upon their knees, giving those tears to gratitude which their locked and frozen hearts could not give to anguish and despair, and imploring the blessings of eternal Providence upon his head who hail graciously spared the father, and restored him to his children ; that you had seen the olive-branch sent into his little ark, but no sign that the waters had subsided.

' ' A similar application was made in the beginning of this, in the lords of Great Britain, by our illustrious countryman, of whom I do not wonder that my learned friend should have observed, how much virtue can fling pedigree into the shade ; or how much the transient honour of a body inherited from man, is obscured by the lustre of an intellect derived from God .'"], [432, "400 \" Writhe with grace, and groan with melody\" OPPRESSION. \" Merciful God ! what is the state of Ireland, and where shall you find the wretched inhabitant of this land ?

And, to speak of this kingdom, was it the austerity of Andrews, the patriotism of Hutchinson, or the consistency and wisdom of the Earl of Tyrone, that has marked them out to his Excellency's favour ? The world will not easily believe that motives, such as these, induced his Excellency to promise a bishopric to the recommendation of a man who is fitter to preside over a brothel than an university ; or to be conducted by another, whose slippery prostitution has rendered even his infamy ridiculous. Nor will they believe, that the Earl of Tyrone, after having violated every engagement, private and public, into which he ever entered, has been selected for his consistency and honour ; or that his abilities have re commended him, when they reflect, that the elder Brutus must have been a less dissembler than the Earl of Tyrone has been from his earliest years, if his lordship's incapacity be counterfeit.

Page 322. \" Upon quitting St. Valori Cottage, near the Dargle, I paid a visit to that great mau, Grattan, whom I have with so much gratifi cation mentioned, at his beautiful seat called Tinnahinch, or the Little Peninsula, the approach to which is very fine. Tinnahinch, or Teine Inch ; the latter applies to some great altar of the pagan Irish, in or about the place so called. Teine signifies water; it also means stagnated water, and the water-marks of a river. Inch, or inis, or enis, signifies an island ; the Irish give this name eveu to lands not quite surrounded by water, as Inche-core, near Dublin, which has the Liffey in front, and a small stream parallel to it at the back, running to Kilmainham Gaol. Tinnahinch House stands at the base of a vast mountain, finely clothed with wood and verdure ; a little from the summit is Powerscourt, the princely residence of Viscount Powerscourt. \" Soon after my arrival, the distinguished owner of Tinnahinch conducted me through his beautiful grounds.

I had the peculiar happiness of seeing this great man in the bosom of his amiable, elegant, and accomplished family ; and in one of the greatest orators and politicians of the age, I saw the affectionate husband, the fond father, the luminous and profound scholar, the playful wit, and polite, well-bred, hospitable gentleman. Such is the man who, in his speeches upon the question of the paramount right of England to change the constitutional government of Ireland, displayed an eloquence before unkuown to that, and never surpassed in any country. This question underwent several discussions in 1780, 1781, and 1782; the speech which he delivered on the 19th of April, 1780, was, as I was informed by a gentleman who had the good fortune to be present when it was delivered, most brilliant, energetic, and im pressive; it effected the repeal of the 6th of George I., and for a period gave independence to his country ; for this speech alone the Irish Parliament, by an almost unauimous vote, granted him the sum of FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS! His speech also on the propositions, in 1785, is said to have teemed with the highest eloquence.* \u2014 The Stranger in Ireland, 1805. * On the election in question, I* was proposed by Mr. George Ponsonby, and upon Mr. Grattan rising next to vote upon my tally, he was immediately objected to as having been expelled on the report of Lord Clare's committee.

It was of an alarming nature ; Grattan mean while standing silent, and regarding, with a smile of the most ineffable contempt ever expressed, his shameless accusers. The objection was made by Mr. John Giffard, of whom hereafter.

THE CASTLE OF DUBLIN. OF MODERN DAYS. [From All the Year Round. Published by the kind permission of Charles Dickens, at the request of his friend, Ueorge Hodder, Esq., Morning Post.] The cheerful city which stands on the banks of the Liffey has special features and attractions of its own, and which almost take it out of that uniform pattern which belongs to most cities in the United Kingdom. It has architectural pretensions of no mean order, all its public buildings being in the same style, and almost of the same era ; being dis posed, too, with an eye to picturesque position and effect, under the direction of a parliament which, though corrupt, had the redeeming. merit of being sumptuous in all matters relating to the public. Of a fine summer's day, these broad streets, with what looks like a Grecian temple at a comer far away in the haze, with the bridges, and the ships lying at the quays, and the columns and statues, and the general air of vivacity, the crowded pathways and the light cars, which spring along cheerfully with the Celtic drivers stand ing up carelessly on one side looking out for fares, and, like \"jolly young watermen,\" never in want of one, give a curiously festive and almost foreign air to this Irish city. How then does a city, without trade, or manufactures, or law, look as gay and busy as if it were fattening on trade, and manufactures, and wealthy citizens ? We may set all this down to the presence of a Court \u2014 a Court which has heen called \"Brummagem,\" \"a sham,\" and a hundred such contemptuous names (who does not remember Mr. Thackeray's epigram about a Court Calendar being bad enough, but a sham Court Calendar), but which has still an extraordinary and unsuspected influence on the social pros perity of this city. A Court, after all \u2014 \" Brummagem \" or otherwise \u2014 is a Court ; that is to say, if it can boast a fine income, a handsome palace, has its guards, officers of state, and everything in keeping. At the proper time in the \" season \" the show begins, the grand rooms are thrown open, the Viceroy and the Vicereine are ready to see their subjects, to feast them in their halls. Then Irish paterfamilias, delighting in his beeves and his fields, with a sigh gives way. Mamma and the three daughters (they are like mothers and daughters everywhere"], [440, "408 Levees and Drawing-Rooms \u2014 Dublin Castle. else) have joined to persuade and intimidate. And pater familias, like his kind elsewhere, is not strong enough to withstand such pressure. He is reminded of what his duty is to his \"girls,\" under the just penalty of being stigma tised as a \" brute.\" And thus, when the season sets in, the country families come flocking up, and take houses in \" Fitzwilliam-street \" and \" Fitzwilliam-square,\" in \" Pem broke-place,\" and other \" genteel and genteely-named loca lities. We may suppose it to be the beginning of the season, and the night of the first drawing-room \u2014 for levees and drawing rooms have been going on here for centuries \u2014 and, with a sensible eye to picturesque effect, the drawing-rooms are always held at night. Towards ten o'clock carriages are con verging to the little hill from half-a-dozen different points, and form into one line ; inside of which, fluttering young girls, all trains and lapets, are folded up somehow. A crowd is at the gates, laughing, jesting, criticising, half satirically, but mostly with respect, the charms that pass them by. In side, in the court-yard, all the tall windows are lit up in long files, and the soldiers and police are drawn up ; and afar off under the arcade, where there is a blaze of light, the carriages are \"setting down,\" and driving away. Inside, there are great halls lined with soldiers, and a grand stair case, and long galleries Lined with servants and soldiers, and the long, long room where the company wait their turn, and crush on \u2014 as genteel crowds always will crush, even at places of yet better quality\u2014 to the barrier of the Pen. Under the brilliant light is seen a curious crowd, like the chorus at the opening of an opera, a variety of uniform that would delight an Aulic councillor. For, to say nothing of the dreadful \" court suit,\" still from necessity in universal favour, there are soldiers of every \" arm,\" sailors, privy coun cillors, in the rude rasping high collars, with coats of the \" robin redbreast \" cut, and a host of other varieties that would \" intrigue \" the Queen's chamberlain ; for Ireland, like France and Germany, is a uniform-ridden country. The police uniform is a uniform infinitely more showy than that of the Queen's rifles. The inspectors of this and that government office have their special dress. Even the Clerks of the Crown, legal officers, are resplendent in blue and silver, and \" run \" French senators very closely. Mixed up with all these are the stately matrons and the fresh young girls from the country, the special \" Irish \" faces, the \" violet eyes,\" placed beside the established reigning belles of the city itself. There is an endless chatter going on. Beyond,"], [441, "A Genial and Irish-Loving Nobleman. 409 is a second room and another barrier ; and beyond that is the Throne-room, where what we may hear a country gentle- man call \" the sermony \" takes place. Here we are at the barrier, kept sternly but not unkindly by a gigantic dragoon serjeant ; and now, fluttering, blushing, round-cheeked Miss Glorvina, you may get ready. For a \"sham,\" and a thing that we are taught is Brum- magem, the materiel for a \" sermony\" is very complete. Peeping into this Throne-room, which is all a -blaze with gold, with a coved ceiling, which has rich amber hangings and furniture to match, and which recals a state-room in the palace of St. Cloud, we can see a throne with a handsome canopy, and for a matter of spectacle, a very glittering pageant indeed. In front of the throne the Viceroy himself, who may be assumed to be that genial, gracious, pastime- loving, and Irish-loving nobleman, the late Earl of Carlisle, whose strangely heavy white hair, rosy full face, and gartered knee, make a picture that will be long recollected. On each side, in a semicircle, are his \"staff,' the dozen or so of \" aides,\" the \" master of the horse,\" \" comptroller,\" \" cham- berlain,\" \"gentlemen at large,\" \"state stewards,\" \"private secretaries,\" \" physicians to the household,\" \" surgeons to the household,\" make up a respectable and showy gathering. But opposite them, thus making a sort of semicircular lane, is a yet more effective crowd, the dignitaries and persons of quality of \" the Court,\" who have been privileged with what is called the \" private entree.\" Here we have archbishops and primates, and lord chancellors and lord justices, chief justices, lord mayor, deans, chaplains, heralds in gorgeous tabards, knights of St. Patrick, commanders of forces, privy councillors in profusion, earls, marquises, barons, and all the \" ladies\" of these illustrious persons. When we think that everyone looks their best and wears their best, and that every family diamond is put on to the best advantage, the whole must be a rather dazzling sight. But for them the whole spectacle must be a show of great interest and amusement. For here, now, the pages are letting down the agitated little Glorvina's train, and the dreadful moment is at hand. Her stately mamma, well accustomed to such a process, has stalked on majestically, undismayed if a whole regiment were drawn up there. Already the officials have got the little girl's card, and are passing it on from hand to hand, and the last has chanted it aloud : \" Miss Glorvina Sarsfield!\" with the addition \" to be presented !\" which, translated into English, means a viceregal privilege con secrated by immemorial usage. The deputy king has his 3 E"], [442, "410 A \" Connemara Rosebud\" in St. Patrick's Hall. tenths, as it were, strictly levied on every first presentation. The charming little Glorvina \u2014 a Connemara rosebud \u2014 now making her curtsey (practised again and again in Merrion square for many nights, and last night with papa standing up as viceroy on the rug, and the brothers doing the \" staff\"), is drawn over, and the osculatory tribute exacted in a half paternal fashion. Sometimes the confusion and maiden modesty are so intense, that C\u00e6sar can only obtain his tribute by a sort of game of hide-and-seek. But when a new viceroy arrives, everybody is presented, and the salut ing of some six hundred Irish ladies, however agreeable an occupation for a preux chevalier, is not without its alloy, for the process becomes wholesale and indiscriminating, and in the long female procession the most courageous might be occasionally appalled. This ordeal passed through, Miss Glorvina's train is care fully gathered up and restored to her, and she emerges into the long room, or gallery, where there is the crowd who have successfully passed through. One of the most enter taining things in the world is to stand at this door and study the play of human female expression as each emerge \u2014 the satisfaction, shyness, and complacency, which all struggle in the one face. This room is a fine picture, and has its own interest besides its architectural merits, lor it is hung around with the lords-lieutenant of nearly two hundred years back \u2014 the Buckinghams, Westmorelands, Dorsets, Townshends, and nearly every noble family in England. The series has been carefully and almost religiously kept up ; and people fond of prophecy discovered an omen in the fact, that after Lord Carlisle's picture there would be room for no more. But both prophecy and judg ment failed together \u2014 another lord-lieutenant came, and another more observing eye found room for a new picture. A study of these portraits is full of profit, and in these facts we might almost read the story of the government of the country. For here are clever, and weak, and cunning faces ; open, jovial, and unsuspicious countenances ; the reckless Townshend, the free debauched Rutland, the diplo matic Clarendon, the good-natured Eglinton, and the genial Carlisle. Next we troop into St. Patrick's Hall \u2014 the grand ball room \u2014 with the painted ceiling and the galleries, where the musicians play, and the mirrors and the scarlet tiers of seats. Here, too, is a dais, and another throne. And down this room, when the drawing-room is done, and the thousand or so of ladies, gentle and simple, have passed by, there is"], [443, "Sumptuous Hospitality \u2014 Dublin Castle. 411 \" the Procession,\" and vice-King and vice-Queen march solemnly and stately down, to the drumming and trumpet- ing of music in the gallery. By one o'clock all have departed ; and in the next morning's papers we have the \" correct List\" in due order of precedence, and, more pleasant reading still, a minute account of the jewels, dresses, laces, lappets, \" bouillons,\" \" buffons,\" and the rest. Almost next day, set in the dinners and balls. Country paterfamilias with his wife and daughters \u2014 a staunch sup- porter of government \u2014 is bidden. The late Lord Carlisle dispensed an almost sumptuous hospitality. Those weekly \" banquets,\" as they were called, where a hundred guests were entertained in the large St. Patrick's Hall, as elegantly and as perfectly as if it were a dinner of twelve, will not be soun forgotten. This amiable nobleman delighted in having \" his friends about him.\" He loved everything that the Irish would call \" sport,\" and was never wanting where \"sport\" called for him. It was worth seeing this Viceroy at the curious ceremony on St. Patrick's Day, when the guards were relieved at the Castle, and the bands played Irish airs, and the Viceroy appeared on his balcony literally loaded with shamrocks. A mass of the great unwashed below, crowded densely, listening to their national airs ; and when some stirring jig struck up, the charm became irresistible, a number of rings were instinctively formed, and then was Pat and Andy \" footing it,\" regardless of all proprieties. Police rushed up to avert the profanation ; but the good- natured Viceroy was seen protesting as furiously from his balcony, and the odd morning entertainment proceeded. As the fun waxed furious the contagion spread, more circles broke out, and presently the great yard was a mass of human beings dancing like dervishes. Of this St. Patrick's night was always, too, a special fea- ture\u2014a great ball in court dresses. The routine was always strictly the same. It was a sight to see. As the clock struck ten, the two lines of dancers formed, the court suits and swords making it look like a ball of the last century, and then at the signal the music in the gallery stnick up \" St. Patrick's Day in the Morning !\" and a fierce country dance set in. The king's heart was in that measure, and it was delightful to see with what unwearied vigour he pursued the fatiguing course, \" turning \" every one conscientiously until he reached the end. A \" Castle ball \" is always \" voted \" capital, and, indeed, about one floats a memory of a floor vast and smooth as ice, good dancing, brilliant lights, and the charming music of a Vienna valse. But there are other"], [444, "412 \" Sir Bernard,\" the most efficient of all Heralds. delights of which this festive hall is the scene.

This, too, is succeeded by the \" banquet,\" than which, in Ireland as in England, nothing can so worthily \"crown the work.\" Here, ton, when the late earl was \" king,\" were pleasant concerts, choruses of pretty ladies, and solos, for our late sovereign was an amateur, and loved a charming and brilliant voice just as much as he admired a charming and pretty face. Nothing was more delicate than the half-gallant half fatherly encouragement he had for all the belles of his court, and they were many ; so, too, with the interest and pride he felt in their success, and their marriages were nearly always celebrated with a handsome present, and honoured with his own presence. But among other shows and festivities. bound up in a manner with \" Castle life,\" is one which has a special charm. Long before the feeble halting society called the \" London Royal Academy of Music \" had come into wheezy life, there existed in Dublin, fully a hundred and twenty years ago, a society of the same class \u2014 the Irish Academy of Music, which has always a kind of fashionable patronage. Roman visitors will recollect the charming \" Societa Filarmonica \" and their delightful concerts, the feature of which was the rows of the fairest Roman ladies of the first quality and beauty, a princess or two even, sitting charmingly dressed, and giving an opera of Donizetti's. These refined and tuneful \" ladies \" will not soon be for gotten. It was truly an amateur performance, and was as pretty to look at as to listen to. Now in the Irish capital \u2014 and this may be quoted as an instance of kindred in Celtic nations \u2014 precisely the same thing may be seen, and at two concerts of this Irish Academy are there tiers and rows of rank and beauty \u2014 ladies who have been dancing the night before at Lady Mary Kilshandra's, in Merrion-sqnare \u2014 are to be seen seated side hy side, and with a strange indiffer ence to the purposes of social meetings, consent to a sort of enforced and cloistered segregation. But, to produce due musical effect, tenors must sit with tenors, and soprani with soprani. On one side the wreaths and ribbons are one colour, on the other side they are different. Here the \" amateur \" may see violet eyes and oval faces in plenty."], [445, "Titiens' and Santly's Reign. 413 Then for the performance. In this way have been \" recited \" nearly every opera of note \u2014 Malta, Don Giovanni, II Trova tore, Ernani, La Sonnambula, Norma, &c, with no lack of prima donnas or tenors. These are the most pleasing enter tainments that can be conceived. Indeed, the rage for music is quite a Dublin feature. The excitement is great, and at private houses the \" concert \" is going on all the year. Sometimes we see, about five o'clock, a street blocked with carriages, and from open windows have the music of the Italian quartette borne to us, and know that this is a musical \" tea \" going on. But the gala-time for the lower classes, for the shilling gallery and pit, is when the opera sets in (and we have nearly two months' opera every year), and then Titiens and Santly reign, and are borne on the wings of a tumultuous but discriminating ap plause. Not often do tve find, as the writer has seen, the great finale in the third act of Ernani encored by an \" un washed\" audience ; nor is it only in Italy that singers have \" ovations.\" Who will forget the Piccolomini furor, and the birds and wreaths lowered down to the stage, the speeching of that piquant little lady at one o'clock in the morning from her hotel window to a crowd of a thousand persons, the dragging home of her carriage every night 1 Or, as was the case with Grisi on her farewell, the torchlight proces sion 1 These things take us a little out of the world of prose and conventional buckram. The theatre, too, like music, is a special Irish taste. Amateur acting is in great favour. The \" soldiers \" have their season of five nights every year, taking the theatre, which is barely smaller than Drury-lane. It is built on the principle that the audience are to be \" shown off \" to the best Advantage as well as the actors, the whole \" dress circle \" being a sort of balcony \u2022 and when the company are crowded close, and the house full from floor to ceiling, the effect is very gay indeed. And on these \"command nights\" the viceregal box blazed with mirrors, and chandeliers, and hangings, and was filled with a staff, and soldiers mounted guard on the stairs and lobbies, and the manager, according to old custom, was seen in a court suit, and with a pair of wax-lights, walking backwards and showing the Viceroy to his box. So important an officer is he looked upon that the Theatre Royal manager may present himself \"at Court.\" As we look back through that old reign, very many of those pleasant theatrical nights present themselves, that white head \u2014 always conspicuous \u2014 that genial heart, ready to wel come and encourage all these pastimes. Now there was a"], [446, "414 Cricket \u2014 / Zingari \u2014 \" The Lodge.\" tragedy, now a comedy ; now there was a comedy of French manners skilfully adapted from the French, as skilfully acted and set off with new music, new dresses, and new scenery. The result was a gradual training of a corps of amateur actors, who were fast becoming a pleasant feature in the place, when there came that strange and gradual sinking, and the final break-down. These were the nightly joys. But when the summer evenings set in, there were other entertainments of an al fresco sort to amuse this pleasure loving society, and files of carriages were seen trailing through the pleasant avenues of the Park, making for the charming gardens of \" The Lodge\"\u2014 the Viceroy's country house \u2014 where were the dairymaids, and the cows, and the syllabub, fresh as new milk could make it, and the music playing, and the quadrilles of little children on the bowling green \u2014 perhaps the most amusing feature of the whole. More pleasant still were the cricket meetings, there being a viceregal club, for he delighted, not in the play itself, but in looking on and following it, and marking. Hither came every English club of note, specially I Zingari, with their gipsy colours, who were made welcome and \" put up \" vice royally in the cheerful apartments of \" The Lodge\" while the days of play lasted. In honour of these guests, the ball and the concert were set on foot, and many of I Zingari remember pleasantly those cheerful old cricket festivals. Yet with all this junketing, and fiddling, and high jinks night and day, this feasting and making merry, the city is not in a morally healthy condition. The strangest feature is the utter absence of the influence or presence of a middle class\u2014 a broad, loud-voiced, strong trading class. For all purposes of power or tone, this body, which should De the bones and muscles of every sound community, is a mere cypher. They make no sign. They are weak and retiring. For them is no round of honest middle-class amusement, the monster halls with the huge oratorios, an honest school of politics, an independent sterling school of politics, which should be sufficient for them. There is nothing of this kind. They fluctuate between those above them and below them. They pant for the cheap glories, the Brummagem \" fashion\" that is over their heads. They spend their lives sighing to be admitted into those choice en- closures, and are at last happy in their old age if they are allowed to look in over the rails, or sit on the wall. No- where, it must be confessed, does this upas of false \" gen- tility,\" this aping at selectness and \" fashion,\" spread its"], [447, "Ireland, a Hundred, and Twenty Years ago. 415 branches so wide and do such mischief as in the pleasant community.

And he opens his veins, it must be said, cheerfully. On every side we can see the \"slaving\" barrister and the \"slaving\" doctor, sitting up of nights, rising by candlelight, and with infinite pain scrapes together, out of fees ill paid and faithlessly pro mised, his thousand a-year or so, while mamma and the lovely Eliza are prancing it down the square, or plunging up to Madam Mantalini's, or mapping out their fifth or sixth \" steet dinner,\" or writing \" kerds \" for the third ball. Madame Mantalini already holds bills of papa's for a very large amount, and presently will be pressing. By-and-bye the poor pelican dies a little suddenly, and very akwardly, too, perhaps only the day before the festival to which the commander of the forces had been got to come ; and then we have whispers and shrugs, and a wail of sympathy \u2014 \" Very bad that of poor Dawson Dowdall ! I hear not a sixpence for the creditors. Mantalini has his bill for eight hundred.\" Pleasant as are the \" high jinks\" of the modem Dublin Court, they pale before its older glories. Ireland, a hundred and twenty years ago was like a separate kingdom, and was always spoken of as \" this kingdom.\" Dublin was some four days' journey from where there were no accidents ; but accidents were the rule, and delays at sea and on the road made a leisurely journey reach to a week. The fact of there being a parliament, a House of Lords and Commons, with a prime minister, a handsome revenue, a Chancellor of the Exchequer to regulate it, a set of brilliant debaters, the fame of whose eloquence became almost European, and, besides this, an \" Irish establishment,\" that is, a regular Irish army, raised and paid in that kingdom \u2014 these were elements enough to render the nation of an importance which it is pardonable its sons should look back to with regret and pride. There was yet another feature not quite so admirable, another sense for what was called the \" Irish Establishment,\" which bore lightly and cheerfully a load of English pensions for German princes and German mistresses, a \" pension on Ireland \" being the favourite \"job.\" It was only when this degrading burden reached to between sixty and seventy thousand a-year that the Irish Parliament modestly but gently began to remonstrate. To the readers of the old memoirs of those days, what"], [448, "The Dublin Court of the Past \u2014 The Stage. 416 brilliant flashes come back ! There was plenty of money in the country, though the peasantry was a miserable un enfranchised horde of serfs ; but the gentry and the nobility were in their turn the unenfranchised serfs of pleasure, building palaces worthy of Venice (and which are now to be seen standing), dancing, fiddling, gambling, drinking, and fighting, as a gallant gentleman of those days should. The grand cynosure of the Dublin Court was the stage. Those were the happy days for both theatres and actors, and with what happy effects their patronage was attended may be conceived from the splendid list of dramatic artists that Ireland has produced. The names of Barry, Macklin, Sheridan, Mossop, Ryan, Delane, among the men, and of Woffington, Kitty Clive, Mrs. Fitzhenry, Mrs. Bellamy, can scarcely be matched in any country. One hundred and thirty years ago there were four theatres in that city, all handsome and elegant, one of which now actually exists, and a portion of the wall of another where Garrick played, but helps to support a chapel, still stands. We look back very far to the days of Lord Chesterfield, the hollow, polished nobleman \u2014 yet not so false in Ire land \u2014 winning favour in that country, making epigrams on the Irish beauties, and \" cultivating \" Alderman Falkener. It was in his reign that the great Mr. Garrick paid his second visit to Dublin, and appeared at the \" Smock-alley \" Theatre. The Viceroy and his court were there every night, aud his Excellency, the Dublin papers said, was pleased ti i compliment Mr. Garrick rather extravagantly as the greatest actor that had ever appeared on any stage. Then was the Garrick fever brought on by overcrowding in the boxes and galleries, and the Dublin barrister, walking down to court by a short-cut, may thread his way through the \" Blind Quay,\" and the old, mean, and wretched houses, then houses of persons of quality, who must have been disturbed by the block of carriages, and the flashing of torches, and the shouts of footmen attendant on the ovation to the great actor. There was a pleasant gaiety, even an elegance, in the relations of the noblemen and gentlemen of this court. Amateur theatricals were all the rage \u2014 a taste that has always prevailed in Ireland. Each play was sure to be ushered in by some elegantly turned verses from \" an eminent hand.\" Indeed, every gentleman was trained to versify, and every compliment to a beauty assumed the unsubstantial shape of rhyme. The professional poet, Churchill, took a savage view of the"], [449, "Amateur Actors before the Union\u2014 St. Cecilia. 417 most seductive place in the world ; as some cynic did in the following halting lines : \u2014 Masshouses, churches, mixed together, Streets unpleasant in all weather, The church, the Four Courts, and hell* contiguous, Castle, College-green, and Custom-house gibbous ; Few things here are to tempt ye, Tawdry outsides, pockets empty. Five theatres, little trade, and jobbing arts, Brandy and Snuff-shops, post-chaises and carts ; Warrants, bailiffs, bills unpaid, Masters of their servants afraid ; Hogues that daily rob and cut men, Patriots, gamesters-, and f ootmen ; Women lazy, drunken, loose, Men in labour slow, of wit profuse, Many a scheme that the public must rue it, This is Dublin, if ye knew it. A pleasant subject, of a gossiping sort, would be the history of private theatricals, into which the annals of the Irish private stage would enter very largely. Everyone has heard of the Kilkenny theatricals,- whose records are already set out in a book of their own ; but it is impossible to peep into any social corner of Irish Life without getting a glimpse of the amateur stage with lamps lit, and the noble ladies and noble gentlemen in rich dresses, playing their parts. Every old faded newspaper is full of complimentary notices. One short specimen will show in what \" style \" these things were done before the Union. In 1793, a number of noble- men and gentlemen took Malachy's Theatre, set Italian artists to work, to paint and decorate. The ceiling was gorgeous with Apollo, and Tragedy and Comedy ; mirrors were let in to the pilasters of the boxes ; the seats were all upholstered in scarlet and fringe ; the decorations were all white and gold figures, with f estoonings of gold and crimson tassels; servants in gorgeous liveries attended on everyone in the boxes. The orchestra was filled with amateurs, and the players were Lord Westmeath, Captain Aske, Lord Thurles, Lord Cunningham, Buck Whaley, and many more. They played the Beggar's Opera, the Poor Soldier, the Rivals, School for Scandal, and such pieces. These were not mere stray performances ; but there was a regular season, and the theatre was rented for a number of years, until the Rebellion and the Union scattered both audience and company. Nor must we pass by a picturesque tribute to music, which is not so honoured in our time. St. Cecilia, the patroness of music, had her day kept with all honour. At the Castle * A narrow, dark lane at the rere of Christ Church. 3f"], [450, "A \"Castle Festival\" 140 Years Ago. 418 was maintained a full state band, generally under the com mand of some musician of eminence, and Dubourgh, who played with Handel, filled this office for a long time. On St. Cecilia's Day, all the court and persons of quality repaired in great pomp to St. Patrick's Cathedral, where the Reverend Doctor Swift, the Dean, no doubt, objected to such \" tweedle dum and tweedle-dee.\" A fine orchestra was erected, and Mr. Dubourg and his men fiddled away at Corelli, and Dr. Blow, and Purcell. The performance lasted from ten tdl three o'clock, and there was not standing room. Another custom obtained, which was that of keeping the king's birth day with great state and solemnity. There was a court in the morning, with a ball at night, and Sheridan, or Mr. Brooke, or Captain Jephson, or some Irish laureate, wrote an ode, which Mr. Dubourg \" set,\" and which was sung and fiddled by a large choir and orchestra. A \" Castle \" festival, a hun dred and forty years ago, took place in the \" old Beefeaters' Hall,\" and with seven hundred people all seated in tiers, the topmost row of the ladies' heads touching the ceiling. By eleven at night all the minuets were over, and the Viceroy and his lady adjourned to the basset table in another room. After an hour's play, the Duke and Duchess and their nobility adjourned to the supper-room, where there was a holly tree lit up with a hundred wax tapers, which made a prodigious impression ; but an English lady, who was present, and saw the spectacle of the noble company burst ing into the supper-room, says the scene was not to be described, \" squalling, shrieking, all sorts of noises ;\" ladies were stripped of their lappels, hustled, squeezed in the scuffle ; and poor Lady Santry was left more dead than alive. A glimpse, too, of the old coffee-houses, where the gentle men of Ireland drank wonderful claret at \" Lucas's,\" deservedly considered the most \"convenient,\" as there was a charming garden, or enclosure, at the back, where \" difficul ties\" were settled with dehghtful promptitude. The gentle men had only to move their chairs near to the windows, and were thus able to see the whole \" fun\" with comfort and ease. Lucas's was a haunt for certain persons of quality, and where anyone who wished to see what were called \" The Bucks\" was sure to be gratified. The Bucks were the fine gentlemen of the time, if finery consisted in ostentatiously savage manners and barbarous behaviour. Some belonged to the \" Hell Fire Club,\" and one of this society's feats is recorded \u2014 namely, setting their club-room on fire, and enduring the flames until they were all but suffocated and"], [451, "\" Daly's Club-House \" and \"the Ph\u0153nia.\" 419 burnt to death. This was by way of bravado, and to show their contempt for the torments which were held up to them from pulpits. Some were called Pink Dindies, whose pas- time was cutting off an inch or so of the scabbard of their swords, and prodding the victims of the jests with the blades, which thus could not penetrate much below the surface. The odious race of duelling bullies swarmed over the town \u2014 the \" Tiger Roches \" and others. One Buck would walk up and down Lucas's with a train to his cloak, and if any one trod on it, would instantly draw his sword. An old gentle- man, who was alive not long since, recollected a scene of- this sort at Lucas's, produced by this literal challenge to tread on the tail of one's coat, and where the unconscious offender was lucky enough to anticipate the bully's attack by running him through the body. In short, the fashionable mode for the Bucks was to range the city and seek for excite- ment by maiming or annoying the canaille, which was carried out by \" pinking,\" or \" sweating.\" We know what \" pinking\" was ; sweating\" was bursting into a house and carrying off guns and swords as trophies, just as knockers used to be wrenched by the \" bloods \" of yesterday's generation. Another set of gentlemen went about as \"Chalkers.\" Their pastime consisted of marking or maiming a person about the face. And the quality of these ruffians is at once characteristically determined by the Acts of Parlia- ment passed against the practice, in which, though visiting it with the severest penalties, it is stipulated there shall be nothing to corrupt the offender, or prejudice his family. Even now, next to the old Parliament House stands a stately building, cut up into half-a-dozen houses of business. This was once \" Daly's Club-house,\" where all the noblemen and gentlemen of both Houses would adjourn to dine and drink ; where were seen Mr. Grattan, and Mr. Flood with \" his broken beak,\" and Mr. Curran, and those brilliant but guerilla debaters, whose encounters both of wit and logic make our modern parliamentary contests sound tame and languid. There was seen that surprising Sir Boyle Roche, whose name and whose surprising \" Bird \" had done such good service, both in books and speeches. And there, too, we see honourable members emerging from under the classical portico, hot with rage and fury, and driving away to \"the Ph\u0153nix\" to arrange their differences. As we pass by and see that picturesque temple given over to the money- changers, and transformed into the Bank of Ireland, it is impossible for one who is thoroughly Irish not to regret"], [452, "Sackville-street before the Union. 420 those brilliant days, and the abrupt change from nationality to pure provincialism.* The year before the Union, as \"old inhabitants\" have told the writer, Sackville-street, long and broad as it is, was literally crowded with coaches and six, waiting, drawn up, to take down noble lords and noble gentlemen to \"the House.\" Only the year after the Union, as an ancient and fossilised coach-builder has also told us, the auction-marts and carriage-yards were encumbered with coaches and carriages and horses ; noblemen and gentlemen, now \" out of work,\" with their calling gone, literally flying from the unhappy capital. About the old Music Hall, now Fishamble-street Theatre, where Handel sat at his harpsichord, float the ghosts, aud clouds of a hundred fairy scenes and glories. Here it was that Lord Mornington \u2014 of \" ye spotted snakes \" memory founded this musical academy, which, by the rules, was to be strictly independent of all \" mercenary professors.\" A hundred years ago it was flourishing. The president was the facetious Kane O'Hara, who wrote \" Midas ;\" the leader of the band was Lord Mornington ; first violins, Count M'Carthy, Right Hon. Sackville Hamilton, Rev. Dean Bayley, and others ; bassoon, Colonel Lee ; violoncellos, Earl of Bellaunt, Sir John Dillou, two Hon. and Rev. Deans ; flutes, Lord Lucan, Captain Reid, Rev. J. Johnson ; harpsichord, Right Hon. W. Brownlow, Lady Freke, Miss Cavendish ; singers, Right Hon. Lady Caroline Russell, Mrs. Monck, Miss O'Hara, and a host of other notabilities. This place still stands ; and every night Malachy, enterpris ing manager as he is, gives the illegitimate drama, where the noble earl led the band, and my Lady Freke sat at the harpsichord. Masquerades, too. Mr. Gardiner, of the Blessington family, flits by as an old woman carrying her father in a basket ; considered the best and most ludicrous mask in the place, and Mr. HamUton as a French gouver nante.

But the character that we should have wished to see, and which has an interest for us beyond the gentleman who walked as Sterne's Slaukenbergias, fresh from the promontory of Noses, was \" Mr. Boswell,\" who * Only last year died the last surviving member of the Irish House, one of Nature's gentlemen\u2014 no mere remnant of an old generation, but fresh, buoyant, keeping pace with the younger world, the delight and admiration of his friends."], [453, "Irish Beauties at the Irish Court. 421 had, by this time, emptied his head of Corsica, and who was content with the character of Douglas. The chapter of Irish beauties at the Irish Court has always been a large one. Looking back, we can catch glimpses, at every era, of a train of belles of reputation. When all London was running wild after the lovely Gun- nings, and when a Secretary of State actually sent a guard of soldiers to walk after them in Hyde Park to keep the mob off, and when these brilliant but bold young ladies were rather courting such admiration, it was surprising that no one thought of hunting up the old stories of their Irish triumphs; for they, too, had been at \"the Castle,\" yet under circumstances a little humiliating. Their father, John Gunning, Esquire, had ruined himself, like many a fine Irish gentleman ; but his daughters, like many fine Irish ladies, must still go to the \" shows\" and keep up appear- ances ; yet both money and credit were unhappily gone, in which difficulty their mamma called in Mr. Thomas Sheri- dan, the manager of the Theatre Royal, Smock Alley, who kindly allowed the handsome girls to choose from the rich wardrobes of his green-room, and in this way they were enabled to go to \" the drawing-room.\" On another occa- sion, a charitable actress, passing through Great Britain- street, heard women crying in a second floor, and going in, found the two beauties and their mamma in the deepest distress, bailiffs having put in an execution. John Gun- ning, Esquire, was happily out of the way, as he always contrived to be. She befriended and rescued them. Long after, when the Irish girls made their wonderful matches, and became Lady Coventry and Duchess of Hamilton, it is said that the Irish manager had humbly asked to be invited to one of their parties, and was refused ; and Mrs. Bellamy, the actress who had saved them from the bailiffs, is also said to have met with the same neglect. Still, theirs were awkward secrets to bring to your host's party. In later times lively and not too strait-laced Saturnalia prevailed. Jovial vice-kings enjoyed their reigns. The Dublin caricaturists were never idle a moment. Looking over their works, we find open allusions to three very well- known ladies, who are always put down as Lady 0 r, Lady C e, and Lady Denny. The pranks of these dames amused the whole city ; their rivalries, their battles in the box lobbies of the theatre, and their doings at Court. All the world knew Lady Cahir, Lady Denny, and Lady Clare, but they did not heed what the world knew. One of the caricatures gave each a motto, more witty than compli- mentary. For Lady Clare, \" I declare for all men ;\" for"], [454, "The Game of \" Cutchaeutchoo \" at Dublin Castle. 422 Lady Cabir, \"I care for all men;\" and for the last, \"I deny no man.\" But the greater scandal was occasioned when it was known that one of these ladies had introduced an extraordinary game, in high favour at the Castle, and which went by the name of \" Cutchaeutchoo.\" Two recesses were fitted up at the end of the grand saloons ; and here, behind a curtain, the ladies prepared their toilet for the exciting sport. In a moment the floor was covered with a crowd of belles, and dowagers, and beaux, hopping about in the sitting attitude required by the game. Great was the laughter when a gentle dame of high degree was overthrown by the heavier assault of a stouter rival. Presently, as the fun waxed more furious, dresses were torn, hair disordered, paint on the fair faces began to rub off, and the whole became a romp. We are told, by an amusing satire, which dealt very severely -with these high jinks, that a vice-queen tried to stop them \u2014 Fair Hardwicke, thou whose social schemes Steer j ustly 'twixt the nice extremes ; but she was quite powerless. The theatre, after Mr. Garrick's departure, was in a law less state ; \" bloods\" ranged the stage and green-rooms as they pleased ; the manager was helpless. The pretty but overbearing Miss Bellamy \u2014 whose pettish quarrels with Garrick are amusing theatrical reading \u2014 was passing off the stage. One gala-night, when the viceroy and court were present, and the house crammed, one of the \" bloods,\" a Captain St. Leger, who was standing at the wings, had the freedom to put his lips to her shoulder as she went by. The offended actress at once turned on him, and gave him a slap on the face that rang through the house. The act took place in full view of the audience, who applauded loudly ; and Lord Chesterfield was seen to rise in his box, and clap his hands in approbation. He presently sent Major Macartney, his aide-de-camp, to require that Cap tain St. Leger should make a public apology, which was accordingly made in due form."], [455, "Gra-na Uile and the Stately Tudor. 423 APPENDIX N.
