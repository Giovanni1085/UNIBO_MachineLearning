This volume, it is hoped, will answer the purpose of two classes of readers\u2014 of the youthful student, who may wish to ohtain a knowledge of the leading events of European history, as a whole, before proceeding to a more elaborate examination of the annals of different countries ; of the general reader, who has neither the leisure nor the inclination for the comparison of a vast number of authorities, but requires the result of such a comparison set before him in a comprehensive form and an intelligible style. It cannot be said that there are many works in English litera ture adapted to the wants of the two classes we have indicated. Our insular position has, perhaps, affected our historical studies. At all events, in the great majority of our schools the history of Europe is ignored as a branch of special knowledge ; and the learner only gathers so much of it as may be derived from its connection with English history or the biography of illustrious men. A succinct view of European annals seems to be still a desideratum ; for the bulky volumes of Dr. Russell deter rather than invite the young reader ; and there are few compendiums which have any pretensions to accuracy or completeness. It is hoped, therefore, that the present volume may supply a want, and fill up an important gap in the student's historical library. It is not, indeed, a history of Europe, for the writer does not believe that any satisfactory analysis of the annals of a dozen important nations can be presented in so limited a space ; but it is a view of some of the most important events in that history \u2014 events whose influence for good or evil still endures, and which, in their relations, have affected, or still affect, the destiny of the whole human race. The writer has looked upon European history as a grand and somewhat tragic drama, characterised by many stirring scenes,"], [26, "XXII INTRODUCTION. and played by many great and heroic actors. Those scenes which have appeared to him best capable of isolated treatment, and yet most nearly related to one another, he has selected for such illustration as he was capable of \u2014 not meaning to imply that there are no other scenes as worthy of the student's con sideration, but believing that the most memorable, and the scenes most intimately connected with English interests, have actually been chosen. Each scene has been treated indepen dently, and yet its relation to other scenes has usually been indicated ; and the entire series, it seems to the author, is bound together by principles common to each member of it \u2014 principles which animate and influence the entire course of European history even to this day. It would have been easy, but, perhaps, fantastic, to have carried still further the dramatic analogy, and to have grouped these \" scenes\" into \" acts,\" of which one might have terminated with the battle of Hastings ; another, with the capture of Constantinople ; a third, with the dispersion of the Armada : but such a division must have been purely arbitrary, and could have answered no beneficial purpose. The writer has been guided in his selection by the following considerations : \u2014 The Battle of Tours (Scene I.) was chosen because it checked the progress of Saracenic conquest in the west of Europe. The Coronation of Charlemagne (Scene II.) was the fixing of the keystone in the arch of the great emperor's power and glory. His restoration of the Western Empire was the epoch from which the history of modern Europe really dates. To the victory w-on at Hastings by William the Normau (Scene III.) must be attributed the establishment of the two great western nations, France and England, whose rivalry has had so important an influence on each other's fortunes and character. The Council of Clermont (Scene IV.) inaugurated the mighty movement of the Crusades, which, if it did not recover the Holy Land from the Paynim, wrought a far more useful work by breaking up the old feudal system. The Siege of Orleans (Scene V.) was the first symptom of the decline -of the English power in France, and without that decline neither France nor England could have become what \u2014 happily for the world \u2014 France and England are. The Capture of Constantinople by the Turks (Scene VI.) threw open the treasures of Greek thoughts to the inquiring mind of Europe, just at the time that"], [27, "INTRODUCTION. XXIII the discovery of printing enabled them to be largely utilised. It was a necessary preliminary to the Seventh Scene, the Discovery of America by Columbus, which administered a further stimulus to the European mind, and developed the energies of the great maritime nation destined to become the most powerful and persevering of the enemies of the Papacy. The Lutheran Reformation, which dates from the Diet of Worms (Scene VIII.), would have been almost impossible but for the intellectual activity awakened by the preceding events. The Abdication of Charles V. (Scene IX.) was one of the immediate consequences of the Reformation, and one of the causes of the rapid progress of the Lutheran faith ; for the bigotry of Philip, his successor, which inspired the idea of the Spanish Armada (Scene X.), inflicted a heavy blow both upon his kingdom and his church exhausted the power and resources of Spain ; and raised up against Rome the incessant hostility of Protestant England. In tracing the progress of the reformed doctrines, it was impossible not to glance at the Battle of Liitzen (Scene XL), which holds the same relation to the history of Protestant Germany and Catholic Austria as the defeat of the Armada to the history of Protestant England and Catholic Spain. The Battle of Pultowa (Scene XII.) invites the reader to contemplate the rise of the Russian empire, now so powerful and disturbing an influence in the councils of Europe. In Scene XIII. , a glance at the last of Marlborough's splendid victories \u2014 the Battle of Malplaauet \u2014 reminds us of the check administered by that great general and statesman to the aggressive schemes of Louis XIV. and the ambition of France. France, a century later, received a similar check at Borodino (Scene XIV.), the turning-point of Napoleon's fortunes, and the first step in that downward course of the im perial conqueror which terminated at Waterloo (Scene XV.) In that immortal victory we recognise the last great scene in the mighty drama which has materially influenced the destinies of Europe. Nearly half a century has passed, and for weal or woe it still affects the progress of the nations, and diplomacy is still busy in patching up or endeavouring to rend in pieces the treaties which were its necessary consequence. To render these pages still more useful and interesting, the writer has introduced a plain translation of Eginhardt's \" Life of Charlemagne;\" biographical sketches of the three reformers,"], [28, "XXIV INTRODUCTION. Wickliffe, Huss, and Luther ; a view of the character and career of Columbus ; a summary of the principal events of the Crusades ; a careful memoir of Wallenstein, Duke of Friedland ; and a cursory review of the history of Charles XII. The latter seemed needful in explanation and illustration of the Battle of Pultowa. Between each scene a chronological summary of events, and a table of contemporary sovereigns, have been introduced, so that the reader has before him a tolerably comprehensive view of the chief occurrences which have distinguished the annals of modern Europe from the year 330 to 1815. To each chapter a list of authorities has been prefixed, to assist the student in that fuller investigation which it is the object of this volume to stimulate. In conclusion, the writer has only to add that he has endea voured to obtain the utmost accuracy of statement by a careful comparison of the best authorities. He makes no pretension to originality of view or audacity of speculation. He has aimed at being honest rather than brilliant, and has sought to instruct rather than to amuse. In surveying so wide a field, he may have occasionally passed too rapidly over one event, given an undue importance to another, or omitted a third which was not less worthy of consideration. In accumulating so many facts, he may have suffered an error to creep in, despite of assiduous watchfulness. But as his book has been honestly written, he believes it will be fairly judged ; and if the press and the public shall recognise in these pages an useful addition to the student's library \u2014 an historical compendium of interest to the general reader \u2014 his object will have been attained, and his ambition gratified.

Allah !\" Their first invasion, however, proved unsuccessful. Under the gallant leadership of Eudes, Duke of Aquitaine, Goths, Gascons, and Franks, united by a common interest, met the onset of the invaders, and defeated them under the walls of Toulouse. But the knowledge which they had obtained of the wealth and beauty of the land beyond the Pyrenees whetted their appetite for con quest, and they re-passed their mountain barrier in overwhelm ing numbers. Narbonne became one of their principal settle ments. They claimed Languedoc (Septimania) as a lawful dependence of the Spanish monarchy, and their laws, religion, and government speedily overran the south of France, from the mouth of the Garonne to that of the Rhone. 2. Their greed of conquest was not yet satiated, and when the Moslems of Spain obtained the consent of the Khalif to the re-appointment of their veteran and successful leader, Abdal rahman, or Abderrahman Ibn Abdillah Alghajeki, to tbe * \" At the death of Mahomet, in 632, his temporal and religious sovereignty embraced, and was limited by, the Arabian peninsula. The Eoman and Persian empires, engaged in tedious and indecisive hostility upon the rivers of Mesopo tamia and the Armenian mountains, were viewed by the ambitious fanatics of his creed as their quarry. In the very first year of Mahomet's immediate successor, Abubeker, each of these mighty empires was invaded. The crumbling fabric of Eastern despotism is never secured against rapid and total subversion ; a few victories, a few sieges, carried the Arabian arms from the Tigris to the Oxus, and overthrew with the Sassanian dynasty the ancient and famous religion they had professed. Seven years of active and\" unceasing warfare sufficed to subjugate the rich province of Syria, though defended by numerous armies and fortified cities ; and the Khalif Omar had scarcely returned thanks forthe accomplishment of this conquest, when Arnron, his lieutenant, announced to him the entire reduction of Egypt. After some interval, the Saracens won their wav along the coast of Africa, as far as the pillars of Hercules, and a third province was irretrievably torn from the Greek empire. These western conquests introduced them to fresh enemies, and ushered in more splendid successes. Encouraged by the disunion of the Visigoths, and invited by treachery, Musa, the general of a master who sat beyond the opposite extremity of the Mediterranean Sea, passed over into Spain and within about two years the name of Mahomet was invoked under the Pyrenees.\" \u2014 H_ll_u, Middle Ages."], [33, "CONDITION OF THE FRANKISII MONARCHY. 5 government of their country in 729, they glowed with the assured hope of a speedy and complete victory. He had already obtained a splendid repute by his conquests in Spain and Africa. His liberality and valour secured the attachment of his troops. His previous expeditions against the Franks had brought him acquainted with their tactics and mode of fighting. His fana ticism animated him with an inappeasable longing to promulgate the doctrines of Mahomet wherever the sword of the Moslem could hew a path, and to avenge the slaughter of the true believers who had fallen under the fatal walls of Toulouse. 3. Tbe condition of the Frankish monarchy at this period was also au incentive to Saracenic ambition. \" Gaul was not yet France,\" says Sir Edward Creasy ; \" in that, as in other provinces of the Roman empire of the West, the dominions of the C\u00e6sars had been shattered as early as the fifth century, and barbaric kingdoms and principalities had promptly arisen on the ruins of the Roman power. But few of these had any permanency, and none of them consolidated the rest, or any considerable number of the rest, into one coherent and organised civil and political society. The great bulk of the population still consisted of the conquered provincials ; that is to say, of Romanised Celts \u2014 of a Gallic race which had long been under the dominion of the C\u00e6sars, and had acquired, together with no slight infusion of Roman blood, the language, the literature, the laws, and the civilisation of Latium. Among these, and dominant over them, roved or dwelt the German victors \u2014 some retaining nearly all the rude indepen dence of their primitive national character, others softened and disciplined by the aspect and contact of the manners and institu tions of civilised life.\" Gradually the Franks (a confederation of tribes originally dwelling on the Rhine, the Maine, and the Weser) asserted a superiority over the other German races, under the leadership of the early Merovingian monarchs. This dynasty, however, had rapidly degenerated, and the Mayors of the Palace usurped their functions, privileges, and power \u2014 all save their title. Pepin Heristal actually assumed the sove reignty of a great portion of the kingdom, under the title of Duke of Austrasia ; and in the battle of Sestry, a.d. 687, extin guished the independence of Neustria. He was succeeded by his son Charles, who, in the name of the titular king, exercised as much sovereignty over the discordant counts and lords as"], [34, "6 BATTLE OF TOURS. they could be constrained to acknowledge. He was constantly engaged in fierce struggles with the barbarous and Pagan tribes that dwelt on the right bank of the Rhine, and who were yearly pouring their predatory hordes across the river. In these cam paigns, however, he acquired a degree of military skill, and his soldiers an unity of discipline and spirit, which eventually proved the safety and security of Christendom. 4. Abdalrahman commenced his scheme of conquest and proselytism by establishing order in the administration of Spain. He found the passes of the Pyrenees occupied by the troops of Munuza, a Moorish chief, who had formed an alliance with Duke Eudes of Aquitaine, and suffered the loveliness of the duke's daughter to damp his ardour for the creed of his fathers. Abdalrahman led against him a formidable army, captured in succession his strongest fortresses, slew him as he sought to escape beyond the Pyrenean heights, and sent his widow a captive to Damascus. Thus freed from internal enemies, he mustered his splendid hosts \u2014 the Moslems of Spain, the chivalry of Arabia, the horsemen of Berber \u2014 announced to them a new war in honour of the Crescent, and, in the summer of 732, at the head of 100,000 men, swept exultantly through the passes of the Pyrenees. Without pause, he crossed the Rhone, and laid siege to Aries. A Christian army, collected by Duke Eudes, attempted its relief. The battle which ensued was desperately contested, but resulted in the victory of the Saracens. The slaughter among the Franks was terrible, and the arrowy Rhone carried down their dead bodies in thousands to the tideless Mediterranean. As late as the thirteenth century the tumuli, of the slain were visible upon the battle-field. Having captured and plundered Aries, Abdalrahman led his triumphant army across the Dordogne and Garonne, which mingle their waters jointly with those of the Gulf of Bordeaux. His progress was marked by the .worst signs of war \u2014 by the ashes of desolated homesteads, the ruins of profaned altars, the corpses of the Frankish peasants, and the tears of maidens who would gladly have yielded life if they could have preserved honour. Beyond the two rivers the Saracen was again opposed by the undaunted Eudes. He had raised a second army ; but troops so hastily gathered together were easily broken by the superior discipline and furious enthusiasm of the Moors, and underwent so fearful"], [35, "PROGRESS OF ABDALRAHMAN. 7 a defeat that the monkish chroniclers sorrowfully protest, \" God alone could count the number of the slain.\" 5. The Saracenic leader continued his triumphant progress, devastating those provinces which are known to the moderns as Perigord, Saintonge, and Poitou, threatening the walled towns of Tours and Sens, and flinging his marauders into Burgundy as far as Lyons and Bisaucon. \" The memory of these devas tations,\" says Gibbon, \" for Abderame did not spare the country or the people, was long preserved by tradition ; and the inva sion of France by the Moors, or Mahometans, affords the groundwork of those fables which have been so wildly disfigured in the romances of chivalry, and so elegantly adorned by the Italian muse. In the decline of society and art, the deserted cities could supply a slender booty to the Saracens ; their richest spoil was found in the churches and monasteries, which they stripped of their ornaments and delivered to the flames ; and the tutelary saints, both Hilary of Poitiers and Martin of Tours, forgot their miraculous powers in the defence of their own sepulchres. A victorious line of march had been prolonged above a thousand miles from the rock of Gibraltar to the banks of the Loire ; the repetition of an equal space would have carried the Saracens to the confines of Poland, and the High lands of Scotland. The Rhine is not more impassable than the Nile or Euphrates, and the Arabian fleet might have sailed without a naval combat into the mouth of the Thames. Perhaps the interpretation of the Koran would now be taught in the schools of Oxford, and her pupils might demonstrate to a circumcised people the sanctity and truth of the revelation of Mahomet.\" 6. The on -rush of the Saracens, happily for Europe, was stayed by the courage and genius of one man \u2014 Charles, the illegitimate son of Pepin Heristal, Mayor of the Palace to the French king, and, in his father's right, Duke of Austrasia. His abilities had already attracted the reverence of the surround ing nations, and now, in their peril, they appeared before him as suppliants, beseeching him to rescue the West from the dominion of the Crescent. \"All the nations of the Franks,\" say the Arabian chroniclers, \" trembled at that terrible army, and they betook them to their king Caldus, and told him of the havoc made by the Moslem horsemen, and how they rode at"], [36, "8 BATTLE OF TOURS. their will through all the land of Narbonne, Tonlouse, and Bourdeaux ; and they told the king of the death of their count. Then the king bade them be of good cheer, and offered to aid them; and in the 114th year of the Hegirahe mounted his horse, and he took with him a host that could not be numbered, and went against the Moslems. And he came upon them at the great city of Tours ; and Abderrahman, and other prudent cavaliers, saw the disorder of the Moslem troops, who were loaded with spoil ; but they did not venture to displease the soldiers by ordering them to abandon everything except their arms and war-horses. And Abderrahman trusted in the valour of his soldiers, and the good fortune which had ever attended him. But such defect of discipline is always fatal to armies. So Abderrahman and his host attacked Tours to gain still more spoil, and they fought against it so fiercely, that they stormed the city almost before the eyes of the army that came to save it ; and the fury and the cruelty of the Moslems towards the inhabitants of the city were like the fury and the cruelty of raging tigers. It was manifest that God's chastisement was sure to follow such excesses, and fortune thereupon turned her back upon the Moslems. 7. \" Near the river Loire, the two great hosts of the two lan guages and the two creeds were set in array against each other. The hearts of Abderrahman, his captains, and his men were filled with wrath and pride, and they were the first to be^in the fight. The Moslem horsemen dashed fierce and frequent forward against the battalions of the Franks, who resisted man fully, and many fell dead on either side, until the going down of the sun. Night parted the two armies, but in the grey of the morning the Moslems returned to the battle. Their cava liers had soon hewn their way into the centre of the Christian host; but many of the Moslems were fearful for the safety of the spoil which they had stored in their tents, and a false cry arose in their ranks that some of the enemy were plundering the camp ; whereupon several squadrons of the Moslem horse men rode off to protect their tents. But it seemed as if they fled, aud all the host was troubled. And while Abderrahman strove to check their tumult, and to lead them back to battle, the warriors of the Franks came around him, and he was pierced through with many spears, so that he died. Then all the host"], [37, "DEFEAT OF THE MOSLEMS. 9 fled before the enemy, and many died in the flight. This deadly defeat of tbe Moslems, and the loss of the great leader and good cavalier, Abderrahman, took place in the hundred and fifteenth year.\" * 8. From the confessions of the Saracen chroniclers it is evi dent that the seven days' battle of Tours resulted in the total dispersion of the Moslems.-)\" Some authorities pretend that the Arabs lost 375,000 men, while of the Christians only 1,007 fell, but there exist no means of estimating the number of killed on either side. It is doubtful whether the Saracen leader took more than 100,000 men into the battle. That of these the great majority were slain on the field, or in the pursuit, is probable. When once the bonds of discipline were loosed, the fugitives, retreating through a hostile country, where every mile was marked by the traces of the desolation they had accom plished, would meet with but little mercy. Certain it is that the completeness of the victory obtained for the victor the expressive surname of Martel, or \" the Hammer,\" and that the Moslems made no other attempt to extend their dominion beyond the snow-crested heights of the Pyrenees. The Crescent streamed no more its baleful light upon the hills and valleys of southern France. Charles the Hammerer was left to establish his dynasty on the throne of the Franks, having laid at Tours the foundation stone of the mighty empire which his grandson, Charlemagne, accomplished, to the great gain and glory of Christendom. 9. It is impossible to describe with any attempt at precision the locality of the battle-field. It is placed by the contemporary chroniclers between Tours and Poitiers, and most writers agree that it was near the latter town, and not far from the ground where Clovis, in 507, beat back Alaric and his Visigoths, and saved Europe from Paganism \u2014 not far from the ground where Edward the Black Prince, several centuries later, defeated the immense hosts of John of France. No memorials mark this celebrated champ de Mars, which, as Hallam observes, is re- * See Conde's History of the Arabs in Spain (Bohn's edition). t Yet Sismondi and Michelet are both agreed that the battle was indecisive, and the Saracen loss inconsiderable. It is difficult, however, to come to this con clusion upon a careful examination of evidence, though it may be admitted that the loss of the Franks was great in proportion to their numbers, and that Charles Martel did not press the pursuit with much activity. The results of the victory, nevertheless, are the best testimony to its completeness. \u2014 See Sismondi's His toire de I'Etablissement des Gaules ; and compare Hallam's Middle Ages, chap. i."], [38, "10 BATTLE OF TOURS. markable, since, after so immense a slaughter, we should expect the testimony of \"grandia effossis ossa sepulchris.\" The ground is well adapted to the movements of great armies \u2014 a rich and gently undulating champaign country, fertilised by several streams, and crossed by two or three ranges of brown, heathy hills, which pleasantly break the monotony of the general land- scape. 10. The battle of Tours has been characterised by Schlegel in vivid terms, as \" the mighty victory which the French hero gained over the Arab general, Abderame, who fell on the field with the flower of his troops, in the twentieth year after the conquest of Spain, and in the hundred and tenth year of the Hegira. Thus did the arm of Charles Martel save and deliver the Christian nations of the West from the deadly grasp of all destroying Islam.\"* Dr. Arnold places it among \" those signal deliverances which have affected for centuries the happiness of mankind ;\" -f and Hallam, among \" those few battles of which a contrary event would have essentially varied the drama of the world in all its subsequent scenes.\" J But the contemporaries of the illustrious hero neither appreciated its importance, nor manifested any gratitude for his services to the Christian Church. \" It might have been expected,\" says Gibbon, \" that the saviour of Christendom would have been canonised, or at least applauded, by the gratitude of the clergy, who are indebted to his sword for their present existence. But in the public distress the Mayor of the Palace had been compelled to apply the riches, or at least the revenues, of the bishops and abbots, to the relief of the state and the reward of the soldiers. His merits were for gotten, his sacrilege alone was remembered; and, in an epistle to a Carlovingian prince, a Gallic synod presumes to declare that his ancestor was damned ; that on the opening of his tomb, the spectators were affrighted by a smell of fire and the aspect of a horrid dragon ; and that a saint of the times was indulged with a pleasant vision of the soul and body of Charles Martel, burn ing, to all eternity, in the abyss of hell.\" \u00a7 Thus, it is left for posterity to redress the wrongs which great men invariably * Schlegel's Philosophy of History. t Arnold's History of the Later Roman Commonwealth, 1 Hallam's Middle Ages. \u00a7 Gibbon's Decline aud Fall of the Roman Empire."], [39, "11 THE JUSTICE OF POSTERITY. suffer from their contemporaries ; to reverse unjust judgments, to dispel the calumnies of bigotry or prejudice, to estimate the difficulties of their position, and allow for the current of circum stance which often sweeps them away from their intended footing; and, finally, to offer on their shrines the earnest and admiring gratitude of a world benefited by their sufferings, sorrows, and achievements."], [40, "CHRONOLOGICAL LINKS BETWEEN THE BATTLE OF TOURS AND THE CORONATION OF CHARLEMAGNE.

The coronation of Charlemagne as Emperor of the West was the great event of the ninth century, which appropriately opened with it. It seemed as if the glories of the ancient Roman empire were about to revive, but established on a surer basis, and informed by a more enlightened spirit. The original connection of the Papacy with the Greek empire, which a series of causes had undermined, was now entirely dissolved, and Con stantinople became the seat of the Greek Church \u2014 Rome, of the Catholic. From this epoch, too, may be dated the rise of the temporal power of Rome, which first manifested itself in placing the imperial crown on the head of Charlemagne. Henceforth a policy of aggression was astutely carried out by succeeding popes, who, at first the councillors, and apparently the vassals, of"], [42, "14 CORONATION OF CHARLEMAGNE. the empire, soon arrogated to themselves a supremacy over all temporal crowns and thrones, and claimed the right of making and unmaking kings. The great error in the political conduct of Charlemagne was his subservience to the ecclesiastical power ; but he required the sanction of the Church to bind together the discordant elements of his empire, and illustrate his extended authority with a species of celestial halo. The tiara was called to the aid of the imperial crown ; the pontifical crozier enforced the decrees of the imperial sceptre. In due time the tiara out shone the crown, and the sceptre became less terrible than the crozier. The empire broke into a hundred fragments; but the Church, in the plenitude of its infallibility, stood apparently unshaken amid the desolation and the ruin. 2. In the year 800, the empire established by the genius and energy of Charlemagne included the greater portion of civilised Europe. France, Spain, Italy, Germany, and Hungary owned his supremacy, and were governed by his edicts. The Roman provincia of Gallia had been erected into the independent monarchy of France, and Charlemagne had subdued the restless and predatory Britons, extending the limits of the monarchy to the shores of the ocean. The conquest of Aquitaine carried it, on the other side, to the foot of the lofty Pyrenees, and France was thus enlarged to its present boundaries, with the additions of Spain and Holland, as far as the Rhine ; for the great emperor had secured the obedience of the Saracens, and his counts or governors administered the affairs of the Spanish March from the Pyrenees to the Ebro. Barcelona was the residence of the French governor. He possessed the counties of Rousillon and Calatonia ; and the infant kingdoms of Navarre and Arragon were subject to his jurisdiction. As King of the Lombards, and Patrician of Rome \u2014 the latter a dignity formerly conferred by the Greek emperors \u2014 he ruled over the richest portions of Italy : the Arno, and the Tiber, and the Po ; the city of the islands ; the city of the Seven Hills ; olive groves and fertile meadows, shadowy valleys and pine-clad slopes. Germany, which had opposed so noble a resistance to the sword of olden Rome, had been conquered by Charlemagne ; and, after a war of three-and-thirty years, the truculent Saxons acknow ledged the sceptre of the emperor and the Cross of Christ. To the Baltic and the Vistula extended the influence of his fame and"], [43, "HIS RECEPTION IN ROME. 15 the terror of his arms; and even the Huns or Avars of Pannonia were humbled beneath his sway. \"Their rings,\" says Gibbon. \" the wooden fortifications which encircled their districts and villages, were broken down by the triple effort of a French army that was poured into their country by land and water, through the Carpathian mountains, and along the plain of the Danube. After a bloody conflict of eight years, the loss of some French generals was avenged by the slaughter of the most noble Huns ;* the relics of the nation submitted ; the royal residence of the Chagan was left desolate and unknown ; and the treasures, the rapine of 250 years, enriched the victorious troops, or decorated the churches of Italy and Gaul.\" 3. Thus, the Carlovingian empire extended from the Elbe on the west to the Vistula on the east, binding together, by the cohesion of a firm rule and equal laws, nations which differed widely in customs, manners, and language, and diffusing over the vast extent a knowledge of the principles of Christianity. The princes of England and Scotland, the turbulent chiefs of Ireland, solicited the friendship of Charlemagne as an honour. The celebrated hero of the Arabian story-teller \u2014 the Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid \u2014 received his ambassadors, and despatched to him the most splendid gifts. To so much glory it was diffi cult to make any suitable addition ; but the Church sought to bind more closely to its side an ally so powerful and so sincere, and resolved to revive in his honour the illustrious title of the Roman emperors. He was received in the Eternal City with the most sumptuous ceremonial. Its streets were crowded with patrician and plebeian \u2014 with the fair-haired Frank and the dark eyed Italian \u2014 all eager to gaze with respectful admiration on the Hero of the West, the champion of Christianity and civilisation. Wine flowed from the fountains, and festal music rolled upon the air in waves of triumphant harmony. The acclamations were redoubled when the Romans perceived that, to prove his respect for the memories of Roman greatness, he had adopted for that day the costume of a Roman citizen \u2014 \" longa tunica et chlamyde amictus, et calceamentis quoque Romano more formatis.\" * \" Quot pr\u00e6lia in eo gesta ! quantum sanguinis effusum sit!

Never had a more splendid procession celebrated the triumphs of the heroes of the Republic, or the victories of the early C\u00e6sars, than attended Charlemagne, on the Christmas Day of the year 800, to the church of St. Peter. The holy rites of the Church were performed with unusual solemnity, and then Leo, the Pope, suddenly placed a crown of gold and gems upon the hero's head, and a mighty shout arose on every side \u2014 \" Long life and victory to Charles, the most pious Augustus, crowned by God the great and pacific Emperor of the Romans!\" The royal unction was next poured from the ampulla upon the head and body of Charlemagne, and the Pontiff adored and saluted him, as the Roman Pontifex had been wont to worship and salute the C\u00e6sars. An oath was administered which bound him to maintain the faith and privileges of the Church, and the emperor in his turn enriched the shrine of the apostle with costly offerings. He afterwards declared that he was ignorant of the Pope's intention ; but he could hardly have misunderstood the meaning of the vast preparations made for a ceremony so important, and his journey reveals both his knowledge and his expectation. He had admitted (says Gibbon) that the imperial title was the object of his ambition, and a Roman synod bad pronounced it the only adequate reward of his merit and services. 4. The traveller who is departing from a distant mountain notes how it looms with large and imposing grandeur through the mists encircling it ; how its crest seems crowned with glory ; and how its sides, hung with shaggy woods, assume dimensions the hugest and most formidable. But he also observes that the ravine upon which he lately gazed with eager eye, and the brook whose eddying course he tracked down the wooded slope, are no longer visible. The distant has grown sublimer, but less interesting. He may now wonder at the bulk, but he no longer admires the details. So, to us of a later day, Charlemagne appears a vast and portentous phantom, rising with lurid majesty through the shadows of centuries, and dwarfing by his greatness the men of his own generation. But we cannot examine him more closely. We are unable to trace the features of the giant. We can but speculate upon the motives which actuated his conduct ; we are ignorant of the intricacies of his policy; we cannot justly estimate the peculiarities of his character. But it is certain that his genius was capable of the"], [45, "THE MAYORS OF THE PALACE. 17 grandest conceptions, and of the noblest ideas ; that he was eminently in advance of his age ; and not only a conqueror, but a reformer. He did not only destroy, he built up. He was the architect of an empire greater than that of the C\u00e6sars; though the very qualities which helped to make it great tended to its inevitable dissolution as soon as its superintendence passed to a weaker mind. His activity was something wonderful; and when one reads of all he accomplished, one cannot but imagine that one is perusing the records of several generations rather than the chronicle of a single life. As Hallam says, justly, \" He seemed born for universal innovation. In a life restlessly active, we see him reforming the coinage, and establishing the legal divisions of money ; gathering about him the learned of every country ; founding schools, and collecting libraries ; interfering, but with the tone of a king, in religious controversies ; aiming, though prematurely, at the formation of a naval force ; attempt ing, for the sake of commerce, the magnificent enterprise of uniting the Rhine and Danube ; and meditating to mould the discordant codes of Roman and barbarian laws into an uniform system.\" 5. In the preceding chapter (Scene I.) we have sketched the fortunes of Charles Martel, Duke of Austrasia, the hero of the great victory of Tours. He bequeathed his talents and his ambition, as well as his wealth and honours, to his son Pepin, who ruled over France as Mayor of the Palace to its nominal sovereign, Childeric III., exercised all the powers and privi leges, and wanted nothing but the title, of royalty. The Franks could ill understand this distinction between \" the name and substance\" of their government. They required the foremost man, the ablest, the bravest \u2014 the Konning or Can-do man \u2014 to be really and absolutely their king. They saw in Pepin a successful ruler and a gallant soldier ; in Childeric, the feeble slave of his own vices ; and they preferred to call the former their sovereign, thus reconciling in his person the theory and practice of their constitution. Pepin was not unwilling to assume the high dignity placed within his reach ; but both he and his nobles were bound by an oath of fidelity to the nominal occupant of the throne, and both he and his nobles sent ambassadors to Rome, to the pontiff who sat in the sacred chair of St. Peter, that they might have their scruples resolved, and c"], [46, "18 CORONATION OF CHARLEMAGNE. obtain absolution from their promise. At this time the Pope was in imminent danger from the aggressions of the Lombards (Longobards), to whom the love of arms and rapine was con genial, and he needed the help of a clear brain and a strong arm. Stephen decided, therefore, in favour of Pepin. He declared that the Franks might lawfully unite in the same person the title and authority of king; and ordered that the unfortunate Childeric should be degraded, shaved, and consigned to the oblivion of a monastery.* The Merovingian dynasty vanished, and Pepin was exalted on the shield as founder of a more glorious race \u2014 the Carlovingian sovereigns of France. His coronation was twice performed \u2014 once, with the sanction of the Pope, by St. Boniface, the Apostle of Germany; and again by the grateful hands of Stephen himself, who, in the monastery of St. Denis, placed the regal circle on the head of the chosen of the Franks. 6. Thus bound by the ties of gratitude to tbe Roman see, Pepin declared himself its champion and defender ; and when Stephen III., unable to soothe the inexorable mind of the king of the Lombards, implored the assistance of France, he eagerly girded on his sword, and led his army across the Alps. The Lombards were unable to oppose his daring onset. Beaten and humiliated, they obtained an ignominious peace upon pledging themselves to restore to the Roman Church its ancient posses sions, the provinces of Romagna and the March of Ancona. But no sooner had the spears of the Franks retired beyond the mountains, than Astolphus broke through the solemn oaths he had taken, and surrounded the Sacred City with the gleam of his arms. In his despair, the Pope again invoked the aid of Pepin, in the name and person of St. Peter, who was made to assure his adopted sons, \" the king, the clergy, and the nobles of France, that, dead in the flesh, he was still alive in the spirit ; that they now heard, and must obey, the voice of the founder and guardian of the Roman Church ; that the Virgin, the angels, the saints, the martyrs, and all the host of heaven unanimously urged the request, and would confess the obliga- Hddencum regem, qui jussu Stephani, Romani pontificis, depositus ac detonsus, atque m monasterium trusus est, durasse putatur.

This appears to be the earliest instance of the exercise of papal authority in the deposition or election of kings."], [47, "THE OPENING OF HIS CAREER. 19 tion ; that riches, victory, and paradise would crown their pious enterprise; and that eternal damnation would be the penalty of their neglect, if they suffered his tomb, his temple, and his people to fall into the hands of the perfidious Lom bards.\" Pepin was not deaf to the prayer of St. Peter. Once more he descended with his legions into the fertile plains of Italy, chastised the aggressive Lombards, and rescued Rome. The work so successfully begun by Pope Stephen and Pepin was accomplished by Pope Adrian I. and Charlemagne. The passes of the Alps were seized by Frank detachments ; Pavia was besieged and taken ; and Desiderius, the last of the Lom bard kings, surrendered his sceptre to the Western conqueror. 7. Pepin, full of years and honours, died in 768, dividing his possessions between his two sons. To Charles he bequeathed the Frankish, and to Carloman the Austrasian or German kingdoms. But the opportune decease of the latter soon reunited (a.d. 772) the Frankish empire under one sceptre, wielded by an able and powerful hand. Almost the first great achievement of Charle magne was the reduction of the Lombard kingdom (a.d. 774) ; but he soon turned away from the sunny fields of the south to prosecute his conquests among the wilds and forests of the north. As a prelude to this important task he visited Rome, and was received with all the honours due to so potent an ally. The Exarchs, representatives of the Emperors of the East, had never been distinguished by greater pomp, and new decorations were suggested by the joy and gratitude of Pope Adrian I. \" No sooner was he informed,\" says Gibbon, \" of the sudden approach of the monarch, than he despatched the magistrates and nobles of Rome to meet him, with the banner, about thirty miles from the city. At the distance of one mile, the Flaminian was lined with the schools* or national communities, of Greeks, Lombards, Saxons, &c. The Roman youth were under arms, and the children of a more tender age, with palms and olive branches in their hands, chanted the praises of their great deliverer. At the aspect of the holy crosses and ensigns oi the saints, he dis mounted from his horse, led the procession of his nobles to the Vatican, and, as he ascended the stairs, devoutly kissed each * The word school, by a gradual corruption of meaning, comes from the Greek <rx-oXt), \" leisure.\" The schools referred to in the text were military staffs and the offices of public functionaries, not collections of youthful students. c 2"], [48, "20 CORONATION OF CHARLEMAGNE. step of the threshold of the apostles. At the portico, Adrian expected him at the head of his clergy. They embraced, as friends and equals ; but in their march to the altar, the king or patrician assumed the right hand of the Pope.\" 8. This pious duty accomplished, the hero of the Franks proceeded on his mission of conquest and reconstruction. His war with the Saxons was protracted over a period of three-and thirty years. The resistance was resolute, determined, heroic ; but the perseverance of the stronger prevailed. The Saxons were completely subjugated. A colony of them was transplanted into the almost unpeopled regions of Flanders and Brabant ; many escaped into Scandinavia, and mingling with the North men, begat the bold and hardy race who afterwards directed their conquering galleys against the shores of western France. The remainder embraced Christianity, and their leader Witti kind acknowledged the supremacy of Charlemagne. Eight bishoprics were founded, and the country apportioned into suitable dioceses. 9. Contemporary with this great war was his conquest of Spain, which, from the Ebro to the Pyrenees, he rescued from the Saracens, and formed into the Spanish March, governed by a count of Barcelona. To protect the eastern frontier of his empire he undertook the conquest of the Sclavonians of Bohemia, and the Huns or Avars of Pannonia, organising each province under imperial officers, and guarding the one by garrisons drawn from the other. We have already indicated the general limits of his empire, which was bounded in Germany by the rivers Elbe and Saal, and the Bohemian mountains, and a line from thence crossing the Danube above Vienna, and stretching as far as the Gulf of Istria. In extending his territories so far northward, Monsieur Gaillard points out that he probably sought to erect a formidable barrier against those adventurous and savage tribes which, issuing from the fastnesses of Scandinavia, had shaken to its foundations the dominion of the C\u00e6sars. But his policy was an erroneous one. These tribes escaped from his ever-widening circle of conquest to their brethren on the shores of the Baltic, and seeking revenge and booty, joined the Norse Vikingir in their destructive inroads ; and their sons were those aggressive and resistless Normans who afterwards conquered Neustria, and overthrew the throne of the Carlovingians."], [49, "HIS CHARACTER. 21 10. Charlemagne died in 814, bequeathing his name and memory as a legacy to the admiration of posterity, which cannot fail to admire the vastness of his genius, while it does not con ceal its disgust at the vices of his character. It is useless to criticise the measure of greatness of a hero whose glory has become the tradition of so many ages. He made \" an epoch in the history of the world.\" Philosophers use his reign as a landmark by which to direct their inquiries \u2014 as a beacon in a wide and stormy sea, whose lustre irradiates the surrounding darkness. Nor did all that he accomplished pass away with him. His empire, informed no longer by his enlightened intel lect, and guided no longer by his energetic hand, fell to pieces, but the influence of his laws, of his institutions, of his cha racter, extended over many generations. His errors were equally permanent in their effects, and his encouragement of the pre tensions of the Romish hierachy was followed by consequences which assuredly his sagacity did not contemplate. 11. Hallam has justly remarked, that his leading charac teristic was a \" strong sympathy for intellectual excellence.\" He loved letters, and men of letters ; he collected libraries and founded schools ; he sought to extirpate barbarism, and sub stitute in its place a Christian civilisation. His vices were, in a great measure, those of his age. He was temperate, and, except on great occasions, frugal ; but his love of women was shown by his nine marriages,- \u2014 or rather concubinages, for he divorced his wives without even the most trivial cause. He was lavish of human life, which, indeed, in the year of grace 800, men had not learned to value, and beheaded in one day 4,000 Saxons. A devout son of the Church, he was intolerant as the most furious bigot, menacing with death those who rejected baptism, or even ate flesh during Lent.* A devout son of the Church, he nevertheless asserted his own views of religious topics with the authority of a conqueror, and appears to have leaned to an Erastianism which was certainly heterodox. 12. \" The appellation of great!' says Gibbon, \" has been often bestowed and sometimes deserved, but Charlemagne is the only prince in whose favour the title has been indissolubly blended * The penalty of death was also threatened for relapsing to idolatry, murdering a priest or bishop, or offering human sacrifices ; but no crime was too heinous not to be expiated by baptism or penance. \u2014 See full details in Gaillard's Histoire de Charlemagne."], [50, "22 CORONATION OF CHARLEMAGNE. with the name. That name, with the addition of saint, is in serted in the Roman calendar ; and the saint, by a rare felicity, is crowned with the praises of the historians and philosophers of an enlightened age. His real merit is doubtless enhanced by the barbarism of the nation, and the times from which he emerged ; but the apparent magnitude of an object is likewise enlarged by an unequal comparison ; and the ruins of Palmyra derive a casual splendour from the nakedness of the surrounding desert. Without injustice to his fame, I may discern some blemishes in the sanctity and greatness of the restorer of the Western Empire. Of his mortal virtues, chastity is not the most conspicuous, but the public happiness could not be materially injured by his nine wives or concubines, the various indulgence of meaner or more transient amours, the multitude of his bas tards whom he bestowed on the Church, and the long celibacy and licentious manners of his daughters, whom the father was suspected of loving with too fond a passion. I shall be scarcely permitted to accuse the ambition of a conqueror ; but in a day of equal retribution, the sons of his brother Carloman, the Merovingian princes of Aquitaine, and the 4,500 Saxons who were beheaded on the same spot, would have something to allege against the justice and humanity of Charlemagne. His treatment of the vanquished Saxons was an abuse of the right of conquest; his laws were not less sanguinary than his arms, and in the discussion of his motives whatever is substracted from bigotry must be imputed to temper. The sedentary reader is amazed by his incessant activity of mind and body ; and his subjects and enemies were not less astonished at his sudden presence, at the moment when they believed him at the most distant extremity of the empire. Neither peace nor war, nor summer nor winter, were a season of repose ; and our fancy cannot easily reconcile the annals of his reign with the geo graphy of his expeditions. But this activity was a national rather than a personal virtue : the vagrant life of a Frank was spent in the chase, in pilgrimage, in military adventures ; and the journeys of Charlemagne were distinguished only by a more numerous train and a more important purpose. His mili tary renown must be tried by the scrutiny of his troops, his enemies, and his actions. Alexander conquered with the arms of Philip, but the two heroes who preceded Charlemagne be-"], [51, "GIBBON'S ANALYSIS OF HIS CHARACTER. 23 queathed him their name, their examples, and the companions of their victories. At the head of his veteran and superior armies, he oppressed the savage or degenerate nations,* who were incapable of confederating for their common safety ; nor did he ever encounter an equal antagonist in numbers, in disci pline, or in arms. The science of war has been lost and revived with the arts of peace ; but his campaigns are not illustrated by any siege or battle of singular difficulty and success ; and he might behold, with envy, the Saracen trophies of his grand father. After his Spanish expedition, his rear-guard was defeated in the Pyrenean mountains ; and the soldiers, whose situation was irretrievable, and whose valour was useless, might accuse, with their last breath, the want of skill or caution of their general. I touch with reverence the laws of Charlemagne, so highly applauded by a respectable judge. They compose not a system, but a series of occasional and minute edicts for the correction of abuses, the reformation of manners, the economy of his farms, the care of his poultry, and even the sale of his eggs. He wished to improve the laws and the character of the Franks ; and his attempts, however feeble and imperfect, are deserving of praise. The inveterate evils of the times were suspended or mollified by his government, but in his institutions I can seldom discover the general views and the immortal spirit of a legislator who survives himself for the benefit of posterity. The union and stability of his empire depended on the life of a single man. He imitated the dangerous practice of dividing his kingdoms among his sons; j\" and, after his numerous diets, the whole constitution was left to fluctuate between the disorders of anarchy and despotism. His esteem for the piety and know ledge of the clergy tempted him to entrust that aspiring order with temporal dominion and civil jurisdiction ; and his son Louis, when he was stripped and degraded by the bishops, might accuse, in some measure, the imprudence of his father. His laws enforced the imposition of tithes, because the demons had proclaimed in the air that the default of payment had been * Gibbon forgets that these savage or degenerate tribes opposed a sturdy re sistance to the Roman veterans, and that it is improbable that the Franks were under the restraint of any rigid discipline. t On this point Hallam justly remarks that the custom of partition was too fully established even for such princes as Charles Martel and Charlemagne to venture to thwart public opinion by introducing primogeniture."], [52, "24 CORONATION OF CHARLEMAGNE. the cause of the last scarcity. The literary merits of Charle magne are attested by the foundation of schools, the introduc tion of arts, the works which were published in his name, and his familiar connection with the subjects and strangers whom he invited to his court to educate both the prince and people. His own studies were tardy, laborious, and imperfect. If he spoke Latin and understood Greek, he derived the rudi ments of knowledge from conversation, rather than from books; and, in his mature age, the emperor strove to acquire the prac tice of writing, which every peasant now learns in his infancy.* The grammar and logic, the music and astronomy of the times, were only cultivated as the handmaids of superstition ; but the curiosity of the human mind must ultimately lead to its improve ment, and the encouragement of learning reflects the purest and most pleasing lustre on the character of Charlemagne. The dignity of his person, the length of his reign, the prosperity of his arms, the vigour of his government, and the reverence of distant nations, distinguished him from the royal crowd ; and Europe dates a new era from his restoration of the Western Empire.\" 13. This elaborate view of the great emperor's character is distinguished by that illiberal scepticism and incapacity of appreciating the heroic which, unfortunately, deforms Gibbon's splendid historical composition. Not the less, it may justly be compared with the more favourable estimate formed by Hallam, and the student, from the two, may deduce an accurate and impartial judgment ; neither allowing his partiality to be influenced by the picturesque aspect of a great character and the glory of an imperial name, nor suffering himself to measure the heroes of the past by the standard of the present. Lappen berg, the Saxon historian, rightly places the emperor of the West below our own illustrious Alfred, and Sismondi ably points out the defective nature of his institutions and the errors of his government. \" The greatness acquired by arms,\" he exclaims, \" is deceitful, when it provides no beneficent institution as a point of repose ; and the reign of a great king remains barren, when he does not establish the liberty of his contemporaries.\" * This is both illogical and ungenerous. But there are many peasants who even now do not learn writing in their infancy, and assuredly in\" the ninth cen tury it was an art known only to the lettered recluse or ecclesiastic."], [53, "APRES LUI, LE DELUGE. 25 But Charlemagne's work did not all expire with the workman. Nothing fell with him, says Guizot, but the central government, which only a genius kindred to his own could have supported. Do not let us stint our admiration of the heroic. Charlemagne found all things a chaos, and educed order and method and a settled polity. Apres ltd, le deluge, because no man arose capable of wielding his sceptre, or wearing his crown. His greatest eulogy is therefore written, as Hallam remarks, \" in the dis graces of succeeding times, and the miseries of Europe. He stands alone, like a beacon upon a waste, or a rock in the broad ocean. His sceptre was the bow of Ulysses, which could not be drawn by any weaker hand. In the dark ages of European history the reign of Charlemagne affords a solitary resting-place between two long periods of turbulence and ignominy, deriving the advantages of contrast both from that of the preceding dynasty, and of a posterity for whom he had formed an empire which they were unworthy and unequal to maintain.\""], [54, "POSTSCRIPT I.

We are indebted for a life of Charlemagne to his secretary, Eginhardt, a native of Austrasia, or East France, whose wife is said (but on no reliable authority) to have been one Emma, or Imma, a daughter of the great emperor. Both husband and wife spent their later years in convents. Eginhardt became Abbot of Fontenelle, and, in 827, founded the Abbey of Seligen stadt.

EGINHARDT'S LIFE OF CHARLEMAGNE. 2. The Merovingian dynasty, from which the Franks were wont to select their sovereigns, is considered to have lasted until the time of Childeric,* who, by order of Stephen, the Pontiff of Rome, was deposed, his head shaven, and forced into a monas tery. But though the race may seem to have terminated in him, yet, for a long time before, it had possessed no vigour, nor aught of splendour except the empty name of king ; for all the * The Merovingian dynasty \u2014 which included Merovius, Childeric, Clovis (usually considered the founder of the French monarchy), Clotaire I., Clotaire IL, Dagobert I., Clovis IL, Dasobert IL, Childeric the Foolish \u2014 was overthrown by Charles Martel, who founded the Carlovingian dynasty. His son Pepin succeeded him, a.d. 752, and died a.d. 761."], [55, "WEAKNESS OF THE MEROVINGIAN KINGS. 27 resources and power of the realm were enjoyed by the prefects of the palace, who were called Mayors of the Household, and wielded the supreme sway. Nor was there left anything to the monarch, contented with the royal title only, but that with hair dishevelled, and drooping beard, he should sit on the ground, and present the likeness of a ruler ; should receive ambassadors, and, as if of his own volition, return to their harangues the replies he was taught or commanded ; when, except the sha dowy title of king, and a precarious life-income, which the pre fect of the royal court handed over to him, just as seemed good, he possessed nothing of his own but a small and inexpensive mansion, where he maintained house, and those attendants necessary to his wants, and exhibiting the obedience of an insignificant number. Whenever he went abroad he travelled in a two-wheeled chariot, which was drawn by yoked oxen, and driven by a hind in truly rustic manner, \u2014 thus he was wont to journey to the palace, thus to the public assembly of his subjects, held annually for the weal of the kingdom, and thus to return homeward ; but all things appertaining to the administration of affairs at home or abroad, the Mayor of the Palace disposed of. 3. This office, when Childeric was deposed, Pepin, father of Charles the Great, held as if by hereditary right. For his father, Charles [Martel], who had crushed the tyrants that claimed supremacy over the whole of France, and had so com pletely defeated the Saracens, then threatening to occupy Gaul, in two great battles \u2014 one in Aquitania, near the city of Poictiers,* the other near Narbonne, upon the river Aube \u2014 that he compelled them to retire into Spain, had splendidly discharged the duties of the high post'handed down to him by his father Pepin. And this honour was not often given by the people to others than those who excelled all their fellows in lustre of descent and opulence of resources. When Pepin, father of Charles the Great, having shared the dignity bequeathed to him and his brother Carloman by their grandfather and father with the utmost concord, had held it for some years, as if under a celebrated king, his brother Carloman, for what reason is uncertain, but probably because inflamed with a longing for meditative converse, abandoning the burden of temporal government, betook himself to Rome for ease, and * The great battle of Tours, fought in 732."], [56, "28 POSTSCRIPT I. there, having assumed the monastic robes, enjoyed his long coveted tranquillity for a few years, in a monastery raised upon the hill of Soracte, near the church of the blessed Silvester. But when many of the Frank nobles repaired to Rome in dis charge of their solemn vows, and were unwilling to pass unnoticed their former lord, he was compelled, by their continual interrup tions of the ease in which he so much delighted, to change his habitation. For he saw that the frequency of this concourse obstructed his design, and, abandoning Soracte, he withdrew into the province of the Samnites, to the monastery of the holy Benedict, situated on the hill of Casinum, and there what remained to him of temporal life he passed in religious con templation. 4. But Pepin \u2014 raised from the Mayoralty of the Palace to the throne by the authority of the Roman Pontiff, when, for fifteen years and more, he had governed France alone, the war in Aquitaine being finished, which he had undertaken against Guaifarius, Duke of Aquitaine, and waged for nine successive years \u2014 died at Paris of dropsy, having issue Charles and Carlo man, to whom fell the inheritance of the kingdom by the Divine will. The Franks, moreover, having held, according to custom, a general council, acknowledged them their kings, with this preliminary condition, that the entire kingdom should be justly divided, and that Charles should possess the portion formerly held by his father Pepin, and Carloman that over which his uncle Carloman had ruled. These terms were accepted by both, and each received the division of the kingdom set apart. for him. And the agreement prevailed, though with great difficulty, many on the side of Carloman threatening to sever the alliance, so that some even designed to levy war against them. But the event showed lhat there was more of suspicion than of peril in this, when, on the death of Carloman, his wife and sons, with some of the leading nobles, fled into Italy, and for no existing reasons, despising her husband's brother, placed herself and her children under the protection of Desiderius, King of the Lombards. And Carloman, after administering the affairs of the kingdom jointly for two years, died of disease [a.d. 771] ; and Charles, on his brother's death, was named king, with the consent of all the Franks. 5.

Of all the wars which he waged, he first undertook the Aquitanian, begun, but left unfinished by his father, because there appeared a possibility of its speedy termination, his brother being then alive, and invited to lend his aid ; and although Carloman disappointed him of the promised assistance, having followed up most strenuously the expedition he had essayed, he was unwilling to abandon an enterprise already begun, or to withdraw from a labour once undertaken, like this, which he was endeavouring to accomplish, he with a certain perseverance and toil brought it to a conclusion. For he compelled Hunoldus \u2014 who, after Guaifar's death, attempted to seize Aquitaine, and renew the war almost there crushed out \u2014 to abandon Aquitaine and retire to Gascony. And not permitting him to abide there, having crossed the river Garonne, he ordered, by his ambassadors, Lupus, Duke of Gascony, to give up the fugitive, and threatened war if his request were not instantly complied with. But Lupus, coming to a wiser conclusion, not only gave up Hunoldus, but also submitted himself and the province over which he ruled to his authority. 7. Affairs in Aquitaine being settled, and the campaign con cluded, at the instance and urgent prayer of Adrian, Bishop of Rome,* he undertook a war against the Lombards [a.d. 774]. This, indeed, had previously been essayed by his father, at the entreaty of Pope Stephen, with considerable difficulty, because some of the chief nobles of the Franks with whom he was accustomed to consult had so opposed his will, that they openly declared they would desert the king and return home ; but when undertaken, nevertheless, it was at that time against King Astolfus rapidly terminated. But although it seemed that to himself and his father there befell a similar enterprise, and for a like cause, yet it appeared that it was not to be fought out * Pope Adrian I."], [58, "30 POSTSCRIPT T. with equal labour, or completed in a similar manner. Pepin, indeed, after a few days' siege of Ticenum, constrained King Astolfus to give hostages, and restore to the Romans the forts and towns he had taken from them, and swear solemnly that he would not attempt to regain them ; but Charles did not with draw from the war he had begun until he had reduced to sub jection Desiderius, whom he had wearied with a long blockade;* compelled his son Adalgisus, on whom the hopes of all seemed bent, to depart not only from his kingdom, but even out of Italy ; restored all things taken from the Romans ; overthrown Ruodgansus, prince of Foroiulianum, when attempting new designs ; subdued the whole of Italy to his dominion, and placed over it as king his son Pepin. How perilous to him proved the passage of the Alps, and with what labour the Franks subdued the pathless defiles, rough rocks, and heaven threatening peaks of the mountains, I would describe in this place, were it not that I have proposed to myself, in my present task, to record the manner of life of the king rather than his achievements in war. But the result of this war was \u2014 Italy sub dued, the king, Desiderius, transported into perpetual exile, his son Adalgisus driven from Italy, and the lands seized by the Lombard princes restored to Adrian, the ruler of the Roman Church. 8. Upon the conclusion of this war, hostilities were renewed against the Saxons, which seemed to have been intermitted ; than which no more protracted contest, none more ferocious. and none more laborious to the Franks, was ever undertaken : for the Saxons, like almost all the tribes inhabiting Germany, were cruel by nature, given to the worship of demons, and hostile to our religion, nor did they think it dishonourable either to desecrate or transgress laws, human and divine. And there existed causes which were able at all times to disturb peace, inasmuch as our boundaries and theirs lay almost everywhere contiguous in the open plain, except at a few points where dense forests or the projecting promontories of the mountains determined the fixed limits of the territories of both ; and * Charlemagne defeated Desiderius at Pavia, and took him prisoner. He then assumed the crown of Lombardy, and confirmed Pepin's donation of the Exar chate of Ravenna and the Pentapolis to the Pope, who, in his turn, acknowledged Charles as Patrician of Rome and Suzerain of Italy, with the right of confirming the election of the popes."], [59, "31 WAR WITH THE SAXONS. slaughter, and fire, and rapine, alternately invaded us, which so harassed the Franks that they now judged it fitting to under take war against them openly, and not to retaliate in their own manner. War was, therefore, commenced, and on both sides prosecuted with a mighty hatred, but with greater loss to the Saxons than the Franks, for three-and-thirty continuous years. It might, indeed, have been earlier concluded, if the treachery of the Saxons would have permitted. It is hard to tell how often their kings, subjugated and suppliant, promised they A7ould observe the prescribed conditions, yielded the hostages demanded without delay, received the ambassadors sent to them, and oftentimes were so tamed and quelled, that they even promised to abandon demon-worship, and submit to the Christian religion ; but just as they were frequently ready to undertake these stipulations, so also they were often eager to break through them ; and it is very hazardous to say to which course they were the more inclined, inasmuch as from the com mencement of the war scarcely a year passed in which there did not occur some infraction of their treaties. But the mag nanimity of the king, and the perpetual constancy of his mind in adversity as well as in prosperity, by no mutability of theirs could be affected, nor turned aside from aught which he had undertaken; for he never suffered them to perpetrate any such treachery with impunity, but either leading his army in person, or despatching it under his lieutenants, he would avenge the perfidy, and exact from them a fitting retribution, until all that had been wont to resist him being scattered abroad and reduced under his sway, he transported ten thousand of them who dwelt on the river Elbe, with their wives and children, and distributed them in small colonies through Gaul and Germany. And with this condition, proposed by the king and accepted by them, the war waged for so many years seems to have been concluded \u2014 that their worship of fiends and traditional religious rites being flung aside, they should receive the sacraments of the Christian faith, and, amalgamated with the Franks, should form with them one people. 9. In this war, although it was protracted for a long period, the king himself did not oftener meet the enemy in battle than twice \u2014 once near the mountain Osnengi, in the district of Theol mellus, and again near the river Hasa [Weser], after an interval"], [60, "32 POSTSCRIPT I. of a month and a few days. In these two battles the enemy were so scattered and overthrown, that they never again dared to attack the king, nor to offer any resistance to his attack, unless in some fortified position. And though in this contest many of the nobility of the Franks as well as of the Saxons \u2014 men of the most illustrious dignity \u2014 perished, yet finally, when it was brought to an end in its thirty -third year [a.d. 772 \u2014 804], con sidering that, in the meanwhile, so many and such great wars against the Franks had sprung up in different parts of the earth, which the ability of the king contrived to conduct; to spectators it might rightly appear a matter of doubt, whether his patience in toil or his good fortune is the more deserving of admiration. For in the two years before the Italian war arose, and when without pause he carried on hostilities, not one of those contests was abandoned which in other places was raging, nor in any part ceased an equally laborious strife ; for the king, who of all the rulers of his age was both the most prudent and the most magnanimous, withdrew from no enterprise which he had taken up or pursued, on account of its toil, nor dreaded it on account of its danger, but, inured to bear and submit to everything according to its nature, was accustomed neither to give wyay in adversity, nor to listen to the blandishments of deceitful Fortune in prosperity. 10. Thus, when in constant and assiduous war he strove with the Saxons, garrisons being placed at suitable points on the boundaries, he invaded Spain with the most formidable battle he could get together, and having forced the passes of the Pyrenees, all the towns and forts before which he appeared capitulated, and he returned with his army in safety, except that in one of the Pyrenean defiles* be experienced for awhile, on his homeward route, the treachery of the Gascons. For while with extended column, as the difficulties of the ground permitted, the army moved onward, the Gascons, lying in ambush on the mountain-heights \u2014 for the spot, on account of the density of its woods, of which there is an abundance, is very apt for ambus cades \u2014 cast themselves into the valley beneath, on the extreme * The king's rearguard was attacked by the Gascons and Saracens at Ronees valles, and several of the Frank nobles s'lain ; among them the famous Roland, Warden of the Marches of Brittany (Pr\u0153fcctus Britannici Leminis), the hero of many a song and legend."], [61, "SUBMISSION OF THE BENEVENTINES. 33 rear of the baggage-train, and its escort, and joining battle with them, slew all, even to the last man, and seizing their plunder, dispersed with the greatest celerity, under the shelter of the night, into various parts. In this achievement the Gascons were greatly assisted by the lightness of their arms, and the peculiar nature of the ground ; while, on the other hand, their heavy armour, and the difficulty of the position, rendered the Franks in all things unequal to the Gascons. In this battle Eggihard, the king's steward, Anselm, the chamberlain, and Roland, Warden of the Marches of Brittany, with many others, were slain. Nor to this day can the deed be avenged, because the enemy by whom it was perpetrated so scattered himself abroad that no trace remained to indicate where he might be sought. 11. He also subdued the Bretons, who, dwelling upon the shores of ocean in the extreme west of Gaul, did not obey his edicts ; and an expedition being sent against them they were compelled to give hostages, and to undertake to carry out the conditions imposed upon them. He himself afterwards entering Italy with his army, and marching by way of Rome, approached Capua, the city of Campania, and having entrenched himself, threatened the Beneventines with war unless they surrendered. This, Aragisus, their prince, warded off. Sending his two sons, Runold and Grimold, to the king, with a large sum of money, he asked him to accept them as his hostages, and promised that he and his people would grant all that was demanded, so that he was not compelled to appear in the royal presence. The king, taking into consideration rather the valour of the Beneventines than the will of his own mind, received the hostages offered to him, and for a great reward granted that the prince should not be constrained to appear before him; and having retained the younger of the sons for the sake of hostageship (obsidatus), he sent back the elder to his father; and ambassadors being despatched to require and receive the oaths of fidelity from the Beneventines, returned to Rome. Having spent some days there, in worship of its holy places, he then retired into Gaul. 12. Thereupon arose the Bavarian war, suddenly, and sud denly it was brought to a close. The pride and folly of the prince Tassilones excited it; who, at the instigation of his wife\u2014 who was a daughter of King Desiderius, and thought to avenge D"], [62, "34 POSTSCRIPT I. her father's exile by the agency of her husband \u2014having allied himself with the Huns, the eastern neighbours of the Bavarians, not only disputed the king's commands, but declared war against him. This arrogance, because it seemed too bold, the great spirit of the king could not endure, and, therefore, gathering in his troops on every side to invade Bavaria, he appeared with a mighty army on the river Lech. That river divides the Bavarians from the Alemanns. Having constructed forts upon its banks, before he entered Bavaria, he resolved to ascertain the mind of its prince through his ambassadors. And he, neither steadfast in aught useful to himself or his people, humbled him self before the king, and gave the hostages demanded, among whom was his son Theodones [Deodatus]; moreover, confirming his fidelity by an oath, that he would listen to no one persuading him into defection from the king's authority. And so a speedy limit was put to a war which had promised to assume large pro portions. And Tassilones shortly afterwards being summoned to the king's court, was not permitted to return ; nor was the province which he had held entrusted to another duke, but to counts to administer it. 13. These disturbances being thus composed, war was waged against the Sclavonians \u2014 who are called by us the Wilzi, but rightly, in their own tongue, Welatabi \u2014 in which the Saxons, as auxiliaries, among other tribes who followed the orders of the king, although with a feigned and less devoted obedience, were engaged. The cause of the war was, that with constant forays they had harassed the Abodrites, who had formerly been allied with the Franks, nor would be restrained by the king's orders. A certain gulf stretches from the western ocean towards the east, of unknown length indeed, but nowhere exceeding a hundred miles in breadth, while in many places it is much narrower. Many tribes inhabit its shores. The Danes and the Suevi, whom we call Normans, occupy its northern coast and all its islands. The southern shore the Sclavonians and Aestyi inhabit, and various other peoples ; among whom the chief are those with whom the king now declared war, the Welatabi. These in one campaign only, which he conducted in person, he so over threw and shattered, that they willingly promised to obey the commands of no other than him. 14. The most famous of all the wars waged by the kin\"-,"], [63, "CONQUEST OF THE HUNS. 35 except the Saxon, succeeded this expedition against the Wela tabi, namely, that which he undertook against the Avars and Huns. He carried it on with greater spirit, and with a more imposing force. Nevertheless he made but one expedition in person into Pannonia, the province which those tribes inhabited; of the remaining campaigns he entrusted the direction to his son Pepin and the prefects of the provinces, and being vigorously prosecuted by them, the war was finished in its eighth year. How many battles were fought during it, how great was the outpouring of blood, let the desolation of Pannonia witness ! The district wherein was seated the capital of the Chagan was so utterly a desert, that in its length and breadth appeared not a vestige of a human habitation. All the nobles of the Huns, all their glory, perished in this struggle ! All their wealth, and the treasures for along period accumulated, were carried away; nor is there recorded any war as having broken out against the Franks by which they were more enriched or their resources more increased ; and that since that time there has appeared to be but few poor men: so much gold and silver was found in the royal treasury, such costly spoils captured in battle, that it may fitly be believed that the Franks justly despoiled the Huns of what the Huns previously had unjustly despoiled other nations. Two only of the leaders of the Franks fell in this war \u2014 \u00c6ricus, Duke of Foroiulanum, slain in an ambush near the maritime city of Tharsatica, in Livornia ; and Gerold, the Warden of Bavaria, who, when he had drawn out his troops in a skirmish with the Huns, was killed, it is uncertain by whom, with two attendants who accompanied him, as he rode up and down and encouraged his men. Otherwise, the Franks suffered little in this enterprise, which terminated very prosperously, although from its dimensions greatly protracted. 15. After this, too, the Saxon war was brought to a close, suitable to its duration. The Bohemian and Linonian, also, which afterwards broke out, could not long be protracted, both being terminated quickly under the guidance of Charles the younger. The last was that essayed against those Northmen who are called Danes. At first acting as pirates, they afterwards devastated the coast of Germany and Gaul with a larger fleet. Their king, Godefrid, was so puffed up with empty hope, that he promised himself the dominion over all Germany. He also D 2"], [64, "36 POSTSCRIPT I. looked upon Frisia and Saxony as his own provinces ; and levied tribute from the Abodrites, his neighbours, whom he had reduced into subjection. He also boasted that he would shortly appear with an immense army ; nor must all credence be denied to his sayings, since he would doubtlessly have attempted some new enterprise if he had not been prevented by an un foreseen death. For he was slain by his own attendant, and the end of his life and of the war unexpectedly hastened. 16. These are the wars which for seven and forty years (for he reigned that number of years), this most powerful king carried on in various parts of the world, with the highest prudence and good fortune. By these means he so increased the kingdom of the Franks, which he had received from his father, that he almost doubled it in extent. For while it previously included only that part of Gaul which lies between the Rhine and the Loire, the ocean and the Mediterranean Sea; and that part of Germany which is inhabited by theWestern Franks, lying between Saxony and the Danube, the Rhine and the river Saale, which divides the Thuringians and Sorabi ; and besides these, the Alemanni and Bavarians acknowledged the power of the French kingdom ; he himself through his famous wars subdued, and even rendered tributary, Aquitaine and Gascony, and the entire range of the Pyrenees as far as the river Ebro, which rises among the Navarrese, and traversing the most fertile fields of Spain, mingles with the Mediterranean Sea under the walls of Dertosa ; then the whole of Italy, which extends more than one thousand miles in length, from Augusta Pr\u00e6toria even to Lower Calabria, where it touches the borders of the Greeks and Beneventines ; then Saxony, which indeed is no inconsiderable part of Ger many, and is thought to be double the breadth while it is of the same length as that part inhabited by the Franks ; after wards both Pannonia and Dacia, which is placed on the other bank of the Danube ; Istria also, and Liburnia, and Dalmatia, except those maritime states which he permitted the Emperor of Constantinople to possess, on account of his friendship and alliance with him ; then all the wild and barba rous tribes which inhabit Germany, between the rivers Rhine and Vistula, the ocean and the Danube, and who speak nearly the 6ame tongue, but differ greatly in manners and character. Amongst whom the principal are the Welatabi, Sorabi, Abo-"], [65, "37 AMBASSADORS FROM THE EAST. driti, Boemanni, and these he subdued in battle ; of the others, of whom the number is much greater, he received their submission. 17. He increased also the glory of his empire by the alliances he contracted with certain kings and nations. For he so at tached to himself in friendship Alfonzo, the King of Asturia and Gallicia, that he, when he would send to him ambassadors or epistles, ordered himself to be spoken of in the king's presence only as his servant (quam proprium suum). He had also so subdued the affections of the kings of the Scots by his munificence, that they would never call him otherwise, than their lord, and themselves his vassals and slaves. Epistles sent from them to the king are extant, in which this feeling towards him is plainly shown. With Aaron, King of the Persians \u2014 who, with the exception of India, ruled almost the entire East \u2014 he maintained so warm a friendship, that he preferred the Emperor's favour to the alliance of all the kings and princes in the whole world, and judged that he alone was worthy of honour and munificence ; and, therefore, when his ambassadors, whom he had sent with offerings to the most holy Sepulchre of our Lord and Saviour, and the place of his resurrection, came to him and explained their sovereign's will, the Persian monarch not only granted all that they demanded, but even gave up to him that sacred and blessed spot ; and, sending with the returning ambassadors his own servants, he despatched vast gifts to the king, besides garments and perfumes and the other riches of the East, and a few years before he sent to him at his request the only elephant he then possessed. Also the Constantino politan emperors, Nicephorus, Michael, aud Leo, voluntarily soliciting his friendship and alliance, sent several ambassadors to him ; and, although on account of his assumption of the imperial title he was suspected by them of meditating a design against their empire, he maintained a firm alliance with them, that no occasion of scandal should exist upon their part. For the power of the Franks was always regarded suspiciously by the Romans and Greeks, whence arises the Greek proverb \u2014 tov (ppavKov piXov \u00a3/\u00a3<C\u00bb ytrova ou/c \u00a3/\u00a3<? [Have a Frank for a friend, but not for a neighbour]. 18. He who was thus employed in extending his dominion and subduing the outlying peoples, and was constantly engaged in various occupations of this character, yet commenced, in"], [66, "38 POSTSCRIPT I. different places, numerous works for the welfare and improve ment of his kingdom, which he also completed. Among these the principal, not undeservedly, seem to be the basilica of the Virgin, erected with wonderful labour at Aix-la-Chapelle, and the bridge at Mogontiacus on the Rhine, 500 paces broad, for such is the width of the river. This bridge was destroyed by fire in the year before his death, and was not rebuilt on account of his sudden decease, although he had it in contemplation to erect a bridge of stone instead of one of wood. He also com menced the construction of splendid palaces \u2014 one not far from the city of Mayence, near the town now called Engilenheim, and another at Noviomagus, on the river Waal, which flows round the island of Batavia on the southern side. Yet chiefly he commanded that the sacred buildings, wherever throughout his empire he found them shaken by old age, should be restored by the pontiffs and priests to whom their care belonged, taking heed through his lieutenants that his commands should be obeyed. He built also a fleet against the Northmen's war, ships being constructed for this purpose in the neighbourhood of the rivers which from Gaul and Germany flow into the Northern Ocean ; and because the Normans devastated with constant incursions the Gallic and German shore, all the harbours and mouths of rivers where ships could enter, gar risons and watches being stationed, he fortified with such strength that no enemy could have escaped. He did the same in the south, on the coast of the provinces of Narbonne and Sep timania, and on the entire shore of Italy as far as Rome, against the piracies of the Moors ; and by these means, neither was Italy harassed by the Moors, nor were Gaul and Germany attacked by the Northmen in his time, except that Centumcell\u00e6, a city of Etruria, was through treachery captured and plundered by the Moors, and in Frisia some islands near the German coast were ravaged by the Northmen. 19. Such he appears to have been with regard to the exten sion, and at the same time protection and adornment, of his kingdom. His mental powers and remarkable steadfastness, under every circumstance, favourable or adverse, deserve our admiration. I shall now begin to speak of those other matters which relate to his domestic and internal life. When after the death of his father he shared the kingdom"], [67, "Charlemagne's children. 39 with his brother, he bore his envy and animosity with such patience, that it seemed wonderful to all that nothing could provoke him to anger. Afterwards, at the instigation of his mother, he took to wife the daughter of Desiderius, King of the Lombards, but, for what reason is uncertain, divorced her in a twelvemonth, and married Hildegard, of the Sclavonian race, a woman of admirable nobleness, by whom he had three sons, namely, Charles, Pepin, and Ludovic, and as many daughters, Rothude, Bertha, and Gisele. He had three other daughters, Theodredane, Hiltrude, and Ruodhaide \u2014 two by his wife Fastrada, who was of the nation of the western Franks, that is, the Germans, and one by a concubine whose name I cannot recollect. On the death of Fastrada, he married Lindgarda, of the Alemanni, by whom he had no children. After her death he had three concubines, Gersuinda, a Saxon, by whom he had a daughter named Adaltrude ; Regina, who bore Drogon and Hugues ; and Adalindes, of whom he begat Thierry. His mother, Berthrada, lived with him in her old age in great honour ; for he worshipped her with the greatest reverence, so that no disagreement ever prevailed between them, except upon the divorce of the daughter of Desiderius, whom he had married at her persuasion. She died after the death of Hildegard, when she had seen three grandsons and as many grand-daughters in her son's home, and he caused her to be interred with much pomp in the tomb at St. Dionysius, where his father was buried. He had but one sister, named Gisele, devoted from her earliest years to a religious life, whom he revered, like his mother, with the greatest piety ; who also, a few years before his own decease, died in the monastery where she had been brought up. 20. He thought that his children should so be trained that both his sons and daughters should first be instructed in liberal studies, to which he himself paid great attention. Then his sons, as soon as their age permitted, he caused to be taught to ride in the Frank manner, to practise arms and the chase, and his daughters he accustomed to weaving and spinning, and to every honourable employment, lest they should grow sluggish through over ease. Of all these, he lost two sons only and one daughter before he died \u2014 Charles, who was the elder, and Pepin, whom he had appointed King of Italy, and Rothude, the eldest of his daughters, betrothed to Constantine, Emperor of"], [68, "40 POSTSCRIPT I. the Greeks. Pepin left surviving issue one son, Bernhard, and five daughters, Adalhaides, Atula, Guntrade, Berthaides, and Theoderada. To these the king gave a striking proof of his justice, when, his son being dead, he appointed his grandson to succeed his father, and his grand-daughters to be educated with his own daughters. He bore the deaths of his children with exceeding patience, such was the magnanimity which distin guished him, though constrained to tears by the affection for which he was no less remarkable. When he received the tidings of the death of Adrian, the Roman pontiff, whom he held chief among his friends, he wept as bitterly as if he had lost his son or best-loved brother. For he was so excellently tempered in his friendships, that he could easily contract and very steadfastly retain them, and reverently loved all whom he admitted into this affinity with himself. He devoted himself so much to the nurture of his sons and daughters, that he never, when at home, dined without them ; never went a journey save in their company; his sons rode with him, his daughters closely followed him, escorted by a number of attendants set apart for this duty. And though they were very handsome, and fondly loved by him, yet, won derful to tell, he was unwilling to marry either of them to any of his own nobles or foreigners ; but to the day of his death retained them at home, declaring that he could not spare them from his household. And thus, although fortunate in other respects, he experienced in this matter the malignity of adverse fortune, which nevertheless he so disguised, as if concerning them no suspicion of want of chastity had ever arisen, or the scandal had been refuted.* 21. He had a son, named Pepin, borne to him by a concu bine [Himiltrude], of whom among others I have deferred making mention ; he was handsome in countenance, but a hunchback. When his father, in his war against the Huns, wintered in Bavaria, he pretended sickness, and conspired against him with some of the Frank nobles, who had allured him with a deceitful promise of the kingdom. The king permitted him, when his treachery was detected and the conspirators pun ished, to retire as he wished, with monastic vows, into the convent of Prumia, for a religious life. But previously another formidable * Historians assert that Rothude was the mother of Ludovic, Abbot of St Dionysius, and that Bertha bore two sons to Angilbert."], [69, "A PORTRAIT OF CHARLEMAGNE. 41 conspiracy was planned against him in Germany, some of whose authors were deprived of sight, some uninjured in limb, but all sent into banishment ; nor were any slain but three, who when they defended themselves from arrest with drawn swords, and killed some of their assailants, were put to death, since in no other way could they be subdued. The cause and origin of these conspiracies is believed to have been the cruelty of Queen Fastrada, and in both their object was the king; because, consenting to the savageness of the que'en, he seemed to have been monstrously deprived of the usual mildness and benignity of his nature. But for the remainder of his life he so enjoyed, both at home and abroad, the highest love and favour of all, that there was never objected to him the slightest suspicion of unjust cruelty. 22. He loved strangers, and took great pains to entertain them, so that very often their numerousness, not only in the palace but in the kingdom, appeared decidedly burdensome. But, through the greatness of his mind, he was very slightly affected by an obligation of this character, especially since he could compensate himself for these great inconveniences by the reputation of liberality and the reward of a splendid renown. 23. He was of a stout and stalwart frame, tall of stature, but not exceeding the just proportion, for he appears to have measured seven of his own feet in height ; his head round at the top, his eyes very large and brilliant, his nose a little beyond the usual size, fair of hair, and of a joyous and lively counte nance. The majesty and stateliness of his figure appeared whether he was standing or sitting, although his neck was thick and short, and his stomach somewhat protuberant; but the exact proportion of the rest of his limbs concealed this. With a firm step and manly character of body, with a voice clear, indeed, but which little harmonised with his physical appearance, his health was excellent, except that for the four years preceding his death, he was constantly afflicted with fever, and at the last could only limp on one foot. And then, oi a truth, he acted more upon his own judgment than the advice of his physicians, whom he almost hated, because they persuaded him to discard from his food the roast meat, to which he was accustomed, and keep to boiled. He engaged constantly in riding and the chase, which in him was a national taste, for there is scarcely a nation"], [70, "42 POSTSCRIPT I. on earth which in this art can equal the Franks. He delighted also in the vapours of natural hot baths, exercising his body by frequent swimming, in which he was so skilled that no one could justly be called his superior. On this account he built a palace at Aix-la-Chapelle, and constantly resided there for the last years of his life, even to his death. And he invited to the bath, not only his sons, but his councillors and friends, and sometimes even the crowd of his attendants and bodyguard, so that often times a hundred men or more would be bathing with him at the same time. 24. He affected the national, that is the Frankish, costume. Next to his skin he wore a linen shirt and drawers ; then a tunic, which was surrounded with a silken border, and leggings ; small bandages wrapped his shins, and his feet were cased in shoes. His chest and shoulders were protected in the winter by a mantle of ermine ; in summer by a blue cloak ; and he always carried his sword, whose hilt and belt were either of gold or silver. Sometimes he used a jewelled sword, but only at festivals of importance, or the reception of foreign ambassadors. He eschewed the costume of strangers, however handsome, and never suffered himself to wear it, except once, at Rome, on a visit to Adrian the pontiff, and again on a visit to his suc cessor, Leo, when he was clothed with a long tunic and vest, and half-boots, made in the Roman manner. At high cere monies he appeared with a vest, gold woven, gemmed shoes, a gold buckle fastening his cloak, and a diadem on his head, of gold adorned with jewels ; but on other days his dress differed but little from that worn by the commonalty. 25. He was temperate in eating and drinking, but especially so in drinking, since he abominated drunkenness in any man as well as in himself or his friends. In eating he was not so abstemious, for he would often complain that fasting was injurious to his health. He caroused very rarely, and then only on high festivals, and with a great number of guests. The dinner every day was laid with four dishes only, besides the roast meat, which the hunters brought in spring, and which the king eat with more pleasure than any other food. While. dining he listened to a piece of music, or a reader. Histories were read to him, and the deeds of the ancients ; and he delighted in the books of St. Augustine, especially in those which are entitled"], [71, "43 HIS ELOQUENCE AND LEARNING. \" De Civitate Deorum.\" Of wine and all liquors he drank so sparingly, that during dinner he would not drink oftener than thrice. In summer, after his mid-day meal, he would take a few apples, and a draught of wine, and having taken off his shoes and garments, as he was wont to do at night, he would sleep for two or three hours. He slept so ill at night that he would interrupt his slumbers by not only waking, but even get ting up four or five times. When he had dressed, or put on his shoes, he not only admitted his friends, but even, if the warden of the palace said there was some dispute which could not be concluded without his order, bade him introduce the litigants, and would sit as if in the judgment seat, and having heard the case, pronounce his sentence ; and he would not only do this, but at the same time arrange for the day whatever there was of duty to be done, or charge to be given to any of his ministers. 26. His eloquence was copious and exuberant, and he could very lucidly explain whatever he wished to say. Nor was he contented only with his native tongue ; he gave much attention to the study of foreign languages. Among these he knew Latin so thoroughly, that he was accustomed to pray in it equally with his native language ; but Greek he could better understand than speak. Indeed he was so eloquent, that he appeared qualified to be a tutor. He most studiously cultivated the liberal arts, and greatly reverencing their professors, loaded them with great honours. In studying grammar, he attended Peter of Pisa, an old man, a deacon ; in other branches, Albinus, surnamed Alcuin, also a deacon, of Britain, a man of Saxon descent, and of universal learning, with whom he bestowed much time on the study of rhetoric, dialectics, and, above all, of astronomy. He learned the art of calculation, and with sagacious intention investigated very closely the courses of the stars. He practised writing, and was accustomed to place his tablets and memoran dums in bed under his pillow, that when he had any leisure he might use his hand to shaping letters ; but this labour, unsea sonable and begun too late, had but small success. 27. He practised very reverently, and with the utmost devotion, the Christian religion, in which he had been bred from infancy, and for this reason erected at Aix-la-Chapelle a church of exceeding beauty, which he adorned with gold and silver, and windows, and with railings and gates of solid bras3. Aud"], [72, "44 POSTSCRIPT I. as he could procure columns of marble for this building from no other locality, he caused them to be brought from Rome and Ravenna. Both at morning and evening, and also in the night-hours, and at the time of offering, while his health per mitted, he constantly attended church, and took great care that all things done therein should be done with the greatest possible decency, constantly warning the sacristans that they should suffer nothing improper or filthy either to be introduced or to remain therein. He procured an abundance of sacred vessels of gold and silver, and of sacerdotal vestments, that not even in the celebration of the sacrifices by the janitors, who are the lowest ecclesiastical order, should they be compelled to wear their daily garb. He corrected with the utmost diligence the method of reading and chanting, for he was skilled in both, although he never read in public, nor sang, except with humility and with the congregation. 28. Very eager to nourish the poor and give liberally \u2014 a virtue which the Greeks call elemosynam [almsgiving] \u2014 he not only in his own country and kingdom practised it, but beyond the seas, in Syria, and Egypt, and Africa, at Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Carthage, wherever he discovered that Chris tians lived in poverty, pitying their need, he would forward gifts of money ; desiring greatly, for this reason, the friendship of foreign princes, that some relief and assistance be procured for Christians living under their dominion. Above all other sacred places and shrines at Rome he esteemed the church of the blessed Apostle Peter, on which he lavished such gifts of money that he loaded it with gold, and silver, and jewels. Many and innumerable gifts were sent to the pontiffs, and in the whole time of his dominion he looked upon nothing as better worthy notice than that the city of Rome should by his labour and his pains enjoy its old authority, and the church of St. Peter be not only guarded and defended, but with its resources enriched and adorned beyond all other churches. But though he esteemed it so much, yet during the forty-seven years of his reign [768 \u2014 814], he only visited it four times to discharge his vows and pay his devotions. 2'J. These alone were not the causes of his last visit ; but because the Romans compelled Pope Leo, afflicted with many injuries \u2014 his eyes plucked out and his tongue amputated \u2014 to"], [73, "HIS CIVIL ACHIEVEMENTS. 45 implore the help of the king. On this account coming to Rome, he spent there the whole of the winter, that he might restore the condition of the Church, which was sorely shaken. It was at this time he received the title of Emperor and Augustus, to which at first he was so averse, that he declared that, although it was a principal feast, he would not have entered the church on that day if he had anticipated the pontiff's design. But the envy caused by his acceptance of the title \u2014 the emperors of the East being greatly indignant \u2014 he endured with great patience, and subdued their contumaciousness by his magnanimity, in which he immeasurably excelled them, despatching to them frequent embassies, and calling them \" brothers \" in his epistles. 30. After receiving the imperial dignity, he discerned that there were many defects in the laws of his people ; for the Franks have two laws,* in many places widely different. He resolved to add what was wanting, and to harmonise what was discrepaut ; but in this respect he accomplished nothing else than the addition of a few chapters,]\" and those imperfect, to the general body of the statutes. But the unwritten laws of all the nations which owned his sway he caused to be preserved in writing. He also put in writing and committed to memory the ancient ballads of Germany which celebrated the wars and achievements of the old kings. He began a grammar of his native language. He named the months in words selected from his own tongue, when previously they had been named by the Franks in a mixture of Latin and barbarian. And, further, he distinguished the twelve winds by proper appellations, while previously scarcely four of them had been so specified. And, of the months, he called' \u2014 January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December, Wintarmanoth. Hornung. Lentzinmanoth. Astarmanoth.

At the close of his life, when overwhelmed by disease and old age, he called to his side Ludovic his son, King of Aquitaine, who alone of the sons of Hildegard survived, and having assembled in solemn council the chief nobles of the kingdom of the Franks, he appointed him, by their unanimous advice, his colleague in the kingdom, and heir of the imperial dignity, and, placing his crown upon his head, named him Emperor and Augustus. This design of his was accepted by all present with great favour, for a divine inspiration seemed to influence him for the good of the state ; and this deed increased his majesty, and struck foreign nations with no slight terror. Then despatching his son into Aquitaine, he himself, according to his wont, though weighed down by years, set out on the chase, not far from his palace at Aix-la-Chapelle, and having occupied the remainder of the autumn in this pastime, returned there about the kalends of November. And while wintering there he was seized with a severe fever, in the month of January, and took to his bed. He thought that by abstinence from food, as was his custom in attacks of fever, he should eradicate or keep down the disease ; but an access of pain in the side (which the Greeks call pleurisy) coming on, and the king still fasting, nor maintaining his strength otherwise than by a very little liquid, on the seventh day from, taking to his bed, having received the sacrament, he died, in the seventy second year of his age, and the forty-seventh of his reign, at three o'clock a.m. on the 5th of February, 814. 32. The body was washed and prepared in the usual manner, removed to the church and buried, to the terrible grief of the people. There prevailed some doubt at first where it should be deposited, as he had given no directions respecting it ; but"], [75, "SIGNS AND OMENS. 47 all minds finally resolved that he could nowhere find a fitter tomb than in the very church which he had erected at his own cost, for the love of God and our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the honour of the holy and everlasting Virgin, his mother. Therein he was interred on the same day on which he died, and a golden canopy was raised over his tomb, with his effigy and epitaph. The epitaph was as follows : \u2014 \" Under this tomb is laid the body of Charles the Great and Orthodox Emperor, who gloriously extended the kingdom of the Franks, and happily reigned for seven -and-forty years. He died, aged seventy, a.d. 814, on the 5th of the kalends of February.\" 33. There were so many omens of his approaching death, that not only others but he himself had perceived that it was at hand. For three successive years preceding his decease the decline of the sun and moon was very great, and spots on the sun of a black colour were seen for the space of seven days. A colonnade which had been constructed with tremendous labour between the basilica and the palace, fell to its very foundations oh Ascension Day, with a sudden crash. The bridge across the Rhine at Mayence, which he had raised of wood, with great labour and wonderful difficulty, for ten years, so that it seemed likely to last for ever, being accidentally set on fire, burned for three hours with such fierceness, that except what the water covered not a splinter remained. When prosecuting, moreover, his last expedition into Saxony against Godofrid, King of the Danes, just as before sunrise he had set out from his camp and begun his march, he saw, on the sudden, a flaming torch whirl through the air from right to left; and while much wondering what this omen portended, the horse which he rode suddenly fell, with his head downwards, and flung him so heavily to the earth that the buckle of his cloak being broken and his sword-belt loosened, he was raised by those who hastened to his assistance all unarmed. The javelin, also, which he hap pened to have in his hand, was flung by the shock to a distance of twenty feet or more. To this was added the constant tremor of the palace at Aix-la-Chapelle, and the creaking of the panels in every house where he visited. The basilica, moreover, in which he was afterwards interred, was struck by lightning, and the golden apple which adorned the roof-peak, shattered by the flame from heaven, was flung upon the roof of the pontiff's"], [76, "48 POSTSCRIPT I. house, contiguous to the basilica. There was in the same basilica, on the margin of the circle which encompassed the building, between the upper and lower arches, an epigraph in red letters, showing the name of the founder of the temple, and concluding with the words CAROLUS PRINCEPS. It was noticed by some that in the year in which he died, and a few months before his death, the letters of the word PRINCEPS were so obliterated that they could scarcely be traced. But the king either passed over or despised these things we have mentioned, as if they in no wise related to his affairs. The narrative of Eginhardt concludes with the details of the will of Charlemagne, which would have little interest for the general reader, and possess no historical importance. Our quotations may, therefore, terminate more appropriately with some examples of* the verses in which Charlemagne was pane gyrised and lamented by the poets of his age : \u2014 A LAMENT FOR CHARLEMAGNE, A.D.

An able essay on Charlemagne and his Court (Charlemagne et sa Cour), by Monsieur Haureau, enlarges upon some points which we have already suggested for the consideration of the reader. He may not be unwilling, however, to examine Monsieur Haureau's conclusions. He may wish, for instance, to gain some idea of the ordinary costume of the great Emperor. Here, then, is a picture : \u2014 2. The general dress of Charlemagne was that of the ancient Franks, some what modified by imitation of the Gallic costume. From his shoulders to his feet descended the barbaric pallium \u2014 the white or blue mantle which, cut away at the sides, or rather, fashioned as a whole of two flaps or lappets joined at the top, left exposed his legs adorned with linen socks, that were kept in their place by interlacing strings. This mantle covered a tunic embroidered with silk fringe, linen drawers, and a shirt of the same material. Round the waist glittered a belt of gold or silver, which sustained a sword in a golden scabbard. Gilded slippers completed his array, which failed in elegance, but lacked not majesty. During the winter Charles wore a close-fitting coat of the skin of a martin or otter, \u2014 the spoil ravished from the savage denizens of the forests of ancient France. It was, with some slight differences, the dress of the common people. 3. At solemn festivals, the day of Christmas and Paschal, in the general assem blies of the Franks, or when there arrived at his court from distant regions any foreign ambassadors, to demand peace or renew the oath of homage, Charles walked with a slow step * and head erect, dazzling the eyes of all by the splendour of the embroideries and the precious stones which enriched every part of his apparel. Sprays of golden flowers bloomed in sheaves upon his mantle, whose folds were fastened together by a clasp of solid metal ; his buskins sparkled with gems ; his head bore a diadem where agates, sapphires, emeralds, and orient pearls blended their various fires. His right hand grasped a baton of apple-wood, which terminated in a golden apple enriched with carved ornamentation. He did not love, says Eginhard, the costumes of other peoples, however superb, and he would never assume them, except at Rome : on one occasion at the request of Pope Adrian, and again at the entreaty of Leo, his successor, when he suffered himself to be clothed in the long tunic, chlaymys, and buskin of the * So Byron's Conrad, when he reaches the presence of his men, assumes a slower walk, his \" wonted statelier step,\" \u2014 \" Nor rush, disturb'd by haste, to vulgar view ; For well had Conrad learn'd to curb the crowd By arts that veil, and oft preserve the proud ; His was the lofty port, the distant mien, That seems to shun the right, and awes if seen.\" The Corsair, canto i. 16. E 2"], [80, "52 NOTE. Roman habit. When the nobles of his court, fond, like savages and children, of vivid colours, appeared in his presence burdened with unusual ornaments, he jested with them, or, when in no jesting humour, loaded them with severe re proaches. The anonymous monk of Saint Gall relates on this point an amusing adventure : \u2014 Having subdued the Lombards, Charles had established his quarters in the city of Aquileia, and reposed himself in that pleasant spot, while waiting for a new opportunity of displaying the vigour of his arms. One Sunday, after the cele bration of mass, he said to his faithful servants :\u2014 \" Let us not wax heavy in idleness, but, without returning to our palace, and habited as we are, set out for the chase.\" So saying, he sprung on his horse, and galloped towards the plain. Everybody hastened to follow him, for an invitation conveyed in such a tone was a command. The sky was clouded by a dense mist ; a close cold rain poured down upon the earth, and increased the melancholy aspect of the woods, then bare of foliage. Charles in the morning had flung upon his shoulders a sheep's skin, which, from its long use, was worth little more than the wretched cloak of St. Martin ; but his courtiers were attired in rich garments, which the Venetian mer chants disposed of at exorbitant prices in the marts of Pavia. Upon the breasts of some sparkled sumptuous silken stuffs, decked, after the fashion of embroidery, with feathers of a thousand colours, from the tails of peacocks and the necks of the birds of Ph\u0153nicia. Others wore clothes which glowed with the Tyrian purple, and were bordered with fringe of cedarn bark ; and not a few were habited in pinked stuffs and furs of dormouse skin. The chase, throughout the day, was protracted over the plains and in the woods, and throughout the day the rain descended, penetrating these rich garments, which, moreover, were sorely ill treated by brambles, thorns, and the branches of trees, and sullied by the blood of the deer ; so that our hunters, on returning to the city at night, were but poorly covered with the deplorable relics of their gorgeous dresses. Rejoicing in having thus punished their frivolous love of show, Charles was willing still further to amuse himself at their expense. He ordered that, on the morrow, everybody should appear at the palace in the attire of the preceding day. No one durst fail to appear at this rendezvous. They presented themselves, confused at their deplorable condition. Charles, seeing them all around him, said smilingly to the gentlemen of his chamber, \u2014 \" Go, clean with your hands our hunting-dress, and bring it to us without delay.\" This task was soon performed, and the Emperor, showing his sheep's skin uninjured and fit for service, ridiculed at his ease the luxury in rags of his nobles. 4. \" If we have related at length,\" says Monsieur Haureau, \" this somewhat vulgar anecdote, it is because we think it brings prominently forward the historic figure of Charlemagne. No one in the crowd of his followers could boast that his heart was loftier or haughtier ; that he could command with more nobility, or threaten or reward with greater majesty. Meanwhile, with a faultless taste, \"with a profound feeling for true greatness, he sought in everything and always for simplicity.\" 5. As the romancists have pretended that the great Emperor of the West was eight feet in height, so have they endowed him, as was fitting, with a preternatural appetite. A quarter of a sheep, two fowls, and a fat goose composed (they tell"], [81, "CHARLEMAGNE AND LITERATURE. 53 us) his dinner. It is true that he eat heartily, but never to excess, and he was rigidly temperate in the use of wine. During his meals he enjoyed the conver sation of his children, or listened to a clerk who read aloud the history of some hero of the past, or an extract from the Fathers. He was passionately fond of bathing, and as a bold and skilful swimmer had no equal. His warm temperament led him to indulge too much in the pleasures of Venus, and besides numeruus concubines, he had no less than nine wives. His first wife Himiltruda he divorced, that he might increase his power by an alliance with D.sir^e, the daughter of Didier, King of the Lombards. Like most marriages dictated by reasons of stale policy, it proved an unhappy one ; Desiree was repudiated, and the Emperor next shared his throne and bed with Hildegard, a pious, beautiful, and noble Suevia* lady. She married Charlemagne in 772, and died at Thionville on the 30th of April, 783, lamented by her husband and his subjects. His grief, however, did not prevent him from speedily espousing Fastrada, daughter of Count Rodolph, whose beauty he first saw at Worms. Her cruelty rendered her. so generally odious, that her death at Frankfort, in 794, was the signal for a national rejoicing. The uxorious Emperor wedded for his fifth wife Luitgard,the daughter of a German count whose name is unknown. She died at Tours in the year 800. His sixth wife was Maltegard ; and three others, who appear to have occupied the same relations towards him as the sultanas of the harem towards the Grand Seignior, were named respectively Gersuinda, Reine, and Adalinde. 6. Our portraiture of Charlemagne would be incomplete if we did not examine his achievements as a patron of literature and the arts; \" labouring to restore the study of letters, summoning artists and scholars from all quarters ; allotting to some the task of teaching in every country the noble sciences ; charging others with the erection of majestic temples or the suspension of bold-arched bridges across the rivers ; seeking to draw together, to unite, the peoples which nature had separated ; founding monasteries and opening schools, and everywhere succeeding in carrying a love of arts and letters into regions which hitherto had been com pletely barred against the conquests of civilisation.\" 7. Before instructing his subjects he instructed himself. He learned to read, and, so much accomplished, begun to study from the rudimentary works of Martianus Capella, and Cassiodorus, grammar, logic, astronomy, medicine, and, in general, all the branches of the seven liberal arts, inviting his courtiers to follow his example. 8. It is a question often discussed \u2014 Did Charlemagne know how to write ? We quote the passage in Eginhard, which has originated the controversy: \u2014 \"He essayed also to write, and had always under his pillow some tablets and papers, to accustom his hand, whenever he had leisure, in tracing characters; but he did not succeed in a task which he had begun too late.\" Upon this simple phrase several writers have erected the most elaborate structures of logical dis sertation. Nevertheless we are of Monsieur Haureau's opinion, that Charle magne could write, but wrote badly, and practised at his leisure the formation of letters worthy to be compared with the exquisite productions of those skilful hands to whom we owe the splendid manuscripts of the eighth century. His fingers had not the necessary suppleness to excel in an art so difficult. He began his labours too late. Eut why suppose that he could not write at all? There is"], [82, "54 NOTE. direct evidence to the contrary ; and they who maintain a thesis so absurd must belong to that school of historical doubters \u2014 negative historians \u2014 which has recently become too popular. 9. Charlemagne began a grammar of the Frank language ; formed a collection of the ancient lyrics which celebrated the actions of the German chiefs, and established several famous schools, in connection with the cathedral churches of Lyons, Orleans, and St. Denis, and the cloisters of St. Martin of Tours, Fulde, Fontenelle, Arriane, and Corbie. One of the reforms which largely occupied him was that of \" plain-song.\" Even at the present day there is a wide difference in liturgical usages, and a great number of local customs obtain, which depart from the Roman order. But in the time of Charlemagne there were many more divergences ; nearly every church observed its own peculiar rites. Pepin had already made some efforts to correct this disorder, but with scanty success. In 787, during the festival of Easter, there arose in the imperial presence a keen dispute between the Roman chanters and the Frankish chanters of his chapel. \" The Franks boasted of the excellence of their method ; the Romans maintained that they had altered all the ancient practices, while Rome devoutly followed the laws enunciated by St. Gregory. As the quarrel continued, the king said to his chanters, ' Where, in your opinion, should you seek for the purest water \u2014 at the spring, or in the brook ? ' * At the spring,' they replied with one voice. ' Return then,' he remarked, ' to your spring in St. Gregory, for it is manifest that one of your factions has corrupted the ecclesiastical song.' And he demanded of the Pope priests trained in a good school, and capable of instructing pupils. Thus was carried out, following in the footsteps of the monk of Angouleme, the great reform of plain-song in all the churches of the empire.\" 10. A king endowed with so lofty a genius could not fail to become a great legis lator. The collection of the Capitularies, formed by Baluze, is not only an historical monument, but a code worthy of comparison with those of the Roman emperors, even if we take into account the difference of the times. Not but that we must prefer the Justinian laws to the decrees of the Emperor of the West. But Jus tinian only collected laws already in existence, and sanctioned modifications which \" the process of the years\" had gradually introduced into the civil rela tions of an ancient commonwealth. Charlemagne legislated for nations still in their barbarous and untutored youth. It was for him to invent, to adapt, to create. Justice was his only inspiration ; prudence his council of jurisconsults. And it is a signal proof of the vastness of his mind that (as Montesquieu says) you may discern in his laws a spirit of sagacity which comprehends, and a force of will which subdues, everything. A double-minded man \u2014 to use the expression of Augustin Thierry \u2014 partly Roman and partly German, he was neither too German nor too Roman ; but understood how far the habits and manners of the old would agree with the tastes and sympathies of the new. It has been justly observed that this was his greatest glory. He was the first civiliser of western Europe. And \"the movement,\" says Monsieur Ampere, \" to which he gave the impetus still endures ; the light which he kindled has never died out, nor will it wane but with the sun 1\" 11. These desultory remarks shall conclude with Monsieur Haureau's estimate of Charlemagne as a conqueror."], [83, "55 CHARLEMAGNE AS A CONQUEROR, \" It is not to be denied,\" he says, \" that he had the ambition to enlarge the bounds of his empire, and that, to satisfy his greed of conquest, he showed little respect for the rights of others. It is also incontestable that, to secure the fruits of his victories, he poured out much blood. When the majority of historians are silent upon the massacre of 4,000 Saxons, despatched to the abyss of shadows to console the manes of the Franks killed in contending with them, we may readily ascertain how pitiless was the policy of Charlemagne from a perusal of the Capitu lary of Paderborn. It is not here the spirit of vengeance which dictates the decrees of death ; it is the Christian king, who, in the seclusion of his closet, in the presence of his councillors, and, doubtlessly, after having consulted them, proclaims the penalty which shall be enforced upon Saxons surprised with or without arms, who, faithful to their pagan gods, shall refuse baptism. These obstinate heretics shall be put to the sword. Such was the proselytising method of the great Charles. You condemn it ; and we willingly subscribe to that con demnation. But can we demand that the son of Pepin shall in all things be in advance of his race and the age ? There exists, we know, a Charlemagne of the philosophers and encyclop\u00e6dists, formed by the lessons of D'Alembert and Frederic, who is painted to us as abjuring that arbitrary power so fatal to princes, as recognising and proclaiming, at the dawn of the ninth century, the inalienable privileges of man which had fallen into oblivion; but this singular personage lived only in the imagination of rhetoricians, and not in history. Charlemagne was as plastic, as accommodating, as became the most enlightened, and, conse quently the least passionate, man of the age. He showed more than once, under solemn circumstances, that he knew both how to forgive and forget; but with the modern ideas which some writers attribute to him, far from increasing his territory, he would soon have lost his patrimonial inheritance ; far from extend ing civilisation to the farthest borders of Saxony, Moravia, and Pomerania, to the watery frontiers of the savage Danes, he had thrown open to the invasions of barbarians all central Gaul, all Italy, and Rome herself. Those bloody heca tombs at which our conscience revolts do not exite the least emotion in the ancient annalists. They have almost all reproduced the same catalogue of vic tims offered up to the security of the empire and religion, but this has not hindered them from calling Charlemagne the most pious, most magnanimous, and most merciful of emperors. As for the romancists, still simpler interpreters of the popular sentiments, they do not suffer the number of his victims to detract from his piety. On the contrary, immediately that the terrible chief of the Franks encounters one of the enemy's paladins, he cries out, i Confess thyself a Christian, or I pluck out thy life.' In the chronicle of the mythic Turpin it is computed that several armies of three or four hundred thousand Saracens Charlemagne and his knights slaughtered without pity, when their leaders did not show sufficient eagerness to solicit baptism. 12. \" Let us leave awhile the sorrows of our religious tolerance and our inter national humanity, to recognise in Charlemagne only the conqueror of the Huns, the Saxons, the Bavarians, the Swabians, the Moravians, the Sclaves, the Lom bards, the Saracens, the Corsicans \u2014 parading from one frontier of Europe to the other his armies, glorious with a hundred victories, and sowing everywhere the modified but still kindling germs of the ancient civilisation transmitted to the"], [84, "56 NOTE.

Here and there the wood has been cleared away, and enclosures formed for cattle. Here and there the stubble field bears evidence of having rewarded the labourer's toil. On many a gentle ascent stands a rude, rough windmill, whose fans no longer answer to the stirring wind. But these signs of cultivation are comparatively few, and nature still rejoices in much of her primeval wildness. 2. Each of the lofty ridges we have spoken of is now, on the morning of the 14th of October, 1066, crested with armed men, and glints and gleams in the early sunshine with the pomp of banner and spear. On the northern ascent are ranked the men of Saxon England, led by the gallant Harold ; on the southern, known to later days as Telham Hill, muster the knights of Normandy, and warriors from every European clime, owning the leadership of Count William, son of Rollo. In the rear of the Saxons lies their native land ; in the rear of the Normans, sweeps the sea. The former are about to struggle for the pre servation of their liberties ; the latter aspire at empire and boundless booty. And unknown to these, the actors in this momentous scene, the very destinies of the civilised world depend upon the issue. But before we sketch its principal details, it will be necessary to understand the causes which led to so remarkable an event. 3. In the history of Europe the religious element has always been actively at work, and most of its striking changes have been induced by the antagonism between the Church of Borne and the spirit of a free people. The Catholic religion was, it is true, the religion of Saxon England, and at first the Saxon clergy submitted themselves absolutely to the suzerainty of the Papacy, but with that appetite for independence and love of liberty which in all ages have characterised the nations of the North, they soon wearied of a degrading thraldom, and they finally refused to pay to Rome more than that general respect which the British Christians had been willing to render in the time of Augustine.* England was, therefore, a land of heretics * Hor\u00e6 Britannic\u00e6."], [89, "WILLIAM OF NORMANDY. 61 long before it became a land of Lollards and Wickliffites. It excited the deep indignation of Rome, and its enemies became the natural allies of the papal power. The ambition of a hostile country was stirred up against it, and the blessings of the Church and immeasurable plunder were freely offered to whomsoever would reduce the schismatics to subjection, and enforce the pay ment of an annual tribute. 4. Rome looked around for an instrument to work out its revenge, and found one singularly well qualified for the enter prise in William, Count of Normandy. This was the bastard son of Count Robert, whose fierceness of temper and impetuosity of character had procured him the sobriquet of Robert the Devil. His mother was Arlete, a young maiden of Falaise,* whose beauty had charmed the wild fancy of the Norman Count, when one day returning from the chase he beheld her, as is the Normandy custom, washing linen in a brook. His desire for so lovely a mistress induced him to make proposals to her father, which, after consulting a wise and reverend hermit,-)- the father gratefully accepted. Arlete \u2014 a corruption of the Danish name Herleve\u2014 submitted to the Count's embraces, and became the mother of the future Conqueror of England. 5. William was tenderly loved by his hot-headed father, who, when in the seventh year of his son's childhood, he proposed a pilgrimage on foot to Jerusalem, to obtain forgiveness of his sins, openly named him the successor to his ducal crown. His barons had remonstrated against the pilgrimage on the ground that it was not well the land should be without a chief. \" By my faith,\" answered Robert, \" I leave you not without a lord. I have a little bastard who, if it please God, will certainly become a gallant man, and I know that he is my son. Receive him, therefore, as your prince, for I name him my heir, and hence forth give him the whole duchy of Normandy.\" J Robert died during his pilgrimage, but his son did not gain his inheritance without a struggle. There were many who protested they would not be ruled by a bastard, but their defeat at the Val des Dunes, near Caen, relieved him from their hostility.^ As he advanced in years, his father's fond prediction was amply justi- * St. Maure, in Chronique des Dues de Normandie. t Benoit de St. Maure.

He had all the qualities of the hero, as men then judged the heroic : an unbending will, an overmastering temper, a fierce love of war, a large capacity for government, dauntless courage, and measureless ambition. His passion for fine horses was extraordinary ; his physical strength was notable in an age of strong men ; in martial exercises his skill and address were eminent. Such a man was not to be confined within the limits of a narrow province. He had already carried his arms into Anjou and Bretagne, and now looked around for a wider sphere for the display of his genius. A loyal son of the Church, and exact in its observances, an ambitious chief of powerful and unruly barons, he was exactly the instrument that Rome required to carry out her vindictive policy. 6. Probably at an early period the conquest of England presented itself to Count William as a thing to be attempted. He had visited the court of Edward the Confessor, his kins man, in 1051, and his attentive eye had marked the richness of the fair Saxon land, its thriving towns, its busy homesteads, and smiling valleys. He must have noted the disorganisation of society produced by the saintly Edward's anti-national policy and laxity of government ; while the fact that Edward had no son to continue the dynasty would not be forgotten by the subtle schemer. He saw, too, that England was even then under Norman influence, owing to Edward's affection for the country where he had passed hie earlier and happier life. Godwin, the great Saxon earl, and his sons Sweyn, Tostig, and Gurth, had been driven into a shameful exile. Harold, the hope and pride of every true Saxon heart, had retired to Ire land, and his estates had been bestowed upon Earl Leofric. Edith the Queen, the daughter of Earl Godwin, was immured in a nunnery at Wherwell, the king putting his faith in celibacy, and having neither eye nor heart for young aud innocent beauty. A Norman monk was Archbishop of Canterbury ; Normans officered the fleet at Dover; Norman soldiers garrisoned the fortresses ; Norman fashions prevailed at court, and courteous tongues lisped the Norman speech.* But whatever the secret dreams of the ambitious Norman, it does not appear that he communicated them to King Edward. He may have felt that a premature development of * Roger de Hoveden."], [91, "THE HEGIRA OF THE NORMANS. 63 his designs would tend to their defeat, and so been content to watch the slow march of circumstances towards the attain ment of his desire. If King Edward suspected them, he on his part preserved the same prudent silence, while receiving his gal lant kinsman with especial courtesy and notable tenderness. He lavished upon him costly gifts of arms and horses, dogs and falcons, and while his presence brightened the gloom of his monkish court, seemed to rejoice in abandoning for awhile his wonted seclusion.* And when William returned to his duchy, he redoubled the favour with which he had previously regarded all men of Norman lineage. Not so with the English people. They felt then that anti pathy to foreigners which still at times their descendants mani fest, and rejoiced exceedingly when the triumphant return of Earl Godwin and Earl Harold dispersed the Norman favourites of their king, as the swift wind scatters the shadows of a murky night. The appearance of their galleys on the Thames, as high as the suburb of Suth-weorde, or Southwark, was a warn ing which the Normans wisely took good heed of. They quickly donned their armour, mounted their steeds, and prepared to fight their way to the sea-coast. The retreat was headed by the Norman Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Norman Bishop of London, armed cap-a-pie, and with lance in hand. \" Bodies of men drew up against them at every angle, with the Saxon cry of ' Out, out ! down with the outland men '.' \" Through each, spear pierced and sword clove the way. Red with blood hurtled the spear of the Bishop of London ; broken to the hilt was the sword militant in the terrible hand of the Archbishop of Canterbury. \" So on they rode, so on they slaughtered, gained the eastern gate of the city, and passed with but two of their number lost. The fields once gained, for better precaution they separated. Some few, not quite ignorant of the Saxon tongue, doffed their mail, and crept through forest and fell to the sea-shore ; others retained steed and arms, but shunned equally the high roads. The two prelates were among the last ; they gained in safety Ness, in Essex, threw themselves into an open, crazy fishing-boat, committed themselves to the waves, and, half drowned and half famished, drifted over the Channel to the French shores. Of the rest of the courtly foreigners, * Roman de Rou."], [92, "64 BATTLE OF HASTINGS. some took refuge in the forts yet held by their countrymen ; some lay concealed in creeks and caves till they could find or steal boats for their passage.\"* This hegira of the Normans took place in the year of our Lord 1052. 7. Under the influence of Earl Harold, for whom King Edward appears to have entertained a sincere affection and profound respect, the royal councils gradually assumed a more national complexion, and many disorders in the government were corrected. The Welsh were beaten back into their moun tain fastnesses, the northern nobles were conciliated or over powered, and the sunshine of prosperous peace fell upon the happy land. But the hostility of Rome, and an error in state craft on the part of Harold, soon disturbed these halcyon days, and induced that great revolution in European history known as the Norman Conquest. 8. King Knut, in the flush of Danish supremacy, had ordained a yearly tribute to Rome, called \" Peter's pence,\" but when England threw off the yoke of the Danes, she also released her self from this hateful obligation. Only voluntary offerings now flowed to the stores of the pontifical treasury. The Roman authorities grieved deeply at the obstinate wickedness of the Saxons, and the expulsion of the Norman prelates inflamed them with immeasurable anger. At this juncture a certain incident brought them into close relations with the ruler of Normandy. There was at the ducal court a monk of remarkable grasp of mind' and astuteness of character, a Lombard by birth, named Lanfranc, who fell into disgrace with William for cen suring his marriage to Matilda, daughter of Baldwin, Count of Flanders, his relation within the degrees of consanguinity pro hibited by the Church. The ambitious Italian then retired to Rome, where he suddenly was found to defend the marriage which he had previously disapproved ; and his address obtained from the pope a formal dispensation, relieving William from the consequences of his sin. The count rewarded this service with his special favour, and Lanfranc became his ambassador at the court of Rome. The papal claims, and William's succession to the English throne, now instigated a common policy, which Lanfranc carried out with consummate ability ; and though no armed invasion as yet was talked of, Rome's powerful vassal * Bulwer Lytton."], [93, "THE KING'S WARNING. 65 could not but be aware that his conquering banner would assuredly receive the papal benediction.* 9. When peace was concluded, in 1052, between Earl Godwin and his king, the former gave as hostages for his fidelity his son Wolnoth, and his grandson, Haco, who now forten years had pined in a splendid captivity at the court of Count William. Availing himself of the cordial understanding existing between his sovereign and himself, Harold solicited their return to their family. The king willingly consented ; but when the earl preferred a second request, that he himself might cross the seas and claim them from Count William, showed a lively alarm. \" I will not gainsay thee,\" he said; \" but if thou goest, thou goest without my consent ; for thy journey will certainly bring some evil upon thee and thy country. I know Cour.t William, and the subtlety of his soul ; .he hates thee, and will grant thee nothing, unless it bring some gain to himself. It were safer to send some trusty person in thy behalf.\"-!- Already it was perceived that the struggle for the English crown at Edward's decease would lie between William and his powerful Saxon rival. Whether Harold was ignorant of designs which his king cer tainly suspected, or whether he desired to take the measure of his probable antagonist, it is enough that no warnings could deter him from his visit to the Norman court ; and he set out on his journey as on a summer tour, his friends at his side, his falcon on his wrist, and his hounds running before him. 10. The evil issue of this expedition is well known. While detained at William's court, and ostensibly treated as a favoured guest, he was ensnared into pledging himself, upon the bones and relics of the most famous saints, to wed Adeliza, the count's daughter; to give his own sister in marriage to one of the count's most powerful nobles ; and to assist him in realising the splendid heritage of the crown of England, promised him, as he asserted, by Edward the Confessor.J He was further required, as a guarantee of his sincerity, to leave his brother Wolnoth as a hostage until William wore the crown ; and then, duped and betrayed, and in great agony of soul, he returned to England, acknowledging too late the wisdom of King Edward's * Thierry's Conquest of England. t Chronique de Normandie. Roman de Rou. J Eadmeri Monasterii Cantuariensis Hist., ed. Selden. F"], [94, "66 BATTLE OF HASTINGS. warnings. \" Did I not tell thee,\" said the king, \" that I knew this William, and that thy journey would inflict great evils upon thee and thy nation ? Heaven grant that these evils happen not in my time !\" 11. Harold's error indeed was fraught with the most momen tous consequences, for it gave the Romish Church a plausible pretext to flutter before the eyes of Europe. The oath might have been fraudulently obtained, but it was solemnly sworn, and sworn on the most sacred relics of the Church ; and if it were violated, the Church, in the opinion of the age, would be bound to punish the violation. A presentiment of the perils likely to flow from ecclesiastical vengeance, supported by the ambition of the Count of Normandy, appears at once to have occupied the popular mind. The nation was afflicted with an unutterable terror. Nor were prophecies wanting to deepen the alarm. It was remembered, or priestly craft discovered, that of old the saints had predicted terrible calamities as likely to impend at this particular period. One had foretold such horrors as the Saxons had never experienced since their swift keels had sailed from the mouth of the Elbe ; another the invasion of England by a people who should come out of France, and hurl down the pride of the Angles in the dust for ever. The sky and the earth had their omens, as is usual in all seasons of popular dismay ; and men gazed in silent awe at the fatal cloud which brooded over the land, expecting every moment that the live lightning and the destroying bolt would leap from its terrible womb. 12. The king's health, which had long been waning, now gave way apace. He had lived to repent of his Norman proclivities, and could not conceal from himself that they were the cause of much of the danger which menaced his realms, much of the darkness of the doom which awaited his country. To stifle his accusing conscience he turned with feverish eagerness to the observances of the Church. He occupied himself in constant religious exercises; he poured out liberal largesse upon the monasteries and holy places. In the midst of these compunctious exertions his last hour came. The sunset of life often gives us a mystical lore, and the royal deathbed was disturbed by visions of the coming woe. His agony found utterance in the phrases of the Jewish prophets :\u2014 \" The Lord hath bent His bow,\" he"], [95, "HAROLD'S ACCESSION. 67 would exclaim, \" the Lord hath prepared His sword ! He brandisheth it to and fro like a warrior ! He boweth the moun tains, and cometh down, and the darkness is under His feet ! By fire and by sword will He manifest His wrath!\"* The terror of his words drove the colour from the faces of those who watched, and froze their lips into silence. Only Stigand, the worldly Archbishop of Canterbury, remained unmoved, and smiled scornfully at men whom a dotard's fancies alarmed.\")- 13. The king then named Harold as his successor, influenced in his choice by patriotic motives, since otherwise the legitimate heir was Edgar the Atheling, grandson of Edmund Ironsides (January 5, 1066). The nomination was confirmed by the Saxon thegns, and approved by the Saxon people, who loved him because he was \"a destroyer of foreign power,\" and recognised in him the only man able to cope successfully with the dangers of the time. And from the moment of his accession, says the ancient historian of his deeds, he showed himself wise, and just, and affable ; active for his country's good ; and never sparing himself either by land or sea. J By the consent of all he was chosen, inasmuch as there was none more skilful than he in war, or wiser in the laws of the land, or more gifted with every virtue.\u00a7 But it was regarded as an evil omen, that at this very time a blood-red comet streamed across the heavens, with fear of change perplexing nations, and boding, as the people believed, the ruin of their beloved country. 14. The news of Harold's accession transported William with ungovernable wrath. With darkened brow, and speechless with anger, he strode to and fro in his palace hall. None of his attendants durst approach him ; all stood apart, gazing at one another in silence. A favourite councillor entered, and he, bolder than the rest, for he was William Fitz-Osbert, the most potent of his vavasours, inquired, \" Why, my lord, dost thou not communicate thy intelligence to us ? It is openly said that Edward, King of the Angles, is dead, and that Harold, violating his oath, has seized upon the crown.\" \" It is even so,\" replied the count ; \" and my grief is at Edward's death, my anger at the wrong that Harold has done me.\" \" Nay, then,\" exclaimed * Ailredi, Vita Edicardi Confessoris, in Gale's Hist. Angl. Scriptorum. t William of Malmesbury. J Roger de Hoveden. jj Vita Heraldi. F 2"], [96, "68 BATTLE OF HASTINGS. the warlike Fitz-Osbert, \"chafe not at a matter which may easily be amended. For Edward's death there may be no remedy, but there is for Harold's wrong. Thy cause is just ; thy knights are valiant. Strike boldly, for what is well begun is half done.\" * 15. It was at this time that Tostig, the proud earl whom the Anglo-Danes of Northumbria had banished, and Harold's own brother, but whom he had refused to reimpose upon the unwil ling Northumbrians, arrived at William's court, and urged him not to allow a perjurer to reign in peace. He boasted that his power and influence in England were greater than the king his brother's, and promised the possession of the kingdom to whom soever would unite with him to achieve its conquest. The astute Norman contented himself with furnishing some small vessels to test the truth of his professions. With these Tostig, instead of landing in England, proceeded on a similar errand to Sweyn, King of Denmark. Meeting with a sharp refusal, he next repaired to Harold Hardrada, the last of the Scandinavian Sea-kings, and him he induced, by dint of warm flatteries and glowing promises, to attempt the perilous enterprise ; and he undertook to put to sea with his fleet as soon as the smile of the spring should loosen the ice-bonds of ocean.-)- 16. Meanwhile a messenger from William arrived at the court of Harold, and addressed the king, before his thegns, in words like these : \u2014 \" William, Count of the Normans, sends to remind thee of the oath which thou didst swear to him, by mouth and by hand, upon good and holy relics.\" \" It is true,\" replied the Saxon king, \" that I swore such an oath to Count William, but I swore it under restraint. I promised what did not belong to me, and what I am unable to perform. My royalty is not mine, nor can I divest myself of it without the consent of my people ; nor without the consent of my people can I take to myself a foreign wife. As for my sister, whom the count claims to wed to one of his barons, she died, alas ! but seven days ago. Would he have me send him her corpse?\" A second messenger renewed the count's reproaches, but in honeyed terms, and exacting only the fulfilment of one condi tion, that Harold should marry the youthful Adeliza. Harold was too sagacious a statesman not to see that such a marriage, * Chronique de Normandie. t Snorro Sturleson, ed. Laing."], [97, "ECCLESIASTICAL INTRIGUES. 69 while most distasteful to the nation, could but result in rendering him William's vassal, and he not only refused, but to render the refusal final, wedded Aldyth, the sister of Morcar and Edwin, Earls of Northumbria and Mercia \u2014 an alliance which largely strengthened his power and augmented his resources. His great rival then swore, par le splendar de De (by the splendour of God), that within the year he would come and demand the whole of his debt, and pursue the traitor to the very places where he believed his footing to be the firmest and most unshaken.* 17. His first step was to excite against the Saxon the preju dices of the common people, by proclaiming him a perjurer, and a scorner of the relics of the blessed saints. On the con tinent he wholly succeeded, and even in England not a few forgot their patriotism in the excess of their fanaticism. He next applied himself to secure the help and sanction of the Romish Church. Through Lanfranc he accused his enemy of sacrilege before the pontiff's court, and demanded that England should be placed under the ban of the Church, and declared the property of the first occupant approved of by the Pope. He asserted his own claims as incontestable, in virtue of his kinship to King Edward, and his intentions in his favour. Harold was summoned to answer the Norman's charges, but he refused to acknowledge the Pope's jurisdiction in the matter, and would neither submit the independence of his crown to foreign arbi trament, nor affect to believe in the equity of a tribunal which he knew to have predetermined the cause against him. The Pope, Alexander II., was the nominee and creature of the famous Hildebrand, whose sole aim and object it had been to secularise the power of the Romish Church, and assert its supremacy over the whole of Christendom. He saw in Count William the instrument of pontifical vengeance, and hailed with scarce concealed exultation the opportunity afforded him of subjugating free and recusant England. But it was not without difficulty he imposed his views upon the conclave of the cardinals, and procured a papal judgment to the effect that William of Normandy was permitted to invade England, to reduce it to obedience to the Holy Church, aud reimpose for ever the tax of Saint Peter's pence. A bull of excommunication which the * William of Malmesbury."], [98, "70 BATTLE OF HASTINGS Pope fulminated against Harold and his adherents was entrusted to William's envoy, and Hildebrand also placed in his hands a banner of the Roman Church, and a ring containing one of the hairs of St. Peter, set beneath a costly diamond. 18. Thus sanctioned and inspired by the Church, the count began to assemble an army in numbers sufficient for the great enterprise he contemplated. High pay and boundless booty were promised to every good and true man content to serve him with lance, or sword, or bow. Religious enthusiasm was employed to stir up the feelings of the masses, and so successful was the agency of this powerful but dangerous lever, that many a widowed mother sent her sons to enrol their names for the salvation of their souls. Priests gave their money, merchants contributed their merchandise, peasants gladly parted with their scanty stores. The brave brought their prowess, the man of genius his skill, the wealthy their wealth and credit. Hither sped the tawny-haired sons of the Goth, reeking with the purple of the Rhenish vineyards ; and the quick-eyed children of the South, from their homes in the shadow- of the lofty Alps. The bright, fresh descendants of the Dane and the Norseman came with their swinging battle-axes and brawny arms. The tardy Fleming for once could quicken his step, charmed by a vision of Saxon ale and Saxon beauty. Ready and alert, then as in all times, the Frank merrily hastened to the melee and the feast. From Anjou and from Maine, from Bretagne and Poitou, from Aquitaine and Burgundy, from the snowy heights of Norway and the pine-clad slopes of the Apennines, from the iron-bound coast of the Baltic and the glittering shores of the Mediterranean \u2014 knights and men-at-arms, pikemen and bow men, on horse and on foot, richly equipped or travel-worn and weather-beaten \u2014 they came, they came ! In every port of Normandy arose the hum of preparation. By night and by day went up the clangour of hammers and the roar of fire : swords were sharpened, coats of mail fashioned, and swift keels sprang into the ready waters. Meantime William encouraged his followers by liberal gifts, portioning out already the fair land which he claimed as his inheritance. He sought, too, for help on every side. From the King of France he received a cold denial, for the monarch was unwilling that a powerful vassal should become still more powerful\u2014 should exchange a duke's"], [99, "71 THE FIRST CRUSADE. crown for a king's.

And the priests never wearied in prayers and masses, in lavishing abroad their benedictions, in prophesying the glorious and complete success of William's pious enterprise \u2014 of this, the First Crusade of the Church of Rome against the liberties of men. 19. These motley hosts, and the vessels intended for their transport, gathered at the mouth of the Dive, a small stream which ripples into the sea between the Seine and the Oise. For a month the armada was detained in port by contrary winds. Then, with a southern breeze, it fell down the Channel as far as St. Valery, at the mouth of the Somme. But adverse weather again compelled a delay ; the fleet dropped anchor and the soldiers disembarked, exchanging their crowded vessels for rude tents upon the shore, which offered but a sorry shelter from the prevailing storms. The enthusiasm stimulated by the love of plunder wanes at the first check, and soon sub sides into unmanly despondency. So the adventurers who had collected under William's standard grew sick at heart when a long period of inaction came. \" The man is mad,\" they mur mured, \" who seeks to seize the land of another. God is wroth with such designs, and proves it by denying us a favourable wind.\" 20. William was himself a prev to mental uneasiness. He frequently visited the church of St. Valery, remained there a long time in devout exercises, and each time that he quitted it turned a wistful eye at the vane on the belfry-tower, which showed the direction of the wind. The prisoner on the night before his release watches not more eagerly for the first red streak of the dawn than watched the Count of the Normans for a breeze from the south. The discipline and the bonds which held together his immense army were necessarily lax, and if the delay endured he feared that it would melt away before him, * William Gemeticensis."], [100, "72 BATTLE OF HASTINGS. and the bright dream of his ambition pass like a vapour. Either, therefore, in very faith, or to arouse the sleeping fanaticism of his soldiers, he took from the church the relics of the patron saint, and caused them to be borne in solemn procession through his camp. The whole army knelt in prayer. The princes and barons made rich offerings ; the meanest varlet gave his piece of money. And lo, as if to confirm the wavering enthusiasm of the adventurers, on the following night the clouds broke from the face of heaven, the wind came up from the southern seas, and the sun rose with joyful augury in the clear serene (September 27, 1066). Then the trumpets sounded merrily ; tents were struck; horses were hurried on board; and the vessels swarmed with eager spirits. Before sunset the whole armament was ready. Four hundred vessels flung out their willing canvas to the wind, amid the blare of a hundred trumpets and the tumult of sixty thousand voices ! * 21. The ship which bore the chieftain of this mighty host led the van, with the consecrated banner streaming from its mast head, and its varicoloured sails blazoned with the three lions of Normandy. At the prow sat the figure of a child, bearing a bow bent, with the arrow ready to quit the string. Lanterns were hung about its sides to serve at night as a rallying point for the fleet. But being a quick sailer, the count's ship soon left its consorts vastly in the rear. In the morning, William sent a sailor to the masthead to look out for the lagging vessels, and when he declared that he saw nothing but sea and sky, dropped anchor. Still he preserved a calm countenance, and that the crew might not be seized with alarm, caused a plentiful repast and highly spiced wines to be served out to them. The sailor again ascended : four ships were in sight. A third time, and he exclaimed, \" I see in the distance a forest of masts and sails ! \" * 22. A Saxon fleet, which had long been cruising about the southern coast, want of provisions and water had compelled to return to port. At this very juncture the Norman armada swept into the bay of Hastings, and, unopposed, begun the disembarkation of the troops at Pevensey, on the 28th of Sep tember, 1066. Then the armed scouts rode to and fro along * William of Malmesbury. t William of Poitou."], [101, "73 THE NORMANS LAND. the shore, and lighted on many a height the ominous balefire, to warn affrighted England that \u2014 \u25a0 \" Count Wyllyam to Hastynges was y come, And his banner had y reared, and the contreye al y nome.\" From Hastings to Pevensey extended the formidable array of vessels. And first there landed the archers \u2014 slight, sinewy men, with shaven heads and short habits. Then came the men-at arms, the bold horsemen of Boulogne and Ponthieu, the chivalry of Bretagne and Normandy \u2014 some clothed in heavy armour, in glittering coats of mail and conical helmets of polished steel ; some carrying long and ponderous lances, others straight double edged swords, and others massive battle-axes, fit only for a giant's grasp. These were followed by the workmen of the army \u2014 smiths, pioneers, and carpenters \u2014 who were at once employed to put together the framework of three wooden castles, prepared beforehand. Lastly, the count himself landed, sur rounded by his most favoured and powerful barons. As his foot touched the shore, he slipped and fell on his face. There arose a hum of voices : \u2014 '' God help us I God preserve us ! this is a fatal sign.\" But William was prompt of wit, and dispelled the panic of the superstitious with felicitous adroitness : \u2014 '' Par la resplendar De!\" he exclaimed \u2014 his favourite oath \u2014 \"what is't ye say ? why are ye amazed ? I have taken seisin of this land with my two hands, and all that it contains is mine and yours ! \" f 23. The ships were now scuttled, rowed into deep water, and left to sink,;]: that the 60,000 soldiers might abandon all hope of returning to their native lands, unless as victors. A camp was next marked out in the vicinity of Hastings ; outposts were pushed forward to guard against surprise, and the neighbouring villages were plundered and destroyed. The Saxons fled from their dwellings, concealed their goods and cattle, and sought an asylum in the nearest churches; but they soon discovered that the Normans, though professing to be the servants of the Pope, disregarded the sanctity of the most sacred places. 24. King Harold, having repulsed the invasion of Harold Hardrada, was at York refreshing his wearied soldiers, and * Robert of Gloucester. t Roman de Rou. J Some authorities, however, assert that William's ships were blockaded in Pevensey Bay by the Saxon fleet."], [102, "74 BATTLE OF HASTINGS. reposing after his own fatigues, when a bode arrived from the Sussex coast with news of the landing of William the Norman. Without an hour's delay he put his army in motion, and hastened towards the south. \" As he swept onward, he bade the chiefs of the counties summon all their fighting men to arms, and lead them to London as to a general rendezvous. This was his fatal error. Had he remained a few days at York, the new levies would soon have increased his forces to 100,000 men, and ensured him a superiority in the field against which Count William could hardly have contended. But, anxious to spare his subjects from the miseries inflicted by a ruthless soldiery ; desirous, it may be, of surprising the foe by the suddenness of his attack, he moved towards Hastings with the utmost rapidity, though the army which he proposed to defeat was three times more numerous than his own.\" * 25. From the western counties the levies came swiftly to their monarch's aid ; from the northern, on account of the greater distance, they did not make their appearance ; but _ Norman scout sent word to the count that in four days the English forces would amount to 400,000 men. Harold, unfortnnately, did not tarry for the expiration of the four days, though on approaching his enemy, he found him too well prepared for the coup de main he had meditated to be successful. He halted, therefore, at a distance of seven miles from the Norman camp, and suddenly resolving to assume the defensive, began to entrench his position with dykes and palisades. The ruins of Battle Abbey now indicate the spot. It was singularly well chosen. Each flank was protected by impassable morasses and pathless woods, and his army commanded the only pass or road that opened into the heart of England. Had it been stoutly held, the Normans must eventually have fallen back, dispirited, and broken by famine. Harold's reinforcements would have come up, and he might have let loose from his ramparted height an overwhelming army, which would have swept the invaders before it into the sea. 26. Harold's spies, whom he had sent to learn the numbers and dispositions of the enemy's forces, were astounded at the spectacle presented to them, and on their return apprised their king that there were more priests than soldiers in the invading * Adams's Memorable Battles in English History."], [103, "count William's proffer. 75 army; for they had mistaken the close-cropped and smooth shaven Normans for monks. Said Harold, with a calm smile, \"Those whom you have seen in such numbers are not priests, but brave warriors, who will soon show us of what stuff they are made.\" Several of his chiefs advised him to decline a battle, and, ravaging the country on his way, to retreat to London, leaving the Normans to battle with gaunt-eyed famine. \" I !\" exclaimed Harold, \" J ravage the country which has been com mitted to my care. By my faith, it were treason ; and I will rather dare the fortune of battle with the few men I have, trusting to my courage and the goodness of my cause ! \" cj> a o n \u2014 . 27. A monk, named Dom Hugues Maigrot, now arrived from Count William, to propose terms of accommodation. Harold was required either to surrender the crown to his rival, to submit the dispute to the arbitration of the Pope, or refer its decision to the issue of a single combat. Brief was the Saxon's answer : \u2014 \" I will not yield my crown, I will not refer the matter to the Pope, I will not meet Count William in single combat.\" But the astute Norman, anxious to dishonour his rival before his own subjects, again despatched his monkish messenger, and couched his rejoinder in these terms : \u2014 \" Go, and say to Harold, that if he will fulfil the compact he made with me over the holy bones of the saints, I will leave him all the land lying beyond the Humber, and will give his brother Gurth all the land that Godwin held. If he persist in rejecting my conditions, then shalt thou say to him before all his people, that he is a perjurer and a liar ; that he, and all who aid him, are excommunicated by the Pope ; and that the bull of excom munication is in my hands.\" * Dom Hugues Maigrot repeated his lord's message in a solemn tone, and many of the Saxon nobles trembled at the mysterious menace of excommunication. But the true patriot rises superior to every terror, and one of the boldest and loyalest of that bold and loyal band, stepping forward, ex claimed, \"Whatever the perils that beset us, we must fight! It is not now a question of acknowledging a new lord, as if our king were dead, but this is the need and the danger : the Count of Normandy has apportioned our lands to his barons, his knights, and his people, most of whom have already rendered him homage, and will claim their gifts immediately their count * Chronique de Normandie."], [104, "76 BATTLE OF HASTINGS. becomes king. He will be bound to deliver up to them our estates, our wives, and our daughters, for he has already pro mised them. They come, then, not only to ruin us but our descendants, and to deprive us of the heritage of our forefathers. And what are we to do, whither shall we go, when we possess no longer a country of our own ?\" * Courage surely is con tagious. This energetic harangue inspired the timid and con firmed the doubtful, and every Saxon chief straightway swore that he would make neither peace, truce, nor treaty with the invaders, but would either drive them into the sea, or die. 28. In this futile interchange of defiances a whole day had elapsed ; it was the eighteenth since the ships of the Normans first dropped anchor in the bay of Pevensey. Harold's rapid march had, as we have shown, outstript his principal levies, and but small reinforcements had reached his camp. His two brothers-in-law, the great Earls Edwin and Morcar, were hastening upon London, and Leofric, Abbot of Peterborough, and the Abbot of Hide, near .Winchester, had come with their monks and their warriors to pray and fight. \" Would it not be better,\" said. Harold's brothers, Gurth and Leofwin, \" that thou shouldst retire to London, and gather together thy levies, while we fight out this battle ? Thou canst not deny, O Harold, that whether through constraint, or of thine own will, thou hast sworn to Count William an oath upon the relics of saints : why enter the strife with this burden on thy conscience ? for us, who are not forsworn, this war is just ; it is waged in defence of our country. Leave us, then, to fight the battle ; if we retreat thou wilt aid us, and if we die thou wilt avenge us.\" But Harold, confident in his own courage and in his good cause, would not be persuaded from his duty by brotherly love, and began to draw up his troops in martial array .j In their dispo sition he displayed considerable military skill. They occupied the southern range of hills on the ground still known by the name of Battle. Divided into two compact and solid bodies of infantry, their flanks were covered by the horse \u2014 unfortunately too few in number \u2014 and protected by dense woods and danger ous morasses. In front yawned a deep ditch and rose a barrier of palisades. Beyond these was stationed the first division, consisting of the men of Kent, who led the van, and the levies * Roman de Rou, t William of Malmesbury."], [105, "THE EVE OF THE BATTLE. 77 from Essex and Hertfordshire, Sussex and Surrey, Lincolnshire, Somersetshire, Norfolk, and Gloucestershire, drawn up in the shape of a wedge or triangle. Of these the front ranks were clothed in heavy mail, covered by huge shields, and armed with heavy battle-axes. In the rear were arrayed the bowmen, while wherever the nature of the ground afforded a scanty shelter, the most dextrous archers and skilful slingers were posted. 29. The second division formed within the ramparts a seem ingly impenetrable mass. It included the soldiers of London and Middlesex, Harold's own body-guard of veterans, and several companies of well-trained and reliable East Anglians. The heavily armed wore mail and shield like the Normans, and swung the massy battle-axe, the Norseman's favourite weapon. The light-armed were clad in tunics of hide or quilted linen, with helmets of hide, and bore clubs and javelins, swords and spears. In the centre streamed the famous standard of \" The Fighting Man,\" embroidered with gold and adorned with precious stones. Thus arrayed, the Saxons awaited the rush of the oncoming battle, not with alarm and apprehension, indeed, but with the joyous assurance of an easy victory. Had they not clomb the mountain fastnesses of Wales, and compelled the haughty Cwmri to acknowledge their prowess ? Were not their swords still wet with the blood of the Norsemen, and their hearts full of exulta tion at the repulse of the Land-ravager, the Sea-king, Harold Hardrada ? And why should they tremble before the spears of the Normans? These haughty invaders on the morrow would fly before them, and so much of English ground they should have as was needed for their graves. So they passed the night in wassail and song, carousing and playing, dancing and singing. \" Bublie,\" they cried, and \" waeshael, and laticome, and drinchael, and drinc-to-me.\" And ever and anon they pledged each other in flagons of strong beer, and their noisy mirth pierced the still depths of the neighbouring woods. So sings the chronicle:* \" Tote nuit mangierent e burcnt, Unkes la nuit el lit ne jurent. Mult les veissiez demener, Treper e saillir e chanter ; Bublie, crient, e weissel, E laticome e drincheheil, Drinc Hindrewart e Drill tome, Drinc Helf e drinc Tome.\" * Roman de Rou (Wace)."], [106, "78 BATTLE OF HASTINGS. 30. Far differently was spent the eve of battle in the Norman camp. It was reconnoitred (so the annalist tells us) * by Harold and his brothers in disguise : \" Of brave chevaliers took they none, Nor squires a-foot, but went alone ; And all unarm'd was each great lord. Save shield, and spear, and trusty sword.\" And the scene which met their curious eyes was calculated to awaken their most painful apprehensions. The long row of watch-fires blazing before the line of array, indicated the vast numbers of the host gathered under William's standard. \" A broad dyke ran in front of the camp ; and behind, in regular streets or rows, extended the bough -woven huts of the common soldiers. In their rear stood the tents of the knights, and the pavilions of the barons and prelates. The centre was occupied by the splendid pavilion of the leader of this mighty host, before which was unrolled the gon/anon, or banner, blessed by the Pope himself. The steady beat of the sentinels, the clang of the armourers' hammers, the neighing of innumerable horses, all told of busy preparation for the morrow. Suddenly these noises ceased ; a silver bell tinkled upon the night ; from every hut, and tent, and pavilion came forth its inmates, and down through the kneeling ranks paraded a long procession of priests, with censer and with aube, headed by Odo of Bayeux, and Geoffrey, Bishop of Contances, in their splendid pontificals. Then arose the low murmur of confession, and hands were uplifted as in absolution and benediction. Solemn litanies broke in tender music upon the air, and voices round the watch-fires joined in holy psalms. And the excited soldiery vowed that, if God granted to their swords the victory on the morrow, never again upon a Saturday, as long as they lived, would they eat flesh.\" f \" E li Normanz e li Franceiz Tote nuit ferint oreisons, E furent en aflicions.

As slowly dawned the morning of the 14th of Oc tober, the birthday both of Count William and King Harold, * Chronique de Geoffroi Gaimar. t Adams's Memorable Battles. J Reman de Rou."], [107, "WILLIAM AND HIS KNIGHTS. 79 the Norman army quitted its entrenchments, and commenced its stately march along the greensand ridge which trends inland from the cliffs of Hastings. Keeping to the north of the modern village of Hollington, it passed through the leafy glades now enclosed in Crowhurst Park, and halted upon Telham Hill, facing the \"ramparted\" ground of the Saxons.* The sunrise reddens the eastern sky, and a blaring trumpet bids the Nor mans arm. The horsemen, clothed in coats of mail which reach even to the knee, put on their conical helmets, fix their \" prick spurs \" to their heels, seize their kite-shaped shields, covered with many a quaint symbolic fancy, and grasping their heavy swords, or long and ponderous lances, vault nimbly upon their richly-caparisoned steeds. Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, and Wil liam's half brother, a true member of the church militant, now dons a hauberk under his rochet, mounts a large white courser, swings to and fro his formidable mace, and draws up the cavalry in line. And around him gather, all glittering in sheeny armour, the proud Norman barons, the founders of our English chivalry : the gallant William D'Albini, afterwards Earl of Arundel ; the heroic Mowbray ; Robert, Count of Eu, who, in the fight, \" demeaned himself as a brave man, so that those upon whom his blows fell were sorely handled ;\" Robert de Mortaigne, afterwards Earl of Cornwall ; William Fitz- Osbert, the Conqueror's kinsman and most trusted councillor ; the ready and valorous Walter Gifford ; Roger de Mont gomeri; the two brothers Baynard and Gilbert de Montfichet; Hugues de Grantmesnil ; the chivalrous Malet ; Aimery de Thouars, a sturdy Poitevin ; and William de Warrenne, the future Earl of Surrey, \" his helmet sitting gracefully on his head.\" 32. Count William next prepared to arm himself, calling for his coat of mail, which, by some misadventure, his squire handed to him with the wrong side foremost. Observing the gloomy countenances of the knights and nobles in attendance, who looked upon this accident as an omen of the most disastrous character, William Fitz-Osbert blithely cried, that it should rather be regarded as an augury of good fortune, as showing that those circumstances which had hitherto remained unmoved would now acknowledge the count's power. William himself having made the sign of the cross, donned his hauberk with his * Lower's Contributions to Literature."], [108, "80 BATTLE OF HASTINGS. wonted composure, saying \u2014 \" Truly, my friends, I know that I ought not, did I put my trust in omens, to enter the field to-day. But I never had, nor will have, faith in such predictions, but confide in God, who shapes the future according to His will. I love not wizards, I believe not in diviners. Let us imagine that the hauberk turned awry signifies that my duchy will be changed into a kingdom, and king shall he be who but a duke has been.\" * 33. Next, having girded on his sword and laced his helmet, which his valet handed to him, he called for his good steed. Nor better could there anywhere be found than the Spanish barb which Walter Gifford had brought him on his return from a pilgrimage to St. Iago, in Galicia. Taking the reins in his hand, he leapt into the saddle, and seated himself there with so royal a hearing that the Norman chivalry broke into low murmurs of approbation. \" I have never seen,\" exclaimed the Vicomte de Tours, \" a man more admirably armed, nor one who rode so boldly, or bore his armour so well. Never did knight brandish his lance more fairly, or manage his horse with equal skill. No knight like him lives under heaven ! A fair knight he is, and a fair king (beau rei) he shall be. Shame be to those who shall fail him in his need ! \" 34. The Normans were divided into three columns of attack. In the first, marshalled by William Fitz-Osbert and Roger de Montgomeri, rode the horsemen of Boulogne and Picardy, the Rhenish mercenaries, and the men-at-arms of France and Flanders, Burgundy and Aquitaine, attracted to William's banner by the promise of broad lands and good pay. The second, led by Aimery de Thouars, included the auxiliaries from Maine, Brittany, and Poitou. William in person com manded the third, the flower of the Norman knighthood. In the front and on the flanks of each of these bodies were stationed the infantry, lightly armed, wearing quilted coats, and carrying long-bows or cross-bows of steel. 35. Count William now called to his side the gallant Raoul de Conches, the hereditary standard-bearer of Normandy, and offered him the guardianship of the Papal goufanon, or conse crated banner. \" I shall need my right arm,\" said he, \" for my sword; my left for my horse and shield.\" Then he summoned * \" Reis serai ki due ai este.\" \u2014 Roman de Rou, by Wace."], [109, "THE COUNT'S HARANGUE. 81 Gaultier Giffart, Sire de Longueville : \" My head is grey,\" he muttered, \" and my strength enfeebled ; but no one shall serve you more truly in the battle. I will strike with my sword until it is red with the blood of your foes.\" So the sacred standard was finally entrusted to young Toustain le Blanc, who showed himself fully worthy of so splendid a charge.* 36. The troops were all ready for the onset, when William rode forward, and, \"loud as a trumpet with a silver sound,\" his rich clear voice rolled over the serried ranks, who listened in eager silence. : \u2014 \" Knights and soldiers : Remember ye to fight your best, and put every one to death ; for if we conquer, rich shall be each of us ! What I have, you shall have ; if I conquer, you too will conquer ; if I win this land, it shall be yours ! But in all truth, I say that I come not here for my own right alone, but to avenge the felonies, perjuries, and treacheries which this people have put upon our nation. They slaughtered our kins men, the Danes, on the night of St. Brice ; they murdered Alfred, the brother of their last sovereign, and decimated his companions. Behold, then, your enemies ! Felons they were, and felons they are ; false they were, and false they will be ! Never, even in a just cause, were they famous for their warrior blood, or martial glory. On, on ! and with God's help we will chastise them for their evil deeds ! \" And descending into the plain which separated them from the Saxon position, the Normans, with loud shouts of \" Der, aide ! \" advanced to the charge. 37. Onward rolled the rush of the Norman march, sweeping like the slow billows of an incoming sea over the fatal field ot Senlac \u2014 afterwards significantly named Sangue-lac, or the Lake of Blood \u2014 and in advance of the gleaming array rode a strange warrior, a man of more than ordinary stature, the famous Nor man minstrel, Taille-fer, \" Singing aloud a lusty strain, Of Roland and of Charlemain, And Oliver and the heroes all Who fell at bloody Roncesvalles.\"t * William of Toitou.

' Headlong now sped his gallant steed, With jaws so wide the Saxon coward Trembled lest he should be devour'd ; And pressing 'mid his Saxon foes, Two fell beneath those fatal blows.\" * This knightly jongleur, named Taille-fer, or Cut-iron, from his dexterity and strength, slew a Saxon standard-bearer and a Saxon soldier before he himself was overpowered. 38. Thus it was that, at about nine o'clock on the morning of the 14th of October, 1066, the memorable battle of Hastings began. Loud and far resounded the clanging horns and clash ing lances, the heavy thud of the clubs, and the ring of hostile swords. The English, standing firm as a tower, and as if rooted to their native soil, shouted again and again, \" Holy Cross ! Out ! Out ! God Almighty ! \" To which the Normans, though they understood not the meaning of their opponents' cries, responded with \" Dex aie I God help us ! God help us ! \" Onward pressed two divisions of the Norman arm}', attempting to turn the flanks of the Saxon vanguard, and so fall with a sudden swoop upon the reserve within the entrenchments. The archers discharged their arrows, and the cross-bowmen their bolts ; but they fell ineffectually against the lofty palisades of * \" Devant les autres cil se mist, Devant Englois merveilles fist Sa lance prist par le tuet Si com ceo fust un bastonet, Encontre mont halt l'engetta Et par le per receue l'a.

The infantry advanced with their spears, and the horsemen rode hotly up to the gates, endeavouring to force them ; but the Saxons, all on foot, around their standard, beat them back with their heavy battle-axes,* one blow7 of which shivered lance, and cleft through coat of mail. Weary with fruitless efforts, the Normaus at length recoiled, and fell back in sore dismay upon the division commanded by Count William. With brow unclouded, the great leader rode among them, rallied their straggling ranks, and led them again to the assault ; ordering the archers to shoot upward that their arrows might fall ivithin the Saxon ramparts. Many of the English were wounded by this measure, and mostly in the face. 39. William now put into execution a stratagem he had previously meditated, with the view of enticing his enemy from the position which their steady valour made impregnable. He directed his cavalry to charge boldly, and then to feign a hurried retreat ; while Eustace, Count of Boulogne, was ordered to hold himself in readiness to fall upon the Saxons if, misled by the snare, they quitted their redoubts, and scattered in pur suit. It fell out as the astute captain imagined. Heated by the fight, and inflamed beyond all prudence by the hope of a speedy victory, they rushed upon the retreating foe, their axes hanging from their necks, in spite of Harold's efforts to keep them steady in their ranks.j- In the melee which ensued a fearful slaughter took place. A deep ravine, overgrown with grass and brush wood, was concealed in the plain across which the Normans retreated. The Saxons drove them pell-mell upon this chasm, and hurled into it both men and horses. Many were to be seen falling into the dark hollow, rolling one over another, with their faces to the earth, and vainly struggling to recover their feet. Some of them flung their arms around their foes, and with a ter rible embrace dragged them also down to death ; until the ravine was choked up, and made level with the plain, by the number of the unfortunates who found therein a fearful gravej. For long years afterwards survived the tradition of this fell slaughter, and the place where it occurred retained the expressive name of Malfosse, or the Accursed Ditch. 40. A panic seized the hosts of the Norman, and the bruit spread abroad that William, their leader, had perished in the * William of Poitou. t Chronique de Normandie. J Roman de Rou. G 2"], [112, "84 BATTLE OF HASTINGS. Malfosse, and the varlets placed in charge of the tents and stores began to fly. The contagion spread, and the retreat threatened to become a rout. William, throwing back his vizor that all might see his face, and waving his spear in his right hand, flung himself in front of the fugitives, dealing heavy blows among them, and reproaching them lustily : \" What ails ye, ye cowards ? Do ye not see your lord, who will lead you to a certain victory ? Turn, turn, aud strike, for I tell ye the day shall be ours ! \"*\u25a0 Then Bishop Odo also hurried towards them, exclaiming, \" Stand fast, stand fast ! Be calm, and move not ! Fear nothing, for, with the grace of God, we yet shall conquer !\"f The scattered ranks were rallied, and brought again to the charge. The Saxons, disordered by the fury of their pursuit, and pressed in their turn by the Count of Boulogne and his powerful squadrons, were driven within their entrenchments, which Normans and Saxons entered intermingled, and fighting hand to hand. King Harold was sorely wounded by an arrow in the right eye. In his agony, he drew the weapon out, and, breaking it with his hands, flung the pieces aside ; but so intolerable was the pain that, for a moment, he leaned helplessly upon his shield. This accident, perhaps, decided the issue of the battle. At all events, the Saxons were long accustomed to say to the Normans, that the arrow so sent up against their king was well shot, and that the bowman won signal glory for his country who thus put out King Harold's eye. 41. Count William's horse was killed under him ; it was the second steed he had lost that day, and yet he escaped un wounded. So hopeless still continued the position of the Normans, that Eustace of Boulogne advised him to retire his forces as best he could ; it was impossible to make head against the resolution of the English. But William knew that defeat meant total ruin, that with the sea in his rear there could be no safety except in victory, and so the hot fight continued, and the contending masses surged to and fro, like the foam-crested waters on a rocky shore. Those were the days when individual prowess affected the fortunes of a battle, and\" the magic of dis cipline was as yet unknown. The deeds of a knight were marked by many eyes, and singled out for the poet's approba tion, instead of the valour of the few being but as an unit in the * Benoit de St. Maure. f Roman de Rou."], [113, "DEEDS OF DARING. 85 aggregate courage of the many. Thus the old chroniclers tell us of a Saxon thegn who rushed impetuously forward, heading his own company of a hundred men, each provided with a different weapon. He himself wielded an axe, whose blade was full a foot in length, and where the throng was thickest \u2014 \" La a Normanz plus espez sont, En vint saillant plus tost ke cers \" \u2014 * eaped forward swifter than a stag, tracking his path by dead and wounded Normans. Rushing against a knight who bestrode his war-horse gallantly, he delivered a blow at his head with his trenchant axe, but it slipped aside, and the keen steel shore full through the horse's neck, bringing both horse and rider to the earth. The Normans who beheld the shock were so abashed that they relinquished the assault, when Roger de Montgomeri, with poised lance, rode hastily to the spot, and, little heeding the Saxon's long-handled axe, smote him so lusty a blow- that he fell dead. Then cried the Montgomery, \" Normans, strike '. the day is ours ! \" and again the warriors mingled in the press, with push of lance and stroke of sword. 42. There was a Saxon who notably distinguished himself by the carnage he made among the Normans. His wooden helmet was so laced around his neck that no blows could reach his head, and while with his sharp axe he dealt death and wounds around him, he seemed himself to bear a charmed life. The slaughter he made was espied by a brave Norman knight, who rode a steed that \" neither fire nor water could check in his course, when once his rider spurred him on\" \u2014 \" Eau ne feu nel' retenist, Se li sire bien le poinsist.\" Charging full upon the Saxon, he smote him across his helmet, so that it should fall over his eyes; and then, as he lifted up his right hand to raise it from his face, struck off his hand, which immediately fell on the ground. A Norman leapt forward, and stooping, seized the Saxon's axe ; he held it but a little while, and paid dearly for it ; for even as he stooped, a soldier smote him on the shoulders with such force that his bones were broken, and his lungs and entrails driven through the frightful wound. i;\" Roman de Rou, by Wace."], [114, "86 BATTLE OF HASTINGS. The knight and his war-horse had, in the meantime, regained his men uninjured ; and meeting, face to face, another foe, rode him down, trampling him under his horse's hoofs, so that he was grievously wounded. 43. Twenty of the bravest knights of Normandy now pledged themselves to carry off the Saxon banner of \" The Fighting Man,\" or die in the attempt. They clove a way through the throng, in spite of the doughtiest resistance, and though many of them were stricken down, the others slew the standard bearers, and bore away the royal standard. Then in its place streamed abroad the consecrated gonfanon of the Pope : the signal of defeat to the Saxons. The cavalry of Boulobe and Poitou once more crushed resistlessly upon their thinned and weary ranks, and swept over them like a cloud of fire across an American prairie. Harold had stood by his standard defiantly, until an armed man, in the medley of the battle, contrived to dealhim, already bleeding' with many wounds, a heavy stroke upon his helmet, which bore him to the earth ; and as he sought to recover himself, another beat him down again, and struck him on the thigh, even to the very bone. Thus perished the hero Harold, worthier of a better fate, and by his side fell his gallant brothers, Gurth and Leofwin,* while around them was heaped a circle of the dead and dying. \" The best and bravest of the Saxon chivalry perished with their monarch, and none remained to direct the battle, to rally the fugitives, or encourage the few who still kept their ground. Yet far into the darkness of the fight, when the combatants could only distinguish friend from foe by the difference of their speech, the fight was prolonged ; and never was Saxon valour more illustrious than on the fatal field of Hastings ! \" 44. Under the cover of the friendly night the dispirited Saxons dispersed over the surrounding country, many dying on the roads of their wounds, and others falling before the merci less pursuit of the Norman horse. The victors passed the night on the field they had so dearly won, William's tent being pitched amidst the bodies of the slain, and thither his meat was brought, and there his supper was made ready. And he vowed to build on the spot, distinguished by so splendid a triumph, a stately abbey, dedicated to the Holy Trinity and St. Martin, * According to the Roman de Rou, Gurth was slain by William himself."], [115, "THE LAKE OF BLOOD. 87 the patron of the warriors of Gaul.* His knights and nobles gathered round, extolling his valour, and rejoicing in the spoil of conquered England. \" And he stood among them, a man of lofty stature and noble mien, and, with the pious hypocrisy of the age, rendered thanks to the Lord of Hosts, through whom he had gained the fight. Mourning and weeping for the lost, he thanked his knights for their brilliant valour ; and he ate and drank among the dead, and slept that night upon the field.\" 45. The morrow rose on a scene which the Normans might well distinguish as Sangue-lac (the Lake of Blood). The plain was heaped with dead bodies, and from the dells around trickled a purple stream, which, as it rolled onward, swelled into a river of gore. The peasant long believed that the ruddy chalybeate sources of the little brook still rippling across the battle-field derived their peculiar hue from the blood of the slaughtered Saxons. Drayton, iu his \" Polyolbion,\" preserves the tra dition : \u2014 \" Asten once distained with native English blood ; Whose soil yet, when but wet with any little rain, Doth blush, as put in mind of those there sadly slain.\" At sunrise, Count William drew up his army, and caused the roll to be read of those who had crossed the sea with him from St. Valery. It is said that the Norman dead numbered three thousand ; the Saxons must have lost full twice three thousand. Heaps of their slain were piled around, and their spoils were the first fruits of the battle of Hastings. Among them thirteen were found with a monk's habit under theirarmour\u2014 the Abbot of Hide and his twelve brethren, who had fought and bled, like true patriots, rather than the trembling servants of an arbitrary church. 46. While Odo of Bayeux, casting aside his weapons, chanted mass for the souls of the departed, the Normans hastily buried the bodies of their comrades ; and Saxon women, who had come * William's vow was speedily accomplished, and the high altar of the new monas tery was raised on the very spot where the standard of \" The Fighting Man \" had been planted and torn down. The outer walls were traced about the hill where the battle had most fiercely rolled to and fro, and the whole extent of the adjacent land which had been the scene of the eddying tumult, became the property of this abbey, which was called, in the Norman language, L'Abbaye de la Bataille. A colony of monks from the great convent of Marmontiers, near Tours, was settled here ; and these were required to pray for the souls of all who had died on the field. \u2014 Dugdale, Monasticon Anglicanum."], [116, "88 BATTLE OF HASTINGS. in search of husband, son, or brother, were suffered to remove the corpses from the field, and inter them iu the graveyards of the neighbouring village churches. Those whom no loving eyes had recognised \u2014 and so mutilated were the bodies that recognition was often difficult \u2014 were left to rot where they had fallen, or be devoured by \" worms, and wolves, and birds, and dogs.\" The body of Harold could not be identified until the two monks of Waltham Abbey, Osgood and Ailred, the \" childe maister,\" who had undertaken the search, called to their aid the beautiful Editha Swanneshales, or the \" Swan-necked,\" Harold's beloved mistress. The disfigured corpse was then wrapped in purple linen, and buried, by the Conqueror's command, upon the cliff of Hastings. Fain would Githa, his mother, have ran somed the dead. \" I have lost three of my sons in this fight,\" she said ; \" return to me the bones of but one, and I will pay you for them, weight by weight, in pure gold.\" The Conqueror sternly replied that he through whose ambition so many had perished, and now lay unburied, was himself unworthy of a grave. So Harold was buried on the breezy cliff, where the winds and the complaining seas breathe an eternal dirge ; and a stone placed over his remains loug bore the Norman's taunt, which a later age consents to understand as the fitting epitaph of the Last of the Saxon Kings : \u2014 \" Per mandata Ducis, rex hie Heralde, quiescas, LTt custos maneas littoris et pelagi.\"* English. By the Duke's will thou restest here, to be, 0 Harold ! guardian of the shore and sea. 47. The conquest of England was the necessary result of the. battle of Hastings. The pacific habits of Edward's court had affected the martial tastes of the Saxon people. Harold's death had deprived them of a leader, and without a supreme authority no nation can carry on a successftd insurrection, or repel a for midable invasion. There existed no strongholds where an army might be reorganised, .or a defence protracted. Its best soldiers, and especially those who had been trained in Harold's campaigns, fell on the field of Sangue-lac. A few towns, indeed, offered a gallant resistance, and in some isolated places Saxon heroism long withstood Norman ferocity, but the bulk of England * William of Poitou. See also, Ordericus Vitalis."], [117, "89 EFFECTS OF THE CONQUEST. became the virtual booty of the Conqueror in one pitched battle. And soon, over the breadth and length of the fair land, rolled the wave of conquest, effacing most of the ancient landmarks, and sweeping away the olden boundaries. The memorials which remain do but attest the completeness of the devastation, as the broken shafts and mouldering friezes which rise above the sands of the desert do but show how utterly the glory of the past has vanished. The country was portioned out among the principal Norman captains, and the feudal system rose in all its grim and severe majesty upon the wrecks of the Saxon dominion. A code of laws was introduced, which gave all to the oppressor and nothing to the oppressed. Strong fortalices towered in every point of vantage, which at first enabled the barons to keep down the commons, and afterwards to defy the king. The independence of the Saxon ecclesiastics was imme diately crushed, and Rome flung her fetters over the shuddering land.* 48. Such were the important results to England of the Nor man Conquest ; nor was its influence upon European history less signal or less momentous. The European system may properly be said to date its origin from 1066. The conquest of England by the Normans implied the consolidation of the power of France, which, from this time, began to assume, gradually but surely, a supremacy upon the continent that she still retains. The infu sion of Norman blood into Saxon veins begat the adventurous English nation, destined to become the counterpoise of France, and the great anti-Papal power, for England was anti-Roman before it became Protestant. And it may justly be said that much as the Saxons owed to the Normans, the Normans owed more to the Saxons, and derived from them that solidity of thought and impatience of tyranny which led them to break off the papal bonds imposed by William the Conqueror. 49. The subjugation of England by the Normans is further notable as \" the last territorial conquest that has been effected in the western portion of Europe.\" Those which have been achieved since that epoch have been political ; countries have been annexed to other countries, and their laws and systems of government have undergone a complete revolution ; but the conquerors have not settled themselves and their families in the * Thierry's Norman Conquest (Cinquitc d'Anglderre par les Normans) liv. vi."], [118, "90 BATTLE OF HASTINGS. conquered territory, and no fusion or amalgamation of races has occurred. Poland is still in heart and soul antagonistic to Russia. The Germans of Schleswig Holstein have never mingled thoroughly with the Danes. The Venetians are as alien from their Austrian governors in the nineteenth as in the sixteenth century. But the Normans settled themselves in the very heart of England, and imposed upon the conquered their laws, religious system, feudal polity, military discipline, and even their language. For two centuries the two races main tained antagonistic relations, until, in the reign of Henry the Third, a common enemy united them by ties of mutual interest, and that amalgamation took place which has produced the great English people. But traces of the signal victory which broke the Saxon power on the field of Hastings still present themselves to the observant eye, and still between the governors and the governed exists something of that distrust engendered by years of oppression on the one part, and suffering on the other. That the fusion has been so complete is due to two great influences \u2014 the liberation of the English Church from the suzerainty of Rome, and the levelling tendencies of commercial enterprise, which enables the son of the serf to inherit vast domains, and purchase a place among the territorial aristocracy of the nation."], [119, "CHRONOLOGICAL LINKS BETWEEN THE NORMAN CONCIUEST AND THE COUNCIL OF CLERMONT.

Chron. Baldric. 1. Those remarkable popular movements which history commemorates as the Crusades, originated in the bold and criminal ambition of one man. Hildebrand, afterwards Pope Gregory VII., was born at Soano, in Tuscany, of mean parentage. Displaying at an early age habits of meditation and a love of letters, he was devoted to the service of the Church, and became a monk in the convent of Clugni. Here the asceticism of his life, the earnestness of his devotion, his mastery of abstruse theological erudition, his rigid adherence to monastic canons, gained him a great reputa tion, and it was felt that so shining a light should be fixed at Rome, the Eternal City, as from thence best able to illuminate the whole of Christendom. Thither he repaired with Bruno, Bishop of Toul, and speedily acquired an influence so profound and universal, that his decrees virtually swayed the Church, and he obtained the election of his patron as Pope, under the title of Alexander II. Henceforth he became the actual sove reign of Christendom, though heseemedto shin e with a borrowed lustre, and the Pope had but little choice to do aught else than register and confirm his edicts. The power of the earnestness and enthusiasm which glowed deeply and steadily in the heart"], [121, "93 HILDEBRAND THE GREAT, of this extraordinary priest was soon acknowledged. A man of comprehensive intellect and profound sagacity, if animated by a single idea, becomes a potent agent for good or evil, accord ing as his idea is good or evil, in a world which is swayed by every gust of feeling and current of passion. \u2022 He bends all to his will ; he communicates to many the contagion of his own enthusiasm ; he overrides the doubts of others by the startling energy of his character. Hildebrand was thus inspired by a grand ambition \u2014 to subjugate the temporal power to the eccle siastical; to bind kings and princes to the altar as the humble vassals of the Church ; to render the papal tiara superior to all the crowns of Christendom. For this purpose he laboured with the most singular self-abnegation and the most entire devotion. Enjoying the power, he was content to leave to others the splen - dour, of the pontifical throne, until his designs were thoroughly matured. But while Leo IX., Victor II. , Stephen IX., Nicho las II. , and Alexander II. wore the tiara, Hildebrand directed their movements and animated their councils. The world was shaken by his influence, though it knew not from whence that influence came. 2. To carry out his bold design, it was necessary in the first place to reform the lives of the clergy, and renew the attach ment and reverence of the laity to their spiritual guides. As Archdeacon of Rome, he persuaded Stephen II. to order that every married priest should lose his benefice and be separated from his wife, and excited the passions of the fanatic against the libidinous clergy who violated the rules of celibacy. He knew that the crowd retained a superstitious veneration for the sup posed sanctity of the single life of the cloister. He knew also that the priest whose natural affections were crushed and trodden down, whose mind and heart were unoccupied by images of domestic happiness, uninfluenced by the love of wife and child, was constrained to find in his Church an object for his pent-up feelings, and concentrate all his energies to the promotion of its interests. Having thus secured the unlimited obedience of the monastic orders, and checked the irregularities which had weakened their hold upon the affections of the people, he thought the time had arrived for him to throw aside the mask of humility he had worn so long and so patiently,'and to assume in public the power he had exercised in secret. On the death"], [122, "94 COUNCIL OF CLERMONT. of Alexander II. in 1073, he contrived to be elected to the papal throne \u2014 to that holy and splendid seat which he had deter mined to elevate above all the secular thrones of the civilised world. But to ward off suspicion from his ambitious projects, he refused to receive his title until approved of by Henry IV., Emperor of Germany. That approval was readily granted by a monarch who had no suspicion that he w~as confirming the election of a priest bent upon the humiliation of the temporal power, and Hildebrand assumed the title of Pope Gregory VII. No sooner w7as the triple crown firmly set upon his brow than he plunged into open war. The vices which befouled the lives both of the Emperor Henry and Philip of France rendered them especially vulnerable to his attack, and he knew that the popular feeling would support him against their anger. The emperor was a profligate encourager of the most disgraceful simony, openly giving or selling sees to his favourites. He also claimed, as all the successors of Charlemagne had claimed, the appointment of the bishops and Church dignitaries in his states, by the delivery into their hands of the ring and crozier. Gregory opened upon him the fierce artillery of his indignation. He addressed him an insolent letter, burning with fiery eloquence, in which he bade him abandon his simonaical practices, and renounce the right of investiture by ring and cross. These, he declared, were the symbols of spiritual dignity which only the Pope could lawfully bestow. Henry at first was transported with rage at the audacity of the pontiff, and prepared to resent it. But Gregory had chosen an admirable time for his message, and had felt his ground carefully before delivering it. The emperor's vices had excited the contempt and anger of his sub jects. In Italy his authority was set at nought by the Normans and the Countess Matilda. In his own states a dangerous con spiracy was fomented by the Dukes of Suabia and Carinthia. He was engaged in a perilous struggle with the Saxons and Thuringians. He was forced to yield; but in a short time, having quelled the revolt which threatened the safety of his throne, he began again to nominate to German and even Italian bishoprics, in open defiance of the papal decrees. Gregory now fulminated against him the sentence of excommunication, released his subjects from their fealty, and declared him deprived of the imperial crown. The emperor found himself almost alone in"], [123, "AN EMPEROR'S PENANCE. 95 his own dominions. The Germans were delighted at the papal sanction afforded to their rebellion, a sanction which they con sidered justly demanded by their ruler's tyrannical conduct and profligate life. He deserved censure, for he had broken his compact with his people. \" Ergo,\" says a contemporary.* \" et absque sedis apostolic\u00e6 judicio principes eum pro rege merito refutare possent, cum fractum adimplere contempserit, quod iis pro electione sua promiserat ; quo non adimpleto, nee rex esse poterat.\" But many of the German ecclesiastics resented this stretch of the papal prerogative, and Henry found little diffi culty in convoking a council of nobles and prelates at Worms (a.d. 1076), and obtaining from them a sentence of deprivation against the Pope. Unhappily for him, the great body of his subjects were opposed to his interests and insensible to their own, and soon there arose about him so violent a storm that he was fain to submit to it. Treasonable revolt was glad to assume the disguise of religious fervour, and Henry found himself con fronted by a formidable insurrection. He crossed the Alps to humble himself before the Pope. It was the depth of winter, and of a winter of extraordinary severity. Gregory was residing at the castle of Canossa, near Reggio, a stronghold belonging to the Empress Matilda. Henry was admitted, without his guards, into the courtyard, and there detained for three suc cessive days, from morning till evening, in a woollen shirt, and barefooted, until the successor of St. Peter would deign to admit him into his presence. On the fourth day he received absolu tion, but the inexorable Pope bound him to appear on a certain day to hear his decision whether he should reign or no, and forbade him to use the insignia of royalty until that decision was pronounced (a.d. 1077). 3. The rigour of Gregory's conduct, however, produced a reaction in Henry's favour ; and finding supporters in many of his priests and nobles he broke off his treaty with the Pope, and prepared to assert his imperial authority. The rebellious princes of Germany had chosen another emperor, Rodolph of Suabia, upon whom Gregory now bestowed the crown, with a Latin verse which imported that he received it from St. Peter : \u2014 \" Petra dedit Petro, Petrus diadema Rodolpho.\" * Quoted by Muratori, Script. Italic. Rerum."], [124, "96 COUNCIL OF CLERMONT. Henry marched against him ; defeated him ; and acting with unprecedented vigour, led his troops into Italy. The Countess Matilda came to the aid of the Holy Father, but her forces underwent several defeats. Summoning another Diet, Henry declared the Pope deposed, and appointed Guibert, Archbishop of Ravenna, as his successor, under the name of Clement III. Then he marched upon Rome, but was harassed successfully by the predatory bands of Robert Guiscard, the Morman conqueror of Apulia and Sicily, whom Gregory had attached to his cause by liberal donations. In vain the imperial spears threatened the Eternal City in 1082, and again in 1083, but on the 21st of March, 1084, the Romans resenting the arrogance of their ruler, threw open the gates and invited him to enter. His soldiery then occupied the Lateran, the bridges, and other important posts, while Gregory, still indomitable and uncon quered, retired into the castle of San Angelo. On Palm Sunday the Anti-Pope Guibert was consecrated by several bishops, and on Easter Sunday Henry IV. was publicly crowned as emperor in St. Peter's Church. After the ceremony he ascended the Capitol, and received the acclamations of the people. But the approach of the Norman Guiscard compelled him to retire into Tuscany ; and the fierce Normans broke into the holy city under the pretence of delivering Gregory, and swept its streets with fire and sword, plundering its palaces and churches, and subjecting its inhabitants to the wildest outrages, selling thousands of them as slaves, and giving up half the city to the flames. Out of this terrible desolation the uncon querable Gregory was conducted by his Norman guard to Salerno. Assembling another council, he excommunicated Henry and the Anti-Pope Guibert ; but his schemes of am bition and revenge were suddenly terminated by his death in the year 1085. 4. Hildebrand may justly be regarded as the founder of the temporal power of the Church of Rome. But as his arrogance was without parallel, so his ambition was without limit. He prosecuted his designs in open contempt of the liberties of nations and the dignities of princes. \" There is but one name in the world,\" he exclaimed, \" and that is the Pope's. He only can use the ornaments of empire. All princes, ought to kiss his feet. It is for him alone to nominate or displace bishops, and"], [125, "97 CHARACTER OF GREGORY VII. assemble or dissolve councils. No living man can be his judge. His mere election constitutes him a saint. He has never erred, he never will err in the time to come. He can depose sove reigns, and release subjects from their oaths of fidelity!\" These seem to our calmer minds the pretensions of madness rather than the conclusions of genius, but their very extravagance awed and influenced the most unquiet spirits of the eleventh century. Philip I. of France having connived at the plunder of some Italian merchants, he threatened him with an interdict, and even with a sentence of deposition. He declared that the kingdom of Spain was an inalienable possession of St. Peter, and reprimanded the King of Hungary for having done homage to the emperor in violation of the rights of the Church of Rome. He wTas not less imperious towards his own ecclesi astical subjects. To destroy the independence of the national churches, and submit them all to the despotism of the papacy, he forbade every Catholic bishop from exercising his authority until he had received the confirmation of the Holy See. Metro politans he compelled to visit Rome to receive the pallium. By means of his legates he maintained a perpetual control over the ecclesiastical affairs of every Christian country. 5. One, indeed, is astonished at the grandeur and magnitude of this man's conceptions. He aimed at the establishment of an empire in whose surpassing lustre the empires of Alexander or Charlemagne must have paled their ineffectual fires. The souls and bodies of men were to lie, bound and fettered, at the feet of the Roman pontiff. The sovereignty of nations and the remission of sins were equally to be received from his hands, and aspiring intellect and expanding genius absorbed into the wide spread and ever-increasing dominion of the Church. It would be unfair, however, not to admit that his bold opposition to the licentiousness of wealthy prelates and the tyranny of powerful nobles wrought great good for the commonalty. Every blow aimed at the insolence of kings was a stroke struck in favour of peasant and serf. He was their champion, sprung of them, nurtured among them, and he found \" a satisfaction, sweetened by revenge, in bringing low the haughty looks of the proud.\" 6. An intellect so sagacious and so penetrating had not failed to read aright the characteristics of his age. He had marked the growing independence of thought among the nations, and H"], [126, "98 COUNCIL Of CLERMONT. he was aware that the very passions on which he relied in his chastisement of emperors and princes might be directed against the pretensions of the papal see if not otherwise employed. He did not attempt to withstand, but to turn into another channel, the gathering waters. He did not attempt to resist, but guide, the popular movement. The cruelties of the Saracens towards the pilgrims to the Holy Sepulchre afforded him an opportunity. Their gradual advance towards the frontiers of Christendom was a justifiable cause of alarm. The Greek emperor, Michael, applied to him for help, and Gregory conceived the idea of letting loose the pent-up enthusiasm of Europe upon pagan Asia. He saw that an enterprise so grand and so holy, con ducted under the papal auspices, could not fail to increase the power and the authority of the Church. Therefore, in 1074, he called upon the soldiers of the Cross to take up arms against the enemies of their faith. Fifty thousand fanatics responded to his call, and demanded that he should place himself at their head. \" Si me possunt,\" he wrote, \" in expeditione pro duce et pontifico habere, armata manu volunt in inimicos Dei insur gere et ad sepulchrum Domini ipso ducente pervenire . . .\" (\" If they can have me for their general and priest, they desire to lift the armed hand against the enemies of God, and to reach the Sepulchre of the Lord.\") But the contests in which he was involved with the emperor prevented the fulfilment of this design. 7. His successor, Urban II. , modelled his policy closely upon that of Gregory's, and took up, w-ith astonishing vigour and surprising ability, his unfinished schemes. He looked around him for a suitable instrument, and found one at his hand in the Enthusiast of Picardy, Peter the Hermit. This remarkable fanatic had visited the Holy Sepulchre as a pilgrim about twenty years after the conquest of Jerusalem by the Saracens. He was a native of Amiens, of good birth and lineage, who had served in battle under the Counts of Boulogne, but being naturally of a gloomy and ascetic disposition had soon relinquished the service of the sword for that of the Cross. He entered a con vent, but its privacy did not satisfy his desires. He retired into a hermitage, and fasting and solitude produced their natural effect upon a morose disposition. He dreamed dreams and saw visions, and was inspired at last to undertake a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Upon a spirit like this the narratives of sufferings"], [127, "PETER THE HERMIT. 99 endured by other pilgrims, exaggerated though they were, had a powerful influence. His sympathies were awakened ; the depths of his soul were stirred. He asked the patriarch of Jerusalem if no help could be obtained from the emperors of Constantinople, and when the patriarch replied by an exposure of their vices and follies, he exclaimed, \" I will rouse the martial nations of Europe in your cause.\" With letters of credit and petitions for assistance he returned to Europe, and hastened to tell his sorrowful tale to the Roman pontiff. Urban II. received him in transport. Here was the instrument he needed ; an enthusiast who believed the tale he told, a fanatic whose zeal was incapable of check or obstruction. Urban accordingly dis tinguished him with special favour, and affected to believe him inspired of heaven. He praised the design he had conceived ; he promised to call a General Council for its support; and com missioned him to preach through the length and breadth of Europe the glorious enterprise of delivering the Holy Land from the oppression of the Saracens. 8. Thus encouraged, the Hermit cheerfully proceeded on his arduous task. Though small in stature, and of a contemptible appearance, he was well fitted to excite and impress a great assemblage, for his eye was keen and lively, and his speech flowing and enthusiastic. He was gifted by nature with that rude, rough eloquence, which, seeming to spring from the heart, appeals so directly to the hearts of the multitude. In other respects he was admirably adapted for a popular agitator in the eleventh century. His diet was abstemious, his prayers long and fervent, and the alms which he received with one hand he distributed with the other. His head was bare, his feet naked, his meagre body was wrapped in a coarse garment. He bore and displayed a weighty crucifix ; and the ass on which he rode was sanctified in the public eye by the service of the Man ot' God. So he traversed Italy and France with impatient feet. He entered palace and cottage, addressed baron and peasant, with equal confidence. Everywhere he preached a Holy War, promising absolution to the sinner, plunder to the soldier, glory to the ambitious noble. Eyes grew wet with tears, cheeks pale with indignation, as he recited the sufferings of the natives and pilgrims of Palestine. Hearts throbbed with emotion as he described the Sepulchre of the Saviour and the holy places of H 2"], [128, "100 COUNCIL OF CLERMONT. Jerusalem. The Mount of Olives, he said, and the Garden of Gethsemane\u2014 sacred to all eternity as the scene of the agony of Christ \u2014 were polluted by the abominations of Mahomet. Plow long would so great a shame be suffered? Infidels lavished their contempt on the relics of the saints and the bones of the martyrs ! How long would so dire an evil be endured ? Had they committed sins the most grievous ? Let them gird on their armour, and make their way to Palestine. In the blood of Saracens their crimes should assuredly be washed out ! Did they long for fame ? What fame so glorious as that of the Warrior of the Cross who rescued Christ's sepulchre from the Paynim ? Thus he enlisted in this holy war the passions of every class. He called to his aid the greed of gold and the frenzy of fanaticism. He declared that his mission was from on high ; that in his visions the Saviour appeared to him, and the Virgin-Mother, and the army of martyrs \u2014 the glorious company of the Apostles \u2014 all encouraging him to persevere in his labour of pious love. Superstition and faith, ignorance and learning \u2014 the noble, the knight, the peasant \u2014 the prelate and the monk \u2014 obeyed the call of this new prophet, and prepared to sw7eep the accursed Moslem from off the very face of the earth. 9. Urban now considered the moment had arrived for the Church to undertake the direction of the Crusade it had secretly organised. Though engaged in a harassing contest with Gui bert of Ravenna, the anti-pope, who occupied and garrisoned the larger portion of Rome, his influence was so weighty, and he himself so popular, that the council which he summoned at Placentia was attended by two hundred prelates, four thousand monks and priests, and thirty thousand of the laity. They met in an open space outside the city, and held a session which lasted seven days. Here were introduced the ambassadors of the Greek emperor, Alexius Comnenus, who besought them to come to his aid. Constantinople, they said, was separated from the Moslems by only a narrow strait. Once the city of the great Constantine was captured, the bulwark of Christendom, what was to hinder them from pouring their victorious hordes into Germany, until the battle of the Cross might have to be fought on the banks of the Rhine ? The pride of the Latin princes was flattered by this appeal ; the sympathies of the multitude were touched by the sufferings of their fellow-Christians ; and the Greek ambassadors"], [129, "THE CITY OF THE BEAUTIFUL MOUNT. 101 took their leave with the assurance of a speedy and powerful succour. The assembly, in the violence of its emotions, would at once have declared the Crusade, but Urban adjourned the final decision to a second synod, which he undertook to convene in some city of France in the autumn of the same year. In this delay he had two objects in view : that the flame he had kindled might spread throughout all Europe, and that the meeting of the council in France might awaken the enthusiasm of the French, his gallant countrymen. \" A latent motive of affection or vanity,\" says Gibbon, \" might influence the choice of Urban; he was himself a native of France, a monk of Clugny, and the first of his countrymen who ascended the throne of St. Peter. The pope had illustrated his family and province ; nor is there perhaps a more exquisite gratification than to revisit, in a conspicuous dignity, the humble and laborious scene of our youth.\" 10. Upon a considerable eminence, rising above a mountain torrent which forms one of the tributaries of the Allier, and at the gate or opening of a vast semicircular plateau which, on every side but the east, is bounded by a wall of lofty hills, whose sides are hung with leafy woods and purple vineyards, clusters, in many irregular lava-coloured streets, the ancient town of Clermont, famous as the seat of the great council which decreed the First Crusade, and not less famous as the birthplace of the illustrious Pascal, whose \" Provincial Letters \" were directed against the power by which that Crusade had been organised. In the neighbourhood spreads the battle-plain of Gorgovia, where the Gauls under Vercingtjtorix compelled C\u00e6sar to retire. Its cathedral is of later date (a.d. 1248) than the great council, but the church of N6tre-Dame-du-Pont must have risen upon the admiring gaze of the thousands whom the echoes of the Holy War then summoned thither, and whose battle-cry, \" God wills it ! \" surged, in fierce tides of sound, far away into the depths of the distant hills. 11. Pope Urban convened his council in this City of the Beautiful Mountain, in November, 1095. For this preparatory scene in the great drama the consummate actor had arranged every detail, and preliminary meetings of ecclesiastics were held at Vercelli and other places, to stimulate their enthusiasm or excite their fears. He drew thither the principal French"], [130, "102 COUNCIL OF CLERMONT. nobles in spite of the resentment of Philip, and from all parts of Europe came motley groups of nobles and prelates, knights and men-at-arms. Attended by his court and the Roman cardinals, Urban sat enthroned above a restless sea of human life, whose waves rolled hither and thither under the common influence of a deep emotion. Thirteen archbishops, two hundred and twenty five bishops, four hundred mitred prelates, lords, and knights, and squires, men-at-arms and bowmen, burgher and peasant \u2014 every grade of society was represented on the bill of Clermont. It was the month of November, and a murky sky frowned upon a leafless earth, yet thousands dwelt in tents or rudely-con structed huts in the open field The session for eight days was occupied in useful measures designed to appease the civil dis cords of Europe, that its strength might be the better directed against pagan Asia. The license of private war, in which every feudal chief indulged, was severely censured ; the Treva Dei, or Truce of God, a general but temporary pacification, was ordained during four days of the week ; the protection of the Church was solemnly extended to women and priests ; and husbandmen and peasants for three years were endowed with an immunity from the evils of military rapine. These measures discussed and confirmed, the ninth day came ; and Urban, clad in all the splendour of full pontificals, ascended a lofty scaffold, erected in the market-place of Clermont, and prepared to address the vast multitude which heaved and tossed beneath. He told them, in well-chosen language, of the cruelties inflicted upon Christian pilgrims. He reminded them of the sanctity of Jerusalem, of the traditions of Mount Olivet, of the unutterable mystery of the Garden of Gethsemane, the sacred awe of the Holy Sepulchre, the imperishable fame of Calvary and the Cross; and yet these holy places were defiled by pagan infidels! He proposed to them the deliverance of Palestine from its heathen conquerors, and held out the rewards of heaven to all who engaged in a war so glorious and of such abundant promise. Those who were within hearing of the Pope's stately eloquence, transported beyond themselves by a variety of passions, shouted with a mighty voice, \" Dens vxdt! Diex el volt! God wills it! God wills it!\" A contagion of enthusiasm spread through the excited multitude. The cry of \"God wills it!\" caught up by one after another, resounded through the streets of Clermont, and, swelled by the"], [131, "103 TOE WARRIORS OF THE CROSS. voices of the thousands gathered on the tented plain, rolled onward until lost among the far-off forest. 12. \"God wills it!\" exclaimed the Pope, \" and let these memorable words, the inspiration surely of the Holy Spirit, be for ever adopted as your battle-cry, to arouse the devotion and kindle the courage of the warriors of the Cross. That Cross is the symbol of your salvation ; wear it \u2014 a red, a blood-red Cross \u2014 an outward mark upon your breasts or shoulders of the sacred and unalterable engagement you have this day under taken !\" As soon as he had finished, numbers of the prelates pressed forward, and on their knees begged his permission to serve in the Crusade. The well-designed artifice had its effect. Nobles, knights, and men-at-arms, prostrating themselves, took the solemn vow. A cardinal, in the name of all, made confes sion of their sins ; and Urban, with outstretched arms, pro nounced a general absolution. Then the shades of the November night rapidly gathering over the dusky hills, the excited multi tude dispersed, and the Council of Clermont, having made its mark for mighty good and evil upon the history of the world, was at an end.* 13. To inflame the warlike enthusiasm of Christendom the Church now opened the entire treasury of its rewards. The glories of martyrdom were promised to all who fell in the war : absolved from sin, they would at once be received into the joys of Paradise. The remission of penance was liberally ordered, and the Crusaders were freed from those ascetic restrictions and enforcements of self-denial by which superstition mortifies the body to punish the guilty soul. False miracles, the prophecies of fanatics, the wild ravings of pseudo-saints, contributed to maintain a singular excitement of feeling throughout Europe. It is impossible to doubt but that thousands were actuated by religious zeal, by the sense of duty and high service implied in the words of battle, \" God wills it ! \" But, as Hallam remarks, these devotional feelings, usually thwarted and balanced by other * Urban was solicited to head the Crusade, but prudently declined. Such a mission would have been inconsistent with his ambitious schemes. He appointed as his legate, Adhemar, Bishop of Puys, the first who received the Cross from his hands. The ambassadors of Raymond, Count of Thoulouse, were foremost in pledging their master's honour in support of the enterprise. The warriors of the Cross were then dismissed, the day of their departure for the Holy Land being fixed for the Festival of the Assumption, August 15, 1096."], [132, "104 COUNCIL OF CLERMONT. passions, \"fell in with every motive that could influence the men of that time \u2014 with curiosity, restlessness, the love of license, thirst for war, emulation, ambition.\" Worldly motives will, in every great popular movement, work to the surface amid the stir of purer and holier sentiments, and the image of gold has too often its feet of clay. \" Of the princes who assumed the Cross, some probably from the beginning speculated upon forming independent establishments in the East. In later periods the temporal benefits of undertaking a crusade un doubtedly blended themselves with less selfish considerations. Men resorted to Palestine, as in modern times they have done to the colonies, in order to redeem their fame or repair their fortune. Thus Gui de Lusignan, after flying from France for murder, was ultimately raised to the throne of Jerusalem. To the more vulgar class were held out inducements which, though absorbed in the overruling fanaticism of the First Crusade, might be exceedingly efficacious when it began rather to flag. During the time that a Crusader bore the Cross he was free from suit for his debts, and the interest of them was entirely abolished ; he was exempted, in some instances at least, from taxes, and placed under the protection of the Church, so that he could not be impleaded in any civil court, except on criminal charges, or disputes relating to land.\" 14. It is difficult, perhaps, to estimate the exact influence which the movement of the Crusades exercised on the mind and heart of Europe, but there can be no question that it inter penetrated every feeling, thought, and sentiment, and inspired the social system with a new spirit. Though the great mass of the Crusaders were undoubtedly incompetent to appreciate at their full value the superior civilisation, refinement, and luxury of the countries of the East, they could not fail to perceive something of that superiority ; to enlarge their views, widen their sympathies, elevate their tastes, and enrich their imagina tions. And accordingly we find, from this period, the European nobles affected a more splendid state ; their public ceremonials were conducted with statelier pomp ; their habitations adorned with greater luxury and a more refined taste. New commo dities appeared in the marts ; richer garments glittered in the streets. But the moral and political consequences of the Crusades were yet more important. Out of them sprang the"], [133, "INFLUENCE OF THE CRUSADES. 105 great institution of Chivalry, which, with all its faults \u2014 and they were many \u2014 tended to raise the standard of humanity, to smooth the rnggednesses of an imperfect civilisation, to inculcate the sublime principles of generosity, courage, courtesy, and honour. The knight was solemnly sworn to speak the truth and defend the right ; to succour the weak and protect the oppressed ; to scorn the blandishments of ease and pleasure ; to assert the majesty of the Cross against infidels ; and to display his heroism by a succession of perilous adventures. Woman rose into a novel importance, for the true knight counted it his highest glory to be the sword and shield of suffering damsels. Justice became a recognised principle in the workings of society, for the knight was bound to an observance of the laws of faith and truth. The strong, rude hand was checked by the maintenance of an exalted courtesy and a self-denying gene rosity. And such was the power of this remarkable institution that it has furnished us with an epithet to express the best qualities of a refined nature, and we still think it the highest praise to laud the \" chivalrous\" character of our heroes. 15. Two orders of society \u2014 the capital and the foundation \u2014 the king and the commons \u2014 were highly advantaged by the Crusades, and drawn together by the bond of a mutual interest to repress the extravagant pretensions of the feudal nobility. The great barons engaged in the Holy Wars had little leisure or inclination to watch the gradual increase of the sovereign's authority and the wide spread of his prerogatives. To raise the sums necessary for their costly expedition they were con strained to sell portions of their estates, and a class of small landholders was thus established, who had everything to hope, and little to fear, from the increased power of the Crown. Money was also advanced by various towns and communities, who received in return charters of incorporation, and were permitted to elect their own governors and magistrates. These municipalities first arose in Italy,\u2014 the country most benefited by the augmented commerce between the East and the West which the Crusades necessitated, \u2014 and afterwards sprang up in France, England, Germany, and Spain. These towns to protect themselves raised extensive fortifications, and trained their male inhabitants to arms ; formed leagues among themselves for mutual defence ; and were flattered by, and, in their turn,"], [134, "106 COUNCIL OF CLERMONT. warmly supported, the Crown, having a common interest in the establishment of a supreme central authority. The license of private war, in which the great nobles had indulged, was rigorously repressed. The mailed barons who had reigned in their walled strongholds independent of the sovereign now shone as silken peers in his splendid court. The depressed vassal became the proud and portly burgher. The wretched serf rose into the free and brawny peasant. Law and Order spread their holy influence over the greater portion of civilised Europe ; and that dream of ecclesiastical supremacy which had dazzled the ambitious Hildebrand was rudely dissipated by the very agency he had evoked for its consummation. Freedom of action engendered freedom of thought. Men began to think and inquire, to doubt and investigate. Ecclesiastical tyranny was regarded as even more loathsome than feudal oppression, and the vast social commotions, the mighty intellectual and physical revolutions promoted by the Crusades, gave birth to a Wickliffe, who lighted the spark, fanned by Huss into a flame, and nourished by Luther into a world-consuming fire."], [135, "POSTSCRIPT II.

In a volume designed to present a general view of the most remarkable events which have influenced the course of European History, it would be impossible to omit mention of a movement so important as the Crusades ; while, within the limits to which we are necessarily restricted, it would be equally impossible to detail at any length their interesting and surprising incidents. A con densed summary, however, of their principal phases may be of service to the reader, as affording the text for whose fuller illustra tion he will consult the authorities we have indicated in the preceding page. 2. The First Crusade may be distinguished into eight prin- cipal stages :\u2014 (a) the Road to Constantinople ; (o) Alexius, the Greek Emperor ; (c) Nice and Asia Minor ; (d) Edessa ; (e) An tioch ; (/) the Battle ; (g) the Holy Land ; (h) the Conquest of Jerusalem. Under each head we shall offer a few observations, and first we must say something concerning the road traversed by the Crusaders, and the chiefs under whom they prosecuted their Holy War. The winter of 1095 and the spring of 1096 witnessed a general furbishing of arms and gatherings of armed men for military exercises throughout France and Lorraine, Italy and the borders of Germany. The Council of Clermont had appointed the 15th of August as the day of departure for the warriors of Europe, but a large number of the more excitable, the most restless, disorderly, and needy, looking upon their enterprise as assured of an easy and successful accomplishment, endeavoured, to anticipate the princes, knights, and nobles, and early in the spring of 1096 besought Peter the Hermit to lead them at once against the foes of Christ and the Cross. Above sixty thousand followed this miserable but self-confident fanatic along the banks of the Rhine and the Danube, until ill-concealed jealousies and the pressure of want produced a division in their ranks, and some fifteen thousand \u2014 of whom only eight were mounted \u2014 left the main body at Cologne, and at first * Take. t Nor shall evermore. J Even women stayed not behind."], [137, "WALTER THE PENNILESS. 109 under the guidance of Walter de Pexejo, and afterwards under that of his nephew, Guatier Sans-Avoir, or Walter the Penniless. made their way to Constantinople, where Alexius, the Emperor of the East, received them warmly. Peter the Hermit led his forty thousand enthusiasts through Germany and Hungary, and in traversing the latter country, they were so harassed bv the wild and ferocious Avars, that not above twenty thousand reached the capital of the Eastern Empire. Uniting with the van under Guatier Sans-Avoir, they crossed the gleaming waters of the Bosphorus, and encamped in the plains of Heliopolis. Close in the footsteps of these misguided pioneers pressed a body of horse and foot, collected by Godeschal (or Gottschalk), a Rhenish priest, from the villages on the Rhine. They could get no farther than Merseburg, where they were slaughtered by the Hungarians. In the rear of these rolled a more formidable mass ; the very scum of Europe; 200,000 of its vagabonds, profligates, and assassins, led by 3,000 of the most licentious of the nobles, and guided by a French knight, William le Charpentier. In their van were carried a goose and a goat, whom they professed to consider inspired by the Holy Ghost. After inundating the countries they traversed with a current of fierce debauchery and savage rapine, pillaging and massacring the Jews \u2014 who were not less obnoxious as enemies and easier victims than the Saracens \u2014 they reached the frontiers of Hungary. But here they were entering upon a wild and inhospitable country, some six hundred miles in breadth, crossed by many rivers, intersected by ranges of lofty hills, covered with impervious forests and impassable morasses. Thousands were lost in this miserable journey. The survivors, pinched for food, plundered the Hungarian villages. Then the King of the Huns, collecting his hosts of mounted bowmen and spearmen, confronted the disorderly columns of the Crusaders, and dealt death among them so pitilessly, that a very small number succeeded in crossing the Thracian mountains, and wending their way to Constantinople. Meanwhile, those of their predecessors who, under Walter the Penniless, had crossed the Bosphorus, and dared an advance towards Jerusalem, were destroyed by the Saracens and their Caliph, Kilidsch Arslan, in the plains of Nice. 3. The disastrous results of this dark prelude to a bloody drama did not decrease the enthusiasm which glowed hotly and"], [138, "110 POSTSCRIPT II. feverishly in the veins of Christendom. The van of the knights and nobles was now organised on a formidable scale, and at its head might be witnessed the flower of the European chivalry. The great monarchs, indeed, made no sign ; but their places were supplied by counts and barons scarcely inferior to them in power, and mostly superior in prowess and military reputa tion. Chivalric courage and national rivalry excited them to distinguish themselves in arms and council, by the earnest ness of their devotion and the brilliancy of their daring. Fore most among these stood Godfrey of Bouillon, Duke of Lorraine, the hero of the Christian \u00c6neid of \" Jerusalem Delivered,\" a descendant of the immortal Charlemagne, and a warrior of no inconsiderable capacity. Perhaps he alone was actuated by no worldly motives, but by a deep and steadfast enthusiasm, and a desire to compensate by his deliverance of the Holy Sepulchre for having borne arms against the Pope under the imperial standard of Henry IV. He was accompanied by his two brothers, Eustace, Count of Boulogne, and Baldwin the younger, and marshalled no less than 80,000 foot and 10,000 horse. 4. Hugh, Count of Vermandois, brother of the King of France, a good soldier and a devout warrior ; Robert of Nor mandy, who possessed many of the great qualities of his father, William the Conqueror, but neutralised them by his profuse liberality, his vacillations, and easiness of disposition ; Robert, Count of Flanders, the \" Sword and Lance of the Christians ;\" and Stephen, Count of Blois, a man of eloquence and ability, led the army of the French, the Normans, and the English, and were followed by so many barons of one, two, three, or four towns, that their innumeration, says the chronicler Guibert, would surpass the Homeric catalogue of the Trojan war. 5. The Provencals and inhabitants of the south of France mustered 100,000 horse and foot (including Spaniards and Lombards), under Adhemar, Bishop of Puy, the papal legate, and the famous Raymond, Count of St. Giles and Thoulouse, a veteran warrior, who had fought against the Saracens in Spain, but whose experience, wealth, and devout earnestness were not unimpaired by haughtiness, ambition, and avarice. 6. Finally, 10,000 horse and 20,000 foot assembled under the standard of the most politic and ambitious of the crusading leaders, Bohemond, son of Robert the Wise, the Norman con-"], [139, "THE CRUSADERS' MARCH. 111 queror of Apulia and Sicily. He was accompanied by his cousin Tancred, the son of the Marquis Odo the Good, and the Italian hero, in whom we discover (says Gibbon) the true spirit of chivalrv, which inspired the generous sentiments and social offices of man, far better than the base philosophy, or baser religion, of the times. 7. In four vaBt armies, under the leaders we have indicated, marched on the grand procession of the First Crusade to Con stantinople. Godfrey of Bouillon, from the Meuse and the Moselle, traversed Germany, threaded the wilds of Hungary, his spears and battle-axes overawing the ferocious Huns, and their king making common cause with him, crossed the Saave in safety, wound through the Bulgarian woods, and so ap proached Constantinople. Raymond and the Provencals swept through Lombardy, fought their way across Dalmatia and Sclavonia. and from Durazzo passed to the Bosphorus. Bohemond traversed Epirus and Thessaly. Hugh of Vermandois and his companions marched through Italy, from the snowy defiles of the Alps to the glowing plains of Apulia, but the luxuries of the fair towns of the south weakened the enthusiasm of the soldiery, and it was with great loss both of numbers and dignity that the leaders gained the common rendezvous at Constantinople. Count Hugh appeared there as a captive, for, wrecked upon the coast, his person had been seized by the lieutenants of Alexius, although four-and-twenty knights in golden armour had announced the approach of the general of the Frank army, the brother of the king of kings. Alexius, however, was sorely alarmed at the harvest of armed men which had responded to his demand for help from the Latin princes. He saw that his new auxiliaries might possibly become his masters ; that he had called into life a Frankenstein who might accomplish his destruction. Bred in the heart of a superior civilisation, he looked, moreover, with something of contempt upon the ruder manners and meaner ceremonial of the Transalpine chiefs, and suspected that the splendours of Constantinople would entice them to for get the sanctity of Jerusalem. In this situation he adopted an artful but dangerous policy. He temporised, equivocated, and diplomatised. As the Crusaders refused to pass the Bosphorus in the midst of winter, he assigned them quarters among the gardens and kiosks which adorn the shores of that narrow strait."], [140, "112 POSTSCRIPT II. \" But an incurable jealousy,\" says Gibbon, \" still rankled in the minds of the two nations, who despised each other as slaves and barbarians. Ignorance is the ground of suspicion, and suspicion was inflamed into daily provocations ; prejudice is blind, hunger is deaf; and Alexius is accused of a design to starve or assault the Latins in a dangerous post, on all sides encompassed with the waters. Godfrey sounded his trumpets, burst the net, overspread the plain, aud insulted the suburbs ; but the gates of Constantinople were strongly fortified; the ramparts were lined with archers ; and after a doubtful conflict, both parties listened to the voice of peace and religion. The gifts and promises of the Emperor insensibly soothed the fierce spirit of the western strangers. As a Christian warrior, he rekindled their zeal for the prosecution of their holy enterprise, which he engaged to second with his troops and treasures. On the return of spring, Godfrey was persuaded to occupy a pleasant and plentiful camp in Asia ; and no sooner had he reached the Bosphorus, then the Greek vessels were suddenly recalled to the opposite shore. The same policy was repeated with the succeeding chiefs, who were swayed by the example, and weakened by the departure, of their foremost companions. By his skill and diligence, Alexius prevented the union of any two of the confederate armies at the same moment under the walls of Constantinople ; and before the feast of Pentecost not a Latin pilgrim was left on the shores of Europe.\" 8. It was the great design of the Greek Emperor to make use of the Crusaders to drive back the Turks into the wilds from whence they had emerged, and to reclaim the provinces between Nice and Antioch within the boundaries of his empire. For this end he skilfully bribed the different Latin princes : Godfrey, by naming him the Champion of the empire, adopting him as his son, and appealing to his enthusiasm in the service of the Cross ; Bohemond, by vast largesse of gold and gems, silks and silver, and the promise of an independent principality ; Raymond of Thoulouse he honoured with his most secret con fidence ; and even Tancred was constrained to take the oath of fidelity and homage. Placing their hands in those of the subtle Greek, the Latin barons pronounced the vow of fealty, but not without secret reluctance and the latent desire to revenge them selves at some future period upon the Eastern Emperor."], [141, "CLOUDS AND SUNSHINE. 113 9. Their first hostile movement was against Nice. Under the walls of that famous city assembled, according to William of Tyre, 600,000 Europeans, men, women, and children, exclusive of 100,000 horsemen, splendidly clad in complete mail. The num bers of the army were equalled by the abundance of its military engines \u2014 the battering-ram and the mine, the catapult and testudo, the cross-bow and sling. The Turkish sultan, Soliman, or Kilidsch Arslan, had deposited his family and treasure within the city, and, with 50,000 horse, retired to the mountains, whence he twice descended with flashing scimitars upon the Christian camp. Against the strength and fanaticism of the warriors of the Cross, Nice could not long hold out ; but an emissary of the emperor induced its inhabitants to put them selves under his protection, and in the moment of impending victory, the imperial standard, suddenly flaunted from the walls of the citadel, checked the onrush of the indignant Crusaders. The chiefs broke up their camp, and resumed their forward march. While carelessly, and in the confidence of an arrogant superiority, traversing Phrygia in loose order, and with open columns, the Turkish cavalry, now swelled to 200,000 horsemen, broke in upon the Christian van, and dealt it a heavy blow. It was rescued from greater loss and signal shame by the approach of Duke Godfrey and the Count of Vermandois, with 60,000 cavalry, followed by the remainder of the army under Raymond of Thoulouse. The welcome succour restored the spirit of the Christians. They formed a new line, and advanced again to the fight. A fierce engagement resulted, for both armies were equal in point of courage; but the closer discipline and the nobler inspiration of the Crusaders wrung from the Moslems a decided victory. This great deed of arms took place at Dory l\u00e6um \u2014 the Eskishehr of the moderns \u2014 and was rewarded by the almost boundless spoil of Soliman's sumptuous camp. 10. Continuing their march by Akshehr (Antioch of Pisidia), Iconium (Cogni), Archelais (Erekli), and Germanicia (Marash), through a desolate and inhospitable country, parched by thirst, and heated by a burning sun, they at length arrived in Syria, and planted the standard of the Cross on the bank of the river Orontes. Antioch, a wealthy and populous city, was garrisoned by 7,000 horse, and from 15,000 to 20,000 foot. It was strongly walled, and the Cross was not speedily triumphant. Seven 1"], [142, "114 POSTSCRIPT II. months were wearily exhausted within sight of its 500 towers, and the surrounding plain was studded thickly with the graves of the famine-worn and toil-stricken Christians. But Bohe mond having bribed a Syrian renegado who commanded an important point of the defences to betray his trust, Antioch was taken. The citadel, however, still held out, and the besiegers were soon in their turn besieged by the innumerable hosts of Kerboga, the lieutenant of the Sultan. Resistance seemed a hopeless delusion. They implored peace. Kerboga offered slavery or the sword. In fierce despair they drew together their lances, and sallied from the town. On neither side was quarter given; but the heaven -inspired heroism of the Crusaders triumphed, and the Turks were scattered like a snow-drift before the wind. Then followed a period of inaction, of intem perance, and of shame. The worst qualities of human nature rose to the surface, as may often be observed to happen after any protracted period of trial and suffering. Many of the chiefs turned cravens ; the contagion of cowardice spread far and wide ; and it was with extreme difficulty that Godfrey and Bohemond and Tancred could revive the drooping spirits of the soldiers of the Cross. When, at last, the army moved forward, the immense hosts that had swept so exultantly through the eastern provinces of Europe, and menaced the Emperor of the East in his capital, were reduced to 40,000 men, and not more than half of these were fit for immediate service. The sight of the Holy City \u2014 of the mystic Jerusalem \u2014 renewed their ardour, and inspired them with something of the ancient spirit. For forty days the fierce siege was prolonged, scarcely less to the suffering of the beleaguerers than the beleaguered, and then the assault w7as made (15th July, 1099). The shock of the Christian lances might not be withstood, and soon they burned a lurid red with the blood of the Moslems ! For three days the massacre con tinued : 70,000 Turks were put to the sword ; the Jews were burnt in their synagogue ; and the warriors then ascended, barefoot and bareheaded, the hill of Calvary; while the full anthems of the attending priests rose solemnly upon the air. They kissed the stone beneath which the God made Man had reposed, and with tears of joy hailed the deliverance of the Holy Sepulchre from the pollution of the infidel. Eight days later, the Crusaders elected their hero, Godfrey, King of Jerusalem,"], [143, "THE SECOND CRUSADE. 115 and for a twelvemonth he exercised the supreme sway over Jerusalem and its feudal dependencies of Tripoli and Tiberius ; but his piety refused the title of king. He would not wear a crown of gold, he said, where his Saviour had worn a crown of thorns. His brother, Baldwin, who succeeded him, was less devout, and did not forbear to style himself Rex Hierusalem, primvs Latinorum. 11. The conquests accomplished by the First Crusade were not, however, permanent. The Moslems recovered from the blow, and harassed the Latin princes with continual forays. '\u2022 They were exposed as the outposts of Christendom,\" says Hallarn, \" with no respite and few resources.\" One by one their provinces were wrested from them ; but it is not the less astonishing with what tenacity they held their principal strong holds, though surrounded by hosts of enemies. The superiority of race was never more strikingly illustrated than in the victories achieved over the Moslems by such small bands of Franks, that the disparity of numbers, though well attested, savours more of the extravagance of romance than the soberness of history. 12. The Second Crusade was undertaken in 1147, and its principal heroes were Louis VII. of France and the Emperor Conrad III. Each set out on his enterprise with 70,000 horse, and twice as many foot, having depopulated his dominions of its best and bravest blood \u2014 of its nobles and artificers \u2014 its skill, strength, and valour. The moving spirit was St. Bernard of Clairvaux, and the object, to defend and establish the struggling kingdom of Jerusalem. The sacred city was now protected by a mere handful of warriors, bound together by a solemn vow for the defence of the Holy Land, and divided into the military orders, afterwards so famous, of the Knights of the Temple (a.d. 1118) and the Knights of the Hospital of St. John (a.d. 1124). But this new European movement, though it convulsed all Christendom, brought them no effectual aid. Betrayed by the treacherous and impolitic Greeks, whose sins were punished in a later generation by the capture of Constantinople \u2014 smitten by the climate \u2014 decimated by their own vices \u2014 the vast armies of the two kings melted away with fearful rapidity, and only a few horsemen reached the Holy City. A fruitless siege of Damascus wTas the sole result of the Second Crusade. 13. Migrations of daring warriors took place in each succes- i 2"], [144, "116 POSTSCRIPT II. sive spring and summer to the hallowed ground of the Holy Sepulchre ; but Europe as a whole, after its second great effort, rested awhile in the supineness of exhaustion. The Teutonic Order, established in 1190, carried its knightly valour and murderous proselytism into the more profitable sphere of Polish warfare ; and it required the tidings of the fall of Jerusalem and its Latin ruler into the hands of the celebrated Saladin (a.d. 1187) to arouse once more the martial spirit and religious enthusiasm of the knights and nobles of Christendom. The Third Crusade was then undertaken by the three greatest sovereigns of Europe \u2014 the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, Philip Augustus of France, and our own Richard C\u0153ur de Lion. It produced no permanent results, as far as a Christian kingdom of Jerusalem was con cerned ; but it had a more momentous consequence in the origin of that persistent enmity between England and France \u2014 that long series of wars which only terminated on the field of Water loo \u2014 that uneasy sentiment of hostile apprehension which even now a passing gust awakens, and which arose in the jealousies of Richard I. and Philip Augustus. It was further illustrated by those romantic feats of prowess which rendered the name of the English king a word of terror to Turkish ears, until women quieted their children with the threat of bringing Richard to them ; and when a Turk's horse started at a shadow, the rider Would exclaim \u2014 Cuides-tu qu'y soit le roi Richard? The chivalrous courtesy of the noble Saladin, the impulsive genero sity of the headstrong Plantagenet, have been familiarised to English readers by the magic pen of Sir Walter Scott ; and the incidents of the Third Crusade are more generally known than those of the first and more important movement. But before passing to a brief view of the remaining phases of the Holy War, we cannot refrain from illustrating our pages with one of Gibbon's brilliant pictures. 14. \" A march of one hundred miles, from Acre to Ascalon, was a great and perpetual battle of eleven days. In the disorder of his troops, Saladin remained on the field, with seventeen guards, without lowering his standard, or suspending the sound of his brazen kettledrum. He again rallied, and renewed the charge ; and his preachers or heralds called aloud on the Unita rians manfully to stand up against the Christian idolaters. But the progress of these idolaters was irresistible ; and it was only"], [145, "THE LION'S HEART. 117 by demolishing the walls and buildings of Ascalon that the Sultan could prevent them from occupying an important fortress on the confines of Egypt. During a severe winter, the armies slept ; but in the spring the Franks advanced within a day's march of Jerusalem, under the leading standard of the English king ; and his active spirit intercepted a convoy or caravan of 7,000 camels. Saladin had fixed his station in the Holy City; but the city was struck with consternation and discord. He fasted ; he prayed ; he preached ; he offered to share the dangers of the siege ; but his Mamelukes, who remembered the fate of their companions at Acre, pressed the Sultan, with loyal or seditious clamours, to reserve his person and their courage for the future defence of their religion and empire. The Moslems were delivered by the sudden, or, as they deemed, the miraculous retreat of the Christians ; and the laurels of Richard were blasted by the prudence or envy of his companions. The hero, ascending a hill, and veiling his face, exclaimed, with an indignant voice \u2014 ' Those who are unwilling to rescue, are unworthy to view, the sepulchre of Christ!' After his return to Acre, on the news that Jaffa was surprised by the Sultan, he sailed with some mer chant vessels, and leaped foremost on the beach. The castle was relieved by his presence, and 60,000 Turks and Saracens fled before his arms. The discovery of his weakness provoked them to return in the morning ; and they found him carelessly encamped before the gates, with only seventeen knights and 300 archers. Without counting their numbers, he sustained their charge ; and we learn from the evidence of his enemies that the King of England, grasping his lance, rode furiously along their front, from the right to the left wing, without meeting an adversary who dared to encounter his career. Am I,\" exclaims Gibbon, \" writing the history of Orlando or Amadis?\"* 15. After the great expedition of the three kings, no other Crusade was attempted against the Turks in Palestine. The Fourth, in 1401, was proclaimed by Innocent III. He described, in eloquent language, the ruin of Jerusalem and the triumph of heathendom; and promised to all the faithful warriors of Italy, France, and Germany, a redemption of sins, and a plenary indulgence to all who should serve in Palestine, either a * The feats of prowess of the English king are told with an air of admiring simplicity in the \" Itinerary of Richard I.,\" by Geoffrey de Vinsauf ."], [146, "118 POSTSCRIPT II. year in person or two years by proxy. The European monarchs shut their ears to the papal trumpet; but its stirring tones awakened the zeal and the cupidity of the great barons and princes of the second order\u2014 Thibaut, Count of Champagne, the lord of 2,200 knights ; Louis, Count of Blois, nephew of the kings of England and France ; Simon de Montfort, the fierce and terrible scourge of the Albigenses ; and the chivalrous Geoffroi de Villehardouin, Marshal of Champagne. > At the same time, Baldwin, Count of Flanders, took the Cross at Bruges, and was joined by his brother Henry, and the principal Flemish knights and citizens. Once more there was a sharpening of swords and a burnishing of armour ; and the alliance of the Venetians being secured by a promise of an equal division of all conquests by sea and land, the Crusaders assembled at Venice early in the spring of 1202, and the vessels of St. Mark bore them to Constantinople. That great and famous city was then disturbed by the contest between Alexius, who had usurped the imperial throne of the East, and his brother, Isaac Angelus, the legitimate heir, whom he had deprived of his eyesight, as well as despoiled of his crown. The Crusaders lent their strength and valour to the support of the rightful emperor ; drove the usurper from Constantinople ; and replaced Isaac Angelus upon his throne. A year or two followed of jealousies and quarrels between the Greeks and Latins. The Greeks rebelled against Isaac Angelus and his son, under the usurper Mourzoufle, and in their turn were coerced bj' the Crusaders, who, led by the Venetian Doge, Dandolo, undertook a second siege of Constanti nople (a.d. 1204) ; stormed the city ; rewarded themselves with a booty rich and rare ; shattered or flung into the melting-pot the precious memorials of ancient art; and established a Latin empire, which was abolished in 1261. 16. The Fifth Crusade arose in the year 1218, and 200,000 Franks landed at the eastern mouth of the Nile to subdue Palestine by overthrowing the power of the Sultan in Egypt. After a siege of sixteen months, Damietta was taken ; but the misconduct of the papal legate, Pelagius, ruined the Christian army. Encompassed by the Nile and the gathering hosts of the Moslems, the Franks, decimated by disease, were constrained to evacuate their dearly-won conquest, and to con tent themselves with a few concessions contemptuously granted"], [147, "THE LAST CRUSADES. 119 to the pilgrims, aud the restitution of the supposed relic of the True Cross. 17. The Sixth Crusade, in 122S, was led by the Emperor Frederick II. Emulous of the example of his great prede cessor, Frederick Barbarossa, and fired by the eloquent appeals of his guardian, Innocent III., he had assumed the Cross at the early age of twenty-one ; but as advancing years matured his intellect and developed his political sagacity, he hesi tated to embark in an enterprise whose dangers he discerned, and whose inutility he appreciated. The successors of Pope Innocent redoubled their prayers and commands, and claimed the fulfilment of his vow. He sailed, therefore, from Brun dusium with a fleet and army of 40,000 men, but a severe malady compelled his return in three days. For thus suspending his vow the arrogance of Rome launched its thunders at his head, and when in the following year he seriously endeavoured to fulfil it, fulminated a bull of excommunication. Nevertheless, he fought his way to Jerusalem ; obtained its restitution from the Mahometans ; recovered Bethlem, Tyre, Sidon, and Naza reth ; and established a rule of peace, order, and prosperity, destined to be overthrown in 1243 by the irruption of the strange and savage hordes of the Carizmians, the shepherds of the Caspian shores. 18. The two last Crusades, the Seventh and Eighth, were undertaken by Louis IX. of France \u2014 the St. Louis of the Roman Church. But Europe was weary of these fruitless ex peditions, and the European monarchs were no longer inclined to join in enterprises whose chief result was to augment the power and influence of the Holy See. It was from France alone that Louis drew his forces, and it was France that his blind fanaticism exhausted of her manhood and her treasure ; 1,800 sail whitened the harbour of Cyprus, and with 50,000 foot and 2,S00 knights he undertook the invasion of Egypt. They landed at Damietta. \" On the shore,\" says the gallant and chivalrous Joinville, \"we beheld the entire force of the Sultan, who were personable men to look at. The Sultan wore armour of burnished gold, of so dazzling a lustre that when the sun shone upon it, he seemed a sun himself. The tumult and uproar his warriors made with their shawms and naccaires was terrible to hear, and seemed very strange to the French.\" Damietta"], [148, "120 POSTSCRIPT II. speedily fell before the prowess of the Crusaders, but it was the first and last of their conquests. Advancing upon Cairo they were impeded by the inundation of the Nile ; a shower of Greek fire was incessantly poured upon them ; the Count of Artois (Louis' brother), and many knights, were surprised and slain at Massoura ; sickness and famine mowed down their thousands; and in a disastrous retreat towards the sea coast, Louis and his com panions fell into the hands of the Turks. Four hundred thou sand livres were paid as the King's ransom. He returned to France, and spent nearly twenty years in showing his subjects how many virtues might adorn the character of an amiable enthusiast. But he still wore the Cross upon his garments ; the fire of devout ardour still glowed within his heart ; and his prose lytising zeal was kindled into a devouring flame by a report that the Moorish prince of Tunis desired to embrace Christianity. \" Girt with many a baron bold,\" and accompanied by Charles of Anjou and Edward of England, he set out, in 1270, on the Eighth Crusade. Sailing to the coast of Africa, he laid siege to the city of Tunis, with 6,000 horse, and 30,000 foot. On its burning sands his army soon wasted away, and he himself was seized with a fever which terminated his life and reign. When his last hour approached, he ordered his body to be placed on a bed of ashes, and crossing his hands on his breast, with eyes up lifted to heaven, rendered his soul back to his Creator (a.d. 1271), at the very same hour (says Joinville) that our Lord Jesus Christ expired on the Cross for the salvation of his people. 19. St. Louis was the last of the Crusaders, and had sur vived the spirit which first impelled the warriors of Europe to undertake those remarkable movements. The great lords were as weary as their monarchs of wars which were barren of results, and perceived that their absence exposed their vassals to the extremest misgovernment and their own estates to serious depredation. When the King of France urged Joinville to accompany him in that second expedition which terminated so disastrously, the good knight replied, that when before he went beyond sea on the service of God, the people and officers of the King of France had so crushed and oppressed his vassels that they were sorely impoverished, insomuch that hardly ever would they or he recover themselves. \" And I saw clearly,\" he says, \" that if I undertook another pilgrimage"], [149, "121 MISTAKEN POLICY OF THE CRUSADERS. of the Cross, it would be the total ruin of rr.y poor people.

Such an event, which, in the reign of Henry V., and during the regency of the gallant Duke of Bedford, the able brother of Henry V., seemed not improbable, must have exercised a disastrous influ ence upon the fortunes of England \u2014 have reduced it to the position of a French dependency, or burdened it with a second, a more powerful, and more ungovernable Ireland. While, on the one hand, we should have had no great Protestant power, no constitutional government, no commercial polity, no grand system of naval enterprise, no United States, no British India, or prosperous Australia ; on the other hand, Europe would have been deprived of the valuable inspiration of French literature and art, of her weight as the first nation in continental Europe, of that rivalry between the two commonwealths of the West"], [154, "126 SIEGE OF ORLEANS. which, whether in peace or in war, has been productive of vast benefits to both countries, as well as to the civilised world. It is always curious, and sometimes useful, to speculate upon events that have never happened, to trace the consequences of an altered state of circumstances, to investigate the probable results of a defeat substituted for a victory, or of a reform or a revolu tion which did not take place. Assuredly, had the siege of Orleans in 1429 terminated in the victory of the English \u2014 had no Joan of Arc, like an inspired Sibyl, roused the spirit of her country against the invaders\u2014 had France become permanently subjugated to England \u2014 Europe, at the present day, would have presented a vastly different aspect, and our own annals have borne a very different character. And hence, we shall do well to acknowledge the wisdom of that overruling Providence which directs the current of human affairs, and controls the destinies of states as well as individuals. 2. France, in the first years of the fifteenth century, offered a pitiable spectacle to the sad eyes of its best and bravest chil dren. Torn to pieces by the desperate struggles of opposing parties, lacerated by the cruel hands of its own sons, heaving with the convulsion of a civil war, it had showed itself unable to oppose the conquering march of our English Harry. Many of its leading nobles had recognised his claims to the crown. The daughter of its sovereign had married the invader, and their son had been peaceably recognised as King of England and France. Its capital was occupied by the veterans of a foreign king. To a foreign king bowed the crests of its princes and peers. Its peasantry were reduced to the most miserable desti tution. Troops of brigands roved through its fairest provinces, burning houses and pillaging granaries. Neither youth nor old age escaped their sword or their lust. The estate of France was then, indeed, most miserable. \" There appeared nothing but a horrible face, confusion, poverty, desolation, solitariness, and fear. The lean and bare labourers in the country terrified even thieves themselves, who had nothing left them to spoil but the carcases of these poor miserable creatures, wandering up and down like ghosts drawn from their graves. The least farms and hamlets were fortified by these robbers \u2014 English, Burgun dians, and Frenchmen \u2014 every one striving to do his worst. All men of war were well agreed to spoil the countryman and mcr-"], [155, "127 MISERAELE CONDITION OF FRANCE. chant. Even the cattle, accustomed to the larum (alarm) bell, the sign of the enemy's approach, would run home of themselves without any guide, by this accustomed misery.\" * 3. Nor were these the onty disadvantages she had to contend with. On the fatal plain of Azincourt she had lost her prin cipal nobility. Her wealth was exhausted by the expenses of a protracted war ; her officers were unable to cope with the veteran leaders of the English ; her soldiers durst not meet them in the open field, so great was the terror inspired by the memories of glorious Crecy and Poitiers. In England the war was intensely popular, for national prejudice is always superior to individual wisdom ; and the invading armies were therefore composed of picked men, whose discipline was rendered endurable by the additional attraction of high pay. All the energies of the English nobility were cast into the struggle with a wonderful unanimity ; while those of the French nobles who had escaped the chances of the fight were divided among them selves, and the Armagnacs were more inflamed against their compatriots, the Burgundians, than against their invaders, the English. Therefore, it happened that the English arms, after the death of Henry V., made great progress in mastering that France which every Englishman considered the rightful depen dency of the English crown. At the accession of Charles VII. to the throne of Clovis in 1422, he found Henry VI. acknow ledged by all the northern provinces, except a few fortresses; by most of Guienne, and the dominions of the Duke of Burgundy. The central provinces, with Languedoc, Poitou, and Dauphine, were almost all France that Charles could call his own, and Paris, the capital, was occupied by the standards of his enemy. For him there remained nothing, apparently, but a life of indo lent poverty and degrading pleasure at Bourges ; for his parti sans, nothing but a war of fortresses and isolated strongholds, in which the French often displayed a brilliant valour, but which could only delay, not prevent, the entire subjugation of their country. One by one, indeed, these fell, as the Duke of Bedford, Talbot, Salisbury, and Warwick prosecuted their triumphant enterprise ; and at no time in the protracted struggle between the two rival nations, not even when Henry of Monmouth wedded the fair Katherine in the church of Notre Dame, * See notes to Southey's Joan of Arc."], [156, "128 SIEGE OF ORLEANS. seemed there so reasonable a prospect of the complete reduction of France as when the Earl of Salisbury invested Orleans in 1428. With Orleans would have been completed the capture of the fortresses north of the Loire. South of that river the country was defended by few places of any strength, and must soon have been overrun by the victorious English. The for tunes of France seemed in \" their sere and yellow leaf.\" Neither in her councillors nor her warriors could she put any hope. A few months more, and she might have ceased to fill a prominent place on the historic page, but for a most marvellous revolution, wrought by a most marvellous and apparently insignificant agent. LgCIll. 4. In the little village of Domremy, on the frontiers of Lorraine, flourished a village maiden of considerable personal beauty, the daughter of a pious peasant, Jacques D'Arc, or Dare, who named her Jeannette, or Jeanne, which at a later period was Latinised into Johanna and Englished into Joan. She was naturally of an enthusiastic temperament \u2014 a poet in feeling but not in expres sion \u2014 of a nature peculiarly alive to the mysterious, and apt in idealising the real and actual. Bred in a devout family, her youthful mind was insensibly stored with old historical traditions of the knights and warriors of France, with marvellous legends of the great deeds wrought by the faith of saints and martyrs, until she began to blend her ardent piety with her fervent patriotism, to worship God and her motherland in one pure and innocent adoration. Her lonely labour \u2014 tending her father's flocks on the silent hill-side, while the lights and shadows swept swiftly over the low-lying meadows, and heaven seemed to circle earth in its awful arms \u2014 nourished her dreamy and imaginative soul with strange fancies and inscrutable visions, until the flowing stream made a celestial music for her ear, and the sward seemed trodden by airy and angelic shapes. \" In solitude and peace Her soul was nurst, amidst the loveliest scenes Of unpolluted Nature.\" \u2014 Southey. Thus, unknown to herself, and to those who surrounded her, Fate was slowly preparing her for an enterprise which should garland her name with the flowers of an immortal memory \u2014 the deliverance of her native land from the armed hosts of the invader."], [157, "129 THE CHAMPION MAID. 5. Lorraine was less harassed by the horrors of war than many other portions of unhappy France, but marauding English or Bnrgundians sometimes rode with fire and sw7ord into the neighbourhood of Domremy ; and on one occasion her family and herself were constrained to seek shelter for fifteen days in an auberge, or hostelry, at Neufchateau, whence arose the fiction of Monstrelet,* that she was bred as a servant in an inn. Of some of the woes of her battle-torn country she had, therefore, posi tive experience, and no more was needed to direct the vague enthusiasm of her nature into a course which might utilise it for the common weal. \" Oh that France might be saved !\" was now the prayer ever throbbing on her lips ; and eagerly she questioned herself in what wise could she help to save it. Stimulated by this fever of patriotism, inspired by the sublimest faith in the miraculous powers of the saints, urged by the innate poetry of her nature, she began to hear Heaven's answer to her prayer. A sudden glory broke upon her gaze, and aw-ful Voices pealed through the deep silence to warn her that the hour was at hand, and it was for her to rescue France. She saw the glory ; she heard the Voices ! Do you not believe it ? Did not Shakspeare see with the inner eye the tricksy Puck and the dainty Ariel ? Did he not hear the charmful music that woke the echoes of the Enchanted Island ? Have you never, in the silence and the solitude, hearkened to the mysterious echoes of some weird and ineffable melody, stealing upon your soul from what far-off \" airy wilderness\" of the Long Ago you know not ? The electric chain by which we are darkly bound links earth with heaven, and to the innocent heart of devout Faith celestial flashes of unutterable light may haply take their way, unguessed of by the common herd. 6. \"At the age of thirteen\" \u2014 we quote the Champion- Maiden's own artless tale \u2014 \" a voice from God came nigh to me to help me in subduing myself, and that voice approached about the hour of noon, in summer time, while I lingered in my father's garden. And I had fasted the day before. And I heard the voice on my right hand, in the direction of the church ; and when I heard the voice I saw also a shining light. After wards St. Michael and St. Margaret and St. Catherine appeared to me. They were girt about with a halo of glory : I saw that * Adopted by Hume. \u00a3"], [158, "130 SIEGE OF ORLEANS. their brows were crowned with gems ; I heard their voices, that they were soft and gentle. But I could not distinguish their arms or limbs. I heard them oftener than I saw them, and usually when the church bells chimed for prayer. And if I fared through the woods I heard them ; I could clearly distin guish their voices drawing near to me. And when I thought I heard the heavenly voices, I knelt down, and bowed my head to the very earth. \" Their presence gladdened me even to tears ; and after they left me I wept because they did not take me back with them to Paradise.\" 7. For months the voices spoke to her, and the angels, crowned with jewels, filled her solitude with the glory of their presence. At length the villagers of Domremy received the sad tidings of the siege of Orleans, the last great city of the north which acknowledged the authority of the king ; and much they conversed among themselves of the ill fortune of the sove reign, and the distresses of the kingdom. Joan's thoughts were thus directed constantly towards the memorable scene, where, it was reasonably supposed, \" the French were to make their last stand for maintaining the independence of their monarchy and the rights of their sovereign.\" The Voices now spoke louder and more frequently ; and they communicated to her the parti culars of her Divine mission \u2014 that she was at once to quit her home and her parents, and perform her appointed task of expelling the English from France, and anointing the Dauphin king at the sacred city of Eheims. 8. Her first step was to seek the Sieur de Bandricourt, who commanded at Vaucouleurs \u2014 the nearest town to Domremy \u2014 though her parents angrily protested against her exposing her soul and body to the perils and pollutions of a camp. One of her uncles was persuaded to conduct her thither ; but her narra tive made little impression on the hard, blunt mind of an old soldier. He regarded her enthusiasm as madness : her Divine inspiration as the delusion of an evil spirit. Her earnestness at length produced some effect ; for is it not the veritable music of Orpheu3 which subdues the oak of many centuries and the heart of the primeval rock ? Baudricourt perceived that whether her supposed mission was a delusion or an imposture, it might pos sibly work to the advantage of the royal cause ; and, finding the"], [159, "A MARVELLOUS RECOGNITION. 131 inhabitants of Vaucouleurs strongly influenced by her innocence and devoutness, by her confident declaration that she alone could save France, and that it was the Divine will which urged her forward in her perilous path, he sent her with an escort to Chinon, where the Dauphin Charles was slumbering in the lap of pleasure. She went forth armed as a knight, for the Voices \u2014 or rather her innate sense of delicacy \u2014 had bidden her assume the weapons and armour of chivalry ; and, as she rode along, the peasants gathered by the wayside to gaze upon the Holy Maid whose supernatural experiences were already the theme of common wonder. On reaching Chinon, she was admitted without delay into the royal presence. The Dauphin, to test the correctness of her inspiration, had dressed himself less richly than his courtiers, and mingled with them ; but she was no sooner admitted into the presence-chamber than she flung her self at his feet, and, kneeling before him, exclaimed \u2014 \" Most noble Dauphin, the King of Heaven announces to you by me that you shall be crowned and anointed king in the city of Rheims, and shall reign as his vice-gerent over France !\" It is probable that she had seen his features in some common por traits, or had heard them described by others, or that his natural bearing, and the instinctive deference in the manners of his attendants, who would be unable altogether to forget that he was their monarch, distinguished him at once as a ruler of men ; but she herself believed that heaven inspired her in her suc cessful recognition, and the popular mind was convinced that the Holy Maid had miraculously detected the royal person. 9. The astute councillors of Charles, it is probable, discredited her tale, and deemed her \u2014 what she was not \u2014 an impostor ; but they quickly perceived how powerful an agent she might become in arousing the enthusiasm of the people to work out their rescue from the oppression of the victorious English. The state of public feeling in France, as Sismondi eloquently shows, was now favourable to an enthusiastic belief in a Divine inter position in favour of the party that had hitherto been unsuccessful and oppressed. When a country is in the last gasp of sorrow and suffering, it naturally looks to heaven for some direct inter ference in its behalf. Its religious feeling is aroused by its distress ; its misfortunes it regards as the just punishments of its crimes ; and repenting in sackcloth and ashes, it waits with K 2"], [160, "132 SIEGE OF ORLEANS. eager expectation for the rainbow in the skies, the promise of God's pardon for the past, help in the present, and favour in the future. The peculiar religious spirit of that age must also be remembered by the student who would rightly estimate the causes of the Holy Maid's success. Scepticism was not yet popular ; the religion of the masses was a religion of faith. They believed in miracles wrought by the saints in favour of the suffering : not a village shrine but was consecrated by memories of their interposition in aid of sorrowing humanity. A current of emotional devotion was sweeping through the length and breadth of the land. There are times when the flood-gates are suddenly opened, and the waters roll forth in tumultuous abundance : when the heart of a people is mysteriously stirred by a general conviction of sin, by a common desire for Heaven's pardon ; and it was so with the France of 1429. Friars and priests traversed the rural districts ; visited the towns and villages ; preached in the chapels and churches ; and exhorted the people to look to Heaven for deliverance from the pillages of the soldiery and all the horrors of intestine war. A prophecy was also generally accepted that as France had been lost by a woman, so she would be saved by a woman ; and the people were accordingly pre pared to receive the Virgin of Lorraine as predestined by Heaven to repair the disasters which had flowed from the vices of Isabeau of Bavaria. Evil spirits had had their day, had worked all the evil they could ; the saints, at last, had deigned to hearken to the prayers of their votaries, and it might reason ably be hoped that the right arm of the God of Hosts would now be bared in defence of France. 10. The court party took advantage of this superstitious feeling, and began to stir it up more actively by taking every possible step to ascertain the genuineness of the Warrior-Maid's alleged Divine mission. Most men believed she was inspired ; but by whom ? By God or evil spirits ? By God or devil ? The spotless purity of her life, and her devout performance of every religious duty enjoined by the Church, seemed absolutely to disprove the possibility of a maleficent inspiration. To this conclusion came a commission of ecclesiastics, and the pundits of the great law-school of Poitiers, by whom, at the Dauphin's request, she was closely examined ; and assured, therefore, of the celestial origin of her enterprise, her services were gladly"], [161, "THE SHADOW OF THE CROSS. 133 accepted by the partisans of the royal cause. She v/as accord ingly clothed in a suit of armour of spotless white. A black charger of matchless beauty was provided for her. In her right hand she bore a lance, which she had learned to wield with admirable skill : at her side hung a small battle-axe, and the con secrated sword which, at her bidding, had been removed from the shrine of St. Catherine de Fierbois. It was marked on the blade with five crosses. No helmet concealed the majesty of her brow, crowned with its wealth of amber hair, or the lustre of her darkly bright eyes, or the glow of enthusiasm which shone in every feature. A page carried her banner, woven in direction with the orders of the Heavenly Voices. Its folds of white satin were strewn with fleurs-de-lis, and bore a representation of the Saviour in his glory, and the words Jhesus Maria. She loved the sacred banner better than sword, axe, or spear ; for, with a true woman's feeling, she shrunk from the use of a death -dealing weapon . 11. Her appearance among the soldiers of France aroused an instant excitement. Her gallant bearing, her beautiful and animated countenance, and her skilful management of her steed, increased the emotion already awakened by the reports of her Divine mission. A new spirit breathed through the once despondent ranks. The rigid discipline she enjoined added to the general effect. She drove from the camp its usual profligate followers; she insisted that both soldiers and officers should attend mass and the confessional ; at every halting-place an altar was erected, and sacrament administered ; foul language and ribald oaths were severely punished ; license, and excess of every description, strictly forbidden. The army felt the impulse of a pure and holy influence, and marched forward under the very Shadow of the Cross, saints as well as warriors \u2014 led, as they believed, by no mere woman, no virgin only, however gentle and fair, but by an angel from heaven, whose task it was to deliver France from the oppression of her foes. 12. And not only was superstition powerful on her behalf among her own countrymen ; it did not fail to affect, though in a different manner, the soldiers of the English. These stout and stalwart veterans had been successful on every field, face to face with opponents of flesh and blood, but they were loth to engage in a combat with the powers of darkness. The French"], [162, "134 SIEGE OF ORLEANS. reverenced the Champion-Maid as a messenger from heaven ; but they abhorred and feared her as a devil. It was useless, they thought, to contend against the spells of hell ; the battle was swayed against them, they believed, by the, unseen spirits of evil. A superstitious awe enfeebled their sinews.* They hung back in their own country, or deserted from the army, through fear of the incantations by which alone they conceived so extraordinary a person could succeed. The arm that had swung the battle-axe right lustily was paralysed ; the heart that had gone forth undaunted against overpowering numbers was smitten with a panic-dread. What the hosts of France could never have accomplished was immediately achieved by the village-maid of Domremy \u2014 a remarkable fact in the history of Popular Superstitions. 13. The fortunes of the war had now converged into a point at Orleans, before whose walls the English army appeared, on the 12th of October, 1428, under the leadership of the gallant and able Earl of Salisbury. This fair historic city clusters upon the northern bank of the sunny Loire, encircled by smiling plains, embowered in prolific vineyards. Its inhabitants, in the year 142S, were men of an heroic and patriotic spirit, and conscious of the vast importance of the trust reposed in them. They knew that the fall of Orleans portended the fall of the French monarchy, and girded themselves for a resolute defence. Razing its suburbs down to the river-bank, levelling the stately chateaux which rose among the surrounding groves, storing up ample supplies of food, ammunition, and arms, they calmly, but despairingly, awaited the onset of the foe. But notwithstand ing their skilful preparations, notwithstanding the flame of the cannon, and the bolts of cross-bows which armed every battle ment and protected every point of vantage, the English pushed forward their approaches steadily, and defended their advance (as Monstrelet remarks), in accordance with the usual custom of English warfare, by throwing up rude works of earth. These were gradually linked together, until the city was completely belted round on the north by the beleaguering fortifications. The southern suburb of Orleans was connected with the northern bank by a strong bridge, defended by a tete-du-pont, and two towers, called the Tourelles, which were built on the * Michdet."], [163, "CAPTURE OF THE TOURELLES. 135 bridge itself where it rested on an island at a little distance from the tete-du-pont. Indeed, the solid masonry of the bridge terminated at the Tourelles, and a drawbridge extended from thence to the southern shore. Thus, the Tourelles and the tete-du-pont together formed an outwork of considerable strength, capable of defence by a numerous garrison, and enabled the Orleannais, under its shelter, to communicate with the southern provinces, and draw supplies and reinforcements. Against the Tourelles, therefore, Lord Salisbury directed his most earnest efforts, and after some severe repulses, carried it by storm on the 23rd of October. This success in no short time proved the cause of an irretrievable disaster to the be siegers. The Earl had ascended the tower, and from one of the higher windows was reconnoitring the defences of the town, when he was struck by a stone shot fired from an hostile cannon, and so severely wounded that within eight days he died. He was succeeded in the command by Edward de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk, his inferior in skill and experience, his inferior in the affections and conduct of the men. \" Accursed tower ; accursed fatal hand, That hath contrived this woeful tragedy. In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame; Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars ; W hilst any trump did sound, or drum struck up, His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field.\" \u2014 Shakspeare. The possession of the Tourelles did not, it is true, complete the conquest of the city, though sorely distressed by a battery of cannon which the English planted there, and which swept some of the principal streets with its fire. Nothing could withstand their steadfast advance \u2014 \"Rather with their teeth The walls they'll tear down, than forsake the siege \" \u2014 neither the vigorous resistance of the besieged, nor the exertions of the famous Dunois. To cut off all communication with the surrounding country, six strongly fortified posts, called bastilles, were raised at certain intervals round the town, and connected by strong lines. In spite of several sorties these works were completed in the spring of 1429, and the besieged reduced to a deplorable extremity of famine. 14. Something of the same terrible evil was experienced by"], [164, "136 SIEGE OF ORLEANS. the besiegers, until relieved by the victory which Sir John Fastolfe\u2014 so unjustly associated in the popular mind with the Shakspearian Falstaff\u2014 gained over the enemy at Rouvrai, neat- Orleans, towards the middle of March, 1429. In this brilliant exploit the superiority of the English seemed conclusively proved by the defeat of 4,000 French and Scots by 1,600 fighting men. It cleared the countryside of the enemy's forces, and enabled large convoys of stores and food to reach Suffolk's camp unmolested.* Never had the spirit of the invaders risen so high ; never had the fortunes of France fallen so low. Despair pervaded the royal councils. The Orleannais themselves were weary of a contest which seemed hopeless, and at length offered to surrender the city into the hands of the Duke of Burgundy, the English ally. But the Regent Duke, John of Bedford, insisted upon an unconditional submission, and to this last extremity the inhabitants were on the point of being reduced, when Joan of Arc made her appearance upon the scene ; and as on the mimic stage the waving wand of the enchanter will suddenly transform the desolation of winter into the bloom and verdure and fresh young beauty of the spring, so her presence awoke hope where despondency had prevailed, and ensured victory where ruin had seemed inevitable. 15. With a small army, which the energy of Dunois, Xain trailles, and others of the French leaders had contrived to concentrate at Blois out of the scattered remnants of many unsuccessful fields, Joan of Arc set out for Orleans on the 25th of April, 1429. The date is worthy of remembrance, for it proved the crisis of English dominion in France, which thence forth rapidly declined. On the 2Sth they approached the town, and its besiegers having grown supine with success, so that \u2014 as Hall says \u2014 \" thei kepte not their watch so diligently as thei were accustomed, nor scoured now the countrey environed as thei before had ordained,\" the Pucelle, \"in the dedde tyme of the nighte, and in a greate rayne and thundere, with all their vitaile and artillerie entered into the citie.\" f And on the fol lowing day she passed through its echoing streets, mounted on a * Owing to the convoy being largely composed of salt fish for the Lenten epasts of the English soldiers, this engagement was popularly called \"the Battle of the Herrings.\" J The French account that she traversed the English lines in the broad day light is improbable."], [165, "THE MAID'S MESSAGE TO THE ENGLISH. 137 white horse, and clothed in the sheen of dazzling mail. Dunois rode at her side, and the bravest knights of France followed in her train. And as the inhabitants gazed upon her glorious beauty and her consecrated banner, they saw, as they thought \u2014 and may they not be forgiven for the thought ? \u2014 an angel from heaven that had come down to save them. They listened to her words with speechless eagerness, and felt animated by a new and unconquerable spirit. As for the Maid herself, she spent almost all her time in prayer, and withdrew from the fetes with which the Orleannais would have celebrated her arrival. 16. If the French were aroused to unwonted efforts by the appearance of the virgin-warrior, the English were equally depressed, and trembled with apprehension of the probable effects of her enchantments. For months they had heard of the coming Maid, and by their watch-fires the tales of her miracles had paled many a battle-bronzed cheek with secret awe. The bravest recoil with terror from the approach of the supernatural. A herald from the Maid had already appeared before the English generals, and summoned them in the name of the Most High to surrender to her, the messenger of Heaven, the keys of the French cities which they had unjustly seized, and had menaced with the signal judgment of God the captains and the men-at-arms, the archers and the foot-varlets, if they did not break up their camp and retire from the leaguer of Orleans. She now sent a similar message, and when the English threatened to burn her heralds, resolved to repeat the heavenly warning with her own voice ; and mounting one of the boulevards of the town within hearing of the Tourelles, she addressed the English, and bade them depart lest they should be overwhelmed with shame and woe. The English at this post were commanded by Sir William Gladsdale, who replied by bidding her go home and milk her cows, and by lewd jests that moved the Virgin even to bitter tears. But unseemly jokes could not shake the fatal influence which the magic of superstition exercised over the minds of the soldiery, and four days later, when she marched out to meet and escort into the town a convoy of military stores and provisions, they suffered her to execute her task unimpeded, and shrank in shame behind the ranges of their earthworks. 17. On the afternoon of the same day, Dunois, to whom and"], [166, "138 SIEGE OF ORLEANS. nis compeers the Maid wisely entrusted the direction of every military movement, had seized a favourable occasion to attack the English bastile of St. Loup, and found himself confronted by a gallant resistance. Joan was reposing at home, when suddenly the heavenly Voices throbbed upon her soul, and seizing her arms, she donned her shining armour, mounted her horse, and rode towards the melee. In her haste she had for gotten her banner. She rode back for it, and received it from the window to avoid dismounting ; galloped hastily to the gate whence the sortie had been essayed, and met some of the wounded Orleannais on their way from the fight. \" Ha ! \" she exclaimed, \" I can never see French blood flow without my hair standing on end.\" Next she found herself in the roll and rush of the discomfited Orleannais, flying back to the town in haste. Waving her banner, and uttering words of inspiration and encouragement, she rallied the fugitives, and placing her self at their head, led them again to the assault. The English \\vere daunted at the sight of the Sorceress, and their hearts failing them, St. Loup was carried by storm, and its defenders put to the sword, except some few rescued by the hands of Joan herself. The heat of the combat over, Joan's woman-heart beat with gentle sympathy at the sight of the dead and dying ; and her tearful sorrow was augmented when she reflected that these were Christian men who had perished \" unhousell'd, unanointed, unanneal'd.\" 18. The next day, the Feast of the Ascension, was passed in prayer. On the following a fierce attack was made by the besieged \u2014 who were now, probably, equal or superior in number to the besiegers \u2014 on the bastiles on the south bank of the river. Crossing the Loire in boats, they scaled the defences manfully, and after a fierce hand-to-hand fight, in which the Maid was wounded in the heel, captured the English bastiles of the Augustins and St. Jean de Blanc, so that the Tourelles was the only fort on the south untaken. The importance of this post was known by both antagonists, and the French were also aware that the Duke of Bedford had despatched a strong reinforce ment to the English, under Fastolfe, whose arrival would greatly imperil the advantages they had gained. It was, therefore, resolved to assault the Tourelles without delay, while the French were still hot with the fervour of enthusiasm, and the presence"], [167, "139 THE LAST ASSAULT. of the Holy Maid nerved them to desperate deeds. Dunois was not unaware of the difficulty of the enterprise. The tete-du pont was protected landward by a lofty rampart, and the defences were manned by 500 of the flower of the English army, com manded by Sir John Gladsdale, one. of its most experienced veterans. 19. Early on the morning of the 7th of May the bells were rung and the mass was sung by the Virgin's orders, and the French soldiers having attended the confessional, crossed the river in boats, and cheerily assailed the bulwark of the Tourelles \" with light hearts and heavy hands.\" They met, however, with a stout defence. Battle-axes swung lustily, swords shone fatally, and as the Maid began to mount the first ladder raised against the wall, a bolt from an English bow pierced her corselet, and wounded her severely between the neck and shoulder. Before the English could leap from the battlement and seize her person she was borne to the rear. Laid upon the grass, and her armour removed, at the sight of her blood and with the agony of her hurt she began to weep ; but recovering herself, as if by some sudden inspiration from heaven, she sat up, drew the arrow from the wound with her own hands, and having dressed it with a little oil, betook herself to prayer. 20. Meanwhile, the assault had not gone favourably for the French, and Dunois had lost so many men that he gave orders for the retreat to be sounded. Joan sent for him and the other captains, and bade him not despair. \" By my God,\" she cried, \" ye shall soon enter in there ! Do not doubt it ! When ye see my banner once more wave upon the w7all, charge home, for the fort is yours ! \" She led the French in another and more desperate assault. Her banner reached the wall, for the English w'ere dismayed at her reappearance, and her followers imme diately clambered up the scaling-ladders, and broke into the fort. Another body, issuing from Orleans, attacked it on the north side, and Gladsdale, to concentrate his troops, determined upon abandoning the tete-du-pont and retiring into the Tourelles. With this object in view he strode along the drawbridge that linked the two defences. Joan from the bulwark descried him, and exclaimed, \" Surrender thou to the King of Heaven ! Oh, Glacidas (Gladsdale), thou didst me a foul wrong with thy foul speech, but I have great pity on thy soul and the souls of thy"], [168, "140 SIEGE OF ORLEANS. men!\" He continued his way in contemptuous indifference, when a cannon-shot from the town smote the drawbridge into fragments, and Gladsdale, falling into the Loire, was sunk by the weight of his armour. His death terminated the struggle. The remainder of his followers surrendered, and Joan returned into Orleans with the pomp of a conqueror. Blithe music sprang suddenly from every clanging spire ; the streets broke into a festal blaze ; crowds startled the night with the sounds of their unwonted merriment, for they felt that Orleans was saved. And on the following morning, the Orleannais pressing upon their walls and gathering on the river bank, saw the live flames leaping up from the great sorts of the London and the St. Lawrence, and the stores and munitions of the English camp. Suffolk led off his men in admirable order, but in sullen discon tent, drawing them up in full battle-array for awhile, as if inviting the French to try their fortunes in the open field. But Joan forbade an attack. It was Sunday, and a day of praise and prayer; and when the English were vanishing beyond the distant hills, and the gleam of their lances could only be faintly seen, the Champion-Maid passed in solemn procession round the city walls, and all knelt in thanksgiving to God for the deliver ance of Orleans. 21. Thus was accomplished the rescue of the French monarchy. The English protracted the war for many years, but never again with any prospect of ultimate success, and in 1452 were finally compelled to abandon all their possessions save Calais, leaving both nations to employ the strength which they had wasted in a century of war in developing their internal resources, and extending the bounds of their commercial enter prise. With the capture of Orleans Joan of Arc had realised the first part of her prophecy. She hastened to fulfil it to the last letter. In three months' time, after the battle of Patay, and the capture of Auxerre, Troyes, and Chalons, she led the Dauphin to Rheims, and in its great cathedral stood, banner in hand, while he was anointed and crowned Charles VII.. King of France. Then, kneeling at his feet, \" Gentle king,\" she exclaimed, \" the will of God is now fulfilled.\" She felt that her work was ended ; her mission accomplished. \" I would wish,\" she said to Dunois, \" that I might now return to my father and mother, to watch their sheep and cattle, and live at"], [169, "JOAN OF ARC CAPTURED, CONDEMNED, AND BURNT. 141 my own free will.\" She had had a presentiment that her career would be brief as it was glorious : at its commencement she bad said, \" Make use of me at once ; I shall last but a year, or little more.\" Now she longed for the green hills and pleasant dales of Lorraine ; but Charles and his captains had derived too much advantage from her presence to be willing to lose her. So she continued with the arm}', though no longer animated by the old inspiration. The sacred sword from Fierbois was broken on the march, and the charm seemed to have disappeared. You cannot hire out enthusiasm, which is heaven's most precious gift, by the year and the day ; and Joan of Arc having accom plished her predestined mission, w7as no longer what she had been. In an attack on Paris, September, 1429, she was severely wounded. In the following year she threw herself into Com piegne, which wras invested by the Burgundians, and at first her presence seemed to have brought victory to the standards of the beleaguered, but in a sally, on the 24th of May, she was taken prisoner, and committed for safety to Crotoy, on the coast of Flanders. In the following November the English obtained her, on payment of a large sum of money, from John of Luxem bourg, and brought her before an ecclesiastical court at Rouen, on a charge of witchcraft and sorcery. On the 30th of May, 1431, she was burnt alive in the market-place ; but her death, if it disproved the Divine origin of her mission, did not restore supremacy in France to the English arms.

The capture of Constantinople by the Turks, in 1453, alarmed all Europe with the presence of a danger which had long been anticipated, but never guarded against. When the voice of the muezzin was heard from the minarets of the Mosque, and the caciques of the Sultan threaded the gleaming waters of the Golden Horn, the potentates of Christendom at last awoke to the conviction that a day of peril was at hand. As the Goths and the Huns, the fierce children of the North, had rolled in the early days of the Christian centuries their resistless tides of conquest over the fairest lands of Europe, so. now it was apprehended that no bulwark could successfully withstand the torrent of invasion that was gathering up from the East. The danger was great, but not so terrible or so imminent as the fears of men repre sented. It was great, and not wholly averted until the shock of Sobieski's lances drove the discomfited Moslems from the walls of Vienna ; but a fairer fate was reserved for Christendom than to fall under the sanguinary thraldom of the Crescent. 3. The danger to be apprehended from the capture of Con stantinople was great, but far greater were the advantages which that memorable event bestowed upon Europe. The very menace which the Moslem capital constituted demanded the constant vigilance of Austria, and prevented that power from devoting all its energies to the suppression of the Lutheran creed. Moreover, the dispersion of the Greek scholars, with their valu able manuscripts, stimulated the activity of European intellect. The influence of the Greek and Roman classics awakened a love of letters which had long lain dormant, and the pen began to be wielded by stalwart hands, which, under other circumstances, might have grasped the conqueror's sword. Luther might have been the prophet of a new Crusade, and Gustavus Adolphus have perished in the sands of Syria, had not the fall of Constan tinople opened up to Europe the rich and long-lost treasures of classical knowledge. \" The better of the late Byzantine emperors,\" says Schlegel, \" particularly some of the Pal\u00e6ologi, had cultivated the sciences, and, by their love and encourage ment of learning, had given a new life to literature. Even in the period immediately preceding the fall and conquest of Con stantinople, many Greeks had taken refuge in Italy, particularly during the various attempts made to bring about the re-union of the Greek with the Roman Church \u2014 attempts, however, which,"], [173, "INFLUENCE OF GREEK LEARNING. 145 with the exception of a small number of individuals who went over to the Catholic Church, were not attended with any general success. In Italy the Greek fugitives established schools for their own language and literature, and founded libraries ; and if in the time of Petrarch few Italians could be named that were conversant with that language and literature (and among these zealous promoters of Greek learning Boccaccio must be included with himself), Florence, now under the Medici, the first Cosmo, and Lorenzo the Great, became a flourishing seminary of Grecian letters and erudition ; and at Rome, also, the house of Cardinal Bessarion was a true Platonic academy of science. Even the study of the ancient Roman writers received a new stimulus, and was prosecuted with a more classical taste and spirit. Courtly literati, and Latin poets formed on the old classical models ; political writers in the Latin tongue, which was still the language of diplomacy ; statesmen and politicians of the greatest influence, trained up in the school of Greek and Roman history and politics ; and polite dilettanti of Pagan antiquity \u2014 all now gave the tone to this new and second epoch in the intel lectual culture of Europe. But the ruling spirit and tone of the age proceeded mainly from the revival of the ancient literature and learning of the Greeks.\" 4. When Constantine the Great, having crushed the last enemy who opposed his power, and revived in his person the glories of the most successful of the C\u00e6sars, looked around for a capital worthy of his new empire, and fit to become the mistress of the East, his gaze naturally rested on the confines of Europe and Asia, where he might establish a watch-tower overlooking the Christians of the one continent and the Pagans of the other. No place seemed better to answer the conditions his sagacity imposed than the city founded by Byzas, a Greek adventurer, 656 years before the Christian era, and afterwards rebuilt and fortified by the Spartan Pausanias, who had recovered it from its Persian conquerors. It is situated on seven hills, sloping gently on the west towards the shore of the Bosphorus \u2014 the channel which pours the waters of the Euxine into the bosom of the Mediterranean. The northern slope is kissed by the glittering waves of the Golden Horn, a curving arm of the Thracian strait ; the southern faces the Propontis or Sea of Marmora. It is the very Queen of the Sea \u2014 the City of the Waters. \" If, being in the noisiest mart L"], [174, "146 CAPTURE OF CONSTANTINOPLE. of Stamboul,\" says the author of \" Eothen,\" \" you would stroll to the quiet side of the way, amidst those cypresses opposite, you will cross the fathomless Bosphorus ; if you would go from your hotel to the bazaars, you must pass by the bright blue pathway of the Golden Horn, that can carry a thousand sail of the line. You are accustomed to the gondolas that glide among the palaces of St. Mark; but here, at Stamboul, it is a 120-gun ship that meets you in the street. Venice strains out from the steadfast land, and in old times would send forth the Chief of the State to woo and wed the reluctant sea ; but the stormy bride of the Doge is the willing slave of the Sultan : she comes to his feet with the treasures of the world ; she bears him from palace to palace ; by some unfailing witchcraft she entices the breeze to follow her and fan the pale cheek of her lord ; she lifts his armed navies to the very gates of his garden ; she watches the walls of his Serail ; she stifles the intrigues of his ministers ; she quiets the scandal of his courts \u2014 so vast are the wonders of the deep ! \" 5. But not only is it thus courted by the treasure-giving sea ; air and earth equally rejoice to enrich with their best blessings the favoured city. Bland and genial is the climate ; neither too enervating for the stalwart Frank, nor too rough for the supple Asiatic. The soil is fertile, and teems with willing harvests. Close the gates of the Hellespont and the Bosphorus, and still from its own neighbourhood the city can supply itself with abundant stores. The waters are thronged with fish ; the sea coasts of Thrace and Bithynia gleam with vineyard and garden, and breadths of tawny corn. Its admirable position as the com mercial centre of two continents, its natural advantages of defence, the classic and historic ground of the immortals whereon it gazes from its noble hills, its climate, its soil, its command of the seas, all these are considerations which amply justify the prescience of Constantine in selecting Byzantium as the seat of the Eastern empire, and still exeite the cupidity of modern rulers ; but the capital of a world-wide sovereignty required a sacred origin \u2014 needed to be consecrated by a mysterious interest \u2014 and tradition asserts that its founder was inspired by a vision from heaven. As he slept within the walls of Byzan tium, he saw, in his dream, the tutelar genius of the city suddenly transformed from an aged and decrepid matron to a virgin blooming with youth and beauty, whom his own hands"], [175, "FOUNDATION OF CONSTANTINOPLE. 147 adorned with the imperial symbols. He accepted the augury, and made of Byzantium the capital which he proudly entitled the New or Second Rome, but which the moderns recognise by the founder's name, Constantinopolis, or the City of Constantine ; and the Turks as Istamboul, a corruption of the haughty Greek uc; rni' 7roAiv. 6. \" The master of the Roman world,\" says Gibbon, \" who aspired to erect an eternal monument of the glories of his reign, could employ in the prosecution of that great work the wealth, the labour, and all that yet remained of the genius of obedient millions. Some estimate may be formed of the expense bestowed with imperial liberality on the foundation of Constantinople, by the allowance of about \u00a32,500,000 for the construction of the walls, the porticoes, and the aqueducts. The forests that over shadowed the shores of the Euxine, and the celebrated quarries of white marble in the little island of Proconnesus, supplied an inexhaustible stock of materials, ready to be conveyed, by the convenience of a short water-carriage, to the harbour of Byzan tium. A multitude of labourers and artificers urged the conclu sion of the work with incessant toil; but the impatience of Constantine soon discovered that, in the decline of the arts, the skill as well as numbers of his architects bore a very unequal proportion to the greatness of his designs. The magistrates of the most distant provinces were therefore directed to institute schools, to appoint professors, and by the hopes of rewards and privileges to engage in the study and practice of architecture a sufficient number of ingenious youths who had received a liberal education. The buildings of the new city were executed by such artificers as the reign of Constantine could afford, but they were decorated by the hands of the most celebrated masters of the age of Pericles and Alexander. To revive the genius of Phidias and Lysippus surpassed, indeed, the power of a Roman emperor ; but the immortal productions which they had bequeathed to posterity were exposed without defence to the rapacious vanity of a despot. By his commands the cities of Greece and Asia were despoiled of their most valuable orna ments. The trophies of memorable wars, the objects of religious veneration, the most finished statues of the gods and heroes, of the sages and poets, of ancient times, contributed to the splendid triumph of Constantinople ; and gave occasion to the remark of l 2"], [176, "148 CAPTURE OF CONSTANTINOPLE. the historian Cedrenus, who observes, with much enthusiasm, that nothing seemed wanting except the souls of the illustrious men whom these admirable monuments were intended to repre sent. But it is not in the city of Constantine, nor in the declining period of an empire, when the human mind was depressed by civil and religious slavery, that we should seek for the souls of Homer and of Demosthenes.\" 7. Such was the famous and imperial city which for more than eleven centuries (a.d. 323\u20141453) remained the capital of the Eastern empire, witnessing its glory, its gradual decline, and final extinction. It was first menaced by the aggressive power of Islam in 66S, when the Arabian followers of Mahomet began a siege \u2014 or rather blockade \u2014 which endured for seven years. A greater peril impended over it in 716, when the combined forces of the Caliph Waled, under his son Moslems, invested it by sea and land. Having repulsed this formidable attack, the Greeks in their turn became the assailants, and derived a potent advantage from their knowledge of the inex tinguishable fire which so long remained a mystery and a wonder. In the tenth century the decline of the Mahometan power enabled them to assert their supremacy over Syria, and to plant their victorious standards upon the banks of the cele brated Euphrates. But the grasping hand could not retain its clutch, and the real results of their triumphant enterprise were Cilicia and Antioch. At the close of the tenth century, when Christian Europe was patiently expecting the last hours of the dying world, the Greek emperors, less occupied by thoughts of an approaching millennium, could boast of a dominion extending over the greatest part of Naples and Sicily, the whole European territories of the Ottomans, Anatolia or Asia Minor, Armenia, and the coast of Syria. 8. But a new race or nation of Turks now crossed the ancient Iaxartes, and under the leadership of Togrol Bek, the founder of the Seljukian dynasty, spread themselves over the rich pas toral land of Persia, and broke into Christendom on the side of Armenia. Henceforth we have to trace the rapid decline of the Greek empire. Alp Arslan defeated and took prisoner the emperor Romanus Diogenes (a.d. 1071), and his successors achieved the entire conquest of Asia Minor. At this epoch the advance of the Moslems received a temporary check from the"], [177, "PROGRESS OF THE OTHMANS. 149 shock of the First Crusade, and with the help of the Franks the emperor Alexius Comnenus recovered the Asiatic coast, and occupied anew the important passes of Bithynia. This was a gleam of prosperity, transient as brilliant. The Greeks might have withstood the Turks, but they were weakened by their own dissensions, and the siege of Constantinople by the Latins, under \" blind old Dandolo,\" in the Fourth Crusade (a.d. 1202), convulsed the empire by the force of the catastrophe. It was then parcelled out into several portions, and a Latin emperor reigned on the throne of the immortal Constantine (a.d. 1204 \u2014 1261), only to be deposed with ignominy in less than sixty years from the creation of the new realm. 9. Meanwhile, the Seljukian Turks had been overthrown by the descent of the Karismians from the shores of the Caspian, aud these, in their turn, had been prostrated by the onrush of the Moguls, who, under the sons of Zingis Khan, poured from the extreme regions of Tartary over the fairest plains of Asia. They swept away the mimic authority which still maintained a phantom caliphate at Bagdad, and reduced under their sway the Seljukian dynasties of Persia, Syria, and Iconium. From the latter kingdom the Turks retired into the mountains, and established several independent principalities. The chief of one of these, named Othman, penetrated in 1299 into Bithynia, where his descendants still remain. 10. It was these Othmans, or Ottomans, that a faction of the Byzantines invited into Europe (a.d. 1341) about the middle of the fourteenth century, and who settled themselves in the neighbourhood of Constantinople. During the reign of Amu rath I., a prince of great vigour of mind and body, they sub dued the whole province of Romania, or Thrace, from the kindling waters of the Hellespont to the snowy crests of Mount, H\u00e6mus, and placed their royal seat and the throne of their kings at Adrianople. Bajazet, the successor of Amurath, went yet farther, and invested by sea and land the empire city of the Greeks (a.d. 1396). To obtain succour in this terrible agony, the Emperor Manuel hastened to the various courts of Europe, and during his absence his capital was saved \u2014 not by a friend (as Hallam remarks), but by a power more formidable to her enemies than herself. The Tartars, or Moguls, identical with the Scythians of the ancient world, who had invaded Persia"], [178, "150 CAPTURE OF CONSTANTINOPLE. under the sons of Zingis Khan, and prostrated Russia, were now commanded by the famous Timar, or Tamerlane, the most remarkable of the Asiatic heroes. Animated by his fiery and ambitions spirit they had spread their sway and extended the fame of their prince from the Mediterranean to the Ganges. Sixty-three years of glory did not suffice him, and the reports of the growing success of the arms of Bajazet impelled him to lead his hosts against the Turkish sovereign. The danger recalled Bajazet from Constantinople into Anatolia. He con fronted his foe on the memorable plain of Angora. Treachery weakened his arms ; his genius was rebuked by the superiority of the great Mogul ; and, unhappily for his fame, he died not on the field he lost. The Moguls advanced to the shores of the Propontis, and Bajazet lingered for nine weary months a captive (a.d. 1402), after the ignominy of exposure in an iron cage. 11. The Moguls soon withdrew from Anatolia, but neverthe less some twenty years elapsed before the Ottoman monarchy regained its pristine vigour. Then, under Amurath II., it recommenced its aggressive career, and once more the walls of Constantinople beheld the baleful radiance of the Crescent. As yet, however, its hour had not come. The enemy was repulsed, and Constantine, the last of the Emperors of the East, succeeded to a tottering throne. He was worthy, from the virtues of his character and the qualities of his mind, of a better fate. 12. In the year 1451 Mahomet II. became Sultan of the Turks. He had been liberally educated, and his natural genius improved and enriched by careful culture. It is said that he spoke or understood five languages \u2014 Arabic, Persian, Chaldean, Latin, and Greek. He was familiar with the geography of the world ; with the lives of the heroes of the East ; with the principles of astrology ; and the arts of the sculptor and the painter. Early inured to warfare, he was a successful soldier, if not an able general ; and the conquest of two empires, twelve kingdoms, and two hundred cities, is attributed to his invincible sword. From the hour that he ascended the throne, he resolved upon the conquest of Constantinople, whose spires and towers across the narrow Hellespont constantly inflamed the desires of every true believer. At Asomaton, about five miles from the Greek metropolis, he erected a formidable castle, which, with the fortress raised by his grandfather on the opposite shore, com-"], [179, "THE DANGER AT HAND. 151 pletely commanded the strait. To the remonstrance of the Greek emperor he returned a haughty answer; but when Con stantine endeavoured to arouse the spirit of his subjects \u2014 to unsheath the sword \u2014 to attack without delay the aggressive foe, he was met by the indifference of the incredulous and the lethargy of the timid. 13. In the following spring those who had doubted were only too fatally convinced, and those who had feared found their worst apprehensions more than justified by the reality. Mahomet had spent the winter in the most formidable preparations \u2014 in casting cannon under the superintendence of an Hungarian renegade; in gathering and training his immense hosts; in collecting a vast quantity of military stores. Christendom was still supine \u2014 Constantinople slept \u2014 the Turk only was awake. Having subdued every town and village in its neighbourhood which still acknowledged the superiority of the Greek emperor, Mahomet began the siege of Constantinople on the 6th of April, 1453, with an army of 258,000 troops, and a fleet of 320 sail. 14. And how was the sacred city, the New or Second Rome, prepared to resist this overwhelming force ? Of trained men, capable of bearing arms, only 4,970 Romans, and of foreign auxiliaries only 2,000, under the command of John Justiniani, a noble Genoese, to whom the island of Lemnos was promised as a reward in case of victory. A strong chain barred the mouth of the harbour, and behind it were stationed some Greek and Italian vessels of war and merchandise ; and the ships of every Christian nation that arrived from Candia or the Black Sea were detained for the public service. Against the whole power of the Ottomans a city of the extent of perhaps thirteen or six teen miles was defended by seven or eight thousand soldiers ; and while all Europe and Asia were open to the besiegers, no supplies or succour could be expected by the besieged. Nor were they animated by any patriotic enthusiasm. In their last hours of empire they gave themselves up to religious discord, anathematising the creed and priests of the Latins, from whom, nevertheless, they demanded assistance. The fate of Constanti nople may be accepted as a warning by every nation which, in cultivating the luxurious arts of peace, neglects the austere virtues of war \u2014 which yields up its manhood to enervating indul gences, and prefers the accumulation of wealth and inglorious"], [180, "152 CAPTURE OF CONSTANTINOPLE. ease to the practice of honour and the worship of the heroism of its fathers. For such there comes no second birth, no happy resurrection. It perishes not alone by the sword of the oppressor, but by the vices of its sons. 15. The last defence of Constantinople, nevertheless, was not unmarked by heroic deeds ; and the Emperor Constantine dis played a firmness and a courage worthy of his great namesake \u2014 the founder of the imperial city now gasping in the agonies of death. With volleys of lances and arrows, with destructive showers of the inextinguishable fire, with the balls of musketry and cannon, he repulsed his besiegers, and smote into ruins the works with which they sought to cover their advance. But his stores soon became exhausted ; while the Turkish artillery hurled at the walls a storm of heavy shot. The mines which Mahomet planned were countermined by the resolute Greeks ; but a new device, or rather a new adaptation of one of the engines of anti quity, baffled for a time their ingenuity. This was a wooden tower, moved upon rollers, and protected by a triple covering of bulls' hides. From its loop-holes incessant volleys w?ere securely discharged. In the front, three doors admitted the alternate sally and retreat of the workmen and soldiers. They ascended by a staircase to the upper platform, and as high as the level of that platform a scaling ladder could be raised by pulleys to form a bridge, and grapple with the adverse rampart. By these various arts of annoyance, the tower of St. Romanus was at length overthrown, and the Turks prepared to assail the breach. But great was their astonishment the next morning to find their wooden turret reduced to a heap of embers, and the tower of St. Romanus repaired, and apparently entire. Mahomet deplored the failure of his design, and uttered, says Gibbon, a profane exclamation, that the word of the 37,000 prophets should not have compelled him to believe that such a work, in so short a time, could have been accomplished by the infidels. 16. The sole succour which reached the Greeks from Chris tendom during this memorable siege was afforded by five ships, four of which were Genoese, laden with wine, oil, wheat, and barley for the service of the capital. They gallantly fought their way through the Turkish fleet of 300 galleys, despite the encouragement which the presence of Mahomet on the sea-beach afforded to his seamen. With the almost incredible loss of"], [181, "PROGRESS OF THE SIEGE. 153 12,000 men, the latter fled in disorder to the shores of Europe and Asia ; while the Christian squadron, triumphant and unharmed, steadily rode along the Bosphorus, and anchored in security within the chain of the harbour. Mahomet now perceived that the city could only be taken by a combined attack from the harbour and the land ; but to force a passage into the harbour, whose mouth was so strongly defended, seemed impossible. In this emergency the Turkish Sultan resolved upon a plan which only a daring intellect could have conceived, and only the most indefatigable firmness could accomplish. From the Bosphorus, across the land \u2014 a distance of ten miles \u2014 he raised a broad and level platform of solid timber, and transported upon rollers, by the agency of their swelling canvas, and the labour of willing men, eighty-four galleys and brigantines into the shallow waters of the harbours, where the heavy ships of the Greeks could not approach to molest them. It is said, but it may be doubted, that the task was accomplished in a single night ; and though comparatively easy with the appliances of modern science, must be considered, notwithstanding the small size of the Ottoman vessels, a surprising example of the Sultan's resolu tion and energy. 17. After a siege of forty days, the fall of Constantinople could no longer be protracted. The emperor had endeavoured to obtain terms of negociation ; but the ambition of Mahomet was irrevocably fixed upon the possession of the imperial city. On the other hand, the last of the Pal\u00e6ologi was unwilling, from a sense of honour, and the fear of universal reproach, to resign it into the hands of the Ottomans, and determined to abide the last extremities of war. The Sultan, guided by his astrologers, appointed the 29th of May for the final assault, and prepared his soldiers, by the most artful appeals to their fanaticism, and by dazzling promises of unlimited plunder. He succeeded in arousing the spirit he desired, and the Moslem camp re-echoetl with shouts of \" Allah il Allah ! \" and glowed with the blaze of a thousand nocturnal fires. Among the Greeks prevailed a deep and general despair, and they deplored with tears the guilt which had exposed them to the coming doom. A solemn procession of the image of the Virgin was unable to rouse them from their despondency, and only Constantine himself, and the noblemen his chiefs and allies, were prepared to meet their fate with"], [182, "154 CAPTURE OF CONSTANTINOPLE. Christian heroism. \" They wept,\" says Gibbon ; \" they em braced ; regardless of their families and fortunes, they devoted their lives ; and each commander, departing to his station, main tained all night a vigilant and anxious watch on the rampart. The emperor and some faithful companions entered the dome of St. Sophia \u2014 which in a few hours was to be converted into a mosch \u2014 and devoutly received, with tears and prayers, the sacrament of the Holy Commnnion. He reposed some moments in the palace, which resounded with cries and lamentations ; solicited the pardon of all whom he might have injured ; and mounted on horseback to visit the guards, and explore the motions of the enemy. The distress and fall of the last Con stantine are more glorious than the long prosperity of the Byzantine C\u00e6sars.\" 18. At daybreak on the twenty-ninth of May,* in the one thousand four hundred and fifty -third year of the Christian era, Mahomet's forces advanced to the assault, mustering to the number of 250,000 enthusiastic warriors. By land and sea the assault was made, and by the eighth hour of the day Mahomet entered the gate of St. Romanus a conqueror. The Roman empire of the East had fallen ; and the Moslem taken up that position on the frontiers of Christendom from whence they have never since been driven. \" Upon the first appearance of the day,\" says Knolles, \" Mahomet gave the sign appointed for the general assault, whereupon the city w-as in a moment, and at one instant on every side, most furiously assaulted by the Turks. The Chris tians with no less courage withstood the Turkish fury, beating them down again with great stones and weighty pieces of timber, and so overwhelmed them with shots, darts, and arrows, and other hurtful devices from above, that the Turks, dismayed with the terror thereof, were ready to retire. \" Mahomet, seeing the great slaughter and discomfiture of his men, sent in fresh supplies of his janizaries and best men of war, whom he had for that purpose reserved as his last hope and refuge ; by whose coming on his fainting soldiers were again encouraged, and the terrible assault begun afresh. At which time the barbarous king ceased not to use all possible means to maintain the assault ; by name calling upon this and that * The fifty-third day of the siege."], [183, "THE FINAL ATTACK. 155 captain, promising to some whom he saw forward golden moun tains, and unto others in whom he saw any sign of cowardice, threatening most terrible death ; by which means the assault became most dreadful, death there raging in the midst of many thousands. And albeit that the Turks lay dead by heaps upon the ground, yet other fresh men pressed on still in their places over their dead bodies, and with divers event either slew or were slain by their enemies. \" In this so terrible a conflict, it chanced Justinianus the general to be wounded in the arm, who, losing much blood, cowardly withdrew himself from the place of his charge,* not leaving any to supply his room, and so got into the city by the gate called Romana, which he had caused to be opened in the inner wall ; pretending the cause of'his departure to be for the binding up of his wound, but being, indeed, a man now altogether discouraged. \" The soldiers there present, dismayed with the departure of their general, and sore charged by the janizaries, forsook their stations, and in haste fled to the same gate whereby Justinianus was entered ; with the sight whereof, the other soldiers, dis mayed, ran thither by heaps also. But whilst they violently strive all together to get in at once, they so wedged one another in the entrance of the gate, that so few of great a multitude got in ; in which so great a press and confusion of minds, 800 persons were there by them that followed trodden under foot, or thrust to death. The emperor himself, for safeguard of his life, flying with the rest in that press, as a man not regarded, miserably ended his days, together with the Greek empire. His dead body was shortly after found by the Turks among the slain, and known by his rich apparel, f whose head being cut off, was forthwith presented to the Turkish tyrant, by whose com mandment it was afterward thrust upon the point of a lance, and in great derision carried about as a trophy of his victory, first in the camp, and afterwards up and down the city. \" The Turks, encouraged with the flight of the Christians, * This charge against Justiniani is repeated by Gibbon, but Finlay, in his \" History of the Greek Empire,\" labours, with some success, to prove it unfounded.

The horrors of a great city stormed and sacked by an exultant army of maddened fanatics may best be left to the imagination of the reader, though the historian of the \" Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire \" records them with a painful minuteness.

The gaze of the European first rested upon the green hills and pleasant valleys of the New World \u2014 the vast American continent whose glorious future no intellect can pretend to foretell \u2014 on Friday morning, the 12th of October, in the year of the Christian era 1492. 2. But neither the great voyager who saw with delight the glorious results of his daring enterprise, nor the patrons whose munificence had enabled him to accomplish it, comprehended the important consequences of this discovery of a New World. To the one it offered a prospect of wealth and power, of extended empire and enlarged commerce ; to the other, a noble occasion for the soldier of the Cross who, with crucifix in hand, and hope glowing at his heart, might gather the unhappy pagans of the unknown lands into the fold of the true Church. It seemed, indeed, that this discovery promised to Spain an enduring supremacy over the whole world. It seemed that this discovery gave up new regions to the ecclesiastical prince of Christendom. But an invention which as yet was but little estimated, whose mighty influence was comprehended by none, was to destroy the dreams of power indulged in by the ambitious king, and the visions of Catholic universality cherished by the enthusiastic voyager. The invention of Printing overthrew the airy castles constructed by Ferdinand of Spain and Christopher Columbus. The New World neither became Papist nor Spanish; and before three centuries had elapsed a Protestant common wealth of Anglo-Saxon lineage ruled its most fertile regions, and threatened, in the fulness of time, to extend its laws, lan guage, and religion over the entire continent. The Printing Press produced the Reformation, and but for the Reformation Charles V., armed with the inexhaustible treasures of America, would have crushed the liberties of Europe. 3. In this view, therefore, the discovery of the New World deserves to be ranked amongst the most memorable scenes in the drama of European history ; but we must also take into consideration the important outlet it afforded to the energies, the love of adventure, and the commercial tendencies of Europe."], [188, "160 DISCOVERT OF AMERICA BY COLUMBUS. Nor even then have we more than glanced at a few of its most interesting consequences. It has affected the balance of power in Europe ; reorganised its political system ; poured into its treasuries the gold of California; and opened up channels of enterprise which seem inexhaustible. The history of the Old World may be nearly finished, but that of the American con tinent is as yet unwritten ; and as to-day we trace the annals of England and France, of Germany and Spain, so shall future inquirers patiently investigate the wonderful fortunes of Canada, the States, Brazil, Mexico, or Guatemala ; and the seat of empire which now is placed by the waters of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic shall then overlook the billowy expanse of the vast Pacific ! _. This great discovery is due to a Genoese navigator, Chris topher Columbus, who enacted in reference to maritime discovery the splendid part which Luther, his contemporary, played in the Reformation of Religion. Columbus, or Colombo, as the name is written in Italian, was born in Genoa, about the year 1435, the eldest of the four children of Dominico Colombo, a wool-comber, and Susanna Fontanarossa, his wife. Most famous men in early life display the secret bias of their genius, and so evident was the partiality of the young Columbus for a seafaring career, that his education was nothing if not maritime. Besides the ordinary groundwork of reading, writing, arithmetic, and Latin grammar, he acquired a knowledge of drawing, and at the University of Pavia studied geometry, geography, navigation, and astronomy. At the age of fourteen he applied practically what he had learned theoretically, and joined the naval expedition fitted out at Genoa in 1459, to recover Naples to the sceptre of King Rene, Count of Provence, the poor and song-singing father of Margaret of Anjou. At this period a strong passion for maritime adventure had seized the bold spirits of Europe. It was part and parcel of that revival of learning which the dispersion of the treasures of knowledge, long imprisoned at Constantinople, had tended to promote ; and henceforth the path of fame for many was a career of enterprise on the restless sea. The gallant corsairs who, under John of Anjou, struggled for the crown of Naples, were the natural predecessors of the daring adventurers whose glancing lances, at a later period, overthrew the ancient thrones of the Incas of Peru and the caciques of Mexico."], [189, "A PORTRAIT OF A HERO. 161 5. An interval of cloud and shadow, and we next hear of the Genoese seaman cruising up and down the Mediterranean, at one time engaged in the peaceful pursuits of commerce, at another in devout and desolating expeditions against the infidels. But this was not a career calculated to call forth the best energies of his character. Accident, however, or the fame of Lisbon as a centre of geographical knowledge, attracted his footsteps thither about the year 1470. He was at that time in the glow of his vigorous manhood : a tall, well-formed, stately person, of an engaging presence, and gifted with the royal air of a man among men, born to command, and capable of great deeds. One always loves to know something of the features and physical characteristics of the world's heroes, and our readers, therefore, may accept with pleasure Wash ington Irving's portrait of Christopher Columbus : \u2014 \u25a0 \" His visage was long, and neither full nor meagre ; his complexion fair and freckled, and inclined to ruddy ; his nose aquiline ; his cheek bones were rather high ; his eyes light grey, and apt to enkindle ; his whole countenance had an air of authority. His hair, in his youthful days, was of a light colour; but care and trouble, according to Las Casas, soon turned it grey, and at thirty years of age it was quite white. He was moderate and simple in diet and apparel, eloquent in discourse, engaging and affable with strangers, and his amiableness and suavity in domestic life strongly attached his household to his person. His temper was naturally irritable ; but he subdued it by the magnanimity of his spirit, comporting himself with a courteous and gentle gravity, and never indulging in any intem perance of language. Throughout his life he was noted for strict attention to the offices of religion, observing rigorously the fasts and ceremonies of the Church ; nor did his piety con sist in mere forms, but partook of that lofty and solemn enthu siasm with which his whole character was strongly tinctured.\" 6. While at Lisbon, Columbus became acquainted with, and married, Dona Felipa, the dark-eyed daughter of one Bar tolomeo Monis de Peresletto, who, under the patronage of the deceased Prince Henry, the father of Modern Discovery, had colonised and governed the island of Porto Santo. His maps and charts falling into the hands of Columbus, awakened in his mind a train of thought which was fated to lead to great M"], [190, "162 DISCOVERY OF AMERICA BY COLUMBUS. results. Other circumstances contributed to feed it, until, from observing how much of the world remained unknown, he began to meditate how it might best be explored. Dreams of far-off islands, which nestled in perilous seas, had long haunted the minds of the adventurers ; and scholars, lost in the mists of speculation and fable, had mused with eager fondness upon the dim legends and uncertain hints scattered through the writings of the ancients. But while these floating suggestions, so to speak, may have helped to nourish the enthusiasm of the earnest seaman, his sagacity sought in science the surer grounds of the belief which had occupied his soul. He studied deeply, and meditated slowly on what he read ; and the Discovery of America is another proof that great ideas do not spring spon taneously, and by a sudden impulse, from the mind of genius, but are the result of long-continued thought and of an exhaus tive process of critical inquiry.* 7. Columbus at length arrived at the conclusion that, to dis cover the unknown earth, the voyager must sail westward. He based his conviction on three grounds : first, natural reason, or conclusions drawn from science ; secondly, the authority of the ancients ; and thirdly, the testimony of sailors, including popular rumours of land described in western voyages, and the evidence of relics which appeared to have floated from the other side of the Atlantic to European shores. The imagination of the poet had already arrived at a similar theory, and Pulci, in the \" Morgante Maggiore,\" had dared to prophesy : \u2014 \" His bark The daring mariner shall urge far o'er The western wave, a smooth and level plain, Albeit the earth is fashioned like a wheel. Men shall descry another hemisphere : Since to one common centre all things tend, So earth, by curious mystery divine Well balanced, hangs amid the starry spheres. At our Antipodes are cities, states, And thronged empires, ne'er divined of yore. But see, the sun speeds on its western path, To glad the nations with expected light.\" t Of the vast continent, however, of which he actually became * In the Life of Columbus, by his son, are set forth the various stages of thought and study by which he arrived at his memorable conclusion. t This curious passage was first cited by Prescott, in his \" History of the Reisns of Ferdinand and Isabella.\" 5"], [191, "163 COLUMBUS THE ENTHUSIAST. he discoverer, Columbus had formed no idea. He expected to reach, beyond the rim of the western ocean, the oriental shores of Asia \u2014 the glowing regions of Cathay and the sunny islands of Antilla and Zipargo, painted in such lively hues by Mande ville and Marco Polo. When once a genius like that of Columbus is occupied by a noble conception, it colours the daily life, pervades with its subtle influence every thought, and warms with its heavenly fire every emotion. Columbus the seaman was transported into Columbus the Enthusiast, and a character originally grave and noble was exalted into something very pure and holy. He turned to his Bible with increased ardour, and read, or fancied that he read, in its inspired pages the prediction of the work he meditated. All the ends of the earth were to be brought together, and all the nations united in the praise of one Redeemer. No crusader had ever taken up the Cross with a more lively faith than the Genoese seaman to do battle against the hosts of heathendom. As Constantine saw in the heavens the gleaming symbol which announced the victory of his Christian warriors, so to the eyes of Columbus, distinct and visible, shone the Cross in the West, marshalling him thither ward with constant ray, until his soul repeated with devout belief the immemorial legend, Ev tovtw vtKr\\. 8. Inspired by his grand and all-absorbing idea, and strengthened in his conviction of its accuracy by his corre spondence with the famous cosmographer, Toscanelli, Colum bus, after his return from a voyage to Iceland, in 1477, laid his plans before the King of Portugal, John II. Know ing the anxiety of that adventurous monarch to accom plish a passage by sea to India, he obtained an audience of him, and proposed, if furnished with ships and men, to undertake a shorter and more direct route than that which Portuguese enterprise had opened up along the coast of Africa. The monarch was so impressed by the force of his arguments that he referred the proposal to a junto especially charged to examine matters relating to maritime discovery. This junto, composed of men who were only men of learning, and nothing more, bookworms and not philosophers, pronounced the scheme a visionary one. John, not yet satisfied, referred it to his Council in solemn conclave assembled \u2014 again to receive a con demnatory conclusion. The king's mind still continuing in- M 2"], [192, "164 DISCOVERY OF AMERICA BY COLUMBUS. fluenced by the discoverer's earnestness, the Bishop of Cento proposed that Columbus should be kept amused while a vessel was secretly despatched on the route he had indicated. A caravel was sent out with this unworthy object ; but the gods are not to be won by fraud. After reaching the Cape de Verde Islands she sailed westward for several days ; but meeting with stormy weather, and a wild expanse of heaving and tossing waters, the pilots grew faint of heart and put back to Portugal, ridiculing the project of Columbus as a madman's dream. Dis gusted at the deception practised on him, and his affection for Portugal weakened by the death of his wife, he quitted Lisbon towards the end of 1484, and repaired to the Court of Ferdi nand and Isabella, the Spanish sovereigns, with the fame of whose wisdom and enterprise all Europe rung from side to side. Meanwhile, he despatched his brother Bartholomew to Henry VII. of England, but that astute and narrow-minded prince treated his proposals with contemptuous indifference. 9. At the court of Madrid, Columbus was received with attention, but his proposals, referred to a council of ecclesiasti cal scholars and scientific savans, made no active progress. During this long delay he appears to have remained in attendance on the sovereigns, and occasionally accompanied them in their campaigns. His expenses were liberally dis bursed, and much deference and personal attention shown him. But the heart groweth sick if its cherished hope be long deferred. He pressed for a definite answer to his proposal, and received it \u2014 in a declaration that it was vain and chimerical. It is strange that men of science are always the foremost to resist innovation, and crush the spirit of free inquiry. Co lumbus attempted in other quarters to obtain a fair hearing. He had already made an unsuccessful application to the authorities of his native city of Genoa. He now addressed him self, but with equal ill fortune, to the powerful and opulent Dukes of Medina Sidonia and Medina Celi. Then, in a dull and dark despair, he prepared to betake himself to the court of France (a.d. 1491), but on his way was stopped by a summons from Ferdinand and Isabella, who, urged by some of their more enlightened councillors to reconsider his scheme, and left at liberty for other interests by the approaching conclusion of the Spanish war, consented to resume the negotiation with"], [193, "165 FAILURE OF NEGOTIATIONS. Columbus. Twenty thousand maravedis were furnished him to defray the expenses of his journey ; and clothed in suitable attire, and mounted on an ambling mule, he betook himself to the royal court at Sante Fe\\ 10. He arrived in time to witness the last scene in an event ful drama \u2014 the surrender by Boabdil, the last of the Moorish Kings, of the Keys of Granada, and the gleam and glitter of the Spanish chivalry within the desolate halls of the Alhambra. In that crowd of mailed warriors and exultant nobles the least among them was more conspicuous than the man who came to offer Spain the inexhaustible treasures of a New World, and the virgin beauties of an unexplored hemisphere. But his day of triumph was approaching. At first, indeed, the negotiations wore no favourable aspect. The terms which he demanded \u2014 the offices for himself and his heirs of admiral in all the lands and continents which he might discover or acquire in the ocean, and of viceroy and governor-general over those lands, and one-tenth of all the gains acquired either by trade or con quest \u2014 alarmed the courtiers by their dazzling arrogance, and the sovereigns were induced to refuse them. No solicitations, no probability of failure in this final attempt at negotiation could bend the haughty inflexibility of Columbus. He was conscious of a sublime mission, arid he moved among men with grave brow and silent lips, as if on an equality with emperors. Nay, more, could he not bestow empires to which the sovereignties of the old world were but as shadows and dwarfed phantoms ? Eighteen years had elapsed since the grand idea of his dis covery first flashed upon his mind ; but he was still as constant in his purpose, and unshaken in his faith, now, when once more mounted on ambling mule, tracking his road to Cordova, as when going over the maps and charts of Paulo Toscanelli. 11. Great minds make fast friends, and Columbus had potent allies in Luis de St. Angel, and Alonzo de Quintanilla, who now exercised their influence to the utmost to prevent Spain from losing the great discoverer's services. St. Angel addressed himself to Isabella in terms of moving eloquence. He expatiated on the grandeur of the projected enterprise ; on what it would achieve for the honour of the Church and the glory of God, and with how splendid a fame its successful accomplishment would crown the sovereigns who had dared to"], [194, "166 DI&COVERY OF AMERICA BY COLUMBUS. encourage it ; until the kindling intellect of the great queen for the first time recognised the scheme in its full proportions, and became its ardent patron. The king's treasury, it is true, was exhausted ; \" but,\" exclaimed Isabella, \" I undertake the enterprise for my own crown of Castile, and will pledge my jewels to raise the necessary funds.\" Henceforth her name was associated with that of Columbus in the discovery .of the New World, nor is she less entitled to our gratitude. While in every great invention we pay full honour to the inventor, let us not forget how much is due to the mind which first appreciated its value, and furnished the means by which it was wrought to a successful result. 12. At the foot of the mountain of Elvira a perilous defile opens upon a rushing and tumultuous stream, spanned by the bridge of Pinos. In the wars between the Christians and the Moors its waters had ofter run red with the blood of the dying. Columbus had reached this memorable spot, on his way to France, when he was overtaken by a courier, whose soiled garments and foam-bespattered steed bore witness to the haste with which he had ridden. He bore a message from the queen which induced Columbus to turn the head of his mule towards Santa Fe with the joyful alacrity of a man who feels that the hope of his life is upon the eve of a glorious fulfilment (April, 1492). 13. Preparations for the expedition were now pushed for ward with the utmost vigour. Orders were despatched to Seville and the other Andalusian ports to furnish the stores requisite for the voyage, free of duty, and at the lowest possible rate. Martin Alonzo Pinzon and his brother Vicenti Yafiez Pinzon, both navigators of great skill and courage, nobly offered \u2014 wherefore be their names immortal ! \u2014 to man and equip a vessel at their own cost. Two other vessels were seized by royal order, and their crews impressed \u2014 a proceeding rendered necessary by the reluctance of the seamen to embark on a voyage so perilous and desperate. The needful funds were furnished by the queen and partly by the noble Pinzons. Thus the expedition, in spite of the popular prejudice which sprang from ignorance and superstition, was ready for sea by the beginning of August. It consisted of three vessels, only one of which was decked, the Santa Maria, bearing the"], [195, "OUTWARD BOUND. 167 flag of Columbus, the Admiral ; the others were open boats, but built up high at the prow and stern, to furnish forecastles and cabins for the accommodation of the crew, \u2014 the Pinta, commanded by Martin Alonzo Pinzon, accompanied by his brother, Francisco Martin, as pilot ; and the Nina, under the third of the brothers, Vicenti Yafiez Pinzon. The officers and men on board the three ships numbered 120 persons only. Every preparation being completed, Columbus and his crew confessed themselves and partook of the Sacrament ; and on the morning of the 3rd of August, 1492, bidding adieu to the Old World, launched forth on the immeasurable waste of waters \u2014 \" To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths Of all the western stars ;\" \u2014 to smite the sounding furrows which never keel had ploughed before. 14. It is difficult for us, to whom the Atlantic has become a well-travelled highway, and the Pacific the battle -plain of nations \u2014 it is difficult for us to comprehend the emotions of the untutored and superstitious seamen of Spain when pressing forward, with \" puffing sail,\" into the vastness of what seemed an illimitable 6phere of sea. And the deeper must be our admiration of the matchless constancy and heroic firmness of the man who could repel the natural fears of his unwilling followers, and without the stimulus of sympathy or the encouragement of friendly confidence, persevere in his perilous task even to the end. He who has felt in his dreams the bitter agony of being driven by some superior force into a strange and unknown wilderness may understand the passions of the Spanish seamen, and reward with great admiration the calm courageous genius which refused to be affected by them, or shaken from its steadfast purpose. This is the heroism of a great mind, the daring of a noble soul. The soldier who mounts the deadly breach, or rides into a plump of hostile spears, is encouraged by the presence of a visible fame, and warmed by the fierce inspiration of the battle ; but for Columbus there was no consolation c:;cept in the conclusions of his com prehensive intellect; none undertood, few believed him. and most derided his enterprise, and censured his impious audacity. 15. On the 9th of September the three ships passed the last point of land, about nine leagues from Ferro, the farthest of the"], [196, "168 DISCOVERY OF AMERICA BY COLUMBUS. Canary Islands. Hitherto the crews had murmured but little. Now that they seemed to have passed beyond the limits of the world, their hearts failed them. For what did they not leave behind them ? Their fatherland, their home, the wife's caress, and the children's looks of love. What lay before them? An unknown ocean, dark with the shadows of mysterious peril. \" In the perturbation of the moment,\" says Washington Irving, \" they despaired of ever more seeing their homes. Many of the rugged seamen shed tears, and some broke into loud lamenta tions. The admiral tried in every way to soothe their distress, and to inspire them with his own glorious anticipations. He described to them the magnificent countries to which he was about to conduct them : the islands of the Indian seas, teeming with gold and precious stones ; the regions of Manji and Cathay, with their cities of unrivalled wealth and splendour. He promised them land and riches, and everything that could arouse their cupidity, or inflame their imaginations ; nor were these promises made for purposes of mere deception ; he certainly believed that he should realise them all.\" 16. He now issued orders to the Pinzons that in the event of any accidental separation, each ship should sail westward, and when 700 leagues had been accomplished, should lay by from midnight until daylight, as at about that distance he had convinced himself he should discover land. Meanwhile, to diminish the alarm of the crews at the vastness of the space intervening between them and the land, he kept two reckonings of his progress ; one, in secret, which contained a faithful record, and another open to the crew, in which a number of leagues were daily subtracted from the sailing of the ship. Circum stances were not wanting to augment the natural alarm of his seamen. On the 11th of September, at about one hundred and fifty leagues from Ferro, part of a mast was discovered which appeared to have belonged to a large vessel. On the 13th, the variation of the needle was first detected, and terribly increased the general sentiment of apprehension. If this faithful and unerring guide were about to fail them, whither were they to turn for succour or consolation ? Happily they were somewhat quieted by the plausible explanation suggested by Columbus that the variation was caused by the movement of the north star, which revolved daily round the north pole. The next day, their"], [197, "HOPE AND ALARM. 169 hopes of the near approach of land were excited by the appear ance of a heron and a water-wagtail (the rabo de junco of the Spaniards), neither of which is supposed to venture far out to sea. In the night a broad and lambent flame seemed to fall from the heaven into the waters ; and as for several successive days the trade winds wafted them across a tranquil ocean, they met with birds or patches of weeds which revived the hearts of the crew by seeming to indicate the proximity of land. But they alternated between hope and alarm with every hour. The cheering prospects opened up by the discovery of a tropical bird were clouded over by the steady persistence of the gentle eastern airs, and the unvarying calmness of the deep was regarded with awe and terror. 17. On the 1st of October, they were 770 leagues to the west of the Canaries, or 584 leagues as the crew supposed, and the prospect of success seemed as far off as ever to their incredulous minds. They began to cabal among themselves, and agreed that Columbus should be compelled by force to return to Spain, or, if he resisted, should be flung overboard, concluding that the death of an unsuccessful projector would scarcely arouse the curiosity of the powerful or the concern of the wealthy. Of his perilous position the great admiral was fully aware, but retained his usual composure ; sometimes endeavouring to stimulate their avarice by glowing descriptions of the wealth which would be their reward, and at others courageously menacing them with the vengeance of their sovereigns if they baffled this noble effort to promote the glory of God and exalt the authority of Spain. But speedily neither his promises nor his threats could repress the passions of his men. He had varied his course to the west south-west on the 7th of October, but apparently without any reasonable prospect of success. To prevent an outbreak ot mutiny he was now compelled to promise that if within three days land were not discovered, he would abandon his enterprise.\"* During these three eventful days the presages of approaching land became more numerous, but the seamen only regarded them as the enchantments of some evil magic luring them to their destruction ; and when, for the third time, the sun went down * Such is the statement of Oviedo, but it is confirmed by no other authority, and it seems improbable that a man like Columbus, so penetrated with a conviction of ultimate success, would have deferred to the threats of a mutinous crew."], [198, "170 DISCOVERY OF AMERICA BY COLUMBUS. upon a dim and shoreless horizon, they broke out into an open mutiny. Convinced that the prize was close at hand, Columbus was not to be discouraged or dismayed. He checked their clamour with haughty brow, and declared that as he had been commissioned by the sovereigns of Spain to seek the Indies, he would persevere until the object of his enterprise was attained. What might have been the issue of this contest between men and the man it is unnecessary to inquire ; for, happily, on the morning of the fourth day, the signs of the vicinity of the New World were too numerous and too significant to be disregarded by the most incredulous ; the branch of a thorn tree, a fragment of artificially carved board, a patch of river-weeds ; these were indications so bright and so auspicious, that from a tempest of doubt and anxiety the crew were transported into the sunshine of assured hope and sanguine expectation. 18. On the evening of the 11th of October, after the mariners of the admiral's ship had chanted the Salve Regina, or Vesper Hymn to the Virgin, Columbus addressed them in calm and encouraging words, reminding them of his order given on leaving the Canaries, not to make sail after midnight, when 700 leagues had been accomplished, and announced that he should now adopt that precaution. He directed a vigilant watch to be maintained all night, and promised to whomsoever should first discover land, a doublet of velvet, in addition to the pension which Ferdinand and Isabella had offered. The sails were furled, and the ships lay to. An interval followed of anxious expectation. Who, indeed, could sleep that night, when all were hovering, so to speak, on the very brink of a new and unknown world, which a few hours would throw open to the sword and cross of Europe ? The clouds which had con cealed it from civilised man \u2014 from the seers of Egypt, the philosophers of Greece, and the warriors of Rome \u2014 which scarcely even the prophetic eye of the poet had dared to pene trate \u2014 were fast gathering up in the hand of the All-Powerful, never again to be let loose upon the waters. So, silent and anxiously intent, the men hung over the frail bulwarks of their little vessel, eagerly waiting for the first ray of morning to fling its blessed radiance upon the promised land. 19. \" About two hours before midnight,\" says the historian of America, \"Columbus, standing ou the forecastle, observed a"], [199, "LAND ! LAND ! \u2014 THE NEW WORLD. 171 light at a distance, and privately pointed it out to Pedro Gut tierez, a page of the queen's wardrobe. Guttierez perceived it, and calling to Salcedo, comptroller of the fleet, all three saw it in motion, as if it were carried from place to place. A little after midnight, the joyful sound of Land! land! was heard from the Pinta, which kept always ahead of the otljer ships. But having been so often deceived by fallacious appearances, every man was now become slow of belief, and waited in all the anguish of uncertainty and impatience for the return of day. As soon as morning dawned, all doubts and fears were dispelled. From every ship an island was seen about two leagues to the north, whose flat and verdant fields, well stored with wood, and watered with many rivulets, presented the aspect of a delightful country. The crew of the Pinta instantly began the Te Deuni, as a hymn of thanksgiving to God, and were joined by those of the other ships with tears of joy and transports of congratulation. This offer of gratitude to. Heaven was followed by an act of justice to their commander. They threw themselves at the feet of Columbus, with feelings of self-condemnation, mingled with reverence. They implored him to pardon their ignorance, incredulity, and insolence, which had created him so much unnecessary disquiet, and had so often obstructed the prosecu tion of his well-concerted plan ; and passing, in the warmth of their admiration, from one extreme to another, they now pro nounced the man whom they had so lately reviled and threatened to be a person inspired by Heaven with sagacity and fortitude mor than human, in order to accomplish a design so far beyond the ideas and conception of all former ages. \" As soon as the sun arose, all their boats were manned and armed. They rowed towards the island with their colours dis played, with warlike music, and other martial pomp. As they approached the coast, they saw it covered with a multitude of people, whom the novelty of the spectacle had drawn together, whose attitudes and gestures expressed wonder and astonishment at the strange objects which presented themselves to their view. Columbus wTas the first European who set foot on the New World which he had discovered. He landed in a rich dress, and with a naked sword in his hand. His men followed, and, kneeling down, they all kissed the ground which they had so long desired to see. They next erected a crucifix, and, prostrating them-"], [200, "172 DISCOVERY OF AMERICA BY COLUMBUS. selves before it, returned thanks to God for conducting their voyage to such a happy issue.\" Arid, in like manner, the student who rightly appreciates the importance of the conse quences that have flowed from the discovery of America, will thank God for the happy issue of the enterprise, and cherish with grateful admiration the memory of the hero whose sublime constancy and noble self-reliance, under Providence, accom plished it."], [201, "POSTSCRIPT III.

But to many, the glowing pictures drawn by the cunning hand of Alphonse de Lamartine, the historian of the Girondists, may not be generally familiar, and we venture, therefore, with some of his splendid sketches to brighten and adorn our pages. 2. \" God hides himself in the processes of human affairs, and reveals himself in their completeness. No man of sense has ever denied that the great events which compose the life-history of humanity were knit together and secretly bound by an invisible thread suspended from the All-powerful hand of the Sovereign Ruler of the worlds, that they might combine in a design and a plan. Shall He who has given light to the eye be blind ? Shall he who has gifted his creature with thought be Himself without thought ? 3. \" The ancients named this hidden scheme, the absolute and resistless will of God in mundane things, Destiny, Fate ; the moderns call it Providence- \u2014 a more devout, more intelligible, and more paternal appellation. In studying the history of humanity, it is impossible not to recognise, everywhere and above everything, the free agency of man, the sovereign and apparent action of Providence. This action, as a whole and"], [202, "174 POSTSCRIPT III. in the abstract (d'ensemble et de masses), excludes in nothing the freedom of our movements, which make alone the morality of individuals and peoples ; it appears to leave them at liberty to move, act, and wander with complete latitude of intention, with an option of good or evil, in a certain sphere of action, and with a certain logical sequence of punishments incurred, or rewards merited, according as their meaning has been honest or wicked ; but the grand general results of these acts of individuals or peoples belong to God's will alone. Providence appears to reserve them, independently of us, for Divine ends, of which we are ignorant, and which it only permits us to discern when they are attained. Good and evil are of us and for us; but the Almighty makes use of our faults as of our virtues, and from this good and evil evolves, with an equal infallibility of wisdom, the accomplishment of His design upon humanity. The secret but divine instrument of this Providence, when it condescends to employ men for the preparation or working out of a part of its plans, is inspiration ! Inspiration is truly a human mystery, whose source it is difficult to find in man himself. It seems to come from on high and from afar. Therefore, we have given to it a name which is also mysterious, and which is not well defined in any language \u2014 Genius. Providence wills the birth of a man of genius : genius is a gift ; it may not be won by labour ; it is not even to be gained by virtue ; it is, or it is not; only he who possesses it can render an account of its nature and possession. To this genius Providence flashes an inspiration. Inspiration is to genius that which the lode stone is to the steel. It draws it to itself, independently of all conscience and all volition, towards something fatal and un known, like the pole. Genius follows the inspiration which masters it, and a moral or a physical world is found. Behold Christopher Columbus, and the discovery of America ! \" Such is the prologue with which Lamartine reveals the secret burthen of his drama, some of whose picturesque and animated scenes we proceed to reproduce. But first, for the chief actor : \u2014 4. \" In the springtime of the year 1471, and at noon of day, under a burning sun, which turned to ashes the roads of Anda lusia, upon a hill about half a league from the small seaport of Palos, two strangers fared a-foot, their shoes worn with walking,"], [203, "THE TWO STRANGERS. 175 their clothes, in which might be detected the remains of a cer tain costliness, sullied with dust, brows bathed with sweat, paused to seat themselves in the shadows of the gateway of a small monastery, called Santa Maria de Rabida. Their appearance and weariness mutely but eloquently implored hospitality. At that epoch the convents of the Franciscans were the hostelries of pedestrian travellers whose poverty closed to them other asylums. This group of the two strangers attracted the attention of the monks. 5. \" One of them was a man who had scarcely reached the middle of life, of tall stature, robust in figure, majestic in his bearing, with a noble brow, an open countenance, a pensive gaze, and mild and gracious lips. His hair, of a blond lightly tinted with brown in his early youth, was prematurely marked at the temples by those gray shadows which misfortune and mental labour hasten. His forehead was lofty ; his com plexion, originally ruddy, was paled by thought, and bronzed by the sun aud sea. The tones of his voice were manly, sonorous, and penetrating, like the accents of a man accustomed to give utterance to profound ideas. Nothing of levity or thought lessness was revealed by his gestures ; all was grave and har monious in his lightest movements ; he appeared to respect himself modestly, or to act only with the reserve of a devotee in a temple, as if he were in the presence of the god.

His features, more feminine, but already matured by the fatigues of his life, had so lively a resemblance to those of the first stranger, that it was impossible not to recognise in him either his son or brother. 7. \" These two strangers were Christopher Columbus and his son Diego. The monks, touched by the noble aspect of the father and the gracefulness of the child, which contrasted with the squalor of their attire, invited them to enter the interior of the monastery, and offered them the shelter, bread, and rest due to pilgrims. While Columbus and his child refreshed themselves with water, bread, and olives, at the table of their hosts, the monks informed their prior of the arrival of the two strangers, and the strange interest attaching to their distinguished appearance in opposition to their poverty. The prior de scended to converse with them."], [204, "176 POSTSCRIPT III. 8. \" This head of the convent of Rabida was Juan Perfes de Marchenra, the former confessor of Queen Isabella, who, con jointly with Ferdinand, then ruled over Spain. A man of sanctity, science, and erudition, he had preferred the shelter of his cloister to the honours and intrigues of the court ; but his very retreat had preserved for him a great reputation in the palace, and a powerful influence over the mind of the queen. Providence had no less directed the steps of Columbus than chance, if it had designed to open for him by a trustworthy hand the gates of the council, the ear and heart of the sove reigns. ' 1 9. \" The prior saluted the stranger, embraced the child, and gently made himself acquainted with the circumstances which had forced them to travel on foot the most unfrequented routes of Spain, and borrow the shelter of the humble roof of a poor and solitary monastery. Columbus told the story of his obscure life, and laid bare to the attentive monk his grand con ceptions \u2014 that obscure life, and those grand conceptions which were but an attempt and a presentiment.\" He related the parti culars of his birth and breeding ; his early passion for the sea ; the adventures of his youth ; his marriage, and the incident which awakened in his mind a belief in the existence of another continent ; the long, deliberate progress of his studies ; his ripening convictions ; and his vain endeavours, both at Lisbon and the court of Spain, to procure the royal patronage for the bold project he had meditated. The eloquent and impassioned recital greatly affected the Prior of Santa Maria de Rabida, who was more versed in geographical and nautical science than was usual with a man of his profession. The proximity of his monastery to the small but busy port of Palos had thrown him frequently into tbe society of its seamen and adventurers, while from an early period his studies had been directed towards the natural sciences and those problems which agitated the active intellects of the age. 10. Affected at first with compassion, he was soon after wards stirred into enthusiasm, and moved to put his faith in Columbus, as in a man who rose superior to fortune. \" He saw in him,\" says Lamartine, \" one of those messengers of God who are repulsed from the threshold of princes, whither they bear in the hands of want the invisible treasures of truth. Religion"], [205, "177 SIGNS OF LAND. comprehended genius, a revelation which like the other needs its believers. He felt himself constrained to become one of those faithful worshippers who share in these revelations of genius, not by discovery, but by faith. Providence almost always attaches one of these believers to great men, to prevent them from growing discouraged by the incredulity, the harsh ness, or persecutions of the vulgar.\" 11 Through the interposition of the prior, Columbus finally obtained the patronage of Isabella. His project received the royal authorisation, and the expedition of discovery set forth from Palos on Friday, the 3rd of August, 1492. Our next quotation from Lamartine describes the first glimpse of the New World. The great navigator has prevailed upon his impatient and dismayed crew to continue their adventurous course for three days longer : \u2014 \" At sunrise on the second day, some freshly broken twigs appeared near the vessels. A plank shaped with the hatchet, a plank artistically carved by means of an edged instrument, a branch of hawthorn in flower, a bird's-nest suspended to a bough torn from the tree by the wind, and filled with eggs which the mother still covered, undisturbed by the gentle undu lations of the waves, floated successively upon the waters. The seamen collected aboard these witnesses \u2014 written, speaking, or living \u2014 of a neighbouring land. They were the voices of the shore confirming that of Columbus. Before regarding the land with the eyes of the body, he had inferred its existence by these signs of life. The discontented now fell upon their knees before the admiral w7hom the day before they had insulted ; they implored his forgiveness of their disobedience, and raised the loud hymn of gratitude to the God who had made them partakers of his triumph. 12 \" Night descended upon these songs of the Church which saluted a new world. The admiral ordered his men to brail up the sails, to cast the lead frequently, to steer with caution, in fear of shallows and breakers, for he was convinced that the first rays of the morning would discover land beneath the bows of his vessels. During that last night no one slept. The rest lessness of the mind removed all need of slumber from the eyes ; the pilots and sailors, hanging on the masts, the yards, the shrouds, contended among themselves for the post whence they N"], [206, "178 POSTSCRIPT III. might cast the first glance upon the new hemisphere. A reward had been promised by the admiral to the mariner who should raise the first cry of Land ! if the land eventually verified his discovery. Providence reserved for himself this first glimpse which he had purchased at the price of twenty years of his life and so much constancy and danger. \"V\\ hile walking alone at midnight, upon the poop of his ship, and gazing steadily into the darkness, a glimmer of light passed, waned away, and repassed before his eyes on the level of the waters. Fearing to be deceived by the sparkle or phospho rence of the sea, he called in a low voice to a Spanish gentle man of the court of Isabella, named Guttierez, in whom he reposed more confidence than in his pilots. He indicated with his hand the quarter of the horizon where he had seen the fire, aud asked him if he could descry there any light. Guttierez replied that in truth he did perceive the glimmer of a wander ing ray in that direction. Columbus, still further to strengthen his conviction, summoned Rodrigo Sanchez, of Segovia, another of his confidants. Sanchez hesitated no more than Guttierez to assert that he saw a brightness on the horizon. Scarcely did the flame show itself but it disappeared, to reappear with another sinking of the ocean, as if it. was a hearth -fire upon a low shore, dis covered and concealed alternately by the undulating horizon of the lofty waves, or the floating lantern of some fisherman's canoe, now raised upon the crest, and now engulphed in the bosom of the waters. Thus the land and the life first appeared to Columbus and his two friends under the form of fire in the night of the ll-12th of October, 1492. Columbus, enjoining silence upon Rodrigo and Guttierez, kept to himself his vision, afraid to excite his crews with another false joy and bitter deception. He lost sight of the extinguished light, and watched until two in the morning, praying, hoping, and despairing in solitude upon the deck, between the triumph or the failure which the morrow would decide. 13. \" He was overwhelmed with that agony which precedes the birth of great truths \u2014 like the agony which attends the final liberation of the soul by death \u2014 when the report of a cannon, resounding upon the ocean some hundreds of fathoms before him. burst like the roar of a world upon his ears, and caused him, trembling, to fall upon his knees on the deck. It was the cry of"], [207, "THE SECOND CREATION. 179 Land ! shouted by the cannon, the signal agreed upon with the Pinta, which sailed in the van of the fleet, to track the route and sound a channel. At this sound a general shout of Land ! broke from all the yards and rigging of the vessels. The sails were furled, and the adventurers awaited the morning. The sweetest and most inconceivable odours were borne by gusts to the ships, together with the shadow of the shore, the clang of the billows on the reefs, and the land-breeze. The light per ceived by Columbus announced the presence of man and the first element of civilisation. Never had night appeared more reluctant to unveil the horizon- \u2014 that horizon which, for Columbus and his companions, was a second creation of God. 14. \" The gloaming, as it broke upon the air, revealed by slow degrees the outlines of an island in the bosom of the waves. Its two extremities were lost in the morning mist. Its low shore rose in an amphitheatre up to the peaks of the hills, whose sombre verdure contrasted with the lucid azure of the sky. At a few paces from the foam of the waves dying upon the yellow sand, forests of majestic and unknown trees ascended in terraces the successive gradations of the island. Some leafy avenues and luminous glades in their depths enabled the eye to partly pene trate the mysteries of their solitude. Houses might be seen scattered about the isle resembling bee-hives in their circular form, and their roofs of dried foliage : their smoke rose here and there above the summit of the woods. Groups of men, of women and children, more astonished than dismayed, showed themselves, half-naked, between the trunks of the trees nearest to the beach ; advanced timidly, and then retired, showing by their gestures and unstudied attitudes as much fear as curiosity and admiration at the appearance of the ships and the strangers whom the night had given to their shores. 15. \" Columbus, after contemplating in silence the first advanced margin or outpost of the land so often constructed in his calcula tions, and so superbly painted in his imagination, found it superior to what he had dreamed. He burned with impatience to print the first footstep of an European upon its sands, and to plant there, in the sign of the Cross, and in the colours of Spain, the standard of the conquest of God and the victory of sovereigns achieved by his genius. But he restrained in himself and his followers this eager haste to land, wishing to surround this N 2"], [208, "180 POSTSCRIPT III. taking possession of a new world with the solemnity of the greatest action, perhaps, ever accomplished by a navigator, and, in default of men, to call God and the angels, sea, earth, and heaven, to witness his triumph over the Unknown. 16. \" He arrayed himself with all the insignia of his dignities as Admiral of the Ocean and Viceroy of future kingdoms. He unrolled his purple mantle, and taking in his hand the banner broidered with a cross of gold, whereon the initials of Ferdinand and Isabella, interlinked like their realms, were surmounted by their crown, embarked in his shallop, and, followed by the boats of Alonzo and Yanes Pinzon, his lieutenants, moved towards the shore. On touching the land, he fell on his knees to consecrate, by an act of humility and adoration, the bounty and greatness of God in that new part of his works. He kissed the sand, and, his face buried among the herbage, wept. Tears, with a two fold meaning and a twofold augur}', which moistened for the first time the earth of the hemisphere discovered by the men of ancient Europe ! tears of joy for Columbus, who overflowed with the gratitude and devotion of a lofty heart ! tears of lamentation for that virgin land, which appeared to presage for it that cala mity and devastation, that fire and sword, that blood and death, which the strangers brought with their pride, knowledge, and power ! It was the man who shed these tears, but the New World which ought to have wept!\" 1 7. Passing from this hour of splendid fruition to the sorrowful and disastrous close of the hero's career, let us avail ourselves of yet another of Monsieur de Lamartine's glowing pictures. Columbus is lying on his deathbed \u2014 aged, in penury, and for gotten ; for the greatest services of the greatest men secure not the gratitude of kings or nations. Forgetfulness is so easy to the mind of the vulgar ! \" Columbus perceived that life, but not constancy, was about to fail him. His brother Barthelemy and his son Diego were absent, at his desire, on a mission of supplication to the Queen Juana, daughter of Isabella, who had returned from Flanders to Castile. Physical pain, moral anguish, a foreboding of the shortness of his days, which rendered vain the hope of obtaining justice before his end ; the triumph of his enemies at court, the derision of courtiers, the coldness of the sovereign, the isola tion to which the absence of his son aud brother condemned him"], [209, "CLOUDS AND SHADOWS. 181 in a city forgetful or ungrateful ; the memories of a life of which one-half had been passed in expecting the hour of a sublime fate, the other half in deploring the uselessness of genius ; with out doubt, too, a sentiment of pity for that innocent and happy race of Indians whom he had found free and child-like in their garden of delights, and whom he had left slaves, plundered and polluted, in the hands of their oppressors ; his brothers without support, his children without an inheritance; a fear as to the fate of his renown with posterity ; the agony of misunderstood genius \u2014 all these sorrows and sufferings in body and mind and soul, of the past, the present, and the future, weighed at once and together upon the old man, abandoned in his chamber at Segovia, during the absence of his kinsmen and children. He called to one of his servants, an aged, and the last, companion of his wanderings, of his glory and his misery, to bring to his bed side a little breviary, the gift of Pope Alexander VI. at a time when sovereigns treated him as a sovereign. He wrote with his enfeebled hand his will upon a page of this book, to which he attributed a virtue of divine consecration. 18. \" Strange spectacle for his poor servant ! This old man, forsaken by the world, and stretched upon a pauper's bed in a hired house of Segovia, gave away, in his will, seas, hemi spheres, islands, continents, nations, empires ! He named as his principal heir his legitimate son, Diego ; in case of the death of Diego without issue, he made over his rights to his natural son, Fernando ; and, finally, if Fernando died childless, the inheritance passed to the cherished brother of Columbus, Don Bartholomew, and his descendants. ' I pray my sovereigns and their successors,' said he, ' to observe for ever my wishes .in the distribution of my rights, my wealth, and my offices ; I who, born at Genoa, came to serve them in Castile, and who discovered in the West the mainland, the islands, and the Indies ! My son shall possess my dignity of Admiral of that part of the ocean which lies to the west of a line drawn from one pole to the other !' Passing from this point to the distribu tion of the revenues which had been secured him by his treaty with Isabella and Ferdinand, the old man divided, with liberality and wisdom, the millions which ought to return to his family among his sons and Bartholomew his brother. He assigned a fourth to this brother ; two millions yearly to Fernando, his"], [210, "182 POSTSCRIPT III. second son. He remembered Fernando's mother, Donna Bea trice Enriquez, whom he had never married, and for having abandoned whom his conscience had reproached him during his years of wanderings upon the ocean. He charged his heir to make a liberal settlement upon that companion of his obscure days, when he struggled at Toledo against the harshness of his early lot. He appeared even to accuse himself of some ingratitude or negligence of heart towards the object of this second love ; for, to the legacy he had given him, he adds these words, which hung heavily on his dying hand \u2014 ' And let this be fulfilled for the relief of my conscience, inasmuch as that name and that memory are a heavy weight upon my soul !' 19. \" Transporting himself after this to that first country which a second never effaces in the heart of man, he had a thought for that city of Genoa where time had garnered up his paternal house, but where still remained a far-off kinsman, like the roots which live in the earth after the tree has been felled. ' I command my son, Diego,' he wrote, ' to support for ever in the city of Genoa a member of our family, who shall reside there with his wife, and to assure him an honourable livelihood, as shall become a person who is allied to us. I wish this kinsman to preserve his footing and nationality in that city, in the quality of a citizen ; for it is there that I was born, and it is from thence that I have come ! ' \" ' Let my son,' he adds, with that chivalrous sentiment of vassalage and the enfeoffment of self to the sovereign which was the second religion of the time ; ' let my son serve, in memory of me, the King, the Queen, and their successors, even to the loss of property and life, since, next to God, it was they who supplied me with the means of making my discoveries. \" ' It is very true,' he continues, with an involuntary bitter ness, like a reproach which is but ill-smothered in his memory, ' that I came to them from afar to make my offerings, and that a long time passed before they would believe in the gift which I brought their majesties ; but that was natural, for it was a mystery to all, and could only excite incredulity ! Wherefore I ought to share the glory with those sovereigns who were the first to trust me.' 20. \" Columbus, this duty done, surrendered all his thoughts to that God whom he had always considered as a single and"], [211, "183 DEATH OF COLUMBUS. veritable Sovereign, as if he was lifted up directly by that Providence of which he felt himself to be the peculiar instru ment and minister. Resignation and enthusiasm, the two supports of his life, did not fail him in his death. He humbled himself under the hand of nature and rose again under that of God, which he had always beheld in his triumphs and reverses, and which he saw more closely at the moment of his departure from earth. He was wholly lost in penitence for his errors and hope of his two-fold immortality. A poet at heart, as we see him in his compositions, he yielded to the sacred poetry of the Psalms the last aspirations of his soul and the last faint utter ances of his lips. He pronounced in Latin his farewell of the world, and with a loud voice returned his soul into the hands of his Creator \u2014 a servant satisfied with his work, and released from the visible world, whose boundaries he had enlarged, to enter the world unseen, and conquer the immeasurable space of the boundless universe. 21. \" The envy and ingratitude of his age and his sovereign passed away with the last sigh of the great man of whom they had made a victim. One's contemporaries always seem eager to expiate towards the dead the persecutions which they have inflicted upon the living. To Columbus was decreed the honour of royal obsequies. His remains, and, at a later period, those of his son, after having tenanted several sepulchres in different Spanish cathedrals, were transported and interred, according to the desire of Columbus, at Hispaniola, like a con queror amidst the scenes of his triumph. They still repose at Cuba. But by a singular judgment of God, or by the ungrate ful forgetfulness of men, of all the countries of America which disputed among themselves the honour of guarding his dust, not one has preserved his name. 22. \" All the qualities of the truly great man were combined in Columbus : genius, work, patience ; obscurity of condition vanquished by strength of nature ; steadfastness, gentle but inflexible to the end ; resignation to the will of Heaven, wrestling with the world, long-brooding thought in solitude, heroic execution of thought in action, intrepidity and coolnsss against the elements in tempests and against death in rebellions, confi dence in the star \u2014 not of man, but of humanity ; life hazarded with temerity and without looking behind him, in casting him-"], [212, "184 POSTSCRIPT III. self into that unknown and phantom-crowded ocean, a Rubicon of fifteen hundred leagues, far more irrepassable than that of C\u00e6sar !

We know of no man more per fect. He contained in his sole self several men. He was worthy of personifying the ancient world before that unknown world which he was the first to enter, and to bear to the men of another race all the virtues of the old continent without any of its vices. No one by the grandeur of his influence has better deserved the name of the Civiliser. 24. \" His influence upon civilisation was without limit. He completed the universe, he perfected the physical oneness of the globe. It was his to advance, far beyond what had been done before him, the work of God \u2014 the moral unity of the human race.

The importance of the Diet op Worms, convoked by Charles V. in 1525, will only be rightly understood by him who agrees with Schlegel, that the Reformation was a mighty and momentous revolution, which has mainly directed the march of modern times, influenced the policy and legislation of the European states, and down to the present day has been the principal cause of all the great political changes, and all the novel and surprising events of our age. Everything has pro ceeded from it. Literature and Science have been animated by its spirit. Constitutional government without it would have been impossible ; for it is the principle of Protestantism to give power to the many, as it is the principle of Popery to confine it to the few. It threw open the New World to .the enterprise of Europe, when otherwise it might for centuries have remained the appanage of the Powers upon whom it was bestowed by the Roman pontiff. The free spirit it evoked did not restrict itself to theological speculations, but began to examine the"], [215, "INFLUENCE OF THE REFORMATION. 187 relations of classes, the laws of nations, the rights of kings and peoples \u2014 to burst asunder the trammels which fettered com merce ; to loosen the hold of ancient tradition upon the minds of men. As the child first freed from the thraldom of the nursery delights to exercise its limbs and indulge itself in the novelty of unconfined movement ; so Europe \u2014 which for several genera tions previous to the Great Event had exhibited a painful rest lessness, as if confident of its possession of faculties which it was forbidden to develop \u2014 as soon as it was partly released from the intolerable burthen of Papal infallibility, plunged into the boldest and most daring enterprise, and ran riot in the enjoyment of unaccustomed liberty. Hence, the bold adventures of our English seamen in the Spanish Main, the revolt of the Nether lands against its hereditary tyrants, and the commotions which shook France to its centre, and wakened there a love of freedom whose final consequence was the Revolution of 178S ; \u2014 hence the elevation of England to its foremost place among the nations, and the foundation of the great American common wealth, which without Protestantism could never have been accomplished; \u2014 hence that healthy and masculine literature which is our pride, and the best memorial of our liberties ; \u2014 hence those wonderful developments of science, which the Inquisition would have stifled at the outset but for the spirit of free inquiry which Protestantism called into being, and has carefully fostered. 2. The great epoch in the Lutheran Reformation was un doubtedly the Diet of Worms, which defined the position of the two great parties, and rendered reconciliation impossible. It bound down the Roman Church to a policy of repression and persecution ; it compelled the followers of Luther to assert their claims to civil and religious liberty, and to repudiate altogether and for ever the supreme authority of the Pope. The Decree of Proscription issued by that famous Diet necessitated the League of Smalcalde, the Thirty Years' War, and the Treaty of Westphalia. It was the first of a series of great changes \u2014 of important movements \u2014 whose influence has extended to the present, and shall radiate, in blessed and holy light, through all succeeding ages. 3. True policy would seem to have dictated to Charles V. at this juncture the patronage and encouragement, of Luther, who was struggling for those very privileges and immunities the"], [216, "188 THE DIET OF WORMS. empire had so long and so vainly endeavoured to wrest from the Holy See. But the rivalry which existed between the emperor and Francis I. of France, rendered him anxious to secure the favour and alliance of the Pope, and he considered this support could most easily be secured by his punishing the heretical attacks of Luther with unexampled severity. He was willing, therefore, to have acquiesced in the demands of the papal legates that the Diet should at once, and without hearing him, condemn the man whom the Pope had proscribed as an incor rigible heretic. But the intolerable injustice of such a pro cedure revolted the members of the Diet, and they insisted that he should be allowed to appear in person and defend himself against the charges of his accusers. For this purpose, early in the year 1525, he was summoned to appear before the Diet at Worms, and the emperor, and the princes through whose terri tories he would pass, granted him a safe-conduct, and under took to protect him from any injury or violence. The imperial mandate was thus worded : \u2014 \" Honourable, dear, and devoted Luther, \u2014 Ourself and the states of the Holy Roman Empire, assembled at Worms, having resolved to demand an explanation from you on the subject of your doctrines and your books, we forward you a safe-conduct to secure your personal immunity from danger. We would have you immediately set forth on your journey hither, so that within twenty days of the receipt of our mandate, you may appear before us and the states. You have neither force nor stratagem to fear. Relying upon our imperial word, we expect your submission to our earnest wishes.\" 4. In compliance with the Emperor's injunction Luther set out for Worms amidst the acclamations of the people. A jhariot, fashioned like a closed litter, was prepared for him, and he was attended by his friends and favourite councillors. He arrived at Leipzig on the 2nd of April, and partook, according to the custom of the city, of the Cup of Honour. On the 4th he arrived at Weimar, where a messenger from Duke lohn of Saxony presented him with money to defray the ex penses of his journey. On the fith he visited his old monastery at Erfurt, and the next day being Easter the little church was crowded long before the hour of morning service ; everybody being anxious to hear the Monk who for the last three years had so aroused the attention of the world, and from his humble"], [217, "LUTHER'S ELM. 189 cell had shaken empires. In the midst of Luther's discourse, a portion of the exterior wall gave way, and the terrified congre gation fled tumultuously from what they considered an imminent death. Luther remained in his pulpit, calm and unmoved. With a Bign he stopped the retreating throng, and exclaimed, \" My brethren, do ye not see that this is but the hand of the demon who seeks to impede you from hearing the word of God ? Rest where you are : Christ is with us and for us.\" And immediately the whole congregation turned back, and pressed nearer to the pulpit to catch the orator's inspired words. 5. Severe physical suffering compelled Luther to journey slowly. At Oppenheim he paused to snatch a brief repose. At Pfifflingheim, near Worms, observing a peasant planting elms hj the wayside, \" Give me one of them,\" he said, \" and I will place it in the earth. God grant that my doctrines may flourish as the branches of this elm will doubtless flourish ! \" The tree fulfilled his prophecy, and men rested themselves in the shadow of Luther's Elm until it was stricken by lightning in 1811. Many enthusiastic Lutherans, from time to time, had chosen to be in terred beneath the sweeping branches of the Reformer's tree. 6. On the 16th Luther came in sight of Worms, and behold ing its gray bell-towers, rose in his chariot and chanted aloud the noble psalm \u2014 the \" Marseillaise of the Reformation \" \u2014 Eiri feste Burg ist wiser Gott, * whose words and music he is said to have improvised at Oppenheim. Outside the gate of Worms waited Leffler, the Duke of Bavaria's jester, holding in one hand a cross, and in the other a lighted taper which he had borrowed from the altar of a neighbouring church. On Luther's approach, the jester gravely preceded him into the choir, walking backwards, and loudly exclaiming, Ecce advenit, quern expectamus in lenebris. Luther's adherents smiled at this silly exhibition of priestly rage, and said to one another, \" Chil- * We append the original German, and a faithful rendering in English \" Mit unser Macht ist nichts gethan, Wir sind gar bald velohren : Es streit fur uns der rechte Mann, Den Gott selbst hat erkoren. \" Ein' feste Burg ist unser Gott, Ein' gute Wehr und Waffen.

He might well look forward to the morrow with devout gravity, though even his sagacious intellect could hardly have foreseen that it was an epoch in the history of the human race, from which the ages yet unborn should date the growth of civil and religious freedom. But nevertheless he knew that the sunrise, slowly breaking over the eastern hills, heralded the dawn of an eventful day, which men and angels might have cause to look back upon with fear and trembling, should not the Truth prevail. 7. The Council of the Imperial Diet assembled in the town hall. The emperor, Charles V., as yet in his young and pros perous manhood, presided, and around him gathered electors and princes, dukes, bishops, counts, and barons, in all two hun dred and six persons, distinguished for their rank, influence, wealth, or genius \u2014 the flower and glory of the great German Empire. It was a memorable scene, that Diet at Worms, held \" Und wenn die Welt voll Teufel war, Und wollt uns gar verschlingen, So fiirchten wir uns nicht so sehr, Es soil uns doch gelingen ; Der Fiirst dieser welt, Wie sau'r er sich stellt, Thut er uns doch nichts ; Das Macht, er ist gericht 't.

The proceedings of this important Diet, and the share which Luther took in them, are best detailed in his own eloquent and spirited narrative. He underwent the trying ordeal with equal prudence and courage. But he declined to retract the opinions he had advanced, or the propositions he had enunciated, in obedience to that authority of popes and councils whose fallibility had so often been demonstrated by experience. Only arguments from reason and Scripture could shake his conclusions. \" Here I stand,\" exclaimed Luther ; \" I can do no more. God be my help. Amen.\" The papal legate, and some of the more violent members of the Diet, solicited the emperor to withdraw his pro tection from so violent a heretic ; but Charles had too much nobility of character to sully his fame with such an indelible disgrace. He was, however, very wroth at Luther's persistency, and, on the evening of the second examination, retired to his cabinet, and drew up with his own hand a singular declaration of his attachment to the Roman Church. \" Descended as I am,\" he wrote, \" from the Christian Emperors of Germany, the Catholic Kings of Spain, and from the Archdukes of Austria and the Dukes of Burgundy, all of whom have preserved, to the last moment of their lives, their fidelity to the Church, and have always been the defenders and protectors of the Catholic faith, its decrees, ceremonies, and usages ; I have been, am still, and will ever be devoted to those Christian doctrines and the consti tution of the Church, which they have left to me as a sacred inheritance. And as it is evident that a single monk has advanced opinions contrary to the sentiments of all Christians, past and present, I am firmly determined to wipe away the reproach which a toleration of such errors would cast on Ger many, and to employ all my power and resources, my body, my blood, my life, and even my soul, in checking the progress of this sacrilegious doctrine. I will not, therefore, permit Luther to enter into any further explanation, and will instantly dismiss, and afterwards treat him as a heretic ; but I will not violate my safe-conduct, and will cause him to be reconducted to Wit temberg in safety.\" 9. A private attempt was made by the emperor to obtain Luther's recantation ; and though it proved unsuccessful, he was compelled to wait till the electors of Saxony and the Palatine had quitted the Diet before he could venture to propose a decree"], [221, "luther's narrative. 193 of proscription. This famous decree, commonly known as the Edict of Worms, which in effect proclaimed an intolerant crusade against Protestantism, was passed on the 28th of May; but, to give it the appearance of unanimity, was fraudulently dated the Sth. It declared Luther a heretic and schismatic, confirmed the sentence of the Pope, and denounced the ban of the empire against all who should defend, maintain, and protect him. But while the emperor and the princes of the empire were affixing their signatures to its truculent provisions, the hawkers in the streets of Worms were selling copies of the Reformer's works as fast as the printers, his noble and faithful allies, could issue them. And it is some consola tion to those who are inclined to grieve at the temporary success of Wrong and the apparent downfall of Right, to remember that now, when a Protestant nation is the first in Europe, when Rome is shattered to its very foundation, and the doctrines taught by Luther are spreading in light and glory over Asia, America, and Africa, the Edict of Worms rots among those musty parchments of antiquity which the student sometimes regards with curiosity, as the geologist examines the fossil relics of an antediluvian world. LUTHER'S NARRATIVE OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE DIET OF WORMS, A.D. 1521. The Diet opened on the Gth of January ; the Edict was passed on the 28th of May.] \" The herald summoned me on the Tuesday in Holy Week, and brought me safe-conducts from the emperor, and from several princes. On the very next day, Wednesday, these safe conducts were, in effect, violated at Worms, where they con demned and burned my writings. Intelligence of this reached me when I was at Worms. The condemnation, in fact, was already published in every town, so that the herald himself asked me whether I still intended to repair to Worms. \" Though, in truth, I was physically fearful and trembling, I replied to him, ' I will repair thither, though I should find there as many devils as there are tiles on the house-tops.' \" When I arrived at Oppenheim, near Worms, Master Bucer came to see me, and tried to dissuade me from entering the city. He told me that Glapion, the emperor's confessor, had been to o"], [222, "194 THE DIET OF WORMS. him, and had entreated him to warn me not to go to Worms ; for if I did, I should be burned. I should do well, he added, to stop in the neighbourhood, at Franz Von Sickengen's, who would be very glad to entertain me. \" The wretches did this for the purpose of preventing me from making my appearance within the time prescribed. They knew that if I delayed only three days more, my safe-conduct would have been no longer available, and then they would have shut the gates in my face, and, without hearing what I had to say, have arbitrarily condemned me. I went on, then, in the purity of my heart ; and on coming within sight of the city, at once sent forward word to Spalatin that I had arrived, and desired to know where I was to lodge. All were astonished at hearing of my near approach ; for it had been generally imagined that, a victim to the trick sought to be practised on me, my terrors would have kept me away. \" Two nobles, the Seigneur Von Hirschfeldt and John Schott, came, to me, by order of the elector, and took me to the house in which they were staying. \" No prince came at the time to see me, but several counts and other nobles did, who gazed at me fixedly. These were they who had presented to his majesty the four hundred articles against ecclesiastical abuses, praying that they might be re formed, and intimating that they would take the remedy into their own hands, if need were. They had all been freed by my gospel ! \" The Pope had written to the emperor desiring him not to observe the safe-conduct. The bishops urged his Majesty to comply with the Pope's request, but the prince and the states would not listen to it ; for such conduct would have excited a great disturbance. All this brought me still more prominently into general notice, and my enemies might well have been more afraid of me than I was of them. The Landgrave of Hesse, still a young man at the time, desired to have a conference with me, came to my lodgings, and, after a long interview, said, on going away, ' Dear doctor, if you be in the right, as I think you are, God will aid you.' \"On my arrival, I had written to Glapion, the emperor's con fessor, entreating him to come and see me at his first leisure, but he refused, saying it would be useless to do so."], [223, "luther's narrative. 195 \" I was then cited, and appeared before the whole council of the imperial diet, in the town-hall, where the emperor, the elector, and the princes were assembled. Dr. Eck, official of the Archbishop of Treves, opened the business by saying to me, first in Latin, and then in German \u2014 ' Martin Luther, his sacred and invincible majesty, with the advice of the states of the empire, has summoned you hither, that you may reply to the two questions I am now about to put to you. Do you acknow ledge yourself the author of the writings published in your name, and which are here before me ; and will you consent to retract certain of the doctrines which are therein inculcated?' I think the books are mine,' replied I. But immediately Dr. Jerome Schurff added \u2014 ' Let the titles of the works be read.' When they had read the titles, I said, \"Yes, the books are mine.' \" Then he asked me, ' Will you retract the doctrines therein ? ' I replied \u2014 \" ' Gracious Emperor, as to the question whether I will retract the opinions I have given forth, a question of faith in which are directly interested my own eternal salvation, and the free enunciation of the Divine Word \u2014 that Word which knows no master on earth, or in heaven, and which we are all bound to adore, be we as great as we may \u2014 it would be rash and dangerous for me to reply to such a question, until I had meditated thereupon in silence and retreat, lest I incur the anger of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, who has said, \" He who shall deny me before men, I will deny him before my Father which is in heaven.\" I therefore entreat your sacred majesty to grant me the time necessary to enable me to reply with full knowledge of the point at issue, and without fear of blaspheming the Word of God, or endangering the salvation of my own soul.' \" They gave me till the next day at the same hour. The following morning I was sent for by the bishops and others who were directed to confer with me, and endeavour to induce me to retract. I said to them, ' The Word of God is not my word : I therefore cannot abandon it. But in all things short of that, I am ready to be docile and obedient.' The Margrave Joachim then interposed, and said, ' Sir doctor, as I under stand it, your desire is to listen to counsel and to instruction on all points that do not trench upon the Word ?' ' Yes,' I 0 2"], [224, "196 the diet of worms. replied, ' that is my desire.' Then they told me that I ought to place myself entirely in the hands of his Majesty ; but I said I could not consent to this. They asked me whether they were not themselves Christians, and entitled to have a voice in deciding the questions between us, as well as I. Whereunto I answered, that I was ready to accept their opinions in all points which did not offend against the Word, but that from the Word I could not depart, repeating, that as it was not my own, I could not abandon it. They insisted that I ought to rely upon them, and have full confidence that they would decide rightly. ' I am not,' rejoined I, ' by any means disposed to place my trust in men who have already condemned me without a hearing. although under safe conduct. But to show you my zeal and sincerity, I tell you what I will do ; act with me as you please. I consent to renounce my safe-conduct, and to place it unre servedly in your hands I ' At this my lord Frederick de Feilitsch observed, ' Truly this is saying quite enough, or, indeed, too much.' \" By-and-by they said, ' Will you, at all events, abandon some of the articles ? ' \" I replied, ' In the name of God, I will not defend for a moment any articles that are opposed to the Scriptures.' Here upon two bishops slipped out, and went and told the emperor I was retracting. At this a message came to me, asking whether I really consented to place myself in the hands of the emperor and of the diet ? I answered that I had consented to nothing of the sort, and should never consent to it. So I went on resisting alone the attempts of them all, for Dr. Schurff, and my other friends had become angry with me for my obstinacy, as they called it. Some of my disputants said to me, that if I would come over to them, they would in return give up to me and abandon the articles which had been condemned at the Council of Constance. To all of which I simply replied, ' Here is my body, here my life ; do with them as you will.' \" Then Cochl\u0153us came up to me, and said, ' Martin, if thou wilt renounce the safe-conduct, I will dispute with thee.' \" I in my simplicity and good faith would have consented to this, but Dr. Jerome Schurff replied, with an ironical laugh, ' Ay> truly, that were a good idea \u2014 that were a fair bargain i'faith ; you must needs think the doctor a fool.' So I refused"], [225, "LUTHER'S NARRATIVE. 197 to give up the safe-conduct. Several worthy friends of mine who were present had already, at the bare mention of the pro position, advanced toward me as if to protect me, exclaiming to Cochl\u00e6us, 'What, you would carry him off a prisoner, then ! That shall not be.' \" Meantime, there came a doctor of the retinue of the Mar grave of Baden, who essayed to move me by fine flourishes. I ought, he said, to do a very great deal, to grant a very great deal, for the love of charity, that peace and union might con tinue, and no tumult arise. All, he urged, were called upon to obey his imperial Majesty, as being the supreme authority ; we ought all to avoid creating unseemly disturbance ; and, therefore, he concluded, I ought to retract. ' I will,' replied I, ' with all my heart, in the name of charity, do all things, and obey in all things, which are not opposed to the faith and honour of Christ.' \" Then the Chancellor of Treves said to me, ' Martin, thou art disobedient to bis imperial Majesty ; wherefore depart hence, under the safe-conduct which has been given thee.' I answered, ' It has been as it pleased the Lord it should be. And you,' I added, ' do all of you on your part consider well the position in which you are.' And so I departed, in single ness of heart, without remarking or comprehending their machinations. \" Soon afterwards they put in force their cruel edict \u2014 that ban which gave all ill men an opportunity of taking vengeance with impunity on their personal enemies, under the pretext of their being Lutheran heretics ; and yet, in the end, the tyrants found themselves under the necessity of recalling what they had done. \" And this is what happened to me at Worms, where I had no other aid than the Holy Spirit.''"], [226, "POSTSCRIPT IV. THE THREE REFORMERS\u2014 WICKLIFFE, HUSS, AND LUTHER. I. WICKLIFFE. [Authorities. \u2014 Wre have already given a list of authors upon the general subject of the Reformation of the Church in Europe. For particular details in reference to Wickliffe, the English Reformer, consult the comprehensive Lives of Wickliffe, by Lebas and Vaughan ; Henry's History of England ; Milner's Church History; Wickliffe's Works, &c. See also Wralsingham (Historia Brevis, a.d. 1273-1422\") ; Sharon Turner's History of England ; Hallam's Europe in the Middle Ages, &c] \" When I recall to mind, at last, after so many dark ages, wherein the huge overshadowing train of error had almost swept all the stars out of the firmament of the church ; how the bright and blissful Reformation, by Divine power, strook through the black and settled night of ignorance and Anti-Christian tyranny, methinks a sovereign and reviving joy must needs rush into the bosom of him that reads or hears, and the sweet odour of the returning Gospel imbathe his soul with the fragrancy of heaven.\" \u2014 Milton. 1. The \" Morning Star of the Reformation\" rose upon happy England in the year of our Lord 1234, when the village of Wiclift, distant about six miles from the Yorkshire Richmond, became renowned for all time as the birthplace of John Wiclif, Wickliffe, or de Wycliffe, for in so many ways is the name of the great Reformer spelt. He was sprung, it is said, of the old family \u2014 Saxon assuredly in its origin \u2014 -who from the era of the Conquest had been lords of the manor, and patrons of the rec tory. Of his childhood, of the influences which affected his youthful mind, and the circumstances which gave a bias to his thoughts, we unhappily know nothing; or pleasant would it have been to trace the growth of so comprehensive an intellect, to mark how it struggled onward to the light through the deep, dark clouds of error and delusion, to see the plant bloom with increasing vigour until it developed into a noble tree, beneatli whose far-spreading foliage the whole land rejoiced. But ho must have enjoyed an education of considerable compass to fit"], [227, "199 THE VAUD0IS AND THE LOLLARDS. him for the university course upon which he entered in his seven teenth year, as a student of Queen's College, Oxford. From thence, after a very short probation, he removed to Merton College, where the means and sources of knowledge were more abundant. 2. At what time Wickliffe first became \"a Lollard,\" or whence he derived the spark of fire which in his ardent soul broke into so vigorous a flame, is at the best uncertain. But there seems a probability that he had obtained some knowledge of the doc trines professed by the Vaudois. These were a primitive people dwelling in the valleys of the Cottian Alps, who held the faith taught by the early Christian Church, in spite of the tyranny of the priests of Rome ; and thus, in the high places \u2014 the fast nesses of the mountains \u2014 God spake as he did of old, when the prophets revealed His will to listening man. From these Alpine heights went forth many streams of living water. The Vaudois established a colony in Calabria, which was put to the sword by order of the Pope, and another in Bohemia, which flourished into a noble Christian state. From Bohemia came many youth to study at Oxford, and thus, perhaps, the truths professed by the Vaudois reached the heart and brain of Wickliffe : for in this manner passes from hand to hand the burning torch, that the world may never lack the means and source of light. The sunshine spreads from mountain peak to peak, gilding each lofty spire with glory, which thence rolls downward into the glens below. To the relationship which appears to have existed between the Vaudois and our English Wickliffe, Wordsworth has finely alluded in one of the most beautiful of his sonnets : \u2014 \" These who gave earliest notice, as the lark Springs from the ground the morn to gratulate : Who rather rose the day to antedate, By striking out a solitary spark, When all the world with midnight gloom was dark, \u2014 These harbingers of good, whom bitter hate In vain endeavoured to exterminate, Fell obloquy pursues with hideous bark ; ' But they desist not : and the sacred fire, Rekindled thus, from dens and savage woods Moves, handed on with never-ceasing care, Through courts, through camps, o'er limitary floods; Nor lacks this sea-girt isle a timely share Of the new flame, not suffered to expire.\" 3. Wickliffe's eager and combative mind seized greedily upon"], [228, "200 POSTSCRIPT IV. the new lights presented to his notice by the Bohemian students ; and they excited him to pursue his researches into every branch of knowledge with the greater eagerness. He traversed the wide fields of philosophy and natural science ; he penetrated the abstrusest mysteries of scholastic research. The civil and the canon law, the laws and customs of England, engaged his sedu lous investigation, though in Wickliffe's day the study of the latter was not considered worthy of the attention of the scholar. \" The canons of the Church were collected principally from the decrees of the councils and of pontiffs, and formed an authority, not purely ecclesiastical, but one by which a multitude of causes, once pertaining solely to the magistrate, were at length attached to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Christian pastor. Hence a spirit of rivalry arose between the courts of princes and those of the bishops, such as in time rendered it a proverb, that to excel as a canonist required the learning of a civilian, the latter word being understood to denote the secular law as distinguished from the ecclesiastical. There were numerous provincial and national customs opposed to that imperial system of legislation which had disappeared with the fall of the empire, and to that dominion of canonical law which ecclesiastics had reared upon its ruins. This was considerably the case in England, and it ought not perhaps to excite surprise that the ambition, aided by the pedantry of the times, should be found struggling to exclude the native jurisprudence from the class of liberal studies. But it appears that Wycliffe was not to be thus deterred from ascer taining the merit of customs which had descended with the generations of his fatherland, nor at length from preferring them openly to the collections of Gratian, or the laws of the empire.\" 4. But while devoting himself to these manly and wholesome studies, he did not neglect the subtle dialectics of Aristotle, much of whose abstrusest writings he committed to memory. He made himself familiar with the works of the Primitive Fathers \u2014 with those of the theologians of his own generation. This knowledge was with Wickliffe subservient to a higher and holier knowledge, and furnished him with the weapons which would stand him in good stead in his contest with the enemies of Truth. The Bible was the object of his constant research, though from its examination the policy of the Romish Church discouraged its members. For the follies of the scholastic philosophy"], [229, "SCHOLASTIC ABSURDITIES. 201 were held m higher repute than the epistles of St. Paul. Melancthon, two centuries later, complained that in sacred assemblies the ethics of Aristotle were expounded to the people instead of the Gospel. Peter Lombard's four books of \" Sen tences\" were more highly esteemed than the parables of Jesus. The student who read or followed the text of Holy Writ \u2014 so Roger Bacon tells us \u2014 was compelled to give way to the reader of the \" Sentences,\" who everywhere enjoyed honour and precedence. He who read the \"Sentences\" had the choice of his hour, and ample entertainment among the religious orders. He who read the Bible was deprived of these advantages, and sued, like a mendicant, to the reader of the \" Sentences,\" for the use of such hours as it might please him to grant. He who read the \" Summaries of Divinity\" was everywhere permitted to hold disputations, and venerated as master ; he who only read the text was not allowed to dispute at all. It was in this state of public opinion that Wickliffe ventured to combine the study of the Scriptures with the closest research into the scholastic meta physics, and, while examining the logic of Aristotle with the minutest attention, to recognise the supreme inspiration of the Bible, and make it the law of his life and the method of his thought. In his lectures he deviated from the usual mode of selecting the thesis from the writings of the theologians, and took his text from the Scriptures themselves, so that while one of his fellows was distinguished for his profundity, and another for his brilliancy, Wickcliffe came to be renowned as the Gospel Doctor. 5. He first appeared before the reading world of his age as an author, in 1356, when he bad attained his thirty-second year. His tractate was entitled the \" Last Age of the Church,\" and its object was to arouse mankind from their excesses and profanities by announcing the approaching end of the world, which he placed at the close of the fourteenth century. To this conclusion he was induced by the prophecies of Joachim, an Italian ecclesiastic, who, upon certain cabala founded on the letters of the Latin and Hebrew alphabets, and upon the dogma that between the First and Second Coming of the Saviour would elapse four periods of great tribulation \u2014 the persecutions of the heathen, the growth of declared heresies, the prevalence of simony, and the triumph of Antichrist \u2014 had formed the opinion"], [230, "202 POSTSCRIPT IV. that the fourteenth century would witness the destruction of the earth. Wickliffe's tract was a \"vigorous exposure of the evils of the time. But it does not seem to have aroused the attention of his contemporaries, and after its publication he again withdrew into the privacy of his enthusiastic studies. 6. The luxurious lives of the earlier monastic orders having exited a general scandal, there took place a reaction, about the beginning of the thirteenth century, and a race of monks arose who challenged the popular admiration and confidence by their rigid asceticism, self-denial, and morality. The papacy was at this epoch exposed to the attack of a numerous body of adversaries, and eagerly accepted the services of an order which promised to exalt the character of the Church by exhibiting an admirable example of simplicity and self-denial. \" In them,\" says one of the biographers of Wickliffe, \" the pontificate would be provided with a hardy and devoted militia, thoroughly pre pared for all the various exigencies of her warfare. On the one hand she would be effectually guarded against the hostility of princes, and on the other against the encroachments of heresy. The most ample and honourable privileges were, accordingly, lavished on those fraternities which made a voluntary abjuration of property, and whose members were ready to disperse them selves throughout Christendom, relying for their support on the alms of the faithful, and for their influence on the example of an austere, laborious, and ascetic life. For a considerable time the new institution did its office to admiration. The effect was like the transfusion of fresh life-blood into a decaying system. The genius of the institution penetrated quickly into every depart ment of ecclesiastical agency, whether high or low, whether obscure or eminent. It intruded itself into the region of parochial duty ; it seated itself in the confessional ; it seized on the chair of the university; it grasped the crozier of episcopacy ; it held the seals of civil office, and the portfolio of diplomatic intrigue ; till, at last, it appeared probable that the confidence and venera tion of nearly the whole Catholic world would be transferred from their established guides to these professors of primitive sanctity and perfection.\" 7. It is the tendency of the best human institutions to de generate as they grow prosperous; and the Mendicant friars as they increased in numbers and influence also increased in pride"], [231, "MONKS AND THEIR MORALS. 203 and arrogance, until they became the terror of the people to whom they were to have been an example. At the Council of Lyons, in 1272, Gregory X. \u2014 to remove the causes of the sore complaints which reached him from every quarter \u2014 reduced these mendicants into four distinct orders : \u2014 two of considerable power, the Dominicans and Franciscans, and two of an inferior rank, the Carmelites and Hermits of St. Augustine. This change wrought no permanent reformation in the morals and conduct of the monks. \" Within four and twenty years of their establishment in England,\" says Matthew Paris, \"they have raised their mansions to a kingly height. Insolently transgressing the limits of poverty \u2014 the very foundation of their profession \u2014 they fulfil to the letter the ancient prophecies of Hildegara, and display the costliest treasures within their sumptuous edifices and stately walls. They haunt the death-bed of the noble and wealthy, that they may extort secret legacies from the fears of guilt or superstition. No one now dares hope for salvation except through the ministry of the Preachers or Minorites. At court they gather, in the character of councillors and chamberlains, treasurers and negotiators of marriage. As the agents of papal extortion they are incessantly practising the arts of flattery, the stings of reproach, or the terrors of confession. They lavish their scorn on the purer orders of St. Benedict and St. Augus tine ; and, if their opinion is to be credited, these brethren of the black cowl are as vastly superior to the monks as the dis ciples of Epicurus would be to so many simple boors.\" 8. These intolerable oppressors could not but arouse an active opposition in every devout and honourable mind, and that oppo sition at length found a vigorous expression in Fitzralph, Chan cellor of the University of Oxford, who attacked them with unsparing eloquence, and even denounced them before the Pope at Avignon (a.d. 1357). Three years later he died, but his mantle devolved upon the worthy shoulders of John Wickliffe, whose noble sympathies and earnest heart had long been stirred against the excesses and vices of these cowled tyrants. He sprang at once into the vantage ground, and heroically made a stand against \" the powers of darkness.\" Beginning the battle in 1360, he continued it for many years with a wonderful boldness and incredible euthusiasm. These friars had beguiled many of the younger students of Oxford, and the University,"], [232, "204 POSTSCRIPT IV. therefore, in its own defence, had enacted that no one should be suffered to enter the fraternity of the Mendicants until he had reached the age of eighteen. Thus, a similar cause awoke the energies of both Wickliffe and Luther. Tetzel's traffic in \" in dulgences \" which excited the abhorrence of Luther, was but an imitation of the sale of spiritual privileges which, under the name of \" letters of fraternity,\" enriched the Mendicant friars. The court of Rome, in the contest provoked by the University, seconded its useful agents, the Mendicants, and granted so many dispensations that the Oxford statute became an empty form. In the struggle which ensued the services rendered by Wickliffe were so important, that the University could not but acknowledge them in a signal manner, and in 1361 he was presented by Baliol College with the living of Fellingham, in the diocese of Lincoln, and appointed to the post of Warden. The living he exchanged in 1368 for that of Ludgershall, which was nearer to Oxford, and the wardenship he resigned in 1365, when nominated by Archbishop Islip to the wardenship of Canterbury Hall. But the latter office he enjoyed but a few months. On the death of Islip, Peter Langham, Bishop of Ely, was promoted to the primacy, and the influence of the monks procured from the new archbishop, Wickliffe's summary dismissal. Wickliffe appealed to Rome, and Rome transferred the dispute to one of its cardinals. The appellant could not but have been aware that the slightest indication of hostility to the Romish prelates would be made use of by his enemies to influence the judgment of the cardinal-arbitrator ; but, unaffected by sordid considerations, he renewed his attacks upon monastic corruption, and unsparingly exposed the vices of the very men who were the most active agents of the papal power. Provi dence fits the man to tbe work, and the work which Wickliffe had to do could only be done by a man of great courage, im petuous disposition, and uncompromising energy. A strong arm must cleave the path through the wilderness, which workers of less stalwart frame will afterwards smoothen and enlarge. A Wickliffe must precede a Cranmer, and a Luther's mission can not be fulfilled by a Melancthon. So the gallant spirit of the embryo Reformer always rushed joyously into the thick of the battle, and was never so happy as when the din of swords rattled upon his unshaken shield. Like the war-horse he re-"], [233, "205 POPE AND PEOPLE. joiced in his strength \u2014 he smelt the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting. 9. The reader needs not to be reminded of the circumstances under which the infamous and shameless John surrendered the crown of England to the Pope of Rome, and accepted his king dom from the pontiff as a vassal receives a fief from his lord. England, however, had never acquiesced in the bondage; the act of homage had been evaded by its sovereign ; and the pay ment of the yearly tribute which marked its thraldom had not been paid for more than thirty years. But the Pope had never permitted his supremacy to lapse, and in 1365, Urban V. demanded payment of the year's contribution of one thousand marks, and the arrears for the thirty and three preceding years. But in Edward III. he had to deal with a king jealous of his country's honours and his royal rights, and he not only refused to pay the tribute, but summoned his parliament to discuss the legality of John's renunciation of the independence of his crown. The peers and commons of England indignantly repudiated the idea that every monarch could dispose of his sovereignty with out the consent of parliament, and unanimously declared that John had openly violated the solemn oath he had sworn at his coronation. \" Forasmuch,\" they said, \" as neither King John, nor any other king, could bring this realm and kingdom in such thraldom and subjection, but by common consent of par liament, the which was not done ; therefore, that which he did was against his oath at coronation. If, therefore, the Pope should attempt anything against the king by process, or other matters in deed, the king, with all his subjects, should, with all their force and power, resist the same.\" 10. The monks ranged always on the papal side in every struggle between the Church and the Crown ; their power and privileges depended on the absolute authority of the former, and naturally they stood on all occasions foremost in the defence of every ecclesiastical aggression. The narrow limits of a monastic community are unfavourable to the growth of liberal principles or patriotic sympathies. The mind becomes dwarfed to the standard of thought favoured by the few, and centres all good in the maintenance of the power to which it is the most closely assimilated. No greater advocates of absolutism can be found than the slaves of the cowl and the rosary ! Thus, not-"], [234, "206 POSTSCRIPT IV. withstanding the forcible expression of opinion which vindicate the patriotism of the English parliament, and found a vigorous response in the hearts of all true Englishmen, a monk was ready to cast himself in the breach, and assert the validity of the papal claim. And it is a sign of the eminence which Wickliffe had already obtained, and the known boldness and freedom of his opinions, that this monastic logician especially challenged the Reformer to defend, if he could, the king's recusancy and the parliament's sacrilegious disobedience. With heart elate, and intellect on fire, Wickliffe responded to the summons, \u2014 for there was much of the combative in his ardent nature, \u2014 and plainly asserted that the sovereignty of England had never been forfeited to the Pope ; that the clergy were in no wise exempt from the jurisdiction of the civil power. He drew a broad distinction between the temporal and spiritual authority of the Pope. The sovereign was, he said, the supreme head of the state in civil and ecclesiastical things, and, in ac cordance with his parliament, could not only refuse to pay the tribute claimed, but even alienate the property of the Church. This doctrine might not agree with some of the ecclesiastical canons, but harmonised with the maxims of civil law and the doctrines of Holy Writ. The Pope was the first and chief in the following of Christ, and in accordance with the example of Him who had not where to lay His head, should abandon all pretensions to other than spiritual influence. His interference in civil affairs had always operated to the national injury. Wickliffe continued \u2014 that the people had never ratified the conditions on which King John had agreed to pay tribute ; that if it was granted in consideration of his personal abso lution, both the Pope and the king had clearly been guilty of simony in bartering spiritual blessings for temporal advantages ; that if it were otherwise, a precedent had been established which might be used by the Romish Church to establish a claim to the disposal of the crown itself; that above the monarch there could be no superior authority than the Lord Christ ; and that for these and other reasons, the contract effected by the late king was not binding upon his successors or his people. 11. Wickliffe's bold and eloquent assertion of the rights of the crown and the liberties of the nation led to his appointment as the king's private chaplain \u2014 peculiaris regis clericus The in-"], [235, "WICKLIFFE BEFORE HIS AGE. 207 flnence of the court, however, failed to diminish the fervour of his attachment to holy things and liberal views ; and he found a powerful and enlightened supporter in John of Gaunt, \" time honour'd Lancaster\" \u2014 a prince whose genius and patriotism have hardly received due acknowledgment at the hands of our historians. When in 1371 the parliament, at the secret im pulse of the great Duke, demanded the exclusion of all persons in clerical orders from offices of state, Wickliffe again stepped forward as the courageous and eloquent advocate of a measure which was dictated by an equal reverence for the duties of a sacred calling and the just liberties of the people. Earnest was his complaint that prelates and \" great religious possessioners \" so busied themselves, heart and soul, in the discharge of official obligations and in the pressure of worldly affairs, that no habit of devotion, of praying, of thoughtfulness on heavenly things, on the sins of their own hearts or those of other men, was culti vated among them, nor were they ever seen studying or preach ing the Gospel, or visiting and comforting the poor. So can did a remonstrance did not fail to bring down on the Reformer's head the wrath of all who were affected by it, but the people of England were fully alive to its truth and justice, and the principle gradually became recognised in theory and practice that the affairs of the commonwealth ought only to be adminis tered by the laity. 12. Under the circumstances it is no marvel that the Pope decided against him in the matter of the wardenship of the Canterbury scholars ; though it may be wondered at that the king should have assented to the papal edict. He was thus compelled to retire to his living of Ludgershall, but in 1373 he took his degree as Doctor of Divinity, and soon afterwards was appointed Professor of Theology at Oxford. His lectures in the latter capacity attracted large and enthusiastic audiences, and he obtained such an authority in the schools that whatever he said was received as an oracle. His teaching was of the boldest character, and in many respects was more advanced than that of Luther and bis coadjutors. In his exposition of the Decalogue, he enunciated doctrines which are even now accepted only by the liberal party of the English Church, while he inveighed against the vices of the papacy with a courage and candour that marked him as indisputably in advance of his age."], [236, "208 POSTSCRIPT IV. He condemned in the severest language the practice then pre valent of profuse swearing and lavish oath taking. He advocated a devout observance of the Sabbath by works of charity, public worship, and private meditation. He expounded the principles on which honour is due to those in authority above us. The com mandment,\" Thou shalt not kill,\" applied, he declared, not merely to the crime of murder, but to the sin of injuring the character and sullying the reputation of our neighbours. He censured, in glowing words, the lusts of the flesh ; and finally he pointed out with remarkable clearness the inefficacy of a vicarious faith. \" Many think,\" he exclaimed, \" if they give a penny to a pardoner, they shall be forgiven the breaking of all the com mandments of God, and, therefore, they take no heed how they keep them. But I say to thee, for certain, though thou have priests and friars to sing for thee, and though thou each day hear many masses, and found charities and colleges, and go on pilgrimages all thy life, and give all thy goods to pardoners, all this shall not bring thy soul to heaven. While, if the com mandments of God are revered to the end, though neither penny nor halfpenny be possessed, there shall be everlasting pardon and the bliss of heaven.\" This is the language of a true and pure religion, which distinguishes between the cere monial and the actual, between the form and the spirit\u2014 which teaches the soul to look from the priest and the altar to Christ and his Cross ; which places the sacrament in its rightful position of inferiority to the Atonement. \" Bethink thee heartily,\" he wrote, \" of the wonderful kindness of God, who was so high and so worshipful in heaven, that He should come down so low, and be born of a maiden, and become our brother, to buy us again, by His hard passion, from our thraldom to Satan. He was beaten, and buffeted, and scourged, so that there was not left a whole part of His skin, but all His body was as one stream of blood. He was crowned with a crown of thorns for despite ; and when the crown, as some writers say, would not set fast down to His head for the long thorns, they took staves and beat them down, until the thorns pierced the place of the brain. He was then nailed, hand and foot, with sharp nails, and rugged, that His pain might be the more, and so at last He suffered a painful death, hanging full shamefully on the hard tree. And all this he did and suffered of His own kindness,"], [237, "AN EMBASSY TO ROME. 209 without any sin of Himself, that He might deliver us from sin and pain, and bring us to everlasting bliss. Thou shouldst also think constantly, how, when He had made thee of nought, thou hadst forsaken Him, and all His kindness, through sin, and hadst taken thee to Satan and his service, world without end, had not Christ, God and man, suffered this hard death to save us. And thus see the great kindness, and all other goodness, which God hath shown for thee ; and thereby learn thy own great unkindness ; and thus thou shalt see that man is the most fallen of creatures, and the unkindest of all the creatures that ever God made. It should be full sweet and delightful to us to think thus on this great kindness, and this great love of Jesus Christ.\" 13. In 1375, Wickliffe was presented to the prebend of Aust, in the collegiate church of Westbury, diocese of Wor cester, and about the same time to the rectory of Lutterworth, in Leicestershire, where he obtained considerable repute as a preacher. Soon afterwards he formed one of an embassy despatched by Edward III. to Pope Gregory XL, to insist, in the name of the English people, \" That the pontiff should desist from the reservation of benefices in the Anglican Church ; that the clergy should henceforth freely enjoy their election to epis copal dignities ; and that it might be sufficient in the case of electing a bishop that his appointment should be confirmed by bis metropolitan, according to ancient custom.\" The embassy obtained not the shadow of a concession. The English parlia ment, determined to persevere in its independent course, next enacted a law against the usurpations of the Pope, declaring the election of bishops to be utterly independent of the papal sanction, and at the same time ordering an inquiry into the exact number and value of the benefices in the Anglican Church occupied by aliens. With this information the embassy a second time repaired to the pontifical court, and for two weary years the negotiation was protracted, terminating in a futile agreement which neither satisfied the public mind nor really limited the encroachments of the Pope. It has often been said that if you desire to make a man a Pro testant you should send him to Rome, and what Wickliffe saw in the immediate neighbourhood of the Father of the Church caused his soul to burn with righteous indignation. From p"], [238, "210 POSTSCRIPT IV. henceforth he was the declared enemy of Romanism. The early inspiration of his Bohemian teaching was confirmed by his close insight into the corruptions of the papal system. He saw vice rampant in the high places. Cardinals and priests living in open concubinage. The followers of the meek Sufferer of Nazareth robed in purples and couched in luxury. The holiest things profaned by lust and greed. His clear intel lect, as well as his pure heart, revolted from this shameless dis crepancy between the doctrine and the practice, the law and the law-maker ; and he turned to the Scriptures for consolation, hopefulness, and encouragement. What he read in the holy page did but confirm his faith, and establish him in his devout abhorrence of a corrupt and unclean church. What he read he preached, and his preaching sowed the seeds in England of that happy Reformation which in the fullness of time was matured by the blood of saints and martyrs. 14. An opponent of such power and vigour could not long expect an immunity from the terrors reserved by the Church of Rome for all who disputed her infallibility. That he escaped for several months must be considered due to the political dis tractions of the period, which had inflamed the popular mind against the prelacy, and the power that supported the prelacy in its tyrannous usurpations and profligate extravagance. A general desire was manifested to shake off the bondage of the Romish Church ; and Wickliffe was not the only Reformer in England, though he was the only Reformer who loudly pro claimed and openly defended his principles. The tide ran smoothly on the surface, but observant eyes detected beneath the roll of a powerful undercurrent. Nevertheless, the bolt, though long suspended, fell at last, and that it fell innocuously was not due to the uncertain hand of him who hurled it. 15. During the minority of Richard II. , the administration of affairs fell mainly into the hands of John of Gaunt, between whom and the leading English prelates existed a feud of the most inveterate character. His known sympathy with the doc trines which Wickliffe taught, and his open patronage of the pastor of Lutterworth, afforded his enemies an opportunity of striking at him, while they also crushed a pestilent and heretical reformer. He was accordingly summoned by William Courte nay, Bishop of London, before a council convened at St. Paul's"], [239, "211 PROGRESS. Cathedral (February, 1377). Wickcliffe duly appeared, accom panied by the Duke of Lancaster, and Lord Percy, the Earl Marshall. So great was the throng that it was with difficulty the retainers of these powerful nobles cleared an avenue of approach for the Reformer, and throughout the scene the people showed their strong sympathy with him by loud acclamations. But outside the cathedral the mob was composed of persons easily influenced by the Romish clergy, and when through the influence of John of Gaunt the prosecution was adjourned, these broke out into a violent disorder, and swept through the city like the waves of a destroying sea. The Savoy palace was assailed by a band of rioters, and the arms of the Duke, its owner, reversed as those of a traitor. A clergyman, mis taken for the Earl Marshall, was cruelly slaughtered. In these riotous proceedings the lord mayor and aldermen appear to have participated, and it is said that they were removed from their posts through the influence of the Duke, and their places supplied by citizens worthier of confidence. Thus, the first storm which burst over the head of the Reformer passed as harmlessly as a summer wind. 16. The first parliament of the reign of Richard II. assembled in October, 1377, and one of its earliest measures was directed against the intolerable encroachments of the ecclesiastical power, and the diminution of the burden which a protracted war had imposed upon the nation. The parliament proposed it as a question, whether, in urgent need, and as a means of self-pre servation, it was not lawful in a kingdom to prohibit the exportation of its treasure to foreign countries, notwithstanding the papal authority, and its menaces of censure and excommu nication. This thesis was referred to Wickliffe, and he solved it in a manner worthy of his intrepid spirit. \" When the Church was first endowed,\" he said, \" whoever among the clergy were then holders of any temporal possessions, held the same in the form of a perpetual alms. This is evident from histories, and from other writings. Hence St. Bernard, in his second book to the Pope Eugenius, declares that no secular dominion could be challenged by him on the ground of his office, as the vicar of St. Peter, and writes thus : \u2014 \u25a0' It may, indeed, be claimed by you, in virtue of some other plea, but assuredly by no right or title derived from the apostles ; for how p 2"], [240, "212 POSTSCRIPT IV. could an apostle give unto you that which he did not himself possess ? That care over the Church which he really had he gave you ; but when did he give you any worldy rule or lord ship ?\"' Observe what he said \u2014 ' Not bearing rule as lords over God's heritage, but yielding yourselves as examples to the flock.' And that ye may not think these words spoken in a show of humility, and not in truth, mark the words of our Lord himself in the Gospel \u2014 ' The kings of the nations have lordships over them, but it shall not be so with you.' Here lordly dominion is plainly forbidden to the apostles ; and wilt thou venture to usurp the same ? If a lord, thine apostleship is lost ; if an apostle, thy lordship is no more ; for certainly the one or the other must be relinquished. If both are sought, both shall be lost ; or, shouldest thou succeed, then judge thy self to be of that number respecting whom God so greatly complains, saying, ' They have reigned, but not through me ; they have become princes, but I have not known them.' And if men will keep that which is forbidden, let us hear what is said \u2014 ' He who is greatest among you shall be made as the least, and he who is the highest shall be your minister ;' and to illustrate this saying, He set a child in the midst of His disciples. This, then, is the true form and institution of the apostolic calling- \u2014 lordship and rule are forbidden; ministration and service are commanded. From these words of a blessed Man, whom the whole Church hath agreed to honour, it appears that the Pope has no right to possess himself of the goods of the Church, as though he were lord of them ; but that he is to be, with respect to them, as a minister or servant, and the proctor for the poor. And would to God that the same proud and eager desire of authority and lordship, which is now discovered by this seat of power, were aught else than a declension, preparing the pathway of Antichrist ! \" 17. The Church of Rome had already roused itself in earnest to crush its pertinacious enemy. On the 22nd of May, 1377, Pope Gregory had addressed a bull to Simon Sudbury, Arch bishop of Canterbury, and William Courtenay, Bishop of London, requiring them to cite Wickliffe before them to answer for his contumacious conduct. A second bull requested the favour and countenance of the king for this procedure, and a third com manded the University of Oxford to withdraw their protection"], [241, "A DANGER AND A TRIUMPH. 213 from its heretical and contumelious member. Theseletters reached England in the month of November, and the Archbishop imme diately addressed himself to the Chancellor of the University, demanding his judgment in writing on the doctrines and prac tices of Wickliffe. But as the chancellor showed himself by no means willing to move in the matter, the Archbishop next issued his mandate for the appearance of the Reformer before his ecclesiastical superiors in the cathedral of St. Paul. The synod was really held in Lambeth Palace, where Wickliffe presented himself, accompanied by so large a multitude of favouring citizens, that the court was smitten with a most undignified panic \u2014 a panic increased by the arrival of Sir Lewis Clifford, with a message from the queen-mother, which imperatively forbade the further prosecution of the suit. In an agony of apprehen sion the synod dissolved, with the simple injunction to the Reformer that he should abstain from the publication of his opinions, lest he should affect the faith of the laity \u2014 an in junction that was but as a breath of wind in the opinion of Wickliffe, who knew that it was the duty of a man to proclaim the truth as it revealed itself unto him. 18. Thus triumphant over his enemies, triumphant even against the power of Rome, Wickliffe continued to preach, and his doctrines to spread over the land as the flame rolls across a sea of lava. To account for the rapid growth of the faith which he asserted, it is necessary to take into account the nu merous causes that had prepared the popular mind for its recep tion. The love of independence which has always been so marked a characteristic of the Anglo-Saxon, rebelled against the pretensions put forward by a foreign power. The temporal supremacy of the Church of Rome, which is essential to the maintenance of its spiritual authority, was excessively repug nant to English sympathies. The occupation of the richest benefices by aliens was contrary to another marked tendency of the English mind \u2014 its antipathy to foreigners ; an antipathy nursed and cherished by the long wars with France waged by the warlike Plantagenets. The vices of the inferior clergy, the luxu rious arrogance of the higher ranks, had bred everywhere a feeling of abhorrence and disgust. Thus Wickliffe was supported by the general sentiments of the nation ; but he was also pro tected by the countenance of the crown, for no sovereign was"], [242, "214 POSTSCRIPT IV. likely to punish the man who not only preached the excellence of a devout life, but exhorted his fellow-worshippers to the practice of an earnest loyalty. What more could king expect from subject than the following ? \" The prelates of this world,\" he writes, \" and the priests, high and low, say freely and write in their law, that the king hath no jurisdiction nor power over their persons, nor over the goods of Holy Church. And yet Christ and His apostles were most obedient to kings and lords, and taught all men to be subject to them, and to serve them truly and cheerfully in bodily works, and to fear them, and honour them above all other men. The wise king Solomon, also, put down a high bishop who was unfaithful to him and his kingdom, and exiled him, and ordained a good priest in his room, as the Book of Kings telleth. And Jesus Christ paid tribute to the Emperor, and commanded men to pay him tri bute. St. Peter also commandeth Christian men to be subject to every ordinance of man, whether unto the king as more high than others, or unto dukes, as sent of him to the vengeance of evil doers, and the praising of good men. . . Who then hath made our worldy clergy exempt from the king's jurisdiction and chastening, since God hath given kings this office over all mis doers ? Clerks, and particularly high-priests, should be most meek and obedient to the laws of this world, as were Christ and His apostles ; and thus be a mirror to all men, that they may yield this meekness and obedience to the king and to his righteous laws. What sturdy robbers and traitors, then, are these to lords and kings, in refusing this obedience, and in thus giving an example to all the men of the land to become rebels against the king and the lords ! For in this, and in what they teach, they mistrust the commons of the land, both in words and deeds, to be unfaithful and rebellious to the king?\" 19. Through the causes we have briefly indicated the progress of Wickliffe's doctrines was remarkable. From London the waves of light rolled into the provinces, and some faint pulsa tions of the living tide throbbed even as far as the Continent, fertilising and blessing all within its reach. It was the dawn of a glorious day ; the sunrise on the hills heralding the glory of the coming noon. The prophet of this remarkable change, the seer who from the Pisgah of his lofty soul saw the distant"], [243, "A PARISH PRIEST. 215 wonders of the Promised Land, escaped that martyrdom which is the usual fate of the leaders of great moral revolutions. But his fortune in this respect was not due to any sudden lenity or unusual compunctions on the part of the Romish Church. Just at this time, that church was engaged in an intestine conflict which absorbed all its energies, and demanded all its attention. The death of Gregory XI. in 1378 was succeeded by a remark able schism. The tiara had long been worn by Frenchmen ; the Romans now resolved it should glitter upon an Italian brow. Accordingly they elected a Neapolitan, Bartholomew di Prag naro, Archbishop of Bari, who assumed the name of Urban VI. But a seceding body of cardinals retired to Fonde, where they chose as a successor to Gregory, Clement VII. Europe, there fore, was scandalised by the appearance of two suns in the heaven \u2014 two popes claiming to be infallible, \u2014 and this scandal, while it diverted the attention of the hierarchy from Wickliffe, lent additional force to his eloquence, and strength ened in men's minds the conviction of the truth of what he preached. 20. Exhausted by the severity of his labours, the Reformer was now stricken with a serious illness, which threatened a melancholy termination. He was staying at Oxford when thus afflicted, in the midst of the monastic orders whose excesses he had upbraided, and four monks, one from each order, quickly repaired to his bedside, to receive \u2014 as the)' fondly hoped \u2014 his confession and his recantation of the calumnies he had lavished upon them and their, church. But he had no recantation to utter, and his inward conviction was that death as yet hovered not upon his threshold. So it chanced that he speedily re covered, and with renewed vigour addressed himself to his great work \u2014 the overthrow of the papacy, in which he recognised the Antichrist of the Apocalypse. 21. As a parish priest Wickliffe set an example to the clergy of his generation, which it would have been well for the Romish Church had they generally followed. He was active in prayer, con stant iu well-doing, zealous in his service of the Lord. The Scripture was with him no cold and formal rule of faith, but a living, breathing revelation from on high, that warmed his whole being, and communicated a glow and radiance to his daily life. He considered it the highest service that men could"], [244, "216 POSTSCRIPT IV. attain on earth, to preach the word of God. Preaching, if it were well done, was, he said, the best thing of all. Three hundred of his pulpit compositions are extant, and in their simple fulness and clear explanation of the great truths ol Christianity, might be advantageously studied by many of our modern divines. Whether he was an orator or a rhetorician we have no means of ascertaining, but from what is known of his success as a parish priest he was undoubtedly gifted with a force of expression and vigour of thought which, if not eloquence, was as effective as eloquence in stirring the minds and hearts of his hearers. But he did not sum up his duties as beginning and ending in the pulpit. He went from house to house, warning, en- couraging, reproving, praising. His large intellect and generous sympathies eminently fitted him to enter into the doubts and diffi- culties and sorrows of his fellows. Above all, he was ever earnest in impressing upon the members of his flock the vital necessity of an earnest belief. He taught them to respect the sacraments as symbols of the Divine, but not to worship them in the place of the Divine ; not to believe in their efficacy apart from purity of life and contrition of soul. The Bible he set before them as the \" be-all and end-all \" of the Christian's progress, and his own admirable living was the best exponent of the truths he taught. \" His preaching much, but more his practice wrought (A living sermon of the truths he taught) ; For this by rules severe his life he squared, That all might see the doctrine which they heard. For priests, he said, are patterns for the rest (The gold of heaven, who bear the God impress'd); But when the precious coin is kept unclean, The Sovereign's image is no longer seen. If they be foul, in whom the people trust, Well may the baser coins contract a rust.\" \u2014 Dryden. 22. The Reformer next addressed himself to a noble labour, without which, he saw very plainly, the doctrines he professed could never obtain acceptance from the great body of the people. These doctrines were based upon the Bible, but the Bible in the Latin tongue was necessarily a sealed book to all but a very few. He resolved, therefore, to complete a translation of it into the vernacular. Translations of the Scripture into various languages had been partly accomplished before the days of Wickliffe. One of the most ancient of these was made"], [245, "TRANSLATIONS OF THE BIBLE. 217 for the use of the Armenian Christians in the fifth or sixth cen tury. Ulphilas, Bishop of the M\u0153so-Goths, rendered it into the Teutonic, adapting for the first time the Greek and Roman characters to that language. In the ninth century Aldhelm, Bishop of Sherborne, and Guthlac, a famous hermit, rendered the Psalms of David into Saxon, and Bede executed a transla tion of the Evangelist of St. John. In the reign of Alfred a Latin version of the Gospels was produced with an interlinear translation in Saxon ; and Alfred himself was employed upon a version of the Psalms at the time of his death. Numerous translations appeared, both before and after the Conquest, of portions of the Bible into Saxon and Norman ; and John de Trevisa, a native of Cornwall, translated the Gospels into English about the time of Wickliffe ; for the Anglo-Saxon, whose place of pride had long been usurped by the Norman, was beginning to recover something of its original importance. As the commonalty rose in wealth and political influence, so their language regained its vantage ground. The nobles and higher classes began to use it, and original works appeared in English, instead of in French or Latin. A more copious and plastic language, however, than the Saxon spoken by Alfred, now prevailed ; for it was enriched by numerous words and inflexions borrowed from the Norman, French, and Latin. Wickliffe, therefore, was right in supposing that an English translation of the Old and New Testaments would be generally acceptable, while it could not but extend a knowledge of the truths of revealed religion. Whether he was assisted in his task, or whether he executed it wholly by himself, is uncertain, but it appears that the entire work was finished, and several copies of it transcribed and put in circulation, before the great Reformer's death.* These copies must have rapidly multiplied, for in spite of the efforts of the Church of Rome to check their diffusion, numerous manuscript versions are still extant. 23. Wickliffe's translation is necessarily crude, but charac terised by much force, simplicity, and faithfulness. As a specimen we subjoin the often-quoted version of the Magnificat * Wickliffe's translation has been four times printed : \u2014 the New Testament, by Lewis, in 1731 ; edited by Baber, in 1810 ; and in 1841, in Bagster's English Hexapla ; the Old and New Testaments, edited by Forshall and Madden, in 1851."], [246, "218 POSTSCRIPT IV. (Luke i. 46\u201455), which bears a striking resemblance to the translation now in use : \u2014 \" And Marye seyde, My soul maguiSeth the Lord, and my spiryt hath gladid in God myn helthe. For he hath behulden the mekenesse of his handmayden : for lo, for this alle generationns schulen seye that I am blessid. For he that is mighti hath don to me grete thingis, and his name is holy. And his mercy is fro kyndrede into kyndredis to men that dreden him. He hath made myght in his arm, he scatteride proude men with the thoughte of his herte.

As he hath spoken to oure fadris, to Abraham, and to his seed into worlds.\" 24. Wickliffe's translation of the Bible was the first great blow that shook the splendid fabric of the Papal power. Its importance was keenly felt by the Romish hierarchy, who for bade its perusal by the laity \" under the pain of the greater excommunication.\" Lingard, the Catholic historian of England, candidly acknowledges the vast influence of the Reformer's work. \" Several versions of the sacred writings,\" he says, \"were even then extant ; but they were confined to libraries, or only in the hands of persons who aspired to superior sanctity. Wiclif made a new translation, multiplied the copies with the aid of transcribers, and by his poor priests recommended it to the perusal of their hearers. In their hands it became an engine of wonderful power. Men were flattered with the appeal to their private judgment ; the new doctrines insensibly acquired partisans and protectors in the higher classes, who alone were acquainted with the use of letters ; a spirit of inquiry was generated ; and the seeds were sown of that religious revolu tion which in little more than a century astonished and con vulsed the nations of Europe.\" To this testimony from the mouth of an able and unprejudiced Roman Catholic it is unnecessary to add anything. 25. Who can trace the progress of Truth, or note the thou sand channels through which its living waters run when once loosened from their secret source ? Who can tell in what rocky nooks, in what pleasant spots by the wayside, in what shadowy dingles and blooming brakes, the passing wind or the wandering birds deposit the seed which hereafter germinates into flower and"], [247, "wickliffe's work is done. 219 leaf? And so the full extent of the influence of the Reformation which Wickliffe accomplished cannot be accurately measured by the most painstaking investigator. It probably had an indirect share in the revolt which history associates with the name of Wat Tyler ; for freedom of thought in religious matters has a natural tendency to encourage freedom of thought in political affairs; aud he who resists a spiritual tyranny will not fear to protest against civil oppression. But it is idle to suppose that the insurrection was in any other way connected with Wickliffe or his followers. Still it afforded a pretext to Courtenay, then Archbishop of Canterbury, who represented their opinions as subversive of order and authority, and convened a synod at Grey friars, on the 17th of May, 1382, to consider how their progress might be checked. Thenceforward Authority called to its aid the sword of the Law to punish the free thought of free men. A statute was passed which provided for the punishment of heresy. Chains and a dungeon for those who dared to think in opposition to the Church of Rome ! Several eminent Lollards, as the Wickliffites now began to be called, were arrested and prosecuted, fined or imprisoned. Their great master did not utterly escape. Dis open condemnation of the dogma of tran substantiation especially aroused against him the hostility of the Romish hierarchy. He was driven out of Oxford, and con strained to abandon the lectures on divinity which had opened to so many minds the path of truth. Retiring to Lutterworth, he occupied himself in such writings as tended to establish the scriptural character of the doctrines he had taught. He was then summoned to appear before the Pope, and answer the charges of heresy preferred against him. But paralysis had seized his once vigorous frame, and instead of repairing to the papal court, he addressed to the Pope a letter in which he repeated the main dogmas of his faith. 26. Wickliffe was thereafter suffered to remain at Lutterworth undisturbed. His increasing maladies rendered him incapable of much exertion, but he still continued to expound in his writings the truth set forth by the Bible so far as he understood it. Death came to him on the 31st of December, 1384. Two days previously, during the celebration of mass, and just as the Host was about to be elevated, he had been seized for the second time with paralysis. He never recovered from the shock, but passed"], [248, "220 POSTSCRIPT IV. away from earth with the last shadows of the old year. He was but sixty-one years old when thus removed from the sphere of his life's work, but had made a mark on time which the Christian student and the philosophical observer will never cease to regard with admiration. 27. The Reformer was buried in a quiet grave in the tranquil little churchyard of Lutterworth, and there, for some years, his remains laid undisturbed. But the Church of Rome wreaks its vengeance not only on the soul and body of the living, but on the dust and ashes of the dead. In 1415 the Council of Con stance ordered that his body and bones, \"if they might be dis covered and known from the bodies of other faithful people, should be taken from the ground, and thrown away from the burial of any church, according to the canon laws and decrees.\" Thirteen years later, the barbarous injunction was barbarously fulfilled. The Reformer's grave was sacrilegiously opened, and the contents committed to the flames. The ashes were flung contemptuously into a neighbouring brook, \" which brook,\" as Fuller quaintly says, \" conveyed them into Avon, the Avon into the Severn, the Severn into the narrow seas, they into the main ocean ; and thus the ashes of Wickliffe were the emblem of his doctrine, which is now dispersed all the world over.\"* * Wickliffe's followers obtained the name of Lollards, according to some authorities, from lolium, the Latin for tares, which they professed to separate from the wheat in the doctrines of the Church. But Mosheim says : \u2014 \" Certain strolling hypocrites, who were called Lollards, or praisers of God [laus, laudis], deceived some women of quality in Hainault and Brabant. Because those who praised God generally did it in verse ; therefore, in the Latin style of the middle age, to praise God meant to sing to him, and such as were frequently employed in acts of adoration were called religious singers. And as prayers and hymns are regarded as a certain external sign of piety towards God, therefore those who aspired after a more than ordinary degree of piety and religion, and for that purpose were more frequently occupied in singing hymns of praise to God than others, were in the common, popular language called Lollards.\""], [249, "221 II.

The settler in the American woods who sets light to a pile of brushwood, or a heap of stubble, is ignorant to what an extent may spread the conflagration that he so thoughtlessly excites. The greedy flames seize upon the arid grass and the rank thick herbage ; on bough and branch, on the corn-field and the forest, aud roll, in billows of fire, destructive and irresistible, over a boundless waste of charred and smouldering ruin. In like manner the Lollard who first opposed the encroachments and denounced the dogmas of the Church of Rome could form no conception of the revolution which he was inaugurating, of the old traditions overthrown, the ancient customs trampled under foot, the prejudices which age made venerable scattered to the wind. The desolation was vast ; the destruc tion complete. But as on the prairie, cleared by fire and flame, rises the prosperous village and the busy hum of men, so on the debris of the shattered faith has been erected a structure of greater purity \u2014 a work not made by hands, eternal as the heavens. Freed from the corruption of the old patristic theo logy and the superstitions of medi\u00e6val ignorance, the Church of God lifts its spires and pinnacles to the skies, and reposes upon the foundation of love, faith, hope, and charity.

The torch which Wickliffe lighted passed from the hands"], [250, "222 POSTSCRIPT IV. of the English Reformer to the Apostle of Bohemia \u2014 to John Huss, a less serene and luminous genius, a more ardent and impetuous spirit. Huss was born at the town of Hussenitz, in Bohemia, about the year 1376. His parents were cf reputable position, and after carefully training their son at home, sent him to the University of Prague, where he acquired a very liberal education. The bias of his intellect soon became apparent, and he devoted himself to theological studies with such ardour and success \u2014 for knowledge rewards a thousand-fold the labours of her worshipper \u2014 that in 1393, when only sixteen years of age, he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree, and in 1395, that of Master of Arts. He probably entered upon the active duties of a pastor immediately, but it is not until 1400 that we find him mentioned as having taken orders, and as officiating as minister of a church in Prague. 3. The writings of Wickliffe had by this time obtained a considerable circulation in Bohemia, which partook of the intellectual excitement common to the rest of the civilised world, and rebelled against the thraldom of thought and feeling so long imposed by the Romish Church. Huss became a student of the Englishman's labours. His bold and impetuous genius was quickly kindled. The germs of fire lay dormant but vital, and needed only a spark to stir them into flame. From adopting Wickliffe's conclusions as his own, he pro ceeded to make them known to, and to enforce their truth upon, other minds. He preached and wrote against the errors of the Papacy with characteristic warmth and perseverance, and with that eloquence which seems natural to the earnest and enthu siastic. Like Luther, at a later period, he inveighed with special indignation against the traffic in indulgences, by which the greatest sinner bought absolution of the greatest crime. His denunciations were so effective that the Bohemians greatly relaxed in their contributions to the Romish treasury ; and the priesthood, taking alarm, branded him with the opprobrium of heresy, and declared that the cause of religion was in peril unless Huss and his followers were silenced. 4. To check the further progress of the evil, Subinco, Archbishop of Prague, issued two mandates, in the year 1408 ; by one of which he ordered the members of the university to collect all the writings of Wickliffe, and burn such as proclaimed"], [251, "PKOCEEDINGS AGAINST HUSS. 223 any doctrine contrary to the faith of the Church ; while by the other, curates and ministers were strictly enjoined to teach the people that the real body and blood of Christ were administered at the Eucharist. Huss immediately set himself to demonstrate the injustice of the one and the absurdity of the other mandate : the first being a direct encroachment upon the liberties and privileges of the members of the university \u2014 the second, an arrogant enunciation of a dangerous error. The students of Bohemia \u2014 all its ardent young intellects and liberal minds \u2014 rallied round their bold and eloquent teacher, and addressed an appeal to Pope Gregory XII. which resulted in a summons to the Archbishop Subinco to repair to Rome. But the victorv gained by the university was only partial. The prelate found no difficulty in persuading the Papal council that the heresy of Wickliffe, as expounded by Huss and his followers, was making rapid strides in Bohemia ; and obtained a bull authorising him to repress and punish the promulgation of heretical doctrines. 5. Subinco returned to Prague triumphant. He lost no time in putting his new powers into force ; publicly condemned the writings of the English Reformer; and instituted proceedings against four doctors who in disregard of his mandate had not brought in their copies. Huss, and others whom these proceed ings affected, again protested against the Archbishop's edicts, and once more appealed to Rome \u2014 to Pope John XXIII. \u2014 in the month of June, 1410. The pontiff, looking upon Huss as a man accused of heresy and sedition, and a dangerous firebrand, responded to the appeal by summoning him to appear in person at the Papal court, and commissioned the Cardinal Colonna to conduct the necessary investigation. But Huss was secure in the patronage of the King of Bohemia, Wenceslaus, of whose wife he was the principal confessor, and who, in his wrath against the Pope, to whose intrigues he attributed his loss of the imperial crown, encouraged him in his bold and uncompromising opposi tion. He therefore refused to obey the Papal citation, but sent three deputies to answer whatsoever charges might be alleged against him. Meanwhile, he busied himself in translating the Bible into Bohemian, and in propagating his doctrines with fiery zeal. Not that Huss was a \" Reformer,\" as that word is popularly understood : he was no Papist, but he was a Roman Catholic. He opposed the pretensions of the Pope, but"], [252, "224 POSTSCRIPT IV. accepted most of the tenets of the Church. The hostility against him was that of the priesthood, embittered by theological feeling. Huss was a Nominalist, his enemies were Realists ; and those were the days when the stake and the scaffold played an impor tant part in the disputations of the learned.* 6. The Cardinal Colonna was by no means disposed to listen to the pleas urged by the Bohemian deputies. He declared Huss guilty of contumacy, and pronounced upon him sentence of excommunication. His deputies then appealed to the Court of Rome. Four other cardinals were appointed commissioners to inquire into the matter, but actuated by the same spirit as Colonna, and influenced by the same traditions, they came to the same conclusion, and not only excommunicated Huss, but his partisans and adherents ; declared him an heresiarch, and thundered an interdict against him. Still, unmoved and un shaken, he continued to preach against the usurpation of the Pope and the vices of the priesthood, and aroused so free a spirit of inquiry, that the Archbishop Subinco applied to Wenceslaus to compose the excitement that prevailed by his royal authority. Wenceslaus was willing that Huss should expose the pretensions of the Pope, but by no means anxious that his subjects should be taught to scrutinise the claims of power. He therefore banished him from Prague, and the Reformer retired to Hussenitz, his native village, where he employed himself in the composition of various treatises, defend- * \" It was a most subtle question assuredly, and the world thought for a long while that their happiness depended on deciding, whether universals, that is genera, have a real essence, and exist independent of particulars, that is species: \u2014 whether, for instance, we could form an idea of asses, prior to individual asses ? Roscelinus, in the eleventh century, adopted the opinion that universals have no real existence, either before or in individuals, but are mere names and words by which the kind of individuals is expressed \u2014 a tenet propagated by Abelard, which produced the sect of Nominalists. But the Realists asserted that univer sals existed independent of individuals, \u2014 though they were somewhat divided between the various opinions of Plato and Aristotle. Of the Realists the most famous were Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus. The cause of the Nominalists was almost desperate, till Occam in the fourteenth century revived the dying embers. Louis XI. adopted the Nominalists, and the Nominalists flourished at large in France and Germany ; but, unfortunately, Pope John XXIII. patronised the Realists, and throughout Italy it was dangerous for a Nominalist to open his lips. The French king wavered, and the Pope triumphed ; his Majestv published an edict in 1474, in which he silenced for ever the Nominalists, and ordered their books to be fastened up in their libraries with iron chains, that thev might not be read by young students ! The leaders of that sect fled into England and Germany, where they united their forces with Luther and the first Reformers.\"\u2014 D Israeli's Curiosities of Literature."], [253, "225 THE HUSSITE INSURRECTION. ing and expounding the doctrines he had adopted. In Prague his place was filled by his faithful follower, the able and devoted Jerome, and the movement which his ardent spirit had inaugurated shook all Bohemia, and extended to the farthest confines of Germany. 7. It was about this epoch that Pope John XXIII. issued his bulls against Ladislaus, King of Naples, who had invaded (he territories of the Church. They promised remission of sins to every zealous soldier who joined in this new crusade, and repaired to the Papal standard, to drive back the heterodox spears and lances of the recusant Ladislaus. Huss, whose enemy, the archbishop, was now dead, returned to Prague, and inveighed lustily against the Papal bulls. With such zeal and eloquence did he paint the enormity of indulgences, as well as the other corruptions which were eating into the very heart of the Church, that the Bohemians, in a transport of enthusiasm declared Pope John to be Antichrist, and broke out into an open insurrection. Some of the ringleaders were seized by the authorities. The people proceeded to attempt their release, and only desisted on being promised that no injury should befall the prisoners. But the promise was speedily violated : they were put to death in prison. The Hussites flew to arms, broke open the prison gates, possessed themselves of the dead bodies, and marching in solemn procession to Huss's church \u2014 the Church of Bethlehem \u2014 honoured them with a decorous sepulture.* 8. The emperor and the Pope now resolved to crush the Reformer, whose preaching boded no good either to ecclesias tical despotism or secular tyranny. In the month of November, 1414, a General Council had assembled at Constance, for the purpose of determining the claims of three rival popes \u2014 John XXIII., Gregory XII., and Benedict XIII. , \u2014 each of whom arrogated to himself the rank and power of sovereign pontiff. John was supported by the Italians, Gregory by the French, and Benedict by the Spaniards. The Council continued to sit for four years, and attempted much for the reformation of the Church ; deposing John as a liar, a murderer, and an adulterer ; and healing the great schism of the West by proclaiming Car dinal Ottone Colonna, Pope, under the name of Martin V., aud * Dupin, Nouvell. Bill, des Aut. Ecclcs., tome xii. p. 132-140. Q"], [254, "226 POSTSCRIPT IV. decreeing the absolute supremacy of a general council over the occupants of the Papal throne.* 9. But while engaged in these weighty affairs the members of the Council did not forget to deal their heaviest blows at heresy. John Huss was summoned before it, in accordance with the agreement stipulated by Pope John and the emperor ; and Sigismund, who \"had no design against his life, seut him a safe-conduct, that he might travel to and from Constance without apprehension. The Reformer accordingly set out, after making a public declaration that he was going before the General Council, to reply to the accusations levelled against him, and challenging all people, who had aught to except to his life and conversation, to make their charges without delay. In every town through which he passed he made a similar declaration ; and in every town was received with the most enthusiastic demon strations of love and reverence. The streets and the highways were thronged with persons attracted by respect rather than by gratitude. He entered the public places as a conqueror proceeding to his triumph, and a torrent of joyous acclamation rolled along the wayside in the track of the Reformer's feet. In Germany he was welcomed with so singular an enthusiasm that he exclaimed, \" I thought I had been an outcast ; but I now see that my worst friends are in Bohemia.\" 10. He arrived at Constance upon the 3rd of November, 1414, and immediately repaired to his humble lodgings. Here he was visited by Stephen Paletz, whom the priests of Prague had engaged for the prosecution, and Michel de Cassis, whose services had been secured by the Court of Rome. They de clared themselves his accusers, and indicated to him the nature of the charges he would be required to answer. Afterwards, a formal series of articles against him were laid before the Pope and the prelates of the Council. Fearful that he might escape \u2014 not their justice but their vengeance \u2014 they ventured upon treating the imperial safe-conduct with open disregard, and declaring that faith ought not to be kept with heretics, they caused him to be arrested, and committed prisoner to a chamber in the palace. One of Huss's friends complained to the Pope of this breach of the imperial word. He only replied that he had given no passport himself, and cared nothing for that of * Lenfant, Histoire du Concile de Constance, tome ii."], [255, "227 THE COUNCIL OF CONSTANCE. the emperor ; and the emperor's own indignant protests he treated with the utmost contumely. For six weary months Huss was kept in captivity, removed from prison to prison, and con strained to endure the greatest hardships. Meanwhile, the council pronounced sentence of condemnation on the doctrines of Wickliffe, and in their impotent fury ordered his remains to be exhumed and burned. They condemned the doctrines of Huss, and would probably have adjudged and sentenced him unheard, but for the indignant interference of the nobles of Poland and Bohemia. 11. He was summoned at length before the Council, and upwards of forty articles, extracted from his writings, were exhibited against him. The following \u2014 the eighth \u2014 will in dicate the animus of his accusers. \" An evil and a wicked pope is not the successor of Peter, but of Judas.\" This decla ration was alleged against him as a crime. Huss replied : \u2014 \" I wrote this in my treatise : if the Pope be humble and meek, neglecting and despising the honour and lucre of the world ; if he be a shepherd, taking his name from feeding of the flock of God ; if he feed the sheep with the Word, and with virtuous example, and that he become even like his flock with his whole heart and mind ; if he diligently and carefully labour and travail for the Church, then is he without doubt the true vicar of Christ. But if he walk contrary to these virtues, so much as there is no society between Christ and Belial, and Christ himself saith, ' He that is not with me is against me,' how is he then the true vicar of Christ and Peter, and not rather the vicar of Antichrist ? Christ called Peter himself, Satan, when he opposed Him only in one word, and that with a good affection, even him whom He had chosen His vicar, and specially appointed over His Church. Why should not any other then, being more opposed to Christ, be truly called Satan, and consequently Anti christ, or at least the principal minister or vicar of Antichrist. Infinite testimonies of this matter are found in St. Augustine, St. Jerome, Cyprian, Chrysostom, Bernard, Gregory, Remigius, Ambrose, and all the holy fathers of the Christian Church.\" 12. Little did the eloquence or truthfulness of Huss avail him. The Council determined to burn him as a heretic, unless he recanted, and flung him into a noisome dungeon, loading him with fetters so that he could barely move, and at night Q 2"], [256, "228 POSTSCRIPT IV. binding his hands to an iron ring let in to the dungeon wall. Such punishments as these the intrepid Reformer accepted as trials of his faith and constancy, and remained unmoved. The angel of God stood by him in the shadow, and comforted him. When four bishops and two lords implored him, in the name of the emperor, to make a recantation, he called heaven to witness, with tearful eyes, that he was unconscious of having preached or written anything against the truth of God, or the faith of his orthodox Church. The great wisdom and illustrious authority of the Council were objected to him. He replied : \u2014 \" Let them send the meanest person of that council to convince me by arguments based on the Word of God, and I will submit my judgment to him.\" Reason only could move him from his belief: the terrors of the law, the oppressions of power, had no influence upon his calm and courageous spirit. 13. He was brought before the Council, for the last time, on the 6th of July; but after 'undergoing a protracted examina tion, refused to abjure. His death was then determined upon ; and the Bishop of Lodi preached the usual Martyr's Sermon, from the text, \" Let the body of sin be destroyed.\" Judgment was afterwards pronounced. He was condemned as an ob stinate and incorrigible heretic ; he was degraded from the priesthood \u2014 his books were ordered to be burned \u2014 and he him self was handed over to the civil power. Receiving his sen tence with matchless \u2022composure, he knelt upon the ground, raised his eyes towards heaven, and in a clear, loud voice exclaimed \u2014 \" May thine infinite mercy, O my God, pardon this injustice of mine enemies ! Thou knowest the iniquity of my accusations : how deformed with crimes I have been repre sented : how I have been oppressed by worthless witnesses, and a false condemnation ; yet 0 my God ! let that mercy of thine, which no tongue can express, prevail with thee not to avenge my wrongs ! \" 14. Enraged by the Reformer's serene composure, and aghast at the effect it produced upon the people, the bishops nominated by the Council stripped him of his sacerdotal robes, degraded him according to the forms of the Romish Church, and put upon his brow a crown of paper, painted with fiendlike figures, and inscribed with the word Heresiakch in large letters. This contumely he endured with the indifference of a great spirit, and"], [257, "nUSS'S MARTYRDOM. 229 it seemed \" to give him dignity rather than disgrace.\" Re joicing at the imminent approach of death, which to him was the threshold of a world of ineffable bliss, he turned to the admiring throng that crowded, with tearful eyes, around him, and when the bishops still urged him to recant, exclaimed \u2014 \" These lords and bishops exhort and counsel me, that I should here confess before you all that I have erred ; the which, if it were such as might be done with the infamy and reproach of man only, they might, peradventure, easily persuade me there unto ; but now truly I am in the sight of the Lord my God, without whose great displeasure, and disquietude of mine own conscience, I could by no means do that which they require of me. For I well know that I never taught any of those things which they have falsely alleged against me, but I have always preached, taught, written, and thought contrary thereunto. With what countenance then should I behold the heavens ? With what face should I look upon them whom I have taught, whereof there is a great number, if through me it should come to pass that those things, which they have hitherto known to be most certain and sure, should now be made uncertain ? Should I by this example astonish or trouble so many souls, so many consciences, endured with the most firm and certain knowledge of the Scriptures and Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ and his most pure doctrine, armed against the assaults of Satan ? I will never do it, neither commit any such kind of offence, that I should seem more to esteem this vile carcass appointed unto death, than their health and salvation.\" 15. On the 6th of July, Huss was led to the place of execution in the suburbs of Constance. When he approached the fatal pile, he threw himself on his knees, sung several portions of the Psalms in a clear and unfaltering voice, and with eyes fixed upon heaven, repeated, \" Into thy hands, 0 Lord ! do I commit my spirit : thou hast redeemed me, O most good and faithful God ! \" As soon as he was fastened to the stake, he cried with a smiling countenance, \" My Lord Jesus Christ was bound with a harder chain than this for my sake ; why, then, should I be ashamed of this old rusty iron ?\" The faggots being heaped around him, the Duke of Bavaria earnestly entreated him to abjure his errors. \"No,\" he replied, undauntedly; \" I never preached aught of an evil tendency ; and what I taught with my"], [258, "230 POSTSCRIPT IV. lips I now seal with my blood.\" Then turning to the doomsman, he said, \" You are now going to burn a goose (the word Huss signifying \" goose \" in the Bohemian tongue), but in a century you will have a swan whom you can neither roast nor boil.\"* As soon as the pile was kindled, the martyr began to sing aloud a hymn, his voice rising, strong and unfaltering, above the din of the multitude and the crackling of the whirling fire ; nor did he cease until the flames had done their work, and a heap of charred and blackened dust was all that remained on earth of John Hoss. 16. All? But no: his influence survived him. His memory and his renown endured. His example taught others to brave all things in the name of Christ, and Jerome of Prague caught from his hands the falling torch. The heroic Ziska was fired by his spirit, and by the faith which he had preached and sealed with his blood. Thence arose the Hussite war, con vulsing Germany for many years of change and strife \u2014 break ing up the ancient barriers erected by the zealous tyranny of Rome, and preparing the mind of Europe for the bold and vigorous doctrines of Luther. Thus, the lessons which Bohemia had given to England, and which through Wickliffe's agency returned to Bohemia, and awakened the heroic genius of Huss, descended by sure and unerring steps to the great monk of Wittemberg, and laid the foundation of the polity and creed of Protestantism. And so the thoughts of men are widened by the process of the suns, and every generation adds a link to that golden and eternal chain which is destined to rivet Earth with Heaven ! * As \" a swan \" was the armorial bearings of Luther, zealous Protestants have chosen to believe that Huss in his last moments was animated by a spirit of prophecy. But, indeed, without referring to any particular individual, he might well conclude that his blood would not be outpoured in vain, and that the True Religion would rise, in all its majesty, triumphant over the fires kindled by Bigotry and Superstition in the suburbs of Constance."], [259, "231 III.

The work makes the man, and the work which Martin Luther wrought was of such incalculable importance, and pro duced such pregnant results, that it is no wonder he stands out as the master worker of modern European history \u2014 the man who, in these later ages, has most influenced the course of events. The empires of Charlemagne and Napoleon fade into nothingness be fore the royalty enjoyed by the great Reformer. The millions who owned Charlemagne and Napoleon as lord were neither equal in numbers to, nor as united in heart and soul as, the millions who still acknowledge his supremacy. The truths he taught, the truths which that trumpet voice of his sent through the shud dering darkness to awaken the slumbering nations, flourish on the vast continent of America, among the palms of Africa, under the glowing sky of Brahma and Vishnu, in the depths of Australian wildernesses. Did ever human man accomplish more ? Protestantism is almost wholly the out-growth of his great intel lect, while Catholicism has been built up by the successive labours of many generations. No one pope established the Papacy, but Luther alone founded and erected the Lutheran Church. No councils, no colleges of cardinals, have contributed to the work. With minor differences, the Lutheranism of England resembles the Lutheranism of Germany, and the Pro testantism of to-day is the Protestantism of yesterday. It shows the power and comprehensiveness of Luther's genius, that to"], [260, "232 POSTSCRIPT IV. the religion which he educed from \"the inspired pages of the written revelation, the inquiries of the most searching observers have made few important additions ; and from that religious system the objections of the most erudite critics have removed but few excrescences. Like the prophets of old, he was inspired, we may almost believe, by the God whose Truth he proclaimed. His mission was no ordinary one, and he was gifted with no ordinary powers to accomplish it. 2. What is the general impression entertained by his fol lowers of this extraordinary man ? Do they rightly estimate his character ? Is the Luther of their imaginations the Luther of history, or what is still more important, the actual Luther who lived and moved among men ? The prevalent idea is, we are persuaded, an erroneous one \u2014 that he was \" a compound of ruggedness and violence;\" that he combined the eloquence of St. Paul with the hot temper of St. Peter ; that he was insensible to kindly feelings and tolerant sympathies ; that much of the Boanerges mingled with and degraded the apostle ; that he stalked through the world an arbitrary and fierce-souled tyrant, like the whirlwind, destroying while purifying, uprooting the stately forest while sweeping the pestilence from earth. No ideal can be more unworthy of the man, no estimate can be less supported by facts. It arises in the popular error which con fuses a rough exterior, a vehemence of expression, and im petuosity of disposition, with ferocity of heart and brutal cruelty of action ; and regards the soft speech and bland manner as indications of extreme sensibility, refined delicacy, and the gentlest virtues. Such an opinion is assuredly not justified by any analogy in nature. The velvet paw conceals the talons; the sleekness of the tiger does not betray his greed of blood. The frank, honest spirit, interpenetrated by an intense faith in the truths it has adopted, will naturally burst through all merely conventional restraints. It is its very candour and enthusiasm that affright the exquisite sensibilities of the dainty falsehood, and disgust the artificial delicacy of artificial minds. The warm heart grasps your hand with a rough and earnest grip; the frigid rocky nature chills you with cold repelling fingers. 3. One of the most admirable estimates of Luther, as a man, with which we are acquainted, is furnished by an anonymous writer in Blackwood's Magazine : \u2014 \" Nothing,\" says this genial"], [261, "luther's character. 233 critic, \" could exceed Luther's submissiveness and humility, when a choice was left him whether to be humble or darin_ \u2022 but when conscience spoke, no other consideration was for a moment attended to, and he certainly did then shake the forest with his magnificent ire. But if we behold him one mo ment, to use his own quotation from Scripture, pouring contempt upon princes, and highly raging against the highest upon earth, we see him the next, in his familiar correspondence, a poor, humble, afflicted man, not puffed up with pride at the great things he had accomplished, but rather struck down by a sense of his own unworthiness. As to his violence, it was part of his mission to be violent, and those who lay it to his charge as blameworthy, seem to us not to accuse him, but to accuse Provi dence. Not to have been violent, would, in him, have been not to have been in earnest. And here it must \u25a0 be observed, that his violence was only verbal ; it was merely the rousing voice to awaken Europe from the lethargy of ages. In his opinions and views he was the most moderate of all the reformers. In his coarseness, however, his low origin certainly speaks out ; yet there is something sublime in the peasant (the miner's son) dragging popes and kings into his wrestling-ring, and handling them with as much roughness and as little ceremony as he would a hob-nailed clown from a country market-place. But let us follow him into private life. Here it is that we shall best learn to appreciate him. We will not dwell upon his constant contentment iu poverty, and his contempt for riches, because this is the characteristic of almost all great men, who are really worth more than gold can procure them ; but his long, unbroken friendship with Melancthon \u2014 a character so opposite to his own, and in some respects so superior, as he was the first to acknow ledge himself \u2014 has always struck us as a proof that he possessed much sweetness and gentleness of disposition. Envy or jealousy never interrupted for a moment the fraternal affec tion that subsisted between these great men. Of those passions, indeed, Luther seems not to have been susceptible. Neither did personal ambition come near him. Though he had so many titles to it, he never claimed the supremacy over his contempo rary reformers. Notwithstanding the great things he had per formed, he gave himself no air of grandeur or importance ; he seemed to consider himself as a common man among common"], [262, "234 POSTSCRIPT IV. men. He was Doctor Martin Luther, and nothing more. There was a simplicity and commonness in his habits and conversation which contrasts wonderfully with the mighty revo lution he brought about. This simplicity, we were going to say, shows his native greatness ; but we correct ourselves, and add, that it exhibits that apostolic frame of mind which all the messengers of God, from Moses downwards, have displayed. Such men are moulded at once by the Hand that sends them. The accidents of this world have no power (as they have upon others) to change or modify their moral conformation. There is a oneness, a wholeness, an uncompoundedness of character in these elect instruments ; on their moral frame is chiselled by the Divine finger one idea, and one only- \u2014 and that external to their earthly condition. Hence was begotten the simplicity and homeliness of Luther's walk in life. Had he acted the great man, he would have proved he was not the apostle. The frank, popular, coarse, and somewhat peasant bearing which marked him, has made him the hero of the populace to this day in Ger many. What is also remarkable (in a man of his indubitable and profound piety) is that he had no sanctified airs, no auste rity. On the contrary, he loved painting, music, singing, and decent conviviality. We wish, indeed, it were not considered necessary now-a-days to assume a peculiar solemnity, a peculiar formality of manners, as a badge of piety. Nothing makes so many hypocrites as this. The pious man should endeavour to avoid, as much as possible, the external manifestations of his piety \u2014 all that can be imitated without being realised. In this matter Luther was a perfect model. We feel thoroughly con vinced that all which he possessed was real, precisely because there was no show, no parade whatever of sanctity about him. In his family, and among his neighbours, he was jovial, affec tionate, debonnaire. His piety was not put on him, but broke out of him. It flowed in a mingled stream with his every-day life and conversation. The gravel and the gold rolled together in the rich channel of his mind, and he made no effort to exhibit only the one and conceal the other.\" 4. In considering the imperfections of Luther's character, we are bound also to consider the tendencies aud influences of the age in which he lived, and the nature of the work which he had to do. A man may be ever so much in advance of his age,"], [263, "THE AGE INFLUENCES THE HERO. 235 and yet not unaffected by its spirit. In passing through a seething and roaring furnace you may escape personal injury, but you will carry away with you the odour of the fire. Luther's adversaries dealt to him the same measure which he gave to them. Even the mild and amiable Melancthon indulged in a licence of language which we should now-a-days regard with disgust. When the flood-gates are opened the rush of the waters brings down with them much of mire, and froth, and pollution, which gradually disappears as the river rolls into its definite channel, and meanders tranquilly between its flowery banks. \" In passing judgment,\" says Dr. Robertson, \" upon the characters of men, we ought to try them by the principles and maxims of their own age, not by those of another ; for although virtue and vice are at all times the same, manners and customs vary continually. Some parts of Luther's be haviour which appear to us most culpable gave no disgust to his contemporaries. It was even by some of those qualities, which we are now apt to blame, that he was fitted for accomplishing the great work which he undertook. To rouse mankind, when sunk in ignorance or superstition, and to encounter the rage of bigotry armed with power, required the utmost vehemence of zeal, as well as a temper daring to excess. A gentle call would neither have reached nor have excited those to whom 'it was addressed. A spirit more amiable but less vigorous than Luther's would have shrunk back from the dangers which he braved and surmounted.\" A war-song can breathe no soft Arcadian strain, but must throb with the fulness and spirit of the Tyrt\u00e6an or Alcaic measure. Do not let us frame for ourselves a Luther of the nineteenth century ; it is with the Luther of the sixteenth, the pioneer of ages of civil and religious progress, that we have to deal. Revolutions are not made with rose-water, and of all the revolutions which the history of our world records, none has been so important in its results, so momentous in its consequences, as the Lutheran. From the Reformation, which though it certainly began before his era, was so wrought out, developed, and completed by him, that it deserves to be eter nally associated with his name \u2014 from the Reformation dates the era of civil liberty, the era of nationalities, the era of popular and constitutional government. From the very necessities of his position, from the very tendencies of the doctrines which he"], [264, "236 POSTSCRIPT IV. enunciated, Luther, insensibly to himself perhaps, became a political as well as a religious reformer. \" If he did not abso lutely create,\" says Michelet, \" he at least courageously identified with his name the great revolution which legalised in Europe the right of free examination.\" 5. Martin Luther was born at Eisleben, on the 10th of No vember, 1483, at eleven o'clock in the evening. \" I am the son,\" he said himself, \" of a peasant ; my father, my grandfather, my great-grandfather were all mere peasants. My father went to Mansfeldt and became a miner there. It was there I was born. That I should become at a later period B.A., D.D., and what not, was certainly not written in the stars, at least not to ordinary readers. How I astonished everybody when I turned monk, and yet again, when I exchanged my brown cap for another ! These doings vexed my father sorely \u2014 nay, made him quite ill for a time. After that I began pulling the Pope about by the hair of his head; I married a runaway nun; I had children by her! Who saw these things in the stars ? \" 6. Martin Luther's father was Hans (John) Luther, Lutter, Ludher, or Lother, who removed from Moer, in Upper Saxony, to Eisleben just before the birth of his illustrious son. His mother, was Margaret Lindemann, originally a servant at the baths \u2014 a chaste, devout, and virtuous woman. Luther's enemies have found matter of ridicule in his name, his birth, his family. Roscoe quotes a coarse epigram on his name : \u2014 \" Germanis Lutter, scurra est, latro Bohemis : Ergo quod est Lutter, scurra latroque simuL With respect to his birth, they falsified its date that they might make the stars subserve their malignant hostility. Guaricus, a Romish prelate, asserted that the arch-heretic was born on the 22nd of October, 1484, at ten minutes past one in the after noon. Behold the consequences ! \u2014 \" Five planets, Jupiter, Venus, Mars, Saturn, and Mercury, to which may be added the Sun and Moon, being in conjunction under Scorpio, in the ninth station of the heavens, which the Arabians apportioned to religion, made this Luther a sacrilegious heretic, a most bitter and profane foe to the Christian faith. From the horo scope being directed to the conjunction of Mars, he died with-"], [265, "luther's early years. 237 out any sense of religion.\" But in this matter we prefer the testimony of Lnther's mother to that of Guaricus or Jerome Cardan. Luther's father was by occupation a miner, but he contrived out of his savings to purchase a small plot of ground ; and sub sequently he was appointed to a magisterial office, whose duties he discharged with the entire approval of his fellow-townsmen. He was extremely attached to his children, but a rigid disci plinarian. Luther says, such was his fear of him, that he always concealed himself in the chimney corner when he had done aught to excite his anger ; and of his mother he relates, that one day for stealing a hazel-nut she beat him till the blood flowed. They showed themselves, however, justly anxious in respect to his education, and practised the severest economy that they might send him to school. At six years old he could read and write with ease. To eke out the scanty subsistence of the family, the boy was wont, when his school-tasks were done, to sing before people's ''houses, as was the custom in those days of the poorer German students. \" Let no one in my presence,\" he says, \" speak scornfully of the poor fellows who wend from door to door, singing and begging bread propter Deum ! You know the psalm says, Principes, et reges cantaverunt. I myself was once a poor mendicant, soliciting alms at people's houses, particularly at Eisenach, my own dear Eisenach ! \" 7. In the month of May, 1497, when in his fifteenth year, he set out from Mansfeldt, whither his father had removed from Eisleben, for Bernburg \u2014 his knapsack on his back, a stout ashen cudgel in his hand, and hot tears rolling down his cheeks. He was accompanied by one Hans Reinicke, and their object was to avail themselves of the currend schulen at Magdeburg, where each boy paid for his board and education with the alms he collected from the richer townsmen, and the money he earned as a chorister. Martin quitted Magdeburg in 1498, and pro ceeded to Eisenach, where he found an asylum under the roof of a most charitable and worthy woman, Dame Ursula Cotta, the widow of Hans Schweikard. At Eisenach Luther studied grammar, rhetoric, and poetry under a famous master \u2014 J. Tre bonius, rector of the convent of the Bare-footed Carmelites, who himself was sufficiently sagacious aud talented to appre-"], [266, "238 POSTSCRIPT IV. ciate his young scholar's ready comprehension, his natural eloquence, his elocutionary gifts, and his skill in prose and poetical composition. To the end of his days Luther ceased not to cherish a grateful memory of the generosity of his bene factress, which opened to him so splendid a career of usefulness, 8. His father's improving circumstances admitted, in 1501. of Luther's entering the University of Erfurt, in Thuringia, in whose register his name is duly inscribed as Martinus Ludher, ex Mansfield. It is worth while to record the names of the instructors whose influence was brought to bear upon the young student's nascent genius. These were Jodocus Truttvetter, whose death he afterwards accused himself of having hastened by his rebellion against the scholastic theology ; Jerome Emser, who expounded the poetics of Reuchlin ; Gerard Hecker, an Augustine monk, who afterwards became a convert to Pro testantism, and introduced its doctrines into his convent ; Bar tholomew Usinger, who remained faithful to the old religion ; and John-Grevenstein, who looked upon Huss as a martyr. At Erfurt he studied theology and law, the belles lettres and music. The latter, throughout life, was his favourite art, wherein his great passionate soul found consolation and repose \u2014 the Jacob's ladder, on which angels continually ascended and descended to communicate celestial tidings to his mind. \" Music,\" he would say, \" is the art of the prophets ; it is the only other art which, like theology, can soothe the storms of the soul, and put the devil to flight.\" But for the other arts and for literature generally, which the invention of printing had now rendered accessible, he manifested a decided inclination. Nor was he averse to innocent amusements. He joined with a genial mirth in the pastimes of the German student-life of the period. Nothing in his early character indicated the religious Reformer ; and no contrast can be imagined more complete than that between Luther disputing with the Archbishop of Treves, or proclaiming his faith before the Diet, and Luther travelling a-foot at Easter-time from Eisenach to Mansfeldt, his sword on one thigh, his dagger on the other, and awkwardly wounding himself with his own weapons. 9. Melancthon informs us that at Erfurt Luther read most of the Latin classics whose writings had been preserved, and that when but twenty years old his acquirements procured him the"], [267, "239 THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW. title of Master of Arts. In 1505 his future career was determined by an accident. He saw one of his friends killed by lightning at his side. The shock wrung from his heart a vow to St. Anne that if he escaped the storm he would become a monk. He fulfilled his vow by entering the Augustine monastery at Erfurt, on the seventeenth of July, and entered upon a life of the extremest self-denial. \"If,\" he says, \"Augustine went straight to heaven from the walls of a monastery, I too ought to do so, as all my brethren would testify. I fasted, I watched, I mortified the flesh, I practised all the cenobitic austerities, until I absolutely fell very ill. It is not my enemies who will believe this \u2014 the men who talk only of the pleasures of a monastic life, and have never experienced any spiritual temp tation.\" The sole grace with which he relieved the monotony of his days was music. He often amused himself by sing ing hymns. He was specially fond of the Gregorian chant, and his greatest delight was to take a part with some young chorister. The severities which he practised and the solitary hours of intense thought to which he condemned himself had their usual effect. He was soon beset by the mysteries of spiritual temptation. Like our own Bunyan, he had to fight his way through the Valley of the Shadow, to wrestle with his own doubts, and manfully oppose his own delusions. Often might he be seen at the foot of the altar, his hands clasped, his eyes full of tears, earnestly imploring Heaven to pardon his sins. Often, on returning to his cell for the night, he would fling him self on his knees at the foot of his bed, and remain in abstracted prayer until the morning dawned. \" When I was young,\" he says in his Tischreden, \" it happened that I was taking part, in my priestly robe, in a procession on Corpus Christi day, at Eisleben. Suddenly, the sight of the Holy Sacrament, borne by Dr. Staupitz, so terrified me that I perspired at every pore, and thought I should die with fear. When the procession was over, I confessed to Dr. Staupitz, and related what had happened. He replied, ' Thy thoughts are not according to Christ ; Christ does not terrify, He consoles.' These words filled me with joy, and greatly relieved my mind \". . . . On another occasion, he said to Dr. Staupitz, \"Ah, dear doctor, our Lord God acts in an awful manner towards us ! Who can serve Him,"], [268, "240 POSTSCRIPT IV. if He thus smites all around Him?\" To which he rejoined, \" My son, learn to think of God more wisely : if He did not act thus, how could He subdue the strong and impetuous ? He must take heed of the tall trees lest they would climb to Heaven.\" Again, he says, \" Ah, if St. Paul were alive now, how glad I should be to learn from himself what species of temptation it was that he underwent. It was not the thorn in the flesh ; it was not the worthy Tula, as the Papists dream. Oh no ! it was not a sin that wrung his conscience. It was something loftier than that despair which results from the sense of sin ; it was rather the temptation of which the Psalmist speaks, ' My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me ?' As though the Psalmist would have said, ' Thou art my enemy without cause ;' and, with Job, ' Yet I am innocent, nor is iniquity in me.' I am certain that the Book of Job is a true his tory, of which a poem was afterwards made. Jerome and other fathers never experienced such trials. They endured none but trivial temptations, those of the flesh, which indeed have quite enough pains of their own accompanying them. Augustine and Ambrose, too, had trials, and trembled before the sword ; but what is this compared with the angel of Satan, ' who strikes with the fists.' If I live, I will write a book on Temptations, for without a knowledge of the subject no man can thoroughly comprehend the Holy Scriptures, or feel the due love and fear of the Lord.\" 10. To these mysterious inward agonies a weak mind suc cumbs : a strong mind conquers them, and acquires fresh strength from its victory. Thus, in this warfare of the soul, Luther carried off the garland and the palm, and struggled out of the darkness and the shadow into exceeding light. At the age of three and twenty, the business of his monastery took him into Italy. The journey opened up a new era in his life, and may be regarded as the epoch from whence dates the origin of the Lutheran Reformation. His intellect revolted from the superstitions, his Soul from the vices, of the Italian capital. The Italy of the Borgias was not calculated to attract the pure sympathies or satisfy the high moral sense of the monk of Erfurt. He went thither with such bright hopes, such brilliant imaginations ! \u2014 with those poetic dreams which necessarily occupy the mind of the student who has basked in the glory of"], [269, "241 LUTHER AT ROME. the old Roman literature, and filled his memory with the achievements of the great days of old, \u2014 with that devout sen timent which not unnaturally attracts the Catholic pilgrim to the chief seat of his religion \u2014 the Holy City! Ah, how bitter the reality ! How unlike his fancy the city of monks and cour tesans, pomp, pride, and luxury ! He tells us how he entered it, at the convent of his order, near the Porto del Popolo : \u2014 \" On arriving, I fell on my knees, raised my hands to heaven, and cried out, ' Hail, holy Rome ! made holy by the holy martyrs, and by the blood which has been spilt here.' \" He also tells us with what feelings he left it : \u2014 \" I would not for a hundred thousand florins have missed seeing Rome (he repeats these words thrice). I should always have entertained an uneasy doubt whether, after all, I was not doing injustice to the Pope. As it is, I am quite satisfied on this point.\" He had seen that. with whatever flowers the desolation might be concealed, the lava-flood, black and fatal, lay darkling at the bottom of all. He had seen that the Jupiter of the sculptor which he had been taught to reverence, was but an image made by a sordid crafts man. Earnest and sincere himself, he revolted from the insin cerity and profane indifference which characterised every order of the Church ; and \" with thoughts arising in his heart,\" the germs of a religious revolution, he turned his back upon the city of the Popes, and hastened homeward to his monastic soli tude. 11. On his return he applied himself with earnest devotion to the study of the Scriptures, reading them with the aid of Erasmus, whose interpretation, however, did not always satisfy him. His repute as a scholar obtained him, at this juncture, the chair of Professor of Philosophy in the new University of Wittemberg, and the Elector of Saxony's letter requiring him to take possession of it was so urgent that he had scarcely time to take leave of his friends. His luggage, however, was not a matter to delay him ; it contained a coarse stuff robe, a small stock of linen, two Bibles, one Latin and one Greek, and a few books. \" The physics and ethics,\" says Monsieur Audin, \" to which his attention was now directed, suited his taste by no means so well as theology, ' that mistress of the world \u2014 that queen of the arts.' whose study he so warmly loved, and upon which he has lavished so many splendid panegyrics. Accord- it"], [270, "242 POSTSCRIPT IV. ingly, to a friend who had inquired how he liked his college life, \"he said, 'Thank God, I am well; but I should be much better were I not compelled to profess this philosophy.' The philosophy was that of Aristotle, that devil's master, as Luther afterwards called him, who wanted to build upon man instead of upon God. The senate of Wittemberg, on the recommen dation of Dr. Staupitz, named Luther ' town-preacher,' the bishop confirming the nomination. This was a new mission for Martin, and he trembled at its responsibility. He feared that he was unequal to the task, and related to Dr. Staupitz the terrors that beset him. ' You want to kill me, doctor,' cried Luther ; ' I shall be unable to bear the work for three months.' ' Well, my son,1 replied Staupitz, ' even if you die, it will be in God's service, and the sacrifice will be noble ! ' Luther yielded. He preached by turns in his monastery, in the Electoral chapel, and the collegiate church ; speedily showing how mistaken he had been in his estimate of his own powers. His success was remarkable ; \u2014 his voice was full, sonorous, and commanding ; \u2014 his gestures were dignified and emphatic. He had told Stau pitz that he would not slavishly follow his predecessors, and he kept his word. For the first time was seen the spectacle of a Christian orator forbearing to quote the dogmas of the schools, and deriving his imagery from the inspired writers. In every leisure moment he returned to his beloved theology, and espe cially he delighted to peruse the Epistles of St. Paul and the Discourses of Taulen. His hopes and wishes in no long period obtained their fulfilment : he was admitted a Bachelor in Theo logy, and could now, without resigning his professorship, read prelections on the sacred text. This daily labour admirably prepared him for the great struggle he was to maintain against the Papacy. Never in any German professional chair had there been heard expositions so luminous and profound as those of Luther. He nourished a passion for this kind of labour, and devoted whole nights to it. Often the most erudite savants would attend his course, and retire full of astonishment and admiration. The venerable Pollich, known by the sobriquet of 'Lux Mundi,' heard him, and moved with wonder, he exclaimed, ' This father has a keenness of insight which exceeds imagina tion ; he will harass the doctors before he has done, and create no trifling commotion.' \""], [271, "TETZEL THE DOMINICAN. 243 12. On the 16th of October, 1512, Luther was admitted Doctor of Divinity, and on the 17th received public investiture of the doctorate. He next set out on a mission entrusted to him by Staupitz, to inspect the convents of the provinces, and obtained such a knowledge of the vices of monastic life as whetted his indignation against the Roman system. The plague now broke out at Wittemberg, striking down its victims in every house. His friends betook themselves to flight, but Luther, like a loyal soldier, remained at his post, nor could any entreaties induce him to desert it. \" Fly ? No !\" he exclaimed, \" the world will not perish for a monk. 1 am at my post : duty bids me remain there until it shall be a duty for me to with draw. Not that I do not dread death ; I am no apostle Paul ; but the Lord will release me from the bondage of fear.\" 13. We now approach the period of Luther's career, distin guished by active, incessant, and successful hostility against the Church of Rome. It will be interesting to note how gradual was the Reformer's progress ; how he advanced from truth to truth, from improvement to improvement ; feeling his way and examining his ground at every step ; not like those rash and arrogant \" ideologists \" who frame a code of morals or a system of government at a sitting \u2014 from whose busy brains the Minerva always issues in armour and full-grown. The spark which fired the active intellect of Luther was struck from the brazen insolence of a Dominican monk, named Tetzel ; but the primary agent in the division of his own church was Leo X., one of the ablest and most magnificent of the Roman pontiffs. Many of his predecessors had been luxurious and ambitious, but their ambition had been exerted for the aggrandisement of their church. Leo X., like a true Medici, was ambitious for his family. He aimed at elevating his kinsmen to the rank of monarchs, and he himself played the role of the first king of Christendom. But the resources of the Roman See were inade quate to the accomplishment of such splendid projects ; and to provide himself with funds he trafficked largely in indulgences, \u25a0 \u2014 his mines of gold and silver being the credulity and super stition of mankind. He commissioned Tetzel, a monk of infa mous character, to work those mines, and to put up his indul gences for sale in Germany. These indulgences were, virtually, licenses to sin. There was no crime, however monstrous, which R 2"], [272, "244 POSTSCRIPT IV. Tetzel was not willing to remit \u2014 for money. He was not con tented with enumerating known sins ; he tasked his prurient imagination to invent the foulest and most infamous enormities, and when he saw his hearers aghast at each horrible idea, complacently repeated the burden of his song \u2014 \" Eh, well, all these are absolved as soon as your gold rings in the Pope's chest ! \" 14. Up to this momentous epoch Luther appears to have had no definite idea of the meaning and character of indul gences. When their shamelessness and profanity were dis played beneath his very eyes, it is no marvel, therefore, that h's soul glowed with indignation. A mere theological problem might not have awakened his zeal, but this was a question of morality and common sense. \" When I beheld,\" he says, \"this unholy and nefarious traffic taking place in open day, and thereby sanctioning the most monstrous crimes, I could not, though I was then but a young doctor of divinity, refrain from entering against it my most vehement protest, not only as directly contrary to the Scriptures, but as antagonistic to the very canons of the Church. Accordingly, in my place at Wittemberg \u2014 in which university, by the grace of God and the favour of the illustrious Elector of Saxony, I was honoured with the chair of Professor of Divinity \u2014 I determined to oppose the career of this shameless Tetzel, and to guard the people against the revival of this monstrous imposition on their credulity. When I carried my resolve into practice, instead of being abused and censured, as I have been by those worthless cheats and tyrants, the Pope and his mercenaries, I expected to re ceive the warmest encouragement and approval ; for I did little more than make use of the Pontiff's language as set forth in the Decretals, against the extortionate capacity of the collectors. I warned my hearers against the snares which were laid for them, pointing out that this was a scheme altogether contrary to religion, and only intended to replenish the treasury of those abandoned men. It was on the festival of All-Hallow's Eve that I first drew their attention to the gross errors relating to in dulgences, and about the same time I wrote two letters, one to the most reverend prelate Jerome, Bishop of Brandenberg, within whose jurisdiction Tetzel and his associates were car rying on their traffic ; the other to the most reverend prelate"], [273, "245 A WAR OF WORDS. and prince, Albert, Archbishop of Magdeburg \u2014 pointing out to them the consequences of their imposition, and beseeching them to enjoin silence upon Tetzel. . . To this letter,\" continues Luther, \"I received no answer, and indeed, at the time I was not aware that the Archbishop had arranged with the Pope to receive one half of the money levied by these indulgences, and to remit the other half to Rome.\" Perceiving that his remon strances were utterly disregarded, Luther adopted more active measures, and on the Feast of All Saints, October 31, 1517, read in the great church of Wittemberg a series of propositions against these indulgences, in which, while demonstrating their inefficiency and worthlessness. he expressed himself prepared on all occasions to submit to the Word of God and the decisions of the Church. 15. Some copies of these propositions found their way to Tetzel, and excited in him the utmost indignation and alarm. To ward off the blow, he published a series of one hundred and six counter resolutions, in which he asserted the absolute infal libility of the Pope, and branded Luther and his friends as heretics and heresiarchs. He also burnt Luther's themes pub licly in the city of Frankfort. The inhabitants of Wittemberg retaliated by burning Tetzel's productions in the great square, and thus begen the great revolution which ended in the estab lishment of Protestantism. Numerous sleuth-hounds joined in the chase which Tetzel had started. John Eck, Silvestro Prierio, and Hoogenstraaten poured out upon Luther the most lavish and insolent calumny. Thus they provoked the evil which they attempted to avert. For Luther at first seemed disposed to regret that he had moved in a matter which had excited such unexpected opposition. But Tetzel and his colleagues so exas perated the Reformer's temper, that he contented himself no longer with defending the propositions he had advanced. He carried the war into his opponents' quarters. Rumours of the controversy which agitated Germany reached Rome, but only provoked from Leo X. the remark that it was simply the off spring of the rivalry which separated the Augustans and the Dominicans. \" Monkish jealousies,\" said the pontiff, \" nothing more ; Fra Luther is a man of fine genius.\" 16. To the Pope, as Supreme Head of the Church, Fra Luther now addressed himself (30th May, 1518), and Leo in return"], [274, "246 POSTSCRIPT IV. privately advised Dr. Stanpitz to attempt the reclamation of the heresiarch by conciliatory means. These exercising no beneficial influence, the Master of the Ceremonies to the sacred palace wrote a defence of Tetzel, at the instigation of the Pope, which drew from Luther a reply that completely annihilated the sophist. The Roman authorities were now aroused, and Luther received orders to appear at Rome within sixty days. His only hope in this extremity was in the protection of the Elector of Saxony, who, whether from the interest he felt in the University of Wittemberg, or a personal regard for Luther, had always distinguished him with special favour. The elector, moreover, had himself declared that he had acknowledged no other rule of faith than that which the Scripture afforded. He was well fitted by character and temperament to take a prominent share in working out a great reform, but not, like Luther, to commence the initial movements. But it is to his honour that he frankly embraced, warmly supported, and sincerely loved, the Reforma tion which the Wittemberg professor inaugurated. 17. The elector took immediate steps for his protection, and his influence procured the concession that Luther should undergo examination by a legate, in the free town of Augsburg, where he himself was then residing, and with whose magistrates he had doubtlessly concerted measures for the Reformer's security. But of this Luther was not aware, and it was in simple faith, and with the courage born of faith, that he proceeded to his scene of trial. He quitted Wittemberg at dawn of day, jour neying a-foot, without a kreutzer in his pocket, and dressed in a worn-out gown. At the gates a throng of priests and laymen, the wealthy and the poor, awaited him to bid him God-speed. When he appeared, they cried, \" Luther for ever !\" \" Christ for ever, and His Word!\" replied Martin. Some of the crowd drew nearer, and exclaimed, \" Courage, master, and God help you ! \" Others accompanied him for many miles on his way, and then bade him farewell with a warm embrace : \u2014 \" In mantis tuas, Domine, commendo animam meam,\" said Luther, as their loving faces gradually vanished from his gaze. In due time he arrived at Augsburg, weary, way-worn, and with an ailing stomach, and one of his first occupations was to address his friend, Philip Melancthon, then a professor at Tubingen, and afterwards his fellow-helper at Wittemberg : \u2014 \" I know of nothing novel or"], [275, "247 LUTHER AT AUGSBURG. remarkable here, at present, save that I am the theme of con versation throughout the city, and that my name is in every man's mouth.

Farewell, beloved Melanc thon, and avert from us the wrath of God by your faithful prayers !\" 18. A narrative of Luther's proceedings at Augsburg we subjoin in his own words : \u2014 \" In the year 1518, the 9th of October, being cited to Augs burg, I duly appeared there. The Prince Frederick, Elector of Saxony, gave me a strong escort and a safe-conduct, and recom mended me to the authorities of the city, who were very attentive, and advised me by no means to converse with the Italians, nor to place any confidence in them. For I knew not, they said, what villains they were. For three entire days I remained in Augsburg without the imperial safe-conduct. Mean while an Italian (Urban di Serra Longa) came to me, invited me to go before the cardinal, and earnestly besought me to recant. I need utter, he said, but one word before the Car dinal Revoco, and then the cardinal would favourably commend me to the Pope, so that, with honour, and in security, I might return to my master, the Prince Elector. He instanced several examples, and amongst others that of the famous Joachim de Flores, who had submitted, and was consequently no heretic, though he had put forward heretical doctrines. When he urged me to delay no longer in waiting upon the cardinal, I replied,"], [276, "248 POSTSCRIPT IV. that certain excellent personages to whom I had been recom mended by the Elector Frederick had advised me first to obtain the imperial safe-conduct. Thereupon he exclaimed, with much warmth \u2014 ' What ! think you that the elector would take up arms on your account?' 'I should be loth,' replied I, ' to be the occasion of such an extremity.' ' But if you had the Pope and cardinals in your power,' returned he, ' what would you do with them ?' 'I would show them all honour and courtesy,' was my answer. He paused, snapped his fingers after the Italian fashion, and cried, ' Hem !' with which he departed, and I saw him no more. \" At the expiration of three days arrived the Bishop of Trent, who, in the emperor's name, showed and declared to the cardinal my safe-conduct. Then I went into the legate's presence in all humility, fell down first upon my knees, and next, prostrate upon the ground, remaining at his feet until he had three times bidden me rise, whereupon I stood up. This gave him pleasure, for he hoped from my submissiveness that I should consider, and think better of what I said. \" The next day, when I again appeared before him, and refused to retract anything, he said to me \u2014 ' What ! thinkest thou the Pope cares much for Germany ? His little finger is more powerful than all German}7. Or dost thou imagine that the princes will take up arms, and raise armies to defend thee ? Nay, indeed, not so; and where then wilt thou remain in safety ?' I replied, ' Under Heaven.' \" After these proceedings, tbe Pope lowered his tone, and wrote to our church, to the elector's chaplain, and to one of his councillors, Pfeffinger, that they should surrender me into his hands, and see that his commands were obeved. And the Pope also wrote to the elector as follows : \u2014 \" 'Although thou art unknown to me in person, yet thy father Ernest I have seen at Rome, who was in all things an obedient son to the Church, visiting aud attending our religious rites with zealous devoutness, and holding the same in the highest honour. I would that thy illustrious Serenity would tread in his footsteps, &c.' \" But the elector noted the unwonted humility of the pontiff, and his malignant intentions. He was also acquainted with the power and operation of the Holy Scriptures. Therefore he"], [277, "RETIRES TO WITTEMBERG. 249 remained where he was, and simply returned thanks to the Pope for his affection towards him. \" My books and propositions speedily made their way, or rather flew, throughout Europe, and the elector grew so strengthened in his belief that he utterly refused to fulfil the Pope's commands, and gave himself up to a full observance of the Scriptures. \" If the cardinal had more discreetly treated me at Augsburg, and had received me when I threw myself at his feet, matters would never have gone so far, inasmuch as at that time I saw but few of the Pope's errors which now I see, and had he been silent, so should I, too, have held my peace. At that time it was the style and manner of the Romish court, in dark and intricate cases, for the Pope to say \u2014 We, by virtue of our Papal power, do take these causes unto us : we annul them and destroy them; and the parties had no other resource but to sit down aud weep. \" I am persuaded that the Pope would willingly give three cardinals to reinstate the affair in the position which it occupied before he began to deal with me.\" 19. When it was perceived that between Luther and the Pope a reconciliation was impossible, his friends, apprehensive for his safety, persuaded him to leave Augsburg and retire to Wittemberg. From thence he addressed a report of his pro ceedings to the elector, and entreated his continued protection \u2014 a necessary step, since the Papal court was using every exer tion to get their dangerous opponents into their hands. Openly repudiating the Pope, Luther appealed to the next council. The Pope, he said, was fallible, as St. Peter himself had been fallible, and he therefore appealed to a general council, as superior to the Pope. Meanwhile the Romish court had com missioned Von Miltitz, a Saxon nobleman, to offer the elector the consecrated Golden Rose \u2014 seldom bestowed but upon emperors and kings \u2014 if he would surrender Luther. But Frederick courteously replied that, with the deepest reverence for the Pope, he should yet prefer the examination of his recusant subject to be taken by more impartial judges. In January, 1519, the Emperor Maximilian died, and, during the interregnum which ensued, Frederick acted as imperial regent. Secure in the favour of a prince so powerful, Luther proceeded with the in-"], [278, "250 POSTSCRIPT IV. vestigations which Rome had already found so distasteful. \" I am at work,\" he wrote to his friend Spalatin, \" on the Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians. I have in contemplation a sermon on the Passion. Besides my ordinary lessons, I teach a number of children every evening, and explain to them the Lord's Prayer. In the intervals I am examining the Decretals, wherein I find Christ so altered and crucified that I can scarcely make up my mind (let me whisper it in your ear), whether the Pope be Antichrist himself, or only the apostle of Anti christ.\" 20. While the breach was thus gradually widening, and the waters rising which threatened to engulph the Church of Rome, based though it was on the rock of St. Peter, one of his contro versial antagonists, John Eck, put forth a public challenge to Luther, to dispute with him at Leipzig. Thither the Reformer proceeded, accompanied by Carlstadt ; having first extorted from his parsimonious protector a new black surplice. Their procession is thus described by Seckendorf : \u2014 \" First went Carl stadt, alone in a chariot ; one of his wheels broke near St. Paul's church, and he was flung out \u2014 an accident which was deemed a bad omen for him. Next came the chariot of Barnim, Prince of Pomerania, at that time a student at Wittemberg, with the title of honorary rector. By his side sat Luther and Melancthon, and around and in the rear followed a large body of students. armed.\" What avails argument against authority ? A hun dred lances are infinitely more potent than the syllogisms of Aristotle ; and Eck, to the satisfaction of himself and the Papal doctors \u2014 though, as it has proved, not to the satisfaction of pos terity \u2014 utterly confuted and annihilated the great Heresiarch. Elated with his supposed victory he set out for Rome (a.d. 1520), to solicit Luther's condemnation, who accordingly was judged and sentenced without being heard. Forty-one of his propositions were specially indicated as \" heretical, scandalous, and damnable,\" and all his writings were condemned to the flames. Sixty-one days were allowed to him and his followers to abandon their errors, and by returning to the bosom of the Church, to save themselves from the penalties of excommunica tion in this world, and damnation hereafter. 21. Luther's spirit rose with every fresh attack, as the bough springs the higher the more strenuously you seek to bend it to the"], [279, "COURAGE MEANS SUCCESS. 251 earth. He now stood forward to judge his judge, to condemn the authority which had condemned him, and issued his indictment against the Papacy in a book which Michelet rightly charac terises as \" terrible.\" It was entitled \" On the Captivity of Babylon,\" and set forth that the Church was held in bonds, and that the Saviour, constantly profaned in the idolatry of the Mass, and contemptuously disregarded in the dogma of transubstantia tion, was the Pope's Prisoner. The bull of condemnation arrived from Rome to stimulate the daring Reformer to further efforts. He immediately issued a pamphlet, \" Against the execrable Bull of Antichrist.\" He also preached against it, and, on the 10th of December, 1520, publicly burnt the Papal anathema at the gates of the town, amid the enthusiastic and exultant cheers of the people. At the same time he gave to the flames the Book of Decretals, saying, \" Thou hast afflicted the holy of the Lord ; may eternal fire afflict thee and consume thee.\" What most astounded the public mind in these proceedings was their openness. Here was no trembling, shrinking doubter, nursing his heretical opinions in secret, and shunning the light of day ; but a monk boldly bearding the Supreme Head of the Church, denying his infallibility, and declaring himself his judge. Yet Luther did not thus separate himself from the memories of his past, and the feelings and sympathies of his early years, without an emotional struggle. It is no easy matter to shatter iu the dust all the associations of home, childhood, and manhood ; to surrender the traditions that have become a part of one's living faith ; and to build upon the ruins a new superstructure, which no sweet and tender remem brances at first can sanctify. Luther believed, indeed, that he was teaching the Bible, but it was not the Bible as his fathers had known and reverenced it. He believed he was stripping the veil from many a hideous delusion, but those delu sions were venerable with age, and the moonlight of superstition had long silvered them with a holy radiance. He could not but feel a shock at his heart, as, at each step he took, he trod into the earth some one of the fancies and old beliefs that had flowered about his youthful path. And this we should remember when attempting to form a just estimate of the Reformer's cha racter. \" I feel more and more every day,\" he wrote to his fellow monks at Wittemberg, \" I feel more and more every day"], [280, "252 POSTSCRIPT IV. how hard it is to lay aside the scruples which one has so long fostered within one. Ah, how much pain it cost me, though the Scripture was on my side, to justify it to myself that I should dare to resist by myself the Pope, and point him out as Anti christ ! What have the sorrows of my heart not been ? How many times have I not bitterly asked myself the very question which the Papists put to me \u2014 Art thou alone wise f Can every body else be in error ? Can so many generations have been mistaken ? How will it be if, after all, it is thou who art in the wrong, and art thus involving in thine own errors so many souls, who will then be eternally damned.\" On the one side, as he wrote to Erasmus, stood the shadows of centuries, the memories of martyrs, the influence of schools, and councils, and pontiffs \u2014 genius, and rank, and learning \u2014 wealth, wisdom, sanctity, and power. On the other, only Wickliffe, and Lorenzo Valla, and Luther \u2014 \" a poor creature, a man of yesterday, and supported but by a few friends; and with nothing to equal the erudition, genius, numbers, grandeur, or holiness of the other party ; and as to miracles, with not enough to cure a lame horse.\" But it was Luther's earnest conviction that he was preaching the Truth which nerved him against the temptations that beset him without and within. He spoke, because he could not be silent; because the impulse of his heroic soul forced him onward into the battle. 22. The circumstances of the time were eminently favourable to the success of Luther's mission. The discovery of printing had aroused the intellectual faculties of men, while it furnished the means of supplying them with sufficient nutriment. The printers became the most powerful and enthusiastic of Luther's supporters. Often they printed his books at their own cost, and always with a loving care. Vast numbers of copies were struck off, and rapidly distributed throughout Germany by those heretical monks who had thrown aside their cowls and returned to the world to promulgate the doctrines of the reformed religion. The fire was latent in the earth, and as the vivifying flame passed quickly from one point to another, it burst forth in all its brilliancy, lighting up the civilised world with the reflection of its radiance. The nobles and the peasants, the castles and the free towns, feudalism and commerce, rivalled each other in enthusiasm for Luther. At Marenburg, at Stras-"], [281, "PROGRESS. 253 burg, even at Mayence, there prevailed a constant struggle for his smallest pamphlets. The sheet, while yet wet from the press, passed from eager hand to hand. The literary guilds then flourishing in Germany, tinmen and shoemakers, braziers and tailors, greedily devoured the good tidings proclaimed by the Reformer. Hans Sach, the shoemaker poet, celebrated in his most melodious strains the \" Nightingale of Wittemberg,\" and the song, as it was caught up all over the land, swelled into the trumpet-tones of a victorious p\u00e6an. The German nobles were foremost in this new communion of thought and sentiment. They supported him with money, they promised him active aid against all assailants. \" I see very clearly,\" wrote Ulrich Von Hutten, \" that we must come to swords, bows, armour, and cannon. Do thou, my father, fortify thy courage, and despise these wild beasts. I see each day the number of thy adherents augment ; thou wilt be in no want of defenders.\" The friends of Luther were even present in the Diet at Worms, and in one of the sittings a paper was openly produced which set forth that four hundred nobles had sworn to defend him, and he who read it cried aloud \u2014 \"Buntschuh, Buntschuh!\" the rallying cry of the insurgent peasantry. 23. Of the memorable Diet of Worms we have already spoken (pp. 186-197). It is enough here to state that this great ecclesiastical and secular council sat for several days, but neither menaces nor entreaties could induce Luther to disavow or re tract the doctrines he had published. He remained inflexible in devout adherence to the truth, though fully aware of the extent of the dangers his courage was incurring. On the 26th of April, by order of the emperor, he set out for Wittemberg, having pledged himself to excite no disorders on his way, by preaching or otherwise. But the Elector of Saxony was aware of the peril in which the Reformer was placed. An imperial edict, published on the 25th of May, prohibited all persons, under penalty of high treason, from affording to Luther any assistance or asylum whatever, and enjoined the loyal and faithful to watch for and seize him, and place him in safe custody until justice should have decided his fate. To save his life the elector caused him to be arrested when on his way to Alter hausen, and provided for him a secure asylum in the castle of Wartburg ; where he might pursue his studies in peace, while"], [282, "254 POSTSCRIPT IV. Europe was agitated with the whirlwind of his bold and novel doctrines. In his seclusion he was treated with the utmost con sideration. His table was plentifully served with game, and the generous Rhine wine, of which he was always reasonably fond. His guards were courteous and attentive, aud at times the chatelain would send secretly for some of Luther's friends, the nearest at hand, who repaired to Wartburg at night, and rising early in the morning, gathered round the monk in one of the castle halls, and heard him expound the Scriptures, returning to their homes at night-fall. But his prison life was not without its shadows. Solitude was unfitted for his active imagination and restless intellect, and the mental sufferings which had darkened his early years again recurred, to his torture and temptation. \" I dwelt far apart from the world in my chamber,\" writes Luther, \" and no one could come to me but two youths, sons of noblemen, who waited on me with my meals twice a day. Among other things, they had brought me a bag of nuts, which I had put in a chest in my sitting-room. One evening, after I had retired to my chamber, which adjoined the sitting-room, had put out the light and got into bed, it seemed to me all at once that the nuts had put themselves in motion, and jumping about in the sack, and knocking violently against each other, came to the side of my bed to make noises at me. However, this did not alarm me, and I went to sleep. By-and-by 1 was wakened up by a great noise on the stairs, which sounded as though somebody was tumbling down them a hundred barrels one after another. Yet I knew very well that the door at the bottom of the stairs was fastened with chains, and that the door itself was of iron, so that no one could enter. I rose immediately to see what it was, exclaiming \u2014 ' Is it thou [Satan] ? Well, be it so ! ' And I recommended myself to our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom it is written, ' Thou hast put all things under his feet,' Psalm viii. ; and I returned to bed.\" After awhile his strong mind shook off these wild delusions, and he addressed himself to the vigorous prosecution of the great work he had greatly begun, by trans lating the Bible into German, and by giving to the press a host of theological treatises and controversial pamphlets. Nor did the seclusion to which he was condemned narrow his views, or induce him to rest content with the progress he had already achieved. It was while in captivity at Wartburg that he came"], [283, "ICONOCLASTS. 255 to a definite resolve on the question of monastic vows, concluding that celibacy was not enjoined by Scipture, but an invention of Antichrist. In this, as in other respects, however, he fol lowed the public sentiment, rather than guided it, and so it usually happens that the roll and rush of a great revolution will rapidly outstrip or bear along with it the adventurous hand which first loosened the waters from their pent-up source. 24. In the matter of image breaking, indeed, the followers of Luther went far ahead of their illustrious master, and now carried their zeal to such a height as to arouse his indignation. Amongst those iconoclasts who most distinguished themselves bytheir fana ticism was Luther's old master in theology, Andrew Bodenstein, or Carlstadt, in whose eyes the marble sculpture or the glowing canvas was but a snare of Satan, to be utterly destroyed lest it should pervert unthinking souls. This man organised a faction which broke into the churches of Wittemberg, and commenced breaking and destroying the statues, the pictures, the images of saints, exclaiming, \" Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, nor the likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters under the earth.\" The windows rich in glorious dyes, and the missal blazoned with splendid colours, were also involved in the com mon ruin. In vain Luther remonstrated against these follies : the thunder from Wartburg was scarcely heard at Wittemberg, and the bigot, unable to comprehend the Reformer's moderation, was ready to believe that he was no true servant of Christ. Luther, however, though not an iconoclast, was no image worshipper ; but he wished to accomplish his ends by peaceful means. \" I condemn only by the Word,\" he wrote ; \" let him who believes, believe and follow me ; let him who believes not, believe not and go his own way in peace. No one must be compelled to the faith or to the things of the faith against his will; he must be prevailed upon by faith alone. I also con demn images, but I would have them assailed by the Word, and not by blows and fire ; I would deal with them so that the people should no longer have the faith in them which they have heretofore had ; to accomplish this great object, must be the work of the Word, and not of violence. Be assured the images will fall of themselves when the people, growing enlightened, shall know that they are as nothing in the eyes of God : it is"], [284, "256 POSTSCRIPT IV. thus that I would efface from men's consciences, by the sole influence of the Word, all these devices of the Pope, as in confession, communion, prayer and fasting.\" Perceiving that his letters were of no avail, and keenly sensible of the obstacles which Carlstadt's excesses must throw in the way of sincere reformers, Luther, without asking the elector's consent, quitted Wartburg, in March, 1522, and returned to Wittemberg. The influence of his presence was immediately felt, and the iconoclasts were compelled to retire in great confusion. 25. The Reformer seems to have thought that these excesses were permitted by God as a punishment upon him for his mode ration at Worms, and with renewed vigour returned to his attacks upon the Church of Rome and its principal supporters. To those princes and ecclesiastical dignitaries who had pro hibited the sale of his translation of the Bible, he threatened civil war. \" Why will they not perceive,\" he said, \" that the sword of civil war is suspended over their heads ? They are using every effort to destroy Luther, while Luther is doing his utmost to preserve them. It is not for Luther, but for them, that ruin approaches ; and they, instead of seeking to avert, promote it. In what I am now saying, I verily believe the Spirit speaks by my lips. But if the decree of wrath is passed in Heaven, and neither prayer nor prudence can ward off its results, we will obtain that our Josias shall fall asleep in peace, and that the world shall be left to itself in its Babylon.\" 26. In the middle of the year Europe was astonished by the appearance of a royal polemic, Henry VIII., who came forward as the champion of the Roman Church in a book written by his chaplain, Edward Lee, but bearing the king's name. Luther grappled with delight with his new opponent, and so bemauled and belaboured him as to excite the dis pleasure of many of his own adherents. \" If a king of England,\" he wrote, \" spits his impudent lies in my face, I have a right, in my turn, to fling them back down his very throat. If he blasphemes my holy doctrines ; if he hurls his filth at the throne of my Monarch, my Christ ; he need not be astonished at my similarly defying his royal diadem, King of England though he be, and liar and rascal.\" He assailed the Pope with equal vehemence : \u2014 \" My little Paul,\" he would write, \" my little pope, my little donkey, take care how you go \u2014 it's very"], [285, "LUTHER'S CHURCH ORGANISATION. 257 slippery ! If you do not heed, you'll fall and break a leg or so ; and then the folks will say, ' What the devil's this ? Why, the poor popelet has hurt himself! ' \" 27. After his return to Wittemberg, Luther commenced the organisation of the church which he had founded, and laboured at the task with the holiest energy and most determined zeal. It was to him that all the enemies of Rome addressed them selves \u2014 princes, electors, citizens \u2014 Bohemians, Italians, Swiss, \u2014 and numerous were the dependants on his generous bounty, as well as the pupils who solicited from him the solution of some theological difficulty. It was now that, continuing in his progressive path, he attacked confession, the doctrine of pur gatory, the worship of saints, and other relics of the Romish superstition. But it was with vital principles and great ques tions that he mainly concerned himself, leaving ceremonial usages for the criticism of a later age. \" With respect to the elevation of the Host,\" he wrote to Spalatin, \"' do as you think fit. I would not have people fettered by arbitrary rules in trivial matters. This is what I have always said, and what I shall always say to those who fatigue me about this question.\" Gradually he completed the organisation of the New Church, giving the first place to the preacher or minister, the second to the deacon, the third to the bishop or overlooker, and the next to the dispenser. He also arranged the services which should be performed, taking good heed that they should be mainly in the German tongue ; and he provided for a frequent visitation of the churches in Saxony, that the ceremonies in each might be brought to a tolerable approximation, though not to a mono tonous uniformity. 28. All the Augustines of Wittemberg having one after the other quitted the convent, the prior resigned the building into the hands of the elector, and Luther himself at length abandoned the monastic robe. On the 19th of October he appeared in a surplice provided by the elector, similar to that which is still worn by the German pastors. Encouraged by his example, an exodus of monks and nuns took place, who on emerging from the stillness of monastic life into the tumult of the active world, felt as embarrassed as a native of the wilderness and the desert when for the first time thrown upon the turmoil of a great city. They naturally turned for advice and assistance to s"], [286, "258 POSTSCRIPT IV. the man whose burning words had induced them to abandon their old traditional belief, and thus increased the responsibilities with which he was already charged. \" I implore you,\" he writes to Spalatin, \" to come and help me : I am so bowed beneath the weight of other people's affairs that it makes my life a burden to me ; I am head over ears in business \u2014 visitor, reader, preacher, author, auditor, actor, runner, debater, and what not.\" The path of the Reformer never runs smooth ; on every side gather the danger and the sorrow ; and the open enemy is not half so great an obstacle as the zealous follower who is not content with a slow and certain progress, but in his haste travels beyond the limits of reason and moderation. Such a man was Carlstadt, who now proved a thorn in Luther's side of exceeding bitterness. But the great Reformer girded up his loins to do battle for the Truth, and after a severe polemical contest, forced his rash antagonist to solicit his favour and in dulgence for his misdeeds. The Insurrection of the Peasants was another of the difficulties with which Luther had to con tend. Religious freedom necessarily awakened in the minds of the oppressed a desire for civil freedom, which soon ripened into a fierce crusade against order, against property, against knowledge ; a wild and fantastic religious mysticism combining with the most extravagant democratical theories. Luther's enemies eagerly seized this opportunity of discrediting the new religion, and charged the revolt upon his teaching. The peasants declared themselves acting in his name, and appointed him the arbiter between themselves and their rulers. In this difficult position his courage did not fail. He accepted the dangerous task imposed upon him, and addressed both parties in language of the loftiest eloquence, inspired by the noblest sentiments. 29. It is useless to argue with men who grasp the ready sword. The insurgents rushed to arms. They were encouraged by a temporary success, but the Catholic princes soon brought their forces into the field, and pitilessly crushed out the revolt in blood (a.d. 1525). Meanwhile Luther's theological adver saries allowed him scant repose. They were none of them content to remain within the limits which he had prescribed. Some went farther, some receded nearer the bounds of the ancient Church, but all \u2014 Erasmus and Bucer, Zwinglius and \u0152co-"], [287, "LUTHER'S MARRIAGE. 259 lampadius \u2014 differing as they did from each other, united in their attacks upon Luther. In him, however, they met with a doughty opponent, who returned blow for blow, and poured out upon them the heavy artillery of his scorn. \" That fellow,\" he said of Erasmus, \" as his face manifestly proves, is full of trick and underhand malice \u2014 a very fox \u2014 a knave who has made mock both of God and religion. He employs, indeed, the most sonorous words : ' the dear Lord Christ, the Word of Salvation, the Holy Sacraments,' and so on, but as to the Truth, he cares not a straw for it. When he preaches, he rings falsely, like a cracked metal. He formerly assailed Popery, but now he is endeavouring to pull its head out of the mud.\" 30. The enmity and jealousy which surrounded the Reformer with a circle of fire induced him to turn to those home-joys for which he was eminently fitted by his natural temperament, and he married in 1525, a young woman of noble family, an escaped nun, twenty-two years old, and of handsome person, Catherine de Bora. With her he led a life of special happi ness, though tried by severe poverty and much physical suffer ing. To eke out his scanty income he applied himself to turning and gardening, but these resources were utterly inade quate to his wants, and he was constrained to rely for his daily food upon the parsimonious aid of the elector. But his charity, even in these pitiful circumstances, did not run dr}7, and none afflicted or distressed applied to him in vain. Towards the close of the year 1527 he was several times attacked with illness, both bodily and mental, \u2014 on one occasion being so nigh unto death that his friends despaired of his recovery. He was roused from bis depression by the urgent need of his activity and enthu siasm, to confront the perils which now loomed darkly over Germany and Protestantism. 31. The irruption of the Turks into Germany, and their siege of Vienna, recalled Luther to active life, and with his usual stirring trumpet-tones he summoned his countrymen to arms. He wrote a book against the Turks which he dedicated to the Landgrave of Hesse, and afterwards he inveighed bitterly against the supineness with which the rise of the Crescent over the German fatherland was regarded by many of the reformed pastors. \" I cannot hold my peace,\" he said. \" Unhappily, there are amongst us preachers who induce the people to be- S 2"], [288, "260 POSTSCRIPT IV. lieve that they need be under no apprehension respecting this' Turkish war.' On the other hand, there exist fanatics who declare that, under all circumstances, it is forbidden to Christians to have recourse to temporal weapons. Others, again, who regard the Germans as untameable brutes, go to the extreme of hoping they may be subjugated by the Mahometans.\" Happily, the menaced peril was escaped, and the Turks retreated in disorder from before the walls of Vienna (a.d. 1529). But the atmosphere was still surcharged with thunder, and the long-gathering clouds broke at last upon the heads of the devoted Protestants. The Turkish invasion had but deferred the storm. Between the Lutheran and the Catholic princes pre vailed a bitter hostility, aggravated by the supposed existence of a Catholic league which the former believed themselves to have discovered. The Lutherans by no means shrank from re course to arms. They were confident in their strength and enthusiasm. The Reformation had spread along the banks of the exulting Rhine, had crossed the snow-clad mountains of Switzerland, and rolled northward in the current of the Elbe, permeating those provinces now united under the crown of Prussia. The emperor was held in check by the menacing hosts of the Turks, which still hung like a boding cloud on the Austrian frontiers. Thus, the most powerful adversaries of the Lutherans were now represented by the Duke George of Saxony, and the bishops of the North, with whom the Elector of Saxony and the Landgrave of Hesse were not unwilling to measure swords. 32. The successful result of the defence of Vienna left the emperor at liberty to attend to the internal affairs of the em pire (a.d. 1529), and a Diet held at Spires on the 15th of March, decreed that the empire-states should continue to obey the edict promulgated against Luther in 1524, and that every kind of innovation should be forbidden until a general council bad been convoked. This arbitrary decision had the instant effect of placing the two great parties face to face. The Elector of Saxony, the Margrave of Brandenburg, the Landgrave of Hesse, the Duke of Luxemburg, the Prince of Anhalt, and together with them the deputies of fourteen imperial towns, signed in concert a solemn Protestation against the decree of the Diet, declaring it to be equally impious and unjust. Thence"], [289, "THEOLOGICAL CONTENTIONS. 261 arose the name of Protestants, which has ever since distinguished the members of the Reformed Church. 33. The attitude of the great German nation at this juncture has been described by Michelet in appropriate language : \u2014 \" This theological contest in Germany,\" he says, \" occupied the intervals of the formidable European war which Charles V. waged with Francis I. and the Turks. But during the most terrible phases of the latter, the former struggle knew little re laxation or abatement. It is a grand \u2014 it is a solemn spectacle which Germany offers, animated by a religious sentiment, and forgetting in this noble absorption the imminent peril in which her formidable enemies threatened to entangle her. While the Turks were pouring through the ancient barriers which had formerly protected her \u2014 while Soliman was even hurling his barbarous Tartars into the provinces beyond Vienna \u2014 Germany was involved in a theological question. The most famous of her warriors were seated in her diets to interrogate the learned. Such was the cool intrepidity of this great nation \u2014 such their reliance on their strength and numbers. The wars with Turkey and France, the capture of Rome, and the defence of Vienna, so far occupied Charles V. and Ferdinand, as to secure immu nity for the Protestants until the next council ; but in the year 1530, the emperor seeing France prostrate, Italy subdued, and Soliman driven back into his own kingdom, resolved to under take the decision of the important problem of the Reforma tion.\" 34. Thus originated the memorable Confession of Augsburg which we have already described, and which thenceforth ranged in battle array the two great camps of Catholics and Protes tants. It was immediately followed by an assemblage of the Protestant princes at Smalcalde (December 31, 1S30), where they entered into a defensive league, constituting themselves an united body. They declared against the appointment of Fer dinand as King of the Romans ; prepared openly for war ; fixed the contingent of armed men which each state was to furnish to the Protestant army ; and forwarded explanatory addresses to the sovereigns of France, Denmark, and England. The Smalcaldic League was the first movement of that famous war which ravaged Germany for thirty years, and in the course of its desolating career brought all Europe within the range of its"], [290, "262 POSTSCRIPT IV. influence, until the Treaty of Westphalia secured the rights and liberties of the Protestant states. 35. Meanwhile, ere yet the two great parties had broken out into open hostilities, arose the insurrection of the Anabaptists, headed by David and John of Leyden, and having for its focus the opulent and powerful city of Munster. The Refor mation had found its way hither in 1532, when its doctrines were first preached by Rothenarm, a Lutheran minister, and obtained a general acceptance. At a later period, a fanatical tailor, John of Leyden, whose mind was strongly imbued with the mysticism of the age, began to expound the theories of the Anabaptists, and succeeded in forming so many secret conclaves as to excite the alarm of both Lutherans and Catholics. The Anabaptists were then driven from the city, but soon returned, and with increased audacity. They drew from the surrounding towns and villages the members of their persuasion, and, re lying upon their numbers, broke out into an open insurrection, pillaging the churches and convents, and expelling all who were of different sects from the city. Their first \"supreme prophet\" was John Matthiesen, who, being slain in a skirmish with the Bishop of Munster's forces, was succeeded by John of Leyden, and he also married his predecessor's widow. This enthusiast was a singular compound of ability and madness, religious zeal and vicious excess. He established an arbitrary government in the city, declaring himself the predestined occupant of the throne of David ; nominated twelve dukes to assist him in the administration ; and gratified the passions of the lower orders by proclaiming the lawfulness of a plurality of wives. The greatest excesses were indulged in, rendered the more terrible by the prevalence of famine and disease, but the pseudo-prophet maintained his supremacy over his misguided followers, until the city was captured by assault on the Feast of St. John, 1535. The bishop caused John of Leyden to be executed on the 22nd of January, 1536, under circumstances of horrible barbarity. He was fastened to a stake, and two executioners alternately tore his flesh from his bones with red-hot pincers. At length one of them plunged a knife into his heart, and thus completed the execution, which had been prolonged for one hour. A similar fate attended his lieutenant . and vicar, and the Ana baptist insurrection was quelled in blood."], [291, "LATER YEARS. 263 36. This outbreak greatly disturbed the mind of Luther, who feared lest such occurrences should weaken the faith of many of the converts to the Reformed Church. He published a work in which he clearly proved that the doctrines of the Anabaptists were hostile to those which he and his followers professed, and that their excesses could not justly be charged upon the Refor mation. He showed that such outbreaks would best be pre vented by allowing the free promulgation of the truths of the Gospel. \" Our nobles,\" he wrote, \" our bishops, and princes, will not permit the Gospel to be preached, nor the souls of men to be saved by the agency of God's Word from ruin. They think, indeed, that it is enough to cut throats. In this way they rescue the bodies of men from the devil, and leave him in possession of their souls. They will enjoy the same measure of success as the Jews, who thought they were exterminating Christ when crucifying him The most powerful weapon against the devil is the sword of the Spirit, the Word of God. The devil is a fiend who laughs at cuirasses, and mocks at horsemen.\" 37. The later years of Luther's life were marked by few events of importance. It was his happiness to be spared to see the rapid growth of the Tree of Life which he had planted. More fortu nate than Moses he was permitted to lead his followers into the Promised Land, and though the swords and pikes of their enemies threatened to enclose them within a barrier of steel, he could not but see that the triumph was assured of the doctrines which he had so zealously taught. At the beginning of 1546 he removed from Wittemberg to Eisleben (January 28th), to effect, if he could, a reconciliation between the counts of Mans feldt. In this labour of love he succeeded, but on the 17th of February was so ill that the counts entreated him not to quit his house. On the same day, at supper, he spoke frequently about his approaching death, and to a friend who inquired whether we should recognise one another in the world of the future, he replied that he thought we should. On retiring to his chamber, accompanied by Maitre C\u0153lius and his two sons, he went to the window and remained there for a considerable time, engaged in silent prayer. Aurifaber arriving, he said to him, \" I feel very weak, and my pains are worse than ever.\" A soothing draught was administered, and they attempted by"], [292, "264 POSTSCRIPT IV. friction to accelerate the circulation. He then addressed a few words to Count Albert, who had joined him, and lying down on his bed, remarked, \" If I could sleep but for half an hour, I think I should feel much relieved.\" Slumber soon arrived, and the Reformer lay asleep for an hour and a half. He awoke about eleven o'clock, and looking around, exclaimed, \" What, my dear friends, are you still here ? Will you not go and re pose yourselves?\" On their replying that they would remain with him, he began to pray, saying with fervour \u2014 \" In nianus tuas commendo spiritum meum ; redemisti me, Domine, Deus veritatis.\" \" Pray, all of you,\" he continued, \" for the Gospel of our Lord ; pray that its reign may extend, for the Council of Trent and the Pope menace it round about.\" Then he fell asleep again for about an hour. When he awoke, Dr. Jonas asked him how he felt. \" Oh, my God,\" he replied, \" I feel very ill ! My dear Jonas, I think I shall remain here at Eisleben \u2014 here, where I was born.\" He rose, and walked across the room once or twice, and lying down again was covered with clothes and cushions to promote perspiration. Two physicians, with the count and his wife, entered the chamber. Luther said to them feebly, \" Friends, I am dying ; I shall remain with you here at Eisleben.\" Dr. Jonas expressing a hope that perspiration would take place, and afford relief \u2014 \" No, dear Jonas,\" he replied, \" I feel no wholesome perspiration, but a cold, dry sweat ; I grow worse every minute.\" He recommenced praying : \u2014 \" O my Father, Thou, the God of our Lord Jesns Christ; Thou, the source of all consolation ; I thank Thee that Thou hast revealed unto me Thy well-beloved Son, in whom I believe, whom I have preached, and confessed, and proclaimed ; whom I have loved and celebrated, and whom the Pope and the wicked persecute. I commend my soul to Thee, 0 my Lord Jesus Christ ! I am about to abandon this terrestrial body, to be removed from this mundane life, but I know that I shall eternally abide with Thee!\" He then repeated thrice \u2014 \"Li manus tuas commendo spiritum meum ; redemisti me, Domine, Deus veritatis I\" Suddenly his eyes closed, and he fell back in a swoon, from which he was with difficulty recovered. Dr. Jonas then said to him, \" Reverend Father, do you die stead fast in the faith that you have taught ?\" He opened his eyes, fixed upon the questioner an earnest gaze, and replied in a tone"], [293, "luther's character. 265 of unutterable meaning, \" Yes.\" He then fell asleep, and in a few minutes, breathing one deep sigh, surrendered his great spirit to God. The Reformer \u2014 the hero of the greatest religious revolution which the world has witnessed \u2014 was dead ! 38. Luther's remains were conveyed in a leaden coffin to Wittemberg, and interred there on the 22nd of February, with the highest honours. The funeral procession included his widow, his sons, several of the most eminent Reformers, and a throng of professors and doctors, counsellors, students, men, women and children, of every rank and age, all dissolved in tears. A funeral discourse was delivered by Melancthon. The grave in front of the pulpit, having been properly filled up and secured, a brass plate was affixed, which bore the follow ing inscription : \u2014 \" Martini Lutheri, S. Theologi\u00e6 Doctoris Corpus. H.L.T.E., qui anno Christi MDL VI., XII. Kal. Martii Eyslebii in patria, S.M.O.C.V. Ann. LXIII. M.II.D.X.\" When, some few years after this event, Wittemberg was cap tured by Charles V., the emperor visited the great Reformer's grave. With folded arms, he was reading the inscription, when one of his officers proposed to open the tomb, and throw the ashes of the heretic to the winds. The imperial brow reddened : \u2014 \" I war not with the dead ; let this place be respected.\" 39. Our brief narrative of Luther's career would be incom plete without some further particulars of his character and some glimpses of the tendencies of his intellect. Of his private life even his enemies have been constrained to speak with com mendation. He was, nevertheless, no severe ascetic, no rigid Puritan. He was fond of innocent pleasures, of music, of a game at skittles, of fireside chat, of a genial jest. \" Everybody must admit,\" says Melancthon, \" that he was an admirable man, bland and agreeable in his social hours, and never dogmatic, or addicted to disputes. To these traits must be added the gravity which was decorous in his position. If he displayed any harsh ness or obduracy in his strife with his numerous adversaries, it arose from no malignity in his nature, but from his fervent passion for the Truth.\" In eating and drinking he observed the utmost temperance, and would often fast for several hours. But his well-balanced mind shunned extremes, and though moderate in his usual diet, he did not object to a glass of gene rous Rhenish wine. His piety was eminently earnest. He"], [294, "266 POSTSCRIPT IV. dedicated several hours each day to the repetition of psalms, and to invocations to the Almighty, uttered with remarkable fervour and devotion. It was no formal and ritualistic piety, but the religion of a grateful heart. 40. From his Tischreden (Table Talk) we extract a few quotations illustrative of Luther's thoughts on many things. He inculcated the deepest reverence to women : \u2014 \" Woman,\" he said, \" is the most precious of creatures. She is full of grace and virtue; she maintains the faith. He who insults preachers of the Word and women, will never meet with much success. .... It is from women spring children \u2014 a continuity which keeps up families and the commonwealth. Whosoever despises them, despises both God and man It is no more possible to do without a wife, than to dispense with eating and drinking. Conceived, nourished, borne by women, our very being is, in a great measure, their being ; and it is utterly impossible for us to separate ourselves altogether from them.\" \" The utmost blessing that God can confer on man is the possession of a good and devout wife, with whom he may live in peace and tran quillity ; to whom he can entrust his entire possessions, even his life and welfare ; and who bears him children. Catherine, thou hast for thy husband a pious man who loves thee \u2014 thou art a very empress ! Thanks be unto God ! \" \" ' Serve the Lord in fear and rejoice in trembling.\" There is no contradiction involved in this text,\" said Luther ; \" at least, not for me. My little boy, John, acts exactly thus in reference to myself. But I cannot act thus towards God. If I am seated at table, and am writing or doing aught, John sings me a little song ; if he sings too loudly, and I chide him for it, be continues to sing, but with some fear, and, as it were, to himself. God wills that we also should be continually gay, but that our gaiety be moderated by fear and reserve.\" On Marriage. \u2014 \" The image of marriage is discoverable in all living creatures ; and not only in all animated creation, but also in trees and stones. Every one knows that trees, such for example, as the apple and the pear-tree,* stand mutually in sexual relations, and require mutual intercourse in order to be fruitful, only prospering when they are planted in contiguity to * Luther's statement is erroneous. The date and palm require external aid, but the apple, pear, plum, &c., bear flowers which spontaneously fructify."], [295, "LUTHER'S TABLE TALK. 267 one another. The same observation applies also to stones, more particularly the precious stones, corals, emeralds, and others. The sky is likewise the spouse of earth, vivifying it by the beams of the sun, and thus enabling it to bring forth all kinds of plants and fruit.\" On Doubts and Fears. \u2014 \" Children, after all, are the happiest. We older fools constantly torment ourselves, and bring affliction on us by our eternal disputes about the Word. Is it true ? \u2014 Is it possible ? \u2014 How is it possible ? \u2014 are our constant inquiries. Whereas children, in the purity and simplicity of their faith, possess a certainty, and doubt of nothing wherein their salvation is concerned. In order to be saved, we should imitate their example, and cling to the Word of God alone. But the devil, to hinder us from so doing, is perpetually throwing obstacles in our path. This is the reason why it is better to die without doubt or question, and pass quickly away from earth.\" On the Beauty of Nature. \u2014 \" Glory to God, who, from the dead creation, thus raises up life again in the spring-time ! Behold these branches, how strong, how beautiful they are ! Already they teem and are pregnant with the fruit which they will bring forth. They offer a beautiful image of the resurrec tion of all men. The winter season represents death ; the summer-tide, the resurrection. Then all things live again, all bloom with verdure How lovely is this weather ! Thou hast granted to us, 0 Lord, this bounty \u2014 to us who slight Thee with so much ingratitude, to us whose hearts are so full of wickedness and avarice. But Thou art a God of goodness ! This is no work of the evil one ; no, it is a bounteous thunder which shakes the earth and awakens it, cleaving it, so that its fruits may issue forth and diffuse a fragrance like that which proceeds from the prayer of a pious Christian.\" On Faith. \u2014 Seeing a bird preparing to roost among the foliage of a tree, Luther exclaimed \u2014 \" That little bird has chosen its shelter, and is about to fall asleep in peace. It has no disquietude, neither does it take heed where it shall rest to morrow night, but tranquilly rocks upon that fragile branch, leaving it to God the Father to make provision for it.\" On the Harvest.. \u2014 \" 0 God of all goodness, Thou hast bestowed upon us a year of abundance. But not because of our piety, 0 Lord, but in order to glorify Thy holy name."], [296, "268 POSTSCRIPT IV. Cause us, 0 Lord, to amend our lives, and to grow in faith, and in the belief of Thy holy Word. All in and around Thee are miracles. Thy voice causes to spring from the earth, and from the sand of the desert, these beautiful plants, these green blades, which so delight the eye. 0 Father, give unto all Thy children their daily bread.\" On John Huss. \u2014 \" John Agricola was one day reading a certain publication written by John Huss, full of spirit, but in stinct with resignation as well as warmth, wherein he showed how in his own person he endured martyrdom from the stone, and at the same time saw himself rejected by the Emperor Sigismund. Doctor Luther expressed his admiration of his spirit and heroism, exclaiming, ' They wrong us greatly who term John Huss and myself heretics.' \" \"Huss died, not as an Anabaptist but as a Christian. He offers an example of Christian frailty, but at the same time there was awakened in his soul a power as from God which supported him. The strife between the flesh and the spirit, between Christ and Huss, is beautiful to behold. Constance is now a poor wretched city. I believe that God has thus punished it. John Huss was burned, and I believe that I shall also be slain, if God wills it. Huss weeded from out of Christ's vineyard a few thorns, in assailing only the shameful doings of the Papists. Whereas I, Doctor Martin Luther, found myself upon a well-tilled and already black mould. I attacked the doctrines of the Pope, and overthrew them.\" On Music. \u2014 \" Music is one of the most splendid and delight ful boons that God has given us. Satan is its inveterate enemy, for he knows that through its aid men drive away temptations and evil thoughts : he cannot prevail against music.\" \" If our God grants us so noble a gift in this present life, which is only a life of miserable trials, what will it not be in the life eternal ! \" On the death of his daughter, Magdalene (\u00e6tat. 14, a.d. 1452). \u25a0 \u2014 \" When she was in her last agony, Luther fell on his knees at the bedside, and weeping bitterly, besought the Lord to save her life. Shortly afterwards she expired, going to sleep gently in her father's arms. Her mother stood at the other side of the same room, utterly prostrate with affliction. The Doctor repeated from time to time, ' God's will be done ! My daughter"], [297, "luther's character. 269 has still a Father in heaven ! ' Master Philip Melancthon said, ' The love of parents for their children is an image of the Divinity imprinted on the heart of man. God no less loves the human race than parents their children.' When they put her into the coffin, Luther said, \" Poor, dear, little Magdalene, there thou art \u2014 peace be with thee!' Then, as he looked upon her, he said, ' Dear child, thou wilt rise again ; thou wilt shine like a star \u2014 ay, like the sun ! . . . I am joyful in spirit, but oh, how sad in the flesh ! 'Tis marvellous I should know she is certainly at rest, that she is well, and yet that I should be so sad. ' \" Such were the sentiments, mostly wise and liberal, of Martin Luther. This Tischreden \u2014 this Table Talk of his \u2014 presents, as Carlyle says, \" many beautiful unconscious displays of the man, and what sort of nature he had. His behaviour at the death bed of his little daughter, so still, so great and loving, is among the most affecting things. He is resigned that his little Mag dalene should die, yet longs inexpressibly that she might live ; \u2014 follows, in. awestruck thought, the flight of her little soul through those unknown realms. Awestruck \u2014 most heartfelt, we can see ; and sincere \u2014 for after all dogmatic creeds and articles, he feels what nothing it is we know, or can know. His little Magdalene shall be with God, as God wills ; for Luther, too, that is all ; Islam is all.\" 41. \" Luther's face,\" continues Carlyle, \" is to me expressive of him ; in Kranach's best portraits I find the true Luther. A rude, plebeian face ; with its huge crag -like brows and bones, tbe emblem of rugged energy; at first, almost a repulsive face. Yet in the eyes especially there is a wild, silent sorrow ; an unnameable melancholy, the element of all gentle and fine affections ; giving to the rest the true stamp of nobleness. Laughter -was in this Luther, as we said ; but tears also were there. Tears were also appointed him ; tears and hard toil. The basis of his life was Sadness, Earnestness. In his latter days, after all triumphs and victories, he expresses himself heartily weary of living ; he considers that God alone can and will regulate the course things are taking, and that perhaps the day of judgment is not far. As for him, he longs for one thing : that God would release from his labour, and let him depart and be at rest.

History does not present many examples of the voluntary surrender by great men of their power or position, and so few are the sovereigns who have abdicated their thrones that the weakest memory can retain their names without difficulty. Of these the name which most frequently suggests itself to the historical student, from the important consequences of the event with which it is associated, and the singular circumstances attending that event, is that of Charles V., Emperor of Germany, and King of Spain and the Indies. To the superficial inquirer it would seem that he chose for the time of his abdication the hour of his greatest prosperity, and his example has been quoted as a bril liant illustration of the calmness with which a truly great mind divests itself of the trappings of state and the privileges of rank. His authority was acknowledged by Germany, Flanders,"], [301, "CHARACTER OF CHARLES V. 273 Spain, Austria, Naples, and Sicily ; the golden realms of Mexico obeyed his imperial sceptre. His persistent antagonist, Maurice of Saxony, was dead ; the throne of France was no longer occupied by the brilliant and able Francis ; and he had sur vived the two enemies whose indefatigable valour had prevented him from realising his ambitious project of a new Christian or Catholic empire \u2014 from reproducing the conception of the illus trious Charlemagne. But a little closer examination will show the hollowness of the base crowned by the imperial column. His efforts to extirpate the heresy of Luther had utterly failed, and he had been compelled to sign the Treaty of Passau, which virtually acknowledged the independence of the Protestant princes (August, 1552). The western frontiers of his empire were menaced by the Turkish armies, and the cannon of the Turkish fleets frowned upon the shores of Sicily and Naples. Disturbances wTere fomenting in Italy, which the Holy See warmly encouraged ; and in Lorraine his armies could barely hold their own against the French. Charles, who, whatever his demerits as a man, was not wanting in sagacity as a ruler, saw that the play was nearly played out ; that the projects of his prosperous young manhood were no longer possible ; that since he sat in the Diet of Worms, splendid, powerful, and invincible, a new order of things had arisen, with which he was unable and unfitted to contend ; that the policy in which he had been nourished was behind the time ; and that if he would retire from the stage with honour, he must at once surrender his sceptre to a firmer hand. He was not what he had been. A series of signal reverses had soured his temper, and shaken a constitution always predisposed to fits of melancholy. The harsh and undutiful behaviour of his son \u2014 in whom, however, he recognised a bigot, thoroughly adapted to carry out the repres sive policy which circumstances had hindered himself from adopting \u2014 had excited his disgust. Something of his mother's insanity ran in his blood, aud, aggravated by frequent returns of the gout, weakened his faculties and obscured his mind. The burden of the empire was too much for him, and he had sagacity enough to comprehend that it would be too much for Philip. Hi3 attachment to the Church had degenerated into a mania of fanaticism. Business wearied him ; he was suspicious of all his ministers ; he seldom showed himself in public ; and T"], [302, "274 ABDICATION OF THE EMPEROR CHARLES V. for nine months he secluded himself in his apartments, without issuing a single order or signing a single document. Under these circumstances he resolved to carry out an intention, which in his frequent fits of constitutional depression he had often an nounced, and resign the dignities whose weight he found intole rable. Formerly, the youth and inexperience of Philip, and the impossibility of obtaining his mother's consent, without which he could not hope for the approval of the Spanish Cortes, had impeded his execution of his design. But Philip had now for some time administered the government of Milan and Naples, and his mother had deceased on the 4th of April, 1555. Worn with disease, and spent with anxiety, the emperor prepared to lay aside the imperial purple. 2. The abdication of Charles V. was the last scene in the event ful drama of Spanish history. Henceforth, the chronicler has to trace the decline of the haughty power which at one time threat ened the independence of all Europe. It had sprung suddenly into the front rank ; it fell from its pride of place with equal rapidity. Its period of glory began with the consolidation of Spain under Ferdinand and Isabella ; it terminated with the abdication of the Emperor Charles. Europe always revolts against the attempt of any one power to acquire an absolute supremacy ; and as it resisted the project of Charlemagne, though at first with no apparent success, so it resisted the brilliant schemes of Charles V. Does not history repeat itself? As Charles failed in his design of a consolidated empire, so Louis XIV. failed ; and so, in our own times, Napoleon failed. And, if there be any truth in these precedents, we may reasonably conclude that the lover of freedom need never fear the success of any single nation in an attempt to acquire a permanent influence over its neighbours. 3. The growth of this Spanish prosperity, to which we have adverted, may be rapidly explained. The union of Ferdinand and Isabella, and the capture of Granada, consolidated Spain within itself. After the marriage of Mary, the heiress of Bur gundy, to the Archduke Maximilian (a.d. 1447), had united the Low Countries and Franche Comt6 to the Austrian dominions, the subsequent alliance of his son Philip, with Joanna, the heiress of Ferdinand and Isabella, added to them the entire inheritance of Spain. And as the kingdom of"], [303, "275 RISE AND FALL OF SPANISH POWER. Naples had fallen into the hands of Ferdinand of Arragon, Naples and Sicily were attached to that inheritance ; so that Charles V. \u2014 when, on the death of his grandfather Maximilian, in 1519, he was elected emperor \u2014 swayed an empire vast as that which Charlemagne had built together by thirty years of war fare. But, as Dr. Arnold has remarked, this Austro-Spanish power going beyond the just limits of the law of consolidation of States, and threatening to alter altogether the condition of Europe, a strenuous resistance was organised against it. France became its chief opponent, and kept Charles V. at bay through out the reign of Francis I. It baffled him successfully, under Henry II., allying with the German Protestants in opposition to the emperor. The mass of heterogeneous territories thus fortuitously brought together by marriage, was dissolved by the abdication of Charles V. : his brother Ferdinand succeeding to his German dominions, and his son Philip inheriting Spain, Naples, and the Netherlands. So rajjid was the growth ; so rapid the dissolution! 4. \" But though deprived,\" says Dr. Arnold, \"of his father's German dominions, yet the inheritance of Philip II. was still so ample that the Spanish power itself overstepped its just bounds, and became a new object of alarm to Europe. The conquest of Portugal, after the death of King Sebastian in Africa, had given to Philip the whole Spanish peninsula ; to this were added the Spanish discoveries and conquests in America, with the wealth derived from them ; besides the kingdom of Naples, including the islands of Sardinia and Sicily, and the seventeen provinces of the Netherlands. There was this important circumstance in addition, that France, which had successfully resisted Charles V., was now distracted by its own religious wars, and in no condition to uphold the balance of power abroad. The dominion of Philip II. was therefore a very reasonable cause of alarm. But this, too, was resisted and dissolved ; principally owing to the revolt of the Netherlands, the opposition of England, and the return of France to her proper place amongst European powers, when her religious wars were ended by Henry IV. Philip lived to see the decline of his power, and the dismemberment of his empire was sanc tioned by his successor Philip III., who virtually resigned his claim to the sovereignty of the seven United Provinces of the T 2"], [304, "276 ABDICATION OF THE EMPEROR CHARLES V. Netherlands, the newly formed republic of Holland. This great concession, expressed under the form of a truce for twelve years, was made in the year 1609, the sixth year of the reign of our James I. \" During the reign of Philip II. Austria had stood aloof from Spain ; but in the reigns of his successors the two branches of the Austrian line were drawn more closely together, and their power was exerted for the same object. The conquest of the Palatinate, by the Emperor Ferdinand II. , in 1622, again excited general alarm, and resistance was organised once more against the dangerous power of the House of Austria. France, under Richelieu, was once more the principal bond of the union ; but the power which acted the most prominent part was one which had not hitherto interfered in the general affairs of Europe \u2014 the northern kingdom of Sweden. Sweden, Holland, and the Protestant states of Germany, were leagued against the House of Austria under its two heads, the emperor and the King of Spain. Again the resisting power triumphed : the Austrian power in Germany was effectually restrained by the Peace of Westphalia, in 1648; Spain saw Portugal again become an independent kingdom ; and when she ended her quarrel with France, by the Peace of the Pyrenees in 1659, she retired for ever from the foremost place amongst the powers of Europe.\" Since consequences so important have resulted from the abdication of the Emperor Charles V., that event may be re garded as worthy of a concise description. 5. The stage which the emperor selected for his final appear ance in the purple, was the palace at Brussels ; the audience was composed of the Council of the Low Countries, the princes of the empire, and the nobles of Spain ; the time was the 25th of October, 1555. The ceremonial and the pomp were worthy of the solemnity of the occasion. In the chair of state reposed the Emperor, wan with anxiety and bent with age ; on one side was placed his son Philip, specially summoned from England and Queen Mary to receive his father's splendid but ominous gift; on the other sat his sister, Mary, Queen Dowager of Hun gary, who for five-and-twenty years had governed as Regent of the Netherlands. The rustle of plumes\u2014 the glow of jewels \u2014 the sheen of velvet and costly silks \u2014 the hum of half-hushed"], [305, "A MEMORABLE SCENE. 277 wonder \u2014 contributed to render the scene as imposing as it was unprecedented. The emperor, having acknowledged the homage of his subjects, commanded the President of the Council to explain his intention in thus convoking the Flemish States. The act of abdication was next read, by which Charles surrendered to his son Philip all his territories, jurisdiction, and authority in the Low Countries, absolving his subjects there from the oath of allegiance to him, which he required them to transfer to Philip, his lawful heir, and to serve him with the same earnestness and devotion which they had manifested for so many years towards his person and government. 6. Charles then rose from his throne, and leaning on the shoulder of the Prince of Orange \u2014 for his infirmities rendered him unable to stand without support\u2014 he addressed his silent and astonished auditors, occasionally referring, to assist his memory, to a paper which he held in his hand. He recounted \" with dignity, but without ostentation,\" the chief incidents of his busy and eventful life \u2014 his voyages and travels, his battles and sieges, his labours in peace and war ; and he added, \" while my health enabled me to perform my duty, I cheerfully bore the burden. But as my constitution is now broken by an incurable distemper, and my infirmities admonish me to retire, the hap piness of my people affects me more than the ambition of reign ing. Instead of a decrepit old man, tottering on the brink of the grave, I transfer your allegiance to a sovereign in the prime of life, vigilant, sagacious, active, and enterprising. With respect to myself, if I have committed any error in the course of a long administration, forgive, and impute it to my weakness, and not to my intention. I shall ever retain a grateful sense of your fidelity and attachment; and your welfare shall be the great object of my prayers to Almighty God, to whom I now consecrate the remainder of my days. And you, my son,\" he continued, turning to Philip, who fell on his knees and kissed his father's hands, \" let the grateful recollection of this day redouble your care and affection for your people. Other sove reigns may rejoice in having given birth to their sons, and in leaving their states to them after their death ; but I am anxious to enjoy, during life, the double satisfaction of feeling that you are indebted to me both for your birth and power. Few monarchs will follow my example, and in the lapse of ages I have"], [306, "278 ABDICATION OF THE EMPEROR CHARLES V. scarcely found one whom I myself would imitate. The resolu tion, therefore, which I have taken, and which I now carry into execution, will be justified only by your proving yourself worthy of it ; and you will only render yourself worthy of the extraordinary confidence I now repose in you, by a zealous pro tection of your religion, and by maintaining the purity of the Catholic faith ; by supporting the rights and privileges of your subjects, and by governing with justice and moderation. And may you, if ever you are desirous of retiring, like myself, to the tranquillity of private life, enjoy the inexpressible happiness of having such a son, that you may resign the crown to him with the same satisfaction as I now deliver mine to you.\" 7. This oration being ended, which one might reasonably admire, if one could forget the ambition of him who delivered it, and the cold-hearted bigotry of him to whom it was addressed, the emperor, like a consummate actor, bestowed his benedic tion on Philip, embraced him, and sank into his chair exhausted. The audience testified the depth of their real or feigned emotion by tears and sobs, and murmurs of admiration. Then the Queen Dowager of Hungary formally resigned her regency, and this extraordinary \" stage-mime,\" which had in it so much both of the tragic and the farcical, came to an end. 8. It was repeated on the 15th of January, 1556, \"in an assembly no less splendid, and with a ceremonial equally pompous.\" The Emperor then resigned the crown of Spain, with all its dignities and revenues, reserving only for himself an annual pension of 10,000 ducats, to defray his yearly expenses, and afford him wherewithal for acts of compassion and charity. It was not until the 11th of September that he left the Low Countries, and on the 28th he landed at Loredo in Biscay. As soon as he touched the shore he fell prostrate on his face, and kissing the earth, exclaimed, \" Naked I came into the world, and naked I return to thee, thou common mother of mankind ; to thee I dedicate my body, as the only recompense I can make for all the benefits conferred upon me.\" Then, holding up a crucifix, he burst into tears, while acknowledging the goodness of the Saviour, in permitting him to revisit, at the close of his life, that kingdom which was always dearest to his heart, and to which, under Providence, he ascribed all his victories and triumphs."], [307, "279 HIS LAST YEARS AND DEATH. 9. From Loredo he proceeded, by such stages as his health would permit, to the convent of St. Justus, near Placentia, in the province of Estramadura. In this seclusion he spent the remainder of his life, not wholly withdrawn from the interests of that world which he had affected to despise ; constructing watches, and moralising upon the difficulty of making them keep time ; seeking to compensate for mortified ambition and disap pointed hopes, by the very frenzy of religious fanaticism ; gorging himself to repletion at his daily banquets; rehearsing his funeral in melancholy madness, his body in a coffin, and the monks of his monastery as mourners; and closing thus un worthily a career which, had his heart been as large as his intellect was vigorous, might have accomplished so much for the world and his own fame, on the 21st of September, 1558, in the fifty -ninth year of his age, and the forty -fifth of his reign."], [308, "CHRONOLOGICAL LINKS BETWEEN THE ABDICATION OF CHARLES V.

The contemplated invasion of England by the Spanish Armada was another of those persistent attempts of the Church of Rome to establish an undivided supremacy over the civilised world, of which European history affords so many examples. At the present day, the Englishman, contrasting the relative positions of England and Spain, can hardly bring himself to believe that such a project was ever possible. But in the days of Elizabeth Spain was the paramount European power. She was superior to every other state in those glorious traditions which are so important an element of success, in her military and naval resources, in wealth, and cohesion of government. Her Transatlantic colonies fed her commerce and filled her treasuries. The Iberian peninsula was ruled by one sovereign, and no independent Portugal curbed her ambition and dis tracted her attention. France was no longer a dreaded rival, \u2014 her civil dissensions having paralysed her energies. The Spanish empire, under Philip II. , embraced some of the richest territories of three quarters of the world : in Europe \u2014 Spain,"], [310, "282 DEFEAT OF THE SPANISH ARMADA. Portugal, Naples and Sicily, Milan, Franche-Comte, and the Netherlands; in Asia \u2014 the Philippine and Sunda Islands, and the Moluccas ; in America \u2014 Peru and Mexico, Hispaniola, Cuba, and most of those islands now known under the collective name of the West Indies. From these she derived the most valuable resources, and her commerce with her more distant possessions nourished a large mercantile marine, which is always the best basis of a national navy. 2. But not only could Philip II. boast of a powerful fleet; his army was unequalled in numbers, equipment, and discipline ; and both army and navy were inspired by the memories of a long series of triumphs. They were wielded, too, by one despotic authority, and bound together by religious sentiment as well as patriotic feeling. They were not only the soldiers of Spain, but of the Church, and the Spanish standard was nowhere planted without the blessing of the Holy See. More over, that spirit of enterprise and daring, that chivalrous fervour, that zealous devotion which had been engendered by centuries of warfare with the Moors, had not as yet been crushed into the dust by the incubus of an absolute monarchy. The men of Castile and Arragon were still the worthy descendants of the knights and vassals who had so gallantly asserted the victory of the Cross over the Crescent ; and zeal for the Church was still active and vigorous in the hearts of those brave warriors whose sires had bled in the name of Christ, and vanquished the heathen Paynims, the slaves of the accursed Mahomet. Thus Philip II. might reasonably hope to succeed in his schemes of universal conquest when against the divided and enfeebled states of Europe he could bring into the field not only the wealth of a mighty empire, but the spirit of religious fanaticism and the power of patriotic enthusiasm. He himself was a bigot, sincere, stern, and obstinate. He regarded himself as marked out by Heaven as the champion of the Church, its first and most favoured soldier, who was to establish the Papal power through out Europe, and quench the fires of heresy in blood. It was the dream, the ambition, the object of his life. Both earthly and heavenly crowns would be his reward ; on earth he would reign the lord-paramount of the civilised world ; in heaven his seat would be in the loftiest rank of the celestial hierarchy. Many things seemed to favour the projects of his pious ambition. The"], [311, "ENGLAND AND PHILIP Is. 283 reformed religion, which at first had sprung upward with so noble a vigour, and spread its roots into so many lands, seemed on the verge of a premature decay. The glorious tree was bowed backward, and bigots could not perceive that it would soon leap forward with even a more wonderful energy than before. They looked around, and saw that in Italy and Spain the \" new heresy \" had been completely extinguished. Belgium, which had previously been half Protestant, had been reconquered both in allegiance and creed by Philip, and had become one of the most Catholic countries in the world. Half Germany had been won back to the old faith. In Savoy, in Switzerland, and many other countries, the progress of the counter-Reformation had been rapid and decisive. The Catholic League seemed victorious in France. The Papal Court itself had shaken off the supine ness of recent centuries ; and, at the head of the Jesuits and the other new ecclesiastical orders, was displaying a vigour and a boldness worthy of the days of Hildebrand or Innocent III. 3. But there was one obstacle which disagreeably obtruded itself, when Philip amused his imagination with dreams of conquest and religious proselytism \u2014 the heretic spirit of free England. It was true that she seemed in many respects a despicable foe : she had no colonies, no fleet, no standing army. Scotland was a separate kingdom, and Ireland then as now a source of weakness, and the focus of disorder and discontent. The Catholic Church had still numerous adherents within her borders. The title of her sovereign was disputed by a large and not uninfluential party ; and her Continental alliances were neither many nor powerful. She could rely only on the Dutch, Protestant, like herself, but whose resources were scarcely adequate to maintain their revolt against the oppressions of Spain. Yet England was Philip's resolute and unresting foe. Her seamen harassed his American colonies and captured his treasure ships ; defeated his squadrons, and plundered his ports ; disgraced and humiliated his flag both in the Old World and the New. Her sovereign assisted his rebellious subjects with men and money, without which succour his armies would soon have recovered Flanders. They loaded himself \u2014 him, the son of Charles V., the favoured soldier of the Church with ridicule and contempt, bringing him on their licen tious stage, laughing at him in their free and daring press."], [312, "284 DEFEAT OF THE SPANISH ARMADA. And well, too, he remembered the unconcealed scorn and loathing with which they had regarded the husband of Mary Tudor ; the indignant contempt with which his proposals for the hand of Elizabeth had been rejected. England, the aggres sive opponent of his power \u2014 England, the heretical enemy of his faith \u2014 England, the audacious scorner of himself \u2014 was therefore the object of his unfaltering hatred, and against England he was resolved to proclaim a new crusade. He was stimulated also by the exhortations and encouragements of Sixtus V., the then Pope of Rome, who recognised in England \"the central point of Protestant power and policy.\" 4. Philip's schemes, however, remained in abeyance during the life of Mary Queen of Scots. She was Elizabeth's heir ; and, on her accession to the crown, the Church of Rome might reasonably calculate on her exertions in behalf of the religion she herself professed. But Mary's death in 1587 excited the fury and hatred of the Pope and his ally to a pitch of madness. A Protestant queen had brought to the scaffold her Catholic rival. There was no longer any hope of a peaceful restoration of the Papal power ; and it behoved every true son of Rome to join in a crusade against the murderous heretic. A formal treaty was therefore concluded, in June, 1587, between the Pope and King Philip, by which the former bound himself to contribute a million of scudi to the expenses of the projected invasion, to be paid as soon as the Spanish had obtained posses sion of an English port. \" Thus,\" says the eloquent historian of the Papacy, the German Ranke, \" thus did the united powers of Italy and Spain, from which such mighty influences had gone forth over the whole world, now rouse themselves for an attack upon England ! The king had already compiled, from the archives of Simancas, a statement of the claims which he had to the throne of that country on the extinction of the Stuart line ; the most brilliant prospects, especially that of an universal dominion of the seas, were associated in- his mind with this enterprise. Everything seemed to conspire to such an end : the predominance of Catholicism in Germany, the renewed attack upon the Huguenots in France, the attempt upon Geneva, and the enterprise against England. At the same moment a thoroughly Catholic prince, Sigismund III., ascended the throne of Poland, with the prospect also of suture succession to"], [313, "285 A PRELIMINARY BLOW. the throne of Sweden. But whenever any principle or power, be it what it may, aims at unlimited supremacy in Europe, some vigorous resistance to it, having its origin in the deepest springs of human nature, invariably arises. Philip II. had to encounter newly-awakened powers, braced by the vigour of youth, and elevated by a sense of their future destiny. The intrepid corsairs, who had rendered every sea insecure, now clustered round the coasts of their native island. The Pro testants in a body \u2014 even the Puritans, although they had been subject to as severe oppressions as the Catholics \u2014 rallied round their queen, who now gave admirable proof of her masculine courage, and her priucely talent of winning the affections, and leading the minds, and preserving the allegiance of men.\" 5. The English government had not been unmindful of the perils which threatened the nation, and a bold stroke was dealt at Philip's power in 1587, which considerably retarded his naval preparations, while its success inflamed the ardour and stimulated the courage of the English seamen. While every exertion was being made at home, while every county as raising its levies, while munitions of war were accumu lated in considerable quantities, and with wonderful rapidity, while defences were rising along the whole extent of the sea shore, \u2014 it was considered desirable to distract the attention of the Spanish government from these armaments, and at the same time to cripple its resources before its formidable army could take the field. The first step, therefore, was to ascertain, by the personal inspection of some trusty officer, the actual state of the enemy's preparations in the ports of Spain and Portugal ; and to intercept any supplies of men, stores, or ammunition that the Duke of Parma might despatch from the Low Countries. It was also desirable that incursions should be attempted against the enemy's harbours on the western coast of Spain, to destroy therein whatever shipping might be collected, as well as fall upon any convoys or traders met with at sea. A fleet was hastily assembled ; four vessels of war were supplied by the queen, and twenty by the merchants of Liverpool and other ports. These were manned by experienced seamen ; armed and equipped with a formidable completeness, and placed under the command of Francis Drake, whose name was not unjustly regarded as a certain omen of success."], [314, "286 DEFEAT OF THE SPANISH ARMADA. G. The expedition sailed from Plymouth on the 2nd of April, 1587 \u2014 the admiral's flag streaming from the mast-head of the Elizabeth Bonaventura ; and obtaining sure intelligence of a vast quantity of warlike stores accumulated at Cadiz for the purveyance of the Spanish fleet, thitherward he first proceeded. His gallant vessels rode into the harbour on the 19th of April, and after a brisk skirmish with some galleys, attacked the throng of masts gathered under the guns of the land-batteries. So effectually, in spite of an incessant and well-directed fire, was Drake's work performed that by nightfall nearly a hundred sail of French and Spanish had been destroyed. His fleet, however, was sorely harassed by the numerous Spanish ships which, when they could no longer be defended, the enemy set on fire, and turned adrift to carry destruction into the midst of the English. 7. Drake departed from the Cadiz Roads on the 21st, and glided along the coast to Cape Sagres, capturing on his way a hundred vessels of different burthens, all laden wdth warlike munitions and materiel. The defences at Sagres were assaulted by the English troops ; they quickly surrendered. In the Cas caes Roads, off Lisbon, lay the Marquis of Santa Cruz, with his galleys ; but the marquis knew that discretion was the better part of valour, and looked on courteously and complacently, while Drake seized and destroyed all the shipping he could discover. He then shaped his course for the Azores, and within some twenty or thirty leagues of St. Michael, fell in with a richly -laden Portuguese carrack, the St. Philip, and captured it, much to the profit of every one concerned in the adventure. \" The wealth of this prize,\" says an old chronicler, \" seemed so great unto the whole company (as in truth it was), that they assured themselves every man would receive a sufficient reward for all his trouble and expenses : and thereupon they all resolved to return home without further delay in looking for prizes, in which they were gratified by the approbation of the general, who was fully aware of the very great value of the prize he had captured. He therefore ordered his squadron to bear up for England, which they all most cheerfully obeyed; and happily arrived in Plymouth the same summer, with their whole fleet of merchant ships, and this rich booty, to their own profit and due commendation, and to the great admiration of the whole"], [315, "287 FRENCH DIPLOMACY. kingdom, and the extreme care and anxiety of her Majesty's government to secure that ' rich booty' for future appropria tion.\" Apart from the advantage gained by so vast a destruc tion of the enemy's munitions of war, this \" singeing of the King of Spain's beard,\" as Drake humorously called it, strengthened the confidence of English seamen in their own valour, energy, and success. 8. The English ministry, however, do not seem to have fully appreciated the extent of the danger with which they were threatened. They appear to have put some faith in diplomacy as a means of avoiding it. Though Henry III., of France, did not fail to warn them of the character and destination of the vast armament which Spain was collecting, they still endea voured to open negotiations with Philip, and both parties sent ambassadors to Ostend in the beginning of 1588. Six months were consumed in fruitless diplomacy, before Burleigh could be induced to believe that to be prepared for war is the best means to avoid it. The French king, meanwhile reiterated his warn ings, and when he \"found that they were neglected, sought to conclude a treaty with England's enemy. His interest in the matter was not a trivial one. If Spain and England were at peace, there would be no obstacle to Philip's subjugation of the Netherlands, which would place France completely at his mercy. A similar result would follow Philip's conquest of England. The perplexed monarch, therefore, involved himself in a diplomatic labyrinth. To dissuade Elizabeth from any arrangement with Philip, he offered to support her, in case she were attacked by the Spaniards, with twice the number of troops which he was bound by the treaty of 1574 to send to her assistance. He had a long conference with her ambassador, Stafford, upon this subject, and told him that the Pope and the Catholic king had entered into a league against the queen, his mistress, and had invited himself and the Venetians to join them, but they had refused to do so. \" If the Queen of Eng land,\" he added, \" concludes a peace with the Catholic king, the Pope will aid the League with all his forces to overthrow her, and you may imagine what fate is reserved for your mistress after that.\" On the other hand, in order most effec tually to frustrate the negotiation, he proposed to Philip II. to form a still closer union between the two crowns of France and"], [316, "288 DEFEAT OF THE SPANISH ARMADA. Spain ; and, at the same time, he secretly despatched a confi dential ambassador to Constantinople, to warn the Sultan, that if he did not again declare war against Philip, that sovereign, who already possessed the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, the Indies, and nearly all Italy, would soon make himself master of England, and then direct the forces of all Europe against the Turks. 9. But Philip was a master of state-craft, and sought in France itself for a counterpoise to its king. He found one in the person of the famous Duke of Guise, the head of the League, and the chief of the French fanatics, by whom he was enthusi astically adored. Philip induced him to declare open war against Henry III., as a traitor to his religion, and a secret friend to the Huguenots ; promising him, in support of the enterprise, 300,000 crowns, 6,000 infantry, and 1,200 pikemen ; to withdraw his ambassador from the Parisian court, and accredit one to the party of the League. \"A treaty was con cluded on these conditions, and the Duke of Guise entered Paris, where he was expected by the League*rs, and whence he expelled Henry III., on the 12 h of May, by the insurrection of the barricades. A fortnight after this insurrection, which reduced Henry III. to impotence, and, to use the language of the Prince of Parma, did not even ' permit him to assist the Queen of England with his tears, as he needed them all to weep over his own misfortunes,' the Spanish fleet left the Tagus, and sailed towards the British isles.\" 10. Elizabeth's ministers awoke at last to a sense of the dangers of the situation, and exertions were hurriedly made' to put the country in a proper state of defence. Circular letters from the queen were sent round to the lord-lieutenants of every shire, desiring them \" to call together the best sort of gentlemen under their lieutenancy, and to declare unto them these great preparations and arrogant threatenings, now burst forth in action upon the seas ; wherein every man's particular state, in the highest degree, could be touched in respect of country, liberty, wives, children, lands, lives, and (which was specially to be regarded) the profession of the true and sincere religion of Christ ; and to lay before them the infinite and unspeakable miseries that would fall out upon any such change, which miseries were evidently seen by the fruits of that hard and cruel"], [317, "PREPARATIONS FOR DEFENCE. 289 government holden in countries not far distant. We do look that the most part of them should have, upon this instant extraordinary occasion, a larger proportion of furniture, both for horsemen and footmen, but especially horsemen, than hath been certified ; thereby to be in their best strength against any attempt, or to be employed about our own person, or other wise.\" Similar appeals were made to the nobility, to the wealthy cities, to the clergy, to every class of the community, and the heart of England responded to these appeals with swift enthusiasm. \"In a very short time all the whole realm, and every corner, were furnished with armed men, on horseback and on foot ; and these continually trained, exercised, and put into bands, in warlike manner, as in no age ever was before in this realm. There was no sparing of money to provide horses, armour, weapons, powder, and all necessaries ; no, nor want of provision of pioneers, carriages, and victuals, in every county of the realm, without exception, to attend upon the armies. And to this general furniture every man voluntarily offered, very many their services personally without wages, others money for armour and weapons, and to wage soldiers, a matter strange, .and never the like heard of in this realm or elsewhere. And this general reason moved all men to large contributions, that when a conquest was to be withstood, wherein all should be lost, it was no time to spare a portion.\" 11. Never since the era of the Norman Conquest had a fate so terrible impended over England. It was not conquest alone that she had to fear, but annihilation. The success of the Spaniards meant the reduction of England to a dependency, the abolition of her laws, the destruction of her rights and privi leges, the imposition upon the majority of a detested religion. We pity the Englishman who, in these piping times of peace, can lisp smooth phrases in disparagement of \" England's Sa lamis,\" or fling calumny or ridicule upon the sacred person of the lion-hearted Elizabeth. The men of her own day better understood her value. They knew that she stood between England and Antichrist \u2014 between free and Protestant England and the tyranny and oppression of the Church of Rome ; and they were grateful to her that she so splendidly asserted the freedom and independence of Saxondom ; they were grateful to her that she lived ! U"], [318, "290 DEFEAT OF THE SPANISH ARMADA. 12. The queen, in this hour of peril, called to her councils the best, bravest and wisest of England's knights and nobles. Besides her trusted ministers, she invited the aid of Lord Grey, Sir Walter Raleigh, Sir Francis Knolles, Sir Thomas Leighton, Sir John Norris, Sir Richard Grenville, Sir Richard Bingham, and Sir Roger Williams. Three principal subjects engaged the attention of these worthies. First, they prepared a list of places where it was probable the Spanish army might attempt a descent, as well as of those which lay most exposed to the force under the Duke of Parma. They next considered the speediest and most effectual means of defence, whether by fortification or the muster of a military array ; and, lastly, deliberated on the course to be taken for fighting the enemy if he should land.* There were some who advocated the policy too much in favour in these present times ; that of bestowing the whole attention and resources of the government upon the levy and equipment of a large military force, with which to attack the enemy if he attempted a landing. But others more wisely argued in favour of fitting out a powerful fleet to oppose the enemy at sea, and prevent, if possible, his landing at all. And if there is any truth in the old belief that it is wise to meet a danger half-way, such a policy is assuredly the more reasonable. England has won her power and glory at sea ; and at sea she must defend them. She may fortify her more important arsenals, her Ports months, Plymouths, and Chathams ; but the necessities of her polity, the genius of her inhabitants, the exigencies of her commerce, forbid the erection of peaceful towns into formid able garrisons ; and Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Bradford, you cannot transform into a Valenciennes, a Metz, or a Liege, bristling with ramparts and threatening with redoubts and bas tions. The words of Sir Walter Raleigh, written in reference to the Armada may be read even now with diligent consideration. To the question, Could England without the help of her fleet be able to debar an enemy from landing ? he replies, \" I hold that she is unable so to do ; and, therefore, I think it most dangerous to make the adventure. For, the encouragement of a first vic tory to an enemy, and the discouragement of being beaten to the invaded, may draw after it a most perilous consequence.\" * TytiVs Life of Raleigh."], [319, "RALEIGH ON THE DEFENCE OF ENGLAND. 291 13. The substance of the advice which Raleigh gave to Elizabeth is preserved in his noble fragment, \" The History ot the World.\" \" Great difference,\" he says, \" I know there is, and a diverse consideration to be had, between such a country as France is, strengthened with many fortified places ; and this of ours, where our ramparts are but the bodies of men. But I say that an army to be transported over sea, and to be landed again in an enemy's country, and the place left to the choice of the invader, cannot be resisted on the coast of England without a fleet to impeach it ; no, nor on the coast of France, or any other country ; except every creek, port, or sandy bay, had a powerful army in each of them to make opposition. For, let the supposition be granted that Kent is able to furnish 12,000 foot, and that those 12,000 be laid in the three best landing places within that county, to wit, 3,000 at Margate, 3,000 at the Ness, and 6,000 at Folkestone, that is, somewhat equally distant from them both ; as also that two of these troops (unless some other order be thought more fit) be directed to strengthen the third, when they shall see the enemy's fleet to head towards it: I say, that notwithstanding this provision, if the enemy, setting sail from the Isle of Wight, in the first watch of the night, and towing their long boats at their sterns, shall arrive by dawn of day at the Ness, and thrust their army on shore there, it will be hard for those 3,000 that are at Mar gate (twenty and four long miles from thence) to come time enough to reinforce their fellows at the Ness. Nay, how shall they at Folkestone be able to do it, who are nearer by more than half the way ? seeing that the enemy, at his first arrival, will either make his entrance by force, with three or four shot of great artillery, and quickly put the first 3,000 that are entrenched at the Ness to run, or else give them so much to do that they shall be glad to send for help to Folkestone, and perhaps to Margate, whereby those places will be left bare. Now, let us suppose that all the 12,000 Kentish soldiers arrive at the Ness, ere the enemy can be ready to disembark his army, so that he will find it unsafe to land in the face of so many prepared to withstand him, yet must we believe that he will play the best of his own game (having liberty to go which way he list), and under covert of the night, set sail to wards the east, where what shall hinder him to take ground U 2"], [320, "292 DEFEAT OF THE SPANISH ARMADA. either at Margate, the Downs, or elsewhere, before they, at the Ness, can be well aware of his departure ? Certainly there is nothing more easy than to do it. Yea, the like may be said of Weymouth, Purbeck, Poole, and of all landing-places in the south-west ; for there is no man ignorant that ships, with out putting themselves out of breath, will easily outrun the soldiers that coast them. 'Les armees ne volent point en posted \u2014 'Armies neither fly, nor run post,' says a marshal of France.* And I know it to be true that a fleet of ships may be seen at sunset, and after it at the Lizard, yet by the next morning they may recover Portland ; whereas an army of foot shall not be able to march it in six days. Again, when those troops lodged on the sea-shores, shall be forced to run from place to place in vain, after a fleet of ships, they will at length sit down in the midway, and leave all at adventure. But say it were otherwise, that the invading enemy will offer to land in some such place where there shall be an army of ours ready to receive him ; yet it cannot be doubted, but that when the choice of all our trained bands, and the choice of our commanders and captains, shall be drawn together (as they were at Tilbury in the year 1588) to attend the person of the prince, and for the defence of the city of London, they that remain to guard the coast can be of no such force as to encounter an army like unto that wherewith it was intended that the Prince of Parma should have landed in England. \" For end of this digression, I hope that this question shall never come to trial ; her Majesty's many moveable forts will forbid the experience. And although the English will no less disdain than any nation under heaven can do to be beaten upon their own ground, or elsewhere, by a foreign enemy ; yet, to entertain those that shall assail us with their own beef in their bellies, and before they eat of our Kentish capons, I take it to be the wisest way ; to do which, her Majesty, after God, will employ her good ships on the seas, and not trust in any entrenchment upon the shore.\" 14. England as a nation has usually made good the short comings of her governors ; and the failures and administrative errors of Burleigh and Leicester were, in the year of peril, * Time often confutes the sayings of the wise and witty.

The Catholics were not behind their Pro testant fellow-subjects in loyalty to their Queen and common country. In every shire they repaired to the standard of the lord-lieutenant, \"imploring,\" says Hallam, \"that they might not be suspected of bartering the national independence for their religion itself.\" The Lord High Admiral himself, the gallant and chivalrous Howard, was a Catholic. Traitors, in deed, there were, but so few in number that their existence did but the more strongly mark the unanimity of patriotism which spread, like the glow of sunshine, throughout the land. At the clang of the Spaniards' weapons the great true heart of England throbbed loyally and steadfastly, and men vowed, in a significant silence, stem and deep, that never should hostile foot profane the \" inviolate isle.\" 15. The \" first line of defence \" with which the Queen's courage and her subjects' devotedness speedily encircled Eng land, was composed as follows : \u2014 a. Of her Majesty's ships, under the Lord High Admiral, Lord Howard of Effingham, 30 \u2014 carrying 6,279 seamen, and of 11,850 tons burthen. b. Of hired ships, 10\u2014750 tons ; 239 men. c. Of Sir Francis Drake's squadron, 32 \u2014 5,120 tons ; 2,348 men. d. Contributed by the Citv of London, 38 \u2014 6,130 tons ; 2,170 men. e. Of Coasters with the Lord Admiral, 28 \u2014 1,930 tons ; 993 men. /. Of Coasters with the Lord Henry Seymour, 23 \u2014 2,248 tons ; 1,073 men. g. Of Volunteers with the Lord High Admiral, 18 \u2014 1,719 tons ; 859 men. ft. Victuallers, 15\u2014810 men. i. Of Miscellaneous, 7 \u2014 474 men. Thus, in the aggregate, England had assembled 197 ships of 29,744 tons burthen, and carrying 15,785 men. These ships were lighter and better built than the Spanish, and their crews were more experienced, flushed by the memories of successes in the Spanish Main, and animated with an intense hatred of everything \" Papistical.\" But here again the government had failed in its duty, and the fleet upon which the liberties of Eng land depended was ill provided with stores, and most inade quately supplied with so important an article as gunpowder. There was but one ship of 1,100 tons (the Triumph), one of 1,000, one of 900, two of 800 each, three of 600, five of 500, five of 400, six of 300, six of 250, twenty of 200, and the remainder were all below 200. The admiral was Lord Howard of Effingham, ably seconded by Francis Drake, by V"], [322, "294 DEFEAT OF THE SPANISH ARMADA. Hawkins, Frobisher, Turner, and other of the famous \" sea dogs \" of a stirring time. Help was readily proffered by the Dutch, who had a common interest in disputing Philip's inso lent claim of universal monarchy, and whose fortunes were as deeply implicated as those of the English in the issue of this great trial by battle. Therefore, as Stowe quaintly says, \" The Hollanders came roundly in, with threescore sail, brave ships of war, fierce and full of spleen, not so much for England's aid, as in just occasion for their own defence; these men, foreseeing the greatness of the danger that might ensue, if the Spaniards should chance to win the day and get the mastery over them ; in due regard whereof their manly courage was inferior to none.\" 16. Philip's preparations had been immense. He had entered on the New Crusade with all the thoroughness of an enthu siastic bigot, and he had concentrated the entire resources of his mighty empire upon an enterprise which gratified equally his lust of power, his revenge, and his fanaticism. Levies were made in every country of men trained to the use of arms, whom the promise of pay and plunder and the favour of the Church drew to his standard in excited throngs. Granaries were emptied to provision his assembled hosts. The armourers and the smiths were busy in furbishing weapons, and every harbour was crowded with ships of war. From east and west, from north and south, the omnipotent will of the despot drew supplies for his vast undertaking ; and the energy and vigour \u2014 the power and determination of the man, are best understood from a careful survey of the armament and material of the mighty Armada which he launched against the faith and liberty of England. They are clearly set forth by the contemporary annalist, Meteran, whose statement will be found translated in old Haklnyt's interesting collection of \" Voyages and Travels of the English Nation,\" and may be reprinted here : \u2014 \" A very large and particular description of this navie was put in print and published by the Spaniards, wherein was set downe the number, names, and burthens of the shippes, the number of mariners and soldiers throughout the whole fleete ; likewise the quantitie of their ordinance, of their armour, of bullets, of match, of gunpowder, of victuals, and of all their navall furniture, was in the saide description particularised."], [323, "THE SPANISH ARMADA. 295 Unto all these were added the names of the governours, the captaines, noblemen and gentlemen voluntaries, of whom there was so great a multitude, that scarce was there any family of accompt, or any one principall man throughout all Spaine, that had not a brother, sonne, or kinsman in that fleete ; who all of them were in good hope to purchase unto themselves in that navie (as they termed it) invincible, endless glory and renown, and to possess themselves of great seignories and riches in England, and in the Low Countreys. But because the said description was translated and published out of Spanish into divers other languages, we will here only make an abridge ment or brief rehearsal thereof. \" Portugal furnished and set forth, under the conduct of the Duke of Medina Sidonia, generall of the fleete, 10 galeons, 2 zabras, 1,300 mariners, 3,300 souldiers, 300 great pieces, with all requisite furniture. \" Biscay, under the conduct of John Martines de Ricaldi, admiral of the whole fleete, set forth 10 galeons, 4 pataches, 700 mariners, and 2,000 souldiers, 260 great pieces, &c. \" Guipusco, under the conduct of Michael de Orquendo, 10 galeons, 4 pataches, 700 mariners, 2,000 souldiers, 310 great pieces. \" Italy, with the Levant Islands, under Martine de Venten dona, lO galeons, 800 mariners, 2,000 souldiers, and 380 great pieces, &c. \" Andalusia, under the conduct of Pedro de Valdez, 10 galeons, one patache, 800 mariners, 2,400 souldiers, 280 great pieces, &c. \" Item, under the conduct of John Lopez de Medina, 23 great Flemish hulks, with 700 mariners, 3,200 souldiers, and 400 great pieces. \" Item, under Hugo de Mongada, 4 galliasses, containing 1,200 galley-slaves, 460 mariners, 870 souldiers, 200 great pieces, &c. \"Item, under Diego de Mandrana, 4 gallies of Portugall, with 888 galley-slaves, 360 mariners, 20 great pieces, and other requisite furniture. \" Item, under Anthonie de Mendoza, 22 pataches and zabras, with 574 mariners, 488 souldiers, and 193 great pieces. \" Besides the ships afore-mentioned, there were 20 caravels"], [324, "296 DEFEAT OF THE SPANISH ARMADA. rowed with oares, being appointed to perform necessary services under the greater ships, insomuch that all the ships apper tayning to this navie amounted unto the summe of 150, eche one being sufficiently provided of furniture and victuals. The number of mariners in the said fleete were above 8,000 ; of slaves, 2,088, of souldiers, 20,000 (besides noblemen and gentlemen voluntaries) ; of great cast pieces, 2,600. The fore said ships were of an huge and incredible capacitie and receipt; for the whole fleete was large enough to containe the burthen of 60,0U0 tunnes. \" The galeons were 64 in number, being of an huge bignesse, and very flately built ; being of marveilous force also, and so high that they resembled great castles, most fit to defend them selves and to withstand any assault, but in giving any other ships the encounter farr inferiour unto the English and Dutch ships, which can with great dexteritie wield and turne them selves at all assayes. The upperworke of the said galeons was of thicknesse and strength sufficient to bear off musket shot. The lowerworke and the timbers thereof were out of measure strong, being framed of planks and ribs four or five foote in thicknesse, insomuch that no bullets could pierce them, but such as were discharged hard at hand ; which afterwards proved true, for a great number of bullets were found to stick fast with in the massy substance of those thick planks. Great and well pitched cables were turned about the masts of their ships, to strengthen them against the battery of shot. \" The galliasses were of such bignesse, that they contained within them chambers, chapels, turrets, pulpits, and other commodities of great houses. The galliasses were rowed with great oars, there being in each one of them 300 slaves for the same purpose, and were able to do great service with the force of their ordnance. All these, together with the residue afore named, were furnished and beautified with trumpets, streamers, banners, warlike ensigns, and such other like ornaments. \" Their pieces of brazen ordnance were 1,600, and of yron, 1,000. \" The bullets thereto belonging were 120,000. \"Item, of gunpowder, 5,600 quintals ; of matches, 1,200 quintals ; of muskets and callivers, 7,000 ; of halberts and partisans, 10,000."], [325, "THE SPANISH ARMADA. 297 \" Moreover, they had great store of canons, double canons, culverings and field-pieces for land services. \" Likewise they were provided of all instruments necessary on land to conveigh and transport their furniture from place to place ; as, namely, of carts, wheeles, wagons, &c. Also they had spades, mattocks, and baskets, to set pioners to worke. They had in like sort great store of mules and horses, and what soever else was requisite for a land army. They were so well stored of biscuit, that for the space of halfe a yeere they might allow eche person in the whole fleete half a quintall every month ; whereof the whole summe amounteth to 100,000 quintals. \" Likewise of wine they had 147,000 pipes, sufficient also for half a yeeres expedition ; of bacon, 6,500 quintals ; of cheese, 3,000 quintals. Besides fish, rise, beanes, pease, oil, vinegar, &c. \" Moreover they had 12,000 pipes of fresh water, and all other necessary provision, as, namely, candles, lanternes, lampes, sailes, hempe, oxe-hides, and lead to stop holes that should be made with the battery of gunshot. To be short, they brought all things expedient, either for a fleete by sea, or for an armie by land. \" This navie (as Diego Pimentelli afterwards confessed) was esteemed by the king himselfe to containe 32,000 persons, and to cost him every day 30,000 ducates. \" There were in the said navie five terzaes of Spaniards (which terzaes the Frenchmen call regiments), under the com mand of five governours, termed by the Spaniards masters of the field ; andamongst the rest there were many olde and expert souldiers chosen out of the garrisons of Sicilie, Naples, and Tercera. Their captaines or colonels were Diego Pimentelli, Don Francisco de Toledo, Don Alonco de Lucon, Don Nicolas de Isla, Don Augustin de Mexia ; who had each of them 32 compainies under their conduct. Besides the which compainies there were many bands also of Castilians and Portugals, every one of which had their peculiar governours, captaines, officers, colours, and weapons.\" 17. In addition to this formidable armament, which occupied all the ports and arsenals of Spain in active preparation, the Prince of Parma was collecting, at Dunkirk and on the Flemish coast, a squadron of stout ships of war, and a flotilla of transports"], [326, "298 DEFEAT OF THE SPANISH ARMADA. and flat-bottomed boats for the transport to England of the army intended for its subjugation. He caused the woods of Waes to be felled for timber to be employed in the construction of flat-bottomed boats, which, floating down the rivers and canals to Dunkirk and Meinport, were to embark the troops under his command, and carry them to the mouth of the Thames, escorted by the Spanish fleet. Fascines and tumbrils, ammunition-waggons and siege-machines, pontoons, the frame work of castles, tents \u2014 ay, and the instruments of torture em ployed in the dungeons of the Inquisition \u2014 were collected in large quantities and placed on board the Armada. Besides the troops who were in his garrisons, or under his immediate com mand, 5,000 infantry were sent to him from Italy, 4,000 from Naples, 3,000 from\" Arragon, 6,000 from Castile, 3,000 from Austria and Germany, together with four squadrons of heavily armed dragoons ; so that the Prince of Parma soon found him self at the head of 34,000 veteran soldiers, the best in Europe, seasoned by a long experience of warfare, and baptized in fire. Among them, as officers, served many of the noblest Catholic families in Spain and Italy. Divers princes and noblemen came from divers countries : out of Spain came the Duke of Pestrana, who was said to be the son of Ruy Gomez de Silva, but was reputed to be a natural son of King Philip; the Marquis of Bourgou, one of the Archduke Ferdinand's sons ; Don Vespasian Gonzaga, of the house of Mantua, a great soldier, who had been viceroy in Spain ; Giovanni de Medici, Bastard of Florence ; Amadeus, Bastard of Savoy, \" with many such like, besides others of meaner quality.\" 18. The leader of this famous host, Alexander Farnese, Prince of Parma, was one of the most experienced generals of his age. His valour and conduct had recovered to the Spanish crown many of the towns and districts in the Netherlands that had revolted from it. His administrative capacity was equal to his military skill ; his sagacity was not inferior to his courage, \" He was idolised by his troops, whose affections he knew how to win with out relaxing their discipline or diminishing his own authority. Pre-eminently cool and circumspect in his plans, but swift and energetic when the moment arrived for a decisive blow, neglect ing no risk that caution could provide against, conciliating even the populations of the districts which he attacked, by his scru-"], [327, "BALANCE OF THE TWO POWERS. 299 pulous good faith, his moderation, and his address, Farnese was one of the most formidable generals that ever could be placed at the head of an army designed not only to win battles, but to effect conquests. Happy it is for England and the world that this island was saved from becoming an arena for the exhibi tion of his powers.\" For Elizabeth had no generals able to compete with so illustrious a hero. Leicester's splendour and ambition were no match for Parma's genius as a soldier and a statesman, and yet to Leicester the fatal favouritism of Eliza beth had entrusted the command of England's only army. Sir Francis de Vere, the most competent of the English com manders, was in the Netherlands, and it is not too much to assert that, despite of the enthusiasm and intrepidity of the English troops \u2014 led by a Leicester, they could not have success- fully withstood the onset of Parma's veterans. 19. Before proceeding to describe the fortunes of the immense host which the energy and resources of Philip had collected, a tabular view of its component parts, as recorded by the most reliable authorities, will not be without interest to the reader. It will the better enable him to comprehend the urgency of the danger from which Providence, in its mercy, was pleased to rescue England, in the year of peril, 1588 : \u2014 No. of Ships.

If Providence were always, as Napoleon asserted, on the side of the strongest battalions, there is no doubt that the Armada would have vindicated her claim to the haughty title of the Invincible, suggested by Philip's arrogance. Every imaginable stimulant had been addressed to the religious zeal, as well as to the lust after plunder, of the Spanish forces. Not only were visions of wealthy cities and well-filled granaries held out before the dazzled eyes of these new soldiers of the Church, these veterans of the Fourth Crusade, but distributed amongst the fleet were upwards of 100 monks, who prophesied victory and encouraged the soldier to hope for celestial bliss as well as terrestrial pleasures. These priests were destined, when the second conquest of England was accomplished, to traverse the length and breadth of the heretical isle, and convert its inhabi tants by prayers and thumbscrews, by racks and rosaries, to the True Faith. Twelve of the largest ships were named after the Twelve Apostles. The special blessing of the Pope had been poured out upon the expedition ; his anathema had been fulmi nated against the Protestant queen ; and, in all the insolence of power and religious bigotry, the Armada went forth to conquer and destroy. 20. Far different the temper of the English seamen ; far different the mission of the English fleet. There prevailed on board each vessel a spirit of patriotism \u2014 of earnest devotion to the Protestant faith, which, in its deeply-glowing enthusiasm and steadfast sincerity, was a more potent impulse than the fanaticism of the enemy. They loved their queen, their laws, their country, and, without loud or arrogant professions, were prepared to do much and suffer much in the holiest of all causes for which men can draw the sword. No greed of conquest, no lust of power, summoned the swift frigate or trim caravel from every creek and river to swell the fleet of the gallant Howard. The people of England, better even than their rulers, appreciated the importance of the issue which was now at stake ; though they may not have understood how vast an influence it would exercise upon the fortunes of the European nations and the mighty continent of America. But enough for them to know that they were about to fight for their \" hearths and homes,\" for the honour of their maidens, for the sanctity of their roof-trees, the purity of their church the justice of their"], [329, "i/EPARTURE OF THE ARMADA. 301 laws : for all that is dearest to free men \u2014 for liberty and Father land : \u2014 \" This royal throne of kings, this sceptred isle, This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars, This other Eden, demi-paradise; This fortress, built by Nature for herself, Against infection, and the hand of war ; This happy breed of men, this little world ; This precious stone set in the silver sea, Which serves it in the office of a wall, Or as a moat defensive to a house, Against the envy of less happier lands ; This blessed spot, this earth, this realm, this Engljm, Dear for her reputation through the world.\" 21. The Invincible Armada streamed out of the Tagus, with banners flying and trumpets clanging, on the 20th of May. 1588. It had already sustained a notable loss in the death of the veteran Admiral Santa Cruz, to whose skill and conduct its guidance had been entrusted. In spite of his most zealous endeavours, he had failed to satisfy the impetuosity of his impe rious master, who had harshly spurned him, with the words, \" You make an ill return for all my kindness to you.\" The veteran, already broken with fatigue, was stricken to the death by this cruel blow; and in his stead Philip appointed Alonzo Perez de Guzman, Duke of Medina Sidonia, one of the wealthiest of the grandees of Spain, but of no nautical experience or military ability. In these respects his deficiencies were supposed to be supplied by the skill and courage of his vice-admirals, Juan de Martinez Recalde of Biscay, and Miguel Orquendo of Guipuzcoa. 22. The Armada left the Tagus with the blare of trumpets, and amid the shouts of thousands who believed in its invin cibility. But before it got clear of the coast of Spain it was beset by a terrible gale, which buffeted it back into the ports of Biscay and Galicia. Reports of the damage it had sustained reached England, but with the wonted exaggeration of distance ; and the queen's government, misled by the intelligence, be lieved that the attack would now be postponed for another twelvemonth. The Lord Admiral happily was less prone to belief, and neglected the orders which reached him to dismantle his principal ships. It was not his design, however, to suffer them to rot in the ooze of Plymouth or Portsmouth. In concert with Drake he set sail for the coast of Spain, in the hope he"], [330, "302 DEFEAT OF THE SPANISH ARMADA. should surprise some portion of the Armada in Corunna; but the wind veering to the south, he, fearing lest the Spaniards should slip to sea unobserved, crowded on all sail for the entrance of the Channel, where he cruised for some time on the look-out for the enemy. But reports gaining ground of the inactivity of the Spaniards, and their losses from sickness, he gave up his watch and retired to Plymouth. It was about this time (July 12th) that the Armada, having been thoroughly refitted, again set sail from the Spanish coast, and consequently entered the Channel without let or hindrance from the English. Philip's instructions to its admiral were, to keep along the coast, avoiding a battle, if possible, until he could effect a junction with the fleet which Parma had collected off Calais. The com bined fleets would then be able to command the Channel, and escort the flotilla in which Parma and his veterans embarked to the English shore. Neither Philip nor his admiral appear to have been aware that Parma was blockaded in Dunkirk by a fleet of forty English and Dutch ships, under Lord Henry Seymour; or else concluded that the allies would instantly take to flight at the appearance of the imposing hosts of the Invin cible Armada. As the historian in Hakluyt observes : \u2014 \" It seemeth that the Duke of Parma and the Spaniards grounded upon a vain and presumptuous expectation, that all the ships of England and of the Low Countreys would at the first sight of the Spanish and Dunkerk navie have betaken themselves to flight, yielding them sea-room, and endeavouring only to defend themselves, their havens, and sea-coasts from invasion. Wherefore their intent and purpose was, that the Duke of Parma, in his small and flat-bottomed ships, should, as it were under the shadow and wings of the Spanish fleet, convey over all his troops, armour, and warlike provisions, and with their forces so united, should invade England ; or, while the English fleet were busied in fight against the Spanish, should enter upon any part of the coast which lie thought to be most convenient. Which invasion (as the captives afterwards confessed) the Duke of Parma thought first to have attempted by the river of Thames; upon the banks whereof, having at the first arivall landed twenty or thirty thousand of his principall souldiers, he supposed that he might easily have wonne the citie of London ; both because his small shippes should have followed and assisted"], [331, "A GROUP OF HEROES. 303 his land forces, and also for that the citie itselfe was but meanly fortified and easie to overcome, by reason of the citizens' deli cacie and discontinuance from the warres, who with continnall and constant labour, might be vanquished, if they yielded not at the first assault.\" 23. On the grassy ascent of Plymouth Hoe a famous group of worthies was assembled on the 19th of July, 1588, playing at bowls, the favourite pastime of the age. Let us gaze at them through the enchanted glass of the author of \"Westward Ho !\" \u2014 \" Those soft long eyes and pointed chin you recognise already ; they are Sir Walter Raleigh's. The fair young man in the flame-coloured doublet, whose arm is round Raleigh's neck, is Lord Sheffield ; opposite them stands, by the side of Sir Richard Grenville, a man as stately even as he, Lord Sheffield's uncle, the Lord Charles Howard of Effingham, Lord High Admiral of England ; next to him is his son-in-law, Sir Robert Southwell, captain of the Elizabeth Lonas ; but who is that short, sturdy, plainly-dressed man, who stands with legs a little apart, and hands behind his back, looking up with keen gray eyes into the face of each speaker ? His cap is in his hand, so you can see the bullet-head of crisp brown hair and the wrinkled forehead, as well as the high cheek-bones, the short square face, the broad temples, the thick lips, which are yet firm as granite. A coarse plebeian stamp of man; yet the whole figure and attitude are that of boundless determination, self-possession, energy ; and when at last he speaks a few blunt words, all eyes are turned respectfully upon him, for his name is Francis Drake. \" A burly grizzled elder, in greasy sea-stained garments, con trasting oddly with the huge gold chain about his neck, waddles up as if he had been born and had lived ever since in a gale of wind at sea. The upper half of his sharp, dogged visage seems of a brick-red leather, the lower of badger's fur ; and as he claps Drake on the back, and with a broad Devon twang shouts, ' Be you a-coming to drink your wine, Francis Drake, or be yon not?\u2014 saving your presence, my lord,' the Lord High Admiral only laughs, and bids Drake go and drink his wine ; for John Hawkins, Admiral of the Port, is the patriarch of Plymouth stamen, if Drake be their hero. \" So they push through the crowd, wherein is many another man whom one would gladly have spoken with, face to face, on"], [332, "304 DEFEAT OF THE SPANISH ARMADA. earth. Martin Frobisher and John Davis are sitting on that bench, smoking tobacco from long silver pipes ; and by them are Fenton and Withrington, who have both tried to follow Drake's path round the world, and failed, though by no fault of their own. The man who pledges them better luck next time, is George Turner \u2014 known to ' the seven Portugals,' \u2014 Leicester's pet, and captain of the galleon which Elizabeth bought of him. That short prim man, in the huge yellow ruff with sharp chin, minute imperial, and self-satisfied smile, is Richard Hawkins, the Complete Seaman, Admiral John's hereafter famous and hapless son. The elder who is talking with him is his good uncle William, whose monument still stands, or should stand, in Deptford church.\" 24. A signal-gun \u2014 a puff of smoke and a tongue of flame \u2014 and the sea-worthies turn their gaze seaward to mark a small armed vessel, dipping and bending as the wind fills all her spread of canvas, and running with the utmost speed into the harbour. Her captain lands, and makes his way to the place where the Lord-Admiral and his officers are standing. With due obeisance, he tells his short but pregnant tale. His name is Fleming, and his ship a privateer of Leith. This morning, when beating off the Cornish coast, he had descried the great Armada of Spain, coming down before the wind like a mighty array of clouds, and instantly had crowded on all sail to communicate with the English admiral. At the news many a sea captain grasps his ready hilt and hurries towards the shore, but Drake stops them with his genial laugh : \u2014 \" Let us play out our play ; there will be plenty of time to win the game, and beat the Spaniards too.\" The game is played out gallantly and steadily \u2014 the most memorable game that ever stirred the heart of an earnest player \u2014 and the last cast being thrown, Drake and his comrades leap into their boats, and row swiftly on board their respective ships. 25. The Duke of Medina Sidonia had deviated from his royal master's instructions, under the belief, into which he had been purposely deluded by the captain of an English trader, that he should surprise the English fleet lying, all supine and unpre pared, in Plymouth Sound. To destroy it at one fell swoop, and thus to become the virtual master of England without a struggle, was a prospect which naturally deceived the Spanish admiral's"], [333, "TACTICS OF THE ENGLISH ADMIRAL. 305 judgment. He had therefore made sail for Plymouth, unaware that England by this time was up in arms to greet the invaders with a freemen's welcome, and that her navy was marshalled by the most experienced seamen of the age, as well as by the best blood of the English chivalry. Lord Howard's ships had beat out of the Sound in the teeth of an obstinate wind, when, on the morning of the 20th, they beheld the immense armament of Spain, \" with lofty turrets, like castles, in front like a half moon ; the front thereof spreading about the length of seven miles, sailing very slowly, though with full sails, the winds being as it were weary with wafting them, and the ocean groaning under their weight.\" 26. They were suffered to sail past Plymouth with impunity, for, acting upon the wise counsels of Drake, the Lord High Admiral had determined to avoid a direct engagement with so preponderant a force ; but availing himself of the superior manageability of the English ships, and the superior skill of the English seamen, to hover upon its flanks and rear, to cut off stragglers, to obstruct its movements by desultory attacks, and perplex and dispirit the Spaniards by continuous but unexpected blows. The admiral's resolve did not satisfy some of the hotter and rasher spirits under his command, but its wisdom was recog nised by the cool and sagacious Raleigh : \u2014 \" Certainly,\" he says, \" he that will happily perform a fight at sea, must be skilful in making choice of vessels to fight in ; he must believe that there is more belonging to a good man-of-war upon the waters than great daring ; and must know that there is a great deal of difference between fighting loose or at large and grappling. The guns of a slow ship pierce as well, and make as great holes, as those in a swift. To clap ships together, without considera tion, belongs rather to a madman than to a man-of-war ; for by such an ignorant bravery was Peter Strossie lost at the Azores, when he fought against the Marquis of Santa Cruza. In like sort had the Lord Charles Howard, Admiral of England, been lost in the year 1588, if he had not been better advised, than a great many malignant fools were, that found fault with his demeanour. The Spaniards had an army aboard them, and he had none : they had more ships than he had, and of higher building and charging ; so that, had he entangled himself with those great and powerful vessels, he had greatly endangered this x"], [334, "306 DEFEAT OF THE SPANISH ARMADA. kingdom of England. For twenty men upon the defences are equal to a hundred that board and enter ; whereas then, contrari wise, the Spaniards had a hundred, for twenty of ours, to defend themselves withal. But our admiral knew his advantage, and held it ; which, had he not done, he had not been worthy to have held his head.\" 27. On the 21st of July, as the enormous battle struggled up the Channel, in sight of those fair green shores and fertile valleys, which already, in ignorant greed, had been portioned by its captains among themselves, Lord Howard of Effingham, \" sending a pinnace out before his fleet, called the Defiance, denounced war by discharging her ordnance ; and presently approaching within musket-shot, with much thundering out of his own ship, called the Ark-Royal, first set upon the admiral's \u2014 as he thought \u2014 of the Spaniards, but it was Alfonzo de Leon's ship. Soon after, Drake, Hawkins, and Frobisher played stoutly with their ordnance on the hindmost squadron, which was commanded by Recalde.\" After a two hours' fight, the Spaniards discovered the superiority of their opponents in dextrous movements and rapidity of fire. So Recalde's squadron made what haste it could to join the main body of the fleet, and the Admiral-Duke gathered his ships under his protection, as a hen collects her timorous fledglings under the shadow of her wing. 28. One of the four great \" galliasses\" is already riddled with shot, much to the disturbance of her internal arrangements, and the dismay of her monks and priests, who have thus early acquired a wholesome terror of the force of \" Protestant arguments.\" The Armada gathers rapidly round her, or Drake and Hawkins will sink her ; and in effecting this man\u0153uvre, the \" principal galleon of Seville,\" which bears Pedro de Valdez, and much of the angre azul of Spain, runs foul of her neighbour, carries away her foremast, and consequently, in spite of Spanish chivalry, is abandoned to her fate. This surely is an indifferent omen for the Invincible Armada ; for if it fare so ill against but a third of the Plymouth fleet, what fortune will it count when Howard's force is augmented by the forty belated vessels who now are making their masts to bend like reeds, in the hot endeavour to overtake their admiral ? The next day, Drake's quick eye discovers the dismantled"], [335, "307 DON PEDRO DE VALDEZ. and lagging galleon of Seville, and straightway despatches a pinnace to bid her yield. But Valdez \u2014 to adapt the words of Speed \u2014 to seem valorous, answers, that they are 450 strong ; that he himself is Don Pedro ; and that upon his honour he must propound certain conditions. Drake's reply is very swift and curt : he has no leisure to parley. If the Don will yield, let him presently do it ; if not, he shall soon prove that Drake is no dastard. Whereupon, Pedro, hearing that it is the \" fiery Drake\" \u2014 ever terrible to the Spaniards \u2014 who has him in chace, takes with him forty of his principal men, and goes on board the English ship; where, first giving him the conge, he protests that he, and all his, were resolved to die in defence, had they not fallen under his power. Then he salutes the English hero with a most stately bow, \u2014 have they not fallen under the power of him whose valour and felicity are so great, that Mars and Neptune seem to attend him in his attempts, and whose gene rous mind towards the vanquished, his greatest foes have often times experienced ? The bluff Drake responds to these punctilious Castilian courtesies with frank English heartiness ; places Don Pedro at his own table, and lodges him in his own cabin. The officers and men he forthwith sends into Plymouth, where they remained eighteen months, until their ransoms were paid, but Drake's sea-dogs, meanwhile, abundantly recompensed them selves with the spoil of the great galleon, sharing among them some 55,000 ducats of bright Mexican gold. 29. On the second day (July 22), there was no fighting, but the flag-ship of the Vice-Admiral Miguel d'Oquenda, having been set on fire by her gunner, a Hollander, who had small sympathy with the Pope, and less with Philip of Spain, she suffered so severely, that she was in imminent danger of foun dering. Her crew and treasure were removed to another vessel, and the galleon being turned adrift, was seized by Lord Thomas Howard and Captain Hawkins, and towed into VYeymouth. On the third day (July 23), the Armada was off the chalky bluff of Portland, the English fleet still hanging on its rear, like a cloud on a mountain top. The wind veering to the north, the Spaniards turned at bay and faced their pursuers, as if to make for the Needles, and both fleets accomplished a series of man\u0153uvres to obtain the weather-gage. About noon the English got between their enemy and the land, and bore x 2"], [336, "308 DEFEAT OF THE SPANISH ARMADA. down upon him right before the wind. Then began a confused but desperate fight, continued with variable fortune. For while, on the one hand, \" the English manfully rescued the ships of London, which were hemmed in by the Spaniards ; so, on the other side, the Spaniards as stoutly delivered Recalde, being in danger. Never was heard such thundering of ordnance on both sides, which, notwithstanding, from the Spaniards flew for the most part over the English without harm. One Mr. Cook, or Cope, was the only Englishman that died bravely in the midst of his enemies, commanding his own ship. The reason was, that the English ships were moved and managed with such agility, giving their broadsides to the larger and more unwieldy of the enemy, and sheering off again just as they pleased, while the Spanish heavy ships lay as so many butts for the English to fire at. This was the most furious and bloody skirmish of all, in which the Lord Admiral fighting amidst his enemies' fleet, and seeing one of his captains [George Fenner] afar off, cried, ' O George, what doest thou ? Wilt thou now frustrate my hope and opinion conceived of thee ? Wilt thou forsake me now?' With which words he being inflamed, approached, and did the part of a most valiant captain.\" 30. The morning of the 24th found both fleets off the extre mity of the fair Isle of Wight ; the English constantly receiving accessions from every creek, and port, and harbour, of goodly vessels, equipped at the cost of England's leading men ; her Raleighs and her Carews, her Cumberlands, Oxfords, and Northumberlands. It was now that the Lord Admiral divided his force into four squadrons, of one of which he himself took command, entrusting the others to famous Drake, sturdy John Hawkins and the daring Frobisher. Some small vessels were despatched to Portsmouth for ammunition, and the day went down in silence, for the wind had sunk to a dead calm, and the two fleets only drifted with the tide. 31. The 25th was St. James's Day \u2014 the day sacred to the patron saint of Spain, Jago of Compostella. Shall nothing in his honour be attempted by the descendants of those whom the saint, mounted on snow-white steed, so often led against the Paynim rout ? It was decided that the galleys should adventure an attack, and in their van three of the four great galliasses \u2014 the fourth lay sorely damaged among the fleet \u2014 should move in"], [337, "FOUR TRUSTY KNIGHTS. 309 stately pomp, \" thrashing the sea to foam with three hundred oars a-piece.\" Nothing loth, the English advanced to meet them, but as the calm still brooded on the sea, their boats towed slowly into action \u2014 Lord Howard's Triumph, his brother's ship, the Lion, Southwell's Elizabeth Jonas, Lord Sheffield's Bear, Barker's Victory, and George Fenner's Leicestei \u2014 deli vering such furious discharges of chain-shot, that had not the wind risen about noon, and the Spanish fleet come up to the assistance of the galleys, they must needs have been captured. And thus the fight became general, the English showing so resolute a bravery, that after that day \" no galliasse would adventure to fight.\" And so \u2014 to quote the words of Kingsley \u2014 the fight thunders on the live-long afternoon, beneath the virgin cliffs of Fresh water ; while myriad sea-fowl rise screaming up from every ledge, and spot with their black wings the snow-white wall of chalk ; and the lone shepherd hurries down the slopes above to peer over the dizzy edge, and forgets the wheat-ear fluttering in bis snare, while he gazes trembling upon glimpses of tall masts and gorgeous flags, piercing at times the league-broad veil of sulphur smoke which welters far below. 32. The 26th of July was a tranquil summer day ; a g'ow was in the heavens above, a splendour slept upon the sea 1 el >w. The Duke of Medina took advantage of the pause to send a messenger to Calais, praying the Prince of Parma to despatch to his aid forty small vessels capable of contending with the light and nimble craft of the English. On the other hand, the Lord Howard and his vice-admirals decided to make no further assault upon the enemy, until reinforced off Dover by Lord Henry Seymour's ships. Then, in grateful recognition of sur passing devotion and unequalled courage, the Lord High Admiral conferred the honour of knighthood upon Lord Shef field, Lord Thomas Howard, Roger Townsend, Martin Frobisher, and John Hawkins ; the latter of whom did, after the sword had smitten his shoulder, rise up, and exclaim, \" Truly, my old woman will hardly know herself again when folks call her My Lady!' 33. The following day (July 27) the tw-o hostile fleets arrived in the Calais Roads, where the English received the welcome reinforcement of the greater part of Lord Henry Seymour's"], [338, "310 DEFEAT OF THE SPANISH ARMADA. squadron. The Prince of Parma now imagined that his oppor tunity was come ; but the Dutch manned some thirty-two strong war-ships, with a considerable force of soldiers on board. and these and the remainder of Lord Henry Seymour's vessels, stoutly blockaded the Flemish ports. Still, as the Prince was resolute to effect a junction, it became necessary for the English to act upon the offensive. The attempt, nevertheless, was not without hazard, for the Armada lay off Calais, with the largest ships stationed outside, like a formidable range of batteries pro tecting a garrisoned citadel. The 29th was the Sabbath \u2014 a day of anxious suspense to all true English hearts, inflamed as they necessarily were by bitter recollections of the fires of Smithfield, the massacre of St. Bartho lomew's, the slaughter in the valleys of the Vaudois \u2014 horrors which even at this long interval of time affect men's minds with painful emotions ; and when the night came, the English admiral, at the suggestion, it is said, of the Queen, sent eight fire ships into the midst of the hostile fleet \u2014 eight ships besmeared with wild-fire, brimstone, pitch, and rosin; the ordnance charged with treble supplies of stones and bullets ; gallantly steered before the wind by two brave captains, Young and Prowse! No marvel that their appearance struck a terrible panic among the Armada. Shrieks, oaths, reproaches, prayers, made night hideous ! Ship after ship, they cut their cables, crowded on the bending masts a press of sail, and in dread confusion staggered out to sea. Vainly the Admiral-Duke endeavoured to arouse his men to fresh exertions, and sought to re-assemble his scattered fleet. All was over. The stake had been played and lost. He ran up Channel to collect his fugitive vessels ; but was hotly followed by Drake and Fenner, who in their turn found close at their heels Fenton and Southwell, Cross, Burton, and Raynor, the Lord Admiral, Lord Thomas Howard, and Lord Sheffield. Fiercer fights ensued, wherein the Spaniards suffered in men, vessels, honour. 34. The Spanish, gotten together as best they might, were driven past Dunkirk by the English, and out of the reach of the discomfited Prince of Parma. Not but what the disproportion of force was still enormous. \" Howbeit,\" says the old annalist, \" there were many excellent and warlike ships in the English fleet, yet scarce were there twenty -two or twenty-three among"], [339, "PROGRESS OF THE FIGHT. 311 them all, which matched ninety of the Spanish ships in bigness, or could conveniently assault them. Wherefore, the English ships using their prerogative of nimble steerage whereby they could turn and wield themselves with the wind which way they listed, came oftentimes very near upon the Spaniards, and charged them so sore, that now and then they were but a pike's length asunder : and so continually giving them one broadside after another, they discharged all their shot both great and small upon them, spending one whole day from morning till night in that violent kind of conflict, until such time as powder and bullets failed them. In regard of which want they thought it convenient not to pursue the Spaniards any longer, because they had many great vantages of the English, namely, for the extraordinary bigness of their ships, and also for that they were so neerley conjoyned, and kept together in so good array, that they could by no meanes be fought withall one to one. The English thought, therefore, that they had right well acquitted themselves, in chasing the Spaniards first from Callis, and then from Dunkerk and by that meanes to have hindered them from joyning with the Duke of Parma his forces, and getting the wind of them, to have driven them from their own coasts. \" The Spaniards that day sustained great loss and damage, having many of their shippes shot thorow and thorow, and they discharged likewise great store of ordinance against the English; who, indeed, sustained some hindrance, but not com parable to the Spaniard's loss : for they lost not any one ship or person of account, for very diligent inquisition being made, the Englishmen all that tyme wherein the Spanish navy sayled upon their seas are not found to have wanted above one hundred of their people : albeit Sir Francis Drake's ship was pierced with shot above forty times, and his very cabben was twice shot thorow, and about the conclusion of the fight, the bed of a certain gentleman lying weary thereupon was taken quite from under him with the force of a bullet. Likewise as the Earl of Northumberland and Sir Charles Blunt were at dinner upon a time, the bullet of a demy-culveryn brake thorow the middest of their cabben, touched their feet, and strooke downe two of the standers by, with many such accidents befalling the English shippes, which it were tedious to rehearse.\" 35. Thus was England saved in the year of grace, 1588. The"], [340, "312 DEFEAT OF THE SPANISH ARMADA. Armada never again made head against its pursuers. Through the narrow seas, and along the coast of Scotland, the Spaniards took their way as best they might, the English still adhering immoveably to their rear, until, on the 2nd of August, recalled to watch the Prince of Parma. The Lord Admiral and Drake maintained the pursuit a little while longer, but abandoned it when the Armada reached the boisterous seas of the North. It had then to contend with the storm and the ocean \u2014 enemies so fatal, that of the stately armament which had left the shores of Spain in such pomp and pride, only fifty-three shattered vessels returned to port. 36. The failure of his life's grand scheme was borne by Philip with tolerable equanimity; he returned to his cabinet to weave new intrigues and plan fresh projects of dominion. But the discomfiture was so complete that the Spanish court vainly endeavoured to hide its disgrace from Europe. The misrepre sentations in which for this purpose it indulged were boldly exposed by Drake, whose statement contains a remarkably comprehensive view of the entire struggle. \" It was happily manifested,\" he says, \" in very deed to all nations, how their navy, which they termed invincible, consisting of 140 sail of ships, not only of their own kingdom, but strengthened with the greatest argosies, Portugal carracks, Florentines, and large hulks of other countries, were by thirty of her Majesty's own ships of war, and a few of our own merchants, by the wise, valiant, and advantageous conduct of the Lord Charles Howard, High Admiral of England, beaten and shuffled together even from the Lizard in Cornwall, first to Portland, where they shamefully left Don Pedro de Valdez, with his mighty ship ; from Portland to Calais, where they lost Hugh de Mon cado, with the galleys of which he was captain ; and from Calais, driven with squibs from their anchors, were chased out of the sight of England, round about Scotland and Ireland. Where, for the sympathy of their religion, hoping to find succour and assistance, a great part of them were crushed against the rocks, and those others that landed, being very many in number, were, notwithstanding, broken, slain, and taken ; and so sent from village to village, coupled in halters, to be shipped into England, when her Majesty, of her princely and invincible disposition disdaining to put them to death, and scorning either"], [341, "313 GREAT JOY IN ENGLAND. to retain or entertain them, they were all sent back again to their countries, to witness and recount the worthv achieve ment of their invincible and dreadful navy, \u2014 of which the number of soldiers, the fearful burthen of their ships, the commanders' names of squadron, with all others, their magazines of provision, were put in print, as an army and navy irresistible and disdain ing prevention : with all which their great and terrible ostenta tion, they did not in all their sailing round about England so much as sink or take one ship, bark, pinnace, or cock-boat of ours, or even burn so much as one sheep-cote on this land.\" 37. Great was the joy of English hearts at the total discom fiture of the invading force. Men could calmly look their wives and children in the face, assured that their lives and honour were no longer in peril. Cheerily rang the chimes from every village-tower, for no longer was there fear of Pope or Inquisi tion. The land breathed again, as one breathes when suddenly rescued from an imminent hazard. In every church ascended a solemn thanksgiving to the Lord of Hosts ; and at the metro politan cathedral of St. Paul's, the Queen herself gave thanks in regal state ; and \" with her own princely voice she most christianly exhorted the people to do the same : whereunto the people, with a loud acclamation, wishedher amost long andhappy life, to the confusion of her foes.\" Several medals were struck in commemoration of this glorious event, which had delivered England and all Protestant Europe from the tyranny of Rome. One recorded the Queen's admirable suggestion of the fire-ships, and bore the inscription, Dux F\u0153mina Facli. Another was engraved, Venit, Vidit, Fugit, in pleasant parody of C\u00e6sar's famous saying ; a third, Deus ajfiavit, et dissipantur ; and a ,'ourth, Impius fugit, nemine sequente."], [342, "CHRONOLOGICAL LINKS BETWEEN THE DEFEAT OF THE SPANISH ARMADA AND THE BATTLE OF LUTZEN.

For the reader to understand the causes and conse quences of the battle of Liitzen, it will be necessary to preface our description with an explanation of the origin of the Thirty Years' War. That a period so important and so interesting should largely have occupied the attention of historians, is not a matter of astonishment. It stands out from the general course of Euro pean history with peculiar distinctness ; complete in itself, though linked with the times which went before and the times which succeeded it ; the principal picture in a series of wonderful and varied tableaux. AU Europe was affected by its fierce emotions. The rush of the war was felt on the banks of the Bkine as well as on those of the Vistnla. Its thunder woke the echoes of the German forests, and disturbed the silence of the vineyards of France ; nay, it aroused the attention of the remote islands of Great Britain, and sounded loud above the din of civil discord. It afforded a glorious theatre for the actions of two remarkable heroes \u2014 Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, and Wallenstein Duke"], [344, "316 BATTLE OF LUTZEN. of Friedland. It was commenced by a treaty, and concluded by a treaty. It had both a religious and a political character, for not only was it identified with the struggle of Protestantism and Papacy, but with the resistance of the free nations of the North against the overwhelming preponderance of the House of Austria. It was the last appearance of the spirit of chivalry on the scene \u2014 the last great strife in which the force of individual character influenced the progress of events. Henceforth Euro pean polity assumed a new aspect, and obeyed different laws. 2. We have detailed in preceding chapters the gradual growth of the Reformed Religion, and the development of its influence upon the relations of European nations. But while it materially modified the position of one country towards another, while it raised some into novel importance and prostrated others into unexpected abasement, it would be unfair to forget how vast a change it produced in the relations of the governed and the governing, and how completely it broke down the absolutism of kings, and established the independence of peoples. Free inquiry in religion necessarily finds a sequence and comple ment in free inquiry in politics. The mind which begins by disputing the authority of an ecclesiastical superior will readily direct itself to an examination of the prerogatives of its secular ruler, and an impatience of the tyranny of the Church begets an intolerance of the oppression of the Crown. The Thirty Years' War was the great agency in working out European freedom. It overturned the old landmarks, encroached upon the prescrip tions of arbitrary power, awakened the intellect of the masses, and shattered the prejudices of antiquity. The spirit of inde pendence which it stimulated shot its subtle fire through all the arteries and veins of Europe. It manifested itself in England; it animated the Scandinavian kingdoms ; and it promoted the liberty of nations, by shaking the arrogance and circumscribing the temporal power of the Church of Rome. 3. The Protestant Confession of Faith, presented to the Emperor Charles V., while presiding at the Diet of Augsburg, in 1530, and thenceforth known as the \" Confession of Augs burg,\" was signed by three electoral princes, twenty dukes and princes of the empire, twenty- four counts and barons, and by the deputies of thirty-five imperial free towns \u2014 so vast was the pro gress already accomplished by the doctrines of Luther. It met"], [345, "THE GOVERNORS AND THE GOVERNED. 317 with but little favour from the astute emperor, whose power was mainly derived from countries where Protestantism had found no acceptance, and who was sagacious enough to perceive that the Papacy was the great support and succour of absolute sove reigns. The Protestant princes accordingly united to defend the principles they had professed, and assert their independence of the Church of Rome. They formed the Smalcaldic League, which at once enabled them to oppose the aggressive policy of the House of Austria and extend the principles of the Reforma tion. The former object mainly actuated the governing classes, but the masses of the people, who care little for abstract politics, and have no foresight for distant dangers, were bound to the common cause only by their religious enthusiasm, by their attachment to Lutheranism, and their hatred of the Papacy. \" Their attachment was ardent,\" says Schiller, \" their hatred invincible. Religious fanaticism anticipates even the remotest perils. Enthusiasm never calculates its sacrifices. What the most pressing dangers of the state could not effect with the citizens, was accomplished by pious zeal. Few would have drawn the sword for state or prince ; but for religion, the mer chant and the artist and the peasant flew to arms with cheerful alacrity. For state or prince the smallest additional tax would have been rejected ; but for religion the people staked at once their lives, their fortunes, and their worldly hopes. It swelled threefold the contributions which poured into the exchequer of the princes, and the armies which they led to the field ; and, in the glow of excitement felt by every mind during the perils which menaced their faith, the pressure was not perceived of those burdens and privations which in colder moments would have appeared intolerable. The terrors of the Spanish Inquisition, and the horrors of St. Bartholomew's, obtained for the Prince of Orange, the Admiral Coligni, Elizabeth of England, and the Protestant chiefs of Germany, supplies of men and money from their subjects, to a degree which at present is inconceivable.\" 4. On the other hand, the House of Austria, in this great struggle, was actuated by motives scarcely less powerful in ren dering easy the most amazing sacrifices. It was bound to the see of Rome by its very possession of the imperial crown. It derived no inconsiderable part of its influence from the support of Spain, where the Roman Catholics were animated by the"], [346, "318 BATTLE OF LtJTZEN. fiercest fanaticism. Its hold upon Germany depended upon its crushing out Protestantism. Its rivalry of France in Italy could only be successful by its zealous advocacy of the Roman Church. Ambitious to reproduce the vast imperial system of Charlemagne, it saw with indignation the rise of a religious creed which threat ened to break up Europe into several independent polities, and to promote the growth of a spirit of freedom antagonistic to the concentration of a preponderant power. Thus, by a variety of circumstances, the interests of Rome and Austria became so closely identified that the latter began to be universally regarded as the very pillars of the Papal see. 5. The immense resources of Austria were at first too power ful for the Protestant princes, and the Smalcaldic League was annihilated by the battle of Miihlberg (a.d. 1547). It seemed that the liberties of Germany had perished on that field for ever ; that Austria had won an indisputable supremacy over trembling Europe. But, in the hour of defeat, the cause of liberty derived a fresh accession of strength from an event tbe most unexpected. Maurice of Saxony abandoned the imperial side, and strove for that freedom of Germany which he had hitherto opposed with so resolute a hatred. After a brief but obstinate struggle, the emperor was glad to subscribe the Treaty of Passau, and concede to the Protestants the free exercise of their religion ; a privi lege w-hich was duly confirmed to them, in 1555, by the Diet of Augsburg. This first acknowledgment of the Protestant States is historically known as the \" Religious Pacification of Augsburg,\" but it left so many points of importance unsettled, particularly as regarded the appropriation of the property of the Church seized by the Protestant princes, that it could evidently serve but a temporary purpose, and was rather a truce than a' peace. 6. Charles V. was succeeded as Emperor of Germany (a.d. 1557) by his brother Ferdinand, who also obtained the crown of Hungary and Bohemia, partly by treaty and partly by elec tion. During his brief reign religious strife was silent, and the Peace of Augsburg remained unbroken. He was followed in his mild and pacific policy by his son Maximilian IL, who ascended the imperial throne in 1 564, and whose tolerant spirit prevented any renewal of religious animosities. The resistance he was constrained to offer to the attacks of the Turks required"], [347, "319 CONDITION OF THE GERMAN EMPIRE. the entire resources of the empire, and made the Protestants as necessary to him as the Catholics. But, apart from political considerations, he showed the adherents of the new religion so extreme an indulgence that it may reasonably be supposed he was himself inclined towards its tenets. He died, however, in 1575, and his son Rodolph, who had been educated almost entirely under the eye of his mother, a severe partisan of the Roman Church, neglected to pursue the wise and liberal system of government bequeathed to him by his father's example. During the early part of his reign the influence of Maximilian's wisdom preserved the peace of the empire undisturbed, and left Rodolph to the quiet prosecution of his favourite studies \u2014 astronomy and alchemy, arch\u00e6ology and chemistry. Thus he was constantly under two fatal influences \u2014 a belief in astrological follies, and the evil counsels of the Jesuits, by whom he was completely governed. He neglected his dominions until they slipped from his grasp. The Austrian states threw off their allegiance ; Hungary and Transylvania revolted ; Bohemia soon followed their example. Making common cause against the common enemy, Hungary was on the point of forming a league with Protestant Moravia and Bohemia, when Rodolph's younger brother, Matthias, alarmed by the perils which menaced the Austrian house, suddenly made his appearance on the scene of action. By skilful diplomatic action he saved the remnant of Hungary from the Turks, and restored the connection between the Hungarian rebels and the imperial crown. Promising tole ration to the Protestants of Austria and Moravia, they joined his standard, and Matthias, virtually sovereign of Hungary, Austria, and Moravia, then marched into Bohemia, to seize the emperor in his palace, and strip him of the imperial purple. 7. To meet the impending storm, Rodolph, for the first time for many years, convoked the Bohemian Diet at Prague, and purchased the aid of the Bohemians against his rebellious brother by conceding to them the privileges they demanded. But he referred religious matters to the next Diet, which he undertook to hold when peace was re-established. The weak sovereign had scarcely gone thus far, and the Bohemians were girding on their swords and saddling their steeds for the battle, when, alarmed at the dependent position in which he had placed him self towards the Diet, he suddenly effected a reconciliation with"], [348, "320 BATTLE OF LUTZEN. his brother, resigning to him by a formal act of abdication the territories which Matthias already possessed \u2014 Hungary and Austria, and appointing him as his successor to the crown of Bohemia. 8. The Diet met again in 1609, and demanded the free exer cise of their religion, a Consistory of their own, the cession of the University of Prague to the Protestants, and the right of electing Defenders or Protectors of liberty. They were met by a refusal. Nothing daunted, they proceeded to action ; declared universal toleration to be established; nominated thirty Defen ders, and prepared to raise an organised military force under Count Thurn. The vacillating emperor now gave way and signed what was called a Letter of Majesty, granting to the refractory Diet every privilege it had demauded, and divesting himself of all but the shadow of power. Soon afterwards an attempt which he made to divert the succession of the Bohemian crown to the Archduke Leopold, aroused the wrath of Matthias, who invaded Bohemia, was joined by the whole strength of the Protestants, and compelled the emperor to abdicate the Bohe mian throne, leaving him little but the imperial title to remind him of the power and glory he had lost through his feeble bigotry. Matthias was crowned King of Bohemia at Prague. Having sworn at the altar, with his hand on an open Bible, to maintain the Letter of Majesty granted by Rodolph, the Lord Marshal of the Empire addressed the deputies of states and the assembled people, inquiring, \" Is it your will and pleasure that his Majesty's Grace shall be crowned?\" \"It is our will,\" shouted the multitude, and the ceremony proceeded, after this signal manifestation of the popular influence. 9. Having no children the Emperor Matthias adopted Fer dinand of Griltz, Archduke of Carniola and Styria, his successor on the Bohemian throne ; but as he was a disciple of the Jesuits and a rigid Catholic, the people w-ould not acknowledge or crown him until he had signed a \" reverse,\" releasing them from their allegiance if he infringed any of those rights which his coronation oath would call upon him to maintain. Ferdinand complied, and was crowned, but he had no intention of keeping his solemn promise, and by violating the compact so sacredly made, became the author of the Thirty Years' War. 10. In the \"Letter of Majesty\" wrung from the reluctant"], [349, "321 OUTBREAK IN BOHEMIA. hand of the Emperor Rodolph, and confirmed by Matthias and Ferdinand, occurred this stipulation : \u2014 \" that the Protestants should have the full right to build new schools and churches, not only in the towns, but in the country also.\" The citizens of Prague acting upon this privilege had raised several religious edifices, but now, when the congregations of Brunau and Klos tergraben were about to consecrate their new churches, the Catholic clergy violently seized them \u2014 by order, as they de clared, of the emperor. The Lutherans immediately laid a formal complaint before the Lords of the Council, who repre sented the emperor at Prague ; but instead of obtaining redress their deputies were flung into prison. The Protestant members of the estates then assembled in the capital, addressed a vigo rous but respectful remonstrance to Matthias, which the Jesuit voices of Vienna, and the fatal influence of Ferdinand, induced him to reject with contemptuous harshness. On the 22nd of May, 1618, the Protestant deputies were summoned before the Council at Prague, to receive the imperial reply. It was couched in peculiarly offensive terms : \u2014 \" His Imperial Majesty had, for good and sufficient reasons, deemed it right to command that the church of Branau should be closed, and that of Klostergraben destroyed. His Imperial Majesty was of opinion that the states had abused the charter, and that the deputies had rendered themselves liable to punishment as rebels and traitors.\" 11. In a state of great excitement the Protestant nobles then in Prague assembled at the house of their acknowledged leader, Count Henry Thurn, a bold, impetuous, and able spirit, who had received a personal slight from the Viennese court, and was thus impelled to action by pride as well as patriotism. He employed his eloquence in fanning the flame which had already been excited by the emperor's haughty injustice, and especially turned the current of the popular wrath against two of the most prominent of the lords of the council, Slavata, and Baron Martinez, whose bigotry and prejudice a long series of violent acts had made conspicuous. Having resolved to inform the council that \" after the signature of the Great Charter by the emperor, no order or decree, tending to endanger the liberties of the Protestant religion, could be received or obeyed,\" the principal Protestant nobles were appointed to this duty \u2014 Counts Henry and Matthias Thurn, Joachim, Andreas and Alboni of Y"], [350, "BATTLE OF LUTZEN. 322 Schlisk ; the Lords William of Lobkowitz, Wenzel of Rau powna, Koln of Fels, and Paul of Reiczan. They proceeded to the castle on the following morning (May 23), in full armour, and accompanied by throngs of armed men, loudly demanding vengeance. They had previously agreed that the two obnox ious councillors, Martinez and Slavata, should be sent away, and by force if suasion failed. Nevertheless, at first the dis cussion was conducted with calmness ; and the president, Count Adam of Sternberg, was heard in respectful silence. \"But with you,\" suddenly exclaimed Lord Koln, frowning upon Slavata and Martinez, \" with you we can never agree, for you are traitors to the liberties of the country.\" Martinez angrily returned defiance for defiance, until interrupted by the impetuous Wenzel of Raupowna, who cried aloud, \" Wherefore all this delay ? Let them be flung out of the window, according to the good old Bohemian manner.\" 12. This was the spark that fired the latent elements of com motion. A cheer arose from the excited multitude, who had pressed into the council-chamber close upon the footsteps of the deputies. Their friends hurried Sternberg aud another into an adjoining chamber, but Martinez was instantly seized, and flung from a window into the castle moat, some eighty feet beneath. Slavata followed, and their creature and secretary Fabricius was thrown after them. \" The fox's tail must follow the head,\" cried the Bohemians, as the poor wretch trembled in their grasp. 13. It happened, however, that neither of the victims of the popular fury was much injured by his fall. Martinez alighted on a mound of rubbish, the collected produce of some repairs, and escaped with a few contusions. Slavata, rolling off it, struck his head against the iron bars of the castle vaults, and received a severe cut. Fabricius was so little hurt that, it is said, he politely begged pardon of Martinez for falling upon his excellency. Nor were they the worse for the musket shots fired after them. Martinez and Slavata were helped by some ser vants into the house of the Countess of Lobkowitz, and succeeded in effecting their escape in due time from Prague. Fabricius set out on the road to Vienna to report what had happened, before his flight was discovered. 14. The morning's bitter reflections always follow the mid night's mad excesses ; and the deputies speedily recovered from"], [351, "ARMED, AND ON THE WATCH! 323 their excitement to understand the magnitude of the evils which their rashness had entailed upon their country. To retrace the false step as far as might be, they despatched ambassadors to Vienna with their humble apology and justification, but mean time, at the instigation of Count Thurn, took measures to protect themselves, if instead of winning the imperial clemency they fell under the weight of the imperial wrath. A council of thirty of the most distinguished of their body was entrusted with the administration of civil and military affairs. They occupied with persons they could trust the principal offices of state, and seized upon the imperial revenues. The royal functionaries and the army were taken into their own service, and an animated pro clamation called upon all Bohemia to strike for the common cause. The Archbishop of Prague, the Abbot of Brunau, and some of the most active and mischievous of the Catholic clergy, were banished the kingdom. The Jesuits were summarily expelled with every mark of contumely. Alliances were con tracted with Silesia and Lusatia, and messengers were despatched to solicit the help of the Protestant states of Germany. Thus, armed and on the watch, Bohemia awaited the reply of the Imperial Court. 15. The Emperor Matthias was not now the daring and in trepid prince who had wrested the crowns of Germany and Bohemia from the feeble Rodolph, and was disinclined to pro voke a war which might spread throughout the whole of his unsettled dominions. He therefore issued a manifesto to the Bohemians, declaring his resolution to observe the stipulations of the Letter of Majesty, and exhorting them to lay down their arms. It was with evident reluctance that he obeyed the reiterated counsels of the bigoted Ferdinand, and collected an army as a commentary upon his manifesto. But driven by the force of events, impelled by a current of rage and prejudice which overbore all political considerations, he soon found himself engaged in hostilities. Spain sent gold and troops to support the new Crusade, and two foreign soldiers were placed in com mand of the imperial forces \u2014 Count Bucquoi as generalissimo, and Count Dampierre as second. They entered Bohemia, and wherever they moved the sword and the torch did their bar barous work. Outraged women, murdered children, old men cruelly tortured, flaming cottages and plundered villages, these Y 2"], [352, "324 BATTLE OF LUTZEN. were the marks of the imperial clemency as noted with fierce indignation by the Bohemian insurgents. In vain, therefore, the emperor sent repeated messages of a pacific tendency to the Estates. The blood of Bohemia was aroused, and it made ready for a desperate resistance. Nor was it the less resolute in its determination when Moravia espoused its cause, and Co_nt Mansfeld hastened from Germany to head its soldiers, and brought a reinforcement of 4,000 men. Acting under the orders of a confederation of Protestant states \u2014 now known as the \" Evangelic Union,\" in opposition to the \" Catholic League \" \u2014 he suddenly entered Bohemia, and the emperor's first knowledge of his movements was derived from his seizure of Pilsen, a Roman Catholic town, strongly fortified, and notorious for its loyalty to the imperial cause. 16. It was at this unfavourable juncture that the Emperor Matthias died (March 20, 1618), and Ferdinand of Gratz suc ceeded to his troubled inheritance. With Matthias, the reigning line of the German House of Austria was, so to speak, extinct, for of all Maximilian's sons only one survived, the feeble and childless Archduke Albert, in the Netherlands, who had already renounced his claims in favour of the line of Gratz. The Spanish House had also resigned, by a secret compact, its pretensions to the imperial crown. Thus, in the Archduke Ferdinand the branch of Hapsburg was about to put forth new shoots, and the former greatness of Austria to experience a renewal ; though his reign commenced in clouds and shadows which seemed to betoken a stormy and inauspicious career. 17. His succession to the imperial dignity, however, did not secure the crown of Bohemia, and Ferdinand perceived that if he would wear it, he must either win it by the sword, or pur chase it by the sacrifice of every prerogative he valued. The outlook was one of peril and despondency. Silesia, Moravia, Bohemia were in revolt ; the Transylvanians, under Prince Bethlem Gabor, threatened an invasion ; Austria wavered on the threshold of rebellion ; one half of Germany openly encouraged the insurgents ; the other half showed no active sympathy with their emperor. From success to success marched on the rebels, until they beleagured him in Vienna, and flight or absolute submission seemed his only alternatives. But what fate is it that always watches over the House of Austria, and at the last"], [353, "ELIZABETH OF BOHEMIA. 325 moment extricates it from the consequences of its own folly ? When the fall of the dynasty appeared a matter of probability, a regiment of Dampierre's cuirassiers suddenly rode into Vienna. A body of infantry followed, and news arriving that the Flemish general Bucquoi was marching upon Prague, the Bohemians broke up their camp before Vienna, and hastened to the defence of their own capital. 18. Relieved from this urgency of peril, Ferdinand proceeded to Frankfort to celebrate the ceremony of his coronation as Emperor of Germany. But at this very time the Diet of Prague declared him an enemy to the Bohemian religion and liberties, pronounced the throne vacant, and elected, in the place of Ferdinand, the Elector Palatine Frederick V., the husband of the beautiful and accomplished Elizabeth, daughter of James I. He was a man of a dreamy temperament, of a free and liberal spirit, and refined scholarly tastes, but in no wise fitted to wear a crown that could only be protected by a strong arm and a stout heart. Urged by his beautiful wife and his Calvinistic counsellors, he unhappily accepted the crown which proved for him a veritable crown of thorns. The day opened in sunshine, but the storm-clouds speedily gathered. The Catholic League sent all its forces to the assistance of Ferdinand. Bethlem Gabor and his Transylvanians were totally defeated by Bucquoi and the celebrated Wallenstein, who then turned their united arms upon hapless Bohemia, and crushed the Bohemian army under the wallB of Prague, on the 8th of November, 1620. King Frederick and his wife escaped from the city by night, and the next day Prague surrendered to the victors. Ferdinand was once more King of Bohemia, and signalised his triumph by a succession of intolerable cruelties. 19. Some minds are better fitted to endure adversity than prosperity, which throws them off their balance, and prompts them to essay injudicious and perilous adventures. Ferdinand was now supreme master of all the dominions of the House of Austria, enjoying a wider reach of power than had been per mitted to his ancestors. With this brilliant position he could not be content. Dissatisfied with victory he lusted for ven geance, and instead of dismissing the armies of the League, he poured them into the Palatinate to ruin his recent rival. Tilly effected its subjugation ; but the Protestant States, again roused"], [354, "326 BATTLE OF LCTZEN. into alarm by the aggressive policy of the Imperial House, assembled an army of 60,000 men, entered into an alliance with Denmark, and solicited the aid of England in their attempt to confine the Roman Catholic power within reasonable limits. Tilly and his Bavarians entered Lower Germany to chastise the presumption of the States, but found in the King of Den mark an able general, and in the Danes intrepid soldiers, who permitted him to make but a tardy progress. The long-continued hostilities in which the emperor had been involved had so exhausted his resources that he was compelled to depend upon the Bavarians, though he would fain have pushed his aggres sive movements with greater vigour. From these humiliating circumstances he was now relieved by the illustrious Wallenstein, who, upon certain conditions, offered to raise and equip an army of 50,000 men at his own expense for the imperial service. His terms were accepted, and he fulfilled his promise. With a well-equipped army he then overran all Germany, and forced Denmark to conclude peace at Lubeck, in January, 1629. But the Protestant cause, in this hour of peril, found a new champion in the person of the great Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, who led his forces to the succour of the unfortunate German States. The emperor, too, at the instigation of the German Diet, had deprived Wallenstein of his command, and thus the Swedish hero was left without a worthy rival in the field. 20. Gustavus entered Germany, and drove Tilly before him from point to point. He then passed into Pomerania to relieve it of the imperial incubus ; but meanwhile, Tilly laid siege to Magdeburg, one of the strongholds of the Protestant religion and civil freedom. The resistance was desperate, and a siege being too protracted, the Bavarian general determined on carry ing it by assault (May 10, 1631). He succeeded in a night surprise ; forced his way into the doomed city, and gave it up to his merciless soldiery. The memory of that fearful day is still fresh in the indignant heart of Protestant Germany. 21. For then began, says Schiller, a scene of horrors, which neither history nor poetry can attempt to portray. Not the innocence of childhood, not the helplessness of old age, \u2014 neither youth nor sex, neither rank nor beauty, \u2014 could disarm the savage fury of the conquerors. Wives were dishonoured while sheltering in their husbands' arms, and daughters while treinb-"], [355, "327 THE SIEGE OF MAGDEBURG. ling at their parents' feet \u2014 defenceless woman suffering thus the double loss of virtue and of life. No concealment was safe, no sanctuary privileged, from the rapacity of a foe so merciless. In a single church fifty-three women were found beheaded. The Croats thought it a pastime to fling children into the greedy flames; Pappenheim's Walloons to stab them while nestling in their mothers bosoms. A few officers of the League, aghast at these enormities, ventured to remind the Bavarian that it rested but with him to bid them cease. \" Return in an hour,\" he replied coldly ; \" and I will see what I can do. The soldier deserves some recompense for the perils he dares and the trials he endures.\" So Hell reigned triumphant until the burning streets checked the ferocity of the soldiers ; for the Imperialists, that they might the more surely divert the resistance of the citizens, had, at the beginning of the assault, fired the town in several places, and the wind rising rapidly, now drove the flames from point to point, until all Magdeburg seemed one vast funereal pyre. Did ever the eye of Heaven gaze on a more appalling spectacle ? Through the lurid smoke shot up swift tongues of forked fire. The crumbling masonry fell into the streets with a horrid roar. The clash of swords, the rattle of musketry, the yells of the maddened troops, the shrieks of despairing women, all swelled the fearful tumult. It seemed at last that the very air glowed with the heat of the monstrous furnace, until, reeking with blood, the murderers were fain to withdraw into their camp, and the pall of desolation fell over the place where opulent Magdeburg had formerly raised its glittering towers and radiant spires. 22. When the conflagration abated, the Imperialists revisited the city to search for plunder, and on the 13th of May Tilly himself made his triumphal entry. But not less than 30,000 men, women, and children, it is supposed, had lost their lives in the sack of Magdeburg, and nothing greeted the conqueror's eyes save an indistinguishable mass of charred and blackened ruins. The next day solemn mass was performed in the Cathedral, a thanksgiving to the God of Love for the accomplishment of so foul a massacre ! 23. Fortune deserted Tilly from the fall of Madgeburg. He was defeated by Gustavus in the memorable battle of Leipzig, on the 7th of September, 1631, and the hitherto invin-"], [356, "328 BATTLE OF LTJTZEN. cible Bavarian stood rebuked by the superior genius of the Swedish hero. He owed his escape from the fatal field to an accident : a Swedish captain falling by a chance pistol shot when on the very point of stabbing him to the death. His defeat was so signal that he never recovered his cheerfulness or regained his confidence. Disaster trod upon disaster, and he finally termi nated his career in the great fight on the Lech, where he was again overthrown by the victorious Gustavus (March, 1632). He died of a wound from a cannon shot in the leg. 24. To stay the triumphant career of the Swede, the emperor was forced to summon to his aid the great general whom he had so recently loaded with disgrace. Wallenstein, as might be supposed, made his own terms. He stipulated that he should be made commander-in-chief, with absolute power over all the Austrian and Spanish troops in Germany ; that neither the Emperor nor the King of Hungary should appear with the army, or exercise over it any act of authority, make any appointment or offer any reward ; that no pardon should be valid which Wallenstein did not sanction ; that whatever conquests or confis cations should be accomplished, he alone should dispose of ; that as a certain reward of his services he should receive one of the hereditary provinces of the House of Austria \u2014 as an extraordi nary reward, one of the provinces of the empire ; that all the Austrian territories should be thrown open to the army if retreat became necessary ; that on the conclusion of a peace he was to be confirmed in the possession of the rich duchy of Mecklenburg ; and that if it should again be thought expedient to remove him from his command, timely notice should be given him. Surely never before did subject dictate such terms to a sovereign, or sovereign accept such terms from a subject. Their acceptance significantly proves the extent of the weakness and humiliation to which Ferdinand was reduced. No mayor of the palace in the days of the most incapable of the Merovingian kings of France had ever obtained such unlimited power, and the feeblest of the Capets was left with more authority than the Emperor of Germany now enjoyed. 25. In a succeeding chapter we shall glance at the first movements of Wallenstein upon taking the field in person, and it is here only necessary in continuation of our brief resume of the events which preceded the battle of Liitzen, to observe that"], [357, "MOVEMENTS OF THE TWO ARMIES. 329 after a succession of able manoeuvres, the Swedish king took up a position at Nuremberg (November 1, 1632), where he was received with shouts of welcome by the Germans, and began to throw up formidable entrenchments, as if the campaign for the year was at an end. Wallenstein then put his troops into winter quarters, disposing them so that they might be rapidly concen trated if necessary, and despatched Count Pappenheim with a large body of troops to seize Halle and relieve Coin. Different corps were posted in the neighbouring towns to watch on all sides the motions of the enemy. Count Colloredo guarded the castle of Weissenfels, while Wallenstein, with the remainder of his forces, encamped near Merseburg, from whence he proposed to march to Leipzig, and cut off the communications of the Swedish army with its Saxon allies. 26. No sooner did Gustavus learn from an intercepted letter that the Imperial army was weakened by the detachment of Pappenheim, than suddenly breaking up his camp before Nurem berg, he darted like an eagle on his prey (November 5). \" Right shoulders forward \" was the order passed along the Swedish column, and the whole army was immediately in full march for the memorable plain of Liitzen. Three signal guns from the Castle of Weissenfels announced the startling intelli gence to Wallenstein, and troops of fugitive cavalry pouring in to his camp confirmed its truth. The Imperialist leader's position was one of urgent peril. The forces he had with him were inferior in number to the enemy's. Pappenheim was at a distance ; the other corps could only be concentrated at Liitzen in succession. To retreat was impossible, for the Elbe was in his rear, and his \" star\" forbade it. If he fell back upon Leipzig, he abandoned Pappenheim and the other detachments to certain destruction. If he followed Pappenheim, he yielded the only communication with the Austrian states, shut himself up in a hostile country, and left open the junction of the Swedes with the soldiers of Saxony. 27. Wallenstein promptly decided upon a resolution worthy of his fame and fortune, and though he had hardly 12,000 men at hand, resolved to await the attack of the Swedes at Liitzen. The appointed signal-guns were fired to call in the outlying corps, and a messenger was despatched to Pappenheim with a brief but imperative missive, which ran as follows : \u2014"], [358, "330 BATTLE OF LUTZEN. \" The enemy is marching hitherwards. Break up instantly with every man and gun, so as to arrive here early in the morn ing. And I remain, \"A(lbrecht). D(uke). of M(ecklenburg). \" P.S. He i3 already at the pass and the hollow road.\" In these movements he was aided by fortune. The Swedes were retarded in their march by the bad state of the roads, and the high clayey banks of the Ripach, a stream which they had to cross, where the ford was gallantly defended by Isolan with a handful of Croats and cuirassiers. These were soon put to flight, but nevertheless a little time was gained. The day closed with a dense November fog, so that it was deep darkness when Gus tavus reached the field of Liitzen, and the battle was necessarily deferred until the morrow. 28. The plain of Liitzen is \" a rich and joyous-looking ex panse of land, studded with villages and tall ungainly church steeples ; here and there, bedded in the soil, one of those problematical boulders of dark red granite which the glaciers transported hither, according to modern belief, from distant Scandinavia, and which now chiefly serve as landmarks; far in the south, the first blue outlines of the Erzebirge faintly show themselves.\" This vast and shadowless level has been the battle field of Northern Germany from the earliest historic times. Here, or in the immediate neighbourhood, Henry the Fowler defeated the Huns in a.d. 934 ; here were fought the two battles of Leipzig or Breitenfeld, in the Thirty Years' War ; here Gus tavus Adolphus fought for the great cause of civil and religious freedom ; here Napoleon brought to bay the hosts of indignant Europe in 1813. \" Not an ear of corn is pure from the blood of men :\" scarce a hillock but grows greenly over the moulder ing bones of many a soldier brave and true. 29. \"Approaching Liitzen on the western side,\" says a recent writer, \" the traveller is able to estimate the optical error which [as we shall presently see] misled the Swedes, and partly discon certed their plans. The lofty old towers of the church and castle, and the high-pitched roofs, rising in an open field, and on the farther side of a slight depression in the ground, seem much nearer than they really are. \" Liitzen itself is a thoroughly old-fashioned, forgotten-lookinc"], [359, "THE SWEDE'S STONE. 331 little Saxon town, with walls and fosse partially preserved, and the open country on all sides extending close up to them. It has now about five hundred houses, and is traditionally believed to have been more considerable in old times ; as indeed must have been the case, or else the municipality indulged in a fine spirit of local exaggeration when, in a report dated in 1651, they mention that Wallenstein's troops, before the great battle, set fire to the ' suburbs of their city ; ' represented now by two or three beer-houses only, and one or two farm granges. Passing the town, and following the road to Leipzig for about three quarters of an English mile, the traveller sees on his left some thing like an obelisk, which his imagination will fix on at once as a monument of the battle, but which is, in truth, only the chimney of an abandoned shaft for digging peat, here found in large deposits beneath the gravel. But, presently afterwards, he dis covers, close on the right hand of the road, the central object of his search \u2014 the ' Swede's Stone.' It stands, not exactly on the spot where the king is supposed to have fallen, but within a few yards of it. The stone is a rough porphyritic boulder, of the kind already described, and bears on its northern face, fronting the road, the inscription, ' G. A., 1632.' It is surrounded, after the kindly German fashion, with a little shrubbery and gravel walk, and surmounted by a Gothic arch of cast-iron, placed there some twenty years ago by subscription ; executed in very fair taste, but injuring the simplicity of the stern old monument. It was a bold \u00e6sthetic thought of his Majesty's equerry and fellow-soldier, Jacob Erichson \u2014 though carried out with some thing of the roughness of execution belonging to the age \u2014 when he harnessed thirteen boors of the neighbouring village of Menchen to this stone, which lay at some distance, and made them drag it ' with sweat and tears ' to its present site, from whence it looks eternally over the northern plain of Germany towards the hero's own distant Scandinavia. ' Yet this is not the exact spot where the king fell,' adds the narrative (Vulpius, Megalurgia Martisburgica, i.e. the Marvels of Merseburg), ' but their strength was exhausted.' \" 30. The position of the rival hosts on the evening of the 4th of November may briefly be thus described : \u2014 Wallenstein was at Liitzen, covering the Leipzig road with a force of about 20,000 men, and Pappenheim at Halle, sixteen miles north-west of"], [360, "BATTLE OF LUTZEN. 332 Liitzen, with about 18,000. Gustavus at Nuremberg, some twenty miles south-west of Liitzen, with probably 25,000, and the Saxons at Torgau, forty miles north-east, with a force variously estimated at from 8,000 to 16,000. In order to crush Wallenstein before Pappenheim could come to his rescue, Gus tavus, as we have seen, set his troops in motion early on the 5th of November, but was delayed by various obstacles, and also, according to Harte, disconcerted by an optical mistake, which made the Swedes believe themselves nearer Liitzen than they really were. 31. On the evening of the 5th the Swedes were drawn up in two lines, with their left wing towards Liitzen, and their right resting upon a deep mill-stream, called the Flossgraben, which wound into the flat country in their rear. The highway road from Liitzen to Leipzig separated them from Wallenstein's forces, whose left was posted on the western bank of the Floss graben, while their right rested upon Liitzen, the whole line extending about a mile and a half. Neither of the armies was drawn up in a perfectly straight line, the Swedes being slightly convex, and the Imperialists concave ; the most salient part of the Swedish line approaching close to the Schwedenstein, or Swede's Stone. 32. Gustavus disposed his army in the same manner as at Leipzig ; the infantry in two lines, with Henderson's Scottish regiment in reserve. In the front rank stood four brigades, and as many in the second ; but the brigades of the first had twenty companies each, those of the second only thirteen. The cavalry was almost equal in strength to the infantry. It was posted on the flanks in two lines, with one regiment in reserve, along with Henderson's infantry. Forty pieces of artillery were distributed along the array. The right wing was commanded by the king in person, the left by Duke Bernard, of Weimar; and the second line by Kniphausen, and the centre by Count Brahe7 33. While thus pliable the disposition of the Swedish army, Wallenstein's sole care seems to have been to obtain for his forces the utmost possible consistency, and acordingly he drew up his infantry in five unwieldy bodies or solid squares, four in the centre and one on his right, at three hundred paces from the main road. Behind the intervals thus formed, smaller bodies of infantry were posted ; the cavalry covered the flanks, six large"], [361, "PUSH OF PIKE. 333 bodies in column on each ; and the centre was protected by a battery of seven guns, the right by fourteen, placed on an eminence which swept the greater part of the battle-field. The high-road was deeply entrenched, and musketeers stationed in the ditch, so as to fire over the excavated earth as over a parapet. About eighty pieces of artillery were posted in front of the Im perialist line. Each of the squares of infantry numbered about 4,000 men, pjkemen and musketeers in equal proportions, and at each angle small projecting formations of musketeers were grouped. \" The Imperial army,\" says Colonel Mitchell, \" might be compared to the alligator, formidable from its strength and fierceness if attacked in front, but slow, rigid, and unwieldy in its movements ; while the Swedish host more resembled the lion, being active as well as strong, and as able to spring directly upon the foe, as to tear, strike, and deal destruction in every direction. Still, the manner in which the armies of the period went to work in the hour of battle, with their mixed masses of spearmen and musqueteers, is a difficulty which historians have left unsolved, and which, at this distance of time, we are not well able to explain. What were the spearmen doing, exposed, without any power of reaction, to the shot, when the mus queteers were engaged ; and what became of the musqueteers when the battle came to ' push of pike ? ' \" 34. The defect of Wallenstein's formation was his enormous squares, constructed no doubt with a view to oppose the fierce onrush of the Swedes, and certainly well adapted to resist with effect the attacks of cavalry ; but from their inability to move offensively, or with rapidity, exposed to utter destruction when artillery played upon them. His cavalry consisted of four classes : cuirassiers, who wore full armour, helmet and gorget, and cuisse and cuirass \u2014 carbineers, with cuirass and carbine \u2014 dragoons \u2014 and light horse, or Croats. His right wing was the strongest, as he expected on the left to be speedily reinforced by Pap penheim. 35. The Swedish army was, as we have shown, the very reverse of the Imperialist. The infantry was disposed in small and compact bodies, six deep \u2014 the front rank formed by the famous black, yellow, green, and blue brigades of Sweden, with a considerable portion of British ; the second line mainly com posed of Germans. On the flanks hovered the cavalry ; Swedes"], [362, "334 BATTLE OF LLTZEN. on the right, Germans on the left; either cuirassiers, or armed with the light cuirass, carbine, and broadsword, or dragoons, armed with musket and sabre. The German horse also carried (it is said), in addition to their regular weapons, a hammer, hooked at one end, to drag the enemy off his horse. Platoons of musketry, 100 to 150 strong, were stationed between the squadrons. \" A more gallant army never entered into action ; and yet its experienced generals remarked with regret, that these were not the same invincible Swedes who had crossed the Baltic and conquered at Leipzig. Battles and marches, detach ments and garrisons, and, above all, the camp-fevers of Nurem berg, had thinned the ranks of those veterans, and they were replaced by recruits, who had learnt little as yet from their comrades, except their martial ardour.\" 36. The morning of the 6th of November rose darkly and dimly on the plain of Liitzen. The sun could scarce struggle through the clouds that folded over the heavens, and a thick and impenetrable mist brooded upon all things. Through the fog the Swedes pressed forward, unseen by the Imperialists, until within a thousand yards. Then they halted, and while impa tiently awaiting the uplifting of the fog, the king commanded prayers to be read in front of every regiment, and afterwards gave out \" Luther's Hymn,\" in which all the soldiery enthusias tically joined. Next rose the inspiriting music of a psalm, whose words, it is said, were written by Gustavus himself: \u2014 \" Verzage nicht, du Haiiflein klein\" (Fear not, thou little chosen band). Service over, he rode along the ranks, and encouraged his troops with hearty words. \" Fight as usual, brave comrades,\" he exclaimed, \" and you will this day make me the first king in the world.\" He wore, on this memorable occasion, a plain elk skin coat, and was mounted on a white charger of remarkable beauty, which, according to Cassim, had been thrown in his way by the enemy, that it might betray him to their fire on the day of battle. 37. Wallenstein wore a buff coat, covered with gold lace and embroidery, and leaving the litter, to which his gout had pre viously confined him, he mounted his horse, and rode up and down his ranks, who received their splendid and princely cap tain with shouts of welcome. To them he was the generous, the"], [363, "335 THE TWO LEADERS. invincible, the all-powerful, who lavished gold upon the brave, and led them to abundant plunder ; who had baffled, if he had not yet defeated, the Swede ; and whose mysterious communion with the stars invested him in their eyes with an aspect of solemn grandeur. Confident in their leader and themselves, they swore, it is said, that \" if they did not win the battle, they would drive God out of heaven with their cudgels!\" The Swedes were not less confident in the genius of their great king, and they were also inspired by a knowledge of the good cause for which they fought \u2014 the cause of Protestant freedom against the tyranny of the Church of Rome ; of the liberties of nations against the predominance of the House of Austria. 38. During the whole course of the war, says Schiller, two such chiefs \u2014 so equally matched in renown and ability \u2014 had not before stood face to face. Never as yet had courage been sobered by so terrible a hazard, or hope inspired by so splendid a prize ! Europe was now to learn who was her greatest general ; to-day, the leader hitherto unconquerable must acknow ledge a conqueror. This day, this eventful day, was to place it beyond a doubt whether the victories of Gustavus at Leipzig and on the Lech were due to his own capacity as a general, or the incompetency of those opposed to him ; and whether the services of Wallenstein would vindicate the costly price at which they had been purchased by the emperor. The humblest trooper in either army felt a jealous regard for his leader's fame, and under every corselet throbbed a heart warmed by the feelings which inspired their chiefs. The religious element was not wanting to heighten still further the enthusiasm of the two armies. The Lutheran saw before him the slaves of Antichrist ; the Papist felt that he should ensure salvation by overthrowing the heretics. Thus, the battle of Liitzen possessed almost every attribute except numbers which could command the attention of men : thus, in the annals of human slaughter few days are marked as more memorable than this 6th of November, 1632. The value of the stakes, the reputation of the players, the peril of the game \u2014 all have tended to surround the field of Liitzen with a peculiar interest ; and the names of Gustavus Adolphus and Wallenstein are still familiar in our mouths as household words \u2014 not alone because they were heroes, but because the struggle in which they wrestled with each other was heroic !"], [364, "336 BATTLE OF LUTZEN. 39. At eleven o'clock in the morning the red glare of the November sun shot like a streak of fire through the scattering mist, and its advent was hailed by crashing shots from the advanced parties of either army. A mass of flame and smoke on the right of the Imperialists showed that they had set fire to Liitzen to prevent their flank being turned. The heart of the impetuous Gustavus no longer knew the restraints of prudence. Placing himself at the head of the Steinbock regiment of cuiras siers, he gave the word to charge, and, exclaiming, \" Now, in God's name, let us at them ! Jesus, aid us, we fight for the honour of thy holy name !\" led them towards the enemy. At the same time he cried out to a favourite officer, Colonel Stahl hantsch, a soldier of fortune who had risen from the condition of a serving man, \" Charge those black fellows [Piccolomini's Austrian cuirassiers], or they will do us a mischief.\" As he advanced he rode not alone ; four comrades, besides his grooms, accompanied him \u2014 the Hof-Marschal Kreilsheim, the Chamber lain Truchsess, Duke Franz-Albert of Saxe-Lauenburg, and a young Nuremberger named Lobelfing. A fierce and restless fire of musketry and artillery met his troops in their onward career, but could not shake the determination of men who, on level ground, defied an equal foe. They clambered across the trenches, though not without terrible losses, and swept like a billow of steel upon the left wing of the Imperial cavalry. Horse to horse, and rider to rider; but the pause is only for a moment: down fall the Austrian cuirassiers \u2014 they break \u2014 they turn \u2014 and gallop across the plain. Meanwhile, the blue and yellow bri gades of the Swede are poured upon the foe. They, too, fight their way across the trenches, scatter the Imperialists that line them, capture their seven-gun battery and turn it on the enemy, and then hurl themselves with a resistless dash upon the first line of Wallenstein's infantry. Who can face those terrible spears ? Not the musqueteers and pikemen of the Austrian, who are broken, and incontinently take to flight. The brigades of the Imperialists have succumbed before this mighty onset of earnest men, when Wallenstein spurs his steed into the melee. What ho, there ! who is it that dares to abandon his standard ? His calm, serene brow, his flashing eye, his splendid bearing, work like a charm upon the disordered ranks. They halt ; they close up together; level pikes; for in hand-to-hand fight the heavy"], [365, "DEATH OF GUSTAVUS. 337 arquebus is useless, and, supported by three regiments of horse, once more face the exulting Swedes. Inch by inch they press upon them. Inspired by Wallenstein's subtle influence, they prove resistless ; drive back the Swedes across the trenches, and recapture their lost battery. The left wing of the army of Gus tavus, though gallantly led by Duke Bernard of Saxe-Weimar, is equally unfortunate ; and galled by the fire of the seventeen cannon posted on the Imperial right, show signs of wavering. The tidings reach the triumphant Gustavus, who immediately charges General Horn with the pursuit of the enemy's left, and hurries to restore his disordered battle. His troops hail him with acclamations, and, as if a sudden inspiration had possessed them, reform their array, and once more shatter the hopes of the Imperialists. Uncovering his head, Gustavus thanks the Lord of Hosts for the victory he has won, and gallops forward to see how it may best be turned to advantage. 40. At this moment a gefreyter, or colour-sergeant, in the Imperial ranks, observing that every one drew out of the king's way as he rode along, immediately ordered a musketeer to take aim at him. \" Fire at that man yonder,\" said he ; \" he must be a man of consequence.\" The shot broke the king's left arm, and finding himself growing faint from loss of blood, he desired Franz-Albert, Duke of Lauenberg, to lead him from the field. \" Mon cousin,\" said he, \" tirez moi d'ici car je suis fort blesse.\" As he turned, an Austrian trooper marked him, and, exclaiming, \"Art thou here ? I have long sought thee !\" discharged his carbine into the king's shoulder. With a groan, and the word3 \" My God ! \" he fell from his horse. The murderer was instantly beaten down with a storm of arquebusades by the Swedes ; but it is said that he was a Lieutenant Von Falkenberg,who had become acquainted with the royal person while a prisoner. The battle swept on, and Gustavus was left alone, except for the companionship of his youthful follower, the son of Baron Lobelfing, of Nuremberg, who, seeing the enemy drawing near, leaped from his horse, and besought the king to mount it. \" Then the king raised both his hands towards him ; but Lobelfing was not able alone to lift him on horseback, and his Majesty could not help himself. Thereupon came up some of the enemy's cuirassiers, and wanted to know who it was ; but neither the king nor Lobelfing would say. One of them, on this, fired a pistol through the king's z"], [366, "338 BATTLE OF LUTZEN. head, who then said, ' I am myself the King of Sweden,' and so fell asleep. They gave his follower two shots and three stabs, stripped him to his shirt, and left him for dead.\" * 41. The king's horse, rushing across the weltering field, with reins loose and housings blood-bedabbled, was the first intima tion which his troops received of the loss they and Protestant Christendom had sustained. His fugitive attendants soon confirmed the sad suspicion. Duke Bernard of Saxe- Weimar instantly hastened to Kniphausen, and asked him what was to be done ? The general answered that as the troops were in excellent order, a retreat might be easily effected ; but Bernard was not unworthy of his dead chief, and scouting the timid counsel, declared he would avenge his leader's death, and fight the battle to the last. A few spirited words renewed the vigour of the army : the colonel of the Steinbock cuirassiers, indeed, refused, but the duke sabred him with his own hand ; and the whole line again levelled their pikes at the Imperialists. As well attempt to withstand the shock of ocean, with a barrier of reeds, as to oppose the onrush of these infuriated men ! It swept away every resistance. The batteries were retaken, and the Imperial guns turned upon their own battalions. Once more the left wing was beaten off the field ; once more the centre shaken, when Pappenheim, hot from the sack of Halle, galloped into the melee with his fresh and furious squadrons. 42. The battle thus twice won is again renewed, and with most unequal chances for the Swedes, for Pappenheim has brought with him eight regiments of heavy cavalry. He rallies the right wing, which is scattering before the pikes of Gustavus Horn, and falls full upon the enemy. Worn by their long toil, and inferior in numbers, the Swedes no longer oppose an unshaken front ; they waver before the charge. Wallenstein seizes the opportunity to restore his broken array, and heading the assault, repels Duke Bernard's troops across the trenches ; retakes the battery which has so often changed its gunners. The horses strike their hoofs deep amid the dead and dying. A veritable tide of blood sweeps along the Liitzen road. Wallen stein, in the hottest of the fire, directs this terrible attack, wearing * After the battle he was removed to Nuremberg, where he died within a few days in his 19th year.

His attendants, slain or wounded, fall at his side. A cannon shot strikes the spur from his heel. Several balls lodge in the folds of his buff coat, but he escapes unharmed, rejoicing in the benignant influence of his star. Count Piccolomini, who has seven times charged the blue brigade of the Swedes with his cavalry, and, after a desperate contest, shattered it into frag ments, receives six musket balls, but nobly keeps the field. Not so the gallant but ferocious Pappenheim \u2014 the boldest warrior and most bigoted son of Rome. \u2014 carried on by the ardour of a wild fanaticism, he penetrates with his troopers into the midst of the Swedish array, and falls, hotly fighting, in the foremost rank. Long had he desired to cross swords with the hero of Sweden, but they were fated only to meet in death. Two musket shots pierced his breast, and his men, in spite of his injunctions, bore him from the battle. While they were con veying him to the rear, a rumour reached his ear that the antagonist he. had sought was no more. As soon as the report was confirmed, his face brightened, and his eye sparkled with a gleam of joy. \"Tell the Duke of Friedland,\" said he, \"that I die happy, since I know that the implacable foe of my religion has fallen on the same dav.\" 43. Once more the fortune of the battle changed. The cavalry which Pappenheim had so gallantly led, disheartened by his fall, and wearied by their long ride, shrunk from the protracted con test. \" The rest of the Imperial army,\" says Colonel Mitchell, \" occupied the ground on which they had fought ; but in broken and mixed-up bands, without officers, without order, aud totally incapable, therefore, of any combined effort. The Duke of Weimar profited quickly by the helpless condition of the enemy ; and the superior discipline of the Swedish troops well aided his spirited exertions. The reserves w-ere brought forward, the other troops were formed around them, and as day was closing the army advanced, for a third time, against the Imperialists. The resolution itself was enough to ensure victory, for the long and fearful excitement of battle once relaxed, leaves the toil-worn frame nerveless and exhausted, and the mind itself destitute of the energy and elasticity requisite for any renewal of vigorous exertion. And in war, a bold onset made by a few resolute men, against troops who have maintained, even successfully, a Z 2"], [368, "340 BATTLE OF LUTZEN. hard day's combat, is pretty sure to turn the scale in favour of the new assailants. And at Liitzen the resistance offered to the third attack of the Swedes was comparatively feeble : the trenches were passed, the guns captured, and the enemy, whose strength and order were completely gone, was forced at last to leave the long-disputed field.\" 44. Night is the best friend of the conquered. Through the darkness Wallenstein hastily retreated to Leipzig, abandoning his artillery and baggage to the Swedes \u2014 a moody, discomfited, wrathful man, who seemed, in the depth of his disappointment, to surrender for a time the duties of a commander. He had scarcely left the field when Pappenheim's infantry came up from Halle, six or seven thousand strong, enough to have retrieved the fortunes of the day ; but without a leader \u2014 without orders \u2014 uncertain as to the issue of the battle \u2014 they knew not what to do, and retired to Leipzig in some confusion. On the fol lowing day the Imperialist general made an attempt to claim for himself the honours of victory by sending his Croats to the field to remove the artillery; but the appearance of the Swedish army, drawn up by Duke Bernard in order of battle, dispersed them incontinently, and Wallenstein's abandonment of Leipzig, and, soon afterwards, of all Saxony, confessed his defeat. 45. The victors, however, had more to regret than the van quished. The loss in killed and wounded was about equal on both sides, though the Swedes maintained a comparatively unbroken front after the battle, while the Imperialists were so disorganised that they could not muster 2,000 effective men ; but in the death of their great king, the greatest hero and most sagacious sovereign of his age, they suffered an irreparable injury. The sorrow which his death occasioned, says a German writer, throughout Protestant Germany and Sweden, is depicted by contemporaries in the liveliest colours. Country and town, citizen, peasant, and soldier, all united to mourn the common loss. They wandered about like a flock without a shepherd, loudly bewailing the death of their prince, their liberator ; for such to all of them was Gustavus Adolphus. Never was a sove reign more loved, or more wept for. Every one would have his portrait, and there was not a cottage in Germany which it did not adorn. Fathers told the tale of his heroism and his devotion to their sons, who in their turn transmitted it to another"], [369, "CHARACTER OF A TRUE HERO. 341 generation ; so that even now, after a lapse of more than two centuries, he has a reality and personal distinctness which seems to make him known to us as a living, breathing man. He is no mere historical phantom ; no thing of shreds and patches, built up by the fancy of ingenious speculators ; but the Protestant chief, the Cromwell of the North, who rode into the heat of the battle with the Bible in the one hand and the sword grasped in the other. Tall of stature, his limbs stalwart and well-propor tioned, his features noble and animated, his eyes of a bright and lively blue, his fair brow crowned by a wreath of golden hair \u2014 \"II re d'oro,\" the \" Golden King\" of the Italians \u2014 it is easy to understand the enthusiasm which his very appearance excited. \" Praying hard is fighting hard: pray constantly\" was his mot d'ordre to his soldiers, who thus drank in from his speech and deeds that religious zeal which is far more potent in the fight than the greed of gold or lust of glory. His camp was a model of discipline, and even savoured too much of the conventicle. \" You may win salvation under my command,\" he would say to his officers, \" but hardly riches.\" His life and example were in themselves a holy scripture, and he demanded nothing from others which he did not render himself. His address was marked by the frankness of a soldier rather than by the dignity of a monarch ; his life was simple as that of a Lutheran pastor's ; he owned his errors with the innocence of a child. He felt the peril of the irresponsibility of a king. \" The devil,\" as he told his chaplain, who found him one day reading the Bible, \" is very near at hand to those who are accountable to none but God for their actions.\" The great defect of his character, which, remem bering his youth when he ascended the throne, and the swift successes of his career, we cannot find it difficult to forgive, was the violence of his temper. In this he showed himself sprung from the old Seakings and Berserkirs of the North. \"All generals,\" he would say, \" had their weaknesses : this man his drunkenness and that his avarice. His own was ungovernable wrath, and he prayed men to forgive him.\" This impetuosity of disposition showed itself in his recklessness of danger. He rode into the thick of the battle, and exposed his breast to the swift shot and the deadly steel like a common soldier \u2014 a serious fault in a general, on whose life depends not only the lives of thou sands, but the issue of the last appeal, the solemn arbitrament of"], [370, "342 BATTLE OF LUTZEN. arms. \" His fate at Liitzen,\" says Merivale, most justly, \" was but in accordance with this habitual disregard of sterner duty. He perished in a blaze of glory, which by its very excess of light dazzles the historical inquirer, and converts into a mar tyrdom that which was in truth both an error and a crime. There have been generals as prudent as brave, who have never theless risked their lives by daring exposure, deliberately, because the rallying of a broken army, or the necessity of personal pre sence at a menaced spot, seemed to require it. Gustavus had no such excuse. His Smalanders needed no such prodigality of life to encourage them in the charge. His place was not at their head, but at that of the whole army. He ran on almost certain death, in the mere animal spirit of valiant intoxication, like the Berserkir of old, or the savage Malay. ' Died Abner as a fool dieth?' The traveller who stands by the Swede's Stone may not without reason put this question, and feel his enthusiasm damped by the reflection that Gustavus, a victor at Liitzen, might probably have brought the war at once to a successful termination. The sixteen years of misery which followed, ending, indeed, in the rescue of Protestantism and liberty at last, but as by fire only, and under trials the most unfavourable to their healthy development; the decline of Sweden from her high estate; the deterioration of the political and social spirit of Germany \u2014 consequences which Europe feels to this day, and our children are likely to experience for generations yet unborn \u2014 all these followed from that momentary yielding to the furious impulse of a noble but uncontrolled nature.\" 46. The career of Gustavus Adolphus was as brief as it was brilliant. He ascended the throne of Sweden at seventeen ; he died at thirty-eight, From the beginning he was marked out for no ordinary purposes. \" Ille Faciet \", (This one will do it) was the answer of his father, Charles IX., when urged upon undertakings for which he felt himself incompetent. The out set of his reign was bright with promise. Instead of seeking fame in war, he busied himself in the establishment of the tran quillity of his kingdom by concluding peace with Denmark and Russia, commanding their respect and securing their friend ship by his moderation and justice. Having introduced order and economy into the internal administration of the state, he concentrated his military efforts against his persevering 'foe,"], [371, "343 THE WISDOM OF COURAGE. Sigismund, King of Poland, who claimed the Swedish crown by virtue of his descent from Gustavus Vasa, though excluded by his profession of the Catholic religion. While thus engaged, his political sagacity became alarmed at the encroachments made by the House of Austria, which threatened to render the independence of the German States a dream of the past, and to quench in blood the last fires of Protestantism lit by Huss and Luther. He had reason to tremble for the safety of his own kingdom. Wallenstein had led his army to the shores of the Baltic, and was organising a fleet which could only be intended to act against Scandinavia. The Emperor of Germany refused him the title of king, and Swedish ships were plundered in ports occupied by German troops. The storm was brooding : should he await its outbreak ? 47. At this juncture, the interference of France, which saw with jealous apprehension the growth of the Austrian power, let loose his arms upon Germany by inducing Sigismund to agree to a truce of six years. He immediately resolved to declare war against the emperor. But such were the imperial resources, so vast was the dominion and so great the fame of the Hapsburg sovereign, that even the Swedish chancellor, the illustrious Oxenstiern, bold and resolute as was his genius, shrank from so daring an enterprise. He recommended a defensive war, usually the resource of timid or unprepared minds. \" But,\" said the wiser because braver king, \" if we await the enemy in Sweden, a defeat will cause us the loss of everything ; if we attack him in Germany, a success at the outset will gain us everything. The sea is wide and we have a long extent of coast to defend. Stralsund means, for us, liberty and independence ; so long as we hold it we command the Baltic. To hold Stralsund we must not remain in Sweden, but advance into Pomerania.\" Yet he did not disguise from him self the hazard of the adventure. He set his house in order, like a man who feels that death may smite him at any hour. On the 20th of May, 1630, when all his preparations were completed, he presented himself before the Diet of Stockholm to bid the states a last farewell. He had with him his daughter Christina, then in her fifth year, and bade them swear allegiance to her, in case he should never more return. Grave men wept at the scene, and the king himself could not at first command"], [372, "344 BATTLE OF LUTZEN. his emotions. \" Not lightly or wantonly,\" he said, \" am I about to engage you and myself in this new and perilous war ; God is my witness that I do not fight to gratify my own ambition. But the emperor has shamefully wronged me in the person of my ambassador. He has supported my enemies, persecuted my friends and brethren, trampled my religion in the dust, and even stretched his vindictive arm against my crown. The oppressed states of Germany call loudly for succour, which, with God's help, we will give them.\" 48. In the spirit indicated by these words Gustavus set out on his memorable expedition, from Elfsnaben in Sweden, with a fleet of 200 transports and sixty war-ships, carrying 13,000 troops \u2014 a small army, truly, but so admirably disciplined and equipped, and fired by so noble an enthusiasm, that it was well fitted to cope with twice its numbers. He landed near Perre- Miinde, in Usedom, on the 24th of June, 1630, exactly 100 years from the confession of Augsburg. The king was the first to leap on shore. Immediately he knelt down, and returned thanks to God for the safe passage accorded to his fleet and army. Then turning round he replied to a remark, which this devout act had excited, \" A good Christian can never be a bad soldier ; and the man who has finished his prayers has already got over the best half of his day's work.\" Such a hero was sure to arouse the sluggish but intense enthusiasm of the German nature, and Gustavus became at once its idol, as he still remains its saint. The Germans, who had been accustomed to the fierce excesses and licentious ravages of the troops of Wallenstein, now saw with wonder and admiration an army as steady on the march as on parade \u2014 an army which prayed and chanted psalms \u2014 an army which acknowledged a God, and believed in a Bible ! And with greater wonder, they who had known the gloomy and inscrutable Wallenstein, proudly wrapping himself in the mystery of a secret communion with the stars, saw the frank and unostentatious Swede mixing familiarly with his troops, and expounding to them the Scriptures, with the fervour, and, perhaps, the prolixity, of a Calvinistic divine ! 49. Such was the man whom the emperor affected, at first, to laugh at, as \" a king of snow, held together by the frost of the north, who would soon melt under the influence of a southern sun ;\" but whose daring genius and military fervour soon broke"], [373, "WAS GUSTAVUS ASSASSINATED ? 345 in pieces the reputation of generals so deservedly famous as Tilly, Maximilian, and Wallenstein. His system of tactics startled the Imperialist veterans. He disregarded the venerable tradition of winter-quarters. \" The Austrians,\" he said, \" may do as they please, but the Swedes are soldiers in winter as well as in summer.\" Old dogmas of precedence affected him but little. \" Merit alone,\" he exclaimed, \" decides the rank of kings.\" Of ardent courage, he always led the way where danger threatened, and wherever Gustavus led his men would follow. Thus his three campaigns were brilliant with victories, and fitly closed in glory on the memorable field of Liitzen. 50. The deaths of the great are often attended with circum stances of doubt and mystery which impose upon the credulity of the vulgar, or their fears, and lead to a general belief that they have been the victims of assassination. Superstition has the bowl or the dagger always ready for kings and heroes. The shrugged shoulder and the drooping eyelid are big with awful import. The fate of Gustavus, therefore, was seized upon as a theme for the most fertile imaginations, and though there was no marvel in the death of a hero so prone to engage himself in the sharpest melee, and to expose his breast to shot and steel, men were not content with a common-place termi nation to a romantic career. It was declared that he had fallen, not in fair fight, but by the hands of assassins bribed to commit the crime by the Jesuits or the emperor. Notorious was the hatred with which both these parties regarded him ; it was evidently their interest to rid themselves of so formidable an opponent. Public opinion, therefore, concluded at once that they were guilty, and next busied itself in suggesting who were the instruments of the guilt. Two of the king's attendants obtained, some years after the action, absolution for having, as they confessed, murdered their royal master. One of them died at Crailsheim, in Franconia, and the other at Nattmberg, in Saxony. The latter gave to his priest a telescope, taken, as he said, from the person of the murdered Gustavus, which the Swedish government purchased, and which is still preserved at Stockholm. But no corroborative proof of these statements was ever obtained, and only one of the murderers professed to have been instigated by the Catholics. It is most certain that these men were actuated by that singular love of posthumous noto-"], [374, "346 BATTLE OF LUTZEN. riety which occasionally besets the minds of the vulgar, and that they had not the slightest share in the great king's death. 51. Suspicion rested with more probability upon Francis Albert of Saxe-Lauenburg, whose vacillating character and strange fortunes seemed to authorise men in believing him capable of foul deeds. He had begun his military career in the Imperial service, but personal pique induced him to forsake it and join the banner of Sweden, when it flung its fortunes to the air from the camp at Nuremberg. It is said that Oxen stiern warned Gustavus against him, but the king's soul was above suspicion, and he allowed him to remain near his person as a volunteer. He was the only one among the king's immediate attendants at Liitzen who escaped unwounded. The Swedish officers receiving him after the battle with marked coldness, he went to Dresden, aud took service in the Saxon army ; but unable to agree with Counts Thurn and Arnheim, resigned his command, and attached himself to the fortunes of Wallenstein. After that great leader's murder he was arrested by Gordon and sent a prisoner to Vienna, where he remained a year in confinement. Obtaining his liberty he embraced the Catholic faith, and accepted a command in the Austrian army, which brought him, in 1644, into collision with the Swedes at Siverdnitz. He ex perienced a severe defeat from the General Torstensohn, who having excited his troops to avenge the death of the great Gustavus on his murderer, they rushed upon the advancing Austrians with so fierce a daring as to break them in an instant, and scatter them over the field. Francis Albert surrendered, but not until he was covered with wounds, of which he died in ten days' time, in great agony, without allusion to the crime of which he was popularly suspected. 52. On the whole, then, it may reasonably be concluded that the king met his death in fair fight, and under the circumstances described by his young follower, Lobelfing. It is difficult to imagine any motive which could have impelled Duke Francis Albert to assassinate his leader and protector. It is, indeed, asserted that when received in his early manhood at the Swedish court\u2014 before the death of Charles IX.\u2014 he gave some offence to the young heir of Sweden, which was repaid by a swinging box on the ears, and that the blow excited in his heart a hatred"], [375, "THE INFLUENCE OF A HERO. 347 and a lust of revenge which were only quenched at Liitzen in the king's blood. But in reality it was with the Duke's elder brother that Gustavus quarrelled; so that this romantic fiction falls baseless to the ground.* There is no need to search for assassins to account for the death of a hero so impetuous and so reckless as Gustavus Adolphus. Fate sometimes directs the steel against the leader's heart, and quick Death rides with the onrushing battle ! 53. The king's body was found on the day following the battle not far from the Great Stone, which, for a hundred years before, had stood between Liitzen and the Canal, and wliich has since borne, in memory of the disaster, the name of the Schwe denstein. So covered with blood and wounds as to be scarcely recognisable, and stripped of its clothes and ornaments, it was drawn from beneath a heap of dead, conveyed to Weissenfels, and there delivered over to the tearful embraces of the queen. His generals, silent beneath a blow so deplorable and irretriev able, stood motionless around his bier, seeking in vain to pierce the gloom of the Future that darkened before them. In due time the dead hero was carried across the seas to the land wdtose annals he had enriched with so imperishable a glory, and there interred with the dust of his predecessors. But his example, his genius, his spirit \u2014 call it what you will \u2014 that subtle and mysterious influence which a great man exercises upon the nations \u2014 continued to battle for the Protestant cause ; to ani mate the armies which warred for the liberties of man ; and may vet again, if the hour of peril rises, and Sweden stands to the fight in defence of her religion and her freedom, her ancient glories and present honour, invisibly marshal her hosts upon the field, and lead them as of yore to victory ! 54. The Thirty Years' War terminated in October, 1648, by the Treaty of Munster, or, as it is often called, the Peace of Westphalia, and the Protestant States were left to enjoy their liberties and exercise their religion undisturbed by the hatred of Rome or the aggressions of Austria. The Papacy and its supporters gained nothing by the protracted struggle, which elevated the Protestant nations, and lowered the house of Haps burg. France, indeed, profited much by the dissensions in which it had taken an active but a secret part, and its influence * Leindblat's Swedish Plutarch."], [376, "348 BATTLE OF LUTZEN. in the continental system became more apparent with every succeeding year. A great cause does not always die with its hero, and the cause for which Gustavus bled and died did not perish with him ; and the result of the struggle wherein he played a part so splendid, was to establish Sweden as a leading power, and to emancipate from the trammels of Austrian supre macy the Protestant princes of Germany. Since the Peace of Westphalia, Austria has never regained her former imperial position, and it rests with Protestant Prussia, whose leaders, unhappily, seem blind to the lessons of history, to maintain the cause which triumphed, under the auspices of Gustavus, on the famous field of Liitzen."], [377, "POSTSCRIPT V.

Was hea great captain, or only a successful impostor? \" It cannot,\" says the Athen\u00e6um, \" but strike readers of Schiller's History with surprise that nothing is done by the Imperial army so long as the first captain of the age is at its head, but that as soon as Wallenstein is murdered and a noted bungler succeeds him, the Austrians begin to win a series of victories.\"] w Nothing is common in my destiny, Nor in the furrows of my hand.

The dazzling changes and mysterious romance of the life of Wallenstein render him one of the most popular heroes of European history, though he is, nevertheless, one of the least understood ; and what the public mind has learned of him has been gathered from Schiller's magnificent trilogy, rather than from the pages of any more veracious chronicler. There, in that great and fateful drama, he stands out in a certain grandeur of melancholy, as a man almost weary of fortune, whose intellect, soaring above the prizes of the world, as much as it does beyond the bounds of human knowledge, refuses to be satisfied with the secrets of the stars, and longs to participate in the Infinite. He is not the dupe of his superstition, he is not always the slave of destiny, but holds to that pride of manhood which sees in man a"], [378, "350 POSTSCRIPT V. being only a little lower than the angels. He verily believes that his soul can see and comprehend \" Whate'er Full of mvsterious import Nature weaves, And fashions in the depths\u2014 the Spirit's ladder, That from this gross and visible world of dust Even to the starry world, with thousand rounds, Builds itself up ; on which the unseen powers Move up and down on heavenly ministries.\" As a man above men, as a man marked out by an overruling fate, he moves statelily through the surrounding circumstances and accidents of life, and it seems but natural that to such as he events should bow themselves, and kings and nations be but as pawns in his mighty hands. In his very death appears an agency that is more than human, and at the last he falls, not beneath the greedy daggers of hired assassins, but \u2014 so it seems \u2014 stricken by a supernatural doom. We believe that the star gazer Seni speaks but the awful words of truth, when his tongue falters the unheeded warning \u2014 \" A fearful sign stands in the house of life \u2014 An enemy ; a friend lurks close behind The radiance of thy planet;\" and momently expect to see the storm-cloud spread over the heavens, and the lightning leap out of its depths, in witness to the sympathy of Nature with her hero's agony. 2. Not such the Wallenstein of history, as the briefest narra tive of his career will serve to show, but yet a man of mark who fills a splendid niche in the annals of his time ; whose footsteps shook the earth as he strode on his stately path ; and whose substance has left fame more than enough to track his memory. Nevertheless, historians cannot agree in reference to many important episodes of his marvellous life ; much less can they decide whether he was charlatan or hero, an able general or a blundering tactician. From the excessive partiality of the few, and the extreme antipathy of the many, he has suffered so severely, that it is difficult to trace the real features and character of the man ; for it was his fortune to excite the hatred both of Roman Catholics and Protestants \u2014 the former regarded him as a traitor, the latter shrank from him as an oppressor. Woe to the man who is thus bound to the rack of bigotry! His limbs shall be so distorted, his proportions so shrunken, his features so"], [379, "wallenstein's youth. 351 convulsed, that not even the most accurate eye shall recognise his real self, or discern the brilliant hero in the hapless victim ! 3. Albrecht Edsebius Wenzelaus of Waldstein, known in history and in poetry under the name of Wallenstein, was born at Hermanie, in Bohemia, on the 15th of September, 1583.* He was the third and youngest son of Wilhelm Baron von Wald stein, and of Margaret of Smirricky, a lady whose moderate dowry was nearly all the fortune his father possessed. He was originally educated as a Protestant, the religion of his parents, but the death of his father in 1593, and of his mother two years later, threw him into the hands of his maternal uncle, a Catholic, who placed him at the College of Nobles which the Society of Jesus had established at Olmiitz. In his earlier years he showed that distaste to learning which is often manifested by lively and stalwart lads, preferring military exercises to classic studies, and asserting a right of command above all his comrades. The Jesuits detected his latent powers of mind, and entrusted his conversion to Father Pachta, who found little difficulty in persuading a young and ardent boy to embrace the tenets of the Romish Church. 4. He left Olmiitz to accompany an opulent young nobleman, the Lord Liek of Riesentein, in his travels, and gathered much knowledge of men and manners in his tour through France and Spain, England, Italy, Germany, and Holland. Their fellow traveller and tutor was Peter Verdunge, a mathematician and astrologer, afterwards the friend of Kepler, whose prelections, it is possible, first embued the speculative mind of Wallenstein with a love of the starry science. It seized so strongly on his imagination that he spent some months at Padua to pursue those studies which, to the last hour of his eventful life, guided his movements and influenced his fortunes. Nor is it to be wondered at that in an age when astronomy was in its infancy, a dreamy but aspiring intellect should see in the bright orbs of heaven the ministers of fate, and endeavour to read in their radiant pages the secrets of the mysterious future. \" In our aspirations to be great Our destinies o'erleap their mortal state, And seek a kindred with them ! \" t * This sketch is founded in the main on Coxe's House of Austria ; Harte's Life of Gustavus Adolphus; Schiller's Thirty Years' War ; Forster's Wallensteines Pro zess ; and Mitchell's Life of WaUenstein \u2014 tbe latter an able but most partial work. t Byron's Childe Harold."], [380, "352 POSTSCRIPT V.

The imagination rejects what the judgment recognises ; we are almost fain to believe in spite of our better reason : \u2014 \" And still the heart doth need a language, still Doth the old instinct bring back the old names, And to yon starry world they now are gone, Spirits or gods, that used to share this earth With man as with their friend ; and to the lover Yonder they move, from yonder visible sky Shoot influence down : and even at this day 'Tis Jupiter who brings whate'er is great, And Venus who brings everything that's fair.\" 5. Wallenstein's faith in astrology had a remarkable influence upon his career, and having first imagined in the stars a series of brilliant fortunes, he was encouraged to devote all his powers to their accomplishment. It is thus that genius often works out its own predictions. His Paduan tutor, Professor Argoli, having discovered the bent of his fiery pupil's taste, contrived also to discover that the heavens foretold him a career of martial success ; and believing himself placed under the care of an over ruling destiny, Wallenstein set out to join the Imperial army, then struggling against the Turks in Hungary. After two or three campaigns, he obtained promotion to a captaincy of infantry, for brilliant service at the siege of Grass. A captain of infantry !\u2014 a long way as yet from the splendid position pre dicted by the flattering stars ! 6. After the Peace of Sitvatorok, in 1606, Wallenstein returned to Bohemia, and entered upon the possession of his patrimony. It was ill adapted to the wants and desires of an ardent spirit, and his brother-in-law, Count Zerotin, did accordingly seek for him the appointment of chamberlain to the Archduke Matthias, in order \" that his kinsman might have a ladder by which to ascend to fortune.\" His imperious nature, however, was not suited to the atmosphere of a court. He could not submit gracefully to the restraints of a rigid etiquette, and sick and weary of archdukes and chamberlains, he looked for success in"], [381, "353 TWO MARRIAGES. some other quarter. Like Marlborough, he was destined to owe bis first step on ambition's ladder to a woman's favour, and obtained immense wealth with the hand of a mature widow, the Lady Lucretia Nikessin, of Landek. Of their married life we only know this much, that she was passionately enamoured of her husband, and to secure his affections administered a, philtre, or love-potion, of such power that she nearly killed him. She died soon afterwards, and a blank occurs in Wallenstein's bio graphy which the research of later ages has found it impossible to supply. From 1607 to 1617 \u2014 that is, from his twenty-third to thirty-third year \u2014 we lose sight of him altogether ; an extra ordinary circumstance in the life of a man who filled so large a space in the annals of his time. We find that he lived the life of a landed proprietor on his Moravian estates, and \"made no sign.\" 7. He came again before the world in 1617, when, the Arch duke Ferdinand of Gratz engaging in hostilities with the Vene tians, he raised and equipped, at his own expense, a corps of 2U0 horsemen, and hastened to his assistance. This step was the beginning of a career of unparalleled brilliancy. It was observed that he lived in the most splendid style, and maintained a hos pitality as open as the day ; that no troops in the army were so liberally paid or richly appointed. The Archduke presented the loyal baron at Vienna, and the Emperor raised him to the rank of Count, gave him a chamberlain's gold key, and placed him at the head of the Moravian militia. It was now that he married his second wife, receiving with her an accession of for tune and influence. This was Isabella Catherine, Countess of Havrach, daughter of Count Havrach, the imperial minister, \u2014 a lady of great virtue and accomplishments, and probably of some personal charms. 8. When the Bohemians broke out in revolt against the Emperor Matthias (see p. 321), the count took up arms on his sovereign's side, though for the unprincipled ambition with which his enemies charge him to have been possessed, a wider sphere would seem to have been opened among the insurrec tionists. The states accordingly deprived him of his command, and despatched a body of soldiery to force him to evacuate Olmiitz. In doing so he carried with him the public treasure, and delivered 100,000 crowns to the emperor at Vienna, receiving a portion of it for the purpose of raising a regiment A A"], [382, "354 POSTSCRIPT V. of cuirassiers. Men in those days were easily aroused by a summons to \" boot and saddle,\" and in the June following, at the head of a troop of heavy-armed horsemen, he did good service at the battle of Teyne, scattering Count Mansfeldt's mercenaries, and clearing the road to Vienna, where Ferdinand, King of Bohemia, was then beleaguered by his rebellious sub jects (June, 1618). The news of his success and his rapid march upon Prague so alarmed the Bohemians that they broke up their camp before the capital, and retired to defend their own country ; thus enabling Ferdinand to escape to Frankfort, and receive there the imperial crown. 9. Most minds are prone to indulge in speculations upon events that have never happened, and to amuse themselves with conjectural history, with dreams of possible consequences of victories never won, or defeats that have not been endured. Thus, it is curious enough to inquire what might have been the course of European history if Wallenstein and his cuirassiers had not gained the battle of Teyne. Ferdinand was a prisoner in Vienna ; his own nobles were clutching at his garments, and demanding his signature to the conditions which the Bohemians sought to impose. \" Nandel,\" they cried aloud, \" dost hesitate to subscribe ? \" Had he yielded, it is probable that the Pro testants would have reigned supreme in Germany, that their influence would have crossed the Alps and awakened the genius of the Italians, encouraged the Huguenots of France, and shaken the dreary fanaticism of Spain. That great struggle between the two opposing creeds which still convulses Europe might thus have terminated in the seventeenth century, and the poli tical conditions of the world have been decided by \" a charge of cavalry in the plains of Teyne.\" 10. Not only was Ferdinand opposed by his revolted subjects in Bohemia, but Bethlem Gabor, the Transylvanian adventurer, and pretender to the crown of Hungary, penetrated Austria on his side, and encamped within sight of the spires and palaces of Vienna. The Imperial troops were driven helplessly before his fierce marauders, and it was only Wallenstein's skill and reso lution that enabled them to retreat into the large islands that in tervene between the city and the left bank of the river. He held the bridge until the last of the troops had passed, and broke it down, after a desperate struggle. Bethlem Gabor, unable to force"], [383, "355 NEW HONOURS AND INCREASING WEALTH. the passage of the Danube, and finding his men in want of pro visions, was compelled to retire, leaving the emperor at liberty to pour all his forces upon insurgent Bohemia. Wallenstein was detached to sieze and occupy Janen, and thus lost an oppor tunity of sharing in the decisive victory under the walls of Prague. But the emperor was so well satisfied with his services that he sent him into Moravia to receive the submission of that province. He entered Olmiitz in triumph, repossessed himself of his own domains, and began that system of buying up confiscated estates which in a few years made him potentially rich. He was soon recalled to the field by a fresh incursion of Bethlem Gabor, whom he defeated at Shanutz, where the prince fought in person, and whose second army he so completely repulsed at Krunser, on the 18th of October, 1621, that Gabor was fain to conclude peace with the Emperor, and renounce his pretentions to the Hungarian crown. 11. New honours were now lavished upon the head of this favourite of fortune (a.d. 1623) : he was created Count Palatine and Duke of Friedland, with the right of striking coin and granting patents of nobility. \" The domains forming the duchy,\" says Colonel Mitchell, \"had been confiscated, and Wallenstein had purchased them for 150,000 florins, a sum which we may easily suppose him to have had at command. But where he obtained the 7,290,228 florins with which he afterwards pur chased more than sixty other confiscated estates, we cannot well understand. As the acquisition of such property was not deemed very creditable, nor the tenure looked upon as very secure, Wallenstein bought the domains at less than a third of their real value ; a circumstance that accounts for his being wealthy, but not to the extent of the sum in question, and still less to the extent of the much larger sums he afterwards had at his dis posal. He inherited a considerable fortune from his first wife, and had received a large portion with the Countess of Havrach ; he had also handed to the emperor a pretty long account for the arms, pay, and appointments of the regiments he had raised. But all this could hardly amount to a sum that would now be more than a million sterling ; for, though a good manager, aud always preaching economy to his agents, he was magnificent in his expenses ; and his Bohemian and Moravian estates had been confiscated during the rebellion, and had no doubt suffered by A A 2"], [384, "356 POSTSCRIPT V. the war. This extraordinary command of money still remains an enigma in Wallenstein's history.\" 12. The particulars of his life at this period which have been handed down to us represent him as keeping the state and enjoying the power of a feudal chief; making roads and build ing palaces ; surrounding himself with men of letters and of science ; conferring charters upon certain towns and districts ; placing a price on the head of refractory vassals ; establishing schools and lecturing the clergy ; draining, planting, and breed ing ; decorating his servants in splendid liveries, and offering a situation in his household to the learned Grotius ; \u2014 a singular combination of the magnificent and the mean, the useful and the pretentious. On the whole, his correspondence exhibits him as a man of large and liberal views, of luxurious tastes, of an aspiring and restless disposition, and an intellect vacillating be tween the dreamy and the practical. Like the trunk of the elephant which bends an oak or picks up a pin, his genius would administer a province and yet stoop to the details of the liveries of his pages. He was splendid and boundless in all his concep tions, and his poetical imagination found a rare pleasure in bril liancy of colour and elegance of form, in the pomp of military parade and the luxuriance of a palatial state. 13. He was now to make his appearance on a wider stage, and assume the proportions of an historical character. The emperor was at the crisis of his fortunes, surrounded on every side by enemies ; Upper Germany was lost to him ; and in Lower Germany his forces could scarcely make head against the Pro testant soldiery, under King Christian of Denmark. Nor over those forces had he any absolute control. They were furnished in the main by Maximilian and the Catholic League, and at their bead was Tilly, a Bavarian general. Wallenstein, from his Moravian palace, had long watched the course of events with silent vigilance. The opportunity which his ambition desired had come at last, and he hastened to profit by it. What his emperor could not effect, he proposed to undertake, and offered to raise and equip at his own expense an army of 50,000 men. There were not wanting many to ridicule his extravagance, while others hinted that it was dangerous to place so much power in the hands of an individual like Wallenstein \u2014 haughty, aspiring, and impatient of control. The emperor hesitated, and wished to"], [385, "357 WALLENSTEIN RAISES AN ARMY. limit the strength of the army to half the number; but Wallen stein declared that \" 20,000 men would die of hunger, whereas 50,000 would enable him to levy contributions at pleasure.\" Wallenstein's proposal was therefore accepted. He was allowed to nominate his own officers, and to reward them and himself out of the property that might be confiscated in the conquered countries. On this occasion he is first styled general \u2014 \" colonel general and field-captain\" \u2014 and promised a salary of 6,000 florins per month. 14. It was soon found that Wallenstein's promise was no empty boast. Adventurers flocked to his standard from every quarter. Light horsemen leapt into the saddle, and rode from the banks of the Ukraine and the Don ; the fierce Croat brought his rapacious sword from Hungary ; and the dragoon and the cuirassier came from Netherlands and the Rhine. Liberal pay and boundless plunder were attractions which no soldier of fortune could resist; while the mysterious character and barbaric magnificence of Wallenstein were not without their influence upon the minds of many. Soon 20,000 men were under arms ; and the number had increased to 30,000 when they set out from Ezer, on the 3rd of September, 1625, to carry the war into Lower Saxony. Men of different creeds and nations Wallen stein's rigid discipline soon transformed into a veteran army, which conquered whenever it was confronted by a .foe. At Gottingen a corps of Brunswickers was shamefully beaten, and the shadow of the Imperial forces on the borders of Saxony terrified the States into soliciting peace. Their armies, however, were little unbroken, and they thought themselves justified in demanding that the Imperial troops should be withdrawn from their territories ; that the expenses of the war should be defrayed by the emperor, and full securities given for the maintenance of the civil and religious liberty of the Protestant States. Wallen stein answered haughtily that it was for the emperor to give laws, and the Saxons to obey them, and prescribed conditions so imperious that war was immediately renewed. The Imperialists swept through Saxony like a desolating simoom, gathering booty at every league, burning villages, and plundering towns. Many a widow mourned for a slaughtered husband, many a father grieved for a daughter dishonoured, where passed the swift destruction of these terrible hosts !"], [386, "358 POSTSCRIPT V. 15. It was fortunate for the Protestants that Wallenstein's jealous pride prevented his active co-operation with the Bava rian Tilly. Had the two armies united, they must easily have overwhelmed the King of Denmark's forces ; but they dealt their blows separately, and consequently with less effect. Thus the campaign of 1626 opened with Tilly on the banks of the Weser, and Wallenstein on the banks of the Elbe. The latter was opposed by Count Mansfeldt, one of the ablest of the German generals, who, with an inferior force, ventured to attack the Imperialists at Dessau, and attempted to carry the bridge (April 1st to 25th). He made three assaults \u2014 on the 1st, 11th, and 25th of April ; but being attacked in the rear, received a total defeat, and suffered a loss of 3,000 killed. Broken, but not subdued, the Protestant general retired into Brandenburg, where his reinforcements soon placed him at the head of 20,000 men. With these he hurried into Silesia, to unite with tbe forces of Bethlem Gabor, in Hungary, and swoop suddenly upon Vienna. No sooner did the Imperial court gain an inkling of this daring project than Wallenstein was imperatively directed to follow in pursuit of the Count and his Condottieri. He remonstrated, but obeyed, and crossed the Carpathian mountains in a rapid and disastrous march, which cost him many soldiers, though it de feated Mansfeldt's plans. Bethlem Gabor was in want of pecuniary supplies ; Mansfeldt only brought additional troops, and an active enemy in his rear. The Transylvanian prince, therefore, con cluded peace with the emperor \u2014 to break it on the first oppor tunity \u2014 and advised Mansfeldt to repair for aid to Venice. Thither he departed, but died on his way, at Wrakowitz, in Dalmatia. 16. After a hasty visit to Vienna to rebut some complaints preferred against him by counts and princes jealous of his power and reputation, he equipped and recruited his army with his usual expedition, so that he opened the campaign of 1827 at the head of 40,000 men. His first task was to drive the Danes out of Silesia. Next he occupied the neutral territories of Branden burg, Mecklenburg, and Pomerania, declaring that it was now time to dispense with electors, and that Germany, like France and Spain, ought to be controlled by a single absolute sovereign. To prevent Tilly from sharing with him the honours and fruits of victory, he despatched him across the Elbe to watch the Dutch"], [387, "A POWERFUL SUBJECT. 359 frontiers, while he himself pursued the Danes, defeated them in a series of actions near Heiligenhausen, overran Jutland, and drove King Christian and the remnant of his army to seek safety in the islands beyond the Belt. 17. Without an enemy to oppose him, Wallenstein was left to mature his ambitious designs at leisure. He filled his coffers with the spoils of captured provinces, and augmented his army to the number of 100,000 men. All Germany was made to enrich him, his soldiers, and his emperor. Friends and enemies were pillaged with equal impartiality. The greater his exac tions, the greater the rewards of his army, and the greater the rush to join his standard, for success is never in want of followers. So his army flourished, while the states withered which they were intended to protect. It seemed his sole purpose to aggran dise the emperor by depressing the authority of other states, and Ferdinand had not the sagacity to perceive that while his general was so loyally bent on making him an absolute sove reign, he was equally decided in making himself the only authority second to the throne. Enough for him that he reigned despotically ; that his power was unquestioned from the Baltic to the Adriatic. Without looking further, he lavished honours on the man who had so served him, disregarding the cries of sorrow and indignation that were uttered by princes and peoples. He expelled one of the oldest of the German houses from their hereditary dominions that he might create his favourite Duke of Mecklenburg (February 1, 1628), transferring the duchy to him and to his successors in pledge for the repayment of three millions of florins advanced by Wallenstein for the support of the army. 18. This extraordinary man now assumed the title of gene ralissimo of the emperor by sea and land, and opened the campaign of 1628 with the capture of Weimar, which gave him a footing on the shore of the Baltic. Foreseeing the probability of an alliance between Protestant Sweden and Protestant Ger many, he endeavoured to win over Gustavus Adolphus to the Imperial cause by offering him Norway as his share of the spoil ; but meanwhile used the most active exertions to assemble a fleet which should enable him to carry the war into Denmark,or prevent a Swedish invasion of Germany. With this view he attempted the capture of the valuable port of Stralsund. \" Whatever is now"], [388, "360 POSTSCRIPT V. done,\" he wrote to his subordinate, the astute and wary Arnheim, \" must be done by sea.\" His suspicion of Gustavus Adolphus was ever active, and he appears to have had a presentiment that his star would pale before the ascendant star of the hero of Sweden. He referred to his astrological studies to ease his anxiety on this point\u2014 with what result his biographers have not acquainted us. Stralsund, he said, must be captured : \" I will take it, though it were fastened by a chain to the heavens.\" Aruheim commenced the siege on the 7th of May, but, though he pressed it with the utmost vigour, the town resisted bravely. Reinforcements reached it by sea \u2014 1,600 stalwart Swedes and British, under Count Brahe\" and the gallant David Leslie* \u2014 and the enthusiasm of patriotism fired the breasts of the heroic defenders. Wallenstein arrived before the place on the 27th of June, and, with his usual impetuosity, ordered a general assault. Some success was obtained, which, followed by a destructive bombardment, constrained the inhabitants to solicit terms. But while negotiations were proceeding, a Danish fleet arrived off the port : the citizens again took courage ; they recalled their offers of submission ; and the siege was renewed. But the fleet landing a Danish army at Jasmund, Wallenstein was compelled to raise the siege, having lost 12,000 men. He marched against the Danes, who, having effected the object of their diversion, re-embarked, and landed again at Wolgast. Here they were surprised by Wallenstein, and terribly beaten. 19. But two things were now evident to the Imperial court and its generalissimo \u2014 that without ships the war could be carried no further ; and that if Sweden aud Denmark contracted an alliance, it would be impossible, in the face of their combined fleets, to maintain a footing on the Baltic coast. It was there fore resolved that an endeavour should be made to detach Denmark from the Protestant league ; and its king, defeated, humiliated, and dispirited, gladly welcomed the overtures of the Imperial general. Wallenstein himself was secretly anxious to secure Denmark as an ally, now that, as Duke of Mecklenburg, he had become its near neighbour. He granted, therefore, the most favourable terms, and peace was concluded at Lubeck ia January, 1629. 20. Wallenstein now occupied a position of pride and power * Afterwards defeated by Cromwell at D unbar."], [389, "A SUDDEN FALL. o n 4 Ojl to which few subjects have ever attained. \" The Peace of Lubeck left him absolute master in Germany, and without an equal in greatness. His spirit seemed to hover like a storm charged cloud over- the land, crushing to the earth every hope of liberty and successful resistance. Mansfeldt and Christian of Brunswick had disappeared from the scene ; Frederick V. had retired into obscurity. Tilly and Pappenheim, his former rivals, now condescended to receive favours, and to solicit pensions and rewards, through the medium of his intercession.\" But the summer sky holds the dread bolt of Jove, and it descended upon Wallenstein in the hour of his fame and the flush of his ambition. At a Diet held at Ratisbon in 1630, the emperor found himself beset by the petitions of both Roman Catholics and Protestants, united in this \u2014 that he should dismiss Wallenstein from his command. But though they represented the enormity of his exactions, over these the great general would have triumphed. The enemies who really wrought his downfall were Maximilian of Bavaria, and Richelieu the minister of France ; and both were animated as much by hatred of Austria as by jealousy of Wallen stein. Deprive the emperor of his illustrious captain, of the man whose nod created armies, and his power would speedily dwindle before the assaults of the nations upon whose liberties Austria had trampled. But to induce the emperor to dismiss from his command a subject so potent, so splendid, and so loyal, was no easy task, and it was only effected by appealing to his personal interests. He was known to be most anxious to secure for his son Ferdinand the succession to the imperial throne, and this object he could not accomplish without the support of Maxi milian. He was known to be desirous that Ferdinand should also obtain the dignity of King of the Romans, and in this he could hardly succeed without the influence of France. The emperor was unable to cope with the subtle policy of a Richelieu, or the stern resolution of a Maximilian. He allowed himself to be deceived ; and for empty promises, easily denied or quickly retracted, sacrificed the only man in his empire who could main tain his power. 21. Wallenstein was not without warnings of the blow which impended over him ; but, confident in his resources, or presuming upon the emperor's dependent position, he took no steps to avert it. Certainly, to disgrace a man of the duke's impetuous nature"], [390, "362 POSTSCRIPT V. and aspiring genius, when at the head of 100,000 armed men who absolutely adored him, was an act of no ordinary boldness. Two of his intimate friends were selected to communicate, in the most conciliatory manner, the imperial resolve, which men gene rally supposed Wallenstein would proudly dispute ; but, to their surprise\u2014 to the astonishment of all \u2014 to the admiration of many \u2014 he received his dismissal with perfect composure. \"You may observe by the planets,\" he said, producing an astrological diagram, \" that the spirit of Maximilian predominates over the spirit of Ferdinand. I do not blame the emperor, therefore, though I may regret that he has given me up so easily ; and I shall obey.\" The pride which was so conspicuous a feature of his character may have actuated him in this mood of unwonted obedience. He may have felt a secret pleasure in showing the world how much greater he was than other men ; how indif ferently he could resign the power which so many would have yielded but with life ; how light a thing to him \u2014 Albrecht of Friedland and Mecklenburg \u2014 was the baton of an imperial gene ralissimo. His sagacity may also have told him that the emperor could not long dispense with his services, and that when they were again required it would rest with him to impose what conditions he pleased before he rendered them. 22. Having given up the command of the army, he left Memmingen on the 3rd of October, and set out for his Bohe mian estates, attended by a numerous and splendid train. There, in his retirement, he maintained a more than royal state. Six gates conducted to the palace he inhabited at Prague, and a hundred houses were pulled down to make way for its avenues and approaches. Similar mansions rose on his other domains ; and we are told that his palace at Sagan would have been one of the wonders of the world had he lived to complete it. Gentlemen of the noblest houses contended for the honour of serving him ; and the emperor's chamberlains deserted the imperial court to receive the gold keys from Wallenstein. He maintained sixty pages, who were instructed by the ablest masters. His halls and ante-chambers were guarded by fifty chosen yeomen. Not less than a hundred covers daily adorned his table \u2014 not less than a hundred carriages, and fifty led horses, accompanied him when he travelled. The richness of his liveries, the pomp of his equipages, and the decorations of his chambers, became the"], [391, "A HERO AT HOME. 363 theme of all men's wonder. Six nobles and as many knights were in constant attendance on his person, to obey his lightest command. Twelve patrols performed their regular rounds about his palace, that no noise might disturb the meditations of his restless intellect. The clang of wheels was forbidden near his residence. Every one moved in his presence silently, and with mute respect. Like most busy thinkers, he himself spoke but little ; was more prodigal of his gifts than of his words, and seldom expressed in speech the mystery of his thoughts. His dark and inscrutable countenance was rarely lit with a smile ; the wine cup never betrayed, the caress of beauty never be guiled him. Wrapped in a cold reserve or dreamy abstraction he lived his life, except when he awoke to the magnificent pro jects of his ambition. The correspondence he kept up with the whole of Europe was chiefly conducted by himself; he lived too much apart from men to trust them. For the rest, he was tall of stature, thin, of a sallow complexion, with dark hair, and small but penetrating eyes. A dark and forbidding severity ever sat upon his moody brow ; and only the profuseness of his generosity retained his throng of dependents around him. 23. In this splendid obscurity did Wallenstein await, calmly but not inactively, the hour of his revenge. It was easy to foretel that against a conqueror like Gustavus would be needed a general like Wallenstein. What political discernment predicted the stars confirmed ; and Seni, his Italian astrologer, professed to have read in the heavens that a glorious career was yet reserved for the genius and ambition of the haughty Friedland. Not one of his lofty schemes, says Schiller, had been abandoned, and the emperor's ingratitude had loosened the restraint put upon his ambition. The dazzling splendour of his retirement indicated the magnificence of his designs ; and lavish as a monarch, he seemed to count the possessions he hoped for as already within his grasp. 24. It was not long before the conclusions of Wallenstein and the astrological predictions of Seni received their confirmation. The Swedish monarch had proceeded from victory to victory ; had beaten Tilly at Leipzig,* and on the Lech ; had captured * The news of this great battle was at first discredited at Vienna. No one would believe that \" God Almighty,\" as they said profanely, \" had turned Protestant.\""], [392, "364 POSTSCRIPT V. Munich, and was threatening Vienna. The greater part of Bohemia was lost to the emperor. The Swedish standards floated triumphantly from the Elbe to the Rhine. Most of the Protestant states had declared against the imperial tyranny. The Transylvanians hovered, like a storm-boding cloud, on the Hungarian frontier. Meanwhile, the emperor's armies were disorganised and his resources exhausted ; he had neither depots nor magazines, and a terrible abyss seemed opening at his feet. It threatened to engulph for ever the fortunes of the House of Austria. The only ray of hope proceeded from a negotiation which, at the instigation of Wallenstein, had been opened with Denmark to detach her from her alliance with Sweden ; but events marched too rapidly for protocols and parchments \u2014 Gustavus was supreme from the Baltic to the Rhine. A general was needed to bring back victory to the imperial banners, if Austria would remain an European power. That general could be no other than the Duke of Friedlaud. 25. An attempt had previously been made by the emperor's councillors to make peace with Saxony, and Wallenstein's services had been called into requisition. They now appeared before him as suppliants for both an army and a general ; they could neither create the one, nor raise the other. He was not asked to take the command of an army, for none existed ; he was implored to find soldiers and equip them, and their command would necessarily devolve upon him. At first he refused. He was suffering from gout, and had become reconciled to retire ment. The imperial requests became more urgent as the imperial necessities increased ; notwithstanding the efforts of a strong party in the cabinet to give the supreme command in the field to the young King of Hungary. The more prudent, however, saw that it would be futile to oppose to the military genius of Gustavus an inexperienced King of Hungary, and the progress of events soon left the emperor no choice. He wrote with his own hand to Wallenstein, and besought him not to forsake him in the hour of adversity. The duke was disposed to yield, when it was delicately intimated that the King of Hun gary would be joined with him in authority. This was enough. \"Never,\" he exclaimed, \"will I accept a divided command, were God himself to share it with me ! No ; I must command aluae, or not at all.\""], [393, "365 AN ARMY RAISED BY A NAME. 26. The project was necessarily abandoned, but even then it seemed impossible to overcome Wallenstein's real or pretended reluctance. Accordingly, bis friend, and the emperor's favourite minister, Prince Eggeuberg, repaired in person to Znaim, to answer his objections, and to hint that it might be dangerous even for so powerful a subject to presume too far upon his sovereign's condescension. The duke then agreed to accept the command for three months; during which time he under took to raise an army of from 40,000 to 50,000 men, which he would place entirely at the emperor's disposal. The title of commander-in-chief he declined, as well as the salary of 100,000 crowns offered along with it ; but he strongly urged Eggenberg to press for the payment of 300,000 ducats, which the King of Spain had promised to contribute towards the armament. About this time he received a grant of the Duchy of Gross-Glogan, being the fourth he had acquired by grant or purchase. 27. The magic of the name of Wallenstein, it was soon apparent, had lost none of its power. Crowned heads could neither bribe nor force soldiers into their service, but an army gathered round Wallenstein, as if summoned from the earth by the stroke of an enchanter's wand. Men knew the severity of his punishments, but they also knew the largeness of his rewards ; they trusted to escape the former, and doubted not they should share the lattter. \" Many,\" says Schiller, with his customary eloquence, \"who had before fought under his standard, had been admiring witnesses of his great actions, and experienced his magnanimity, abandoned their retirement, to share with him again both booty and glory. The largeness of the pay he promised attracted thousands, and the liberal supplies the soldier was likely to enjoy at the cost of the peasant operated upon the latter as a powerful attraction to embrace the military life, instead of falling a victim to its oppressions. Every Austrian province was compelled to assist in the equipment ; no class was exempted from taxation, no rank or dignity escaped head money. The Spanish court, as well as the King of Hungary, promised to furnish a considerable sum. The imperial minis ters contributed largely ; while Wallenstein himself advanced 200,000 florins from his own treasury to expedite the arma ment. The poorer officers he supported out of his own revenues; and, by his own example, by magnificent promotions, and still"], [394, "366 POSTSCRIPT V. more magnificent promises, he induced all who were able to levy troops at their own expense. Whoever raised a corps at his own cost received the command. In the appointment of officers religion was not allowed to be an objection; and wealth, courage, skill, experience, were more considered than orthodoxy of creed.\" Thus, before the stipulated three months had ex pired, Wallenstein effected what every one had denounced as impracticable. Thousands had gathered to the standard raised by so renowned a leader ; and, well equipped and well officered, waited but his signal to prove themselves worthy of him by the splendour of their achievements. 28. The duke had fulfilled his promise, and he now retired from the scene. The emperor was free to choose a commander for the army he had raised. But we find it difficult to agree with Colonel Mitchell, that Wallenstein in this voluntary retire ment was actuated by any other motives than those of pride and ambition. He was well aware that he, and he alone, could unite in a homogeneous mass the motley materials he had got together. He knew that without the confidence they reposed in his appa rent invincibility, his fortune, and his fame, the thousands that had assembled from every part of Europe would instantly disperse. This army of snow he alone could bind into the destructive solidity of a glacier. By him it had been created, without him it would perish. Its officers were his creatures ; its hopes he only could realise. There can, then, be no doubt that in withdrawing from the command, he designed to render the emperor dependent upon his will, and to extort from his necessities the most extravagant conditions. At all events, new negotiations had to be commenced, new supplications addressed to this haughty subject. Father Quiroga, the influential con fessor of the Queen of Hungary, was first employed. He was received with courtesy, and dismissed unsatisfied. \" It was strange,\" remarked Wallenstein, \"to see kings and princes employing, in wordly affairs, men who had altogether renounced the world.\" Prince Eggenberg next appeared on the scene at Znaim. He declared that he was authorised to obtain his ser vices at any price, and the duke now found it expedient to yield; but in yielding he exacted such conditions as never before were imposed upon the most compliant sovereign in his greatest peril. It is difficult to imagine how, under any cir-"], [395, "WALLENSTEIN TREATS WITH TBE EMPEROR. 367 cumstanees, they could have been accepted by an absolute monarch. 29. \" He required the undivided control, with supreme power, of all the Austrian and Spanish troops in Germany. Neither the King of Hungary nor the emperor were to appear with the army ; still less to exercise over it any act of authority. The emperor was to dispose of no military commission, to confer no reward, nor was any pardon which he might grant to be valid without the sanction of the Duke of Friedland. Whatever might be conquered and confiscated was to be appropriated at the sole will and pleasure of the commander-in-chief, to the exclusion of every other authority. For his ordinary pay an imperial here ditary estate was to be assigned him ; as an extraordinary reward, he was to receive one of the conquered provinces (Moravia?) within the empire. Every Austrian territory was to be opened for the reception of the army if retreat became necessary. On the conclusion of peace he was to be confirmed in the possession of the duchy of Mecklenburg ; and a timely and formal notice was to be given should it be thought expedient for the second time to deprive him of the command.\" 30. These conditions were complied with, though their effect was to make Wallenstein the ally of the emperor rather than his subject, and though they deprived the emperor of all control over the forces levied in his name, and intended for his service. That he designed them as essential to the successful accomplish ment of the plan of rebellion which his enemies accuse him of having formed, can hardly be doubtful. His apologist, indeed, pretends that in demanding such exclusive authority he was solely anxious to ensure the success of his military operations. \"A commander in the field,\" he says, \" can hardly possess too much authority; and any interference exercised, from a distance, over an army by cabinets and ministers is sure to prove injurious.\" But Wallenstein might have guarded against such interference without imposing upon his sovereign terms the most arbitrary and unjustifiable. We fear that his conduct can only be explained by supposing him to have meditated the establishment of an independent kingdom. No success in the field could raise him higher as a subject than he was already. He had wealth, rank, dignity, honour. The next step in his prosperous career must be to exchange his ducal coronet for a regal crown."], [396, "368 POSTSCRIPT V. 31. At all events, the army had now a commander-in-chief worthy of the name. Every other authority, even that of the emperor himself, ceased from the moment the duke's hand grasped his baton, and every act became invalid which did not proceed from him. The life-giving ascension of this new star was felt like the dawn of a summer day from the banks of the Danube to the shores of the Baltic. Men's energies awoke, men's hopes were stimulated, or their fears aroused. Everywhere spread life and action and movement : the Papists made ready to attack, the Protestants prepared to defend. A new influence penetrated the contending nations. For awhile the interest of the drama had lagged, but now a great actor appeared upon the stage, and all eyes were turned towards the scene in terror, or in admiration. The King of Sweden was to meet a rival not unworthy of his genius ; and the war from that moment seemed to assume a novel character. 32. The first triumph of the new general was a personal one, and was afforded him at the expense of his former opponent, whose influence had procured his dismissal from the command when first Gustavus led his Swedes into Germany. He required the junction of the Bavarian troops with his own to take place at Egra, whither the Elector Maximilian was forced to repair \u2014 to leave his own territories exposed to the ravages of the enemy, while he appeared before his haughty rival as a suppliant for relief. Both were now compelled to repress their feelings of wounded pride, and met and embraced in the presence of the two armies; but it was remarked that the Elector of Bavaria was more perfect in the art of dissimulation than the Duke of Friedland : the latter was too proud, too self-reliant, to play the hypocrite. 33. The Imperial and Bavarian forces amounted, in the aggre gate, to 60,000 or 70,000 experienced troops, and formed the most numerous army which had appeared in Europe since the time of Charles V. Wallenstein immediately led them into the Upper Palatinate, determined to attack the King of Sweden. Gustavus, at the head of 20,000 men, could not hope to meet him in the open field. He had, therefore, but two courses open to him \u2014 either to throw himself into Nuremberg, and run the risk of being shut up within its walls, or sacrifice that city, and await the arrival of reinforcements under the guiis of Donau werth. He chose the former, for Nuremberg was of the highest"], [397, "369 THE CAMP OF NUREMBERG. value in a strategical point of view. Situated almost in the centre of Germany, it covered his conquests on the Rhine, the Danube, and the Maine, and protected his communications with his allies and territories in the north. To compensate for his inferiority in numbers, he raised a formidable series of entrench ments, and surrounded the whole with a fosse, eight feet deep and twelve broad. The lines were defended by redoubts and batteries ; the gates by half-moons ; and from the ramparts frowned upwards of 300 pieces of cannon. The enceinte was not less than six miles. The river Pegnitz flowing through the city divided the camp into two semicircles, whose communication was preserved by bridges. Soldiers and citizens laboured at these works with so good a will that before Wallenstein could complete his march from the Bohemian frontier, the Swedish position was unassailable. 34. The duke made no attempt to force it. \" Battles enough,\" he said, \" had been fought already ; it was now time to try another method.\" The Swedish lines could not have been carried without a terrible loss of life, and he resolved to subdue by famine those who defied him with arms. Accordingly, he took up an admirable position about five miles to the south-west of Nuremberg, which enabled him to cut off most of the king's supplies. He erected there a formidable camp. But, ignorant of the resources which had been accumulated by Gustavus, he soon found himself in danger of the fate to which he sought to expose his enemy. The Swedes, active and adventurous, sur prised at night his principal magazine at Frienstadt ; and an escort of 4,000 men, under Colonel Spar, sent out to protect the convoy, was cut to pieces. This success not only caused a great want of provisions in Wallenstein's camp, but had a depressing effect on the spirits of the Croats ; and it was only by a brilliant attack on a Swedish detachment that Colonel Isolan, their com mander, could restore their courage. Wallenstein, sensible of the importance of maintaining their confidence, rewarded the action splendidly. \" Isolan received 4,000 crowns for his share, together with a fine horse, and was, as usual on such occasions, invited to dinner. Wallenstein never appeared at the splendid table which he kept. It was presided over by Count Michna, the commissary-general, who could encourage the boisterous conviviality of the period, which the presence of the stately and B B"], [398, "370 POSTSCRIPT V. reserved Duke of Friedland would only have checked. Before the party separated, Isolan, who was a merry companion and a gambler\", had lost at play both horse and money. A page imme diately placed 2,000 ducats before him. The hussar instantly ran to the apartment of the general to return thanks for such extreme generosity. Wallenstein, without seeming to notice the subject, only pointed to a report, just received, that a Swedish convoy was on its way from Wartzburg to Nuremberg. Isolan took the hint, and, collecting his men, sallied forth in search of the enemy. He managed so well that he defeated the escort, took 200 prisoners, three standards, and 200 waggons loaded with provisions.\" 35. It would be easy to multiply instances of the duke's peculiar management of his subordinates. When forming his army at Znaim, he issued an order directing that red sashes only should be worn for the future. A young officer immediately tore from his shoulder, and trampled under foot, a richly embroi dered scarf which had been his pride and boast. Wallenstein, when he heard of it, promoted him immediately. A horseman, having lost his cuirass, was disgraced before the whole regiment. An officer who refused to accept a challenge was dismissed from the army. Another, who, even in the duke's presence, drew his sword upon a man who had insulted him, was rewarded. One day, when riding out, a soldier taken in the very act of plun dering was brought before him. \" Hang up the wretch,\" said Wallenstein, and moved forwards. The soldier, aware that a doom from the general's lip was irrevocable, drew his sword, and rushed upon him, exclaiming, \" If I am to die, I will at least die guilty.\" He was instantly disarmed, but Wallenstein pardoned him. \" Let him go,\" he said ; \" he has been suffi ciently frightened.\" A private soldier, having been promoted for an act of gallantry, omitted to return thanks. When the omission was brought to Wallenstein's notice, he declared him self flattered by the circumstance, as it proved that the man was conscious of having only received his due. 36. For fifteen days had the two armies remained in sight of each other, when the arrival of his long-expected reinforce ments enabled Gustavus to assume the offensive. He was now at the head of nearly 70,000 men, and with these he determined upon attacking the Imperial position. He was the more eager"], [399, "TOE ALTE FESTE. 371 to employ his forces in some important enterprise from the scarcity of provisions which so vast a host experienced, and the excesses which were thereby occasioned. On the 22nd of August he erected three strong batteries on the banks of the Rednitz, and cannonaded the Imperialists the whole day, but without effect. Wallenstein remained immoveable, only replying to the Swedish guns by a similar fire. His plan was to reduce his enemy by famine, and nothing could alter his determination \u2014 neither the impatience of his army, the representations of Maxi milian, nor the entreaties of his friends. Gustavus, unable to force him to a battle, was compelled by his necessities, and stimulated by his ardour, to storm a position which nature and science had made impregnable. 37. Having crossed the Rednitz at Ftirth, he found himself opposite the hill of the Alte Feste, or Old Fortress \u2014 the key of Wallenstein's position. It was fortified with palisadoes and deep trenches, redoubts and breast-works, and armed with a hundred pieces of cannon. This formidable post Gustavus determined to attack, and led his men to the assault on the morning of the 20th of August. Two thousand musketeers were foremost in the advance ; followed and supported by divi sions of spearmen, who, on different points, attempted to force the entrenchments. Furious was the assault ; the resistance obsti nate. The Germans faced steel and fire with calm impertur bability, but the guns of the Imperialists opened yawning chasms in their ranks, and the heavy cavalry swept them down like a whirlwind. With the loss of a hundred dead they fell back. Gustavus sent a regiment of Swedes to take their place, but the Norse ardour could do no more than the Teutonic courage, and though a fresh detachment was brought to the attack every hour, the Imperial position remained unshaken. 38. Wallenstein was everywhere in the hottest of the fire, and had his horse shot under him while driving some fugitive soldiers back to their post. Nor was his great opponent more chary of his person ; a musket ball tore away part of his boot. Bernard of Weimar, whose horse was also killed, particularly distinguished himself. The loss of the Imperialists was about 400 ; that of the Swedes about 2,000 ; but the action decided nothing. The Swedish army retired unpursued, and the Im perialists remained undisturbed in their original position. B B 2"], [400, "372 POSTSCRIPT V. 39. For fourteen days after this action, the two armies re mained in front of each other, each hoping that his antagonist would be the first to yield. Every day reduced their provisions, a^d the increasing distress, in the Swedish camp especially, broke up all the influence of discipline. For eleven weeks the town of Nuremberg had made great exertions and endured great sacrifices to support the vast hosts compressed within its boun daries. But now its resources were exhausted, and even Gus tavus was obliged to acknowledge that a retreat was inevitable. He had already lost 12,000 men. The surrounding fields were trampled into a swamp, the villages reduced to ashes, and the peasantry, plundered of all their property, had sought shelter in the recesses of the woods. Placing a garrison of 5,000 men in Nuremberg, under General Kniphausen, he quitted his lines, but with all the pomp of a victor, with drums beating and ban ners flying ; and so, passing slowly in front of the Imperial entrenchments, he proceeded to Neustadt. Wallenstein accepted the defiance with calm indifference, and remained immoveable on his hills, while the Swedes went on their way unimpeded. 40. As the Imperial leader has often been censured for not delivering an attack upon the retiring enemy, we may present the reader with the opinion of an experienced officer, Lieut- Colonel Mitchell. \" Judging of these remarkable events,\" he says, \" from all the information we can now collect, we are bound to say that his conduct, so far from deserving censure, appears, on the contrary, to merit the very highest praise. To have attacked tried and experienced soldiers like the Swedes, posted behind works so formidable as those thrown up round Nuremberg, would have been rushing on almost certain defeat. When, with their assembled army, they defied him to combat on the open plain, he was more than justified by circumstances in declining the challenge, howerful painful to the feelings of a proud man must have been the taunts to which he exposed himself from friends and foes. But Wallenstein knew his game and played it resolutely, in defiance of all the efforts made to shake his purpose ; and his firmness alone proved him far supe rior to Tilly at Leipzig. In numbers and bravery, the two armies may have been nearly equal ; but the Swedes had great tactical advantages. They were accustomed to act together ; above all, they were accustomed to conquer, and placed the"], [401, "373 PROGRESS OF THE CAMPAIGN. most unbounded confidence in themselves, their officers, and their sovereign ; and to have risked a field battle against such troops, with a newly raised army, however brave, must have been precarious at all times, but would have been criminal at such a moment. The Swedes, masters of all the fortresses from Colberg on the distant Baltic, to Mayence on the Rhine, were too firmly based to suffer any great loss from a reverse sustained under the walls of Nuremberg. To the Imperial party, on the other hand, defeat must have been' ruinous. Wallenstein's army was their last stay, and its overthrow would have cost the emperor his crown, the Elector of Bavaria his dominions, and must have rendered the Protestant religion dominant in Ger many : ultimately, perhaps, in Europe. And, as nearly all the chances of battle were in favour of Gustavus, we are not assert ing too much when we say that it was the prudence of the Duke of Friedland which alone saved the Catholic power from entire destruction.\" 41. Five days after the king's departure from Nuremberg, Wallenstein broke up his camp at Zirndorf, and set it on fire. A hundred spires of flame ascending from the villages in the neighbourhood announced to the citizens his retreat. He directed his march on Bamberg, where he separated from the Elector of Bavaria \u2014 who was recalled to the defence of his own country \u2014 and renewed the prosecution of his plan to separate Saxony from its alliance with Sweden. He penetrated into the very heart of the country, and captured Leipzig on the 23rd of October. Here he was joined, as he had imperatively commanded, by Pappen heim's corps. The King of Sweden was much alarmed when he heard of Wallenstein's successful movements; for he knew the vacillating character of John George, the Elector of Saxony. He hurried, therefore, from the south to protect his uncertain ally, and retain him in his allegiance. At Erfurth the king effected a junction with the Duke of Weimar, and from thence advanced so rapidly that he seized Nanmberg before Wallen stein could reinforce the detachment which garrisoned it. The Im perial leader, on receiving this intelligence, immediately counter marched, with the design of falling upon the Swedes before they could form a junction with the Saxons. But on arriving before Naumberg, he found that Gustavus had strongly entrenched him self, and any attempt to force his camp could only result in a failure."], [402, "374 POSTSCRIPT V. 42. Under these circumstances, Wallenstein ordered his generals to assemble, and deliberate on the best plan to be pursued. None of them deemed it advisable to attempt so advantageous a position. On the other hand, they considered that the king would not have formed so strong a camp with any intention of quickly abandoning it. Their advice, therefore, was that the army should go into winter quarters, while Count Pappenheim marched upon Halle, and proceeded to relieve Koln, which was threatened by the Dutch. The advice was adopted. Pappenheim was despatched with a body of between 1,600 and 1,800 troops, and the remainder of the army went into cantonments. The result was \u2014 the battle of Liitzen, which we have described with some degree of fullness in the pre ceding pages. 43. That the Imperialists were completely defeated at Liitzen, Wallenstein himself acknowledged by retiring, on the following day, from Leipzig, and continuing his retreat until he placed his army in secure winter-quarters behind Bohemia's rampart of rugged hills. He then proceeded to deal out his vengeance upon those who had misconducted themselves in the fight at Liitzen, executing some eleven or twelve cavalry officers ;* and to reward, with his accustomed magnificence, the brave and deserving.-)- In all Catholic countries, however, Liitzen was claimed as a victory for the Imperialists, and the Te Deum was duly sung. The emperor wrote to his general with his own hand to acknowledge his courage and conduct. But as Wallenstein frankly said, when speaking of the slain Gustavus, \" It was well for him and the king that the latter was gone ; there was not room enough in Germany for both their heads.\" Now, indeed, that the Swedish hero had passed away from the scene which had shone so brilliantly with the lustre of his genius, there was no actor on the stage to fill the eye of the spectators except the haughty and inscrutable Wallenstein, and he may almost be forgiven if he allowed his ambition to beguile him from the path of duty, and to point, as to the only prize worthy of his sword, to the crown of an independent king. 41. With an army raised by fresh levies to the strength of * At Prague, on the 4th of February, 1633. t He gave away in presents no less a sum than 100,000 crowns, equal to about \u00a3t0,0C0 ot the present value of money."], [403, "PERSONAL DETAILS. 375 40,000 men, well provided and splendidly equipped, Wallenstein again took the field on the 5th of May, 1633. The pomp with which he quitted Prague has been described by an eye-witness : \"The train announced the man who, in power and splendour, vied even with the emperor himself. The procession consisted of fourteen carriages, each drawn by six horses : twenty cava liers of rank attended on Wallenstein's own person ; and 120 livery servants followed in the suite. All the court attendants were dressed in new scarlet and blue uniforms ; and ten trum peters, sounding their silver-gilt trumpets, opened the way. All the baggage waggons were covered with gilt leather; the greatest order prevailed in the establishment, and every person knew exactly what was his place, and what were his duties. The duke himself was dressed in a horseman's buff coat ; and the entire scene resembled more a victor's triumph then the march of a lately baffled commander.\"* 45. Count Gualdo, who was long in Wallenstein's service, says, that \" in the field, his usual dress was a buff or elk-skin coat, red hose, a red scarf, a scarlet cloak, and a grey castor hat adorned with red feathers. He always wore boots and spurs, and never appeared without the order of the Golden Fleece, which the King of Spain had conferred upon him. In the latter years of his life, he suffered greatly from gout, walked with difficulty, and was forced to lean on a bamboo cane for support. His dislike of noise was such, that he could not bear the barking of dogs, nor the clatter of the large spurs then in fashion. Actions of spirit and enterprise were sure to meet with his approbation, even when bordering on extravagance. Wit. promptness, and originality were passports to his favour ; but the qualities be valued most in military men were pride, ambi tion, daring, and resolution. He had a marked aversion to regular court jesters, as well as to buffoons of every kind ; but men of genius and talent were sure of his friendship and protection. He was a firm friend to the soldiers, and never lost an opportunity of speaking in their favour. In rewarding or promoting officers, he was guided solely by the merit of the candidates, and never influenced by family connections, or by recommendations from men of rank, not even by those of the emperor himself.\" 46. Wallenstein, on taking the field, moved a part of his army * Cited in Mitchell's Life of Wallenstein."], [404, "376 POSTSCRIPT V. into Silesia, not to clear it of the victorious Saxons, but to con clude an armistice, and enter into negotiations with them. His object appears to have been to assume the position of an arbiter between the contending parties, and he probably thought that peace might better be obtained by sparing than vanquishing the Saxons. In concluding that peace, his wealth, power, and influence would enable him to secure the object of his wishes, the crown of Bohemia. In his conferences with the Saxon leaders he plainly revealed his intentions. He was come, he said, to conclude a permanent peace with the Swedes, and with the princes of the empire, to pay the soldiers, and to satisfy every one. All this was in his power; and if the Austrian court hesi tated to confirm his agreement, he would unite with the Allies, and hunt the emperor to the devil. To Count Thurn, he said all the privileges of the Bohemians should be confirmed anew, the exiles recalled and restored to their estates, and he himself would be the first to resign his share of them. The Jesuits, whom he denounced as the authors of all past grievances, should be banished, the Swedish crown indemnified by regular pay ments, and the superfluous troops on both sides directed against the Turks. If, he added, he should obtain the crown of Bohemia, all the exiles should have reason to applaud his generosity. Every religion should be tolerated within his kingdom, the Palatine family regain its rights, and he would accept the Mar gravate of Moravia as a compensation for the Duchy of Mecklen burg. The allied armies would then, under his command, advance upon Vienna, and with the thunder of their guns compel the emperor to ratify the treaty. 47. Rumours of his ambitious designs had not failed to reach the imperial court, which already was indignant at his inactivity, and surprised by his anxiety for peace. He was, however, too powerful as yet to be struck at openly, nor could the emperor immediately dispense with the army he commanded. A Spanish force was therefore assembled by degrees at Milan, and marched into Germany under a Spanish general. Though the duke felt the full importance of this dexterous movement, which rendered him no longer indispensable to the emperor, he could not effec tually oppose it, and was even compelled to despatch to this new army a reinforcement under General Altringer. But it aroused him from his security to a full sense of the peril of his position."], [405, "THE DANGER RIPENS. 377 He took immediate steps to strengthen it. That he might not a second time be deprived of his command he secured the attachment of his troops by removing all officers of doubtful fidelity, and liberally rewarding the faithful. And the negotia tions he had opened with Saxony promising no favourable result, he resumed military operations with a sudden vigour. He surrounded Count Thurn with 2,500 Swedes, and compelled them to capitulate. He captured Leignitz, Grosslogan, and Frankfort on the Oder. Silesia was subjugated; Colonel Ulo threatened Pomerania ; Wallenstein himself broke into Lusatia, and seized Goerlitz and Bautzen. He was then constrained, by the repeated remonstrances of the imperial court, to move to the protection of Bavaria, which the Swedes had occupied in force, and ravaged with sword and fire. But hearing of an inroad of the Saxons into Bohemia, he availed himself of the pretext to retire into that kingdom, and when the emperor commanded him to march towards the Danube, to prevent the Duke of Weimar from establishing himself in so dangerous a position on the Austrian frontier, he thought proper to conclude the campaign, and put his army into winter quarters. 48. The emperor could no longer endure the insolence of his general, whose loyalty he had now good reason to suspect. The Elector of Bavaria threatened to unite with the Swedes, if the command was not withdrawn from the hands of his powerful enemy, and the court of Spain declared that it would no longer furnish any subsidies. Ferdinand therefore determined on his dismissal. Aware of the peril impending over him, the duke now hastened to execute the plans long since devised by his ambitious genius. He had checked the impatience of his ad herents by declaring that the time was not yet come ; that the aspect of the stars was unfavourable to his project ; but he could no longer wait for the stars, and it seemed as if circumstance was more powerful than fate. His principal councillors were Colonels Terzky, Kinsky, and Mo ; but it had become necessary for him to reveal\" his project to General Count Piccolomini, aud assure him self of the devotion of his officers and men. The count listened to the communication with indignant astonishment, but betraying no ano-er to the eyes of the watchful duke, he affected to place his services entirely at his chief's disposal. From Wallenstein's liberal hand he had received the highest honours and most extra-"], [406, "378 POSTSCRIPT V. vagant rewards, but the traitor can never depend upon the fidelity of others, and as Wallenstein betrayed his emperor, so Piccolo mini betrayed his chief. He disclosed the plot to the court of Vienna, and agreed to become its tool and instrument. 49. It was now that the emperor despatched his minister of war, Questenberg, to Prague, to induce Wallenstein to place his troops in other winter quarters than in the Bohemian terri tory. If that should not be found feasible, he was required to furnish the emperor with a state of their distribution, that his Majesty might, according to ancient custom, arrange with the provincial authorities for their reception, to prevent the quarters from being made good by violence : \" a mode of proceeding,\" wrote the emperor, \" by which our high authority is diminished, and foreign nations are induced to suppose that we possess but a divided power in our own dominions, and have a corrival \u2014cnrregem \u2014 on our throne.\" This proposal was submitted by the duke to a council of officers, who received it with disdain, and met it with a counter complaint of irregular payment, hinting that the army might soon become disgusted with the treatment it was made to experience. 50. Meanwhile, the duke received information that Ferdinand had determined to dismiss him from his command, and place the army under Lieutenant-General Gallas until a new generalissimo could be appointed. It was necessary, therefore, that whatever was done should be done quickly. Field-Marshal Mo under took to secure the allegiance of the troops, and for this purpose invited the principal officers to a banquet, where he persuaded some and terrified others into affixing their signatures to a peti tion which solicited Wallenstein to remain at the head of the army, and pledged him their services as long as he should con tinue to command it in the name and for the good of the emperor. Amongst those who subscribed was Piccolomini, still nourishing in his heart the design to betray his commander. It is said, indeed, that on this memorable occasion two documents were made use of; that the one which was read aloud contained the clause we have italicised, while, in the other, which was signed by men bemused with the liberal wine cup, it was purposely omitted. But the evidence on which this statement rests is not trustworthy, and the stratagem itself seems too simple for Wal lenstein to have countenanced it."], [407, "379 WHEELS WITHIN WHEELS. 51. Nothing now remained but to secure the adhesion of the generals absent with important corps\u2014 Gallas, Altringer, aud Colloredo ; in case of refusal, to seize their persons. Some intima tion of what was intended reached their ears, and Altringer and Colloredo forbore to present themselves at Pilsen, where the duke had now established his headquarters. Gallas repaired thither, but merely as the confidential servant of the emperor to watch his rebellious subject's proceedings. While these wheels within wheels were thus busily revolving, Ferdinand maintained a friendly correspondence with the duke, each endeavouring to deceive the other. The difficulty which perplexed the emperor and his advisers was the disposal of Wallenstein, for his power and ambition rendered it dangerous to allow him to remain at liberty. \" This business,\" said the emperor, \" is never out of my thoughts : it rises with me in the morning, and goes to bed with me at night, and completely deprives me of rest.\" At length, on the 24th of January, 1634, he furnished Gallas and Piccolo mini with a secret commission, depriving Wallenstein of the command, and directing officers and soldiers to obey only those two generals. He further granted an amnesty to all who had signed the contract at Pilsen, except Mo and Terzky, and declared the Duke of Friedland an outlaw, commanding him to be taken \" dead or alive.\" 52. It would seem that Wallenstein at this time trembled before the perils which he himself had created, and on the 20th of February, again calling his officers together, he signed, in con cert with them, a declaration expressive of their entire devotion to the emperor, and their resolution to shed every drop of their blood in his service. \" As every hour now brought proof that hostile proceedings were already in progress, he despatched Colonel Mohrwald to Vienna on the 21st, and General Brenner on the 22nd, to assure the emperor of his perfect readiness to resign the command, and to appear at any place and time to answer whatever charges might be preferred against him. Both messengers were arrested on the road, the one by Piccolomini, the other by Diodati ; the latter declaring, in his official report of the circumstance, that the message to the emperor was only a trick advised by Wallenstein to save ' isuoi ducati.'\" But it is probable that these ducati were no slight inducements to the zealous loyalty of Count Piccolomini and his confreres in treachery."], [408, "380 POSTSCRIPT V. 53. The full extent of the dangers which slowly but surely gathered their circle of fire around him, Wallenstein at length dis covered. At length he found that the stars had played him false in the predictions with which he had nourished his ambition, and that even the \" bright planetary influence\" is of no avail against the wrath of kings. He learned that Piccolomini was marching upon Pilsen with an army to surprise him ; that Prague was gar risoned against him by General Guys ; that Gallas had declared himself the imperial generalissimo, and everywhere exacted the obedience of the soldiers ; that few of those who had signed the famous contract remained faithful to his declining fortunes. He determined, therefore, to fly to Egra (February 22, 1630), and throw himself into the arms of the allies ; and Oxenstiern and Arnheim, aware of his necessities and confident now of his sincerity, offered him protection. On the part of Saxony, the Duke Francis Albert of Saxe Lauenberg was to join him with 4,000 men ; and Duke Bernard of Weimar, and the Palatine Christian of Birkenfield, with 6,000 from Sweden, all veteran troops. 54. On Wallenstein's arrival at Egra, he learned that the decree had been issued which proclaimed him a traitor, and set a price upon his head. But his proud spirit abated not one jot of hope, nor did he abandon even in thonght his projects of aggrandisement and vengeance. He never showed himself more truly great, or worthier of his splendid fame, than now in the shadow and the cloud, when the sun of his destiny was rapidly setting in a sea of blood. That which was heroic in his nature was now revealed, and he shook off the lesser qualities of his character, as the oak in the rush of the crashing tempest abandons its weaker boughs and lighter sprays, only to withstand the elemental shock with unyielding firmness. At Egra he was guarded by seven companies of foot and 200 dragoons, under the orders of Colonel Butler, an Irish Catholic officer, who assured his leader of his unfaltering devotion, while he sent similar assurances to the emperor. There was also present in the town the regiment of Terzky, under Lieut.-Colonel Gordon and Major Leslie. These, while ignorant of the emperor's pro clamation, agreed to accompany the duke to the allied quarters, but on communicating with Butler, suddenly altered their reso lution, and the lust of gold overcoming their love of honour,"], [409, "MURDER OF WALLENSTEIN. 381 consented to join him in an act of the blackest treachery. At first they only meditated the seizure of the duke's person, but learniug the rapid approach of the allies to his assistance, they resolved upon murder, and arranged to perpetrate the foul deed at a banquet to be given by Butler in the castle of Egra. Seven other officers, Geraldine, Devereux, Brown, Macdonald, Birch, Pestalugi, and Lerda, joined the conspirators. As Count Mo, Terzky, Kinsky, and Neumann were to sup with Gordon in the citadel, it was agreed to commence with them. Previous to their arrival, trusty guards were posted at every outlet, and six dragoons, with Captain Devereux, concealed in an apartment close to the banqueting-room, who, at a given signal, were to rush in and kill the \"traitors.\" The supper passed right merrily, and the wine circulated as freely as the jest. Wallenstein's health was drunk in full bumpers, not as a servant of the emperor, but a sovereign prince. The dessert was brought in, and then the murder-signal given. Suddenly the hall filled with armed men, shouting \" Viva la casa d'Austria.\" Butler, Gordon, and Leslie sprang from their seats, exclaiming \" Vivat Ferdinandus,\" and all rushed, like bloodhounds, on their doomed victims. Kinsky and Terzky fell at once ; Mo was stabbed through the back in attempting to reach his sword, which hung against the wall ; Neumann escaped into the court, but not knowing the counter sign, was cut down by the guard. 55. Thus was concluded the first act of the tragedy. Before entering upon another the murderers held a hurried conference. They had seized all the gates of Egra, and guarded every avenue to Wallenstein's residence by numerous bodies of troops, but yet they hesitated to rush with murder on their swords into the presence of their general. A mysterious grandeur was still associated with his character. He was their leader in battle, their chief in council, and his fortune and his genius seemed to invest him with a sanctity which it was sacrilege to profane. But they had gone too far to retreat. The allies were rapidly marching upon Egra, and their arrival would reinstate Wallen stein in his place of power, when assuredly his vengeance would fall heavily upon the murderers of his friends. Not alone the hope of reward, but their personal safety now prompted their eager blades. Towards midnight they hastened to the hero's palace."], [410, "382 POSTSCRIPT V. 56. While murder and conspiracy thus stalked through the streets of Egra, Wallenstein was occupied in reading the stars with Seni. \" The peril is not yet over,\" said the astrologer, with something of the spirit of prophecy. \" It is,\" replied the duke, whose pride would fain have controlled even destiny itself; and either feeling or affecting perfect confidence, he retired to bed. The servant who had unrobed him was descending the stairs when he met Devereux and his bravoes, and desired them to make less noise, as the duke was going to sleep. \" Friend,\" said Devereux, \" it is time to awake him ;\" and bursting open the door of the bed-chamber, he entered, followed by the hal berdiers. Wallenstein was standing by the window, leaning on a table ; wakened by the cries of the Countesses Terzky and Kinsky, when they received the news of their husbands' fate, he had rushed to the casement to call the guard. \" Art thou the villain,\" cried Devereux, \" who would yield the emperor's troops to the enemy, and tear the crown from his anointed head ? \" In this supreme moment of mortal peril Wallenstein was true to the traditions of his whole life. He disdained to parley with an assassin, but throwing wide his arms received the traitor's halbert in his heart, and sank, dead, without a groan. 57. Thus terminated the career of one of the most remark- able characters in European history, bequeathing to posterity as an enigma the secret of his life, his marvellous rise, his in scrutable ambition, his wonderful fall.

THE CONSPIRACY OF WALLENSTEIN. 1. The Conspiracy of Wallenstein, which had for its object the dismember ment of the Austrian Empire, and the erection of Bohemia into a separate kingdom, whose crown was intended for his own brow, is attended by circum stances which seem worthy of a fuller examination than the limits of our text allowed. 2. As to the mysterious hero of this tragic drama, we may be permitted to add to the character outlined in the preceding pages a few graphic touches from the pen of Monsieur Sarrasin, who wrote within a few years of his death : \u2014 \" Albert Wallenstein,\" he says, \" had a bold and adventurous mind, but a mind restless, and incapable of inaction ; a vigorous frame, tall of stature, and a countenance more majestic than agreeable. He was naturally very temperate, sleeping but little, always at work, enduring with ease both cold and hunger, avoiding pleasures, and conquering the inconveniences of the gout and age by temperance and exercise. He spoke little, but thought much ; conducted all his own correspondence; was brave and of good judgment in war, skilful in the organisation and provision of armies, severe in the infliction of punishment upon his soldiers, but lavish in rewarding them \u2014 not, however, without discrimination and design ; always unsubdued by misfortune ; courteous, when courtesy was needful, but otherwise proud and haughty ; ambitions without measure, envious of the glory of others, jealous of his own ; implacable in hatred, cruel in revenge, quick to anger, prone to magnificence, novelty, and ostentation ; extravagant in appearance, but doing nothing without an object; never wanting in pretences of the public good, although he made everything contribute to the increase of his fortune ; despising religion, which he made subservient to policy ; crafty to the utmost, and principally in a semblance of disinterestedness ; for the rest, very watchful of the designs of others, and sagacious in detecting them ; circumspect in the conduct of his own, and especially skilful in their concealment ; and so much the more impenetrable from his affectation in public of frankness and candour, and the reproaches he levelled at others for the dissimulation which he himself practised in everything. This man, having carefully studied the maxims and conduct of those who from a private condition arrived at a regal crown, cherished none but lofty thoughts and elevated aspirations, despising those who contented themselves with mediocrity. In whatever condition fortune placed him, he hungered after a further advancement ; and, at last, having attained to such a point of grandeur that there was nothing beyond him but a crown, had the boldness to dream of usurping that of Bohemia from the emperor, and although he knew that this design was full of peril and perfidy, he despised the danger which he had never failed to conquer, aud considered every action honour-"], [413, "THE CONSPIRACY OF WALLENSTEIN. 385 able when it tended to advance his projects of ambition. It is true that his ambition, and the conjunction of affairs and of the accidents of fortune, repre senting to him his enterprise as just and feasible, finally incited him to carry it out.\" 3. Upon the Memoires du Cardinal de Richelieu we base the following particu lars : \u2014 The need which the Emperor had of Wallenstein in his war with Sweden and Germany, compelled him (as we have seen) to grant the extraordinary condi tions in the office of generalissimo which the Duke of Friedland demanded, from a fear that he would not serve him with the success desired if they were not accorded. He promised him that he should remain commander-in-chief with the most absolute power, and that not only of the imperial armies, but also of those of the house of Austria and the crown of Spain ; and that he would never take the field in person, nor assume the command of his forces, but trust them wholly to Wallenstein. This grand gift of supreme authority, the esteem in which the emperor held him, the vast wealth which he had acquired, the great deeds which through fortune or prudence he had achieved, excited against him the envy of all the imperial courtiers and captains, and his natural antipathy to the Spanish drew upon him the hatred of all the ministers and adherents of Spain at the imperial court. They put the worst interpretation upon his actions, they attributed every misfortune to his errors or malice ; if any felicitous event occurred, they supposed that he had diminished its importance, or that it would have assumed greater dimensions if he had willed it. The period during which he remained in front of the army of the King of Sweden at Nuremberg, they asserted that he prolonged expressly to lengthen out the war, and render himself indispensable. They said that he fought the battle of Liitzen because compelled by the superior strategy of Gustavus, and that the success which followed it was owing to chance, or the good fortune of the emperor, rather than to his military genius. They accused him of favouring the Protestants, of receiving them into his territories, and erecting a Protestant church in one of the towns of his duchy. They asserted that he had prolonged the truce with the Elector of Saxony to the disadvantage of the emperor, inasmuch as he had had the electoral dominions at his mercy ; that he moved with precision in crises of the war when the utmost celerity was urgent ; that having captured Captain Dubalt, a Swede, he had given him an opportunity of escaping, and had released the aged Comte de la Tour, that he might recover three castles which he possessed within his province. They further remarked upon the suspicion which accrued to the numerous envoys he despatched to the Electors of Saxony and Brandenburg. 4. At first the emperor turned a deaf ear to these insinuations ; by degrees he grew accustomed to listen to them ; then he allowed himself to suspect his power ful servant ; and finally, by a peculiar condition of the authority of the ministers of princes, which rarely lasts long or endures until death \u2014 either because they weary of a man to whom, having given too much, no further presents can be made, or because they are ill inclined towards those who, having served them faithfully, deserve aU the recompense they are capable of bestowing \u2014 from suspicion he passed to belief. The emperor immediately fixed upon a person to share the authority which he had given Wallenstein. He decided at first upon the Duke de Feria ; but the duke dying, he took the resolution of appointing his son, the King of C C"], [414, "386 NOTE. Hungary, to the command. Wallenstein, who had been warned of the suspicions of the emperor, received information of this important resolution ; he endeavoured to secure the imperial confidence by fresh proofs of fidelity. Knowing how the Protestants esteemed him, and how anxious they were to secure him for their party, he suffered Count de Kinsky to listen to their propositions, and immediately receiving a carte blanche from Saxony and Brandenburg, he sent their letters and their promises to the emperor, to show how far he was from renouncing his service. But at last, perceiving that all he could do was unable to recover the imperial favour, or shake the imperial design of placing the King of Hungary in command of the army ; fearing that, after having deprived him of his authority, the emperor would seek to deprive him of liberty and life, he endeavoured to secure for his defence the battalions which gathered round his standard, and turn against his enemies the arms which he had hitherto gloriously employed in the imperial service. He assembled the principal officers of the army at Pilsen, on the 12th of January, 1630, exposed to them the credulity of the emperor towards the flatterers who surrounded him, the unjust treatment which he had received, his intended departure from his plighted faith, and declared that it would better become him to anticipate it, and relieve himself of his high office. This inten tion they all opposed, and begged him to retain his post, as a thing needful for the public welfare and the imperial service, and for their own satisfaction and private fortunes, which rested only on the hope of the proofs he would give the emperor of their courage and achievements. When he had consented to hold his command for some time longer, until he could see what provision there was for their pay and maintenance, they pledged themselves to remain faithful to him, and to promote with him all that affected the safety of his person or the welfare of his army. He then despatched Piccolomini to Generals Gallas and Aldringer, to invite them to repair to his head-quarters, when he hoped also to secure their support. 5. Piccolomini had been raised by the fostering hand of Wallenstein from an insignificant position to the highest offices in the army, and loaded with wealth and honours. He thought, therefore, that he might confide in him, not reflecting that those whom we have the most obliged are not those who are always the most faithful. He was further induced to repose in him his confidence, because astrologers had declared that Piccolomini's horoscope agreed with his own ; but this very circumstance ought to have excited his mistrust ; for since he was naturally of a crafty disposition, he should have thought that Piccolomini was not less deceitful than himself. And, indeed, the count, instead of bringing to the camp the two generals, dissuaded them from going there, and revealed to them the whole design of Wallenstein. 6. Aldringer without delay repaired to the emperor, and confirmed him in the suspicions which he had previously entertained. An imperial decree was promptly issued, which relieved all chiefs, officers, and soldiers of the oath which they had taken to WaUenstein, except the generalissimo, Tertzky (his brother-in-law), Kinsky, Colonel Mo, and others of his principal confidants. Piccolomini was despatched to Pilsen with 3,000 horse, to obtain an entrance under the guise of friendship, and attempt to seize there the duke's person. He also occupied aU the roads, that no messenger might escape to Wallenstein with"], [415, "THE CONSPIRACY OF WALLENSTEIN. 387 tidings of the danger that menaced him. But nevertheless the hero received a warning, and now, seeing himself reduced to extremities, gave himself up to the counsels of despair ; informing the Elector of Saxony that he wished to join his party, and demanding a safe-conduct to go to Dresden. The Elector, however, was of a slow temperament, and mistrusting the subtlety of Wallenstein, delayed too long. He also requested the Duke of Weimar to approach with his forces to Egra, whither he had retired from Pilsen, because Gordon, a lieutenant-colonel in Tertzk/s regiment, was its governor. Weimar hesitated, in the suspicion that this summons was but a stratagem to surprise him; at last, when urgently solicited by three couriers, one after the other, he set out from Ratisbon with all his army, but keeping himself narrowly upon his guard. Wallenstein also sent a detachment of troops to seize upon Prague, but found it already occupied by Balthazar Maradas on behalf of the emperor. He had opened communications with the King of France, whom he knew to be in alliance with the Swedes, and had informed him, as early as the 1st of January, of his desire to compel the House of Austria \"to consent to a general peace. France was preparing to take up the matter, when her councils were rendered fruitless by the sudden death of the hero, who, on the 15th of February, was assassinated by those whom he the most trusted, and apparently with the greatest justice, but who had been cor rupted by the imperial bribes, and who were so much the more guilty, because, if assassination is a crime which cannot be excused, there is no name for it suffi ciently horrible when it strikes at the person from whom everything has been received, nor any punishment, in this life, which is then commensurate with its enormity. 7. Gordon \u2014 a Scotchman, says Richelieu, and accordingly a pauper \u2014 who had been raised to high office and great wealth by the liberality of Friedland and into whose hands he trusted himself when taking up his abode at Egra ; and Butler, an Irishman, who had also received his advancement from Wallen stein, and was one of the colonels of his army in whom he placed the most con fidence, resolved, under pretext of serving the Emperor, but really in the hope their deed would secure them a splendid recompense, to bathe their hands in the duke's blood, notwithstanding their oath of fidelity. It was easy for them to execute their design, because he cherished no suspicion of them. They enlisted in the nefarious attempt some of their countrymen who had commands in the garrison stationed in the castle. As a preliminary they invited to supper Tertzky, Kinsky, Illo, and Neumann, who had been Wallenstein's chancellor ; and in the middle of the banquet armed men rushed in and assassinated them, while, at the. same time, all the gates of the town and approaches of the castle were occu pied by troops under their immediate orders. They then broke into the castle, and burst the doors of Wallenstein's chamber. The duke, startled out of his sleep, hastened to the window, and seeing that escape from it was impossible on account of its height, turned towards his murderers, and, throwing open his arms, received their blows without seeking to defend himself. It is worthy of note, and a cir cumstance that shows the weakness and falsehood of men, that of all those whom he had enriched or rewarded, there was not one in Egra who sought to avenge his death, each endeavouring to advance some imaginary excuse for his ingrati tude or his cowardice. c c 2"], [416, "388 NOTE. 8. His fall is a remarkable example, both of the ingratitude of a servant and the cruelty of a master ; for the emperor, during a life distinguished by memorable incidents, had received from no others such services as Wallenstein rendered ; nor does history furnish any instance of a servant so liberally recompensed by a master as Wallenstein by his. Not the less do we behold him concluding his life of splendid mystery by a violent death at his master's instigation, who deprived him of that which had been so often exposed on his behalf. His master, indeed, complained that he had been unfaithful to him, and that, having received so much from his liberality, there remained nothing more for him to hope ; that he despised and was weary of his service ; but he was constrained to acknowledge that he could not allege aught that he had done for Wallenstein, while the latter could count a million of services which he had rendered the emperor ; and if the emperor complained of the jealousies which his conduct originated, he might justly reply that, before yielding to their influence, he should weigh with a calm aud unimpassioned judgment to which the most credence should be given \u2014 the palpable evidences of his fidelity, or the simple suspicions of the contrary. \" But whether,\" continues Richelieu, who on this point could speak from experience, \" whether the emperor was a bad master, or Wallenstein a disloyal servant, it is equally a proof of the wretchedness of that life in which, if a master is embar rassed to find a servant in whom he can wholly trust, a servant is still more afraid of trusting himself entirely to his master, because he is surrounded by a thousand envious of his glory \u2014 men whom he has made his enemies by his very services, and who by incessant insinuations damage his fame. The mind of a sovereign is naturally jealous, distrustful, and yet credulous; and he can exercise with impunity his wish to crush a servant, because it is a crime in those who occupy this position to complain of it, and because the courtiers of a king, in order to gratify him, disguise his cruelty under the name of justice.\" 9. The summary of Wallenstein's career and character afforded by the great cardinal may interest our readers, though necessarily treating of matters which have already received our consideration. But it is always useful to learn a great man's views of his distinguished contemporaries, and Richelieu's opinion of Wallenstein, however briefly conveyed, cannot fail to possess a certain historical value. \" Wallenstein,\" he says, \" was born a gentleman, on the borders of Bohemia and Moravia. He was bred as a page in the service of the Marquis de Buro-o. In the year 1617 he visited France in the train of the Rhinegraaf\u2014 a simple light horseman in his company of two hundred young men of good blood (de deux cents mditres). Next he served in Hungary as a cornet, under Count de la Tour; then as a captain of infantry ; and from the close of the year 1618, had a regiment of horse and foot in the service of the Moravian States, which, having revolted against the emperor, he deserted for the service of his Imperial Majesty, with the money they had furnished him far the pay of his regiment; this money the emperor returned lest he should irritate them, but his generosity did not prevent them from rebelling against him, and confiscating all the estates which he possessed in Moravia. The emperor, in 1621, conferred upon him the command of two regiments of horse, which he had levied at his own expense ; and after the battle of Prague, the Count de Buquoy placed him in charge of that city."], [417, "389 THE CONSPIRACY OF WALLENSTEIN. He raised three new regiments, and laid the whole country under a contribution, by which he secured a large sum of money. The emperor, reduced to great extremities, having issued a new coinage of six parts of copper and one of silver, Wallenstein entered into the scheme, and bought several confiscated estates in Bohemia with this money ; drawing from them in six months more good silver than he had originally paid. This money was afterwards prohibited as base coin. He acquired by this means 400,000 rix-dollars as his Bohemian revenue, and was enabled with his own funds to raise 15,000 men for the succour of Tilly against the King of Denmark, with whom he seized upon the bishoprics of Magdeburg and Alberstadt. He was then appointed general of the army of the emperor, with Colalte under him as field-marshal, but the latter soon afterwards quitted him on account of a quarrel between them, and withdrawing to the imperial court, exerted his influence against him during his continuance with the army1. Immediately after his separation from Colalte, he beat Mansfeldt at the Bridge of Dessau, in Lower Saxony, upon the Elbe, acquiring a great reputation ; crossed the Elbe in the following year against the King of Denmark, and conquered all Mecklenburg, Holstein, and Jutland ; besieged Stralsund, and thereupon received the rank of generalissimo by sea and land. Afterwards the emperor bestowed upon him (in 1629) the Duchy of Mecklenburg which he had conquered, valued at 100,000 rix dollars of yearly revenue, besides which he drew as a contribution from the country 400,000 rix-dollars. 10. \" Possessed of this immense wealth, he assumed a magnificence appropriate to his rank, and yet conducted himself with a modesty and simplicity becoming his birth. His household and retinue included twelve counts or barons of the empire, gentlemen of his chamber ; a grand equerry, grand master, and grand marshal ; 1,200 guards in uniform, 60 halberdiers, 200 lancers, 200 pistoliers, 200 carabineers, 200 mounted musketeers, and 200 Croats, commanded by Piccolo mini ; 36 carriages, 26 chariots. In his stables stood 6,000 horses ; his treasury contained several millions of rix dollars ; but with all this pomp he remained a man of sagacity, listened patiently to every one, was endowed with a sound judgment, indulged in no vices, exercised a great economy, bore himself statelily, but dressed plainly \u2014 always after one fashion, a buff jerkin, pourpoint of lace, and camlet breeches \u2014 but lavish to an extreme, so that he distributed in gifts more than ten million dollars ; hence, though extremely rigorous in discipline, without which he said he could not hold his own amongst his followers, he was warmly beloved by them. Throughout his early career he met with no other misadventure than when, in 1639, the jealousy of the Electors constrained the emperor to dismiss him from his command ; but as he retired possessed of a splendid renown and surpassing wealth, he could endure this catastrophe with calmness, especially as he saw that the emperor's affairs were approaching a point which would compel his reinstatement with more power and glory than he had previously enjoyed. So, when the emperor recalled him, he forced him to buy his aid at the price of most extraordinary conditions, which, nevertheless, he con sidered necessary to enable him to do good service to his master. And his was the honour of restoring the desperate affairs of the emperor to such a position that they assumed a hopeful aspect, and it was allowable to believe that the enemy, hitherto considered invincible, might be resisted and even overcome."], [418, "390 NOTE. Finally, in a pitched battle, he slew the great opponent of the empire, receiving as his reward a secret sentence of death from his sovereign, by the hands of his own followers ! 11. \" He died at the age of fifty. He appeared older, through the ravages of the gout, from which he had suffered continually. Although he observed a very great prudence throughout his career, it nevertheless seems that his extraordinary fortune had pacified his apprehensions, so that he neglected the measures necessary for his safety. For this he was censured after his death by those who would have flattered him if he had lived. We accuse with facility those who are no longer able to defend themselves. When the tree has fallen everybody hastens to com plete its ruin, by lopping off its branches. A man's good or evil renown depends \u25a0on the last period of his life ; both good and evil descend to posterity, and the malice of human nature inclines us to believe the one rather than the other. 12. \" Wallenstein left no male children. He- had had a son, whom he lost while yet an infant \u2014 a loss which afflicted him severely, but which he bore with magnanimity, saying that he should have esteemed himself happy if death had taken him in his young manhood, while he was ignorant of the future, and when he had gazed upon an heir whom he judged worthy of his inheritance. His wife and daughter received the legacy of his bad, not of his good fortune : they were treated with the utmost rigour by the emperor, who disposed of their estates to his favourites, and also punished most of his friends with death. The confiscation of their property was the lightest penalty endured by those who had shared Wallenstein's confidence. This unexpected catastrophe filled all the world with alarm. The Swedish faction, which had hoped for much from his alliance, was constrained to alter its schemes. The imperial party was astonished, ap prehending the greatest results from the duke's death, and that the affairs of the emperor, which they thought to have rested on Wallenstein alone, would now sink into ruin. But it was soon perceived that the dead cannot sting (qu'un viort ne mord point), and that the affection of men soon ceases to concern itself about him who is no more ! \" 13. In estimating the character of the mysterious Wallenstein, it is but just that we should bear in mind the favourable view pronounced by Richelieu, whom both tiolicy and natural disposition would rather influence to his prejudice than his advantage ; and it may reasonably be doubted whether the astute and sagacious cardinal would have declared so calm and cool a judgment upon an impudent charlatan or an audacious impostor. In the position which Wallenstein occu pied concealment was impossible. He was constantly measuring himself with men who would instantly have detected his hollowness. While, therefore, unable to regard him with his panegyrists as endowed with remarkable and heroic qualities, we are equally unable to pronounce him, with some recent writers, a quack and an incapable, devoid of political shrewdness and military talent. Is it not time that we discouraged these reversals of historical verdicts, which afford to \"ready writers\" so facile a method of securing at least a transient reputation, as the blow-fly gains a brief life by feeding upon the dead ?"], [419, "CHRONOLOGICAL LINKS BETWEEN THE BATTLE OF LUTZEN AND THE BATTLE OF PULTOWA.

The power and fortune of the war Had passed to the triumphant Czar.\" \u2014 Byron. 1. Early in the eighteenth century it seemed as if the great problem of European politics, the empire of Russia, was about to be solved by the courage and enterprise of Sweden, and that Sclavonic progression was to be checked by Scandinavian heroism. The successes of Charles XII. threatened the young state, which Peter the Great was slowly raising on the ruins of the barbarous Muscovy of his ancestors, with virtual annihilation, and it was probable that the Samoedic intruders into the Europe of the Teutons would be driven back to the icy wildernesses from which they had emerged. Thrice has Europe risen against its semi-savage aggressors : twice have they repelled with success their formidable attempts; and only of late years have the king- doms of the West succeeded in bringing the imperial Tartar power to its knees. Wha,t Charles XII. failed to effect at Pultowa, what Napoleon was unable to accomplish at Moscow, France and England achieved at Sebastopol. Because they had learned the lessons of history, and forbore from plunging their legions into"], [422, "394 BATTLE OF PULTOWA. the perils of a Russian winter ; because they attacked the un wieldy monster at the extremities, content that from thence the fatal chill should extend inwards to its heart. The Russian was then driven back from the south and the west by more than half a century, and before that period has elapsed, Europe will have no cause'to fear aught from the Sclavonian. Poland will separate him from Germany, and Scandinavia guard against him the west of Europe, and either he will assimilate by slow degrees with the Frank, or recede into the wild deserts of his primeval race. 2. In the eighteenth century, however, the positions occupied by Sweden and Russia were vastly different from those which they hold at present. Sweden was infinitely more powerful ; Russia infinitely weaker. The former held Pomerania, Rugen, and Bremen, Finland, Livonia, and Ingria. She had ports on the Baltic, north, east, and west ; Stralsund in Germany, and Stockholm in Sweden Proper. Her shipping was extensive, and manned by the hardy sailors of Finland. Her exertions in the cause of Protestantism had given her immense weight in the councils of Europe. Her armies, under Gustavus, the \" Lion of the North,\" had acquired a reputation which, under Charles XII., was strengthened and extended. It was Sweden that triumphed at Liitzen ; that secured the Treaty of Westphalia. She was the coveted ally of English Cromwell ; the powerful enemy of Austrian Ferdinand. But Russia indicated nothing of her future greatness. To tiie civilised governments of Europe she was a myth, a phantom ; or, rather, a curiosity to be stared at and cast aside. When Marlborough hastened to the court of Charles XII. to deprecate his anger and solicit his alliance, no great general or consummate diplomatist presented himself before the Czar Peter. There was no Russian army, but a hetero geneous and undisciplined mass of barbarous troops ; no Russian navy, for English and Dutch shipwrights had not yet created it. She had no literature, no laws, no society ; and the stubborn courage, the unyielding resolution, the patriotic, unquestioning devotion of her people had not yet been impelled by a powerful hand into the channels which have since led to such momentous consequences. Russia, at the beginning of the eighteenth cen tury, was trembling in her greatest weakness ; for a nation on the verge of a vast revolution is always in more peril than wThen contented with its degradation or proud of its refinement. She"], [423, "395 MOVEMENTS OF CHARLES XII. was then in a transition Btate. Under the guidance of Peter the Great she had abandoned the Old, but had not yet assumed the New. Muscovy was in ruins, and no Russia as yet had risen in imposing grandeur from the chaos. And it is not too much to assert that if Pultowa had witnessed the downfall of the Czar, this imperial Russia which has since flung so terrible a menace in the face of Europe could never have been constructed. 3. The Swedish king in his invasion of Russia was confident of victory. A series of successes had taught him to despise his enemies : they had fled before him at Narva, like sheep before a lion. His army was well-disciplined, and composed of veterans whom victory had taught to be proud of themselves and of their leader. He believed that in a twelvemonth he should enter Moscow, and dictate peace from the Kremlin ; and Europe also believed that he would succeed in his ambitions designs. In this assurance he set out from his camp at Aldstadt, near Leipzig, in September, 1707, at the head of 45,000 men : 20,000 men, under Count Lewenhaupt, disembarked at Riga ; and 15,000 w-ere massed in Finland. In January, 1708, he arrived in Lithuania, where he put his army into winter-quarters, while the Russians were cantoned in the provinces of Minsk and Grodno. Placing himself at the head of his cavalry, Charles marched through the ice and snow to Grodno, where his great opponent had taken up his abode. 4. He had already crossed the Niemen at two leagues from that town, and the Czar was ignorant even of his march. He entered it by the south gate just as Peter escaped from the north \u2014 escaped with only two thousand men at his heels, but he was led to believe that the entire Swedish army was upon him. He now gathered together his forces in the province of Minsk, and by a retreat upon the right bank of the Borysthenes enticed the Swedes to pursue him into a country destitute of provisions, and afar from their magazines and communications, while he supplied his own army from Smolensko, which lay in his rear. He then entrenched himself in an advantageous position between Moghilev and Orsa, determined to defend the passage of the river ; and despatched General Goltz, with a division of 15,000 men, to lay waste the country through which the Swedes were necessitated to advance. This movement constrained King Charles to place his army in cantonments until the month of May."], [424, "396 BATTLE OF PULTOWA. 5. With the return of spring the Swedes recommenced hos tilities,and streaming through the dense forests of the Minsk,they felled the trees to construct a road for themselves and their bag gage. On the 20th of June they came up with the corps of General Goltz, who had just encamped\" on the Beresina, near Borisov, and had received reinforcements under Prince Ressnin and Field- Marshal Scherematof. Posting some regiments opposite Borisov, to engage the attention of the Russians, he swiftly remounted the river about three leagues towards its source, flung a bridge across it, surprised a body of 3,000 men who defended that point, and rapidly moved upon the Russian army. They did not await his arrival ; but suddenly broke up their camp, and fell back towards the Borysthenes, destroying the roads and desolating the country they passed through, in order to retard the Swedes. 6. But no obstacles could daunt the impetuous Charles, and he still pressed towards the Borysthenes. On his way he fell in with 20,000 Russians entrenched behind the marshes of Hollosin. As usual he was in advance of his infantry, but with his grena diers he leapt into the waters, broke through river and marsh, often immersed even to his shoulders, and dashed against the startled Russians in front, while his cavalry, making a detour, took them vigorously in flank. Then he mounted his horse, but some time afterwards discovering in the press of the fight that a young Swedish gentleman, named Gyllenstiern, whom he favoured highly, was wounded, and unable to walk, he made him mount his charger, and fought on foot at the head of his infantry during the remaining battle. Of all the engagements which he had fought, this, mayhap, was the most glorious : in this he braved the most terrible dangers ; in this he displayed the greatest capacity. Its memory was perpetuated by a medal, which bore on one side the inscription, Silv\u0153, paludes, aggeres, hostes, victi \u2014 \" Forests, marshes, and battalions conquered \" \u2014 and on the other a line from Lucian, Victrices copias alium laturus in orbem \u2014 \" He will drive the vanquished hosts into another world.\" 7. The Swedish hero did not delay in his pursuit of the fugi tives, but crossed the rolling Borysthenes at Mohilov, the then border town of Poland, and a neutral territory to Muscovite and Pole ; and on the 22nd of September, with fire and steel, smote death into the ranks of nearly 20,000 Russians near Smolensko. The Czar, alarmed at this victorious rapidity, apprehensive that all"], [425, "397 SWEDES AND CALMUCS. his grand imperial projects would be overthrown and his infant empire crushed in its hour of promise, made proposals of peace. \" I will treat with the Czar at Moscow,\" was the Swede's haughty answer. \" My brother Charles,\" coldly remarked the Czar, \" pre tends to imitate Alexander ; but I flatter myself that he will not find in me a Darius.\" 8. From Mohilov, the point where the Swede king crossed the Borysthenes, ifyou trace towards the north the river's course, keeping always upon the boundaries of Poland and Russia, yon come, in about thirty leagues, to the district of Smolensko, near the intersection of the grand road to Moscow. By this route rapidly retreated the Czar ; by this route swiftly followed the Swede ; so swiftly, indeed, that the bold dragoons in the van of the Swedish army often dashed victoriously into the Muscovite rear. But these skirmishes, though successful, were disadvan tageous to the Swedes from the loss of men they entailed.* 9. On the 22nd of September (a.d. 1708), the king, near Smo lensko, attacked, and beat down the resistance of, some 10,000 Russian cavalry, and 6,000 Calmucs. These Calmucs are Tartars whose country lies between the Russian district of Astrakan and the province of Samarcand, formerly included in the empire of Tamerlane. It stretches eastward to the snow-crested heights which barred out the Mogul from western Asia. When Charles fell upon this force he had with him but six regiments of horse and 4,000 foot. With his wonted impetuosity he flung himself upon the Russians with the Ostrogoth cavalry, \u2014 a regiment of sabres, \u2014 and the fire of his onset drove them reeling back. Press ing upon them through narrow and difficult defiles, he came upon the Calmucs, who swiftly interposed their spears between his cohort and the rest of his army, and assisted by the rallying Russians, surrounded him on all sides. Their steel pierced through the press even to the king ; two aides-de-camp were slain at his side ; his horse was killed under him ; a squire pre sented him with another, but both horse and squire were instantly smitten dead. Charles continued the fight on foot, supported by some officers who had hastily flung themselves between him and the foe. Many were captured, killed, or wounded, or separated from the king in the fierce melee which ensued. At last, but five captains stood at his side. He had * Mosley."], [426, "398 BATTLE OF PULTOWA. slain already, with his own hand, more than a dozen of his enemy without receiving a single wound, thanks to the incon ceivable good fortune which up to this time had always attended him, and on which he always relied. At length, a colonel named Dardoff threw himself with a company of his regiment into the midst of the raging and driving Cossacks. He was in time to disengage the king ; the Cossacks were driven back ; the Swedes closed up their ranks, and Charles, mounting on horseback, pursued them for two leagues, as if he was superior to all physical fatigue. 10. The conqueror was now on the high road to Moscow, but more than a hundred and fifty miles distant, or ten days' march. His men were without provisions, and his officers besought him to halt, and await the arrival of Lewenhaupt, who was on the road to reinforce him with 15,000 men, and an important convoy. Charles disregarded this salutary counsel, and added one more illustration to the many which his career affords, that if he possessed the courage of an antique hero, he lacked the capacity of even a second-rate general. To the wonder of his whole army he suddenly swerved aside from the road to Moscow \u2014 the holy city of Russia, whose possession would certainly have enabled him to dictate what terms of peace he chose \u2014 and plunged into the wilds of the Ukraine, the land of the Cossacks, lying between Little Tartary, Moscow, and Poland. The object he had in view \u2014 to effect a junction with Mazeppa and 1,000 Cossacks, who had thrown off their allegiance to the Czar \u2014 was not commensurate with the peril he ran by this extraordinary movement. Napoleon, than whom no superior military critic could be quoted, observes that as his line of operations began at Sweden, he thus exposed his flank to the enemy for a distance of 400 leagues, and was unable to protect it, or to receive rein forcements or assistance. His separation from Lewenhaupt was equally impolitic, as it rendered the latter, with his valuable convoy, liable to be separately attacked and overwhelmed by the enemy, while it deprived his own troops of the much-needed stores and reinforcements that general might have brought up at the most important point of the campaign. 11. Lewenhaupt, nevertheless, used every exertion to overtake his royal leader, and join him in the Ukraine ; but the Russians had learned much in their years of disaster, and General Bauer"], [427, "DEFEAT OF LEWENHAUPT. 399 rapidly following him up, crossed the Borysthenes at Mohilov, on the 6th of October, and effected a junction with the Muscovite main army under the Czar, Prince Menzikoff, and General Goltz. The result of this movement was to surround Lewen haupt with some 53,000 Russians. The habit of victory, how ever, had inspired the Swedes with so much confidence that, despite this immense superiority of force \u2014 nearly five to one \u2014 the general led his veterans to the charge, and so well was the first onset delivered, that 500 Muscovites speedily bit the dust. A panic seized the soldiery of the Czar, and they ran on all sides. But Peter was fully aware of the importance of victory. He saw that his empire depended upon it; that all was lost if Lewen haupt and his army, flushed with triumph, effected a junction with the King of Sweden. He hastened, therefore, to his reserve, and strictly ordered them to shoot down every man that fled. \" Kill me\" he cried, \" if I am coward enough to draw back.\" Then he returned to the front rank, rallied and encouraged his men ; and Lewenhaupt, anxious to join his king, and convinced that he had done enough to prevent the Russians from following him, drew off his army and recommenced his march. So it might have been a year or two before, but the Swedes had taught their enemies how to fight. At eleven in the morning, on the morrow, the Czar, by a swift flank movement, caught him on the border of a morass, and deployed his army to sur round him. The Swedes faced about on every side, and a desperate struggle ensued, with a loss which, though greater on the part of the Russians, the inferior numbers of the Swedes rendered equally disastrous to them. As the night gathered round, the strife slackened, and the Swedes retired behind their baggage-waggons, unchecked by the weary Muscovites. 12. The Czar kept his troops under arms the whole night, to repel any sudden surprise ; and it was observed that the Swedes also maintained great fires around their waggons. As soon as the day broke with a lurid glimmer in the eastern sky, the Rus sians again advanced to the attack, but discovered that Lewen haupt had drawn off his men under the cover of the darkness, leaving behind him his wounded, provisions, military stores, and cannon. Swimming the Lissa with about 4,000 men, he suc ceeded in joining King Charles at Starudub, upon the Desna, but his arrival only increased the king's difficulties by swelling"], [428, "400 BATTLE OF PULTOWA. the numbers of an already starving army. In the three days' battle, so gallantly endured by Lewenhaupt, the Russians lost 70 officers and 1,200 men, killed or wounded ; while the total loss of the Swedes was computed at 8,000 men, killed, wounded, and captured, seventeen pieces of cannon, forty-four colours, and all their provisions and ammunition. This was the first great success achieved by the Russians over their formidable foe, and the first pitched battle in which the Czar had commanded in person. Its result was, to isolate the Swedish sovereign and his army in a bleak and barren country, afar from their com munications and magazines, and with no other resource but their courage. 13. Charles remained in the Ukraine throughout the winter of 1708, which proved one of extraordinary severity, and more than decimated the ranks of his weakened army. In vain the Swedish chancellor, Count Piper, solicited him to entrench himself in a small town of the Ukraine, called Romira, where it was possible that Mazeppa might supply him with provisions, or to repass the Desna and Borysthenes, and put his troops into cantonments in Poland. Charles would make no movement that implied the possibility of retreat. He would subdue the Ukraine, he said, and then march upon Moscow. He wished to brave the seasons (says Voltaire) as he did his enemies. He dared to make long marches in the mortal cold, and in one of these 2,000 of his soldiers died before his eyes. His horsemen wanted boots ; his foot-soldiers were without shoes, almost without clothes ; they encased their feet in coverings made of skins, as best they could. They often had no bread. He was compelled to abandon almost all his guns in marshes and rivers, for want of horses to draw them. His army, formerly so flourishing, was reduced to 24,000 famishing men. No news reached them from Sweden ; no intelligence of their condition could they forward there. In these circumstances an officer complained to him : \u2014 \"Ah, what?\" replied the king, \" are you sick of being parted from your wife ? If you are a true soldier I will lead you so far that you shall hardly receive news from Sweden once in three years ! \" The Marquis de Brancas, French ambassador to Sweden, relates that on one occasion a soldier dared to show the king, in the face of the whole army, a piece of black and mouldy bread made of oatmeal and barley, the only food they had, and of which there was not"], [429, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE CAMPAIGN. 401 even a sufficiency. The king took it without emotion, eat the whole of it, and then said coldly to the soldier, \" It is not good, but it can be eaten.\" This incident, trifling as it was \u2014 if any incident can be called trifling which increases respect and confi dence \u2014 contributed beyond anything else to support the Swedes in extremities which they would have found unendurable under any other chief. 14. The excessive cold of December and January absolutely compelled inaction, but in February, 1709, Charles resumed the offensive. With a degree of obstinacy which seems madness, he began his march \u2014 not towards Moscow, but \u2014 across the Ukraine, to the south-east, into a country of sandy deserts, absolutely wanting in provisions, and but scantily inhabited. After losing many men from the guerilla attacks of the peasantry, he was compelled to retrace his steps, and move towards Moscow. He was now at the head of about 12,000 Swedes, and nearly as many Cossacks and Wallachians ; and with this small and ill provided force commenced his enterprise, in the middle of May, by laying siege to Pultowa, or Pultava, a town upon the river Vorskla, which was garrisoned by the Russians under General Allard, and largely supplied with provisions and military stores. Its position on the various roads which lead through it into the great Moscow highway rendered its possession of the utmost importance to Charles. It would have supplied the wants of his army, and afforded him a secure base for his future operations. He pressed the siege vigorously ; the garrison vigorously re sisted ; and Peter, not less aware than his rival of the value of the post, rapidly advanced to its relief with a fresh and numerous army, between fifty and sixty thousand strong. He succeeded by an able movement in throwing a reinforcement into the town of 2,000 men, under Prince Menzikoff. \" Ah, 1 see well,\" exclaimed King Charles, \" that we have taught our enemies the art of war.\" He made a reconnaissance in force on his birth day, the 27th of June, and drove back one of the Russian detachments ; but on his return to his camp he received a car bine-shot which pierced his boot, and broke the bone of his heel. No one remarked in his countenance the slightest change to indicate that he was wounded ; he continued to issue his orders with the utmost calmness, and remained on horseback 6ix hours longer. One of his attendants perceiving that the heel D D"], [430, "402 BATTLE OF PULTOWA. of the king's boot weltered in blood, went in search of a sur geon ; and the pain now became so intense that he was con strained to dismount, and suffer himself to be borne to his tent. He was there examined by his surgeons, who, to the conster nation of the army, declared the leg must be amputated ; but a leech, named Reumann, skilfuller and bolder than the others, declared that by making a few deep incisions he could save the leg. \" Set to work at once,\" exclaimed the king ; \" cut boldly, fear nothing.\" He held his leg himself with both hands, scru tinising the incisions that were made as if the operation had been performed upon another, and he was but a calm and unconcerned spectator. 15. The Czar, meanwhile, had skilfully carried his army across the Vorskla, and was now on the same side of the river as his enemy, but a little higher up. The Vorskla falls into the Borysthenes about forty miles below Pultowa, and, accord ingly, the Czar disposed his troops in two lines, with a flank resting on each river ; so that if the Swedes attacked, and were repulsed, they would be driven hopelessly into the acute angle formed by their junction. He protected his lines with several redoubts, armed with heavy guns, and in their rear posted his cavalry and artillery. 16. Informed that the Czar appeared to threaten an attack, the undaunted Swede resolved that he himself would be the assailant, and ordered his Field-Marshal, Renschild, to prepare for battle on the morning of the 8th of July. His orders were executed without remonstrance, for it would have had no effect ; and without hope, for the inequality of the two armies forbade it. The sun rose upon no ordinary spectacle \u2014 upon an empire compelling battle destined to resolve the fate of two of the most remarkable monarchs whose crowns have overshadowed Europe. \" Charles XII.,\" says Voltaire, \" was illustrated by nine years of victory, Peter Alexiowitz by nine years of toil undertaken to render his troops a match for the Swedish soldiers ; the one was proud of having given away kingdoms, the other of having civilised his own ; Charles in love with danger, and fighting only for glory, Peter never shunning peril, but making war only for self-interest ; the Swede generous through his large ness of heart, the Russian never liberal but from interested motives. The former of unexampled sobriety and moderation,"], [431, "403 BATTLE OF PULTOWA, of a natural magnanimity, and stained but by one savage action ; the latter still clothed with the savagery of his early training and his country, as terrible to his subjects as he vvas admirable to foreigners, and addicted to excesses which ultimately short ened his life. Charles held the title of Invincible, of which a moment might deprive him ; the world had already named Peter Alexiowitz the Great, an honour which no defeat could wrest from him, because no victory had gained it.\" 17. To understand the battle-field where the destiny of Russia was decided and the fortunes of Europe largely influenced for coming centuries, it is necessary for the reader to imagine a sandy and desolate level, which towards the east narrows into a sort of peninsula between the river Vorskla, flowing from the north-east, and the Dnieper or Borysthenes, flowing southernly, the latter receiving its tributary at the extreme point of the peninsula. On the right bank of the Vorskla, that is, at the north-east boundary of the peninsula, stands Pultowa ; to the south lies the camp of the Swedish army. Across the penin sula, with its right touching the Borysthenes, and its left the Vorskla, are massed the hosts of the Czar, a mile or two above Pultowa. It is evident that the Swedes, if defeated, will be perilously hemmed in, at the angle of the peninsula, between two rapid and unfordable rivers. 18. At break of day the Swedes quitted their trenches, with four guns for the whole of their artillery. The remainder was left in the camp with about 3,000 men, and the baggage was guarded by some 4,000 more. Not above 17,000 Swedes, there fore, confronted the immense army of the Muscovites, but they advanced to the attack with heroic resolution. Their officers reminded them that at Narva 8,000 Swedes had destroyed 80,000 Russians, in a strongly fortified camp ; but they forgot that the Russian of Pultowa, as the issue proved, was a different soldier to the Russian of Narva. The king led the advance, carried in a litter at the head of his infantry. A body of horse dashed forward at his order, to attack the cavalry of the enemy, and this movement, at half-past four in the morning, inaugurated the battle. The Russian cavalry was posted on the right wing, in the open space between the redoubts ; but the Swedish sabres fell upon them with such fury they were unable to stand their ground. They fled hastily ; two of the redoubts were taken ; the Swedish D D 2"], [432, "404 BATTLE OF PULTOWA. infantry pressing round shouted \" Victory ;\" and for a moment it seemed that Pultowa would be added to the long roll of the triumphs of Charles XII. But General Creutz, whom he had despatched with 5,000 horse to take the enemy in flank, had lost his way, and did not appear at the critical moment. The Russians rallied from the surprise of the first shock, and fell in their turn upon the Swedish horse with a courage that would not be denied. At the same time seventy pieces of cannon hurled upon them a storm of shot, and the Russian infantry, debouching from their lines, steadily rolled onwards in a whirlwind of fire and steel upon the small army of the Swedes. For two hours the battle raged ; for two hours the Swedes opposed the most inflexible discipline to the most stubborn bravery. An able flank move ment by Prince Menzikoff cut off the communication between the troops on the field and the reserve in the trenches, and inter cepted a division of 3,000 men, who were cut to pieces. This decided the fortune of the battle. Neither skill nor heroism could now check the resistless rushing tide. The Swedes wavered, and at length gave way ; the first rank rolled back upon the second, and the second fled. Charles in vain exerted himself to recall his soldiers to their standards. The battle had become an utter rout, and the Swedes, pressed back to the junction of the two rivers, either surrendered as prisoners, or perished in the waters of the Borysthenes ; a few hundred only swam the river, and escaped into Turkish territory. Upon the field of battle, and beneath the Russian redoubts, lay 9,224 killed and wounded Swedes, and two or three thousand cavalry were captured during the action. \"Thus,\" says the journal of Peter the Great, \"by the favour of the Almighty, this victory, which can be equalled by few, was won with little labour and little blood, over the proud King of Sweden, by the skill and gallant conduct of the Czar in person, and by the courage of his generals and soldiers ; for in this most important engagement, his Majesty exposed himself, for his subjects and his country, without sparing his own person, like a true and great captain. It may be added that, in this memor able battle, our first line only was engaged ; the second was not brought up until the action was over.\" 19. The battle having turned against him, the Swedish hero was like a man tossed in the changes of some wild tumul tuous dream.

The character of this extraordinary leader- \u2014 we have written elsewhere * \u2014 was a singular combination of heterogeneous qua lities. His bravery was that of a man who could not compre hend the existence of fear ; his military skill was distinguished in an age of military heroes ; his frame was capable of enduring hunger or thirst, the extremes of cold or heat. He never felt fatigue, and was insensible to the desire of repose. Prompt to conceive, and quick to execute, \u2014 inexhaustible in his resources, and resolute in the development of his conceptions,. \u2014 he was, literally, in himself \"a host,\" and supplied by his genius the paucity of his army and the scantiness of his means. His sole idea in life was \" military glory ;\" the fame of a great com mander, the renown of an invincible conqueror. Hence he was superior, or rather, indifferent, to the attractions which could enervate even Alexander of Macedon, and enslave the remark able capacities of Julius C\u00e6sar. Neither wine nor woman ever spell-bound his dauntless will. None of the luxuries, the graces, or even the conveniences of civilisation softened his rugged life. The simplest fare, the rudest bed, the plainest garb, contented him. He loved best the \" tented plain ; \" the shock and tumults of the battle-field had an inexpressible charm for his restless, seeth ing heart. But his self-confidence, augmented by a long career of success, often degenerated into a wild temerity ; and he plunged into dangers for the sake of showing with what facility he could afterwards extricate himself. Like the gods of the old Norse creed, the Odins and Balders of the Skalds, he was passionate in his revenge, enduring in his hate, and barbarous in his cruelty. 2. Charles XII. was born in ] 682. He was the son of Charles XL and Ulrica-Eleanora, daughter of Frederick III., King of Denmark. At an early age he showed himself possessed of many admirable qualities and more than ordinary capacity. He learnt German with facility, and could speak it as easily as his own language. The first book of importance put into his hands was the work of Samuel Puffendorff. that he might under stand the condition of his own country, and its relations to other countries. At the age of seven he could manage a horse, and displayed a remarkable aptitude for all physical exercise, in- * Memorable Battles of English History."], [436, "408 POSTSCRIPT VI. dulging in athletic sports, which strengthened his constitu tion, and rendered him invincible to fatigue, disease, or pain. Voltaire tells us that even in his childhood he showed an insurmountable obstinacy of character ; that he could only be affected by an appeal to his honour ; that the word \" Glory \" was a spell which subdued him utterly. He hated Latin ; but when told that the King of Poland and the King of Denmark were familiar with it, he mastered it rapidly, and acquired a sufficient knowledge to enable him to speak it. His preceptors sought in the same manner to engage him to study French, but such was his abhorrence of it that he never employed it in later life, not even to converse with French ambas sadors who knew no other language. There is probably an exaggeration in this statement, but, stript of its colouring, the fact has a psychological interest not unworthy the consideration of the student. 3. As soon as he had some knowledge of Latin, Quintus Curtius was placed in his hands for translation : he evinced for his author a partiality due rather to the interest of his narrative than the felicity of his style. Being asked what he thought of the historian's hero, Alexander of Macedon \u2014 \" I think,\" said the prince, \" that I should wish to resemble him.\" They re minded him that the Greek conqueror lived but thirty-two years. \" And was not that enough,\" he rejoined, \" when one has conquered so many kingdoms ?\" His attendants did not fail to repeat these answers to his father : \u2014 \" Ah,\" he exclaimed, \" this lad will accomplish more than I, and go farther than the great Gustavus.\" One day, when in the king's cabinet, he amused himself by examining two geographical charts, one of a city of Hungary taken from the emperor by the Turks, and the other of Riga, the capital of Livonia, a province conquered by the Swedes. Beneath the plan of the Hungarian town was inscribed a text from Job : \" God gave ; God has taken away ; blessed be the name of the Lord ! \" The young prince having read these words, immediately took a pencil, and wrote beneath the map of Riga : \" God gave it me, and the devil shall not take it away ! \" In these childish traits may be recognised the germs of that indomitable will which conquered at Narva and was crushed at Pultowa, just as the oak sapling indicates the strength and staunchness of the mature tree."], [437, "A SPARK FIRES THE TRAIN. 409 4. He lost his mother when he was eleven years old, and his father in his fifteenth (16th April, 1697), receiving from the latter an inheritance whose value had been much augmented by his sagacity and discretion. It included not only Sweden and Finland, but Livonia, Carelia, and Ingria ; Vismar, Vyborg, the islands of Rugen and Oesel, the richest part of Pomerania, the duchy of Bremen and Verden \u2014 all the conquests of his illus trious ancestors, assured to his crown by a prolonged possession, and by the faith of the solemn treaties of Munster and Oliva, sustained by the terror of the Swedish arms. The Peace of Ryswick (a.d. 1698), which commenced under the auspices of his father, was concluded under those of his son ; \" he was the mediator of Europe already when he began to reign.\" 5. By his father's testament, the majority of the young king was fixed at eighteen years of age, and the regency was en trusted to the ambition and capacity of his grandmother, Edwiga- Eleanora of Holstein, widow of Charles X., whose age had not quenched her energy or enfeebled her intellect. At first, the youthful sovereign seemed content to enjoy the rank of king without its responsibilities, and while the Regent busied herself with diplomatic mysteries, he reviewed his troops and hunted the wild deer. But his ambition was dormant, not extinct ; and a spark lit up the smouldering fires. It happened that one November day, in the same year as that of his father's death, he was reviewing several regiments. The state-councillor, Piper, was near him, and observed that Charles seemed lost in a pro found reverie. \" May I ask your majesty,\" said the councillor, \" what occupies your thoughts so seriously?\" \" I am thinking,\" replied the king, \" that I feel myself worthy to command these brave men, and that I wish neither they nor I received a woman's commands.\" Piper availed himself of the opportunity to make a dexterous stroke. He called to his aid Count Oxel Sparre, and the twain soon won over to their views the coun cillors of the Regent, who had more to apprehend from the anger of a young and ardent king than to hope from an enfeebled and aged woman. Each was eager by his energy to outstrip his colleagues and merit the future favour of his monarch. Preli minaries were soon arranged. The Regent was informed of her grandson's desire to assume the burthen of sovereignty. The States-General were convoked, and easily induced to sanction"], [438, "410 POSTSCRIPT VI. the proposed change. In three days the regency became a memory, an historical phantom ; the Regent retired to the devo tions which became her increasing years ; and Charles XII. grasped his sceptre with one hand, while the other already rested upon the hilt of his sword. He was crowned on the 24th of December, and made his royal entry into Stockholm, mounted upon a chestnut horse, caparisoned with silver \u2014 sceptre in hand and crown on brow \u2014 while the streets echoed and re echoed with the acclamations of the people, who are naturally worshippers of youth and energy, and always regard with hope ful interest a new reign as a new era. The regret for the past is never so strong as the hope of the future. 6. The opening acts of his government, however, did not con firm these favourable impressions. As Voltaire says, epigram matically, he appeared to have been eager rather than worthy to reign. Not that he showed any dangerous passions, but that his conduct seemed to waver between youthful hastiness and foolish obstinacy. He appeared frivolous and haughty, and foreign ambassadors described him to their courts as endowed with very moderate abilities. His subjects came to a similar con clusion : no one really had sounded the depths of his character. He was ignorant of himself, when the storm which suddenly broke in the north afforded his latent talents an opportunity to dis play themselves. He was threatened at once by the three great powers of the north- \u2014 Denmark, Poland, Russia\u2014 each having wrongs to avenge, or hoping in the king's youth to find an occasion to enrich themselves at the expense of Sweden. Den mark sought to recover the islands of Gothland and Oeland, and other territories wrested from her in the reign of Christina, the \" Semiramis of the North.\" She, had, moreover, resolved to reunite to herself the duchy of Holstein, and the prince of the latter province was the brother-in-law of Charles of Sweden. Poland, under her king, Frederic Augustus, was anxious to re conquer Livonia, a district which had of old belonged to the Teutsch Ritters, or Knights of the Teutonic Order, but which Sweden had taken a century before, and whose possession was guaranteed by the Treaty of Oliva. Her inhabitants, alienated by the severities of Charles XL, were desirous to fling off the Swedish yoke. Russia, whose navy was rapidly rising under the sagacious administration of her illustrious reformer, Peter"], [439, "411 PETER ALEXIOWITZ. the Great, needed, for the proper development of her commerce, a port on the Baltic Sea, and coveted the Swedish province of Ingria, which lies to the north-east of Livonia. The supposed imbecility of Charles XII., and his extreme youth, seemed to offer a favourable opportunity for the prosecution of these ambitious schemes of conquest, and Peter concluded an alliance with the King of Denmark and Augustus of Poland, to deprive Sweden of all the countries lying between the Gulf of Finland, the Baltic, Polaud, and Russia (a.d. 1700). 7. Of these three enemies the most formidable was, undoubt edly, the Russian Emperor, Peter Alexiowitz. Europe had already watched his career with astonishment and admiration. \" For seventeen months,\" says the Comte de Segur, \" Germany, Holland, England, Austria, had fixed their eyes on a young bar barian of five-and-twenty, whom a treacherous sister had delivered up from the most tender age to the most violent passions ; who, delighting in wine, in women, in command, had left his despotic throne, a war successfully opened, and all the temptations which entrain power, to visit, with the compass, the hatchet, and the scalpel in his hand, their manufactories, their workshops, their hospitals, and to study practically those sciences which he alone, in the midst of his people, had seen to be indispensable to their glory, prosperity, and independence. This example, unique in history, is, without doubt, the example of a despot \u2014 a despot by birth, a despot by condition, a despot by necessity, by the magic of his superior genius, by the qualities of his disposition, and because slaves must, of necessity, have a master ; but, then, what is most irreconcilable, this despot was more patriotic, more constantly and wholly devoted to the welfare of his country, than the citizen of any republic, in the ancient or modern world.\" He had given to his empire laws, education, morals, commerce ; had founded colleges, hospitals, and schools ; had developed an army and established a navy ; had opened ports and built warehouses ; restrained the excesses of great towns by the formation of a police ; humbled the arrogance of prelates and conquered the indolence of monks ; taught his subjects the rules of civilised society ; attired them in an European costume ; and concealed, as best he could, the barbarity of the Samoedic savage beneath the artificial polish of the modern Russian. He not only founded an empire ; he created a people. But the his-"], [440, "412 POSTSCRIPT VI. tory of Russia, while it proves what one man may accomplish, proves what he cannot accomplish. Abruptly and even un naturally forced into a position of power and influence by the exertions of her great ruler, she has never acquired that cohesion of parts, that depth of internal resource, that sympathy between classes, and unity of interests, which are the fruits of the slow maturity of a free and constitutional government. The triumphal column soars into the air with majestic stateliness ; but there is a hollowness at the base which menaces its ultimate ruin. The nation that would be free, and prosperous, and happy, must be content to build up its edifice stone by stone, and story by story, with patient labour and hopeful perseverance. The fairy fabrics that spring from the charmed earth in the course of a summer night, vanish with a rapidity as startling as their growth. 8. Sweden at first proposed to disarm the formidable coalition which threatened her by negotiation. The council of state was deliberating on the subject in the presence of Charles, who had usually manifested a profound indifference to their discussions, but on this occasion he suddenly arose from his fauteuil, and with an air of giave determination, exclaimed \u2014 \" Gentlemen, I am resolved never to enter upon an unjust war, and never to finish a lawful one but by the destruction of my enemies. My resolution is taken : I shall attack the first who declares against me ; and when I have conquered him I may hope to strike terror into the others.\" Nor was his decision an unwise one. By negotiation he must have lost almost everything ; the chances of war would probably enable him to save something, if not all. Renouncing the amusements to which he had appeared so devoted, he now made the most strenuous preparations for war. Inspired by the idea of Alexander and Julius C\u00e6sar he proposed to himself to imitate them in all but their vices. Instead of a luxurious table he practised the utmost abstemious ness ; instead of splendid attire, he dressed like a private soldier. He interdicted himself the wine cup ; he basked no longer in the smiles of the fair and frail, but seemed desirous of being thought the only hero who could rise superior to the whispers of love and the blandishments of beauty. 9. His first movement was to send assistance to the Duke of Holstein, his brother-in-law. Eight thousand men were de spatched into Pomerania to defend him from the Danish attacks."], [441, "THE SWEDE-KING'S SUCCESSES. 413 The fleets of England and Holland also appeared in the Baltic for the succour of their ally, whom they were not disposed to see crushed for the aggrandisement of Denmark or Russia. Charles himself embarked with Count Piper, who was now recognised as his prime minister, and General Renschild, in a ship of 120 guns. He joined the allied fleets, and offered battle to the navy of Denmark. It avoided an engagement, and the allies immediately approached the city of Copenhagen, and threatened it with their bombs. Five thousand troops were landed, and speedily carried the redoubts of the Danes. It was on this occasion, when the Danish soldiers opened fire, that the king asked Major-General Stuart, who marched at his side, the cause of the whistling noise that pierced his ears. \" It is the ring of the musket balls which are aimed at you,\" replied the soldier. \" Good ! \" said the king ; \" henceforth it shall be my music.\" * 10. To avoid a bombardment of their city the Danes, whom the celerity and decision of the king's operations had completely paralysed, agreed to pay a ransom of 600,000 rix-dollars ; and the King of Denmark, who had hoped for so much from Sweden's supposed weakness, found himself constrained to restore Hol stein to the duke, its lawful sovereign, and to pay the expenses of the war. A treaty of peace to this effect was concluded at Travendal, on the 5th of August, after a campaign of only six weeks' duration. Meanwhile, the King of Poland had invested the city of Riga, the capital of Livonia, and the Czar advanced from the east at the head of nearly 100,000 men. Riga was defended by Count d'Alberg, a Swedish general of distinction, who at the age of eighty joined the ardent vigour of youth to the experience of sixty campaigns. The siege was pressed by the Poles with the utmost resolution, but their energy and re sources could not prevail against the skill and forethought of the Swedish general. The King of Poland despaired of success, and seized the first opportunity of raising the siege without loss of honour. Riga was full of merchandise belonging to the Dutch. The States-General ordered their ambassador at the Polish court to address to King Augustus proper representations * We relate this anecdote on the authority of Voltaire, but it seems incredible that Charles with his passion for field-sports and military spectacles, should have been unacquainted with the sound of musketry."], [442, "414 POSTSCRIPT VI. on the subject. He did not stand in need of much entreaty. He consented to raise the siege rather than inflict the least injury upon his allies, who were surprised at this excess of com plaisance, because they were ignorant of the real cause. 11. Thus relieved from the pressure of two of his enemies, Charles was free to direct all his efforts against his rival in glory, Peter the Czar, who had put forward a manifesto which it would have been more to his interest to have suppressed, so slight were the reasons he alleged as the origin of the war. He complained that when he had passed incognito through Riga he had not been received with becoming honours, and that the provisions supplied to his ambassadors were charged at too high a rate. It is probable that reasons so trivial were never before alleged as the motives of a great monarch in invading the territories of his neighbours. At all events, he swiftly appeared in Ingria with 80,000 men, ravaging that unhappy province with fire and sword. On the 1st of October he set down before Narva, a stronghold of some importance on the river Narva, and prose cuted the siege with characteristic energy, putting into practice the lessons which he had gained in his travels through Holland, France, and England. The command of the forces was placed in the hands of the Due de Cro'i, a German, and an able officer, while he himself served in the ranks as a simple lieutenant, and set his untrained soldiers the example of rigid obedience to the rules of discipline. It is no marvel, says Voltaire, that the man who worked as a lieutenant at Amsterdam that he might create a navy, should serve as a lieutenant at Narva to teach his subjects the art of war. 12. The Russians, to quote the same eminent but not always trustworthy authority, were robust, indefatigable, perhaps as courageous as the Swedes ; but it is time which hardens soldiers, and discipline which renders them invincible. The only regi ments from which much might be expected were the few com manded by German captains ; the others were composed of raw recruits and serfs, torn away from their forests, and clad in the skins of wild beasts, some armed with clubs and others with pikes ; few had any guns, none had witnessed the operations of a regular siege ; there was not a good artilleryman in the whole army. Five hundred cannons, which ought to have reduced the little town of Narva into ashes, had not even effected a tolerable"], [443, "MILITARY MOVEMENTS. 415 breach, while the guns of the town overthrew, every moment, large portions of the entrenchments of the besiegers. Narva was almost without defences. Its commander had under his orders but a thousand regular troops ; yet so inconsiderable a place could resist for six weeks the attacks of so numerous an army. 13. The Swedes, meanwhile, were rapidly approaching the scene of action, and, 20.000 in number, hastened to the relief of Narva. They arrived in the face of the hostile army on the 19th of November. The Czar had quitted his troops the day before \u2014 a singular proceeding, which provoked much sarcastic comment, but which he explains in his Journal by his anxiety to hasten the march of 30,000 men from Novogorod ; and further, to have an interview with the King of Poland, and decide with him what measures should follow his abandonment of the siege of Riga. He took with him the Marshal Count Golownin ; en trusting the sole charge of his army to the Due de Cro'i and the Commissary-General Prince Dolgorouki. 14. Charles, on approaching Narva, found himself opposed at about a league from that town by a body of 30,000 Russians. Still farther from Narva were stationed 20,000 Strelitzes, while an advanced guard was thrown out of some 5,000 of the same troops. He had to cut his way through these before he could reach the Russian camp, which was fortified by a rampart and double ditch. With his blood inflamed by the prospect of a great battle, the Swedish hero swiftly moved upon his enemies, always in the van, and followed by his cavalry and only 4,000 foot. The main body struggled on behind him, outstripped by his rapid and eager movements. Soon, with 8,000 men, he found himself before the Russian advance. He resolved to attack them immediately, before they could learn how small a force ac companied him. The Russians, on the other hand, employing neither patrols nor spies, and utterly ignorant of the rules of war, fancied that the whole body of the Swedes was gathering, like a thunder-cloud, in their front. At the first shock, the vanguard of the Russians, though occupying a defile of which a hundred resolute men would have made a Thermopyl\u00e6, took to flight \u2014 a hasty and ignominious flight. Falling back upon the Strelitzes, stationed in their rear, they communicated to them the same dis graceful panic, and the disorderly mob retreated hastily upon their camp. Thus, these strong posts had been. forced in two"], [444, "416 POSTSCRIPT VI. days ; but not even two such victories could check the im petuosity of the victor, who now, with his small army, found himself before a camp in which 24,000 Russians were entrenched, under the cover of 500 guns. 15. Permitting to his troops a scanty repose, he gave, without further deliberation, the signal of attack. The word was, \"With God's help !\" A general officer representing to him the great ness of the hazard, \"What!\" he exclaimed, \"do you doubt that with my 8,000 braves I can pass over the bodies of 80,000 Muscovites ? \" A moment after, apprehensive that his words sounded too much like the speech of a braggart, he observed, more calmly, \" Are you not of my opinion ? Have I not two advantages over my enemy \u2014 one, that his cavalry can do him no service ; and another, that in so confined a position his very numbers will but encumber him ? So that, in truth, I shall actu ally be stronger than he is.\" The officer had no mind to think differently, and in the midst of a furious storm of wind and snow, which drove full in the faces of the Russians, the attack was made, at noon, on the 30th of November, 1700. 16. The Swedish cannon having already made a breach in the entrenchments, the Swedes advanced at the point of the bayonet, and the fury of their onset sent the Russians staggering back in dismay. The camp was speedily carried, and its defenders driven into the river, or cut down where they stood. Some at tempted to cross the bridge, but it broke beneath the crowd of fugitives, and the stream rolled downwards a burden of the dead and dying. In the unequal melee the king displayed the most brilliant courage. A ball struck him in the throat, but was fortu nately a spent shot, and did him no injury. His horse was killed under him ; he sprang lightly on the back of another, exclaim ing, \" Yonder fellows are putting me through my exercises ;\" and continued to fight and give his orders with an imperturbable coolness. The rout of the Russians was complete, and the Due de Croi, Generals Dolgorouki, Gollofkin, Fedgrowitz, and thirty officers, rendered themselves prisoners. Charles received them with a politeness as easy and an air as courteous as if he was receiving them in the saloons of his palace. He retained captive only the generals ; all the subaltern officers and soldiers were disarmed and conducted as far as the river Narva, where boats were provided to take them across, that they might return"], [445, "417 THE ROUT OF NARVA. to their own homes. Meanwhile night approached, and on the right wing of the Russians the battle still continued. The Swedes had lost about 600 men ; 18,000 Muscovites had been slain in their entrenchments, a great number drowned, many had passed the river, but there remained in the camp sufficient men to have slaughtered even the last Swede. But it is the fear of the survivors, and not the number of the dead, by which battles are lost. The king took advantage of the little daylight that remained to seize the Russian artillery, which he disposed advantageously between the camp and the town. Then, wrapping himself in his cloak, he obtained a few hours' sleep. When the morning broke he prepared to complete his victory by attacking the Russian left wing; the Russians, however, rendered it unnecessary, by submitting themselves prisoners ; their general, and some 30,000 rank and file, marched bare headed before 7,000 Swedes. The soldiers, as they passed before the king, flung on the earth their swords and muskets, and the officers lowered at his feet their flags and colours. He dismissed this multitude to their own country, for had he attempted to guard them the prisoners would have mustered five times the number of their conquerors. 17. In the rout of Narva \u2014 it is a misnomer to call it a battle \u2014 the number of killed, according to the Czar himself, was only 6,000, but he admits that out of an army of nearly 100,000 men only 22,967 returned to Novogorod. When the disastrous tidings reached him he showed no sign of alarm or despondency. \" I know very well,\" he said, \" that the Swedes will beat us for a considerable period ; but in the end they themselves will teach us how to beat them.\" His subjects did not bear the dis aster with the same complacency, but declared it was due to the misconduct of their patron saint, St. Nicholas, who had aban doned them to the fierce and terrible Swedes. A prayer was composed and used in all the churches, imploring the saint to return a ses premiers amours. It ran as follows : \u2014 \" O thou, who art our perpetual Comforter in all our adversities, great Saint Nicholas, infinitely powerful, by what sin have we offended thee in our sacrifices, genuflexions, reverences, and acts of thanksgiving, that thou bast thus forsaken us ? We have besought thy assistance against these terrible, insolent, raging, dreadful, indomitable destroyers, when like lious or bears which E E"], [446, "418 POSTSCRIPT VI. have lost their young, they have attacked, terrified, wounded, slain by thousands, us, who are thy people. But as it is impos sible this could have happened without conjuration and enchant ment, we supplicate thee, 0 great Saint Nicholas, to be our champion and standard-bearer ; to be with us in peace as in war, to deliver us from this crowd of sorcerers, and drive them far from our frontiers with the reward which is their due.\" 18. But while the Russians complained to St. Nicholas of their defeat, Charles XII. gave thanks to God, and prepared for new victories. He had borne his success at Narva with the same calmness that Peter had endured his failure. From the report of the victory, addressed by Count Piper to the States of Sweden, and the allied powers of England and Holland, he had struck out, with his own hand, every passage that spoke too warmly of himself and too injuriously of the Czar. He could not, however, prevent his subjects from indulging in a natural outburst of pride and loyalty ; and a medal was struck which represented a Russian, a Dane, and a Pole chained to a pedestal. On the other side figured Hercules armed with a club, and treading under foot a Cerberus, with these words \u2014 Tres uno contudit ictu: \"He smote three at one blow! \" 19. Instead of repeating the deadly stroke he had levelled at Russia, Charles turned aside to humble Poland, as if he disdained to crush a defeated enemy, or as if he made war in a passion of youthful excitement, without any definite object or political pur pose. He thus enabled his most dangerous antagonist to recruit his army, reform its discipline, and develop the resources of his empire by a thousand well-directed measures. After passing the winter at Narva, he suddenly poured his troops into Livonia, and' made his appearance near Riga, which King Augustus had so vainly besieged. The Saxon troops were posted along the river Dwina, which is very broad at that place ; they intended to oppose the passage of Charles, who was on the other bank of the river. At the head of the Saxon army was the Marshal de Stenau, and under him the Prince Ferdinand, Duke of Courland, and Patkul, a Livonian of dis tinction. Charles had caused to be constructed some large boats of a new design, whose bulwarks, being higher than ordinary, could be raised or lowered like drawbridges \u2014 when raised, they sheltered the troops whom they carried; when lowered, they"], [447, "419 PASSAGE OF THE DWINA. served as a bridge for their disembarkation. He also employed another artifice. Having noticed that the wind blew directly in the face of the enemy, he set fire to a mass of damp straw, whose gathering clouds of smoke, spreading across the river, obscured from the Saxons the movements and numbers of his troops. Barges laden with smoking heaps were also floated on the river, until the whole country-side was covered with adense,dull vapour, which the eye could not penetrate for a dozen yards. Then his army began the passage of the Dwina. When midway, the king exclaimed to General Renschild, \" Ah, well, the Dwina will no more be cruel than the sea at Copenhagen : trust me, general, we shall beat them.\" In a quarter of an hour he gained the opposite bank, and great was his mortification to be the fourth person who landed. Swiftly he got ashore his cannon, and formed his army in line of battle, before the Saxons, shrouded in smoke, could oppose him with more than a dropping fire. The wind clearing away the mist, behold the Swedes marching steadily upon their enemies' steel ! 20. Marshal Stenau, as soon as he recognised his opponents, hurled upon their advancing ranks a column of cavalry, who, falling upon them while they were still closing up their lines, smote them into disorder. They broke their -ranks and fled, the thundering hoofs of the horses clanging after the fugitives even to the slope of the river bank. But the king, a moment after, rallied them in the middle of the stream as easily as if it had been a review. He led them again to the charge \u2014 their ranks being firm and serried \u2014 and driving back the cavalry, debouched upon the plain. Stenau, a cool and experienced officer, perceiving that his men were astonished at this rapid change of affairs, retired them into a suitable position, flanked by a marsh and a wood, where he had posted his artillery. The advantageous character of the ground, and the pause of inaction, enabled the Saxons to recover themselves. But Charles did not hesitate to attack them, although he had but 5,000 soldiers against the 12,000 under Stenau and the Duke of Courland. A terrible struggle ensued. The duke had two horses killed under him. Thrice he drove into the very heart of the king's body-guards ; but, being felled from his horse by a blow from the butt-end of a musket, a panic seized his army, and they no longer disputed the victory. His cuirassiers drew him, crushed E E 2"], [448, "420 POSTSCRIPT VI. and half dead, from the intertangled melee, where the horses trampled him beneath their sect. 21. The conqueror, after his victory, hastened to Mittau, the capital of Courland. All the towns in the duchy submitted to him without firing a shot. He rode triumphantly into Lithuania, the hero of a royal progress through hostile states, and at length entered Birza, where the King of Poland and the Czar, some months before, had met to conspire his downfall. \" It was in this place,\" says Voltaire, \" that he conceived the design of dethroning the King of Poland by the hands of the Pules themselves. There, seated one day at table, wholly occu pied with that enterprise, and preserving his extreme sobriety in profound silence, appearing overwhelmed with mighty con ceptions, a German colonel who was present said, loud enough to be heard, that the repast of which the Czar and the King of Poland had partaken in the same place was rather different to that of his majesty. ' Yes,' said the king, rising, ' and I shall trouble their digestion of it.' And combining somewhat of diplomacy with the power of his arms, he hastened to realise the event which he meditated.\" 22. To the present generation \u2014 who only know Poland as the unhappy victim whose bleeding members were distributed between Russia, Austria, and Prussia ; who are only reminded of its existence by the desperate efforts of its people to throw off the crushing thraldom that forces the very life-blood from its veins \u2014 it is difficult to describe the Poland of the seven teenth century, when it was yet a power among European nations, and its victorious standards flew from the banks of the Danube to the shores of the Baltic. At the time of which we are now writing, its territory occupied a larger area than that of France, though it was less thickly peopled than even Sweden. Its common language was the Latin, which, never familiar to the peoples of the west, had contrived to penetrate into the depths of the ancient Sarmatia. Its soil was exceed ingly fertile, but its inhabitants were more addicted to the chase and the melee than to tilling fields and garnering harvests. Its trade and commerce were chiefly absorbed by Scotch, and French, and Jews; the latter had more than three hundred synagogues within its confines. They bought at a low price its crops, its cattle, its flocks ; sold them at Dantzig and in Ger-"], [449, "POLAND, PAST AND PRESENT. 421 many, and the wares they received in exchange, disposed of at an enormous usury to its luxurious nobles. Thus the gifts of nature profited but little the children of the soil, and all Poland was divided into two classes, an idle and arrogant aristocracy and an enslaved and starving peasantry. Its government was formed on the old Celtic type, and repre sented a republic governed by a king. The sovereign was elective, and every gentleman could give his voice in the elec tion, or himself become a candidate. His power was nominal, for the throne was overshadowed by the noblesse, who at the same time trampled remorselessly on the lower classes. Thus there prevailed a constant war of interests, and no order in the state had any sympathy with that above or beneath it. No sooner was a king elected than his nobles feared lest he should encroach upon their privileges ; and conspiracies were imme diately formed to deprive him of the crown which they had placed upon his head. Yet such was the dazzling courage of gentleman and peasant, such the romantic patriotism of the governors and the governed, that Poland, while independent. exercised a considerable influence upon European affairs. It was John Sobieski who saved Vienna from the Turks. But the patriotism of the Pole has this peculiarity : it is a poetical attachment to the very soil \u2014 to Poland as a country rather than to Poland as a commonwealth. The Englishman loves England, because he loves liberty, independence, equal laws, freedom of thought and speech ; the Pole loves Poland because it was his birthplace or the birthplace of his ancestors. Give the exile a clod of the beloved land, and he will worship it as a god ! And, therefore, beneath the mortal regime of Russian despotism fire has smouldered perpetually among the ashes \u2014 the Pole has never abandoned the hope of re-establishing Poland \u2014 and neither per secution has silenced, nor flattery beguiled, the ardent patriotism of a long-enduring people. 23. In his project of pulling down one sovereign and setting up another, Charles XII. found powerful assistants in the nobility, always discontented, and in the cardinal-primate of the kingdom, Cardinal Radjouski, Archbishop of Gnesna, and President of the Diet. This able and astute prelate had long nourished a deep enmity against King Augustus, whose excesses and ill-concealed ambition had alienated from him the affections"], [450, "422 POSTSCRIPT VI. of almost all classes of his subjects. Aided by the influence of the victorious King of Sweden, he contrived to secure the deposition of King Augustus at a Diet held at Warsaw, the 14th of February, 1704. He was there declared incapable of wearing the crown of Poland ; it was agreed that the throne was vacant, and resolved that a new election must take place. The indignant remonstrances of the Czar produced no effect on the proud Polish nobility, and after some intervening difficulties were removed, the election was declared to have fallen on the Swedish king's protegee, Stanislas Leczinsky, a young nobleman of considerable capacity and many virtues. 24. Charles, immediately upon this success, set out to com plete the conquest of Poland. His army had assembled before Leopold, the capital of the grand palatinate of Russia, a place important in itself, and through the treasures of which it was the storehouse. It was thought the town would hold out some days, having been fortified recently by King Augustus. The conqueror invested it on the 5th of September, and on the morrow took it by assault. All who dared to resist were put to the edge of the sword. The troops, victorious, and masters of the city, did not break their ranks in quest of plunder, despite the dazzling nature of the treasures which Leopold enshrined. Ranging themselves in battle-array in the grand square, they there received the surrender of the garrison as prisoners of war. 25. At this moment a very different spectacle was seen in the streets of Warsaw. Affairs of state had compelled King Stanislas to remain in his capital. His mother, his wife, and his two daughters formed his household. The cardinal-primate, the Bishop of Posnania, and some Polish magnates composed his court. He was protected by 6,000 of the army of the crown, who had lately acknowledged him as their liege, but whose fidelity had not yet been put to the test. General Hoorn, governor of the city, had under his orders only 500 Swedes. There prevailed at Warsaw a profound tranquillity, and Stanislas contemplated his departure in a few days to share in the attack upon Leopold. Suddenly he learned that a large army was approaching the capital ; it was King Augustus, who, by a fresh effort, and by one of the most skilful marches ever executed by a general, having out-man\u0153uvred the Swedish conqueror, fell with a swoop upon Warsaw, in the hope of carrying off his"], [451, "423 POLAND SUBMISSIVE. rival. The town was not fortified, the army could not he relied upon, and Augustus had his adherents both among the citizens, the clergy, and the soldiers. For Stanislas to remain was ruin. Selecting the most trusty of his troops, he sent his family under their escort into Posnania, while he himself fled in haste to the camp of the King of Sweden. 26. The power thus hastily grasped by the ex-king Augustus soon vanished from his hands. Charles, indignant at the audacious insult offered to his arms, turned away from the plunder of Leopold to chastise the would-be monarch. But the tidings of his coming were sufficient to scatter the motley bands which Augustus had assembled. Day after day was marked by successes so easily obtained, that Charles complained be bad never to purchase a victory, that he was assisting at the chase rather than making war. The only check he met with was the skilful retreat of the Saxon army under General Schullembourg, who contrived to carry his men across the Oder with little loss of life and no small gain of honour. But this retreat, though glorious to Schullembourg, was of little utility to Augustus, who, finding himself a king without an army, without a revenue, and without a kingdom, retired into his electorate of Saxony, and hastily fortified himself in his capital of Dresden. 27. The hero of Narva now saw Poland submissive and suppliant at his feet. Everywhere his arms were victorious. Where his presence could not animate his troops, they were inspired by his example, and every Swede considered himself equal to five soldiers of any other nation. It is thus that the habit of victory ensures victory, by encouraging a spirit of daring confidence and absolute self-reliance. It was at a moment so auspicious that Stanislas prepared for his coronation. Fortune, which had placed the crown on his head, which had driven him from Warsaw, recalled him thither amid the acclamations of the nobles, attracted to his side by the success of his arms. A diet was summoned to meet in the capital ; every obstacle appeared to vanish, and no opposition was met with in any quarter except the court of Rome. It was in accordance with the traditional policy and obvious interests of the Holy See that it should espouse the party of Augustus, who had turned from Protestant to Papist to secure a"], [452, "424 POSTSCRIPT VI. throne, rather than that of Stanislas, who occupied the same throne through the favour of an ardent enemy of the Catholic religion. The Pope (Clement XI.) accordingly sent briefs to every prelate in Poland, and especially to the cardinal-primate, threatening them with the terrors of excommunication if they assisted at the coronation of Stanislas, or in any way infringed the rights of King Augustus. 28. It was necessary to prevent these briefs from reaching the hands of the prelates, lest their menaces should produce an unfavourable impression. The Franciscan to whom they were secretly entrusted for delivery into the hands of the bishops, delivered the first brief to the suffragan of Chalen. An ardent partisan of Stanislas, he carried it to the king with the seal unbroken. The king sent for the monk, and demanded of him how he dared to become the bearer of so treasonable a missive. He replied that he had acted under the orders of his superior. The king bade him thenceforth prefer his allegiance to his sovereign to his obedience to his ecclesiastical chief, and imme diately expelled him from the city. He at the same time issued an edict forbidding the dignitaries of the Church from inter meddling in state affairs, and posted sentinels at the door of every prelate's mansion. He carried out these measures in his own name, that they might not embroil Stanislas with his future subjects. These precautions taken, Stanislas was crowned with solemn pomp at Warsaw, on the 4th of October, 1705, though the usage of the Poles was to celebrate their coronations at Cracow. The crown was placed on his head and on that of his wife, the beautiful Charlotte Apalinska, by the hands of the Archbishop of Leopold, assisted by many other prelates. The King of Sweden attended it incognito, and witnessed in the ceremony the 6ole result of five years of victory. 29. But while Poland received in submission the sovereign he imposed upon her ; while Denmark fretted in forced inactivity ; while Prussia solicited his friendship, and Protestant Europe exulted in the victories of the second Protestant hero that Sweden had produced, the enemy he had despised \u2014 the northern bar barian whose hosts had fled before his triumphaut standards \u2014 had silently but surely repaired his losses, had largely increased the resources of his empire, had infused into his army a new spirit, and led it successfully against the Swedes in Ingria. He had"], [453, "HOW CHARLES XII. MADE WAR. 425 learnt the art of war, and taught it to his troops. A rigid dis- cipline coerced the hitherto disorderly mob into a compact and formidable army. It was led by skilful officers, enriched with a powerful artillery, and preceded by able engineers. And the strength of his empire was further increased by a navy capable of opposing with success the Swedes in the Baltic Sea. Thus he was enabled to repair past defeats by unexpected victories. He had captured Narva, but what was more advantageous to his empire, he had founded Petersburgh, which was already the seat of a considerable commerce, and glittered with much of the pomp and splendour of an European capital. Having accomplished in a few years what for many would have been the labour of a lifetime, he addressed himself to the fulfilment of his long medi- tated designs against Sweden, and invited the dethroned Augus- tus to an interview at Grodno. The king repaired thither with some troops, accompanied by General Schullembourg ; the Czar attended by the martial pomp of 70,000 men. The two monarchs busied themselves with schemes of new campaigns. Augustus cared little about abandoning his kingdom to the fire and sword of the Muscovites, and agreed with the Czar that the Russian army should be divided into several corps to oppose the Swede king at every step. In pursuance of this notable project the Russians burst from several points into the territories of Stanislas, marking their progress by blood and rapine. On the other side, Schullembourg invaded the unfortunate country with the Saxon troops he had collected. But. as might have been expected, the campaign resulted in two months in the entire discomfiture of the Muscovites. Charles XII. and Stanislas attacked and defeated these several bodies in detail, and with such rapidity that a Russian general was beaten before he knew of the mishap of his brother officer. No obstacle could check the onrush of the Swede : isa river interposed its waters between him and his enemy he passed them by swimming. \"A Swedish detachment captured the baggage of Augustus, and obtained the splendid booty of 200,000 crowns in silver. Stanislas seized 800,000 ducats belonging to Prince Menzikoff, the Russian commander. Charles, at the head of his cavalry, rode thirty leagues in twenty -four hours, each horseman leading a horse by the bridle to \u2122ount when his own should be dead beat. The Russians, terrified, and reduced to a small number, fled in disorder beyond the Borysthenes. The hour of"], [454, "426 POSTSCRIPT VI. victory had not yet arrived for the Czar. There must be more patience, more endurance, and redoubled energy. 30. Augustus saw himself reduced to a pitiful condition. The only ground he now held in Poland was the city of Cracow, where he was shut up with two Russian regiments, two Saxon regiments, and some troops of the army of the crown, by whom he momentarily expected to be delivered up to the conqueror. - He reached the climax of his misfortunes when he learned that Charles XII. had entered Saxony, on the 1st of September, 1766. 31. Charles had traversed Silesia without even deigning to give notice of his intention to the court of Vienna ; an act of audacity which struck all Germany with horror. The Diet of Ratisbon, which represented the empire, but whose resolutions, as Voltaire observes, were often as powerless as they were solemn, declared the King of Sweden an enemy of the empire, if he passed beyond the Oder with his standards. Charles determined to enter Germany the sooner. At his approach the peasant deserted his homestead, and the farmer abandoned his granaries. But he recalled them to their homes by a proclamation which announced that he had come only to make peace ; that those who paid the contributions he should exact would be treated like his own subjects. So general was the confidence placed in his fidelity to his word that the fugitives returned to the villages in crowds. The king then established his head-quarters at Altran stadt, near the plain of Liitzen, the memorable battle-field where Gustavus Adolphus conquered and died. So wonderful is the cycle in which history revolves ! Charles visited the \" hallowed ground,\" the scene of the Protestant hero's death. \" I have sought,\" he exclaimed, as his gaze surveyed the famous field, \" to live like him : God may one day grant me a death as glorious ! \" 32. From his camp he issued orders to the States of Saxony to assemble, and send him without delay the records of the elec toral finances. As soon as he had received and ascertained the pecuniary resources of the electorate, he subjected it to a requi sition of 625,000 rix-dollars monthly. Besides this contribution, the Saxons were constrained to furnish each Swedish soldier with two pounds of bread, two flagons of beer, and four sous daily, and with forage for the cavalry. The exactions thus regulated,"], [455, "THE KING IN SAXONY. 427 Charles established a new police to protect the inhabitants from the insults of the soldiers, and required the owner of every house where they were billeted to furnish a monthly report of their con duct, without which no soldier received his pay. But the pre cautions of the most benevolent general and the restrictions of the severest discipline are unable entirely to check the depreda tions of an invading army, and the private may well reason, by a species of military logic, that he only commits on a small scale the depredations which his leaders commit on a grand one. Thus, one day, when Charles XII. was riding through the streets of Leipzig, a Saxon peasant flung himself at his feet to demand the punishment of a grenadier who had plundered him of the food intended for his family's dinner. The king turned to the soldier : \" Is it true,\" he asked, with a stern and gloomy brow, \" that you have robbed this man ?\" \" Sire,\" replied the soldier, \" I have done him no more harm than you have done the king his master ; you deprived him of a crown, and I have taken from this clown a turkey.\" The king put ten ducats into the peasant's hand, and pardoned the soldier in consideration of the boldness of his retort, saying \u2014 \" Bethink you, my friend, that if I have taken a kingdom from King Augustus I have taken nothing for my self.\"* 33. Augustus, wandering disconsolately in Poland, a phantom king, deprived of both his kingdom and his electorate, at length, as the gamester's last desperate resource, addressed a letter to his conqueror, soliciting terms of peace. His two ambassadors arrived by night at the camp of Charles XII., and were admitted to a secret audience. The king read his royal brother's letter. \"Gen tlemen,\" he said, \" you shall have my answer in a moment.\" He immediately retired into his cabinet, and wrote as follows : \u2014 \" I consent to make peace on the following conditions, in which I must not be expected to suffer any change : \u2014 \" 1st. That King Augustus renounces for ever the crown of Poland ; that he recognises Stanislas as the lawful sovereign ; and that he promises to make no attempt to re-ascend the throne, even after the death of Stanislas. \" 2nd. That he renounces all other treaties, and especially those which he has made with Russia. * This is another, we think, of the apocryphal anecdotes with which Voltaire enlivens his narrative."], [456, "428 POSTSCRIPT VI. \" 3rd. That he sends back, with honour, the Princes Sobieski to my camp, and all the prisoners whom he has taken. \" 4th. That he gives up to me all the deserters who have passed into his service, and particularly Jean Patkul ; and that he desists from proceeding against those who have passed from his service into mine.\" To these harsh and degrading conditions, the latter of which no generous and noble mind would have sought to impose upon an enemy, King Augustus was compelled to assent. But in the hope that he might soften his conqueror by his presence, he repaired to the Swedish camp, and was received by Charles at a place called Gntersdorf, in Count Piper's quarters. No royal pomp distinguished the interview. Charles was in black boots, with a band of black taffety round his neck instead of a cravat; his clothes were, as usual, made of coarse blue cloth, with brass buttons. He wore at his side a long sword, which had served him in the battle of Narva, and upon whose pommel he would often lean. The conversation was wholly directed to his great boots. He told Augustus that for six years he had not laid them aside except when he retired to bed. These trifles were the sole discourse between two kings, one of whom had dispossessed the other of a crown. The royal twain dined together. Charles XII. always affected to give the right hand to King Augustus, but his complaisance extended to these ceremonies only. He relaxed not in his conditions, but even exacted them with greater rigour. He compelled him to surrender Patkul ; to give up the jewels and archives of the crown to his successor ; and even to congratulate him on his accession to the throne of which he him self had been deprived. Surely this was the mean vanity of a mean mind, delighting in the exercise of the power it had attained, so far as it gratified its sense of its own importance ! Not thus the heroes of the world behave ; it is not thus that the great revenge themselves upon the conquered. 34. His treatment of the unhappy Patkul affords another illustration of the weakness and asperities of the man whom Europe deified with a species of breathless wonder. Patkul was his subject, a Livonian, who, persecuted on account of his defence of Livonian rights and liberties, had fled to Russia. Distin guished by the special favour of the Czar, he was sent as his ambassador to the camp of King Augustus. By the law of"], [457, "429 DEATH OF PATKUL. nations his person was, therefore, sacred ; and his nationality as a Livonian was lost in his character as an ambassador. For Charles XII. these considerations were nothing ; an enemy, a traitor, was in his power, and should feel his vengeance. Patkul was tried by a court-martial; condemned, sentenced to death upon the wheel \u2014 the cruelest and most infamous of punishments. A priest announced to him that he must die, but did not inform him in what manner. Then this brave man, who had faced death on many a battle-field, finding himself alone with a priest, and his courage no longer inspired by glory or wrath, the sources of human intrepidity, poured his bitter tears into the bosom of his chaplain. He was betrothed to a Saxon lady, named Madame d'Einsiedel, who was endowed with the advantages of birth, beauty, and virtue, and whom he was engaged to marry on the very day that he was led out to his doom. He besought the chaplain to find her and console her, and assure her that to the last his love was unchanged and unalterable. When he was conducted to his scaffold, and saw the fatal wheel and the dreadful stake, he fell into convulsions of terror, and flung him self into the arms of the priest, who embraced him pityingly, covering him with his mantle, and weeping. A Swedish officer then read aloud a paper which contained these words : \u2014 \" Be it known that the imperative command of his Majesty, our thrice merciful lord, is, that this man, who is a traitor to his country, be broken on the wheel and quartered, for punish ment of his crimes, and as an example to others. Let every one beware of treason, and faithfully serve his king ! \" At the words \" thrice merciful \" \u25a0 \u2014 \" What mercy ! \" exclaimed the prisoner ; and at those of \" a traitor to his country\" \u2014 \"Alas,\" he cried, \" I have served her but too well! \" He re ceived sixteen blows from the executioner, and endured a pun 'shment the most frightful and protracted. Thus perished the unhappy Jean Reginald Patkul, general and ambassador of the Emperor of Russia. His cruel fate aroused the indignation of all civilised Europe. 35. The Czar had not heard without emotion of the peace. concluded between his ally Augustus and the King of Sw,eden. After a vain attempt to embroil in the war England and Holland, who were then engaged in their famous struggle against Louis Quatorze, he prepared to revenge himself upon his rival. At"], [458, "430 POSTSCRIPT VI. this time the great body of the Swedish army was in Saxony, and Poland was guarded by the insignificant force of 20,000 men under General Lewenhaupt. King Stanislas was in the Swede king's camp. The opportunity was one by which the sagacious Czar did not fail to profit. Swiftly he poured into Poland some 60,000 men ; divided them into several corps, and marched with a flying detachment upon the unprotected and ungarrisoned town of Leopold. There he convoked a Diet, pre sided over by a prelate favourable to the cause of Augustus. It was proposed to elect a new sovereign, but the influence of fac tion rendering discussion impossible, the Czar removed the Diet to Lublin. Concord was not obtained by this change of position. All the conclusion arrived at was that Stanislas was detested, and Augustus abhorred : that the one had abdicated, and the other been illegally elected. Meanwhile the party of the Princes Sapieha, and that of Oginsky \u2014 -the secret adherents of Augustus, and the supporters of Stanislas \u2014 made war upon each other, pillaged and destroyed, robbed and murdered, and only agreed in accomplishing the ruin of their common country. The Swedes, commanded by Lewenhaupt, of whom one detach ment occupied Livonia, another Lithuania, and a third Poland, drove before them the Muscovite troops; they burned every thing that belonged to the enemies of Stanislas. The Russians ruined both friends and foes : nothing could be seen but towns in ashes, and the wandering troops of the Poles, who detested equally their two kings, Charles XII., and the Czar, despoiled their countrymen of all that the Swedes and Russians spared. 36. King Stanislas set out from Altranstadt on the 15th of July, 1707, with General Renschild, six Swedish regiments, and a considerable sum of money, to restore peace to Poland, and secure his tranquil recognition. He was everywhere received as king : the strict discipline of his soldiers, which contrasted favourably with the barbarity of the Muscovites, gained him favourable opinions ; his excessive affability secured the good will of almost every faction ; his money bought him partisans in the army of the crown. The Czar, fearing to suffer from a scarcity of provisions in a country which his troops had rendered a desert, withdrew into Lithuania, where he had established his magazines. This retreat left Stanislas the peace ful sovereign over almost all Poland. Meanwhile, in his camp"], [459, "THE TWO GREAT RIVALS. 431 at Altranstadt, Charles, the king-maker, received ambassadors from the European powers. It was the crisis of the great struggle maintained by England, Holland, and Austria against the France of Louis XIV., and all parties were eager to engage the Swedish hero in the strife. England was well aware that he entertained a feeling of hostility towards the German empire, and that France was earnestly soliciting him to declare in her favour. Unwilling that his influence should be cast into the balance against the allies \u2014 although, as we think, they much exagge rated his importance \u2014 the English ministry despatched to his court the illustrious Marlborough, rightly judging that he would regard as a special compliment the visit of so great a general, with whose fame all Europe rang from side to side. In the interview which took place (April 28, 1708), the subtle sagacity of the hero of Blenheim, who was equally able as diplomatist and general, soon penetrated the weak veil with which Charles sought to disguise his real sentiments, and he did not fail to perceive that the king was bent upon hurling his victorious hosts into the heart of detested Muscovy, rather than upon marching to the support of Louis Quatorze. He returned, therefore, to the Hague, satisfied that the allies need apprehend no active hos tility on the part of the King of Sweden. 37. Between Charles XII. and Peter the Great there seems to have existed a certain uncontrollable antipathy, and the history of the world presents numerous examples of this singular antagonism between'the great men of a generation \u2014 -this opposi tion of hostile principles and powers. C\u00e6sar had his Pompey ; Mark Antony his Augustus. Wallenstein seemed predestined by fate to meet his antagonist and conqueror in Gustavus For years before the battle of Waterloo, Wellington was regarded as the fit opponent of Napoleon. The Swedish hero, to use the jargon of romancists, recognised his \" fate \" in Peter Alexiowitz. It was impossible they could be allies ; they must be enemies, and one must sooner or later rise upon the other's ruin. Two suns cannot light up the same hemisphere. Alexander and Darius cannot both be kings of Persia. But there were quali ties in the character of the Czar, which, by an unimpassioned observer, would have been accepted as the omens of eventual victory. His Swedish rival was brave to an excess, abstemious, active, daring, and resolute; but he possessed neither compre-"], [460, "432 POSTSCRIPT VI. hensiveness of intellect nor'sobriety of judgment. In this, above all, the Czar surpassed him: he knew how to wait. No repulse disconcerted him, no labour wearied. Year after year might pass, and he still remained firm in his purpose, as obstinate to carry out a preconceived design as in the hour of its first con ception. He was as brave as his rival, but infinitely more prudent. No dreams of a wild and extravagant ambition deluded him. He knew what work he had to do, and he did it, though storms might threaten, and shadows darken round his path. 38. Having wrung from the reluctant emperor the conces sions which he required, Charles resolved to undertake his long meditated enterprise against Russia. All difficulties removed, all his wishes complied with \u2014 having humiliated the emperor, given laws to his empire, protected the Lutheran religion in a country of Catholics, dethroned one king and crowned another, he prepared to set out. His year of idleness in Saxony had in no wise softened the rigour of his habits. He rode on horseback three times a day, rose from his bed at four in the morning, dressed without the assistance of a valet, drank no wine, remained at table but a quarter of an hour, reviewed his troops daily, and knew no other pleasure than to make Europe tremble. The Swedes had no knowledge of their leader's intended movements ; it was only suspected in the army that he designed to march to Moscow. A few days before his departure, he ordered his grand chamber lain to give him in writing the particulars of the route from Leipzig to \u2014 here he paused a moment, and lest the chamberlain should gain some idea of his designs, he added, laughing \u2014 -\" to all the capitals of Europe.\" The officer brought him a list of all these routes, at the head of one of which he had ventured to inscribe in very large letters, \" Route from Leipzig to Stockholm!' Most of the Swedes longed to return to their homes, but nothing was farther from their king's intentions than to lead them back to Sweden. \" Monsieur,\" said he, \" I see well where you would wish to guide me ; but we shall not so speedily return to Stockholm.\" 39. Charles set out from Saxony in September, 1707, followed by an army of 43,000 men, formerly clad in steel, and now glit tering with gold and silver, and enriched by the spoils of Saxony and Poland. Each soldier took with him fifty crowns in silver. Not only had each regiment its full complement, but every coin-"], [461, "433 A SURPRISE AT GRODNO. pany had several supernumeraries. Besides this army, Count Lewenhaupt, one of the ablest of the Swede generals, awaited his arrival in Poland with 20,000 men. Another army of 15,000 men was posted in Finland, and detachments of recruits were marching from Sweden. With forces so formidable in numbers and discipline, animated by the prestige of victory and encouraged by the hope of plunder, Charles felt assured that he should de throne the Czar. At the head of his cavalry he marched impetu ously across the icy plains and towards Grodno, in the month of January, 1708. He had already crossed the Niemen at two leagues from that town before the Czar knew aught of his enter prise, and the latter rode hastily out of its northern gate while his invincible rival entered it at the south. Charles had swept in advance of the main body of his army with only 600 horsemen, while the Czar who fled before him had 2,000. Learning from a fugitive the small numbers of the Swede king's escort, and that the main army was at least five leagues distant, he hastily despatched 1,500 cavalry to enter Grodno by night, and surprise the hero of Narva in the town. These, under cover of the dark ness, arrived at the advanced guard of the Swedes without dis covery. Thirty soldiers composed it, but they opposed them selves to the Russian mass for several minutes without assistance, and thus afforded time to the king to hasten to the scene of action with the remainder of his guards. Whereupon the Russians fled with shameful precipitation, and the main body of the Swedes rapidly coming up, the Czar retired upon the Beresina. 40. We have detailed in the preceding chapter the incidents of Charles's expedition into Russia ; we have shown what might have been the consequences of his success ; we have described the eventful day of Pultowa, and indicated the fulness of his defeat. Our narrative, therefore, may be taken up at the point where it terminated in the chapter alluded to. (See p. 405.) Hotly pursued by the victorious Russians, the King of Sweden, with the remains of his beaten army, traversed the sterile and arid plains in haste, and after a few days of weary marching, arrived at the river Bog, opposite the Turkish frontier-town of Oczakou. Its inhabitants, recognising them as foreign soldiers by their uniform and language, prohibited them from crossing the river without an order from the governor, Mehemet Pacha ; and the latter dared not venture to grant that order until he had F F"], [462, "434 POSTSCRIPT VI. communicated with the Seraskier of the province, who resided at Bender,in Bessarabia. While the Swedes awaited the result of this communication.the Russians crossed the Borysthenes, and rapidly followed up the track of their retreat. Under these circumstances, Mehemet Pacha sent across the river a small boat to convey to Oczakou the king and two or three of his chief attendants. In this extremity the Swedes took by force what they could not obtain by goodwill, and seizing some barges, effected a passage of the river. At the same moment a favourable reply arrived from the Seraskier ; and an'Aga came to compliment the king, and provide for his conveyance to Bender with a pomp befitting his dignity and fame. He entered the Turkish territory with the firm design of turning the Ottoman arms upon the Russians. He knew the antipathy that existed between the two empires \u2014 an antipathy of race, religion, and manners \u2014 and counted upon making it subservient to the accomplishment of his projects of ambition and revenge. 41. At Bender he was received with true Ottoman hospi tality. A suitable residence was provided for him, and he and his suite, numbering 1,800 persons, were lodged and boarded at the expense of the Sultan. Not the less he was evidently regarded as a prisoner of state, and was required to perceive the difference between the Father of the Faithful, the head of the Ottoman Empire, and the king of a small portion of Scandinavia \u2014 Christian, defeated, and fugitive. The Sultan was as willing, however, to make use of Charles, as Charles in secret was desirous of making use of the Sultan. Poniatowski, at Constantinople, pushed his master's business with energy and address, and a powerful ally was found in Fonseca, a Portuguese Jew and an able physician, established at Constantinople, who had the entree of the Sultan's palace, and conveyed the King of Sweden's letter to the Sultana Valide, the mother of the Sultan, over whom she had considerable influence. A Jewess, who was one of her favourite attendants, never ceased to relate the exploits of the King of Sweden, and charmed her with the animated recital. There is a natural tendency in woman to appreciate the deeds of the brave, and their sympathies are easily excited by the pomp and circum stance of glorious war. It is no marvel, therefore, that the Sultana, though she had never seen the Swedish hero, became one of his most ardent partisans. She called him her \" Lion.\""], [463, "CHARLES XII. AT BENDER. 435 \" When will you send aid,\" she would say to her son, \" when will you send aid to my Lion, and help him to devour the Czar?\" She even transgressed the etiquette of the seraglio so far as to write with her own hands several letters to the Count Poniatowski. ( 42. Voltaire, who was a contemporary of this remarkable monarch, and acquainted with many of his leading councillors, furnishes some interesting details of his residence at Bender. He found there, he says, au abundance of all things, very rarely the fortune of a vanquished and fugitive prince ; for, in addition to a liberal supply of provisions, and 500 crowns daily, provided by the magnificent hospitality of the Sultan, he drew large sums of money from France, and loans from the usurers of Constanti- nople. A part of this money was employed in furthering the intrigues of the seraglio, in bribing the good will of the viziers, or procuring their downfall if obnoxious ; the remainder the king lavished among his officers and the janissaries who formed his body-guard at Bender. Grothusen, his favourite and trea- surer, was the channel of his munificence. He was a man who, in contradistinction to the usual failings of persons in his posi- tion, was even more inclined to liberality than his master. He placed before the king one day an account of the expenditure of 60,000 crowns in two lines : \u2014 \" 10,000 crowns given to the Swedes and janissaries by the generous orders of his Majesty, and the remainder consumed by myself.\" \"This is the mode,\" exclaimed the king, \" in which I love my friends to render their accounts. Mullern makes me read whole pages for sums of 10,000 francs : I prefer the laconic style of Grothusen.\" One of his veteran officers, suspected of miserly habits, complained to the king that he gave all his money to Grothusen. \" I only give my money,\" replied the king, \"to those who know how to make use of it.\" This generosity often reduced him to lack the means wherewithal to maintain it. Greater economy in his munificence would have been more honourable and more useful ; but Charles XII. carried even his virtues to an excess. 43. The force of his character and the splendour of his achievements exercised a magical influence upon the Turks. His abstemiousness from wine, and his regularity in assisting twice a-day at public prayers, drew from them the encomium, \" He is a true Mussulman,\" and they burned with impatience to march under his standard to the conquest of Moscow. Turks F F 2"], [464, "436 POSTSCRIPT VI. and Tartars flocked to Bender in eager crowds, and testified in every wise their admiration and respect. Meanwhile, in his enforced leisure, which was more protracted than he had anticipated, he insensibly acquired a taste for reading. It was Baron Fabricius, a gentleman of the court of the Duke of Holstein \u2014 a young man of amiable temper, endowed with that liveliness of spirit and gaiety of conversation which, for princes whose minds are always revolving great projects, has a peculiar charm, the charm of contrast \u2014 who engaged him in literary studies. He drew the king's attention to the tragedies of Corneille and Racine, and the satires of Boileau. For the latter Charles manifested no partiality ; he preferred his didactic com positions, and when he had perused the eighth satire, in which the poet describes the Macedonian conqueror as a fool and a madman, he angrily tore it in pieces. Of all the tragedies which enrich French literature, \" Mithridates \" was the one which most delighted him, because he saw in the situation of the Politic monarch, when conquered and lusting after vengeance, a parallel to his own. He pointed out to M. Fabricius the passages which struck his attention ; but he would not read any aloud, nor ever hazard a word in French. Even when he received M. Desaleurs, the French ambassador at the Porte, a man of distinguished merit, but who knew no other language than his own, he replied to that ambassador in Latin ; and when M. Desaleurs confessed his ignorance of it, he sent for an interpreter. 44. At last it appeared that the Porte had definitely resolved to engage in hostilities against Russia, and the grand-vizier, Chourlouli-Ali-Bacha, exclaimed to Poniatowski, \" I will take your king in one hand, and my sword in the other, and I will lead him to Moscow at the head of 200,000 men.\" But in the diplomacy of Europe, Russian gold has always accomplished what Russian arms have failed to win on the field of battle, and the military chest captured from the King of Sweden at Pultowa was now employed to counteract his scheme. Its contents were so judiciously distributed, that there suddenly arose at the Turkish court a strong feeling in favour of the Muscovite. Charles was alarmed and astonished, but not discomfited. He adhered to his purpose with that tenacity which was so predominant a feature in his character. It occurred to him that the Sultan was probably ignorant of the vizier's intrigues, and he charged"], [465, "437 WHEELS WITHIN WHEELS. Poniatowski with the dangerous mission of making them known to him. He accomplished it with skill and success. He also contrived to arouse against the vizier the enmity of the Sultana, the kislaraga, and the aga of the janissaries ; and, assisted by the influence of a young favourite of the Sultan, named Coumourli-Ali-Pacha, he actually contrived his downfall. Chour louli was deprived of his office, banished to Kaffa, and Numan Couprougli reigned in his stead. The new vizier, out of a just comprehension of the interests of the Ottoman Empire, was unfavourable to a war with Russia ; but his sense of duty and his love of justice taught him to respect the laws of hospitality towards the King of Sweden. \" Justice,\" he said to the Sultan, \" forbids you to attack the Czar, who has given you no cause of offence ; but it commands you to assist the King of Sweden, who is unfortunate in your dominions.\" He sent to the king 800 purses (each was valued at 500 crowns), and advised him to return peaceably to his own dominions, through the states of Germany, or in the French vessels then lying at Constantinople, which the French ambassador offered to place at his disposal. But Charles was convinced that sooner or later he should engage the Turks to declare war against Russia, and would accept no counsel that pointed towards his return home with his pride and vengeance unsatisfied. He never ceased to represent to the Ottoman court how formidable was this Czar whom he had once treated with the contempt of indifference ; he insinuated that Pierre Alexiowitz was labouring to obtain the command of the Black Sea ; that, after subduing the Cossacks, he would pounce upon Crimean Tartary. Charles did not err in attributing the vastest projects to the Russian emperor; but he forgot that it was his own arrogance and folly which had permitted to them a chance of success. He forgot, moreover, in the heat of his implacable hatred against his conqueror, that his residence at Bender exposed his dominions to the attacks of his many enemies, and that he was merging the interests of his country in a vain attempt to secure the gratification of his personal passions. While he was intriguing against viziers, and wavering between the extremes of hope and despondency, according as his influence or that of the Czar appeared to predominate at the Turkish court, what he had accomplished in Poland was undone, and Augustus re-mounted the throne of which he had been deprived."], [466, "438 POSTSCRIPT VI. Viborg and Carelia fell into the hands of the Czar, whose troops inundated Finland, and took possession of Livonia. Denmark seized upon Holstein and Bremen ; Prussia revived her claims to Swedish Pomerania ; and the glory of Sweden, which under Charles had reached its climax, seemed also under his fatal auspices threatened with sudden extinction. And still the king plotted and intrigued at Bender ! 45. His wishes, however, seemed to approach their fulfilment in the month of July, 1710, and a twelvemonth's weary waiting promised a favourable result. Couprougli was deposed, and banished to the island of Negropont, and his high office was filled by Alep Baltagi-Mehemet, the Pacha of Syria, who opposed no obstacle to the war-spirit of the seraglio. The Russian ambassador was committed a prisoner to the Castle of the Seven Towers. The Khan of the Crimean Tartars was directed to hold himself in readiness with 40,000 men, and bought by the gold and flatteries of the King of Sweden, obtained permission to assemble them at Bender, under that sovereign's eyes, that Europe might plainly see it was in his interests that Turkey made war. This permission, however, was withdrawn by Baltagi, and Adrianople was appointed as the rendezvous of the Turkish army. To meet the impending storm, the Czar hastily gathered together an army of 40,000 men, and traversing Moldavia and Wallachia, he appeared, in the month of June, 1711, on the northern bank of the Pruth, since so famous in the annals of the Crimean war. He was accompanied by the Czarina Catherine, whom he had recently declared his lawful wife, and whose counsel in the ensuing struggle proved of infinite value to him. 46. The Czar in this campaign had been guilty of the same imprudence as Charles in the campaign which closed so dis astrously at Pultowa : he had despised his enemy, and now deprived of- the Prince of Moldavia, upon whom he had relied for reinforcements and provisions, and who had been suddenly deposed by the Sultan, he found himself at a distance from his communications, with empty magazines, and in a country desti tute of every resource. With an army of 44,000 men, he was opposed to an army of 100,000. He resolved, however, to pro secute the enterprise he had so rashly begun, and crossed the Pruth on the 19th of June, near Jassy, the capital of the Prince of Moldavia. Here he was joined by Cantemir, the Hospodar"], [467, "BATTLE ON THE PRTJTn. 439 of Wallachia, with a few attendants. They continued their march down the southern bank of the Pruth until the 21st, \" when we met,\" says one who served in the campaign, \"a prodigious swarm of locusts, which, at their rising, overshadowed the whole army like a cloud; they had not only destroyed the grass of the fields, but also the tender bark and leaves of the trees. It is remarkable,\" he adds, \" that the locusts never left our army, and we no sooner pitched our tents than they came down and covered the whole camp. We tried, by firing of cannon and small arms, and burning trains of powder on the ground, to drive them away, but all in vain ; they attended us on our march along the river until the 27th, when we discovered the Turkish army crossing the Pruth. Upon this, General James was detached, with a body of troops and twelve pieces of cannon, to dispute their passage ; but he was too late, for half their army had passed before he could get up to them, so that he found it prudent to retreat to the main body of the army. It was very surprising that we had not the least intelligence of so numerous an army, which consisted of not less than 200,000 men, till they were actually within sight of us.\" 47. The Russians immediately formed in line of battle, but the Turks avoided a close engagement, endeavouring with their clouds of cavalry to surround the small army of their enemy, and cut them off from the river. Peter opposed this movement by an able man\u0153uvre, which retired his flank upon the right bank of the Pruth ; but his troops got separated in the dark, and fell into such confusion, that the Turks might have crushed them with facility had they been directed by a sagacious and enterprising commander. They passed the night, however, in entrenching themselves. On the morrow, at daybreak, the Czar drew up his army in battle array, forming it into a hollow square, the river occupying the fourth side, and the baggage forming an encampment for the protection of the Czarina and the ladies who accompanied her. On the opposite bank of the Pruth the Crimean Tartars were posted, whose cannon inflicted consider able injury on the Russians. Thus circumstanced, they were called upon to endure, for three successive days, the assaults of the Turks, who, however, lost their advantage in numbers by directing all their attacks against one side of the square. The action was fiercely contested, but, though the Turks were"], [468, "440 rosTSCRirT vi. repulsed with loss, the Czar had every reason to apprehend destruction. He had lost 16,000 men, and his ammunition was nearly expended. Often, in his later life, he would declare that he had never experienced such agony of mind as in this moment of imminent peril, for he knew that the fulfilment of the mighty projects which occupied his busy intellect, depended on his escape from the Turkish hosts. The Czarina came to his aid when no others could give him counsel. She saw that the only hope of safety was in making peace with the Turks, and she knew that few Turkish dignitaries are insensible to a bribe. She caused the vice-chancellor to write a letter to the vizier in the name of the Czar. By dint of prayers and tears she persuaded Peter to sign it. Then she gathered together all her jewelry, and everything valuable to be found in the camp, and sent the costly gift with the letter to the vizier, Mehemet-Baltagi. Other gifts were bestowed upon persons of influence in the Ottoman councils, and the vizier, by no means anxious to prosecute the war in favour of the Swedish king if he could conclude it with advan tage to the Sultan, granted the Czar these terms : that he should surrender Azoph, and burn the ships of war collected in its harbour; that he should demolish the fortifications be had erected on the Black Sea ; that the cannon and stores in those fortresses should be given up to the Sultan ; that the Czar should withdraw his troops from Poland, pay a subsidy to the Tartars, and permit the King of Sweden to return in safety to his own kingdom. This treaty concluded, the Czar was allowed to retire with his army, his artillery, his colours, and his baggage (July 21, 1711). The Turks munificently supplied his troops with an abundance of provisions. 48. At the very time that the Czar withdrew from his perilous position, with beat of drum and colours flying, arrived the King of Sweden from Bender, whence he had ridden in hot haste to see and share in the overthrow of his detested enemy. Ponia towski apprised him of the concluded treaty, and pointed out the departing Russians. Mad with rage, he strode fiercely into the tent of the grand-vizier, and reproached him bitterly with having concluded peace. \" It is my right,\" replied the vizier, calmly, \" to make war and peace.\" \" But,\" rejoined the king, \" had you not the whole Russian army in your power ?\" \" Our aw orders us,\" was the reply, \" to make peace with our enemies"], [469, "441 CHARLES QUARRELS WITH THE PORTE. when they implore our compassion.\" \" Ah !\" exclaimed the angry king, \" does it enjoin upon you to make a shameful treaty, when you might impose what conditions you chose ? Did it not rest with you to lead the Czar a prisoner to Constantinople ? \" The Turk, deeply angry, answered drily, \" Alas ! who would govern his empire in his absence ? It is not fitting that all the kings should be absent from their kingdoms.\" Charles answered the taunt with a scornful and indignant smile : he flung himself upon a sofa, and, regarding the vizier with an air of contempt and wrath, stretched his leg towards him, and purposely entangling his spur in his robe, tore it largely. Rising immediately, he remounted his horse, and returned to Bender with despair clutching at his heart. 49. He was soon afterwards ordered to quit the Turkish territory, and menaced with the anger of the Sultan unless he complied. His yearly allowance from the Turkish court was also stopped, and he reduced to the lowest extremes of poverty. The plots in which he engaged to embroil the Porte anew with the Russian rulers, only covered him with ridicule. Yet he obstinately remained at Bender, as if the King of Sweden had no duties to fulfil in his own kingdom, as if the sole object of his existence was to avenge himself upon Peter Alexiowitz. A sorry spectacle it seems to us, this caballing with eunuchs and sultanas, with viziers and seraglios, when a throne remained unfilled, and a nation was left without its prince ! Constantinople, as Voltaire remarks, had now become what Rome was formerly, the centre of the negotiations of Christendom. France supported the interests of Charles ; the imperial ambassador opposed him. England and Holland were in favour of the Czar, who was en couraging commerce by the development of the resources of his empire. Distracted by these opposiug currents, the Porte was eager to solve its difficulties by ridding itself of their cause, and notified to the king its desire that he should retire from Bender, offering him an escort of 8,000 men. He alleged that he had no money to pay his debts. When asked their amount, he replied at hazard, for his only object was to gain time, 1,000 purses, or \u00a362,000. The Sultan, with splendid liberality, forwarded 1,200 purses, or \u00a375,000, and ordered that every precaution should be taken to ensure his return in safety to his own kingdom. He then declared that yet another thousand purses would be"], [470, "442 POSTSCRIPT VI. needed. The Sultan, justly indignant, sent imperative orders to the Pacha of Bender to expel the madman from his dominions. '\u25a0 Obey your master if you dare,\" exclaimed the enraged king, \" and leave my presence.\" The Pacha retired, but he imme diately curtailed his supply of provisions, and deprived him of his guard of janissaries, leaving him with the officers of his household and 300 Swedes, to contend with 20,000 Tartars and 6,000 Turks, who surrounded his little camp on every side. 50. In the moment of danger Charles was most himself. Undismayed by the perils which gathered around him, he caused his men to throw up a regular series of defences, at whose construction he worked as lustily as the meanest soldier. He barricaded the windows, he strengthened the doors, and then sat down with his favourite, Grothusen, to play a game of chess. The English minister to his court and the envoy, of the Duke of Holstein interfered in vain to bend his resolution. He would not swerve from his inflexible design ; he would not quit Bender. He persisted in declaring the orders of the Sultan a forgery, repulsed his chaplains in anger, and would not hearken to the remonstrances of his officers. In secret he flat tered himself with the idea of the world's wonder at his sustain ing with 300 Swedes the attack of a whole army. He forgot that Bender was not Thermopyl\u00e6, and that the world might rather laugh at the folly than admire the courage of the attempt. Wide, indeed, the difference between the 300 heroes who defended the liberties of Greece at the pass of Thermopyl\u00e6, and the wild, headstrong soldier-king who resisted at Bender the wishes, as he had abused the hospitality, of a generous host ! 51. Charles now ordered every Swede to his post. His chan cellor Mullern, the secretary Empreus, and the clerks, were entrusted with the defence of the house of the chancery ; Baron Fief, and the officers of the kitchen, were placed at another point ; at a third he stationed the cooks and grooms \u2014 for with him every man was a soldier ; he himself galloped to and fro between his palace and his fortifications, promising rewards to every one, creating officers, and promising to make captains of the lowest valets if they fought with courage. The Turks opened the attack with the fire of ten pieces of cannon and two mortars ; they raised their horse-tail standards in the air ; the clarions rang out sharply ; on all sides arose the cry of Alia !"], [471, "LE ThTE-DE-FER. 443 Alia ! Grothusen remarked that they mingled with their shouts no insult to the king, but called him only Demirbash, or \" Iron -head.\" Suddenly the faithful Swede took the resolution of issuing alone, and unarmed, from the entrenchments; and calmly advancing towards the ranks of the janissaries, many of whom had experienced the king's liberality, he addressed them in their own language \u2014 \" What, my friends, would you massacre 300 defenceless Swedes ? You, brave janissaries, who forgave 100,000 Russians because they implored your pardon! Have you forgotten the benefits you have received from us '? Would you assassinate that great King of Sweden whom you love so well, and who has treated you with such munificence ? My friends, he asks but three days, and the orders of the Sultan are not so severe as you have been taught to believe.\" 52. These words produced an effect which Grothusen had not anticipated. The janissaries swore upon their beards that they would not attack the king, and that he should have the three days' grace he demanded. In vain the signal of assault was given. The Pacha had no resource but to retire them to Bender, where he summoned the officers and the oldest soldiers, and produced the written orders and fctfa of the Grand Signior. Sixty white headed veterans, who had shared in the Swede king's liberality, then offered to repair to his presence, and endeavour to secure his peaceful submission. The Pacha willingly consented, for he had no desire to be an agent in the death of Charles. To the Swedish camp, on the following day, they accordingly repaired, carrying in their hands only their long white staves, their usual insignia when they were not armed for the fight. They told their errand to the Baron Grothusen and the Chancellor Mullern, but Charles, not yet convinced that he could yield without dis honour, treated their proposals with contempt. He would rather perish by the hands of the Turks than remain their prisoner. He dismissed the janissaries without according them an inter view, and swore that if they did not immediately depart he would cut off their beards \u2014 an insult which the Orientals regard with peculiar indignation. Wrathful to excess, the veterans returned to Bender, crying, \" Ah the Iron-head! Since he wishes to perish, let him perish!\" When they related to their comrades the result of their mission, they swore unanimously to obey the Pacha's orders without delay, and were as eager to march to"], [472, "444 POSTSCRIPT VI. the assault as the preceding day they had been ready to defer it. The signal was given immediately ; the Turks advanced to the entrenchments ; the Tartars were already posted for the attack. The artillery began its fire, and the janissaries on the one side, the Tartars on the other, broke through the frail defences in a moment. Scarcely twenty Swedes could draw their swords ; all were instantly captured, and made prisoners without resist ance. The king was then riding between his house and his camp with his generals, Hord, Dardoff, and Sparre. Seeing that his soldiers allowed themselves to be taken prisoners in his very presence, he coolly said to the three officers, \" Come, let us defend the house ! We will fight,\" he added, with a smile, \" pro aris et focis.\" They galloped hastily towards the house, where he had posted forty domestics, and which he had fortified as best he could. But when they reached the gate they found it besieged already by the janissaries ; some 200 Turks or Tartars had entered by a window, and made themselves masters of all the rooms, with the exception of a large saloon whither the king's servants had retired. It was fortunately near the gate by which the king sought to force an entrance. He had cast himself from his horse, with a sword in one hand and a pistol in the other, and with his attendants battled fiercely in the melee. The janissaries fell upon them in overpowering numbers. Charles fought with all the desperation of the old Norse Vikings from whom he was descended, but numbers overpowered him. Seized by a score of janissaries, he flung his sword into the air, to spare himself the pain of surrendering it, and the Turks bore him in triumph to the Pacha's quarters, some holding his legs, others his arms, as one might carry an invalid, whom one fears to inconvenience. But now that the struggle was over, the king's fury suddenly subsided. Not an angry word escaped his lips, not a frown obscured his brow, and he permitted himself to be borne, without a struggle, into the presence of the Pacha : a melodramatic, nay, a farcical result to a sombre tragedy ! Farcical, indeed, except to the victims of an obstinacy which partook of madness rather than heroic courage ! 53. The Pacha transferred his prisoner, without delay, to Adrianople, where he was admitted to an audience of the Sultan, and amused with courteous speeches and words of pleasant promise. He remained at Adrianople for several months, still"], [473, "CHARLES SETS OUT FROM TURKEY. 445 nourishing the delusive hope of making war upon the Czar, with 100,000 Turks, and upon some new and glorious battle field wiping out in blood the accursed disgrace of Pultowa. Meanwhile, in Europe, it was reported that he was dead. The council of regency, which he had established at Stockholm before he entered the lists against Russia and Poland, no longer received any intelligence from him. The senate unanimously besought the Princess Ulrica-Eleanora, his sister, to assume the regency during the king's prolonged absence. She accepted the charge. But when she found that the senate wished to constrain her to make peace with the Czar and the King of Denmark, whose forces enveloped unhappy Sweden on every side, the princess, rightly judging that her brother would never ratify such a peace, resigned the regency, and forwarded to Charles a full account of the situation. The intelligence reached Charles in his inaction at Demotica. Bred and nourished in despotic principles, he forgot that Sweden was formerly free, and that the senate anciently governed the nation conjointly with the king. He looked upon that august body as upon a troop of lackeys, who sought to rule in a house during the absence of their master ; and wrote to them that if they dared to govern he would send them one of his boots from which they should take their orders ! 54. The safety of his realm from foreign foes concerned him not so nearly as the attempt to encroach upon his sovereign rights ; and what he chose to consider the treason of the senate could at last recall him to his kingdom when no consideration of its welfare was able to affect him. He intimated to the grand vizier his intention of returning to Sweden by way of Germany. Several costly gifts were lavished upon him by the generosity of the Sultan. Sixty chariots laden with all kinds of pro visions, and 300 horses, composed his convoy. Thus attended, he set out from Demotica on the 1st of October, 1714, and proceeded with tolerable regularity as far as the frontiers of Germany. Here, with that lust of notoriety which was the predominant motive of his conduct, hearing that the emperor had given orders for his suitable reception in every town he passed through, he dismissed all his escort, and accompanied by one attendant, named During, he disguised himself as a German officer, and passed on horseback through Hungary, Moravia,"], [474, "446 POSTSCRIPT VI. Austria, Bavaria ; through Wurtemburg, the Palatinate, West phalia, and Mecklenburg ; thus making the tour of almost all Germany, and greatly lengthening his journey. At the end of the first \"day, having ridden without relief, young During, who was not hardened by constant fatigue like his royal companion, fainted while dismounting from his horse. The king, who did not wish to delay one moment on his route, asked his page, when he had recovered himself, how much money he had. During having answered that he had about 1,000 crowns in gold, \u2014 \" Give me half,\" said the king ; \" I perceive that you are not in a condition to follow me, and will finish my journey alone.\" During implored him to rest but three hours, assuring him that, at the expiration of that time, he should be able to remount his horse and follow him ; but the king was immoveable, took 500 crowns, and prepared for his departure. The youth then bethought him of an innocent stratagem ; he drew aside the post-master, and pointing out the King of Sweden, said, \" This man is my cousin : we are travelling together on the same business. He sees that I am ill, and is disinclined to wait for me only three hours. Give him, I beg of you, the worst horse in your stable, and seek for me some post-chaise or chariot.\" Two ducats in the post-master's hands enforced his requests. The king was mounted on a lame and restive horse, and thus provided, set out alone at ten o'clock at night, \u2014 the heavens black as pitch, the snow falling thickly, and the wind hurrying across the plain with a terrible roar ! His attendant slept for a few hours, and then set out in a chariot drawn by strong horses. After some miles' rapid driving, he overtook, at daybreak, the King of Sweden, who, unable to spur his jaded steed any further, was about to travel a-foot to the next posting-house. He got into During's chariot, and fell asleep upon the straw. Thus they continued their journey ; on horseback during the day, and sleeping in the carriage by night, but never pausing even for an hour. On the 21st of November, 1714, they reached the gates of Stralsund at one hour after midnight, and after some delay ob tained admittance. Charles hastened to the house of the Swedish governor, General Ducker, and taking him by his arm, for he was in bed and half asleep, exclaimed, \" What, Ducker, have my most faithful subjects forgotten me ?\" Ducker could hardly believe his eyes. He flung himself from his bed, and embraced"], [475, "THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE TURNS. 447 the knees of his master, shedding tears of joy. The news of the king's arrival soon spread throughout the town. The inhabitants poured into the streets, uttering cries of joy. Every window blazed with light ; and wine flowed from the fountains and in the public places, sparkling in the lustre of a thousand torches, while the air was rent with the thunder of a hundred guns. 55. The return of Charles lent a new impetus to the war maintained by struggling Sweden against Russia, Denmark, and Poland. But the aspect of affairs was changed. Russia, so easily humiliated at Narva, had grown into a formidable power. Its fleet commanded the waters of the Baltic, and its victorious army occupied the cities of Finland. Sweden, deprived of all its possessions beyond the sea, had now neither commerce, money, nor credit ; its veterans formerly so redoubtable had perished in battle or of want ; more than 100,000 Swedes were toiling as slaves in the vast territories of the Czar, and almost as many had been sold to the Turks and Tartars. Nevertheless, \u2014 such is the confidence that the courage of one man inspires in the hearts of thousands, \u2014 hope flamed up anew in sorrowing Sweden when it was known that Charles XII. had arrived at Stralsund, and its youth hastened from their plough to enlist under his standards, assured that victory would once more crown her favourite hero's arms. 56. But fortune no longer attended Charles XII. His enemies were everywhere triumphant, and almost every day brought him the intelligence of some new disaster, of a defeat of his troops, or the loss of a portion of his territory. At length he was besieged in Stralsund by the forces of Denmark and Prussia, amounting to some 36,000 men. The trenches were opened on the night of the 19th of October, and the works were pushed forward with a vigour which derived an additional stimulus from the known presence of the King of Sweden within the doomed fortress. The besieged were animated in their defence by the same cause. Several sorties were made with the most desperate courage, in which the king lost many of his best-loved veterans, but they did not daunt the resolution of the besieging army. Stralsund was forced to surrender on the 22nd of December, 1715; but, on the 20th, Charles effected his escape to Carlscona, under circumstances of perilous difficulty. He was accompanied by ten persons only, and they had to break away"], [476, "448 POSTSCRIPT VI. the ice to form a passage for their boat. Once clear of the harbour, they were compelled to run the gauntlet of the enemy's ships of war, and dare the fire of the Danish batteries on the Isle of Rugen, which killed two of the king's companions. But the Providence which watches over kings rescued him from every danger, and he arrived at Carlscona in safety. He had quitted that port just fifteen years before in a vessel of 100 guns to startle the north with the splendour of his conquests ; he returned to it a fugitive from a city which not even his presence and daring valour could save from the enemy. 57. It was supposed that Charles would now visit his capital after his prolonged absence ; but he could not resolve to present himself before his subjects until the fame of some new victory should conceal the disgrace of years of captivity and misfortune. He had conceived an extraordinary design, and hastened to carry it into execution. Though Sweden was assailed on every side, though hostile fleets drove her commerce off the seas, and hostile armies occupied her most fertile provinces, though fifteen years of war had drained her of her manhood and exhausted her resources, he thought neither of acting on the defensive, nor of concluding peace with his enemies. The love of notoriety was still his governing passion. He meditated how he should most astonish Europe, not how he should best give repose to his distracted kingdom ; and assuredly, it was with the utmost surprise that Europe watched him abandon his beleaguered realm to advance, in March, 1716, into Norway, at the head of 20,000 men. \" Since Hannibal,\" says Voltaire, \" there had not been seen a general, who, unable to maintain himself in his own country against his enemies, ventured to carry the war into their own country.\" But the conditions of the two generals were widely different. Hannibal had only to contend with a single foe, and was assisted by many allies. Charles, without resources, without friends, almost without an army, was engaged with several enemies ; and the subjugation of Norway, if he had effected it, would not have seriously influenced tbe fortunes of the war. But at this time a subtle diplomatist, Baron Gortz, a Franconian, who had rendered him important services during his sojourn at Bender, exercised a remarkable ascendancy over him. Gortz had observed a want of cordiality between the Czar and his allies, England, Denmark, Poland, and Prussia. He knew also"], [477, "449 INTRIGUES OF BARON GORTZ. that the Czar was sorely in need of money, and he conceived the design of detaching him from the confederacy by ministering to his wants, and surrendering the provinces which bounded the Baltic on the east and north. A firm alliance thus cemented between Sweden and Russia, he was convinced that the two great kings, Peter and Charles, might impose laws upon the rest of Europe, replace Stanislas on the throne of Poland, and the son of James II. on that of England, restore his estates to the Duke of Holstein, and indemnify Sweden at the expense of Denmark. The fallacy of such a project must be apparent to the most superficial observer : no long peace could have prevailed between characters so opposite as Peter and his rival ; but at all events it secured Sweden from a Russian invasion in the winter of 1715, and Charles contentedly advanced to the conquest of Norway. 58. The severity of a northern winter did not retard his operations, but his army suffered sensibly from want of provi sions, and a Danish fleet and army arriving to cover the Nor wegian capital, he was compelled to retire into Sweden. His disappointment induced him to embark with more vigour in the intrigues of Baron Gortz, who visited the European capitals to foment conspiracies against their monarchs, and weaved a net work of subtle projects too fine not to be easily broken. His designs were discovered, and Gortz, having forfeited the character of an ambassador by engaging in plots against the sovereigns to whom he was accredited, was arrested at Deventer, and Gyllem bourg, the Swedish ambassador to England, in London. They remained in prison several months, but were liberated in August, 1717. 59. Charles, however, still glowing with ambition and the desire of fame, undertook for a second time the conquest of Norway, in the month of October, 1718 ; and he had so carefully developed his plans that he believed himself able to subdue that kingdom in six months. But this project is another proof of the incapacity of this wild, rude warrior to understand the true interests of his country. Instead of attempting to recover the rich German provinces which he had lost during his captivity at Bender, he pleased himself with the hope of snatching a king dom from his arrogant enemy.

Hanover Bremen, and Russia Pomerania, he, nevertheless, planted his triumphant standard at Drontheim, aud overran Norway with his victorious arms ? 60. At the mouth of the river Tistendafl, and near the Danish channel, is situated FrederickshaLa strong and important post, not unjustly regarded as the key of the kingdom. Charles invested it in the month of December. The soldier, perishing with cold, could scarcely break up the hardened and ice-bound earth ; one might almost as easily have dug a trench in the rock ; but the Swedes seeing their king a partner in their fatigues were unable to complain. Charles had never been capable of more daring actions, for his constitution, tested by eighteen years of hardships, was so hardy and robust that he slept in the open fields of Nor way, in the heart of winter, upon a heap of straw or a plank, covered only with his cloak. Yet many of the soldiers fell dead at their posts. \"With this body of iron,\" says Voltaire, \" animated by so bold and defiant a spirit, to whatever condition he might be reduced, there was no neighbouring monarch to whom he was not an object of apprehension.\" 61. On the 11th of December, St. Andrew's Day, about nine o'clock in the evening, he went to inspect the fortifications, and pausing at one particular point, he fell upon his knees, rest ing his elbows on the parapet, that he might examine at ease the operations of his engineers. His body was partially exposed to the fire of a hostile battery, but this was not a circumstance at all likely to affect his movements. Near him stood the engineer Megret, and M. Siquier, his aide-de-camp- A few paces in the rear stood three other officers. Suddenly, Megret and Siquier saw the king fall forward on the parapet, heaving a deep sigh. They ran to his aid ; he was already dead. A ball, weighing half a pound, had struck him on the right temple, piercing a large orifice, and crashing into both eye-balls. The moment of his wound was also that of his death, but nevertheless he had the strength, in that swift last agony, to grasp his sword with his hand, and in an attitude so characteristic he lay dead. The body was wrapped in a gray cloak, and unrecognised by the army, removed to the quarters of his brother-in-law, the Prince Frederick of Hesse-Cassel. 62.

He left a notable example, but one which men may admire and wonder at, without pretending to imitate. His very virtues he carried to an excess ; his courage was temerity, his firmness obstinacy, his love of fame grew into a lust of notoriety, his liberality degenerated into profusion, his justice was sharpened into cruelty. Thus his best qualities became injurious to his sub jects ; and his reign was one wild dream of conquest, one burning, raging fever of battle, which wore out the strength and exhausted the resources of his kingdom. Nevertheless, the part played by Sweden in European affairs under his government is a remarkable illustration of the influence exercised by force of character, and shows how formidable to the world a man of determined will and resolute purpose may contrive to render himself.

It was, nevertheless, one of Marl borough's most brilliant successes, and called forth all his extra ordinary abilities as a strategist. The coolest courage, the most indomitable resolution, the highest faculty of concentration, and the swiftest comprehension, could only, on the terrible field of Malplaquet, extort a victory from the enemy. 2. After the battle of Oudenarde (in 1708), Marlborough, as usual, returned to England to carry on that political campaign which was necessary as the campaign in the field. He found his party seriously weakened by the death of his powerful adherent, Prince George of Denmark, and the insidious attacks of Harley and his followers. But a greater danger existed in the violence of his duchess, who behaved to the queen, even on public occa sions, with a haughty insolence completely unparalleled in all the scandalous chronicles of courts. The queen at length took corn-age, and the duchess was compelled to resign her offices, and withdraw her arrogance from the royal closet. To the suc cessful general, however, the usual votes of thanks were presented by both Houses of Parliament, and for a time the influence of his presence seemed to compose the struggles of party, and subdue the acrimonv of faction. 3. France, in 1709, had been reduced, by a prolonged but unsuccessful war, to a condition of extreme distress ; it groaned under an intolerable weight of taxation, and lamented the cease less drain of its population to replace the terrible losses of its armies in the battle-field. A succession of scanty harvests in creased the general misery ; the highways were infested with banditti ; insurgent mobs burnt and plundered in the great towns ; and as the fortresses on the frontier were occupied by the Allies, it seemed probable that the horrors of an invasion would soon be added to its other woes. A powerful peace party, therefore, sprang into the foremost place, and Louis XIV., baffled in all his mighty schemes, was not unwilling to listen to its voice. 4. Nor, on the part of the Allies, existed there any reluctance to enter upon negotiations. The Dutch had already secured the main objects for which they had entered into the war. In England"], [483, "PREPARATIONS FOR WAR. 455 the Tories and Jacobites laboured in the interests of the Pre tender to arouse a public feeling in favour of a speedy peace. Still, at first the negotiations were unsuccessful. Louis asked more than the Allies could agree to concede, and persistently maintained the claims of his grandson to the throne of Spain. England required that Louis should acknowledge Queen Anne as her rightful sovereign ; should recognise the Protestant suc cession ; remove the Pretender from France ; destroy the for tifications of Dunkirk ; and restore the whole Spanish monarchy to the house of Austria. At the same time the English govern ment intimated to the states that neither of the allies ought to conclude a separate treaty with France. For the present, there fore, the diplomatists were worsted, and Marlborough prepared to resume the direction of the war.* 5. Louis once more made immense exertions to place in the field a force capable of contending with the Allies, in the hope that some brilliant success might enable him to dictate his own terms of peace. The command of the large and well-appointed army, which, at an immense sacrifice, he succeeded in bringing together, he conferred upon Villars \u2014 the most fortunate and the ablest of his marshals, whom he was wont to honour with the title of \" Invincible \"\u25a0 \u2014 and early in June his troops moved to take up a defensive position on the Scarpe and the Lys. 6. The Allies, in like manner, concentrated their masses at a camp pitched between Menin and Oudenarde, and having assem bled a force of 110,000 men, on the 23rd of June moved towards the enemy, with the view of bringing on a general engagement. But finding that Villars had thrown up exten sive fortifications along his whole line, they determined upon laving siege to Tournay, while amusing him with such demon strations as should lead him to believe an attack intended. Marlborough and Eugene succeeded in their object, and by a rapid and secret march, fell upon Tournay totally unexpected. * That Marlborough was averse to these negotiations is well known, but that he was actuated in his opposition by a desire of further aggrandisement is a gratuitous calumny. Fond as he was of money, he rejected with contempt the immense bribes by \"which the French plenipotentiary sought to secure his favour. He had imbibed from William III. a sincere distrust of the ambitious policy of France ; and it was his object so to reduce her power and diminish her influence that she might be unable again to assume the dictatorship of Europe. Mail borough was a better statesman and a truer patriot than the specious Bolingbroke, or crafty Harley."], [484, "456 BATTLE OF MALPLAQUET. The town was strongly fortified, and its citadel, designed by Vauban, was considered the most perfect of its kind. Neverthe less, the allied combinations had been so masterly, and the investment was prosecuted with such vigour, that this great fortress, which, it was supposed, could defy any hostile force, capitulated on the 18th of July, after a siege of one-and-twenty days. The citadel was next beleaguered, but, to spare a useless effusion of blood, the commandant proposed that it should be peaceably surrendered, unless relieved by the French within a month. Louis XIV., however, refused to ratify his officer's proposal, and the investment was accordingly prosecuted with all imaginable vigour. The numerous subterranean works by which the ground was burrowed, and its labyrinth of mines, rendered the task one of the bloodiest ever undertaken by the allied army. But on the 3rd of September, it was successfully completed, and the citadel surrendered. 7. The shock of war was next directed against Mons, another of the important fortresses which defended the French frontier. But Villars and Marshal Boufflers, then serving with him, seemed loth that the capital of Hainault should fall without a struggle, and made various movements which indicated their intention to raise the siege at the cost of a battle. Marlborough and Eugene accordingly pressed forward to meet them, and found them strongly posted near the woods of Sarte and Taisnieres. There they had raised three strong lines of defences, though the nature of the ground \u2014 intersected as it was by ditches, hedges, and enclosures \u2014 rseemed to render artificial fortifications unnecessary. The whole strength of the Allies not having come up, the two generals were forced to waste a day, which gave the French time to render their position almost impregnable. Nevertheless, in the belief that another great victory would compel Louis to sue for peace on more admissible terms, Marlborough resolved to give the enemy battle. 8. The allied forces, on the morning of the memorable 11th of September, amounted to 129 battalions and 252 squadrons, or about 93,000 men, with 101 pieces of cannon and 4 mortars. Villars and Boufflers, within their formidable entrenchments, had gathered 130 battalions and 260 squadrons, with a train of 80 pieces of cannon. These included the elite of the French army, and the pride and boast of the French chivalry, all eager"], [485, "ATTACK ON TIIE FRENCH CENTRE. 457 to share in the great battle which was, they knew, their master's last stake for empire. 9. Marlborough made his dispositions with admirable skill, displaying in this, his latest fight, all the strength of his genius, all the fertility of his resources. Nor was Prince Eugene unworthy to share in the honours of the day. Throughout the terrible conflict he displayed a wonderful courage, prompti tude, and resolution. And the men who fought under them deserved such leaders ; advancing under a fearful fire, in the face of a hundred obstacles, as if moving before a king's eye upon some gay and glittering parade. 10. The attack commenced about half-past seven in the morning by the advance of two dense columns of infantry against the right and centre of the French. The Prince of Orange's column suddenly halted, while Count Lottum's men moved forward through a storm of shot \u2014 a very feu d'enfer, as the French expressively call it \u2014 until they reached the rear of the foremost of their own batteries, when they formed into three lines. Schulemberg's 40 battalions were drawn up in the same manner, and both masses immediately pushed forward against the enemy's left wing, while Lord Orkney hurled his own brigades upon the centre. They were received, when within pistol shot, with such a terrific and murderous volley that, veterans as they were, they recoiled two hundred yards. But again they marched to the death, and, Gouvain's brigade having moved against the hostile flank, a faint impression was made upon the enemy's line. 11. The chief attack upon the French centre was led by Marlborough himself. His troops, with the coolness of heroes, pressed unshaken through hedges and enclosures, across rivulets and swamps, and made a furious effort to scale the enemy's breastwork, where Villars boldly encouraged his men, and from each point poured forth an awful and avenging fire. Meanwhile, the column we have spoken of as led by the Prince of Orange, and whose onset was delayed by Marlborough until an appointed time, would no longer be restrained, and, led by their ardent chief, advanced in full force, and with a tremendous rush, against the enemy. They fell by scores. Lieutenant- General Oxenstiern was slain at the prince's side. The prince himself had his horse shot under him. Still they advanced;"], [486, "458 BATTLE OF MALPLAQUET. they reached the entrenchment ; they carried it at the point of the bayonet. A furious charge, headed by Marshal Boufflers, drove \"them out of it as soon as gained, and the lines, shattered by crushing volleys, began to waver. The Prince of Orange snatched a standard from the nearest regiment, and almost alone, springing upon the breastwork, planted it there. \" Follow me, my friends,\" he cried ; \" here is your post ! \" A second assault was made, but against the serried masses of the enemy, against their wall of glittering steel and line of deadly fire, it could not prevail. The Allies were beaten back, though maintaining in their retreat an imposing front. In these two desperate attempts they had lost 2,000 killed ; a loss the more to be regretted, as the onset was not made in accordance with Marlborough's original dispositions. 12. Count Lottum's attack had meanwhile been successful, and Villars, in order to strengthen his left against the daring advance of Prince Eugene, having withdrawn some reinforce ments from his centre, the battle now swept to and fro in alternate tides on the right of the allied army. Eugene again and again led up his men to the hostile front, but was finally smitten back by the bayonet in a swift, fierce charge, made under the direction of the heroic Villars. But the French marshal, in the melee, was so severely wounded in the thigh, that his surgeons were compelled to remove him from the field. 13. The battle had now lasted four hours, and yet the allies had but gained the entrenchments and wood on the enemy's left. But Villars and Boufflers, as Marlborough had anticipated, had been forced to mass their infantry on the right and left to meet the terrible attacks advanced against those wings, and had proportionably weakened their centre. Seizing, with his usual felicity of judgment, the right moment for the development of his plans, he now hurled against the enemy's weakest point a heavy force of infantry and cavalry, and supported it by several guns. A deadly struggle ensued ; but the entrenchments were gained. Boufflers then headed a destructive charge with the French household horse \u2014 the gay and glittering chivalry of France \u2014 who, opposed by Marlborough at the head of several British and Prussian squadrons, and with Eugene's cavalry also thundering upon them, were constrained into a reluctant retreat."], [487, "THE SLAUGHTER AT MALPLAQUET. 459 14. The Prince of Orange having once more thrown himself upon the entrenchments of the enemy's right, after a sharp fight had carried them. Baffled, therefore, at all points \u2014 his centre broken through, his right wing dislodged, his left dis comfited \u2014 Boufflers could not but direct a general retreat, and withdrew his troops in tolerable order in the direction of Bavai. The allies had suffered too much on this bloody day to attempt a pursuit ; and the French marshals were enabled to rally their forces with little loss at a strong position between Quesnoy and Valenciennes. 15. The Allies halted near the field of battle on the plain of Malplaquet. Their prisoners, with the exception of 3,000 of the wounded French, amounted only to 500, and they had captured but few cannon or colours. The retreat of the French, and the subsequent capture of Mons, sufficiently proved that the victory was with the Allies ; but in comparison with the fearful cost at which it was won, its results were insignificant. It was one of those victories which are almost as fatal as defeats. 16. The Allies lost at Malplaquet no less than 5,544 killed, 12,706 wounded, in all 18,250. The loss of the French was necessarily much smaller, inasmuch as they were defended by formidable entrenchments, but it exceeded 14,000 men. They fought with brilliant valour, and were worthy of being led by Villars and defeated by Marlborough. As a French officer of distinction, who was present at the battle, observed, \" The Eugenes and Marlboroughs ought to have been well satisfied with us that day ; since, till then, they had not met with resist ance worthy of them. They may say, with justice, that nothing can stand before them : and, indeed, what shall be able to stem the rapid course of these two heroes, if an army of 100,000 of the best troops, posted between two woods, trebly entrenched, and performing their duty as well as any brave men could do, were not able to stop them one day ? Will you not then own with me, that they surpass all the heroes of former ages ? \" 17. The carnage at Malplaquet, much of which was owing to the premature advance of the Prince of Orange, produced a painful effect upon the mind of Marlborough. He wrote to the duchess from the battle-field in anything but an exultant spirit. \" I am so tired,\" he says, \" that I have but strength enough to tell you that we have had this day a very bloody battle ; the"], [488, "460 BATTLE OF MALPLAQUET. first part of the day we beat their foot, and afterwards their horse. God Almighty be praised, it is now in our power to have what peace we please, and I may be pretty well assured of never being in another battle.\" In a similar strain he wrote to Lord Godolphin : \" I have not strength to do anything but that of letting you know that we have had this day a very murdering battle. If the Dutch please, it is now in our power to have what peace we please, and I have the happiness of being pretty well assured that this is the last battle I shall be in.\" 18. In England the news of the victory was at first received with great enthusiasm, and due justice was done to the surpass ing military genius of the great general. But, by degrees, as the extent of the slaughter became known, the popular exulta tion decreased, and Marlborough's enemies seized every means of exciting against him a feeling of indignation, declaring that he had fought the battle and sacrificed so many lives simply to gratify his personal ambition. By Harley's dexterous manage ment a strong peace -party was formed in parliament, and it became evident to all sagacious observers that the Tories, to compass the downfall of the Duke of Marlborough, were pre pared to disregard the best interests of England. The malice of that party against the hero of Blenheim was further embittered by the knowledge that he had entered into a close alliance with the principal adherents of the Elector of Hanover \u2014 the Protes tant heir to the crown. \u2014 and the Jacobites believed that his overthrow would remove the principal obstacle to the restoration of the Stuart dynasty in the person of James III. 19. The capture of Mons, on the 18th of October, was the last event of importance which distinguished the campaign of 1709, and it entirely delivered the frontiers of the Dutch, and the adjacent provinces, from the alarms of war. The French were now reduced to the necessity of defending France, and could no longer menace the Netherlands with their triumphant armies. But for the reader to understand the full historical importance of Malplaquet, it will be necessary to carry our resume a little further. 20. While Marlborough was thus victorious in the field, his influence in the cabinet at home was slowly but surely waning. Between the queen and the duchess there prevailed an open animosity, and the indecent and insolent recriminations of the"], [489, "461 CAMPAIGN OF 1710. latter forbade all hope of a future reconciliation. The queen's mind was further angered and alarmed by an ill-judged attempt of the duke \u2014 whose sagacity detected that his power was gradu ally slipping through his hands \u2014 to secure, at least, his position at the head of the army, by obtaining the unconstitutional grant of the captaincy-general of the queen's forces, at home and abroad, for life. His own friends and counsellors censured this impolitic movement, and his enemies took care to represent it as a bold and audacious effort to establish himself as the mili tary dictator of England. The failure of the negotiations for peace, which Louis had again opened, and doubtless with a sincere desire to conclude them, was also ascribed to Marl borough's ambition, which, it was represented, no expenditure of English blood or treasure could ever satisfy. But, in truth, the failure was owing to the severity of the conditions upon which the Allies insisted, and against which Marlborough him self protested : conditions so harsh and arbitrary that it was hardly to be expected that Louis XIV., who was still the great king of a great nation, would accept them. 21. Hostilities were resumed in April, 1710, and the plan of the campaign concerted between Marlborough and Eugene was a masterly display of the rarest military genius. It aimed at the invasion of France in such force that the Allies should dictate peace in Paris itself, as Wellington did a century later. Douay, a strong fortress on the Scheldt, was first to be taken, and then Arras, by which means the French frontier would be exposed to the irresistible advance of the Allies. The south-eastern pro vinces were, meanwhile, to be invaded on the side of Piedmont ; and these great operations supported by a descent on the coast of Normandy, a combined attack upon Abbeville, and a second expedition against the coast of Languedoc, which was designed to co-operate with the insurgents of the Cevennes. 22. Over the details of these operations, however, our space forbids us to linger. As they had been ably conceived, so they were vigorously executed, wherever the personal superin tendence of Marlborough encouraged his troops and dispirited the enemy. The French lines near Lens, formidable as they were, and defended by Villars in person, were forced with compa ratively little loss. Douay fell, after a stout resistance. Bethune, St. Venant, Aire, each yielded to the Allies ; and there, before"], [490, "462 BATTLE OF MALPLAQUET. the genius of Marlborough, lay, all bare and undefended, the very heart of France. 23. But at the moment of this great success, when the climax of this long and bloody war had been attained, when the sacri fices made by the Allies were about to reap their good results in such a restriction of the power of France as would probably have checked her aggressions for centuries ; when the grand object of William III.'s labours and Marlborough's victories was within the grasp of England, \u2014 the craft of Harley, the treachery of Bolingbroke, and the weak duplicity of Anne, robbed the nation of its prize, and rendered useless all its sufferings and exertions. The Whig ministry was summarily dismissed by the queen, and with every mark of contempt. A Tory cabinet came into power, and though France was now in a position of extreme danger, Louis XIV. suddenly regained his confidence, and no longer pleaded for peace as a suppliant, but almost demanded it with the haughtiness of a conqueror. 24. When Marlborough returned to England, he experienced the full effects of the changes which had taken place. Though the campaign just concluded was one of the most signal displays of his genius, he was neither rewarded with congratulatory addresses nor votes of thanks. But he bore adversity as he bore success ; always with the same serene composure, and imper turbable calm. \" No rash act,\" says one of his biographers, in an able and certainly not over partial sketch of his career, \" no rash act, no hasty expression, evinced that any mortification could cast him from the even tenor of a great mind. Beyond all doubt, he saw the great desire of the new ministers to grant peace to France, and easily divined that that peace would be granted on terms disadvantageous, if not disgraceful, to England. He saw that all his mighty schemes were overthrown, that all his vast efforts were rendered fruitless, that his labour and suc cess for his country were thrown away, and that all the beams of his thousand triumphs, which might have lighted his nation to the summit of power, were now concentrated in the narrower circle of his own glory. He remained, however, unchanged ; and though he might well have paused in his career, content with all that he had acquired, he agreed to risk his glory under a ministry inimical to his person and opposed to his views, in order that as little might be lost as possible to his country in"], [491, "463 CAMPAIGN OF 1711. general. He accordingly resigned all the many places held by his wife at court, but complied with the queen's desire in holding his own command. \" The opposite party, who benefited by his services, attributed to him mercenary motives for yielding them ; but as the advan tage which could accrue to himself was small, the labour great, the risk of his fame and his honour imminent, and as the persons who accused him in this instance impeached their own credi bility by notorious injustice towards the same man on other occasions, it is but fair to view this conduct of the duke in the most honourable light, and to look upon it as another example of that grand moderation which he displayed so often in the course of a long and difficult life.\" * 25. Marlborough reached the Hague on the 4th of March, 1711, and immediately commenced his preparations for the ensuing campaign. It opened in April, and was not unworthy of the general who conducted it. Villars had orders to act strictly on the defensive, and accordingly kept close within the wonderfully strong lines he had raised along the bank of the Scarpe from Arras to Bouchain. Marlborough in vain endea voured to draw him into the open field ; but not succeeding, determined upon the siege of Bouchain, whose possession was, in a strategic sense, of great importance to the allies. His army being inferior to that of the enemy, it was only by skilful man\u0153uvring that he could effect his object, and nothing in all his career was more clearly indicative of his extraordinary mili tary genius than the movements by which he deceived Villars, crossed a country full of dangerous obstructions, and passed the strong barrier of defensive works upon the Scarpe. The French * Another quotation may be permitted us on this subject : \u2014 \" When we con sider the insolence with which Marlborough was treated by the Tory leaders, and the abuse heaped upon him by their subaltern dependants in the ministerial pub lications of the day, we may judge of the little cordiality which existed on either side. We may estimate the mortification which he must have felt for his ill requited services, in continuing in a command where he must have been aware that he was placed only to be dishonoured and disappointed, and to see his efforts marred by the clandestine intrigues of the new ministry with the French court. Pressed, however, on all hands\u2014 by the emperor, the Duke of Savoy, the Elector of Hanover, and the states, as well as by the friendly exhortations of Eugene, the Whigs, and Godolphin \u2014 he reluctantly consented to retain a post where he had little to hope, and all to fear. In the anguish of his mind he confessed to Bishop Burnet that his wishes to resign had been overruled by these concurrent repre sentations, and that he sacrificed himself for the sake of the common cause.\" \u2014 Cjxe's Memoirs, c. 99."], [492, "464 BATTLE OF MALPLAQUET. marshal was greatly mortified by his illustrious antagonist's success, and had to undergo the still severer humiliation of witnessing the investment and capture of Bouchain, without being able to succour its garrison. 26. The fall of Bouchain (September 14) was the last event of the campaign, further military operations in the field being prevented by the inclemency of the weather. Marlborough soon afterwards returned to Eugland, to witness the success of his enemies, and the progress of negotiations for an imperfect and unsatisfactory peace. It was evident that more was intended against him than mere criticisms on his conduct of the war. The clouds which were gathering so luridly and so darkly could but hurl a thunderbolt at his head. It fell at last. 27. The conduct of the English Parliament in this matter was probably never exceeded in baseness. Marlborough was not a perfect man. He was fond of money \u2014 a taste probably acquired in his father's penurious household ; he was uxorious to a fault ; his love of glory was, perhaps, so excessive as to amount to a vice ; but he was incapable of much that the low hirelings of party advanced against him, and he had rendered services of such vast importance to his country and to Europe, that silence might well have been observed with respect to his errors. And what were the accusations that his enemies \u2014 many of whom had been made by his patronage \u2014 dared to hurl at the hero of Blenheim, of Bamillies, of Oudenarde, of Malplaquet ? 1st. He was accused of having received, between 1707 and 1711, from Sir Solomon Medina, contractor for the supply of bread and bread-waggons to the army in the Netherlands, an aggregate of \u00a363,319. The duke, in reply, most clearly proved that such was the ordinary perquisite of the commander-in-chief of the army in the Low Countries, and, \" I do assure you,\" he added, \" that whatever sums I have received on that account, have been con stantly employed for the service of the public, in keeping secret correspondence, and getting intelligence of the enemy's motions and designs.\" 2nd. He was accused of having deducted 1\\ per cent, from the pay of foreign troops in the English service. Marlborough's answer was : \u2014 That the sums provided for secret service money proved insufficient even for the purposes"], [493, "MARLBOROUGIl'S DEFENCE. 465 of William III., and that the king accordingly had obtained from the auxiliary sovereigns, a deduction of 2^ per cent, on the pay of their troops, in lieu of all other stoppages. That when he succeeded to the command in chief he was empowered by the queen's royal warrant, dated July 6, 1702, to receive the same allowance, and employ it without account for the benefit of the public service. 28. In concluding this vindication, which he laid before the commissioners appointed to inquire into these charges, he said, with his usual splendid moderation and self-composure : \u2014 \" And now, gentlemen, as I have laid the whole matter fairly before you, and I hope you will allow I have served my queen and country with that faithfulness and zeal which becomes an honest man, the favour I entreat of you is, that when you make your report to the parliament, you will lay this part before them in its true light, so that they may see that this necessary and important part of the war has been provided for and carried on without any other expense to the public than \u00a310,000 a year. And I flatter myself that when the accounts of the army in Flanders come under your consideration, you will be sensible the service on this side has been carried on with all the economy and good husbandry to the public that was possible.\" 29. In spite, however, of this manly defence- \u2014 in spite of irrefragable evidence of the veracity of its statements \u2014 the House of Commons of Harley and Bolingbroke declared him guilty by a majority of 270 against 165. Prior to this dis graceful conclusion, the queen had dismissed him from all his employments ; a step' which the Jacobites exulted in, and whose significance Louis XIV. comprehended. \" The dismission of Marlborough,\" he exclaimed, \" will do all we can desire.\" An order was also obtained for the attorney-general to prosecute the duke ; but Harley and his friends were too cautious to undertake a procedure which could only have exposed their own machi nations. 30. It was while Marlborough laboured under this intolerable weight of odium that Prince Eugene arrived in England, with the view of persuading Queen Anne's cabinet to continue faithful to England's engagements with her allies. By every possible means he marked the esteem and admiration he felt for his illus trious partner in arms. At a dinner given by Harley, the lord n H"], [494, "466 BATTLE OF MALPLAQUET. treasurer, when the host observed, \" I consider this day as the happiest of mv life, since I have the honour to see in my house the greatest captain of the age,\" the prince pointedly replied, \" If I am so, I owe it to your lordship,\" alluding to Marl borough's dismissal. To Bishop Burnet, who had indicated a passage in a scurrilous libel which spoke of the great soldier as once fortunate, Eugene rejoined, \"It is the greatest commenda tion which can be given ; for he was always successful, and this must imply, that if in one single instance he was fortunate, all his other successes were owing to his conduct.\" Eugene's repre sentations on behalf of his sovereign, the Emperor of Germany, were, however, coolly disregarded by the ministry, who had determined upon concluding \" peace at any price,\" and were already bent upon deceiving and betraying their confederates. He left England in disgust; and the result of these political combinations was that unsatisfactory Treaty of Utrecht which had excited so much acrimonious controversy. 31. The contumely with which he was treated, the shameful indignities by which he was daily dishonoured, and the death of his true and tried coadjutor, Godolphin, drove Marlborough at length from his ungrateful country. He left Dover on the 28th of November, 1712. His continental progress was that of a monarch or a conqueror. Bells rang out a welcome, and cannon thundered a salute in every great town which he visited, and the populace everywhere hailed him as the saviour of Europe. \" In a word, ' says Lediard, his earliest biographer, \" all ages and sexes both adored and bewailed him ; whilst the duke himself showed that the greatness of his sufferings was only to be surmounted by the greatness of his courage, and went through the town of Aix la-Chapelle, to the house that was prepared for his reception, in such a manner, as he bore at heart the pressure of other people's misfortunes, not the remembrances of his own. The next day his levee was crowded by all persons of rank and distinction in the town, who, though of different interests and nations, were unanimous in their respect for his great merits. In particular, the Duke de Lesdiguieres, speaking of him at his return, observed to the Abbot de Guilestre, ' I can now say that I have seen the man who is equal to the Marshal de Turenne in conduct, to the Prince de Conde in courage, and superior to the Marshal de Luxembourg in success.' \""], [495, "467 RESTORED TO HIS HONOURS. 32. During his residence on the Continent the duke main tained a constant correspondence with the Elector of Hanover, and exerted the influence he still possessed over his party in England to check the projects of the Jacobites, and further the interests of the Protestant succession. In the Hanoverian court he was held in the highest esteem, and it was well understood that when the Elector ascended the English throne the illustrious general would be restored to all his honours and dignities. 33. Such, indeed, was the case. On the accession of George I. he was reappointed captain-general and master of the ordnance, and high offices were also bestowed upon his sons-in-law. His last services to his country were in 1715, when he superintended the military preparations for crushing the Jacobite rebellion in Scotland. From that time he retired into private life, busying himself in the erection and decoration of his palace at Blenheim, and holding entirely aloof from political turmoil. \" His habits were perfectly domestic, and did not belie the fond anxiety he had manifested while engaged in busier scenes for the society of his family and friends. His favourite and constant exercise was riding, either in a carriage or on horseback ; and, whenever his health permitted, in walking round his grounds, particularly at Blenheim, where he delighted to contemplate his own creation. His amusements consisted in the company of his friends, whom he was accustomed to receive without ceremony, or in the recreation of cards. He played at ombre, basset, and picquet, sometimes, with his grandchildren, even at commerce ; but his favourite game was whist.\" He was also partial to exhibitions of music and dancing, and to private dramatic performances. Thus calmly and purely the life of the hero of Blenheim glided down to the eternal sea. 34. In May, 1716, he suffered his first attack of the palsy. The disorder, for the remainder of his life returned at intervals, but never affected his intellect or perturbed his temper. In June, 1722, however, it afflicted him with great violence, and soon it became apparent that it yielded to no remedies, but menaced his speedy dissolution. On the evening of the 14th he listened with great reverence to the evening prayers of the Church of England, and when asked by the duchess whether he had heard them, replied distinctly, \" Yes ; and I joined in them.\" Shortly afterwards he was removed to his bed ; medicines were adminis- H H 2"], [496, "468 BATTLE OF MALPLAQUET. tered, and the usual applications attempted, but about four o'clock on the morning of the 15th of June, 1722, his spirit passed away, and John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough, closed his active career in the 72nd year of his age. \" I take, ivith pleasure, this opportunity of doing justice to that great man, whose faults I knew, and whose virtues I admired ; and whose memory, as the greatest general and as the greatest minister that our country or any other has produced, I honour.\" * * Lord Bolingbroke, Letters on the Study of History."], [497, "CHRONOLOGICAL LINKS BETWEEN THE BATTLE OF MALPLAQUET AND THE BATTLE OF THE BORODINO.

[Authorities. \u2014 In the following sketch we have mainly followed, and in some places translated, the vigorous narrative by General Comte de Segur (His toire de Napoleon et de la Grande Armee pendant Vannee, 1812). The student should also consult Alison's History of the French Revolution ; Scotfs Life of Napoleon ; Memoires de St. Helene; Pictorial History of England ; and the various works treating of Napoleon's campaign in 1812 and 1813, which it would be impossible here to enumerate.] \" Again they reached thee, Borodino ! still Upon the loaded soil the carnage lay, The human harvest, now stark, stiff, and chill, Friend, foe, stretched stiff together, clay to clay ; In vain the startled legions burst away ; The land was all one naked sepulchre ; The shrinking eye still glanced on grim decay, Still did the hoof and wheel their passage tear Through cloven helms and arms, and corpses mouldering drear.\" Dr. Croly. 1. In 1810 the power and reputation of Napoleon were at their highest, and his marriage with the Archduchess Maria Louisa appeared to have securely connected his family with the ancient dynasties of \" legitimate\" Europe. Russia, Prussia, Holland, the northern kingdoms, Italy \u2014 all lay hushed and humbled at his feet, and only the obstinate heroism of England and the desperate daring of Spain withstood the progress of the mighty conqueror. But not the less were the causes silently at work which menaced his entire and speedy destruc tion ; and the nations, revolted at his tyranny, at his flagrant indifference to human and divine laws, only waited for an oppor tune hour to fling aside the shackles which humiliated them. It was afforded them by the invasion of Russia, and the destruc-"], [501, "CAUSES OF NAPOLEON'S FALL. 473 tion of the noble army which he had led into its frozen wilder nesses. The spell of his invincibility was broken, and Europe seemed at once to recover heart. Nation after nation \u2014 for in this great struggle nations and sovereigns were of one mind \u2014 rose up in the rear of the baffled invader, as without battalions or standards he hastened on his way to Paris, leaving behind him the wrecks of his broken power and vanquished ambition. Nation after nation sprang to its feet, grasped the sword with eager hands, and made ready to avenge upon Imperial France the terrible slaughter of its sons. Austria, despite the marriage of Maria Louisa, remembered Austerlitz and the tricolour in Vienna \u2014 remembered Marengo, and the spoliation of the Iron Crown. Prussia was mindful of her outraged queen, and the bloody field of Jena. Russia, rejoicing in her recent triumph, swore to be revenged for Borodino and Moscow ; and England, who single-handed had fought the battle of Europe, girded up her loins afresh as she saw the glittering squadrons of her new allies muster in formidable array. Hence the three days of Leipzig, the invasion of France, Fontainbleau, and Elba. 2. The fall of Napoleon dates from his ill-considered expedi tion into Russia. The fearful catastrophe in which that expedition resulted first made resistance possible. Wellington's genius had shown how a country might successfully defend itself against the most brilliant hosts and the ablest marshals of Imperial France, but it had not as yet assumed the offensive. The glory of Napoleon's hundred victories still surrounded his throne, and dazzled the nations into a blind submission. They believed in his invincibility, until the delusion vanished among the deadly snows of Russia. When he crossed the Niemen a fugitive, he ceased to be the wonder and mystery of Europe ; he became, in the eyes of the peoples, a man to be conquered. But the student of history will not fail to have noticed that something of this reaction was visible even before the Russian invasion. In the emperor's later career there were no Marengos, Austerlitzes, or Jenas. Wagram, Friedland, Asperne, were won only at a heavy cost, and produced no such decisive results as the great victories of his earlier days. It is true that Napoleon in the purple was not the Napoleon of Arcola, Lodi, or Rivoli ; his genius had lost its swift decision and electric vigour ; but not to this cause alone can we justly attribute the signal difference"], [502, "474 BATTLE OF THE BORODINO. between a victory like that of Austerlitz, which humbled an empire, and that of Borodino, which decided nothing. The temper of Napoleon's antagonists had also changed. 3. For the reasons we have thus slightly indicated the battle of the Borodino has always appeared to us deserving of attentive consideration. It was the last great battle which Napoleon won, for when again he marshalled his thousands and tens of thou sands \u2014 as at Leipzig and Waterloo \u2014 his standards were no longer crowned with victory. It was the last gleam of hope that cheered the warriors of the ill-starred \" Grand Army of Russia,\" whose bones were left to whiten on the desolate and ice-bound steppes \u2014 mute but eloquent witnesses against the mad ambition and criminal egotism of the man who owed his glory to their valour. 4. Over the advance of the grand army, by way of Wilna and Smolensk, upon Moscow, the holy city and ancient capital of the Russian empire, we will not linger. Every step demon strated more clearly to Napoleon the immense difficulties of the enterprise he had undertaken. Every step bore him and his diminishing hosts farther from his communications and resources. Every step seemed to render the submission of Russia more problematical ; and as for the Russian army it would not wait to be beaten ; it retired as he advanced, but slowly and in perfect order, and devastating the country all around it. We raise the curtain upon the plains of the Borodino, where, at last, it appeared evident that Kutusof had determined to try the fortune of a pitched battle in defence of Moscow. 5. Yes, the Russian army had halted, and Napoleon could announce to his wearied soldiers the prospect of a battle and the promise of a victory. He gave them two days for repose, for preparing their arms, and collecting provisions ; contenting himself with warning the foraging parties that if they had not returned by the day after the morrow they would lose the honour of sharing in the fight. Then he made inquiries respecting his new antagonist. He learned that he was an aged man, whose reputation had begun with a singular wound, and who had since known how to profit by circumstances. Even the defeat of Austerlitz, which he had foreseen, augmented his renown, and his late campaign against the Turks had largely increased it. His courage was indisputable; but he was accused"], [503, "475 LE BEAU SABREUR. ot regulating his movements by his personal interests, for he acted entirely upon calculation, His genius was slow, revenge ful, and, above all, astute ; a true Tartar character : knowing how to prepare with a sleek, supple, and patient policy a war to the knife. 'For the rest, he was even more adroit as a courtier than skilful as a general, and could flatter an entire nation, from the chief down to the lowest private. In his appearance, his lan guage, even in his attire, as well as in his superstitions and in his years, he was another Suwarrow, a reproduction of the ancient Muscovite, and bore about him an air of nationality which en deared him to the Russians. At Moscow, the rejoicings at his nomination to the command in chief were carried to an excess, and men embraced one another in the streets, and believed the empire saved. 6. On the 4th of September, the French army, in three moveable columns, set out from Gjatz and its environs. The bril liant Murat was some leagues in advance with his cavalry. After the arrival of Kutusof in the Russian army, its clouds of Cossacks had hovered incessantly about the heads of the French columns, and Le Beau Sabreur was irritated at seeing his horsemen con strained to deploy against so weak an enemy. It is said that on this occasion, with an impulse worthy of the old chivalric times, he galloped forward alone towards their ranks, and reining up his steed within a few paces, he, sword in hand, made them a sign to retire, with an air and gesture so imperious that the astonished Cossacks instinctively obeyed the order. Neverthe less, he did not long continue his advance without a check. At Griednewa, between Gjatz and Borodino, the main road suddenly descends into a deep ravine, from which it rises swiftly to reach a vast plateau. Here Kutusof had ordered Konownitzin to make a stand. At first that general maintained himself vigorously enough against the foremost squadrons of Murat ; but the army gradually approaching, each moment strengthened the attacking party and weakened the defensive. Soon, too, the advanced guard, under Prince Eugene, was engaged with the right wing of the Russians, and delivered a charge of Italian chasseurs, which the Cossacks withstood awhile. Konownitzin, beaten, retreated ; and the French followed in pursuit, on the 5th, as far as the vast convent of Kolotsko'i, which, like a medi\u00e6val monastery, had been transformed from a sacred asylum of peace"], [504, "476 BATTLE OF THE BORODINO. into a defensive stronghold. The Russian general threw out his troops to the right and left, not holding any point either at Kolotskoi or Golowino ; but when the advanced guard of the French debouched from this village, its soldiers saw that the plains and the woods were infested with Cossacks, the crops spoiled, and the country sacked \u2014 a scene of widespread desola tion! By these signs they recognised the battle-field which Kutusof had prepared for the grand army. Behind these clouds of Scythians three villages might be seen, about a mile apart. The intervening spaces, filled with ravines and woods, were occupied by Russian sharpshooters. In an impulse of ardour some French horsemen rode into the midst of these Russians, and nobly perished. 7. Napoleon now appeared upon an eminence, from whence he surveyed the surrounding country with that coup d\u0153il of con querors, that sees everything at once and without confusion, that pierces all obstacles, puts aside mere accessories, distinguishes the principal point, and fixes upon it with an eagle's glance, as upon a prey which he will seize with all his strength. He knew that a league before him, at Borodino, there flowed a torrent which, after rolling a few versts, turned abruptly to the left to mingle its waters wilh those of the Moskwa. He judged that only a chain of lofty hills could thus divert its course, and cause it so suddenly to change its direction. He concluded that these were occupied by the enemy, and that on that side an attack would be hazardous; but that in covering the right and centre of the position, the Kologha would expose the left. The demonstrations made by the enemy proved the correctness of Napoleon's surmises. No preparations were evident for the defence of his right and centre, but before his left he had massed his troops, taken every advan tage of the inequalities of the ground in their disposition, and cast up a formidable redoubt. It was their weakest side, since they covered it with so much care. And more, it was on the flank of the main road and of the grand army that this redoubt was found. All, then, depended upon its capture, if the army was to advance ; and Napoleon gave the necessary orders. 8. Immediately the woods and villages were carried. On the left and centre glitered the army of Italy, the divisions of Compans and Murat ; on the right, Poniatowski. The attack was general, for the army of Italy and the Poles appeared at once on the two"], [505, "477 IN THE REDOUBT. wings of the grand Imperial column. These three masses hurled back upon the Borodino the Russian rear, and all the battle was concentrated on a single point. The curtain thus drawn up, the first Russian redoubt was discovered. It was too much in advance of the left of their position, and defended it without being itself defended. This isolation was owing to the accidents of the ground. The French general Compans skilfully availed himself of its undulations as a platform whence his artillerv might batter the redoubt, and as a shelter for his infantry while forming in columns of attack. He sent forward the 61st regi ment. The assault was made with surprising spirit, and the redoubt carried ; but the Russian general Bagration (second in command) poured in reinforcements who speedily retook it. Three times the French made themselves masters of it, and three times were driven out ; but at length they got a firm grasp, though bleeding and half destroyed. A day or two after wards, when the emperor reviewed this regiment, he asked where was the third battalion. \" It is in the redoubt,\" replied the colonel. 9. Night came on, dark and lurid, and the firing ceased. The emperor disposed his army in suitable positions, and the watch fires were lighted. In front of the Russian army they flamed in a vast semicircle ; while the French bivouacs burned palely, and were irregularly placed, as the different corps came upon the ground late, and in haste, and often without fuel or the means of obtaining any. It was a night of anxiety for Napoleon. When Caulaincourt returned from the captured redoubt, he reported that no prisoner had been taken. \" What, then,\" said the astonished emperor, \" had the cavalry failed in their charge? Had the Russians resolved to conquer or die ?\" He was answered that, excited into fanatics by their chiefs, and accustomed to war with the Turks who slew all their prisoners, they would rather die than surrender. x\\t this reply he fell into a profound medi tation, and concluding that an artillery battle would be the surest in its results, he renewed his orders for expediting the speedy arrival of those parks which had not yet rejoined him. 10. The night wearily passed away, and the morning of the 6th of September dawned upon the two vast rival hosts encamped upon the memorable field of Borodino. The joy of the French was excessive at the prospect of a pitched battle with the enemy"], [506, "478 BATTLE OF THE BORODINO. who had so repeatedly eluded their eager swords ! At last the mysterious, languid, shifting war which had benumbed their exertions, and into which they had plunged without any result, had paused in its progress ! \u2014 they had reached its limit, and a decisive issue would soon be obtained ! The emperor, accustomed to victories which decided the fate of empires, awoke from his lethargy, and took advantage of the early light to advance to the front, and survey, from height to height, the entire position of the enemy. Kutusof had made his arrangements with con siderable skill. On his part a battle was necessary, to revive the spirits of his soldiers, who were depressed by the defensive war so long and so wisely maintained by their leaders. But fully comprehending the superior excellence of the French, who had marched from triumph to triumph under the guidance of their illustrious chief, he prepared to support his soldiers by taking advantage of a position of formidable strength. His army occu pied a ridge of hills, extending over a semicircle of two leagues in length, from the Moskwa as far as the old road to Moscow. Their right rested upon the Kologha, from its confluence with the Moskwa even to Borodino ; their centre, from Gorcka to Semenowska, was the salient point of their line, both wings being considerably thrown back, and the Kologha rendering their right impregnable. Napoleon perceived that his attack must, there fore, be delivered somewhere near the centre. But commencing his inspection from Gorcka \u2014 a village on the main Moscow road, at the angle of a plateau which commands Borodino and the Kologha \u2014 he saw that this salient angle was protected by the Kologha and a deep swampy ravine ; that its lofty crest, which the main road clomb upon leaving Borodino, was strongly entrenched, and formed a detached work on the extreme right of the Russian centre. On its left, and within reach of its fire, a mamelon rose threateningly above the plain \u2014 a formidable work, armed with one-and-twenty guns. The Kologha and its ravines surrounded it on the right and in front ; its left inclined towards and rested upon a broad and extensive plateau, whose foot plunged into a miry defile stretching up from the Kologha. The crest of this plateau, fringed by the Russian army, stooped and recoiled while sweeping towards the left in front of the French army ; then it rose again even to the still smouldering ruins of the ill-fated village of Semenowska. This was the"], [507, "PREPARATIONS FOR THE BATTLE. 479 boundary of the enemy's centre, and the limit of the position occupied by the corps under the intrepid Barclay. It was pro tected by a strong battery, covered by an entrenchment. 11. The left wing of the Russians, under Bagration, con tinued the line from this point. It occupied a less elevated crest, which slanted considerably as it retired towards Utitza, a village on the old Moscow road, marking the extent of the battle-field. Two mamelons armed with redoubts, and placed in line with the fortifications of Semenowska, which flanked them, indicated the array of Bagration. It was developed over an extent of 1,200 paces from Semenowska to the wood of Utitza. The nature of the ground compelled Kutusof to retire that wing, for there began the ravine which scarped the plateau of the centre, but scarcely offered any obstacle to an attack, from the gradual slope of its banks, especially since the capture of the redoubt by the French. Napoleon, therefore, decided on beginning the battle by an assault at this point ; to turn the left flank of the Russians, pass in their rear, and separate the left wing from the centre. A wood of firs offered a covert for the advancing force, and he doubted not but that the fury of the French assault would drive the left wing of the Russians back upon their right, and upon the Kologha, in a confusion which would render their defeat a complete rout. During the night he would cause three batteries, each of sixty guns, to be opposed to the Russian redoubts ; two in front of their left, the third in front of their centre. Early in the day, Poniatowski, and a body of 5,000 men, should advance upon the old Smolensk road, turning the wood which formed the resting-point both of the French right, and the Russian left. He would flank the one, and disturb the other; and as soon as the sound of his guns was heard, imme diately all the artillery should fire upon the Russian left. Thus the Russian redoubts and their ranks would be uncovered, and the corps of Davoust and Ney would then precipitate themselves upon them. They would be sustained by Marshal Junot and his Westphalians, by Murat and his cavalry, and finally by the emperor himself with 20,000 of the Guard. It was against the two redoubts that their first efforts would be directed ; by these they would penetrate the Russian army, already broken and mutilated, and whose right and centre would unexpectedly dis cover themselves unmasked and surrounded. Meanwhile, as"], [508, "480 BATTLE OF THE BORODINO. the Russians showed themselves in great force on their right and centre, threatening the road to Moscow, the single line of operations of the French army \u2014 as, in flinging himself and his main strength upon their left, he was about to put the Kologha between himself and this road, his only means of retreat \u2014 he resolved to reinforce the army of Italy, which occupied it, with two divisions of Davoust's corps, and the cavalry under Grouchy. As for his left flank, he judged that an Italian division, with the Bavarian cavalry and the horsemen of Ornano \u2014 about 10,000 in number \u2014 would suffice to cover it. Such was the plan of battle developed by the genius of the great conqueror. 12. He was still upon the heights of Borodino, and casting a final and rapid glance over the field of the coming battle, when Davoust approached him. The Marshal had just examined the Russian left, and all the more carefully because it was the ground where he himself would act, and because he mistrusted his power of vision. He asked the emperor to place at his disposal his five divisions, 35,000 strong, and to unite with them that of Ponia towski, too weak of itself to turn the enemy. On the morrow, he said, he would put that mass in motion, covering its advance by the obscurity of early dawn, and the shelter of the wood on which the Russian left reposed, and which he would pass in fol lowing up. the old road from Smolensk to Moscow. Then, by a swift and sudden movement, he would deploy 40,000 men upon the flank and in the rear of the enemy's left wing. So, while the emperor occupied the attention of the Russian front with a general attack, he would force his way from redoubt to redoubt, from reserve to reserve, rolling back the whole of the hostile forces, from left to right, upon the great road to Mojaisk, where he would finish the Russian army, the battle, and the war ! The emperor listened to the mar shal with attention ; he meditated silently upon his proposal for several minutes. \" No,\" he replied, \" it is too great a movement ; it would lead me too far away from my mark, and waste too much time.\" The Prince of Eckmuhl persevered in urging the adoption of his plan. He undertook to have accom plished the man\u0153uvre before six o'clock in the morning, and asserted that in an hour afterwards the greater portion of the effects he contemplated would have been produced. But Napo leon warmly interrupted him \u2014 \" You are always,\" he cried,"], [509, "NAPOLEON'S ORDER OF THE DAY. 481 \"for turning the enemy; it is too dangerous a man\u0153uvre!\" The marshal, so rudely repulsed, said no more, but retired to his post, murmuring against a prudence which he considered unseasonable, to which he was not accustomed, and for which he could not account, except that his suspicions respecting his uncertain allies, his weakened army, his hazardous position, and his years, had rendered the once daring hero of the Italian campaigns less enterprising. 13. Napoleon returned to his tent, and reflecting on the gravity of his situation, on the near approximation in strength of the two antagonist armies, on the absolute necessity that his soldiers should enjoy an interval of rest \u2014 rest which could only be obtained in death or victory \u2014 drew up an order of the day, simpler and franker in tone than those with which he had usually excited the enthusiasm of his troops. \"Soldiers!\" it said, \"the battle is at hand for which you so long have thirsted. Henceforth the victory depends upon yourselves : it is necessary for us, it will give us abundance, excellent winter-quarters, and a speedy return to our country ! Behave as you did at Austerlitz, at Friedland, at Vitepsk, and at Smolensk, and the most distant posterity shall remember your conduct on this day \u2014 shall say of you, ' He was in the great battle under the walls of Moscow ! ' \" 14. In the course of the day Napoleon had remarked in the enemy's camp an extraordinary commotion. In effect, the whole Russian army was under arms, and in its ranks ; and Kutusof, attended by a superb concentration of religious and military pomp, passed through the midst. He had caused the priests and archimandrites to clothe themselves in the rich and sump tuous vestments of the Greek Church, and, thus attired, they preceded him, carrying the holy symbols of their religion, and especially the image of the patron saint of Smolensk, which they declared had been miraculously rescued from the profanations of the sacrilegious French. As soon as their religious enthusiasm had been aroused, Kutusof addressed his soldiers in vigorous and inspiriting terms, calling upon them to defend their country from the tyranny of Napoleon, the universal despot, the tyrannical disturber of the world, the arch-rebel wdio overthrew their altars and sullied them with blood. He reminded them of their towns reduced to ashes, and invoked the memory of their wives and I I"], [510, "482 BATTLE OF THE BORODINO. children, concluding by an animated appeal to their piety and loyalty. A spectacle so solemn, the energetic words of their chief, the harangues of their officers, the benedictions of their priests, all conspired to fanaticise their courage. All, even to the meanest privates, believed themselves consecrated by God himself to the service of heaven and the defence of the hallowed soil of their fatherland. On the other hand, the French were inspired by no military or religious spectacle. Even the proclamation of the emperor was not distributed until so late, and read so closely upon the hour of battle, that several corps were engaged without having heard it. Meanwhile, the Russians, whom so many powerful motives ought to have inflamed, again invoked the sword of the Archangel Michael, borrowing their might from all the powers of heaven ; while the French only sought it in themselves, convinced that the true source of strength is in the heart, and that there the celestial army is really to be found. 15. The night passed in anxious inquiet, and Napoleon was sorely afflicted with a severe attack of fever, inducing a return of the disease (dysury) which for several years had troubled him. But when, at five o'clock in the morning, they came to him for his final orders, he recovered his energies, and the mind for awhile triumphed over the body. Rising from his couch he summoned his staff, and hastened from his tent, exclaiming, \" These Russians, we have them at last ! Let us march ! We go to open the gates of Moscow ! \" Thirty minutes later, and he stood within the redoubt captured on the 5th of September. There he awaited the first rays of the morning, and the first shots of Poniatowski's muskets. Day broke : the emperor pointed it out to his officers, exclaiming, \" Behold the sun of Austerlitz ! \" But he was in the wrong. It rose on the side of the Russians, pointed out the French to their marksmen, and dazzled them strangely. The emperor then perceived that, in the darkness, the batteries had been placed out of range of the enemy. It was necessary they should be moved nearer. The Russians permitted the movement to be made without offering an obstruc tion ; they appeared to hesitate to be the first to break the terrible silence. 16. About seven o'clock the battle began on the French left. A regiment of Prince Eugene's division, which had carried the village of Borodino, and the bridge, instead of obeying orders by"], [511, "483 THE BATTLE BEGINS. i destroying it, had, in the heat of their success, passed the river, despite the cries of their general, and assailed the heights of Gorcki, from whence the Russians poured upon them a crashing tire. The brigadier-general fell in the assault, and the whole regiment would have been destroyed, had not the 106th hastened to their support, and enabled the shattered fragments to reform. Meanwhile, Napoleon, judging that Poniatowski was engaged on the Moscow road, gave the signal of attack. Suddenly the silent plain and the voiceless hills seemed alive with a whirlwind of fire and smoke, followed instantaneously by a thousand loud explosions, and the hissing of the bullets, which tore through the air in every direction. Through this tumult Davoust, with the divisions of Compans and Desaix, and thirty guns, swiftly advanced upon the first Russian redoubt. The Russians began their musketry fire ; the French replied with cannon only. Without discharging a musket the French infantry pressed for- ward, eager to meet the fire of their enemy, and silence it. But Compans, who led the column, and many of his bravest soldiers, fell wounded ; the remainder, disconcerted, halted under that hailstorm of shot to reply to it. Then the gallant Rapp hastened to place himself at their head, led them with levelled steel to the charge, and at quick step bore against the hostile redoubt. He was the first to reach it, when in his turn he was stricken down ; it was his twenty-second wound. A third general, who took his post, also fell, so deadly was the Russian fire, and delivered with so steady an aim. Davoust himself was wounded. Rapp was carried to the emperor's presence : \" Ah, you Rapp ! \" cried Napoleon, \" as ever ! But how goes the battle there above ? \" He replied that the Guard would have to be brought up to finish it. \"No,\" answered Napoleon, \" I shall take better care of it ; I do not wish it destroyed ; I shall gain the battle with out it.\" 17. It was now that the \"bravest of the brave,\" the heroic Ney, with his three divisions reduced to 10,000 men, flung himself into the plain, to hasten to the support of Davoust, and advanced with his wonted impetuosity. The 57th regiment of Compans' brigade, seeing him coming up to their succour, rushed against the Russian entrenchments with renewed vigour. It scaled them, mingled with the Russians, and at the point of the bayonet drove them headlong with terrible slaughter. The II 2"], [512, "484 BATTLE OF THE BORODINO. redoubt was taken. With equal eagerness Ney attacks the two other redoubts, and with equal success. 18. It was now noon ; the left of the Russian line having thus been forced, and the plain thrown open, Napoleon ordered Murat to deliver a charge with his cavalry, and complete the repulse ; but hardly were the French sabres upon the height before the Russians reappeared, the second line advancing to the support of the first, and the serried ranks gathering threaten ingly upon Semenowska to retake their redoubts. The French were still in the disorder of victory, and fell back astonished. The Westphalians had been despatched by Napoleon to the relief of Poniatowski. Crossing the wood which separated the Polish prince from the remainder of the army, they discerned, through the dust and smoke, the retreating French, and think ing them a portion of the enemy's forces, poured in their fire. This unfortunate error, in which they persisted, increased the disorder. The Russian cavalry pressed their fortune vigorously. They surrounded Murat, who had neglected to rally his men ; they even stretched out their hands to seize that illustrious Paladin, who only escaped by flinging himself into the redoubt, where his shouts and exhortations reassured the dismayed soldiers. With his sword in one hand he kept off the enemy ; with the other waving his plumed hat, he rallied his men to their duty, and influenced them by the splendour of his own example. At the same time Ney reformed his divisions. Their tire checked the Russian cavalry, and threw their ranks into confusion : they wavered, Murat was released, and the heights retaken. 19. But scarcely was he rescued from one peril before he fell into another. He flung himself upon the enemy with the horse men of Bruyeres and Nansouty, and by obstinate and reiterated charges overthrew the Russian lines, drove them back upon their centre, and in less than an hour completed the entire repulse of their left wing. But the heights of the village of Semenowska, where the left of the Russian centre commenced, were still intact ; the reinforcements which Kutusof drew, with out ceasing, from his right, maintained them. Their dominant fire plunged upon Ney and Murat ; it checked their victory ; it was imperative that this position should be taken. Straightway Manbourg with his cavalry swept their front. Friand, one of Davoust's lieutenants, followed with his infantry. The assault"], [513, "EBB AND FLOW. 485 was nobly made, and the Russians were constrained to abandon Semenowska. The path to a certain victory was thus thrown open, if quickly followed up. But both Ney and Murat were exhausted. They halted to reform their troops, and sent to Napoleon for reinforcements. The emperor was seized with an indecision which he had never before displayed. He meditated long ; and finally, after repeated orders and counter-orders to his Young Guard, he decided that the presence of the forces of Friand and Maubourg upon the heights would suffice, the decisive moment not appearing to him to have arrived. 20. Kutusof profited by this unhoped for respite. He brought up to the support of his exposed left all his reserves, and even the Russian Guard. Bagration reformed his line. His right rested upon the great battery which Prince Eugene had attacked, and his left on the wood which towards Psarewo bounded the field of battle. His fire smote death into the French masses. His attack was violent, simultaneous, impetuous ; infantry, artillery, cavalry, all combined in one mighty effort. Ney and Murat withstood as best they could this menacing storm, and instead of pursuing their victory strove to preserve what they had already gained. Friand's soldiers, drawn up before Semenowska, repelled the first swift shock, but shattered by a storm of balls and grape, they fell into confusion : one of their officers lost heart, and ordered a retreat. At this critical moment, Murat hastened to him, and seizing him by the collar, exclaimed, \" What dost thou ?\" The colonel pointed to the ground covered with dead, and replied, \" Thou must see that we can no longer hold this point.\" \" Ah, well, /remain here!\" cried the king. At these words the officer paused, looked fixedly in the monarch's face, and coldly rejoined, \" It is just ! soldiers, right about face ! let us go forward to death ! \" Happily, the artillery of the reserve at this moment came upon the scene, and somewhat checked the tide of the Russian battle. 21. Napoleon's conduct on this memorable day appears to have excited the astonishment of his most familiar councillors. Throughout its weary length he sat, or walked slowly, in advance and somewhat to the left of the redoubt conquered on the 5th, upon the brink of a ravine, far from the battle which he could scarcely overlook after it had rolled beyond the heights ; without anxiety when he saw it reappear, without impatience against his"], [514, "486 BATTLE OF THE BORODINO. own soldiers or the enemy. He made only some gestures of resignation when, every moment, he was brought acquainted with the loss of his best generals. He rose several times, walked to and fro a few paces, and again reseated himself. Those around him regarded him with astonishment. On all previous occasions, in these great crises, he had shown a tranquil activity ; but here it was a heavy calm, a lethargic mildness. Some fancied that they saw in this the reaction from violent emotions ; others imagined that he already wearied of everything, even of the fierce passion of the fight. Many observed that the calm steadfastness and impassability of great men on these grand occasions dege nerate, when age has exhausted their elasticitj', into phlegm and heaviness. The more zealous of his adherents ascribed this immobility to necessity. When one commands over a vast space one must not change one's position, that the news may never go astray. Finally, there were some who pointed with more justice to his enfeebled health, to his secret suffering, and to the signs and symptoms of a severe illness. 22. Meanwhile the battle waxed apace, and the French, though their guns swept death among the crowded ranks of the Rus sians, gained but little ground. Their enemies fell by hundreds, but hundreds stepped forward with calm resignation to fill the vacant places. It was the victors who first grew weary. The slowness of this artillery duel wore out their patience, and their ammunition becoming exhausted, Ney led them forward against the left flank of the new line which the Russians opposed to them. The movement was successful, and the wrecks of Ney's battalions conquered the remains of Bagration's shattered corps. But if the battle thus ceased upon the plain, it was concentrated fiercely upon the other heights still occupied by the Russians, and struggled around the great redoubt which Barclay, with his centre and right, obstinately defended against Prince Eugene. Thus, towards midday, all the French right wing, under Ney, Davoust, and Murat, after having driven back Bagration and half the Russian line, presented themselves upon the exposed flank of the remainder of the enemy's forces, whose interior, reserves, and line of retreat were now laid open. But into this empty space, behind a line still formidable, the French felt they were too weak to venture. They called with loud cries for the Guard : \" Let the Young Guard only follow in the distance ! let"], [515, "487 THE TIDE TURNS. them only show themselves ! let them but occupy our position ou the heights ! we ourselves will finish the victory ! \" In vain Belliard hastened to the emperor, and pointed out the gravity of the position : that already the Russians were rallying ; that the sharpshooters were lining the wood ; that in a minute more a second battle would have to be fought to complete the first. Napoleon professed to think that the engagement as yet was not far enough advanced for an attack by the Imperial Guard to be hazarded. He knew, indeed, the peril of his situation : that he had no reserves, no reinforcements ; and that a victory hardly won to-day might necessitate a second battle on the morrow. 23. Meanwhile, Barclay, with the Russian right wing, strug gled obstinately against Prince Eugene, who immediately after the capture of Borodino had passed the Kologha in front of the great redoubt. There, above all, the Russians had relied on the strength of their defensive works, their escarpments and bat teries, and the twenty-four heavy guns wdiich crowned these heights, bristling with fire and steel. But both art and nature suddenly failed them ; assaulted with that outburst of fury for which the French are so deservedly famous, all at once they beheld the soldiers of Morand among them, and fled disconcerted. But the success was transient, whether owing to the rashness of the first assailants, or the tardiness of those who followed them. There was a ravine to pass whose depth offered a protection from the Russian fire ; many of the French took advantage of it, and Morand found himself alone in front of the Russian lines. It was then ten o'clock. On the right, Friand had not yet attacked Semenowska ; on the left, the divisions of Girard and Broussier and the Italian Guard were not yet in line. But it was not originally Napoleon's design that this attack should be made so hotly ; its object was to occupy Barclay on that side, the battle having to begin on the right wing, and pivot upon the left. The Russians, recovering from their first alarm, gathered from every quarter, and were led to the charge with admirable steadiness by generals Kontaisof and Kermolof. The 30th (French) regiment found itself face to face with an army, and dared to meet it with the cold steel ; but it was sur rounded, crushed, and rolled back out of the redoubt, where it left a third of its numbers, and its intrepid general pierced with twenty wounds. The Russians, encouraged by their success,"], [516, "488 BATTLE OF THE BORODINO. no longer contented themselves with acting on the defensive ; they rushed to the attack, and then might be seen, concentrated on a single point, all that war possesses of art, strength, and fury. The French hung for four hours on the brink of this volcano, and under this storm of lead and iron ; but for an effort so remarkable were needed all the tenacious ability of Prince Eugene, and that terror of being conquered which is entertained by the veterans of a long career of victory. Each division several times changed its generals. The Viceroy of Italy went from one to the other, mingling prayers and re proaches, and animating them with the remembrance of their ancient successes. He caused Napoleon to be informed of his critical position, but the emperor simply replied he could do nothing to aid him ; that it was for him to conquer, and that he had only to make a greater effort. The prince prepared to direct all his energies to a final assault, but at this moment Caulaincourt placed himself at the head of Montbrun's cuirassiers \u2014 they had lost their general \u2014 took the Russians in flank, and literally swept through them like a destructive tornado. This movement closed the battle. Kutusof slowly and steadily withdrew the remains of his army, and Napoleon was left to add the victory of Borodino to his scroll of triumphs ; but such a victory is only less worse than a defeat. He was implored by Murat and Ney to permit the Imperial Guard by one final charge to complete the success he had so dearly purchased, but fearing to lose that splendid and invincible corps, \u2014 his sole resource in case of a retreat, the nucleus of a new army on his return to France, \u2014 he refused. 24. This terrible battle proved the superiority of the French soldier to the Russian, but it showed that the Russian had learned to hold his ground even in the face of the genius of Napoleon. In its incompleteness, its fruitless slaughter, its losses equal on both sides, its failure to secure any decisive result, it marked the commencement of a new period in the great con queror's career \u2014 it inaugurated an era of disaster, shame, and decay. Had he deigned to read the lesson, or mark the warn ing, written in letters of blood on the lurid heights of Borodino, it is probable that he might have transmitted the imperial crown to his son in peace, nor have witnessed the downfall of his dearest hopes on the fatal field of Waterloo."], [517, "CHRONOLOGICAL LINKS BETWEEN THE BATTLE OF BORODINO AND THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO.

Before commencing our narrative of the Battle of Waterloo it is necessary to premise that after the defeat of the Prussians at Ligny on the 16th of June, they had fallen back \u2014 not broken to pieces and discomfited as Napoleon supposed, but in good order, and still resolute and confident \u2014 upon Wavre, where Blucher rallied nearly 90,000 men and 260 guns. Wellington, with the Anglo-Belgic army, fell back at the same time \u2014 after administering a severe check to the French at Quatre Bras \u2014 that, in accordance with a previous understanding, he might maintain his communications with the Prussians. Napoleon, utterly ignorant of the incomplete character of the victory of Ligny, had despatched Grouchy, with only 34,000 men, in pursuit of Blucher, but had ordered him to move upon Gembloux, in misconception of the Prussian line of retreat. The evening of the 17th found him there, and the Emperor at La Belle Alliance, with thirty miles between them of miry and difficult roads, scoured by the patrols of the Prussian cavalry. Meanwhile, Wellington had promised to fight Napoleon, upon the under standing that Blucher should come to his assistance and attack the French in flank. For this purpose Blucher moved from"], [520, "492 BATTLE OF WATERLOO. Wavre early in the morning of the 18th, disposing his four corps d'armee in two columns ; Bulow to start at daybreak and secure Chapelle St. Lambert ; and Ziethen to move upon Ohain, through Fromont and Genval ; and Pirch to follow Bulow, while Thielemann, leaving a rear-guard at Wavre, marched upon Couture, on the Lasnes. 3. The English general, ignorant of the fact that Grouchy had been detached to pursue the Prussians, expected, on the 18th, to receive the attack of the whole French army, and fear ing Napoleon might attempt to turn his right and reach Ghent by way of Hal, he stationed there Prince Frederick of the Netherlands, with 17,500 men. The main body of his army he disposed on the field of Waterloo, across the great roads from Charleroi and Nivelles which unite at Brussels; his right thrown back behind a ravine near Merbes-Braine, and his left resting upon the chateau of Frichemont, on the high ground above La Haye. He himself passed the night in a house in the village of Waterloo. He rose at two in the morning, and after shaving and dressing with his wonted carefulness, sat down to his desk and occupied himself with his correspondence. This done, he breakfasted, mounted his horse, and rode out to inspect the position of his troops and reconnoitre the movements of the enemy \u2014 a mission on which we may now accompany him. 4. Mr. Hooper, in his recent work, has provided us with an elaborate description of this famous field of battle. He tells us that the British army was posted in front of Mont St. Jean, on a low range of hills running nearly east and w;est. The great road from Charleroi to Brussels broke through the ridge at right angles, and divided the position into two parts. Parallel to the crest of the ridge, and following its windings, ran a country road communicating by Ohain and Genval with Wavre, and known as the WTavre road. The paved road from Nivelles, passing through the western side of the ridge, ran into the main Brussels road at the village of Mont St. Jean, where the two causeways formed an acute angle. The Wavre road corre sponded nearly with the front of the British line, and the road from Nivelles traversed the extreme right, and ran diagonally along the rear. The ridge fell sharply towards the south, so that some writers have compared it to a natural glacis. The"], [521, "493 THE BATTLE FIELD. hill jutted a little southwards on the western side, and then abruptly turned towards the north, the western slope descending into a profound ravine, formerly the bed of the old Nivelles road. On the eastern side of the Charleroi road, the southern face of the range was equally steep, and the line of heights, rising into a knoll a few hundred yards from the main road, edged away towards the north-east, until lost in the broken country about Ohain. The summit of the ridge throughout its whole length was narrow but level, and thence the ground in clined gently towards the north as far as the village of Mont St. Jean and the wood of Soignes, whose mass of leafiness bounded the battle-field in that direction. \" The whole,\" says Mr. Hooper, \" was perfectly open and unenclosed. There were no obstacles to the movements of any arm between the ridge and the forest. The two great chaussees and the Wavre road increased the facilities of movement. About 600 yards in rear of the crest of the ridge stands the farm of Mont St. Jean, abutting on the Brussels road ; a quarter of a mile farther on, the village itself; and about two miles farther, the larger village of Waterloo. On the west of the Nivelles road is the hamlet of Merbes-Braine, and west of that, the village of Braine l'Alleud, with its grotesque and conspicuous church, a prominent object in the landscape. A cross-road, running into and over the Nivelles road, and thence through the fields to the Wavre road, connects these villages with the position. The advantages of this position were \u2014 the slope in front, offering an obstacle to an assailant ; the slope in rear, which concealed the strength and disposition of an army from his view ; and the free and complete means of communication with every part. The sweep of the eastward ridge to the rear rendered that side somewhat difficult of access ; while the slight projection at the opposite extremity, and the falling of the ground to the west, gave it a command over the valley in front and flank.\" 5. On the right, or western side, at the bottom of the slope, stood the chateau, gardens, and orchard of Hougoumont, jutting like a fruitful promontory half a mile into the plain. The orchard was the nearest point to the British lines. A deep ditch formed its northern boundary, and it was further enclosed with tall and leafy hedges. Attached to the chateau was a large pleasure-garden, enclosed by a brick wall about eight feet high,"], [522, "494 BATTLE OF WATERLOO. the eastern side looking into the orchard, and the southern into a wood which flourished to the southward, and extended about 350 yards in length, and 250 yards in breadth. A smaller out work stood in the centre of the position \u2014 the farm of La Haye Sainte, standing on the western side of the high road, at the lower part of the slope, and about 200 yards from the Wavre road. It consisted of a farm-house, court -yard, and barn. The gates here were situated on the east and west, the former open ing on the road, the latter into the fields. Southward from the barn was, and is, a knoll and gravel -pit, now overgrown with vegetation, and a little to the north a hedge and two or three trees. It was across this road and near this point that the British soldiers had constructed an abatis. Here, too, the Brussels road ran between steep banks, formed by cutting a passage through the ridge to diminish the ascent. 6. \" On the extreme left or eastern flank,\" continues Mr. Hooper, \" partly on the slope, and partly in the ravine, were Papelotte, La Haye, Smohain, a cluster of homesteads and peasants' cots, dropped about amidst some trees and hedges, and communicating with the ridge by several lanes running up the face of the slope. The chateau of Frichemont, a large build ing standing in its own grounds, arose upon the face of the opposite hills, but this building and its enclosures were out of the position. If the reader, looking southward, can now imagine a ridge covered with green crops, swelling forward on the right, withdrawn a little in the centre, and bending backward on the extreme left, with the three groups of buildings and enclosures, which we have described, projecting beyond it, cut in half by a broad paved road, and backed to the north by a thick forest, he will have some conception of the British position at Mont St. Jean. 7. \" Opposite to this was a ridge of less marked character, but on the east of higher elevation, running nearly parallel to Mont St. Jean, from the heights about Frichemont, past La Belle Alliance, and at a lower elevation to the southward of the wood of Hougoumont, whence the line of little hills bent towards the north-west, outflanking Hougoumont on that side, and extending over the Nivelles road, here cut through the rise. A lane from Papelotte to La Belle Alliance, and thence to the Nivelles road, marked the front of the French position. Mid-"], [523, "495 THE TWO CHIEFS. way between Wavre road and the cross road from La Belle Alliance to Papelotte, a range of higher ground, forming the French side of the ravine, ran parallel to the British ridge as far as a point opposite to the knoll on the Wavre road, and then sloped away to the farms in the hollow. In rear of the right stood the village of Planchenoit, and three-quarters of a mile from La Belle Alliance, on the high road, stood the large farm of Rosomme. Far away to the eastward were visible the heights of St. Lambert, and the wooded country in the valley of the Laone, and to the westward the woods of Mon Plaisir.\" 8. Such was the battle-ground. The armies that met there to decide the fate of an empire mustered between them nearly 200,000 men, and were led by chiefs, each of whom his admirers professed to think the most famous and skilful of captains. The English leader was cool, circumspect, decisive ; fertile in re source, prompt of conclusion ; but almost painfully anxious to risk nothing, to hazard not a chance, to duly weigh the results of every move. The French hero was daring and brilliant, un surpassed as a master of strategy, with an eagle-eye for an opponent's weaknesses; but often misled by overweening confi dence, and apt to peril much by undue depreciation of his adversary. One was Wellington \u2014 the English general, whose only law was that of duty ; the victor at Assaye and Vimeira, at Talavera, Salamanca, and Vittoria, at Badajoz and Toulouse The other was Napoleon \u2014 whose main passion was ambition \u2014 the hero of Lodi and Arcola, of Marengo and Austerlitz, of Jena and Friedland. Seldom in the history of battles have been matched against each other two more illustrious warriors \u2014 or foes more worthy of a foeman's steel. 9. The relative strength of the two armies that confronted each other on the field of Waterloo is set forth in the following tables, with as much accuracy as possible; but even upon a matter like this, which might seem a mere question of arithmetical computation, the best authorities are widely at variance : \u2014 1.

In four Corps, under Generals Von Ziethen (four brigades of Infantry and two of Cavalry), Von Pirch I. (four brigades of Infantry and three of Cavalry), Von Thielemann (four brigades of Infantry and two of Cavalry), and Count Bulow (four brigades of Infantry and three of Cavalry). Owing to losses at Ligny, Blucher had available for Waterloo about 90,000 men. 10. In round numbers it may be estimated that Napoleon brought into the field of Waterloo 72,000 men and 246 guns, against Wellington's 69,000 men and 156 guns ; and not only was he superior in the two important arms of cavalry and artil lery, but in the quality of his troops. His forces included the choicest soldiers of France \u2014 veterans bronzed by a hundred triumphs ; confident in themselves and their generals ; speaking the same language, and animated by the one common principle of devotion \u2014 enthusiastic devotion to their emperor. But Wel lington's army was a heterogeneous mass, composed of bodies of troops who had nothing in common save the bond of discipline ; one-fourth of whom, as the events of the battle proved, were worthless ; speaking different languages, influenced by national rivalries, and thousands half-trained recruits, who had had no experience in the foughten field. With such an army the English commander would not have been justified in risking an engage ment, but for his reliance on the promised co-operation of Blucher and the Prussians. The key to a right intelligence of the battle of Waterloo is, therefore, simply this : it was Wellington's object to hold his ground until Blucher brought up the Prussians, when the Allied armies might crush the French with an overwhelming force. As it happened, the admirable morale of the English troops enabled their leader to maintain his position for several hours longer than he had supposed needful, and even to inflict a defeat upon Napoleon before the Prussians \u2014 delayed by the difficulty of the roads and other causes \u2014 could come up. When they did arrive, they helped to convert the defeat into a rout, and to annihilate the finest army that even bellicose France had ever produced. 11. Having described the ground where the rival hosts con tended, and furnished the reader with a statement of the numbers of which those hosts were composed, it now becomes necessary to explain in what manner their leaders distributed the com ponent parts of their glittering masses, and how they availed themselves of the offensive and defensive advantages of the battle-field :\u2014"], [527, "499 POSITION OF THE ENGLISH. A. The English Army was stationed along the northern ridge of hills, and in front of Mont St. Jean, from which position the battle often takes its name in the narratives of French his torians. It lined a country road running parallel with the crest of the hill, and communicating with Wavre by Ohain and Genval. Its extreme right was traversed by the Nivelles road, which ran diagonally along its rear. The first line stretched from the heights above the chateau of Goumont or Hougou mont to the hills above Papelotte and La Haye. It was wholly composed of infantry in columns, flanked on the left by two brigades of light cavalry (Vandeleur's and Vivian's). The second line was entirely composed of cavalry, except on the right, where some masses of infantry were stationed, to prevent any attempt to turn it by a shorter movement than vid Hal. This was the strongest point of Wellington's position. It was protected by Hougoumont ; the troops were in a great measure concealed, and it covered the Nivelles road to Brussels. The ground there sloped into a valley, and Merbes-Braine and Braine L'AUeud offered defensive posts of no inconsiderable importance. The chief command on the right was, therefore, entrusted to Lord Hill, the ablest of Wellington's lieutenants At Hougoumont were stationed the light companies of the Guards (Maitland's brigade), occupying the chateau and gardens : the orchard bristled with the bayonets of those of Byng's brigade, under Lord Saltoun, and the wood with those of the Nassauers and two companies of Hanoverian sharpshooters. The walls of the enclosure and of the mansion were pierced with loop-holes for musketry ; a rough scaffolding afforded a species of rampart, so that the soldiers might fire over the walls into the wood and the orchard ; and the hedges had been banked up with earth, and some skilful marksmen posted in the ditch on the north. On the ridge above Hougoumont, commanding the whole of the slope as far as the orchard in front and a beechen avenue on the right, were placed the British Guards under Sir George Cooke, the two brigades being commanded by Byng and Maitland. On their right and rear stood the regiments of Colonel Mitchell's brigade (14th, 51st, and 23rd, numbering from the right), some behind the crest of the hills, others disposed among the brush wood on the slope, and some among the beeches of Hougoumont. Pursuin\" the martial array of the front line, we reach, in suc- K K 2"], [528, "500 BATTLE OF WATERLOO. cession, the British brigade of Sir Colin Halkett (30th, 33rd, 69th, and 73rd regiments), the Hanoverians of Count Kielman segge, and a brigade of the German Legion under Ompteda, (6,970 men, forming the 3rd Division, under Lieut.-General Count Alten). Here we are stopped by the Brussels road, in the rear of the advanced post of La Haye Sainte, which is occupied by a weak battalion of the German Legion, under Major Baring. Crossing the road, we come to Kempt's brigade, the 32nd, 79th, 28th, and the 1st battalion of the 95th Rifles ; the latter being thrown forward in front of the 32nd. An interval, and we reach the brigade under Sir Denis Pack ; while in that interval, but on the exterior slope, and deployed in line, stand Bylandt's brigade of Dutch-Belgians, with a battalion in reserve. Beyond Pack, we notice, on the rising ground above Papelotte, and further in advance, Best's four battalions, one in reserve, and three in line ; on their left glitter the bayonets of Vincke's Hanoverian brigade. Pack, Best, and Vincke are under the orders of the gallant Picton, one of the heroes of the Peninsular war. Their left flank is protected by the sabres of Vandeleur's and Vivian's admirable light horsemen (11th, 12th, and 16th Light Dragoons, 10th and 18th Hussars, and 1st German Hussars), and below the slope, in advance of this position, the villages of Smohain, Papelotte, and La Haye gleam with the colours of part of Perponcher's division, under Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar. Towards Ohain clatter the hoofs of Vivian's patrols, and his videttes are posted beyond Smohain, close upon the French position. The second line consists of cavalry. Beginning our survey at the right, we notice, in the rear of the Guards and Halkett's brigade, the horsemen of Grant (7th and 15th Hussars, and 13th Light Dragoons), and Dornberg (23rd Light Dragoons and 1st German Legion). Attached to these are the Cumberland Hussars, who will so soon disgrace themselves by a precipitate flight. Left of Dornberg, and somewhat in the rear, are posted the 3rd German Hussars, under an old Peninsular hero, Colonel von Arenschildt. On this side (the right) of the Charleroi and Brussels road masses of the British heavy cavalry obey the orders of Lord Edward Somerset \u2014 the stalwart troopers of the House hold Brigade, the Life Guards, Blues, and the 1st Dragoon Guards; on the other side are ranged Sir William Ponsonby's"], [529, "TOSITION OF THE ENGLISH. 501 sabres \u2014 the Union Brigade, the 1st Royal Dragoons of England, the 6th or Inniskillen Dragoons of Ireland, and the 2nd Dra goons, or Scots Greys of Scotland. In the rear of Somerset ride the Dutch-Belgian horsemen of Merle, Tripp, and Ghignv ; westward of the farm of Mont St. Jean, and still further to strengthen the centre \u2014 which already is defended by three brigades of infantry and five of cavalry \u2014 a fine brigade of infantry (27th, 40th, and 4th regiments), under Sir John Lam bert, just arrived from Ghent, halts near the farm, on the eastern side. The reserve is gathered up westward of the Nivelles road, and consists of the 2nd Division under Sir Henry Clinton, com posed of Du Plat's brigade of German Legionaries, Colonel Hugh Halkett's Hanoverian brigade, and Sir Frederick Adam's British brigade (52nd, 71st, the 2nd battalion and two companies of the 3rd battalion of the 95th Rifles). The Germans may be seen in open column of companies in front ; Halkett in front of Merbes- Braine in contiguous close columns of battalions ; and Adam's men in column in the rear of Arenschildt's German Hussars. Left of Halkett stand the soldiers of Brunswick, under Colonel Alferman ; while far away to the westward Chasse's Dutch- Belgian division occupies the village of Braine l'Alleud, and maintains the communication with Prince Frederick's 17,000 men at Hal. The numerous advantages offered by the position which Wel lington took up, and the admirable skill with which he marshalled his troops, have been admitted by most military critics ; but Napoleon, at St. Helena, asserted that the English general com mitted a serious error in fighting a battle with the defile of the Forest of Soignes in his rear. \" But,\" as no incompetent authority remarks, \" the Forest of Soignes is singularly clear from brushwood. Broad tracks or rides intersect it in various directions ; while two great roads \u2014 that from Charleroi and that from Nivelles \u2014 pass, the one directly through, the other round it. All these were practicable for horsemen, most of them for wheel-carriages ; so that retreat, had he been forced to retire upon it, would have been both easy and safe. But retreat would only have carried him nearer to his own supports, while the Prussians from one side, and Prince Frederick's corps from the other, would have hung upon both flanks of the pursuing army,"], [530, "502 BATTLE OF WATERLOO. and destroyed it.\" As the event proved, it w-as Napoleon him self who was really guilty of the error which he ascribed to Wellington, for he fought with the town of Genappe in his rear, and a very perilous defile it was found. B. The French Army was disposed in two lines upon the southern ridge of hills, ils centre resting upon La Belle Alli ance, on the Charleroi and Brussels road, and its right upon the village of Frichemont. In the rear of the right wing stood the church and hamlet of Planchenoit. Napoleon, confident that the Prussians had been too heavily broken at Ligny to offer any effectual obstruction to his attempt upon the English, resolved to put his men in position with all the pomp and circumstance of a grand review. Early in the morning, therefore, he put his magnificent army in motion, bringing them up in eleven columns to the front, where they deployed with matchless precision and splendid effect, while the rattle of the drums aud the blare of the trumpets made a martial music worthy of the actors and the scene. \" La terre,\" as the emperor eloquently said, \" paraissait orgueilleuse de porter tant de braves.\" The spectacle was re garded by the English with calm composure, and not with hesitation or dismay ; while they willingly gave their admiration to the skill which ordered and the noble bearing of the men who composed it. In the front line stood the corps of Count D'Erlon (left), and Count Reille (right), the brigades being arranged in the follow ing order : \u2014 Prince Jerome's, Foy's, and Bacheler's, west of La Belle Alliance ; and Donzelot's, Alix's, Marcognet's, Durutte's, and Jacquinot's, to the eastward. The infantry were posted in two lines, with an interval of seventy-five yards between each : the cavalry of the two corps in three lines on the flanks ; Reille's artillery in front, and D'Erlon 's in the intervals of the brigades. On the extreme left, crossing the Nivelles road, were massed the cavalry of Pire7 whose outposts, towards Braine l'Alleud, con fronted the 15th (English) Hussars; and on the extreme right, the horsemen of Jacquinot, opposed to the videttes of Vivian's light cavalry. In the rear of D'Erlon sparkled the cuirasses of Milhaud's stalwart troopers, aud the light horse of the Guard, with artillery on the flanks and in the centre. Kellerman's sabres were concentrated in the rear of Count Reille, with the heavy cavalry of the Guard, and a suitable number of guns. In the"], [531, "503 BEFORE THE BATTLE. rear of the centre, Lobau's corps was posted in close column of divisions on the west of the Brussels road, one column in front of the other, with the guns on the left flank. And behind all, gathered up in four massive columns of battalions, stood the famous warriors, the battle-bronzed veterans of the Imperial Guard, trained under Napoleon's eye in a score of glorious campaigns. 12. This splendid array was complete by ten o'clock, but Napoleon, not unwilling that the ground, saturated by the rains of the previous night, should harden, and that his troops should obtain an interval of rest, deferred the attack for yet an hour. It afforded him time to devise and mature his plan of operations. Observing the immense strength of the British right, and know ing that even if it were carried Wellington's communication with Blucher would remain unimpaired ; observing, moreover, that the left was protected by the difficult character of the ground, he resolved upon a simultaneous attack of the left and centre, with the view of forcing that part of the position, driv ing the British back upon their own right, and occupying the great road to Brussels. Meanwhile, as a diversion, Hougou mont should be assailed by Reille. During this interval, Wellington had been engaged in a minute survey of his own lines. He rode that day his favourite charger, Copenhagen, a small thorough-bred chestnut horse, and was attended by the diplomatic corps \u2014 representatives of the Allied Powers \u2014 Baron Vincent, Count Pozzo di Borgo, General Alava, Baron Muffling, and Count Francisco de Sales. Having inspected the reserves of ammunition, and the arrangements for the reception of the wounded, he rode into the wood and gar dens of Hougoumont, and satisfied himself that its defences had been properly looked to. While thus engaged, he observed that the Nassau regiment seemed inclined to flinch from its advanced post of honour. The Duke remonstrated with them, and they attempted to excuse themselves by saying that the French were in such force near there. \" It was to no purpose,\" says Wel lington, \" that I pointed to our Guards on the right. It would not do, and so bewildered were they, that they sent a few shots after me as I rode off. ' And with these men,' I said to the Corps Diplomatique, ' and with these men I am to win the battle.' They shrugged their shoulders.\" He continued his"], [532, "504 BATTLE OF WATERLOO. inspection along the whole line \u2014 received by the British troops and German legionaries with a deep rolling cheer \u2014 and finally took up his post on a ridge immediately behind La Haye Sainte. 13. Napoleon, attended by a glittering staff, also surveyed the field of battle, and his course along the array of the French was easily traceable by the enthusiastic cries which, in waves of triumphant sound, swelled from one end of the position to the other. It is said, that observing how few of the English bat talions were visible, he concluded that Wellington had retreated, and that his rearguard only was on the ground. General Foy had served in the Peninsula, and understood Wellington's tactics better. \" Wellington, sire,\" he said, \" never shows his troops ; but if he is yonder, I must warn your Majesty that in close fighting the English infantry is the very devil (en duel c' est le diable).\" Still confident of an approaching triumph, the emperor took up his station on the hill of Rosomme, in the rear of the Imperial Guard, and there, at a table placed upon a mattress, he sat, facing the British lines, with a map unfolded before him. 14. The Attack upon Hougoumont. \u2014 At about a quarter past eleven, Reille, in obedience to the Imperial orders, directed Prince Jerome's division to carry the post of Hougoumont, and the French advanced to the attack with infinite alacrity. They were met, but not checked, by a fire of musketry from the hedges which enclosed the wood ; and covered by the guns of Pire's horse-batteries, directed against the right of the British lines. \" Captain Diggle, a cool old officer of the Peninsula, took out his watch, turned to his subaltern officer, Gawler, who was of the same Peninsula mould, and (on hearing the first cannon-shot) quietly remarked, ' There it goes.' The hands of the watch marked twenty minutes past eleven. The cannonade thus begun soon spread along the entire array, battery after battery taking it up, until a whirlwind of shot seemed to per turb the air ; and the British guns, pouring their fire over the free and open pastures, ploughed up terribly the advancing masses of the French. They wavered, but supports coming up, again dashed forward, scattered before them the Nassauers and Hanoverians, and gained the enclosures. They thought the post was won. Egregious mistake ! Suddenly a wave of"], [533, "THE FIGHT AT HOUGOUMONT. 505 flame rolled along the garden-wall, and a storm of bullets crashed into their midst. At the same moment, Wellington, who had ridden up to the right of the line, ordered Colonel Frazer to open a fire of shells from a howitzer horse-battery upon the struggling French. It was done, and so well done that in ten minutes the wood was cleared. But again they came up, and in such preponderant numbers, that in spite of the efforts of the Guards they recovered the wood, and again pushed up to the garden-wall, and strove to mount it in the face of a crashing fire. In the brief space of half an hour 1.500 men were slain in the small orchard adjoining the chateau.* The French next essayed to force their way into the orchard by a gap in the hedge on their right, but were repulsed by the bayonets of some companies under Lord Saltoun. Meanwhile, another body, pushing forward on their left, drove back the British companies on that side into the farm-yard ; so that now their bayonets swarmed in the lane, the kitchen-garden, and the ravine on the west of the walled enclosures. Throwing themselves upon the hastily barricaded gate, they drove in the timber, and poured into the courtyard. A crushing volley, and the deadly steel soon disposed of the intruders, and the gate was closed by the desperate exertions of five note-worthy warriors \u2014 Colonel Macdonnell, Captain Wyndham, Ensign Gooch, Ensign Hervey, and Sergeant Graham. Over and through the loop holed wall of the courtyard streamed the deadly musketry of its resolute defenders, which was fiercely answered by the French, who swarmed round the curtilage like ravening wolves. \" Shells, too, from their batteries were falling fast into the besieged place, one of which set part of the mansion and some of the outbuildings on fire. Sergeant Graham, who was at this time standing neat- Colonel Macdonnell at the wall, and who had shown the most perfect steadiness and courage, now asked permission of his commanding-officer to retire for a moment. Macdonnell replied, ' By all means, Graham ; but I wonder you should ask leave now.' Graham answered, ' I would not, sir, only my brother is wounded, * In the attack and defence of Hougoumont about 6,000 men of both armies perished. 600 French fell in the assault on the chateau and farm ; 200 English were killed in the wood ; 25 in the garden ; 1,100 in the orchard and meadow ; 400 near the farm-garden ; 2,000 of both parties behind the great orchard. The bodies of 300 English were buried opposite the chateau-gate ; and those of 600 French burned at the same place."], [534, "506 BATTLE OF WATERLOO. and he is in that outbuilding there, which has just caught fire.' Laying down his musket, Graham ran to the blazing spot, lifted up his brother, and laid him in a ditch. Then he was back at his post, and was plying his musket against the French again before his absence was noticed, except by his colonel.\" Upon this noble soldier was conferred the annuity offered by an English clergyman to the \"bravest of the brave.\" 15. Approach of the Prussians. \u2014 While this furious battle was raging around the walls of Hougoumont, without, however, compelling Wellington to draw any reinforcements from his left or centre, Napoleon received intelligence of the appearance of the Prussians on his right flank. He accordingly despatched peremptory instructions to Grouchy, directing him to move upon Planchenoit, and intercept the advancing Prussians ; while he moved up Lobau to cover the right flank of the Imperial army. At the same time, Ney was forming columns of attack, under cover of his battery of four-and-seventy great guns, opposite the British left, and after a protracted cannonade, having received the emperor's signal, commenced at about a quarter past one. 16. The First Grand Attack. \u2014 Napoleon's design was to penetrate the British centre, occupy La Haye Sainte and Mont St. Jean, and overwhelm their left. For this purpose, Ney formed D'Erlon's corps into four columns, in deep narrow masses, showing a front of nearly 200 men, and as depth of from twelve to twenty-four or twenty-seven ranks. \" Half the left column,\" says Mr. Hooper, \" flanked by a body of cuirassiers, was sent against La Haye Sainte, the other half moving up on the French right of the Charleroi road. There was a distance of about 400 paces between the rear of the leading and the head of the following columns, and an interval of some width, but how much is not known. In this order they marched along, drums beating noisily, and the soldiers screaming out their war cry. The two flanking-posts of La Haye Sainte and Papelotte narrowed the front ; and, to execute the movement, Ney had been compelled to throw the right towards the centre. Another cause soon forced the left also to incline inwards, so that the tendency of the columns was towards the centre of the British left wing. As each column passed beyond the line of the grand battery, the guns, which were for a moment covered by their progress, reopened fire, flinging their shot over the heads of the"], [535, "picton's charge. 507 attacking force. The dark, dense, heavy masses moved slowly over the soft ground, and through the heavy crops, receiving, as they passed the battery, the fire of the British guns on the crest. It was a striking spectacle, which those who saw will never forget \u2014 the sort of parade movement of these columns into the valley, covered by the fire of their numerous artillery. The forces they were to fight were hardly to be seen, since the hedges along the Wavre road, and the slope in rear, screened them from view. Only the dark forms of the 90th on the left, and the Belgians in the centre, and the light cavalry on the right, were visible. The heroes of Quatre Bras were unseen.\" 17. The French advanced steadily, though severely smitten by the fire of the 95th, and bringing their masses up the slope, compelled that gallant regiment to retire to the crest, while the Belgians poured over the field in shameful flight. Brave old Picton* had watched the resistless onset, and prepared to meet it. He brought up his two brigades, Kempt's in front, and Pack's in the rear \u2014 3,000 sturdy Britons ; and as Donzelot's soldiers approached the hedges, crashed into their ranks a terrible volley, and followed it up by the bayonet at full charge. With a wild ringing cheer the British met their foe. Picton fell, shot dead by a ball through the left temple. Maddened with rage, his heroes drove furiously upon their astonished enemies, and hurled them down the blood-red slope. In like manner had Pack's brigade smitten back the other brigades ; and while they staggered and reeled in terrible confusion, the sabres of Ponsonby's squadrons gleamed among them avenging and trium phant ! But the hot enthusiasm of victory carried them too far. They had captured 3,000 prisoners and two eagles ;j- but, still unsatisfied, swept away Ney's artillerymen, with such a rush and a dash that they threw their own ranks into disarray. While attempting to re-form, Jacqninot flung his lancers right upon their flank, and Milhaud's two regiments of cuirassiers charged them in front. Much slaughter was done before the wearied British dragoons could regain their position ; but their assailants did not escape with impunity. Vandeleur's brigade, * He had been severely wounded at Quatre Bras, two of his ribs being broken musket-shot, but concealed the injury from the knowledge of all, lest he should be deprived of his share in the glorious day whose coming he foresaw. t Captain Clarke, of the Royals, captured the eagle of the 105th, and Sergeant Ewart, of the Grevs, the eagle'of the 45th, or \" Invincibles.\""], [536, "508 BATTLE OF WATERLOO. and the 12th and 16th Light Dragoons rode hotly into the melee, and drove the Frenchmen back to their own side of the valley, with a loss, in the combined attack of infantry and cavalry, of between 2,000 and 3,000 killed and wounded. \" D'Erlon's corps, it is admitted (we quote from Mr. Hooper), was diminished by one-third, and compelled to withdraw to its original position to re-form. With the exception of the left division, it did little during the rest of the day. Nor was this all : the force of the grand battery was diminished ; for many pieces which had been pushed in advance when the infantry charged, were utterly dis abled by the wild dragoons. On the British side the loss in cavalry was very serious ; the loss in officers great and mournful. Not only did Picton, at the head of Kempt's soldiers, fall dead as he was cheering them on \u2014 Sir William Ponsonby, who had vainly tried to restrain his furious troopers, was stabbed to death by the lancers ; Colonel Fuller, of the King's Dragoon Guards, was killed in the grand battery ; Colonel Hamilton, of the Scots Greys, seems to have shared the impetuosity of his men, for he was lost to view careering towards the French lines ; Shaw, the renowned Life Guardsman, after displaying antique valour, was killed in this fight ; Colonel Frederick Ponsonby, of the 12th Light Dragoons, disabled in both arms, was carried by his horse into the French position ; wounded and left for dead, stabbed by a lancer who perceived a sign of life in the fallen officer; wounded, ridden over, yet not killed \u2014 his life was saved by momentary help from a French officer, and he long survived the battle.\" 18. Attack on La Haye Sainte. \u2014 Meanwhile, a desperate fight seethed and roared around the farm-house of La Haye Sainte. The buildings were set on fire by the shells, and still its gallant defenders \u2014 some 500 Germans, under Major Baring \u2014 opposed themselves to the waves of infantry that rolled ceaselessly upon their shattered defences. No reinforcements could be sent to them, but still they held their ground. Thrice they were attacked by overwhelming masses ; thrice they repulsed them, and with the butt-ends of their muskets when ammunition failed. The French swarmed upon the roofs, and in the courtyard ; and the defenders, reduced to a handful, could hold out no longer. \" No quarter was given,\" says Maxwell ; \" and the remnant of the brave riflemen were bayoneted on the spot. This was, however,"], [537, "ATTACKS OF CAVALRY. 509 the only point where, during this long and sanguinary conflict, Bonaparte succeeded. He became master of a dilapidated dwell ing, its roof destroyed by shells, and its walls perforated by a thousand shot-holes ; and, when obtained, an incessant torrent of grape and shrapnells, from the British artillery on the heights above, rendered its acquisition useless for future operations, and made his persistence in maintaining it a wanton and unnecessary sacrifice of human life.\" 19. Grand Attacks of Cara/ry.-\u2014 Bulow's Prussians were now approaching the battle-field on the east ; Napoleon had exhausted his infantry, and yet the British lines remained unshaken. It was needful to make a decisive movement, and Ney was ordered to launch his splendid cavalry in one grand and overpowering charge. There were twenty -one squadrons of cuirassiers, seven of lancers, and twelve of chasseurs \u2014 a matchless array of splen didly equipped horsemen, 5,000 strong. With these, and a reserve of equal force, Ney hoped to overwhelm the British, whom Wellington had quickly arranged in compact and im movable squares. Some interesting details of the unprecedented warfare that followed are afforded by the graphic narrative of an officer who survived it \u2014 Major Macready, of the 30th, a regiment in Hal kett's brigade. \" When I reached Lloyd's abandoned guns,\" writes the Major, \" I stood near them for about a minute to con template the scene; it was grand beyond description. Hougou mont and its wood sent up a broad flame through the dark masses of smoke that overhung the field ; beneath this cloud the French were indistinctly visible. Here a waving mass of long red feathers could be seen ; there gleams, as from a sheet of steel, showed that the cuirassiers were moving; 400 cannon were belching forth fire and death on every side; the roaring and shouting were in distinguish ably commixed ; together they gave me an idea of a labouring volcano. Bodies of infantry and cavalry were pouring down on us, and it was time to leave con templation ; so I moved towards our columns, which were stand in^ np in squares. Our regiment and the 73rd formed one, and the 33rd and 69th another ; to our right beyond them were the Guards, and on our left the Hanoverians and German legion of our division. As I entered the rear face of our square, I had to step over a body ; and on looking down, recognised Harry"], [538, "510 BATTLE OF WATERLOO Beere, an officer of our grenadiers, who, about au hour before, shook hands with me, laughing, as I left the columns. I was on the usual terms of military intimacy with poor Ham'\u2014 that is to say, if either of us had died a natural death, the other would have pitied him as a good fellow, and smiled at his neighbour as he congratulated him on the step ; but seeing his herculean frame and animated countenance thus suddenly stiff and mo tionless before me (I know not whence the feeling could originate, for I had just seen my dearest friend drop, almost with indifference), the tears started in my eyes, as I sighed out ' Poor Harry !' The tear was not dry on my cheek when poor Harry was no longer thought of. In a few minutes after, the enemy's cavalry galloped up, and crowned the crest of our position. Our guns were abandoned, and they formed between the two brigades, about a hundred paces in our front. Their first charge was magnificent. As soon as they quickened their trot into a gallop, the cuirassiers bent their heads, so that the peaks of their helmets looked like visors ; and they seemed cased in armour from the plume to the saddle. Not a shot was fired till they were within thirty yards, when the word was given, and our men fired away at them. The effect was magical. Through the smoke we could see the helmets falling ; cavaliers starting from their seats with convulsive springs, as theyreceived our balls ; horses plunging and rearing in the agonies of fright and pain ; and crowds of the soldiers dismounted ; part of the squadron in retreat : but the more daring remainder backing their horses to force them on our bayonets. Our fire soon disposed of these gentlemen. The main body re-formed in our front, and rapidly and gallantly repeated their attacks. In fact, from this time (about four o'clock) till near six, we had a constant repetition of these brave but unavailing charges. There was no difficulty in repulsing them ; but our ammunition decreased alarmingly. At length an artillery waggon galloped up, emptied two or three casks of cartridges into the square, and we were all comfortable. \" The best cavalry is contemptible to a steady and well disciplined infantry regiment ; even our men saw this, and began to pity the useless perseverance of their assailants, and, as they advanced, would growl out, ' Here comes these fools again ! ' One of their superior officers tried a ruse de guerre, by advanc ing and dropping his sword, a3 though he surrendered ; some"], [539, "511 THE FRENCH HORSE AND THE BRITISH HORSE. of us were deceived by him, but Halkett ordered the men to fire, and he coolly retired, saluting us. Their devotion was invincible. One officer, whom we had taken prisoner, was asked what force Napoleon might have had in the field, and replied, with a smile of mingled derision and threatening, ' Vous verrez bientdt sa force, messieurs! A private cuirassier was wounded and dragged into the square ; his only cry was 'Tuez done, luez, tuez, tuez moi, soldats ! ' and as one of our men dropped dead close to him, he seized his bayonet, and forced it into his own neck ; but this not despatching him, he raised up his cuirass, and plunging the bayonet into his stomach, kept working it about till he ceased to breathe. \" Though we constantly thrashed our steel-clad opponents, we found more troublesome customers in the round shot and grape, which all this time played on us with terrible effect, and fully avenged the cuirassiers. Often as the volleys created open ings in our square, would the cavalry dash on, but they were uniformly unsuccessful. A regiment on our right seemed sadly disconcerted, and at one moment was in considerable confusion. Halkett rode out to them, and seizing their colour, waved it over his head, and restored them to something like order, though not before his horse was shot under him. At the height of their unsteadiness we got the order to 'right face' to move to their assistance ; some of the men mistook it for ' right about face, ' and faced accordingly, when old Major M'Laine, 73rd, called out, ' No, my boys, it's \" right face ; \" you'll never hear the \" right about\" as long as a French regiment is in front of you!' In a few moments he was mortally wounded. A regiment of Light Dragoons \u2014 by their facings either the 16th or 23rd \u2014 came up to our left and charged the cuirassiers. We cheered each other as they passed us ; they did all they could, but were obliged to retire, after a few minutes at the sabre. A body of Belgian cavalry advanced for the same purpose, but on passing our square they stopped short. Our noble Halkett rode out to them, and offered to charge at their head, but it was of no use. The Prince of Orange came up, and exhorted them to do their duty, but in vain. They hesitated till a few shots whizzed through them, when they turned about and galloped like fury, or rather like fear. As they passed the right face of our square the men, irritated by their rascally conduct, unanimously took"], [540, "512 BATTLE OF WATERLOO. up their pieces, and fired a volley into them, and ' many a good fellow was destroyed so cowardly.' \" The enemy's cavalry were by this time nearly disposed of; and as they had discovered the inutility of their charges, they commenced annoying us by a spirited and well-directed carbine fire. While we were employed in this manner, it was impos sible to see farther than the columns on our right and left ; and I imagine most of the army was similarly situated. All the British and Germans were doing their duty. About six o'clock I perceived some artillery trotting up our hill, which I knew by their caps to belong to the Imperial Guard. I had hardly men tioned this to a brother officer when two guns unlimbered within seventy paces of us, and, by their first discharge of grape, blew seven men into the centre of the square. They immediately reloaded, and kept up a constant and destructive fire. It was noble to see our fellows fill up the gaps after every discharge. I was much distressed at this moment ; having ordered up three of my light bobs, they had hardly taken their station when two of them fell, horribly lacerated. One of them looked up in my face, and uttered a sort of reproachful groan, and I involuntarily exclaimed, ' I couldn't help it.' We would willingly have charged these guns ; but had we deployed, the cavalry that flanked them would have made an example of us. \"The ' vivida vis animi' \u2014 the glow which fires one upon entering into action\u2014 had ceased. It was now to be seen which side had most bottom, and would stand killing longest. The duke visited us frequently at this momentous period \u2014 he was coolness personified. As he crossed the rear force of our square, a shell fell amongst our grenadiers, and he checked his horse to see its effect. Some men were blown to pieces by the explosion, and he merely stirred the rein of his charger, apparently as little concerned at their fate as at his own danger. No leader ever possessed so fully the confidence of his soldiery. Wherever he appeared, a murmur of ' Silence \u2014 stand to your front \u2014 here's the duke !' was heard through the column, and then all was steady as on a parade. His aides-de-camp, Colonels Canning and Gordon, fell near our square, aud the former died within it. As he came near us, late in the evening, Halkett rode out to him, and represented our weak state, begging his Grace to afford us a little support. ' It's impossible, Halkett,' said he. And"], [541, "PROGRESS OF THE BATTLE. 513 our genera] replied, ' If so, sir, you may depend on the brigade to a man.' \" * 20. Ney and his 5,000 fighting men rode gallantly into the storm of fire which leapt from the \" brazen throats \" of the allied batteries, but they dashed in vain against the sturdy squares of the British infantry. Many a saddle was emptied, and still they persevered. Falling into confusion, through their repeated attacks, and disordered by the galling fire which incessantly poured upon them, they lost their power of cohesion, and melted into scattered and irregular groups. The allied horsemen saw the opportunity, and availed themselves of it. They poured through the intervals of the squares, and drove them hurriedly down the blood-red slope. There the French re-formed, and were led again to the charge by Lefebvre Desnouettes. It was a fruit less expenditure of heroic valour. Against the compact though diminished formations of the British, they fell off like living spray from a rock. 21. But Ney was a soldier of sterling metal. He got together the remnants of Milhaud's and Desnouettes' steel-clad horsemen : he joined to them Guyot's grenadiers, the dragoons of the Guard, aud Kellerman's cuirassiers \u2014 in all, 5,000 sabres \u2014 and hurled the avalanche upon the allied line. How gallantly it withstood the shock- \u2014 moving even the admiration of Napoleon himself! Not a square was penetrated, not a colour captured ; and yet the loss of the assailants was most frightful ! They rode straight up to the bayonet-points ; they cut at them with angry swords ; they walked their horses round and round each square, but sought in vain for an opening. Never had they shown a more brilliant valour ; never had they been resisted with more admir able tenacity. Meanwhile, the tide of the bloody battle rolled and surged tumultuously across the entire field, from Hougoumon to La Haye. The battle was not won, but it was not lost. Still the Guards held the shattered Hougoumont, and still the Allies crowned the crest of the northern hills. Napoleon had tried infantry, and failed ; he had tried cavalry, and failed. Of his horsemen he had no longer a reserve, but the Guard remained untouched ; and as Bulow and his Prussians were now rapidly o-athering in force upon his right, he resolved to call it into action. With the Young Guard, under Duhesme, and three * Published in the United Service Magazine, vol. for 1852. L L"], [542, "514 BATTLE OF WATERLOO. battalions of the Imperial Guard, under Moraud, he occupied Planchenoit, after a desperate struggle, and administered a severe check to the Prussians. Not aware that Blucher's whole army was closely following up the advanced corps under Bulow, he now thought himself at liberty to crush Wellington. He determined to throw the Guard upon the British right, while Quiot pressed Lambert with renewed vigour, Donzelot fell upon the Hanoverians and the German legionaries, and Foy, Bacheler, and Guilleminot combined their attacks upon Hougou mont. He himself directed the attack, which Ney was ordered to lead in person. He addressed his officers and soldiers in brief, encouraging phrases. Advancing with them a short dis tance towards the front, he pointed out their enemies with \"a commanding gesture,\" and told them that he desired to sup that night at Brussels. 22. Under cover of a tremendous cannonade, the invincible warriors advanced. \" Ney's horse was shot, and this gallant soldier, whom no peril could deter, led the column on foot, sword in hand. Friant and Michel, and many officers fell, but the column, without losing its formation, went on, and the cries from its ranks, rising above the din of battle, scared some of the Dutch-Belgian columns, who were far out of the reach of immediate danger. Once the leading battalion halted, but at the voice of General Poret de Morvan it cheered and sprang forward. Wellington, who had returned from the centre, directed the commander of the battery on Maitland's right to keep a look-out on his left, and stationed himself in the angle formed by the battery and the Guards. The guns, the duke, and his slender staff, were alone visible. When the Imperialists appeared above the level of the ridge, and upon it, the guns opened a terrific and rapid fire ; and then the duke gave the famous order, ' Up, Guards, and make ready ! ' Maitland's men, four deep, sprang to their feet within fifty yards of the astonished French, and poured in a volley which struck the column like a bolt of iron. Vain was every attempt to deploy this heavy mass ; the file firing of the Guards and the shot of Napier's guns continued to crush it into a shapeless and confused heap, and when the duke cried ' Charge ! ' and the British Guards dashed forward with a cheer, Ney's veterans broke and fled The British pursued for some distance, but an alarm of cavalry"], [543, "THE VICTORY OF THE CENTURY. 515 was raised, and they retired speedily, and resumed their position on the ridge, with the left now somewhat thrown forward.\" 23. A similar ill-fortune had attended the second column, which fell back before the impulse of Adam's brigade, some brilliant cavalry charges, and a splendid attack of the 52nd, led by Sir John Colborne (Lord Seaton). This noble regiment, supported on the right by the 71st, and on the left by the 95th, charged the Imperial Guardsmen in the flank, rolled them up into a disorderly mass, followed vehemently in the track of the fugitives, and swept from right to left along the front of the British centre \u2014 halting just in advance of La Haye Sainte, or 800 yards from the point where it had commenced its brilliant charge. 24. The battle had now declared in favour of the British, after nine hours of steady and persistent fighting. The moment was come to snatch a glorious victory, and Wellington availed himself of it. On a ridge near the Guards, \" his figure standing out amidst the smoke against the bright north-western sky, he was seen to raise his hat with a noble gesture, the signal for the wasted line of heroes to sweep like a dark wave from their coveted position, and roll out their lines and columns over the plain. With a pealing cheer, the whole line advanced just as the sun was sinking ; and the duke, sternly glad, but self-possessed, rode off into the thick of the fight, attended by only one officer, almost the last of the splendid squadron which careered around him in the morning.\" He was solicited not to expose sojprecious a life. \" Never mind,\" he replied, \" let them fire away. The battle is won, and my life is of no consequence now.\" Yes : the battle was won, and the victory obtained was the most decisive which Europe had seen for a century. The Prussians were fiercely assailing Napoleon's disordered masses on the flank ; the British, gravely exultant, swooping down upon them as they fled. The slaughter was terrible, the rout complete. It was with difficulty that Napoleon himself escaped. Lobau and Cambronne were captured ; Ney and D'Erlon fought their way through the throng. For the rest, they were driven by the Prussians, to whom the exhausted British gladly gave up the pursuit, in head long confusion across the Sambre. Baggage, artillery, ammuni tion, waggons, all fell into the hands of the conquerors. The Anglo-Allied army captured 122 guns, 267 ammunition waggons. L L AA"], [544, "516 BATTLE OF WATERLOO. and 20 spare carriages, 2 eagles, and 5,000 prisoners.* In killed and wounded the French lost upwards of 25,000 ; and of the survivors it can only be said that they formed a struggling, shrieking, and terrified mob. 25. Such was the battle of Waterloo ; the last of Napoleon's battles and Wellington's victories ; closing with suitable but lurid grandeur the great war of the empire, which in its sanguinary course had involved every European nation, and especially had roused into steady and persistent action the energies and re sources of the United Kingdom. Since that magnificent but terrible scene, the great drama of European history has been less a drama of warriors and conquerors, and more a drama of happy and progressive peoples, in which the actors have been animated by nobler impulses, and the stage has been freer from the pomp and circumstance of war. But surveying from the beginning those scenes which we have here endeavoured, with conscientious if feeble effort, to put before the reader in their relative importance, who does not see how rapid and how sure the progress of the liberties of nations, how vast the growth of true and noble feelings, how widely developed the tendencies of a practical and comprehensive religion ? How singular the con trast between the Europe of Charlemagne and the Europe of Napoleon, yet how close the links between every scene! How the one has worked into, and developed, the other ; how all have silently contributed to promote the happiness of the millions by extending to every class the advantages of civil and religious freedom ! So, carrying our gaze into the distant future, may we not take heart of hope from the scenes that have passed into a misty and uncertain yore, and believe with the poet \u2014 \" Thro' the ages one increasing purpose runs, And the thoughts of men are widen'd with the process of the suns.\" \" Not in vain the distance beacons.
