The gifts of Nature are showered impartially on poor and rich alike; and Poesy \u2014 which is essentially the gift of Nature \u2014 has stirred with equal force sympathetic hearts in all ranks of life. The well-to-do have the greater advantage in being able to invite attention to their poetic thoughts ; but, in spite of all obstacles untutored singers of the lower classes have made themselves known, though too many have been perforce content to remain the \" mute inglorious Miltons\" of their own immediate circles, through lack of opportunity to be heard elsewhere. That the working classes have produced poets to whom the world has listened, the long roll of names in the literary history of Britain, beginning with Burns and Critchley Prince, bears eloquent testimony. Yorkshire has not been silent in the sweet poetic chorus. It has, and has had, sons and daughters whose tongues have been inspired with the fervour of rich imaginations and a strong desire to uphold the cause of truth and justice. In this little book another Yorkshireman, a true son of the soil, places before his fellows, for praise or condemnation, the outpourings of his poetic mind. Like most poets, to whom the advantages of a good education have been denied, Michael Rathmell writes directly from the heart. Without academic polish, his lines have the true ring of manly thought ; and if at times the diction is not so euphonious as it might be, or his Pegasus slightly limps when it should amble gracefully along, at least the sentiments are pure and the language is forcible and appropriate."], [12, "PREFACE. VIII Michael Rathmell was born at Huby, in the parish of Harewood, in the year 1828. In that pre-education age there was no school of any kind in the village. With a mind singularly attracted by the beauties of Nature \u2014 and Nature is beautiful in Wharfedale \u2014 young Rathmell, as he grew up, soon felt an instinctive longing for the knowledge that books alone can teach. But the acquisition of these was difficult for a poor country lad. Almost unaided he therefore toiled up the steeps of knowledge, picking up, by diligent reading of the books which came in his way, smatterings of many subjects. It was perhaps the want of systematic teaching that prevented Mr. Rathmell's Muse from being earlier developed. The stray books he picked up in that out-of-the-way village, were certainly not calculated to inspire a budding poet with sentimental fervour. It was not until a volume of the poems of Burns' came into his hands that he realised how intense was his sympathy with the rhythmical form of expression. He was not long before he attempted to clothe his own thoughts in rhyme. Poor, those early attempts might be, for they were the first struggles of an uneducated mind filled with the burden of new ideas. The influence of his then surroundings may be seen in the many pastoral descriptions in his poems. A love of Nature seems ineradicable in those born in its lap, and such a love survives even years of residence in the dingy brick wilder nesses of our manufacturing towns. Up to the age of twenty-one Mr. Rathmell followed the plough. He then came to Leeds, where he has since resided, doing his duty in a comparatively humble sphere of life, until laid aside, by a severe illness, a couple of years ago. During those long years of residence in Leeds, whilst writing _.poetry for his own amusement, he rarely sent his verses anywhere for publication. He was content with the pleasure that literary exercises always create in intellectual minds. His portion in the world seemed to him to be to walk in that position of life to which he had been called. In his sphere he did good work in connection"], [13, "PREFACE. IX with three great friendly societies, of which he is a member. There can be no doubt that the educative influence of the work done in those societies has been of the greatest value to Mr. Rathmell, as it always is, to those who use their opportunities rightly. Contact with men, discussions on principles, cause attrition of thought, and widen the sympathies, as well as bring an increase of knowledge. The riper thought displayed in the later poems, is the result, not of scholastic education, but of the education brought by experience. Mr. Rathmell had not so hid his poetic light under a bushel, however, but that his friends were aware of how clearly and brightly it at times burned. A few of his poems have appeared in magazines, chiefly belonging to the great friendly societies ; and with these to guide them, Mr. Rathmell was urged to prepare a selection from his numerous pieces for publication. Some of these pieces have been written many years, others quite recently ; for from the early days in rural Huby, Mr. Rathmell has always been unable to resist the rhyming influence. This little book is now before the world, and it is the sincere wish of Mr. Rathmell's numerous friends that \"patient merit\" in his case may receive its due reward. T. BALLAN STEAD.

All deem'd the high-born maiden wond'rous fair, Who mark'd the soft blue eyes, and golden hair, Which fell in tresses o'er a neck of snow, Or shaded cheeks like morning's rosy glow.

Knights, too, were there, in military pride Caparison'd, and broad-swords at their side. And one, the noblest of the martial train, Was there, Sir Henry Vere of Rugemain ; Whose manly port and brave majestic form Seem'd made a tower, or lady's heart to storm. The deep indented scar which mark'd his brow, Told he had wounded been, but told not how ; Yet fame reported he by Edward stood, When Cressy's plains ran streams of Frenchmen's blood As he and Emmelina, hand in hand, Tripp'd lightly through the Terpsichorean band, One whisper 'd in his fellow's bended ear, \" Pastime alone, brought not Sir Henry here.\" O love! thy magic power what tongue can tell!

Sir Henry, who upon the battle-field Had often fought, and ever scorn'd to yield, When love his powerful assault thus made, Conceal'd in glances of a lovely maid, Found armour, which had shatter'd many a spear, Would not avail to guard his bosom here. At once he bow'd to love's resistless force, Frail as a reed within the torrent's course ; Nor sought to hide the passion in his breast, But to the maiden all his love confess'd, Who vainly strove a rising blush to hide. While to the gallant youth she thus replied \u2014 \" In childhood doom'd a mother's loss to bear, And guided by a tender father's care, I, still obedient to his wise command, Shall give my heart where he bestows my hand.'' Her father gave consent and fix'd the day; And they would married be the first of May.

His destin'd bride at once the chieftain sought, And told what message had the courier brought. He saw, alarm'd, the maiden's rising breast ; Her tears and pallid hue, her grief confess'd. He said, \" Dear Emmelina, calm thy mind, Though far or near, I shall alike be kind ; When ocean rolls and realms between us lie, My thoughts to thee on lightning's wings will fly.

I'm poor, and therefore are my friends but few, Yet in the day of trial staunch and true: Nor bound alone the halcyon sea to sail, But breasting stormy waves, and adverse gale. Sir Henry had a friend, they lov'd from youth; No cause he knew to doubt his cousin's truth. In danger's hour his valour he had seen, In war and peace his sole companion been ; And yet his form, though fair, did but enfold A heart to every noble virtue cold ; A soul of eager selfishness and guile ; A face where envy wore a placid smile ; A smile so seeming fair, Sir Henry deem'd His cousin was the generous friend he seem'd.

From the French of M. De Arnault. Poor shrivell'd leaf! Avhere goest thou, Careering wildly o'er the lea ? \" The slave of chance, no path I know, Torn by the storm from parent tree. \" And on I wander day by day, Through forest bare and fading plain, The zephyrs with me madly play, Nor deem their gambols give me pain. \" I go, where all must go at last ; In fleeting time is no repose : We all must bend before the blast, As bends the laurel and the rose.\""], [156, "NOTES. i.\u2014 THE FLIGHT OF THE FAIRIES. It is an old tradition, still current in the locality, that Almscliffe was a favourite haunt of these interesting and diminutive beings. Old people, still living, tell how their forefathers related stories of their having been seen, dancing on the green on moonlight nights, the males dressed in scarlet, and the ladies in green. In these sceptical days such tales will, I suppose, be put down as superstitious myths. There is one curious fact, however, connected with these Alms cliffe fairies. I well remember three dwarfs, who resided at Rigton, \u2014 Tommy, Sally, and Fanny Bradley. Tommy was, I think, under four feet in height, and the sisters very little over three feet. When I was a boy, I often met Tommy in the lanes, and he would stop me to have a cheerful word ; but I could never overcome a vague feeling of awe whilst I was near him. The sisters kept a school in Rigton, and made straw hats (then much worn in that part of the country) ; and it was reported that one of them, measuring a sturdy farmer for a hat, stood in his coat pocket. My father, who knew their progenitors, said that Bradley senior was above the average height, and the mother a woman of ordinary stature. It was, of course, the popular belief that they were changelings. 2.\u2014 LINES ON KIRKSTALL ABBEY. These lines were written in answer to some verses which appeared in the \" Leeds Intelligencer.\" I give one verse, as it will explain my, perhaps, peculiar manner of addressing the hallowed ruin. \"We, who have light of later days, Know they were weak, though strong ; They raised united voice in praise, In prayers they linger'd long.\" 3.\u2014 ON VISITING HAREWOOD CASTLE. These lines on \" Harewood Castle,\" written in my youth, are not intended to be accepted by the reader as historically correct,"], [157, "NOTES 137 but as a kind of imaginary vision, drawn partly from general history and partly from local tradition. The imperfect descriptions of the Ruin and local scenery, are from observation. 4.\u2014 THE LOVER'S LEAP. This traditionary legend is, I believe, quite authentic. I have heard the name of the young lady who performed it, but I have, unfortunately, forgot it. It is reported that the air gathering under the skirts buoyed her up, so that she reached the ground safely, with the exception of a fractured finger. 5.\u2014 THE FORESTERS' FLAG. As these lines were written for \"The Foresters' Miscellany,\" those readers who are unacquainted with \" the largest Friendly Society in the world,\" numbering nearly 700,000 members, will probably not understand the allusions here made. The Society has branches in almost every civilised country, and these are all affiliated with, and under the jurisdiction of, the English High Court. There are branches (Courts) in America, Australia, Africa, Constantinople, and other places. After the burning of Chicago, a handsome sum was collected by the Foresters in England, for the relief of their suffering brethren in that City. Two Lifeboats have been presented to \"The Lifeboat Institu tion,\" and a collection is made annually for their maintenance. 6.\u2014 THE BARGUEST. The Barguest was supposed to be a supernatural being, seen or heard in the village lanes at night. It was generally described as being in the form of, and about as large as, a donkey, with eyes \"as big as saucers,\" and a chain rattling behind it as it galloped along. In our village it was reported to have been met with at various times and in various places; and children were afraid to go out at night, for fear of encountering the dreadful beast."], [158, "CONTENTS.
