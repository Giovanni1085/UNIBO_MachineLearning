Voyages undertaken for the express purposes of Mari time Discovery have always been received with so much favour by the British public, and especially when made (as in the present instance) by British officers, and under the direction of the British Government, that the writer of the present Narrative of a Voyage Round the World confidently trusts he will not be denied that indulgence which has been uniformly accorded to those who have preceded him. He hopes for such indulgence the rather that, although the practical results of his labours have been necessarily less fertile of novelty, and therefore of popular interest, than those of his more distinguished predecessors, they have not been less arduous or onerous to the individuals engaged in them. In order that the scope and extent of the objects con templated and attained, in this Voyage Round the World, may be judged of, it may be well to precede the narrative by a brief outline of its contents. Her Majesty's ship Sulphur was commissioned in September, 1835, by Captain Beechey, and, accompanied"], [14, "PREFACE. VI by her consort the Starling, Lieut. Commander Kellett, (|uitted England in the following December. Captain Beechey invalided at Valparaiso, and was succeeded by Acting Commander Kellett, who was again superseded by the author of the present narrative, who took the com mand at Panama, in February, 1837, having crossed the Isthmus of Darien for that purpose, and retained it till the conclusion of her protracted voyage. After some little delay in completing certain necessary operations, the two vessels proceeded northerly, touching at Realejo and Libertad in Central America, and reached San Bias in June, 1837, whence she sailed for the Sandwich Islands, which she reached the following month. Port Etches, in King William's Sound, in 60\u00b0 30' N. was the next destination of the Expedition. Point Riou and Port Mulgrave were chosen as base stations for determin ing tbe position of Mount St. Elias,and further settling the question of longitude between Cook and Vancouver. The Sulphur then proceeded to Sitka or New Archangel, in Norfolk Sound, where the officers received very courteous treatment from Captain Koupreanotf, the Russian go vernor. She next visited Friendly Cove, in Nootka Sound, and thence sailed to San Francisco, when the examination of the river Sacramento, one hundred and fifty-six miles from her anchorage, occupied the party in open boats for thirty-one days. Thence the Sulphur succes sively visited Monterey, San Bias, Acapulco, and Libertad, on her way to Realejo, where the author, for the recovery of his health, undertook a land survey of the principal mountains overlooking his future ground in the"], [15, "PREFACE. VII Gulf of Papagayo, and fixed the principal features of the Lake of Managua, to its fall into that of Nicaragua at Tepi tapa. After surveying the Gulf of Papagayo and Port Culebra, the Sulphur quitted Central America, touched at, and fixed Cocos Island, and reached Callao in June, 1838, for the purpose of refit, and the completion of stores and provisions. Having examined the coast between Cerro Azul and Callao, (about sixty miles,) she left Callao in August, calling at Paita and Guayaquil, and returned to Panama in the following October. Here may be said to have ended her first cruize ; but between October and March a survey was made of the Gulfs of Fonseca and Nicoya, Pueblo Nueva, and Baia Honda, after which the ship moved northerly, repeating her cruize of 1837. She was detained at the Columbia River till September ; Bodega, the Russian position near San Francisco, was then surveyed, and subsequently San Francisco, Monterey, Santa Barbara, San Pedro, San Juan, San Diego, San Quentin, San Bartolome, the Gulf of Magdalena, and Cape San Lucas. The Sulphur then proceeded to San Bias and Mazatlan, where orders for a westerly return awaited her. Having shipped sup plies for fourteen months from a transport which had been sent to meet her, she commenced her homeward voyage in January, 1840 ; en route the author landed on the islands of Socorro and Clarion, and secured their posi tions. She reached the Marquesas the same month, and after a short visit to Port Anna Maria, Nuhuhiva, moved on to Bow Island, where the operation was performed of boring for the volcanic foundation on which these coral"], [16, "VIII TREFACE. islands are suspected to stand. She then visited Tahiti, Huaheine, Raratonga, Vavao, (Tonga group,) Nukulau, (Feejees,) Tanna, (New Hebrides,) Port Carteret, (New Ireland,) Britannia Island, New Guinea, coasting that island to Arimoa and as far as Jobie, where she remained to rate and survey ; then to Amsterdam, Pigeon Island, (Dampier's Straits,) Bouro and Amboina, moving thence to Macassar, Great Solombo, and Pulo Kumpal, off the Borneo coast; and reached Singapore in October of the same year. Orders here awaited her to proceed instantly to China, where she was detained, and took an active part in the operations against the Chinese, till nearly the close of the year 1841, when she sailed for England. After leaving Singapore, and touching at Malacca, Penang, Acheen, Sumatra, Point de Galle, (Ceylon,) Sechelles, ?\u00c6 adagascar, Cape of Good Hope, St. Helena, and As cension, she at last returned to Spithead. The account of the voyage has been carefully drawn up from the author's own memoranda, made when the places and incidents they describe were under his observation, and the illustrations are faithfully given from existing scenes and objects. In conclusion, the author desires to aknowledge his obligation to Mr. Hinds, the Surgeon to the Expedition, for his valuable and interesting* account of the vegetable regions, which will be found appended to the second volume of the narrative.

The general objects of the expedition which has been placed under your command having been set forth in their Lordships' orders, it becomes my duty to enter somewhat more diffusely into the nature and details of the service which you are to perform. The first point to which your orders advert after quitting England is the Eight Stones. You will probably add one more to the many testimonies which have been already collected of their non-existence, at least in the position assigned to them in the old charts ; but before we venture to expunge them it would be satisfactory to make all the inquiry in your power at Madeira, respecting the traditions on which their existence is asserted. In approaching the coast of Brazil, you will have a good opportunity of verifying or discarding the bank of sound- VOL. I. c"], [26, "HYDROGRAPHIC INSTRUCTIONS. XVIII ings which has been adopted in our charts, from a circum stantial account in the remark-book of the Fly, within a week after her leaving Bahia, and with chronometer on board. For this purpose it will be proper to run down the parallel of 16\u00b0 50 S., (or 16\u00b0 55, so as to allow for the northerly current,) and to carry in a chain of deep sea soundings from about the longitude of 35\u00b0 30 W., till in 37\u00b0 30 W. From thence you may shape an extremely useful course, so as to round Cape St. Thome and Frio at such a distance, if the wind will permit, as will enable you to intersect some very discordant soundings which have been inserted in the chart, from different but apparently good authorities. One well determined line of genuine depths will go far to elucidate all the difficul ties. At Rio de Janeiro, or at Santa Catharina, you will have an important task to perform, and the choice of the two places is of no moment, provided the chronometers enable you to determine their meridian distance with precision. The longitude of the former has been reduced within very narrow limits, by various observers, and a vast number of observations of various kinds, the mean of which gives 43\u00b0 8 W., for the little island of Villegagnon ; but as every change of a standard meridian is attended with great inconvenience to seamen, it may be hoped that a good series of moon-culminating stars may now put the question at rest, so that no further alteration will be requisite at least for nautical purposes. As magnetic phenomena are objects of much scientific interest at present, you should not lose the opportunity of obtaining some careful observations of dip and intensity, at one of the above places, and likewise at one of the high southern positions where it was obtained by Captain P. King. Port Famine would be well adapted to the purpose"], [27, "HYDROGRAPHIC INSTRUCTIONS. XIX if other circumstances should not render that route incon venient, and the more so as it was the standard meridian to which he referred all the longitudes of his survey. From thence there will be nothing to delay your pro gress towards that part of the western coast where Captain Fitzroy's late survey terminated. Unfortunately no account of his concluding operations has yet arrived, but by a comparison of dates it does not appear that there could have been time to examine much of the coast of Chili, to the northward of Valparaiso, or even to complete it down to that port. This question must be decided, because at no great distance to the southward lie the shoals of Topocalmo, where an American ship was wrecked, and which, if they have not been satisfactorily laid down by him, and their connexion with the shore examined, must not be neglected by you. It is, however, probable that at Valparaiso you will be able to obtain such information on that subject, as may help to guide your movements ; but if not, there will be little danger of repeating any part of his work if you commence yours at Coquimbo, leaving the interval to be hereafter effected, when the return of the Beagle, or the arrival of her despatches, shall enable me to define more exactly the point at which the great work assigned to you by their Lordships ought to begin. Of that extensive region which your work is to com prehend, we are at present best acquainted with the southern portion, including- Chili and Peru. Yet of those long and populous coasts, excepting the ports of Guayaquil and Callao, our whole knowledge is derived from two Spanish charts, on the limited scale of one inch to twenty-eight miles ; and it appears from Captain Fitzroy's recent examination of the large island ofChiloe, and of the intricate gulf of Chonos, that those charts c 2"], [28, "HYDROGRAPHIC INSTRUCTIONS. XX are evidently the result of mere running of surveys. The half-knowledge to be obtained by this kind of survey, has always acted as a check on the advance of geographical and nautical information, and is in itself useless ; for the native coaster wants nothing beyond his local expe rience; the regular foreign trade employs a pilot; and the occasional visitor sees that all the details are so unlike the truth, that he does not even attempt to correct ; \u2014 and thus our enterprising carriers in peace, and our active cruizers in war, find themselves equally foiled in their operations along shore. These evils can be remedied only by correct charts, on scales appropriate to the greater or less intricacy of their contents, and showing the true shape and nature of the shore, the positions of the towns, the places for anchoring, the depths on the bank, and the appearance of the land, as it makes in the offing. The present state of science, and the excellence of modern instruments, afford ample means for acquiring this knowledge with comparative facility, and our western American commerce has long been in need of such charts ; but especially now, that the impulse it has received from the revolutions of those rich but only half maritime coun tries, has brought our vessels into contact with every port from Valdivia to the Columbia. In carrying this great survey into effect, their Lord ships have placed the fullest reliance on the unabated zeal and talents which you have heretofore displayed, and they have cautiously and wisely abstained, in your orders, from fettering you in the selection of your ground, or in that division and disposition of your time, which the periodic changes of season, or the occasional neces sities of the vessels, may require. If, therefore, Provi dence permits you to preserve your resources unimpaired, and if the several governments interpose no obstacles, you"], [29, "HYDROGRAPHIC INSTRUCTIONS. XXI will, doubtless, pursue this important work, with all the energy in your power, and with all the perseverance consistent with a due regard to the health of your officers and crews. Where their Lordships have placed such unlimited confidence, it would ill become me to enter too minutely into the lesser pursuits, which are connected with the main object of the coast line ; but there are some de tached islands and dangers to which it is proper to advert, and to which it is necessary to call your attention. In crossing from one division of the survey to the other, you might visit and determine the position of the little islands of St. Felix ; for though they can offer neither resources nor shelter, yet such insulated specks in the ocean are often useful to the mariner in rectifying his longitude. A little further to the westward, the brig Cannon, in 1827, discovered a dangerous reef, of half a mile in length, which she called the London Bank, and placed in 27\u00b0 6 south, and 92\u00b0 16 west, and which it would be useful to verify. If there be any truth in the report that the earthquake of February has considerably shaken the island of Juan Fernandez, it might be useful to stretch over there, and to examine if any material change has really taken place in the anchorage. Some other extraordinary effects of this earthquake are said to have occurred on the coast of Chili, in permanently elevating part of the shore, and in changing the depth of the adjacent sea. These asser tions, if at all true, are probably exaggerated, and you will render a service to geology, by minutely inquiring into the circumstances, and communicating the result without delay. It may be hoped that Captain Fitzroy has sufficiently"], [30, "HYDROGRAPHIC INSTRUCTIONS. XXII examined the Galapagos, and therefore, till that is ascer tained, your time should not be occupied there. Cocos Island is stated by Vancouver to be only foui miles in length, while, according to Collnet, it is not less than four leagues ; and its position being also imper fectly known, it should be visited. The little solitary islet of Malpelo should likewise be definitively placed. The islands of Revilla, Gigado, &c., will naturally be included in your general chart of California. Further off, in 10\u00b0 North, and about 130\u00b0 West, a large group of coral islands is supposed to have been seen. It is not probable that you will have to stand so far out in any of your traverses, but if accident should lead you near them, it will be proper to esta blish their position, and to ascertain their general character- Political circumstances have invested the Columbia river with so much importance, that it will be well to devote some time to its bar and channels of approach, as well as to its inner anchorages and shores. In touching at some of the points of Vancouver's survey, you will perceive, that unless in any cases of gross error, it is not their Lordships' intention that you should do more than rectify the general longitudes in the chart of that officer, as they are probably quite adequate to any interest that is felt at present about that archipe lago of islands. If, however, you have a convenient opportunity, it will be desirable to ascertain whether there is not a broad sea passage through his King George Island, dividing it into two islands. As the terminal point of your whole survey to the northward, the magnificent mountain of St. Elias may be named ; and its exact position and height should therefore be determined. Next in importance to the accuracy of the coast line"], [31, "HYDROGRAPHIC INSTRUCTIONS. XXIII and of the shoals, is the precision and fulness of the soundings, with the quality of the bottom. There can be no doubt that the nature of the substances which are spread over the bottom of the sea does not depend on mere chance, but that they are in some measure con nected with the adjacent shores, and sometimes with those of more distant parts of the coast, from which they have been swept by currents ; and it would be a great benefit to navigation if this relationship could be satisfac torily traced. The transition also from one species of sand to another, and the link by which these beds or patches are connected, are subjects which would be well deserving the reflection and exertions of our scientific mariners. Besides the soundings to be carried along shore, (the breadth of which zone, proceeding from the back of the rollers, will depend on their depth and regu larity,) the outer edge of the bank should also be laid down, as being a most important aid to the navigator, and a sufficient number of depths marked in the inter vening space, to show the general slope of the bank. This outer edge may be assumed at a hundred fathoms, as in general it rapidly sinks from that depth, to one beyond the usual reach of the lead. Massey's machine should not be used in a greater depth than fifty or sixty fathoms. In approaching the several groups of islands, and in the various runs which either vessel may have to make in the course of the survey, at a distance from the land, no opportunity should be missed of throwing down the deep sea lead. The negative language of no bottom soundings on the charts, is next in value to the real depth ; and, unless when pressed in time by some para mount object, it should be the established practice of a surveying vessel, both night and day, though apparently"], [32, "XXIV HYDROGRAPHIC INSTRUCTIONS. remote from any bank, to have a deep cast of the lead every ten or twenty miles, according to the distance from the shore. This might sometimes lead to useful disco veries ; and in order to abridge the labour, as well as to prevent the unwholesome effect of wet sleeves, the sound ing which should be always employed on these occasions. No consistent account of the currents along the western American coast has been yet framed, though in no part of the world would it be of more importance and value. Observations, therefore, to determine the direction and strength of the current, should not be left to be inferred from the mere error of the dead reckoning, when traversing the sea in the offing, nor to the casual set of the boats when employed in-shore, but should be systematically made, for the express purpose of forming a general view of this interesting subject, and which can only be effected by a great accumulation of data. In applying this rule to the extensive ocean which will be more than once traversed by the present expedition, it may be as well to divide the inquiry into distinct ques tions. 1. The actual set and direction of the current in all parts that the vessels may visit. 2. Are the currents permanent, or in what degree are they modified by the daily sea and land breeze, or by the periodic monsoon, or by the issue of the large rivers ? 3. To what distance does the regular current extend from the coast ? and where do the neutral space and counter-current begin? 4. Is the general direction of the permanent current parallel to the shore, or oblique ? 5. To what depth do these currents extend down wards ? The comparative temperature of the atmosphere and"], [33, "HYDROGRAPHIC INSTRUCTIONS. XXV the sea whenever the current runs from the northward or southward, should be continually observed, and marked in the log. A series of such observations would show under what circumstances the thermometer will indicate the of currents. A minute examination of the tides, including all those data by which they may be accurately calculated, their local set, and the extent to which they are influenced by the periodic winds, and by the sea currents, arc so evident a part of your survey that it need not be dwelt on here. When practicable, their extreme height at the springs should be referred to a fixed object on the shore. You will be furnished with a scale by which the force of the wind is to be expressed, and certain abbreviations by which the weather may be correctly described, and these are invariably to be employed in marking the log board and log-books of both vessels. The periods and limits of the trade winds, monsoons, and rains, will no doubt be a constant object of your study It is true that your observations of them must be confined to the place where your vessels are ; but still you will be able to collect a large number of accurate facts ; you may perhaps pick up some authentic information from others; your journals of the Blossom and those of former navigators, will supply many connecting circum stances ; and I feel confident that on your return home you will present to their Lordships the first consistent account of this interesting subject. Hitherto the practi cal seaman knows not where to seek for the periods of change, which are so essential to the due performance of his voyage ; and those who would investigate and gene ralise the laws of these curious phenomena cannot find any distinct statements on which they can rely."], [34, "HYDROGRAPHIC INSTRUCTIONS. XXVI No possible pains should be spared which may throw any light on the hitherto inexplicable form of the curves which unite the degrees of equal magnetic variation, or on the annual motion of those curves to the east or to the west. The diurnal arcs of variation should also occupy your attention in favourable situations ; and it will be very interesting, if, by multiplying observations, you can either confirm or refute the assertion that there is a constant difference between the variation on the east and west sides of an island, independent of that due to the space it occupies. The restrictions under which these delicate observations should be made will readily suggest themselves to you. No subject can be of greater import ance to navigators than the laws which affect their compass, and none should be pursued with more perse verance ; azimuths and amplitudes should be obtained every day, and under every variety of circumstance, as well on shore as on board ; and the latter, whenever practicable, should be made with the ship's head either north or south, or rather on the line of no, deviation, as shown by the table which will have been formed in each vessel, of her local attraction. The local attraction, however, varies in the ratio of the dip ; it should, therefore, be carefully retried, (on every point of the compass,) at both extremes of the survey, as well as near the equator, and a full report of each trial transmitted to this office. Observations for the dip and intensity should be made at different points of the coast, carefully avoiding the neighbourhood of any place which may be likely to in fluence the needle. Nautical descriptions of the places comprised within the limits of the Survey, and clear directions for the"], [35, "HYDROGRAPHIC INSTRUCTIONS. XXVII ports and dangers, adapted to all classes of seamen, will obviously be among the essential parts of the survey ; but there will also be opportunities of collecting auxiliary information which, when digested, may be made extensively useful to those who may have to visit that coast; \u2014 such as places as refuge after any disaster at sea; ports where pilots are requisite; the most advan tageous methods of obtaining water, wood, and other sup plies ; the general resources and productions on which vessels may depend ; the usual effects of the climate in the rainy and in the dry seasons ; and notice should be given of those spots which are peculiarly unhealthy. In short, no facts can be useless in compiling directions hereafter. It has been suggested by some geologists that the coral insect, instead of raising its superstructure directly from the bottom of the sea, works only on the summits of submarine mountains, which have been projected up wards by volcanic action. They account, therefore, for the basin-like form so generally observed in coral islands, by supposing that they insist on the circular lip of extinct volcanic craters. In order, by a satifactory experiment, to bring this question to a direct issue, their Lordships have ordered you to be supplied with a complete set of the boring apparatus used by miners; leaving it to your own judg ment to select any coral island which may be well adapted to the purpose, and which will lead you as little as possible from the line of your survey. They wish you to fix upon a convenient spot of the island where the operation cannot be disturbed by the surf, and there to bore perpendicularly, so as to perforate the whole thickness of the coral, and to enter the tool suffi-"], [36, "HYDROGRAPHIC INSTRUCTIONS. XXVIII ciently deep in the rock on which it is based to furnish specimens for future analysis. You will of course keep a register of the contents of the auger every time it is withdrawn, and if the structure or density of the coral appear to change, it will be desirable to have a series of such specimens also preserved, and tallied with their cor responding depths. Immediately that the bore hole arrives at its greatest depth, provided no water has been allowed to enter, it will be well to contrive some method of sending down a registering thermometer, so as to ascertain the tempera ture of the bottom of the hole. Llitherto it has been made a part of the duty of all the surveying vessels to keep an exact register of the height of the barometer, at its two maxima of nine, and its two minima of three o'clock, as well as that of the thermo meter at the above periods, and at its own day and night maximum and minimum, as well as the continual comparative temperature of the sea and air. This was done with the view of providing authentic data, from all parts of the world, for the use of future labourers in meteorology, whenever some powerful mind should happily rescue that science from its present neglected state. But those hours of entry interfere so much with the employments of such officers as are capable of re gistering those instruments with the precision and deli. cacy which alone can render these data useful, that I do not think these journals should be further required. The daily height of the former, and the extremes of the thermometer, will be sufficient to record, unless from some unforeseen cause you should be long detained in any one port ; a system of these observations might then be ad vantageously undertaken."], [37, "HYDROGRAPHIC INSTRUCTIONS. XXIX There are, however, some occasional observations which cannot fail of being extensively useful in future investi gations. 1. During the approach of the periodic changes of wind and weather ; in which case the hygrometer also should find a place in the journal. 2. The mean temperature of the sea at the equator, and under a vertical sun. These observations should be repeated whenever the ship is in either of those situa tions, as well in the Atlantic as in the Pacific ; they should be made far away from the influence of the land, and at certain constant depths, suppose fifty and ten fathoms, and at the surface, and the latter ought to be again observed at the corresponding hour of the night. 3. A collection of good observations systematically continued, for the purpose of connecting the isothermal lines of the globe, and made as above at certain uniform depths. 4. Some very interesting facts might result from a comparison of the direct heat of the solar rays in high and low latitudes. The two thermometers for this pur pose should be precisely similar in every respect ; the ball of the one should be covered with white kerseymere, and of the other with black kerseymere, and they should be suspended far out of the reach of any reflected heat from the ship, and always at the same elevation above the surface of the water ; the observations should be made out of sight of land, in a variety of latitudes, and at different hours of the day, and every pains taken to render them all strictly similar and comparative. 5. All your meteorologic instruments should early in the voyage be carefully compared throughout a large extent of the scales, and tabulated, for the purpose of"], [38, "HYDROGRAPHIC INSTRUCTIONS. XXX applying the requisite corrections when necessary, and one or more of them should be compared with the standard instruments at the Royal Society or Royal Observatory on your return home. 6. All observations which involve the comparison of minute differences, should be the mean result of at least three readings, and should be as much as possible the province of the same individual observer. 7. In some of those singularly heavy showers which occur in crossing the equator, and also at the changes of the monsoon, an attempt should be made to measure the quantity of rain that falls in a given time. A very rude instrument, if properly placed, will answer this purpose ; merely a wide superficial basin to receive the rain, and to deliver it into a pipe whose diameter, com pared with that of the basin, will show the number of inches, &c, that have fallen, on an exaggerated scale. 8. It is unnecessary to call your attention to the ne cessity of recording every circumstance connected with those highly interesting phenomena \u2014 the Aurora Aus tralis and Borealis ; such as the angular bearing and elevation of the point of corruscation ; the bearing also of the principal luminous arches, &c. &c. 9. It has been asserted that lunar and solar halos are not always exactly circular; and a general order might therefore be given to the officer of the watch to measure their vertical and horizontal diameters whenever they occur. Large collections of natural history cannot be ex pected, nor any connected account of the structure or geological arrangement of the great continent which you are to coast ; nor indeed would minute inquiries on these subjects be at all consistent with the true objects of the survey. But at the islands, and even along the"], [39, "HYDROGRAPHIC INSTRUCTIONS. XXXI coast, to an observant eye, some facts will unavoidably present themselves, which will be well worth recording, and the medical officers of both vessels will no doubt be anxious to contribute their share to the scientific charac ter of the Survey. F. B. 19 th December, 1835. INSTRUCTIONS TO CAPTAIN BEECHEY, SUBSEQUENTLY TO COMMANDER E. BELCHER. By the Commissioners for executing the office of Lord High-Admiral of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, &c. You are hereby required and directed to take the Starling, surveying vessel, under your command, (the lieutenant commanding her being directed to follow your orders,) and the Sulphur and Starling being in all re spects ready, you are to put to sea and to proceed with her to Plymouth Sound, for two chronometers which have been selected for you there, and having determined your chronometric departure from the west end of the breakwater, you are to make the best of your way to the"], [40, "HYDROGRAPHIC INSTRUCTIONS. XXXII supposed place of the Eight Stones, and crossing the parallel of 34\u00b0 45 north, in the longitude of 16\u00b0 west, you are to spread the Starling to the westward, according to the clearness of the weather, so as to make sure of discovering any broken or discoloured water in the interval between the two vessels. You are also to get a few deep casts of the lead, when passing the alleged place of that shoal. You are then to repair to Madeira, to verify the rates of the chronometers by the standard meridian of Funchal, or if that be impractible from the state of the weather, you are to proceed to Teneriffe for this purpose. Every exertion is then to be made to cross over to America with the least possible delay, and to approach it on the parallel of 16\u00b0 55 south, in order to fix the outer limit of the Abrothos Bank. In that latitude you should carry on a series of sea-bottom soundings from 35j\u00b0 west, till you have arrived fairly on the main bank, or in 37\u00b0 30 west, when, crossing the banks to the south wards, with aline of soundings, you are to proceed to Rio de Janeiro. At that place you will not only obtain satisfactory ratio of the chronometers, but by setting up the transit instruments, a few nights 'observations of moon-culminat ing stars, will enable you, it may be hoped, to settle finally its longitude. If, however, the moon should there be unfavourable, the same object may be equally well obtained at Santa Catharina. The coast, between these two places, has been sufficiently surveyed by Le Baron Roussin, but their meridian distance requires confirmation, and your means are fully capable of dispelling all further uncertainty. From Santa Catharina, you are to pass forward towards the passage between the Falkland Islands and 7"], [41, "HYDROGRAPHIC INSTRUCTIONS. XVII the Main, and taking nearly the mid-channel, you are to sound freely between the latitudes of 50\u00b0 and 53\u00b0 S., there being good grounds for believing that the bank which unites that group of islands to the continent, is within the reach of the deep-sea lead. You are then to round Cape Horn, or proceed by the Strait of Magellan, as you may find most eligible, and to make the best of your way to Conception, up to which place it may be supposed that Captain Fitz-Roy has fully completed his survey, although he may possibly have carried it as far as Valparaiso. This point, however, can be easily ascertained at one of those ports, and from wherever it may appear to have been terminated, you will forthwith begin the great work which has been confided to you by us ; or if there should be any doubt about the limits of Captain Fitz-Roy's labours, you may safely commence at Coquimbo, beyond which, in the time consumed by the Beagle, they could scarcely have extended. When Captain Fitz-Roy's missing despatches arrive, that point will be communicated to you ; and if any part of the above interval should not have been examined, and particularly the dangerous banks off Topocalmo, you can easily resume your operations to the southward, so as to include them. As Rio de Janeiro may be considered the standard point to which it is so convenient to refer the meridian distances obtained on the eastern side of America, so there should be a similar point on the coast of Chili. The choice of that station we leave to you, and there you will again establish the transit instrument, and determine the dif ference of longitude from Greenwich. The extent of coasts along the western side of America VOL. I. d"], [42, "HYDROGRAPHIC INSTRUCTIONS. XVIII is so great that the utmost energy will be requisite in conducting the necessary observations, and can be effected in any reasonable time only, by skilfully combining them with the changes of seasons which take place at alternate periods of the year to the north and south of the Equator. On the approach, therefore, of the monsoon to the coast of Peru, you are to make the utmost expedition in removing both vessels to California, where San Francisco offers a healthy and convenient spot for fresh rating the chro nometers. Little is known of this great country except that it is rapidly increasing in population and commerce ; and as it contains but few harbours, its shores steep, and the approaches bold, there will be little motive for detention between San Francisco and the district visited by Captain Vancouver. You will then have an excellent opportunity of verify ing the longitudes of two or three of the above officer's principal points, which differ materially from those which Senor Quadra and the Spaniards have assigned to them, and on which therefore depend the whole form of that coast. From this region you will again pursue the survey to the southward along to jthe shores of Guatemala and Mexico, and so on, alternately changing your ground according to the periodic change of weather, till in a succeeding season you will have met the operations pro ceeding to the northward. With the very dubious know ledge which exists of the periods of the winds, or of the changes of wet and dry weather, which prevail along the great continent, and the still less knowledge of the cha racter of the shores, which will in some places delay, and in others rapidly accelerate your progress, it is impossible"], [43, "HYDROGRAPHIC INSTRUCTIONS. XIX to determine beforehand the extent of survey, either to the north or south, which you should perform in the alternate seasons. This division of your labours must be entrusted to your own zeal and prudence, but founded on the one leading principle, that on those parts of the coast which are uninhabited, where no ports or an chorages can ever invite the activity of commerce, and where bold and straight shores offer no difficulties or dangers to the passing navigator, there no precious time should be wasted, or minute accuracy employed, which would be as uninteresting to the geographer as useless to the seaman. When obliged to stand far out to sea, in order to reach the remote divisions of the survey, you are to make that passage as useful as possible, by the selection of new ground, or by rapidly crossing the curves of mag netic variation, or by searching for some of the many islands or dangers with which different navigators have studded the Pacific ocean, and which in numerous cases will probably be found to originate in three or four erroneous positions having been given to the same spots. On most parts of the coast you will be able to obtain fresh beef, flour, cocoa, and other victuals and refresh ments ; and if you should want a further supply of salt provisions or of stores, you should apply to the senior officer of the squadron on the western side of America, who will be directed to assist you. You are to attend to the instructions and suggestions contained in a paper which has been drawn up under our directions by the hydrographer, and you are to supply a copy thereof to the lieutenant commanding the Starling. You are to leave no opportunity of transmitting to"], [44, "HYDBOGRAPHIC INSTRUCTIONS. XX the hydrographer detailed accounts of the progress of the survey, as well as tracings of any part of the coast which may be completed. On every occasion which may offer, you are to address a brief report of your proceed ings to our Secretary for our information, and at the expiration of three years passed in the execution of the above survey, you are, after communicating with the senior officer, to call at Valparaiso, and by rounding Cape Horn, to repair to Spithead, reporting your ar rival and proceedings. You are to prepare a berth for the botanical collector for plants and seeds for his Majesty's garden at Kew, who is to be borne on the book of the Sulphur for vic tuals only, and who will mess with the warrant officers ; you will furnish him with the means of landing on such parts of the coast of the shores you may visit, to make his collection, when it will not interfere with the survey. Should anything fatal happen to you on this side of America, the officer next in command is hereby required and directed to return with the Sulphur and Starling to Spithead, calling at Rio Janeiro, if already passed that place. If that unfortunate event should happen to you on the western side of America, and during the first year, the officer next in command is to continue until the end of that fair weather season, on the work which may have been commenced, and then to return as above. But should it occur after the vessels have begun their operations in the northern hemisphere, it may be pre sumed that the officer next in command will have ac quired a sufficient acquaintance with your views to pro ceed with the remainder of the survey on his own lo"], [45, "HYDROGRAPHIC INSTRUCTIONS.

On the 25th of September, 1835, her Majesty's ship Sulphur, three hundred and eighty tons, pre viously fitted for a surveying vessel, was commis sioned by Captain Beechey as a sixth rate, with a complement of 109 men. Her Majesty's schooner Starling, one hundred and nine tons, fitted as a tender, was likewise commissioned by Lieutenant H. Kellett, both vessels being intended for carrying on the survey of the Pacific, from Valparaiso to 60\u00b0 30' N. On the 24th December they quitted Plymouth, and touching at Madeira January 7th, 1836, Teneriffe 13th, Rio de Janeiro February 19th, St. Catherine's February 28th, Monte Video April 6th, reached Valparaiso, the first port within the limits of their survey, on June 9th. At this port Captain Beechey, whose health had b 2"], [52, "4 [1836. HISTORY OF for some time been suffering, found that his con stitution was too much shattered to allow of his continuing the command, subject to such changes of climate as it would necessarily entail ; and therefore, having been invalided, he returned to England in her Majesty's ship, North Star. Lieutenant Kellett, of the Starling, was then ap pointed acting commander of the Sulphur, and Lieutenant Dashwood, first of the Sulphur, to the command of the Starling. The vessels then proceeded to Callao August 7th, Paita August 21st, Guayaquil 24th, Gorgona January 11th, 1837, and finally reached Panama on January 29th, where they had been directed to await further instructions from England. On the Lords of the Admiralty receiving notice of the return of Captain Beechey, their Lordships thought fit to entrust me with the command. I was at that time employed in Lancashire, surveying its coasts ; but was merely performing that duty until another steamer could be provided, to enable me to resume my proper command of the Irish Sea survey. On the 10th November, 1836, I received my ap pointment to her Majesty's ship Sulphur, and a passage having been ordered for me in her Majesty's steamer Echo, I proceeded in her to Portsmouth, where I had to complete some magnetic experiments, and thence to Falmouth, where the illness of Lieu tenant Reid, commander of the Echo, caused some little delay. This was perhaps fortunate, as a very"], [53, "1837.] 5 THE EXPEDITION. severe hurricane, which caused much damage to houses, trees, chimneys, &c, occurred the day pre vious to our departure. My detention here was also productive of much satisfaction and benefit, by the access it afforded me to books, and the introduction to scientific friends, particularly to Mr. James Were Fox, a gentleman already well known to the scientific world. On the 30th we quitted Falmouth, having on board despatches to deliver at Lisbon, where we were also to fill up our coal. Here we were detained by the perverseness of our engineer, and by other trivial matters, over which, until the commanders of steam vessels are better informed on scientific subjects^ they will have no control. On the 27th December we quitted Lisbon, blindly steaming at full coal, in spite of every remonstrance, expecting to reach the trade limit before it could be expended. On the last day, at the last four hours' coal, I succeeded in persuading the commander to try one boiler with half fuel, and he then found that the difference was eight knots at full expenditure, and six and a half with half. We did not reach the trade limit, and we were left at the mercy of strong breezes from N.W. to S.W. for nine days, making but trifling progress. On January 1st a calm succeeded, and I caused a current bottle to be put over, which reached Half moon Bay on the island of Antigua on the 16th July"], [54, "[1837. 6 ARRIVAL IN THE TRADES. following; having travelled during this interval, nearly west, 1440 miles, or at the rate of 7*4 per diem. To our chagrin, the westerly breezes revisited us, and unfortunately, instead of standing southerly where smooth water and the trade might be hoped for, we kept attempting to work westerly. On January 2nd we experienced a favourable flaw, by which we were compelled to make southing, and at length secured the steady trade wind. Sunday, 8th. \u2014 Being seven hundred and sixty five miles from Barbadoes, another current bottle was put over. On the evening of the 13th, we shipped the paddle floats, got the steam up, and at daylight on the 14th made the island of Barbadoes. At eight we passed her Majesty's ship Melville, bearing the flag of Vice-Admiral Sir P. Halkett, Bel videra, Captain Strong, and Racehorse, Sir E. Home. Having delivered to the Admiral a letter from the Admiralty respecting my movements, I was di rected to proceed on immediately to Jamaica, and if no ship of war was there, to proceed on in the steamer to Chagres. I was fortunate in finding all the commanders old friends, and from my good messmate, Sir E. Home, received much valuable information, as well as hints to guide me in my future movements at Cha gres, at that period not quite so well known. In the evening we again started for Jamaica, having taken on board Mr. Sturge of the Society of"], [55, "1837.] 7 PORT ROYAL. Friends, a gentleman engaged in the examination into slave affairs. On the morning of the 22nd we reached Port Royal, and just as we were letting the steam off and about to anchor, I was informed that a large ship seen outside was her Majesty's ship Forte, Commodore Pell, bound to Carthagena. I directed the commander to proceed after her immediately, and it being calm, very soon had the pleasure of wait ing on Commodore 0. Pell, who took me under his immediate protection as an old friend of my father's; the steamer was then released for packet duty. I now learned, that as war, or rather a close blockade of the ports of New Granada, had been proclaimed by Commodore Sir J. Peyton, under present circumstances it would have been unsafe to proceed to Panama via Chagres, and therefore re mained quietly the guest of my kind friend, Commo dore, (now Sir 0. Pell). The cause of this rupture is already well known : I shall therefore merely observe that until the terms sent out by Lord Palmerston were fully acceded to, I saw but little chance of reaching my ship, which caused me some uneasiness ; fearing that the acting commander of the Sulphur, on finding that the state of affairs precluded the chance of communication would move away to survey some other port until amicable relations were restored. On the 25th we arrived off Carthagena, where we found her Majesty's ship Madagascar, bearing"], [56, "[1837. 8 CARTHAGENA. the pendant of Commodore Sir J. Peyton, with the rest of the West Indian and North American squadron blockading the port. I was then transferred to the Madagascar, Sir John Peyton very kindly following up the attentions I bad experienced from my friend Commodore Pell, who shortly after quitted us to return to Jamaica. In order to obtain as much information as our position would afford, I volunteered to examine the bay and passage to the Passo Cavallos, and became the guest of Captain Warren of the Serpent, who was ordered to intercept supplies destined for Car thagena by that channel. Whilst employed on this service, one of Captain Warren's crew was unfortunately shot by a person concealed amongst the bushes ; and the same even ing a boat belonging to the Government reached us with orders to return. Having with me the Com modore's barge and crew, I immediately determined, as we were informed that hostilities had ceased, on making a short cut through the Pass, the pilot of fering no opposition. I thus obtained some insight into this channel which I afterwards found was not opened to foreigners. By a small steamer it could easily be passed ; but the width, barely sufficient for the oars of the barge, would render it a rash step in uncovered boats, the trees, which are well cleared for ten yards or more back, affording ample shelter for musketry. On reaching the port, I found the Madagascar"], [57, "1837.] 9 CHAGRES. and other ships moored within. General Lopez, having received from Bogota the fullest powers to treat definitively, had consented to the demands in full ; the greatest obstacle, the production of the money, being overcome, that night five thousand dollars were lodged on board the Madagascar. The Nimrod, just arrived from Chagres, had brought Mr. Russell, the cause of the late rupture ; he had been released by order of the Government. It also brought the lamentable news of the decease of the new consul, Mr. Turner, from a sudden attack of inflammation of the stomach. The Nimrod was then ordered to convey me to Chagres, together with an officer from the Mada gascar, to seal the papers of the late consul, and bring back the widow and daughters of the deceased. Supernumeraries are nuisances in all ships, under any circumstances, and are apt to feel more than they can well express : but I must candidly confess, for myself, that from the moment I put my foot on board the Forte, to that of quitting the Nimrod, the kindness and attention I met with from their several warm-hearted commanders will ever be re membered with pleasure. After a smart passage the Nimrod anchored off Cha gres on February 7th, and Captain Fraser and myself landed, and communicated to the governor (La Bar riere) the very agreeable intelligence that hostilities had terminated. I say agreeable, because, although his bearing bespoke him an ardent character, he had still"], [58, "[1837. 10 BONGOS. the good sense to see that the war must injure his adopted country, (being a Frenchman,) and he was anxious to return to his family, which he had left at his estate in Chiriqui. The cessation of hostilities, however, appeared agreeable to all classes ; although it is an undoubted fact, that but a few weeks before, the people of this part of the State of New Grenada were most viru lent against Great Britain, as being more imme diately connected with, and under the control of, the governor of Panama. Much bravado and boasting had been exhibited, but the pseudo warriors vanished with the calumet of peace. We were very cordially received by La Barriere, who is a person superior to such an insignificant command. Our baggage was landed, and before dark restowed in a bongo* calculated to carry seventy bales, (of one hundred and twenty pounds each,) fitted with arched thatch abaft, and capable of accommo dating six passengers. As previous travellers have not sufficiently dwelt on the details of the conveniences which may be obtained for transit of despatches, passengers, bag gage, cargoes, &c, from Chagres across the isthmus, by land as well as by water, I trust I shall not be deemed tedious by detailing all that may positively be ensured. * A canoe hollowed out from a single tree, generally a species of cedar ; frequently from eighty to ninety feet in length, by eight feet width at the stern."], [59, "1837.] 11 COST OF TRANSIT. Canoes of the tonnage of seventy bales and under, to proceed to Gorgona or Cruces, are to be obtained at the rate of ten to eighty-five dollars ; during the freshes, or rainy season, something higher. A despatch to Panama, express, with the reply, should be seventeen dollars; time, seventy-two hours at longest. A small canoe with two persons and a change (of luggage), may get to Gorgona in sixteen or eighteen hours, and on to Panama in nine hours, if daylight favours ; but this can only be performed by an European ; the common proprio will take his time. The cost is ten or fifteen dollars. The \" rapids,\" or dangers of grounding, are mere bugbears. In large or heavily-laden canoes much delay or stoppage may arise during the dry season ; but even with our heavy cargo, and the present dry period, we were not delayed more than five hours. No danger exists in point of highway or sea rob bery. The people, generally, may be trusted with large sums of money. Part of my baggage was missing for eight or ten days, but without apprehen sion on the part of the residents at Panama, who affirmed \" that it must be safe.\" And so it proved, \u2014 having been delayed by the breaking down of the mules. It was eventually borne on the heads of men : one package weighed one hundred and seventy-six pounds. As our passage was not to commence until dawn, we took up our quarters in a house provided by an Englishman, with the intention of enjoying a pre-"], [60, "[1837. 12 DEPARTURE FROM CHAGRES. liminary nap, the last we expected on this side of Panama. In this, however, we were disappointed, as the whole village assembled nearly beneath our windows, and maintained a constant succession of native songs and dancing, accompanied by very dis cordant music, until dawn, when they dispersed, and we embarked, in all seven persons \u2014 the lieutenant of the Madagascar, the purser, mate, and my steward, of the Sulphur, assistant-surgeon, and lieutenant of the Nimrod, and myself. We quitted the bank, and notwithstanding our ill-founded suspicions, very soon enjoyed a most com fortable nap under our awning, formed by a thatch of palm leaves, covered finally by a painted canvass. Our crew consisted of the padron and five rowers, theirrate of pay on these occasions beingfive reals each, or two shillings and sixpence per diem. Although the cost of this canoe up was eighty-five dollars, the return charge, waiting twenty-four hours, was only ten. Any delay beyond twenty-four hours entails a charge of five reals a day per man. Our journey commenced at rather a slow rate. The men, perhaps, had not lately worked together, or, possibly, were fatigued by their dancing exertions of the previous night. They were inclined, I thought, to exhibit an independence; in fact, they would move only at their own convenience ; and of this we shortly had a specimen. On our arrival at Gatun, about eleven miles from Chagres, we stopped to allow the crew time to dine. Unfortunately their"], [61, "1837.] 13 NIGHT MUSIC. wives resided here, and having already received part of their pay in advance, it was not without much difficulty, and by the exertion of the padron, that we succeeded in getting away at all, and much sulkiness and ill-humour were exhibited by one of the crew during the remainder of our voyage. About three p. m. we moved on, and at sunset came to for the night at a sandy beach, where our crew recommenced their culinary operations. They had provided themselves with rice and ripe cocoa-nuts at Chagres. The cocoa-nut having been grated finely, by one of Nature's provisions on the banks of the river, [the stem of a plant very closely studded with fine spines,] is put into an iron pot, mixed with a small portion of water, and boiled until it becomes milky. It is then strained by ano ther of Dame Nature's utensils, viz. a sieve made of the Gorgonia flabellum, or Venus's fan, and the re mains finally squeezed by hand. This milky fluid is boiled with the rice, and affords, with the addition of sugar and rice, a very palatable mess. I am told it is very delicious, and frequently given to children. We were not without music this night ; the frogs maintained their concert in imitation of our friends at Chagres. One of our party having inquired what caused the noise, and being answered serpo, a term applied to frogs here, thinking it meant a snake, was rather shy of the shore for the rest of the night. At dawn the crew breakfasted, and we then re-"], [62, "[1837. 14 CAPTAIN FOSTER. commenced our journey with more spirit. At this stage the oars were replaced by long poles shod with iron, similar to those used in our Thames punts. A platform consisting of a single plank on each side enabled them to walk about fifteen feet forwards, and with the pole to the shoulder walking aft main tained a rate equal to about two miles per hour against the stream. Up to this point a ship's gig could come with ease, and, in case of necessity, I should think even to Gorgona. Here a canoe might be despatched over night, with fresh hands, in readiness to effect the utmost despatch. The gig probably would get thus far in half the time required by a canoe, and mostly under canvass. Justabove this position, at Palo Matea, poor Captain Foster, of her Majesty's ship Chanticleer, met his me lancholy fate. The spot is not now marked, but a brass tablet rudely engraved, and but an insignificant monument, even for a seaman, still remains in Fort Lorenzo, to show how little is thought of the pet of science, when his services are no longer available. Our progress this second day afforded us little change, save in the appearance of a few more alliga tors and iguanas. Some of the latter were taken by our crew, who displayed some tact in putting them in durance, although cruel \u2014 viz. by breaking the claw joints and passing one claw through the liga ment of its opposite member, \u2014 toggling their hands over their necks, as a seaman would term it. The"], [63, "1837.] 15 GORGONA. eggs of the iguana are much esteemed ; every house displays strings of them hung up to dry ; the children eat them ; after which, having filled them with air, they explode them by a blow of the hand, in mock contention, causing a very sharp report. They are similar to those of the tortoise or turtle, but in size not exceeding that of the pigeon. A second night we passed in our canoe. The work of the following day became more tedious, owing to the dryness of the river, which frequently compelled us to land. On one occasion, our passage was for some time obstructed by a large tree, which had fallen across the stream at its most rapid point. Fortunately, in its fall it had broken away so much of the bank, which the stream, impeded in its former course, had forced a channel through, that we effected our passage by this new cut, after some little dexterity on the part of the boatmen, aided by our exertions. It may readily be imagined, that with eight chronometers in the canoe, and depending on their performance, it was not the difficulties or other dis agreeables of the voyage, which kept me continually in torment. In fact, every time the canoe touched anything more solid than water my senses were excited. About sunset we got sight of Gorgona, and were shortly after housed for the night (excepting, how ever, for astronomical observations) in a habitation provided by the alcalde. Our baggage was landed by eight the following"], [64, "[1837. 16 PANAMA. morning, and it was intended that the party should have moved on immediately for Panama. But want of mules and previous arrangement detained them until noon, when the greater part had moved for ward. My astronomical observations detained me until three, when Lieut. Bevan and myself mounted our steeds, intending to reach Panama that evening. One of the mates was left behind in charge of three chronometers, to await my return for rocket operations, in order to complete the meridian dis tance between the Atlantic and Pacific, or between Chagres and Panama, where the tides have effect. A party from the Sulphur, which had been ordered to meet me here, having been, by the mistake of the guide, taken to Cruces, missed me entirely. Shortly before sunset, having lost our guide, we fell into the wrong road, but eventually met with shelter for the night in a hut where nothing else could be obtained. In the morning, by the assist ance of the peasant, our host, we were enabled to reach the main road, and about two that evening arrived at Panama, when we found that those who had preceded us had also been similarly unfortunate. Our first efforts were directed to free ourselves from the garrapatas, or ticks, which infest the woods of this country, and we then proceeded to pay our respects to the widow and family of the late consul, whom we found residing at the house of Mr. Dawson, the only English merchant (although by birth a Russian,) resident here."], [65, "1837.] 17 PANAMA. The Sulphur, on arriving, had ascertained the state of affairs, and finding it probable that they would not immediately be settled, her commander had deemed it prudent to avoid any chance of col lision with any of the braggadocios, (who volunteered to capture her if necessary,) and therefore fixed on the island of Taboga, about twelve miles distant, where he had fixed his observatory. As it became important that the distances should be measured from Panama, from whence the rockets might be seen, and as all our western operations were to hinge on this position, the Sulphur was ordered to repair to Panama, and the observatory was erected on the N.E. angle of the fortifications. Instructions, in reply to notes forwarded to our various consuls from the foreign office, had already reached from Bogota, directing the several authori ties to afford me every facility ; and I now found that no impediment would have been offered, even had I arrived in the midst of the blockade. The instruc tions to the commandant at Chagres warranted this, and the facilities offered by the authorities at Panama fully evinced their disposition to second the views of the governor of Bogota.

CHAPTER II. Having formally taken the command of the Sulphur, and replaced Lieutenant Kellett in the Starling, Lieutenant Dashwood was invalided, and several of the Sulphur's crew were discharged for passage to England. The affairs of the late consul's family having been arranged, and the necessary preparations completed for their removal, I recommenced my journey lo Gorgona with five pocket chronometers. We formed a complete escort for the ladies ; and, arriving shortly before them at Gorgona, made all the necessary arrangements for such comfort as could be procured on their water excursion down to Chagres. Accompanied by Lieutenant Collinson, who was already previously prepared for my immediate depar ture, we stepped into a light canoe at eight the same evening, but did not succeed in reaching Chagres before noon the day following. The ori ginal agreement for this canoe, down and to return, was six dollars ; but our increased number induced"], [69, "1836.] 21 GORGONA. them to impose; therefore rather than lose an instant I was glad to hear the paddles in motion at the price of ten. About dawn the ensuing morning, the heavy canoes arrived, and as our repose had been disturbed, in the same manner as on our former visit, we were fully prepared to receive our fair travellers, for whom we had prepared coffee and other requisites by the aid of our kind friend Captain Fraser, \u2014 their meeting with whom was a melancholy one, as about one year before he had landed them, in the bloom of health and enjoyment, at this very spot. At eight, we took our leave of them, they em barking in the Nimrod, and we proceeding to our pro fessional toils, under a broiling sun, on the ramparts of San Lorenzo. We had arranged to return at two to Gorgona, but our crew had been tampered with, were intoxi cated, and it was merely by giving way to all their absurd demands for increase of pay that we even tually departed at dark. At ten on the 20th, we reached Gorgona, and tried a second set of rockets on Mount Caraveli, but being of faulty construction they failed, bursting the instant they were fired, without ascent. A second station, by bags of powder exploded from a high tree on Ato. Ormigero, succeeded. On the following morning we commenced our journey to Panama, the heavy chronometers being packed in a basket of hay, with the pocket watches"], [70, "22 [1836. PANAMA. above them; the whole secured on the head and back of a light-footed Motero. Some of these men carry enormous burthens ; I have already mentioned one case weighing one hundred and seventy-six pounds, brought on the head. It was in this manner, in a chair with the back se cured to the head, and the hind legs supported by stirrups to the shoulders, that the Padres travelled in central America and the Equador. It is not impro bable that some of these individuals exceeded the above weight. On my arrival at Panama I found the weather continued so very hazy, and the light of the moon interfered so much, that further operations were delayed until the termination of our survey of the bay, when another attempt was made from Ato. Ormigero to connect Gorgona with Panama by ex plosion bags. No one could have felt a greater interest than myself in these operations, and provided I could have been the actor, endued with ubiquity, very possibly I might have been better satisfied with the results. But I have long acted in con junction with others, and I recollect only two or three instances where comparisons obtained by simultaneous signals from ship to shore, and within three miles, have been satisfactory. I know this from possessing two first-rate pocket chronometers, whose differences could not exceed O'^\", but which nevertheless exhibited as much as two seconds error"], [71, ""], [72, ""], [73, "1836.] 23 PANAMA. in comparisons thus taken. I have frequently taken a set of comparisons with our whole force of chronome ters immediately after an assistant, and found errors of five-tenths or more. I am therefore perfectly satisfied that good pocket watches, previously rated at the extreme positions, are more worthy of confi dence than explosion of rockets. We seldom find two observers note the flash of a gun in perfect accordance, even at three miles. Panama was formerly a place of some note, but shortly after the visit of Ulloa, about a century ago, may be said to have arrived at its zenith. The remains of the buildings evince wealth, and afford some idea of the extent to which they hoped to carry their improvements. But they are now fast falling into decay. TJie port is seldom visited by vessels of any size, and the fortifications, which originally were admirably constructed, are rapidly following the fate of the houses. The population is chiefly a mixed race : few Spaniards are to be found. One Englishman, and the American consular agent, comprise all the society we met. This doubtless will change the instant the steam navigation is in force. Inns and lodging-houses must then arise for the accommodation of those pur suing this route. There is every facility for erecting a substantial pier, and improving the inner anchorage, which must follow the arrival of the steamers, unless they still"], [74, "[1837 24 TABOGA. submit to the miserable landing at the sea-port gate, which is as filthy as it is inconvenient. Of the governor we saw nothing, except officially. I made the acquaintance of General Herran, with whom I was much pleased. He has been at the British court, and was a friend of the late Admiral Fleming. I am indebted to him for his influence in preserving order at our quarters on the lines. Panama affords the usual supplies which are to be obtained in these tropical regions, and at mode rate prices, but vessels wishing to procure water, bullocks, &c, can obtain them more readily at the island of Taboga. Having completed our operations at Panama, as well as the survey of the immediate neighbourhood, the Sulphur was moved to the anchorage at Taboga, where she remained completing water and the ne cessary arrangements for the run up the coast. On quitting Panama, our chronometric force was twenty. two; of these seventeen were trustworthy. On the 15th March, we quitted Taboga, and pursued our voyage along the coast, with the Star ling in company. On being becalmed off a deep indentation of the coast, which appeared to be the mouth of a river, I left in my gig, in order to fix one of its points, directing the ship to follow in should the breeze permit, and the signal for depth be made. About noon she was anchored in what we found to be Baia Honda, and about four p.m. our operations"], [75, "1837.] 25 MAGNETIC ISLAND. having been completed, we again put to sea in our route to Realejo. As the 21st March was at hand, I determined on selecting the first eligible spot for making our first suite of quarterly observations, and on the evening of the 20th was fortunate enough to find safe land ing on a very convenient island off the mouth of the river leading to Pueblo Nueva. As these observations were principally magnetic, this island received the name of Magnetic Island. No natives who could afford us any information pre sented themselves ; and all we succeeded in eliciting, was that Pueblo Nueva was situated some distance up the river, of which a very partial survey was at that time made. Our operations here having been completed, we moved on for Realejo. On the 28th, passed the Island of Cano, and on the 29th, between it and the main, found ourselves at daylight, off the mouth of a large inlet, which we had not time to examine ; the current setting strong to the eastward ; the weather very hazy, followed by thunder, lightning, and rain. On the morning of the 30th, we passed the Gulf of Nicoya, and close to the island termed Cape Blanco, at its western point. Here we found ourselves obstructed by a point off which the breakers and rocky ledges above water, extended a considerable distance to seaward. The soundings were regular from twenty-five to eleven, and eight and a half fathoms, hard sand, in which latter depth we tacked"], [76, "26 [1837. VOLCAN DE LEON. successively within a mile and a half of the shore surf, and an outer roller about half a mile from us on the last tack. The weather during the whole day was thick and hazy over the land, followed at nightfall by thunder, lightning, and rain. These symptoms of the approach of the bad season rendered me doubly anxious to get to the northward, as our crew were not at this period in the best condition, and the moist heat we experienced was very oppressive. At daylight the weather hazy, and Cape Blanco still in sight. A short distance to the westward we observed a sandy sloping bluff, off which a shelf, ap parently composed of sand, with conical studded rocks, extended a considerable distance to seaward. On a sandy islet near the bluff, two very remarkable ears jutting up, off which we tacked in thirteen and a half fathoms, sand. On the 2nd, atmosphere hazy, breeze freshened considerably, which on the 3rd reduced us to double reefs, gradually decreasing towards daylight, when the Volcan de Leon, as well as that of Viego, were plainly seen, and particularly well defined. These strong breezes just at the point we met them, viz. off the Punta Santa Catalina, are the prevailing gusts termed Papagayos, which blow with great force out of that Gulf, and frequently cause the loss of spars. Many fish of large size were seen, and several dolphin caught. At noon we had reached Point Desolada \u2014 a most"], [77, "1837.] 27 ISLAND OF CARDON. appropriate name certainly ; it seems almost in mockery that one or two stunted shrubs are allowed to stand on its summit \u2014 objects at all times of in terest to us. We failed in reaching Realejo before dark, and not knowing its dangers, preferred standing off and on during the night, in preference to the being rocked to sleep by anchoring in the heavy ground swell, or lulled by the roaring of the surf, at all times par ticularly loud on this coast. The sailing remarks will be found in the appendix. At eight the following morning we anchored about a mile from the western end of Cardon, where, on landing, I found a mark probably left by the Conway when she examined this place a few years back. The Island of Cardon is of volcanic origin, and the beach contains so much iron, that the sand, which probably is washed up, caused the mag netic needle to vibrate 21\u00b0 from zero. I do not, however, believe that the needle was much, if at all, affected on the summit of the island, where our observations were conducted. Our position was on its new cliffy angle. The boats having examined and found the anchorage safe, the Sulphur was brought in and anchored within the Island of Aserradores, in perfectly still water, four fathoms mud. On the Island of Aserradores our tide gauge was established, being free from undulation, although directly open to seaward through Barra Falsa ; and"], [78, "28 [1837. ISLAND OF ASERRADORES. we were fortunate enough to find a good well of fresh water close to the beach. The principal object of my visit at this moment was to complete our supplies of sugar and rum, which we had been informed by our naval friends were good and reasonable, and, moreover, the produce of a farm belonging to one of our countrymen, Mr. Bridge. In this we were rightly informed, and the purser was immediately despatched to make the necessary purchases, as well as bullocks, and other necessaries. Trusting to the accounts I had read of the mag nificence of this port, I had fully intended placing the ship near the town. The visit of the captain of the port soon undeceived me. He assured me that at low water not more than three feet would be found near the town, and so narrow, that there was barely room for the oars of my gig, and then only by careful steerage. Indeed, I found that although the ship might be warped two miles higher up, she would there be entirely shut from any breeze, her yards probably locked in the trees, and swarming with mosquitoes. I deem these remarks particu larly called for, as the accounts given in the Modern Traveller may otherwise mislead. This port, if a settlement were established on the islands of Aserradores, Cardon, or Castanon, would probably be more frequented ; but the distance from the position where vessels usually anchor (within Cardon) to Realejo, is a sad drawback to vessels"], [79, "1837.] 29 ISLAND OF ASERRADORES. touching merely for supplies. Rum is also too cheap and too great a temptation for the seamen. Supplies of poultry, fruit, bullocks, grain, &c, are, however, very reasonable, and of very superior quality ; turkeys are said to attain an incredible weight ; they still, how ever, justly maintain a very high reputation. At the period of our visit, a young American had imported machinery for a cotton mill, and had also advanced funds to a family of Leon for the cul tivation of the cotton plant on the island of Aser radores. But although the house on the island was in progress, and the machinery erected between Realejo and San Antonio, I much doubt the success of either speculation. Cotton thrives well in the interior, but not on Mangrove islands such as Aserradores, and the plan of the mill power I much question. These people also are too indolent for the suc cessful pursuit of anything which requires perseve rance. They are attracted for the time by the novelty, and rave on the idea of the fortunes they are to make, but one unlucky accident overthrows all their hopes and stability. The present village of Realejo (for the name of Town cannot be applied to such a collection of hovels) contains one main street about two hundred yards in length, with three or four cross openings, leading to the isolated cottages in the back lanes of huts. With the exception of the houses occupied by the"], [80, "30 [1837. REALEJO. commandant, our Vice-consul, Mr. Forster, admi nistrador of customs, and one or two others, there is not a decent house in the place. The ruins of a well constructed church attest its former respectability; but the place is now little more than a collection of huts. The inhabitants generally present a most unhealthy appearance, and there is scarcely a cottage Avithout some diseased or sickly-hued person to be seen. Our botanical collector proceeded to Leon, in order to make the most of his time. The purser and surgeon visited the sugar establishment of Mr. Bridges at San Antonio, but the duties of the survey detained me at the ship. About a mile below the town the ruins of an old but well built fort, with three embrasures, are yet to be traced, and between it and the town are the floor timbers of a brig, which ventured up to grave, but fell to pieces before she was taken in hand. Vessels of 100 tons have grounded at the pier of Realejo Custom-house, but above that they would be left dry at low water. Mr. Forster, the Vice-consuL happened to be on a visit to Grenada during our visit ; we therefore had not the pleasure of becoming acquainted with him. On the 10th the Starling rejoined us, and our observations and interior survey being complete, we moved to the outer anchorage, to finish the external parts of our plan."], [81, "1837.] 31 REALEJO. On the 12th the Starling was despatched to Li bertad in order to make the necessary arrangements for obtaining time there, at the instant of our arrival, as well as to make enquiries, and provide for our visit to San Salvador, where our Consul-general, Mr. Chatfield, resided. Realejo is the only port after quitting Panama where British residents can be found, or supplies con veniently obtained. Water of the finest quality is obtained from a powerful stream, into which the boat can be brought and the casks filled by baling, alongside of a small wall raised to cause a higher level. Here the women resort to wash, but by due notice to the Alcalde, this is prevented. A guide is necessary on the first visit, after entering the creek which leads to it, and which should only be entered at half flood ; it is necessary to pole the remainder, the channel not having sufficient width for oars. The water from the well on the island of Aser radores is good, but I have a great objection to water infiltrated through marine sand and decayed vegetable matter, and consider the chances of sickness one step removed by obtaining it from a running stream. The mountains in the neighbourhood of Realejo are magnificent, particularly to the spectator at twelve or fifteen miles off shore ; but as they will be subse quently noticed, as well as the Estero Dona Paula, which leads up to Leon, I shall not advert to them further at present."], [82, "[1837. 32 LIBERTAD. On the 13th of April, we quitted Realejo, and aided by land and sea breezes, reached the anchorage off Libertad, on the 15th, by eight A. m. Here I found my good friend Kellett had fully met my wishes, and after breakfast, the surf being then moderate, we risked our persons, not however without a wetting, and gained the Custom house on the beach, which is little better than a mud hut, with a small cabin at one end for the officer. Here we were detained waiting for mules until two p. m., and without any respectable place of shelter, and nothing to amuse us, or even to kill time. This delay became doubly annoying as it would prevent our reaching San Sal- vador before dark. We mounted our mules, how- ever, which seemed to promise us some little vexation from their miserable condition and, accompanied by Kellett, set off for San Salvador. The mules, which were before blown in the exertions to evade their pursuers, and much worried by innumerable horse flies, which caused the blood at times to roll freely down their faces, could neither be persuaded nor compelled to move at a faster than cargo rate, little exceeding a walk. The road is through a very mountainous tract, and for the first five miles the great effort is made to ascend by a bridle road, little better than a goat path, or very similar to the roads between Gorgona and Panama. On reaching the highest pitch from whence we could observe the sea, the scenery grew more interesting, and as the sun declined it became beautiful. At"], [83, "1837.] 33 A ROUGH NIGHT. this season too every thing appeared to disadvantage, the atmosphere being hazy, and the vegetation parched ; they were also burning the trees, &c, to clear and manure, and the temperature was sultry in the extreme. About seven we reached the village of Hojia, but hardly had we made our calculations on reaching the city of San Salvador, at nine, when the sound of thunder and the appearance of heavy black clouds caused us to pause. Our guide also made his pre parations for the coming storm with so much deter mination, by unsaddling and packing our baggage under the centre of an open horse-shed, that it was received by us as a signal for no further remonstrance. Thunder, lightning, and rain we had in profusion. But there are few eviF without some trifling loophole through which comfort may be derived, or at all events imagined, by those in the humour to make the best of all disasters. The change of temperature was a great relief, and we consoled ourselves by looking forward to the enjoyments of a cool ride when the clouds should have passed. The only shelter we had was shared with our mules ; and, perched on our respective saddles and baggage, aided by Indian corn leaves, we were glad to sup on a couple of eggs, and a plaintain each, not having touched food since six A.M.

At two we entered the city of San Salvador, and were misdirected by the guard to the house of the French Consul, who was not a little surprised at such an unexpected visit. He was, however, ex cessively civil, offered us accommodation, and finally sent his servant to conduct us to the house of our Consul-general, Mr. Chatfield, who turned out with much good-humour, provided refreshments, and having chatted away the interval employed in preparing our beds, we finally enjoyed an uninterrupted repose in civilized style. We were amused in the morning by the sound of martial music, and found a band of eight heroes very pompously attired, parading the street, but unaccompanied by troops. At ten they returned with the latter, in number about twenty ; the master of the band, fancying himself at least a general, and using as many antics as a gander, leading forth his troop to the green. The whole number re minded one much of Liston's brave army in Bom bastes Furioso. The town is very prettily situated on a level plain or amphitheatre, from which several lofty mountains rise, that of the Volcano de San Salvador being the most conspicuous. The streets are broad, and very clean for a foreign town ; the houses have very projecting eaves; they are substantial, although lightly constructed, and of one story only, in con-"], [85, "1837.] 35 EVILS OF INDEPENDENCE. sequence of the liability to frequent shocks of earth quake. They have internal courts, and appear to possess convenience, space, and comfort. All are well supplied with water by aqueducts ; have a good market, every necessary being cheap, and abundant ; and nothing is wanting to their comfort but society, and strictly enforced order. The want of this latter, I am informed, is a sad drawback ; and it never can be attained under their present laws, habits, &c. One of these habits, arising from their new system of Independence, is entering your house, and seating themselves without invitation : any opposition might be attended by unpleasant results \u2014 even to assassi nation. During the day we accompanied Mr. Chatfield to call on the President Morasan, an intelligent gen tlemanly person, very much like the portrait of Bolivar, which at the time was suspended over his chair. We afterwards called to make our apologies to the French Consul, who, being from home, re turned the call, and pressed us strongly to dine the day following, but as our return was imperative, we were obliged to decline the honour. The temperature in the shade during our stay averaged 76\u00b0. At six the next morning, we commenced our journey to Libertad. The weather was cool and pleasant, from the effects of the late rain. The country in the neighbourhood of the city appears to be in cultivation \u2014 apparently sugar-cane. Cattle d 2"], [86, "[1837 36 A DESERTER. are abundant, and, although in a state of civil war, the toils of clearing the soil of wood, by fire and axe, are still in activity. On reaching the highest point of the ridge, which commands the sea as well as the surrounding moun tains, wo had anticipated a grand treat, but the action of the sun on the recently saturated earth had clothed all in vapour. At a stream, half the distance down, we stopped to take our luncheon, which we enjoyed under the shadow of an immense tree overhanging the stream. Our poor beasts, however, were grievously tormented by their enemies, the horse-flies, which caused them literally to flow with blood, but more particularly about the head and neck. About two o'clock, as we neared the beach, I perceived Lieutenant Collinson awaiting my arrival. His presence on shore, backed by the expression of his countenance, foretold disaster; and I very shortly learned that my gig had been overwhelmed in the surf, and my coxswain drowned. This was a severe blow to me, as I had never before lost a man since I held a command. On our arrival at the beach, I found no less than fourteen hands on shore, and not the slightest chance of passing the surf. We were compelled patiently to await the following dawn, at which moment the sea, owing to the land breeze blowing during the night, and until six in the morning, usually overcomes the impetus given by the sea breeze of the day."], [87, "1837.] 37 APATHY OF THE AUTHORITIES. By the statement of Lieutenant Collinson, I found that our misfortune was witnessed by the persons in power with the most perfect apathy ; and of this I had ocular demonstration in a second mishap. In the morning we succeeded in passing our whale-boat, \"which got out well. Kellett followed in his gig, but unfortunately got into a heavy roller, and for some minutes I was at a loss to ascertain who were saved, my attention being directed to Kellett. By great exertion I prevailed on one or two natives to assist the seamen, who, although not more than knee deep, were sinking from exhaustion, and would probably without aid have been carried back by the efflux. I was myself, although fresh, scarcely able to keep my footing, the boulders and sand falling back with such force on the efflux. During this affair, the commandant stood mute, nor did those under his command offer the slightest assistance. However, their miserable appearance but too truly indicated their utter helplessness and imbecility. We succeeded in recovering the gig, which was slightly stove, and as we could not get off for several days, we employed ourselves in preparing her for the next attempt. Every scheme to effect a communication, by casks, rockets, &c, failed, and every attempt to take ad vantage of a lull proved abortive, although Kellett watched in the water, with the boat afloat, for some hours."], [88, "[1837. 38 LIBERTAD. At length, on the morning of the 22 April, we suc ceeded in passing Kellett out in his gig by six a. m. We had no serviceable whale-boat remaining, and one of our gigs was therefore sent. She swamped in a heavy roller, but the officer, Mr. Speck, mate, and crew, having been selected for the duty and well prepared, swam in with the connecting line fast to our cutter, which was moored without the danger limit. They also succeeded in bringing in the boat, but bilged. A cask containing implements was then hauled in, into which the clothes and in struments were packed and sent off by the line to the cutter. Having repaired our boat rapidly, we made an attempt, and fortunately passed without a spray. The body of the coxswain was not found, although the shores were searched daily. It is probable that he was taken by the sharks, as he was a light hand and expert swimmer. \" Port of Libertad.\" One would naturally expect from this title that something pretending to a bay, or deep indentation at least, would have warranted the appellation. But a straight sandy beach, be tween two slightly projecting ledges of rock about one mile asunder, forms the playa of Libertad : it is law and interest only that have made it a port. At times the bay is smooth, but the substratum at the beach being of large smooth boulders of com pact basalt, the instant the surf rises they are freed from their sandy covering, and a dangerous moving"], [89, "1837.] 39 LIBERTAD. stony bottom left, on which the boat grounded. We were informed that it is generally violent for three or four days at full and change, which corresponded to the time of our visits. The village contains about twelve huts, with a family of about six in each. There is also a long go vernment building constructed of adobes, in which the tackle of the bongos used for landing cargoes is usually stored ; and a cabin for the commandant at its extremity served for parlour, bedroom, kitchen, &c. The only pet birds were fighting cocks perched under the chairs, or probably tethered in the corners. Cockfighting is a complete passion in Spanish America. This is all that can be hoped for at Libertad. The rollers which set in on this beach curl and break at times in four or five fathoms, at least a quarter of a mile off. Those within, which are the most dangerous, are caused by the offset or efflux. The sand beach is composed chiefly of magnetic iron sand, the dried superstratum, about one inch in thickness, caking in flakes free from admixture. The anchorage is uneasy, and, I should think, unsafe, and should be avoided near the full moon. Sudden rollers come in, which are apt to snap chain cables, unless with a long range. Poultry, bullocks, &c, are to be obtained, but compared with those of San Salvador or Realejo, the prices are exorbitant. Bullocks can only be embarked in one of their bongos."], [90, "40 [1837. TRACK OF THE BLOSSOM. On the 22nd we quitted our anchorage, intending to make the shortest passage to San Bias. By the advice of several old traders, I stood to sea in order to reach the trades, as the inshore passage is not only tedious, but subject to strong gales in opening the Gulf of Tehuantepec. We experienced a very heavy swell from the north, succeeded by strong breezes, and parted com pany from the Starling during the night \u2014 the ship very wet and uneasy.

Current strong, easterly. The land breezes, ivhen close in shore, helped us from eleven p.m. until eight a.m., but were never suffi ciently strong to impel us beyond three knots, \u2014 seldom two. On the morning of the 14th, saw the Starling about ten miles to the E. S. E. ; kept sight of her from the mast head until the evening of the 19th, when she again parted. On the evening of the 17th, when tacking very close in, apparently at the mouth of a large river or estuary, observed a vast crowd of men, women, and children, waving to us. This, we afterwards found, was some superstitious ablution which had collected thousands from the interior. I have wit nessed a very similar exhibition at Lytham in Lan cashire, in the month of August, at the highest spring tide. On the evening of the 20th we anchored off Manzanilla, and dispatched a boat to seek for water. On her return, we learned that the Leonora barque, having some English amongst her crew, was at anchor inside, and that water might be obtained close to the beach. On the following morning, we beat in, and anchored in a snug berth in twelve fathoms. We determined the position ; obtained"], [92, "42 [1837. PORT OF MANZANILLA. ten tons of water and one bullock ; and at midnight were again en route. The bay is small, but safe, anchorage good, water brackish. There are no houses, \u2014 men and families living exposed under the trees, and had not the Leonora been there, it is probable that we should not have met a soul. This port is the main sea communication with the city of Colima, thirty leagues, or eighteen hours travel from hence, and containing a population of thirty-eight thousand. The following was kindly furnished by a friend, who at the moment was on business at Colima. \" This port has a good anchorage, and is well protected against the southerly winds prevalent during the rainy reason, but, on account of a very considerable lake of stagnant water in its immediate neighbourhood, is very unhealthy during the summer. Infested by myriads of mosquitoes and sand flies, even in the dry season, it is nearly impossible to reside there. \" This port has been open to foreign commerce for several years, but has not been able to make much progress. The port itself has not a single house, and the first adjacent town is Colima, for merly the capital of the territory bearing the same name, now embodied with the department of Michoacan. \" Colima, it is true, is a large town, of considerable"], [93, "1837.] 43 COLIMA. consumption, containing about thirty thousand in habitants ; but the distance from the port (thirty leagues) and the difficulty of communication, the roads being passable in the dry season only, na turally augment the expenses on any mercantile transaction, to such a degree that it scarcely pays \u2014 as any cargo which could be introduced, would be merely to supply the district of Colima. Such drawbacks, added to the detention, deter vessels from touching at Manzanilla. \" Another cause which must divert the maritime trade from Colima and Manzanilla, is the preferable market at the capital of Guadalaxara, for its produce of sugar, maize, coffee, cocoa, indigo, &c. ; and as these articles are not eligible for exportation, on account of the high cost prices, the foreign merchant could only deal in cash payments, whilst Guadalaxara, which is generally overstocked with goods, via Tam pico on the east, and San Bias on the west, can supply Colima with the necessary merchandize by barter. \" The articles saleable at Colima are linens, cotton goods, woollens, and a little hardware ; but, as already stated, in small quantities, calculated perhaps for the the consumption of about ten to fifteen thousand souls.\" The captain of the port had previously received full instructions to afford us every facility that the country could offer, and to repair to the beach on our"], [94, "[1837 44 TEPIC arrival. We found him here, but doubtless brought down by the supercargoes of the Leonora. He urged me strongly to wait until the following day, when the colonel commanding at Colima would call upon me. We quitted the port at dawn. After a very tedious beat, we succeeded in reaching San Bias on the 27th, but did not gain our berth at the usual anchorage until the following morning, when we found the Starling had been here two days. No prospect of provisions, and no dispatches. On the receipt of a letter from my old friend Mr. Barron, our Vice-consul at Tepic, who held out hopes of finding provisions at Mazatlan, which had belonged to a whaler wrecked at Cape St. Lucas, I immediately despatched the Starling to purchase them, with directions to rejoin me off Isabel Island. Having received a very pressing invitation to come to Tepic, where Mr. Barron was suffering in apprehension of a severe family affliction, and it being essentially necessary that we should arrange about letters, provisions, &c, I set off immediately, accompanied by my assistant-surgeon Mr. Hinds, and Messrs. Simpkinson and Nicholson, mids. As we entered the town, Mr. Barron's favourite daughter, about eighteen, expired, and it was not for some days that I could communicate with him on service matters. I had already received an invitation from another friend Mr. Forbes, to make his house my resting place during my visit, (I was also his guest in 1828,) and foreseeing the gloominess of the"], [95, "1837.] 45 SAN BLAS. house of affliction, he had most kindly made arrange ments for the accommodation of all our party. The funeral, which took place the following day, was very splendid, and attended by all the rank and respectability of Tepic ; indeed the loss appeared a public calamity ; so entirely was the deceased the idol of this small community, every family seemed to participate in it ; nor did they regain their spirits during our stay. Having made the necessary observations for proving the longitude of Tepic, and completed my affairs with the Consul, we started for San Bias at half-past three the following morning, and reached the beach at four in the afternoon. Passing through the town of San Bias, it being my first visit since 1828, I was astonished at its utter desolation. It seemed like another Pompeii, or the tomb of a city, compared to what I had witnessed in 1828. In the square, which at that period had every door open, not three human beings were to be seen ; and on the market evening, (Saturday,) when I cer tainly expected to have found some little remnant of former gay scenes, not one hundredth of the num bers were assembled. It is truly melancholy to witness such changes. I fear its fate is sealed, and nothing but a pile of ruins will mark this once gay spot, particularly as the main road now passes beneath the hill, and the houses at the beach have increased. That same evening I took my departure, the ship"], [96, "46 [1837. THE STARLING. having weighed in the afternoon, and awaited me outside the Piedra de Tierra.

[1837. CHAPTER III. Our course was now directed for the Sandwich Islands, where we were almost certain of completing our supplies. Baffling winds, with a heavy S.W. swell, prevented our clearing Cape San Lucas until the 14th, when we began to make pretty fair runs. Sunday, June 19th, having reached the range of Socorro and Clarion Groups, several of which are doubtful, I despatched the Starling to seek for Fresh water and Clouds Islands, and rejoin us off Clarion. My attention was directed to Clarion, Nublada, and Best Islands. The weather unfortunately was very unpropitious, preventing our obtaining astrono mical observations. Birds, principally gannet, together with broad patches of weed at times, plentiful. On the 20th we found we had been drifted much to the southward of our reckoning ; hauled up for Best's Island, and passed over its assumed position, at which time we could easily have discovered a breaker five, and land ten miles off. About six we made the east end of Clarion Island, distant about fifteen miles ;"], [99, "1837.] 49 SEARCH FOR ISLANDS. and by eight its bearing, due north, proved that its position in longitude is not far from correct. The Starling was now directed to pursue a course so as to enter on the 130\u00b0 meridian in latitude 17\u00b0 N. I bore up to preserve a parallel course to her, and enter at 16\u00b0 30' N., at which point another cluster of doubtful islands was reported to exist, as well as a continuous batch given us by the whalers in 1826 and 1827, as far as 135\u00b0, and which we then sought in the Blossom, without success. As the Starling would preserve a W.b.S. and the Sulphur a W.b.N. course through that region, avoiding the Blossom's track, they ought to have been found if they existed. 22nd. Wind light, Medus\u00e6 more plentiful, and a few sticks floating, excited our hopes of finding land ; but the current having been determined to set S. 86\u00b0 W., this would bring them from Clarion island. 24th. Breeze varied much in strength, water smooth, Tropic birds, (Phaeton \u00c6therius,) and frigate Pelican (Pelecanus Aquilus) also observed. As these latter birds do not go far from land, I am disposed to believe some one of these reports to be well founded, but the position erroneously determined. Weather unfavourable for astronomical observations, even should we discover land. 25th. Weather variable in jmffs, varying our rate from five to nine kn'ots. Shortly after noon the appear ance on the lee quarter caused me to suspect land in that direction, but the indication was not sufficiently distinct to warrant any deviation from our course. VOL. I. E"], [100, "THE BLOSSOM'S TRACK. [1837. 50 Should chance lead me in this direction again, I shall certainly cross the meridian of to-day fifteen miles further south.

The spaces thus examined must, however, relieve the general navigation of this region. I have been thus minute upon this subject, as I cannot divest myself of the impression that land exists in this neighbourhood. So many assertions can hardly rest on imagination. By the ordinary system of laying down the track of vessels, no clue is obtained as to the actual limits of examination. The actual limit of vision is entirely lost sight of. To render this more distinct in the Sulphur's track, great attention has been paid to the radius of vision, so that the dotted circles distinctly point out where no land can exist. The space has also been sounded two hourly, with as much line as our velocity would admit. Sharks troublesome ; lost one patent log, and the"], [101, "1837.] SINGULAR CASCADES. 51 rotator of a second damaged. Mr. Massey should invent something to obviate this nuisance. On July 7th, at daylight, saw the outline of the island Maui, (or Mowee of the charts,) and about eight the N.W. extremity of Hawaii (Owhyhee.) The heavy clouds capping the summits of both islands prevented our obtaining a glimpse of these remarkable peaks. The numerous cascades resulting from the showers afforded us a very interesting embellishment to the lower scenery, which we were passing within three or four miles of the breaker line. To seamen there is a peculiar enjoyment even in the sight of fresh water; but the numerous silver threads of it here sportively displayed must be seen to be duly enjoyed. No description can convey the idea of their number and variety, and a sketch including twenty leaps within one or two hundred yards, would appear almost a burlesque, yet such was the fact. About four we passed the east end of Maui, and came sud denly upon Morotoi, (or Molokoi,) Rana (Lana) visible in the interval.* The view of Molokoi from this position is very singular. Four exactly parallel outlines of most picturesque and lofty cliffs appeared almost a visual deception, or the effect of quadruple refraction. But as we advanced it proved in this instance a reality ; height about four hundred feet, and varying but slightly from the perpendicular. * All the words formerly commencing with R now take L. E 2"], [102, "[1837. 52 HONULULU. The current being strong in our favour, and our velocity above eight knots, the scene varied suf ficiently to preserve our interest from flagging. Here also, as on Maui, several very pretty and loftier cascades embellished the scenery, which was ricli in colours, but like the work of the scene painter, not bearing to be examined too closely. Attired in nature's clothing only, the scene will probably never be subjected to cultivation. About sunset we were off the N.W. extreme of Molokoi, and steering for Oahu. About midnight we found ourselves much closer to the breakers of the latter island than our speed warranted us in expecting, the current having helped us consider ably. Fortunately we were on the alert, and hauled off in time to escape danger. The wind being very strong, with rain, we hove to until daylight and then bore up for Honululu. At six the pilot's boat came off, bringing Mr. Rey nolds ; the pilot being drunk, and the wind not admit ting our entry, we anchored outside. I landed, and was received with much warmth by my old friends the British and American Consuls. On the morning following the ship was anchored within the harbour, and our refit commenced. The Consul applied for my interference, in the question raised against this government, by the forcible entry of the brigantine Clementine, under the British flag, and compelling her to receive on"], [103, "1837.] Clementine's affair. 53 board as prisoners two French missionaries, brought by her on her late voyage hither from California, \u2014 thus making a prison-ship of a British vessel \u2014 after her cargo had been started, the vessel returned to her owner, and these people were permitted to land. The government at first had endeavoured to carry their object by bribery with the master and owner ; on this failing, they had recourse to force ; on which the Consul advised the colours to be struck, and the vessel abandoned. The Consul, I think rather in discreetly, caused the flag to be burned. I had before been apprised that the lady chief, Kinau, who governs the island, was entirely under the control of a missionary, not only obnoxious to the civilised community, but also in bad odour with the natives and chiefs themselves, and that I should not be able to obtain satisfaction. It was further reported, that by his advice (or command) the cruel and barbarous act of sending these two persons to be landed on a desolate part of California in 1830, was carried into effect merely from the fancy that his followers would be seduced by them from his style of religion, \u2014 if I am to profane the name by terming it such. My duty, however, was plain. If I could succeed in opening their eyes to the injustice and inhumanity of their act, as well as the grievous insult they had, through their ignorance, offered to our flag, tant mieux. Failing in that, stronger measures would follow."], [104, "[1837. 54 MISSIONARY THREAT. Havings given due notice to Kinau and her chiefs that I wished to speak on this subject, they assem bled at her house, Kuanoa, her husband, receiving us with military honours, in his general's uniform. The chiefs were present, as well as most of the missionary establishment. Finding remonstrance useless, and that their principal missionary leader, Mr. Bingham, evidently spoke in his own name as well as theirs, and there fore that they were not free agents, I ventured to acquaint them that stronger arguments must be resorted to, and I instantly ordered the brig to be recaptured, and the British colours re-hoisted. Mr. Bingham then ventured to show himself in his true colours, and, intimating \" that blood would flow from this act,\" I most distinctly assured him, \" that having now ascertained his character, I should visit that threat on his head, and that his life should answer for the first drop of British blood which his agency should cause to flow.\" It is true that I did accompany that threat with my clenched fist, but totally false that any action of mine towards Kinau could be so construed. Indeed, I felt too much pity for her situation, and so far from the slightest animosity at that instant existing, she shook hands with me, and Kuanoa, the husband, warmly pressed my hand at parting. I immediately decided on landing the missionaries, and sending an officer in the Clementine to Maui, requesting the immediate presence of the king, who was there on a visit."], [105, "1837.] 55 LA VENUS. At this critical moment the French frigate La Venus, of sixty guns, made her appearance. Captain du Petit Thouars sent to request I would allow him to act in conjunction, and on his landing, a fresh interview was requested and obtained. However, finding them stubbornly determined on maintaining their acts, we came to the determination of awaiting the arrival of the king. Before sunset the missionaries were reinstated in their domiciles, accompanied by the white popula tion, and crowds of natives, who appeared to rejoice in the act. The recaptured Clementine, in charge of Mr. Speck, mate, and under her proper banner, triumphantly quitted Honululu to apprise the king of our first acts.* The Starling hove in sight about the same time, and so far from showing any hostile feeling, Kuanoa himself, with his large war canoes, assisted in warping her in. The Venus I had been taught to expect in these seas, her voyage being partly scientific ; our meeting, therefore, was very cordial. At a dejeune given on board the Venus to the Consuls and myself, the flags of England and America combined were hoisted at the fore, and a salute of eighteen guns fired. I regretted much our inability to return the salute, our orders forbidding it except in cases of necessity. On the 20th the king arrived, contrary to the * These and the foregoing facts are noticed as a short denial of the false statements which have appeared on this subject."], [106, "[1837. 56 ROYAL LETTER. expectation of many, as we had been given to un derstand that every missionary entreaty and threat had been exerted to prevent him. However, as his reply to my letter was friendly, and very decided, I will do him the justice to say that I never for an instant doubted the pledge he had given me. \" Lahaina, (Maui,) July 13th, 1837. \" Captain Belcher, of H.

I waited on him on board her, and arranged a meeting for the day following. The captain of the Venus, accompanied by his officers, and the American and English Consuls, with myself and such officers as could be spared, repaired at noon to the king's house, where we were received by the officers attendant on the king, in their state uniforms, similar to those worn at the time of Lord Byron's visit in 1825. The king wore a round blue jacket with lace straps on the shoulders, and an embroidered crown on the sides of the collar, with fawn-coloured drill trowsers. The chiefs were seated on chairs, in line with the king ; the lady chiefs on a bank of raised mats behind. Our party occupied a line of chairs fronting them. The king has not grown much since 1827, but is confirmed in his formation, stout built, and about five feet six. His reception was very cordial, but I could plainly discern that he had been previously severely schooled for this meeting. Before proceeding to business, both Captain de Petit Thouars and myself protested against the in terpretation or interference of Mr. Bingham ; indeed we requested his absence. This latter point was not conceded, and he took up a position where he could command the eye of the king ; but the sharp glances of some of the officers of both ships were too"], [108, "[1837. 58 DISCUSSION. powerful for him; and I believe something very much allied to menace from one of the lieutenants of the Venus damped his ardour, as he spent the remainder of the time with his head between his hands, nearly resting it on his knees. The questions at issue were \u2014 1st, The forcible entry of the Clementine, and putting on board Messrs. Bachelot and Short. 2nd, The right of British subjects to reside at these islands, so long as they conformed to the laws, as established by treaty of Lord Edward Russell. This latter they endeavoured to reject \u2014 indeed refused to acknowledge. The discussion on the merits of the case of Messrs. Short and Bachelot continued until four, when all parties being ex hausted, the king proposed an adjournment until the following morning. The only object carried was the consent that Messrs. Short and Bachelot should remain unmo lested until they could be removed, on the gua rantees respectively of Captain Thouars and myself. The meeting was then adjourned. The discussion was resumed on the morrow at ten, and before tw*o we had concluded by gaining their consent to the unmolested residence of Messrs. Bachelot and Short, until a favourable opportunity offered for their reaching some civilised portion of the globe, and that no further molestation should be offered the Clementine. I then presented the claims of the owner for demurrage and other expenses."], [109, "1837.] 59 INTERVIEW WITH THE KING. Before signing the documents, the king requested a private interview in the evening, when I remained with him from seven until ten, discussing quietly the line of conduct he should pursue, and what the civi lised world expected of him \u2014 reading frequent ex tracts from Vattel, which I sent for to confirm him. As I gave him to understand that I would not quit the port until I had a definitive answer for my government, relative to the disputed clause in Lord Edward Russell's treaty, he immediately consented to adopt my reading, and signed a copy that evening, promising another in Hawaian on the morrow. He protested strongly against the charge of having forcibly taken the Clementine. He expressed himself \" very much indebted for this visit of kindness,\" and observed, \" If I had one who would advise me as you do, occasionally, I should not get into so many scrapes.\" We parted on the best of terms. I was escorted home by the officer of the guard and two soldiers, the Governor Kuanoa, and two lanthorns. This escort possibly prevented mischief, as, near the fort, we encountered a native with a musket, in a very suspicious attitude. The officer of the guard struck him full in tbe face, and he darted off in the direction of the fort. It has been surmised that foul play was intended. The fact of sending the guard, &c, was somewhat suspicious, although it did not occur to me until the following* day, when I was told it was their intention to destroy me."], [110, "60 [1837. DEPARTURE FROM HONULULU. On the following day I sent a letter to his majesty, acquainting him that the question touching the insult to the flag would remain for the commodore to dispose of, as well as the damages done to the owner of the Clementine. At the same time I sent a formal instrument for his signature, agreeing to the full reading of the treaty entered into with Lord Edward Russell, and further engaging to grant a fair trial, &c, before the usual prerogative of majesty was exerted against any British subject. This was completed in due form, and returned with an Hawaian copy. The Starling had been despatched the previous day to Atooi, (Taui,) and by four o'clock, our affairs being settled satisfactorily, we embarked the Consul and family, and quitted the Port of Honolulu. As the Venus had saluted our flag, I thought it as Avell to give them a cordial parting cheer, and for this end gave her a pretty close shave. The cheer was heartily responded to by our French friends, the national colours of the French at our main, and the union at that of the Venus. Before sunset we noticed her get under weigh, and depart for Kamt schatka, Nootka, and Monterey. At two the day following we were anchored in the snug bay of Hanalae, on the N.W. side of the island of Atooi. Here we found the Starling* had arrived a few hours before us. These were the two first British vessels of war which had entered the port."], [111, "; !"], [112, ""], [113, "1837.] 61 HANALAE ATOOI. Our object in coming hither was to embark bullocks, which, we were assured, were better and cheaper than at Oahu ; and we were fully repaid for the trouble ; we obtained noble animals, and meat as fine as in England. During our detention, the survey of the bay was completed. At four, on the 27th, we took our de parture for the north, taking leave of civilized society for some months. Hanalae, besides beef and ve getables of the finest quality, furnishes fruits, poultry, turkeys, &c, cheap and in abundance. Water can be filled in the boats, by sending them into the river. I shall now return to Oahu, and compare it with what we left it in 1827, just ten years before. On the first glance I thought it had retrograded. The appearance of the natives was miserable and dirty; their features apparently coarser, and that brightness of eye and independence of carriage which freedom alone can exhibit, were decidedly wanting. The habit of frequent bathing, which constituted half their original existence, is entirely exploded, and not one good trait or feature by which former navigators have described them can be traced ! The substitution of the mud brick, or adobe of the continent, for their former neat wooden paling, gives the town a most gloomy aspect, and adds a dirty cast, independent of the actual nuisance arising from the clouds of dust which dry weather and strong sea breezes bring to your house, resulting from the constant destruction of the adobes."], [114, "[1837* 62 NATIVE POPULATION. The native population has decreased in a degree exceeding ordinary calculation, whilst that of the foreign residents has increased in the same propor tion. In 1827, with the exception of the Consul's family and the missionary ladies, not a foreign female could be found. At a ball given during our visit no less than twenty couple stood up. Some ladies then were absent from illness, and those of the missionary families could not be expected to attend such sinful pastime. No apparent change has taken place in the cul tivation of the land ; they are still in the same state of idleness as to their own affairs. They cannot cultivate their land, because their labour is demanded for the church, the missionaries having obtained the necessary edict which compels the natives to labour on the reefs, to procure blocks of stone for the purpose of building a new church. The first duty, of obtain ing subsistence for their families, was deemed but a secondary consideration. If they presumed to do so on Sunday their punishment was double labour the ensuing week. Even the servants of the foreign residents were interfered with, and arbitrarily marched off. This state of things could not exist long ; great discontent was manifested by all parties, and it pro bably would have proceeded to some decisive act, had it not been \" considered advisable to suspend operations for one year.\" At Tahiti the natives are compelled to frequent"], [115, "63 1837.] PORT CHARGES. the church. Here the attendance may be avoided, but \" you shall build one of stone.\" What, it will be asked, is this amount of labour ? To cut a block of compact coral limestone from the reef, about three feet long, two wide, and one deep, at low water, and transport it to the shore \u2014 say half a mile. The houses of the foreign residents are conside rably improved ; shops are more numerous and well supplied, and several of them are kept by Chinese. The chiefs and upper classes are better clothed, and appear as if they Were accustomed to dress properly. Of course the grog shops, bowling ground, billiard rooms, &c, have increased in proportion. The port, however, is less frequented by whalers, in consequence of their stubbornness in maintaining a ridiculously high port charge. Atooi, where the port dues are evaded, is rapidly seducing the old hands from this port, which, indeed, they do not enter but to refit. I endeavoured to point out this mistake to the king, but his reply was, that the port was in the hands of Kinau \u2014 or, in other words, ruled by the missionaries. If the king and chiefs continue their present course, this island will never improve, but for the benefit of the foreign residents. The Bonin groupe, I am told, is rapidly improving in settlers and importance. It is encouraged, I believe, by our Consul here. If any legal authority existed there, I have little doubt but half the trade"], [116, "[1837. 64 VIEWS OF THE KING. of the whalers would be taken from hence, and would aid in establishing the Bonins. The king and chiefs appear to desire to act in conformity with the established customs of civilized communities, but are led astray by bad advice, which, in the absence of those supposed to be empowered to advise them, they consider themselves bound to adhere to. I found this observation particularly on what escaped from the king. He appears at all times anxious for the advice and support of Great Britain, and asked \" if another lord would come out to settle this affair?\" or \"who would come to advise him?\" He asked many questions ; listened eagerly to every suggestion calculated to avert any future misunder standing between our governments ; and, so con vinced was I of his sincerity, that, although my success was more than doubted by all about me, I sent a written document by my first lieutenant, stipulating for his consent in toto to my wishes re lative to the disputed article of the treaty, and an engagement on his part not to exert the undoubted right of a sovereign power against a British subject, without due notice to our Consul, and satisfactory reasons to the government ; and this document he duly signed without comment, at the very instant of departure. I much regret that I had not an oppor tunity of paying him my last adieus, after his very decided courtesy towards me."], [117, "1837.] 65 SCHOOL AT OAHU. Amongst the improvements, and one of the greatest importance to the future welfare of Oahu, or of these islands generally, I must not omit to mention with the warmest approbation the school for the chil dren of mixed parents, where they are instructed not only in all the branches of British charity edu cation, but also in the English language. I was astonished at their proficiency. This school is sup ported by voluntary contributions of the white re sidents, and those frequenting the port, and is under the especial supervision of the ladies resident \u2014 par ticularly of the Consul's family. Some of the specimens of needlework exibited to tempt our patronage were beautiful. These were the productions of children not exceeding eight years of age. The example of these children at some future period will, it is to be hoped, materially tend to improve the society of Oahu. In the present state of missionary thraldom they cannot much longer continue. The introduction of a clergyman, and the ordinary course of devotion, must soon supersede the present system. Such a friend to advise the king would probably cure all the heart burnings which at present distract the community. His disposition is good, the people have ever been mild and amiable, or they would never have submitted to the yoke which galls them. The course they are at present pursuing is equally opposed to their feelings and their interests. The civilized world has from VOL. I. F"], [118, "[1837. 66 MISCHIEF OF THE MISSIONARIES. time to time been interested in their acts, by the prospect of a semibarbarous community rising into the rank of civilized society, and has extended the hand of friendship to assist in their elevation. G rcat Britain, France, and America, have completed treaties, and sent consuls to reside among them. But if repeated acts of outrage, fit only to be attributed to the dark ages from which they have but just emerged, continue to sully their flag, in which the British union is blended, then will they be hurled back from that footing, into the insignificance which their bad advisers and their consummate presumption will so richly merit. And should a vigorous exertion of power once be called for, then is their sun for ever set, and the flag of these islands, now so proudly but wantonly waving, may be confined to their own ports, as has been the case with San Domingo. Possibly it is not known that the flag of these islands has our union in the upper canton, with blue, red, and white stripes three times repeated. At Lahaina (Maui) a college is founded, of which Mr. Andrews is Principal. From specimens I have examined of their progress in engraving, (charts, and I believe those of the Sandwich Islands are in pro gress) their proficiency is very creditable ; and from what I saw of Mr. Andrews himself, who interpreted for me at the interview with the king, I had reason to admire him. To return to Hanalae : at the present season the anchorage is safe, but when the N.W. gales blow, a"], [119, "1837.] HANALAE. 67 very heavy sea must tumble into the bay. I am informed that a Russian store-ship rode out the season in spite of everything. The anchorage is pretty well covered by a spit, over which there is about nine feet ; but there is not sufficient space in bad weather for more than three vessels, although in the present fine season the bay is spacious. The landing is within the mouth of a small river, which carries, for a considerable distance up, from one to three quarters of a fathom, into fresh water, and is further navigable for boats or canoes (drawing three feet) several miles. The scenery is beautiful, and my surprise is that such a favourable situation should so long have been overlooked. The Consul possesses a tract of land on which his tenant (Kellett, an Englishman) feeds cattle, makes butter, cheese, and farms to great advantage. I am certain that our men derived more nourishment from the cattle we embarked there than from any previous diet, and contrary to the general feeling, preferred it to salt, regretting its loss. I would therefore strongly advise ships of war to sacrifice much to secure these advantages. Our attention was now directed to a very different scene. Hitherto we had enjoyed the balmy airs of the tropics, seldom too warm, never oppressive. We were no longer to bask in sunshine, but to meet the chilling blasts from Mount St. Elias, the position of which our orders required us to fix, as F 2"], [120, "[1837. 68 ROSE ISLAND. well as to verify generally the principal longitudes of Vancouver. Our progress northward was tedious and uninte resting. On the 17th August, the Starling was de spatched to Port Mulgrave, to make the necessary observations for fixing the position of Mount St. Elias, which I suspected might not be seen clearly every day, and therefore might cause us detention. Our course was directed northerly, wherever she could fetch, Port Chalmers, Etches, or Wingham Island. On the 21st, with light airs at noon, we expected to see Montague Island; but the current having driven us much to leeward of our reckoning, we determined on seeking Rose Island, or the nearest spot on which I could secure our meridian distance. About five, Rose or Middleton Island was plainly discerned, which put an end to our constant excite ment by the frequent reports of land which proved to be only clouds. At nearly dusk, breakers were observed between the point we were steering for and the ship ; a breaker curled close to our lee-beam ; the lead giv ing fifteen fathoms, previous cast forty-four ; hauled off into forty-five. It being calm we drifted during the night to the south-east, and at six the following morning an chored in twenty-one fathoms. Accompanied by Mr. Hinds, assistant-surgeon, I landed to determine"], [121, "1837.] 69 ROSE ISLAND. the position, but drizzling rain frustrated this object, and the setting in, forbidding all further prospect for the day, compelled us to embark. The island, which does not exceed thirty feet in height, is a very soft spongy soil, on a slaty micacious schale, intersected by quartz dykes. A few fuci, land shells adhering to ferns, and three small alca, comprised our collection. The ripples I had ob served were found to arise from ledges of rock, on which as little as two fathoms was found. The tide was ascertained to set \u2014 flood, north-east, \u2014 ebb, south-west. Strong moanings, or rushes on the surface, inti mated that we should have sufficient wind; however, before weighing I determined on trying what the bottom would afford, and succeeded in hooking three fine halibut, two of which I secured ; one weighing a hundred and forty-six pounds, was given to the crew, the other divided amongst the officers. Shortly after five we weighed with the breeze strong from the northward, and a heavy swell from the eastward ; the wind veering enabled us to shape a course for Port Etches, which we now had a pros pect of reaching easily, but not before dark. At nine we observed the aurora for the first time. The corruscations were all very brilliant, but instead of broad masses of wavy lambent light, it exhibited chiefly sharp rays shooting to the zenith, from E.N.E. to N.W. The stars clearly visible, with diminution of light."], [122, "70 [1837. SNOW-CAPPED PINNACLES. At dawn, the snowy ranges of mountains from the termination of Montague Island as far as Cape Suckling, or in the direction of Kaye's Island, were entirely free from clouds or vapours, a sight not common in these regions, and generally a warning for bad weather. As the sun rose, our attention was anxiously directed to witness the effect of its rays on the innumerable snow-capped pinnacles, which this splendid range presented, each, even the lowest, an object of interest, compared with our late scenery. We were, however, disappointed; their obliquity, added to the faces being to the S.W., pre vented the effect we anticipated. It Mas, however, accomplished at sunset. Light baffling airs, with oppressively hot sun, kept teazing us until after noon, when we appeared to move but tardily towards the passage between Montague and Hinchinbrook Islands, where I was prepared to expect strong tides. About eight we had doubled the Cape, and a gig was sent to exa mine the coast ; but shoal water, contrary to Van couver's idea, rendered it necessary to anchor in seventeen fathoms. The tide ran at the rate of three knots, but not sufficiently strong to cause me any uneasiness. The boat returned Avithout informa tion; we therefore remained quiet for the night. Several fine fish were caught. At four we weighed, and followed the gig sent ahead to point out the entrance to the port.

About nine we anchored at the mouth of the small entrance to the inner harbour, in seven fa thoms ; pretty nearly in the position mentioned by Vancouver. The weather immediately became threatening, blew very hard, brought one anchor home, and com pelled us to let go the second. We were visited by the Russian residents, who betrayed some little alarm at our arrival, and at one time I thought would have retired. The stay of the principal was short, but he returned after we anchored, enveloped in his waterproof cloak, formed of the small intestines of the seal, and endea voured to persuade us to enter the inner harbour. This I certainly would have done, had I purposed remaining long. The day continued pouring with rain, debarring any* kind of occupation or amuse ment. The day following the wind subsided, but con tinued from the same quarter, with frequent showers. I called on the Russian resident, who evidently had made some preparation to receive me, so far as hot water and a clean table-cloth were concerned, but the prevailing odour was that of seal-oil. He regretted that he had nothing to present to me but a tanned skin dress, embroidered by the natives of the Aleutian islands, precisely similar to those"], [124, "72 [1837. FUR ESTABLISHMENTS. which we obtained at Avatcha, and one or two baskets. As I was well aware of the exact mean ing of this attention, I did not hesitate in receiving it, particularly as I had brought with me presents of tea, sugar, and other comforts. He then took me through the fish and oil esta blishment, which was inches deep in hardened filth and seal-oil ; and thence to the room containing peltry. I was much disappointed at the quality of the furs. They comprised sea-otter, sable, rat, squirrel, fox, wolf, bear, seal, and beaver, very large and heavy. The only desirable skins were those of the sea-otter and sable, and they were not first-rate. As it is strictly forbidden to sell anything, and our visit bound us in honour not to permit anything of the sort, I felt little inclination to remain in this valuable repository, This establishment of the Imperial Russian Fur Company consists of the official resident, eight Russians, and fifty Aleutian and other allies. The houses are included in a substantial wooden quad rangle, furnished at its sea angles with .two octa gonal turrets, capped in the old English style, and pierced with loop-holes and ports ; the summits of the lines are armed with spikes of wood. It is cal culated to sustain a tolerable siege, under deter mined hands. The sleeping apartments, or \" 'tween decks,\" as we should term them, are desperately filthy. The whole range is warmed by Dutch-ovens, and the sides being eighteen inches in thickness, are"], [125, "1837.] 73 GARDEN ISLAND. well-calculated to withstand the cold, as well as to defy musketry. The native allies, who live in huts outside, are filthier than any Esquimaux ; arising, doubtless, from their life of inactivity, resulting from doubtful dependence. On my return to the ship, I found that a boat-load of salmon had been sent, which af forded the crew a fresh meal, of a pound and a half of salmon per man. A survey of the port was effected, malgre the un favourable state of the weather, and our astronomi cal and magnetic observations were secured. I had completed my observations at a small island which I had selected for a station, but was at a loss for a mark, and had directed a tree near me, which was deprived of bark, to be felled for this purpose. I had barely time to arrest the sacrilegious order on perceiving letters on its sides, and easily traced PORT ETCHES. SHIP KING GEORGE. NATH. PORTLOCK, COMMR. JULY 22, 1787. On my return on board, I found in Mavor's edition of Portlock and Dixon's Voyage, Portlock notices having trimmed and marked a tree on Garden island in this manner. At present the island is covered with pine trees : we could not trace any remains of plants differing from those on the nearest land. The surface of the Garden must have been very small, nor did the grass and mould in any part exceed six inches in depth."], [126, "[1837; 74 PORT ETCHES. On the side of the bay within, where he had his tents, a species of wild grain was noticed, and a large spot free from trees. It was gratifying, however, thus to meet some token of our adventurous countrymen, even in such an inhospitable clime ; a sensation only to be appreciated by wanderers like ourselves. AVe found strawberries, whortleberries, blaeberries (arbutus), pigeonberries, and a small cranberry, in tolerable profusion, without going in search of them. On Wednesday, the 30th August, we prepared for sea, and took on board spars and firewood. I paid my final visit to the Resident, leaving him a further supply of comforts, for which he evinced much gratitude. About two we weighed and beat out, the fort saluting as we passed. Port Etches might furnish a most complete har bour, if vessels frequented these regions, or a station should ever be required in so high a latitude. The currents, however, between it and Montague Island, render it difficult of approach in light winds, and the Russian informed me that many sunken rocks lie off Cape Hinchinbroke. But as they designate a rock over which there may be ten or fifteen fathoms, a sunken rock, they probably allude to danger to ground tackle. It was on one of these ledges that we anchored in seventeen fathoms, and on tripping had twelve before clearing the rocks. The result of our -observations at this port gives"], [127, "1837.] 75 ERROR OF VANCOUVER. Vancouver in error nearly to the amount which he ascribes to Cook. Finding ourselves becalmed near the flat island mentioned by Vancouver, and wishing to verify its position, I started in my gig for this purpose, but had not proceeded far when a light favourable air brought me back : all sail was crowded for Cape Hammond, which was rounded at midnight. I had been running my eye over Vancouver, and noticed the difficulty he described in getting round this cape, by reason of an adverse current ; other wise I had fully intended to anchor within Wing ham Island, and endeavour to intersect Mount St. Elias from thence, as well as rectify the errors in that neighbourhood. But time was now too pre cious, and the ensuing morn proved that my deter mination had been judicious, as we had gloomy weather, no sun, light wind, and could scarcely stem the current. All our transit bearings and other observations, plainly indicated the charts to be erroneous about this region. A river appears to flow near Cape Suckling, which has not been noticed. Our attention was suddenly attracted by the very peculiar outline of ridge in profile, which one of our draughtsmen was sketching, apparently toothed. On examining it closely with a telescope, I found, that although the surface presented to the naked eye a comparatively even outline, that it was actually one mass of small four-sided truncated pyramids."], [128, "[1837. 76 SINGULAR SIGHT. resembling salt-water mud which has been exposed several days to the rays of a tropical sun, (as in tropical salt marshes,) or an immense collection of huts. For some time we were lost in conjecture, pro bably from the dark ash colour. But our attention being drawn to nearer objects, and the sun lending his aid, we found the whole slope, from ridge to base, similarly composed ; and as the rays played on those near the beach, the brilliant illumination distinctly showed them to be ice. We were divided between admiration and astonishment. What cause would produce those special forms? If one could fancy himself perched on an eminence, about five hun dred feet above a city of snow-white pyramidal houses, with smoke-coloured flat roofs covering many square miles of surface, and rising ridge above ridge in ste* is, he might form some faint idea of this beautiful freak of nature. APPEARANCE OF ICE."], [129, "1837.] CAPE SUCKLING. 77 Kaye's Island, viewed from the eastward, presents the appearance of two islands. The southern is a high table-rock, free from trees or vegetation, and of a whitish hue ; the other is moderately high land for this region, with three bare peaks ; its lower region being well-wooded. Wingham Island, which can be seen to nearly its whole length between Cape Suckling and Point Le Mesurier, (the north part of Kaye's Island,) is mo derately elevated, rising in three hummocks, which are bare on their summits. The southern at a dis tance, owing to the lowness of the neck, appears separated. The whole is well clothed with trees. In one direction from the southward, Cape Suck ling exhibits on its bower profile, the brow, nose, and lijjs of a man. It is a low neck, stretching out from a mountainous isolated ridge, which terminates about three miles from it easterly, where the flats of the ice pyramids just alluded to terminate. Ap parently the river or opening near Cape Suckling flows round its base. There is little doubt but that we may attribute the current to this outlet, arising probably from the melting of the snow. We had less strength of current after passing this position. Immense piles of drift-wood were noticed on each side of the opening, but none elseivhere. Floating trees of considerable magnitude were numerous, and one sufficiently interesting to cause its admeasure ment by sextant, which afforded two hundred feet as its probable length. Current northerly. Water,"], [130, "[1837. 78 MOUNT ST. F.LIAS. within three miles of the land, whitish, showing a distinct division, doubtless snow-water and mud. We continued to be teazed with light variable airs and strong currents, and on Monday, the 4th September, finding the wind failing. I determined on keeping in small water, so as to be able to anchor, Mount St. Elias being then within fair distance. About eight we anchored in fifty fathoms, mud ; the day beautifully fine, horizon well defined, and our position as perfect as could be wished for our obser vations, all of which were obtained, and satisfactory. The current was found to set one mile and a half per hour west, varying but slightly in force, and not at all in direction. At this position, not a single drift tree was noticed. We were within the whitewater about two miles, whichlamnow satisfied flows from the ice. But why it preserves its uni formity of strength and direction, is yet a problem to be solved. On the morning following it was cloudy, with rain, and the breeze springing up compelled us to trip. Towards the evening it cleared up, and we were treated with a most splendid picture of St. Elias and all the neighbouring peaks, in full beauty, not a vapour near them. Each range is in itself an object worthy of the pencil, but with the stupendous, proud St. Elias towering above all, they dwindled into mere hillocks, or into a most splendid base on which to place his saintship. Although Vancouver describes St. Elias as \" in re-"], [131, ".Ion. .Henry C alburn, Great Marlbro Si 18"], [132, ""], [133, "1837.] 79 ICY BAY. a- gions of eternal snow,\" yet his edges, to the very sum- mit, present a few black wrinkles, and the depth of snow does not, even in the drifts, appear to be very deep. My anxiety to reach Point Riou and obtain ob servations on it, induced me to hold on by the land. Indeed there was no other chance of overcoming the current. The coast presents so little to recognise in Vancouver's chart, that I despair of doing more than fixing the position of Mount St. Elias, which, if Kellett has been successful in seeing from Port Mul grave, will be now secure. Towards noon the breeze favoured us sufficiently to reach into Icy Bay, very aptly so named, as Vancouver's Point Riou must have dissolved, as well as the small island also mentioned, and on Avhich I had long set my heart as one of my principal posi tions. At noon we tacked in ten fathoms, mud, having passed through a quantity of small ice, all of a soft nature. The whole of this bay, and the valley above it, was now found to be composed of (appa rently) snow ice, about thirty feet in height at the water cliff, and probably based on a low muddy beach ; the water for some distance in contact not even showing a ripple ; which, it occurred to me, arose from being charged with floating vegetable matter, probably fine bark, &c. The small bergs or reft masses of ice, forming the cliffy outlines of the bay, were veined and varie gated by mud streaks like marble, and where they"], [134, "[ 1 837. 80 POINT RIOU. bad been exposed to the sea, were excavated into arches, &c, similar to some of our chalk forma tions. The base of the point, named by Vancouver Point Riou, probably remains; but being free, for some distance, of the greater bergs, it presented only a low sand or muddy spit, with ragged dirty coloured ice grounded. No island could be traced, and our interest was too deeply excited in seeking for it, to overlook such a desirable object. On our inshore tack we had five fathoms and three quarters, and were therefore quite close enough to make certain of our remarks, short of actual contact, which the favourable breeze would not admit of without some more important results. We edged along, keeping within a mile and a half of the shore, carrying from ten to fifteen fathoms, until night, when we bore away to cross Beering's Bay, and rejoin our consort in Port Mulgrave. I perceive in Vancouver, (vol. iii. p. 204,) twenty three fathoms was his nearest approach, and within one league. He also terms it \" low, well-wooded, with a small detached islet, a little to the westward.\" Also, \" Eastward from the steep cliffs that terminate this bay, and from whence the ice descends into the sea.\" It is very probable there has been a misreading of his manuscript, or that severer wea ther had covered his trees with ice, for we saw none, and that portion of the coast was examined with his voyage constantly before me, and the discre pancies discussed with our spy-glasses on the objects."], [135, "1837.] 81 SINGULAR ICE FORMATION. Our observations and speculations, on the motion of the ice now before us, led us to suspect that the whole of the lower body is subject to slide, and that the whole of the substratum, as frequently found within the Arctic Circle, is a slippery mud. I am satisfied that this is the case in Icy Bay, as one berg, which was well up on the shore, moved off to seaward ; grounding again near what I took for Point Riou. This leads me back to our observations on the mathematical forms observed on the 3rd, after passing Bingham Island, and I perceive that Van couver notices not only the ice, but (at p. 209, 210, vol. iii.) attempts to account for its formation, re marking that the ice observed (before reaching Point Riou and to the southward) was not so clean, \" most of them appearing to be dirty.\" How came they so ? If the dark, \" dirty \" ice had been near the beach, it could readily be accounted for, by having been agitated with the beach mud, and forced up by gales. But the reverse is the fact. The darker ice was on the high ridges, and the bright near the sea. Only the theory of a slip would allow of its moving down the inclined plane without disturbing its mathema tical arrangement. Vancouver's visit occurred in the latter end of June, ours in the early part of September. In Icy Bay, the apparently descending ice from the mountains to the base was in irregular, broken VOL. I.

But near Cape Suckling the inclination of the steps was very slight, and apparently bad subsided perpendi cularly for many miles in gradation. The forms observed will best be illustrated by the sketch. (Vide plate and woodcut.) By night we had a confirmed fair wind, a relief of no small moment bodily, as well as mentally, for anxiety most decidedly deadens the faculties ; and I was anything but easy respecting the Starling, as from Kellett's sanguine temperament he might think our protracted absence imported accident, and starting to seek us, might miss us for some time. On the morning of the 7th we had sighted the land near Cape Phipps, and found that we had been driven much to the westward by the current. Fortunately I was prepared for this, and hauled up until I brought Mount Fairweather over Cape Turner, which the chart showed to be a good leading mark (or N. 88\u00b0 E.) for the entrance. We were even in doubt on opening the mouth of the port, which appeared like a cluster of islands. However, I knew, if she was within, that a gun would soon bring some signal in return, and was not de ceived, as the smoke of the Starling's reply soon curled over the points. Being sure of our mark, we bore up for the anchorage, passing from sound ings at sixty fathoms suddenly into thirteen and"], [137, "1837.] 83 PORT MULGRAVE. eight, and as suddenly deepening again to forty, until reaching the ledge off Cape Turner, when it exceeded the length of our handlines. The observations in Vancouver were sufficient to have taken us in, but we picked up Kellett off Cape Turner, and instantly availed ourselves of his later examination of the port. We took up our berth close round the low gravelly point of the island, in thirteen fathoms, within three hundred yards of the beach. The Starling had only arrived three days before us, having been, like ourselves, delayed nine days by currents and baffling winds. The day was sufficiently fine to enable me to secure all the requisite observa tions for latitude, time, astronomical bearings, and altitudes of St. Elias and Fairweather, as well as magnetic details. The principal chief of this tribe, Anoutchy, paid his visit of ceremony, accompanied by his lady. Better specimens of the improved state of the Indians I have not seen. Both were clean, and well-dressed; the chief by the aid of an old coat and trowsers bestowed on him by Kellett ; and his lady in a dark-coloured cotton gown with blue and scarlet cloak, a la robe, over all. He had assumed the name of Iwan Iwatsky, probably in compli ment to one of the Russian traders, who frequently visit this port. Their manners were good, even in some degree polished; and although not particularly well-bred g 2"], [138, "[1837. 84 NATIVE CHIEF. at table, they were evidently not unacquainted with the use of knife, fork, and plate. It was a very gratifying sight to observe such a change amongst such a set as we found them asso ciated with, even comparing them with their com peers (as chiefs). A NATIVE CHIEF OF PORT MULGRAVE Kellett acquainted me that this chief possessed very high notions of territorial right, and had thrown difficulties in the way of wooding and watering, which he was glad that our presence would remove. Having given him a few presents, and intimated"], [139, "85 1837.] NATIVE PRODUCTIONS. my intention of adding to them at my departure, he was well pleased, and retired to the shore. On the first arrival of the Starling, but few canoes had appeared ; these nearly doubled daily, until his position called for a vigilance which was unpleasant, and made them comparatively prisoners. Our presents having allayed every unpleasant feeling, the utmost security was felt, so as to admit of full range to sportsmen and naturalists. One peculiarity which I noticed in this tribe, is the manner in which they receive presents \u2014 as a due, not as a gift ; and consequently no return is made for civility. They have probably had a lesson from their friends the fur-dealers, whose maxim is \" nothing for nothing.\" Excepting in traffic, at which they are very keen, nothing could be ob tained. Fish, halibut and salmon of two kinds, were abundant and moderate, of which the crews purchased and cured great quantities. Game very scarce ; one goose and a small blue-winged duck were all the birds that were brought for sale. The remains of Russian establishments were observed ; a block house perched on a cliff on the east side ; and on the low point, where our astronomical observations were taken, the ruins of another ; also a staff, with a vane and cross over a grave. Strawberry plants were very numerous, but the ladies had cleared them of fruit, and were busied \u2022luring the day procuring supplies of these and other"], [140, "86 1837 NATIVE ORNAMENTS. berries from the main, which, with salmon, appear to constitute their chief food. Although many seal-skins were noticed, I did not observe this or animal food amongst them. Deer is said to abound, but on asking for it, they pointed to and named Sitka (in Norfolk Sound) and Nootka. Their implements of chase are far inferior to those in use amongst the Esquimaux or Aleutians. The men are wretchedly clothed, in mats woven with the inner bark of the cypress, which is tough, iii xible, and very soft. The women are very similar to the Esquimaux, differing however in the mouth ornament, which is here worn in an aperture under WOMAN WITH MOUTH-PIECE"], [141, "1837.] THE CHIEF'S FAMILY. 87 the lower lip. It is of wood, and retains its place by the elasticity of the flesh contracting in the groove, substituting larger ornaments as they grow up, or as the aperture elongates. They are as filthy as such tribes usually are, beyond description, and use vermillion, and any paint they can get. I must, however, except the chief's lady and daughters, as not wearing these ornaments, or paint, and ex hibiting a dislike to it. The latter I had not the pleasure of seeing, but I am told one is very pretty, \u2014 I suppose we may add, \" for the tribe.\" On the 8th October, after completing our astro nomical observations, and swinging the ship for local attraction, we took leave of our friends, and with great difficulty got up our anchor, owing to the tough clay in which it had hooked. Light airs pre vented our getting out, although towed by the canoes as well as our own boats ; I therefore turned her head to her old anchorage for the night. The chief and his lady, who had come to secure the as sistance of their tribe, as soon as they perceived my determination, were quite delighted, \u2014 the only time I had seen them relax their features, \u2014 and haran guing the canoes, particularly her ladyship, they not only increased in numbers, but also in efforts, which had they applied earlier, we should have gained an offing.

About six the following morning a breeze enabled us to get out. We were visited by the greater part of the canoes ; but the chief and his lady, who had taken tea with us, and finished by asking for a little warm gin and water, were probably too sleepy to pay us a visit at this early hour. , About nine the breeze giving us too great a velo city for the canoes, and their saleable articles being expended, one by one they gradually dropped off' and left us to pursue our course. We found some difficulty in gaining a fair offing, and stood in until the last moment of daylight, in order to ensure a long tack after eight p.m. \u00a9 \u00a9 At half-past seven I left the deck, after the deep sea cast was giA*en \" no bottom ;\" but I was not quite satisfied that I ought to credit it. However, as I had great objections to discuss the matter with the mate in charge of the watch, I thought possibly that the next cast he would be more atten tive. I had hardly been seated in my cabin five minutes, when breakers ahead and under the lee were reported, and the first lieutenant being on deck, relieved him from charge, and prepared for putting her about.

She did not perceive or did not answer, and my anxiety during the night Avas great. But trusting to the tried caution of Kellett, I felt easier for the Starling than if she had been in other hands.

I despatched Lieutenant Collinson to Bird Island, in order to secure the latitude and longitude during the present favourable Aveather. He Avas soon joined by Kellett. About three the breeze enabled us to lay up for the centre channel, the houses, citadel, and flags of Sitka showing very distinctly. About half-past three we were visited by the Governor's secretary, Mr. Alexander, in a caiack, Avith the customary string of boarding questions answered by merchant vessels ; but finding, as they had imagined, a ship of-war, these were laid aside, and a note containing the principal points of interest forwarded by the caiack. The pilot having arrived, Ave beat into the channel, where, the breeze failing, we resorted to toAving, aided by the Governor's barge and other boats sent to our assistance; a practice quite in dispensable here, where nine vessels out of ten are forced to toAv in or out. The Governor had also despatched his lieutenant-aide, who directed in per son the exertions of the Russians, and did not quit us until dark, when, unable to stem the tide, we dropped anchor about tAvo miles from the Fort. The aide-de-camp then accompanied me in my gig to call on the Governor, Captain Koupreanoff, formerly commanding the Azof, seventy-four, in the Black Sea, aa*1io received me in the warmest man ner, and tendered all the facilities AA*hich the port or arsenal could afford ; at the same time, to put me"], [148, "[ \\K)7. 94 RUSSIAN FUR ESTABLISHMENT. quite at case in following up the objects of the ex pedition, he requested I would consider myself quite at home, and make my OAvn arrangements as to the selection of a site for my observatory or any other pursuits. He speaks English well, and with true English feeling acted up to all he professed ; indeed, his civilities were overpowering. The Sul phur is the first foreign vessel of war that has visited this colony. Having warped the ship to within a cable's length of the arsenal, the observatory Avas landed on an island opposite, and we had the good fortune to obtain complete sights, and secure our meridian before midnight. The natives visited us, bringing salmon, &c, and some feAV skins, but the Governor having most kindly supplied us Avith more of the former than Ave could consume, and any traffic in the latter being expressly against the laws of the colony in AA'hich we were guests, I considered it prudent, and Avhat courtesy demanded, that traffic on board or at the observatory should be tabooed. This soon shortened the numbers of hangers on, whose princi pal object is generally to note the nakedness of the land, and aid in depredations at night. Independent of this, as the Governor informed me, that even in his time, two years, their fortress had been threatened, and that, although seven hundred only were now in our neighbourhood, seven thou sand might arriA'e in a few hours, I deemed it pru dent to keep them as much aloof as our sentinels,"], [149, "1837.] 95 THE FORTIFICATIONS. Avithout resorting to strong measures, could effect. At the same time, as our boats would be engaged in the examination of the sound during our stay, it became necessary to preserve an amicable feeling so long as they conducted themselves quietly. The establishment at Sitka is situated on a broad flat delta, on the outer rocky peninsula of which the fortress, Avhich is now rebuilding, stands. It is about sixty feet above the sea-level, and completely commands all the anchorages in the immediate neighbourhood, as well as the peninsula. The inner line, which traverses the longest base of this delta, is protected by a heaA'y line of picketted logs, tAventy five feet in height, surmounted en cheveux de frise, and flanked at the angles, Avithin musket-shot of each other, by small block-house redoubts, loopholed and furnished with small guns and swivels. It ex tends from the sea in three fathoms, about one mile through to the riA*er. This cuts off all con nexion Avith the natives, but through a portcullis door, admitting into a railed yard those bringing goods to market. This door is closely watched by two or three guards, who, upon the least noise or dispute in the market, drop the portcullis, and pro ceed summarily Avith the delinquents. As the traffic is generally conducted by women and children, and the Russians moreover employ female spies in the camp, they are always Avell warned, and fully prepared for any act of treachery. They have also a party of their allies, (slaves ?) the"], [150, "96 [1837. THE ARSENAL.

The present very substantial house erecting for the GoA*ernor and his establishment, is about one hundred and forty feet in length, by seventy feet wide, of tAvo good stories, AA*ith lofts, capped by a lighthouse in the centre of the roof. The summit of the light is one hundred and ten feet above the sea-level, and commands a most extensive prospect. The building is of wood, solid ; some of the logs measuring seventy-six and eighty feet in length, and squaring one foot. They half dovetail over each other at the angles, and are treenailed together vertically. The roof is pitched, and covered with sheet iron. When complete, the fortifications (one side only of which at present remains) will comprise five sides, upon which forty pieces of cannon will be mounted, principally old ship guns, varying from twelve to twenty-four pounders. The buhvarks are of wood, and fitted similarly to the ports on the maindeck of a frigate. The arsenal, which is immediately under, on the low ground, is well-stored with cordage of every description, and of very superior quality. The cables and large rope come by sea, but the yarn, in packages of fifty-six pounds, is transported on mules through Siberia.

The saw-mills, which are worked by water, are about twenty miles distant, half way down the south side of the sound, at Les Sources, or warm springs, Avhich serves as a sort of HarroAvgate to the colony. Their most valuable wood is a very fine-grained bright-yellow cypress, of AA'hich they build boats, and export the plank in payment of debts contracted for supplies from the Sandwich Islands, (principally China and other goods.) They have a building slip, protected by a house, similar to those in our dock yards, and have, I am informed, built one very fine vessel. The establishment comprises that of a ship of the line, one captain, the governor; one commander, (lieutenant-governor ;) and lieutenants, masters, &c, according to the number of vessels employed. The total number is about eight hundred, but of these many, if not the greater part, are invalids ; but few able-bodied men were visible. Many, of course their picked men, were absent in their vessels, visiting the ports and collecting the furs, which were daily expected to arrive, \u2014 when the vessels are laid up, and they remain quiet until the spring. I visited every part of the establishment with the Governor, and although a man-of-war's man's ideas of cleanliness are perhaps occasionally acute, (and these people are yet a shade lower in civiliza tion by their intermarriage with the natives,) yet I VOL. I. H"], [154, "[1837. 98 THE CHURCH still witnessed comparative cleanliness and comfort, and much to admire, particularly in the school and hospital. In the latter, the name of the man, date of admission, and nature of disease, is placed over the bed of each patient, which in any contagious disease gives timely warning to any one fearing in fection. Not long since, the small-pox committed dreadful ravages amongst the Indians, and threatened to prove a still greater pestilence, by their neglect of their dead, and not unfrequently of the living, whom they quitted the moment they found them infected. The colony having arrived from the westward, brought their own Sunday ; consequently we were generally working on our opposite holidays, a mea sure I could only obviate by respecting their day of Avorship, and giving our men a holiday. To our ar tificers, who could not work at the dockyard on their Sabbath, this was a serious drawback, when we con sidered the short period of our stay. I visited their church, and witnessed the ceremony. The interior of the edifice is splendid, quite beyond conception in such a place as this. The padre, who officiated in his splendid robes, was a very powerful athletic man, about forty-five years of age, and stand ing in his boots (which appear to be part of his costume) about six feet three inches ; quite Her culean, and very clever. I took a very great liking to him, and Avas permitted to examine his workshop, in which I noticed a good barrel-organ, a baro-"], [155, "1837.] 99 ESTABLISHMENT. meter, and several other articles of his own manu facture. He Avas kind enough to volunteer his services on one or two of our sick barometers, and succeeded effectually. Notwithstanding he only spoke Russian, of which I knew nothing, we ma naged to become great allies. He has since been promoted and gone home. On their Sunday, all the officers of the establish ment, civil as well as military, dine at the Governor's. During the week the military meet at the mess daily at one. The dinner is soon discussed. They re assemble at five, take tea, and remain until supper, at ten or eleven, during which interval cards or billiards occupy their time. The attentions of the Governor and his establishment AA*ere kind in the extreme. The vessels in port were one ship, corvette-built, of four hundred and fifty tons, commanded by the Lieutenant-Governor, and tAvo brigs commanded by a lieutenant and a master. They belong to the \" Im perial Russo- American Fur Company,\" avIio are paid similarly to our troops employed in the service of the East India Company, retaining their rank, and their service time going on. We visited several stations in the sound, in order to determine the position of Mount Edgecumbe, the Cape, Pouce, and some of the mountains in the sound, in prosecution of a projected survey ; a party Avas also employed cutting Avood (cypress) intended for the construction of a new whale-boat. H 2"], [156, "100 [1837. VISIT OF CHIEFS. The chiefs having pestered the Governor to ask permission to visit the Sulphur, and glad on my part of an occasion to show that no unfriendly feel ing kept them away, I immediately consented to a nomination of the best characters, amounting to thirty-seven, which, Avith the addition of the Russian officers and ourselves, would form a pretty large party. They observed great ceremony in their approach, and Avere dressed in the most fantastic garb ima ginable, being generally painted with scores of ver million, in some instances not devoid of taste. Some had helmets of wood, carAred in imitation of frogs, seals, fish, or birds' heads. Others wore the very sensible plain conical hat * Avithout rim, Avhich serves effectually to ward off sun or rain ; and the generality wore, or carried with them, their native shaAvl, which is very laboriously worked into carpet figures, from the avooI of some animal \\A*hich I could not ascertain. One or two had cloaks of American sables, which were very handsome, but far inferior to those of Siberia. Most of the helmet party wore ermine skins, tied loosely about them, which I found were purchased at the factory, and are imported from Siberia (via Ochotsk) for traffic with the natives. I had an opportunity here, as well as at Port Etches, of viewing some of the skins, particularly the sea-otter, which they purchase from the natives, and * Used by Mandarins in China."], [157, "101 1837.] BARTER. Avas not a little surprised to find Iioav completely they have arrived at their standard value, which is a very high price. A moderately good sea-otter skin Avill fetch from six to seven blankets, increasing to thirteen for the best ; no bargain being conclusive Avithout sundry nicknacks, similar to the Chinese cumshaw. These generally may be estimated at one blanket, which should be worth twelve shillings here. In money they frequently ask forty dollars ; on the coast of California, at San Francisco, and Monterey, as much as eighty to a hundred. When offering objects for sale, they are very sulky if their tender is not responded to ; which in some measure accounts for the ill-humour experienced at Port Mulgrave, and which I am inclined to think Avould have terminated in hostility had I commenced purchases Avhich could not have been followed up. Upon very mature consideration of Avhat I have heard and seen respecting this subject, I think many of the unprovoked attacks Ave have heard of have originated in some transaction of this .nature \u2014 refusal to trade being deemed almost a declaration of war. Facts, however, which have been acknow ledged, prove that wanton malice has visited upon the next tribe the sins of their offending* neighbours. This accounts for the two extremes we notice \u2014 ex traordinary timidity Avhen they are the weaker, and overbearing impertinence Avhen they fancy them selves the more powerful party.

They were carved in grotesque figures, and remarkably AA-ell handled. After encircling the ship, singing, and gesticulating, as if she was to become a good prize, they at length came on board, and were severally presented by the Governor, \u2014 not omitting their vir tues or vice versd, when they possessed sufficient notoriety. I observed that those avIio had become (nominally) Christians were entitled to precedence, but no particular virtues were enumerated as their especial property.

On the 26th of September, having completed our observations, we embarked the observatory, and moved doAvn to the outer roads, in order to proceed to sea by a more direct channel. Before parting, the Governor gave an evening party and dance, to shoAv us the female society of Sitka. The evening passed most delightfully ; and although the ladies Avere almost self-taught, they acquitted themselves Avith all the ease, and I may add elegance, communi cated by European instruction. Although feAv could converse Avith their partners, they still contrived to get through the dance without the slightest diffi culty. Quadrilles and waltzing were kept up Avith great spirit, and I was not a little surprised to learn from our good friend and host, that many of the ladies then moving before us with easy and graceful air, had not an idea of dancing tAvelve months pre vious. I believe that the society is indebted prin cipally to the Governor's elegant and accomplished lady for much of this polish. This lady is of one of the first Russian families, and resembles the pictures of the empress. She accompanied her husband, enduring great hardships, through Siberia to Ochotsk on horseback or mules, in a most critical moment, in order to share with him the privations of this barbarous region.

Of these, Mount Edgecumbe, at the northern en trance, is three thousand one hundred and thirty feet above the sea-level, and is easily known by its denuded red stripes. The Pouce, immediately be hind the arsenal, is three thousand four hundred feet, and indicates the direction to which the vessel must be pushed for anchorage before dark.

There are many rocks nearly even with the Avater's edge, which by daylight may easily be avoided, but the distinct channels are not easily dis cerned by a stranger, even when assisted by the Russian chart.

The greatest distance between any two points does not exceed a quarter of a mile, and mostly rocky.

Her features were, however, more of the Chinese or Tartar breed, than those of the brother. Her manner was very simple and winning ; she had black expressive eyes ; and her affection for her father, on whom she often clung, with her head re posed on his shoulder, was quite a novel sight amongst these people. The son, as well as the daughter, appeared to receive all the respect due to high rank, even from the father, who invariably turned over his presents to them.

After their repast, presents were given to them, and notice given to retire. This I found not so easily effected, the father and son remaining ; and I Avas compelled to quit them, to pursue my duties on shore. I found them on my return still on board, and, from what I could ascertain from their signs, anxious to barter their furs. I endeavoured to make them comprehend that our supplies were not calculated for trade, nor beyond presents ; that I expected no return ; and further, that I would land in the evening, and show them fireworks, &c. At dusk I landed, taking with me a magic-lan thorn and supply of fireworks. At the former they all exhibited the most unfeigned delight, to a degree quite outrageous ; but at the ascent of the rockets, their impressions amounted to fear. I had several women grasping me by each hand, huddled into one groupe, and evidently trembling ; and, by the light from the fire, I could perceive the tears rolling down the cheeks of Macquilla's wife and daughter, who fled to the bush the instant the fireworks were over ; nor could they be persuaded to return, even to Avitness a second exhibition of the magic-lanthorn.

On the day following, I still found the chief in bad humour, and at length he despatched his fool or first aid, to know whether I intended to trade or not, as he was about to proceed immediately to Tasheis, his residence, some miles up the sound, \u2014 Nootka being merely a fishing station. Other natives observed in a marked manner, \" Macquilla go to Tasheis ;\" I therefore presumed that declining to trade became an insult ; and, as I wished to part on the best terms, I sent to assure him that I would see him again on board, the in stant I had completed my observations. I accord inly did so, purchased several skins, and accompanied him to the beach, where I enjoyed myself about ten minutes, witnessing the effect of his speech, de scribing our uniforms AA'hich he had seen, as well as his treatment on board. At each pause a complete yell issued from his myrmidons, which at times was anything but pleasant. I suppose it meant \" hear, hear,\" as amongst most cultivated assemblies else where. Macquilla is about fifty, five feet eight inches in height, his shoulders very square in proportion, and limbs exceedingly muscular. His countenance might assume any expression, from that of determined cou rage to that of the kindest and mildest feelings ; but not of fierceness. His complexion is whiter"], [168, "112 [1837 FEMALES. and smoother than usual. His superiority consists in a dignified, unobtrusive mildness of manner and de portment. His son appears to be between twenty-three and twenty-five years of age, and stands about five feet nine inches ; is fair, and possesses more knoAvledge than the father. His expression is mild. The daughter is apparently about fourteen or fif teen years old, and, like all the females of the north west coast, very short-limbed. Like her sex, she was desperately bent on ornaments, and had enough about her neck and wrists (although covered by her blanket) to set up a distinct trade. Unfortunately, I had none to bestoAv ; Government, or Captain Beechey, not having considered the ladies of sufficient importance, to provide the presents necessary for their gratification. This is bad policy, as their first demand is invariably for presents for the wives and children; and if they are not gratified, Ave well knoAV the result all the world over. The dress of the natives differs much from those to the northward. Their cloaks, which are circular capes with a hole in the centre, edged with sea-otter skin, are constructed from the inner bark of the cypress. It turns the rain, is very soft and pliable, and is in use for mats, sails, ropes, clothing, &c. ; the roofs of their houses are also covered with it. They make use of the dried fucus giganteus, anointed with oil, for lines, in taking salmon and sea-otters. The hook is baited with a herring, which"], [169, "1837.] FISHING. 113 abound on the coast, and are taken by a long comb with teeth about an inch asunder, and ten inches in length. This instrument is beaten into the shoal as the canoes glide over it, and as the operator feels it strike the fish, they are, by a slight inclination of the hand, turned into the canoe. The sides of the bay are covered by salmon stages in the summer season, AA'hen that fish is very abundant. Gooseberries, straAvberries, and the whortleberry appear to be plentiful in summer, and probably the raspberry. No vestige remains of the settlement noticed by Vancouver, nor could I discover on the site of the Spanish battery the slightest trace of stones em ployed for building. The chiefs pointed out where their houses stood, and Avhere the potatoes grew, but not a trace remains of an European. On my taking leave of them, the chief and his family exhibited much feeling; indeed, I was not Avithout some slight share of it myself. I had be come much interested about the party. Their gene ral courtesy and freedom from importunity, daily present of ten salmon, and information rudely im parted, added to a very pressing invitation to visit them at Tasheis, had convinced me they were su perior to any we had yet fallen in with, and that they deserved encouragement.

On the morning of the 19th October, we made Punta de los Reyes and the Farallones, the weather being beautifully fine, and the sea smooth ; but the breeze throughout the day did not enable us to make much progress, and further tantalized us by springing up at sunset.

Of the revolution, of which we heard much and expected more, not a trace could be observed; it was a sore subject, and (as it resulted) they were evidently aware of their inability to govern them selves: no one stepped forward to attempt it, and they quietly fell back under the Mexican yoke. Another fate attends this country; their hour is fast approaching ; harassed on all sides by Indians, who are now stripping them of their horses, without which their cattle are not to be preserved ; pestered by a set of renegado deserters from whalers and merchant ships, who start by dozens, and will eventually form themselves into a bandit gang, and domineer over them ; unable, from want of spirit, to protect themselves ; they will soon dwindle into in significance.

In open day they rode to the mission of St. Luis, and took from the \" corral \" all the horses belonging to the mission, (said to be a thousand !) desiring the administrador to keep clear of rifle range. Having a special introduction to the Padre Pre sidente of the mission residing at Santa Clara, I set out, accompanied by Lieutenant Kellett and our surgeon, to visit him ; hoping to obtain the neces sary table supplies from the missions, instead of taking our chance at the beach. After much toil, and a night spent in the marshes by the fault of a bad pilot, we reached Santa Clara to breakfast, but Avere miserably disappointed, the padre being absent at San Josef. The mission is fast falling to decay, and scarcely common civility Avas shoAvn to us. \u2022Lately, all the missions haA*e been transferred into the hands of administradores, aaIio, under the new law, take about tAvo-thirds to themselves, and ac count for the remaining third to government. The consequence is, that the Indians are robbed ; they do nothing but rob when they can, run away to escape punishment, and then form themselves into gangs, and set their masters at defiance. The mis sions, the only respectable establishments in this"], [174, "[1837. 118 ENTER SACRAMENTO country, are thus annihilated ; they have been vir tually plundered by all parties. These were the only places of resort for travellers throughout California, and even in their palmy times were only tolerable ; but now a meal cannot be procured withont difficulty, and travellers must rely upon their oaati resources. On my return to the ship, I started AA'ith the Starling, pinnace, tAvo cutters, and two gigs, to ex plore the navigable limit of the Rio Sacramento ; one of three streams, diverging about thirty miles up the north-western arm of Estrecho Karquines, where the Blossom's survey terminated. At. dawn, on the 24th of October, we started, and carried the Starling thirty-six miles. On the 26th, the pilot assuring us that she could not be carried further, we stored our boats with as much provision as they could stow, and moved on. We soon found our pilot mistaken, but it was now too late, our measures were taken, and several boats twenty miles in advance. With a most beautiful day we ad vanced, touching at particular spots for astronomical stations. Ducks and geese were noticed in great numbers ; also elk and deer, in herds of twenty and thirty ; but there Avas no time for delay. From former descriptions of the river, I Avas greatly disappointed at not meeting with either the San Joachim or Jesus Maria, equally large streams, said to trifurcate north and south with the Sacra mento. These streams may possibly be found upon"], [175, "1837.] SACRAMENTO. 119 a closer examination, but no such idea is conveyed, even to the inquisitive observer, on entering the mouth of the Sacramento, which becomes a narrow stream about twenty miles above the position where we left the Starling ; the intermediate extensive sheet of Avater forming a great archipelago. As our entry was on the northern edge of this archipelago, we were satisfied that no great river ran in the direc tion of or behind \" Elk Range ;\" the tAvo streams, if they fork here, must be southerly. On our left the high range of the Montes Diavolo, as Avell as Elk range, appeared to bound the limits of A\\*ater. On our right the range of the Sierras Bol- bones was visible, equally from the sea as from the source of the Sacramento. All the intermediate space in the rainy season may be under water, and at such a period, the trifurcation may possibly be apparent ; but our guide appeared quite as much in the dark as ourselves, and could not afford any satis factory explanation. This guide Avas one of those trained in former days to hunt for Christians ! * and frequently, on be ing pressed upon a subject of Avhich he really knew nothing, would reply, \" I only knoAV where to find the Indians.\" As these Indians were sought for in streams which flowed southerly of the Bolbones, and at the * Boats with soldiers were sent under the direction of the padres to capture Indians and bring them to the missions, where they were made Christians nolens volens."], [176, "120 [1837- INDIAN HUNTERS. back of the range, behind San Josef, the San Joachim probably Aoavs in that direction, branching off at the archipelago near the entrance of the Sacramento, but certainly not navigable, nor entitled to be named as a river in conjunction with its majestic neigh bour. Having entered the Sacramento, we soon found that it increased in width as we advanced, and at our noon station of the second day was about one-third of a mile wide. The marshy land iioav gave way to firm ground, preserving its level in a most remarkable manner, succeeded by banks well AA'ooded Avith oak, planes, ash, willoAv, chesnut, walnut, poplar, and brusliAvood. Wild grapes in great abundance over hung the lower trees, clustering to the river, at times completely overpowering the trees on which they climbed, and producing beautiful varieties of tint. All our efforts were directed to reach the head of the stream without delay, stopping only at nine a. m., noon, and three p. m., for astronomical stations. As my boat was swift, these short delays afforded rest to the men, and we very soon overtook those in advance. About half way up we observed Indians on our right, but were soon apprised of their friendship by our guide, who brought their pass from the General Vallejo, \" to absent themselves from the mission of San Jose, in order to make treaties with the natives or wild Indians ;\" or in other terms, to make trade for peltry, &c. Two of these volunteering to join"], [177, "1837.] 121 POINT VICTORIA. our party, and hoping through them to get into com munication AA'ith others, by whom we might be sup plied with venison, &c, we AAillingly took them into the boats. On the 30th, about four p. m., we found the deep boats stopped at a point AA*here the river forked. Lieutenant Kellett was despatched to examine the main stream, but returned AA*ithout having passed out of sight, reporting \" no Avater for our lightest boats.\" The natives also assured us that this was the ford where the hunters cross. I landed at \" the Fork,\" which was named Point Victoria, and found the natives had but shortly fled, leaving a large stock of acorns, and all their provisions, fires, &c, behind. Every experiment was resorted to in order to get an answer from them. The natives who accom panied us called loud enough, and doubtless they were close to us ambushed, but afraid to reply. I therefore attached a knife, some tobacco, and beads, and left them to be picked up when the natives re turned. On the folloAving morning I perceived them crouching in the grass. One had a metal band on his brow, through which some feathers were passed. They Avere not clothed, and appeared a Avretched-looking race. They disregarded every overture made to them by our tAvo Indians, whom I directed to go. full in their front on the opposite bank, (about pistol-shot across,) and endeavour to arouse them. With my telescope I could observe"], [178, "122 [1837. WALLOCKS. them Avave the hand sloAvly to indicate their disin clination, and therefore gave up all further hope of friendly communication. Before quitting, I left other presents ; and our interpreting friends were very anxious to exhibit their generosity, by easing them of bags of acorns, &c, and were much discon certed at my refusal to sanction their exploits. They were termed the Wallock tribe by our Indians. Our extreme position having been satisfactorily determined by astronomical observations, and true bearing of the Sierras Bolbones, the more arduous part of our duty commenced, viz. the trigonometrical survey from hence to the junction with the Blossom's Survey at the mouth of the San Pablo. By these observations Point Victoria was found to be in latitude 38\u00b0 46' 47\" north, longitude 0\u00b0 47' 31\"5 east of the observatory on Yerba Buena ; traversing in its meanderings about one hundred and fifty miles. Throughout the Avhole extent, from Elk station to the Sacramento mouth, the country is one immense flat, bounded in the distance N.W. by Sierras Dia volo, W. Sierras Bolbones, and E.N.E. to E.S.E. by the Sierras Nievadas, from whence no doubt this river springs, and rises in proportion to the rains and thaws. Our course lay between banks, varying from twenty to thirty feet above the river-level, appa rently, from its strata, of differently composed clay and loose earth, produced by some great alluvial deposit. Sand did occur at times, but not a rock or"], [179, "1837.] 123 HUGE OAKS. pebble varied the sameness of the banks. These were, for the most part, belted with wHIoav, ash, oak, or plane, (platanus occidentals,) AA'hich latter, of immense size, overhung the stream, without ap parently a sufficient hold in the soil to support them, so much had the force of the stream denuded their roots. Within, and at the verge of the banks, oaks of immense size were plentiful. These appeared to form a band on each side, about three hundred yards in depth, and within (on the immense park-like extent, which we generally explored when landing for positions) they Avere to be seen disposed in clumps, Avhich served to relieve the eye, wandering over what might otherwise be described as one level plain or sea of grass. Several of these oaks were examined, and some of the smaller felled. The two most remarkable measured respectively twenty-seven feet and nineteen feet in circumference, at three feet above ground. The latter rose perpendicularly at a (computed) height of sixty feet before expand ing its branches, and was truly a noble sight. All the trees and roots on the banks afford un equivocal proofs of the power of the flood-streams, the mud line on a tree we measured exhibiting a rise of ten feet above the present level, and that of recent date. At the period of our examination the river was probably at its loAvest, and much less than I had an ticipated in regard to strength, being at times"], [180, "124 [1837. RANCHERIAS. almost still water ; and yet up to our highest posi tion the Sulphur might have been warped or toAved by a steamer. During the rainy season, which commences about the middle of November, and terminates about the end of February, the river is said to overflow its banks, when its impetuosity i*3 such that navigation (for the craft of this country I suppose) is then impossible. The annual rains do not, however, of necessity inundate these low lands, but in severe seasons, after heavy falls of snoAv, they produce one immense sea, leaving only the few scattered eminences which art or nature have pro duced, as so many islets or spots of refuge. Upon these spots the tribes who inhabit these low lands are frequently compelled to seek shelter, principally, however, on those artificially constructed, \u2014 as all were which we examined. They consist merely of a rounded pile, raised about fifteen feet at the apex above the surrounding level ; the space from Avhich the earth is removed forming a ditch to carry off the superfluous water. Our pilot termed them Rancherias, (as they also do any place to which the natives resort,) and as sured us that each was the separate property of a distinct tribe. None exceed one hundred yards in diameter ; and confined within such a compass, it is fearful to contemplate the ravages which disease must make in an inclement season, or the misery which the survivors must endure thus pent up with the dead and dying."], [181, "125 1837.] ONEE-SHAN-A-TEES. Lately, fever and ague carried off whole tribes ; and the spots they had thus so carefully reared, were but their own tombs ! On one of these I had fixed a station, and on digging to insert the post, the parts of a skeleton, with hair perfect, mixed with ashes, were turned up. It is, therefore, probable that they burn their dead, to destroy the animal matter, and prevent contagion. This Rancheria was assigned by our pilot (an Indian) to the Onee-shan a-tee tribe ; but as he appeared to name every tribe below Point Victoria (AA'here they are Wallocks) by the same appellation, I am induced to attach little importance to his nomenclature, as I have been since informed that they keep to the left bank. At a position nearer Point Victoria where no mound was apparent, many entire skeletons were scattered about, above ground ; AA*hich probably may have resulted from the mortality before alluded to (a few years since) having cut them off before they could reach their Rancheria. My first impression was, that some great battle had been fought, and that their dead had been left. But this is not customary, and they would not have been left so complete by birds or beasts of prey. As these skeletons appeared less disturbed, it is probable that at these seasons of inundation, birds and beasts retire to the mountains or wooded elevations. On our passage down, we visited the Indians Avhom we had found encamped. They were also of"], [182, "[ I 837 126 GROTESQUE DRESSES. the Onee-shan-a-tee tribe, and were evidently pre pared to receive us in better humour. They appeared as if they had just returned from plundering the dresses of a theatre, being partially clothed in shirts, jackets, trousers, &c ; in many instances Avearing but half of one of the articles ; the effect of which, in the case of trousers, was ridiculous in the extreme. Those who could not sport these grotesque dresses, were fancifully deco rated with those pigments which wood fires pro duce, and which, when nearly dry, was scored off, thus displaying skeletons, tatoos, &c ; some indeed exhibited the neAv patterns of fancy shirts very ad mirably imitated. The generality, however, were very disgusting. The first party were without implements of any kind, and probably came on a visit of ceremony ; as the spokesman, who was one of our interpreters before alluded to, came to inform me that he had put some fish on board of the boats. Lower down the river, I visited them at their Rancheria, and there had an opportunity of observing them more minutely. Some of the women were clad in cloaks made from the skins of a slate-coloured duck we had not yet seen, (either now or in 1827,) which presented a very neat appearance. All sexes and ages were collected, and all busily employed, \u2014 the Avomen pounding and making acorn-bread, boiling huge horse-chesnuts, &c, the men forming arrows."], [183, "1837.] 127 HABITS OF INDIANS. The only apparent formation of a hut beneath the trees, AA'hieh Avere their only shelter from the sun, Avas a kind of partition formed of folding mats. Some bore the marks of tatoo ; but this was not common, and Avas probably a mission taste. Their general appearance was that of extreme misery and filthiness ; and much as I wished to see the completion of one of their arrows then in pro gress, I was glad to breathe the open air, and free myself from such company. Some of our party induced the hunting set to exhibit their skill with the bow ; but they were far from expert. Their implements were but feAv, and of the simplest kind, \u2014 similar, indeed, to those observed at Point Victoria, and probably constructed on the spot, to prevent the labour of conveyance. They are migratory, and were generally traced by us to have fixed their temporary sojourn under a horse-chesnut, or in the immediate vicinity of acorn grouuds. It is probable that they continue travelling and amassing their stock until winter, and then betake themselves to the high grounds or the Rancherias. As habit is second nature, and all these tribes, including all I have seen at the mis sions, appear of the most degraded class, it is pro bable that they prefer the latter, (\" Degustibus, &c.,) AA'here possibly their friends the ducks and geese, visit them occasionally. Possibly, also, the deer may drop in on them. But the chances are miserably poor, in case of inundation."], [184, "128 [1837. DECREASE OF TRIBES. The river abounds in fish and muscles, which they take in great quantity ; but I suspect they are not sufficiently skilful to capture those of larger dimensions, which we noticed incessantly leaping ; probably sturgeon, or a fish resembling it very closely. Elk and deer were tolerably plentiful ; the former are easily taken, and the profusion of antlers found at the Rancherias prove their capture in fair quan tity. The pilot, a native, converted and retained by the mission, informed us that the banks throughout our whole route were once thickly studded with these Rancherias, and with natives to possess them. They are noAv nearly extinct, and individuals of the tribes are only to be found in the mission. Let not theorists too eagerly advance the opinion, that the introduction of foreigners depopulates whole tracts. A higher power has operated here. It is probable that the hunters and DelaAvares which frequent these grounds, may have in some measure caused them to shift their ground. It is also known that they have most valorously con tended even against the rifle, and suffered slaughter rather than retreat, generally severely and fatally wounding their adversaries. These are traditions. Of the mortal sickness which scourged the Columbia and its tribes, as far south as the Colorado in one year, and even penetrated to the rocky mountains, we have the most perfect evidence. The later visitation of"], [185, "1837.] 129 ANIMALS, the small-pox probably Avas communicated by an American or Canadian. The Sacramento AA*as once famed for its beaver and land-otter.

The climate by day was mild, ranging from 41\u00b0 to 77\u00b0. On one occasion on shore at night it fell as Ioav as 36\u00b0. The AA*ater ranged from 53\u00b0 to 56M Slight rain was experienced on two days, but the weather generally was extremely fine. Our collection was enriched by some very beauti ful ducks, owls, haAvks, and other birds, which abounded on the banks. Of four-footed animals few Avere killed. Cuyote or jackal-fox, racoon, land otter, AA'easel, and squirrel, were obtained. I fired tAvice at small tigers or tiger-cats, but they AA*ere too thickly clad for small shot to make any impres sion. The party succeeded in taking an elk and a deer, and killing a great quantity of \"wild geese. Near the mouth of the river the soil is entirely peaty ; so much so, that it was very difficult to use the artificial horizon, particularly on the ebb or flood-tides. The spring-tides overflow all the lower lands, which are well stored with long fl-ig grass, and rushes of great size, of which latter the natives con struct their balsas. The ground does not assume a substantial bearing until the flood is overcome by the fresh water ; and there the soil is of the finest vol. i. K"], [186, "[1837. 130 VEGETATION. kind. Roses, arbutus, and other small shrubs flourish luxuriantly, and Avild grain produces and re-sows itself, affording perpetual pasturage to the deer, &c. During the dry season the natives burn this doAvn, and probably by such means destroy many oak plantations Avhich othenvise would flourish. The oak of California does not bear a high cha racter, although it is the same as that used generally on the eastern coast of America, about the same parallel. The ash is excellent, but does not attain any great size. Wild grapes generally prefer it, and the varied colours of the dark-green leaves, added to the brown tints of the decaying leaves of the vine, produce, on rounding the different bends of the river, very beautiful contrasts at this season. Our friend the plane, however, will not be eclipsed. The timber of this tree is solid, and does not swim ; when green it seasons well, and I found it made good gunwales and timbers for light boats. Laurel, varieties of oak, sumach, pine, &c, we noticed ; also the bulbous root termed ammoles by the Spaniards, and generally used as a detergent in washing. It is roasted, and used by the natives as food. It has a sweetish taste. The grapes were abundant and well-tasted, but small in size and large in seed, therefore not very great luxuries. Some of the acorns were as sweet as chesnuts. The fruits of the hiccory and walnut we occasionally met with, and not having better, we"], [187, "1837.] 131 AVANT PROVISIONS. thought them excellent ; but the shells being very thick, and the fruit small, they were as little prized as the grapes. About twenty miles above the Starling's anchorage we found the water perfectly sweet ; we therefore became not only relieved of the weight of this ne cessary article, but were enabled to luxuriate in draughts of the purest we had tasted for many weary months. To seamen such a luxury seldom occurs, and it is one a landsman can scarcely appre ciate. I suspect, however, that the waters of the Sacramento would obtain their preference over all others. It was otherwise, however, with solid provision. Of this we very soon fell short ; and the nature of our duties prevented our seeking assistance with our guns. Twice we were compelled to despatch a boat for fresh supplies, and on each occasion were re duced to a much lower ebb than was either con venient or pleasant. Yet all Avas cheerfully sub mitted to, with the exception of one or two bad characters, who were sent to luxuriate on board the ship, as a punishment. They very soon wished themselves on the bad fare, as they termed it. One boat had hardly quitted us before she fell in with a deer bathing, and to prevent the possibility of losing a regale, they put about ten balls into his head. They did not bring him back to us ; time was too precious. They killed an elk near the k 2"], [188, "[1837. 132 REJOIN STARLING. Starling, but by the bloAv of an oar. Of him we tasted, but it was coarse meat. The soil on the banks is generally a loose mix ture of sand and clay, entirely alluvial. The bottom varies, from very loose mud to stiff red clay, and oc casionally a very quick sand. Tavo varieties of my tilus and some univalves Avere obtained. As Ave neared the actual mouth of the Sacramento, AA*e were rather more minute in our examinationof the creeks, but found nothing to change in our former opinions. On the 18th November we sighted the Starling, and having carried the triangulation up to her nearest position, before sunset had the satisfaction, after twenty-three days confinement in the boats, of again luxuriating in a wholesome bed. As the Avork of each day was entirely completed on paper before we retired to rest, (sometimes at four a. m.) the severe part of our labours was here ended. It was my intention to have waited a couple of days at this position, and afforded the party amuse ment in shooting geese, ducks, elk, and deer, which were in great abundance. But as the Starling's provisions had been forwarded to us, and we had barely sufficient to carry us down, this was necessa rily abandoned; although in the course of our operations we were not idle at this work, parti cularly about sunset ; generally bagging our eight or ten heavy geese for the ensuing day.

HaA*ing completed our connexion with the Blos som's Survey up to Yerba Buena, we reached the Sulphur on the 24th November ; having been absent altogether on this interesting but harassing service thirty-one days. As far as navigation is concerned, the Sacramento affords eA*ery facility for small craft as high up as the \" Fork ;\" but I cannot at present perceive any ad- A-antage to be derived from taking large vessels above the Starling's position, or even above the creek at the mouth of the Estrecho Karquines, Avhich communicates with the mission of San Jose, and Avhich, until settlements are made above, will be the extent of traffic, excepting for timber. Taking into consideration the AA'hole port of San Francisco, the Sacramento, and minor streams, there is immense field for capital, if the government could protect its citizens or those inclined to reside. At this moment (December, 1837) they are reduced to almost their extreme gasp; harassed by their oaati servants (Avho are natives) deserting and carry- ing off their property ; threatened by the Delawares, Avho have piratically ranged the country, taking away horses and cattle ; disturbed by their late declaration and recantation of independence ; they sadly Avant the interposition of some powerful friend"], [190, "[1837. 134 GLOOMY PROSPECTS. to rescue them. To Great Britain their hopes are directed ; why, I cannot learn, but I am much in clined to think that it is rather from a pusillanimous fear, and want of energy to stand by each other and expel their common enemies, than from any friendly feeling to Great Britain. Besides this, they look with some apprehension upon a poAver daily increasing in importance \u2014 an organised independent band of deserters from Ame rican and English Avhalers, who prefer a roving careless life on horseback, and certainty of food Avithout labour, to the customary hardships of their vocation. These men, headed by one or two noted daring characters now amongst them, will, whenever it suits their purpose, dictate their own terms and set all law at defiance. It is distressing to witness the downfall of this splendid port, all the forts in ruins, not even a signal-gun mounted ! Such are the blessings of revolution ! During my absence, the serjeant and corporal of marines, carpenter's mate, and several men and boys, had deserted; seduced, it is supposed, by promises of independence, high pay, promotion, &c. All our efforts to trace them were unavailing. We had strong suspicions that they were concealed by a person heading the mountain gang, (a discharged midshipman,) particularly as the serjeant had been his shipmate before, and he had visited the ship about that period. Nothing further detaining us here, we embarked"], [191, "1837.] 135 MONTEREY. the observatory ; and on the 30th November took our departure for Monterey, Avhere we arrived on the 2nd December. Here I found my old friend, Mr. Jones, (the American consul to the Sandwich Islands,) who had visited the coast on a matrimonial expedition. As he had just purchased the wreck of an American whaler, which had been driven on the beach, a week since, during a heavy gale, we were fortunate enough to obtain from him a very season able supply of beef, pork, flour, and biscuits; of course at a pretty high price. The French frigate, La Venus, our old consort at the Sandwich Islands, had quitted but a few days before, and proceeded to San Bias. No one should calculate on supplies beyond those immediately connected Avith present consumption, in any port of California. Bullocks, sheep, and vegetables, (particularly potatoes,) with a few fowls and fruit, are all that can be looked for, and these are of moderate price. All these are much inferior in quality, and fruit is particularly scarce since the destruction of the missions. At San Francisco fine fat bullocks, weighing from four to five hundred pounds, hide included, were purchased at five dollars each, sheep two dollars. I am perfectly satisfied that beef could be as well cured here on the farms, if proper precautions and good materials were used, as in other parts of the world. Individually I have proved it to the extent of one bullock. I think it would keep sound for"], [192, "136 [1837. STATE OF DEFENCES. tAA*o years; but from the wild state of the animals when dragged to the port, the blood is too much excited to allow of fair trial. Beef in these climates requires more sugar and nitre than in colder regions. Monterey I found as much increased as San Francisco had fallen into ruin. It was still, how ever, very miserable, and wanting in the military air of 1827. The adobe or mud-brick battery remained, and had been neAvly bedaubed during the late ebullition of independence. There were guns it is true, (about seven,) but they were in a state infinitely more dangerous to those using them, than to those against Avhom they might have been used. An Englishman was found possessing suffi cient courage to fire one at the crisis of the revo lution. That gun decided the question ! Yet I find in the restrictions enjoined on poor Douglas that he was in honour bound \"to desist from entering or taking plans of the fortifications !\" which consisted of a mud wall of three sides, open in the rear, with breastwork about three feet in height ; with rotten platforms for seven guns, the discharge of which avouIcI annihilate their remains of carriages. The muzzles of one or tAvo brass twenty-four pounders, very old and very handsome, are absent, and their vents might, upon an emergency, be used to load, provided it became necessary to make a second effort to discharge the shot, as I have once witnessed. The visit of La Venus had stripped the place of most of the supplies of which we stood in need."], [193, "137 1837.] FRUITLESS SEARCH. The governor was in daily expectation of being superseded by a Mexican appointment ; but it was not quite certain that he would resign his honours AArithout giving some trouble. The affairs of Cali fornia Avere not yet finally arranged. Commissioners had gone to Mexico, via Acapulco, in order to come to some definitive arrangement. On the 6th December we quitted Monterey for San Bias, whither I had already despatched the Starling to obtain our letters ; the distance to Tepic, where our vice-consul, Mr. Baron, resides, causing a delay of forty-eight hours. A very severe bilious fever confined me to my cot for some days, and prevented my examining the island of Guadalupe, and searching for others said to exist. On the 11th December Ave passed close to Guada lupe, and thence explored a degree on the parallel where an island had been lately reported, but without success, thence southerly, to fall into the parallel of Shelvoes, Sheh*ocke's, or ShoA'el Island ; steering easterly towards Cape San Lucas, until I had sufficiently determined its non-existence within thirty miles east or west of its assigned position. The Venus also went over the same ground on nearly the same errand, and AA*ith like success. On the 16th December we passed Cape San Lucas within about half a mile of the rocks, looking into the bay preparatory to a future examination, and passed on for Tres Marias, off which we per ceived the Starling on the 18th of December."], [194, "[1837. 138 TRES MARIAS. On the day following we landed on the Northern Maria, and obtained sights ; but disliking the an chorage, stood aAvay and anchored off the centre of George Island, Avhere we procured wood, surveyed the bay, and fixed its position. We then quitted for San Bias. There is nothing inviting on either of the Marias. In the rainy season water may flow, but from what I Avitnessed of the channels through which it must pass, they should be Avell cleansed by floods before it would be fit for consumption. What remained in the natural tanks Avas sulphureous ; brackish, although far above the influence of the sea ; and formed a strong infusion of decayed leaves. By the tracks observed, turtle appeared to have visited the island lately, but none were seen or taken. Wood is plentiful, particularly a species of lignum vit\u00e6. Cedar of the coarse species used for canoes we met with, but none of fine grain. Firs are probably in the mountains, as I found a cone in one of the water-courses. The other trees are similar to those found at San Bias. The soil is chiefly composed of a sandy mud, similar to that discharged from volcanoes, and Avhich in some cases assists in forming an amygdaloidal stratum, of which the cliffs and water-courses, es pecially on the northern island, are chiefly com posed. On George's Island the Avater-courses were of this nature, with large boulders of greenstone. On the eastern point a small delta of Ioav land occurs, which"], [195, "1837.] 139 ARRIVE AT SAN BLAS. has coral sand for its substratum, skinned over Avith a covering of mud and soil, on which rank grass luxuriates. Fish appear to be numerous, particularly sharks ; and the dead shells on the beach, including almost every knoAA*n species in these seas, hold out a pros pect of employment for the conchologist. But the capricious character of the ocean about these islands renders visits at any time hazardous, as a few moments may imprison the naturalist for weeks. Ten years since, nearly to a day, I found landing on any part of these shores impracticable, although the weather previously had been fine. Here Vancouver tried ineffectually for water, and I was induced, by the assertion of a master of a vessel belonging to San Bias, \" that Avells were sunk, and good water conveniently to be had,\" to make this examination. It is not improbable that if wells were sunk, water could be obtained ; but is the result worth the trouble or risk?

ARRIVAL OF VENUS. CHAPTER VI. By the kindness of my excellent friend, Mr. Barron, a large packet of newspapers, affording us the official intelligence of the accession of our Maiden Queen, Victoria, was immediately on our arrival despatched to us, with dates to September. On the 21st of December the Venus arrived from Mazatlan, AA*hen we had the satisfaction of reneAv. ing our acquaintance with our French friends. I found from Captain du Petit Thouars, that he had been successful in his examination of the coast of California, and had surveyed the Bay of Magdalena, rounded Cape San Lucas, and proceeded to Mazat lan in the vain hope of obtaining supplies. Here he was equally unsuccessful, excepting in flour, of Avhich he obtained forty barrels at a very exorbitant price. Many of his crew being ill with scurvy, which I believe first made its appearance at Kamts chatka, he determined on proceeding immediately to Acapulco, and landing them until recovered, and"], [199, "1838.] APPROACH ACAPULCO. 143 thence proceeding on to Callao or Valparaiso for provisions, of which he stood much in need. Wine in particular he had not been able to obtain, nor had we at this time spirits for our crew. The duties here on imports are so exorbitant, that they amount almost to an entire prohibition. At Cali fornia sixty dollars were demanded for fifteen im perial gallons of indifferent rum, and no doubt at San Bias or Acapulco not under twenty would have been asked. On the 28th of December I despatched the Star ling to Panama, to obtain any letters, officers, or despatches which might arrive for us, and to rejoin us at our rendezvous, Realejo. We remained until the 5th of January for the last mail, but no thing arriving for the Sulphur, we bore away for Acapulco. Unfortunately we were drifted outside the land and sea breeze limits, and did not reach it until the evening of the 12th of January. We made the high paps of Coyuca to the west ward of Acapulco, but I cannot persuade myself that they are good landmarks for making the port. In the offing they may be useful if not obscured. Acapulco may be approached from the southward or westward, by keeping the w*estern cone open of the land, which will lead up to the Boca Chica en trance, or until Acapulco port is so close under the lee, that no further marks are necessary. There is not any hidden danger in the entrance to Acapulco. Keep a moderate distance from either shore, five"], [200, "144 [1S3S. VISIT THE GOVERNOR fathoms will be found alongside all the rocks, and twenty-five to thirty in mid-channel. Round Point Grifo sharp, rather than stand over to San Lorenzo, as the wind, generally westerly, heads on that shore. If working, tack when the rocks on the south point of Town Bay show in the gap. The two best berths are off the rocks alluded to ; that outside is preferable, but in either case let the outer rock bear W.S.W. or W.N.W., so that a haw ser fast to the rock may keep your broadside to land or sea breezes, and prevent a foul anchor. The breeze barely carried us to the Boca Chica by sunset, which made me determine on taking that channel in preference to the chances of calm or other delay by rounding the island. Fortunately we succeeded in rounding Point Grifo by dark, and beat up to our anchorage before eight, passing under the stern of our old friend Venus, who kindly sent immediate offers of any aid we might require. On calling upon Captain Thouars, I found he had also been tantalized by calms, had seen the Starling off the port, and had only been four days before us. On the following morning I waited on the Go vernor, who in the most civil manner offered me every facility in erecting the observatory, or in any other matter w*here his services could be available. He appears to be a complete military character, preserves strict discipline, and is much- esteemed. The Venus, after some trifling difficulties with"], [201, "1838.] EXCELLENT HARBOUR. 145 the authorities, landed her invalids, and established an hospital in a house hired for that purpose. Her astronomical and other observations were conducted at the south extremity of the town beach, on a spot inaccessible to land or sea breeze. During our stay we re-surveyed the port, and corrected several errors which were said to exist, particularly one of three and a half fathoms in the fairway ; upon which, however, eight and a half were found by the lead. It must therefore be an error in figure. The harbour of Acapulco has long been reckoned, for its size, one of the most complete in the world. It affords sheltered land-locked anchorage of sixteen fathoms and under, in a surface of one mile square ; which, allowing for moorings, would, at half a cable range, or one cable asunder, accommodate one hun dred sail of vessels, even of the line. The bottom is sandy at its surface, but clayey beneath, and holds well. It would naturally be inferred that, surrounded on its north and east sides by mountains ranging from two thousand, to two thousand seven hundred feet, and by others of three to five hundred feet on the west, the breeze would scarcely be felt, and the heat be intolerable. This is confined to the town limits ; at our observatory, and at the port, San Carlos, we enjoyed a constant breeze. In all harbours there may be objectionable berths, but in that of Acapulco, if care be taken to keep in vol. i. i*"], [202, "[1838. 146 MARKET. the line of what I have designated the \" west gap\" or neck of the peninsula, open of the south point of the town bay, both land and sea breezes will be felt in their full strength, and free from causes which would heat them before entering the port ; the neck being but a few feet above the sea-level. Water of good quality was found at several points between the fort and Obispo rock ; but the two best streams are between the fort and San Lorenzo. The market, owing to the decay of the respect able portion of its inhabitants, is but indifferently supplied, but fowls, fruit, and vegetables, arc readily obtained. The very great mistake committed in 1827, by the expulsion of the old Spaniards, has ruined every port on this side of Mexico, and the vexatious system of carrying into effect the Custom House regulations will utterly ruin its commerce, if this has not been already achieved. Only two European residents remain, (Germans,) and a few months will in all probability induce them to select some other port under the same laws, but more justly and favourably administered. During our visit, a French brig from Lima actually entered the port, and, much to the chagrin of the officials, who were contemplating their \" pickings,\" without a moment's delay tacked and put to sea, \u2014 her con signees having ordered her to San Bias, where pro ceedings are less vexatious. She was consigned to merchants in Mexico, and as the instructions came from Mexico, in anticipation of her arrival, they"], [203, "1838.] 147 SOCIETY. must be aware in that city of the state of affairs here. The circumstance appeared to afford matter of great amusement to the merchants, and I suspect that the presence of the Venus saved a little vexa tious conduct, had a boat from the authorities reached her. Acapulco from its earliest days has been famed as the resort of the galleons from Manilla, \u2014 the last, I believe, having entered in 1793 \u2014 4. This, of course, caused many wealthy Spaniards to settle as agents for houses in Mexico, and until the edict in 1827, requiring all old Spaniards to quit the territory, which was carried into effect in a truly bandit style by Montesdeosca, it continued to flourish. That edict, like a blight, annihilated the germs of high breeding; the Spaniards fled, half castes stepped in to represent society, and decay has fol lowed with rapid strides, until the place is now merely a wreck of its former opulence. Nature, indeed, has not stood idly by, but has added her full share of miseries, as a further inducement to desert this almost doomed city. As far back as the year 1732 earthquakes of uncommon force have continued to afflict this city. It is recorded that on the 25th of February of that year a very heavy earthquake destroyed nearly the whole town : the sea rose to a great height, covering the Plaza (or about ten feet perpendicular ;) the suc cessive risings, after receding, recurring slowly at the periods of the several shocks. l2"], [204, "148 [1838 EARTHQUAKES. On the 17th of August, 1754, another earth quake occurred, ruining the greater part of the town. On this occasion the rising of the sea was attended with more violence; the Plaza was again covered. On the 21st of April, 1776, an earthquake occurred which destroyed many houses. On the 14th of March, 1787, the whole town was ruined. The sea retired, leaving the rocks of the Punta Manzanilla (in the town bay) dry. The Phillippine, Nao, was anchored at the time in the port, and was left in four fathoms before the tide returned, \u2014 showing a fall of thirty-six feet. No earthquake of consequence is recorded after wards until that of the 2nd of May, 1820. This earthquake lasted several days, and entirely destroyed the place. The steeple of San Francisco fell on this occasion, and the church, was rent ; the sea retired still further than in 1787, and returned in two hours, rising up to the church door ; the rise and fall taking place gently. At the ultimate recession the sand was found to have accumulated so as to nearly cover the pier, (five or six feet,) by which upwards of twenty varas of land was gained at the beach. On the 10th of March, 1833, about ten o'clock at night, a heavy earthquake was experienced. The sea retired forty feet, and gently resumed its former level. This was felt at Mexico at precisely the same hour, lasting there about one minute and a"], [205, "1838.] 149 EARTHQUAKES. half, the motion there being undulatory, but at Aca pulco trepidatory. On March 13th, 1834, another shock is recorded; the sea receded fifty varas, and several buildings were destroyed. On the 6th of January, 1835, at six in the morning, a very severe earthquake was felt, lasting upwards of two minutes ; motion trepidatory, the shocks recurring every thirty hours for upwards of a month. This, like that of 1833, was felt in Mexico. On the 9th of August, 1837, a heavy shock was felt, trepidatory, recurring at thirty hours for nearly three weeks. It was felt slightly at Mexico. On the 18th of October, 1837, at four p. m. a heavy earthquake occurred, which lasted until the 22nd. During this interval of four days the earth trembled continuously ; one hundred separate shocks were counted between four p. m. 18th, and ten p. M. 22nd. During this interval five very severe shocks occurred, four p. m. 18th, ten p. m. 19th, midnight 19th, four p. m. 20th, four p. m. 21st. That at mid night on the 21st was terrific ; had it lasted a few seconds longer, rocks would undoubtedly have been rent asunder. Following this earthquake, for six weeks continuously, periodical heavy shocks were experienced, at ten a. m., ten and twelve p. m., and at dawn. At Mexico the shocks were severely felt at the same instants, on the 18th and 19th. In conclusion, daily \" temblors \" have occurred since"], [206, "150 [1838. DILAPIDATIONS. the earthquake of 1820. But the season when the heaviest shocks occur is between March and June. The above is extracted from notes made by a commissary resident for many years, and constantly holding office under the government of all parties. Under the dread of such visitations and with daily warnings that \"all is not at rest,\" who can be surprised at the desertion of Acapulco ? The whole town at this moment bears glaring proof of a recent concussion. Not a whole house remains. The churches are demolished ; one chapel (La Solidad) alone remains, where mass is performed ; but even this is rent, and is tottering. By reason of such liabilities, houses are never built above the ground floor. Those of the lower orders are most sensibly constructed, of cane thatched. Those of the better class, including the authorities, are of adobes, formed of mud and straw, generally from three to four feet in thickness, in the walls. The latter are generally tiled, to afford ventilation, and avoid insects, which are numerous and troublesome. Pride alone must induce them to construct these mud habitations, for with less expense a frame of cane covered with tiles would be infinitely preferable. It is rather a remarkable fact that, throughout the whole of these shocks, the rock-built castle of San Diego (or San Carlos) has experienced but slight damage. I caused very minute inquiry to be made, in order"], [207, "1838.] 151 RAINY SEASON. to ascertain to some degree of certainty whether any of the solid granite rocks had altered their height above the level. The only satisfactory reply that I could obtain was, That from time immemorial the rock we made fast to maintained its present position, and no change of outer soundings had been observed. High water flows to a hole in that rock, and up to a crown well marked. The rainy season is also another great drawback, and is felt here severely. It commences about the middle or end of July, and continues until the end of October. Owing to the immediate vicinity of a very lofty chain overlooking the town, (one of 2,790 feet) the fall is heavy, and almost incessant. It has been asserted that in 1837 the rain gauge frequently indicated twenty-eight inches in twenty-four hours. During this period the inhabitants are compelled to use every precaution to keep their houses dry, par ticularly under foot : a neglect of this is supposed to produce fever. The heat during this period is excessively oppressive, especially in May, when the temperature seldom falls below 98. Water then becomes scarce, and towards the end of the dry season the ponds run dry, and wells are their only resource. Formerly Acapulco was considered as the main outlet from Mexico on this side ; but San Bias is now preferred. The distance from hence is one hundred and four Spanish leagues, and the journey up is generally performed in eight days. The exports consist chiefly"], [208, "[1838 152 DRESS, of rice, sugar, dyewoods, and cotton, and of these but a trifling quantity. The following remarks of a mercantile friend will best illustrate the present state of trade : \" The environs of Acapulco are not badly populated, but the wants of these people, the climate being tropical, are but few, and, like the neighbouring Indians, their principal dress consists of the manta, although they use a little more finery, the men wearing Chinese sashes, (fasas or bandas,) and pre ferring' linen to cotton for their shirts. The women dress in linen shifts, using navy blues, and calicoes for their petticoats. Stockings are not in use, and for their head gear they entirely make use of the riboza or Mexican shawl, made in the interior. Their hats, shoes, and other trifling articles of wearing apparel are all made in the interior ; so that articles for sale on the spot, that can be imported into Acapulco, are reduced to very few. \" The importation of manta is prohibited, being supplied from the interior. Creas, Russian duck, prints, a trifle of fine linen, such as Bretagnes, Estopillas, &c, a few China goods, as sashes, twine, silk, &c, but principally platillas of middling and ordinary quality, and navy blues. The consumption would not exceed two hundred dollars annually.\" Thus far then the commerce of the interior appears to meet their necessities, and the wants of the popu lation are not likely to attract cargoes to this port. My friend concludes, \u2014"], [209, "1838.] STATISTICS. 153 \" It is only an increase of population and consequent increase of agricultural industry, that in time may raise the port of Acapulco to any consequence for maritime speculation.\" The population of Acapulco in 1836 was computed as follows : Town. Men 857 Women 1216 Total 2073 Deaths. Men 35 Births. Boys 45 Women 40 Girls 70 Total 75 Total 115 Excess above deaths 40 \u2014 about 1 per cent. The diseases of the country are intermittent fever, ague, yellow fever, jaundice, and dropsy ; measles and hooping-cough were prevalent during our visit. The fort will not bear much scrutiny. Although constructed by the best engineers of the day, San Carlos, the third fortification of Western Spain (viz. Callao 1st, Ulloa 2nd, and Carlos 3rd) is commanded by every easily accessible height in its neighbourhood. It is capable of mounting sixty guns ; twenty-five of various calibre are mounted ; ten good brass thirty two pounders show their muzzles very conspicuously, and these we may reckon their main force. Five hundred is stated as the garrison, and this includes militia, (when armed ;) one hundred and fifty can be"], [210, "[1838 154 AN EXECUTION. mustered. They are not well clothed ; and of course under such officers as frequent revolutions breed, like mushrooms, little can be expected beyond the most gorgeous and ill adapted uniform that can be imagined, stuffed by more pride than the buttons can well sustain. The officers here, as in some other free countries, can give you a yard of tape, ramrod, or sword. An example of their determination to rigidly execute the laws, occurred the day of our departure. Two peasants, murderers and robbers, were con demned by a court-martial to be shot. They were led out with great ceremony, escorted by an officers guard, and a priest in full canonicals purposely delay ing the march, and halting at intervals in order to inculcate religious precepts. They at length reached the fatal spot, a jutting headland fronting the ship. Here two seats had been prepared, with crosses at shoulder height, when seated. To these seats they were conducted, clad entirely in white, and their arms securely lashed to the crosses. The priest having repeated their sentence, from the warrant, they were desired to kiss it in testimony of its justice, and proof of their repentance, which they did most humbly. Having received the sacrament, they were despatched by signal, ten men presenting their pieces within three feet of each victim. One was twenty two and the other eighteen years of age, and the sum for which they deliberately committed murder, four shillings, or less !"], [211, "1838.] 155 SEARCH FOR SACRIFICIOS. As our purser one night had been forcibly per suaded to empty his pockets of his spare cash, and other acts of doubtful character occurred, we are unable to applaud the conduct of the lower orders. Indeed, we were informed that the native inhabitants of Puebla Nueva, a few leagues distant from the town, were frequently in the habit of setting the authorities at defiance, and committing excesses with impunity. The inhabitants seldom move from home, or in the town at night, unarmed. The peasantry are disarmed before entering the town, and receive their passes and receipts for arms, which are re turned on repassing the boundary. This reminds me of the steamers conveying labourers from Dublin in 1836, where their shilalehs were taken from them until they landed on the pier at Liver pool. After passing our time very agreeably, we took leave of our friends in the Venus, and on the 19th of January proceeded for Realejo, intending to touch at the Sacrificios and port of Guatulco, and determine their positions. On the 24th of January, being off the position assigned for Sacrificios, the coast was examined closely, for any indentation which might justify our anchoring. At noon we were to the east of Gua tulco, but no symptoms of a port. I therefore despatched a cutter with Lieutenant Collinson, to examine for Sacrificios, and rejoin me at anchor on"], [212, "[1838. 156 CURRENTS. the coast. After running twenty-four miles without meeting with any indentation to justify the title of port, I rounded to, and anchored off the west point of a bay, which probably may be the Morro Ayuca of Bauza, but it differs much in position. Landing at the time of anchoring was impracti cable, but I succeeded on the following day in obtaining complete observations on a rock off the point, by which this remarkable angle of the coast is well secured ; the sea giving me notice to quit, at the instant I had completed, by nearly washing away our instruments. At sunset, Lieutenant Collinson returned, having succeeded in finding Guatulco, and secured its posi tion. It was, however, too small for the ship. My detention at this point afforded me very satisfactory data respecting the partial set and direc tion of the currents. During the first twenty- four hours the current set strong, one and a half to two knots to the eastward. On the day following, having again anchored in a calm, it was found to set westerly, but not with so much velocity. Our dead reckoning varied considerably in every direc tion, but an easterly set prevailed. From Morro Ayuca I shaped a direct course across the Gulf of Tehuantepec, expecting to expe rience some of the gusts which are assigned to that region. In this we were entirely disappointed, although a fresh breeze favoured us for a short period. On approaching the eastern shore, near the"], [213, "1838.] 157 NUMEROUS VOLCANOS. Amilpas range, I was surprised, when at a conside rable distance from the land, to strike soundings in sixty-eight fathoms, which continued to decrease very regularly until ten that night, when we changed our course offshore in eleven and a half fathoms, with out perceiving land, or hearing the \" surf sound,\" which generally can be detected at night at seven, or even ten miles. Light baffling airs prevented our making much progress, but the tedium was in some measure dis sipated by splendid views of these volcanic ranges. At one view no less than twelve conspicuous vol canic cones were visible. As far as the sea horizon was available, we endeavoured to fix their positions, by anchoring daily before noon. Our draughtsmen attempted to delineate them, but no effort of the pencil could convey an adequate idea of such mag nificence. Far as the eye could reach to the N.E., numerous cones of extinct volcanos were readily traced, as friends of yesterday; whilst to the west ward we could barely trace through the tropical haze those with which to-morrow would bring us more intimately in connexion. Our observations were continued throughout the day three hourly. Although apparently overlooking us, the nearest cone was at least sixty miles distant. Our progress was but tardy until the morning of the 2nd Feb. when we reached in and sighted the colours at Sonsonate, off which we observed two American schooners at anchor. Amongst the minor"], [214, "158 [1838. REALE.IO. volcanos immediately about Sonsonate, that of Isalco appeared in activity, and has lately given them cause for anxiety.

VIEJO VOLCANO. CHAPTER VII. Having suffered much of late, horse exercise was recommended to me ; and as my professional duties might be much assisted by fixing some of the principal peaks in the neighbourhood, I deter mined on making an inland excursion for that ob ject. Having paid a visit to Mr. Bridge, the hos pitable j:>roprietor of a fine sugar plantation at San Antonio, and which he manages to work with great success, I made arrangements, through his assistance, for mounting the Viejo volcano, from whence I could obtain an extensive view, not only of the moun tains, but also of the features of the coast. Pro vided with the necessary instruments, and accom panied by the surgeon, a mate, and botanical collector, we started for Chinandega at p. m. on the 8th, fully intending to ride on to Moyatepita (a farm belonging to Mrs. Bridge) the same night; but owing to the stubbornness of our guide, who was lately married, and his wife residing at Chinan dega, we were unable to advance until five the"], [217, "1838.] 161 MOYOTEPITA. following morning. Fortunately we had the plea sure of an introduction to Sr. Chico Vallejo, who kindly entertained us during the night. About half past nine we reached Moyotepita, having passed through a band of mosquitoes, ex tending three or four miles, which galled both our selves and horses much, and sadly put our patience to the test. Suddenly they appeared, and after a brisk gallop, as suddenly forsook us. At Moyotepita we rested, breakfasted, and dined. Moyotepita is situated on the first rise of the great flat of marsh land, through which the Estero Real meanders until it reaches the Gulf of Fonseca. This flat extends easterly behind the ranges of Te lica and Asosusco, and probably near, or even as far as, the lake of Managua, by which (I firmly be lieve) it is fed. By barometric measurement it is not above the level of the observatory at Cardon. Range of temperature 84\u00b0 to 91\u00b0 in shade, in a well fifty feet deep 90M It was necessary to come to this side of the range, as the Volcano de Viejo is inaccessible on the south. At four p. m., having procured guides, we pro ceeded for the foot of the mountain, where we de signed sleeping. Our journey lay partly through the woods, where the guides halted for a draught of the fermented juice of the palm, (toddy,) which their previous visits had prepared, and others were now tapped in readiness for our return. As the method VOL. I. M"], [218, "[1838. 162 PINE RANGE. is different from any I have before observed, I shall describe it. The tree being felled, (prickly tree palm,) and the top branches lopped off at their junction, where the cabbage should be, an oblong cistern is cut out, four inches wide, nine long, and six deep. The broad bases of the leaves are laid over this ; the cavity fills, fermentation ensues, and in twenty-four hours a pleasant sharp beverage resembling cider results. If it be allowed to remain longer, it be comes bitter, contains more alcohol, and is less pleasant, and more intoxicating. It is sucked through a tube. After scrambling through much loose lava rock, which I was surprised to see the animals attempt, as it was entirely hidden by long grass, we reached our sleeping station at seven o'clock, where, having picked out the softest stone bed, and unrigged and tethered our animals, we made the most of our time, by devoting ourselves to the sleeping god. At dawn on the 10th, we remounted our steeds, and passed yet more difficult ground, until half past six, when we reached the lower line of \" the Pine range ;\" that tree observing a distinct height through out all these mountainous ranges. It became, therefore, a matter of interest to ascertain this elevation, which by barometric data is three thousand feet above the sea-level. Temperature at this time (before sunrise) 66\u00b0. Having tethered our beasts, we commenced the"], [219, "1838.] 163 THE CRATER. ascent a pied. The first efforts, owing to the long grass, were fatiguing, and the mate was hors de combat before we had reached half way. As we ascended, the grass failed, breeze freshened, and spirits rose, and at nine we had turned the crater lip. Our guides were certainly not at home at this work, and at this moment, when it was time to be observing, my hopes were nearly annihilated by the peak presenting itself on the opposite side of the crater, and apparently inaccessible without great difficulty. At first we descended to the edge of the inner cone, from whence I thought I discovered a narrow pass ; and it was only by dint of perseverance and determination that we could persuade the guides to re-shoulder the instruments and remount. Diffi culties vanished on gaining the lip, and we found a very comfortable and well-beaten track on an easy ascent, which the stray, or now wild bullocks, had prepared for us to the summit. I was fortunate enough to obtain all my observa tions, by which this position and its height were secured. It is five thousand five hundred and sixty-two feet above the mean tide-level, and two thousand five hundred and sixty-two feet above the pine range. Range of temperature during our stay (from half past ten until half past one) 77\u00b0*5 to 80M jSS^k<ms& unfortunate in the day. It blew fresh,, M 2"], [220, "164 [1838. SCENERY. (although calm at the base,) was hazy, and except ing high peaks and conspicuous headlands, I lost the most interesting minutiae. The volcano now consists of three craters. The outer is about five hundred yards in diameter, having the peak or highest lip on the western edge. Within, it is precipitous, from the peak to about one h un dred and fifty feet. From the inner base at that depth, the second inner volcano rose to about eighty feet, having within it another small cone, which is inactive. Around the western base of the first or inner, the cliffs rise precipitous, with pines growing luxuriantly from the vertical face of the precipice. Hot vapours arise in many points, and doubtless to this cause they are indebted for their peculiar healthy and luxuriant condition. No minerals worthy of carriage were observed. We had been informed that sulphur was abundant, but those who descended to look for it saw none. The temperature of the loose soil in the immediate vicinity of the upper hot spring, which exceeded the limits of my thermometers, I should estimate to be near the boiling point, probably 196\u00b0. It speedily warmed me to an unpleasant degree through thick boots. The view of the immediate neighbourhood was very beautiful, and fully repaid our exertions. The map of the country was at our feet ; even the main features of the lake of Managua were available. Myriads of field bugs and other insects pestered us,"], [221, "1838.] 165 DESCENT. and the breeze very speedily dissolved the enchant ment, by the introduction of a smoky haze. At half past one w*e commenced our descent, and at three remounted our steeds. About half past six we reached the farm at Moyotepita, after having felt the value of the precaution of our guides in preparing the toddy, for on our arrival at the spot our water had been long expended, and some were almost fainting with thirst. Mem. \u2014 People who ascend high mountains with weak heads and weaker stomachs, should reserve spirits for cases of neces sity only \u2014 as medicine. Having rested at Moyotepita until eight in the evening, we rode on to Chinandega, eight leagues, which we reached at one a. m., and at the house of our kind friend Vallejo, enjoyed a most refreshing sleep. At daylight, after a cup of coffee, we moved on to San Antonio, and joined our good friend Bridge and family at breakfast. I had made arrangements with Mr. Foster, our vice-consul, for the conveyance of a light boat to sound part of the lake of Managua, and examine the island of Momotombita within it, where report stated there were many objects worthy of attention, particularly the idols of the aborigines. Two of our lads were forwarded in her. Mr. Foster him- self had volunteered to accompany me, but business detaining him, he despatched his factotum (a young man who knew* the country, people, and language well,) as my cicerone. With this addition, and"], [222, "166 [1838. CITY OF LEON. our party as before, we set oft' at four on the morn ing of the 12th. The roads in this state (Leon) are all excellent, very level, and excepting where the rains have cut their courses, might be travelled in an English carriage. Bridges of course would obviate all diffi- \u00a9 \u25a0\u00a9 culty. At this season they were dusty, but the custom of travelling late in the evening, or early in the morning, prevented our feeling the additional inconvenience of the sun, although in many parts the roads are well shaded by trees. Passing through the small towns of Chichigalpa and Posoltega, we reached Leon at nine ; where, after throwing off our superabundant dust, we did ample justice to a good breakfast. Some difficulty arose with the authorities here, in consequence of the vice-consul having omitted to apprise all the authorities of my intentions ; but on my calling on the chief, matters were soon satisfac torily arranged, with offers of assistance if required. Observations were obtained in the garden of the college for fixing the position of the city, and others taken from the summit of the cathedral for further ing our operations. Leon is situated in latitude 12\u00b0 25' 30\" N., longi tude 86\u00b0 57' 45\" W. ; and the cathedral flat is two hundred and forty feet above mean-tide level ; the base may be considered one hundred feet less. Judging from the cathedral and churches now standing, as well as from the carving on doors and"], [223, "1838.] 167 RAVAGES OF CHOLERA. windows, sculpture, &c, of the ruins of the city, (destroyed in a late revolutionary struggle,) Leon must have been a city of great opulence, considera tion, and grandeur. So long as the old Spaniards remained, affairs prospered, for capital was not wanting; but they are now rare as one of their palaces, for such their ruins would bespeak them. Society has entirely changed, and become nearly native. The population is stated at thirty thousand, including the suburb Sultiaga, which almost entirely consists of huts inhabited by native population. Cholera has made great ravages in the states of central America during the last year, and particu larly in that of San Salvador. At Leon, three thou sand fell victims to this disease alone. It is a curious fact, and one which I suspected would result from my inquiries, that wherever I have been able to obtain positive information, it appears that the mortality has invariably been greatest on the S.W. angle, (or lee quarter.) This may in some measure be accounted for, by the preference which the better classes would take advantage of, by select ing more airy situations on the weather-side, where also the population would be less crowded. Their streets are wide, and mathematically regular ; and in the meridian and at right angles, presenting the appearance, from the summits of the mountain, of complete chequer boards. The lower orders suf fered most. My authority has generally been a padre or an official, aided by my cicerone, who"], [224, "[1838. 168 CATHEDRAL. appeased to be the friend of the state. Wherever he went, the pet term of Carlito, in an affectionate tone, was sure to welcome him. He had been employed trading throughout this state, and resident at times in each village in our route. The produce of Leon and its vicinity consists of sugar, indigo, maize, tallow, and hides. The \"* Chief of Estate \" resides there. Formerly it had a bishop, but a vicar at present officiates. The cathedral is large and very firmly constructed. During the revo lution, guns were, or were about to be, mounted on its roof, which, from its strong arches, would easily support them. The college is still maintained by the authorities, but I was unable to collect details respecting the establishment, &c. The pupils are educated for the church, law, physic, and state. I had intended measuring our meridian distance from Cardon by rockets ; but either they did not ascend well, or did not burst properly, therefore no definitive time could be noted. Having sent our party on before us at four, we waited until nine in the evening, when by the light of the moon we moved forward, and reached them at our rendezvous at Pueblo Nuevo about one, the distance being eight leagues, and the road good. This village contains about thirty huts. The chief employment of the inhabitants appeared to be the construction of earthen water-jars, \u2014 for which purpose the steatitic nature of the soil appeared to be pecu liarly adapted."], [225, "1838.] 169 PAPAGAYOS. At five the following morning, having reclined on a bedstead of stretched hide, with half a gale blow ing on my feet, and cold enough for 50\u00b0 N., we recommenced our journey to the lake of Managua. I am informed it always blows fresh, and at times very hard, in this neighbourhood. Indeed the strong gales termed \" Papagayos,\" from blowing out of the gulf of that name, commence about the line of Leon, and are first experienced off Cape Desolada, (about six miles to the eastward of Cardon,) and suddenly give way to calms after passing to the westward. This is doubtless the Atlantic \" trade wind,\" increased by induction through the pass formed by the lake of Nicaragua, and our neigh bouring mountains. It decreases about sunset, and attains its ordinary force about nine or ten in the morning. After a pleasant and easy ride we reached the margin of the lake (at Piedra Gorda) about ten o'clock, (the distance four leagues,) where we found our boat and crew awaiting us. We remained on the beach to determine the latitude at noon, and obtain other data, as well as to watch for a more favourable moment for launching our boat. About one, the sea having decreased considerably, we launched our bark, and freighted her, but it was soon evident that she could not carry us, nor could the crew make any progress ; and, as it was impossible she could reach any place of safety before dark, I instantly gave up this expedition ;"], [226, "170 [1838. ROAD TO MANAGUA. and loading the horses of my cicerone and self with the instruments, despatched the remainder of our party back, foreseeing that they would prove too great a clog on my operations, and that accommoda tion for more than two was beyond the scale of the huts we might touch at. We, therefore, pushed on for such villages as we might find on the borders of the lake, and thus define its outline as the nearest approach to the scene of our intended operations in the neighbour ing gulf of Papagayo, intending to make the junc tion or fall of this lake into that of Nicaragua at Tepitapa the extreme limit. At five we reached Nagarote, (a distance of five Spanish leagues in two hours,) and finding my strength fail me, we re mained for the night. Our host and hostess showed us more decided attention than we had before experienced, and begged, in the honest effusion of their hearts, that I would always make that house my rendezvous when I travelled that road ; being then ignorant that my road lay on the \" deep blue sea.\" Of course all this kindness I attributed to the presence of Carlito, who did nothing bnt play monkey tricks with the little ones from the time of our arrival. By five the ensuing morning we were en route for Matiares, (eight leagues,) which we reached at eight ; temperature 78\u00b0, noon 90\u00b0. Our journey over this tract presented some slight hills. After breakfast we proceeded to the beach, and obtained"], [227, "1838.] MATIARES. 171 satisfactory data, which places it in latitude 12\u00b0 14' 15\" N, longitude 86\u00b0 43' W. Matiares is a very small village ; population usually three hundred, but decreased one hundred by cholera. It is, however, generally healthy, deaths not averaging more than three or four in the year. No deformities were noticed. Its productions are cotton, maize, and plantains. I had been informed that a causeway formerly existed from the neighbouring beach to the island of Momotombita, (the diminutive of its neighbour Momotombo, nearly the same height as the Viejo,) and fortunately the place I had selected to observe at, showed the remains. Its direction is towards that island, and at the dry season a few years ago, when the waters were unusually low, it was dry for three hundred and sixty yards. As the only tem ples, (or caves,) idols, &c, alluded to, are on Mo motombita, it is more than probable that this cause way was for the priests, if it really extended so far; but, on the other hand, it is reported that fifteen fathoms surround the island. At two we moved forward for Managua, (six leagues,) which we reached'at five, the road being remarkably good and well shaded. Our animals were in better condition than their riders. About one mile before entering the town, we observed, for the first time, the Nicaragua wood, (C\u00e6salpinia echinata,) a great article of trade in this and the adjoining state."], [228, "[1838. 172 TOWN OF MANAGUA. We were fortunate in obtaining very decent accommodations. The town of Managua, from which the lake takes its name, is extensive, although not containing many built houses. The population, almost entirely native, consists of twelve thousand souls. The town is situated on a gentle slope to wards the lake, which washes close to its limits. A large church stands nearly alone at its eastern end, forming one side of what probably might have been intended for a square, but there is nothing attractive about it. At the corners of the streets several images, rudely carved in stone, were pointed out as the work of the aborigines. They are much worn, defaced by time, and merely serve as corner stones to the side paths. Managua appears to have suffered severely in the late cholera visitation, losing by it alone six hundred out of the population of twelve thousand. Of this number it is rather remarkable that females be tween the ages of fifteen and twenty-five, and prin cipally newly-married, were the predominant victims. Generally this spot is considered as peculiarly healthy, the average deaths seldom exceeding one per cent. I was rather amused at their custom of publish ing the bans or notices of marriage. The person who reads the notice is accompanied by two soldiers under arms, moving by beat of drum to the crossings of the streets, where it is duly proclaimed, very much in the style of our criers. The natives of"], [229, "1838.] 173 FALLS this place, either from less exposure, more frequent bathing, or difference of origin, appear to be better limbed, finer featured, and of a clearer complexion than those of the places we have passed through. They are athletic, without increase of bone at the joints, and of more prepossessing manners. At half-past three on the morning of the 15th, we set out for Tepitapa, the point where the Mana gua descends by its first fall into the waters of the Nicaragua, but distant from that lake fourteen miles. At starting the thermometer stood at 75\u00b0, but on pass ing through a deeply-shaded wood, just as the sun was rising, it had fallen to 61. The distance to Tepi tapa is estimated at eighteen leagues ; but this can not be correct. I should say that it does not exceed ten, as we reached the house of the padre at half past seven. After some delay we succeeded in getting breakfast. Inns or houses of entertainment do not exist ; the traveller must, therefore, put up where or how he can, and patiently await what follows. There are no waiters, or bells to ring. I notice this because I had anticipated a better reception from the fraternity, who not only gene rally take good care of themselves, but from being men of some little education, are more apt to extend the courtesies of life. After breakfast I procured a canoe, and by the aid of two inefficient boatmen, fearing momentarily to be immersed with my instruments, succeeded in reaching a point within the lake, from whence I had"], [230, "174 [1838. THERMAL SPRING. a fair view of the surrounding objects. After noon I returned and visited the first fall, which is about a quarter of a mile from the gorge of the lake. Here a mass of rock passes across, over which the water falls by an inclined plane eight feet. Below it the stream is spanned by a bridge about fifty feet in length. On the Tepitapa side a sulphur spring issues from the earth, at near the boiling temperature, and flows into the main stream. My thermometer was not graduated above 120\u00b0, therefore I cannot state more than that eggs were boiled in it and my sensation on putting my finger to it, satisfied me it was near two hundred and twelve. Crystallization was abun dant on the small stones between which it flowed, and some specimens I examined were a mixture of sulphur and calcareous matter. The taste was not unpleasant. It is deemed a sovereign remedy if taken by the advice of the padre, and much used both internally and externally. As he seemed to like neither me nor my instruments, he possibly mistook me for a poacher on his domain. The population of Tepitapa, which is but a small village, (distant twelve leagues from Grenada,) com prises five hundred souls, of which the cholera took off thirty ; but the average deaths range at ten per cent. The produce may be included under the heads of cattle, corn, and indigo. Nicaragua wood (termed Brazil) is cut on the north side of the stream and"], [231, "1838.] 175 CALENTURA. sells at one shilling per quintal. The bullocks are the finest I have seen in central America, and were offered at five dollars each ; but the cost of driving them to Realejo would make the whole amount to seven dollars each. Fish are abundant in the lake, principally perch. The Savola, or lake salmon of the tropics, is found, but not taken in any quantity. Alligators are also numerous. During the period of our stay, the temperature ranged from 84\u00b0 to 85\u00b0, 5' water 83\u00b0. Evap. 81\u00b0. At a quarter to four we quitted Tepitapa ; and our horses, apparently more anxious than even our selves to quit this inhospitable spot, carried us to our old quarters at Managua in three hours. After a fresh set of observations on the beach, we moved on at three the following morning for Matiares, where we slept ; and by noon the fol lowing day reached Nagarote. I was rather sur prised to find the doors and windows of our friend's house closed, and as deaths in this country are frequently sudden, began to augur ill. My cicerone, however, led the way through the gate, and we soon found that a calentura was the extent of the evil. However, as the gentleman was the sufferer, I very soon brought him to believe that he was not quite so ill, and eventually succeeded in removing the talismanic kerchief bandaged about his head. Before we took our departure, he was lively as on my former visit. I experienced the same kind at-"], [232, "[1838. 176 CHINANDEGA. tension, and on our parting at three for Pueblo Nuevo, this good couple evinced very strongly the warmth of their feelings. At sunset, we reached Pueblo Nuevo; and at dawn rode on for Leon, where we arrived at eight, very much fatigued. It being Sunday, and finding myself too much exhausted for travel, I took rest, and starting at four the morning following, reached San Antonio by eight, in time for breakfast. Here, also, I found our worthy host, Mr. Bridge, in bed, suffering under a smart attack of calentura, \u2014 one not to be talked away. These attacks appear to occur very fre quently, occupying about one third of the existence of the residents ; indeed, the term calentura is so indiscriminately applied to all affections of the head, that one is not so much moved by hearing of its presence, and I am satisfied in most cases that it might be overcome by resolution. I never knew it occur to any one but a resident. After breakfast we moved on to Chinandega. The population of this town is estimated at eight thou sand, and deaths by cholera five hundred ; general average one and a half per cent. All the towns are laid out similarly, in the right-angled plan, with streets north, south, east, and west. Probably this system originated by build ing the streets to correspond with the churches. In Chinandega, the centre of the town is pretty closely built, but on the outskirts the houses are"], [233, "1838.] 177 CHINANDEGA. mostly furnished with gardens, which keep them about forty or fifty yards asunder. The fences are often of bamboo, but more frequently of the cylin drical cactus, which runs up to twenty feet. The houses are generally built of the adobe, of one story, with an open court in the centre. The church is large, and a respectable building. The produce is chiefly maize, sugar-cane, cotton, fruit, poultry, and hides, collected from the neigh- bourhood. Coffee has been grown and produces well, but none has yet been exported. An American gentle- man, Mr. Higgins, has commenced the erection of a mill for dressing cotton, but I am perfectly satis- fied that its principle of action will fail. One failure will put the natives out of conceit of machinery, and thus, instead of introducing any useful improvement, he will considerably injure the interests of others. Even if he succeeds, I can clearly foresee that before he realizes sufficient to cover his outlay, he will become disgusted with the country and \u2014 government, I was about to say, \u2014 but may add under present prospects, \u2014 government there is none \u2014 property insecure. After dining at Chinandega, we remounted, and reached Realejo at three, and at half-past six I was once more safely lodged in my own cabin. One grievous annoyance attending travelling in this country is the garrapata, an insect of the tick spe cies, which is so abundant that if you brush a bush it is sure to shed a host upon you. They rapidly VOL. I. N"], [234, "178 [1838. GARRAPATAS. insinuate themselves under the skin, and are a per fect torment. Even for days after they have been entirely removed, sympathetic twitches are expe rienced, which are perhaps as great an evil as the reality \u2014 in some instances greater. It causes one's skin to contract even to write about them. During this absence of fourteen days we had travelled over a distance of five hundred miles, and I certainly felt my constitution considerably re freshed. Realejo is failing more from want of capital, and the insecurity of the present government, than from any want or field for speculation. The timber which might be exported from hence, in addition to those articles enumerated at the towns we visited, is of the best quality, not indeed for the ornamental work of cabinets, but for substantial house and ship services. The fol lowing list was prepared by a person well conver sant with carpentry, and has been added to by our botanical collector. Cedar of two kinds, one adapted for furniture, and the other for canoes. They are known to arrive at a diameter of nine feet, and are said to reach twelve. Mahogany, very compact, light and dark coloured. Roble ; in grain resembling oak and maho gany, some very handsome, of which I have the best specimen. Fir, tough, (Pinusserrotina.)

Granadillo ; \u2014 resembles rose-wood, but harder. On the 20th, as the Starling was yet absent, I determined upon the examination of the gulf of Papa gayo, and having completed our second tender, (the Victoria,) we quitted our anchorage, leaving my assist ant, Mr. George, in charge of the observatory, as well as with orders and provisions for the Starling. My principal object at this moment was to seek for and examine the port of San Juan, which spot I had been informed that a Mr. Bailey (employed by the government of Central America) had selected n 2"], [236, "[1838. 180 BAY OF SALINAS. as the point where the projected canal or railroad from the Nicaragua should communicate with the Pacific. After passing Cape Desolada, we began to ex perience the gusts from the lake of Managua, no high land intervening in its course ; and shortly the gale increased sufficiently to split a few of our sails, and reduce us to treble reefed topsails, courses, and trysails ; even this small canvass pressing her much. One whole day we remained at anchor, the squalls being too powerful to work in, and the necessary expenditure for so doing not being warranted by any equivalent. On the 3rd, by dint of persever ance, we reached the head of the gulf or bay of Salinas, (Bolanos of Bauza,) but had not observed anything like a river or port. Indeed, this term cannot be relied on throughout this coast. Wher ever a boat embarks cargo, the term port is applied. Having determined the position of Salinas Island in the centre of the bay, I left an officer (Mr. Speck) in the Victoria, to make a survey of the bay of Salinas, and proceeded with the ship to search for port Culebra, leaving orders for Mr. Speck to rejoin me at that rendezvous. On rounding the point in view corresponding to Point Catalina of Bauza, we discovered a cluster of eight islands. These I determined to examine, as they did not appear on the chart. They almost formed two distinct harbours, the smaller islands forming a crescent by the south, one large island"], [237, "1838.] 181 MARCIELLAGOS. protecting the east, and another of similar size form ing the line of separation. Passing into the bay we anchored in the inner or eastern harbour, and having fixed the positions, surveyed it, and com pleted water at a very convenient position, where we anchored in thirty-two fathoms, with a hawser fast to the shore. We quitted for Salinas, after having satisfied our selves that Culebra was not near us. The name of this remarkable cape, which we had mistaken for Catalina, is cape St. Helena, and the cluster of islands is termed Murciellagos, or Bat Islands. The springs are numerous and there are tolerable rivulets ; but only that which we watered at (between the centre point and the main) is safe to approach, by reason of the constant surf. We found the gulf squalls, even in this sheltered position, come down the gullies with great force, and impede our work as well as endanger our boats. In forty-eight hours, however, it was finished. The geological structure of the cape and islands is a schistose serpentine, containing balls of noble serpentine. As we could not fetch Salinas, I beat up to a posi tion where we observed a flag displayed, rockets fired, and a number of men and women in holiday garb collected; and, it being Sunday, we anchored for the day. The surf was too heavy to attempt landing, therefore we could neither fix our position satisfactorily, nor obtain information about San Juan, although I strongly suspected this to be the spot."], [238, "182 [1838. QUIT CARDON. On Monday we ran up to Salinas Bay, and then commenced the coast survey to Realejo, under very easy sail, anchoring for observations near noon as well as at night. Every nook was narrowly examined, but without success ; therefore I am satisfied that Sunday's posi tion, before noticed, was the port in question. On March 14th we returned to the island of Cardon, and to my mortification found that the Starling had arrived and sailed again in quest of us. As we had not found Culebra, I feared she might miss us and cause further delay. Here, therefore, I determined to await her arrival, as well as complete some necessary observations at the term day. I now found that my land trip had been most important ; the mountains, whose peaks I had fixed, securing our positions beautifully. In one point which I have marked upon the chart, no obstruction appeared to intervene from the sea to the Lake of Managua, and the peak of the island of Momotom bita was frequently used as one of our objects for fixing the positions. On the 20th of March the Starling returned, bringing but few letters ; and to cure general disap pointment, I determined on making another attempt for Culebra, in which we all felt interested. I felt satisfied that Bauza had not erred more than in position, and from the summit of one of the Mur ciellagos I had noticed features which I suspected were those of Culebra. Having embarked the ob-"], [239, "1838.] ENTER PORT OF CULEBRA. 183 servatory, stock, &c, and supplies of very excellent sugar and rum, which were obtained at a very reason able rate from the estate of Mr. Bridge, we quitted Realejo and our good friends there, steering for Cape St. Helena, and, on rounding it, direct for the spot where I suspected Culebra to be situated. At daylight on Sunday, the 25th of March, we were close off the port, but not being able to detect the Viradores, we wore, and intended running fur ther south ; as Relief had informed me that in his search for me he had been unable to find it. While in the act of wearing, a gleam of sunshine showed an island inshore, which induced me to make another attempt, and on reaching to wind ward we opended the heads and discovered the Viradores, but even then could only ascertain from the mast head that any recess of bay lay within. At noon we entered the heads, and at three anchored in eight fathoms in this splendid port, justly deserv ing that appellation. On landing, I met with some natives, who con firmed us in the name of the port. On Monday we commenced our survey, to meet that of the outer bay, entrusted to Kellett, which we completed in forty-eight hours. I now found that my conjecture respecting the position of the Viradores was correct. The sketch given in Bauza's chart can only be given from an eye-sketch or memory. The port is certainly magnificent, and from in formation derived from the natives, I learned that"], [240, "184 BRASIL WOOD, &C [1838 it is connected with Salinas, and thence on to Nica ragua, Granada, &c. If any railroad is contem plated in this quarter, it ought to enter at the Bay of Salinas, which would render these two ports im portant. When this portion of the country be comes settled, civilized, and more populous, I little doubt but Culebra will be better known, and pro bably the chief port of the state of Nicaragua. Water fit for consumption was not found at the beach, but may be obtained at a short distance up the creek, which a boat may enter at high water. If wells were dug, doubtless it would be found at the N. W. side, as the surrounding country is moun tainous. Another symptom in favour of this is the thickly-wooded sides and summits, as well as bright green spots of vegetation throughout the bay. Brasil wood is very abundant ; mahogany and cedar were observed near the beach, but as they have been employed cutting the Brasil, probably all the mahogany and cedar, easily attainable, has been taken. The geological features of this port differ much from any that we have met with on the coast. On the north side of the bay, resting on a hardened stratum of clayslate, a sandstone occurred containing organic remains ; of these, masses had fallen to the base of the cliffs, (about eighty feet above the level,) and were washed by the sea. In one I found large nodules of claystone dendrites. In the western parts of the bay, basalt occurred, with hornblende rock ;"], [241, "1838.] 185 PASS CAPE VELAS. and on the eastern side I met with shells enclosed in a solid rock formed by a concretion of magnetic iron-sand. Timber of great variety abounded. In the bay where the Starling was at anchor there was a large village, where the natives were anxious to dispose of their productions, consisting of fruit, stock, cattle, &c. On the 27th of March, quitting Culebra, we rounded Point Catalina, which from the disjointed portions, or islands, might have caused that of Murciellagos to be mistaken for it. We passed close to Cape Velas, so called from the rock being sometimes mistaken for a sail, and looked into Catalina bay. Here we lost the Papagayos. Therefore the limits may be considered to be included in a line drawn from Cape Desolado to Point Velas, and it is rather a curious phenomenon that the strength of this breeze seldom ranges so far as this chord, but seems to prefer a curve at a distance of fifteen to twenty miles from the land. We now* regretted the absence of these breezes, and made but slow progress to the southward, the currents pressing us to the eastward, and on the 30th even to the northward of the preceding day. Van couver notices this current also. Our destination was now Cocos Island and Callao. Bottles were thrown overboard daily to determine the course of these currents. One was picked up and forwarded to the consul at Panama, which exhibited a course from latitude 6\u00b0 16', longitude"], [242, "[1838. 186 CURRENT BOTTLE. 86\u00b0 18', west to Vedaci ; seven leagues and a quarter to the south of Mensabe, about ninety miles from Panama, having traversed a distance of five hundred miles in eighty-eight days, on an E.b.N. course at the rate of 5*6 miles per diem. On the 3rd of April we made the island of Cocos, and on the following morning observed two whale ships at anchor. The currents now drove us westerly, and as I saw little chance of getting the ship in until the afternoon, I started with my gig and tent, and secured my observations for time. In the afternoon the tide ran to the eastward, and the ship ran in under a light breeze, anchoring within the whale ships in nine fathoms, the rocks very clearly to be distinguished, with sand patches between. Our anchor was exactly on the line of foul bottom. On landing, I was surprised to find a hut and several seamen, one Portuguese, one English, and five blacks, Americans, landed by their own demand from one of the American whalers. At first I sus pected foul play, but on the masters of the vessels landing and stating the facts to me in presence of the men, they acknowledged \" that they preferred living on the island to sailing in his vessel.\" Their contract was only \" from the Sandwich Islands until they reached a port.\" They were evidently bad characters. Their only subsistence was fish, pigs, boobies, noddies, and other marine birds frequenting the island. Water is very abundant, and was easily conveyed by hoses into the boats. A survey of the bay and"], [243, "1838.] 187 REACH COCOS. part of the north side of the island was effected, and its position determined. The soundings off the island rather astonished our friends the Americans, who seldom use any line above thirty fathoms ; and the Starling having taking up two positions at anchor in fifty-six fathoms, at one mile and a half off shore, greatly facihtated our measurements. The triangles were extended by the ship and one cutter, and the dimensions on tangental limits determined. Wind and rain put an end to our labours. In Chatham Bay we noticed the rock mentioned by Vancouver, and left on another the Sulphur's name ; latitude 5\u00b0 33', N, longitude 86\u00b0 58' 22\", W, dip. 23\u00b0 55', and variation 8\u00b0 23' 49\" E., as determined by us. As the determination of the position of this island, as well as its dimensions, were included in my special instructions, (Vancouver stating it to be four miles, and Colnett four leagues,) I was enabled to put the matter beyond doubt. I suspect both were nearly right, and that if Ave read Vancouver four miles in diameter, and Colnett four leagues in circumference, the difference will be nothing. The record we have left will, I trust, assist seamen in rating their chronometers, and taking their de partures. But the whalers having cut all the wood fit for fuel, they can only reckon upon water. Our botanical collector observes : \" The vegetable productions of this island are more remarkable for"], [244, "188 [1838. BOTANY OF COCOS. their luxuriance, than either their richness in variety or value in cultivation ; a handsome flora, with but few peculiarities, consisting chiefly of those soft wooded plants generally inhabiting the moist regions of the tropics. The greater part of its productions are comprised in the natural orders of the Malvace\u00e6, Palm\u00e6, and the low tribes of Foliace\u00e6 or Crypto gamia. Bombax heptaphyllum is the largest tree which came under my notice : the wood of all the species is light and soft as in Malvace\u00e6. \"Hibiscus gossypinus and H.palmatus are abundant. Melastpma, a remarkably handsome genera purely tropical, is here represented by M. grosa and parvi flora. Of palms a few only are found here ; those which came under my notice belonged to the genus of Diplothemium, but were not in flower. A variety of cryptogamous plants abound, but few were in flower during our visit. The most deserving of notice is Diplagium auriculatum, a specimen of which I measured, and found the stem to be thirty-four inches in circumference ; unusually large for that species of fern.\" We felled one of the Bombax heptaphyllum, eighteen inches diameter and forty feet in length, intending to try it for boat plank. Its bark dyed our decks a deep red brown. Unfortunately it was thrown away before any experiments were tried on it as a dye. The wood split freely in the direction of its length, and M*as useless. Fish are abundant in Chatham Bay, but were not"], [245, "1838.] 189 CHATHAM BAY. easily taken at the ship. The whalers sent their boats daily to fish in the tide stream between the small island and the main, and were very successful. Shell fish were scarce, and few worth preserving. Boobies, (Pelecanus sula) and black noddies (Sterna stolida) were very numerous, and easily taken. The small white tern were plentiful, but kept to the trees, as well as the gannet and frigate pelican. A hawk and sparrow were the only land birds taken. The cocoa-nut has disappeared entirely from the eastern bay, but was noticed on spots (inaccessible by reason of the surf) to the westward. The western bay is subject to sudden rollers, particularly at low water, at which time the flat extends to a great distance. It is also more subject to calms, and consequently not so easy of ingress and egress ; and being exposed to westerly winds, watering at all times becomes difficult, and at low water is quite impracticable. Chatham, or Eastern Bay, possesses good anchorage ; a vessel may anchor within a quarter of a mile from the beach in six fathoms, (if requisite,) but the best anchorage is in twelve fathoms. There a constant draught will be experienced between the opening of the islets, and a vessel can generally enjoy the refreshing sea breezes, and fetch out at once, clear of the dangers, which are but few. It was not without surprise that I read Vancouver's opinion of this island, vol. iii. p. 369. The vieAv of the two bays, with the magnificent S.W. cliffs and"], [246, "190 WILD HOGS, &C. [1838. waterfalls, like silver threads, leaping from the richest and varied tints of green that can be imagined, would put a painter in ecstasy. Season, however, may make a material difference. The same objects we view and are delighted with in sunshine, are dreary and uninteresting in gloomy weather, (Mount Edge combe to wit.) There certainly is an entire absence of low country and undulation of hill, &c. ; but this, although a defect, does not take from other beauties. The thicket is not now impenetrable, as the self exiled whalers traversed easily from bay to bay. Goats are said to abound, but keep to the heights. Pigs are plentiful, and one large hog was sufficiently inquisitive to look into the tent at a distance of twenty yards. By reason of our magnetic opera tions, we were non-belligerents, or he would have paid for his temerity. The stream in West Bay produces fresh-water fish, but we could not obtain any. A curious bull head was taken, as well as fresh-water Crustacea, at our watering-place. Some of our men, who had landed to wash and amuse themselves, found their way up the hill east of the watercourse, and saw into the interior, which they described as a lake or large sheet of water. This would account for fresh- water fish in West Bay. The quantity of water we had noticed in streams, waterfalls, &c, and which were not much augmented by heavy rains, or by the stream in our immediate vicinity."], [247, "1838.] 191 VEGETABLES PLANTED. must be supplied from this lake. No rains could preserve the volume and equality for twenty-four hours. The soil about the beach was found to be a rich earth, but on the first flat above the sand, of a black rich mould, overrun by a convolvulus, which also ascended the trees near the water, and crowned them, producing a grove within, with a very pretty effect. I planted seeds of the mahogany, horse-chesnut, calabash tree, pumpkin, water-melon, Swedish and common turnip, large Russian radish, and pine tops. I also left a further supply with the people, with a request that they would appropriate any hogs which might attempt their destruction. I particu larly recommended to their attention the turnip and Russian radish, as a valuable remedy, or preventive, for scurvy. Before my departure I used every persuasion with the masters of the Americans to take these unfor tunate people away, as well as pointing out to the people themselves the misery they must endure, and the foul suspicions which the next vessel would entertain of their conduct ; but only one embarked. On the evening of the 6th of April, we drifted to the southward, and although signals were made by both vessels flashing during the night, and latterly by rockets and guns, the Starling was not to be seen at daylight, thus affording full proof of variety of current. We had cleared the south end of the"], [248, "STARLING DESPATCHED TO GUAYAQUIL. [1838. 192 island whilst the Starling was on the north. She was set westerly, and Sulphur easterly About nine she was observed dead on our lee-beam, when we bore up, and rejoined her. Wind and currents continued to baffle us much in our attempt to reach one of the Gallapagos islands, where our meridian distance might be important. On the 10th I despatched the Starling to Guaya quil, in order to bring away an officer, and some of our most needful supplies, left for us, at Puna, by H. M. S. Cleopatra, with orders to rejoin at Callao. We were now visited by heavy rains, during which the wind generally favoured us, but it was not until the 18th that we made Abingdon Island, one of the Gallapagos, and passed within two miles on its western side. We found the current setting strong to the northward and westward. On Saturday, the 21st of April, being in 0\u00b0 30', N., and about a degree west of the island of Albermarle, a course of experiments was made on the currents and temperatures, from 1000 fathoms, 600, 500, 400, 300, 200, and 100, to the surface ; being interesting as to their proximity to land, and within the influence of the Galapagos currents. Captain Fitzroy has remarked on the differences of temperature experienced on different sides of these islands. Orders were issued in consequence to watch narrowly, and hourly, for any change of tempe rature ; and this was particularly attended to in passing Abingdon Island. No perceptible change"], [249, "1838.] 193 ANCHOR AT CALLAO. was noticed; but on the 21st, when sending the water-bottle down, the temperature of the sea at one hour before sunset was 80\u00b0, 5, but half an hour afterwards 78\u00b0, 5 ; temperature at one thousand fathoms, 43\u00b0, 5. Baffling airs now distressed us considerably, re ducing our crew to short allowance of bread and flour; and on the 11th of May we had reached latitude 22\u00b0 S., longitude 1 04\u00b0 W., not a very great distance from Easter Island, and nearer Valparaiso than Lima. Here, however, we took a breeze which led us up to Pisco on the 1st, and on the 3rd of June, after an extraordinary passage of seventy-four days, we ran through the Boqueron and anchored in Callao roads, having been then four days without bread or flour.

The Chilian squadron, consisting of two large corvettes, two brigs, and a sehooner, under Commo dore Postego, were cruising off San Lorenzo, block ading the port; but as the combined officers repre senting the three nations, protested against its validity, vessels entered, with occasional detention. The force of the Peruvians amounted to one corvette, one brig, two schooners, and a few gun-boats, protected by the castles of Callao. On the 5th I had the pleasure of becoming per sonally acquainted with Mr. Wilson, her Majesty's charge d'affaires in Peru, to whom our department is very much indebted for his very active and decisive"], [253, "1838.] 197 LIMA. exertions in forwarding our views with this govern ment. Permission was immediately obtained to erect our observatory on the lines, and although the hostile squadron was constantly at hand, the further privilege of embarking and disembarking at all hours of the night was conceded, the parole and countersign being delivered on board daily by an officer. In reply to letters sent by Lord Palmerston to our consuls in the Pacific, special letters from the various governments, assuring me of every facility and assistance in my pursuits, were officially for warded to me by the respective consuls. On the 7th of June her Majesty's ship President, bearing the flag of Rear-admiral Ross, C.B., arrived, and anchored at Callao. Our refit commenced, but owing to scarcity of artificers and other delays, which I could not con trol, the 7th of August arrived before we got to sea. In the interim we examined the Boqueron Passage, which had been reported to have narrowed, and found that it was fully capable of affording a safe entry for ships of the line. Lima and its vicinity has been so frequently de scribed, that I shall not dwell upon this subject. I must, however, observe, that of the city itself and its streets and houses, I was not much ena moured. Viewed from the summit of San Christoval, one of my elevated stations behind the city, the whole coup d'\u0153il was splendid in the extreme. Lima was but like a chess-board on the table beneath us ; the"], [254, "[1838. 198 PERUVIAN DEWS. churches, cathedrals, &c, resembling the pieces. The stream of the Rimac swept silently round its walls, and soon lost itself in its meandering course to the sea. Our interest was more peculiarly ex cited by the castles of Callao, with the colours of Peru, bidding defiance to her enemy, whilst the ships of war of France, America, and England, with their brood of merchant vessels, lay deriding the assumed blockade. On the west was the island of Lorenzo, and to the southward the range of Morro Solar and bay of Chorillas. Between the 21st and 24th of June, the customary term observations for magnetism and meteorology were completed; but, although the transit instru ment had been in the meridian for eight weeks, I was unable to obtain the moon during the whole interval. The temperature during our stay, (from June to August,) ranged from 60\u00b0 to 79\u00b0, the mean, buried four feet beneath the earth's surface, being 74\u00b0. It is asserted that it \" never rains at Lima.\" In discovery ships, or vessels on scientific research, the law is \" believe nothing you hear, and only half you see.\" I know I heard very heavy pattering, and I saw heavy streams issuing from tops of houses and traversing the streets. The Peruvian dews, how ever, which afford the prevalent moisture of the season of our visit, are rather heavier than our \" Scotch mist,\" and this probably is more the visitant of Callao. where I did not witness heavy rain."], [255, "1838.] 199 CANYETE. It is strange that at a port where vessels are constantly undergoing repairs, heaving down, &c, not a copper bolt or nail (except sheathing) can be procured, and the marine stores in general are of a very inferior quality. The supplies of beef, vegeta bles, &c, for the ships of war ought to be good, but it is absolutely necessary to be a little scientific upon this point, and to be satisfied that the contract is duly fulfilled. On the 17th of August, having refitted as far as the resources of the place would admit, I quitted Callao, in order to examine the coast between Cerro Azul and Callao, a distance of sixty miles. We reached and anchored in the bay of Canyete on the 12th, and, after some doubt about the rollers, succeeded in landing, and delivered my letter from the Peruvian government to the chief authority, a military com mandant, (corporal,) who affected monstrous import ance, and intimated \"that the change of government rendered any document authorising my pursuits null ; but that courtesy amongst Caballeros of course permitted my doing as I pleased.\" A conclusion to which he plainly saw that I had already arrived be fore this last sentence, and his magnificence shortly oozed out. The state of the country, and the specimen I had just witnessed, together with duties which tied me to the beach, precluded my visiting the country. Cerro Azul, or the port of Canyete, is an open bay, in which landing at all times is very precarious."], [256, "200 [1838. ASIA ISLAND. But the nature of the coast affords great facility for constructing a breakwater, which would render this bay more deserving of the name of port. In its present state they contrive to embark sugar, which is produced in tolerable quantity in the fertile valleys of Canyete. These I overlooked from my station on the summit of the Cerro Azul, or about three hundred feet above the sea-level. The town or village consists of one house, one church or chapel, and a few huts, arranged on three sides of a square, the fourth open to the sea, with other straggling huts, amounting altogether to about twenty. Cerro Azul is a high, bluff, insulated clump, pro jecting into the sea, and at a short distance might be mistaken for an island. Its predominant colour is yellowish red. There are no objects of interest between this ami the Asia Islands, which are distant a few miles northerly, and are merely a patch of high rocks projecting about two miles to seaward, from a very flat sandy beach, having a channel carrying four fathoms, but well studded with rocks, which by daylight are easily avoided. Asia Peak is situated latitude 12\u00b0 47' S., longitude 76\u00b0 34' W., and its island is about half a mile long by a quarter broad, having no vegetation. There is good landing in a very snug bay on its eastern side, where a seal fishery has apparently been carried on at times. Between Cerro Azul and Asia Island the coast"], [257, "1838.] 201 SALINE SOIL. is dangerous, and landing generally impracticable, but the lead will always afford timely warning. A little to the northward of Asia Island is a deep bay, but neither here nor at any point, until reaching Chilca, could we find landing ; although we were informed that this could be effected at the river Mala. We did not see the river, nor anything like one. It was possibly screened by the surf. Chilca Point forms a sharp elbow in the land, making a very deep bay, in which a small town was noticed. A remarkable peak, called Devil's Peak, rises about three hundred feet perpendicularly, and forms the eastern limits. Northerly from Chilca Point three miles, lies the port of Chilca, formed by a large island, which enables vessels of small draught to lie in a complete dock, land-locked, the outer harbour having good anchorage in ten to four teen fathoms.* A small village of huts, with a chapel, is situated on the eastern beach of the inner harbour, and is appa rently merely the resort of fishermen. The people, probably mistaking us for Chilians, had deserted their huts. The whole soil is so entirely impreg nated with salt, that every stone has an incrusta tion of pure white crystalline salt on it, and in many cases I noticed that it cemented the stones together to a thickness of four inches, solid salt. This, of course, is of great importance to the fishery, * Her Majesty's ship President, from a tracing supplied, an chored at this port."], [258, "202 [1838. UNSAFE COAST. but a sad drawback to the seamen who may seek for water in this neighbourhood. A road runs through the valley of Chilca to the town in the bay before mentioned, where bright green tints afforded assurance of fertility. Between Chilca and Chorillas no landing on the coast could be effected, but I succeeded in gaining a position on the Great Pachacamac, an island of about four hundred feet elevation, from whence I com manded a view of twenty miles around. These islands are situated immediately off Lurin, and about two miles from the beach. The whole space between, up to the point of Morro Solar, is unsafe. Between the Pachacamac Islands and the main our shipping have resorted for anchorage. Lachira Bay, under the point of Morro Solar, (having been named as the rendezvous for British shipping, should the blockade of Callao be main tained,) became my next point of interest. Its character is summed up in few words. The bay is open, landing bad, (if practicable,) and anchorage untenable and even dangerous ; in proof of which we left there the fluke of our anchor. On the 25th of August we returned to Callao, having been absent eighteen days, out of which twelve were employed in the survey. Lima had fallen into the hands of the Chilians. The revolution in Peru had for some time been talked of, but so openly, that those unaccustomed to such changes did not credit that any actual mca-"], [259, "203 1838.] REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENTS. sures were in contemplation. General Nieto, an old officer under Gamarra, and then off the port in the Chilian fleet about to besiege Callao, had, it appears, held a communication with Gamarra, assuring him that on the retirement of the Bolivians (which he and Orbegoso would effect) and appearance of the Chilian fleet, they would throw off the yoke of the Confederation, and declare Peru free. The Chilians being slow in their arrival, and fear ing that their measures might be counteracted by the party of Santa Cruz, Orbegoso and Nieto, eight days previous to their appearance, (8th of August,) threw off the mask, and entered Lima with four thousand men, when the Confederation was de clared dissolved. General Miller, who held the castles of Callao, was requested to remain ; as was also Moran. The latter indignantly refused, carrying with him all the Bolivians, which thus effected Nieto's first man\u0153uvre. General Miller, rather than uselessly shed Peruvian blood, resigned the castles, and retired to the south, to watch the interests of Santa Cruz. On the 5th of August, the Chilian fleet, consisting of ten vessels of war, and twenty-six transports, arrived, and anchored out of gunshot. Garrido, the Chilian minister, landed, and proceeded to Lima. This was to gain time, having been apprised that their landing would be warmly opposed at Callao. The fleet, therefore, repaired to Ancon, landed the"], [260, "204 [1838. BATTLE OF LIMA. troops, and pushed their picqucts to the Boca Negra before night. On the arrival of the Chilians they declared, \" that they did not come to make war against Peru but against Santa Cruz,\" and wished the Peruvian army to join them, but upon conditions which the latter could not accept. On the 8th the Chilian army, five thousand strong, landed and advanced three leagues on the road to Lima. Garrido, having no credentials to present, retired to the Chilian camp. The Peruvians under Nieto and Orbegoso, amount ing to two thousand men, encamped two leagues from Lima, in the direction of Ancon. From the 9th until the 16th, pretended endeavours were made to conclude a treaty of peace, during which interval the Peruvians received an accession of force, consisting of two hundred men under the command of General Vidal. On the 18th the Chilians occupied the position of La Legua, half way on the road between Lima and Callao ; the Peruvians retiring into Lima. Hostilities commenced on the 21st. The Chilians advanced towards the N.W. side of Lima, where they encountered the Peruvians ; the engagement com mencing at four p. m. Much hard fighting ensued, and the Chilians, it is said, would have been repulsed had not General Loyola and Colonel Saldcas, by Nieto's orders, it is"], [261, "1838.] 205 CHILIANS ENTER LIMA. reported, withdrawn the cavalry, and sacrificed the infantry. At six the Chilians entered Lima by the bridge, and at eight had possession of the town. In this affair the Chilians lost three hundred killed, and had three hundred wounded. The Peru vians three hundred killed, two hundred wounded, and three hundred prisoners. During the night, Nieto, who did not enter the action, and who is accused of deserting his party, entered Callao castles, followed by seven hundred infantry. Orbegoso, who is reported to have behaved well, and was the last man to quit the bridge, retired three leagues to the south with the cavalry, and Vidal remained to the north of Lima, collecting stragglers. Previous to this, the Chilians by sea commenced firing on the castles of Callao, and cut out the sloop of war, Socabaya. The brig Fundadora was scuttled, to prevent her sharing the same fate. This was merely a proof of their sincerity in the non-declara tion of war ! On the entry of Gamarra with the Chilian troops, they sung Viva el Peru, &c, declaring that they did not make war against it ! On the 23rd, two thousand Chilians approached the castles of Callao, which were defended by Colonel Guarda, with six hundred artillerymen and sailors, and seven hundred infantry, but Nieto was without authority. At this moment we returned,"], [262, "[1838. 206 FEMALE CURIOSITY. and the preceding statement was kindly afforded me by a friend who kept notes of the proceedings. At the moment of our departure we had observed the Chilian fleet bear up for Ancon. A cabildo was now held, and Orbegoso (absent) named president. D. M. Salazar was then nomi nated, but declined the honour. A mock com mittee was then sent to Gamarra to request his compliance, when, after much pressing, he accepted the command, and was, I am informed, hooted in the palace. On the 27th, having obtained passports from both parties, I passed through the belligerents to Lima, where I found everything so quiet that I could hardly imagine war had taken place. Some of the ladies I visited had witnessed the action, from the Miradores, on the summit of the houses, and had seen the unfortunate infantry lanced like sheep, on the desertion of their own cavalry. All were loud in abhorrence of the treachery and cowardice of their leaders, and I am satisfied that had the com mand been entrusted to the softer sex, a very differ ent tale would have been told. By some strange freak of nature, the ladies of Lima seem to possess all the courage and energy of mind which should animate their protectors, and are dreadfully inveterate against any of their male relatives who are found wanting in the proper quantum of spirit, \u2014 using the strongest language without hesitation."], [263, "1838.] 207 PAYTA On the night previous to our departure, Nieto, Lafuente, and others, embarked on board a schooner, the officers in the castles declining, we understood, to allow them to remain. It was strongly reported that Nieto was embarked in the Sulphur, which our immediate departure seemed to confirm. Heartily sick of the occurrences at Callao, &c, and not having had opportunity for enjoyment either of the country or the customary gaieties of Lima, we quitted Callao, (not, however, without regretting many excellent and estimable friends,) and shaped our course for the Hormigas, where I was fortunate enough to land the morning following, and secure its position beyond any chance of future dispute. (Chronometers to the same second.) From thence we started for Payta, where we anchored on the night of the 2nd September, and on the day following secured our position. From Mr. Higginson, our worthy vice-consul here, we obtained every assistance and information, and en joyed ourselves much during our short visit. Payta is an excellent position for supplies of cattle, vegetables, or table necessaries, but, unfortu nately, does not abound in wood or water, for both of which payment must be made, and that exor bitant. We were fortunate in obtaining here some excel lent cordage, which is rather scarce on this coast ; very probably that exchanged by some of the whale ships which frequently touch here for supplies of"], [264, "208 [1838.

Quitting Payta on the 4th, we anchored off' Punta Espanola, in the island of Puna, at six a. m. on the morning of the 6th. This is the summer residence of Mr. Cope, our consul to the Equador, and where ships of war usually anchor previous to passing up the river to Guayaquil.

As Mr. Cope was absent at Guayaquil, I pro ceeded by the morning tide in my gig, accompanied by Kellett, and reached his house in time for break fast, when we were received with all the warmth and hospitality for which he is so justly famed. Although a great invalid, his activity of mind soon set aside all infirmities, and, breakfast ended, he insisted upon accompanying us to call upon the governor and military commandant, General Wright. The latter relieved our good friend from further labours that he would willingly have persisted in, and took us the customary round of visits to the fair goddesses of Guayaquil. I had heard the beauty, affability, courtesy, &c, of the ladies of Guayaquil rapturously extolled, and was certainly prepared to admire, and bow to general report. I have seen beauty, too, in our own country ; but the extreme formality there exhibited certainly cast a film over my eyes which shaded their perfections."], [267, "1838.] 211 GUAYAQUIL LADIES. We were received by the ladies in state, seated on a sofa or throne, in front of which a large carpet, or square rug, was spread. Etiquette forbids ap proach within the limits of the border. Their complexions, from never exposing them selves to the sun, are certainly very superior to those of the Limanians, whose brunette tint, viva cious spirit, and dark, full, speaking eyes, are infinitely more likely to endanger an infraction of the second commandment. I understand that the male relatives of these Guayaquilanean heroines have declared a civil war, upon the question of being kept at such a distance, and of rendering such absolute homage. Our time was fully occupied in embarking our stores, &c, and refitting, until the 25th September, when I carried the ship up to Guayaquil to embark coals, and complete other necessaries. As our worthy consul had some affairs of import ance to talk over with General Flores, previous to his journey to Quito upon an important official mission, and as it was not only right, but prudent, that I should become acquainted with the future president, as well as greatest general of the Equador, I determined upon accompanying him, to pay my respects, and such ceremonies as my ship, from her distance, was prevented from showing. Our party, consisting of the consul, General Wright, Lieutenant Kellett, Mr. Hinds, assistant surgeon, Mr. Richards, midshipman, and myself, p 2"], [268, "212 [1838. GENERAL FLORES. quitted Guayaquil in our pinnace on the evening of the 1st October, for Bodegas, and reached the house of General Flores on the evening following. Great rejoicings, &c, had just terminated, on the occasion of the saint's day of his wife, who also had just been confined of a daughter, who was christened Victoria, in honour of our queen. All, therefore, was in con fusion, but our reception was as warm as could be wished, and our treatment princely. Having brought up our saluting chambers in the pinnace, they were landed immediately below the general's house, where the boat's hull was hidden, and the colours of the Equador being displayed at our top-mast head, a salute of fifteen guns was fired, which shook the surrounding houses, and startled their inhabitants, no pendant having before been displayed or salute fired in Bodegas. The general, who instantly compre hended the compliment, expressed himself very warmly on the subject, through Mr. Cope. General Flores is about thirty-eight, slight, but remarkably well proportioned ; his countenance is in telligent and inquiring, and he appears to have studied hard to master every subject which reading and con ference with men of science could assist him to. For this country, he certainly is an extraordinary man, and when it is recollected that for his valour alone he has been designated by his republican countrymen \" The first citizen of the Equador,\" and is now about to resume the presidentship for the second time, it will readily be imagined that"], [269, "213 1838.] HIS ESTATE. more than ordinary activity and intelligence must have been his passport. General Wright, (an Irishman,) who was also his companion in arms under Bolivar, and subsequently served under General Flores, distinguished himself in Mina Rica, and several other actions. He as sisted ,, much in rendering our visit pleasant, and drawing out the general, who delighted in con versing on the various subjects of machinery, steam, &c, which he hoped to introduce, at his own ex pense, into this country. On the second morning we made an excursion through his estate, which is well stocked with cattle, and has been cleared to a very great extent by the dependants of the general, who being for the greater part old soldiers who had served under his immediate eye during the war, preferred living on his bounty, and doing their best to merit his protec tion. We breakfasted at a very neat and roomy farmhouse, about three miles from his mansion, where the viands, &c, had been previously for warded. We noticed great numbers of birds of fine plu mage, and shot several very interesting specimens, which were added to our collection. In the after noon we crossed the river to the town or village of Batahoya, which contains about two hundred houses. These, owing to the lowness of the situa tion, and occasional swelling of the stream, are generally elevated on legs, about six or seven feet"], [270, "[1838. 214 BULL FIGHT. above the ground. I am told that at times they visit in boats. The novelty of a bull-fight was the principal in ducement to this visit. I am not at any time much interested in such matters, but the present exhibi tion was entirely devoid of interest. The animals were not disposed to be excited, nor were the actors particularly anxious to display their prowess. But to return to the farm : when the general pro ceeds to Quito to assume his functions as civil magistrate, the house, farms, and sugar-mills, will be t ransferred to his present aid-dc-camp, Colonel Ponti, who will pay a rental of 10,000 dollars per annum during the four years of his presidency. But I much doubt that the same content or success will result, under a less vigilant and popular man than the general. The dependants who cheerfully earned their subsistence under his control, will now require wages ; and to support so large an establishment will very soon strain the proceeds below the means of paying so large a rental. After experiencing the most marked civility from our kind host, and an earnest request that our intimacy should not end here, we parted, greatly delighted with our excursion. Our passage up may be said to have been almost in the dark ; I omitted, therefore, to dwell upon the river and its banks. At the present season the tides flow within nine miles of Bodegas, and therefore the ascent is easy ;"], [271, "[1838. 215 BALSAS. but in the rainy season I am informed the freshes are very strong, the stream frequently rising so far above the ordinary level as to flood the streets of Batahoya, and the farm-houses on the banks. The houses, constructed as before noticed, are therefore only tenanted on the first floor, and appear like bird cages on legs. The river is fresh as low as Guayaquil, (and even lower ;) but the water even there is not considered fit for consumption ; consequently, the greater part used for drinking is brought down the river in earthen jars, containing about seven gallons each. These are compactly packed on Balsas, \u2014 which are rafts constructed of ten logs of wood, from twelve to fourteen inches in diameter, and sixty feet in length. The wood used for this purpose, a bombax, has obtained the name of balsa wood. They are calculated to bear a pressure of fifteen to twenty tons, independent of the men required to navigate them, and to this amount they are generally laden. On these Balsas, houses are also constructed, vary ing from thirty to forty feet in length by twelve wide, and in such conveyances whole families are transported to Bodegas and other places. These we observed at Batahoya, and we were informed that some continue to make them their residence during their visits from home. Many we observed were thus inhabited, and also I noticed their tenants bathing'; but where alligators are so numerous it must be attended with risk."], [272, "[1838. 216 NUMEROUS ALLIGATORS. Others travel more expeditiously by the canoa de pieca, which derives its name from being a canoe built, instead of hollowed out of a single tree. One of these will contain one hundred persons : it is furnished with an arched housing at the stern, with sufficient shelter for hammocks &c, for one family. They are also used for the conveyance of troops. The vegetation on the banks of the river is very luxuriant, and studded with small sugar plantations. The farm-houses perched amongst them appear neat and comfortable, but on a closer inspection, have not much to induce one to seek their shelter. Alligators are very numerous ; forty-seven of one swarm were counted before they glided down the mud into the river. None were under ten feet ; they were mostly estimated at fifteen to eighteen, and some were monsters. The peculiar sound, of closing the jaws with a noise resembling cluck, is anything but musical. We were assured that these were nothing to what we should have seen had we passed through the Estero de Lagartos, (or Alligator Creek,) that there we should have encountered them in myriads. About noon, it being low water, and the tide against us, we landed, to afford our men time to dine, take a run, and regain their wind. Here we had an opportunity of noticing one of the small farms, and their tenants, who ajipear to be far from easy in their circumstances. Their rude"], [273, "1838.] 217 SUGAR MILLS. machinery for crushing the cane, sufficiently denotes their want of ingenuity and exertion amongst them selves ; at the same time it becomes very apparent what enormous advantages would accrue from the introduction of machinery and engineers. In the loss of the example of such a man as General Flores at this particular moment, and for a period of four years, I am induced to fear that the evil results here will not be sufficiently counterpoised by his duties to the republic. There are moments when master minds are imperatively called for to guide the helm of state ; but in quiet times it is pos sible that such powers might be more beneficially exerted in a smaller sphere ; and this too is still more apparent when the elevation does not give the command of resources by which such abilities can be called into play for the general good. The rise and fall of the stream itself might very easily be taken advantage of ; mills might be erected on a small scale, and the simplest of their kind would open the road for a greater demand, as well as for those of superior construction, \u2014 even to steam. The natives are as yet but children in these matters, and until they learn the use and value of machinery as toys, the magnitude and com plication of greater undertakings will deter them from approaching them. We shot several varieties of birds, aud at one spot, without moving from beneath the same tree, no less than ten humming birds were obtained."], [274, "218 [1.-MJS. QUIT GUAYAQUIL. The flood did not run long, coming in and ex panding its force almost at a gush ; we, therefore, resumed our progress, and about four passed the town of Samborodon, the half way, or resting spot from Guayaquil, probably from its being the only village where supplies for a large party can be ob tained, as well as the home of most of the boat men. The appearance of the town is improving ; but its inhabitants being entirely coloured, and not otherwise interesting, we preferred using our best exertions to reach Guayaquil before the change of tide. This we effected by ten that evening. From the foreign consuls, as well as from our kind friend General Wright, we met with every attention, and our affairs at Guayaquil being com pleted, we took leave of them on the 30th, tak ing with us our good friend the consul, and with out kedging beat and backed through the narrows without accident, reaching our old an chorage off Punta Espanola on the morning of the 4th. H. M. S. Harrier had called during our absence, on her way to San Bias and the Gulf of California, to collect freight, but only remained forty-eight hours; consequently I had not an opportunity of seeing my good friend Captain Carew. By my letters, I found that affairs in Peru were in statu quo at Callao. Nieto, Lafuente, &c. had landed at Payta, and a Chilian force had attacked"], [275, "1838.] 219 CAPTURE AN ALLIGATOR. it. The two former retired on receiving about 2,000 dollars, and had arrived at Guayaquil before our departure, but unnoticed by the authorities. Sub sequently, the Chilians refusing all terms with the inhabitants of Piura, marched against them, beat them, and after capture, barbarously murdered the captain of the port of Payta, and committed other excesses. Our stay at Puna enabled us to collect several varieties of birds, shells, and animals. In one of my excursions, observing an alligator of twelve feet asleep on the beach, and suspecting him to be dead, I passed the lead line under his nose and jerked it round his throat, taking the precaution of giving the other end, similarly passed, to two of the boat's crew. Rather to my surprise, he snapped his jaws, and made for the water, but a turn of the line round a rock considerably increased the pressure round his throat, and he was securely taken to the boat. After towing him a considerable time, and believing him to be drowned, we tried to get him into the boat, and had nearly succeeded, when he made a snap at the gunwale, and tore a portion of it away. We immediately decided that he was not fit society, and towed him astern. After having been landed for some time, the boat's crew commenced the operation of skinning him, considering him quite dead. Indeed, his stomach had been some time exposed, and the skin laid open to the tail on both sides, \u2014 when by a sudden convul-"], [276, "[1838. 220 LIBERALITY OF THE GOVERNMENT. sion he snapped his jaws, and included both hands of one of the crew, (who was sitting on his head to steady him,) cutting through several fingers, but fortunately without injuring any bones. The in stant the country people saw him they exclaimed, \" Patos, patos,\" \u2014 intimating that he was a well-known connoisseur and purloiner of fat ducks. Having completed our wood, water, &c, we took leave of our hospitable friend the consul, with very great regret, for I am certain there was not a man belonging to our establishment who did not feel his kindness in some shape. We directed our course for Panama, the Starling, as usual, having the Victoria under her wing. I cannot quit this port without mentioning the very handsome conduct of this government relative to our stores. On their arrival in H. M. S. Cleopatra, and it being reported that they were intended for this expedition, (special directions having already been issued to afford us every assistance,) the autho rities consented to their being landed at Mr. Cope's private stores at Puna, where there is no officer of customs ; and on Mr. Cope's sending the keys of two locks placed on them, they were returned with a very handsome message, and a rebuke to the inferior officer for receiving them. Part of these supplies consisted of articles contraband at this port, and these were in very large quantity. On entering the fifth degree of north latitude, we began to experience the rains, the winds at the"], [277, "1838.] 221 YSLAS DEL REY. same time pressing us to the eastward, which de layed us considerably. Vessels ought to endeavour to reach Point Mala, and go up between the Oto gues, Taboga, and the main, on the western side of the Gulf of Panama. I think we lost three days by not following that route. On the 17th we reached Taboga, where I landed to obtain time, and at twelve the same night anchored off Panama. In the morning I called on our new consul, Mr. Cade, late of the Bogota mission, but not finding our anticipated despatches, and the mail not being due until the 20th, I moved the ship to Taboga, to complete water, and make sundry observations which the more frequent showers at Panama, and the distance from the shore, rendered inconvenient. On the 24th October, Mr. Cade forwarded our despatches by his servant, and the day following we returned to our old anchorage off Panama. Mr. D. Gordon, Mid., of the Starling, having suffered severely from the climate, was sent home by the return mail, with our gleanings since February 1837. As it became an object to ascertain the state of the Yslas del Rey (now the Islands of Columbia,) and to make up my mind as to the selection of stations, should my time admit of connecting them with Panama, I ran over to the island of Casalla where we could also witness the pearl fishery in full activity. Our good friend the consul accom panied us, and we there had an opportunity of test-"], [278, "EXERTIONS OF THE PEARL DIVERS. [1838. 222 ing the powers of the most expert divers they could produce. The depth on which they usually fish, is about five or six fathoms, the bottom uneven and rocky, or stony. The boat, in the present instance, being anchored in a tideway, the padron commenced by repeating prayers, in which he was joined by the rest of the crew, amounting to seven. This ended, they divested themselves of superfluities, and almost simultaneously inhaling a long breath, dived feet foremost. The average time of immersion ranged from forty to forty-two seconds, and on reaching the surface, they had generally seven or ten oysters each, about the size of a cheese plate, packed from the left hand to the left shoulder, four being firmly secured be tween three fingers and thumb ; all this is effected under water. Upon offering rewards for those who could re main longest under water, we were only able at first to witness seventy-six seconds. But after a little practice, the padron remained beneath the surface ninety-six seconds, bringing up seven oysters from the depth of seven fathoms. From what we Avitnessed of his exhaustion, and the reports of others who repute him their best diver, I am strongly inclined to doubt the suspension of breathing, with poiver of e\u00e6ertion, for a longer period. The fishery is carried on at their own expense and risk ; they either sell the oysters, and open"], [279, "1838.] 223 NOVEL GAMBLING. them in the presence of the purchaser, at a real or less per dozen, or take the risk themselves ; in fact, a novel species of gambling has arisen, in which many of us indulged without adding to our wealth ; completely the reverse, for many of us, ashamed to have nothing to show, purchased pearls. One exception, however, occurred in the consul's servant, who turned up a prize worth, I was told, about forty dollars. I examined the collections of several dealers in these articles, who reside here in readiness to purchase dur ing the diving season. Some were enormous, as large as nine tenths of an inch long, by five tenths diameter, but pear shaped, and of bad colour. Indeed, none that I saw would be reckoned fine in England, and amongst some thousand large ones, very few were perfectly round. The Yslas del Rey cover about four hundred square miles, and comprise numerous islets, and probably thirty or forty fishing villages. The quan tity of pearls estimated at the season, is about two gallons. Having returned to Panama, and landed the consul, we sailed on the 1st of November for Realejo, intending to verify the longitude of the Cocos in our route ; but the heavy rains which we encountered in that direction, added to oppressive atmosphere and tendency to sickness, soon changed my plans, and every effort was made to make northing, and clear these unpleasant latitudes."], [280, "[1838 224 REACH REALI.IO On reaching the latitude of 8\u00b0 40' N. the cessation was abrupt.

On the 14th of November we reached Realejo, where the effects of the rainy season were still ap parent, the residents informing us that the season had terminated only oa the 4th. The 1st of November, then, may be safely assumed as the termination of the rainy season at Realejo. Our stay here was but short, being anxious to commence the survey of the Gulf of Fonseca; and our consul, Mr. Foster, having consented to accom pany us, and act as pilot to Conchagua, we quitted Realejo on the 17th November, anchored off the water ing-place, Chicarene Bay, at nine on the morning of the 19th, and after obtaining observations on the point, proceeded by boat to La Union, (or San Carlos,) the town of the port of Conchagua, pro perly so called. Here we found seven vessels at anchor, having brought cargoes for the fair at San Miguel, situated about forty miles in the interior, and at the base of the volcano of that name. As reports were in circulation that the insurgent Carrera contemplated disturbing the proceedings,"], [283, "1838.] 227 FAIR AT SAN MIGUEL. and I moreover, the property at stake being chiefly British, I determined visiting the fair in my route to the volcano, which I contemplated ascending. The presence of the consul, officers, and myself might have an influence on his actions. However, on the eve of our departure, I had the satisfaction of learning from San Salvador, that he had been routed by the forces of the President Morasan, and was pent up in the mountains. On the 19th, at six p. m., our party, consisting of the vice-consul, Mr. Foster, Lieut. Wood, Mr. Hinds, assistant-surgeon, and Mr. Selwyn, Mid., commenced our journey on very indifferent animals, the great demand leaving us no choice. For the first stage our road lay through very uneven ground, which the darkness did not improve ; and to the discomfiture of our junior, he suddenly found himself, by the failure of his animal at a leap, \"rather ahead of his reckoning,\" and head downwards, in a pool or brook : he was fortunately extricated without injury. It was intended that we should rest \" in campo \u2014 \" the customary mode in this country. But estimat ing, from the present condition of our beasts, what they might be able to effect on the morrow, under a broiling sun, I determined to push on another league and a half, and rather sacrifice my rest than risk the fatigue of dragging my mule. We, there fore, moved on and reached Agua Frio at one, and after considerable trouble succeeded in obtaining Q 2"], [284, "[ L838. 228 SHOW CATTLE. shelter and supper I believe I was the only one who had a roof over me, but had little reason to rejoice in this particular, as \" las pulgas\" assured me toll must be paid for such indulgence. About four, our guides commenced saddling, and we were soon once more en route. The tempera ture during our stay ranged to 56\u00b0, and at the mo ment of starting, we enjoyed, with some few shivers, a fine cool air. Our journey now lay through the mountains, the road being tolerable for mules. About nine, we reached the outer circle of the city of San Miguel, which at this period was occupied by a dense belt of about a mile of show oxen, horses, sheep, &c, the owners, drovers, or proprietors, having erected tem porary houses amongst the trees on either side of the road. Many had brought their beasts to a bad market. Here I met my old friend and host of Nagarote, as before alluded to, who informed me that he could only obtain five dollars per head for show beasts, which he could sell at home for six, and this after driving, feeding, &c, upwards of five days' journey ; in this country almost equal to their value. As they came for goods, it is not improbable that the intrinsic returns were of greater value than the hard six dollars. Having passed through the cattle fair, and forded the river, which passes about half a mile on the skirts of the town, we entered San Miguel, and"], [285, "229 1838.] START FOR THE VOLCANO. found the heat, dust, and clatter, almost Babylonian. After considerable exertion, and forcing our way through dense crowds by the most circuitous passes, we at length reached the quarters of our allies, who were just commencing breakfast. As our despatches had not arrived, our appearance was rather a sur prise, although welcome ; and great bustle and activity were displayed to evince their sense of the addition to the alliance, particularly from our old friend, Mr. Bridge, of Realejo, who little dreamed of our re-appearance in Central America, when we took leave of him in March last. Having called on the military governor and com mandant, who received us very politely, and of fered every assistance in his power, we returned to watch the movements of the fair, and make the necessary arrangements for ascending the volcano, that was majestically towering immediately above us, and apparently easy of access. But on this side it is impracticable, and some leagues must be tra velled to gain its rear at the only point at which it has ever been attempted with success. The governor, having assured me that there was not the slightest difficulty in the ascent, and that not long since an Englishman had succeeded in his attempt, furnished me with an order to the alcalde of Chinameca, six and a half leagues distant from San Miguel, directing him to furnish guides, men to clear the road, and to afford us every assistance. Thus duly prepared, we started with light spirits on"], [286, "230 [1838. ARRIVE AT CHINAMECA. the morning of the 23rd ; our party, Lieutenant Kellett, Mr. Hinds, and myself. Passing through the village of Guelapa, two leagues, and Moncagua, three leagues from Sun Miguel, we entered Chinameca by a very steep descent at four in the afternoon. The view descending this most picturesque valley, induced us to believe that the volcano might easily be ascended for some distance by mules. A rather ominous delay prepared me for difficulty. A council of the village was summoned, and after their deliberation, the alcalde, ranging them before us, acquainted us that the road had been closed, and entirely broken up and choked by the last terra niotu ; that it could only be opened at a great ex pense and delay ; and he threw such further ob stacles in the way, that I clearly foresaw I could not rely on him or his agents ; and as days were ages to me in value, I determined to employ my time to more advantage, by returning to the city the instant our beasts were in condition to move. I was still further disappointed by the difficulty we experienced in obtaining food for our beasts or ourselves, or even the common civilities afforded to travellers. About midnight we remounted our mules, and after losing our way several times, at length reached the village of Moncagua at sunrise, where we were more fortunate in obtaining an excellent breakfast in the style of the country, consisting of eggs, tor-"], [287, "1838.] 231 INDIGO TRADE. tillos, chocolate, cheese, and milk, to which we did ample justice ; and about ten reached San Miguel, much to the astonishment of the party we had left to watch our motions, who were anxiously straining their eyes, and frequently waving our signal-flag, momentarily expecting to trace us on the outline of the volcano. The governor assumed the feeling of chagrin (which no doubt he felt in his way) at the conduct of the alcalde, but I could plainly trace an apathy, which satisfied me that his power over him gave him no right to resent such uncourteous reception as attended his letter. Our attention was now directed to the city, and the great fair then at its meridian. San Miguel is situated on a plain at the base of the volcano, which suddenly springs on this side to its apex ; and is surrounded on its other sides by ranges of five to six hundred feet above its level, entirely excluding it from any prospect beyond their outlines. There is nothing in the city itself which calls for remark, and its consequence arises principally from the fairs held here for the purpose of transacting the indigo trade. The fair at this season is that of most importance, as the \" settling period,\" and may be compared to any of our great English fairs divested of their amuse ments and trifles. The visitors, however, in this case, come not only from the remote points of"], [288, "[1838. 232 THE FAIR. Central America and Mexico, but also from Southern America, as low as Valparaiso, and even from Europe. The great square, houses, and streets, are all closely occupied by booths, &c, containing every species of goods exposed for sale, and it was not without some degree of satisfaction I observed that the majority of capital was British. A few French light goods and trifles occupied some of the booths, but Manchester, Birmingham, and Sheffield carried the day. The method of dealing throws some light on the character of these people, and the risks annually incurred. Goods to a large amount are given on account, to be paid for in indigo, at a certain periods generally the meeting of this month. Indigo varies considerably in value, numbering from one to nine and ten, and at this meeting its currency is determined. Thus, the actual bargain is completed, by the payment in current indigo at this fair for goods supplied last year. At this moment, when the states have divided, when they acknowledge no supreme authority, and when might may be right, \u2014 what volumes does this confidence adduce for the general probity of these dealers, who are men too not always above the middle classes\u2014 mere peasants. On the cholera visitation, as might have been anticipated, losses did occur; but one or two noble"], [289, "1838.] 233 SEPARATION OF THE STATES. traits of just feeling are also mentioned, where the payment was cheerfully and duly made by parties not legally liable. Where such immense property is at stake, it is generally considered necessary to turn out the military, and during day and night sentinels parade the square and main streets. After nine o'clock no one is permitted to traverse the streets without au thority ; and although the main square is occupied by at least one-third pulperias and gambling booths, where they also sleep en masse, I never witnessed so little noise or disorder in any part of the world. Having mentioned the separation of the states of Central America, I will give a slight sketch of their present condition. About a year ago disturbances commenced, having for their object the removal of the President Mora san. A short time afterwards, Carrera, the leader of the insurgent party, made head, and inculcated the idea of the separation and self-government of the several states, with greater personal freedom. This has certainly taken effect, and the states at present separated comprise San Salvador, (with the president,) Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica, Ni caragua, and lately Los Altos, of which Quesan tenango is the chief city. Each state is responsible only for itself, or is in fact at present headless. Costa Rica and Nicaragua are preparing to resist Morasan, or even to pursue him ; but this will never take effect. Under such"], [290, "234 [1838. CONCHAGUA. government the appeal to law is futile ; a decision in favour of an appellant was adjourned sine die, as I lately witnesed at Realejo, and nothing but a hint of stronger measures likely to ensue on the part of Great Britain, brought them to their senses. The appellant was a British subject, and judgment was given in his favour before the separation of the states. On the 25th, we set out on our return to San Carlos, situated on the south side of the port of Conchagua, and better known by that name. The site of the port is badly chosen, as the difficulty in landing at all times is great, and at low water nearly impossible ; during strong northerly winds the communication is frequently cut off for days, in dependent of unsafe holding-ground for shipping. Near Chicarene this might have been entirely avoided. The port is entirely land-locked \u2014 in fact a com plete inland sea. The actual town or village of Conchagua, from which the port derives its name, is situated about three miles up the Amapala mountain, or extinct volcano, immediately over San Carlos. The selec tion of this spot is said to have originated in the piracies committed on this race of Indians by the buccaneers. They were then located on the islands of Conchaguita and Manguera, situated at the mouth of the gulf. They then fled to this secluded spot of Conchagua, which is destitute of water, that necessary of life being daily carried up in calabashes."], [291, "1838.] 235 ASCEND AMAPALA. The Indians are rather a well-formed race, and of a lighter cast of countenance and milder manners than their neighbours. Our next excursion was to the volcano of Ama pala, situated immediately above the port, and which has been extinct beyond memory or tradition. About four in the evening of the 26th, Lieutenant Kellett and myself quitted San Carlos, and reached Conchagua about eight. The road being very steep, how the mules contrived to pick their way, I am at a loss to imagine : by daylight it was no easy task. Having procured guides and calabashes of water, we con tinued our ascent until ten, when having reached a position sheltered from the strong winds then blow ing, we took up our quarters in the grass until day light, when we recommenced our journey, reaching the highest pine point about seven. As this did not suit for a trigonometrical station, we shifted to a peak, overlooking and commanding a view of every point in the gulf. Our operations on the summit were uninteresting, excepting in a magnetic point of view : they are recorded under that head. No remains of volcanic agency are to be traced ; and it is probable that its conical form alone assigned to it the appellation of Volcan de Amapala. At its base, in Chicarene Bay, incrustations of sulphur and muriate of soda were observed, as well as several thermal springs, the temperature of the hottest af fording 196\u00b0 in the steam, and 212\u00b0 in the jet. Bottles of this water were preserved."], [292, "[1838. 236 EXAMINE ESTERO REAL. The result of our barometric measurement gave the Peak of Amapala three thousand eight hundred feet above mean-tide level. The temperature on the summit at sunrise 63\u00b0, that at San Carlos being 86\u00b0. On the 30th of November, we returned to Realejo to rate our chronometers, where we met her Majesty's ship Imogene, at the moment of her departure for San Bias, having been some days on the look-out for us. The letters brought by her were not of interest, being duplicates of twelve months date. After an absence of only forty-four hours, we reached our anchorage again in the gulf, and vi gorously prosecuted our survey, which was uninter esting in detail. At the term day, we pitched our observatory near the sea margin, at the base of the volcano of Conseguina or Quisiguina, and having completed the requisite observations, started with the Starling and boats, to explore the Estero Real, which I had been given to understand was navigable for sixty miles ; in which case, from what I had seen of its course at my visit to the Viego, it must nearly communicate with the lake of Managua. After considerable labour, we succeeded in carrying the Starling thirty miles from its mouth, and could easily have gone further, had wind permitted, but the prevailing strong winds rendered the toil of towing too heavy. We ascended a small hill about a mile below our"], [293, "1838.] 237 SWARMS OF MOSQUITOS. extreme position, from which angles were taken to all the surrounding peaks. From that survey, added to what I remarked from the summit of the Viejo, I am satisfied that the stream could have been fol lowed many miles higher, and I have not the slightest doubt that it is fed very near to the lake of Managua. I saw the mountains beyond the lake on its eastern side, and no land higher than the in tervening trees occurred. This, therefore, would be the most advantageous line for a canal, which, by entire lake navigation, might be connected with the interior of the states of San Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and extended to the Atlantic. Thirty navigable miles for vessels drawing ten feet, we can vouch for ; and the natives and residents assert sixty more : but steamers will be absolutely necessary to tow against the prevalent breezes. Our men began to suffer severely from the bites of mosquitoes, which, after the day's toil, prevented their obtaining rest; and the lofty trees on the banks impeding any further efficient explora tion towards the source, we commenced our survey downwards, which, aided by the strong breezes and tide, I was enabled to execute, from the Starling's foretop-gallant yard, in six hours. I cannot comprehend why, with these plain facts to lead them, (and I know of many clever residents amongst them, none more so than Mr. Bridge of San Antonio,) so much time and money should have been expended in searching for other lines of communi-"], [294, "238 [ Is:}*. CANAL QUESTION. cation, when nature points out that this should first have been attempted. It is possible our sworn enemies the mosquitoes may have something to whisper in the affair ; but this is of trifling importance to residents. I am satisfied that they would have disappeared as we advanced. It is rather a curious fact that it was directly in this vein to windward that we were attacked on our journey to Moyotepita in March last. The evil, I must candidly allow, is of sufficient importance to our service to mar it entirely. The caprices of seamen are at times too strong to be controlled, and in the present instance one could not work with satisfaction, knowing that those around were suffering even from such diminu tive enemies. Zeal may carry heads of departments through incredible difficulties, and even make them smile at them, but it cannot be looked for in the uninterested subordinates. Setting aside, however, the canal question, or communication between the Atlantic and Pacific, I am satisfied that steam communication with boats of light draught, by this Estero, that of Honduras leading behind Tiger Island, as well as that above San Carlos towards San Miguel, (vide chart,) is of sufficient importance to justify the primary attempt, as a feeler, in order to ascertain what ad vantages may result to the greater undertaking. If these branches cannot supply shipping at Conchagua with exports, or meet the exigences of internal traffic, what is to repay the \"canal adventurers?\" In their"], [295, "1838.] 239 VOLCANO OF CONSEGUINA. present state of disunion, discord, and internal con vulsion, without funds, or responsible heads, the question must for a time sleep. But to return to our survey, and the volcano of Conseguina, which nearly all of our establishment had visited, and which has become of some importance to this neighbourhood, from its occasional emissions of dust, ashes, and water. The verge of the crater, which is half a mile in diameter, is elevated about three thousand eight hundred feet above the mean level ; thence the interior walls fall perpendicularly to a depth of about two hundred feet, when the bottom of the crater becomes flattish, with a small transparent lake in its centre. Vapour was plentifully emitted from its sides, and frequently jets of smoke rolled out, ascending, in calm, to a great height. The whole surface, after commencing the ascent, was more or less pervaded by sulphur springs, and in some places, even to its outer crest, was swampy from thermal springs. In one of the jets Mr. Hinds (our assistant surgeon) found the temperature at 212\u00b0. Externally no outlet presented itself by which the floods which had deluged the low lands could have escaped, unless this huge caldron boiled over ; and in such case the disruption of the soil would have been even more terrific than the utter desolation which prevailed. The ground would then have been torn into deep channels or ravines, instead of the distinct inclined planes for many hundred yards. It is true that at its base numerous pits were"], [296, "[ls:;s. 240 CONSEGUINA. observed, which have probably been sulphur springs, and which were even now moist and incrusted with sulphur, from which the vapour still continued to ascend. The beds and sides too of the torrent courses were studded with small cup-shaped excrescences, evidently so many diminutive jets formed by the escape of the gas from the bubbling fluid, some being incrusted with sulphur, and others containing nume rous balls about the size of peas. The aspect of the ruins, extending over one entire side of the mountain, (for nearly three miles,) was truly awful \u2014 its contemplation indescribable ; deso late beyond conception. From the first spring of the mountain not a vestige of verdure could be traced. Huge trees stood, bark less, bleached, or scorched. Others of the largest forest kind were uprooted and strewed in wild dis order, as if washed by an ocean force into the channels by which the floods descended ; but the whole surface, excepting these courses, presented, in a gradually de scending slope of two miles to the beach, that clean even line observable in loose sandy slopes. This evenness doubtless resulted from the fall of ashes and dust, which first filling the cavities, had then been smoothed by the water, or, subsequently, by the winds. It was evident, by the great masses of charcoal found embedded, as well as from trees half charred in the soil, that fire had preceded. On digging at our position, about ten feet above high water mark, we found the same loose soil and ashes"], [297, "1838.] 241 CONSEGUINA. (chiefly fine pumice) at the ' depth of four feet and a half, and without any traces of original soil. The surrounding ocean appeared to have partaken of the catastrophe ; not a shell was . obtained in the immediate vicinity by the .dredges \u2014 nothing, in fact, but clusters of ashes, in which the sabella had formed their habitations. On the eastern slope we noticed a very singular quadrangular elevation, of about twenty or thirty feet, which was at first mistaken for the base of an old crater. It was probably some building of the aborigines, possibly the w*alls of a village, intended for defence against the buccaneers, and at that period doubtless well screened from observation by the pre existing forest. On the extreme east a torrent had cut through a mound opposing it, to the depth of forty feet per pendicular, its stream appearing to have flowed towards the sea. In this region the vegetation appeared to flourish with great luxuriance, and a strong stream of very sweet but almost tepid water flowed into the sea. No aperture in the volcano corresponded to these courses. From the extent of the course, the strength of this stream implied an underground force ; and the water was also observed oozing through the soil in several other spots. The whole coast in this vicinity was so strongly impregnated with saline matter, as to incrust projecting stones or sticks with chloride of sodium. It could not be traced far inland, by reason VOL. i. R"], [298, "242 ERUPTION OF 1835. [1838. of the thick underwood. It is a curious fact that this water, although flowing through briny beds, was particularly delicious, and as I suspected that our thirst might deceive us, I caused a cask to be preserved and bottled. It kept better than other water, and preserved its purity ; it contained no foreign substances, as it was evaporated to dryness without residue. The last and awful effort of this volcano occurred on the 20th of January, 1835, and is thus recorded in the Journal of the estate of San Antonio, distant about sixty miles : Jan. 20th, 1835. \" This morning we observed the volcano of Conseguina (anciently called Quisi guina) vomiting an immense column of smoke and flame. At nine A. m. we experienced a very heavy shock of earthquake ; the night following five shocks ; and during the 21st we felt several, accompanied by noise resembling distant thunder, but known here as (in Spanish) ' retumbo.' On the 22nd the ground at day-break was covered with ashes or fine sand, which still continued to fall ; darkness and continued roaring of the volcano prevailing. \" At one on the morning following a very heavy shock of earthquake was felt ; at six, another, but slight. \" On the 23rd, day broke, the fall of ashes and sand having increased ; the morning was very dark.

At twelve o'clock this day, and at the darkest period, innumerable birds sought shelter in the house, supposed to be attracted by the lamps.\" The whole of the desolate region before alluded to was, before this event, rich pasture ground, and abounded with some of the finest cedars, particularly the Cedro Real. The beach at present was thickly strewed with bleached timber, rendering the aspect still more dreary ; indeed the painter might have taken a hint for \" after the deluge \" from the scene before us. Amongst these trees and drift timber we found some cedar, which was applied to useful pmposes. Very good timber, both mahogany and cedar, may be obtained in this gulf ; and from the forest range, pine if required, but rather of a knotty description. In the mineral kingdom none but volcanic tufas and sulphur were noticed. Of animals our list is but small. Deer were noticed, and were said to abound on Manguera, Conchaguita, and Tiger Islands. Rabbits, and r 2"], [302, "244 ALLIGATORS, BIRDS, &C. [1838- squirrels, with the addition of jackalls, may complete the list. Bullocks and other stock are easily procured at San Carlos, and prices moderate. On one occasion, I had ocular proof of the pre sence as well as the vigilance of an alligator. I had fired at and killed some wild ducks, one of which fell on the opposite side of a pond. One of the boat's crew went in quest of him, but during the time that he was seeking for a pole to hook it out, the poor fluttering bird was put out of misery by the sudden snap of the jaw of an alligator. It was fortu nate that the lad did not wade for the bird, or he might have chanced to take its place. Wild turkeys were shot for the table, and several handsome varieties of small birds for the collection. In conchology several rare shells (particularly the tellina burnetti) were taken ; but this gulf is veiy poor in respect to quantity or variety. On the 30th of December, having completed our examination of this gulf, we moved outwards, to con tinue our coastline to Realejo, and on the 31st com menced the survey with a light off-shore breeze. We had proceeded about twenty miles along the coast, when we suddenly shoaled our water and grounded ; the ship had barely got her head off shore when a squall assisting us, she dragged off. During the operation of reefing topsails, we observed the Victoria let fly all her sheets in a squall, and not being able to see the pinnace, (under the command of Mr. Colin Speck, mate and assistant surveyor,)"], [303, "1839.] 245 THE PINNACE UPSET. supposed that she had anchored to obtain observations. A suspicious uneasiness of the signal-man caused me to send him to the mast-head to find her ; and not succeeding, I despatched Kellett in the Victoria, to rejoin the Starling, and look for her, proceeding on with the ship to Realejo, then in sight. On the following morning, January 1, 1839, the Victoria rejoined, and I plainly foresaw was the bearer of bad tidings. She reported that the pinnace had capsized in a squall, and that Mr. Speck, mate, and J. Grant, seaman, had been drowned. It appears that she was taken by a roller under the lee, at the same instant that the squall occurred, and her stone ballast (which I had taken out of her but a few days before, but which had been replaced without my sanction) shifting, occasioned her loss. Mr. Speck, and Grant, Lamphier, and White, seamen, made for the shore, which the two latter reached ; but Mr. Speck observing the ship reefing, thought he was seen by her, and swam back to the boat, but having exhausted himself by taking a bare-^a to support him, was unable to hold on, although assisted for a considerable time by the coxswain. He at length gave himself up, and sank in one of the eddies following the rollers. The story is strange and improbable, as he was an excellent swimmer, of great courage, and, as before noticed on the Libertad affair, was the person who volunteered, and succeeded in effecting the commu nication with the shore. The Starling immediately despatched her boats"], [304, "[1839. 246 SAD LOSS OF MR. SPECK. through the surf, and succeeded in extricating the boat and men, with whom she returned on the evening of the 1st. This lamentable misfortune threw a great gloom over all, as Mr. Speck was a general favourite. To myself the loss in every respect was particularly severe. He had been gradually schooled under my own eye, had adopted my habits, and in proof of my satisfaction, I had bestowed on him the appointment of assistant surveyor ; a situation which necessarily entails confidence and fellowship. Added to this : he was the last of my retinue from whom I could expect the assistance I so much needed. After remaining at Realejo to recruit and rate the chronometers, we quitted on the 8th January, 1839, for the gulf of Nicoya. The Starling was despatched to look after a rock reported by an American at Realejo ; but, as usually happens with such reports, it was not found where stated to exist. Next to the reality, the position where it does not exist may guide navigators ; and for this purpose track-charts have been rigidly attended to."], [305, "CHAPTER XL Survey of the Gulf of Nicoya \u2014 Its capabilities \u2014 Examine Bay of Honda \u2014 Quibo \u2014 Receive despatches at Panama \u2014 Future movements \u2014 Sail for the Sandwich Islands \u2014 Revisit Cocos Island \u2014 Examine Clipperton Rock \u2014 Anchor at Honolulu \u2014 Disposition of the king towards us \u2014 Funeral of Kinau, the King's aunt \u2014 The king and suite visit the Sulphur \u2014 Mis- sionary influence and operations \u2014 The islands less frequented \u2014 The Orphan School \u2014 Rapid decrease of the population \u2014 Exports and productions."], [306, "248 [ 1 839. GULF OF NICOYA. CHAPTER XII. On the 14th we anchored off the islands of San Lucas and Pan d'Azucar (sugar-loaf) opposite to \" Punta Arenas,\" by which appellation seamen generally understand the Gulf of Nicoya. Punta Arenas was formerly the port of this gulf in the state of Costa Rica; but interested parties, whose property lay near to Calderas, about five miles s outherly, on the eastern side of the gulf, managed to have the port or custom house officers, &c, shifted thither. It is very un healthy, almost fatal, to all new residents ; and the higher authorities take care to excuse residence. As our occupations kept us vigorously to the beach, the interior was not visited, and the village of Calderas only by Lieut. Kellett. Our time from the 14th of January was almost a blank, as regards matter of record. We appeared to have lost sight of civilized beings entirely, and even the natives rarely crossed our track. The"], [307, "1839.] 249 PRODUCTIONS. interest of exploring this seldom visited gulf helped to keep up the excitement, and on the 17th, hav ing completed our labours, we moved towards Panama, at which port all our thoughts centred, the hope of letters and immediate return to England being probably predominant. Fire- wood, water, cedar timber, bullocks, and oysters, are to be obtained ; the latter in banks dry at low water, above Venado, on the western shore ; bullocks, either at Arenas, Calderas, or Verugate, on the western shore ; water at San Lucas, or better and more easily at . Herradura Bay, where the casks are rolled into a small . lake at the beach, and vessels may safely ride close to the shore, by veering the whole cable with a warp to the beach. Wood may be cut anywhere by the crew, or more easily purchased at Calderas or Punta Arenas. Our first halt was at the mouth of the Santiago or Pueblo Nueva, at the island called Magnetic Is land, in March, 1837. Here we recommenced our survey of this river, following its branches up for some distance. The river takes its name from a small village, situated on the river Santiago, where the Spaniards probably first appointed the seat of government. The port is formed by a neck or island about three \u2022 miles in length, which affords good anchorage for vessels of any class. Three larger streams discharge themselves into the main basin at the western end of this island, where the"], [308, "250 [1839. BAY OF HONDA. apparent great entrance is situated, but so studded with rocks and shoals, as to be unnavigable for anything larger than boats. It is in fact an exten sive archipelago, as most of the region towards the Chirique territory will be found to be on future examination. A plan was made, which will prove interesting to those who may visit this port for refuge or refit ; but water cannot be procured in any quantity. It may probably be found by digging wells. The natives generally appeared alarmed at our presence, nor could we induce them to bring off supplies. Had our visit been prolonged, no doubt this would have been dispelled, as after we fell in with a negro who understood English, they appeared anxious to sell pigs, poultry, &c. Their principal article of trade is the sarsaparilla, that of this neighbourhood being esteemed of supe rior quality. The stream runs fresh at some miles up, but we did not either meet it, or succeed in finding the town. Sugar-cane of good quality was offered, and tortoise-shell, one of their articles of trade, can be procured at the season. On the 4th March, 1839, we moved on to Baija Honda, another of our stations in 1837. Here we fell in with a few Chirique Indians sent to clear the land ; but they also were very much afraid of having any dealings with us. We found this to be a most capacious, safe, and convenient harbour, completely landlocked and per-"], [309, "1839.] 251 LAND ON QUIBO. fectly adapted for refit, heaving out, &c, there being no tide or current. Water was in abundance at the beach, and nothing wanting but a town and civiliza tion to render it a favourite resort ; timber of every kind, and the best abundant. The islands at its entrance are beautifully adapted for defence, with but trivial labour. At this port we col lected a large stock of parasitic plants in full flower, which continued to decorate my cabin for some time, until forwarded to England, where they ar rived in forty-two days in good order. Having heard much of Quibo and its advantages, I fully intended examining its bays, and for this purpose ranged along its eastern coast, until we found an indentation answering to one of our re ports. Our soundings, however, decreased so ra pidly from thirty-three to fifteen and aground, that we had sufficient occupation for the time in heaving off, in which we instantly succeeded by the Star ling letting go both her anchors a short distance astern, and veering until she got our coasting cable fast, when we slipped off the bank as easily as she had glided on, the bottom being yielding sand. Having landed, and obtained observations for fixing the position, we proceeded to examine the inlet, which proved to be merely an estuary, the sand-banks not having more than six feet over them, extending about two miles to seaward. Nothing of sufficient interest inducing further delay, we bore up for Panama. The currents"], [310, "252 [1839. RECEIVE DESPATCHES. setting us strongly to the southward, we were com pelled to stand over to the eastern shore, and work up between the Yslas del Rey, or Pearl Islands ; and it was not until the 14th, about midnight, that we anchored at Taboga. On the following day we received our despatches from our consul at Panama, and in the evening ran to Panama. Nothing interfering with my stated intentions, of an earlier period, being contained in these de spatches, I found that we must give up all idea of returning to England, and with an increase of energy make up our minds for another examination of the N. W. coast of America and the Californias. I immediately resolved on proceeding direct to the Sandwich Islands, refitting, and moving north, to save all the available season. As another mail was daily expected, I determined on waiting for any particular instructions, and employing the interval in completing the work of this bay. On the 26th the mail arrived, but as there were no letters for the Sulphur, we took leave of our Panama friends for the last time, and that night quitted for at least ten more months of suspense \u2014 at all events, that period must intervene before we could reach our despatches at San Bias. The period of the rainy season was now approach ing, and many unpleasant colds, and a species of influenza, attacked the greater number of us ; added to which a very peculiar and distressing kind of prickly heat was prevalent."], [311, "253 1839.] DESERTERS AT COCOS ISLAND. Our course was directed towards Cocos island, but the variable winds and rains of this region delayed us considerably. We made * the island on the 6th, but on . the day following at noon, enveloped in heavy rain, we were not more than ten miles from our anchorage. \u25a0 At nine we anchored, all heartily anxious to escape a rainy season in our present jaded state. An American whaler, according to their praiseworthy habit of assisting any friend in view, sent her boats to assist in towing the Starling to her anchorage ; but we were too far out to par take of her aid. On the morning following, I landed to obtain observations, and the early part of the day certainly led me to anticipate all I looked for, but noon destroyed my hopes, the rain falling in a complete deluge. I succeeded, however, in obtaining the requisite data, and also witnessed the effect of the heavy rains on the streams ; converting a very quiet brook into a turbulent rapid in the course of a very few hours. On my last visit, I mentioned that three men were left behind by an American whaler. These had remained a considerable time on the island, but were eventually taken off by another whaler ; not, however, without poisoning the minds of part of her crew, two of whom were induced to try a simi lar experiment, and were now almost reduced to starvation, notwithstanding the presence of their countrymen. The master, however, assured me of"], [312, "254 [1839. GRATIFYING EXPERIMENT. his intention of giving them a passage to Payta, the lesson of the former characters leading him to assume severity to the last moment, as a warning to his own, as well as to the crews of other vessels. Of the seeds planted by me just one year since, I had the satisfaction to find that the pumpkins were in a fair way to overrun the island, the pre sent whaler having collected fifty ; the vines were also at this period full of flower and young fruit. Of the other seeds, I fear that the hogs and rats destroyed them. This, however, did not prevent my sowing a fresh stock, and covering them well with stones. At sunset we quitted this island. On the 11th, about nine p.m., we noticed several luminous bands on the surface, which upon examination proved to be shrimps, with their detached ova :* the latter having the power of a very rapid whirling motion, by the protrusion of their legs, &c, similar to the lepas, and emitting in their progress fluid phosphorescent tracks, like diminutive meteors, as if produced by an oily matter. White tern and a turtle were also noticed. Light variable baffling airs prevailed, not allowing us to make more than fifty miles per day. It is certain that the currents in this region vary consider- * Respecting these mistermed ova of the shrimp, I am in duced,from having noticed them in all stages, and taken them up to the size of a pea in the eastern seas near Ceylon, to consider them a distinct crustaceous object not described."], [313, "1839.] 255 SITE CLIPPERTON ROCK. ably; this we have ourselves witnessed. That a strong easterly current must prevail, our current bottle of 1837 will exhibit. The master of the American whaler we met at Cocos, who seemed superior to the generality of his brethren, informed me that previous to reaching the island on the 8th May, \" he had experienced the strongest N. W. set he had ever noticed in these seas.\" The existence of Clipperton rock, or its attendant dangers, not being a clear point amongst navigators, determined me on steering for it, either to verify, rectify, or obliterate it from its assumed position. That I did so, will probably be deemed fortunate, for the extent of its dangers was certainly unknown to us. Yet to day only, 8th May, 1839, have we made it one month from the Cocos, or about 1360 miles direct. At dawn, the rock was discovered by the Star ling and ourselves, at nearly the same instant, then distant about fifteen miles, and presenting, owing to the sun's rays playing on its nearest face, the appearance of a brig close hauled. Unfortunately, the light baffling airs of the last month, accom panied by rain, which have worn our gear as well as patience nearly threadbare, prevented our doing anything effective towards its survey until after noon, when the w*eather cleared, and sun and wind favoured our operations. The name, Clipperton Rock, certainly misled us, and had we made the point at night, with a fair wind, would, almost inevitably,"], [314, "256 [1839. EXAMINE THE LAGOON. have severely damaged or destroyed both vessels. I certainly should have steered to pass it to the northward ; merely assuming it to be a solitary rock. Nothing in this name could lead a seaman to iina gine a high rock, placed on the southern edge of a coral lagoon island, three miles long N. and S., by the same east and west. Its description should stand thus : a very danger ous low lagoon island, destitute of trees, with a high rock on its southern edge, which may be mistaken for a sail. This rock can be seen fifteen miles. In thick weather the low coral belt, which appears like sand, will not be distinguished until close to it. The breakers on the eastern side do not afford sufficient warning for a vessel to trim or change course. On the northern part of the belt, the land is a little raised, and appears to be clothed with something like grass. There are two entrances, which at high water may be safe ; but at the moment we passed, the surf was too heavy, and the reflux showed the rocks bare. The high rock is situated in latitude 10 \u00b017' N., longitude 109\u00b0 19' W., the dangers from it northerly extending two miles easterly, and the same north westerly. On the beach several large trees were observed, and an object which was thought to be part of a vessel near the western opening.

This literally constitutes two islands, formed by its two openings ; both are on the weather side of the island. No living trees were seen, but the whole island was covered with gannet, boobies, frigate pelican, and several kinds of tern, which had also been noticed in great numbers during the last week, at least five hundred miles to the eastward. From this an easterly current may be inferred, as these birds generally keep in its stream or tail course.* No bottom was obtained by the Sulphur with one hundred fathoms of line, but the Starling had sound ings with less than one hundred on the northern side. Sharks, porpoises, and turtle, were observed to gether. The former annoyed us much by biting at our patent logs, for which one was taken, and made an example of. They were very large, and literally swarmed. In all probability they were attracted by a shoal of file, (balistes,) and other small fish, which had been feeding off our copper since quitting the island of Cocos. On passing the meridian of Cape San Lucas, the true trade reached us. On the 19th of May, in latitude 13\u00b0 45' N., longitude 124\u00b0 30' W., the Star ling was despatched by a different route, to seek for * It does not follow, therefore, as a matter of course, as no ticed by some writers, that the appearance of birds denotes land to windward ; they are more likely guided by tide.

As I believe our method of conducting such investigation, and indeed of all our tracks, may prove interesting, I shall here insert a description of it. As it occurred to me that simple linear tracks of ships afforded but a very imperfect idea of the spaces actually investigated, and that islands might be passed unseen at night, I desired the officers, in addition to the hourly sounding with one hun dred fathoms, and keeping the look-out men on the alert, to note at clear daylight, noon, and before sunset, the \" visual radius,\" and at night, the dis tance at which they could perceive an island. On the track line, at the positions, at these instants, the circles of visual radius were struck, and lines or curves connecting daylight, noon, and sunset, cir cumscribed the actually explored spaces : parallels by night noted the connexion by dark. In this manner we are prepared, on inspection at any future period, without calculation, to meet any as sertion that islands exist within those spaces. It is not perhaps generally known, that surveying ships or vessels on scientific research are instructed to sound every ten miles, or every hour, two hours, or"], [317, "1839.] 259 SANDWICH ISLANDS. time that her commander may think suitable, when making passages. But to return to our investigation. No signs of land were observed, but birds were numerous, and it is strange that they, as well as mollusca, &c, ceased at the 140th degree. Reasoning from the in ference I drew at Clipperton's Rock, \" that the birds dwell upon the tail course of the current,\" and that being in this region westerly, I presume that within five hundred miles easterly, or about the 130th degree, this examination should commence. The strength of the trade admitted of our averaging one hundred and eighty miles per day, and on the 29th May we made the island of Maui. On the day following, we passed along its northern side, and at four that evening sighted Diamond Hill of the island of Oahu. We ran under its lee, and hove to for the night ; and at daylight stood into the entrance of the harbour of Honolulu, where the pilot meeting us, we crossed the bar, and an chored until the natives, already prepared on the reef got hold of our hawser. Having furled sails, we tripped our anchor, and with a \" four hundred man power,\" were quickly towed to our berth in the harbour. We found our old friends heartily glad to see us, as indeed they ever must be at any arrival which tends to vary the monotony of their lives. But death had not been idle, and mourning weeds deprived some of the gayest of their cheerful s 2"], [318, "[1839. 260 VISIT THE KING. countenances. Kinau, the chief woman of this island, and aunt to the king, had also died recently, and still lay in state. All the chiefs of the neigh bouring islands had been summoned to attend the funeral. The king was absent, amusing himself in the valley, and it was suggested that he would not come down during my stay, as he had not done so to Captain Elliot, of the Fly. I felt satisfied to the contrary, and on the Monday following called in state. My reception was as warm as I could wish ; no subject was introduced to interfere with the harmony of the meeting, and having promised to attend the funeral, and requested him in return to visit the Sulphur, we parted. Why so much weight was attached to my influ ence over his majesty, I am unable to divine, but most certainly the king's anti-British advisers feared theconjunction; and when I mentioned his acceptance of my invitation, bets were taken that his masters would not permit him to come. I knew him, how ever, to be as self-willed as those who pretended to control him, and that unless they overcame him by intoxication, I could depend on his word. The funeral of Kinau was appointed for the Wed nesday following, and, accompanied by the consul and my officers, we proceeded to the house where the remains of the princess (now designated as Ka hamanu II. by the missionaries) reposed in state The coffin, which was six feet and a half long, by"], [319, "1839.] 261 FUNERAL OF KINAU. three wide, and the same in depth, covered with crimson cloth and gilt ornaments, (similar to that of Rihoriho, made in England,) was placed on a bed stead ; the curtains of which were black silk, trimmed with white lace. The body of a carriage having been removed from the wheels, the bedstead was adapted to it, thus forming a very handsome car. We were received with great attention by the king and chiefs, and his majesty, in further proof of his goodwill, sent the order of the procession the day previous, to ascertain if I wished to make any alteration. The troops and militia, amounting to four hundred, were all well clothed in white uni forms. Their evolutions were admirable. The king's body-guard, amounting to twenty officers in scarlet jackets, some few with epaulettes, tinsel, crape, &c, marched, with their swords re versed, on each side of the car ; the troops, with arms reversed, preceded. The king as chief mourner, with the deceased's husband, and the other chiefs, followed the car, the residents, consuls, and officers, bringing up the rear. The concourse of well-dressed females (from all the islands, I imagine) in black silk mourning, astonished me. I am quite satisfied they equalled the number of troops. The moment the procession advanced, the na tives not included in the procession, but who lined the roads, (which had been previously strewed with"], [320, "[1839. 262 THE \" FEATHERED PLUME.\" rushes, over which mats were laid,) commenced the wail, \u2014 a low noise which can only be compared to the shrill noise of the bull-frogs of America ; and the buz of so many voices in such melancholy notes certainly did not diminish the solemnity of the scene. Many I noticed shed tears, and some I thought really wailed in earnest. Kinau, whatever her failings might have been, was much esteemed by her subjects. The kahili, or feathered plume, and the badge of royalty, was carried on this occasion. It is con structed of the dark tail-feathers of the cock, very similar to the Chinese fly-dusters, or resembling the feathers worn by our regimental bands. It is, how ever, of great size, measuring as follows : \u2014 length of pole and plume, eighteen feet six inches ; length of plume, four feet and twenty-eight inches in dia meter. On the car reaching the church, a thatched house about two hundred feet in length by sixty wide, the canopy was lowered, the troops marched through, and the car was placed abreast of the pulpit. The consul and myself were assigned seats with his majesty. The funeral service in the native language, with a two hours' palapala (discourse) was delivered by Mr. Bingham. He condescended to tell us pithily in English what the import was, and the procession then moved on to the royal vault, where the king"], [321, "1839.] 263 MISSIONARY INFLUENCE. introduced me to his other relatives there entombed, viz. Rihoriho, and his queen, Kahamanu, and Naha nina his sister, to whom Kinau was now added. Mr. Bingham then returned thanks on the part of the king, to the foreigners who had paid him the compliment of attending ; the military fired three volleys well, and we then retired. On Saturday the king installed the next sister of Kinau, known as \" the big-mouthed queen,\" into the government of Oahu, which did not appear to be acquiesced in by the chiefs, and promised to become matter for further discussion. The king, accompanied by the new gouvernante and suite, dined on board, . and, there being no missionary present, enjoyed themselves very much, and behaved also with very great propriety. The king promised to accompany me to Atooi, which I was anxious to effect, as I wished to talk over with him several subjects which were of importance to himself and government, as well as to the foreign residents, and upon which he had asked my advice, which I ultimately sent on pajier. The evening before our departure he sent to say \" that he felt the disappointment keenly, but the chiefs required hfs presence to settle the affair rela tive to the late appointment.\" I am satisfied that the true motive could be traced to the jealousy en tertained by the missionaries, of the influence I might have over him. He had everything packed, and was, I know, very"], [322, "[1839. 264 MISDIRECTED EXERTIONS, much chagrined at his disappointment. I was told he wept, \u2014 probably for passion, as he spent his evening at the hotel in rather unkingly style, scuf fling with his companions, by which his clothes were somewhat damaged, and destroying articles of furni ture, glass, &c, for which he would have to pay. Is it not strange, with all the influence the American missionaries are said to have over the king, that it is not properly exerted to improve his moral character? To compass any object having for its end injury to the interests of their own mer chants, they are keenly awake, and whilst they at tempt to pursue a system (the total prohibition of wines or spirits even for table use of the consuls, &c.) which in more civilized countries has not been attempted by a more perfect system and vigour to enforce, they yet permit the pattern, by which all law acquires moral force and energy, to commit sins and inconsistencies, not only without control, but without expressing their opinions in that manly form, which they pretend their mission so imperatively demands of them. Why is this? They are too fully sensible that if once the king and chiefs open their eyes to their true interests, their power, or rather tyranny, would rapidly decline. Since the year 1827, I have felt a great interest about this king and people, and it will probably be remembered by many, that I had some little influence at that period. I have watched the changes with interest ; and as far as the king per-"], [323, "1839.] 265 CULTIVATION OPPOSED. sonally is concerned, I believe his heart to be good, and that the wayward disposition and excesses at tributed to him, result solely from opposition. That he may be led I am certain, but driven never, if he can see any chance of successful resistance. It may naturally be asked, what induces me to take so great an interest in the affairs of these islands? My answer cannot embrace any official instruc tions, but I think that every Englishman must feel an interest in the fate of any flag which bears our national union in the canton. Indeed, it has fre quently occurred to me, that I should feel very awkwardly situated if I should witness any insult offered to it. The changes which have taken place since 1827, have been strongly brought to my recollection by conversations with the residents, during my two last visits. In 1826 \u2014 7, it was considered a paramount duty (by the missionaries) to prevent the culture of the sugar-cane, coffee, cotton, &c. ; and even the cultivation of the ground was deemed almost impious, where the earth spontaneously afforded sufficient to meet their necessities. At that period, however, the chief Boki owned a sugar plantation, and he was not to be trifled with ; the sugar-cane flourished, sugar was manufactured, and coffee and cotton were progressing. It will hardly be credited, that one of the chief missionaries took an active part in destroy ing a considerable cane plantation ; that the ground"], [324, "266 [1839 COMPULSORY LABOUR. was subsequeutly given for school or religious pur poses ; and that same individual is now cultivating the proscribed cane on the same ground ! I will not venture to affirm that it is for his own profit ; but I was so informed. Another, with his own hands, destroyed some thousands of coffee-trees which were flourishing. It would be futile to dwell on the acts of men of this stamp, which, added to the following, can only be attributed to sectarian madness. In a discourse at evening lecture, during our visit, the lecturer, in his attempt at illustrating the Divine Power, informed his audience, the white residents, \" that God was all-powerful. He could instantly change them into horses, whales, ships, or even steamboats ! \" It is really unfortunate, for the credit of Chris tianity in these seas, that members of the Church Missionary Society have not been sent to show them the mildness of true christian rule, instead of the tyranny of fanatics, who have already caused a dis gust for the Protestant creed, and will probably, in the end, be expelled. Their forcible and tyrannous acts against the two French missionaries, as noticed in 1837, have recoiled upon themselves, and the Catholic religion is now, per force, tolerated. Already the chiefs begin to see the necessity of change. New laws relative to the employment of the natives, who were groaning under insufferable tyranny, are about to be made. Formerly (or, pos-"], [325, "1839.] 267 ALTERED PROSPECTS. sibly, at this instant) half the month was employed in missionary slavery, church building, &c. ; one fourth, or more, in the service of the king or their chiefs ; and scarcely time left them for respiration or recreation. How are they to subsist ? To labour at their taro plantations (and this is severely pro hibited on the Sabbath) would be perpetual slavery. It is really matter of wonder, that a previously indolent race, as former navigators found them, even as late as 1822, could be broken in with such an iron hand, without rebellion. Did their brethren of the Society Islands submit to half this ? No slavery under the sun deserves to be questioned so severely as that of the Sandwich Islands. What idea can the chiefs have of the amelioration they were to experience from a change of religion ? How can these islands rise in the scale of import ance, if the climate and amazing fertility of soil which has been bestowed on them, is not to be made available ? What have the missionaries done for them ? This question is beyond my powers of reply. But I can safely assert that, in the years 1826 \u2014 7, above eighty sail of whale ships, as well as traders, entered the port of Honululu ; and that number was, I understood, present at one time. At this moment it is almost deserted. And, instead of the thriving plantations, which at that period promised well, we have now a great increase of spirit shops. Formerly the streets were clean and quiet, and it was rare to notice a native intoxicated. They in-"], [326, "[1839. 268 ABSURD REGULATIONS. dulged freely in aquatic exercises, ablutions, &c, and were apparently free, happy, and cheerful ; but a miserable contrast remains ; they are now chap fallen and miserable. First, the absurd \"port charges\" prevented the shipping from entering the port for refreshment or refit. Secondly, the necessary supplies of fruit, vegetables, &c, could not meet the demand, by reason of the course of labour preventing the natives from even subsisting themselves, comfortably or adequately. And, as these supplies could be obtained more easily, at a cheaper rate, and without extra charges, at the other islands, particularly at Atooi, they generally embarked them there, and thus enriched the chiefs instead of the king. In addition to their port charges, they had enacted very absurd laws, amounting to an entire prohibition on the landing of spirits or wines, even for the private consumption of the consuls, merchants, and residents ; and this, too, without due notice afforded to the importers. To the white residents, and par ticularly to the consuls and their families, it was almost a denial of the natural wants and luxuries of civilized beings. It was chiefly upon these questions that the king wished to obtain my opinion ; and, from the short conversation which ensued, I am perfectly satisfied that he was willing to remove all difficulties. It may appear presumptuous to assume, that my influence would have effected the necessary changes."], [327, "269 1839.] THE KING WELL DISPOSED. But I would merely refer to acts of last year, and to documents resulting therefrom, to show the weight which they attached to my opinion ; and particularly to that expression of the king, \"If *we had some person with us occasionally, who would take the trouble to explain what we ought to do, as you have done, there would be no quarrels.\" Upon this ground, particularly, as well as from his former friendly expressions, I felt perfectly convinced that the king would be anxious to see me, although he might have been persuaded to stay away at the period of the visit of her Majesty's ship Fly, commanded by a person unknown to him, and probably taught to believe her visit to be of an unpleasant nature. If I had been a free agent, and not compelled to move immediately to the northward, I am perfectly satisfied that I should have secured some beneficial changes. Indeed, they were partly promised ; and I was not quite so much out of favour with the better class of missionaries as their enemies suspected. The king, chiefs, and government are in debt ; and the natives, to accord with their ideas, must work it out. At one time sandal wood, by a tax on the natives, brought in a tolerable revenue, but this was pushed to the extreme by the creditors, and the islands were nearly stripped. They are, there fore, reduced to cut firewood ; but the port charges prevent whalers from taking it off their hands. There is one vessel at present undergoing repair, and she will probably call at some other island, where"], [328, "[1839. 270 THE ORPHAN SCHOOL. she can obtain even the firewood at a cheaper rate. The next act of the drama will be the retirement of the merchants in disgust. Left without revenue and without money, the king and chiefs will lose all power and respect ; and at that crisis it is more than probable that a repetition of the acts of Tahiti will help the authors of their miseries in their removal to the barren shores, where they so kindly advised the authorities to transport Messrs. Bachelot and Short. This I suspect is anticipated; several have already seceded from the mission, and are enjoying their rich farms. It has been fully proved that the soil is capable of producing anything that may be required from it ; and, from the progress within the last year, it is very evident that had these islands been wisely governed, trade would have flourished, the merchants would have increased, and the king and chiefs would have had the command of wealth, instead of filling the humiliating position of debtors. Much to the credit of the white residents, an orphan school for the instruction of the children of white residents, as well as those of mixed parentage, has been successfully established, and is supported by voluntary contribution amongst themselves, as well as by foreign visitors. It is under the direction of a Mr. and Mrs. Johnson, who appear to have devoted themselves very zealously to their charge ; Mr. Johnson having for this end resigned his post in"], [329, "1839.] 271 ITS BENEFICIAL TENDENCY. the mission, the missionary board considering \" that it did not come within their scheme or authority.\" Much stress might be laid on this latter word, the keystone of missionary zeal. We visited this school, in company with the con sul's family, and witnessed the practical method of instruction. The ladies take much interest in it ; and the proficiency in the English language, needle work, and other useful occupations, is highly inter esting, and reflects great credit on the patronesses and preceptors. This promises to be of very great importance to the society, and even to the government, of these islands. Mr. Johnson and his lady may congratulate themselves on being employed in the most perfect course of missionary duty ; and when the morose and austere declamations of their ci-devant brethren shall be heard no more and forgotten, they will be remembered as the original instructors of the aris tocracy of these islands. These children, speaking both languages, and brought up in moral habits and duties, will accom plish more, by their example and influence, on those about them, than could have been effected by any other course. They amount, at present, to sixty of each sex, not exceeding ten years of age, and are taught separately ; the boys in the morning, the girls in the afternoon. There are some very clever and interesting characters amongst them. The population of these islands in Cook's time was"], [330, "[1839. 272 DECREASING POPULATION. estimated at four hundred thousand. In 1832 it had diminished to one hundred and thirty thousand. In 1836 to one hundred and ten thousand. Mr. Bishop, a missionary, attempts to account for this alarming decrease. But of the fact we ought first to be assured. An enormous decrease, however, since the days of Cook and Vancouver, is admitted by them selves, leaving numbers out of the question. Mr. Bishop observes, \" That the middle-aged women cease to have children, and that many cou ples have none. That, where they are so blessed, they die before they are two years old. In families of six, eight, or ten,* few survive the first year. It is a pitiable sight to behold their infants. Destitute not only of warm but of every clothing, the greater part of them are covered by sores and cuticular dis eases, inherited or contracted from the uncleanliness of their parents or nurses.\" In reply to these remarks, it is necessary to observe, that in savage life it will be found that the women bear but once in three years ; those who number ten children should therefore, at least, be forty-five; a period when, in civilized countries, women cease to have children, and veryrarely have them in savage life. How did the race, in Cook's time, exist without warm clothing, &c. ? But I will answer the result, or supposed result, to suit Mr. Bishop's purpose. Yes \u2014 it is owing to the introduction of foreigners that these cutaneous disorders occur. If the missionaries * Does Mr. Bishop mean, where six, eight, or ten have been born ?"], [331, "1839.] 273 CAUSES. had not caused the discontinuance of cleanliness, of ablution, constant sea-bathing, and proper exercise in men and women, as their natural habits pointed out, they would have been free from the evil in question. As to the \" want of maternal love and solicitude, the best medical skill, luxuries,\" &c, when did they possess them ? It has been asserted \" that it is an error to suppose that pagan nations can be converted and elevated with comparative ease.\" This, I sus pect, would be entirely rebutted in the Southern Pacific. But on two instances, one Protestant, the other Roman Catholic, I think I can confidently rely. By the testimony of the parties themselves, in the crew of the Bounty, the Tahitans immediately adopted the creed of their husbands. At Gambier's Group, we were informed that they are the purest race existing, and we knew them to be perfectly savage in 1826 ; probably cannibals. They assign this as their reason for selecting Wainwright and myself. My impression, from the beginning, has been, that the natives of the Polynesian Group should have well-educated clergymen sent to them. To people of superior mind, respected and courted by all foreign vessels of war, great importance would attach. But what is the result at present ? Vessels of war visit these islands. They do not choose to countenance over-zealous, half-educated sectarians, and refuse to associate with them ; consequently, the VOL. I. T"], [332, "[1839. 274 LAST OF THE ROYAL FAMILY. natives, who narrowly watch these minuti\u00e6, suspect that they are not entitled to that profound respect which they endeavour to force, and which, moreover, is not expected or sought by their superiors. I am satisfied that these people are to be led as easilv as any other race ; but, from being hitherto a bold unconstrained people, they are averse to com pulsion. Perhaps the greatest excesses are committed within the missionary circle, which includes the king and chiefs. In almost every case where a foreigner has mar ried a native woman, her conduct has, to judge from the race, been peculiarly correct, and their children promise to be ornaments to the society of Oahu. Of the royal blood of Kamehameha, the present king, Kauikeouli, (floating in the dark blue sky.) will terminate the race, as no female of blood royal remains, and it is deemed peculiarly essential that the queen should be even superior to her husband in purity of blood and descent. The sister of Nahanaena died in December, 1836. He is mar ried to Kalama, known as \" the king's wife.\" She was a woman of inferior rank, being the daughter of the Admiral Nahikukui, who accompanied Rihoriho to England. The children of Kinau will probably succeed. The next chief in consideration is Hoapili, gover nor of Maui, Molokoi, and Ranai.

His wife, Hoapili Wahine, (wife of Hoapili,) or Kanin (the cocoa-nut tree, from her stature,) is sister of the late Regent, Kaha manu I., and of governor Adams. She was a wife of Kamehameha I., and had several children by him. Kinau was her daughter, as also is the new Regent, Ka-ula-ohe, (the big-mouthed queen.) This giantess was known in the time of Vancouver, as Malaia. He is said to have given her the appella tion of the cocoa-nut tree. Kuakini, or John Adams, the governor of Hawaii, is the next in rank. He and Karimoku assumed about the same time the names of Adams and Pitt, the leaders of the two governments. He is a very intelligent and important personage in these islands, speaks and reads English, strongly advocates liberal views, and encourages settlers on his territory, provided they are respectable and steady characters. He employs a number of tradespeople at their callings, and produces leather, sugar, coffee, cotton, cloth, &c. He is a warm supporter of the king, and nothing is transacted of importance without his sanction. He is much esteemed by natives as well as foreigners. His daughter, a very fine young woman, educated in the consul's house at the time of our visit, 1826 \u2014 7, was intended for the King's wife, but she died suddenly. The other chiefs are of little importance. The third son of Kinau has been selected as the pet of the king, and will probably be named his successor. t 2"], [334, "[1839 276 EXPORTS.

Yet on its clearing up on the 16th, the earth dried ra pidly, and the freshness of all around repaid us for the delay. A very material improvement had taken place since our last visit. A new house had been erected, ground fenced in, and an extensive plantation of mulberry trees were in full vigour, preparatory to the intro duction of the silk- worm. The cattle were in the same fine condition as when we last visited ; large quantities of meat had been salted, and much butter cured. Of the cattle we embarked twelve, having already experienced their superiority over any I have met out of England. Many inquiries were made after the king, and why he had not come, as one of his vessels preceded us with notice of his intention. They were much disappointed.

As the Starling might part during the passage, and my mind was not entirely made up as to the extent of my northerly trip, I directed her to repair to the river Columbia, and make the neces sary preparations for its survey, as well as to make themselves acquainted with the entrance, in order to assist us in entering. The wind continued to press us to the eastward"], [340, "[1839. 282 MARINE ANIMALS, until the 24th, when we reached 164\u00b0 of west Ion* gitude, in latitude 37\u00b0 N. Here we observed the customary sea-birds, with the addition of the diomedea. Cook notes a shag. Seaweed was reported, but on examination it proved to be bundles of anatifa, not attached to any foreign substances, but radiating from a centre. They were numerous, and disposed in massive streaks, very similar to the fucus natans, (or gulf weed of the Atlantic,) and I have little doubt have been frequently noted as such. This accounts most satisfactorily for the presence of the birds, who may be said to be \" in clover\" comparatively; for the sea was studded with them for many miles. Upon close examination of the water, microscopic Crus tacea were also found to be very abundant. The anatifa were preserved.

As some alarm had been expressed relative to our differences with Vancouver's longitudes, this was too good an opportunity to be overlooked. The change of temperature was keenly felt by all ; the"], [341, "1839.] 283 DEEP-SEA TEMPERATURES. more so, as the first fog Avas attended with drizzling rain, though the temperature had only fallen from 6h\u00b0 to 61\u00b0. On the morning of the 27th, we observed pro cellaria, diomedea, &c, as well as masses of velella ; the anatifa but scantv. On the 28th we sounded with five hundred fathoms ; temperatures as follows : all such experi ments in the Sulphur are bona fide vertical depths, being obtained by a light boat ; the line afterwards hauled in by the ship.

In the evening we passed through a compact body of velella, which produced a bright green tint on the mass, although their attached mantle is dark blue. I had an impression that the clear substance like isinglass might be soluble, but after long boiling in water, as well as alcohol and dilute spirit, it re mained unchanged. Numbers of cinereous procel laria, with whitish breasts, as well as party-coloured porpoises, were also noticed. I was informed that birds had roosted on our yards during the night, but unfortunately none were taken. I am not aware of the booby venturing into such high latitudes, and do not believe that either the procellaria or diomedea would venture to alight. On Friday, the 5th July, 1839, we discovered land on the lee-bow, which clearly showed Vancouver considerably in error."], [342, "284 [1839. KODIACKS. A press of sail was carried to reach Point Greville in time for observations the following day, and as the breeze seemed disposed to fail, I took the pre caution to keep in soundings, and in a condition to land at the nearest point. About eight I dropped the stream anchor underfoot, and proceeded to land at the mouth of an estuary, from which I had observed a canoe to come oft' towards us. The person in this canoe informed us that there was a Russian company's vessel in St. Paul's ; but as a day's delay was important, and the island oft' Cape Greville, noticed by Vancouver, was within our means of triangulation, a better situation than that I had selected could not be found, as his lon gitudes had no reference to St. Paul's. Cape Greville he relies on. The ship being in excellent position, was secured. Hooks and lines were issued to the crew, and they contrived to make the most of our visit, by taking cod and halibut. At the spot where I landed I found a family of Kodiacks in the full enjoyment of the oily luxuries of the Esquimaux. Dogs, in the proportion of five to each human being, expressed their disapprobation of our presence, and posting themselves on the ridges of their respective huts, howled most unmusically. The natives were evidently in fear; they were all females, from the grandmother downwards; and apparently not much superior to their guardians \u2014 certainly not so clean. The huts were situated at"], [343, "1839.] 285 ROMANTIC SCENERY. the entrance of a large estuary, dry at low water, on the confines of which I could trace many others ; and from the strong flow at low water, as well as its meandering for some distance within us, I have little doubt that the stream is supplied by melting snows, which at this period clothed the high lands. Indeed, I much doubt that they are ever free, as we found snow lying in the latter part of August and September in the same latitude, further east. The valley, if one were not occasionally reminded of the cold by the above-mentioned circumstance, possesses a very romantic character, and was clothed in the customary bright verdure of the short north ern summers. The position I had selected for my observations was about the centre of a long, sandy, or fine gravelly beach, forming a bar to the valley, and was elevated about twenty-five feet above low water \u2014 evidently produced by the frequent roll of the ocean above its present peaceful limits, and at a recent date, even over our position into the estuary, as drift wood was found on the inner slope, among the long grass. On my return I had intended moving on to St. Paul's, but, much to my regret, calms put an end to this entirely ; I therefore landed and obtained more complete data, and in the afternoon bore away for Sitka. During my delay on shore the dredge was put over, and some interesting specimens, from thirty-five to fifty-five fathoms, obtained ; amongst them were living terebratula."], [344, "286 [1839. NUMEROUS WHALES. The black and white alca, so common to the northward, were too shy to be shot, Several very handsome ducks were fired at, but were either too strong- for our shot, or the distance to which thev would permit our approach was too great. The fucus giganteus, which is common to these seas as well as about the region of Cape Horn, was very abundant, impeding our progress in the boats con siderably. Albatross were plentiful, and whales swarming. The numbers seen spouting at the same instant were incredible. I can only compare them to the ricochet resulting from a broadside of a frigate. On the 12th we fell in with an American whaler, Elbe of Poughkeepsie. She had been very success ful, having taken sixteen hundred barrels, only two of which were spermaceti, or \" right whale,\" (Physeter Macrocephalus.) At dawn on the morning of the 16th we made Mount Edgecumbe, certainly a most splendid leading mark for this port, \u2014 and managed, during the en suing night, to crawl up the sound until we got sight of the lighthouse. At four we fired two guns \u2014 the customary signal for a pilot \u2014 but none appearing, at six we repeated the signal, when he came off, and by eight we were safely at anchor in the outer harbour, having entered by the direct channel before the pilot reached us. Our friends were diminished by the changes which had taken place, but the governor and lieu-"], [345, "1839.] 287 RECEPTION AT SITKA. tenant-governor were the same, and received us with the same civility, although it was evident that there was a restraint which considerably checked the warm feelings with which I had paid my visit. They were anticipating hostilities, and some of the fairer part of the creation were shedding tears of anything but congratulation. This was soon ex plained, and they observed that they felt much relieved by our signal for a pilot, and observing us stand boldly in for the anchorage, for which we were sufficient pilots. But the pilot secures the assistance of boats, which is particularly necessary in this port, where the winds fail in an instant. Nothing worthy of record occurred, our visit merely embracing observations to connect this me ridian with Kodiack and the Columbia, and the verification of some important magnetic data which varied from those of other observers. These were satisfactorily corroborated. We experienced much kindness and attention during our flying visit, and on the morning of the 19th quitted the harbour. One of the vessels belonging to the company, bound to Bodegas and Mexico, was to have sailed with us, but having an indifferent pilot, she fell into shoal water, and remained behind. We met a heavy westerly swell outside the gulf, similar to that of 1837, which made us very uneasy. Amongst the changes which I noticed is that of a steamer, which has been added to the establish ment, and in which the governor intends visiting"], [346, "[1839. 288 COLUMBIA RIVER. the ports within his jurisdiction. For this place, constructed here, (and her machinery from America,) she will be very useful; but compared with anything in Europe she is very poor. Being (as usual) unfortunate in our breezes, it was not until the 28th that we reached the mouth of the Columbia, when Lieutenant Kellett, having descried us, weighed and stood out with the Starting to conduct us in. Fortunately the weather admitted of our entering, otherwise the very imperfect sailing directions might have led us into danger. The shoals in the entrance of this river have most materially changed their features within the last two years. Just at our last tack, which would have taken us safely to our anchorage, the ship tailed, and the flood forced her instantly on the bank, where it continued to press her inwards. Before any assistance could be rendered, the tide fell, and our anchors being already down, we had to await the night tide, when less sea prevails. She floated off on the flood, a breeze off shore having helped her, and anchored in security until the morn ing, when we weighed and ran up to our berth in Baker's Bay. Not so the Starling; in weighing (in ten fathoms) she tailed, and instantly lost her rudder. I had not then decided upon taking her up to Fort Vancouver, but this now became necessary ; and having seen the ship securely moored, and con-"], [347, ""], [348, ""], [349, "1839.] 289 ASTORIA. strueted a temporary rudder for the Starling, we started on the morning of the 31st for Fort George. On the Starling's arrival, Lieut. Kellett com municated with Mr. Douglas, the chief of the Hudson Bay Company at Fort Vancouver, who very promptly sent us a guide, pilot, and interpreter ; and Messrs. M'Leod and Birnie came down to call on him. The latter is clerk in charge of Fort George. Off this fort, the well-known \" Fort Astoria \" of Wash ington Irving, we anchored for the night. It has dwindled considerably since the Hudson's Bay Com pany took charge, who removed their chief esta blishment to Fort Vancouver, and allowed it to run to utter ruin. Not a vestige remains. A small house for Mr. Birnie, two or three sheds for the Canadians, about six or eight in number, and a pine stick with a red ensign, now represented Fort George. Not a gun or warlike appearance of any kind remains. One would rather take it for the commencement of a village than any noted fort. The scenery is similar to that of all the northern coast \u2014 wooded to the water's edge, and differing little excepting in the varieties of pine. The out line is pleasing, but no field for the painter, there being no contrast of tints, and too stiff an outline. The navigation is rather cramped, and it is really surprising that with so much capital at stake in shipping, &c, the company have not brought up a set of pilots, by which many thousands might vol. i. u"], [350, "[1839. 290 ASCEND THE RIVER. have been saved, independent of the creation of such an useful body of men. After walking the bounds of ci-devant Astoria in company with Mr. Birnie, who explained where its lines formerly occupied, but where wildness and desolation now reigns, as well as examined the great fir mentioned by Douglas, Mr. Birnie ac companied us on board to dinner, and afforded us much valuable information respecting the river as well as the natives. On the morning following we proceeded on our voyage through the intricacies of Tongue Point Channel, and after grounding occasionally, which I take to be according to practice, managed by sunset to find a soft berth for the night, on \" an unknown spot where no bank ought to have been,\" according to our pilots. This delayed us one day, because vessels ground ing on the top of an evening flood do not float off with the returning day tide ; consequently we were compelled to await the night tide, which is generally higher in the Columbia, by about five feet, and pro bably caused by the sea breeze which blows strong near sunset. Our detention occurred close to the \" Pillar Rock,\" considered the second stage in the journey up. There is but little to interest one here \u2014 all the river between this and Tongue Point, as well as ten miles above, being an immense archipelago of"], [351, "1839.] 291 REMARKABLE SNAKES. islands and flats. Pillar Rock rises abruptly from the river in five fathoms, and is about thirty feet above the sea level. The summit has an area of ten feet by five, with light bushes and long grass. On the 5th of August we passed round the southern side of Puget's Island, and without any thing worthy of remark reached Oak Point, where we anchored for the night. At Puget's Island the scenery may be said to change, the foliage being mixed with ash, willow, alder, maple, &c. I noticed the cypress also amongst the pine, but its timber here is of no value. Indeed I have not heard of the cypress of Norfolk Sound below that latitude, although the same tree in leaf, bark, and other cha racters, occurs here. At Oak Point the river becomes narrow, and the navigation, from a general sufficiency of depth for vessels drawing fifteen to eighteen feet, is very simple; the breeze generally blowing up the river from ten a. m. until four p. m. At several of im positions I noticed numerous water-snakes, but they were harmless. They are termed \" the fishing snake\" by the people at Fort Vancouver, where I had an opportunity of witnessing their worrying a fish on shore, by seizing it by the pectoral fin, and guiding it into shallow water, and eventually on the mud. In one of the largest of these snakes we found several full-formed young, probably within a few days of their birth ; proving these reptiles to be viviparous. u 2"], [352, "[1839. 292 INDIAN BURIALS. On the 7th we passed Corpse Island and Coffin Mount of Vancouver, positions deriving their names from being the burial places of the numerous Indians which once frequented these banks during the salmon season. It is the custom of these tribes to bury each in dividual in a canoe ; and according to his wealth so are they laden with his worldly goods ; care being taken to render the greater part of the utensils, as copper kettles, &c, useless, by driving an iron bar through the bottom. The bodies are wrapped closely in mats, but I could not ascertain whether they make use of any particular preparation. BURIAL CANOE.

It is on record, that part of the crew of a vessel, on her return to this port, suffered because a person who belonged to her (but not then in her) was known to have taken a skull ; which, from the process pursued in flattening, has become an object of curiosity. In the year 1836, the small-pox made great ravages; and it was followed a few years since by the ague. Consequently, Corpse Island and Coffin Mount, as well as the adjacent shores, were studded, not only with canoes, but, at the period of our visit, the skulls and skeletons were strewed about in all direc tions ; and as I was on most of these positions un noticed by the natives, I suspect the feeling does not extend much beyond the relatives, and then only until decay has destroyed body, goods, and chattels. The chiefs, no doubt, are watched, as their canoes are repainted, decorated, and greater care taken by placing them in sequestered spots; they are propped up about six feet above ground, and well covered with mat, to defend them from wea ther. On the 9th, after being nearly devoured by mos quitoes, we reached Fort Vancouver, where we were very kindly received by Mr. Douglas, and apartments allotted to us."], [354, "[1839. 294 PORT VANCOUVER. Fort Vancouver is situated in latitude 45\u00b0 35' 53\" N., longitude 122\u00b0 20' 10\" W., and, as the crow flies, eighty-two miles from Cape Disappointment, the northern head of entrance into the Columbia. It stands about three hundred yards within the northern edge of the river ; is a picketed enclosure three hundred yards square, thepickets being eighteen feet high, composed of roughly-split pine logs. No particular attention to strength has been paid in its construction. It is furnished with three gates, two of which are invariably open by day. The houses of residence, as well as storehouses of the company, are within this enclosure, forming two squares. No guard is observed. The trading store is open during working hours, and any increase of number amongst the Indians would not excite uneasiness on the part of the officers. Such was my impression : and conversation, short of putting the direct question, confirmed it. In the eastern square the main building is occu pied by the chief, in which also is the sala or mess room. In front of the steps of this building are two long twenty-four pounders ship guns, and two short merchant ship carronades twelve or eighteen pounders. On the left, at right angles, are the quar ters of the other clerks, traders, &c. Those who have married the Canadian half-castes generally live in their quarters, or only come to the general table when it suits. It is not a little strange in a com munity so long establishes!, that the women should"], [355, "1839.] 295 CANADIAN VILLAGE. still be almost totally unacquainted with the lan guage of their husbands. In the rear of the fort is an excellent kitchen garden and orchard, occupying about the same space as the fort, (three hundred yards on its sides,) and behind this a large tract of cultivated land, with extensive storehouses, barns, &c, and abund ance of grain in stack. To the westward are situated, without the pali sades, at a distance of a quarter of a mile, the hospital and houses of the Canadian establishment, forming a complete village. All is apparently de fenceless ; although when turned out, every man will be found with a well-tried rifle and couteau de chasse, or other efficient means of defence ; and their partners are efficient helpmates, in the literal sense of the phrase. Yet, comparing this spot with Sitka and other places, it speaks volumes for the discipline to which the Indians have been reduced, as well as for the content with which all the tribes are evidently em bued. As to the appellation of Fort Vancouver, it is clearly a misnomer ; no Fort Vancouver exists ; it is merely the mercantile post of the Hudson's Bay Company. In the neighbourhood, about two miles down the river, they have a very extensive dairy, numerous cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, &c. ; and about three or four miles up the stream, water-mills, for grinding,"], [356, "296 [1839 NATURE OF SUPPLIES. \u25a0^ sowing planks, and an establishment for curing salmon \u2014 the two latter objects forming the princi- pal export to the Sandwich Islands. The attention of the chief to myself and those immediately about me, particularly in sending down fresh supplies previous to my arrival, I feel fully grateful for, but s cannot conceal my disappoint ment at the want of accommodation exhibited to wards the crews of the vessels under my command, in a British possession. We certainly were not distressed, nor was it im peratively necessary that fresh beef and vegetables should be supplied, or I should have made a formal demand. But as regarded those who might come after, and not improbably myself amongst the num ber, I inquired in direct terms what facilities her Majesty's ships of war might expect, in the event of touching at this port for bullocks, flour, vegetables, &c. I certainly was extremely surprised at the reply, that \" they were not in a condition to supply.\" As any observation here would be useless, and I well knew this point could be readily settled where authority could be referred to, I let the matter rest. But having been invited to inspect the farm and dairy, and been informed of the quantity of grain, and the means of furnishing flour, \u2014 and not withstanding the profusion of cattle and potatoes, no offer having been made for our crews, I regretted that I had been led into the acceptance of private supplies ; although at that time the other officers of"], [357, "1839.] 297 PLAN OF COLONIZING. the establishment had told my officers that supplies would of course be sent down. Sturgeon, however, were in abundance; and though we had lately killed our last bullock, (embarked at Atooi,) San Francisco would soon be reached. Some few years since the company determined on forming settlements on the rich*1 lands situated on the Wallamette and other rivers, and providing for their retired servants by allotting them farms, and further aiding them by supplies of cattle, &c. That on the Wallamette was a field too inviting for mis sionary enthusiasm to overlook ; Jbut instead of se lecting a British subject to afford them spiritual assistance, recourse was had to Americans, \u2014 a course pregnant with evil consequences, and particularly in the political squabble pending, as will be seen by the result. No sooner had the American and his allies fairly \" squatted,\" (which they deem taking posses sion of the country,) than they invited their brethren to join them, and called on the American govern ment for laws and protection ! This position has not only become the bone of contention which has again roused the Americans, but, from the fact of containing many of the old servants of the company unaccustomed to restraint, and whose first appeal is to their trusty rifle, is very likely to cause some trouble. They are now loud in their claim of right to the soil, and a colony of American settlers was en route in the plains when we quitted. On the other river, Catlamet, they have two mis-"], [358, "[1839. 298 CLAIMS OPEN TO OBJECTION. sionaries, one Protestant, the other Roman Catholic ; but as this is a company's farm, and on the north side, I believe that there is no present fear of in trusion. The territory has at length, by dint of British capital and perseverance, attained such importance, that America doubtless is anxious to open the field to her subjects ; and having her eyes open to what has been virtually lost in an over-reaching attempt by the Astor Company, to obtain a value by negocia tion, for that which in a few hours would have been public British property by capture, she attempts to dis avow the legality of the transfer. This renders the matter still worse, as, had the capture taken place, they might, with some plea of propriety, have looked for its restoration at the peace. But if bona fide purchasers are, at this late date, to be marred in their speculation, the ultimate consequences of which they doubtless anticipated, then must we bid fare well to good faith in mercantile transactions ; for in no other light than that of a plain transfer of private property can it honestly be contemplated. The possession of the trading post at Fort Van couver (not the Fort Astoria, purchased from the Americans by the British Company) cannot in any way be questioned in reference to the Columbia territory. That boundary line must first be defined before America ventures to claim any point of the head-quarters of the Hudson's Bay company.

In 1834, an expedition was fitted out (from Fort Vancouver) to establish a trading post on the river Stikine, which falls into Clarence Straits, and is situated in 56\u00b0 N., 131\u00b0 10' W.; but the Russians. having notice of their intention, had erected a blockhouse, and placed one of their corvettes at the mouth of the river, to prevent their effecting their object. By the treaty of 1825 (vide Appendix) completed with the Russian government, Articles 3, 6, 7, and 11, it was agreed that the Russians were to occupy from their outward boundary, viz., 54\u00b0 40' N., and 131\u00b0 to 133\u00b0 W., a parallel band of thirty miles, above 54\u00b0 40' N., but clearly reserving the right on the part of the British traders to \"freely navigate all the rivers which crossed the line of demarcation.\" And as it was moreover a prominent feature of that treaty, that neither party under any circumstances should have recourse to force, without first transferring the dispute to their government ; a formal appeal was made to Baron Wrangel, at that period Governor of Sitka, but without success. It is probably fortunate that this article tied the hands of our spirited northwesters, or the question of blockade would have assumed a very different feature. By this occurrence the loss to the company"], [360, "300 [1839 ENORMOUS TIMBER. was assumed at \u00a320,000, but as the Russian govern ment disapproved of the conduct of their governor, I am informed the question was satisfactorily con cluded, and expenses recovered. The timber of the Columbia, either for spars or plank, cannot be compared to that of the higher latitudes ; for topmasts and topgallant masts it is probably as tough, but heavier; oak and ash are better. Probably no part of Western America can produce timber of the dimensions grown in the regions of the Columbia and the northern confines of Cali fornia. Amongst the drift trees on the banks of the Columbia, we measured one, one hundred and seventy four feet in length by twenty feet circumference; many one hundred and fifty by thirteen to eighteen. These of course were washed from its banks, and therefore not the largest, which grow invariably in the thickest parts of the wood. Mr. Douglas, in his narrative, gives the dimensions of one of great size at Astoria. Being desirous of witnessing the powers of the hunters in carrying heavy burthens, which they are stated to perform through the fords, several of the strongest were duly laden with the customary tra velling pack of four pieces, which may vary from one hundred and eighty to three hundred and sixty lbs.

The company usually keep two migratory trapping parties, of fifty men each ; one between the Columbia and the bay of San Francisco, near the coast; the other in the interior, about the head-quarters of the Sacramento. This latter party noticed us in the Sacramento in 1837, but mistaking us for the Cali fornians, were afraid to make themselves known.

The communication to Hudson's Bay in the March and September journey usually occupies three months and ten days. The Wallamette settlement was commenced in 1830, by a few of the H. B.

The seasons gradually change, as in Europe ; being tem perate in summer, ranging as high as 95\u00b0 to 100\u00b0 in the shade, and in winter as low as 4\u00b0. The prevalent diseases are fever, ague, and ca tarrhal affections. Consumption is frequent amongst the natives. Having completed the Starling's refit, we com menced our return, surveying the river downwards. We had reached Puget's Island, when she unfortu nately drifted on a snag, (or stump of a tree under"], [363, "1839.] 303 JAPANESE WRECK. water,) and broke her rudder short away, taking with it the lower part, with all the metal work. On this occasion I merely despatched the requisite officers to Fort Vancouver with fresh demands, and moved downwards with the Starling to Fort George, where I purposed bringing the ship up to assist in the survey. We met with several grotesque figures resembling our friends at Sitka, and one in the full dress of some volunteer militia band. He was in a very long canoe, fancifully carved. But the noted characters, as proteges of the company's officers, were the Chinook chief and his lady, well known as Choo mamis and Sally. Their fishing village is on the north side, near Baker's Bay, at the entrance of the first creek. Blankets, and rum diluted four times, were the principal demands for objects ; but these were very scarce, including skin boots, bows, arrows, salmon, sturgeon, deer, and paddles. WRECK OF THE JAPANESE JUNK.* We received from the officers of the Hudson's Bay establishment several articles of Japanese china-* which had been washed on shore from a Japanese junk, wrecked near Cape Flattery.

The two fell into the hands of the Hudson's Bay Company, and were sent to England. I saw them on my arrival at Vancouver in 1834.\" Mr. Birnie states, it was at Cape Flattery, and not as above ; and on this point his local know ledge makes him the best judge. \" There were,\" he says, \" two men and a boy purchased from the na tives. As soon as it was known that some shipwrecked people were slaved among the natives, the Hudson's Bay Company sent their vessel Lama, Captain M'Neal, to obtain them by barter ; and there was some trouble in redeeming the boy. They were subsequently sent to England, and thence home; but their countrymen refused to receive them.\" Further my informant could not acquaint me. By the winter of 1833, Captain Wyeth means, pro bably, the commencement of that year, as will presently appear more likely. There had been many people on board the junk, but distress had greatly thinned them ; and several dead bodies were headed up in casks. About the same time another Japanese junk was wrecked on the island of Oahu, Sandwich Islands. From the Hawaiian Spectator, vol. i. p. 296, I have the details. \" A junk laden with fish, and having nine hands on board, left one of the southern"], [365, "1839.] 305 IMPRESSION OF THE HAWAIIANS. islands of the Japanese group for Jeddo, but, en- countering a typhoon, was driven to sea. After wandering about the ocean for ten or eleven months, they anchored on the last Sunday of December, 1832, near the harbour of Waialea, Oahu. Their supply of water during the voyage had been obtained from casual showers. On being visited, four persons were found on board; three of these were severely afflicted with scurvy, two being unable to walk, and the third nearly so. The fourth was in good health, and had the sole management of the vessel. After remaining at Waialea five or six days, an attempt was made to bring the vessel to Honolulu, when she was wrecked off Barber's Point, on the evening of January 1st, 1833. Everything but the crew was lost, with the exception of a few trifling articles. The men re- mained at Honolulu eighteen months, when they were forwarded to Kamtschatka, from whence they hoped, eventually, to work their way, by stealth, into their own country, approaching by the way of the most northern islands of the group. \" When the peo- ple (Hawaiians) saw the junk, and learned from whence it had come, they said it was plain, now, whence they themselves originated. They had sup- posed before, that they could not have come from either of the continents ; but now they saw a people much resembling themselves in persons, and in many of their habits ; a people, too, who came to those islands without designing to come ; they said, ' It is plain, now, we came from Asia.'

But it must be observed, that since the wreck of the junk near Cape Flattery, the current of conjecture on this sub ject is, probably, highly Japanese. It appears that a vessel with many hands on board, and laden with bees'-wax, entered the bay and was wrecked ; she went to pieces, and the crew got on shore. Many articles were washed on shore, and particularly the bees'-wax. This latter is even now occasionally thrown upon the beach, but in smaller quantities than for merly. I have one specimen now in my possession. THE CHARACTER OF THE INDIANS ON THE COLUMBIA PRACTISING COMPRESSION OF THE HEAD. Among primitive nations, it is not uncommon to find them attempting to improve nature's handiwork, by some peculiar method of distortion. We will pass over the Chinese and Europeans. They con descend to control the feet and waist : our friends here have a nobler aim, and set to work on the head. In that part of the coast more particularly known as the north-west, it is universal with the women to incise the lower lip, and, by gradual distension, to insert a piece of wood of no small dimensions, even to upwards of two inches in length. When this is removed, a second mouth is exposed, rivalling in dimensions the first. And even this practice has its"], [367, "1839.] 307 EXTENT OF THE PRACTICE. fashion and variety. The custom of compressing the head in infancy is not practised here extensively. On the coast it is limited to a space of about one hundred and seventy miles, extending between Cape Flattery and Cape Look-out. Inland, it extends up the Columbia to the first rapids, or one hundred and forty miles, and is checked at the falls on the Wal lamette. In this small compass there are several tribes having this one distinctive badge. Those with whom travellers are most likely to come in contact are the Chenooks, Clatsaps, Killimooks, Chee-hee lees, and Shlakatats. We first witnessed the practice in the house of Choonamis, a chief of the Chenooks. The infant, very soon after birth, is placed horizon- tally in a small wooden cradle, wrapped up in a fur, and lashings are repeatedly passed across it, so as to x 2"], [368, "[1839. 308 MOST PROMINENT QUALITIES. render the body nearly motionless. At the top of the cradle is a well, rather below the level of the rest, in which the head is sunk, and compresses are fitted in between the head and the extremity of the box, till the required pressure is produced. The compresses were of basket work, and some were ornamented with bells. I imagine the children do not suffer much. We saw one placed in the ma chine. It cried at first, as a baby in England would when put in a cradle, but a little rocking soon quieted it. The practice would not appear to be prejudicial to the development of the mind ; and the testimony of those long acquainted with these people supports this opinion. As a nation, the first thing that struck us was their facility in picking up our words, even to short sentences, and repeating the whole tolerably correctly. Their pronunciation is also good, though the intonation of our respective languages is widely different. The women are always plying their fin gers over some basket work, or constructing mats. Formerly both sexes spent much of their time in carving rude figures of men or animals; but their communication with Europeans is yearly rubbing off some old custom. They are fond of colours ; the women construct showy leggings with cloth and beads, and the men often display gaudy shot-belts and other articles of the chase. Like all Indians, they are patient in the pursuit of an object. They will dub away at a tree for months, till it becomes a"], [369, "1839.] 309 CARVINGS, SLATE PIPES.

They are exceedingly lax in morals, and attached to spirits > yet, we have found them undeviatingly honest. Their forms of religion would appear few. In their houses they have some few wooden images, and to imply their functions point to heaven. Parental affection would not appear strong. Abortion is much practised. They have usually very few chil dren. These they display some affection for, which is often indifferently met by the offspring. Towards their dead they exhibit the greatest respect. After death the body is placed in a canoe, wrapt up in mats ; the whole is then covered over, and the worldly property of the deceased is placed near him. They will not allow strangers to approach the place of sepulture. Curiosity must be gratified at a re spectful distance. The entombed bodies are placed in open spaces in the woods, often near a foot-path ; but we were not allowed to overstep the road to wards them. As they advance in age the flattening becomes gradually removed ; thus, few persons of forty or fifty have a very compressed head. The children often have heads twice as broad as long, but no thing like this have I seen in advanced life. The compression is carried to a greater excess in per sons of high rank or caste than in others; thus, the chiefs and their wives usually have the flattest heads. Slaves, and their children, are not permitted the prac tice. The operation is usually completed under a"], [371, "1839.] 311 QUIT COLUMBIA RIVER. year. The Indians called Flatheads live on the upper branches of the river, and, we were informed, have not this practice \u2014 lucus a non lucendo. It is, how ever, not quite confined to the Columbia. The Starling being again complete, we dropped down to Baker's Bay, taking leave of our friend, Mr. Bimie, in charge of Fort George, who had been unremitting in his attentions. On the morn ing of the 14th September, we quitted Baker's Bay, with light breezes, but, owing to the peculiarity of the currents, did not clear the heads until the wind failed, compelling us to anchor. Before the tide had done, the sea-breeze came on strong ; very fortunately, I had taken the precaution to reef and be in a condition to beat out, and had just completed, when the strength of the breeze"], [372, "[1839. 312 BODEGA. parted our cable. Sail was made in time to tack short of the dangers, and as the opposite course led to sea, I was heartily glad, after this second escape, to leave the anchor, and get clear of this disastrous port. Any attempt to recover the anchor would have proved futile, and probably resulted in losing the only one remaining, with imminent risk to the ship. The Starling at the same instant met with a similar accident, leaving also her last anchor but one. Heartily sick of this nest of dangers, we took our final look at Cape Disappointment, and shaped our course for Bodega. We arrived on the morning of the 20th September, in a thick fog, off the set tlement of Ross, (of which Bodega is the port, dis tant about thirty miles southerly,) and having stood into fifteen fathoms, we suddenly observed the trees on the heights over the fog, and presently, on its clearing off, found ourselves within gun-shot of the settlement. The signal being made for a pilot, but not answered, the Starling despatched an officer to the fort, who brought off two, and we then bore away for Bodega, where, leaving the Starling to commence its survey, we parted for San Francisco to secure the meridian distance. Night and fog, however, shut us out, and having twice found ourselves in very awkward positions, we were compelled to anchor until daylight. About ten a.m., getting a glimpse of the land, we weighed, and shaped our course for it, the fog clear ing as we entered the heads. We passed our Russian"], [373, "1839.] 313 LITTLE RUSSIA. friend, the corvette, which we left at Sitka, and ran on to our old anchorage. We found here the governor of Ross, Mr. Alexandre, an old acquaintance at Sitka, who was here for the purpose of purchasing grain, &c. His expressions of regret at being ab sent during our visit at Bodega, were very warm, and I believe sincere ; but the same feeling of dis trust, arising from the anticipated rupture between Russia and Great Britain, appeared to produce more than ordinary reserve. I am satisfied that some of the residents had bantered him upon our speedy departure, having for its object the capture of the corvette outside. Having succeeded in my observations, I sailed again that evening, and reached Bodega after an absence of only forty-eight hours, where we were doubly fortunate, in obtaining the sun, and securing its position, fogs frequently reigning for several days in succession. The openness of the bay, and the reported dangers of the anchorage, prevented my absenting myself from the neighbourhood, or I certainly should have paid a visit to the Russian settlement at Ross. I was also very anxious to take advantage of the fine in terval to secure the survey of the bay. I am, there fore, indebted to a friend who resided there a few days for part of the following description ; part is from my own observations by telescope. The Russian presidio of Ross (little Russia) is situated about thirty miles to the northward of the"], [374, "314 [1839. KODIACS. bay, or port, of Bodega, on land elevated about one hundred feet above the sea, the outline of which is cliffy, with alternate rocky and gravelly mar gin, rendering landing, excepting in very fine weather, nearly impracticable. The anchorage off is bad, by reason of beds of rock above and below water, and the constant liability to fogs, render ing it unsafe to break ground, unless with a fair wind. The hills above it, which command the presidio, are sparingly clothed with fir trees. The main government establishment, or fort, as such enclosures are termed in these countries, consists of a large square, fenced in with strong planks of fifteen feet in height, and furnished with block-houses or watch towers at two angles ; one commanding the sea, and the other the land sides, or coverin-j the east, south, and west faces. These towers, armed with three guns each, in a second story, are on a level with the top of the fence. Within the square are contained the com pany's warehouses, the governor's house, a dwelling for the officers, and a chapel. The square has but one entrance, which is by large folding gates towards the sea. The governor's house is situated at the back of the square, facing this gate, the officers' houses and chapel on either side. The gate is guarded by a sentinel with a cutlass, and at night it is closed. This sentinel has no uni form, but is one of the company's establishment,"], [375, "1839.] 315 RUSSIAN FARM. which, in 1836, amounted to three hundred, and who live without the inclosure. On the N. W. are situated the stables for the cattle, a large granary, with a threshing machine capable of cleaning one hundred bushels of corn per day ; a windmill ; and to the southward, in a deep ravine which partly forms the bay, are three large tiled buildings, con taining forges, carpenters' shops, and storehouses for boats and fishing craft. Besides these buildings, there are on the slope of the hill, about twenty huts for the Kodiack Indians, of whom the establishment generally em ploy about fifty to sixty, in their skin boats, some of which are capable of containing one hundred men, and carrying about seven tons. They are constructed similarly to the old English coracle, viz., of strong boat-shaped frames, sharp at each end, over which the skins of the sea-lion are tightly stretched. Those to the northward of the Aleutian chain are covered with the skin of the walrus. In the centre of the yard or square, in front of the governor's staircase, a brass nine-pounder gun commands the gateway, and within the governor's hall is the armoury for the establishment, which is well stored with cutlasses and fire-arms. Between this presidio and Bodega, the Russians have a small rancho, (farm,) from, which they reap in a favourable year as much as three thousand bushels of wheat. This is probably the farm in dispute, which report gives out to be the property"], [376, "[1839. 316 ANCHORAGE. of a ci-devant British subject. The Californian government are, however, too weak to contend even with any half dozen adventurers, and it is needless to ask for their interference. Bodega is an extensive bay, almost joining (by a creek) the port of Sir Francis Drake at its southern end, which is very shallow. On the northern side of the bay, at a small creek or estuary, (nearly dry at low-water springs,) stand two Rus sian buildings; \u2014 one a store-house, the floor of which was filled with grain and a few marine stores, and the other the residence of those left in charge, amounting perhaps to three men, their wives, and children. The anchorage is within a rocky islet, with a reef and bank extending about three quarters of a mile, w*hich is covered thickly by fucus giganteus. The bottom is coarse sand, with some patches of clay, but bad holding ground. Here, however, it is cus tomary for the Russians (who have excellent ground tackle) to ride out the south-west gales, inasmuch as the heavy swell which immediately tumbles in, or generally precedes, prevents any moderate sailing vessel from making any head, and the sea-room is but scant. I am informed that the Russians have experienced several losses here, but no lives.

I am satisfied, also, that it is as good, and more expedi tiously obtained than at Sausolito, San Francisco, where it is necessary to fill from wells, and injure the boats embarking it. Having made a survey of the anchorage as far as the fog permitted, and being anxious to save better weather on the southern coasts of California, we quitted Bodega in a thick fog, and pursued our course to San Francisco. Fortunately it cleared suffi ciently to round Punta de los Reyes the same after noon, and to enable us to get well towards the mouth of San Francisco. One hour longer daylight would have ensured our entry, but being on the bar in four fathoms, with a heavy swell, and unable to make out the coast line, I was reluctantly com pelled to haul to the southward in fifteen fathoms, and anchor until daylight. Dawn found us still enveloped in fog; not even the Starling in view. Our delay enabled us to de termine, that southerly of the fairway line, (Alca traz and the fort in line,) the ebb tides set N.N.E., flood, S.S.W. About ten we got sight of the land, and ran in, the breeze freshening, as it generally does on entering the heads. This is a very common occurrence at this port, requiring small sail to beat out, and sud denly losing the tide and breeze together. It is, therefore, advisable to keep the fairway marks open until reaching the bar, before hauling to the south-"], [378, "[1839. 318 SAILING DIRECTIONS. ward, by which more wind will be procured and unpleasant swells escaped. We found our Russian friend, the corvette, at the outer anchorage, still waiting to get out. We grazed her pretty close, but her officers were either absent or did not make their appearance, and we passed on to our anchorage at Yerba Buena. Our stay here merely enabled us to take in a supply of bullocks and vegetables, and complete ob servations confirming those of former visits, when we moved on to Monterey. Before taking leave of this port, I would remark that, although my readers may fancy I have kept them too long in fog, to nautical men these very dates and observations may be important. Con sidering myself a fair pilot for this port, I would say to those approaching it ; after decreasing the depth from thirty to fifteen fathoms mud, if the wind is light, it is advisable, or preferable, to anchor and wait for daylight, or fog clearing off; but be prepared to weigh and stand off should the wind freshen.

MONTEREY. CHAPTER XIV On the 5th of October we reached Monterey, having parted from the Starling, and experienced fresh breezes. However, knowing my ground well, I had no hesitation in anchoring. We succeeded in completing our observations, and beat out the following morning. As my first rendezvous was Santa Barbara, I sought the Starling in that direction, where I found her cruising to intercept me. Off this part of the coast we experienced a very extraordinary sensation, as if the ship was on fire, and after very close in vestigation, attributed it to a scent from the shore, it being much more sensible on deck than below; and the land breeze confirming this, it occurred to me that it might arise from naphtha on the surface. Vancouver notices the same smell. We reached our anchorage in the bay of Santa Barbara about nine on the night of the 9th, having been assisted by lights displayed on board one of"], [381, "1839.] 321 MISSION OF SANTA BARBARA. the vessels, to which I had despatched a boat before dark. At sunset we were unable to discover the bay, and could barely distinguish a long, low, yellow line spitting to the southward and terminating abruptly. This eventually proved to be the high yellow cliffs of the western head, at least fifty feet above the sea. The customary guide in approaching the coast is the \" kelp line,\" which generally floats over five to seven fathoms. So long as a vessel can keep on its verge there is no danger ; this is the general opinion of those who have navigated this coast during their lives, and our observation has tended to confirm it. I know, however, that less than two fathoms have been found within it, barely at its edge. It is the fucus giganteus, and sufficiently strong to impede steerage, if it takes the rudder. The mission at Santa Barbara is situated on an elevation of about two hundred feet, gradually ascending in about three miles from the sea. The town is within a few hundred yards of the beach, on which the landing is at all times doubtful. The bay is protected from northerly and westerly winds, which prevail from November until March, and the swell is in some measure broken by the jslands of Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Miguel, to the westward. In March the southwesters blow with fury, which is contrary to the seasons south ward of Cape San Lucas. Even during the fine weather months, vessels are always prepared to slip VOL. I y"], [382, "[1839. 322 CHARACTER OF THE COAST. when the wind veers to S.E., from which point it blows with great violence, but soon expends itself. We were fortunate in landing comfortably, and by four o'clock, nothing of interest detaining us, we moved on towards San Pedro. Vessels occasionally anchor here within the five fathoms or kelp line, but are always prepared to warp out. This is a kind of inner bar. The kelp doubtless prevents much surf, and renders it inpre convenient to vessels discharging ; but the kelp during heavy gales is generally washed up. Having been requested to afford surgical assistance to a young man of one of the first families, who had fractured a limb, and was unable to be moved from Buenaventura, the Starling was despatched for that purpose, as well as to obtain its position, the slii|> standing close along the coast towards the bay of San Pedro. A short distance to the southward of Buenaventura the coast spits out in a low sandy point, off which the water shoals suddenly to seven fathoms. There is no danger if the lead be kept going. We noticed a lagoon over the sands. On the evening of the 11th of October, on open ing the bay of San Pedro, we noticed several lights, which, by the aid of the night glasses, were dis covered to belong to vessels at anchor. This re lieved us much ; for having suddenly shoaled from fifteen to five fathoms rocky, we had tacked offshore. In a short time, we anchored amongst the vessels in seven fathoms, when the masters of two American"], [383, "1839.] SAN PEDRO. 323 ships immediately came on board to offer their services, and the following morning those also of two brigs. The bay of San Pedro, which is situated in lati tude 33\u00b0 43' N., longitude 118\u00b0 14' W., is open to the south-west, but tolerably sheltered from the north-west. Inside of the small island in the bay is a very snug creek, but only accessible to small craft, by reason of a rocky bar, having only at low-water springs five feet. The only house near the bay is supplied with water from some miles inland ; and I am informed that at times the inhabitants are in great distress. It is only maintained for the convenience of trading with the vessels which touch here for the purchase of hides and tallow. Two of these vessels, under American colours, we visited, and found them fitted up transversely abaft the mainmast as shops, contain ing mostly hardware and linen drapery, which are much sought after by the farmers, who take them in part payment of their hides and tallow. We found some of their goods very useful to us, after so long an absence from cutlery shops. The cliffs of the western sides of the bay, which form the beach line, are very steep, about fifty feet perpendicular, descending from an elevated range, about five hundred feet above the sea. They are composed of a loose mud, mixed with lumps of a chalky substance, enclosing organic remains, some times running into chert or chalcedony. y 2"], [384, "[1839. 324 BAY AND MISSION OF SAN JUAN. It apparently results from volcanic action, and the frequent shocks of earthquakes have left the ground traversed by deep fissures. This chalky or pipeclay substance also occurs at Santa Barbara. Having completed this bay, we moved to the bay of San Juan, despatching the Starling, assisted by a cutter and mate, to examine the island and an chorage of Santa Catalina ; rejoining us at San Diego. On the evening of the 13th October, we dropped anchor in the bay of San Juan. Owing to the surf running at the time, and my objects rendering me, without any assistant, a perfect slave to duty, I was compelled to stick to a half tide rock, to effect the se curity of this position. The bay, or rather the outer rock, on which I observed, is situated in latitude 33\u00b0 27' N, longitude 117\u00b0 41' W. It has a high cliffy head to the north-west, but terminates in low sandy beaches to the southward. This bay was examined and surveyed. The anchorage is foul under five fathoms, is unprotected, and the landing bad. The mission is situated in a fruitful-looking shel tered valley, said to abound in garden luxuries, country wines, and very pretty damsels, whence the favourite appellation Juanitas. I suppose, therefore, that they ail assume this name. As many call here apparently, to my view, at risk of anchor and cable; I was induced to ask the master of a vessel, who called upon me, what brought him here. \" It is only visited for stock, fruit, or vegetables,\" was his dry reply."], [385, "1839.] 325 ANCHOR AT SAN DIEGO. At four we quitted San Juan, but owing to light winds, did not reach San Diego until the 17th of October, having anchored within the kelp the night previous. The kelp at this port is rather a nuisance to vessels drawing less than twenty to twenty-four feet, as it leads you at least two miles out of your way, to clear its tongue, having nothing under three fathoms over its whole bank. To those accustomed to the ground it is well, but to us lead-going gentry, who are compelled to stick rigidly to the laws we lay down, it would have been quite en regie to round this kelp, even by going ten miles further out of our line. It is very doubtful if the Sulphur would have done so if any breeze had helped her. The position on which our observations were made is the eastern spit of entrance, which was found to be in latitude 32\u00b0 41' N., longitude 117\u00b0 11' W. The port of San Diego, for shelter, deserves all the commendation that previous navigators have be stowed on it ; and with good ground-tackle a vessel may be perfectly land-locked. The holding ground is stubborn, but in heavy southerly gales I am in formed that anchors \" come home,\" owing to the immense volume of kelp driven into the harbour. It has been stated to me by an old sailor in this region, that he has seen the whole bank of fucus giganteus (which comprises a tongue of three miles in length by a quarter broad) forced by a southerly gale into this port. This, coming across the bows,"], [386, "[1839. 326 PORT OF SAN DIEGO. either causes the cable to part, or brings the anchor home. No vessel, however, has suffered from this cause. The chief drawback is the want of fresh water, which even at the presidio, three miles from the port, is very indifferent. This is strange, for I am perfectly satisfied that if proper precautions were observed in digging wells, the height of the penin sula must furnish water. This, however, to be maintained sweet must be constantly worked, and occasionally as dry as it can be reduced. The mission is situated up a valley, about seven miles from the presidio. There they have, not only the finest water, but a river or torrent flows from thence to the presidio during the rains, but in the dry season loses itself in the sand about half way. The soil is very loose, chiefly of volcanic sand and mud, mixed with fine pumice and scori\u00e6, which on the flats between the elevated ridges, where the rain has carried off the lighter particles, presents the ap pearance of finely-gravelled terraces. Several va rieties of cacti, particularly of the Turk's head va riety, were abominably abundant, very much to the discomfiture of our ascending parties in the pro secution of the survey. Since the missions have been taken from the padres, and placed under the administradores, they have fallen entirely into decay and ruin ; and it is not improbable that the whole country will ere long either fall back into the hands of the Indians, or find other rulers. During our visit they were very"], [387, "1839.] 327 ALARM FROM INDIANS. apprehensive of an attack, and had been one night at quarters, their arms (in the nineteenth century !) consisting of bows and arrows, inasmuch as they had no powder for any firearms they might have possessed. The garden, also famed in former days for its excellence, has now fallen entirely into decay, and instead of thousands of cattle, and horses to take care of them, not twenty four-footed animals re main ! The trade of the port consists entirely of hides and tallow ; but not, as formerly, from the missions ; for they have long been fleeced. It has now be come a complete speculation. It is necessary that one of the parties should reside on the spot, proba bly marrying into some influential family, (i. e. in hides and tallow,) to insure a constant supply for the vessels when they arrive. It is dangerous for them to quit their post, as some more enterprising character might offer higher prices and carry off their cargo. But little wine is made since the virtual death of this mission, and that little of very inferior quality. I believe that at the neighbouring mission of San Luis Rey the principal wines are made, as well as a very pure spirit resembling Italia, whisky, or the pisco of Peru. We found tolerable sport between daylight and the breakfast hour, in killing rabbits, hares, ducks, and cordoneces, (quail of California). The seine afforded also a plentiful supply of excellent fish."], [388, "328 [1839 GAME. Having remained here five days, in order to rate the chronometers, a tolerable survey was made of the port. On the afternoon of the 22nd, we quitted San Diego, intending to land and fix the position of Cape Colnett ; but about eight in the evening of the 23rd, having rounded the Cape, we found such a heavy swell rolling in, that landing was imprac ticable. Cape Colnett was however fixed by the Starling on the day following, by the sea horizon, when she also found the rollers too heavy. Our course was now directed for Port San Quentin, off which we anchored on the morning of the 24th, in four fathoms. I landed immediately to secure the position, and the boats were despatched to discover the channel. About three p. m., how ever, the water at the ship had fallen so much as to render her immediate removal necessary. We ac cordingly weighed, and having made a tack to the westward, found the water decrease ; tacked, ground ing in stays, and after a series of gambols of this nature, which did not prevent her staying, succeeded in entering the port, where we finally anchored in a snug berth, in seven fathoms. No damage beyond a slight shock to the chronometers. As this port is but little known, it became of still more importance that it should be strictly exa mined. Not that it affords anything equal to San Diego ; but it is more secure when within, and might afford fresh water."], [389, "1839.] 329 PORT SAN QUENTIN. The sandy point on the left side of entrance is situated in latitude 30\u00b0 22' N., longitude 115\u00b0 56' 33\" W., Var. 12\u00b0 6' E. The whole coast is dreary, being either sand hills or volcanic mountains, five of which, very remarkably placed, caused one of the early navigators to term it the Bay of Five Hills. It is the Bay of the Vir gins of former, and Port San Quentin of the later Spanish surveyors. As it appears engraved under the latter, on an extensive scale, (which misled us, and caused our touching,) I have preferred that name for it. The island and paps of Las Virgines, are situated to seaward, about two miles from what has been termed Observatory Peak in our plan. We found little to interest us here in the way of natural history. Ducks, curlew, and a few cor doneces, were all that were noticed. A very neat specimen of rattlesnake, about three feet in length, with nine rattles, was taken alive and preserved. I do not recollect that any new plants were noticed. Our examination of San Quentin being com pleted, we moved on for St. Bartholomew (or Turtle Bay) and the great bay or gulf of Magdalena, de spatching the Starling to make the examination of the island of Cerros and neighbouring spots, with directions to rejoin at Magdalena. On the 28th we passed the islands of Cerros and Natividad, and on the morning following anchored"], [390, "[1839. 330 SAN BARTHOLOMEW. in the bay of San Bartholomew, called also Turtle Bay by the whalers. As my principal object was the position, I could only effect the examination of our immediate anchorage ; but the sheltered position where the whalers resort to cooper, is within a range of reefs, which divide the bay, from seaward inwardly, into two parts. The surrounding land is high and mountainous, composed, as far as w*e had opportunity of examin ing, of every rock occurring in trap formations, but reduced to fragments, not exceeding four or five pounds in weight. Marine shells, similar to those found on the shores of the bay, were plentifully mixed up with this general debris, and in the layers between some clay beds, crystallized gypsum abounded. The bay is formed by a high range of loose cliffs on the north, and fine gravelly bay on the east, and a coarse sandy tongue connects a high peninsula or island at high water in its centre, (forming a third southern bay.) From this peninsula rocks extend northerly, partly under water, jutting into the heart of the bay, and forming a safe land-locked position, having five fathoms within. The place of observation on the northern head of the bay is situated in latitude 27\u00b0 40' N., longitude 114\u00b0 51' 20\" W., variation 10\u00b0 46' E. The anchorage we took up was in seven fathoms, sheltered from all but S.W. winds, but bad holding ground."], [391, "1839.] 331 GULF OF MAGDALENA. At four we quitted for Magdalena, where we an chored on the morning of the 31st. I was fully prepared to have found, as the name imported, an extensive bay; but on entering the heads, which are about two miles asunder, no land could be dis cerned from the deck, from north-west to north east or east ; and even after entering, it was quite a problem in this new sea where to seek for an chorage, our depths at first, even near the shore, ranging from seventeen to thirty fathoms. How ever, as the prevailing winds appeared to be wes terly, I determined on beating to windward, in which it eventually proved I was correct. About four p. M. we reached a very convenient berth in ten fathoms, with a very sheltered position for our ob servatory. Preparations were immediately made for the examination of this extensive sea, or what I shall in future term the Gulf of Magdalena. It is probable that this part of the coast formerly presented three detached islands ; viz. St. Lazarus range, Magdalena range, and Margarita range, with one unnamed sand island, and numerous sand islets. It is not improbable that its estuaries meet those from La Paz, forming this portion of southern California into an immense archipelago. Here we hoisted out the Victoria, and equipped her for sea service, placing her under the command of Mr. Richards, midshipman. The first part of our expedition led us up the northern branch of what held out some prospect of"], [392, "[1839. 332 REMARKABLE BEDS OF SHELLS. a fresh water river, particularly as frequent marks of cattle were noticed. In the prosecution of this part of our survey we noticed that the St. Lazarus range is only connected by a very narrow belt of sand between the two bays, and that the summits of some of these sandhills were covered, in a most extraordinary manner, by piles of fragile shells, which resembled those found recent in the gulf. At elevations of fifty and sixty feet, these minute and fragile shells were found perfect ; but on the beaches, either sea ward or within, not a shell was visible. This is the more extraordinary, as these sand wastes are constantly in motion, and drowning everything else, and yet these shells are always exposed ! On digging beneath them to erect marks, no beds of shell occurred, nothing but plain sand. It was further remarkable that they appeared to be collected in families, principally area, venus, cardium, and murex. When ostrea appeared, they were by themselves. The cliffs throughout the gulf abound in organic remains, and I cannot but believe that the same cause has produced the above unaccountable phenomena which I witnessed throughout a range of at least thirty miles. Having explored the westernmost estuary, about seventeen miles north of our observatory, until no end appeared to its intricacies, I resolved on attempt ing a second, which afforded a wider entrance, and offered deeper water. This was examined about four miles beyond the last, and it still offered ample"], [393, "1839.] 333 ESTEROS. scope for employment, the advance boat being at that moment in four fathoms, and distant heads in view; but considering that sufficient had been done to show that no hope offered of reaching fresh water, and the still unexplored extent of the gulf would engross all our spare time, I determined on adhering to its main outlines, which eventually offered so many intricacies as almost to baffle our patience. One circumstance connected with the examination of the second estuary afforded very strong proof that no fresh-water streams were in the vicinity. It was the fact of finding near our advanced position many large specimens of the Asteria Medusa, or Euryale, an Asteria seldom found but in pure, and generally deep salt water. At least twenty were taken by the dredge. By the 9th of November we had reached the eastern end of the first gulf, when the ship was moved into the second, the channel or strait connecting them being not more than a quarter of a mile wide. I had been very sanguine in my expectations that we should have discovered a safe channel out by the eastern end of the island of Margarita ; but until satisfied upon that point'I took the Starling and boats to explore. I found that our boats, and, upon emergency, the Starling, might have passed out, but it was far too doubtful and intricate for the ship. During the time the boats were thus engaged, I overlooked them from the summit of one of the"], [394, "[1839. 334 EXTENT OF ESTEROS. highest peaks of Margarita, and plainly saw tin outlines of the shoals, and difficulty of the navigation, even for boats. I had also a fine view of the southern unnamed island, which terminated in a crescent about ten miles to the S. E. with a passage very similar to that immediately beneath. We had frequently seen indistinctly the outlines of very high mountains to the eastward, distant about fifty or sixty miles. But on this day I could detect abrupt breaks, which indicated water courses between them, and could plainly follow out the yellow breaks of cliffs, as far as the eye could trace inland. I have not the slightest doubt that these estuaries flow past them, and probably to the very base of the most distant mountains, even into the Gulf of California. As I am informed that there are no fresh streams in the district of La Paz, and that similar esteros run westerly from that neighbour hood, it is not improbable that they meet. Although the solution of this question may not be commer cially important, it is one highly interesting in a geo graphical point of view. On the 18th of November, having been eighteen days engaged on this survey, we quitted the Gulf of Magdalena, shaping our course for Cape San Lucas. After all the time expended, independent of severe labour, on this immense sheet of water, it will naturally be inquired, What advantages does the"], [395, "1839.] NAVAL RENDEZVOUS. 335 port offer ? The reply is : at the present moment shelter; and from several watercourses nearly dry at the time of our visit, it is evident that very powerful streams scour the valleys in the winter season, which in this region is reckoned between May and October. Fuel can be easily obtained in the esteros, (man grove.) As a port for refit after any disaster, it is also very convenient ; and for this purpose, either our northern or southern observatory bays may be se lected. The latter would afford better shelter, but the former is certainly more convenient, and less liable to difficulty of navigation, the access to it being entirely free from shoals. In war it would be a most eligible rendezvous, particularly if watching the coasts of Mexico or California, as no one could prevent the formation of an establishment, without adequate naval force ; and the nature of the country itself would not main tain an opposing party. The island of Margarita would afford an excel lent site for a deposit for naval stores. Martello towers on the heads of entrance would completely command it, and, excepting on the inside, no force could be landed. Water would doubtless flow into wells, of which we had proof in spots where the wild beasts had scraped holes ; but from some (no doubt removable) causes, it was intensely bitter. There is nothing in"], [396, "[1839. 336 GEOLOGICAL FEATURES. the geological constitution of the hills to render it so. The ranges of hills composing the three suites of mountains vary from fifteen hundred to two thou sand feet, and are composed principally of frag ments of hornblende slate, serpentine, sandstone, and primitive limestone. The cliffs at the water side are generally mixtures of the above, containing balls of actynolite, serpentine, tremolite, asbestus, amiantus, and in many places extensive interlying beds of organic remains, similar to those occurring recent in the gulf. At one spot in particular, from whence I obtained specimens, the bed was wedge-shaped, running inwards about twenty or thirty feet, and about three feet in thickness at its then outer face. A large portion of the cliffs had fallen and been washed away. This was about a mile inland. The substance above and below was chiefly actynolite and serpentine. In the vegetable kingdom our botanical collectors were not idle. The following is from Mr. Barclay's report : \u2014 \"The plants of this place are of humble growth. If we except the mangrove trees growing upon the banks of the esteros, rhamnus olefolia, and rhamnus cuneatis, together with a soft deciduous tree on the island of Margarita, there will be nothing left de serving the name of ' tree.' The two species of rhamnus produce a solid reddish-coloured wood, which would at least make good fuel. On the banks"], [397, "1839.] 337 BOTANICAL FEATURES. of the esteros I found stachys coccinea, nemophylla paniculata, and a species of datura in flower, together with a scrophularineous herbaceous creeper, covered with its pretty flowers, and producing a singularly formed seed-vessel. The hills are covered with shrubs, amongst which I found Linaria latifolia, dendromecon douglasii, a species of mimosa with scarlet flowers, several curious forms of euphorbiaceous plants, gillia squar rosa, croton pulchella, and asclepias tenella. The cactus family are here very numerous, as well as rich in variety. The species most deserving of notice is, the large cylindrical cactus, which is from twenty-five to thirty inches in height, and from twenty-four to twenty-six in diameter. Mammillaria nobilis often attains a height above thirty inches, which is an unusual circumstance connected with the growth of this species. Another singular form of this tribe, with flat com pressed spines, came under my notice. The plant creeps along the surface of the ground, and produces a flower about six inches in length, the petals of which are white, with a pink stripe down the centre, which produces a fine effect. Of birds but few were noticed. Up the estero I noticed hares and the cordoneces; but, from my very limited visit, I had not time to follow them. The cuyotes, or dog-jackall, were numerous about the tents, which they visited after nightfall, but were VOL. i. z"], [398, "[1839. 338 BAY OF CAPE SAN LUCAS. valorously repelled by one of our dogs, a mixture of Nootka and Pointer. In conchology, size made up for deficiency in number, the cardium measuring about six or seven inches. On the 20th November we reached Cape San Lucas, and succeeded in establishing its position, the ship anchoring about two, in thirteen fathoms sand. They were nearly making a sad mistake after short ening sail, by finding, after the cast ten, that they had no bottom with eighty-eight fathoms, just as they were about to let go the anchor. This shows the neces sity of keeping the lead on the bottom, before letting go an anchor. I recollect a corvette losing an anchor and cables, at Teneriffe, by a similar neglect. After taking in a supply of wood, water, and ten bullocks, surveying the bay, examining the country, and completing our astronomical and magnetic obser vations, (during twenty-six hours,) we quitted this bay for San Bias, where our stores and provisions were to await our arrival. The bay of San Lucas offers safe anchorage, and shelter from westerly winds, but is exposed to a very heavy and most dangerous sea from the S. W. The soundings are very irregular, and the anchorage, by reason of its great depth in the centre, is com pletely on a lee-shore. At the village, consisting of four houses, inhabited by two Americans and some Californians, water, wood, cattle, cheese, oranges, and pumpkins, were"], [399, "1839.] 339 PRODUCTIONS. obtained. The water, which is procured from wells, is sweet when drawn, and very bright, but is im pregnated with muriate of soda and nitre, which per vade the soil. It consequently soon putrifies on board. Cattle are fine, varying in price from five to eight dollars, and ships of war calling or passing en route for San Bias or Mazatlan, will do well to take their bullocks here, as the Mexican beef is very in ferior, and does not afford as much nourishment even as the salt provision now supplied to her Majesty's service. Wood is about the same price as at San Bias. The cheese is good, at times excellent, and may be procured at any age ; it is the refuse of this market, and at treble price of that which is met with at Mazatlan or San Bias. The country about Cape San Lucas is mountain ous, and probably granitic ; as that found in the peaks in our neighbourhood, which we ascended, as well as that on the sea border, was a close-grained granite, very much disturbed or upheaved, and in immense blocks. The plains, as well as the hills, are very abundant in cacti, fourteen species of which were found in one spot. Mr. Barclay remarks, \" a handsome spe cies of loranthus here grows upon the cylindrical cactus, \u00e6nothera spectabilis, and a species of gossypium, the bark of which is used for making thread. The vegetation differs but little in generic productions from Magdalena, a circumstance which enabled me to procure ripe seeds of several plants, z 2"], [400, "[1839. 340 REACH SAN BLAS. which I only obtained in flower previous to our arrival at this place.\" The navigator has no hidden dangers to fear ; all are above water. After rounding the Frayles from the westward, he may safely stand for the houses, dropping his anchor in fifteen fathoms. The bad season is supposed to commence in June, and termi nate on the 1st of November. About four p. m., on the 24th, we reached San Bias. The sun was obscured, and there were evi dent signs of the rainy season not having entirely ceased ; the people looking cadaverous and inani mate. Having received my despatches, and learned that a transport was waiting at Mazatlan with stores and provisions, we weighed at dawn, and, favoured by a fresh S. E. breeze, reached that port in twenty hours ; rather an uncommon passage. Unfortunately we found the rains still falling, and that our stores and provisions had been warehoused in the Custom-house stores, thus giving us the additional trouble and expense of re-embarkation. No time was lost in effecting this, the delay affording me time to test our magnetic instruments previous to our homeward and long cruise. The contents of my instructions authorising my return by the western route, via Tahiti, and other points highly interesting in a magnetic point of view, it became important that a strict scrutiny should take place before my departure, under as great variety of temperature and exposure as I could"], [401, "1839.] 341 MAZATLAN. obtain naturally ; having found artificial increase of temperature involved hygrometric affections, probably more detrimental to the results obtained than any customary atmospheric variations. As I intended paying a visit to my friend Mr. Barron, at Tepic, I should there have an opportunity of a considerably lower temperature than I could otherwise obtain, and the observations would be further interesting from their height of three thousand feet above the sea level. Our chain of meridian distances from the Columbia, and ports interjacent up to San Bias and this point, were satisfactorily connected. The quantity of stores embarked amounting to more than twelve months for one hundred and thirty-six men, for the two vessels, independent of our remaining stock, it became necessary to stow the lower deck to the beams, and berth our crew on the maindeck. On the 4th December, we quitted Mazatlan, hav ing experienced great attention from the resident merchants. The conduct of Messrs. Kayser, Hayn, and Co., in having charged themselves with the entire transhipping our stores, &c., and making the necessary arrangements with the officers of the Custom-house, and refusing commission for the enor mous trouble, is beyond all praise, and I sincerely trust that the government have repaid them by more than words. The conduct of the Custom-house authorities also was very similar to that of Guayaquil ; the"], [402, "342 [1839. SAN BLAS. directed that no charges whatever should be levied ; and it is but due also to the administrador to state, that he took upon himself the responsibility of act ing up to the spirit of this order before its arrival. Mazatlan, since our visit in 1827, has increased from a village to a town, and, of course, has also its increase of bad characters. It is dangerous to be out at night, unarmed or alone. The only notices I have from Mr. Barclay are : \" The ficus tribe are amongst the leading features of the forest. Ficus obtusifolia, when wounded, yields a yellowish fluid of an adhesive nature, which the natives apply, in the form of a plaster, to broken limbs, (quebro duro.) The fruit of cathartocarpus fistuloides is used as a purgative ; and a shrubby species of verbena, abundant on the hills, is con sidered a sovereign remedy for asthma.\" We were again fortunate in our breeze, having returned to San Bias in twenty-four hours. Quitting the ship, accompanied by Lieut. Kellett, and our sur geon Mr. Hinds, we reached Tepic the following morning, having slept at the half-way house of Dona Manuela, of Navarete. The traces of the rains were yet fresh, and the roads considerably worse than at my last visit in 1837. Tepic, too, seemed to be rapidly declining; the wealth of former days, as well as the lively youthful faces, were fast wan ing. It was a melancholy feeling to recall the year 1828. My kind friend Mr. Barron received us with all"], [403, "1839.] 343 TEPIC the warmth for which he is famed, and nothing was omitted to do honour to our visit. Since my last visit Mr. Forbes, aided by Baron, Forbes, Junr. and Co., has constructed a cotton factory, superintended by Americans, which returns them at present more than ten per cent. A theatre has been built, very magnificent for this country, and the performances are far beyond anything one could expect. The people have also commenced laying out the suburbs in paseos, gardens, &c, and it is to be hoped that this place will in a few years, when events which have thrown a gloom over all have been forgotten, once more emerge from its present lethargy. During our visit the temperature ranged from 56\u00b0 to 76\u00b0, which answered all my expectations for magnetic purposes. The city and suburbs of Tepic are situated on a flat, formed by a shower of volcanic tufa, resem bling half burned pipe-clay, and generally termed by the residents \" pumice.\" \" Pumice \" is porous, fibrous, &c. ; but this substance, in addition to my preceding remarks on it, at times proceeds to vitreous masses like porcelain. Wherever the rocks protrude, they ap pear to be generally a bluish close-grained basalt, free from crystals of olivine, and plentifully studded with minute crystals of feldspar. The last mails from England having merely brought me copies of former letters, I inferred that it was expected I would not lose time in these re gions, and therefore, taking leave of our kind friends, we returned to San Bias, and having completed the rating of our chronometers, prepared for sea."], [404, "344 [1839. QUIT SAN BLAS. I found the ship too deep to be agreeable, having immersed her copper ; and having previously obtained the permission of the Admiralty, I disposed of the Vic toria to Mr. Forbes, for \u00a3100. This was one of the two vessels constructed in 1830, under my superintendence, for the African survey ; and the same which, under my present first Lieutenant (Monypenny,) in 1833, by mistaking my orders, made her passage from Gib raltar to England. Having done her duty well during ten years, connected with several of our establishments, we parted with her with mixed feel ings ; one of satisfaction \u2014 that of being relieved from her weight ; but the other of regret, arising from the loss of an old aid and pet, and the certainty that she never could be kept as she had been under the pendant."], [405, "CHAPTER XVII.

On the evening of the 21st Dec., we quitted San Bias \" homeward bound,\" but on a long but deeply in teresting cruise, in the novelty and delight of which all seemed to be deeply interested. With light airs from S. E., we cleared Tres Marias, shaping our course for the almost unknown islands of Socorro and Clarion, now, I trusted, to be definitively placed. In this we were entitled to be confident, should we be fortunate enough to obtain a landing, having sufficient proof of the value of our present force of chronometers. We ran over the position of San Benedict without noticing anything like land, and on the 25th December hauled to the south for Socorro. About four p.m., having ascertained our position by evening sights, and that the island ought to be visible, I went on deck to examine the horizon, and fortunately discovered its summit on our beam. But for this accident, we should possibly have been"], [407, "1839.] 347 ISLAND OF SOCORRO. another day seeking for it. Before dark we had the command of position for its examination the next morning, when we ran down for its southern side. The island is lofty, making in several peaks, the highest probably two thousand feet above the sea. The eastern coast is very dreary and forbidding. About nine we anchored in a small bay, where we effected a landing and secured our object, be sides making a plan of what I suppose to be Braith waite's Bay, of the charts, and in this presumption have assigned that name to it. Landing rocky ; shores of lava eoul6, and nothing like a beach. Neither wood nor water visible, although, from the constant clouds which hang over the high peaks, there must be a supply in some other point. Lieut. Wood was despatched to examine the western bay for wood or water. His report (not having landed) was, \" that goats were observed, the bay spacious, but no indications of wood or water visible.\" It is probable that the goats find water. I found this island to be placed fifty-two miles fur ther to the west than laid down in the charts ; but its latitude, correct. It was difficult to penetrate into the interior, even for a few hundred feet, owing to the prevalence of the cactus opuntia ; all who at tempted to do so suffered for their curiosity. One of my boat's crew made himself ill by eating a large bean, which grew abundantly ; but as I par took of them cooked without injury, I suspect him"], [408, "[1839. 348 tanner's beans. to have indulged too freely. I recollect an instance of a boy gorging himself with the seeds of the palma christi, and swelling to such a degree, that his life nearly paid the forfeit ; yet the instant he was out of his bed, he was caught with his pockets full, and had eaten about a handful. His excuse was, \" Why I ate a pint before I was taken ill.\" I suppose my youth had followed his example. \" Every evil has its use.\" \" Tanner's beans\" became a short warning, whenever any one was seen tasting unknown fruits. On quitting Socorro, the Starling was despatched to search for some other islands supposed to exist to the north-east of Clarion, and rejoin at that rendezvous. We had crossed over part of the same track in 1837 without success. On the evening of the 28th we made Clarion Island ahead, and by sunset were off a large bay on the south side, where, by the leadsman, we ought to have found sandy bottom in fifteen fathoms. We anchored, but owing to a sudden swell setting in from S. W., determined on standing off and on during the night. In attempting to weigh, we parted our cable, and lost our pet anchor, which held generally better than a bower, and was only fifteen hundred weight. On the following morning I landed on a point of rock, which ran out from a peninsula, and secured a good position on the main island for obtaining my"], [409, "1839.] 349 CLARION ISLAND. observations, the result of which gives this island ten miles to the eastward of its assigned position, and a little to the southward. It differs slightly in its features from Socorro, ex cepting that a whitish coloured fresh-water lake was found at the beach, and birds were more numerous ; viz., gannet, frigate pelican, several varieties of boobies, of tern, ducks, and doves. The plants were more luxuriant, our friend the cactus particularly so, but not so uncourteous as at Socorro ; it did not entirely stop the way. No streams were noticed. Fish were very numerous, and took the bait freely ; but they broke the hooks. Turtle plentiful ; two captured. Mr. Barclay notices, \" Argyreia rosea, and a species of ruta, run along the sand, the former extending to upwards of twenty-five feet in length. Cassia pendula, Guilandina bonducella, and a species of tetranthera, are among the plants which I found upon the higher ground. Con volvulus purpurea, and two species of phaseolus, are abundant in the ravines ; and a species of euphor bia, like the species heterophylla, and prickly pears, cover the ground in many places, and form a kind of stage for the leguminous plants to run upon.\" The Starling was unsuccessful in her search for the islands, and as the tracks of both vessels in 1837 were by day, there can be little doubt that Clarion has been multiplied. We were not fortunate enough to find wood or"], [410, "350 [1840. NO WATER. wholesome water in any way to justify a vessel seeking for those necessaries at these islands. Pos sibly distress might be relieved, but nothing beyond. Our course from Clarion was S. E., in order to make sure of any island said to exist in that direc tion ; and having run twenty-six miles before dark, it was useless to deviate longer from our course ; we therefore bore away S. W. by S., for the Marquesas. For the first few days we experienced a long heavy swell from the N. W., with the wind fresh at N. E. ; and we generally noticed birds. On reaching the parallel 12\u00b0 N., we first experienced rain, which rendered the sea smooth, but brought variable winds and heavy showers. For three days these were very troublesome, and continued so until reaching the fifth degree of north latitude, when the rain dwindled into showers. During this entire route, the gannet, frigate pelican, tropic birds, and booby, were constantly noticed. It fol lows that they are not decisive proofs of the vicinity of land. Rains still heavy in the squalls. This morning, 9th January, we observed a hawk or fish-eagle flying about the ship. It was shot, but fell over board, and we were going too fast to pick it up. During the night a calf, which was born on board, leaped through one of the ports, and was lost before a boat could be lowered : as it was not a man, she was not brought to in time."], [411, "1840.] 351 FALSE ALARM. The old N.W. swell increased far beyond anything I have before noticed in the Pacific. The wind at the same time hauling to the southward, backed us off to W. S.W., and in one of the rain squalls threw us so much on our lee, that we shipped much water through our maindeck and cabin ports. In this squall we observed the sunbeams on the horizon, through the surrounding rains, shining on the crests of the swell resembling very heavy rollers, and although I instantly perceived the cause and named it, yet having rivetted my attention for some time, I could hardly bring myself to believe they were not heavy rollers, \u2014 probably from hearing those around me confident that they were so. Upon similar grounds, doubtless, many of the reefs and islands in these seas have been reported. On the 14th, we crossed the equator in longitude 129\u00b0 W., no birds, weather fine, air 75\u00b0 5, sea 76\u00b0. Sent the water-bottle down, and obtained the tem perature from one to six hundred fathoms. On the 15th, the breeze hauled more to the east ward, enabling us to steer more westerly, which the former variables prevented. At one time I even doubted our reaching the Marquesas. On the 16th, in 5\u00b0 S., we again tried the tem peratures to six hundred fathoms. On the 20th, we made the island of Rooheoah, or Riou's Island, ahead, and passed on its eastern side, with a fine fresh N.E. breeze. This island has many remarkable conical rocks,"], [412, "[1840 352 MARQUESAS. and its outline, generally, is much broken ; particu larly towards its western extremity, where a cluster of islands and rocks form the only bay where any probability of landing seemed to offer. I am in formed that this bay has no beach, but that the landing: at the rocks is smooth. At ten we saw the island of Nuhuhivah through the haze. As seen from the eastward, it presents a long low point on its north-eastern limit, and high abrupt heads ; to the southward, that of St. Martin's, which forms the eastern head of Comptroller's Bay, being very abrupt, and capped with masses of rock like ruined castles. I was much disappointed in the height of the mountains, which I had been led to expect were very lofty, and mention is even made of a cascade three thousand feet in leap. The object of my visit requiring shelter for the ship, decided me on visiting this island in prefer ence to Santa Christina, and our course was, there fore, directed for Anna Maria Bay. On opening Point St. Martin, Comptroller's Bay nearly tempted me to beat in ; but as Vancouver's description of that of Anna Maria showed it to be preferable, we stood on, not, however, without anxiety, as no trace of an opening seemed to offer within the western point. Suddenly, however, a sandy beach opened behind an island, which presently discovered a deep and well-sheltered bay, but rather narrow for working. Shortly after, we noticed an European coming offin a whale-boat, who proved to be a pilot."], [413, ""], [414, ""], [415, "1840.] 353 PORT ANNA MARIA. Coming from the eastward, the port may be easily known by a very conspicuous lofty basaltic dyke, which perpendicularly intersects the eastern outer bluff Vessels intending to enter the bay should keep this bluff about a point on the starboard bow, rounding the island off it within a cable's length, when the wind generally leads in. All the eastern shores of the bay are \"bold to,\" and free from dan ger, and the wind will always lead off. The view of the entrance of the bay is beautiful, far surpassing anything I have noticed in these seas ; and although rugged, isolated masses of rock here and there start up, to add their sombre effect to the otherwise brilliant tints of the landscape, still the luxuriance of the slopes and valleys (and every inch where vegetation can thrive is stubbornly con tested) produces a sensation which cannot be justly entrusted to pen or pencil. If one did not asso ciate gentle slopes and levels with our ideas of paradise, I should say this is it. To those whose ardour would lead them to inaccessible green spots, where some goddess may dwell, here they may in dulge ; although, unless endued with the facility of moving through the air, their ecstasy might ooze out before reaching these tempting spots. After a very stubborn beat, we reached our an chorage in nine fathoms about dark, when the rain descended in torrents, not even allowing time to furl, and cooling our ecstasies considerably. Having arranged with the pilot to meet me on vol. i. a A"], [416, "[1840. 354 SUPPLIES TABOOED. shore the following morning, in order to select a spot for the observatory, where I might be free from the interruption of the natives, I landed at eight, and was not a little surprised at the entire want of curiosity which prevailed. This was soon explained. The king had given out that he expected a British ship of war to aid him in asserting his authority on this island, and particularly to assist him in his im mediate attack on the natives of the neighbouring bay of Taioa, situated to the westward, over the nearest ridge or neck. We were, therefore, tabooed from hogs, refreshments, or any intercourse with his followers, until our intentions were explained. Being out of his jurisdiction, this rather suited my purpose ; I therefore erected my tents in the eastern unfrequented bay, and quietly proceeded with my pursuits. The ship at the same time com pleted water from the town, where it was soon found that the taboo became a dead letter when interest was concerned. The spot selected for our observatory was pre cisely that occupied by Commodore Porter in 1814, and latterly by the officers of the French expedition in the Astrolabe and Zelee, \u2014 being a clear sandy bay to the eastward of the Pilot's Hill, which separates it from the town. The instant my observations were secured, I visited the king, and informed him, as well as his high priest, chiefs, &c, that as my visit was purely scientific, I could not enter into his views, which"], [417, "1840.] 355 WAR QUESTION. were decidedly at variance with anything he could expect from any civilized nation ; and I particularly impressed on the chiefs and people the utter folly of expecting aid in their brawls from any power. But as I thought that I might possibly be of assist ance in moderating, if not entirely quelling, their belligerent ardour, I requested the attendance of himself and chiefs at my tent the following day, where I had also invited to meet them, the resident missionary, Mr. Thompson, who was also very anxious to put an end to the war. The party having assembled, I proceeded to ex plain that it was, in the first place, perfectly impossi ble that the king could have been % promised the aid of Great Britain ; that neither arms nor ammuni tion could be afforded by my ship, nor by any vessel which followed, and that Great Britain, as well as every civilized nation, would deprecate their conduct. On the other hand, I volunteered to go with the king, and his friend Mr. Thompson, in the Starling, to negociate peace with the chiefs of Taioa and their allies, and to use all my weight in obtaining advan tageous terms, provided they consented to forego their present warlike intentions ; \u2014 it being their presumed intention to fight the ensuing day. I endeavoured also to convince the chiefs of the absurd falsehoods by which the king had blinded them, and to warn them not to commence hostilities until I had communicated with the Taioans ; and that if they acted in opposition, and injured any of my A A 2"], [418, "[1840. 356 WAR SUSPENDED. men, they might possibly find me a more important foe than the natives of Taioa Bay. They had fully set their minds on a fight ; whether death or not ensued, to them it was unim portant, so long as their powder was expended by musket ; ball was not important ; noise was impera tive. They were, however, persuaded to bottle up their valour until my departure, which was at least half a battle curtailed. The king Moana, who is about twenty-two years of age, is the grandson of the chief installed king by Commodore Porter, who waged war on the neighbouring bays, and reduced them to subjection. He states that an attempt was made on his life by the party in Taioa, and that he left the islands in a mer chant vessel, and visited, England where some trouble was taken to civilize him. Mr. Thompson, the mis sionary above alluded to, fell in with him at the Navi gator's group, where he was a slave, and brought him to Tahiti, and thence hither, having clothed and taken care of him. In stature he is about five feet eight inches, not well built, sadly wanting in personal courage, is not a good-looking person, and without any one feature to command respect or attachment ; and, further, his best friends assert that he is not deficient in ingratitude, and every other bad feeling. Revenge, sulky, moody revenge, alone actuates him in the present war. I am inclined to believe that such utter depra vity as he manifests cannot be inherent. He is"], [419, "1840.] 357 STARLING VISITS TAIOA BAY. too stupid to be so excited as he appeared to be ; and I would rather suspect him to be the tool of the chiefs interested in the plunder and murder of their neighbours. Finding that my arguments failed in putting an end to the war, I inquired, supposing they suc ceeded in conquering Taioa ; \" What do you intend to do with the people ?\" He replied, \" To take half of their people and property, and put as many of my people into that bay, transferring the others hither.\" I then warned him, that as France and Great Britain had landed missionaries to dwell amongst them under guarantee of their safety, (Moana hav ing adopted Mr. Thompson as a chief equal to him self) that both countries would narrowly look into their proceedings, and most scrupulously as regarded their subjects ; and that the day had passed when savage brutality had been permitted its scope. If they ever expected to be treated as beings within the pale of rational creatures, that they must con form themselves to the laws of nations. At the same time, I took care to point out the recent cases of interference, both at Sandwich Islands and Tahiti, of which Moana was perfectly aware. As the weather had not favoured my observations, I despatched the Starling, with Mr. Thompson and the pilot, to Taioa Bay, to try what power they might have in terminating difficulties, or ending this foolish war. On their return, Lieut. Kellett"], [420, "[1840. 358 TERMS PROPOSED. reported that they were averse to war ; but, if at tacked, would strenuously defend their possessions ; \" they certainly would not go out of their valley to fight. If the king would consent to peace, they would give him the customary feast, and receive him cordially ; but would not yield the sovereignty of the bay : the question of a chief {king they ac knowledged none) ruling more than his own valley, being foreign to their original dispositions.\" His absence has, indeed, rendered him in their eyes de funct. This communication did not alter the plans of the chiefs. I desisted from further conference ; the king, however, frequenting my tent with less re serve, unattended, and sending trifling presents. In order to obtain hogs for the crew, curiosities, &c, as well as to ascertain the nature of the bay, and the disposition of its nature, I made a party to visit Tacapa, one of the bays within Comptroller's Bay. Taking with me Lieut. Kellett, the surgeon, and pilot, we proceeded in one of the cutters, and reached the bay about half-past ten. Comptroller's Bay is an extensive arm, running in above five miles from St. Martin's Point, and contains three distinct bays, that to the eastward, inhabited by the distinct race of Typees, being com pletely divided by a peninsular tongue. They are at war with those of Tacapa and Acapa, the next western bay, and are described by our pilot as a more warlike people. On one occasion they cap-"], [421, "1840.] 359 VISIT TACAPA. tured the master and mate of a vessel, which an chored there by mistake, and did not surrender them without heavy ransom. They have at times ventured in their war canoes to punish their ene mies to the westward. In the present war they are opposed to Moana. Our visit to Tacapa merely assured us of the in tention of this and the Acapas to espouse Moana's marauding expedition. But few articles were ob tained from them ; muskets and powder being the general demand for hogs, or war-clubs. We re turned about sunset. The most remarkable fea ture in the people of this bay, was the prevalence of disease. Hardly an individual was free from some disgusting disease or deformity. As we failed in our endeavours to obtain hogs, the pilot pressed the purchase of a bull, cow, and heifer, which would otherwise be sacrificed at the war feast, and therefore prove a total loss to him. I consented, but would willingly have paid their value to have ensured their lives after my departure. As I found this could not be guaranteed, they were embarked for the use of her Majesty's subjects, in stead of these half (if not entire) cannibals. Daily threats having been made by the king and chiefs to destroy Lovell, (the pilot,) the moment we departed, asserting that by his instrumentality I had refused them assistance, and these threats as suming a more determined aspect, from a quarrel with another Englishman, (his partner,) whom Lovell,"], [422, "[1840. 360 SUMMON KING AND CHIEFS. in self-defence, had cut in the head with a sword, but who had joined the king's party in order to be revenged ; \u2014 and further, the queen-dowager's party (adverse to the war) having threatened to destroy Mr. Thompson, the missionary and adopted friend of Moana, if Lovell, her adopted, was touched ; \u2014 I sent for the king, queen, chiefs, and British subjects in question, (at the same time issuing in structions for the ship to cover the landing party, and the Starling to warp within pistol-shot,) and having explained to them the reports I had heard, demanded from the king and his prime minister a distinct engagement that he would hold himself and chiefs responsible for any acts com mitted against the persons or property of British subjects resident. I further assured him, that I should transmit copies of this document to the admiral, and the first ship of war calling at these islands, and that the terms of this contract would be most rigorously enforced. This was duly signed by himself and prime minister. The scene was not without effect. Seated on the ground on my left, was the sister of the king, a very fine powerful young woman, of about twenty ; this being the first occasion of my learn ing that he had any near relative. On the right sat the queen-dowager, the remains of a very superior woman, and the ally of Commodore Porter. Both were in tears ; and although both were diametrically"], [423, "1840.] 361 TREATY SIGNED BY KING. opposed in politics, their heads were inclined on either knee, looking up most imploringly for pro tection ; the one for her brother, the other for her adopted (Lovell.) The signature of the document dispelled all fears, and the sun again beamed through their dark tresses. But their astonishment and alarm were now directed to other objects. They found themselves entirely circumscribed by an armed force, the sea only, with the Starling within half pistol-shot, and ship's broadside, open to them. This was as in stantly dispelled by signal, and all again was peace and harmony. Had hostilities been wantonly commenced, I should have invited the parties in my power to re main on board the Sulphur, until I placed them upon some other island. From the disposition of these people, from per sonal observation, I certainly am much inclined to term them well disposed and easily managed. At the same time I do not think them likely to be driven to consent to any act commenced under hos tility. I had a distinct reason for acting in this case with some parade of force. It had been communicated to me that a visit from a foreign vessel of war, on a commission to punish, had been null, and that the natives derided the idea of a ship injuring them. The facility with which the movement was"], [424, "[1840. 362 BEHAVIOUR OF NATIVES. effected, and without the slightest trace of ill-feeling, reassured the British residents, and removed from my mind any cause for apprehension after my de parture. The foreign residents assert, and visits to Taioa and Tacapa prove, that the natives of this bay, since the arrival of Moana, are the most troublesome ; and but for his re-introduction, peace would have reigned. Nothing like rudeness or incivility was witnessed by any of us. One or two thefts were asserted to have been committed ; but I am inclined to suspect they were exchanged for \"value received.\" That many thefts did not occur surprises me, for they never could have been achieved with less suspicion or less fear of detection \u2014 so constantly did I observe things at their mercy. The group of islands consists of nine in number, viz., Nuhahiva, or Nuuhiva ; Uapou ; Tahuata, or St. Christina; Mohotani, or San Pedro; Fatuiva, St. Magdalena ; Hiraoo, La Dominica ; Uahuga, or Uahuna. Vaitahu is one of the bays of Tahuata ; Taiohae bay, the people of which Teii ; Hakaui Bay, the people of which Tioa. Population of the group is estimated at 15,000. The language of Nuha hiva consists of fourteen letters. Two Roman Catholic French missionaries reside, to whom the natives go for instruction ; but the ex tent of their conversion is limited to accurately mimicking their teachers : of this we had strong proof at Tacapa. They were in bad health, and"], [425, "1840.] 363 ISLAND OF PREDPRIATIE. visited by our surgeon. I much doubt of any success to either mission for some time, certainly not until their differences are settled. Of the productions of Port Anna Maria little can be said. Hogs, poultry, and fruit, may be procured for muskets ; water is plentiful, and flows into the sea, where hoses can be conveniently led. On the 30th Jan. we quitted Nuhahiva, directing our course towards the island of Predpriatie of Kot zebue, in our route to Bow Island, where I had de termined to commence our boring operations. On the 3rd February, at noon, land was reported in the anticipated direction, and as the deviation of a few degrees in our course would retard us but little, I kept away in order to ascertain how the position of this island (referred to Tahiti) would affect the longitudes of that navigator. Nor will it, I trust, be presuming in me, with the instruments entrusted to me, and recent data at Nuhahiva, in assuming that we could set this matter at rest ; because, on reference to the work of that officer, I find him using a lunar distance, within a few days, to verify a former longitude. To those who are acquainted with the use of chronometers, and such machines as those embarked in the Sulphur, it is merely necessary to hint that seconds of longitude would be our maximum error. Having very smooth water, and a breeze nicely adapted to our operations, a rough outline was made, by which we found but slight difference in latitude ;"], [426, "364 [1840. oMILKINESS OF OCEAN. he having taken the centre of the island, I a cocoa nut tree. On nearing the island, we perceived the natives flocking to the beach, and observed an apparent opening to the lagoon, at the S.E. angle of the island. The height of the land does not in any place exceed that of general coralline formations, the trees in the clumps appearing to be pandanus, with pos sibly some of the ficus tribe, which I have seen on some of the Coral Islands. But I have never noticed the bread-fruit, and I believe, from inquiries made, that it is not known in these regions upon coral for mations. It would be waste of time to say more respecting this island than that it is one of the Palliser Group ; for whether they be added now, or at the time of the discovery of their first existence, is immaterial. They were all well known amongst the natives of these seas, under the title of the Paumotas ; and have long been well known to those resident at Tahiti, who trafficked amongst them years before ships of war were so common in these parts. Here the opening is on the weather side of the island ; and as it seems to be a theoretical assertion that the reverse is the general law, I shall call this No. 2 \u2014 Clipperton being No. 1. Our attention this morning had been excited by an unusual milkiness of the sea, so much so that I suspected we were in soundings. Experiment settled this in the negative, as deep as two hundred"], [427, "1840.] 365 BOW ISLAND. fathoms. It therefore must be attributed to the mollusca, \u2014 which we have remarked (particularly of late) are more abundant in the vicinity of islands, and at some distance from land. This remark may be noticed in our passage across the meridians 130 to 136\u00b0 W., when searching for reported islands in 1837 and 1838. A parallel feature to this, noticed by me during nearly thirty years, is that the massive Medus\u00e6, generally termed \" Blubber,\" are seldom noticed out of the influence of large rivers or \u00e6stuaries, and abound particularly in discoloured water. On the 5th of February, at dawn, we discovered Bow Island, and ran along its S.E. side, to the en trance ; which we reached about three p.m., and found a very strong ebb, with overfalls running out. I therefore determined on landing for evening sights, and examining the probability of entry before night. Accompanied by Lieut. Kellett, I entered the pas sage against a four knot current, but by keeping close to the rocks, and tracking the boat along the reef, reached the eastern point of entrance, where about fifteen or twenty natives had assembled to re ceive us ; half in fear, half in joy. Trusting in some degree to the chance of high water at noon, and knowing that smooth water at all events would be found at daylight, we lay off and on until the morning, when, with a fine wind abeam, we entered the channel. For a long, and tedious period, with rocks not more than a few feet from her"], [428, "366 [i84a BORING OPERATIONS. keel, the ship held her own, but the breeze slacken ing, and tide increasing, she lost her steerage and touched. This was of little consequence, the tide carrying her out, where I left her in deep water, and landed to secure further observations. The ebb did not slack until three p.m., therefore the assertion respecting noon high-water at the Coral Islands falls to the ground. At three we entered, and anchored at a position which I had estimated as affording us every advan tage. But the anchorage proving unsafe, I shifted to the Blossom's anchorage, which appeared to afford more shelter from the prevailing breezes. Selecting sandy spots for placing our anchors, we moored the ship, and commenced our refit ; landing all our spars, plank, &c, adapted for boring opera tions, which I had fortunately collected on our northern trip. The apparatus furnished for this service being similar to that used for boring for water in England, needs but little description ; comprising augers of various sizes; iron tubes of three inches internal bore; and twenty-feet bars connected by strong joints with male and female screws. But, as I foresaw, these were not calculated for the service we were about to undertake. To work these augers, it was necessary to raise a strong scaffold more than twenty feet above our working level ; and during the interval employed upon this duty, a party sunk a well of six feet square"], [429, "1840.] 367 BORING OPERATIONS. and six feet in depth, which was secured from tum bling in by strong piles, plank, and wattling of the cocoa-nut and pandanus leaves. In the centre of this area a forty-gallon cask was sunk, forming a well, into which one of the lift pumps was introduced. By this arrangement we gained a depth of seven feet, and secured the workmen from annoyance by the loose sand and water, before entering the tools. Fresh water flowed abundantly at five feet ; but on the second day, probably from the fermentation of the leaves, it was too offensive to drink. I have been particular in stating our proceedings, in order to show that more than ordinary attention was paid to this duty. The boring commenced on the second day, under the especial superintendence of an officer, attended by his boring party, and a com plete journal was kept of the progress or retardation. The material through which the auger had to pass was a fine coralline sand, which yielded with diffi culty, although very soft. This arose from lateral pressure. A small piece of coral became a great obstruction, and the attempt to crush it lost much time, owing to the yielding nature of the sand. Recourse was had to the pipes at nearly the com mencement of the operations, and all the valved tubes and augers being defective from corrosion, (hav ing been originally stowed in the pump well,) our blacksmith was kept in constant employ, making and altering tools to fit."], [430, "368 [184(1 BORING OPERATIONS. By perseverance, and several contrivances, forty five feet of pipe were entered \u2014 when the lateral pres sure became too great for the joints, and the solder gave way. Had we been provided with three sets of pipes capable of being passed within each other, I am confident we should have proceeded with rapidity. In fact, either an express borer by profession, with his smithy force, should be sent for such work, or the officer who is to conduct it should satisfy himself, before undertaking such service, as to the tools he requires. With naval men the word \" impossible\" only turns up when that expression can be clearly demon strated ; and although I plainly foresaw the difficul ties, I yet fancied that we might master them. Wooden tubes five feet in length by two inches inter nal square, were prepared at the scene of operations, to receive each charge brought up, which was duly inserted, from a graduated plank on which it was previously dried ; and recorded in the journal ; and a glass tube on a reduced scale, of one inch to the foot, was similarly prepared from the dry mixture. Frequently, on the withdrawal of the tool, its re insertion would shew a diminution of two feet, aris ing from the falling in or caving of the loose matter below; and although merely of the consistence of cream, the tubes could only by difficulty and much humouring be moved down. These disadvantages must, to the eye of any operative, be very apparent ; and it must be allowed to those of sanguine tempe-"], [431, "1840.] CESSATION OF THE BORING OPERATIONS. 369 rament to be extremely harassing. But I must say that it did not influence our working party, who con tinued with the same spirit as if the communication with home was to be effected through that aperture. Against these disadvantages wre continued to work until the seventeenth, when, having reached the depth of forty-five feet, the sudden falling in from beneath so effectually locked the tool that no direct moderate force on the levers could move them. Re course was then had to purchases, in order to save as much of the iron material as possible. After some very pow*erful ones had failed, I deter mined to put the iron to the test, and with a force of fifty men on a purchase computed at twenty tons, parted the bar, which measured one inch square. Thus, after thirty-five days' labour, ended our operations, \u2014 at all events fully coinciding with my prediction that nothing harder than sand could be found below twenty feet. My reason is, that in every operation in which I have personally been engaged, and from the general opinion of those who navigate these coral islands it is clearly understood, and on a small scale been proved, that the corallines are \" mushroom featured\" \u2014 that they can be lifted by the anchor, by hand, and that their bed is soft. If there is any credit due to the history of the Bounty, she steered for, and ran down, the mushroom obstruction of Toobooai ; and the Blossom's counter sent one over when warping out at Tahiti. I have other reasons to allege presently. VOL. i. b B"], [432, "370 [1840. PERPETUATE THE LOCALITY. Another attempt to bore through the coral reef on the outer belt of the island failed, owing to the borer getting jammed at the depth of nine feet. I fully expected to have met sand there also, as the deeper they went the softer it proved, and the water flowed. The section of the island was taken from the outer surf line, over the spot where the boring was carried on, through the lagoon, to where the ship was moored. A very close survey was taken of every rock above water, and every knoll near the surface ; that is, each main rock of the boundary belt of the inner ledge or reef. A pier of six feet in width, and eighteen inches above the ordinary tides, was carried out on the section line seventy-five feet. Seventeen cocoa-nut trees were planted at fifteen feet asunder, nearly on the same line, (there are two lines of other cocoa-nuts planted near the tent by some other party preceding us,) and a plate of cop per bearing the following inscription, by punched holes, was nailed to the cocoa-nut tree nearest the pipe.

Ob servations were continued for days on the outer side, which point out that whatever may be the peculiarity to be hereafter determined at Tahiti, Bow Island does not subscribe to high- water at noon. On our first arrival the observatory was landed, and as soon as the moon culminated, after day-light, and the boring was in full train, I started with Lieut. Kellett in the Starling, on a magnetic tour of the principal extremities of this island. These posi tions were also secured in latitude and longitude, and thus determine its boundaries. As Bow Island may be considered free from ob jections which would apply to basaltic or volcanic formations, I took advantage of this visit to ensure a most complete set of magnetic observations, in order to compare with Tahiti, now considered as a standard position. In natural history the collection was materially increased, particularly by several varieties of curi ously formed as well as beautifully coloured fish. The water obtained at Bow Island is not whole some, unless for immediate consumption; and even for this purpose, although none of our crew were imme diately affected, I have considerable doubt. It was B b 2"], [434, "372 [IS 1(1. THE NATIVES. repeatedly tried, particularly on board the Starling, but immediately became offensive when confined or put into tanks. It is worthy of special attention, to other visitors, that the water obtained by digging within four feet of the flow of the sea, and allowed to settle, and then re-baled, was preferred by the natives, and a*> proved by ourselves. Previous to our arrival, we had anticipated much inconvenience from the presence of the natives, and contemplated various schemes to keep them away. Much to our surprise, gratification, and even assist ance, we found them rather an acquisition. I sus pect that Captain Beechey never could have seen the natives of this island. They must have been the natives of Anaa, belonging to the diving com pany of the Dart, then at anchor. None of this party recollected the Blossom, with the exception of one, a cripple, mentioned in my journal of that date, whom I met on detached ser vice, in the barge, at the S. E. cocoa-nuts. He perfectly recollected me, as well as my taking the drawing and dimensions of his extraordinary arm. This race deserves a better character than Captain Beechy gave of the party; although the general habits of the low islanders are much the same. These men are some of the finest, best built, and handsomest I have seen with dark skins. Their tempers will almost bear comparison with those of Loochoo, excepting that they are to be preferred"], [435, "1840.] 373 HABITS AND CHARACTER. for openness and attachment. In affection for each other, and to their children, they are patterns. In honesty I believe them to be above the generality of uncivilized beings. Living as they do by fishery la bour, it is not to be supposed that any great beauties would be encountered. They are generally as good looking as the Sandwich islanders. All women in savage life are old at twenty, and ugly beyond that age; but there is a motherly kindness, something winning even in the oldest and ugliest, as we saw completely verified in their donations. The children are un accountably pretty, and the only drawback is the unfortunate pest to which all thick-haired natives, even of favoured Tahiti, are subject. Even here, Tahi tian fashions prevail : they shave the whole crown of the head, and cut the remaining hair short, to obviate the evil referred to. Some few indeed were exceptions, and on inquiry, I found that their brothers would not permit them to cut their long straight hair, because they used it for fishing lines. We had daily opportunities of witnessing their feelings towards each other. As I dined at my tent, I caused a large iron pot of pea-soup to be made for them daily, which, with the addition of biscuit, was regularly placed before the party encamped at the tents. Until all were served, in leaves provided by themselves, they rarely com menced, and in many cases took their portion to be again subdivided amongst their friends. One word from me, even a cloud on my brow,"], [436, "[1840. 374 AFFECTION FOR EACH OTHER. (not unfrequent,) would scatter them, not to return unless invited : and on one occasion some miscon ception entirely freed us from them. Fortunately, this occurred when our undivided attention was required at the term days, and it is not improbable that our devotion to our work was mistaken for some superstition. Both Kellett and myself had several attached to our staff, and upon our excursion round the islands one was borne as pilot. It was highly interesting to witness his reception at each village. Not a word of welcome was spoken. He seated himself, or was conducted to the place where he sat, and two or three passed their arms or hands on either side round his waist, locking him in a silent embrace, in which their faculties appeared to be entirely ab sorbed. As one fell away another replaced him, and sometimes I lost his services for some time. This caused a certain dejection in him for some hours. With respect to eating, there is no difference in the sexes. The women do not pound the nuts for their husbands ; nor did the men \" lord it over them\" in our presence. On discussing this subject with my friend Kellett, his reply was nearer the fact : \" Nonsense ! they are much too fond of their women.\" On the other hand, the men conduct the canoes, fish, and when inshore, call the women to assist, which is responded to with cheerfulness. They go on expeditions to bring in Pandanus fruit, and"], [437, "1840.] DRESS. 375 then it is the duty of the women, on their return from the beach, to carry up the stores and cook them. We never knew of violence amongst them, either by word or deed, in either sex, excepting on one occasion, and then it was quite a burlesque. They do not appear to have any chief amongst them, but by common consent submit probably to the best and oldest present. Frequently when I attempted to obtain an answer upon this point, they would reply Mikanery, (missionary,) or sometimes you are \" Tapana paumotu.\" On one occasion at the \" S. E. cocoa-nuts\" an old venerable man was introduced as \" Tapana Paumotu,\" but I was shortly after informed that his son was the principal. The objects used for barter were cotton, duck, handkerchiefs, tobacco, old clothes, &c. ; other ob jects were considered merely as gifts. Men, women, and children smoke. The clothing is much the same as at the low islands, only they appear to take more pains, and are more particular in the manufacture of the maro, worn by the males, and palvas of the women, than I have before observed. If constant ablution can keep them clean, these should be so, for they are constantly in the water in search of fish, and failing in the scaly tribe, make up for it by the tridacna gigas, which is very abun dant. The men appear to suffer very severely from the sun when thus employed ; the whole body be-"], [438, "[1840. 376 METHOD OF FISHING. coming suddenly covered with scales, which com pletely damps their animal spirits, and if we had not known the true cause, would have raised unplea sant surmises. We noticed that at particular periods they would labour freely ; but if asked to renew their exertions on return from any special employment, they could not be induced to do so voluntarily. I suspect, there fore, that some superstition is connected with their separate extraordinary exertions. They are very expert fishermen ; and with a light net I constructed, would speedily capture any large mullet which ventured within our bounds. It became literally a water hunt, all sexes joining with great excitement. By giving them any that remained beyond our immediate consumption, they kept constantly on the alert, and supplied our table freely. The general mode adapted by themselves is by traps, formed by walls of stone on the flat inner reef. These communicate with each other. The Canoes literally drive the shoals of fish into these, when a yell of delight brings the shore department to their aid, and they are taken out, after being driven into the inner chamber, by bag nets of their own construction. To an observer the fish really appear to be bewildered, either by noise or the number of people, and never attempt to leap their walls, which are not above six inches above water. Their food consists of fish of various kinds, and"], [439, "1840.] 377 BURIAL. pandanus nuts. The tridacna gigas, before noticed, they eat as we do oysters, but it was remarked, that they previously underwent very particular cleansing and steeping in fresh water. It is strange, that neither here, nor in any island of the Pacific that I have visited, do they use the clear crystallised salt which can be easily procured, but prefer a con centrated solution of salt water \u2014 at times very turbid, and generally anything but pleasant to the senses. I am afraid, although they have persons amongst them denominated \" missionaries,\" that their reli gious feelings partake little of Christianity; but rather that the emissaries from Tahiti, entrusted with the collection of the tribute, assume this distinction to suit their purpose. What this tribute may amount to from Bow Island, (or Ocheow,) I am at a loss to conjecture, as during this season they were not seeking the pearl oyster, and the few pearls of fered for traffic were very insignificant. They con tinue their superstitious observances still, by offering fish, parts of turtle, &c, tied up in small baskets and attached to trees, and devote particular cocoa nut trees to the taboo. Their mode of burial is European, and some trouble is taken in covering the grave with fine coral sand. From what we could collect, they were generally healthy ; few deaths occur, and women at thirty had five or six children. In the course of an examination of the island, we calculated the"], [440, "378 [1840. DISEASES. entire population at from two hundred and fifty to three hundred souls. Only five cases of malforma tion, goitre, or elephantiasis, were noticed. They appear to have few wants, are contented, and pro bably as happy as any as we shall meet. I sincerely trust that we may have as good cause to recom mend those whom we may visit in our progress, for good behaviour, freedom from intrusive habits, &c. Previous to quitting the American continent, I was possessed of the generally received idea that these islands were constructed on the summits of submarine mountains, and probably of volcanic origin. My mind, at that period, was closely en gaged in the absorbing duties of our employment, which called for undivided energy and attention. On quitting the coast, my attention became directed to this particular subject, and the means of investi gating it ; and the anticipated result of course met with some share of interest. But I fully arrived at the conclusion, that corallines could not exist or work beyond a certain depth, and that the result of our boring would terminate in sand, or marine clay, usually designated pipeclay. It is well known that these were my opinions, frequently canvassed, and that I did not subscribe to the idea of \" no bottom after fifty fathoms,\" and fully intended to test this question also. I could not conceive such abrupt elevations. As our experiments proceeded, I felt still more confirmed, and, although the outer soundings had"], [441, "1840.] 379 DEEP SOUNDINGS. been reported \" coral rock,\" I was determined to test the matter more severely, as I know how readily men take the report of the man in the bow sounding, rather than satisfy themselves by arming the lead. The course of experiments, as far as a thousand fathoms, was intrusted to my energetic friend Kellett, who I felt well satisfied would leave no blanks unfilled. The results were after fifty fathoms, the pro bable boundary of the coral, entirely sand ; and coral sand at depths, ranging from fifty to nine hundred and sixty. This shows how very minutely such operations should be conducted. Had we sailed without re course to this proof, the report would most certainly have been erroneous, and on my head it would have rested. Referring to the structure of these islands, and of this in particular, I certainly, as an actor in these investigations, and as a general observer, cannot subscribe to their uniformity of shape, or any other speculative peculiarities. I cannot subscribe either to the idea that the corallines build to suit their convenience under any peculiar system, nor that the openings in all the islands are to leeward. I have named two which have them to windward ; Matilda Reef is No. 3 ; and Bow Island has it rather to windward than to leeward. On the principle that the weather side of these"], [442, "380 [1840. CORAL FORMATIONS. islands would intercept seeds, plants, birds, &c, we must naturally concede that vegetation would first commence there, and be better maintained. That the portions to leeward, or to the S.W., are not gene rally so well studded with trees, ought rather to be attributed to the S.W. rollers, which in light winds roll heaviest, and sometimes over all. But I have remarked that where vegetation has succeeded on isolated portions of the southern side of Bow Is land, and more particularly on the S.E. angle, there it is found to be more luxuriant. The gradation of the exterior as well as interior shallow portions or belts of Bow Island, do not present anything beyond the ordinary course to be anticipated. The corallines naturally commence their operations as near the surface as they can find convenient material ; and it is rather a curious fact that their first building is circular, and seldom exceeds ten or twelve inches in depth, to a diameter of as many feet, (frequently exceed ing it,) and this is not subject to depth. The inner coral belt does not mark an increase of depth ; it is not the wall at which the sudden depression takes place, as generally assumed. This belt confines the coral sand, which is much whiter, within its bounds, and thus causes a delusion ; but upon close examination we found the shelving gradual to the ship. This does not arise from a formation, but I should rather say from the"], [443, "1840.] 381 FAILURE OF GARDEN. preference of the corallines for the depths from nine to twelve feet. In all the openings or boat channels the shelving was but slight. Although the interior parts of the lagoon, which vary from twenty to thirty fathoms, may generally be assumed as sandy bottom, still there are frequent coral patches, which, although generally yielding, occasionally retarded our operations. It is my firm conviction, and the same opinion was entertained by others, that Bow Island de creases at most of its uncultivated portions. I say uncultivated, because great care is taken by the na tives to preserve and keep up a succession of cocoa nut trees ; and even those well grown are not hardy. From my own experiments in raising plants, I am satisfied that the soil of coral islands is not favourable to vegetation generally ; and the hosts of rats which infest them form an insuperable bar to rearing any of the smaller plants or fruits. A garden was established, but failed, although we had two dogs on the watch. However, we left the pea of Socorro, sweet potatoes, peach stones, and walnuts in the ground. The rats suffered the pota toes, Indian corn, and English peas to spring up and attain several inches in height, which induced us to hope they were safe, but one night they cut them off close to the ground. Previous to our arrival at Bow Island, I had men tioned to Kellett and others one little islet with a sandy beach, where I had deposited corallines (in"], [444, "[1840. 382 ISLAND DECREASING. 1826) to bleach, before I ran to the southern cocoa nuts, and had selected it as a test as to any increase or decrease in fourteen years. This islet does not exist nouu No coral island now exists within the lagoon, although there are rocks scattered on the reef patches, on which a bird might perch. The water near the observatory, precisely where the Blossom was, is deeper, our pinnace, deeply laden, easily reaching the beach. The openings be tween the patches of vegetation on the north side are complete, and a light boat might float to sea at high water without difficulty. These channels are dammed for fishing purposes, and have generally a fall in wards of one foot until low water. On the southern side similar openings were no ticed, but throughout the whole external belt there were no signs of living active corallines. At the southern station the rollers had thrown up immense stratified slabs of compact coral limestone, in which shells and spines of echini were profusely embedded. This could not be a coralline formation, but rather pipeclay beds hardening under water. They were very sonorous. Specimens were preserved. The tides on the outer reef afford a proof that the time of high-water conforms to general laws, and that the time of high-water, full and change, may he assumed as two hours forty minutes ; rise two feet nine inches. The weather during the last fourteen days of our stay was very unsettled, I suspect by reason of the"], [445, "1840.] 383 FRESH WATER. termination of the S.W. monsoon. Very heavy rains and smart squalls incommoded us, but did not retard our labours : and although our working par ties were much exposed, (particularly those construct ing the pier, who almost lived in the water,) and drank perhaps too freely, notwithstanding my cau tion, of the beach water, we were unable to trace any evil effects from it. The extreme caution with which I have generally watched the exposure of my crew was possibly a little relaxed here ; but I am satisfied that had I adopted more decisive measures to prevent the use of the island water, and had restricted them to an allowance which we could ill spare, illness (probably scurvy) would have ensued. Whenever cocoa-nuts could be obtained they were given to them as well as lime-juice. But it was remarked that in no case where recourse was had to the surgeon, was it attri buted to this visit ; and none of the cases were from the working party ; they were principally from those confined to the ship. In the Starling, several cases of severe rheumatic fever occurred, but they were not employed on the boring duty, but chiefly on the survey. At the termination of the quarterly observations, our observatory and tents were embarked, and the ship moved near the entrance, in order to take ad vantage of the first opportunity to get off. We were compelled to wait from the 23rd until the 28th of March, before the wind allowed us to fetch out."], [446, "[1840. 384 LAGOON OPENINGS. This, I think, proves the entrance not on the lee side. At the period of the Blossom's visit, the wind and current, on her entrance as well as exit, favoured her ; but no sound conclusion or direction for navigators could be deduced therefrom. A fair wind out would be a foul weather wind inside. In both cases, on reference to Blossom and Sulphur, the winds at entrance and exit ranged from east to E. N. E., or leading winds. We found that the time of entry or exit depended also on the time of high or slack water, and that it was necessary to watch this at the entrance, as the velocity of ebb, when much water had been forced into the lagoon, prevented the ship from steering. With our chart before us, we knew to a nicety what wind would suffice, and how far we could venture. But it is at all times a difficult place to enter with a vessel drawing over fifteen feet. It cannot be entered against the ebb without a breeze which would command six knots at least, as the current, which has about one foot fall, runs above four knots. Approaching from seaward, the state of the current can generally be pretty fairly estimated by the \" tail race,\" which sweeps to sea about three quarters of a mile. The instant this slackens or ceases, the entrance may be approached. The starboard side close to the breaker line is the boldest, but a rock near the inner point, having only nine feet on it, must be"], [447, "1840.] QUIT BOW ISLAND. 385 avoided. The two cocoa-nut trees over the western point clear of the bushes notes it, as well as one on the opposite side. These two rocks form the gateway of the channel ; and as all the rocks are plainly visible, they are easily avoided. We now took our leave of Bow Island, shaping a course for Chain Island or Anaa, intending, if landing was practicable, to fix its position. On the morning of the 29th we saw the two groups ; about eight, Melville Island ; in the even ing Bird Island ; on the morning of the 30th Croker Island; and at dawn on the 1st of April Chain Island. About seven we had approached almost within hail, when we were visited by a canoe, from which we took a native pilot, and passing close enough for the native to hail his friends and desire them to bring off pigs, &c, for barter. We rounded to and obtained soundings, one hundred and seventy fathoms sand, at half a mile from the shore. We afterwards tried about one mile off with nine hundred and forty six, without gaining bottom. An old native, who assumed some degree of autho rity, paid us a visit, and intimated that no pigs would come off unless the boat was sent in for them, as well as to exhibit what we had to traffic with. The cutter was accordingly despatched, but not succeed ing, and finding the canoes had left me more visitors than I wished, I determined to take them in-shore and try if I could succeed. On reaching the safe water, men, women, and children swam oft' in great vol. i. c c"], [448, "386 [1840. TRAFFIC AT CHAIN ISLAND. numbers, and the only difficulty I experienced was in preventing them from thrusting their pigs into the boat. Indeed, I began to fear I had not where with to answer their demands. However, putting a roll of duck into the hands of the chief, who delibe rately measured it, fourteen large hogs were awarded for twenty-eight yards ; which was at the rate of one shilling and eightpence per hog. It was not without difficulty that we cleared the mob, whose heads im peded our oars. Some few shells were obtained, but none of value, nor was even a middling pearl offered. At four we bore away for Tahiti. The natives of Chain Island are remarkably well formed and well featured, although of a darker cast than those of Marquesas, or Tahiti. The women are more masculine, probably from frequent exercise and exposure in the water, and probably less changed by civilization or the introduction of European clothing. Their hair is very beautiful, reaching in strong wavy tresses to the middle, strongly reminding one of mermaids. Two very fine young women clung to our boat for a considerable time. It was useless to desire the crew to make them let go ; they were fascinated, and I was really ashamed to treat them rudely. They begged hard, as I understood, to take leave of their . brothers or relatives, to whom I had given a passage, and were accordingly towed off; but on reaching the ship, then more than a mile from the shore, they struck off for a canoe near us. Those"], [449, "387 1840.] REACH TAHITI. in the canoe refused them admittance, and as we sailed away they were seen gambolling like Nereids. Hitherto we had experienced light winds, probably owing to the vicinity of the islands ; but shortly after quitting Chain Island the breeze freshened, and at half past six on the morning of the 4th we dropped anchor in Matavai Bay. I had forgotten that the Tahitans were one day in advance of us, the mis sionaries having brought their time from the west ward ; we were therefore obliged to change our Saturday for Sunday.

Having so lately quitted the American continent, and particularly Nuhuhiva, the scenery of Tahiti did not so much interest us, as the assistance we looked for in refitting, added to the rest and amusement after our late fatigues. I landed on Point Venus, perhaps with feelings totally incomprehensible to any on board. Fourteen years before, on the very spot where Cook was en camped, I had bivouacked for several days. I was then a lieutenant, now a captain ; and I looked for ward to my labours, which were there to be resumed, with an anxiety only to be experienced by those charged with similar duties. The question as to the increase of the Dolphin shoal since 1826 was my hobby. Next came the determination by actual experiment of the tidal question; Kotzebue and b 2"], [464, "4 [1840. ANCHOR AT PAPEETE. Beechey having asserted a noon high water. Magnetic data were looked to with anxiety ; and I was now to enter the field where so many talented men had preceded me. Furnished with well-tested instru ments, perseverance alone was required. In addition to these considerations, I expected to meet with those who had befriended me in 1826, and I hoped pos sibly to be of service to their country. Having obtained the necessary data for securing the meridian distance, we moved, on the morning of the 5th, through Toanoa channel to Papeete. This channel in the Blossom's day was deemed impassable, but is now the common entrance, the French frigate, l'Artemise, having entered by it. On entering the reefs, the boats of thirteen Ame rican whale ships came to our assistance, and, aided by a light air, we were taken through in good style by our pilot \" Jim,\" of notoriety in Beechey's work. As a native pilot, he deserves great credit, and acquits himself with far more coolness and decision than many Europeans. At twenty minutes past eight we dropped anchor in Papeete Bay, followed shortly by the Starling. Before entering the narrows, the chiefs, Paofai, Itoti, and the husband of the queen's mother, paid me a visit. I was much surprised at their loss of caste. In former times they were the essence of propriety ; now they were reduced to compete with the other natives for the washing of linen, even in their fancy uniforms."], [465, "1840.] VISIT THE QUEEN. 5 The consul, Mr. Pritchard, immediately paid me a visit, and we proceeded together, about noon, to visit queen Pomare, then residing at her country establishment, at Papawa. She has been married within the last six years to a young chief at Hua heine, by whom she has two sons who are living, the eldest about three years old. I expected, as an old acquaintance, to have met with a cordial reception, but I subsequently learned that she had been so much harassed by threats of ven geance from various nations, that she hardly knew whether I had not come to make some new demand for satisfaction. However, this soon wore away upon the explanation of Mr. Pritchard, and she readily assented to my making use of the small island, Motu-utu, to land our stores, &c. during the operations of caulking and replacing some copper. Her apprehensions removed, she immediately moved down to her new house at Papeete. Her husband, of whom, however, she is very fond, is a great scamp, and is causing much trouble in the island. Owing to the caulking and other disagreeables on board, I took up my abode at the house of the queen's aunt, where I erected my observatory, and superintended the building of a new boat. Unfortu nately, there were several whalers in port, refitting, and it was not until the sixth day after our arrival that we could obtain any aid from artificers, our own being nearly useless or sick. Those who eventually came, performed about half as much as we were accustomed to in civilized countries."], [466, "6 [1840. LEGAL DISCUSSIONS. Representation having been made to me that there were several cases where British subjects had opposed the verdict of Tahitan juries, and the queen and chiefs having solicited my advice thereon, a public meeting of the chiefs was convened. Upon the questions which were brought for ward for my consideration, I had only direct an swers to give, confirming the sentences in accord ance with their laws, and expressing my surprise that they should have hesitated in carrying them vigorously into execution, when they had the as surance of the British consul that his government would not countenance any opposition to them. Some discussion, however, threatened to arise, in con sequence of their putting \" home questions,\" which bore severely on the conduct of foreigners present. But these I avoided, by answering as for British subjects only, or the British consul, \u2014 promising any private advice they might wish at a future occasion. Upon one decision against a British subject, viz., that of a young man who had forcibly retained the wife of a native, I was applied to by the de fendant for redress, inasmuch as he had acted under the authority of the queen's husband, who had given the woman a paper desiring her to go and live with this young man, and say \" that he told her to do so.\" As this was a manifest usurpation of authority, and the parties had thus been led into error and fined for it, I enclosed the documents to the queen and chiefs, requiring them to look into the matter, and"], [467, "1840.] 7 KING-CONSORT IMPEACHED. adding that as they had talked so much about their laws being disregarded by foreigners, it was incumbent on them to see that they were not brought into contempt, by being tampered with by one of their own body. The affair was taken up with spirit. The queen (although not without a struggle) gave up her hus band to the law, and issued a summons to the seven supreme judges. When they had assembled, the young king-consort refused to appear, and after much noise and excitement, the conference was put off until it could be more solemnly conducted, by summoning all the chiefs of Eimeo, as well as those of Tahiti. Upon their assembling, the king again refused to appear, backed by the lowest order of foreigners living on the beach, who were interested in setting the laws at defiance. At length the queen, to prove her sincerity, and that she would not screen him, requested that the judges would adjourn to the palace, and try him there. This was accordingly done. On my passage thither, I had an opportunity of witnessing* some of the man\u0153uvres which were at tempted in order to foil the trial. Indeed, some of the braggadocios talked largely of going in a body to protest against the proceedings. They were the beach rabble before alluded to. They had not the courage to appear, and the judges proceeded to select a jury. They were about to proceed to trial ; the king having submitted, and appeared. As I per-"], [468, "8 [1840. RECONCILIATION. ceived this would afford a good opportunity for the judges to give him a lecture, which opportunity might be lost after the trial, I expressed myself (as far as I was concerned) \" satisfied that he had at length seen his error, and submitted to the laws of his country, and that I merely wished the judges to point out to him, in the presence of the queen, chiefs, and people, his total inability to interfere with the government : that he was merely the queen's husband, and by the laws of the island was not even entitled to the authority of a chief. This had an almost electric effect. Taatee and Utamme, the two oldest chiefs, immediately stepped forth, and in the most energetic language, told him his faults, and finally exhorted him to stay more at home, and look to the interests of the queen and their children. The several chiefs who had secretly opposed me, and supported the ultras, now stepped forth, and were lavish of \" soft sawder.\" In fact, the tables were entirely turned. To conclude the matter, I immediately offered the king and queen my hand, and invited them, together with Taatee and Utamme, to dinner on board, where they enjoyed themselves rationally and happily, and were entertained by fireworks from the island. Much to the chagrin of the disaffected, they were for this night entirely cut off from their society and machinations. Having put upon paper answers to several ques-"], [469, "1840.] HULA-HULA. 9 tions, relating to the proper course to be pursued against turbulent foreigners, and pointed out how far they would be listened to by foreign powers when complaining of their subjects, I left them in peace and harmony, aud moved the ship to Point Venus, in order to complete our magnetic observa tions. Shortly after our arrival the king joined us, and seemed determined to separate himself from his former acquaintance. In the evening, a hula-hula, or native dance, was performed before us, by fifty young men and boys, dressed a la militaire, in blue, with white trimmings. The day following the queen arrived, and a similar exhibition of ladies and gentle men took place, the former all in white, with very neat straw bonnets. Both parties went through the performance of the hula-hula with great spirit ; but the dresses were rather inconvenient to both sexes. One young lady, with shoes and white stockings, finding them incon venient, first threw away the shoes, and shortly after the stockings followed. The hula-hula of the present day is entirely free from objection. It is merely a display of extraor dinary activity, the acme of which is an instantaneous and simultaneous stop when at the highest pitch of ex ertion. It is what might be termed a romping dance. After all this gaiety, I was much surprised, on the day following, by a visit from the consul, who, to my astonishment, informed me that he was the bearer of"], [470, "CRUELTY OF QUEEN'S HUSBAND. [1840. 10 a message from the queen, intreating my stay until the May meeting, (on the Wednesday following,) as the king, in a fit of intoxication, had treated the queen in a most brutal manner, in the high road ; having attempted to kill her with a stone. Being foiled by her female retinue, and two young men who were passing, he had seized her by her hair, and had it not been for those about, doubtless would have destroyed her. The queen fled to the house of a cooper, where she was concealed. It appears that he had fallen from his horse in a fit of intoxication, and she had rushed to his assistance with all the warmth of affection, which was thus repaid. On his return to the house, he destroyed all her presents of dresses, bonnets, ornaments, &c, and attempted to fire the house. It was the professed intention of the queen \" to move for a divorce, and that he be re turned to Huaheine.\" The consul immediately took the queen under his protection, and having requested my interference, I assured her that four days' delay was important to me, but if she would assure me of her determination to rid herself of such a dangerous and detestable character, and immediately summon the judges, I would not only wait, but also convey him to his island (Huaheine.) To my utter astonishment, the consul informed me the day following, that she had forgiven him, and returned, thanking me in the warmest terms for my attention."], [471, "1840.] FORGIVING DISPOSITION OF POMARE. 11 Poor woman ! I am afraid this is but a beginning of such scenes. Two most unprincipled chiefs, Hetoti and Poafai, are well known, to bear her mor tal hatred, and if they can excite the husband to do their will, she will probably fall, and he will then inevitably become their victim. Pomare is now growing old for a Tahitan, being above twenty-eight, and very corpulent. She ap pears to be very fond of her children, and to feel much for her unprincipled husband, although for months they scarcely speak. Her forgiveness on this late occasion speaks volumes for her kindness of heart. She is at times, however, violent and passionate, as I have noticed in her arguments with the consul. She does not possess one single trace of the pretty little girl I recollect as Aimatta in 1 826. I had frequent opportunities of seeing her in the midst of her retinue at Papeete, as she occasionally stopped to take tea at my quarters. One division were admitted to table; the second division sitting in the verandah. On these occasions her manners were very pleasing, and care appeared to be banished. I endeavoured to entice the husband to join us, but without success. With respect to the present condition of the Tahitans, it is my decided opinion, that with the introduction of dress, the peculiar religious feeling which I noticed in 1826 has vanished. They were then simple in the extreme ; they are now compara tively civilized. The introduction of foreigners has"], [472, "12 [ls-40. QUIT MATAVAI. broken down the legal barrier which restrained them. I much regretted that I could not be present at their May meeting. It is similar to our parliament, and our presence might have assisted in the intro duction of laws for the comfort of the well-disposed. I had no object in view; but the chiefs of all parties, as well as the missionaries, wished my presence. On the evening of the 8th, we quitted Matavai Bay, and shaped our course for Huaheine, in the hope of finding an anchor said to have been left there. The course of tidal experiments at Papeete, as well as Point Venus, negative the noon high-water. Dolphin shoal has not increased since 1826, nor had it at that date altered from the account given by Wallis or Cook. On the other hand, two coral patches, discovered by me in the Blossom's visit, have decreased, and are now hardly to be found. The new channel into Papeete exhibits a clearing away of coralline obstructions, and the formation of a deep channel. The Blossom could barely enter Toanoa ; now, a line of battle ship can enter easily. The spot where the consul's house then stood is no more: vessels may ride there. Surely here is no evidence of the astonishing activity of lithophytes. Hardly had we cleared Point Venus, when, for the first time during our visit, it rained heavily, and did not clear up until after midnight, when we cleared the island of Eimeo. Shortly before sunset on the day following we rounded the point of Huaheine, and would probably have anchored had the wind favoured"], [473, "1840.] VISIT HUAHEINE. 13 our entry. However, as we were taken aback at the entrance, I decided on going in my boat to view the anchor, and ascertain if it was worth delay. Having given a passage to Mr. Barfs, jun., (the missionary at Papeete,) to visit his father, the resident missionary at Huaheine, I took him with me, to show where the anchor lay. One glance was suffi cient ; it was entirely useless. I therefore proceeded on with him to his father's, where an hour or two flew away rapidly, in the presence of the fairest dis play of beauty we had seen in these seas. Having par taken of tea, and the hospitalities and attentions of this worthy family, and discussed the budget of Ta hitan intelligence, I took leave of this interesting group, (nine children, ranging from ten to twenty,) and by moonlight soon regained my ship, and bore away for Raratonga. The natural beauties of the island we saw little of, although, from the luxuriance of the trees noticed near the beach, and the peculiar formation of the island, I have little doubt that it would have repaid our delay. By the description of Mr. Barfs, it con tains an interior pool, with two passages, one of which is navigable \u2014 apparently an old crater. It is, in fact, a double island. It is considered one of the most interesting islands in the Society Group. The mountain scenery is more picturesque, the soil on the lowland more fertile, the population better disposed and better featured, and more easily ruled. The island itself affords more scope for investiga-"], [474, "14 [1H40. ISLAND OF MA UK I. tion, by sea as well as by land, and it is very probable that in the course of time its excellent harbour may rise into importance. This island was a great favourite with Cook. Had it been six hundred miles west of Tahiti it certainly would have attracted my attention ; but time was of too much importance to wait here, every hour in chronometric measurements being of importance. Just after noon on the 13th, (having the night previous experienced a most extraordinary head sea\u00bb with the wind hauling to the S.E.) we observed the island of Mauki, through the rain clouds which hung upon the horizon, exactly on the bearing which, by our common reckoning, we had anticipated. In Arrowsmith's chart, the island is termed Parry's Island, as laid down by Lord Byron, 1825, as well as Miuta. The whole of the Harvey Group were however, well known before 1825, as will be seen by the work of the late Mr. Williams, who claims also the discovery of Raratonga, but which is designated on the chart as Orurute, \"discovered by Captain Henry.\" However, it is well known by the native account, that they had long before been visited fre quently by whalers, and Captain Henry did not touch at it until after Mr. Williams resided there. The island of Mauki is about two miles in diame ter, well wooded, and inhabited, but the soil does not appear in any part to exceed forty feet above the sea evel. It is situated in latitude 20\u00b0 7' S., and lon gitude 157\u00b0 11' W."], [475, "1840.] 15 RARATONGA. About four p. m., we lost sight of Mauki, and, favoured by a strong breeze from S.E., made the island of Raratonga at eight on the following morn ing. Heavy rain clouds frequently obscured the island, so that its lofty and picturesque peaks were shut out from us until we had neared within three miles. Three American whalers were cruising off, waiting for supplies ; but nothing was at anchor, to guide us to the landing. Following up one of the whale-boats, we tacked close in to the reefs, and went on shore in my gig about ten : the showers fortunately admitting of our saving the forenoon sights between them, as well as the latitude at noon. Having letters to Mr. Buzacott, the principal missionary, he soon made his appearance, and con ducted us to his house, which for neatness and com fort surpasses anything we have met amongst the missionaries. The roads, enclosures, church, school, and private residences, are an age in advance of Tahiti. Neatness and regularity prevail, and the appearance of the resident chief, as well as of those about him, reflects the highest credit on the present missionary, as well as the unfortunate originator of the present system, the late Mr. Williams, who was recently murdered at Mallicolo. It reminds me of what I expected of Tahiti if their laws had been enforced. The residence of Mr. Buzacott is situated about one eighth of a mile from the sea, and about half that distance from the main road; which is perfectly level, and of the ordinary width of those in England,"], [476, "[1840. 16 RESULTS OF GOOD GOVERNMENT. the walls of the enclosures in the town (constructed of coral and mortar) confining it. The road to his house leads through the churchyard, when an arti ficial raised road on coral blocks, carries you through a cocoa-nut vista by a gentle rise to the house, which is reached by a flight of steps composed of block coral, about twenty feet ascent, the house occupying a level terrace cut away from a rather steep hill. With all the difficulties incident to missionary progress, one is not a little surprised to meet, not only with the conveniences, but also the comforts, of a well-furnished house. These are principally na tive, but the result of missionary instructions ; care having been taken to teach them useful arts. They manufacture tables, chairs, and sofas, with cane bottoms, fit for any of the middling classes in Eng land. These form an article of export to Tahiti, and a pair of their arm-chairs grace my cabin. The wood of the Tamanu, from which they are manufactured, may vie with Honduras mahogany in beauty, and is far superior in durability. Four very neat stone cottages were just completed, having two good rooms each ; these are intended for the students in the college about to be built where Mr. Buzacott's house now stands. In the present school-room, where they have also a printing press, I was shown the production of one of the native scholars, being a manuscript copy of the New Tes tament, in progress, the writing clear and intelligible,"], [477, "1840.] 17 THE CHIEF MAKEA. the scholar a native missionary, probably to be for warded to some island where Christianity is unknown. The church is an extensive wood and plaster building, capable of accommodating about one thou sand persons ; it occupies one side of the road, and the native school the opposite. The house of the principal chief, Makea, (or per haps more properly the king,) is well built, of two stories, and fit for any European. It was built by the father of the present chief, whose likeness is given in Mr. Williams's work. He has also a very neat little cottage within the same inclosure, where he probably lived during the lifetime of his father. Between the two stands very conspicuously the tomb of old Makea, very neatly kept and white washed. A covered building, or extensive shed, near the landing-place, is used as a market-place. There I found the chief tidily dressed in European costume, \u2014 cotton shirt, white trousers, and white frock coat, \u2014 superintending the purchases for the captains of the whalers. All this results from a change from abso lute barbarism and heathenism since 1825. About sunset all were in motion towards the church, the women mostly in native tapas, with straw bonnets ; but there was no unseemly noises or behaviour, as at Tahiti. The chief himself, although engaged in conversation with me at the time, fol lowed the stream. It is pleasing to witness the influence Mr. Buza- VOL.

Such men by their labours improve all around them. They prove their superiority by their ability to instruct others, and they leave behind them lasting monu ments of their utility, in the increased civilization and happiness of the people. From constant association in their labours they acquire a desire to progress, and I have little doubt that this island will hereafter produce valuable re sults on many others. They have now three mis sionary stations, but I fear they have not three Buzacotts. This excellent person's history is told by Mr. Williams, in his account of this island. It is to be hoped that this island may be spared the introduction of foreign settlers as at Tahiti and Oahu ; for when that commences, adieu to peace and prosperity ! I used my best efforts to alarm the chief, as well as Mr. Buzacott, in order to induce them to watch this point jealously; and I trust with effect. A very judicious code of port regula tions is printed, and a copy furnished to every vessel on arrival ; non-compliance excludes commu nication. Deserters find no refuge. Spirits are prohibited ; and order at night is insured by pre venting any foreigner remaining on shore after dark. The produce of the island is similar to that of Tahiti; but poultry, particularly large turkeys, ve getables, &c., are finer and cheaper, and are readily"], [479, "1840.] 19 RAVAGES OF THE MANTIS. obtained by application to the chief, who controls the market and prevents any undue demands. The mountains, constantly fed by the clouds, afford nu merous streams ; one enters the sea at the landing place, which, although apparently open to the sea, and edged by reefs on either hand, seldom throws in a ripple to hurt a boat, excepting in the bad season or S.W. monsoon, when the breeze blows in. The island is infested by myriads of the mantis, which completely strip the cocoa-nut trees of their leaves, and eventually destroy the tree. The tamanu attains a great size ; one tree I noticed near Mr. Buzacott's house, divided into two stems, but the bulk at the root would give the entire twelve feet diameter. Their state canoes are made from this tree, and are very beautifully carved. At the island c 2"], [480, "[1840. 20 PECULIAR DISEASE. of Mangea, belonging to this group, they are famed for their carving, particularly in fancy axe-handles, resembling in some degree the Roman fasces; several of which, as well as mats and tapas of native workmanship, and other curiosities, were obtained here. By perseverance between the showers, we suc ceeded in obtaining our suite of observations, by which we find that this island is placed on the charts about fifteen miles too far west, and two south, of its actual position. As the ship could not find any safe anchorage, and Vavao had been selected as a rating position, delay was out of the question ; therefore, taking leave of our kind friends, about four p. m. on the 15th, we took our departure with much regret. The natives are generally well-built, but of a coarser habit than our Tahitan friends. It ap pears that in addition to the immense mortality which occurred in the time of Mr. Williams, a new nondescript disease has of late years presented itself amongst them, and is entirely confined to the native population. On its early presentation, the first symptoms, merely swelling of the glands of the throat, were considered certain monitors of speedy death, attended with great torture ; but latterly it has yielded to treatment. It is thus described by Mr. Hinds, our surgeon, who examined a case said to present a complete type of the disorder. \" The accession is accompanied by the usual"], [481, "1840.] 21 ITS CHARACTER. symptoms of fever, \u2014 rigors, followed by heat, dryness of skin, and some headache. This either entirely disappears, or assumes an intermitting form, but in both is followed by an affection of the glands of the neck, groin, or axilla, and sometimes by tumours in the small of the back. An enlargement commences, due to chronic inflammation, which gradually in creases, until the tumour attains a large size, im peding the functions of the neighbouring parts. In the case I witnessed, the glans of the neck were affected on the right side, and an abscess had burst, leaving a large but superficial ulcer, discharging a thin serous matter. On the opposite side large abscesses were in progress, and the back of the neck was also occupied by another in a less forward state. The patient previously had been a strong healthy man, but the disease had deprived him of all energy, and his limbs were much emaciated. Al though the disease did not extend much inwards, he experienced difficulty in speaking, swallowing, or respiring. The progress is slow, but generally fatal. The termination is perhaps assisted by the patient's giving himself up immediately, and neglecting to pursue the remedies prescribed. The missionaries have used the liquor arsenicalis internally, and oint ment of hydriodate of potass externally, with par tial success. They also regard it as contagious, but this is a character which cannot be admitted except after strong proof. Hitherto no white people have been attacked, nor have I heard of its appearance elsewhere.\""], [482, "22 [1840. CAUSES OF DISEASE. The swellings are immense ; at first sight appear ing like huge wens. In a case which I witnessed the left cheek was continued nearly to the shoulder and back of the neck ; and this was in a youth who apparently gave himself little concern about it. This Mould go far to dispel the impression of con tagion, as few would submit to his company, and yet he was always foremost amongst those who pressed round us. I took especial care, however, that he did not come in contact with any of our establishment. I have before adverted to the customary charge of a certain set of missionaries, and more particu larly those of the Sandwich Islands, that the de crease of population is to be ascribed to the inter course with foreigners. In this island at least we have certain proof that in both visitations, (which have nearly depopulated this island,) foreign inter course cannot be the cause ; and I feel well assured that in the majority of cases, diseases which have baffled the scanty knowledge of pharmacy which the reporters possessed, were conveniently ascribed to suit the hypothesis they were bent on main taining. The question naturally arises \u2014 Do you speak from personal knowledge? Possibly not to the extent necessary to settle the point. But I do know, that on our visit in 1826 to Pitcairn's Island, we had the opportunity of learning from those who spoke pure English, \" that they would suffer severely from our"], [483, "1840.] 23 LAGOON REEF. visit;\" that the change from vegetable to animal diet, when visited by strangers, never failed to en tail sickness. (Vide Beechey, vol. i. page 94, 95.) This has been noticed by Captain Beechey, but I followed it out at Tahiti, as well as at the Sandwich Islands, and my own opinion is, that the attempt at premature change of habits, as well as clothing, will account for many varieties of disease. It is evident that many diseases rage in positions where Europeans never set foot, and it is highly probable, that, like the two cases now before us, they originated amongst themselves. I heard at Tahiti of a pig affecting numbers. Was the pig diseased ? And if so, how came it so ? Had a party existed as intent on tracing the true sources of disease, as others are in croaking about what they are utterly ignorant of, probably a very different tale would be told. But if the fact be, as urged by these upholders of American and European contamination, (at the Sandwich Islands,) why do they not exert themselves to erect a hospital, by which means the remedy might be offered ? Have any of them moved such a question? Do they ever visit the sick or attempt the cure of body and soul, or in any way assuage their miseries ? On the 18th, baffling winds and rain caused me to haul to the southward for the night, intending to search for an island and shoal laid down by Arrow smith. Fortunately very strict orders were issued to the officers in charge of watches, and at four a. m.,"], [484, "24 [1840 VAVAO whilst estimating the probable distance on the chart, \" breakers under the lee \" were reported. We were at this time fifteen miles to the eastward of their assigned position. We tacked immediately, sig nalled to warn the Starling, and at daylight sepa rated to examine both sides, and continue a parallel course due west one hundred miles, in order to deter mine if any second danger existed. By our survey, it appears that this reef occupies an outline similar to that of a coral island, having an entrance to the N.W. All the mass of shoal water appeared to be contracted at its S.W. ex tremity, but no rocks above water could be traced. The S.W. extremity was determined to be in lati tude 20\u00b0 2' N., longitude 167\u00b0 49' W. ; which differs from that assigned to the shoal seen by Captain Nicholson. We termed it Lagoon Reef. Our course was then shaped for Vavao, the largest northern island of the Hapae group, but by some navigators they are included in the Tonga group. At daylight on the 21st, we reached within ten miles of its northern point. The appearance of this cluster presented a complete archipelago, with many dangerous reefs off the southern extreme. We fully expected to reach our anchorage before nine, but after rounding the northern extremity, where by the chart we expected to find \" Port Refuge,\" we continued to run down its western side until the openings seen from the eastward again presented"], [485, "1840.] 25 PORT REFUGE. themselves. Through these openings, only, could we expect to find the port. Indeed, I had almost fancied that we had made a wrong landfall, and in order to secure the meridian distance, I immedi ately landed on the nearest accessible station, and succeeded in saving latitude and time; the ship working to windward during the interval. A pilot, left by her Majesty's ship Cruizer, soon visited the ship, and having rejoined her myself, about five miles to windward, we continued to beat through a labyrinth of islands, about six miles to the N.N.E., until sunset, when we dropped our anchor in the inner harbour, \u2014 the first ship or vessel of war that had anchored there. The title of Port Refuge it certainly deserves when this anchorage is obtained. Few square rigged vessels, however, would reach our position. It is very difficult of access, and it is necessary after entering the islands to turn five miles to windward against a lee set, before an anchor can conveniently be let go, and this requires daylight. To a disabled or crippled vessel seeking refuge, this name is de ceitful : she never could reach it. I merely allude at present to the outer anchorage, for nothing but small fore and aft vessels will at tempt the inner harbour. The resident missionary, Mr. Thomas, accompa nied by the master of the American whale-ship Triton, immediately called, and afforded us all the information which might interest. From Mr."], [486, "26 [1840. TREATMENT OF THE NATIVES. Thomas we learned \" that owing to internal wars in the Tonga group, arising from the rebellion of the heathen population, in opposition to Chris tianity, the king (George) and chiefs had gone to assist the latter.\" The produce of this beautiful island has been nearly destroyed by the violent hurricanes, which of late years have been frequent. Upon the subject of this \" religious war,\" in Tonga \u2014 (or better perhaps known as Tonga-taboo) and in which Mr. Thomas appears to take a strong interest, I am much inclined to believe that its origin proceeds from a harshness in making Chris tians, instead of inducing them to become so by persuasion. The punishments for offences against a forced religion, by a people not long converted, are dealt too unmercifully \u2014 are indeed so severe, that we were informed some of the women died under them, and that they were only induced, by the interference of one of our ships of war, to adopt milder measures. It was openly asserted that three and a half inch rope has been used to inflict punishment on women ! These remarks lead me back to an observation in the Hawaiian spectator ; \" Remarks on the discourse by the late Rev. W. Orme, foreign lecturer of the London Missionary Society ;\" asserting that he drew a portrait of the South Sea Mission, for which there is no original in the Pacific. The Sandwich Island missionaries never will see"], [487, "1840.] 27 ALTERED TIMES. such where they are residing; and the English mission at Tahiti had well nigh met entire dis comfiture, by bordering on their absurdities. Savages are not to be broken in like wild horses. They are not to be compelled to feel that the reli gion imposed on them by the fiat of the king, is to be akin to abject slavery. Where are they to look for that peace and contentment so often preached? Is it reasonable to expect, that the millions inhabiting the islands in these seas can, from a state of the most unlimited enjoyment, be brought by law to believe that the Christian reli gion is to ameliorate their condition, when the very habits and countenances of their would-be pastors are almost distorted by severity f But I remember, in our visit to Tahiti in 1826, that the natives, by choice, by free good will, made the sabbath such as I have never witnessed in the civilized Sandwich Islands. I have seen them with cheerful faces flock to church in their best. I could not purchase provision on that day. I witnessed less crime amongst them than in other countries ; and on my doubting the word of a chief, he very de liberately asked me whether \" I did not believe that a God above saw him, and if it could be to his interest to tell a falsehood ?\" The attachment also of the natives to their pastors was strikingly evinced on many occasions, and I confidently believed, from having lived constantly amongst them, and away from the neigbourhood of the ship, that prodigies had"], [488, "[IS Id. 28 MISSION AT VAVAO. been effected amongst that nation. But I suspect that the harshness which ensued caused them to revolt, and by that measure broke a link in the chain which it will be no easy matter to unite. I understand, however, that at the districts distant from the port of Papeete much regularity still pre vails. This is one British mission. Reports from Hua heine, and what I myself witnessed, of the benig nant features of Mr. Barff, lead us to believe that happiness and content reign there. The success of the late Mr. Williams, who was beloved at Raratonga, is shown by his narrative. I must add, from personal observation, that I was most agreeably surprised at finding the condition of the people under their esteemed friend and pastor, Mr. Buzacott, (with a good, honest, hearty John Bull countenance, to court instead of terrify,) far exceed my expectations, and I certainly think that Mr. Orme's picture must have been furnished from thence. At Vavao, however, the missionary creed, I un derstand, changes, consequently the system may be more rigorous. All I can state is, that the ap proach of the missionary to my tent was not hailed with anything like satifaction by the natives, and that I lost many articles of curiosity, from parties being afraid to approach without his approbation. In the morning our tents were pitched in the face of the hill on which the town is situated, and"], [489, "1840.] 29 TRAFFIC we succeeded in obtaining most of our magnetic observations. Rain set in, preventing our obtaining the requisite astronomical observations until the day following. We were soon surrounded by natives anxious to dispose of their wares, but the absence of the chiefs, and principal people, caused a very apparent dejec tion. Vegetables, fruit, cloth, (tapa,) mats, shells, and weapons, were brought for barter, but their prices, since the days of Cook, have materially in creased ; cotton, cloth, and knives, were the only trading articles. Money they knew by name, but hardly under stood its value; as they frequently demanded a dollar in lieu of a knife worth fourpence, and were generally content with a real, (sixpence,) in lieu. The term dollar (or tarra) is here, as at Tahiti, intended to imply coin, and the immediate offer of the real, one eighth its value, was frequently taken with avidity. The manners of the natives appeared to be seve ral shades superior to those of any of the islands we had visited, evidently resulting from a more determined character, and a reflective turn; pro bably much assisted by their stricter adherence to Christianity, which at this particular moment of religious warfare, they feel it necessary to maintain with closer observance. At dawn and dark the voice of prayer and singing may be heard from each house throughout the settlement, and on Sunday"], [490, "30 [1840. CAPTIVE CHIEF. the full chorus of natives afforded a very fair speci men of their singing. The church is spacious, and tastefully ornamented with native mats on the rafters, much resembling printed calico. The interior of most of the mis sionary and other houses, here as well as at the other islands in these seas, generally have the rafters, ten or fifteen feet upwards from the eaves, decorated in this manner. We saw but little of their workmanship, owing to the absence of the canoes, chiefs, and warriors. The few articles obtained were inferior, excepting their household wares, consisting of mats, pillows, &c, which are very simple. The frequent visits of whale-ships have also drained the market. A state prisoner, \" the heathen king,\" as well as his family from one of the islands, was in our immediate neighbourhood. I visited them, and gave them various presents. They were much dejected, and apparently very grateful for the notice bestowed on them. A very pretty little girl, either a daughter or relative, about six or seven years old, seemed to have much influence with the natives, and interested herself very much in bartering for us, and preventing undue demands. I presented her with various trifles, par ticularly beads, which were useless in the market. On the day of our departure, she brought a number more of her own age, and literally commanded by her manner, that they should be similarly treated. As she was a princess, there could be no denial !"], [491, "1840.] 31 GEOLOGY. It is very strange, that although we have generally noticed beautiful children, we have seldom, if at all, seen a striking grown up beauty. When I took leave of this unfortunate family, several little presents were secretly sent to me through the pilot. That from the king was a piece of kava root, wrapped very carefully in tapa ; doubtless, a most splendid gift in his estimation, but if it had been detected in his possession, I was told that he would be severely punished. We had no opportunity of examining the coun try, our arrival being on Saturday, and our depar ture the evening following. The trees here do not attain the size of those in higher islands, but from their being thinner, they attain a much closer tex ture. The Tamanu, although it does not attain a large size, is much superior in grain and beauty, to that of Tahiti or Raratonga. The highest range of land, all of which might easily be converted into one great garden, does not at any point exceed three hundred feet. The surface is very level, and the soil fine. The composition of the rock is a very close-grained limestone, containing large caverns, in which crystal lized carbonate of lime, stalactites, &c, abound. In deed, wherever the cliff is fractured a complete crystal line structure is presented, in which shells, coral, &c. are frequent. At the outer position, where I ob tained observations, I found many specimens of imbedded fossil nautilus. None of the nacreous"], [492, "[1840. 32 PRODUCTIONS. substance remained, but was replaced by crystallized carbonate of lime. The hardness of the rock, added to its broad flat surface, prevented me from obtain ing more than a single specimen. At the sea level the water has worn away the outlines so much, that all the cliffs overhang the islands, presenting a mushroom form. The caving runs about ten to fifteen feet horizontally, by five or six vertically ; consequently, where the sea has much play, and the coast is exposed, landing is imprac ticable. In some cases the overhanging mass has fallen away, and landing is facilitated ; but the depths alongside these islands increase suddenly to forty fathoms or more. The supplies to be obtained at this island chiefly consist of yams, which were said to be the finest in these seas. The hurricanes have injured or de stroyed the greater part of the fruit-trees, otherwise shaddocks and cocoa-nuts would be plentiful. I noticed but one indifferent shaddock, a few pines, cabbages, onions, and yams. But our arrival was hardly known in time, and Saturday is so completely devoted to cooking for the next day, that little was produced. Here again we met with the iron hand of the missionaries, for they rule the king, chiefs, and people. The system throughout these islands, of prohibiting even the necessary ablutions on the sabbath, is a stretch of feeling far beyond good sense. A cer tain hour might be established by law, at which necessary labours should cease."], [493, "1840.] 33 ISLAND OF LATTE. Fish is either scarce, or other occupations prevent the people from seeking it. The great depth of water also around these islands is another drawback. Were it not for this cause, this groupe would afford some of the finest harbours in the world. But, excepting the inner harbour, I should not consider my ship pleasantly berthed, the depths decreasing suddenly from ten, sixteen and twenty-five to forty-five fathoms. Our stay was too short to admit of any survey being made. At three on the 23rd of May, we took our depar ture fromVavao, and had barely cleared the entrance when the breeze chopped round to S.S.W., pre venting our making much headway. Final observations for rating were obtained at our first station, as well as the true bearing of the Peak of the island of Latte, which we were eventually enabled to fix, from a sea position, the day following. I am informed that very dangerous breakers extend a considerable distance from its western extremity. The positions fixed by us were, first, the outer white-faced point on the left side of entrance, which can readily be known by being the nearest to Nine-pin Island. It is situated in latitude 18\u00b0 38' N., longi tude 174\u00b0 3' W. The second position at the town is in the King's Old Garden, latitude 18\u00b0 39' N., longitude 173\u00b0 55' W., variation 9\u00b0 34, dip 35\u00b0 T.

On the 26th, we made the easternmost of the Feejee Groupe, about forty miles to the northward of Turtle Island, and passing through between the islands, were soon favoured with a fair wind. Previous to quitting Tahiti, we had been fortunate in obtaining information respecting this group, and particularly of several new islands not laid down, which are excellent guides to what is deemed the best harbour, Nukulau, on the southern side of Ambou. At noon, on the 27th, we passed the island of Matoke, and shaping a course for Ambou, found our selves, about two a.m., quite close enough to the breakers, tacking within sight and hearing of them. We had, not a moment before, had our attention ex cited by lights, probably fishermen on the reefs, other wise our position might have been hazardous. The"], [497, "37 1840.] LAND ON NUKULAU. lights were instantly withdrawn, upon our showing lights at our foreyardarm. At daylight the current had set us considerably to the westward, and just as we bore up for the anchorage, the breeze headed us off. As this was followed by calm, I immediately started in my gig, to save time, as well as examine the anchorage, &c, leaving the sketch of the entrance with the com manding officer. We reached the island of Nuku lau, about half-past ten, and were visited by a few fishermen, and, at noon, by seven double (sailing) canoes, having about ten to twenty persons in each. One who termed himself \" a small thief,\" (chief,) un derstood a few words of English, and acquainted us that they were bound to Cantab, or Mywoollah on the charts, which are nearly useless. About two the ship entered by the eastern chan nel, and one of the natives immediately volunteered his services to conduct her through the shoals. I had already my misgivings about that channel, although stated to be \" quite free from danger,\" and whilst anxiously watching her progress, as well as that of the boat with the pilot, had the mortification to see her take the ground. In a very few moments the ensign, union reversed, informed me that the accident was serious, and called for my immediate presence. No time was lost in packing up our instruments, and proceeding to her. On reaching her, I found that she was afloat, but had her rudder off, and had broken the pintles."], [498, "[1840. 38 chief's BROTHER CAPTURED. \" Misfortunes never come single.\" Having an chored and secured the rudder, we commenced waip ing, occasionally assisting her by the fore and aft sails, when she suddenly went from ten into two fathoms, with her stem between two rocks. The tide left her, and having steadied her by the stream anchor in still water, we patiently awaited the turn of tide, when we warped her forward to her anchorage, discovering several other patches in our route. In the midst of distress we were visited by Mr. Cargill, one of the resident missionaries, whose wife, then dangerously ill, required medical assistance. From him we ascertained that the American sur veying squadron were still at this group, the Peacock having quitted the port but a few days since ; the Vincennes was supposed to be at Tacanoa, or Obalau, where they were all to rendezvous. One of the king's brothers having taken an active part in an attack, or retaliation upon an American vessel, by which the mate and several of the crew lost their lives, opportunity was taken, when the king, queen, and chiefs were guests, to detain them as prisoners until this man was delivered up. Sooner than lose their king, his brother, Tho-ka-nau-to, or Phillips, volunteered to produce him. On his ap pearance he was heavily ironed and taken away. It is said he will be taken to America, but what they can do to him is very problematical. In consequence of this affair, our reception was anything but flattering. Neither the king, his"], [499, "1840.] STARLING DESPATCHED TO LIBOOKA. 39 brothers, or the chiefs, would venture within our power for some days. This partly vanished, when it became known that it was a British vessel of war. The king, however, refused to come until I had paid him a visit, which my duties prevented for some days. On the second day after our arrival, Mrs. Cargill died, and as my duties rendered my absence impos sible, the senior lieutenant, attended by all the officers who could be spared, was sent to attend the funeral. As there was a probability that one of the Ameri can ships could spare us rudder pintles, the Starling was immediately despatched to make the necessary application ; on which occasion, Phillips, (the king's brother,) who speaks English well, volunteered to pilot the schooner to Libooka, where the Peacock was supposed to be at anchor. In the meantime the rudder was hoisted in, and preparations made for securing it, in the event of her mission proving unsuccessful. Measures were taken to complete the survey of this port ; and the tents, &c, were pitched on the island of Nukulau, for obtaining the necessary suite of magnetic observations, &c. For several days we were beset by the natives, and were finally compelled to erect barrier lines, and appoint a guard to keep them at a proper distance ; not from any troublesome conduct on their part, but the nature of the ob servations did not admit of the vibrations caused"], [500, "[1840. 40 GARINGAR1A. by such numbers walking to and fro on the loose sand. The king's brother, Garin-ga-ria, paid us a visit, in order to ascertain what he could pick up, and nume rous spears, clubs, bows, arrows, and ornaments, were brought for sale ; but, as customary with these people, they were exorbitant in their demands \u2014 whale's teeth, knives, &c, being the objects sought in ex change. My object was first to secure pigs and yams for the crew, and then look for arms, curiosities, &c. Indeed, I had promised Phillips, to await his return. Some few pigs, yams, and fruit, were purchased. Ver million was found to be an article in great demand amongst the ladies ; I therefore gave them to under stand I should reserve this for shells, which they were to seek on the reefs, and with which we were soon inundated : although none of them were of any value* The canoes bound for Cantab, unfortunately for us, put back the moment they perceived the ship at anchor, making our island their rendezvous, and rendering it a difficult matter to preserve order. However, as some of the principal chiefs accompanied Garin-ga-ria, as well as their interpreter, and \"law yer,\" I made known my wish to have the space oc cupied by my party tabooed. In a few minutes the lawyer, or crown orator, made known that he was about to address them. As if by magic, every one immediately became seated, and a simultaneous signal, by clapping the hands"], [501, "1840.] 41 BOUNDARIES ESTABLISHED and a hollow nasal ivhoo, denoted that they were attentive. The manner and gesture of the orator was energetic and admirable, but as we understood nothing that was uttered, all that we can say is, that many parts of his harangue were specially applauded, and at its termination the same whoo and clapping of hands ensued. I was now informed by the interpreters, (an Ame rican black, and two or three Tahitans,) that they would observe my wishes and respect the boundaries, which we accordingly formed by stretching lead lines from post to post. Itisa curious fact, observed through out the groups from Marquesas to this island, that a nativewill seldomstooptopass2\u00ab\u00abc?(?raline; andinmany cases rather than step over it, even when lying on the ground, they would walk entirely round the end. This was rigidly adhered to at Marquesas. I have my doubts if this line of demarcation is not offensive to them. Notwithstanding the efforts of the crown lawyer, I found that nothing but \" vi et armis \" would preserve the boundary, and was compelled, therefore, to keep sentinels constantly on the alert. These interpreters alluded to are foreigners taken under the protection of different chiefs ; they are, de facto, their slaves so long as they are maintained, and are even compelled to feed their masters when the custom of the country, or their being placed under Tambo (or tabu) prevents their touching their own food with their hands. I am sorry to say that Englishmen are amongst the"], [502, "42 [IS III. TOWN OF REWA. number. One of these, the American black, I took into my service during our stay, as interpreter, and he behaved satisfactorily. Finding that the king was afraid to visit the ship, in consequence of my failure in visiting the town of Rewa, I determined on sacrificing a few hours and paying him a visit ; as, until he was propitiated, there was no chance of obtaining the necessary supplies of hogs and vegetables. I therefore started, taking with me Lieut. Monypenny. The distance to the town of Rewa from the anchorage is about six miles, and two to the mouth of the river, studded with unpleasant sand banks, over which there is about three feet at low water, and on which the capricious rollers at times suddenly bestow a ducking. After entering the river, the channel at low water becomes tortuous, and the drain generally bears out, although the main-banks are about four hundred yards asunder. The canoes are generally forced up by poles, similar to punting on the Thames. The town of Rewa is situated about half a mile from the bank of the river, on the right bank of a creek, which shoots off abruptly from the main stream the width of the creek at that point not exceeding one hundred yards. The houses, which overlook the creek in some places, are firmly constructed with posts, which do not rise more than seven feet from the earth. On these arise very lofty pitched roofs, varying from"], [503, "1840.] 43 FIGHTING BOURRI. twenty-five to thirty feet in height, and in some instances thatched to the thickness of two feet. The doors are small, excepting in the state-house, and resemble windows or ports ; those in elevated mounds with ditches remind one strongly of block-houses. In the state-house the resemblance is rendered still closer by the presence of two ship guns, as if prepared for war ; certainly not very appropriate chamber companions. The establishment of the king is situated upon a bend of the creek, the houses of his queens occupying the water-side, and his own being in an open area, in which also is the house of his principal queen, the tomb of his father and brothers, and the \" fighting Bourri,\" or temple. This latter is a small building about twelve feet square, erected upon a mound of about ten feet elevation. The thatched roof is very steep, probably thirty feet, across the summit of which is a pole projecting about three feet at each"], [504, "44 KING'S PALACE [1840. end, studded with brilliant white porcellanic shells. (Ovula ovum.) Their canoes are similar to most of those belong ing to the low islands, very long and narrow, fur nished with outriggers, and a convenient house on a platform. Vide wood-cut. The house of the king (or more properly chief of Rewa, he being subordinate to the king at Obalau) is one of the most filthy in the town. Its dimensions are about sixty feet in length by thirty wide. Two thirds of it is well clothed with mats and kept clean ; the remainder may be considered the cooking and eating hall, &c. Three immense iron caldrons, probably intended for a whale-ship, together with other earthen vessels for boiling, occupy the cooking square. The king and favourite queen were seated upon a range of mats immediately contiguous to the fire, and on entering invited us to do the same. Shortly after, a roasted hog and vegetables were introduced, and we were invited to partake. As they had neither knives, forks, nor plates, I followed their motions, rather than the chiefs should take fresh offence, and our journey prove fruitless. The carving of this hog was most adroitly per formed by the \" carver general,\" a professor, with a piece of slit bamboo, which by-the-bye was first cut into shape with a steel knife; therefore I suspect etiquette demands that the bamboo should be pre ferred. The king's barber, taster, &c, (or I suppose"], [505, "45 1840.] KING'S BARBER. \" the barber royal \" to be his proper style,) selects the king's portion, peels his taro, or yam, and pre sents it, without any humiliating forms, in a clean leaf. This person is never permitted, under penalty of instant death, to touch his own food with his hands ; and he maybe seen tearing his meat like a dog from the floor with his teeth, whilst it is there held by a stick. Before the king commences eating, all present clap their hands about four times. If he drinks, finishes, or sneezes, the same is repeated. The principal queen and about ten other queens were present. As I found that friendship was established, and the king signified his intention to visit the ship on the following Monday, I gladly took my leave. As some mischievous persons had been busy in ducing the chiefs to withhold supplies to the ship, to suit their own purposes, I visited the brother of the king, Garingaria, reported to be in the list of malcontents, and most active in the pig embargo. His house I found very superior to that of the king ; very large, neat, and well arranged, but nevertheless that of a perfect savage. This Garingaria is re ported as the most determined cannibal of this group. He has his friends as well as enemies, and although savage, is less deceitful than those around him. I would much rather be his prisoner than that of the king or any of his immediate retinue. He distinctly denied any participation in the plot. and I instantly saw by his countenance that he"], [506, "46 [1840. CHIEFS OF REWA. spoke the truth. He immediately sent down a pre sent of three pigs. The king of Rewa is a very strong-built, muscu lar man, standing about six feet two inches ; Phillips. or Thokanauto, five feet ten inches ; Garingaria probably six feet four inches. The prisoner taken away in the Peacock, said to be a very fine man, we did not see. The present king, who is considered a very weak-minded man, and despised by his bro thers, succeeded his father, who, according to custom, was murdered to make room for him. It is not improbable that his death will shortly enable one of the remaining brothers to succeed him. Indeed, Phillips said in his presence, \" I shall be king in four years.\" I found there were plenty of spies to in terpret falsely the few English sentences which escaped me. As the moment approached for the king's visit, his courage failed, and as it suited my purpose to re-visit Rewa, I went up to tell him my opinion. I found myself so perplexed by the falsehoods and misrepresentations, by which he had been misled, that I left him in disgust, but not without adopting secure measures for our supplies. On the day following, yams in profusion arrived, but few pigs ; and having purchased sufficient for our crew, I declined further barter until the arrival of more pigs. On the 13th, the Starling returned, bringing three pintles, belonging to the Peacock, Captain Wilkes, of"], [507, "e*z/ \u25a0"], [508, ""], [509, "1840.] CIVILITY OF COMMODORE WILKES. 47 the Vincennes, having in the handsomest manner despatched one of his boats to that vessel, thinking her size better adapted ; at the same time offering those of the Vincennes, should they not answer. At this critical moment, our carpenter and armourer became ill. Fortunately, an engineer by trade hap pened to call upon me for assistance to recover pro perty alleged to be piratically taken from him, and as he would be compelled to await the arrival of the parties, he consented to give his assistance in fitting and reducing the metal work, which he exe cuted admirably ; and by the evening of the 15th, we were in a condition to complete our voyage. On the evening of the 15th, the tender of the Vincennes hove in sight, and Captain Wilkes him self very shortly came on board. Under any cir cumstances this was a satisfaction I had long hoped for, but in these remote regions, and entirely shut out from civilized beings, it became, independent of the feelings due to his promptitude in relieving our difficulties, matter of sincere satisfaction. Un fortunately I had only that morning despatched the Starling to fix the position of Banga, one of the new islands not placed on the chart, and had pro mised to join him on Monday. Having, however, been nearly eighteen hours together, we were en abled to talk over matters of much interest to both expeditions, and as they would go over part of our ground, their observations made in the same posi tions would become doubly interesting."], [510, "[1840. 48 SULPHUR QUITS NUKULAU. Our observatory and tents being embarked, and rudder in order, after dinner we parted ; and by the aid of the moon the Sulphur was again moving through the waters with her accustomed freedom. The United States Expedition, under the com mand of Commodore Wilkes, had very recently re turned from the Antarctic regions, via New South Wales, bringing us later English news than we had previously seen. They had visited the Tonga group, and had been about six weeks examining the Feejees, of which they intended to complete the chart. When I state that four large islands occurred in our passage alone, which are not placed on the charts, and that many unnoticed exist in the whole group, which is most erroneously set forth in the charts, the value of their labours may be easily appreciated. Owing to threats held out that vengeance would be taken for the capture of the chief by the Pea cock, I did not conceive it right to risk the chance of aggression, by permitting our parties to pursue their examinations where our force could not act ; consequently, beyond the island of Nukulau and the beach-line little was obtained. The anchorage of Nukulau is safe, as well as con venient. Two safe and easy passages lead to it, and with the assistance of the chart, vessels can enter at all times without a pilot. The eastern channel, by which the Sulphur entered, is also safe, if assisted by the chart and a boat ahead. The best anchorage is in twelve fathoms, with the outer"], [511, "49 1840.] RIVERS OF AMBOW. island barely shut in with Nukulau, about two cables length from the shore, in a muddy bottom. The strongest breezes blow from south to south-west. Water can be had at Nukulau, or by sending up the river. The Sulphur watered at the island. At present there are so many doubts about the proper name of the main island, that I retain \" Ambow,\"* this being the name understood by the chiefs and natives, and it has stood sufficiently long on the charts for preference. It is traversed byT very extensive rivers, and the chiefs assert that in the rainy season the fresh water prevails one mile beyond the breakers. It is also asserted that no one has yet reached the source of this river, and that numerous other similar streams exist. The Americans made the attempt, and I am informed penetrated six miles beyond any previ ous white person. I am not aware of anything to repay the labour, which probably would entail sickness on the exploring party. The mountains are lofty, and exhibit deep ravines between the ranges, which alone would account for powerful streams. They are generally shallow, and not adapted for navigation. A code of regulations has been drawn up and signed by mark, for the chiefs of Rewa, (not of Ba-ou,) but as they neither read, write, nor under stand the laws they have enacted, (possibly Phillips may be an exception,) they will prove a dead letter. * I think, although Ambow on charts, that it should be written Ambauo.

Their implements of war arc clubs, spears, bows, and arrows ; but the club appears to be that gene rallv in use. Probably the spear may be used on the first charge, but in conversation they never say that \" a man was speared ;\" it is invariably \" clubbed.\" These clubs are very neatly made, of a strong hard wood, resembling live oak in grain, and ornamented with coloured sennit, made from cocoa-nut fibre. They generally carry with them short clubs, similar to \" life preservers,\" which are the club root of a pe culiar tree affording a knob about the size of an orange, the stem, or handle, seldom exceeding three quarters of an inch in diameter. These are either carved or smoothly polished. It is a very formida ble weapon, and probably, excepting in actions where numbers are engaged, their most fatal instru ment of death. They readily part with any of their arms or ornaments for whale teeth, which are at all times irresistible articles in traffic. The costume of the men is similar to that of the Tonga group, or most of the Pacific Islands, viz., a simple maro round the waist. The chiefs who possess European finery, seldom exhibit it, except ing Phillips, (Thokanauto) who generally made his appearance in white trowsers, shirt, waistcoat, and surtout. Indeed, I would not permit him to visit the ship in any other costume. This chief speaks English, French, and Spanish, is clever and intelli gent, and has made one or two voyages in an Ame-\" rican trader to Tahiti, and the neighbouring islands."], [513, "1840.] 51 THOKANAUTO OR PHILLIPS. It is probable that he will shortly have the chief power at Rewa, as he broadly hinted in the pre sence of his brother. It is to be hoped that he will attain it by a more civilized process than the cus tomary mode. The king or principal chief of Ambow, \" Old Snuff,\" as he is termed, resides at Bauo, or Bow, about thirty miles up the river, and near to the river which empties itself northerly at Obalauo. His son, \" Young Snuff,\" is described as an active, intelli gent young man, much prepossessed in favour of our countrymen. Indeed, the abstraction of the Rewa chief by the Americans has irritated the natives amazingly, and will probably injure their mercantile interests. The story told here is that this chief resented some in dignity offered him by an American trader on some former visit, and on the return of some of the crew in another vessel, they were \" clubbed.\" It is stated that he was kept chained in her main top, but escaped, and swam ashore. However, on the arrival of the American squadron, the Peacock was despatched to demand this chief. His capture was achieved as before stated. This was the ver sion given by the missionaries. Doubtless we shall hear the facts in a more authenticated form, when the narrative of the exploring voyage comes out. Both men and women take great pride in dress ing their hair. Although it is long enough some times to reach to the waist, it nevertheless has a e 2"], [514, "[1840. 52 MODE OF DRESSING HAIR. strong disposition to curl or frizzle, and the main object appears to be to render each individual hair independent, presenting an uniform mob, similar to the wigs of onr bishops. In one instance I measured the distance from the skin to the outer edge of the hair, which was six inches. In some cases of the first class queens, the external shape was beautifully even and round, generally coloured by powder, of a very light lead colour. The men in many in stances have their hair party-coloured ; sometimes black, red, blue, and lead, or dirty white, on the same scalp. In several instances I noticed a single red long lock cultivated from the side of a thick frizzled black mob. These colours are obtained from dif ferent barks, the whitish or lead colour from the ashes of the bark of the bread fruit-tree. Those who cannot maintain a barber frequently cover the hair with tapa, which gives it the appearance of a turban. This style of dress, with their thick black beards, and tapa thrown over the shoulder, gives them a Turkish aspect. They are inordinately fond of paint. Vermilion is equal to gold ; but failing this, they besmear themselves w*ith a thick coating of lampblack, and oil or varnish, and vary it by scor ing off until the skin shews, or by coloured ashes. Their chief object in dress is to render themselves as unlike human beings as possible ; the more ter rific, the more admired. They have nearly the same abhorrence of a white skin as we have of a black one."], [515, "1840.] 53 DISCUSSION OF RELIGION. The women wear an ornamented belt, about four inches deep, with six inches fringe, called a leekee- They are very neatly worked, and are becoming. The queen of Rewa had no other covering. Her hair, however, was very neatly dressed, and as per fect as if she had come from under the hands of a French frisseur. I am afraid that the missionaries will find these people far beyond their powers. They have no chiefs of sufficient importance to carry into effect any important change, and possibly if any one at tempted it otherwise than by example, his head might pay the forfeit. They are too self-willed and independent to be driven, and at the present moment far too ferocious to submit to any re straint. I put the question to Phillips, who answered im mediately to the point. \" They have no objection to the residence of the missionaries, and would feed them ; and would not molest any one voluntarily embracing their religion. But they dislike their spying into their houses. By-and bye, when they see more of them, and understand them, the people may come round.\" \" But,\" I observed, \" the chiefs should set the example, as the kings of all the other islands have done.\" \" What did they give them for helping them ?\" I replied, \" Nothing ; they were induced by the"], [516, "[184(1. 54 ARRIVE AT BANGA. superior advantages which the christian religion of fered.\" As he could not be made to comprehend this part of the subject, and appeared restless, I changed the topic. With a light air from the eastward, we pursued our course for the island of Banga, and about four a.m. observed the Starling at anchor. Lieut. Kellett came on board at daylight, but as nothing offered of sufficient interest to detain the ship, I merely landed to secure the position, and complete the survey which had been commenced by the Starling. The anchorage is safe and convenient, and pro bably, had I been aware of its existence, would have been selected in preference to Nukulau for our astronomical position, as being more detached from a large population. Not long since it pos sessed its full portion of inhabitants ; but on the death of their king, who was tributary to the king of Rewa, the chiefs determined to throw off the yoke, and become independent. Such a pretext for war was not overlooked, and a band of warriors immediately issued forth to reduce them to submission, or in plainer terms, to rob them of all they possessed. This was found difficult by reason of their fastnesses, the towns being situated in many cases on the very summit of the mountains, elevated one thousand four hundred feet above the sea"], [517, "1840.] 55 CANNIBALISM. Finding they were not sufficiently strong, rein forcements were demanded, which were sent under the command of Garingaria, or raised by him under a contract that he might exterminate them. His brother, Thokanauto, (or Phillips,) who is up held as the white man's friend, (but only so long as he can get anything from him,) was foremost in destroying the villagers by fire, and committing other brutal acts. The expedition resulted in vic tory to the besiegers, the death of the principal chief, and several hundreds of the population. The son of the chief was spared to govern, under the usual subjection. The sequel will hardly be credited, yet it is be yond doubt : cannibalism to a frightful degree still prevails amongst this people, and, as it would seem, almost as one of their highest enjoyments. The victims of this ferocious slaughter were regularly prepared, being baked, packed, and distributed in portions to the various towns which furnished warriors, according to their exploits ; and they were feasted on with a degree of savage barbarity nearly incredible ! They imagine that they increase in bravery, by eating their valorous enemy. This Garingaria is a noted cannibal, and it is as serted that he killed one of his wives and ate her. This he denied, and accounted for her death (which took place violently by his order) on other grounds. He did not attempt a denial of bis acts at Banga, nor did Phillips. These occurrences are of late"], [518, "[1840. 56 CHIEF GARINGARIA. date. I am told they threw one or more of the heads (which they do not eat) into the missionary's compound. The population of the Feejees are very tall, far above the height of any other nation I have seen. Of five men assembled in my tent, none were under six feet two inches. It was rather an awkward sub ject to tax Garingaria with in his own house, and solely attended by his own dependent, our inter preter; but he took it very quietly, and observed that he cared not for human flesh, unless it was that of his enemy, and taken in battle. When he used this expression, I could not help thinking that his lips were sympathetically in motion, and that I had better not make myself too hostile. I there fore bid him good evening. Quitting the unfortunate island of Banga, we steered a course to pass close to Cantab, and the following day passed its western extreme, steering for Tanna, one of the southernmost of the New Hebrides. On the 20th we made for the island of Erronan, which, from our great distance, presented the appear ance of a low flat island. On the following morn ing we passed about seven miles to the southward, when a nearer view showed it to be a very high truncated cone, well wooded, and surrounded by a low belt of flat land, projecting about half a mile beyond its base. We were not sufficiently near to observe inhabitants, or if landing or harbours ex isted."], [519, "1840.] 57 REACH PORT RESOLUTION. Shortly after, the island of Annatom was noticed to the S. W., and Tanna west. Annatom presents undulating hills, but no remarkable peaks or strik ing features. Tanna is a larger island, presents high peaks and ranges on the southern portion, with very abrupt cliffy bluffs. Port Resolution may readily be found, by a very remarkable yellow sandstone bluff at its north-west angle, and which is situated to the northward of the entrance ; also by the smoke of the volcano, a little inland from it. Approaching from the southward, the entrance of the port might be over shot, by reason of the overlapping breakers ; but by bearing in mind that it is formed by the low peninsular south-east angle, and that the entrance is situated about one mile southerly of the yellow bluff, it will easily be found. By noon we reached the entrance, the wind being dead out : but by edging close to the breakers on our left, and hauling sharp up, we made the entrance, and in four boards reached our berth inside in six fathoms. It is too narrow for a long vessel to work in, and it is preferable to shoot into fifteen fathoms, and be prepared to warp. We were soon visited by the natives, in some of the most miserable apologies for canoes that we have yet witnessed. In one of these frail barks came the resident missionary, a native of Samoa, one of the Navigator Group, left here by the mis sionary vessel to convert these people. I took him"], [520, "[I MO. 58 MISSIONARIES FROM \" NAVIGATORS.\" with me to select a position favourable for our ob servations. This did not appear likely to be effected on the eastern side of the bay, and we therefore commenced those requiring the most undivided attention on the western rocky cliffs. The natives, however, soon began to find us there, which, added to the frequent vibration from the volcano, determined me on trying the town side the ensuing day. Being short of fuel, and depending on the peace able character given of these people by Cook, added to the presence of the messengers of peace and good will, I determined on making the most of time here, and parties were accordingly despatched wood ing, as well as making the survey of the port. Our observing position was pitched in front of the house of the missionaries, a mere thatched hovel, in which five unfortunate natives of the Navigators were literally imprisoned, being compelled to close the door, immediately one entered or departed, to prevent the intrusion of the natives. Their number consisted originally of six men and two women, but their chief (or king, as they termed him,) died not long since, and the remainder were suffering more or less from fever and ague. They appear to be very uneasy and unhappy, and painfully anxious to return to their native land. They enquired most anxiously and eagerly if we were bound to the Navigators; and although their stock of English was but scanty, we could plainly understand that they were in great fear"], [521, "59 1840.] UNPLEASANT SITUATION. from the natives, and much dreaded our departure. They were, moreover, aware of the melancholy fate of Mr. Williams and his companion, at the neigh bouring island of Mallicolo. It was with feelings of deep disappointment that our mutual ignorance of the language prevented me from using any exertions to smooth their way with the natives, who appear a most lawless set. The surgeon inquired into their complaints, and his pre scriptions probably afforded temporary alleviation, but, with the mind so much depressed and harassed, I fear recovery is problematical. The only chance they now have, is the return of the missionary vessel from New South Wales, when they will be doubtless removed to Samoa. The fatal catastrophe to Mr. Williams, and his companion at Mallicolo, has not failed to make a deep impression ; and although the natives en deavoured to persuade us that they abhorred the unnatural practice of cannibalism, I should be very sorry to be placed at their mercy. I certainly felt a more than ordinary interest about these unfor tunate beings, and the frequent repetition of \"Samoa, Samoa,\" from the sick within the hut, sounded like the cry of the condemned. During the course of my pursuits, I was frequently annoyed by the natives intruding too closely on our tabu lines, although frequently warned by their own chief, as wells as one of the missionaries, to preserve the prescribed boundaries. It was unfortunate that"], [522, "60 [1840. NATIVES TROUBLESOME. we had so many irons in the fire, otherwise I could have placed sufficient men on the lines of demarca tion to have effectually deterred the ill-disposed from seeking a quarrel, for which several were evi dently much inclined. I had also a strong reason for keeping up a good understanding, without arms, if possible, in order to show them how little we feared anything from them, want of decision generally, in my opinion, acting rather as an inducement to molestation. Had force been resorted to, I also foresaw that their spleen might have been vented upon the unfortunate, un protected missionaries, who were already dreading our departure. Though their actions, to other visitors, not simi larly occupied with ourselves, would have been deemed harmless, they, monkey-like, no sooner com prehended that they could, without serious displeasure, annoy me by the vibration of the ground at the mo ments for observation, than they commenced simul taneous poundings with billets of wood, and threw stones high into the air, which fell near and risked the instruments. In order to secure the last and most important set, (which can only be comprehend ed by those as intently engaged,) I found it necessary to clear the ground to a certain distance, and to effect this, recalled one of the cutters ; letting the chiefs understand my determination. The instant the crew landed, they enforced my wishes, and the yell of departure, half serious, half"], [523, "1840.] 61 AWKWARD PREDICAMENT. comic, which burst forth, hadnearly awakened theslum bers of the Sulphur, which had kept an attentive eye on our movements. Anything, even in mimic hostility after this, would have drawn an unfortunate shot : of this I was not aware until my return in the evening. However, a few minutes sufficed to complete what I required, when I hastened to remove anything like bad feeling, by mixing immediately with them. The sentinel having reported that one of the natives raised his club with a threatening attitude, when he warned him off the instruments, I immediately went to him and desired him, by signs, to lay down his club, which he immediately did, trembling. I then gave it in charge to the sentinel, who placed it under his foot for safer custody, and the native was ordered out of bounds. A cry of derision at his ex pense followed. The chiefs were with me, and re quested me to be quiet, ordering the people back. After great intercession on the part of the chiefs, and on condition that the man was sent entirely away, I allowed the club to be restored to his chief. This shows how completely savages may be reduced from insolence to abject fear, by even pretending deter mination, for I was unarmed. But as it was done in a good-humoured manner, and made a joke against the party, it failed to procure him support had he been inclined to resist. Very little was brought to the beach for traffic, although on my landing the first question asked, was for \"permission to open trade.\" The little that"], [524, "[1840. 62 HABITS AND DRESS OF NATIVES. theydid bring consisted of large yams, (wcighingthirty six pounds,) plantains, malay apples, sugar-cane of very large growth and very tender skin, and a few small O O \u2022*\u25a0 chickens. The ornaments brought were light bows, arrows, and carved wristbands made from the shell of the cocoa-nut. They were not disposed to part with their clubs, or the bits of serpentine suspended to their necks. In all their productions of art they were far behind any of the islands we have visited. They differ also from any hitherto noticed by us in their costume. The hair is bound into minute ringlets, about one twentieth of an inch in diameter, the last three or four inches of the ends being allowed to curl, or wave, so that it assumes a thick wig of lines, fagged at the ends. They are very plentifully smeared with black and red paint, the latter resembling very coarse ochre, but vermilion they did not value. They do not wear the customary maro, or tapas, on the loins ; but follow the custom in many parts of Africa, of binding matting, terminating in ornaments. The women wear a petticoat, very similar in fashion to that of Nootka, Columbia River, &c, but formed of the loose fibres of the Hibiscus tiliaceus, (or Purau.) This is heavy, and being sometimes worn diagonally over one shoulder, forms a covering to the side exposed to the sun. The septum of the nose of the women is perforated, and from the size of the aperture, calculated to sustain a weighty ornament. The lobes of the ear, in the males, are also perfo-"], [525, "63 1840.] CHARACTER OF NATIVES. rated, but no ornaments were displayed in them. The men also wore shells round the arm, above the elbow, (generally Ovula Ovum,) and some few had pretty cones and bulla round the neck ; but we were unable to procure a single live shell from them, although they were distinctly aware that they would receive ample compensation for their labours. Altogether they appear to be very low in the scale of human beings, little inclined to traffic, filthy, ill looking, insolent, and troublesome as a people. Of course there are exceptions. Our party employed wooding at the extreme end of the bay, were latterly troubled by their throwing stones, but this probably arose merely from a mis chievous disposition. By four o'clock our operations were concluded, and having presented to our unfortunate friends the missionaries, some few necessaries, and taken leave not without some misgiving as to their security, I walked to the extremity of the bay, towards the ship, the gig keeping pace along shore, purchasing occasionally the few things brought down by the natives, who con tinued to throng about me with much good-humour. I pursued this course purposely, in order to dis cover if any ill-feeling existed amongst them ; and to ensure keeping them at a respectful distance, I very quietly borrowed the club of the nearest man, without the slightest resistance on his part, (although generally they are very tenacious on this point, when"], [526, "[1840. 64 QUIT PORT RESOLUTION. arms are near,) and used it to make them preserve their distance. These acts, although trivial to the reader, were performed in a manner which I have never known to fail amongst savages. If resistance is shown I do not persist, generally leaving the matter to the feel ings of those around. But I have never failed in obtaining my object, and restoring* harmony, even when I suspected I had outraged any of their super stitions. If success be proof, I have judged cor rectly ; for I never had occasion in my life, where my own will guided, to have recourse to force. By the time I reached my point for embarkation I found them all in good humour, anxiously inquir ing if the ship slept in the bay, and when we intended to depart ; at the same time making motions to cry, and following us off with Aloha Aleeke, or \" good bye, chief.\" Our gentry who were exploring in pursuit of natural history, were not altogether unmolested, and this circumstance, added to the shortness of our visit, prevented their penetrating far inland. The volcano smoked and muttered occasionally, and, when the breeze blew from it, brought a plentiful supply of cinder dust. The habitations of these people are, in general, mere huts, which I should have supposed temporary, had they not exactly corresponded to the description given of them by Cook. He terms them merely the thatched roof of a house. They are, however, even"], [527, "1840.] 65 THERMAL SPRING. inferior to that, being simply high enough at the apex for a man to stand upright, and certainly not exceed ing six feet spread at the base. Their gardens ap pear to occupy more of their attention, being neatly fenced in with reeds. The surgeon visited the hot spring at the base of the cliff, mentioned in Cook, but the water did not appear to contain anything to render its taste un pleasant. VOL.

Several canoes came off, bringing fowls and fruit, and followed us about a mile, and when they quitted, repeated their aloha, accompanied with invitations to return. It is very probable that another day's sojourn would have made us better acquainted, aud exhibited a better market. The breeze did not permit us to steer a course, and we were barely able to reach a low island to the N.E., mentioned by Cook, which is situated about ten miles to the northward of the port. As we approached, the natives flocked to the beach, where we plainly discerned two, attired in frocks, trowsers, and hats, whom we immediately set down as mis sionaries, probably part of those from Samoa. Several canoes put off, but pulling too far ahead of where we should fetch, failed in reaching us. We tacked within musket-shot of the rocks, which in"], [531, "69 1840.] PASS ERROMANGO. several places appeared to afford convenient cover for landing. Our next board brought us well in with the north point of Tanna, near sunset, and shortly after tack ing, the breeze gradually favoured, until we were enabled to make a free course, during the night, past Erromango. I had failed in putting to sea the previous even ing, in order to allow my crew their full night's rest, as well as in the hope of being able to pass Erromango by daylight, and sufficiently near to communicate with the canoes, or probably to land and determine its position. It was, therefore, a dis appointment, after the late lamentable occurrences at this island or Mallicolo, that they had not the sight of other vessels of war, to afford them the impression at least that Great Britain will not lose sight of her subjects scattered over the vast surface of the globe. I might possibly have derived other inform ation as to their present disposition. At daylight the remarkable saddle peaks, situated over Traitor's Head of Cook, and by which this island may be particularly distinguished, were seen about fifteen miles to the southward. The breeze fresh from S.E., afforded us strong hopes of soon nearing Sandwich Island, and by sunset its outline was well defined. We found ourselves set consi derably to the northward by the current, and changed our course to keep well off the land. Shortly after eight o'clock breakers were reported"], [532, "[1840. 70 ISLAND OF GUADALCANAR. to leeward. The ship was tacked, and we stood off an hour without observing them. We again tacked, and kept the wind until the morning. The report was evidently incorrect, as our position at dawn evinced. By noon we were about fifteen miles off the north end of Sandwich Island, with several smaller in sight in the northern quarter. Our course was shaped to clear the island of Mal licolo, which at sunset was not visible. Wind easterly, with very unpleasant cross swell from S.W., as well as S.E. It was my intention to touch at the island of Guadalcanar, or the nearest convenient spot in that meridian. On the morning of the 1st July we made the island ; weather very unsettled, heavy rain and squalls, and making but little progress against a strong S.W. current. By noon we had reached a small islet off the northern point ; but experienced a very unpleasant sea, and heavy breakers were noticed extending a considerable distance in the offing. Quitting the ship, I ran in with the Starling, until she reached seven fathoms, when, disliking the sea then running, which would have prevented her clawing off in the event of danger, I proceeded in my gig to examine the inner side of the island. Unfortunately no depth for safe anchorage could be found, although the facility for landing rendered this a most eligible spot for our operations. I had previously intended standing, off and on, during the night, and landing in the morning, but on my"], [533, "1840.] 71 NEW IRELAND. return to the ship, finding the current set strong towards the breakers, and moreover having split our foresail, the ship being very uneasy, I determined on seeking a more eligible situation, and bore away for New Ireland. The breeze favoured us, but a strong current from N.E. prevented our making the land on the even ing of the 4th. Unfortunately we had no meridian observation on that day, and heavy squalls with thunder, lightning, and rain, (or the customary rainy season of this region,) overtook us about eight o'clock, at the very moment when we hoped to reach our port. About four a. M., we found ourselves close in with the breakers, the squall providentially clearing up just in time to wear clear of destruction. Calms and baffling winds ensued, preventing our reaching our port by daylight ; but the weather proving fine, and obtaining a fair view of the landmarks, we had no hesitation in running in by night, \u2014 although it had been well if Carteret had stated that the pas sage between the Booby and the main was unsafe. Between the flaws and warping we reached our an chorage in port Carteret by midnight ; affording to our crew a good night's rest, instead of knocking about at the mercy of swell and currents outside. We were fortunate, as the rains recommenced at dawn, and continued with slight intermission during the whole period of our visit. On the second day we succeeded in securing our"], [534, "[1840. 72 PORT CARTERET. principal observations, and the main triangulation of port Carteret. I then joined the Starling, and proceeded to complete the coast as far as Cape St. George, leaving the Sulphur to complete wood, water, &c. Rain still impeded us, but by persever ance and taking every advantage which offered, this was eventually achieved. This southern bay is termed Gower's Harbour and English Cove. The latter is more peculiarly adapted for watering, but does not afford sufficient facility for ingress or egress without towing. At the southern extremity of Gower's Harbour, we fell in with a party of five natives, one of whom spoke a little English. From him we learned that the visits of British vessels from Sidney were frequent ; that the natives who communicated with them resided on the eastern side of the island ; and that their supplies consisted chiefly of wild hogs, fruit, and vegetables. He was anxious to sleep on board the schooner, to which we consented, and his allies, youths from sixteen to eighteen, were de spatched home, with directions to return the follow ing morning with stock, &c. The inclemency of the weather, I suspect, pre vented this, and our labours having terminated, our new friend \" Tom Starling \" (for Jack seldom fails to christen his friends) was landed, and we rejoined the Sulphur that evening. \" Tom Starling \" informed us \" that the rains would cease in one moon, and that they would then"], [535, "73 1840.] PORT GOWER. be considerably more oppressed by the sun.\" The continuance of the torrents of rain has certainly sur passed anything I have before observed in any other clime. Our good fortune, however permitted us to obtain sufficient sun the day following our return, to rate our chronometers, and thus released us from further sojourn in this land of moisture. Just on the eve of departure, half a dozen miser able half-drowned natives came down to the water ing place, bringing a cooked pig, with a few bad specimens of bread fruit. They did not understand English, and having presented them with a few beads and other articles, they were relanded, taking with them their pig, &c. They were entirely naked, very slightly made, and resemble much the natives of Tanna, the hair in the same minute queues, with bushy points, although not bound up. On the morning of the 16th, having embarked the observatory, we quitted Port Carteret ; the day beautifully fine, but wind light. Having examined the range comprehending Ports Carteret and Gower, I should certainly on any future visit prefer what in our survey I have designated Port Sulphur, as that under every circumstance the best adapted for wooding and watering, ingress and egress under canvas, and affording, what is most important, convenient depth for anchorage. In Gower's harbour the depth is not only incon venient, being thirty fathoms, but there is great liability to drag off the bank. In English Cove the"], [536, "[1840. 74 TURTLE BAY. swell sets in so heavily at times that it may be difficult, or impossible, to tow, and watering is not so con venient as in Sulphur Bay. For a temporary supply without intending to anchor, the stream at the southern bay in Gower's Harbour will be found most convenient, as a vessel might drop towards the passage through Gower's Harbour, and pass out by Turtle Bay. The anchorage in Turtle Bay is bad, by reason of the rocky bottom as well as great depth. During our stay there, for two days, in the Starling, we experienced the shock of an earthquake, which led us to believe that we were dragging over rocks. The same was experienced on board the ship at the same instant, and those on shore state that they felt the un dulation strongly. Fuel of the best quality is to be had at the beach in any of these harbours, as well as fancy woods for cabinet making, including tamanu, ebony, &c. The nutmeg was found, but not abundant, nor of the kind valued in commerce. Although Captain Carteret named the greater island in Port Carteret Cocoa Island, from the abun dance of cocoa nuts found there at the period of his visit, not a single tree of this fruit now exists. The bastard sago palm, pandanus, &c, grow luxuriantly, although the depth of soil is literally nothing, the trees rising through the loose limestone rock. The structure of the reefs, points, cliffs, &c, in this region is entirely limestone, frequently crystallized,"], [537, "1840.] duke of York's island. 75 but it is rather remarkable that on three islets forming these harbours all the rocks near the beach are loose, and apparently disturbed by some violent action. In the main streams, sandstone, claystone, and porphyritic balls were found. The breeze, failing with an unpleasant swell setting on the islands, compelled us to warp as well as tow, and it was not until noon that we considered ourselves safe on our own element again. The breeze just favoured us in time to send our men to their dinner, for which they doubtless had good appetites, and our head was then directed for Duke of York's Island, which we reached the following afternoon. We were visited by several canoes bringing cocoa-nuts, bananas, pine apples, and several fruits unknown to us ; also some few shells, principally nautilus, (pompilius.) These were readily purchased for beads, but the natives were very timid and could not be persuaded to come on board. On the day following we ran along the north western side of New Ireland, in order to ascertain how far the natives were disposed to barter, and what they had to dispose of. Many canoes put off, and, after some solicitation, not only came alongside, but the natives ventured on board. Viewed in their canoes we thought them a tall race, but I was much surprised, on actual measurement as they were standing beside us, that the man I had selected as their stoutest and tallest did not exceed five feet seven, and was spare withal."], [538, "76 [1840. VISITS OF NATIVES. The canoes, which appeared for the most part to be new, are constructed from a hard white wood with a red core, (probably a mimosa.) They are very simple and neat, and furnished with the custo mary outriggers. They generally contained three or four persons. The largest, which was about fifty feet in length, contained eight. All those who came off in the canoes were male, and entirely naked, but the females, whom we discerned dancing and waving along the beach, were covered with the leekee of the Feejees and new Hebrides. The natives who ventured on board had each a single leaf stuck in their belts, but no more. As they brought nothing but cocoa-nuts and very small bread fruit, and were moreover very difficult to please, we very politely caused their departure, by slightly increasing our speed. I have little doubt that had we been able to anchor, stock, &c, would have been easily procured. The indentations of the coast appeared to offer several very snug little harbours, and judging from the numerous canoes as well as from the population we saw on the beach, added to large patches of cleared land, there can be little doubt that they have sufficient produce. Probably the distance at which we were from the land at the time they put off pre vented their risking live stock. On the day following, being a little further in advance, a large and handsomely finished canoe, with"], [539, "77 1840.] MOTHER AND DAUGHTER. the figure-head turned inwards, paid us a visit, but were too timid to communicate. Doubtless she con tained a chief, as those who managed her were silent, and did not even notice our advances to friendly communications. Our indisposition also to delay longer in this region of rains, calms, and variables did not induce us to make much repetition, although, so long from home, \" New Irish \" was a novelty in our ears. The season certainly was most unfortunate, as from the nature of the coast before us I could easily imagine the scenery in fine weather to be magnificent. The hills of New Ireland rise to a height of fifteen hundred to two thousand feet, and are clothed from base to summit with the most luxuriant forest. In the distance the high lands of New Britain, with the magnificent peaks of \" Mother and Daughter,\" afford a fine finish to the landscape. In a mercantile point of view I cannot at present perceive how these islands can prove interesting beyond the fancy woods and tortoise shell, of which latter substance every canoe appeared to possess several plates. It is of good quality, better than I have before noticed in the Pacific, and from the manner in which it was offered no doubt vessels come here to trade for it ; indeed we learnt as much from Tom Starling. It was unfortunate that such an opportunity for acquiring a more perfect estimate of these islands and their resources was completely marred, by the"], [540, "[1840. 78 BRITANNIA ISLANDS. dreadfully tedious weather and long sick list, which rendered further delay impossible. We continued making but little progress through torrents of rain, and pressed by the current about one mile per hour to the N.E. On the 23rd we passed Elizabeth Island, and saw part of Admiralty Group, and on the 24th, with fine weather, passed Purdy's Island, finding the current still pressing us to the northward. On the 25th of July, the group laid down on Arrowsmith's chart as the \" Six Islands,\" seen by the Britannia in 1795, were in sight, as well as several other low islands to the southward, which probably escaped notice, amounting in all to ten. At midnight the westernmost was discovered ahead, but at day-break, appeared to compose part of the main land of New Guinea. Two more low islands were also observed to the northward, and as my principal object was to select a spot free from basaltic or volcanic influence, these appeared to offer an eligible position. About the same time a deep bay was observed on the S.W. angle of what I now believed to be merely a penin sula, and my friend Kellett was immediately de spatched in the Starling, to examine it, in the event of failing to find safe anchorage amongst the low islands. On rounding the reefs which break the eastern swell, everything appeared to favour a convenient position. Lieutenant Wood was despatched to"], [541, "79 1840.] PORT VICTORIA. search for anchorage, but as no bottom under seventy or eighty fathoms could be obtained free from danger, and the Starling about the same time having signalled \" the port examined safe,\" our exertions were directed to reach it before dark. A constant current setting to the N.E., added to variable squally weather, prevented our reaching a position before nine o'clock, when we anchored near the Starling in twenty-five fathoms, mud. Kellett having anchored her at sunset, with orders to show a light, joined us to pilot us in. The morning (27th July) showed us a very snug and picturesque bay, but heavy rain prevented our landing until eleven, when a sandy spot on the north side of the bay was selected as most con venient, and commanded by the ship's guns. To prevent the chance of misunderstanding, a sufficient force was landed to put anything like opposition out of the question, and a space soon cleared for our tents. The natives, who met us, appeared rather ner vous, but very soon recovered their self-possession, and exhibited more good-humour than the accounts of previous navigators had led me to expect. They brought but little to traffic, and appeared to be impelled more by curiosity than any other motive, and, although the means were at hand, (by procur ing shells and other curiosities,) they could not be induced to exert themselves, probably fearing to go too far from their arms, which were no doubt con-"], [542, "80 [1840 COSTUME OF NATIVES. cealed in the bush. Their costume was entirely new to us ; resembling nothing we have seen. The hair, which is permitted to grow to a great length, is confined behind by a conical case, having the crown as its base, and generally tapering at eigh teen inches length to three at the point, the hair curling over. Into this preposterous appendage they stick their feather ornaments, either birds of paradise or canes with gaudy feathers of parrots or other birds neatly worked on, which add about eighteen inches to the length. They are gene rally in a state of nature, but in many cases, parti cularly the older people, have a dirty tapa about their loins. In stature they seldom reach the height of five feet four inches, and average about five feet. They are small-limbed, and did not ex hibit any symptoms of strength ; and from what we observed in their dealings, I am inclined to think them well-tempered. Their canoes are formed from single trees, with wash boards brought on very similar to others in these seas, but the fitting of the outrigger, and a seat amidships for the person in command, or to secure their goods from wetting, is very neat and convenient. It is a raised platform, about six feet by three, with ornamented sides, &c, about nine inches. Our attempts to discover what articles they prized, or would be tempted to barter for, were en tirely ineffectual : they preferred iron, axes, knives,"], [543, ""], [544, ""], [545, "1840.] 81 STRUCTURE OF CANOES. &c, despised beads, but evinced no particular de sire to possess anything shown to them. Latterly they brought some birds of paradise, but they were indifferent, and I am not aware what was given in exchange. The constant showers during the day prevented our obtaining the necessary data for determining our position. We were, therefore, compelled to trust to the stars, the weather generally proving clear between sunset and two a.m. By midnight we had completed our observations, and about one embarked. The natives retired about sunset. During the day the survey of the bay was com pleted. The depths throughout are regular, over a bottom of tough dark mud, varying from thirty to nine fathoms, which latter will be found close to the reefs, which in most places skirt the bay. Streams of fresh water abound ; that in the bight at the sandy beach is the best, and it probably runs at the dry season. On the south side of the bay a salt thermal spring was noticed, of which the tem perature appeared to be nearly at the boiling point ; it was, however, not strictly tested, our high tempera ture thermometer being broken. Wood is everywhere abundant at the water's edge. On the morning of the 28th we quitted this very snug bay, which (as the first discoveries of these islands called them Britannia group) I have thought fit to name \" Victoria Bay.\" This island is the eastern most of the group, and I have therefore called it VOL.

Britannia island, and the whole group \" the Britannia Archipelago.\" The day proving propitious, our survey was ex tended, by which we discovered that many points which we had mistaken for headlands, &c, lead ing into a large river, were the extremities of a series of islands forming a very extensive archi pelago. Eighteen were counted from the mast head, and I have little doubt that further examina tion to the southward would have materially in creased this number. The lateness of the season, and our immediate duty in this neighbourhood, not permitting further exploration, I was compelled very reluctantly to be sa tisfied in effecting only what the progress of our pas sage would allow ; and keeping within a short distance of t land, our head was again directed westerly.* In natural history our short stay afforded but trifling scope. Some interesting micoscropic shells were found in the mud at the anchorage, a few from the beach, and one new land shell. The geological composition of the island, as far as examined, proved to be jasper, but very much decomposed. The natives appear to take great pains in clearing and cultivating the land, and several brilliant green spots relieved the eye from the sameness of the. dull forest tint. Our botanical collector was as usual indefatigable.

We did not fairly accomplish our object until the morning of the 1st, when we commenced a track survey of the coast, with a light favourable air, which permitted us to range within one mile of the coast. About sunset we found ourselves off a very deep and extensive inlet, on the outer peninsula (or island) of which arose several very lofty and remarkable peaks, frequently hidden by clouds. Nothing of the kind is apparent on the charts, and the fact of our being some miles inland, by our latitude and longi tude, evinces how little we know of the geographical features of New Guinea. We were visited by many natives, from whom we purchased weapons, and other trifles. The day following enabled us to add little to the preceding, the currents having driven us, during the night, almost out of sight of some of our lofty marks. At noon we observed within one mile of the eastern most of three low islands, nine being then in sight : these were \" Los Crespos.\" By sunset we had reached the seventh, and tacked off shore for the night. The wind being light and variable ; we an chored between them in thirteen fathoms. Here I g 2"], [550, "[1840. 84 TRAFFIC. determined to remain, in order to fix their position, until noon, when we again moved westerly. We were visited by great numbers of natives in canoes from these islands, and so far from displaying fear or distrust, they were very anxious to persuade me to land. Had calm prevailed, I most certainly should have done so. The natives were decidedly superior to, and entirely different from, those of the Britannia group. The hair was worn loose, and in ringlets, some having the minute tails of Tanna. Each canoe was laden with bows, arrows, cocoa nuts, and plantains ; and several plates of tortoiseshell, which they freely exchanged for bits of iron hoop, beads, &c. ; but some large blue China beads, which I had, were singly worth anything offered in the market. One small blue bead was fixed as the price of a cocoa-nut. The canoes differ much from any we have noticed on this coast. They are neatly built, and short, and seldom contained more than three persons. The people were good-humoured, docile, and honest. Many birds of paradise, but tarnished, were worn as ornaments ; but not brought for barter. Tortoiseshell was sufficiently abundant to be worth trading for ; the plates good, and the demand about six inches of rusty useless hoop, for each plate. No females were seen. About noon the breeze favoured us, and having procured about three hundred cocoa-nuts, and sup plies of bananas, &c, and also pretty well filled the"], [551, "85 1840.] ISLAND OF ARIMOA. ship with ornaments, bows, arrows, &c, we weighed, and proceeded for Arimoa, then in sight to the N. N. E. From our dealings with these people, who were probably inhabitants of the neighbouring low islands, we have every reason to believe them friendly and well-disposed. They were evidently in fear, as the slightest noise would instantly cause them to paddle oft* in alarm. But no dispute oc curred in their dealings ; they were always well satisfied and good humoured, and invited us to land. Several cases of disease (apparently leprosy) were noticed, and many have lost noses, and have their features otherwise much disfigured. They chew the betel, with chunam ; smoke their native tobacco, and wear as ornaments the tusks of the wild boar. The septum of the nose is per forated, through which I noticed (and purchased) a bamboo ornament above one and a half inches in diameter. The lobes of the ears were similarly dis tended to two inches. They are expert divers, frequently catching things which fell overboard, (even beads,) and manage their canoes with great dexterity. A small canoe which I purchased was very neatly ornamented by carved figures at each end. The sail is an oblong mat, very similar to that in use throughout these seas \u2014 probably Malay. Their bows are very plain, and made of the outer part of the bamboo ; the arrows from a reed, about"], [552, "[1840. 86 NATIVES ALARMED. six feet in length, and ornamented by burning with a hot iron instrument. The string is also of rattan. The whole of the coast has, I believe, been visited by D'Urville. They are, without doubt, \" Los Crespos\" of the old charts, but the natives call the island which we anchored off, Yamna, which name I find is known at Arimoa. The following morning brought us close up with the islands of Arimoa, Moa, and Insu, or close under the south end of the southern Moa. The weather being hazy, with rain and little wind, prevented our effecting much of their delineation. Numerous canoes from Arimoa visited us, and for a short period trafficked without reserve. Iron hoop had fallen desperately in value, and nothing but knives or beads would succeed. The incautious appearance of a sentinel, with his musket, caused an immediate panic, which we were unable to dispel ; and, although compelled by calm to anchor close off their village, not a soul came off during the remainder of that day, although they remained in their canoes at a short distance in shore, laden with cocoa-nuts, bananas, &c. From the natives we learned that they acknow ledge the names on the charts, with the addition of the syllable too, as Arimoa-too, Insu-too, Moa-too, with a perceptible division of the too, as if it im plied island. The articles obtained from these people differed"], [553, "87 1840.] WEAPONS. from those of our Yamna friends, their bows being less finished, and arrows not so long. It appears that each tribe preserves an established length of this missile. As our distance from their village enabled us to see their huts and inhabitants very distinctly, by aid of our telescopes, we were able to make out that their houses are constructed similarly to those de scribed as customary amongst the natives of New Guinea, viz. the huts are constructed on platforms elevated on piles about ten or fifteen feet above the ground. A thatched pitched roof rises direct from, and overlaps, the platform, (similar to the attic of our pitched-roofed houses.) It is closed at the ends by a window, used also for the door, about three feet square. The ascent is by a ladder or notched post laid slanting to the window. The features and structure of this race differed from those of Yamna. They are more athletic, appear to possess more determination, as well as craftiness, and, probably from the fear of firearms, have had reason to repent some aggressions on a former visitor, or, equally probable, have been made to feel the blessings of communicating with white men who wished to drive their bargains vi et armis. We had no reason to wish for closer acquaintance by admitting them on board, and had this been permitted then it would certainly have been attended with great caution. They appeared as much afraid of a telescope as of firearms."], [554, "[1840 88 HABITATIONS. As their women and children were plentiful on the beach, they could have little idea of hostility ; and from this circumstance, I am inclined to sus pect them the injured instead of the aggressing party. We were afforded an opportunity of observing that the females are clothed similarly to those in the neighbouring islands, viz. by a matted fringe from the hips to the knees. Finding our neighbours still disposed to keep aloof, we warped to the edge of the reef, and with a light air cleared the island during the night ; but anchored a short distance to the westward, where we remained until after noon the day following, in order to effectually fix the position of the island. Our anchorage was in eleven fathoms, mud, twelve miles at least from the nearest land. From the point off which these islands are situated the coast appears to undergo an immediate change to a low swampy mangrove archipelago; the nu merous gaps being either the channels between them, or the mouths of large streams. The fact of many being islands was fully proved by observation, at their termination in the great northern gulf. I have little doubt also that large estuaries or rivers contribute to form the great mud flat which extends to such a distance from the land, as very strong currents were experienced, and many floating masses torn from the land (containing whole palm trees) indicated more than mere tidal action."], [555, "1840.] 89 FLOATING ISLANDS. On the afternoon of the 6th of August we moved with a light air and current from the eastward ; and the water continuing to decrease, hauled off, until we reached fifteen fathoms. Much to our astonish ment, several strange sail were reported, and they rapidly increased to a fleet, as we imagined, of canoes. Having, however, directed our course towards the nearest, we grazed it sufficiently to sweep our copper well, as it proved a large peat island, with a palm bush. Several sea-snakes were observed, differing from those generally noticed, and one taken in the trawl was preserved. A rare nondescript shell also taken. The openings in the coast became more numerous, and left little doubt that our pigmy fleet resulted from the islands abreast of us. The depth at eight or nine miles from the land being only nine fathoms, prevented our making any close examination of the coast, and at dark we dropped anchor for the night. In the morning we resumed our course, and succeeded in detaching several of the western group of islands, which at length showed us a passage be tween the westernmost, and what we assumed* to be the island of Jobie on the charts. Through this channel a strong tide set against us, compelling us again to drop anchor. Many canoes came off from the low islands near us, on which we could discern several villages, the houses, however, ex hibiting red roofs, which, from the material employed * Assumed, nothing like the chart."], [556, "90 CANOES AND WEAPONS OF NATIVES.

The natives of these islands were superior in fea tures, cleanliness, &c, to any who had yet visited us. Their canoes were better finished, thoir wea pons more numerous, and the numbers in each occasionally amounted to eighteen. They were furnished with double outriggers, and set their mat sail, sheer fashion, on a tripod, serving for stay as well as rigging : masts, therefore, they had not. Their arrows were invariably three feet in length, as if by law. The bows were rough, but strong and serviceable. They were not intimidated by firearms, excepting the first single canoe which visited us, pro- bably to report. They even came on board by the quarters without invitation, although they could not be persuaded to come alongside to traf- fic. This evinced some little knowledge of war tactics. We noticed that in their approach they observed a very ceremonious distance and pace in passing the broadside, but on completing the circuit as far as the quarter, pulled up for the stern. They were evidently aware of the use of the ports, as well as the destructive engines concealed within, and that the quarter was the weakest point. In their traffic they evinced more than usual knowledge of useful articles, and plainly intimated that knives or cloth must be the trading medium. We obtained but little from them in return, but"], [557, "1840.] 91 COSTUME OF NATIVES. bows, arrows, a few birds of paradise, and ba nanas. The head costume differs from those previously seen. The hair is well combed, and drawn through ornamented tubes of bamboo, about one inch and a half in diameter by four in length. In one instance a very fine well-featured lad, apparently a dandy in his way, had five of these ornaments, although they were seldom observed with more than two. A peculiar comb, like a toasting fork, having a pendant at its extremity, is stuck in the coronal tuft, and projects in front about two feet, standing*, when the body and head is erect, about ten inches above the line of the eyebrows. They were apparently under control of a chief who was present, though we could not ascertain which was he. They were very good-tempered, and anxious that we should visit their towns. In build, manners, &c, they were of a superior cast ; the features of some of them, particularly those from eighteen to twenty-five, being remarkably handsome, and of a light copper colour. The elders were fine healthy pleasant featured and vigorous men. Apparently, they were above cunning, and were quite independent in their manner. They have evidently been accustomed to visits from Europeans ; as they displayed iron, steel, and cloths, and perfectly comprehended that our colours were English. About two o'clock, the tide having changed, and"], [558, "92 [1840. ANCHOR OFF JOBIE. brought a breeze from S.E., we weighed, and steered through the passage between the western low island and Jobie, the water deepening as we entered the channel (which is about three miles wide) to thirty six fathoms. Having hauled to the westward for the night, we were visited by heavy rain, thunder, and lightning, which lasted until daylight, when I transferred my self to the Starling, in order to- seek for convenient anchorage, as well as a good position for rating the chronometers. Fortunately we picked up a very snug berth, in time to save our observations, and fixed upon a detached limestone clump, half a mile from the main island, completely adapted for our magnetic observations. The ship anchored within hail, in nineteen fathoms, tough clay. The size and detached position of our rock pre vented the chance of molestation from visitors, as not more than ourselves and instruments could find footing. The natives came off to the vicinity of our posi tion, but giving them to understand that we could not have any communication with them, they quietly retired to the nearest beach, apparently awaiting our pleasure. At sunset, finding that we still re mained in the same mood, they retired. The canoes of this party, w*hich I shall term \" state canoes,\" and which were probably only in tended for the inner waters, differed essentially"], [559, "' \u25a0/ <7f\" \\m/i? .- .7yy'0.r7^y \u25a0"], [560, ""], [561, "1840.] 93 STATE CANOES. from those seen the day before. These were of two kinds, one intended for extensive fishing, and with trifling ornament ; the other entirely state, and gor geously ornamented in sculpture at the stern, which was further decorated by plumes of birds of paradise. This latter had a kind of frame work, which could be immediately converted into a house, by mats there in readiness, and I am inclined to believe they generally sleep in them in preference to landing. We landed on the day following at the beach, where they had remained, and examined the woods in the immediate neighbourhood. We noticed several very peculiar piles of earth and leaves re sembling tumuli, but were unable to trace their purpose. Having completed our suite of observations, I determined, during our delay for rating the chrono meters, to take advantage of the interval to correct this almost unknown region, and with our reduced force, we commenced the survey. In the progress of this duty, which lasted about a week, and extended over eighty miles of longitude, we found the island which the natives pronounce Jobie, cut into deep creeks, and at twenty miles west of our rating position, formed into numerous harbours by a very extensive archipelago. In the interior, bays were observed, and several very large towns built on posts as before described, but much higher, and apparently so combined as to present a formidable defence to an attacking party. Many"], [562, "[1840 94 NATURAL HISTORY. of the interior spots were cultivated, and the plan tains and other trees we observed, showed them to be well supplied. Owing to their being warned oft* by a musket fired over them to prevent their stealing our marks, we had little or no communica tion with them, although several which visited the Starling at one of the out positions, gave them to understand that hogs, fruit, and the potatoe yam (of the Feejees) were abundant. Amongst the feathered tribe a very trifling addi tion was made to our collection, probably owing to our not having sufficient leisure to penetrate into the interior, but a very beautiful cream-coloured pigeon,* was very abundant. A very curious spe cies of a bat or flying fox, parroquets, &c, were in numerable, but difficult to obtain, as they main tained their perch on the loftiest trees, nearly on the summits of the island. Amongst the trees, several kinds of nutmeg were found, and these appear to abound on the main island, if we may judge from the roosting places of the pigeons, the ground beneath which was literally covered with the nuts which they had voided, as they merely feed on the outer fleshy covering. All the islands are thickly wooded, and afford excellent fuel. The Tamanu, ebony, and other hard cabinet woods, were noticed ; the lance wood of the South Seas (Casuarina equisetifolia) we 'cut for firewood, handspikes, and many useful purposes. * The nutmeg pigeon."], [563, "95 1840.] QUIT JOBIE. The reefs which generally belt these islands are well stocked with a great variety of shell-fish, some well worthy the attention of the naturalist. During our detention in this region, scarcely a day passed without a copious fall of rain, at times almost a deluge. The daily breezes were irregular, frequently from the south-west ; and the scud aloft generally travelled from that point. On the 16th August, having completed the rating of our chronometers, we recommenced our voyage, but were again teazed by our old enemies, calms, variables, and rain, which prevented our making more than twenty or thirty miles a-day. I fully expected that on clearing the high lands of Jobie, the customary trades, or sea-breezes, might reach us. In this we were disappointed, until passing what we took to be the island of Bultige. On the 21st we arrived at the termination of this group, forming a complete cluster of twenty-two small islets, rising from the same rocky flat, and pro bably at spring-tides nearly dry. As the Starling lost the breeze before reaching the passage, I deter mined on attempting a final suite of observations at these islands, but after landing and waiting a consi derable time, rain entirely frustrated our endeavours. It is a curious fact, that from the time of passing Yamna, until the present, not the slightest swell has been perceptible, the ripples on the weather sides of reefs not even endangering the bottoms of our light boats : a perfect still water has prevailed."], [564, "96 [I 8411. PASS GOELVINKS BAY. On the 22nd, we passed on the eastern side of Long Island of Maclure, our position by latitude and bearing of Mysory proving his survey relatively correct, but about thirty miles of longitude in error. Several deep indentations presented them selves in Long Island, and I have little doubt but good harbours would be found within ; but no traces of inhabitants were discernible, although Maclure places a village where we must have noticed it, had it at present existed. It is probably deserted. On the morning of 23rd the mainland of New Guinea was ahead, and with a light breeze we shaped our course for \" the Beehive,\" then in sight, hoping to reach Goelvinks Bay before sunset ; but with such imperfect charts, this could only be at a guess. At noon, our longitude placed us exactly at its entrance, but it was evident from our distance from the Beehive, that it was still at least twenty miles further to the westward. About four o'clock, we passed its probable situa tion, but as no convenient opening presented, and nothing which I could at all assimilate to the de scription of Goelvinks Bay, I passed on, hoping to meet with some favourable position. In this I was entirely disappointed, and therefore made up my mind to terminate my observations on this coast at the island of Amsterdam, its position having already been determined by chronometers from Point Pigot, as well as Amboyna."], [565, "97 1840.] ANCHOR AT AMSTERDAM. The features of New Guinea now resumed their bold outline, which failed about Yamna ; and \" Trees Cape,\" (which certainly deserves a better name, and was mistaken for Cape Good Hope,) was passed on the evening of the 24th. We then found that another low cape showed on the same bearing, which being more westerly, could be no other than Cape Good Hope. During our run along the last forty miles of coast, and not more than two miles from the shore, but three villages were noticed, and no disposition evinced to put off in their canoes. Indeed, but one or two natives were observed, the remainder, probably from fear, or employment, being absent in the mountains, from whence many columns of smoke were observed to issue. On the morning of the 23rd, we had neared the islands of Amsterdam and Middleburg, suffi ciently to proceed in the boats, the wind having nearly failed. We first directed our course towards the northern sandy point of Amsterdam, but on nearing it, found it to be dead low water, with a heavy surf setting on a rocky barrier, which pre vented access. Contrary, however, to the descrip tion, we found the soundings regular, as the bottom could be plainly traced from a cable's length from the breakers. On rounding the eastern end by the channel between the islands, we found safe and convenient landing on a clear sandy beach, within the eastern VOL. II. h"], [566, "[1840. 98 PERIODICAL RAIN point of Amsterdam. The channel between the islands is safe, and instead of seventeen or eighteen feet, read seventeen or eighteen fathoms. After completing a suite of magnetic as well as astronomical observations, and surveying the two islands, we bore up at sunset for Point Pigot, the evening terminating with thunder, lightning, and rain. We have observed, that in the mornings before sunrise all the outlines of the mountains and dis tant land are beautifully distinct and free from haze. As the sun rises, vapour is generated, and they become less distinct. By nine o'clock clouds form over the mountainous peaks, and shortly cap them ; thunder (which, by-the-bye, is almost in cessant) is distinctly heard. By four o'clock the clouds have accumulated into a dense black mass ; and from this time until eight p.m., they pour down their contents at intervals, with unsparing volume. About eight the clouds suddenly disperse, and the spangled arch is free even from scud. It is also a curious fact, that before the clouds exhibit any apparent discharge of rain, small white vapours resembling steam-clouds arise from the valleys and woods, and mingle with the black mass gathering above them, becoming more dense, and increasing in rapidity, as they approach near the clouds. This, doubtless, results from the sudden conden sation of the vapour arising from the earth, pre-"], [567, "1840.] 99 DESCRIPTION OF AMSTERDAM. viously heated by the sun's rays. Yet this latter phenomenon is more frequently observed, and in greater volume, after long continued rain, at the moment of clearing off, although no sun is visible. At New Ireland it was perpetual, and resembled smoke issuing from the forests. In these regions one may therefore calculate on a sound drenching once every twenty-four hours, if within twenty miles of high land. Nothing- of interest occurred at these islands. They are mere coral patches, having about ten feet soil above the sea level, and are well clothed with tall trees, similar to the main island. The natives came off in their canoes to the Starling, and one uncouth Noah's ark went off to the ship, but did not communicate. In the account of these islands, they are described as two low flat islands surrounded by a reef, and about two or two and a half leagues from the coast ; the reef projecting from Amsterdam, \" steep to,\" having fifty fathoms near, and four or five feet on it in some places. From our examination it will appear that these islands are distinctly separate, the depth between them ranging gradually from five to thirty-five fathoms mid channel ; that the soundings approach ing them are regular from one hundred fathoms from the reef; and that in a south-east direction from the eastern sandy point of Amsterdam, good tough holding ground, in mud, may be found from twenty H 2"], [568, "[1840. 100 dampier's strait. to thirty fathoms. The Starling anchored in twenty eight fathoms mud, 2',7 miles from the point. The inner point of Middleburg is more than two miles from the coast. Wood for fuel is plentiful, and tamanu of large size overhangs the water. On the morning of the 26th, we found ourselves at the mouth of Dampier's Strait, but the breeze prov ing light, did not succeed in getting abreast of Point Pigot before eight in the evening. Our noon position showed the charts to be defective, the whole eastern side of Waygiou forming a deep and extensive bay, and our latitude being much to the southward of Point Pigot, although its island bore to the southward of west from us. With respect to the current also, we were much disap pointed, not having experienced its action during the whole day. We noticed an extensive line of sand banks between Point Pigot and the south-eastern point of Waygiou, which, although of interest to the sur veyor, are too close in to cause uneasiness to the navigator. About eight p. m., we took a fine breeze from S. S. E., which helped us for a few hours, carry ing us past the islands off Cape Pigot. At four in the morning we found ourselves close to two low islands, and as I conjectured them to be the \" Foul Islands,\" the ship was tacked until daylight, when my suspicions were confirmed. We had no sound-"], [569, "1840.] 101 LAND on pigeon island. ings, with one hundred fathoms, but could hear the surf sound very distinctly. The line of current was now very distinctly apparent on the surface, and with a light air from south-east, we edged over for Pigeon Island, for the purpose of fixing one decided position in this strait, as well as to obtain the exact time of high water ; this being the change of the moon. The stream anchor was dropped, and means taken to avail ourselves of every advantage during our necessary delay. Our observations having been completed, and a rough survey made, we embarked about three, when the anchor was weighed, but the flood-tide having made too strong for the breeze, compelled us to anchor again until slack water. Our observations disagree very materially with the charts. The relative position of the islands is also very erroneous, our rough survey having narrowed the channel several miles. Pigeon Island is a mere strip of land, surrounded by a coral ledge. Landing is easily effected at half tide, on the S.W. point : but at low water, springs, the waterline shows a steep coral belt, having some inches water within, over sand and coral, for a cable's length. The island is pretty well wooded, the whole of the S.W. point alluded to abounds with theCasuarina equi setifolia, or Ito of Sandwich Islands, Tahiti, &c, or commonly termed \"iron-wood.\" It is difficult to cut when of large growth, and dry ; but in its green"], [570, "102 [1840.

It forms excellent fuel, and does not ferment in the hold, an evil to be cautiously avoided in tropical regions : I strongly suspect the mangrove, and I placed great faith in keeping my ship clear from fever on the coast of Africa, by never admitting green wood, or that with the bark moist. We found it low water precisely at noon, and from the rapidity with which the tide flowed, as well as the current slackening off, I presume that it was high water about six p. m. At ten the breeze en abled us to weigh, and after our usual dose of rain, and et ceteras, we cleared the straits in the morning. During our detention we were visited by several canoes, and one state canoe, having on board a per son styling himself Captain of Gibbie, probably the island of Geby, or Ghibi, of the charts. He was well attired in oriental costume, spoke English tole rably, and informed us that in one moon, many ships of several nations would visit his island. He was very anxious that the ship should proceed there, where she would obtain supplies of vegetables and fruit. During my conversation with this individual, I was rather surprised to hear him designate his people Papoos, and upon my questioning him whether they belonged to New Guinea, he explained that the lower order of Ghibi, Battanta, and others, were designated Papoos, but which had no connexion with the \" Great Island\" of New Guinea. I have since been informed that they are of the same race."], [571, ""], [572, ""], [573, "1840.] 103 DESCRIPTION OF GEBY PRAHU, The vessel in which this person came was one of the regularly built prahus, or prau, (not a canoe,) but furnished with outriggers, and stages for those working the oars. She carried banners, and assumed some little state. Her stem was precisely in the Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian style \u2014 rising high, with a nob. We had some difficulty, at first, in dealing with this person, who was either unwilling to trade, or waiting for a present. We succeeded in obtaining several very handsome lories alive, and a few birds of paradise, mats, &c. He did not consider the fine season as set in until next moon. His \" fine sea son\" probably reckoned by the number of whale-ships and visitors who take this route in the S.W. monsoon. A fine breeze led us up to the island of Pulo Popa, which we cleared after a short tack. The Full and Change, hitherto, has been attended with rain and unsettled weather at this season, which the last twenty-four hours has fully corroborated. On the morning of the 28th August, as the rain cleared off, we found ourselves close off the coast of Ceram. Nothing could surpass the beauty of the scenery, and now, for the first time for many months, we beheld clear spots of park land, studded with a moderate proportion of trees. Of late nothing but the sombre sameness of dingy forest had met the eye, and grada tion of shade, betwixt hill and ravine, afforded the only variation in the landscape. Here we had not only the varied yellow, brown, or green, of the clear lands or meadows, but every other forest tint ; above"], [574, "[1840. 104 PASS ISLAND OF CERAM. which beetling peaks, with their white weather-worn lines, occasionally peeped through the misty clouds, which but a few hours since had entirely eclipsed them, and shortly floated over their summits, merely to add fresh spirit to the scenery by their shadows. There is something more than ordinarily interesting in the rapid changes of scenery which the seaman witnesses ; point after point opening and displaying bays, harbours, huts, natives, &c. We had now, however, arrived within the range of civilization, and the sight of a vessel was an occur rence too ordinary to cause any of the natives to visit us in their canoes. Having reached within two miles of the beach, we took the fresh trade, or pro bably sea-breeze, which by sunset carried us well clear of the Island of Ceram, (pronounced Cee-ram.) As it was important to reach the nearest port, in order to save the meridian distance, I determined to stand on for Cajeli Bay, Bouro, and therefore signalled the Starling \" to make the best of her way to Amboina,\" where she would prepare the governor for my arrival, and remove the difficulty of obtaining immediate observations. At daylight we were well in with the island of Bouro, but too far to the southward. Horsburgh's directions are not sufficiently explicit for finding Cajeli Bay. He should have explained that \" Mother and Daughter,\" (the latter might have been omitted, as only seen when well into the depth of the bay,) are two very high conical hills inland, which from"], [575, "105 1840.] MOTHER AND DAUGHTER. the sea appear as one. The eastern side is streaked white, by reason of its bare rocks. It lies on the S.E. side of the depth of Cajeli Bay, and is an excellent mark for rounding the eastern head, from the S. E. As long as its head can be seen above the trees at the eastern point, the ship will be perfectly clear of danger. The instant it begins to rise, after passing the point, a course may be shaped for the north point, which apparently shows as the left of an island on the N.W. shore. When mid-channel, steer with the town off the larboard cathead, until Mother bears S. E. by S. Then steer south for the fort ; shorten sail about one mile from it, and anchor at the first cast twenty-five, bottom mud, and good holding ground. The limit of danger, westerly, is the two eastern turrets of the fort in line. We found soundings in every part of the bay, both going in and coming out ; on the latter occasion, it never exceeded fifty fathoms, until we hauled up E.N.E.

CHAPTER IV. About four o'clock on the 1st of September, hav ing completed our observations, we quitted Cajeli Bay for Amboina. The current at ebb sets very strong to the southward, so that, by keeping in the strength of the stream during the night, we found ourselves well to windward of the island of Amblau by daylight. At dawn on the 3rd, we were close off Noessaniva Point, and, favoured with a light easterly breeze, we soon rejoined the Starling, and found two Dutch Company's brigs at anchor within. We dropped anchor close to the westernmost, in twenty fathoms. It is customary to run the stream cable to the shore, in case of strong puffs off shore, and for this purpose, heavy anchors are already laid down, to which cables can be attached at low water. Accompanied by my friend Kellett, I proceeded immediately to call on the governor of the Moluc cas, Colonel de Stuers, who resides at a very de lightful spot about half a mile from the town. My reception was highly flattering, and was immediately"], [579, "109 1840.] ANCHOR at amboina. followed by permission to place my observatory where I pleased, and the requisite orders were im mediately issued. After examining the governor's magnificent collection of shells, insects, and other objects of natural history, we took our leave until the dinner hour. The position selected for our observations was on the S.W. angle of the curtain of Fort Victoria, where a summer house, constructed for taking tea and smoking, very conveniently afforded shelter, with out the trouble of erecting tents. Occasionally the passing of the natives jarred the ground slightly; but whether by the order of his excellency, or a proper consideration on the part of the officers, we were entirely free from visitors during the progress of our observations. Those not interested in or comprehending such duties, cannot but feel that we are unwelcome guests whilst we are thus en gaged. The inattention to questions, and the per fect abstraction necessary for a portion of time, must appear almost as a slight on their intended courtesy. Yet, if they could but comprehend the value we attach to time, they would clearly feel the pro priety of allowing us to enjoy our hermitage. At six the Governor sent his carriage for us, and we repaired to his beautiful retirement, where we were introduced to Madame de Stuers. Once more we congratulated ourselves on regaining society, from which, excepting a few short moments at Tepic, Sitka, and Lima, we had been almost excluded since 1836."], [580, "110 [1840. GOVERNOR OF THE MOLUCCAS. The governor and Madame both speak English well, and were unremitting in their polite attentions. They are both strongly imbued with the taste for natural history, and appear to enjoy perfect happi ness, even in this distant region, by constant applica tion to rational pursuits. They have a fine healthy and beautiful family, consisting of three boys and three girls, the eldest boy being about ten years old. Madame is the daughter of General de Kock, now minister of the interior in Holland, and formerly governor-general at Java, where I believe madame was born. It is, therefore, surprising that she does not, according to the custom of India, give way to the habit of consuming the greater part of the day in the siesta, which I believe to be very enervating. Activity appears to be their motto, and blooming health results. On their passage hither in a steamer they were wrecked upon the Turtle Islands, near Goonong Apee, not more than a hundred and twenty miles from their destination. There they experienced great hardships, and probably would have perished, had not one of the boats reached Timor or Java, and brought them assistance. Another boat fell into the hands of the pirates, but the crew were eventually recovered by ransom. At the period of our visit the rajahs from the neighbouring islands had assembled at Amboina, to try their disputes, for which purpose the governor presides in court twice in the year. The court is"], [581, "111 1840.] COURT OF RAJAHS. composed of the president, assisted by twenty-four rajahs ; the cause is heard before them, and the law explained, so that the award is nearly the act of their own body. I was informed that it is a very tedious operation to make them understand the law, or be convinced (probably against their will) of its infallibility. After the third day, on which the business terminated, the governor, according to cus tom, gave the rajahs an entertainment, to which my officers and self were invited. I fully expected to have seen all the rajahs in splendid costumes, but the greater part of them were dressed as Europeans, and had nothing in particular to distinguish them from the general residents. After dinner their healths were drunk, and \" success to their clove planta tions.\" The governor was kind enough to make a party the following morning to visit a cavern in the moun tains, as well as afford us a sample of the style in which he travels in these regions. At six o'clock his carriage conveyed us to his house, where a host of natives with open palanquins were assembled. During the delay of taking coffee, a band of seven grotesquely dressed men, with swords and shields, birds'-head helmets, adorned with the feathers of the cock, or birds of paradise, (very much in the merry-andrew style observed at our fairs in Eng land,) danced to the sound of a drum and gong, keeping excellent time, and imitating the attack and defence of war parties; intimating that your ad-"], [582, "112 [1840. VISIT THE CAVERN. vance was opposed until their ceremony or mode of salute was complete. Having mounted our palanquins, to each of which twelve bearers were appointed, the band and dancers, preceded by two Dutch ensigns, led the way. Our journey lay over very slippery ground, it having rained hard all the preceding night, and some of the steeps were so very rugged, that one could with difficulty keep his seat in the palanquin. Some of the party got out and walked, an example which I felt much inclined to follow, but as the governor remained seated, I considered it etiquette to main tain my state, even at the risk of my bones. At every hundred yards, or probably at such intervals as the leader of the band considered the bearers out of wind, the dancing guard obstructed our progress until their fantastic ceremony was complete. We enjoyed several very beautiful prospects from the heights, which probably would have been still more brilliant had the sun favoured us. But we could well spare his presence, and enjoyed the cool fresh air resulting from the late showers infinitely more than the steam heat which his rays would in evitably have produced. About half-past seven we reached the mouth of the cavern, which the rajah of the district had already prepared for our entry, by a range of stakes forming steps down the first steep descent. The depth was not great, nor from the nature of the 10"], [583, "1840.] 113 VISIT CAVE. soil was there much stalactitic concretion. Bats were numerous, as well as crustaceous spiders, and crickets of a curious kind. The swallows which construct the nidi esculenti, or edible birds' nests, were here uninterrupted. I obtained one, however, as a specimen, but it had but little of the glutinous matter with which it is attached to the sides or roof of the cavern. At the extremity of the cave we found a marble tablet noting the visit of Captain D'Urville, commanding the expedition of the Astro labe and Zelee, which was placed there by the fiscal or chief magistrate. Our return was much in the same style ; when, hav ing breakfasted at the governor's, we returned to the ship. In the evening we rejoined the governor's party at a ball, where we saw all the youth and beauty of the colony, and waltzing and quadrilles were main tained with great spirit until a late hour. With the exception of four or five, all the young ladies were born of native mothers, or of native extraction, in the colony. Of the whole collection not an or dinary face was visible ; all were pretty, several very handsome. The attentions of our kind host and hostess were unremitting. Indeed, from the moment of arrival until we took our final leave, hardly an hour elapsed without increasing our debt of gratitude. All our establishment have felt the kindness of our warm hearted friends at Amboina, and I am satisfied will VOL. II. j"], [584, "114 [184ft FISHING TRAMMELS. not easily forget them. Deprived of society for such a period, it has been to us quite a paradise. The roads in the neighbourhood of the town are in admirable order, and afford several very pleasant rides. I accompanied the governor to examine one of their fishing trammels at his sea-side cottage which is situated about two miles from the fort. The manner of construction is ingenious. Stakes are driven into the ground in the figure of a broad arrow, the barbs incurved to half their length. The apex is formed similar to a mouse-trap. This is surmounted by three others ; that outside being the preserve. All the barbs are fitted with hinges, by which the angular aperture can be closed at the plea sure of the person on watch, who generally lives on the stage in \"Jack-straw's house.\" The outer preserve is generally in three fathoms water, and the upper frame-work weighted with stones to prevent its rising. All the walls are even, constructed of slight bamboo, with half-inch openings. To take the fish, the outer doors are all secured ; a diver descends with a landing net, and first frightens the fish from the bottom. Then looking upwards, as his buoyancy causes him to ascend easily, he dexterously uses his net to take those at the surface, which are completely bewildered. The horses in use here are small, but well-limbed, and very strong. The governor was kind enough to send his carriage for us on all occasions, and"], [585, "1840.] 115 CHINESE POPULATION. although the little animals were not taller than Scotch ponies, they carried four inside and three servants outside at a rapid rate. The town of Amboina contains a large number of Chinese, who reside principally in the western quar ter, where a very large and well stocked market furnishes most of the luxuries as well as the neces saries of this climate. The race, however, do not appear to maintain the high character they have for industry in other parts of the world ; possibly the laws restrain them from indulging in such specula tions as they would prefer. I was rather disap pointed, therefore, in not finding their shops well stored, forgetting their limited communication with their own country. Amboina is garrisoned by companies, partly Dutch partly Malay, commanded by a lieutenant-colonel, who keeps them actively drilled every morning at six, and frequently in the evenings. Their appear ance speaks for their health. In the evening the officers amuse themselves at the club with billiards, cards, &c. They are required to serve a certain number of years before they are entitled to a pension, and no officer is permitted to marry, unless he can give security that himself and his intended possess enough to maintain them respectably. The brig of war mounts twenty thirty-two pounders, upon very small tonnage, but appears to be kept in very creditable kelter.

Our officers received much attention from the army and navy ; indeed, from the governor downwards we were to all deeply indebted. The governor having accepted an invitation to a second breakfast, accompanied me in my gig, in full uniform ; the Starling having been ordered to hoist the Dutch national colours, fired the necessary salutes to the flag, as well as personal salute. His own state barge, however, was in waiting, a splendid kind of \" city barge,\" manned by Malays, and decorated with three large Dutch ensigns. The lieutenant colonel, chief magistrate, suite, &c, came off in her. Owing to the tie of observations, chronometers, &c, I was unable to spare time to visit the clove gardens, or make any protracted excursion into the country, which was several times proposed by my kind friend, the governor. The nutmeg trees are very com mon, and produce abundantly, but the fruit is inferior to that of Banda, not yielding the same quantity of oil, which in the Chinese market is important. The natives manufacture various ornamental articles, as work-boxes, urns, prahus, &c, from the clove; and the native-born young ladies occupy their leisure hours in making fancy flowers from the feathers of the numerous parroquets, lories, and other gaudy plumaged birds with which these islands abound. Amboina, although not yielding plentifully from its"], [587, "117 1840.] NECK OF LAND. own harbour, is the nucleus where the shells from the Moluccas are usually assembled, and where they generally find a good market. The islands of Ceram and Goram appear to contribute not only largely, but also the greater number of rare shells. The island of Amboina itself presents one of na ture's freaks, being almost divided at its northern end. At one period the Dutch attempted to cut a passage through, and in part succeeded. This has been partially filled up, although I am given to understand that at present the large prahus are floated and carried across, so as to prevent the necessity of going out by Noessaniva, when bound to Ceram. The Dutch maintain their sway over the island of Ceram ; have forts established on it ; and by the ceremony before alluded to, viz. the biennial visit to decide their legal differences before the governor at Amboina, the natives distinctly acknowledge their su premacy. Gillolo, Ternate, and Tidore, are subject to the Sultan of Tidore, who, I am given to understand, is in turn, either subject to, or under more than close alliance with, the Dutch government. All these islands, including the Banda group, Manada, (on Celebes,) Mindanao, Oby Major, and a few settle ments on the shores of New Guinea, are under the authority and surveillance of the governor of the Molluccas, who usually makes his annual tour of inspection, when I understand he is well received. Indeed, we ourselves witnessed the attachment ex pressed by those assembled here."], [588, "[1840. 118 SAGO TREE. According to custom in all semi-civilized nations, wherever food is spontaneously produced, there is but little disposition to labour. The sago-tree, which at Amboina, Bouro, Ceram, and adjacent islands, grows must luxuriantly and attains a large size, (eighteen inches diameter,) is calculated to sub sist a family for one month, or even six weeks. The tree being felled, is secured in a horizontal position, and an opening being cut on its upper surface, the centre, which is about eight-tenths of the capacity, is scooped out as required. Plantations, gardens, &c, flourish ; and nothing but the desire of gain, or of being in a condition to assume the European garb, can excite the natives to labour. The cultivation of the patches awarded by government is kept up by a kind of tax on tenure, and these are guaranteed by responsible rajahs. Amongst the many presents constantly arriving from my kind friend, I cannot omit to mention that important addition to our zoological collection, the Babyroussa hog ; which, from its docility and hav ing been reared from young, promised to see Eng land safe ; unless indeed poisoned by eating anything that fell in his way amongst his epicurean re searches. Six lories, and as many marine's shoulder and cap scales, (of brass,) did not in the least impede digestion. He eventually reached England, and I believe is now happy in the Zoological Gardens. Having completed our necessary refit, &c, we took leave of our kind friends at Amboina on the"], [589, "1840.] 119 REVISIT BOURO. 13th of September, and directed our course for Bouro, to take a fresh departure, as well as obtain a sea-rate for our chronometers from our absolute meridian. I was anxious also to examine the dan gers of Cajeli Bay, and either dispel them, or put them into some tangible form on paper. On the night following (about two A. M.) I an chored in the bay, much to the surprise of our Dutch friend \" the resident,\" (a clerk,) who I believe thought us little better than mad. During the in terval occupied in obtaining our necessary observa tions, a fair survey of the bay was completed, cer tainly outlining the important danger line, to vessels wishing to visit the bay. On the 16th we quitted Cajeli Bay, and hauled to the southward, in prefer ence to risking the calms which generally prevail at this season on the northern or lee side of Bouro.* Bouro, or Cajeli Bay, possesses great advantages over Amboina, as regards supplies of poultry, eggs, water, and wood. The harbour also is snug and safe, sheltered from the monsoons, and less troubled with the diurnal rains of Amboina, consequently better adapted for casual refit, as well as astronomical observations. As regards natural history also, it af fords a wider field, particularly in conchology. The famed Babyroussa hog abounds on this island, al though very difficult to obtain. Deer are plentiful in the interior, and birds unknown to the Dutch residents are frequently spoken of by the natives. * Also spelt Boeroa."], [590, "[1840. 120 CAJEPUT OIL. A great variety of very beautiful woods, adapted for cabinet purposes, are also plentiful, including perhaps the most valuable ebony of these seas. I was informed, however, at Amboina, that the ports of Ceram completely eclipse Cajeli Bay in point of natural history, and the fancy woods gene rally. The Cajeput oil, I believe, is principally obtained from this island, and sent to Amboina. That ob tained here was superior to any offered for sale at the latter.* The morning after our departure from Bouro found us well to the southward, aided by the pre vailing currents, now nearly at the springs. Our hopes of a speedy passage were, however, baffled by light airs ; and dreading calms in the Boreton pas sage, I determined on hauling to the southward of the group of Token Bessy, sighting Velthoen, and cor recting, if necessary, the positions of any of the islands. On the 21st of September we passed Velthoens, after having been somewhat puzzled at the islands which surrounded us. Unfortunately the weather was too hazy to test Velthoens, but the next day at noon, satisfied me that some of them should take a more northerly place on the chart. We passed through very strong ripples and overfalls, but could not obtain soundings. From the 17th until the 20th, a heavy misty /\u25a0 * It has the faculty of rendering paper transparent or opaque at pleasure."], [591, "1840.] 121 PASS BOELE COMBA. oppressive atmosphere surrounded us, preventing our effecting any of the objects which I had contem plated on pursuing this course. On the night of the 19th of September we had the misfortune to lose our gunner (Mr. W. Holder) from dysentery contracted at Tahiti, and which had obstinately hung upon him since. He was an old shipmate of mine (as a boy) in 1819, was deservedly a favourite with every one, and much regretted as a public loss. Having cleared the Token Bessy group, a course was steered to sight the Tiger Islands, situated to S.E. of the island of Salayer. At noon on the 20th of September we were within four miles of the position assigned to the easternmost, and before sunset had run over two more without the slightest indication of land. They are therefore justly placed \"doubtful\" on the charts. Had our position at noon admitted of doubt, I might have been in clined to attribute something to current, but this was out of the question on the course steered, as we reached the mouth of Salayer Strait by daylight, experiencing a north-westerly current. Indeed, at dawn we found we had been literally driven through the strait by the current, then setting west. About eight on the 24th of September, we per ceived the Dutch colours flying on the fort at Boele Comba, (on the southern coast of Celebes,) and as this position might assist vessels in correcting their longitudes, I despatched the Starling to secure its"], [592, "[1840. 122 ANCHOR AT MACASSAR. position, make a rough survey of the road, and rejoin me at Macassar. Pursuing our course westerly, we passed the Bay of Bonthian, (celebrated for the unhandsome treat ment of poor Carteret,) rounded point Layken by sunset, and shaping our course between Celebes and the island of Tanakeke, passed through this strait about eight o'clock, when we anchored for the night in eighteen fathoms. On weighing at dawn, we found we had far overshot our distance. About ten o'clock we discerned a Dutch frigate, and the forts and town of Macassar; but as the plans supplied differed by exactly double their scales, I deemed it prudent to incur expense rather than risk her Majesty's ship. I therefore made the signal for a pilot, but as he was long in getting out, we found ourselves within the harbour, and at an chor, before he reached us. The frigate we found to be the Rotterdam, her captain having immediately despatched one of his officers with offers of assistance, and to pay the cus tomary compliments. The visit I returned without delay, and accompanied her captain to pay my re spects to the governor. The customary ceremonies over, and the necessary sanction obtained, our ob servatory was pitched nearly on the spot occupied by the French expedition in the Astrolabe and Zelee. From the imperfect state of the charts, I deemed it necessary to make the most of our detention, by resurveying the dangers, channels, &c, on the ap proach to this anchorage."], [593, "1840.] 123 DUTCH FRIGATE ROTTERDAM. On the day following I accepted an invitation to a parting dinner given to the captain and officers of the Rotterdam, which passed off pleasantly, by dancing until midnight. Our labours having ter minated on the 30th, we took our departure on the 1st of October for Great Solombo and Singapore ; the Rotterdam having sailed on the 29th for Ba tavia. The civilities offered to myself and officers at this port left no weight of obligation on our minds. With the exception of the chief magistrate, who of fered me every assistance, I had no acquaintance. The fort of Macassar stands on the S.W. angle of the town, disconnected by a ditch and high ram part, within the walls of which reside the military, amounting in all to about three hundred, inclusive of a squadron of cavalry. The town, which is walled, is very regularly built, extending about one quarter of a mile by half a mile on its squares, and having three gates on its southern face, which are closed at nine o'clock. The Chinese appear to constitute the majority of the population within the town ; but the huts of the natives extend considerably to the northward, and appear to be very thickly inhabited. All the coast line displays a large proportion of population, and the small islands also are not deficient in this respect. They are probably fishermen. Indeed the approaches from seaward afford very strong testi mony to the piscatory pursuits of the natives ; their"], [594, "[1840. 124 NATIVES OF CELLEBES. beacons, which were frequently found in sixteen and seventeen fathoms, inducing a belief in shoal water, and thus causing an alteration of our course to thread them. The canoes are also very numerous. Although the Dutch have so long held possession of Macassar, their position does not appear free from alarm, the natives not unfrequently giving them cause for vigilance. We had frequent opportunities of noticing the variety of castes, which generally loitered about the observatory, in their passage through the fort. In some instances, the higher NATIVE OF BUGIS. classes were very superior in figure, attitude, car- riage, and complexion. The lower orders, on the"], [595, "<> Z SS-' W\u00bbZ<^Z/ /\u2022S^S^ks' ."], [596, ""], [597, ""], [598, ""], [599, "1840.] 125 POSITION OF MACASSAR. contrary, are generally undersized, ill-looking, moody, and might easily have been stirred into brutality. Even the higher grades assumed a sulky, suspicious air, which was anything but prepossessing, and they appeared at all times ready for mischief. But I never failed in making them throw off their ill-humour when I wished to communicate. They were even excessively polite in their manner. None go unarmed; generally they carry the kris, and those of rank are followed by an attendant with a silver-mounted hunting-spear. Their costume is Arabic, their religion Mahomedan. The port appears to possess an extensive coasting trade, if one may judge from the numerous large prahus at anchor and on the move ; but I am informed that their exports will not cover the specie they require for the purchase of European commodities. The position of Macassar is reckoned particularly salubrious. The atmosphere is very dry, and, unlike any of the positions we have lately visited, we found it entirely free from rain during our visit. I am told that it seldom rains, and is very similar to the climate of Lima. Nevertheless the horizon and atmosphere on the mountains is very hazy. The sea-breeze generally sets in regularly about ten o'clock, commencing from the southward, and veers to the westward before sunset, when it fails? and is succeeded about ten o'clock by a cool land breeze. The thermometer ranged during our visit from 74\u00b0 to 94\u00b0. Stock is plentiful and reasonable,"], [600, "126 [1840.

Quitting Macassar, our course was directed to pass to the northward of the Northern Brother, crossing the Tanakeke ledge, on which the chart gives nothing less than nine fathoms. About eight p. M., in heavy ripplings, we shoaled to four and a half fathoms, when we tacked, and stood to the eastward, anchoring in five fathoms. The current set very strong to the W.N.W., and the boats sent to sound, reporting nothing under four, we again tripped, and shortly deepened to thirteen fathoms, By daylight this would have been of little import ance, but the dangers of the region being almost unknown, and heavy overfalls surrounding us, our situation was anything but pleasant. On the 3rd of October, we made the island of Solombo, but were unable to reach our anchorage"], [601, "127 1840.] FRESH WATER LAKE. before dark. After rounding the S.W. angle, and coming suddenly into eight fathoms, I hauled to the southward, to determine the range of soundings, and gradually edged in, letting go our anchor in ten fa thoms. Daylight showed that our usual good fortune attended us, as had we stood on half a mile further, we certainly would have been too near to be pleasant. In the morning we succeeded in landing, to save the astronomical observations for time, and having obtained our suite of magnetic observations, I found the officers, with their boat's crews, engaged hunting wild buffalo. The reports of muskets were fre quent, but, although one was badly wounded, our sportsmen did not reward us by the sight of a car cass. Up a small valley near the southern point, our men noticed a small fresh-water lake, appa rently staked, which would lead one to infer that there were natives or sojourners concealed. How ever, we did not perceive even a trace of a footstep on the sands, nor anything resembling habitations or their ruins. The mysterious piles, indicating the work of human beings, as noticed in every island within the New Guinea range, were numerous. The composition of the island appears to be vol canic, belted, as usual, by compact coral limestone, through which the black amygdaloidal rocks pro trude. The island is well wooded, and has a crowned elevation with two cones (about three hundred feet above the sea level) near its southern extremity. Landing is easily effected at high water,"], [602, "128 [1840. ANCHOR AT PULO KUMPAL. but not without wet feet or even wading, nearer than half a mile from our place of observation, at low water. It is probable that better landing may be found in the bay immediately within the south point, but neither time nor duties admitted of de termining this question, or even how far it might be practicable to water. We were released by the flowing tide, just before sunset, and having com pleted our observations, weighed and pursued our voyage, steering for the Mancap shoals off the south west extremity of the island of Borneo, hoping to be able to meet with some position for a magnetic station in that neighbourhood. On the morning of the 7 th of October, we rounded the shoals of Pulo Mancap, but being then in seven fathoms, and no island near, I determined on running for Pulo Kumpal, (Rendezvous Island ;) and with a favourable breeze reached the anchorage within one mile of the point selected for observing, by noon. This is considerably nearer as well as much safer anchorage than the charts admit. The Starling afterwards took up her position within one eighth of a mile, but had rocky bottom. No time was lost in selecting our position and landing our instruments, nor did the island offer any inducement to expend time in making any very critical examination, beyond the composition of our immediate location, (as regarded magnetic disturb ance,) which was found to be a mixture of contorted slaty and sandy schistus, traversed by veins of quartz,"], [603, "129 1840.] PASS ISLAND OF CARIMATA. the general mass having apparently undergone vol canic action. It had not the slightest effect on the needles, although the slaggy edges apparently offered traces of iron. Having completed our observations, and a simple survey of the anchorage and outlines of the neigh bouring islands, we took our departure at sunset, October 8th, shaping our course for the Carimata group. Light variable winds prevailed. On the 9th, we passed the southern Carimata. On the 14th, made Bintang, and about eight p. m., on the 15th, passed to the northward of Pedro Branca, where, the wind and tide proving adverse, we dropped anchor until daylight, when we resumed our course for Singapore, and reached that port about nine a. m. on the 16th. Having been visited by the master at tendant, I called on the governor, Mr. Bonham, who was excessively civil ; and as our observations and occupations did not admit of disturbance, he allotted me the recorder's house, where Captain D'Urville had preceded me. From the utter improbability of our touching at this port on our homeward voyage, I had not the most remoteidea of meeting with despatches or letters. To my surprise, however, several official letters were presented to me ; and this surprise was not a little increased by one from their lordships, directing me \"immediately to retrace my steps and join the commander-in-chief in China.\" Orders, it appeared, had been transmitted to San Bias, via Mexico, di- VOL.

I hardly know whether I am safe in saying that pleasure or disappointment prevailed. To those reduced to their last shreds by a five years' absence, I presume that the hopes of home predominated. However, for myself, I could not but feel the com pliment intended, and the importance of straining every nerve to satisfy my patrons that, although late in the field, I would do my best. This induced me to put up with many inconveniences, in order to get my ship to sea : but with all our exertions, caulking, refitting, and provisioning, we did not succeed in moving until daylight of the 23rd of October. The botanical collector of seeds from Kew, con ceiving himself out of his sphere in our prospective cruize, requested permission to return to England with his collection. Several invalids were also sent away, whose constitutions could not stand further exposure, as also our Epicurean friend the Baby roussa hog. The port of Singapore has been so frequently described, that anything like a history of its march would appear superfluous.

Those who could at this moment view from the Governor's Hill what has been effected, and is now in progress, from marsh to city, would really be astonished at what wealth, perseverance, and bold design can effect. On the northern side of the stream are situated the private residences of the merchants' (little pa laces) public offices, &c, behind which, on a mound rising two hundred feet above the sea, on a fine airy commanding position, stands the dwelling of the governor, as well as the signal station. To the southward of the river all is commercial, comprehending the warehouses and counting-houses of the merchants, as well as the shops of the nu merous Chinese. All is activity, river and streets alive with human beings, and the port, almost too closely, thronged with vessels from every clime. The nature of our duties, as well as the very short period of sojourn, prevented our seeing much of the residents. To the governor I feel that my able coadjutor Kellett and myself are under consi derable obligation for his unremitted kindness during our short stay, as well as his anxiety to further the success of our operations. We had also the plea sure of becoming acquainted with Lieutenant Elliot of the Madras Engineers, in charge of the Magnetic Observatory, and were enabled to compare our instru ments with his splendid suite before moving to China. Previous to our departure, the French frigate Magicienne, Captain Roy, arrived from Brest and Cal- k 2"], [606, "132 [IS III. QUIT SINGAPORE. cutta on her way to Manila and China. I had the pleasure of paying him a visit on board his frigate, and felt regret at so short an acquaintance, and the impossibility, from want of time, to show him the attention which, under other circumstances, I should have been delighted to do. A light breeze helped us but tardily towards Piedra Branca, or white rock, which serves as the beacon in those straits, and never did light breezes weigh so heavily on us as at this moment. About noon we discovered canvass evidently of our own hue, and shortly after exchanged numbers with Her Majesty's brig Cruizer, Captain Giffard. Knowing him to be direct from the China fleet, our anxiety to learn particulars was very strong. He shortly came on board, and although he had but little to commu nicate, that little was to the effect that nothing hos tile had yet taken place, and that we might yet be in time to share in hostilities. This served as a fresh spur to lose not a moment in reaching the commander-in-chief. We, there fore, took leave, and hastened on for China. Light airs compelled us to anchor off Piedra Branca until daylight, when we resumed our voyage. I had already made up my mind, owing to the late ness of the season, to take the Palawan passage, and it so happened that on reaching the offing, the pre vailing breezes left us no alternative. We were much worried by heavy rains, squalls, variables, &c, preventing our obtaining the latitude ; and had we not"], [607, "133 840.] STARLING STRUCK BY LIGHTNING. fortunately passed close to Low Island, we should have been much puzzled how to act. During a heavy squall, a kind of whirlwind and whirlpool combined, which barely cleared our flying jib-boom, passed close under our lee without damage. On the morning of the 28th of October we found ourselves to the S.E. of the great Natuna, with fine weather and light breeze from S.W., enabling us to dry our feathers. On the evening of the 29th, with breezes varying from E.S.E. to W.S.W., we passed off the bank of soundings, our last depth being in one hundred and ten fathoms. On the night of Saturday, the 7th of November, we experienced a very severe visit of thunder, lightning, and rain. The forked lightning darted around us, and apparently inboard, with awful explosions of thunder, fortunately without wind. At daylight we found that the Starling had her foremast, topmast, and topgallant mast shattered, and three of her crew wounded by the electric fluid. Every exertion was made to secure the foremast by the assistance of our spars, and by noon she was in a condition to limp along with us, until they tried how much it would stand. By Sunday, the loth of November, we had only reached the northern end of the island of Balabac. On the 18th, we were off the Royal Captain Shoal ; which by night is certainly most dangerous, particu larly if a vessel should unfortunately find it to the S.W. with light winds. We tacked within one"], [608, "134 [184ft PASS GOAT ISLAND. cable's length of its S.W. extremity. It is not more than one mile in diameter. On the 19th we made Bombay Shoal, passing within half a cable of its western extreme ; no bot tom with one hundred and fifty fathoms. These patches are lagoon ledges, having about two or three feet of water over them, with deep blue water within. A few straggling coral blocks, not exceeding three feet in height, are here and there sprinkled over them. Nothing particular occurred until the 27th, when we experienced fresh breezes, with very sharp gusts off the south end of Palawan, causing us to split several sails. The southern end of the island ap peared either to form an archipelago, or to possess several very snug harbours. I am inclined to the latter opinion, as I did not observe corresponding openings on the northern sides of the headlands, and our in-shore reaches kept us close in with the land during the whole day. On the 28th, we experienced a strong north easter, which gradually veering to S.E., enabled us to round Goat Island, and shape our course for Manila. Both the Starling and Sulphur shaved the surf line of this island without obtaining soundings ; therefore the dangers reported to lie to the north ward of this island, are incorrectly stated. At dawn the following morning, we had hoped to fetch into Manila, but baffling winds prevented us until the day following from entering the horns of"], [609, "1840.] 135 ANCHOR AT MANILA. the bay. It was not until the morning of the 1st of December that we reached our anchorage off the town, in four and a half fathoms. The Starling had anchored the preceding evening. We found here the Danaide French corvette, com manded by Captain Rosamel, (son of the minister,) and two English transports, having on board part of the troops from Chusan, sent here for the re covery of their health. They were under strict quarantine, and in consequence of the massacre of the English and foreign residents which took place in 1824, (supposed to originate in the introduction of cholera,) the authorities could not be persuaded to relax in their favour. Although, strictly, there was not the least chance of injurious result by per mitting the officers to communicate with the shore for their general comfort, still the government was appre hensive that the native population and Creoles would create some disturbance, or possibly insult the visitors. After the visit of the captain of the port, whom I found to be a very gentlemanly prepossessing character, I accompanied him, together with Mr. Strachan and Lieut. Kellett, to pay my respects to the governor, who received us very kindly, and invited us to dinner on the day following. From thence we proceeded to the chief of the Hydrogra phic commission, and after entering into some con versation relative to their present operations in the survey of these islands, returned to Mr. Strachan's, the merchant who conducts the consular duties"], [610, "136 [184ft CIVILITY OF AUTHORITIES. here, and who at once made us at home, and in stalled us as part of his family during our stay. In the evening we attended the ball, and were introduced to the beauties of Manila. The evening passed off agreeably. It is the custom amongst the merchants here to give a ball weekly, each in his turn, which renders the society very pleasant. The dinner hour is generally early; most people drive out after sunset, and visits are paid in the evening. Manila is situated on the mouth of a river, which runs a considerable distance into the interior; its branches, particularly in the northern or mercantile town, forming a small archipelago. On the soutli ide, which is a complete walled fortification, the governor, officials, and military reside. The Custom house, merchant's houses, Chinese, &c., occupy the northern bank. The sides of the river are bounded by stone walls, which are carried out in the manner of canals, about six hundred yards to the seaward. On the northern extremity stands the light-house, and on its opposite a guard-house. At all times of tide the stream runs out, but the level is subject to tidal rise as far as the first bridge, at which point the stream is always fresh enough to fill water for shipping. Vessels of two hundred tons, or more, are brought into this canal. They have a dredg ing vessel worked by steam, which is kept pretty con stantly employed. The Chinese carry on trade here to a considerable extent, but their abodes render the town very shabby in appearance ; in fact, a sort of rag fair. The higher orders, how-"], [611, "1840.] 137 QUIT MANILA. ever, reside in good houses, and their wares are only to be viewed within. The party at the governor's passed off very agree ably. He was particularly civil. On my urging the necessity of deciding upon something relative to our pent-up soldiers in the transports, he im mediately entered into a very full and satisfactory explanation of his reasons. At the same time, to show how very anxious he was to exert all the authority that he possessed, he directed a new board of health to proceed next morning, and allowed me to accompany them, and satisfy myself of their proceedings. Everything that could be done under their law*s, was conceded. The officers who wished to land, were to undergo purification in a gun-boat for forty-eight hours, and might then remain on shore, but could not be permitted to pass to and fro ; and in order to relieve them of any embarrass ment, I placed myself in quarantine, after taking my final leave of the shore, by going on board to communicate the result of my negociations. But disappointed men are rarely grateful for any thing short of their desires. The indulgence and result of my exertions were hardly considered worth thanks, and I quitted them, sorry that I could do no better, but with the gratification of reflecting that the duty I had executed would be satisfactory to my com mander-in-chief, to whom the governor begged me most expressly to say, that he would do all that his power permitted, but that he was controlled by the board of health."], [612, "138 [1840. REACH CHUENPEE. Having taken my leave, and stepped the Starling's foremast, with orders to rejoin me with all despatch at Macao, I quitted Manila. I had heard that it was the intention of our commander-in-chief to commence hostilities on the 15th, therefore hou/rt were of the greatest importance, and every exertion was used to beat up to Cape Bolinas, before stretch ing across the China Sea. On the morning of the 13th, we passed within a mile of the southern edge of the Pratas reef, on which we noticed the wreck of a junk. The weather proved thick; and was attended with fresh breezes. We pushed on for Macao on the following morning (14th) ; but, by an error in the steerage, found we could not weather the northern Lemma, and there fore bore up, passing between them. About noon, we reached the south-west point of Lantao, and the breeze failing anchored off the rock on its western side. It was my intention to proceed direct to Macao, but observing a pleasure-boat near us, we sent to inquire for news. The intelligence altered our plans. The admiral had resigned and gone home, and Commodore Sir J. Gordon Bremer was in command of the squadron, off Chuenpee ; but the most interesting portion was, that no action had taken place. About sunset, the tide and breeze being favourable, we moved upwards, but were again compelled to anchor off Fansyack.

[1840 CHAPTER V. Neither letters nor orders awaited us ; in fact, no thing was known about us ; and (as some could not keep their own counsel) we were viewed as little bet ter than interlopers. On this day they had expected hostilities. Had they taken place, we certainly should have been in sight, but there our part would have ended. We found, however, nothing at present in contemplation, and for some time we were kept on the tenter hooks of expecta tion. Our time was not, however, passed in idle ness, as we managed to carry on our immediate survey up to the battery ranges, and otherwise make ourselves acquainted with the ground. The Starling rejoined us on the 23rd December. Various communications having passed between Her Majesty's Plenipotentiary and the Chinese au thorities, decided operations were now in contempla tion. Our force consisted of the undermentioned ships: Wellesley, 78, Captain Maitland, bearing the broad pendant of Commodore Sir J. G. Bremer;"], [615, "1840.] enemy's works. 141 Blenheim, 74, Sir H.

Steamers, Queen, Nemesis, Madagascar, and Enterprize. Chuenpee, or Shakok, is supposed to be the outer defence to Canton river, but ships can easily pass it, and even through in the direction of Tycocktow (or Taikok) without much danger from shot from either battery. The first battery on the crest of Chuenpee, in the hands of practised gunners with good ordnance, would be a serious obstruction. The island of Chuenpee is entirely composed of small hills, rising from a general level, which affords good valley passes for troops. By a reconnoissance, almost overlooking the enemy's works, it was evi dent that troops could advance, if covered by shipping on the west to create a diversion, and that the hill of Chuenpee once in our hands, the batteries be neath were untenable. The Chinese had thrown up a very perfect ditch, extending from the sea on the west, and completely surrounding their entrenched camp, and, moreover, had guns placed to command the several valley passes. Tycocktow was an open-faced battery, which must inevitably fall under a direct attack from the shipping."], [616, "142 [ls-41. ACTION AT CHUENPEE. On the morning of the 7th of January the order of battle was issued. The western division, for the attack of Tycocktow, was placed under the command of Captain Scott of the Samarang, having under Iii*- orders the Druid, Modeste, and Columbine. Tin* eastern division, under Captain Herbert, consisted of Calliope, Larne, Hyacinth ; steamers, Queen and Ne- mesis, with boats of Sulphur, &c, Commander Bel- cher, who was ordered to place Queen and Nemesis to shell the enemy from the heights ; and afterwards to attack the enemy's war junks. The troops and marines were to be landed, and advance by the valley, direct on the enemy's works ; the brigade commanded by Major Pratt, 26th (Cameronians.) This force consisted of a battalion of Royal Marines, under their gallant chief, Captain Ellis; a detachment of Royal Artillery, one twenty-four pounder howitzer, and two field-pieces, drawn by sea men, from Wellesley, Blenheim, and Melville ; the whole commanded by Captain Knowles, Royal Artillery; detachments of 26th Cameronians; and 37th native infantry, under Major Pratt, amounting in all to about fourteen hundred men. The brigade, as before stated, under the command of Major Pratt. The divisions landed about half-past eight. The Samarang led her division in gallant style, direct for the centre of the battery, anchoring within half a cable's length of the walls, followed by the Modeste, Druid, and Columbine ; and quickly and gallantly was"], [617, "1841.] 143 DESTRUCTION OF WAR JUNKS. their work achieved. Queen and Nemesis were duly placed, and dropped their shells prettily, the Queen firing the first shot, or \" opening the ball,\" as Jack had it, when Calliope, Hyacinth, and Lame, an chored and opened on the Lower Chuenpee. On observing the marines about to enter the upper battery, I transferred myself to Nemesis, and pushed on with our division of boats for the junks, giving Lower Chuenpee a dose of grape and canister, within pistol range. The Nemesis, drawing not more than five and a half or six feet, enabled us to get close up with the junks before opening fire, when several well-directed guns put them completely into confu sion. The first rocket pitched into the magazine of the ship next the admiral, and she blew up in great style. This settled the affair. The boats then moved on, and set fire to the junks in the lower part of the river, but in ascending the main branch, those retreating under canvass kept up a very spirited fire on the chasing boats, very gallantly kept in check by Lieut. Watson, of the Calliope. The increase of force soon decided their fate ; two ran on shore, and the remainder made their escape. The Nemesis having entered by the deep channel, came up in time to give the five retreating junks a dose, when the falling tide, and lateness of the hour, rendered it necessary to ensure her return. We first ran alongside the town, and selecting three of the most suspicious looking craft, they were towed down."], [618, "144 ADMIRAL'S DUTTON RESTORED. [1*41. One proving to be merchant property, and her owners imploring her restitution in the most affect ing manner, I released it; the other two were towed out, but one grounding outside, I left Kellett with the boats to destroy her ; but as she was found to contain powder, this was not an easy task ; she waa therefore abandoned. Eleven war junks, including their admiral's vessel, were destroyed and burned. About five I rejoined the commodore, dined with him, and made arrangements for the work of the morrow ; the squadron having already moved up in readiness to commence the attack on the Wangtong, Anunghoy, and other batteries. Having waited on the commodore about daylight, (by desire,) it was arranged that having examined the line of danger, so as to admit of taking one of the line-of-battle-ships up the western channel to Wangtong, I was to place the Queen, Nemesis, and rocket-boats, flanking Anunghoy, and then pilot Wellesley to Wangtong. In our affair of the junks, I had captured the admi ral's flag, cap, button, &c, and he now had sent the comprador to implore that the latter might be re turned to him. This having caused some sharp discus sion, which interfered with, and, as I thought, delayed action, I instantly offered the button and cap, to put an end to the question ; for which I was warmly thanked by Captain Elliott, as well as the commodore. I mention this circumstance, as the public prints have attributed this act of mine to Captain Elliot, instancing 8"], [619, "1841.] HAND OF BARBER-SURGEON. 145 it as a peculiar act of kindness. Indeed, I cannot, on mature reflection, at all reconcile to myself the jus tice of returning an enemy his sword or rank, when his desertion or abandonment of it have rendered him unworthy to wear it. However, as this button brought us nearer action by some minutes, perhaps hours, I was glad to pay the price. Another still more unfortunate transaction marred that day's operations. A Chinese barber-surgeon* taken prisoner in Tycocktow, was allowed to go in with a chop,f intimating, \" that if they wished their lives spared, or the action stayed, they had only to \" Chin-chin,\" haul down their colours, or send out a white flag, and hostilities would cease ;\" meaning to intimate, that life would be spared by their pursuing such a line of conduct when they intended to submit. * The woodcut of this hand of the barber-surgeon, was taken by making him place his hand on the paper, and tracing it out. t Chop is a note or letter, and in this case, of truce. VOL. II. L"], [620, "146 [1841 TRUCE This, however, was too great an oversight for a Chinese to let slip, and at the very critical mo ment when the Nemesis had opened a distant fire ; and when a twenty-four pounder rocket had pitched into the fort from Blenheim's rocket-boat, the Queen also close in upon her station, about to enfilade, and in a few minutes more Blenheim's broadside to settle the question ; \u2014 down dropped the Chinese banners, and out moved a Tankea boat, with an old man aud woman exhibiting a letter. I was within shot of her in the Queen, about half way between her and the com modore, and perfectly aware of its meaning ; but it appeared to the other officers of the squadron not a little strange that the flag of truce answered thk non-official demonstration from the old woman. Up went the flag of truce, and action was annulled, before the contents of that paper could be known. Under the customary practice of war, action had commenced, and we were certainly entitled to anchor, \" muzzle to muzzle,\" when their colours were thus struck, and in that condition settle the terms of negociation; even if the act were not deemed a virtual surrender. On the 13th of January, the Calliope, Sulphur, Modeste, Columbine, and Starling, (forming the light division,) anchored in line, off South Wangtong Island, preparatory to raising a howitzer battery on that island, and, supported by it, attacking the northern forts with the ships. On the 21st, these operations were suspended, by the pacific disposition"], [621, "1841.] 147 HOSTILITIES SUSPENDED. of the Chinese minister, Keshen ; and the squadron were therefore directed to move back to Chuenpee. Thus for a period ended this struggle ; a messen ger (formerly a disgraced comprador of the house of Dent and Co.) arrived to signify that he was pre pared to treat. Keshen did not personally appear, but through this emissary sent his adhesion to the demands of Captain Elliot, as embodied in the treaty. The only important point to which we became officially parties, was the cession of the island of Hongkong, situated off the peninsula of Cowloon, within the island of Lama, and on the northern side of entrance through the Lemma channel. Captain Scott, of the Samarang, having been left behind to give up the demolished forts of Chuenpee and Tycocktow to the Chinese authorities, the squadron withdrew from the river, and moved down to the S.W. bay of Lantao ; the commodore, shifting his broad pendant to the Calliope, moved on to Macao, accompanied by the Larne, Hyacinth, and Modeste. The Columbine was despatched to Chusan, to recal the force stationed there, and further to direct its evacuation on the release of Captain Anstruther, Mrs. Noble, &c. On the return of the commodore on the 24th, we were directed to proceed to Hongkong, and com mence its survey. We landed on Monday, the 26th, at fifteen minutes past eight, and being the L 2"], [622, "148 [ I M I TAKE POSSESSION OF HONG KONG. bona fide first possessors, her Majesty's health was drank with three cheers on Possession Mount. On the 26th, the squadron arrived ; the marines were landed, the union hoisted on our post, and formal possession taken of the island, by Commodore Sir J. G. Bremer, accompanied by the other officen of the squadron, under a feu-de-joie from the marines, and a royal salute from the ships of war. On the Cowloon Peninsula were situated two bat teries, which might have commanded the anchorage, but which appeared at present to be but thinly manned; these received due notice to withdraw their men and guns, as part of the late treaty. The French corvette Danaide having arrived at Macao, on a cruise of observation, and Captain Elliot having arranged to meet Keshen, and com plete the negociations at the Second Bar, had invited Captain Rosamel to join the party at Chuen pee. The Hyacinth and Modeste, being off Lintin to maintain the blockade, refused to permit the Danaide to pass up : an official refusal was very po litely requested, when it was arranged that the Hyacinth should remove to Chuenpee, where the blockade would be acknowledged. Both vessels having anchored there, Captain Elliot, with his party of the officers of the squadron, in the Nemesis, took Captain Rosamel on board, and moved on to the place of meeting. Keshen received them in state at the Second Bar, in tents, where they were"], [623, "1841.] MEETING OF KESHEN AND CAPT. ELLIOT. 149 very handsomely entertained. A guard of marines, taken up by the steamers, was turned out, and Keshen, as well as the other mandarins, were particu larly struck with their appearance and accoutre ments. Various engines of war were exhibited, but from the nature and construction of those in use amongst their soldiers, I should imagine that they comprehended very little of their superiority. Having completed the necessary data for the sur vey of Hong-kong, we quitted for Macao, intending to rate the chronometers, and complete a course of magnetic observations, preparatory to revisiting Ma nila, on our homeward route. The commodore had released me, in the full belief that the war in China was at an end. On the 19th, the commodore being on a visit at Macao, I called to pay my respects, previous to taking leave, when I found that operations were to be renewed. I was, therefore, retaken under his orders, and directed to return forthwith to our late position off the Wangtong islands, and place myself under the orders of Captain Herbert. It appears that whilst the Nemesis was waiting for an answer to a despatch, one of her boats had been sounding, and the northern Wangtong battery thought fit to fire a shot at her. This was not the actual cause of this sudden movement. But the period having elapsed for the completion of the necessary documents of the treaty, and the intelligence from Canton clearly evincing hostile preparations, as well as the supercession of"], [624, "( 1 SI I . 150 ANCHOR OFF SOUTH WANGTONG.

A reconnoissance of the enemy's works was immediately made from the southern Wangtong, which they had neither fortified nor occupied ; and preparations were accordingly made for constructing a howitzer battery on the saddle neck of that island. As no immediate operations were to take place, the Sulphur and the Louisa tender moved down to Lintin Bar, to guide the ships of the line over the bar. Observing the Queen steamer coming up, I immedi ately put myself on board of her, and joined the com modore; leaving the Louisa at anchor on the tongue of Lintin spit, and one of our cutters on the opposite side, the Sulphur following us up. Just as we passed Sampanchow, we noticed the Nemesis coming out of Junk Creek, towing the boats of the light squadron, and displaying the Chinese banners captured at a stockade fort which Captain Herbert had destroyed. (Guns mounted and dismounted at this fort, about eighty.) I accompanied Captain Herbert to visit it the day following, but a serious attack of fever left me little time for amusement. The thought of being left out of the approaching attack, did not tend to"], [625, "1841.] ATTACK THE NORTH WANGTONG. 151 relieve it ; but a visit from the commodore and Captain Herbert the evening previous to the action, revived me considerably, and at four on the follow ing morning the fever suddenly quitted me. I immediately dressed myself, and walked the deck to gather strength, and about eight o'clock went to the Wellesley when I contrived to scramble up the side and mount her quarter-deck. My orders were brief as usual \u2014 \"join Captain Herbert's division as before.\" As the breeze was light, and scarcely gave steerage way, the squadron did not move as early as was expected. At daylight Captain Knowles, R.A., opened with his howitzers from South Wangtong, and kept the enemy pretty well amused throughout their lines. About nine o'clock I visited his bat tery, and took a fair view of the enemy's works, and as soon as the breeze freshened, repaired on board the Calliope. Passing close to the western battery, she was anchored within musket-shot, on its N.W. flank, opposing her broadside to the new works which had been thrown up on that face of the island. Samarang took up her station very prettily* under her stern, and the cross fire of the two ves sels was beautiful, it acted like masons chipping off the alternate angles of the nearest embrasure. In a few minutes the enemy were flying ; when by Captain Herbert's direction, I passed to the commodore, and found Wellesley and Druid punish ing the western heavy fort. Having communicated"], [626, "152 [1841. SCENES AT WANGTONG. \" that there was no further opposition,\" I was or dered to see the troops landed immediately. It re quired but the sight of our despatch boat to set all the landing boats in motion, forcing my gig high and dry. On landing, I immediately took possession of the pass above the western battery, and prevented any advance until a commanding officer was found to lead the troops ; many of the landing boats' crews having quitted their boats, were sent back. I then directed Commander Fletcher to take the battery at the beach, and moved on with the troops. Opposition there was none. The unfortunate Chinese literally crammed the trenches, begging for mercy. I wish I could add that it was granted. The Sepoys fired into them. Wishing to rescue some of them, I went into the trench and drew three out, motioning them to come amongst our troops, and they would be safe. Two w*ere shot down whilst holding by my skirts ; and one of my gig's crew, perceiving my danger, dragged me away, exclaiming, \" They will shoot you next, sir.\" Thus much for employing troops who cannot understand English, and will only be commanded by their own officers ! Passing to the eastern battery, seconded by the first lieutenant of the Samarang, (now Commander Bowers,) we found not the slightest opposition. Indeed, it had been better if the troops had not advanced at all, for the hatred of the Bengal Vo-"], [627, "1841.] 153 BOGUE FORTS TAKEN. lunteers towards the unfortunate wretches we found on their knees imploring for mercy, might have been averted, and our colours still unsullied. Over seamen I had control, and could make myself un derstood, but these Bengalese would not under stand. It is unnecessary to relate the numerous acts of ferocity and brutality that I witnessed. I saw one of them deliberately fire his musket at a magazine door, and mentioned it to an officer of the 26th ; but it was of no avail ; he was in the same predica ment, and could only place a sentinel to prevent a repetition. On my return, I met the Commodore and Cap tain Maitland. They were also busy in putting a stop to these irregularities. I do not believe, from the instant we landed, (and I was the first,) that one single individual was found in arms, and yet hun dreds were killed. Quitting Wangtong, I rejoined Captain Herbert, who, with Captain Elliot, moved into the Nemesis, and ran over to have a finger in the Anunghoy affair. But Sir Le F. Senhouse, in the Blenheim, and Captain Dundas of the Melville, had already done their work brilliantly. We saw Sir Le Fleming leading his men on to the second battery in good style. A shell was sent into the near corner, and it was then decided that it would not be fair to in terfere with his laurels. Before sunset the enemy were driven from every"], [628, "154 LIGHT DIVISION PASS UP THE RIVER, [1841. post, even from their hill encampment; and the British were the only colours in sight. Captain Herbert having intimated his intention of moving on at dawn, I dropped Sulphur up to Tiger Island, leaving, en passant, a beacon on \" the sixteen feet rock.\" At half past six, a.m. Feb. 27th, we weighed, and led, followed by Calliope, Herald, Alligator, Modeste, Ne mesis, and Madagascar steamers. The batteries on Tiger Island were deserted, and the guns withdrawn, probably for the new defences on Wangtong. At fifty minutes past ten we passed the second bar creek, and about a quarter past twelve, observed an exten sive battery and encampment within the first bar. The channel was barred at the Chop House below Golgotha, by a floating bridge, and the Cambridge now converted into a Chinese ship of war, moored above to cover it. By signal, at half past one, we anchored off the first bar. I immediately joined Captains Herbert and Elliot in the Nemesis, and went in to reconnoitre. The Nemesis and Madagascar having anchored within, in an enfilading position, fired a few shots to try range. This was returned by the Celestials, and the question then became, \u2014 \" can we retreat without their claiming a victory ?\" No one was hold enough to give his consent to such a proposition. It was, therefore, determined that our ships should come in. By the advantage of our boat signals the Sulphur was instantly underway to meet me ; but"], [629, ""], [630, ""], [631, "1841.] 155 DESTROY FIRST BAR FORT. I had promised Captain Herbert, the instant he ap proached, to join him. The Sulphur anchored ahead, in support of the steamers, and after watching the effect of a few of our red-hot shot, I joined Calliope, when she was placed within and ahead of the Sulphur, and after one broadside it was de termined to storm. The other ships anchored in rotation. In refutation of Commander Bingham's hearsay account, (p. 152 to 158,) it is merely necessary to refer to the public despatch on the capture of First Bar Fort, and it will then appear that the junior cor vette did not lead into action, but that the facts are as above stated. A hard embankment fortunately afforded us ex cellent footing, and the marines having been drawn up, and Captain Herbert joined the van, we entered Mithout opposition on the S.W. angle of the bat tery, one party taking the eastern line, and the remainder the sea face. At some points the enemy behaved well ; but as they could not stand an in stant against disciplined men, a very few moments made the battery our own. The only, living pri soners were two fine little horses, which were cast in the ditch, but helped out. One of the party mounted one of them, but was glad to be left be hind, as immediately on regaining the use of his limbs, he scampered off to the enemy. The instant the battery was attacked, Lieut. Watson, first of Calliope, crossed their gig over the"], [632, "156 [1841. CAMBRIDGE BLOWN UP. floating bridge, and boarded the Celestial frigate \u00a9 \u00a9 7 O J Cambridge. The crew had fled, and she was soon in flames. About dark, she blew up with a mag nificent explosion. The solid wall or column of flame exceeded three hundred feet, and was capped by a mushroom head, of apparently fluid fire. In a few seconds not a vestige remained of this once British ship. This is the same Cambridge which was brought on speculation to China, by Mr. (now Sir C.) Douglas, was sold by him to an American, and immediately transferred, with her guns, &c, to the Chinese. After spiking and disabling the guns in the fort, blowing up their magazines, and carrying off a stock of banners, we retired about seven. Thus in the short space of a few hours, all this very beau tifully constructed, and (as far as silk banners and tents could make it so) beautifully decorated bat tery was utterly annihilated, and the valiant Celes tials had fled no one could tell whither. It has been the custom with all those with whom we have had thus to deal, to strip off every badge of military apparel the instant we come to close quarters ; and I suspect that they conceive that having yielded all, their persons are free ; at all events, they lose no opportunity to render that point secure, by their very rapid flight. By precon certed arrangements with Captain Herbert, I am happy to say that no butchery was practised here."], [633, "1841.] 157 DESTROY MASKED BATTERY. In the morning I joined Captain Herbert, who, with Captain Elliot, and the captains of the squa dron, proceeded in the Nemesis to examine the Salt Junk creek, and ascertain what depth we could carry up. After sighting \" Howqua's Folly,\" and Napier Fort, where the river was observed to be staked, and junks sunk, we put her head down wards, to return to our ships. At this moment I noticed a suspicious smoke at the near angle of the trees, but as no report followed, I could not be cer tain that it was a battery. On our return, our ships were passed through the raft at the First Bar, and anchored in Whampoa reach. On the following day it was determined that the Sulphur should move up the creek, and Captain Elliot having volunteered his assistance, we moved on without any accident, until we neared the suspected point, where I noticed the smoke yesterday. In my own mind, I was satisfied that we were to have amusement, and having with me a division of the Wellesley's boats, they were ordered \" to close, load, and prepare for action.\" Our men were also at quarters, and red hot shot were in readiness for the bow guns. We were not too soon. They instantly opened on us from a very \"well masked battery of thirty-five guns. The boats having been warned, required no further orders ; and leaving Captain Elliot in charge, I jumped into my gig to recal them, (or \" prevent their doing too much,\") in compliance with Captain"], [634, "158 howqua's folly. ( 1841. Elliot's wish. They were, however, too quick for me. The enemy had fled, and our party (rather foolishly) had pursued them into the town, where they might have been cut off. In what direction to pursue them was a difficult problem; I therefore took means to secure their retreat, or aid them if requisite, and destroyed the guns and munitions of war. In this affair, we had the misfortune to lose one of the Wellesley's men, who was shot through the lungs whilst sounding. Having returned to the Sulphur, she was anchored in advance within two miles of Howqua's Folly, Napier's Fort -being about one mile and a half beyond. The Herald, Alligator, and Modeste, entered the reach in the evening. In commander Bingham's account, p. 159, he here makes not only a great mistake, but certainly appears to exhibit a want of discipline in Lieut. Symons. The Sulphur only, and not towed, accompanied by the boats of the Wellesley, as I have before stated, performed this service. Lieut. Symons could not order when a superior was commanding. \" Howqua's Folly \" is a quadrangular fort, con structed of granite, and mounting twenty-eight guns on its four faces. It was built at the cost of Howqua, the Hong merchant, either by a squeeze, or for some punishment. \" Napier's Fort\" is of similar construction, placed on the tongue of an island, com manding two passages, and intended to prevent"], [635, "."], [636, ""], [637, "1841.] 159 ARRIVAL OF SIR HUGH G0UGH. any more Napiers proceeding, vi et armis, to Canton. Drury's Folly is a lofty pagoda, but not in a con spicuous position, and is intended to point out the failings of the individual of that name. On the 3rd of March the commodore joined us in the Madagascar, and having already examined the river, within musket shot of Howqua's Folly, I got permission to move the Sulphur, \" but not to risk action for the present,\" a flag of truce having been sent by the American consul. On anchoring within grape range, but entirely protected by the bank, the enemy fired the gun nearest to us, and I suspect fled. Major-General Sir Hugh Gough had arrived in the Cruizer, and taken command of the troops. I had now the pleasure of being introduced to him. As the Quangchowfoo, or mayor of Canton, was ex pected with a flag of truce, I was despatched to receive him, and conduct him to the commodore. In my passage up the river, I took a glance at Howqua's Folly, but found it apparently deserted. The Sulphur was moved nearer to the battery, and hoisted the commodore's pendant, and flag of truce. The Quangchowfoo passed without my noticing him, mistaking the boat which conveyed him for that of the American, who was in her. As I considered Howqua's Folly virtually aban doned, I obtained the commodore's leave to take possession, and on reaching the gate, found some"], [638, "160 [1841. VISIT OF QUANGCHOWFOO. people at the embrasures. As they did not attend to my gestures to open the gates, my boat's crew in a few seconds pitched me through the embrasure, when the Chinese vacated at double quick time by the opposite one. A shot soon opened the gates, the union was substituted for their hieroglyphics, and Lieut. Kellett, of the Starling, was left as acting gover nor. The gun which had been fired on my anchor ing off the fort the first day, I found had burst, and driven its breech into the house behind it ; probably committing more havoc amongst the garrison, than its shot would, had it fallen on hoard \u00a9 the Sulphur. On myreturn, I found the pendant of the commodore shifted to the Modeste, as they wished the Quangchowfoo to visit a vessel with a greater display of guns. (Vide Commander Bingham's account of this. p. 160.) I was then despatched with a flag of truce to Napier's Fort, accompanied by Mr. Morrison, inter preter and secretary to the plenipotentiary. The flag of truce made use of on this occasion, was a large white silk flag, captured at First Bar Fort, and possibly recognised by some of the runaways here. After delivering the despatch, the mandarin in com mand agreed to give up the fort next day, if I would permit him \"to make plenty of bobbery, \" and not put that plum in the gun.\" I told him, as I should probably have the job, that I would not trouble him, provided he ran away in time.\""], [639, ""], [640, ""], [641, "1841.] napier's fort. 161 These facts being communicated to the commo dore, at eleven the next day, when the flag of truce came dow*n, I was directed to take possession. The enemy had commenced a very strong mud battery on the right bank, for thirty-eight guns ; but I had been in its rear, and ascertained it to be harmless. On the left, in the opposite channel, a strong battery of forty guns covered Napier's Fort, and a wide and deep ditch at the floating bridge, flanked by a five-gun battery, prevented access by land. Of this latter we were not then aware. By boat signal, (all the captains being on board the Nemesis with the commodore,) the Sulphur was in motion before any of those anxious to lead could get to their ships, and was well supported by the Wellesley and Druid's boats, as well as her own. The ship was steered direct for the battery, the first lieu tenant having orders to drop his anchor, so as to bring her stern to the raft, and port broadside to the gate within pistol shot ; but not to fire without orders. We were in our boats, towed alongside. Our respective terms of treaty were religiously ob served. The enemy fired away all his rammers, &e., wide of us, and fled by one gate as I entered at the other. Two huge guns were pointed out of the arch ways of the gates ; their calibre about twenty-four pounders, but much heavier than our ten-inch guns. These I had ordered to be embarked, but when they commenced drawing the charges, they found that each contained seven shot and six cartridges, vol. ii. M"], [642, "[1841 162 RETURN TO WHAMPOA. inserted alternately \u2014 I suppose cartridge first, but the contrary certainly would not surprise me. The whole charge, as their cartridges are not less than one foot in length, came pretty near the muzzle. The guns were too cumbrous to move during our limited stay. A few minutes sufficed to make the fort British, and leading on the division for the centre of the bridge, a few strokes of a well-tempered axe, whieh is my constant companion, made a gap wide enough for ourselves, and ships if required, to pass. The division intended to take the forty-gun bat tery were brought to a stand still by the ditch, but we pushed on and planted our colours. But what a mortification ! not a gun or enemy remained ; every thing had been withdrawn during the night. A \" flare up\" we might easily have had, as the lines were plentifully strewed with powder. The troops had been moved on, with their gallant General at their head, in order to take this battery in rear, as well as obtain the command of the main road to Canton ; but he also had been impeded by the ditches and paddy fields, and returned as much disheartened as ourselves. The Modeste and Starling had moved down on the 7th, to try another branch, called \" the Macao Fort channel,\" and the Sulphur, without waiting longer, beat down, and reached the anchorage at Whampoa, seat ing herself on the mud about five o'clock, when I joined the General, Commodore Captain J. Elliot, and"], [643, "1841.] 163 ATTACK OF MACAO FORT. Captain Herbert, on board the Calliope, at dinner. The Sulphur now proceeded up the Macao Fort reach, but unfortunately grounded, and returned. On the 13th she again moved up, but grounding again, was prevented having her shot at the battery before it was captured. I just reached in time, in my gig, to be launched over the rafts, and take possession of a very complete \"fast boat,\" the crew of which ran her ashore and fled. Her commander was a man darin with a white button, which latter I captured, together with sundry articles for the toilet, which prove that mandarin dandies exist. During the short interval of truce, we moved down to Sam panchow, to obtain rates for our chronometers, re turning to Whampoa on the 11th. As some pause took place before further opera tions, I busied myself with the examination of an unfrequented channel to the southward of Dane's and French Islands ; indeed, one never attempted by ships on any previous occasion. Having ascer tained that a corvette could be carried up to a posi tion where the commerce of the enemy might be completely obstructed, I had permission to move the Hyacinth (18) thither. On the 16th March, we started, and placed her in the southern end of the Fatee creek, and on the 17th at noon, returned to the Modeste, where I found Captain Herbert. The commodore was ex pected on the morrow. The next grand attack was to be commenced on m 2"], [644, "164 [1841. FATEE CREEK. the Crow's-nest Fort, where a floating bridge again obstructed the river. A five-gun battery above, flanked it, and two war junks were moored beyond. The enemy showed about twenty fast boats, pulling about fifty to sixty oars each, armed with one or two brass guns, and eight gingals, carrying four ounce balls. My mind was fully bent on cap turing these gentry. Through the Fatee creek I hoped to catch them in rear, whilst they were showing off before the shipping, (with a bridge be tween them.) The force to complete the service before mentioned, was the Modeste, Starling, Alge rine, Hebe, Louisa, Nemesis and Madagascar steamers, and the boats of the squadron generally. The Commodore, and Captain Elliot, accompanied by Captain Herbert and myself, proceeded in Nemesis to examine Fatee Creek from the position of the Hya cinth. It was found impossible to push the Hyacinth higher, nor was there room for the Nemesis. It was, therefore, decided that I should take the command of a division of boats through this creek. This division, consisting of the boats belonging to the Sul phur, Hyacinth, Calliope, Cruizer, and Pylades, and supported by my worthy friend Captain Warren, moved forwards about eleven. Attaching our tow ropes to one of the large pas sage boats, we compelled her to tow us a considerable distance, so as to avoid being noticed by the Chinese. At the point where the creek turned off to Fatshan, there was scarcely room for our oars, and here a three-"], [645, "1841.] 165 ATTACK CANTON. gun battery had been prepared for its defence, but we found it deserted, and the guns withdrawn. Having cast off from the junk, we had scarcely entered the narrow pass, when we descried a boat mak ing off. It was fortunate for our party, as his range of sweeps required as much room as ours ; and his ad vance cleared the way for us in full cry after him. How he contrived to pass, or whether the vessels, were thrust out purposely, I know not, but fre quently we had not room for our oars ; and for this reason he distanced on us. At length the Broadway near the city opened, with Canton ahead. The action had commenced below, the vessels had passed the bridge, and the \" fast boats\" were flying in all directions. Warren and myself had entirely distanced our divisions ; one huge fellow we chased for a long time within pistol shot, yet he gained on us, and we were reluctantly compelled to relinquish him, to make sure of the others, now well within our grasp. The reports of the carronades of our boats soon told where they were, and having rejoined, the lighter boats were left in charge of the captured fast boats, and we then moved forward. The crowd of vessels falling constantly in our way, as well as myriads of sampans, &c, greatly obstructed our progress, and as we neared Canton, our vessels, not aware of our man\u0153uvre, and mistaking us for the enemy, were dropping their shot freely amongst us. As we sighted the Shameen Fort, it opened on"], [646, "166 [1841. HOIST colours at factory. the steamers advancing. We were then completely under cover of the houses, and landed, expecting to drive them out by musketry ; but found a deep and wide ditch between us, as well as a blank wall. The boats with guns were therefore brought up side by side to the piles in front, and five carronades, at thirty yards, played into their embrasures with grape, where they could not depress their guns. Joining Captain Warren in his gig, we landed, but before we could reach the gates, the enemy had fled. Having captured the fort, and the boats of the main division dropjfing in, I quitted, and joined the Nemesis, (leaving Captain Warren to move on to capture the Dutch Folly,) and was towed by her towards Rouge Fort, where having hauled down its colours, and left a party destroying the guns, I returned to the Nemesis, and was joined by Mr. Morrison, secretary to the Plenipotentiary. At the request of Captain Elliot, I landed, and re hoisted the British colours on the factory. Whilst thus engaged, a party of soldiers rushed out of the Hoppo' office, and had nearly succeeded in cutting off part of my boats' crew. But, being reinforced by one of our divisions, we pursued them up Hog-lane, and drove them back with some loss. On my return to the Nemesis, Captain Elliot requested me to take him to Howqua's house, or where his tea-boats are laden ; and having seated himself in the bow of one of the vessels, despatched one of the compradors to say he wished to speak"], [647, "1841.] 167 DUTCH FOLLY. with him. Howqua, however, would not come ; he was probably too much frightened, and afraid of involving himself ; but he sent down some tea,* which was rather acceptable. Captain Elliot then sent requesting him to tell the Quang-chow-foo \" that he wished an interview the day following.\" We then returned to the Madagascar steamer, where I found the Commodore. Some of the Chi nese having fired on our boats, (from the Custom house,) they were punished instanter by their carron ades, sweeping the lanes, and the Madagascar also threw in several well-directed shells. Captain Warren and his division captured the Dutch Folly, as well as five of Lin's gun-boats, most grotesquely painted as dolphins, dragons, &c. One of these having grounded, I was despatched to burn her, which having completed, I proceeded below Dutch Folly, where I found four fast boats, and a sand battery mounting five guns, very neatly masked with the mat bags ; the guns truly breeched with matting. These were all destroyed. The arse nal, and ten new war junks, were left untouched. The fast boats taken by our division amounted in all to fourteen. Five junks with very valuable cargoes, estimated at two and a half millions, were not meddled with ; and the force was employed, during the lat ter'part of the day, in saving Howqua's tea stores from the flames, the war junks, which had been fired, having drifted on them. * Bona fide in this case, a mixture of gunpowder, not How qua's mixture."], [648, "168 [1841. TERMS OF TRUCE. October the 19th, the officers assembled in the factory. Howqua and Mowqua made their appear ance, the former a very old infirm man, but I am sadly afraid they are both great rogues, and hostile to Great Britain. Shortly after, the Quang-chow foo made his appearance, and was introduced in form, when we left him and the plenipotentiary to discuss matters. It is rather a curious fact, that we should have replaced the British colours on the anniversary of their expulsion two years since. Terms were arranged for re-opening the trade under a flag of truce ! This was the amount of punishment awarded for their perfidy, and the ex pense incurred by her Majesty's government. Truce and trade ! Why ask permission? The command of the tea, as well as the tea merchants, was in our hands ; all the teas of Canton were virtually the pro perty of the British crown, until awarded as prize money, and therefore ought to have been sold by public auction. But it was a complete advantage obtained against the British. The increased price was placed on the tea, and river dues as well as other enormous absurdities were to be levied on our mer chant ships riding under the guns, as well as the flag of truce at Whampoa. By those only who commanded the river could those charges be levied. We were merely to be per mitted to pay the tax levied on the Hong merchants to restore the fortifications, and afford fresh sinews for war, when it suited them to renew hostilities !"], [649, "1841.] 169 TERMS OF TRUCE. Some very warm discussions ensued amongst the British merchants at Macao, many of whom would most certainly have disdained countenancing such a very questionable mode of commercial dealing. But they were not solely British ; there was no such feel ing to deter foreigners from reaping a rich harvest, to the injury of the British ; and the community did not, in fact, unanimously possess high feelings upon the question of \" Tea or no tea.\" They were mostly the agents of English houses, and, as they said, could not allow their houses to suffer, to the manifest ad vantage of the foreigners. Still, after all had been apparently settled, much distrust prevailed on both sides ; and although the Chinese gradually began to return to their shops, and teas began to be shipped, still offen sive edicts and chops (spurious as well as genuine) were daily appearing, troops arriving, and hostile intentions at no distant period very apparent. Forty-six boats full of troops (capable of holding one hundred and twenty each) passed the factory in one day. The long-expected successors to Keshen, the exterminating generals, Yihshan, Yang-fang, and Lung-wan, were said to have arrived, and their number stated to have increased to six. Still there was no meeting between them and Captain Elliot. Indeed, all the official duties appeared to be trans acted by the celebrated go-between, the Quang chow-foo (or chief magistrate of Canton) ; no meet ing was deigned to our plenipotentiary. 5"], [650, "170 [1841. VISIT MACAO. As I foresaw further work preparing for us, I lost no time in making myself better acquainted with the river, and hoped to find the famed Fatshan as a second position for our next campaign. As it was necessary I should repair to Macao for a short time, I moved down to Whampoa, in order to ascertain from the commodore what his further intentions were respecting us, but I was not a little surprised to hear that I was too late ; that he had quitted for Calcutta in one of the steamers, and that I must now look to Sir Le Fleming Senhouse for instruc tions. On my arrival at Macao, I found the Blenheim there, and learned from Sir Fleming that it was expressly ordered that I should be detained. He directed me to retain the command at Macao, until my opera tions were concluded, and then to resume my exami nation of the river, as I might see fit. Two officers of the Blenheim, Messrs. Toole and Bligh, were going off to the ship at night in a small cutter, when they were fallen on board of by pirates or fishermen, and were supposed to be murdered. It appears that they were in company with an English man who had charge of the cutter, and on the ves sel falling foul of them, either to save themselves, or resent the affront, as they deemed it, they jumped into the Chinese vessel, which falling clear, made off.

From Sir Le Fleming Senhouse, I learned that the commodore hoped to resume the command about the first week in May, and that it was probable we should be required for active service (to proceed to Amoy) on the 10th of May, at which period he hoped I would rejoin him at Hong-kong.

We moved up in the Sulphur to Macao Fort passage, when I proceeded by boat to call on Captain Herbert at Can ton Factory, where our officers still maintained guard. Nevertheless, the river extortions (dues I can no longer call them) were duly paid to preserve peace. I found every one extremely averse to my pro ceedings, and I fully believe that if I had not taken the precaution to obtain special permission upon every tittle of my intentions, from Captain Elliot, (through Sir Fleming, and officially forwarded to me for my guide,) I should have lost a golden harvest. To prevent discussion, I took short leave, commenced operations, and before sunset was out of sight in the other arm, leading to Fatee Creek. By this course I became prepared for further"], [655, "1481.] MEET BOAT CONTAINING LADIES. 175 operations at Canton. A new scene was now open ing to us, and we commenced exploring what was described as the main channel into the Broadway. This would have satisfied me as well, but I knew Fatshan was situated in that direction, and as the general report was, that their cannon foundry, gun powder factory, as well as treasure, was at that city, it became important to know how far we could touch these most sensitive nerves by this route, rather than by destroying the idol, \"the Golden Goose,\" (or in English the tea trade.) During our examination of the Fatee Creek, (the channel through which our division pushed to Can ton on the 18th,) we met numerous vessels moving off in great haste from Canton. At length a huge mandarin ark came suddenly upon us, escorted by five fast boats. The instant the man in command of the ark discovered he was amongst the Philistines, down flew his colours, and we had the satisfaction of seeing the Ko-tou performed in the most accom plished manner. I really pitied the poor fellow, and feared, if he beat his brains out on the deck, that they might demand me, as the not remote cause of his suicide. I perceived several very fair-skinned, fine-featured, and gentlemanly mandarins within the ark, and several very pretty and inquisitive females, with white chaplets (probably camellias) on their heads. In fact, it was a load of ladies. They were in all probability being removed on account of the extraordinary influx of soldiers. The mandarins did"], [656, "176 [IS I I.

My friends in the fast boats passed quietly, when I bowed to one of the com manders, who civilly returned the salutation. We repassed them again in the Fatshan Channel, but they took one of the southern creeks, probably had ing into the Broadway. At the end of our second day's labour, our two ad vanced boats got sight of the city of Fatshan, esti mated at two and a half miles distant, and subtend* ing an angle of forty-six degrees. Unfortunately, this discovery was not made known until my re turn, which rendered further examination at that period impossible, the period for the completion of equally or more important portions of the river being now too short. The Sulphur therefore moved downwards on the 1st of May, and on the 6th reached Tiger Island. Two extensive creeks, apparently communicating, behind the Anunghoy range, with Chuenpee, were now to be examined. On the 6th, we passed in be hind Sawshee Hill, and returned by a creek about two miles below it. On the 7th, we passed into the Anunghoy Creek channel, communicating also with that of yesterday, and came out at Junk Creek, where the war junks were destroyed on the capture of Chuenpee. By these examinations, we determined that a flotil la, drawing from ten to twelve feet water, could have proceeded to Canton by the back channels, entirely"], [657, "1841.] 177 CHANNELS BEHIND ANUNGHOY. avoiding the batteries of the Bocca Tigris, as well as that of Tiger Island. Behind Anunghoy two very large towns are situated, and we were informed that they have, about three miles inland, a walled barrack, capable of ac commodating six thousand men. It is a species of prison for pirates, and those under political surveil lance. It is said that the garrison of the Bogue was sent there for punishment, as well as to prevent their communicating their non-belligerent principles to the valiant \" rebel exterminators\" about Canton. On my former visit with one of the flags of truce, sent to Anunghoy Fort, I noticed many poor mise rable creatures, who certainly were not fit to work the guns ; and I was informed that they had impress ed the artisans of Canton to complete their force. Two of the officers landed near the town to erect marks, and although the crowd pressed about them, they were civilly treated. Rain and bad weather put an end to our operations. I therefore returned to the Sulphur, and moved on to Macao, to rate our chronometers, rejoining our senior officer at Hong-kong, on the night of the 10th. Sir Le Fleming Senhouse was delighted at our success, little dreaming how soon the results of these labours would be practically tested, and how much to his gratification. Preparations were immediately made to move on the 12th for Amoy and the north, the force to consist of H.M.S. Blenheim, Blonde, Sulphur, Hyacinth, Nim- V0L. II.

Everything went on swimmingly ; we were anxious to throw off the ennui resulting from late inaction; but an ominous delay still hung over all. The mer chants, who were well aware that hostilities must shortly be resumed at Canton, offered bets that Caj* tain Elliot would not go to Amoy, and that the squadron would not quit Canton river. On the 14th the bubble burst, and another turn was given to affairs : the Amoy expedition was ad journed, and orders issued to move again on Canton. On the 18th the Sulphur moved up, and Sir Fleming having consented to place the Blenheim under my charge, I promised to put him, as well as the Blonde and transports, in safe berths in sight of Canton. It was therefore necessary to be in advance and mark the dangers by Chinese boats, if they could be secured, otherwise the boats of the squadron would be brought in aid. The native pilots pursue this method, as the channel for heavy ships is rather serpentine. Before advancing our force, it may be as well to state the grounds of the present quarrel. In the former armistice it was fully understood that any attempts to re-arm the captured forts would be con sidered as an infraction of the truce. It was clearly evident to every rational mind, that this had long been done, and moreover, that, in addition to the supplies of guns and troops in vast quantity, formidable"], [659, "1841.] 179 CAUSES OF QUARREL. batteries were erecting at all points, fire-rafts were in preparation, and every act indicated immediate war. Even the Chinese themselves saw that it could no longer be concealed, and when they saw the foreign merchants withdrawing their property, fear ful that they would escape their grasp, the following edict was pasted up on the factories, as well as copies furnished to the merchants. \"Yu, the acting prefect of Canton, issues this edict for public information, in order to calm the feeling of the merchants, and to tranquillize com mercial business. It appears that the detachments of troops for Canton have all successively arrived ; the laws for the army, however, are very strict, and without being commissioned, soldiers can never move about to create disturbance, Still it is feared that, as the military hosts are gathered in clouds, the mer chants of all nations here engaged in commerce, hearing thereof, will tremble with alarm, not know ing where things will end. Some, frightened out of their wits, may abandon their goods and secretly go away ; and others may not know whether to expect quiet or danger, while all cherish their fearful appre hensions. Those foreign merchants who are re spectfully obedient, are viewed noways different from the children of the Celestial Dynasty ; and the imperial commissioner, and general pacificator of the rebels, 'and the high ministers and joint commis sioners, -with their excellencies the governor and lieutenant-governor, managing all things with due n 2"], [660, "[1841. 180 EDICTS. consideration, assuredly will not involve the good and the upright in trouble. These mercbants, being respectfully obedient, ought to be protected from all injury, and the goods which they have brought with them ought also to be preserved in safety. It is, therefore, right to issue this edict for full infor mation. And, accordingly, this is published for the assurance of the merchants of every country trading at Canton : to you who have always been respect fully obedient, and long enjoyed our commerce, the high officers of the celestial dynasty, in fulfilling the gracious pleasure of his imperial majesty towards foreigners, will give full protection to the utmost of their strength. Should native robbers and bandits come out to plunder or molest you, they shall he punished with increased severity; and any goods carried off shall be restored, so that the smallest loss shall not be sustained. And you, the said foreign merchants, ought also on your part to remain quiet in your lawful pursuits, continuing your trade as usual, without alarm or suspicion : but joining with the disturbed affairs will give occasion for sub sequent repentance. A special edict.\" Here was duplicity ! Here stand forth the cha racters of the high officers, the elite of the honoura ble men of China, ministers and generals, fully bent on entrapping every foreigner on whom they could lay their hands. Captain Elliot forthwith issued the following circular : \" In the present situation of circumstances, her"], [661, "1841.] 181 HOSTILITIES COMMENCED.

Plenipotentiary. \"British Factory, 2\\st May, 1841.\" This was followed by fire-rafts, sent down on the Alligator off the remains of Howqua's fort ; and, as customary, a general discharge of cannon, making much noise, but without injury, at least to the British. The Louisa tender and Aurora private schooner, anchored off the factories, escaped from guns as well as fire-rafts, by the exertions of the advanced squadron. On the morning of the 22nd, a boat belonging to the Morrison, (American ship,) with four seamen, mate, and three passengers, quitted with \" a chop,\" but were fired on, brought to, and carried into the city: all were wounded, and one was said to have been killed. In the morning the Modeste, Pylades, and Algerine, accompanied by the Nemesis steamer, punished Sha- meen fort, after which the boats of the squadron, assisted by the Nemesis, moved up the creek towards Neishang, and committed sad havoc amongst their junks, which were evidently laden with guns for the new fortifications, some weighing four or five tons. Thirty-nine junks, smacks, and fire-boats were burnt. The Chinese then attacked the factories, particu-"], [662, "182 [1841, BLENHEIM ANCHOUI'.U.

On the following morning she moved to the second bar, and anchored ; when, having placed the boats of the Sulphur, Blenheim, and Starling, in thcirpositions, she weighed, and I took her in tow with the Atalanta steamer. The day was beautiful, and everything favoured us. Passing the first bar by the New or \" Victoria Channel,\" I placed the Blenheim in a free swinging berth, five miles above the first bar, in sight of the advanced squadron and the city of Canton, and nine miles direct from the factory. 1 could have carried her three miles higher, where several of the deep transports were afterwards placed ; but although a safe berth could have been found, it was important to carry the transports there, and therefore not risk, on a falling tide, choking the channel, should she touch. I then brought up the Blonde, and afterwards the heavy transports, includ ing the Marion, with Sir Hugh Gough, and Head- Quarters. The remainder were left to the guidance of the officers of the Sulphur, and Mr. Brown, master of the Calliope. This part of my duty being completed, and some doubts arising relative to the actual points of terra firma on which the land force could act against Canton, I immediately requested \"to be allowed to put the matter beyond doubt by a de cided reconnoissance.\""], [663, "1841.] 183 EXAMINE NEISHANG CREEK. This being acceded to, and the Sulphur hav ing already moved up to the squadron off Canton, orders were issued for each of the advanced squadron to furnish an armed boat, which, with the launch of the Druid, under the command of my staunch sup porter, Lieutenant Goldsmith, (first of that ship,) and the boat force of the Sulphur and Starling, advanced on this duty about nine a. m., the morning following. As my attention would in all probability be en tirely bent on the reconnoissance, and I might even be detached for a time, the whole division was placed under the command of Lieutenant Goldsmith, acting under me. The first part of my instructions di rected me to collect sufficient tea-boats, or other large boats, for the conveyance of two thousand men, should I fall in with them. I therefore pulled up close on the Fatee side, and turned ten, capable of holding one hundred and twenty each, into the stream, calculating that with the ebb-tide they would soon drop down on our squadron ; a cutter, one of our division, was also detached to watch them, and returned as we reached the creek, where the Nemesis and boats had yesterday had their amusement. The junks were still smoking, and amidships in each we noticed at low water the huge guns intended for the use of the exterminating army. We little dreamed of anything remaining for us to do, although I had my suspicions. On reaching Neishang, where the Nemesis termi nated her work yesterday, we noticed two flotillas of"], [664, "184 [1841. CAPTURE OF FAST BOATS. fast boats, brave as usual ; their numbers probably, together, about forty. As I had begun to learn that these gentry would give us a heavy tug at chasing, I determined to use stratagem. Just opposite to Neishang the stream forks ; one branch to the left, leading towards the west, and probably rejoining the main stream ; the other to Tsingpoo. As I noticed the flood setting on the angle, I knew chat if I could get one division within the influence of the Tsingpoo stream, I could secure their capture by cutting direct for the angle. One division most assuredly kept command of that to the westward, in order to ensure escape. Our boats having come up and formed at the last burned junk at Neishang, the enemy, mistaking the reservation of our fire, assumed a more hostile attitude, and passed the rubicon. Our fire opened, and faster than my pen could state the facts, we found ourselves in possession of fifteen fast boats, five war junks, and several row boats, carrying from four to six gingals each, and amounting in all to twenty eight vessels. One of the largest fast boats, rowing sixty oars and armed with two brass six-pounders in the bow, and eight gingals, was preserved as a trophy ; the remainder were burnt. Moving on, we landed at the temple of Tsingpoo, where a sand battery of five guns had been erected. The guns were thrown into the sea, and the battery reduced to a level. As my war operations had now ceased, I turned the"], [665, "1841.] RECONNOISSANCE. 185 command over to Lieutenant Goldsmith, directing him to see the vessels completely destroyed. The enemy, who had retreated to the brow of the range which overlooked the river by eighty feet, annoyed us occasionally from their gingals, but were repaid with interest by grape from the boat's carronades. As nothing could be seen from the river, and without a distinct attack on the heights by our whole force we could not effect our object of re connoitre, I determined on trying, in the first in stance, how far I could effect my object from the masthead of a junk. One particularly adapted to this service lay immediately in front of where I suspected the enemy to be encamped in force. Ac cordingly I went on board her, and luckily finding her geer rove was hoisted to her masthead, (above one hundred feet,) sextant in hand, and to my de light, obtained a complete view of the whole country between the temple and the batteries on the heights. As I suspected, the enemy were encamped just within the verge of the hill. I have not the slightest doubt but they would have fled on our rising the hill. It had quite escaped my recollection that I had ordered all the junks to be burned ; my attention was deeply engaged elsewhere, and on my descent, I found a fierce fire raging beneath me. After adding fuel to help it, I quitted, but had not moved more than one hundred yards, when she blew up"], [666, "[1841. 186 RETURN TO BLENHEIM. with a grand explosion, and sunk but remained with her masts standing, thus effectually securing this position. Off and alongside the temple, I found four and a half fathoms at low water, and by our survey downwards, became fully satisfied that the Sulphur could, with care, be brought to support the troops, and serve as a rendezvous. Our operations in this neighbourhood being com plete, we moved out, taking with us, in addition to our fast boats, a state mandarin (house) boat, which served me well as a cabin for the next twenty-four hours. Crossing over to the creek above Fatee, wo extracted three fine boats from thence, one a salt vessel, capable of holding a whole regiment ; it was immediately named \" Noah's Ark\" by the sailors. These were towed down. Captain Barlow of the Nimrod had also secured several others by the divi sion under his command, all of which were sent down to the Blenheim that evening. Aware of the anxiety of Sir Fleming to know the result of my mission, I moved on immediately, and reached the Blenheim at half past eleven that night. Sir Fleming was reported to be in bed, but was sitting in his easy chair, and when I entered, he observed, \" Well, Captain Belcher, I thought I was right in sitting up for you.\" The report delighted him beyond measure, and his anxiety to communicate it to the General out stepped the fear of disturbing his slumbers. A"], [667, "1841.] 187 ADVANCE TO TSINGPOO. boat was immediately despatched. A bed had been prepared for me in the cabin of the Blenheim, but I preferred returning to a nap on board my mandarin boat. At dawn I rejoined Sir Fleming, and volun teered my services to number and distribute the troops to the boats, and as it was the anniversary of her Majesty's birth, we hoped to commence action that day. I was immediately despatched to the General, who ordered Major Beecher, the Quarter-master General, to accompany me forthwith. This service being complete before ten o'clock, and expecting the steamers to be shortly at my heels, towing the troops, I took my leave with carte blanche from Sir Fleming \" to place the Sulphur where I wished.\" The corvette squadron off Canton would otherwise have been under my command, but Sir Fleming having determined to accompany the general, and placing me on his staff, I preferred the more active appointment. My good friend Captain Warren, of the Hyacinth, therefore became senior officer off Canton. On reaching the Sulphur, I found the ships dressed with ensigns at the mastheads, which was shortly followed by the rolling roar of a royal salute in honour of her Majesty's birth-day. But few mi nutes were lost there. Ordering the Sulphur to weigh, I visited Captain Warren, gave him the orders from Sir Le Fleming Senhouse to be pre pared to take up their positions at two, and moving"], [668, "188 [1841. SULPHUR ANCHORS AT TSINGPOO. thence to our Plenipotentiary on board the Louisa cutter, informed him of my intentions, &c. The civil community deemed me mad ; several had seen the river dry across, and I was set down as \" cracked,\" at least. The Sulphur, under all canvass, with her ensigns still displayed, soon picked me up, and to the confu sion of the overwise, soon disappeared amongst the trees. She touched, but soon moved on, and at four p. m. was safely anchored alongside the temple of Tsingpoo. Parties were immediately employed to clear the temples for the accommodation of the troops. A fine fat buck, found within the walls of the temple gardens, was sentenced to death by drum-head court-martial, and turned over to the cook, as ground work for a hot supper. I then proceeded to the heights with a party of seamen, and found the enemy had decamped, and that nothing to oppose us was near. Look-out men were then stationed at the mastheads, and preparations were made to receive the general and our naval commander-in-chief, who were observed approaching in the Nemesis, with troop-boats in tow. About sunset, the troops commenced disembark ing from the junks or tea-boats, in order to relieve the pressure. The General, Sir Le Fleming Sen house, and the staff, supported by a strong party, advanced to the position lately occupied by theenemy's encampment. It was too late to see anything, yet"], [669, "1841.] 189 LAND THE TROOPS. at the same time it was necessary to have command of the heights, in case of any extraordinary exhibi tions of valour during the night. During the time we remained there, the Chinese set up a few yells, and burnt a species of Roman candle, the balls of which served to show us in position. I suspect them to be part of the stores of the fast boats; if so, they are constructed of bamboos of two inches internal bore, and intended to point at those attempting to board ; probably expecting that a fire ball in the face might damp their ardour. In the midst of this, our attention was arrested by sounds which we mistook for the cries of a Chinaman under punishment, or in distress cer tainly ; but they passed unnoticed, and utter dark ness prevented our seeing many yards around us. On the morning following, it proved to have been the cries of one of the camp folio w*ers, who had gone to a pond for water, and having been caught by the Chinese, was then undergoing decapitation. The fireworks having ceased, and quietness pre vailing, an additional force arrived, and the General having given his orders for the night, we retired to the Sulphur, where, having done justice to the mandarin venison, the chiefs retired for the night. An alarm was sounded about midnight, and in a few seconds we were on shore. The exact cause was never ascertained, but I believe that it arose from a pig having made a desperate sally upon the \"piled"], [670, "190 [1841. ADVANCE ON CANTON. arms,\" and thus created great confusion. Had they seen his tail, they might easily have determined that he was not a Chinaman. Indeed, they take very great precaution not to permit such a handle to be dangling \" on service.\" Sir Le Fleming Senhouse having joined the staff* the command of the marine battalion was given to Captain Bourchier, of H. M.S. Blonde, having under him Captain Maitland, (Wellesley,) Captain Barlow, (Nimrod,) with their lieutenants of divisions. Having made a hearty venison breakfast at the expense of the god of physic, (the lord of the manor of Tsingpoo temple,) and the remainder of the force having disembarked, we met the general at our last night's position, and before eight we were on the advance. Only a few straggling parties of the enemy were noticed, and these in great disorder, and probably not belonging to their regular army. They occasionally exhibited in pantomimic ges ture the bravest of the brave, and intended us to believe they were anxious for closer acquaintance. The first brigade was formed of the 49th and 37th regiments, with a detachment of Bengal volunteers ; the second of the royal and Madras artillery, sap pers and miners. The corps of seamen formed the third brigade in the right column. The ordnance was intended to consist of four twelve-pounder howitzers; four nine-pounder field-guns; four five and-a-half-inch mortars; fifty-two thirty-two-pounder rockets, and two light six-pounders."], [671, "1841.] 191 ATTACK THE HEIGHTS. The left column consisted of the 18th royal Irish, 26th Cameronians, a detachment of Madras ar tillery engineers and sappers, with a six-pounder, and a five-and-a-half-inch mortar. The royal ar tillery had also their rocket-frames with nine pounder rockets, as well as a few musket rockets. Our progress was not rapid, as the lines of road had to be examined before adopted, and guns were but slowly advanced. About nine o'clock, we had advanced to the first joss-house within reach of what were afterwards termed the seamen's batteries, Kung-kik-tai, or \" fortress of extreme protection,\" and here the rockets were in excellent distance. The enemy threw the shot over our heads without injury to our party, and their grape-shot constantly dropped amongst us, but without damage, being merely spent balls. I found I had by some means distanced the Ge neral and Sir Le Fleming, and a message from the General to the artillery, to direct the guns on a bat tery to the left, was the first intimation that he had taken a different route. We had no guns, but about this moment Lieut. Wood, of the Sulphur, reported to me that he had, by the exertions of a detachment of the Sulphur's crew, brought up one of the twelve-pounder howitzers and the nine-pounder field-piece was following. This gun was immedi ately turned over to Captain Anstruther, of the Madras artillery, who in a few minutes did good"], [672, "192 [1841. BATTERIES ON HEIGHTS CAPTURED. service, clearing the battery above us, as well as completely fulfilling the General's intentions. About this moment, I observed the General, with the 18th and 49th under Colonel Morris, as cending the hills in front. Thinking that the enemy would, in all probability, retreat down the gorge, I determined to make my advance to rejoin by that route, and was moving forward, when Cap tain Elliot requested convoy, which was of course granted. We very soon found that we had not selected the best road for the safety of the plenipo tentiary, and under a general salute of every species of arms from the whole face of Canton walls, we reached our friends at the Hill Fort, Pou-kik-tai, or \" Extreme Security,\" without accident. This work, a large square stone battery, having embrasures on each side, and an interior turret mounting nine guns, had always been one of my principal objects in the survey of the river, and therefore became doubly interesting. It is situated on a very steep mound, overlooking the walls of Canton, and within accurate musket shot, the space between, forming a very deep natural ravine or ditch. It is also within musket shot of the \" Five-story Pagoda.\" As the enemy continued to annoy us much from a three-gun battery immediately in front, I com menced upon them with two of their own six-pounder guns, from the turret, and found them carry pretty truly with half charge of their own cartridges, \u2014 which"], [673, "1841.] CAPTAIN BOURCHIER'S DIVISION. 193 are each about eighteen inches in length ! But as the balls from the gingals flew very thick, and Sir Le Fleming thought that our men ought scarcely to be risked for the damage that might be done to one or two Chinese, the fire was discontinued. A small cohorn, under the direction of a young officer of the Madras artillery, (just arrived in time to share in the affair,) proved very effective ; his first debut on service was to throw several shells very beautifully ; the third blew up a large magazine, in rear of our friend the three-gun battery, and for a time reduced the annoyance from that quarter ; but during the night they rested not. At the same instant that the troops stormed their forts, the blue-jacket division, under their worthy leader Captain Bourchier, gallantly carried the two batteries assigned to them, (Fortresses of Perpetual Bliss, and Everlasting Security.) But they were less fortunate in quarters, as being nearer the lines, and quite unprotected, the enemy kept up a well-directed fire upon one spot, of which they doubtless previously knew the range. The six-pounder, under the com mand of the Hon. Lieutenant Spenser, R. A., was sent to their assistance, and they managed to repay their civilities ; not, however, before Lieutenant Fox and Mr. Kendal, mate, both of H. M. S. Nimrod, had each lost a leg, and several seamen were severely wounded. The former expired shortly after the operation of amputation above the wound. Hardly had the troops regained their wind, VOL. II. o"], [674, "194 [ 1841 ATTACK ON NORTHERN CAMP (dreaming little of further operations,) when the reserve was directed to attack the entrenched camp outside of the N. E. gate. As this position was out of range from our battery, and the advance exposed to the whole of that line of city wall, it was at once perceived that this was to be a lesson to the Celestials how little we cared for them in the field.* The enemy had taken up numerous scattered po sitions, with gingals placed in the paddy fields, from which they could, almost unseen, or, as bad, unnoticed, being in pairs only, completely gall the advancing party. Those in the camp were waving their banners, and inviting their opponents to ad vance, with every imaginable gesticulation. At double quick time, forward dashed our friends the Royal Irish, and in a few moments the theatricals were ended. \" Sauve qui peut !\" I suppose to have been the order of the Chinese general, and most obedient they proved. I do not believe an opponent was found after the troops entered the encamp ment. It was beautifully done, and beautifully followed up ; no confusion \u2014 no helter-skelter plundering, which we had before been disgusted with ; but the troops were formed coolly in their new barrack-yard pro tern., and parties were employed to execute the duty of destruction. The customary trophies of course were not left behind, and shortly, in the same * It was generally remarked by the Chinese, that if they once got us on terra firma, the chances of war would be reversed."], [675, "1841.] VESSELS ATTACKED BY CHINESE. 195 military style, they quitted the demolished camp on their return. All this we witnessed and enjoyed from head-quarters. On this duty, four officers and several men were severely wounded. Colonel Morris, of the 49th, commanded this service, and brought away the gene ral's horse, most magnificently caparisoned. Why did not the general fly on his back ? Probably they make a point of leaving enough behind to rescue their carcasses. The enemy continued to worry us by their firing during the whole night, but without damage to any person ; but suddenly in the morning their fire slack ened, and at daylight had entirely ceased. The first despatch from \" the Blues\" acquainted us with the death of Lieutenant Fox, who did not rally after amputation. At the time these operations were going on, an attack was made by a party at the beach, but was repulsed by the seamen under the command of Mr. Goss, acting master of the Sulphur, assisted by de tachments of marines, and troops. I suspect the Chinese paid dearly for this freak. As this disposition rendered the village behind the temple too dangerous a redoubt in our rear, it was directed to be destroyed. On the morning of the 26th, it was eagerly ex pected that we should escalade the walls of Canton ; but as it was deemed important to bring up further supplies of rockets and carcasses, as well as ammuni- o 2"], [676, "196 [ I 84 I . TRICK. tion, a party was despatched for this purpose to the Blenheim. Had it been possible to foresee events, doubtless the British colours would have been flying on the walls at dawn. In the afternoon a flag of truce was displayed on the city walls, when I was deputed to accompany Brigadier-General Burrell, with Mr. Thorn, inter preter, to ascertain the cause, and their object ; at the same time to acquaint them \"that no interview would be granted but to their commander- in-chief and then outside the city walls, and further, that no terms but those of submission would be listened to.\" Time was afforded them until half-past three, at which period hostilities would be resumed. At the expira tion of that period no one came ; and at a later pe riod we would not listen to them. Early on the morning of the 27th, the flag was again displayed, as well as another of larger dimen sions. I was again sent up to the wall, with Captain Gough, the General's aide-de-camp ; there was much repetition of yesterday's work, and nothing done. Towards sunset a letter was presented, but as they offered it for Captain Elliot, and he was on the sea side of Canton, they were desired to take it to the ships of war. During the morning, the General and Sir Le Flem ing Senhouse held a parley, under the city wall, with a red-buttoned and peacock-feathered mandarin, (who stated himself to be the General,) but without effect, although many compliments were exchanged. It"], [677, "1841.] MEMORIAL OF YISHAN TO THE EMPEROR. 197 will be seen by the following memorial to what pur pose this was converted. Memorial from Yishan and his colleagues to the empe- ror, concerning the capture of the forts and height above Canton. \" This day, the 14th day of the fourth moon, (3rd June, 1841,) we, the great rebel-quelling General Yishan, and the Lieutenant-Generals Lungwan and Yangfang, respectfully take all the facts relating to the English foreigners making an attack on the pro vincial city with their ships, and that we exerted ourselves to the utmost, leading on our soldiers to defend the same, which happily has escaped without much damage : and after considering the whole state of affairs, how that we have adopted certain tempo rary measures, suited to the exigencies of the case and having for their object, our being able in future to maintain the place : all these facts we now re spectfully embody in the present memorial, looking upwards, and hoping that it will obtain a sacred glance. Your slaves already, on the sixth day of the present moon, (28th May, 1841,) took all the details of what had occurred up to that date, and duly for warded them as recorded. \"The city of Canton stands at the foot of a hill called Kwangin Shan, while its front extends to the banks of the great river. To the north-west is the depart ment of Shaonking-foo, and to the north are the les-"], [678, "[1841. 198 MEMORIAL OF YISHAN ser districts of Nanheung Chori, Leenchow, &c, &c, all of whose merchants and travellers come to the provincial city by several branches of the river, which passes by Fatee, and afterward mingle their waters with the great ocean. \" From the time that the foreign ships forced their way into the provincial river, they stationed a great many vessels, (at the most important points,) and thus grasped the very throat and windpipe of our communication. The eastern branch by Le'etein, (neighbourhood of Howqua's Folly,) and the western branch by Taou Hwang Kaou, (Macao passage,) both communicate with Whampoa, and thence to Bocca Tigris : there are many arms of the sea flowing in different directions : the creeks, inlets, and outlets, most multifarious ; during the floods, the whole country is under water, and there is no important pass where a garrison might be placed for defence. Moreover, the fields are cramped and narrow ; it is not easy to find a place to pitch a camp ; the hills on the north command the city, so that one may look down and see everything going on within ; and the foreigners were constantly in the habit of prying and spying ; forsooth it was no easy matter to prevent them. \"Having previously prepared our means of attack by fire at Neishing, fifteen leagues from the city, in which we used rafts of wood floated down from Kwangse, and quantities of paddystraw brought from Kinshan, and other places in the lesser districts of Sanshway, we"], [679, "1841.] TO THE EMPEROR. 199 despatched several special messengers, in order to have them bound and properly placed, (to drift on the foreign ships.) But these said foreigners, having found out, for the second time, that our fire-rafts were about ready, drew the sword, and commenced the war from the first of the moon. The rebels sent their ships' boats* secretly to sound and get in formation, but they were beaten back by the officers and soldiers of the garrison, who opened upon them a fire of great guns and matchlocks. So it w*as until the fifth day, (Tuesday, 25th May,) when thirty eight sail of foreign ships rushed up in a body and attacked the city ; and at the same time, (another body of the rebels) proceeded in steamboats to Nei shing, and opened their fire upon it. A number of native traitors, dressed like sailors, in the confusion, got into our ships, which were filled with paddy straw, and set fire to them right and left, and burned the greater part of the fuel in the rear of our troops. These native traitors then swam on shore, and proceeded by land to our rear, and thus Neishing, being simultaneously attacked on three points, could hold out no longer. \" At this time, the river being blocked up (by the enemy), there were no means of forwarding any com munication ; those who hurried onwards to work the guns had no way of getting there, and those who had previously gone to hasten the arrival (of other guns), had no way of getting them transported to the city. * Were these the Sulphur's boats ?"], [680, "[1841. 200 MEMORIAL OF YISHAN \" As regards stores for the soldiers, though we had abundance of corn heaped up in our granaries, which we could have ground at any time, yet the food and rice of the common people is all brought from the country round about : thus, in making a stout defence of the city, the merchant could never dispose of his wares; and what would be worse, the people could not without difficulty procure their daily food. Add to this, that the roar of the cannon was unceasing, the people of the new city, (south side,) one following the example of the other, all moved into the old city, (north side,) and there they had a struggle. Such a state of things could not last long before the supply would become exhausted, and then the anger of the multitude would be quite irrepressible ! We humbly think that the important post of the provincial city concerns the whole province ; should it be lost by any remissness, then the thieves and vagabonds of every district would avail themselves of the oppor tunity, and rise in swarms like so many wasps ! Moreover, an organized army (though disbanded) may be reassembled ; in marching troops through the country, numerous opportunities present themselves for selecting important passes, and engaging the enemy at advantage : but there is no principle by which we may abandon the provincial city to its fate ; if the city hold out, or if it be lost, and for us to perish along with it, does not appear to be the plan best suited to the welfare of the country ! We your slaves have again reflected on all the circuni-"], [681, "1841.] TO THE EMPEROR. 201 stances of the case, and are compelled to confess that we found ourselves at our wit's end. \" Having previously examined the site of the city, and found that the forts on the north were small and cramped in their construction, and could not contain many soldiers, we could only select our best troops, and station them on the northern quarter, placing some guns there, that they might make a stout de- fence. Thus they waited until the foreigners, having landed from their ships at Neishing, were pushing- straight forward to the north side of the city, when our men opened a thundering fire, and killed more than ten of the foreign rebels, and upwards of a hundred of the native traitors. The said foreigners upon this retired to the heights above the town, and the forts remained in their possession ; it being now dark, we drew off our troops within the city. Thus matters went on till the seventh day of the moon (Thursday, 27th May,) when the whole of the inhabi- tants of the city came rushing in crowds, and pre- sented petitions, begging and praying that we would take measures to save their lives, and at the same time the soldiers on duty at the embrasures reported that they had seen the foreigners beckoning with their hands towards the city, as if they had something to communicate.* We thereupon immediately ordered * All this is founded on the notice taken of the flag of truce, aud proves the wiliness of these people.

He forthwith called a linguist, to inquire what they wanted, when it appears they said that they begged the great general to come out, as they had some hardships to complain of to him ; upon this, the commanding officer, (or tsang ping,) Twan Yangfuh, said to them in an angry tone, ' How can the great general of the celestial dynasty come out to see such as you ? He has come here by command of the great emperor, and he knows nothing more about you than to fight with you!' Upon this the said barbarians took off their hats and made a bow ; then they sent away the people who were about them, and casting their weapons on the ground, performed an obeisance towards the city wall. Twan Yangfuh, \u2014 having previously got per mission from us your slaves to do so, \u2014 then asked them what grievances they had to complain of, which caused them to resist the forces of the central land, and conduct themselves so madly and rebelliously on many occasions. They, in course, replied that they, operations until it suits their purpose to renew hostilities ; and they do not admit in any shape in their memorial that it was displayed on either side. The taking off the hat, which the general did in courtesy, as a salutation, when he was apprized that Yang was the person speaking from the walls, has been prettily twisted. * High characters."], [683, "1841.] 203 TO THE EMPEROR. 4 the English, could not carry on their trade, that their goods were not being consumed, that their capital was wasting away, and that their debts were not being re paid them : and that as both parties were firing off their great guns on the side of the new city, they had no means of making a communication there, and therefore they had come to this side, to beg the chief general that he would implore the great em peror in their behalf, that he would have mercy upon them, and cause their debts to be repaid them, and graciously permit them to carry on their com merce, when they would immediately withdraw their ships from the Bocca Tigris, and deliver up all the forts they had taken, and never dare again to raise any disturbance, and other words to that effect. And at the same time all the Hong merchants handed in a petition, stating that ' the whole body of the foreign merchants had authorized them to say for them, that they wanted to carry on trade as before,'* and to have the debts cleared off which have been owing to them for many years, when they would immediately take all their ships of war, and withdraw them beyond the Bocca Tigris,' &c. Your slaves, having taken an enlarged view of the ques tion, and duly weighed and deliberated thereon, came to the conclusion that the defences of the Bocca Tigris being already lost, those within, and those without had alike no place of strength to de pend upon, and it would be better to grant their * The old story against Captain Elliot."], [684, "204 [1841 MEMORIAL OF YISHAN terms, and thus save the city from its periloussituation, and reanimate the drooping spirit of its inhabitants, rather than continue a struggle which was jeopardiz- ing the many millions of lives of the whole province, and which might not have a successful result after all. On summing up the pecuniary resources of the single province of Canton, we find that its cus- tom-house duties and land-taxes do not yield less than three millions of taels annually ; and if we could only get these foreign claims cleared off, in the course of a few years the province would re- cover itself; whereas, if we sit idly waiting for a long time, perhaps some unlooked for calamity may overtake us, when not only will it be impossible for the province to recover itself, but it will be involved in vast expense, thrown into utter confusion, and the common people of the land, who are the very essence of the land itself, should they meet the poi- sonous influence (of a foreign war), the consequences might be very grave indeed. Therefore, it was that after maturely deliberating together, we despatched the Quang-chow-foo, Ya Paoushun to do the best he could, and, in accordance with the request of the merchants, to grant for the time being the favour of carrying on commercial relations to all countries on the same footing ; thus viewing the recovery of the people from their state of destitution as the ob ject of primary importance. \" Commerce is to these said foreigners the very artery of life. Let us wait quietly till the foreign"], [685, "1841.] TO THE EMPEROR. 205 ships of war have retired, and the native traitors are dispersed, when, beginning with the river in front of the city, aud continuing the work down to the Bocca Tigris itself, at every important pass we shall block up the course of the river with piles of stones, and there erect forts and place guns : and thus, having secured the door of entrance, we shall have ample means to oppose their progress, and maintain our defences. And finally, having thus our gripe on their thrapple, should they ever dare again to give rein to their outrageous conduct, we can in a moment stop their commerce : this, then, is a mode of governing them which is always in our hands. These facts relating to the late attack on this city, and the temporary expedient which we have adopted in the exigencies of the case, we now respectfully unite with the other memorials which we have sent up successively, and humbly hope that a holy glance may be cast upon them, and the sacred will in course manifested.\" In the terms agreed upon, it was fully understood that the city was spared : and that until the general question, of the demands made by our Government on the Court of Pekin was fully settled, any attempt to re-arm would be considered an act of hostility, and meet with immediate punishment.

SUPPLEMENTARY MEMORIAL TO THE PRECEDING. \" Further, your slaves, Yishan, Lungwan, and Yangfang, received your sacred Majesty's special commands to lead a body of troops to Canton, to attack and exterminate the English rebels : and your slaves Ahtsingal, (the Tartar general of the garrison,) Ke Kung, (the viceroy,) Ele'ang, (the lieutenant-governor,) and Yusoy, (the too-tung or Tartar lieutenant-general,) had alike with us a share of the responsibility of holding out the pro vincial city ; there was not a day that we did not consider how we might massacre utterly this hateful brood, thereby manifesting the majesty of heaven, (i. e. China,) and gladdening the hearts of men. How then should we dare to act (apparently) in opposition to such sentiments, and bring forward plans for tem porary expedients ? Alas ! this arose wholly from the necessity of our position ; we could not possibly help it. And we cannot do otherwise than lay before the holy lord the feelings of bitterness that now swell our bosoms. \" There are eight serious difficulties in the way of defending the city of Canton from attack, which your slave Yangfang, on a previous occasion, laid before your Majesty in a secret memorial ; and when we, your slaves Yihshan and Lungwan, arrived"], [687, "1841.] MEMORIAL OF YISHAN TO THE EMPEROR. 207 aftenvards in Kwanghing, we found that on the right side and on the left, the throats of our com munications were already in the hands of the enemy. \" On going up the stream of time, we find that Canton has carried on commercial intercourse with all foreign countries for about two hundred years. The natives of Canton most thoroughly know the dispositions of the foreigners and their likings ; the people who dwell on the coast, such as the fisher men, and the boat people, those who constantly come and go with the tide through our military stations, are all in league with them, and understand their language ; these are greedy after gain and fond of strife. Love of country (of the Natale Solum) hangs loosely about them ; therefore it is that the foreigners do not grudge expense to get them into their employment, and consequently their hearts are turned against their masters, while they are dead to us ; they obey their foreign masters in all things, they convey the most secret intelligence, and there is nothing, in short, that they may not be induced to do ! Although we have already caught several, and immediately executed them, yet the traces of others being obliterated in a great com mercial vortex like this, there is really no way of distinguishing them. A still worse feature is, that there are those who falsely make soldiers' dresses, and imitate the badges, and enter our ranks as if they were going to battle. These perhaps run away at the first onset, (to spread a panic among our"], [688, "208 [1841. oMEMORIAL OF YISHAN men,) or they attack and wound our officers and soldiers! Their villanies are quite innumerable; so much so, that many of them are positive spies in our very camp ! In this late affair we secretly caught several, and after decapitating them, we exposed their heads to the people by way of warning. \"On a previous occasion, your majesty's slave Ele'dng, during the second moon, (i. e. after the fall of the Bogue,) had proclamations cut out and printed, in which he assured them, that what was past and gone, would be pardoned, and promised them wealth and honours if they would reform and exert themselves. Your slaves also again and a third time issued proclamations, exhorting them to renovate themselves, and promising most handsome rewards, and yet those of them who returned to their allegiance were few indeed. \" Again, our great guns by sea and land being already lost, and we having no others to replace them, our vessels of war being without sailors to man them, our land troops, whenever they approached the bank of the river to repel the enemy, being met by the fire of the foreigners, which was fierce in the extreme, those defences which we depended upon, such as mounds of earth, sand bags, cotton waste, and cowhides, though built up more than a ehang (three yards) thick, being shot through, our soldiers had not a spot left them where they could set their foot. Now, although the seventeen thou sand and odd troops of the imperial army who have"], [689, "1841.] 209 TO THE EMPEROR. been appointed to defend this post, possess officers who have had long experience in the army, and both they and the common men most nobly risked their lives, yet, alas ! the ground in the neighbour hood of Canton is not fitted for giving battle : it is difficult there to pitch so much as a camp, and what between the heat and the moisture, if (troops) re main there long, they are sure to have a deal of sickness ; putting out of view those we left in gar rison at Fatshan and Shihmun, of the rest we can only use some seven or eight out of every ten. And upon this occasion, when the foreign ships advanced in a long unbroken line, and attacked the city, our officers and people, though they exerted themselves most valiantly, and quite regardless of their per sonal safety, struggled hard with them for several days and nights ; yet, alas ! the native traitors, fan ning and inflaming the minds of people on one hand, while on the other the foreign banditti, having ef fected a landing on the southern side, and having in their possession all the roads and heights north of the city, whence they looked down upon us, the whole provincial city was before their eyes, and the danger was indeed most imminent ! \" We your slaves, having been fed and reared by the bounty of your majesty, and having further re ceived your majesty's commands to proceed hither for the defence of the frontier, what need there for the slightest commiseration should our single lives be lost, (in the discharge of our duty ;) but remem- VOL.

Moreover, a provincial city is a most im portant position ! in it are all the granaries, trea sures, and state prisons, (of the whole province,) and these are of the utmost consequence to us ! Should such an important position once be lost through remissness, difficult would it be to recover it; in the meantime, our native banditti would avail them selves of the opportunity, and start up in every direction, and the entire province would be thrown into commotion ; a contingency which one cannot bear to contemplate. \u25a0 To sum up the whole, it being impossible, to all appearances, that we could have held out the city much longer, and the consternation of the peo ple increasing every day, the inhabitants came one on the heels of another, and with much weeping and wailing, begged that we would take measures to save their lives. We, your slaves, thought over the subject a third and fourth time, and we came to the conclusion, that, if we did not make some temporary arrangement, matters were likely to get ten times worse than they were, and so, in like proportion, should we find it difficult to exculpate ourselves from our increase of crime. If, however, before making these arrangements, we had not laid a statement before your majesty, and waited the imperial pleasure before presuming to act, we beg to"], [691, "1841.] 211 TO THE EMPEROR. assure your majesty, that it was owing to the ex treme urgency of the case, which would not admit of any delay. We humbly confess that we have erred and blundered in every particular, so that had we a hundred mouths, we could not plead exemp tion from the consequences of our grievous crimes. We therefore beg an imperial decree that we be handed over to the board of punishment to be most severely dealt with.\" SECOND SUPPLEMENTARY MEMORIAL TO THE PRE- CEDING. \" And further, Canton has held commercial inter course with all foreign countries for about two hun dred years, and our Hong merchants, having had dealings with the foreign merchants for such a length of time, the debts which the former owe to the latter have in consequence become very large. On various occasions the foreigners have petitioned that these might be repaid, and the different Hoppos have always at the time deprived those Hong mer chants who were most deeply indebted, of their office, and cast them into prison, apportioning the claims to be paid back by the other Hong merchants in instalments, as is duly recorded. Such has hitherto been the mode of procedure. \" Now, however, the original Hong merchant. Woo Pingkeen (old Howqua) and others, have peti tioned, setting forth, that ' formerly, when the English carried on trade, we (the Hong merchants) p 2"], [692, "[1841. 212 MEMORIAL OF YISHAN owed them accumulated sums ; and although it had been fully understood and agreed upon, that we were to pay them by instalments in a certain num ber of years, yet the English trade having been stopped since the year 1839 up to the present mo ment, we have never been able to clear off the debt. Now, having received your excellency's commands to examine how we may most speedily clear off these accounts, how dare we, under such circumstances, procrastinate in the slightest or make vain excuses ? Besides our own ways and means, when strained to the very uttermost, we are still in arrears two mil lions eight hundred thousand taels ; and as matters are very urgent, and the different tea and silk mer chants have all gone away for a time, we have really no way of borrowing the money ; we can only beg that your excellencies will be graciously pleased to lend us the said sum of two millions eight hun dred thousand taels, out of the monies in the public treasury, with which we shall clear off these foreign claims; and we, the Hong merchants, shall lay aside the consoo fund arising from our respective shares of foreign trade, and pay the same back by instal ments in the course of four years;' and words to that effect. \" Your slaves deliberated upon the matter a third and fourth time, and it appeared to us, that, though this is merely a debt of the Hong merchants, yet at the present moment it is ultimately bound up with the question at issue with the foreigners: and"], [693, "1841.] 213 TO THE EMPEROR. should we make the slightest mistake, (in refusing the request,) it might lead to the most fatal conse quences. So we judged it best to acquiesce, and send the Hong merchants the sum required, to be repaid by instalments within the time agreed upon ; and we conceive that we have good security for the ultimate recovery of the same. Therefore, without making further excuses for our own folly and rash ness, we now beg to acquaint your majesty with the circumstance, having previously paid over the said sum to the Hong merchants. These claims being now liquidated, surely the said foreigners can have no further excuse to raise disturbances. \" Besides having duly advised the board of revenue, your slaves now humbly hand up this supplement for imperial inspection. A duly prepared memorial.\" The Chinese lano*ua\u00a3e is said to abound in beauti ful expressions \u2014 that its words indeed are complete pictures, all the characters composing their letters be ing typical. I cannot say quite so much for these translations, although I feel quite satisfied that none of the bombastic or insulting expressions have been allowed to escape. Preparations having been completed this even ing, the requisite orders for storming at dawn, and subsequently at seven a.m. the following day, were issued. At dawn, the ominous white flag was again dis played, and for some hours there had been repeated"], [694, "214 [1841. CHINESE MESSENGER. cries of \" Elliot, Elliot !\" as if he had been their pro tecting joss. The truth immediately flashed on me, and I com municated my suspicions to our chiefs. They would not for an instant admit such an improbable idea ; but I pointed to an officer, at that moment ad vancing towards head-quarters, and observed, \" That officer is the bearer of our destiny.\" It was too true ; the officer had lost himself since ten the preceding evening, and roughed it out in the paddy fields. The despatch was read : dead silence prevailed until it was handed to Sir Le Fleming Senhouse, who immediately said, \" I protest against it !\" The chiefs then retired to their quarters, to deliberate on their replies. Hostilities were sus pended, a sentinel posted on the hill where the general received the despatch, and the flag of truce was planted. The spot is well known as \" Truce Hill.\" The letters of our chiefs were despatched to Cap tain Elliot, but about two that afternoon he arrived at the camp. Sir Le Fleming now lost his spirits, which before were at their highest pitch, and returned to the Blenheim, leaving me at head-quarters. He offered me the charge of the despatches, as the senior com mander, but at the same time pressed the importance of our aid at Amoy ; I therefore resigned in favour of Captain Barlow, of the Nimrod. The terms of the treaty are too well known to need repetition."], [695, "1841.] 215 DEATH OF MAJOR BEECHER. At eleven on Sunday the 30th, as we were rest ing quietly in our quarters, the muster was sounded. All were instantly in motion. The Chinese were noticed advancing from the villages in the N. W. quarter, with banners, shields, and the customary arms of the fishermen and crews of the fast boats. The 26th were advanced on the left, 37th N. I. centre, and 49th kept the heights, edging up the valley. The heat was exceedingly oppressive, and before we had proceeded far, both the general and the quarter master general (Major Beecher) were much incon venienced by it. The general, however, instantly recovered, but Major Beecher was still weak, when they moved forward to a rising ground in the cen tre of the valley, on reaching which Major Beecher fell, and expired, from an attack of apojdexy. A detachment of the 26th, which I joined with my boats' crew, advanced on, and set fire to then advanced post, consisting of two houses in the flat of the paddy fields. It had evidently been occupied as a barrack, as it contained numerous stools and tables. On searching, I could find nothing but two immense coffins, one at each end of the larger house, in cells apparently constructed for them. They were four times the usual size of Chinese coffins, which are generally three feet square. The troops moved off, leaving us to set fire to these houses, which was done effectually ; and just at the moment of reaching the general, two heavy explosions followed."], [696, "[1841. 216 THE LOST COMPANY. These coffins, I am satisfied, contained gunpowder, as the flames were too fierce in all other parts of the bouses for it to have escaped an earlier explosion. The weather, which had been for some time threatening, terminated in heavy rain, quite a deluge. About this time, Captain Knowles, R. A., dropped several rockets very prettily amongst the thickest part of a line of the enemy advancing, and these were followed up by the 26th Cameronians on the left, who pursued them from hill to hill until they reached their village. Here their powder became damp, and their fire-arms were of little use ; they used their bayonets, however, to some purpose, although opposed to the eighteen feet spears of the enemy. One serjeant was shot, and several of the detachment wounded. A spirited young fellow, belonging to one of the opium vessels, (Mr. Georges,) behaved well in this affair, bringing off the serjeant's arms and uniform, to prevent their falling into the hands of the Chi nese. The 37th, on the right, chased the enemy too far, and having separated, lost one company. This was not made known until reaching head quarters, when a detachment of marines, with dry percussion arms, were sent to discover them. At this time the floods had obliterated the paths, and we could barely find our way by daylight. Yet thejolly Royal Marines were successful, and found their friends in square, in the middle of a paddy field, pecked at by the Chinese spears, and nearly overpowered by"], [697, "1841.] 217 CHINESE DOUBLE-DEALINGS. numbers. It is superfluous to tell the tale ; it may readily be guessed. They brought their friends home, and \" spoiled entirely many celestials.\" So well did the Chinese understand the use of the firelock, that one of them snatched one from a soldier, wiped the pan and fresh primed it, and ap plying his own match, shot the officer (Berkeley) through the arm. This act of the marines deserved especial notice. It exhibited more coolness, courage, and judgment, than any advance by day against any odds. The general, accompanied by Captain Elliot, met the Chinese rebel-quelling General Yang, and the Quang-chow-foo, in the hollow between the walls and the quarters, and had a long conversation re specting the withdrawal of the troops, &c. Hardly had they quitted before the Chinese again advanced in the valley, in number about thirteen thousand. As it was useless to trifle longer, and we would be infinitely more secure within the walls of Canton, the general ap prized the Chinese authorities that if any further display took place, he should consider the truce broken, and he must adopt measures for taking pos session of the city. This alarmed them considerably, and special officers were instantly sent to the tur bulent peasantry, to order them to retire. Their obedience appeared for some time doubtful ; the nine-pounder was ordered into position, and rockets prepared, to give them a warning dose ; but they prudently retired. One turbulent leader was dis-"], [698, "218 [1841 ILLNESS. posed to re-light the torch of war, and how anxi ously did some of the spectators look to the result ! Five millions having been embarked, and security obtained for the remainder, the force was ordered for embarkation on the morrow, the Chinese pro viding the necessary coolies for the conveyance of the heavy stores. I had been suffering some days from an injury on my leg, and the wetting of the 30th had increased my illness, so as to require bearers to convey me down. It was material that I should be at the beach for many urgent reasons, but particularly to give the list of the boats in their order for embarkation, my former coadjutor, Major Beecher, having died, and Captain Bourchier being in command of his division. On reaching the Sulphur, I met Sir Le Fleming, who directed me to remain quiet until his return. This was about four o'clock, when I was considerably worse. He was very anxious that I should get down to pilot the Blenheim out ; and sent Nemesis to tow me. As I was too unwell, I despatched Lieutenant Kellett to perform this duty. The troops were duly embarked, and Sulphur moved down. I was too ill to keep the deck, and without her pilot she was several times grounded. At length we reached the Blenheim, off Tiger Island, on the 8th. I was in my cot, frequently delirious, and Sir Le Fleming too ill to call upon me. Alas ! we never met again ! By his late clerk he sent me a confidential order to refit immediately"], [699, "1841.] DEATH OF SIR LE F. SENHOUSE. 219 for Amoy ; and on the 10th I found myself at Hong kong. On the morning of the 13th I was sufficiently well to enjoy the view from my cot, and had my port removed, to watch the Blenheim come to an chor. I had scrawled a few words to Sir Le Flem ing, and just entrusted them to my purser (his late clerk) to deliver. As she anchored, I perceived signals flying, and his ensign dropped. I had been previously apprized that he was very ill, and the pain ful truth at once became apparent. Shortly afterwards my kind friend Captain Bour chier called on me, and related to me the melan choly details, and it was gratifying to me to learn that he maintained, to the last moment, that devo tion to his profession for which I had so much ad mired him. This was the severest loss we had hitherto sus tained. Had Sir Fleming lived, I am confident that the losses of men, officers, and wear of squadron, would have been much lessened, and our next de spatches would have been dated from Amoy or Ningpo. His last words at parting with me on the 1st June were, \" Lose no time in getting down and refitting. I shall send you and Starling to remain at Amoy with one of the sloops. We shall shortly be with you.\" It was the wish of Sir Le Fleming Senhouse to be interred at Macao, and he was accordingly con veyed thither in the Nemesis, and buried with full"], [700, "[1841. 220 SICKNESS AMONG THE TROOPS. military honours, in the presence of all the captains and officers of the squadron who could attend. A handsome monument has been raised by the officers of the combined forces, in testimony of their respect and admiration. Our refit proceeded but slowly ; the sick list in creased rapidly, and in a very short period we had no less than fifty-two incapable of performing duty. The squadron were now so much reduced by sick ness, that all idea of moving was at an end ; and the daily interment of troops and seamen was any thing but cheering to us poor invalids. Oh the 18th, the commodore returned to Macao in the Queen steamer, and having been appointed joint plenipotentiary with Captain Elliot, this was officially promulgated on the 22nd. Various rumours of movements to the north were afloat, and doubtless any active service in a cooler climate would have lessened the mortality. I am confident, therefore, that cruizing would have checked the sickness. It is well known that in cases of cholera occurring in vessels going before the wind, it has been checked by hauling to the wind, and simi lar cases of yellow fever have been noticed. It is probable that the stagnant calms of Hong-kong ac celerated the mortality. On the evening of the 20th, at the moment that we were engaged making preparations for the ex pected typhoon, by getting on board a new anchor and chain cable, it was thought that we were too"], [701, "1841.] 221 THE TYPHOON. near the Blenheim, and a party of hands from that vessel was sent to assist in removing us. The gale increased rapidly from E. S. E. to E. N. E., and about daylight I was informed that we had driven into the hawse of the Charles Grant, a lame fourteen-hundred-ton Indiaman. Being too ill to trust myself on deck, I could only command from the cabin. By breaking her sheer, and sudden veering, we managed to drive clear of her hawse, when a third anchor was let go, the best bower having at the same moment parted. She continued to drift towards a rocky islet known as Green Island, and by the glimpses we occasionally had of the land, we were not far from it. Our last anchor, and new cable, alone held us. At this time the gale was at its height, and the sea clearing everything before it \u2014 over all, and through the hawse-holes, compelling us to batten down. With the danger under our stern, I was asked to cut away the masts. But as I considered that the bow guns and foremast would lighten her suffici ently, orders were given to throw the former over, and after clearing away the rigging, to watch the op portunity of cutting away the stay on the roll to starboard. These orders were not attended to ; every one commenced cutting where he thought best, and the result was, that we lost all our masts, by the foremast falling in board, and the mainstay having been cut. The ship immediately felt the relief."], [702, "222 [1841. DAMAGE SUSTAINED. As the gale abated, that morning, we perceived that we were too close to Green Island ledge, and that much damage had been sustained by the fleet. Some of the merchantmen were totally lost, transports, &c, stranded, and several in the same plight as ourselves. The Royalist, our newly pur chased barque, (of war,) had lost all her masts, and the Starling was missing. About eight, I perceived, through my cabin win dows, signals of distress on the island of Wanchow, and sent a boat to the Cruizer, to request their assist ance, our working boats having been put hors de combat. About noon, the Atalanta and Nemesis were despatched to look after missing vessels and bring off their crews. Our anxiety became very great for our consort, the Starling, and every eye was strained during the day to discover her. Seve ral times fancy had deceived us so far that we had made out her wreck, tents, &c, on the beach. At length a schooner was seen coming through the Cap-sing-raoon, and, to our great relief, the Starling showed her m On Kellett rejoiuirg, I found that she had parted, run through the Cap-sing-moon, made Lher guns fast to the cable, and rode it out under ihe lee of the high land. Hardly had our fears been relieved upon this point, when we noticed an unusual movement amongst the steamers and corvettes, &c, and soon learnt that the Louisa, having on board the two plenipotentiaries,"], [703, "1841.] 223 QUIT HONG-KONG. had quitted Macao in company with the Hebe, on the night of the 20th, to return to Hong-kong, and had not since been heard of. The Hebe had been dis masted and returned to Macao, and the officers came over in another vessel. A little exertion, I imagined, might benefit me ; I therefore went on board the Blenheim, to Captain Herbert, to offer my services in one of the steamers, when I learned that they had been wrecked on one of the southern islands, but for a ransom of three thousand dollars had been safely landed at Macao. As removal to Macao would benefit the crew, by sending them to hospital, the Atalanta was directed to take us in tow immediately, and assist us into the Tepa. We quitted Hong-kong about noon, and reached the mouth of the Tepa at eight that evening, when the steamer having grounded, compelled us to anchor for the night. Here we were just in our own draught, two and a half fathoms over soft mud. Another typhoon came on, but did us no damage. We were not more than a cable Isagtih from ugly rocks astern, but I had great firtl 'ai our new anchor and cable, and had lashed two anchors together to remedy that lost , in addition to which we had no top hamper to bring any strain on them. On the 27th we warped to our anchorage, and I then paid my respects to the plenipotentiaries at Macao, and heard the history of their sufferings. Their treatment by the Chinese was, as usual, bar-"], [704, "224 THE PLENIPOTENTIARIES IN DISTRESS. [1841. barous in the extreme. It appears that, shortly after landing from the wreck, they were providentially recognized by a boatman belonging to Macao, who took them under his protection (?) On opening the village, the usual cry of \" Fanqui ! Fanqui ! \" was set up, and the men rushed forth with threatening ges tures, armed with bill-hooks. The guide, however, soon explained matters, and they were allowed to move forward. At length they commenced rifling the party, and as some oposition was offered, bill books were raised, and the commodore and one of his attendants were knocked down, and stripped. Resistance was vain. At length they were housed for the night, and Captain Elliot agreed to give the boatman two thousand dollars to land them at Macao. A Chinese vessel had been wrecked about the same time, and all the crew were destroyed, and their bodies frightfully lacerated. This raised a sus picion that they had not met fair play. It was not without the greatest difficulty that they could be appeased, and had it not been for their friend the boatman, they would inevitably have been sacrificed, as the people frequently returned to the subject, and went through the motions of sharpening their knives, and making signs of cutting their throats. This doubtless was in aid of the demand for the other thousand dollars, which sum was eventually agreed on. They were to depart in two boats, at daylight on 10"], [705, "1841.] 225 NARROW ESCAPE. the 23rd, and but two in each boat ; the remainder were to be sent for on their reaching Macao. One hundred dollars was also demanded for each of the boats. Further extortionate demands were made, until at length, as they put to sea, their demands increased to two hundred. On their passage they were suddenly concealed, and a mandarin boat passing close alongside, asked several questions, and passed on. What an escape ! What a prize they lost ! Shortly after having opened Macao, they met a Portugese Lorcha, and eager to be relieved from further durance, sprung up and waved to them. Those in the Lorcha, alarmed, and mis taking them for pirates, drew up under arms. How ever, they soon explained matters, and were carried into the inner harbour, where they landed at the Bar Fort. Captain Elliot wore a Manila hat, a jacket, no shirt, a pair of striped trousers, and shoes. The commandant of the fort wished to turn out the guard for the commodore, but this was dispensed with. They were soon in better quarters, and bet ter rigged, enjoying a comfortable meal. What must have been the state of poor Mrs. E., who must have given up her husband as lost ! Strange adventures seldom happen singly.

B., and having on board his Excellency Sir H. Pottinger, Bart, our new and sole plenipotentiary. The Nemesis immediately pro ceeded to her, as the depth would not allow so large a vessel to approach nearer, and by eight o'clock Sir H. Pottinger, Sir W. Parker, and their suites, had landed under a salute from the battery on the Praya Grande. They immediately proceeded to call on Major-General Sir Hugh Gough, who hap pened to be staying for a few days for the benefit of his health at the house of Mr. Matheson, and then proceeded, accompanied by Captain Elliot, to wait upon his excellency the Governor of Macao. I was received very kindly by Sir William Parker, and was assured of accompanying the expedition, if the ship could be masted and re-manned in time.

On the appearance of Sir W. Parker at Hong kong, that place soon presented a scene of unwonted activity. A certain number of transports were placed under the supervision of the captains of the line-of-battle-ships and frigates, and every exertion was made for the earliest departure. On the 9th day after assuming the command, the fleet moved from Hong-kong, bound for Amoy. Previous to quitting Macao, the Quang-chow-foo came in great haste, to obtain an interview with our new plenipotentiary, and probably endeavour to ascertain to what extent they might calculate on his forbearance. He was not received by Sir Henry, but, I believe, saw Major Malcolm, and finally transferred himself to Captain Elliot. This was the first blow to mandarin pride, and rather astonished the high officers at Canton, as well as the tradesmen and lower classes in Macao, who did not fail to talk it over frequently. Finding it impossible to get manned or rigged in time, and the greater part of my crew being in hospital, I was left in charge of the British inte rests at Macao, there to await further instructions."], [710, "230 [ isll. CANTON RIVER. Previous to final departure, the Nemesis conveyed Major Malcolm to Canton, where he delivered letters for the Provincial government, probably announcing the appointment of Sir H. Pottinger as her Majesty's Plenipotentiary. Captain Nias was left in command of the force in Canton river, having under him at Hong-kong tho Herald, Alligator, Hyacinth, Royalist, and Hebe tender. At Macao, Sulphur and Starling. The Atalanta was assigned to convey the commo dore, Sir J. G. Bremer, K. C. B., and Captain Elliot, to Bombay, in order to proceed home overland. They embarked on the 24th. The Sulphur might perhaps have done better had she put to sea, and found her way to Singapore, as there was not the slightest prospect of her crew becoming effective even, if they were immediately returned to duty. Notwithstanding a special proclamation, declaring that any attempts to re-arm the batteries, or impede the navigation of the river, would be treated as acts of hostility, the imperial rebel- quelling general, and his colleagues, immediately set about repairing their defences, constructing new batteries, and effectually closing the approaches to Canton. Another memorial appeared, in which they state that the English foreigners (no longer rebels) have left the provincial river, have given back the forts, and that the militia and volunteers hate slaughtered a great many native traitors, and foreign (?) robbers who were raising disturbances; and that they had 7"], [711, "1841.] CHINESE GASCONADE. 231 restored quiet to the provincial city ; that they had commanded that the English ships should forthwith get up their anchors and depart; that the said foreigners immediately got more than ten sail of their ships under weigh, and left the river when one of their commanders, Warren, petitioned, saying, that the real fact of the matter was, the foreign merchants of every nation were very hard pushed for money, and worrying him for payment of their debts ; that they had no intention whatever to offend, or commit any act of aggression upon the heavenly dynasty, and implored us to supplicate the great emperor to show them mercy, and pardon their offences. ( Very like Warren .') \" Your slave finds,\" it continues, \" that the foreign ships on this occasion bolted into the river by violence, incited by the native traitors showing them the way ;\" (query Sulphur's ?) with other trash. They then finish by stating that hav ing captured two hundred native traitors and fo reigners, black as well as white, among which last were two chief persons, they should be beheaded at Namoan. One of the two chief persons was stated to be Bremer, and that the English were willing to pay one hundred dollars to ransom the body, which they had stowed away in a secluded house, and which they intend to inquire into. Can all this be credited by those who maintain the Chinese higher classes to be a polished nation ? They are indeed the most polished rogues under the sun ; and I am informed that this nephew of the"], [712, "[1841. 232 DUTIES IN PORT. emperor, Yishan, is one of the most grossly re probate characters that has entered Canton. The fleet having proceeded to the capture of Amoy, Ningpo, Chinhae, &c, as we were not eye witnesses, I must refer my readers to the Gazettes for particulars. Amoy fell on the 26th of August ; Chusan on the 1st of September ; Chinhae on the 10th ; and Ningpo on the 13th. Our duties, in addition to those customary to ships in port, were particularly directed to the sup pression of supplies of ordnance, small arms, and ammunition to the Chinese. These were imported into Macao, nominally to Portuguese merchants, but sold to the Chinese, and shipped off by night to Canton. The importations were in British vessels, and I wish I could have the satisfaction of clearing my mind from the conviction that British agency was not actively interested. The embarkations took place at the ports of Madras and Singapore. Un fortunately I was too late in the case of the Sesos tris, or I should have detained that vessel until the decision of the Admiral authorised their being landed. They were landed at the Custom-house, and so much had been said about them, that during our stay they were not removed. Indeed, I kept a constant guard over them, day and night, and had they been found in a Chinese vessel, out of the waters of Macao, they would have been instantly captured. Having been ordered over to Hong-kong upon"], [713, "1841.] THE RIVER STAKED. 233 some trivial duty, and given the guard, the Sesos tris evaded our guard-boat, and as I had been in formed that she had muskets and ammunition still on board, we were despatched to examine her. We found her at Whampoa, but the search was fruitless. During my stay at Whampoa, I learned from seve ral gentry just returned from Canton, \" that the Chi nese had effectually staked the river at Howqua's Folly, and that even boats passed with difficulty.\" No measures were taken to examine the other channel ; indeed, Captain Nias had given me express orders \"not to look into these matters.\" It is not probable that Canton will again be approached by our ships, unless nature makes some violent effort to clear a new channel. I hear it constantly observed that \"the wet sea son will carry all before it.\" When does this wet season occur? We have now been within Canton river since the 13th of December last, and have not witnessed any extraordinary freshes, nor anything approaching the power alluded to. That a channel would very soon be opened if re quired, I should be very sorry for one instant to doubt, and I should be too happy to prove the question. \" Impossibilities \" of such a nature do but sharpen one's wits. I was surprised one day by a note from Mr. J. Matheson, announcing his wish to see me at Macao ; and still more so, on my arrival at his house, at the perusal of a letter from Captain Dicey, of the late"], [714, "234 [1841. WRECK OF THE MADAGASCAR. Honorable East India Company's steamer Madagas car, which had quitted me but a few nights pre- vious, bound to the north, and having on board my old friend Captain Grattan, 18th Royal Irish, charged with despatches for the plenipotentiary from Lord Auckland. It reported their wreck near Namo, with himself, Captain Grattan, twelve Euro- peans, and thirty Lascars, and begged for assistance. It further stated, that they had called themselves Americans, in order to prevent their immediate mas- sacre, or until they fell under the protection of a mandarin. So far, perhaps, their lives were saved ; but it is deeply to be lamented that so soon as they found themselves in the power and under the pro- tection of the mandarin, who evidently knew that they were English, they did not declare their true colours, and call upon their own country for inter- ference. Still it is difficult to decide how the ma jority would act under the pressure of the moment, and probably without much time for consultation. Doubtless, there were individuals of the party high- minded enough to sacrifice themselves without hesi- tation, to a sense of honour, but they might feel considerable difficulty in involving forty-one others, who must inevitably share his or their fate. Everything which could be done under the cir cumstances was most cheerfully and zealously en tered on by Mr. Matheson, one of the most spirited as well as influential merchants at Macao. Nothing, however, can be done expeditiously (short of losing"], [715, "1841.] UPROAR AT CANTON. 235 life) in China, and we had, therefore, patiently to await the result of the system adopted. Society in Canton appears to be completely un hinged, and all respect to the local authorities at an end. The feeling against the war barbarians also is very inveterate, and this was lately vented in an extraordinary manner against the old Quang-chow foo, (supposed friend of the English.) It ap pears that Yu Paoushun, the prefect of Canton, decked with his (new) peacock's feather, pro ceeded, in the due course of custom and duty, to the great hall of examination, where the literary candidates had assembled for their annual exercises. On his entry, some of these high-spirited gentry became restive, showed symptoms of discontent, and eventually began to ridicule. For this they were called to order, and sharply reprimanded ; whereupon the public voice broke forth ; they be came clamorous, began to hiss, called his honour a traitor, and hurled their inkstones * at his head. Unable to withstand such missiles, the old gentle man determined to withdraw ; but on leaving the hall, one of the most daring of the malcontents at tempted to break his sedan-chair. A great disturb ance ensued. The Nanhae-heen, (magistrate of the district of Nanhae,) who is second in authority to the prefect, then came forw*ard, soothed these excited literati, and begged them to come again next day * Slate slabs for Indian ink, weighing half a pound to one pound each."], [716, "236 [1*41 WAR-JUNKS. for examination, when the commissioner of justice would come to the hall. On the 18th, the prefect had resolved to resign his office, which immediately followed.* The fast boats, war junks, tea boats, trading junks, &c, have been frequently alluded to. I therefore deem it right to insert their descriptions separately in the following order. First, \" The war junk,\" which may be very readily conceived by supposing the wood-cut beneath, which represents the large trad ing junk to have guns allotted to her painted ports. TRADING JUNK. Abaft the mainmast, however, in those intended for war vessels is an arched cabin, the roof of which rises about four feet above the deck, and its deck * Chinese Rep."], [717, "1841.] 237 SALT-JUNKS. is about the same depth below the upper deck. No guns are mounted abaft the mainmast. They oc cupy the space between the fore and mainmasts. The cabin arch is continued aft about ten feet, forming a deck magazine, which, of course, is very liable to accident, and any rockets striking that part of the vessel, must inevitably cause an explosion. Indeed, one may almost say that from the loose manner in which their ammunition is made up, and frequently filled as required, that a train is always laid from this magazine to the guns, which might be ignited, even by a rocket passing over that part of the deck. A second war junk is frequently fitted from a fishing vessel, or \" salt junk,\" similar to the annexed wood-cut, and merely has four or six guns mounted to fire over all. SALT JUNK OR FISHING JUNK."], [718, "238 [1841 FAST BOATS. The fast boat, which may be appropriately termed the war galley, varies in length from fifty to ninety feet, and pulls from thirty to sixty oars. They are fitted much in the same style as the Spanish Scam- pavias, being hatched, where each pair of rowers sit, and armed with one or two brass guns in the bow. They have also six or eight gingals, mounted on the gunwales, which carry a leaden ball of two ounces. The crew are dressed with short blue shirts, loose short trousers, and conical caps, the latter formed of a basket work of rattan, which re- sists the blow of a cutlass, and are generally painted red and white. Their shields, which are formed of the same material, and painted with various de vices, are about three feet in diameter : they fancied them ball proof, but were sadly mistaken. This same description of vessel is that used for FAST BOAT OR SMUGGLER."], [719, "1841.] 239 TEA BOATS. smuggling opium, and which frequently, from their superior class of crew, compel the mandarin fast boats to make the best of their way for shelter. The annexed wood-cut represents the vessel ; the arms may be seen in the plate, where the gingal is also in use. The \" tea boat\" is calculated principally for river navigation, and is generally about one hundred feet in length by twenty wide. They are fitted with a substantially built arched roof, having a sliding arch abaft the mast, which admits of loading. This arch slides closely in grooves, which renders it rain proof. I found these vessels would conveniently accom modate one hundred and twenty men each. TEA BOAT. The sampan is very similar to a boat cut in twain with a stern fitted inside the planking ; its greatest"], [720, "240 [IS41 RECEIVE OUR RELEASE. breadth being at the stern, which forms a semicircle. One is shown stern on in the wood-cut of the trad ing junk. They are navigated by Tartar women, who entirely live in them at night ; they are housed by a sliding bamboo arch, which is pushed back, like scales, by day. On the 14th of November, her Majesty's ship Larne arrived from Chusan and Ningpo, bringing the lately promoted captains and other officers from the squadron, on their homeward passage. By her I received my release, with a private note from the admiral; but my little consort, the Starling, was to be paid off, her crew transferred to the Sulphur, and Captain Kellett to re-man her by volunteers from the merchantmen, and join the admiral, for survey ing service. To me this detention would perhaps have been less felt ; but Kellett had so long set his heart on home and arranging his affairs, that he was any thing but gratified ; although it would probably en sure his further promotion. His separation from me was a still greater blow, all our operations for the last six years having been carried on so entirely in conjunction, that they could only be unravelled by our united efforts ; and as he was my only actual assistant, I was thus left burthened with the whole labour of the expedition, as well as our Chinese surveys, which even our united endeavours could not possibly \" lick into shape \" before the return of the ship ; independent of the necessary writing and cal culations."], [721, "1841.] 241 SAIL FROM MACAO. But the fiat had issued, and it was idle to repine. It was perhaps of equal, if not of more importance, that his services should be available during the present opening of China. I therefore determined, in compliance with the admiral's wishes, to render him as complete as either public or pri vate means would admit, for his own cruize, and made up my mind to the separation. To those only who know how much we were together, or in com munication, since 1831, can this feeling be under stood. Having rated our chronometers, and obtained our final observations at Macao, we took leave of our kind and hospitable friends, and wishing \" better luck still\" to our nurseling, now left to shift for herself, quitted, on the 21st of November, with a strong breeze from the northward. After having passed Pulo Sapata, the breeze falling light, we hauled to the westward, ran over the Charlotte bank in fifteen fathoms, and were driven by light airs and currents over to the Anam bas, on one of the islands of which (Pulo Domar) I landed, in order to secure its position, which agreed pretty well with that assigned to it in the charts. The islands, I since find, have been very closely surveyed by the French expedition, under Laplace. The rock, or island of Domar, (? Pulo do Mar, of Portuguese origin ?) is a lofty limestone elevation, of one hundred and fifty feet, and in fine weather, safe and convenient landing may be found on its south- VOL. II.

At low water, my gig without her crew could barely reach the nearest rocks. Nothing worth notice occurring here, we shaped our course to weather Pulo Aor, and sighted it, bear ing away for the straits of Singapore. On the following morning we found ourselves drifted far to leeward on the Bintang shore, and were unable, by reason of light baffling winds, to reach into the straits until the evening of the 4th of December, when, with a fresh breeze at N.

On the master attendant visiting, I learned that my good friend the governor (Mr. Bonham) had embarked in a merchant ship, in order to visit Pinang, and other parts of his government, and was then underweigh, departing. After paying him my farewell visit, we anchored about eight, in the roads, where I found the United States frigate Constellation, 38, bearing the broad pendant of Com modore Kearney, and the Boston corvette, Comman der Low, on their way to Manila and China, and at this critical moment of dispute with America, not very opportune visitors. However, being in a British port, they were guests, and I lost no time in calling on them, and was much pleased with their acquaintance."], [723, "1841.] 243 STEAM VESSELS. I took up my old quarters at the recorder's house, and had the satisfaction of finding, after twelve months interval, that my instruments continued to afford satisfactory results. Since my last visit, my good friend Lieut. Elliot had completed his observa tory, and had been now nearly a year in activity. As not a letter for any individual on board was re ceived here, it was a rich treat to be able to talk over with him all that had been done, was in pro gress, and talked of, during our almost banishment. I also had the pleasure of making the acquaint ance of Mr. Ballister (the American consul) and his wife, and in company with the commanders of the American vessels of war, passed a very agreeable day. On the day we arrived, the Medusa, Hon. East India Company's steamer, was noticed outside, and coals having been sent out to her, she paddled into, the anchorage. This vessel, with the Ariadne, of similar construc- tion, quitted this port some time since, to join the fleet in China. They reached within two hundred miles of Manila, when their coal being expended, the Ariadne was signalled to return to this port, and the Medusa reached Manila. There she ob- tained a small supply of refuse coal and wood, and made an attempt to reach Macao. She was in sight ; but having burned all her bulwarks, fittings, &c, and having no anchors or cables sufficiently long and strong to hold her in deep water, she bore up for Singapore. The Ariadne not having appeared, she r 2"], [724, "[1841. 244 SCANTY SUPPLY OF STORES. was deemed lost, and as the present season rendered it impossible for the Medusa to make asecond attempt, as well as orders from the governor general having arrived to recal her, she was refitted, and sent to Moulmein, to join the force watching that port. The Ariadne subsequently reached Manila, having ob tained wood in Borneo. We were detained some days at Singapore, wait ing for bread, which could only be baked (by the Chinese) at the rate of one thousand pounds per day, and the American ships, supplied by the same parties, were also detained for the same reason. Although a free port, and abounding generally with stores, there are but few fit for a ship of war. No cordage fit to reeve could be found ; which, considering the great influx of ships connected with the China expe dition, rather indicates want of judgment in the mer chants, as I am satisfied large sums would have been realized by shipping it on to Macao. European rope at one period fetched as much as twenty dollars per pecul (of one hundred and thirty-two pounds;) spars fit for mainmasts of vessels of five to six hundred tons, twelve to fifteen hundred dollars each. At the moment that we were in distress for masts, I ex amined a junk's mast, offered for sale, which would not make us either fore or main mast, but for which they asked twelve hundred dollars.

These are points which all travellers or voyagers bound this way should be apprised of. It is possible that these wants may soon be remedied, and probably an overstocked market will be the re sult. The climate of Singapore is reckoned warm, but particularly healthy. Although nearly on the equator, invalids from other tropical regions frequent this spot. The temperature seldom ranges above 82\u00b0, during their cool or rainy season. But this term is scarcely justifiable, seeing that the rain merely falls in showers, and seldom exceeds half an hour in dura tion; they are, indeed, merely refreshing showers. The average fall of rain during the year is ninety inches. February, March, and April are considered the hottest months ; April until October those lia ble to rain, \u2014 when, for the instant, it descends in heavy volume. The formation may be considered granite, iron and red sandstone, and vegetable matter mixed with coralline debris. This latter occurs particularly in the region where the magnetic observatory is situated, and as far inland as w'here the American consul re sides, and in all probability is the cause of the earlier putrefaction of the water in wells or stag nant pools. Lumps of scoriaceous iron present themselves here and there, evidently exhibiting some violent convulsion, which has entirely upset all attempts to pursue stratification. The soil produces sugar-cane, cotton, coffee, pep-"], [726, "246 [1841 HOSPITALITY. per, cloves, nutmeg, betel-nut, cinnamon, cocoa, maize, pine-apples, (a perfect weed) plantains, figs, and the usual kitchen garden produce, which the Chinese rear very plentifully. The customary conveyances are palanquins, drawn by ponies, as well as gigs, and open phaetons, &c, belonging to private individuals. The customary hire of the palanquin is one dollar per day. The town contains three hotels. That most fre quented, and maintained in the best style, is kept by Mr. Dutronquoy. It is in exterior more like a palace than an inn. There are table d'hotes and con veyances provided. Expenses are similar to those of all hotels out of England : dollars here are as rapidly consumed as shillings in England. The residents are extremely hospitable; they generally dine at four, and little formality is observed. The fashion indeed prescribes white jackets, and the punkah is as indispensable as in India. Meat and poultry are expensive, for the country, being dearer than in our English markets. Water is supplied to the shipping by tank-vessels, at the rate of one dollar per ton ; beef at eleven and a half cents ; biscuits, four and a half cents ; fuel, three and a half dollars for one thousand billets. Late on the evening of the 17th December, we quitted Singapore with very light airs, and having rounded Barn Island, anchored until daylight. As soon as the tide permitted, we moved on ; but at a very slow pace, and did not reach Malacca until"], [727, "1841.] 247 MALACCA. the morning of the 20th, when we anchored about eight o'clock in three and a half fathoms, close off the fishing stakes, and most fortunately succeeded in obtaining a suite of observations, which detained us until midnight. I called on the resident councillor, Hon. Mr. Sal mond, and as my time did not admit of dinner par ties, devoted an hour to tea and conversation. Every civility was tendered by the residents ; but as our visit was purely to obtain the magnetic data and meridian distance, delay was out of the question. At four a.m., we weighed, and quitted Malacca, not without regret at our inability to accept or re turn the civilities proffered, or to make an excursion into the interior. Malacca is very prettily situated on a well wooded mound or clump, on the summit of which stand the fort, signal-post, and stadt-house ; the other houses surrounding the base on its outer or southern segment, extending about half a mile in distance, and skirted by villas right and left. The river divides the town at the base of the stadt-house, or governor's residence. It is navigable at high water for small vessels, but at low water boats cannot approach within half a mile of the beach, by reason of the mud flat. Light baffling airs did not permit our making much progress, and during the calms the dredge obtained us many very interesting objects in con chology."], [728, "[1841. 248 PINANG. On the 26th of December we sighted Pinang, and on the night following, having despatched the master ahead in the gig, to show lights on the re quisite spot, we anchored in ten fathoms, about ten p.

On the following morning, we were visited by the master attendant, and at eight I landed at the Admiralty-house, which I found occupied by our kind friend Mr. Bonham, (the governor of Singapore, Pinang, &c.) until his house was vacated by the resident councillor; I therefore became bis guest, and made my arrangements for completing my ob servations in the garden of that establishment. As Pinang has been so often described by former visitors, I shall dwell but shortly on it beauties. The town is situated on a low delta, the northern face of which is occupied by the fort, Admiralty house, and private residences ; and the eastern by the town. The sides of this delta occupy about two miles on the sea faces, and perhaps more on the land from whence the mountains spring. This level triangular space is traversed by most excellent roads, well sheltered by trees of luxuriant growth principally of the cocoa-nut, betel, palm, and bam boo. It is customary to drive out on these roads between the hours of four and seven, terminating usually at the jetty or promenade, at the eastern apex of the triangle, to talk scandal, &c, until seven, the customary hour for dinner. The town contains the usual well-built public offices,"], [729, "1842.] 249 BEL RETIRO. shops of all trades (chiefly Chinese) innumerable ; with the addition of the usual quantum of filth, &c, which one generally encounters wherever the Chi nese are located. On new year's day I accompanied the governor on a visit to Mr. Garling, (the resident councillor, or governor, in the absence of Mr. Bonham,) residing at Bel Retiro, the government house, or proper re sidence of the governor, which occupies the second hill in height on the island. We quitted the Admiralty-house about half-past six in the morning, in a palanquin carriage, which conveyed us to the foot of the hill, where we mounted our steeds, stubby ponies, about fourteen hands high, not much inclined to move out of a snail's pace. The road was very steep, and the exertion of keeping the saddle for one hour up so tedious a zig-zag path, was infinitely greater than walking. However, as I took with me a mountain barometer and other instruments, the motion was certainly easier on horseback. About eight we reached the summit, where we found a most agreeable tempera ture of 71\u00b0, and a still more agreeable party to wel come us. The whole house, or pair of houses connected by a covered way or open room, about one hundred and fifty feet in length, was most tastefully decorated with flags, wild flowers, and painted devices, by the younger damsels ; also with native flowers of the island.

I really began to fancy that we had approached home some what suddenly, and the kindness and attentions of our host's lady and visitors very soon made me forget that I was still a wanderer. We remained the night in this delicious retreat, (dancing until eleven,) and enjoying a temperature of 66\u00b0,5 ; and at daylight commenced our descent. Bel Retiro is situated two thousand five hundred feet above the level of the sea, and perched on the second highest of the several nipples which crown this range, and on most of which are snug little re treats, forming sylvan palaces. It commands a very extensive view, but, from its elevation, is subject to frequent visitations of fog and rain, which to those unaccustomed to dwell in heights must be visited to be appreciated \u2014 -felt would be a better term; a fog being literally a vapour-wave, pervading hori zontally, and only to be kept out by closed doors and windows.

On a hill, not much beyond musket range be neath, but which took longer to travel, is situated the house of his Honour, the recorder, to whom we paid a visit, as well as to other beauties surrounding this agreeable retreat. After experiencing much kindness and attention from Mr. Bonham, I took my leave on the night of the 3rd of January, aided by a fresh land breeze which carried us clear of the land before midnight."], [731, "1842.] 251 DEEP-SEA DREDGING. Our course was shaped to sight Pulo Pera, which we passed within four miles on the noon following. Here the breeze slackened, and we floundered through calms and rains, until noon of the 6th, when we made the N.E. angle of Sumatra, near Cape Diamond. Had the weather been propitious, it was my intention to have fixed its position, but this was now given up. As we were just in one hundred fathoms of water, and becalmed, the dredge was put over to try for anything living at that depth. We were particu larly successful in obtaining live specimens of tere bratula, chama, minute shells, echini, and asteria; temperature of sea at surface 82\u00b0, eighty fathoms below 55\u00b0. Light baffling airs prevented our progress until the 9th, when we reached Pulo Bouro (or Malora of the charts) at sunset, and fearing some loss of time or difficulty in landing at Acheen, I examined the island, and finding it suit my purpose, anchored in order to secure the meridian distance, as well as making it my main position for fixing the Golden Mountain. At our anchorage the current was found to set one and a half mile per hour west until midnight, when it changed, having the same velocity, to E.N.E. On the morning following we landed, and having completed our observations by sunset, bore away for Acheen, distant about ten miles. We anchored for"], [732, "252 [1842. ACHEEN. the night, but shifted as close in as safety permitted the following morning, or within the influence of the river current, which perceptibly discoloured the sea, and although distant about three quarters of a mile from its mouth, the water was fresh on the surface within a cable's length of the ship. The entrance to the river is very shallow for two hundred yards from its mouth, and at its deepest part on the bar, has only three feet six inches at low water. As the flood never overcomes the force of the stream, although the level rises, a constant series of overfalls or small rollers result, tending rather to cause doubts in strangers as to the safety of landing. This, with chronometers and valuable instruments at stake, became matter for considera tion. For this reason, I deemed it prudent to transfer the more important articles to a larger boat, and move in with my gig, (a very full whale boat,) and if safe, signalise the cutter to follow. On entering these petty rollers, I found that they as sisted us much in our progress against the swift current, and once within the bar, that we were quite in still water. Having a letter for the sultan of Acheen from the governor of Pinang, stating the object of our visit, I had determined on delivering it ; but finding the distance to his town great, the stream rapid, and moreover, time precious, I was glad to put off this ceremony, despatching it by one of his rajahs. Our signal soon brought the boat in, and the tents, &c,"], [733, "1842.] MESSAGE FROM THE SULTAN. 253 were pitched upon a low sandy point, unfortunately containing a large proportion of iron sand. I was visited shortly by a rajah, by whom I was informed that I might expect a reply in the evening. A Moulmein vessel, commanded by a Portuguese half-caste, happening to be in the river, I was for tunate enough to obtain his services as an interpre ter. In the evening, one of the sultan's household visited us, with a message from his master, as well as a present of a bullock and some fruit for the ship's company, also intimating that \"the sultan would be glad to see me, and that orders had been given to see our wishes attended to on the beach.\" A message was returned, that I would visit him on the morrow*, before noon. Fortunately, although surrounded by these half pirates, who were, from the boys upwards, armed with kris, dagger, or scymitar, (the latter used for hatchet or any other purpose, and a very formidable weapon,) we were enabled to keep them at a very fair distance, and found them less troublesome than more civilised nations, \u2014 who, knowing the incon venience of causing the ground to vibrate, or ap proaching the magnetic instruments with weapons or iron, would frequently intrude or walk about, to our manifest discomforture. Indeed, I have gene rally found that a lead line marking the boundary of approach, has been more efficient than the armed sentinel. Having remained on shore during the night, and"], [734, "254 [1842. ASPECT OF THE RIVER. completed the necessary series of observations before nine the next morning, malgre the torture of myriads of mosquitoes and sand-flies, I set off in my gig, accompanied by the surgeon and our interpreter, to pay my respects to his highness. For the first mile we found both sides of the river marshy, and the river itself, which is about sixty yards across, obstructed by sand knolls ; but passing these, the banks at the sides of the river be come firm, of solid red earth or clay, with well beaten footpaths within a few yards of the banks. The scenery is picturesque, with several spots of cleared level ground, and detached grassy islets. About two miles from the entrance, where the large trees overhang the river, we noticed several large buildings, and were hailed by the sultan's man of business, who visited us yesterday, and who beckoned us to land at a small country or summer house belonging to his highness, where he had ap pointed to meet us. We were ushered into a small divan ascended by a flight of steps, which strongly reminded one of a warder's post, being situated immediately above the gate. This appeared to have been recently fitted up with shawls, rugs, and pieces of old finery, for the occasion. The state-chair, intended doubtless for his highness, had a worked crimson seat, em broidered with tinsel and pieces of looking-glass, intended probably to represent jewels. In the main square stood a very respectable house, in the Moorish"], [735, "1842.] SULTAN'S FAMILY. 255 style, of three stories, with very wide eaves to each, decreasing to the upper, which might be one fourth the capacity of the ground floor. This, doubtless, was their mosque, as at the time of prayer we saw them wash at the adjoining cistern, and return to the lower building, which they told us was for prayer. The persons who showed themselves at the upper windows, we were informed, were soldiers. Other offices completed the square, in which the retinue of all descriptions appeared to have some particular station. That on the right was occupied entirely by children of his royal highness, and not a scanty brood, considering they were only the males. These appearances gave me but a poor idea of the state of this prince, and as I had arranged mat ters to return to my observatory again before three, I began at noon to be rather impatient at the neg lect of his royal highness, and more particularly at the want of dinner for my boat's crew, which I had fully calculated on being properly entertained. Upon expressing my anxiety upon this subject, I was coolly informed that his royal highness might be down about four o'clock, after prayers ; I there fore decided on going to him, and thus obtaining a sight of the town. We accordingly pulled up the river, which presented no further variation than a few cleared spots on the banks. Arriving at a small creek, pointed out by our guide as the nearest landing to the village, we walked a short distance through roads and grass,"], [736, "[1842 256 THE SULTAN'S HAUTEUR. rather miry from rain, which was then falling, until we reached the bazaar on the outskirts, which did not seem either to be well supplied, or to offer any thing very tempting. Passing this, we at length came to the entrance gate of the sultan's grounds, which exhibited in the smaller doorway a brass six pounder field gun. Here we were forbidden en trance, and as it rained, were offered a shed for shelter, which was already fully occupied by a set of dirty idle fellows, mixed with the guard, in their turbans of crimson woven with gold cord, and pro bably awaiting their master's movements. This, however, I thought too great a degradation, and accordingly declined. Finding that they closed the gate, and intended keeping us waiting, (how long seemed doubtful,) I sent a message to his highness, acquainting him that as I had come to visit him, and he had not the civility to afford me proper shelter from the rain, I should return to my ship. Indeed, I saw no friendly disposition evinced by his people, and as the act of making me wait would gratify them, \u2014 and I had before been given to under stand that he delighted in aping the sovereign, I determined to show how little I cared for him or them, well knowing that humility would very soon appear on the opposite side. I therefore carelessly returned, examined the ba zaar, and then moved on to my boat. But just as I had seated myself, a messenger arrived to recall me, 8"], [737, "1842.] 257 REPAID IN HIS OWN COIN. stating that the sultan was on his way to see me. I determined not to subject myself to a second dis appointment, and further I did not believe his emissary. However, to test his sincerity, I desired him to tell his master, \" that if he was desirous of see ing me, I should meet him at his country-house where he had appointed, provided he was there when my boat reached it ;\" and to afford him full time, I drifted down stream, looking out for birds, &c, on the banks. As he had not arrived by the time we reached the place, we passed on, landed, and shot several very handsome birds. One very beautiful species of bird of paradise, furnished with long curled fea thers, in addition to the wing coverts, flew across the river, but we were unable to get a shot at it. Whilst thus engaged, a special ambassador, at tended by a large party, came suddenly upon us with fresh importunities to return ; but the only answer I could give was, \" that as my time was of the utmost importance to me, his highness would find me at the beach, or on board my ship, and that I begged to assure him that he would neither be denied admittance, shelter, or the hospitality due to his rank ; moreover, that it would probably be the last captain of a British ship of war who would condescend to call upon him after such want of courtesy on his part.\" Thus ended our communication. The chiefs on the beach paid us more attention. Fowls, -fee*. VOL. II. s"], [738, "[1842. 258 FISHING IMPLEMENTS. were brought for sale, and had we remained, doubt less we should have received the sultan on board. Time, however, was too precious, as we had much yet to complete at the island of Bouro. Our tents were therefore struck, and by dark we were on our return to our former position, where we anchored early next morning. On our return down the river we called at a small fisherman's retreat, where we found their lines and nets suspended to dry. The nets were of very fine thread, very beautifully worked, and must have been the result of great labour. I inquired, from curi osity, what they would require for the one before me, about thirty feet long, by thirty yards in cir cumference ; the reply was, thirty dollars. Labour, therefore, is not cheap in this region. I was particularly struck with the peculiarity of fitting their fishing lines, being precisely the same method as that adopted by the Indians of the eastern coast of America, viz., by a swivel and piece of horn above the lead, which prevents the bait from getting foul. I borrowed th*e invention from the Indians of Nova Scotia, and although I have everywhere strictly scrutinized the peculiarities of fishing imple ments, have not before seen it imitated. Had we noticed it in Behring's Straits, or the northern Asiatic regions, it would not have appeared so strange, as the Malays are well known to have car ried their depredations into the northern parts of Tartary, and thence it would easily have been copied into Siberia."], [739, "1842.] 259 LARGE CANNON. I thought it rather strange, that although a paper was presented by the captain of the port, stating that supplies, refreshments, water, &c, were all to be obtained, nothing could be procured until the moment of embarkation, and then but a scanty supply. On the first day, I noticed that every person came armed, and generally dressed in full costume. But on the last day few were so accoutred. Several lines of old encampments, as well as heavy brass guns, were observed near the beach, and one very large gun at the town, said to be of suffi cient diameter to admit a man on his hands and knees. I despatched one of the officers, Mr. Selwyn, mate, to examine those immediately in our rear. He was shown a large gun, of fourteen inches bore, and measuring twenty-three feet, and several others were said to lie concealed by the jungle. It was brass, of good workmanship, and had characters on it resembling Malay ; but the natives did not under stand them. Several of the chiefs were anxious that we should visit their divisions of the country, where every arti cle of supply would be abundantly forthcoming ; at the same time intimating their independence of the sultan. One in particular spoke very good English, and stated his prices, which were much more reason able than those at Acheen. A superior rajah visited me the first day, elegantly attired. He was very gentlemanly in his manners, called himself a s 2"], [740, "[1842. 260 OBSERVATIONS. lieutenant of the rajah's but not tinder his control; and wrote down my name, as well as that of the ship, in English. I wished him to accompany me the next day, to interpret, but he shook his head rather significantly ; intimating that he was not ambitious of the honour. I interpreted it, disincli nation to jeopardise his freedom. Having reason to doubt our observations on Acheen sand, I determined to renew them on Bouro, where the central position on the island might afford me more satisfactory results. I found, how ever, that the rocks all, more or less, affected the needles, as in the case of most volcanic formations. The principal object of my visit to Acheen was com pletely effected, and we were unusually fortunate in such operations ; having experienced fine weather, and rapid transit from station to station. By the astronomical and chronometric bases both coincid ing, the Golden Mountain is situated in latitude 5\u00b0,21',26\",5, (Horsburgh 5\u00b0,27',0) and longitude 95\u00b0,44/55\" E., (Horsburgh 95\u00b0,49/0) its elevation is eight thousand two hundred and eighty-three feet above mean tide level, differing but thirty-three feet at the extreme stations.

POINT DE GALLE. CHAPTER VIII. On the 14th January we quitted Bouro, and shaped our course for Point de Galle, the southern most port in Ceylon. Strong north-easterly breezes favoured us, with a good offing. On the night of the 17th, we passed over the position of the Bale of Cotton rock, and steered for the Basses, which we passed about six, on the morning of the 20th. Having steered a course intended to pass close to the southernmost, and possibly fix its position if becalmed, we found ourselves at dawn about fifteen miles off shore, and had drifted considerably to the south-west : about eight, Dondra Head and flagstaff visible N. N.W., and the land about Point de Galle in the western distance. Here we were tan talized, not above twenty miles from our port, with light baffling airs, barely enabling us to stem an easterly current, as well as an offshore set. About eight in the evening, we were visited by a fisherman, who understood English, and having ascertained that we were bound to Galle, he re-"], [745, "1842.] 265 UNPROPITIOUS WEATHER. mained by us, affording us his assistance as a pilo t By four a. m., we reached the outer anchorage, and the breeze failing, dropped our kedge. At daylight, finding that we were not more than eight miles from the shore, and that the sea breeze would not make before noon, I quitted in my gig to examine the place, and seek a suitable position for my tents. On landing, I proceeded to call on the military commandant, Major Darby Griffiths, of the 90th, from whom I experienced much civility, and the utmost readiness to further my pursuits. The posi tion fixed on was the space between the magazine and the rampart on the Utrecht bastion, free from guns or other iron materials ; the composition of the rocks being either entirely granite, or pure coral limestone. I am, perhaps, tediously particular in mentioning these points ; but I have particularly felt the want of such precise information, when making a port, and it is of importance to know between what two actual points meridian distances have been measured. I had hoped to be able to obtain a series of moon culminations ; but so uncertain was the weather, that after getting the transit into the meridian, not a single opportunity offered of getting both moon and star ; and it was only by a severe attention for the whole progress of the sun fromhalf past eight until half past ten, a. m., over every ten minutes of altitude, that I secured corresponding observations to enable me"], [746, "[1842. 266 DESCRIPTION OF GALLE. to quit. In other respects, all our observations were particularly satisfactory. These being com pleted on the evening of the 25th, the tents and observatory were embarked. The night previous to our arrival, the steamer India, from Calcutta and Madras, with passengers for the overland mail, touched here for passengers and fuel, and departed on the evening we arrived off the port. She had on board several of our China com. panions, Captains Anson, Fletcher, Col. Adams, 18th regiment Royal Irish, and others whom I was anxious to meet. The Larne had landed them at Madras, and had not yet passed on, although they quitted Macao a week before us. Point de Galle, or Galle, as it is simply termed by the residents, is situated on a peninsula, about half a mile in length by one-third of a mile in breadth, and is entirely comprised within the walls of the fortification *, the parapets on the neck of the penin sula being about fifty to sixty feet in height. It was built by the Dutch ; which may possibly account for the fact that none of the houses enjoy a view of the harbour, and consequently are not much benefited by the pure sea breeze. The greater part of the town, inhabited by the lower orders, is si tuated betwen the sea walls, and the houses occupied by government officers, which rise on the slope of the hill, on the land side. One exception, however, exists, in the house of the master attendant, Mr. Twyuham, which is situated on the crown of a small"], [747, "1842.] 267 SUPPLIES. detached hill, commanding a free view from S. E. to N. W. We experienced the most marked attention from this gentleman during our visit ; and his anxiety to further our wishes in every point connected with our duties, calls for my warmest acknowledgment. Having been, during the whole of our visit, closely engaged in observatory duties, I was unable to see anything beyond the ramparts. My visits were confined to the major, the clergyman, and Mr. Twyn ham. A little recreation would have improved us all, but the general anxiety for home, and an impression that our sick would be better if ex posed to the full sea breeze, forbade any detention beyond the moments absolutely required to com plete our details. The climate is delightful, and having experienced the sultry heat of Trincomalee, one can hardly believe that so few miles intervene, and that it is only six degrees north of the equator. It bears the charac ter of being very healthy, is about a day's journey from Colombo, and two from Kandy. Supplies of bullocks, poultry, and pigs, are easily obtained, and at a reasonable price. Water is sup plied by the master attendant. Strangers cannot easily enter the port without a pilot ; and then it is customary to station boats with flags on the most dangerous patches, which vary from three to twelve feet. Ships are usually moored with the bowers to seaward, and the stream in shore astern, which, by"], [748, "268 [1842- CURRENTS. keeping the ship's head to the swell, prevents great wear and tear, independent of comfort. After experiencing much attention and kindness during our short visit, we quitted Galle on the morn ing of the 27th, with more regret than any place since quitting China. Our course was directed to reach the great Maldavia Atoll, but light airs pre vented our advancing more than twenty-five miles by noon the day following. We were then in one hun dred and seventy fathoms, and another attempt was made with the dredge, but she had drifted into one hundred fathoms before it reached bottom. The result of this experiment afforded us four live shells, of the genus chama. Sea at surface 82\u00b0, at the depth of one hundred fathoms 46\u00b0 5'. We gradually edged off W. S. W., and the winds and currents driving us to the southward, forbade all hope of reaching King's Island : we therefore steered a course to pass through the \" one and a half degree channel,\" which we entered about midnight on the 31st of January, and with a fresh breeze from N. E. expected to have been close in with the island, as laid down in our charts, before daylight ; but in this we were disappointed ; nor did we see land at all, having very probably been carried through the channel by the breeze and current before dawn. Pleasant breezes and smooth water favoured us until the 7th of February, when in latitude 0\u00b0 40' N. longitude 60\u00b0 50' E., the wind veered to south, and we were again teazed by light airs, calms, aud va-"], [749, "1842.] 269 MARINE ANIMALS. riables. Up to this date we had experienced a strong current setting to the S.W., and varying from twenty-five to thirty miles in twenty-four hours. This current failed with the breeze. Several tropic birds, noddies and boobies, were observed, and strong ripplings of currents. Soundings were tried for with two hundred fathoms, but without success. By the towing net we took a great variety of medus\u00e6, mollusca, fine glassy Crustacea, various hyal\u00e6a, nautilus, sepia, minute fish, particularly several varieties of balistes, and large red (unboiled) shrimps. These varieties we continued to obtain daily, particularly the glassy Crustacea in masses, un til crossing the equator in longitude 58\u00b0 E., when several specimens of the live double-keeled nautilus were taken, and we were deserted by our old friends. It was remarkable that those which were likely to evade the net by night, as the nautilus and hyal\u00e6a, were taken at dawn or after sunset. These were again succeeded by solid masses of transparent (probably) medus\u00e6, but not exhibiting organization ; gulf- weed, (fucus natans,) balistes, four-finned flying fish, and helix Ianthina. To those inclined to pursue the study of medus\u00e6, Crustacea, &c, the tropics afford abundant field ; but the pursuit requires perseverance, good apparatus, and a person to watch when the velocity is such as to injure the net, when it should be raised. In this department of natural history, objects are seldom wanting in sea voyages, and such pursuits"], [750, "270 [1842. PORT VICTORIA. tend considerably to lighten the tedium necessarily attendant on calms, adverse winds, &c. We had reached within one hundred and eighty miles of the Sechelles Islands, one of which I had selected for my next position, but heavy squalls, rains, calms, and variables, sorely tried our patience. On the 12th, being within one hundred miles of Sechelles, flying fish, circular radiated medus\u00e6, and Crustacea, were numerous, as well as fucus natans, and a peculiar flag-weed not before noticed. It is perhaps worthy of note, that in this region the fuci appear to be very healthy and in full fruit. On the 18th, after beating two whole days to wind ward, we dropped our anchor at four p.m. in Port Victoria, Sechelles, close off the Isle St. Anne, on which I landed, and fixed on a position for our ob servatory, viz. the first small promontory north of the sandy bay, where several huts formerly stood, and immediately above the watering place, and turtle pond. In the morning we were visited by some of the authorities, in order to ascertain the condition of our crew, they being at this moment rather in dread of the small-pox. As my pursuits would tie me to the observatory until the necessary observations for its confirmation were obtained, I despatched a letter to the civil commissioner, A. Mylius, Esq., promising to visit him on the morrow. In the morning we took possession of the promon tory, and before four o'clock Sulphur Village was 6"], [751, "1842.] 271 JACK AND THE COCOA-NUTS. erected, with a fine grassy spot in front, and a clear and cool bubbling brook on our right, at which our boats commenced watering. We were also overhung with cocoa-nuts ; but as these were private property, they were immediately placed under tabu. The island being the property of Mr. Savy, I had already sent to obtain his sanction to our holding possession during our stay. Fortunately also, there were but two blacks residing on the island, so that there was little fear of disturbance, or of our attention being distracted by purchases, &c. Surrounded as we were by forests of cocoa-nuts, we had some difficulty in persuading Jack that he was not in the garden of Eden, where property was in common. Frequent ominous falls of ponderous bodies intimated that all my advice on the subject of \"property\" (or propriety) was of little avail, and I heartily wished the proprietor would make his appear ance, in order that I might make some agreement with him as a matter of remuneration for the da mage which I knew he must eventually sustain. As he did not appear to feel so much interest as myself upon the question of his own property, I was soon involved in other matters, leaving my veto to be enforced if possible. I regret, however, that two of our miscreants, not content with the robbery of the fruit, cut down one of the young Cocos de Mer,* a plant very difficult to rear, even in this group, which is their only known habitat. * The absurd stories about this fruit are not worth insertion"], [752, "272 [1842 MR. MYLIUS AND FAMILY. On the day following I visited Mahe, now Victoria, and called upon Mr. Mylius, by whom I was most warmly welcomed. On landing, I was not a little surprised to find our police (in uniform) had travelled thus far to meet us on our homeward route. Steam is no doubt doing wonders, but I naturally asked how came these coats here ? However, the fine ebony countenance beneath the black beavers in a broiling hot day soon undeceived me ; no Englishman has a head thick enough to stand that. The clothes are remarkably well-made, and the men carry themselves quite a la militaire. The family of Mr. Mylius consists of his wife, a lady of Mauritius, three daughters and governess, besides pctites. In a few minutes I was quite at home, and the disappointment that I was not to occupy the apartments prepared for me (as I was compelled to return before eight) was too genuine to be doubted. This, however, was but a visit of ceremony, and after an early dinner, I regained the island, a distance of about three miles. On Tuesday they paid a visit to Sulphur Town and the ship, and on the day following, I managed to spare a day to examine Mahe, the officers joining us at dinner.

They are falling very fast into decay. Between that formidable tro pical enemy the white ant, and want of paint to protect them from the weather, they are as rusty as any of our country barns in the west of England. The old French residents complain bitterly of the emancipation, and that their estates are fast falling into decay. Indeed, the blacks, lazy at all times, cannot be persuaded to work voluntarily, and I very strongly suspect that the change from slavery to freedom, or rather the entire destruction of any control over their persons, rendering it necessary to hold out allurements, or adequate wages, is nearer the real cause. They either have not the means of paying, or they cannot make their minds up to swallow the bitter pill of paying those to whose services they still maintain they are entitled. I feel much interested about these people, and can see clearly that this heavy cloud, which never will be dispersed, must eventually blight all the prospects of the present holders of estates.

That this does not result from want of energy in their governor, as well as 'amongst themselves, there are abundant proofs, which were made fully apparent to me during my visit. They have formed various useful and scientific associations, and amongst other compliments, they forwarded im mediately on my arrival an official ticket of admit tance, accompanied by a complimentary letter from the Literary Society of the Sechelles, enclosing at the same time one of their almanacks. From the interesting matter contained in the latter, I have extracted the following description of \" DES ISLES LABOURDONNAIS DITES SECHELLES. \" These isles, twenty-nine in number, form the archipelago, which is the most considerable of the dependencies of the Mauritius, extending meridion ally from 3\u00b0 40** to 5\u00b0 35' S., and longitudinally from 55\u00b0 15' to 56\u00b0 0' E., and situated about nine hun dred and fifteen miles from the Mauritius. They were discovered and examined in 1742 by the Tartan, Elizabeth, Captain Lazare Picault, de spatched by Monsieur Mahe de Labourdonnais from the Isle of France.

It is moun tainous, with high jutting perpendicular cliffy peaks, intersected freely by ravines, and plentifully sup- t 2"], [756, "276 [1842. MAHE. plied therefrom by water, resulting from perpetual condensation and showers. The soil is reddish, con sisting principally of a decomposed granite, well adapted for vegetable productions, and, as before noticed, well-watered by the branches, natural as well as artificial, from the ravines. On the eastern side of the island is the town situated at the mouth of a valley, formed by a chain of high mountains, bristling with rugged rocks, and surmounted by large trees. The most elevated point of this range is termed Mome Blanc, at the base of which several meandering streams traverse the town. The houses are built entirely of wood ; they consist solely of a ground floor, and are generally surrounded by fruit trees within a palisade. Opposite and in front, within the semicircle formed by the isles St. Anne, Longue, Moyenne, Ronde, and L'lle aux Cerfs, is the road of Mahe, now changed to Port Victoria, w*hich might accommodate a large number of vessels; but I think I may safely (talking of vessels) reduce the number from three or four hun dred to thirty or forty ; and even that number cannot pick their berths. Owing to the transparency of the water, all abso lute dangers are visible, and the port or inner har bour may be safely resorted to, where vessels intend ing to remain any time, will find the water smoother, and without that swell which renders the outer anchorage (by reason of a heavy ground swell con stantly turning in) very unpleasant. We also found"], [757, "1842.] 277 LINE OF THE MONSOONS, the anchorage near St. Anne's rocky, but the pipe clay between the rocks holds well. I would advise any vessel anchoring near that is land, to run out the stream anchor astern in the direction of the swell, otherwise, upon any sudden flaw* off shore during the night, she may be subjected to a sudden fit of rolling before it can be remedied ; and hedges at that moment are liable to injure men as well as boats. The \" stitch in time \" should be borne in mind here. I know it to my cost. Although situated so near the equator, these islands do not experience a high temperature ; its range is very limited, and the only atmospheric changes which are remarked are the N.W. monsoons or gales, accompanied by lightning and heavy rains. The hurricanes of the Mauritius do not reach these limits. The two monsoons, S. E. and N. W., observe nearly the same periods and character as those of Hindostan. The S.E. monsoon, or dry season, com mences in April, and terminates in November. The N. W. monsoon, or rainy season, commences in November, and terminates in March. Sometimes, hoM'ever, the breezes from the S.E. die away, and are succeeded by variables, accompanied by rain, but never of long duration. The Sulphur experienced very strong south easterly currents and winds from S.E., E.S.E., N.E., N., N.W., and S.W., within the last one hundred and eighty miles north-easterly from this group, and"], [758, "278 [1842. ADVANTAGES OF THE SECHELLES. calms and rain tediously frequent. This was during the early part of February. The report on Sechelles informs us that \" Few parts of the world are so favoured by nature as the Sechelles. Situated near the middle of the Indian Ocean, nearly equidistant from the neighbouring lands, they offer, besides a fine and secure roadsted, a climate equable and salubrious. Not liable to abrupt changes of atmosphere, they are exempt from those diseases so common to other tropical regions ; nor are they visited by those scourges, the hurricanes, which elsewhere destroy all agricul tural efforts, and are inevitably followed by misery and distress.\" Some navigators are of opinion that these islands were known to the Arabs and seamen of the six teenth century, but they certainly were not colonized until the year 1742. The first settlers who came to establish themselves amounted to seven, all of French origin. In the first instance they occupied themselves in taking turtle : but as the islands soon assumed more importance, Mons. St. Miel was ap pointed provisional governor for the king of France, succeeded by Messrs. Roman ville, Berthelotte, Eilotte, Malavois, Caradec, Nageon, Enouf, and finally, M. Queau de Quincy was appointed a military com mandant and civil agent for the French Republic. The population soon increased by the addition of several families from Bourbon and Mauritius, living very happily, and almost as one family, and much"], [759, "1842.] 279 CESSION OF THE GROUP. attached to the latter governor, who reigned over them, as a father, for a period exceeding twenty years, and subsequently, as juge de paix under the British government, for eighteen. The turn of war, however, brought its change for Sechelles. On the 16th May, 1794, Captain New come, commanding his Majesty's ship Orpheus, and having under his orders his Majesty's ship Cen turion, Captain Osborne, and Resistance, Captain Pakenham, anchored in the roads, and demanded from the commandant the cession of the Sechelles group.

QueoYU Quincy Signed, Henry Newcome. Nevertheless, it was not without apprehension that the inhabitants returned to their pursuits ; but the capture of Bourbon and Mauritius re-established their confidence ; and the definitive peace of 1814, where these islands became a dependency on Mauri tius, entirely revived commercial relations. France certainly lost here a very important posi tion. But it was equally important to Great Bri tain, that Mauritius should not have so formidable a position in the hands of strangers, \u2014 commanding the commerce of these seas, from Africa, and throughout the Red Sea, up to Ceylon; the very key of our western trade. But it is still unfortified, and nearly as bare of defence as in 1742. Upon the cessation of the Mauritius, the govern ment of these isles devolved upon an agent or com missioner, under the government of Mauritius. At this period the free population numbered five hun dred and sixty-six persons, and the census gave the"], [763, "1842.] 283 PRODUCTIONS. blacks at six thousand six hundred and thirty-eight souls. This figure is at present considerably dimi nished. Since Great Britain has assumed the government of the isles, the following persons appear to have held the appointments of commandant and civil agents ; Sullivan, Quincy, Lesage, Madge, Harrison, (1826) Wilson, (1837,) C. A. Mylius, Esq., civil commissioner and present resident, (1838.) Of the productions of the Sechelles, I can only refer to those which, during our short visit, came under my observation, and of which I obtained some few samples, through the kindness of my friend Mr. Mylius. Cotton, coffee, cocoa, cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, anatto, maize, and fruits and vegetables of every species found within the tropics. It is indeed a garden, in which anything would thrive. Any spe cies of habit, soil, or climate may be selected, from the close damp heat of the forcing-house, to the open exposed sun and air, moist or dry. The timber is much esteemed for ship building ; and I am given to understand that the Hibiscus tiliaceus, or purau of the Polynesian Islands, so use ful in boat building, could be obtained here in any quantity. The hard wood used for ships' timbers very much resembles the Tamanu, (Calophyllum inophyllum) of the Pacific, or mahogany ; but is more easily worked ; in fact, better adapted for ship building."], [764, "284 [1842. SHIP-BUILDING. The finer woods for cabinet purposes are also abundant, and many pieces of furniture, particularly that made of the bois de nat, are very beautiful. It appears that since 1810, with their reduced force of artificers, they have launched no less than forty-five vessels, ranging from thirty to four hun dred tons, and amounting altogether to four thou sand five hundred and two tons. Several are at present on the stocks, one of one hundred tons, and one of four hundred and twenty tons. We found a French national schooner (a tender) from Bourbon, hauled up to rebuild ; her crew occu pying a small islet. The islands abound with cocoa-nuts, fruit, vegeta bles, fish, turtle, and bullocks, and they offer every inducement for refit and recruit (secure from hurri canes) to our cruizers in these seas. Such visits, indeed, are for many strong reasons of the utmost importance, and more particularly to the authorities. In point of medical aid also, it would be of the highest benefit, as notwithstanding the boasted salu brity of the climate, there are many casualties and common diseases which frequently defy ordinary treatment in those not professing skill ; and at the period of our visit no such persons acted at Victoria or on the island of Mahe ; consequently our surgeon was a most welcome and important visitant. With but slight expense, a very convenient depot for stores, and jetty for heaving down, might be constructed, the reefs within the port affording"], [765, "1842.] 285 WELCOME STORM. every facility, rising suddenly within a foot of the sea level, and having a depth of three or four fa thoms at the distance of thirty feet, which would be about the position for the keel of a line-of-battle ship. In consequence of the complete stagnation of business, we found money scarce, and bills not nego tiable ; we even experienced difficulty in arranging for the few supplies obtained. The principal objects of our visit having been completed, viz. the measurement of the meridian distance and magnetic details, we took leave of our kind friends, Mr. Mylius and family, to whom we are indebted for much kindness, civility, and enjoy ment, and on the evening of the 24th February quitted our anchorage. Favoured by a heavy squall of thunder, lightning, and rain, we rounded the southern end of Mahe about midnight. It is not frequent that seamen hail such meteorological visitors with satisfaction, but tantalised so long as we have been, on this our homeward voyage, by such a series of calms and variables, we were grateful for any incident which would speed us to the Cape, where, doubtless, want of wind will be our last complaint. Having cleared this group, we endeavoured to close or pass to the northward of the Amirantes, or even to the westward of any of the islands situated in our route to Madagascar ; but our old bad for tune pursued us, the currents driving us rapidly to"], [766, "286 [ 1842. SURVEYING PRIVILEGES. the S.E. The weather, also, prevented our obtain ing the necessary observations for navigating with the requisite precision through these dangers. I often fancy there is something about a survey ing ship, which helps her through difficulties in the most extraordinary manner, and especially so in the case of the Sulphur. Surveyors are, indeed, in plain terms, pilots, and as such endued with a species of in tuitive impression of where they are, in spite of all obstacles. This was most fully exemplified on the morning of the 2nd of March, when, by the reckon ing we were well to the westward of Providence Island. I felt otherwise, and doubled the precau tions. At dawn we found the reefs under our bows, and only fifteen fathoms of water beneath us. One hour later daylight might not have given sufficient notice. However, the ship was soon leaving it as rapidly as she had approached, and edging along the reef, varying our soundings from five to twenty fathoms, and steering from S.S.W. to E.S.E. for twenty miles, cleared its southern extremity about noon. Unfortunately, the absence of sun and horizon, and the prevalence of heavy rain, prevented our making any satisfactory examination of this danger. The bank of soundings appears to trend S.S.E. from Provi dence Island, as in most instances we had to haul out E.S.E., to keep in ten or fifteen fathoms, and always shoaled when changing our course to South. The bottom appears tolerably even, and it was 8"], [767, "1842.] 287 MAJAMBO BAY. plainly visible, composed of sand, studded with small rocky patches. There was but little surf. At the moment we rounded the southern tail, the main island bore N. i W. Before dark we made Farquhar's, and the Six Islands broad on our lee-beam, and we now had hopes of weathering the north end of Madagascar, a point until this moment (and even then) very problemati cal in my mind. On the 5th of March, we rounded Cape Sebastian, but still experienced a strong current against us. On the 9th, despairing of reaching Bembatooka, in reasonable time to make good our meridian distance, we bore up at noon, and ran into Majambo Bay, west coast of Madagascar, where we anchored about four p. m., off a low sandy point well adapted for our observatory. I should have selected the northern point, as that given in Captain Owen's chart ; but the anchorage being unsafe, and landing dangerous, I contented myself with a position two miles further to the southward. The tents, &c, were erected before dark, and having my fowling-piece with me, I succeeded in killing a few partridges of a species entirely new to us. Fortunately we succeeded in obtaining our suite of observations the day following, which was a great consolation after our late incessant rains. Not a sign appeared of any recent huts, villages, or inhabitants ; and the whole coast, although grate-"], [768, "288 [1842 NATURE OF THE COAST. ful to the eye, was barren of amusement, save to the sportsman, and probably the Tjotanist. The former found full employment. The tree palm, of several varieties, acacias, tama rinds, a plum with four seeds, in great abundance, and many unknown fruits, abounded. Many bulbous roots occurred in the sand immediately about us, and during a short ramble, I collected several ob jects which may prove interesting. Amongst the reptiles, we obtained iguanas, lizards, chameleons of three varieties, with centipedes, cockroaches, and two large snakes (apparently water.) The birds comprised partridges, quail, waders, ducks, guinea fowl (very large and heavy,) curlew, hawks, kingfishers, parroquets, and several minute birds of gaudy plumage. The soil on our immediate location, and which appeared to constitute even the high hills behind us, was entirely fine quartz sand, a perfect waste for acres in spots. A very remarkable formation was noticed outside from the shqi, when entering, and situated about three miles west of the north point. It doubtless was this same sand, which giving way to the heavy rains, left a valley of grotesque lamellar pyramids, resembling the ruins of a city, and having on the two sides broad streams of sand flowing to the sea. Where the rocks protruded, they were found to be a close aggregation of shells, and from their posi tion probably of ancient date. About seven or eight miles to the southward, on"], [769, "1842.] 289 GEOLOGY. the same side of the bay, I visited the cliff, to ascer tain the nature of the rock, which I found to be superstratum coarse red sandstone ; No. 2, indu rated clay ; No. 3, apparently the same in a more in durated state ; substratum softer, apparently pipe clay. Large black blocks and boulders were noticed on the summits, which (from some which had apparently been cast on the beach,) I presume to be the coarse sandstone conglomerate. The water flowed over the cliffs and down the ravines in pro fusion. We obtained mullet of several varieties, and very large. Porgy and other tropical fish were abundant ; several unknown. These were taken by a net set across a creek at high water ; but they were all spoiled, from want of proper salt for the curing mixture. Large sharks were abundant, and pieces of turtle ; but none of the latter noticed alive, nor their tracks on the extensive sandy beaches. Latterly one or two natives were seen near the northern point, but none would communicate. Having completed our labours on the loth March, we embarked, and put to sea that night. For seve ral previous evenings, we had been visited by heavy squalls, attended with rain, thunder, and lightning, and this night we experienced rather an unpleasant attack, which laid our lee cabins under water, and did much damage in our department. Our crew still continued to suffer from their D VOL. II."], [770, "290 [1842. ADVERSE WEATHER. diseases contracted in China, and on the eighth (i. Spry, a promising lad, fell another victim. The same worrying weather continued to attend us, and on the 19th we had only advanced ninety miles from our Port of Departure. We fell in with an American schooner, trading between Zanzibar and Bembatooka, but gained no intelligence from her. Indeed, our track has laid so completely out of the commercial line, that the sight of a strange sail is quite an event. We now shaped our course to reach the nearest point of the African coast, hoping to meet with the strong southerly currents said to prevail in the Mo zambique. On the 31st of March we had only reached latitude 22\u00b0 11' S., longitude 36\u00b0 31' E., but a very heavy long-jawed swell from the S.E. plainly indicated that heavy breezes had prevailed in that direction. Many objects of interest offered, more indeed than the calls on my time could allow me to attend to as closely as they merited. By the towing net, living nautilus, several varieties of hyal\u00e6a, cleodora, minute univalves, glossy nautilus, and Crustacea in great variety, abundance, and beauty : enough to afford ample enjoyment to the naturalist, and as many draughtsmen as he could find. But in this latter point the Sulphur was at a very low ebb. Pressed still to the northward, current bottles were thrown overboard at eligible points. Temperature at"], [771, "1842.] 291 LAGULLAS BANK. 79\u00b0 5', atmosphere moist, and sick list rather on the increase ; and to add to these inconveniences, and render our crew less contented, provisions barely sufficient to reach the Cape by reducing one third, until we reach the range of steady or strong breezes. It had been my intention to have made one more station at Delagoa Bay, but under these circum stances, and without a chance of obtaining bread or flour there, I was forced to give up all idea of delay, or risk of being caught in that bight by strong south east breezes. On the 2nd April we reached in to Point Barrow, where we experienced a fresh working breeze, and by working close in shore, rounded Cape Corrientes be fore dark. At this point we first experienced the influence of the southerly current, and from this date made great progress, but the favourable breezes never continued longer than thirty-six hours, and were generally succeeded by one exactly adverse. On the 10th we struck soundings on the east shoulder of Lagullas bank, in seventy fathoms, and at eight a. m. were about thirty miles S.W. of Cape Reciffe. Although we ran offshore thirteen miles, our soundings varied only from sixty-five to seventy fathoms. Here, baffling winds detaining us, fishing lines and dredges were in action. Two very acceptable fish of the Porgy tribe were hooked, and nine univalves, five bivalves, three euryale, and several echini, were obtained by the dredge from sixty-five fathoms; u 2"], [772, "[1842. 292 TEMPERATURE OF SOUNDINGS. sea at surface 64\u00b0, bottom 62\u00b0, and evidently fossil. Not more than a degree difference of temperature was noticed at first entering soundings. But as this was more minutely watched, as we purposely edged in and off the bank, it was found off the southern edge to change from 64\u00b0 to 67\u00b0. In the Pacific this had been narrowly watched, but the law was found to be inapplicable, even off the mouth of the river Columbia, Sitka, and high northern latitudes. On the 12th of April, being becalmed in fog, about one hundred and eight miles off Cape Hank lip, the dredge was dropped in seventy fathoms, by which many very interesting specimens were procured, par ticularly of Terebratula, which occurred alive and in great variety. On the 13th, at noon, we were twenty-two miles off Cape Hanklip, and the breeze favouring us, ex pected momentarily to see it break out from the sur rounding haze. About three p.m., we passed it within three miles, and at four, sighted the South ampton, bearing the flag of Vice-admiral Sir E. King. Strong haze and fog, with sun directly in our faces, did not admit our making out anything before we were abreast Roman Rocks, having overrun our dis tance much, and before our number could be made we were rather close upon the flag-ship. Having but one pair of signal halliards the number and the pendant could not enjoy the mast head together, and when the former came down the ensign went"], [773, "1842.] 293 MAGNETISM. up. Some other trifling accidents prevented our taking up our intended berth, and probably not shifting our ensign in time ; for all of which I was made to feel very keenly on paying my respects. On board the Southampton I had the good for tune to meet my old friend Captain Ogle, with whom I had become acquainted at Callao, when commander of the President, in 1838. We had not the good fortune to receive a single letter for any individual on board the Sulphur. As the refit of the ship could be conducted by the first lieutenant, the moment I was released by the admiral, I obtained leave to repair to the Royal Observatory, Cape Town, in order to compare our magnetic instruments with those at the Magnetic Observatory conducted by Lieutenant Wilmot, R.N., thus affording decided values to the series observed at the station between this and Singapore. I experienced a very warm reception from Lieu tenant Wilmot. Mr. Maclear, the astronomer royal, was absent on the triangulation connected with the measurement of the meridian, but from his able factotum, Mr. Mann, I received much kind assist ance, and every facility which the observatory af forded. The result of my observations proved that I had no reason to doubt the steadiness of the dip or declination instruments, as they agreed sufficiently close with the observations of the days. The in tensity will be proved hereafter. Of these I had less doubt, from their general uniformity during our"], [774, "294 AMERICAN EXPLORING EXPEDITION. [1842. stay iii China, as well as between our periods of ob servation (one year) at Singapore. During my visit to Cape Town I had the plea sure of renewing my acquaintance with Commodore Wilkes, (lieutenant, United States navy,) command ing the United States Exploring Expedition, and who had behaved so handsomely to us when we un shipped our rudder at the Feejees, giving us the rudder pintles of the Peacock. We had many affairs to talk over, and many notes to compare, as he had visited the greater number of our stations, and unfortunately lost one of his consorts, the Pea cock, on the north bar of the river Columbia, where she became a total wreck, the crew barely escaping with their lives. On my return to Simon's Bay, our needles were again tested at the position occupied by Captains James Clarke Ross, and Crozier, and the ship being ready for sea, we most joyfully quitted Simon's Bay for St. Helena. Fortunately, the breeze favoured us, and by midnight we passed within musket-shot of the Bellows Rock, and were once more in the Atlantic. A heavy sea on our beam caused us to roll and strain much for several days, but this soon wore off, and we contrived to drop our anchor on the 14th day at St. Helena. Here I found her Majesty's ship Grecian, com manded by my old shipmate, Captain Smyth, (in three vessels since 1814,) whom I very soon had the pleasure of shaking by the hand ; and having made"], [775, "1842.] PLANTATION HOUSE. 295 the necessary arrangements for pitching my tent where Captain Ross observed, galloped off to Plan tation House, to pay my respects to the governor, Colonel Trelawney, R.A., who received us without formality, introduced us to his family, and mounting his horse, accompanied us to Longwood, to call on Lieutenant Smyth, in charge of the magnetic obser vatory. We Avere rather late, and met Mr. Smyth at the gate. Turning our horses, he walked a considerable distance in conversation with us ; just long enough to make us regret that we were to part so soon. Enveloped in darkness, and roads rather doubtful, we did not return quite so expeditiously, reaching Plantation House about eight o'clock, and sat down to dinner, much, I fear, to the discomfiture of family arrangements. Duty compelling our return that evening, we re mounted our horses soon after dinner, very much against our own inclinations, and not without many expressions of chagrin on the part of our kind host ; and about midnight reached James' Town, where, by the hospitality of our good friend, Mr. Solomon, or rather the friend of the navy, we were comforta bly housed. Our visit was repeated the day following, and on Monday, the governor, accompanied by his second daughter, chief-justice, (Wild,) and one or two friends, paid a visit to the Sulphur and Grecian, very much to our gratification."], [776, "[ 1 842. 296 ASCENSION. Our duties complete, we quitted shortly after day light, I must say with great regret. Possibly had tin- Grecian remained, I might have stolen another day or two to make it a rating position, and shortened my stay at Ascension. Our visits of sunshine have been \"few and far between\" during the harassing period of our servitude, and when we meet with kindness, with such true honest English feeling in particular as that experienced at St. Helena, al though \" homeward bound,\" we did regret that our friendship was to terminate so suddenly. Captain Smyth breakfasted with me off the port, and our long explanations and tales of other times, rapidly recapitulated, and but half exhausted, (and who but sailors can participate in such revellings ?) we parted with a hearty cordial grasp, to finish our stories at a future day. Shortly the beautiful, well-handled Grecian stole close on our lee-quarter, and hauling suddenly to the wind across our stern, slipped off with a last fare well, like a sea bird, whilst the Sulphur was bruising the blue sea in a most collier-like style. Our course was now directed for Ascension, and with a fine fresh trade we reached the anchorage about two a.m. on the fourth day. We found here the Albert, one of the unfortunate Niger expedition, commanded by Commander Fishbourne, awaiting further orders. He called on me the following morning, and af forded us all the late English news. Our operations"], [777, "1842.] HOMEWARD BOUND. 297 were speedily completed at this island, and having embarked all the invalids anxiously awaiting pas sage, we took leave of the Albert on the evening of the 18th of May. Ascension affords but little to interest the casual observer. It has long been famed for the abundance of turtle,, of which we did not fail to embark our due allowance : but with the exception of water, it rather looks for than affords supplies. Our progress from hence was tediously slow. I had intended to reach Porto Praya in the Cape de Verds, but the great delay which occurred between the limits allotted to the variables induced me to give up this plan, and stretch towards the coast of Africa, where I hoped to catch, as I had experienced on former occasions, a leading wind which would carry me up to the Azores. During our detention near the equator, we were fortunate in obtaining very large and perfect speci mens of the helix janthina, as well as several rare and beautiful varieties of nautilus, hyal\u00e6a, and cleodora. About the beginning of June, in latitude 5\u00b0 30' N., and longitude 16\u00b0 15' W., we began to experi ence the tail of the tornadoes, and on the 3rd were visited by one in full force.

This, however, did not long continue. We succeeded in reaching off shore, and gaining the breeze, and on the 3rd of July passed the island of St. Michael's, Azores. On the 1 9th, passing through the Needles, we ran up and anchored at Spithead, when, having paid my respects to the admiral, Sir E. Codrington, I repaired to the Admiralty. The Sulphur was or dered to Woolwich, and paid off on the 2nd of Au gust. The Lords of the Admiralty, in consideration of the long servitude of the crew of the Sulphur in such trying climates, during a period of nearly seven years, directed that those who had exceeded five years should be paid the increased wages due by recent reg*ulation, and that half of the amount of slops during the Sulphur's voyage should be re mitted.

No. I. NICARAGUA. The following has been extracted from a report made by our vice-consul, Mr. Foster, in f 837. The import trade of this state (Nicaragua) and the country in general, has not suffered so much as might have been expected from the very severe visitation of cholera during this year. The prices of foreign manufactures have now found their level in these markets, and the consumption of those articles used by the poorer classes have increased in a wonderful degree both in quantity and quality, and this demand for foreign manufactures (of which \" British cottons\" of inferior quality bear a prominent part) will naturally go on at an increased ratio. The foreign imports may be classed under the follow ing heads. British; consist of calicoes, printed cottons, domestic or grey and power-loom shirtings, linen, and cotton-"], [784, "304 NICARAGUA. mixed, or unions; linens, muslins, hosiery ; hard earthen ware, iron, steel, lead, powder, \u00abfec. French; consist of silks, printed cottons, cambrics, wine, spirits, jewellery, and fancy articles.

Germany: osnaburgs, glassware, wax, furniture, hard ware, steel, wine, &c. Italy ; paper, oil, silk, liqueurs. Colombia ; cocoa, and straw hats. Peru ; jerga, (a coarse woollen cloth,) tin, spirits, and common sweet wine. Chili ; of sweet wine, pellones, &c. The value of British goods imported may be taken at two-thirds of the whole of the imports. The consumption of French goods, being principally articles of luxury, are chiefly confined to the cities of Guatemala, San Salvador, Granada, &c. German linens, shirtings, and glassware are articles of general consumption. In Spanish goods, with the exception of ribboDs, the imports are trivial ; they have given way to those of France and Italy. The sickness of this year has had considerable in fluence on the exports. Cochineal and indigo form the principal ; great quantities, particularly of the former, are shipped from the ports on the northern side of Honduras. From the ports of the Pacific fifteen hundred serons have been exported during the year to Europe, and the ports of Peru and Chili. (In the interior of both these countries a great quantity of indigo is con-"], [785, "305 NICARAGUA. sumed.) Hides, horns, sarsaparilla, and balsam, for Europe and the United States, and mahogany, cedar, and sugar, for Chili and Peru. These form the prin cipal articles of export trade ; which, in proportion to the imports, is on the increase. Brazil wood, with which this state as well as Costa Rica abounds, formerly afforded employment to a great number of British vessels. The fall of this article in the home markets has for the present caused it to be but little sought after. In agriculture this state i9 rapidly improving ; in addition to indigo, sugar, cocoa, wheat, rice, &c, coffee and cotton are now better attended to, but more particu larly cotton and indigo. The quality of the former, which is much esteemed and known in the European markets as \" green seeded,\" is an annual plant ; the staple is short, which is overbalanced by its superior fine texture, and it is peculiarly adapted to certain manufactures. New arrangements in the tariff are about to take place, but the present state of revolution must suspend any remark upon this question. The province of Nicaragua has the advantage of di versity of climate, the plains in the vicinity of the large towns of Leon, Granada, and Nicaragua, being tropical, and the heights nearing the lakes from the Pacific, as Chocoyos, Matagalpa, and Segovia, being temperate, whilst in the region about Honduras it is generally cold, even for an European. The soil is everywhere fertile, and capable of yielding every species of produce of corresponding temperature. Mines also exist, but are not worked for want of capital and population ; particularly as the plains afford abund- VOL. II. x"], [786, "306 NICARAGUA. ance of nutriment to the limited population, at. very trifling labour. The seasons are periodical, with trifling variation. The summer, or dry season, commences the early part of No vember, and the winter, or wet season, in the latter end of April, or beginning of May. The summer is perfectly dry, at which time commer cial intercourse is carried on, which, during the winter, particularly the latter end, becomes difficult, on account of the impassability of the roads. It is during the winter that the agriculturist com mences his labours, and during the months of September and October that the rains are excessive. The climate is considered generally very healthy, al though intermittent fever, by neglect, degenerates into typhus : there are no epidemical diseases peculiar to it. The health of the natives, as well as that of Europeans, is influenced at the change of the seasons. Any impor tant deviation may be traced to neglect or excess ; par ticularly as regards foreigners. The temperature in the shade ranges from seventy to ninety in the plains near the sea coast. The internal commerce of the country is facilitated by good cart roads in the plains, which are practicable (even in their neglected state) from the South Pacific to the town of Granada on the Lake of Nicaragua. Should rail-roads or steamers be brought into action, the communication with the Atlantic will lead commerce direct into the heart of the State. But of this no estimate can be formed. The government are using every effort to connect these lakes of Nicaragua and Managua with"], [787, "307 NICARAGUA. either ocean ; but I think the day of achievement is yet distant. What is to repay the speculators when good navigable access does not succeed ? A superfluity only can warrant the undertaking. As to any canal into the Pacific, unless behind Momotombo Telica and Viego range, into the Estero Real, I see little feasibility in the scheme. The population of Nicaragua does not much exceed one hundred and sixty thousand souls. The inhabitants in general are honest and industrious ; of the authorities we will say but little. Cardon, at the mouth of the port of Realejo, is situated in 12\u00b0, 28' N., and about 87\u00b0 12' W. It has two entrances, both of which are safe, under proper precaution, and in all weathers. The depths vary from two to seven fathoms, and good and safe anchorage extends for several miles ; the rise and fall of tide is eleven feet, full and change 3h. 6m. Docks or slips therefore may easily be con structed, and timber is readily to be procured of any dimensions. Wood, water, and immediate necessaries and luxuries are plentiful and cheap. The village of Realejo is about nine miles from the sea. Its population is about one thousand souls; the principal occupation of the working males is on the water, loading and unloading vessels. It has a custom-house, and officers under a collector, comptroller, and collector and captain of the port ; of him or his guards we will not say too much. The sooner they find one less troublesome the better. One branch of the river, the Donna Paula, takes a course towards Leon, and is navigable to within three leagues of that city. It has been suggested to carry a x2"], [788, "308 CONVENTION WITH rail-road from Leon to the lake of Managua. This might be effected ; but neither the people, government, or consideration of the returns, will at present warrant any such step, unless as the sole act of the government. No. II.

Art. I. \u2014 It is agreed that the respective subjects of the high contracting parties shall not be troubled or molested in any part of the ocean commonly called the Pacific Ocean, either in navigating the same, in fishing therein, or in landing at such parts of the coast as shall not have been already occupied, in order to trade with the natives, under the restrictions and conditions speci fied in the following articles. Art. II. \u2014 In order to prevent the right of navigating and fishing exercised upon the ocean by subjects of the high contracting parties from becoming the pretext sol an illicit commerce, it is agreed that the subjects of his Britannic Majesty shall not land at any place where there may be a Russian establishment without the permission of the governor or commandant; and on the other hand, that Russian subjects shall not land, without permission, at any British establishment on the N.

Commencing from the southernmost point of the island, called Prince of Wales Island, (which lies in the parallel of 54 degrees, 40 minutes, north latitude, and be tween the 131st and the 133rd degree of west longitude, meridian of Greenwich,) the said line shall ascend to the north along the channel called Portland Canal, as far as the point, of the continent where it strikes the 58th degree of north latitude. From this last-mentioned point the line of demarcation shall follow the summit of the mountains situated parallel to the coast, as far as the point of intersection of 141st degree of west longitude, (of the same meridian,) and finally, from the same point of intersection, the said meridian line of the 141st degree, in its prolongation as far as the Frozen Ocean, shall form the limit between the Russian and British posses sions on the continent of America to the north-west. Art. IV. \u2014 With reference to the line of demarcation laid down in the preceding article it is understood : 1st. That the island called Prince of Wales Is- land shall belong wholly to Russia. 2nd. That whenever the summit of the mountains which extend in a direction parallel to the coast, from the 56th degree of north latitude to the point of intersection of the 141st degree of west longitude, shall prove to be at the distance of more than ten marine leagues from the ocean, the limit between the British possessions and the line of coast which is to belong to Russia, as above mentioned, shall be"], [791, "311 THE EMPEROR OF RUSSIA. formed by a line parallel to the windings of the coast, and which shall never exceed the distance of ten marine leagues therefrom. Art. V. \u2014 It is moreover agreed that no establishment shall be formed by either of the two parties within the limits assigned by the two preceding articles to the pos sessions of the other ; consequently British subjects shall not form any establishment either upon the coast or upon the border of the continent comprised within the limits of the Russian possessions, or designated in the two preced ing articles ; and in like manner no establishment shall be formed by Russian subjects beyond the said limits.

X. \u2014 Every British or Russian vessel navigating the Pacific Ocean, which may be compelled, by storms or by accident, to take shelter in the ports of the respective parties, shall be at liberty to refit therein, to provide itself with all necessary stores, and to put to sea again without paying any other than port and lighthouse dues, which shall be the same as those paid by national vessels. In case, however, the master of such vessel should be under the necessity of disposing of a part of his mer chandise, in order to defray his expenses, he shall con form himself to the regulations and tariffs of the place where he may have landed. Art. XL \u2014 In every case of complaint on account of an infraction of the articles of the present convention, the civil and military authorities of the high contracting parties, without previously acting or taking any forcible measures, shall make an exact and circumstantial report of the matter to their respective courts, who engage to settle the same in a friendly manner, according to the principles of justice."], [793, "313 MARQUESAS.

No. III. MARQUESAS. This group of islands, generally known to navigators of the present day as the \" Marquesas,\" was discovered at two different periods. In the year 1595, the expedition under the command of Alonza Mendafia de Neyva first discovered Santa Christina, or Tahuata ; La Dominica, or Hioaoa ; San Pedro, or Mohotani ; Santa Madalena, or Fatuiva. These received the name of the Marquesas de Mendoza. They were subsequently visited, and described by Cook"], [794, "314 .MARQUESAS. and the Forsters, in 1774, when Hood's Island was added to the group. In 1791, an American captain (Ingraham) discovered the islands of Nuhuhiva (or Nuuhiva, abbrev.), Uahuga, or Washington Island, and Uapou, or Adam's Island. This second discovery of part of the same group received the name of the Washington Islands. In June of the same year, Marchand, a Frenchman, also claimed the discovery of the latter portion, but the palni has been generally awarded to Ingraham. Lieut. Hergest, in command of the D\u00e6dalus, part of the expedition under Captain Vancouver, visited them in 1792, and fancying them undiscovered, named them as follows \u2014 Nuhuhiva, Sir Henry Martin's Island ; Ua huga, Riou's Island ; and Uapou, Trevenon's Island. He also added Hergest's Rocks, and the northernmost, or Robert's Island, at that period uninhabited. These names have been indiscriminately in use amongst subsequent navigators, but the whole group is generally recognised as the Mendana Archipelago, or \" The Mar- quesas.\" There is every reason to believe that the whole group was known to the earlier Paumotu navigators ; as Tupia, the native of Ulietea, who embarked with Cook, intend ing to visit England, furnished the data from memory, for many of the later discoveries, and in his north-east group, evidently intended for the Marquesas, distinctly afforded the names of ten, three of which agree with the subsequent discoveries. It is probable that upon a \u2022\u2022loser examination all could be traced, as Vaitahu is merely the name of one of the bays of Tahuata (Santa Christina.)"], [795, "MARQUESAS. 315 From the data thus furnished, a chart was constructed by Sir J. Banks, during Cook's first voyage, and it was not until the year 1774, in his second, that he knew any other names than those given by Mendafia.* It appears strange, however, that both Cook and Forster, having discovered the coincidence in the five islands, should not have attempted some westerly examination in 1774. The population of the whole group, as at present com puted by the resident French and English missionaries, amounts to 15,000. In 1774, Forster computed those in habiting the five islands only at 100,000 ! and later au thorities have reduced the whole group to 40,000. I place great reliance on the missionary statement. Our visit confines us, of course, to the island of Nuhu hiva and Port Anna Maria of Hergest, but it is never theless incumbent on me to state all I hear, leaving it to my readers to draw their own inferences. Much of our information has been derived from the assistance of the British missionary, Mr. Thompson, as well as from ques tions put to the native chiefs through our pilot. I am also aware that these people have been described by abler pens, and under greater advantages, perhaps, than our short visit and the nature of our occupations would seem to permit. It is nevertheless necessary to register our remarks ; we may not see with the eyes of others \u2014 important changes may have occurred \u2014 and, moreover, to men of habits of investigation many new features may present themselves. Unfortunately, the volumes of for mer navigators were not in our possession, to enable us * Voie R. F.jrsttr, Obs. Phy. Geog., Nat. Hist., &c."], [796, "316 MARQUESAS. > to draw stricter comparisons; but, on the other band they could not bias our observations. I cannot, however, exactly coincide with the summary character given in the five lines of the Geographical Encyclop\u00e6dia, unless indeed they are to apply to the Polynesian Islands, or savages in general. That de scription comprises in five words \u2014 bold, ferocious, un chaste, fiendly, and bloodthirsty. Upon none of these charges do I intend to defend them, although circumstances afforded me, perhaps, a better opportunity of seeing them nearer their own cha racters than those who have preceded me. I have already alluded to the warlike dispositions ex hibited at the period of my arrival. I was, indeed, any thing but a welcome guest ; yet, I immediately threw myself amongst them, and during my endeavours to stop the disposition to battle, had an opportunity of watching for those malignant passions in their leaders which could justify such harsh epithets. What was the reply of the king to my question \u2014 If you are victorious what is your final intention? \"To remove part of the Taioa people to this valley, and place part of mine there.\" This needs no comment. On the other hand, let us look to the enemy at Taioa Bay. What was their reply to our mission ? It was found, indeed, that they presented a superior race, not demoralized by the visits of whale ships, nor excited by intoxicating liquors, kava, or priestly instigation. They calmly awaited their threatened invasion, but without any hatred to their enemies. Their reply was, \" That they would gladly receive the king ' Moana' as a friend,"], [797, "317 MARQUESAS. and feast him, but not as their chief: at the same time they would defend their valley with vigour.\" When war has once commenced, \" and foe meets foe,\" who shall decide upon what is brutal or blood-thirsty ? Look not too closely into the battle field of Europe, or of civilized combatants. Cruelty, the inherent type of every savage, will be exercised according to the custom of the country, and until these people become civilized, their nature will be savage. I think, however, that the generality of visitors ascribe less of the savage to this group than elsewhere ; and a case in point, I think, will bear this out. In the case of the captain and mate of a whaler, not many years since cut off by the natives in Comptroller's Bay, the Teii, said to be the most ferocious on the island, seldom communi cating with their neighbours, and never with foreigners, \u2014 how did they act 1 They amused themselves by excit ing their fears. Having made a fire sufficiently large to bake them, a hog was substituted, which, when cooked, they were invited to partake of. They were afterwards ransomed. On no other island would their lives have been saved. Every navigator has agreed in describing the men as well-formed, active, and powerful. Their muscles are beautifully outlined, and the whole frame presents a roundness, fulness, and firmness, unusual in the Pacific. They resemble the Moors of the Morocco coast in this respect. Their gait and carriage is particularly erect, easy, and independent\u2014 proud, I should say ; reminding one of the high-bred horse. So much do they feel this superiority over visitors, that they ridicule the gait of"], [798, "318 MARQUESAS. Europeans. The expression of the eye is keen, but in vites, or almost demands, friendship : no stranger can resist the extended hand and gaze of the better class, without being wanting in good feeling. Once adopted as a friend, or names exchanged, your interests are closely watched, and carried to a higher pitch of disinterested ness, than can be found amongst the so much extolled Tahitans. There is evidently a great variety in the breed, the hue varying from that of a tanned European to the darkest West, Indian. Their hair is long, flowing, or curly, and generally dark. They are tattooed to the extreme, but I do not think so delicately or beautifully as I have noticed at Tahiti. Here it is almost in masses of bluish black, which gives a darker hue to the appearance ; more war like but less ornamental. They wear nothing but the customary maro round the loins, similar to all the Poly nesians. When dressed for war they are truly ridi culous. The head is cumbered with a scull-cap of heavy net work, ornamented with the jumbo bead and niother-of pearl plates, and surmounted by a set of fan-plumes of cock's feathers, which form a semicircle, of which the extremes of the shoulders form the diameter ; around the neck a string of heavy whale teeth,* with the points pro jecting forward. Above the maro on the waist a profu sion of tappa; in the right hand a musket, and in the left the large Marquesan fan. How they are to fight thus rigged is incomprehensible. * Similar ornament worn at the Feejees."], [799, "319 MARQUESAS. Three friends of the queen dowager, wishing to surprise me, suddenly darted into my path, thus accoutred. It is probable they thought to startle me, but it was too ridi culous to create anything beyond laughter. They are indolent in the extreme. Their wants are few, and supplied, in a great measure, by nature. With the exception of the cultivation of yams, plantains, and the bread fruit, their time is wholly devoted to ease and enjoyment. Occasionally they fish, but to little extent. Their canoes are very indifferent ; far inferior to those of any other islands where trees of sufficient, growth abound for their structure. On my first arrival I did not experience much civility from the king, high priest, or prime minister. Their dislike was natural. I had lowered them much, by denying any hope of aid, in force or countenance, from Great Britain, or any civilized nation. However, they gradually found their rambles terminate at my tent; and several hogs and presents of fruit at length oozed out. We were much disappointed, however, in general sup plies of this nature, as nothing but muskets would be taken in exchange. Possibly a stronger political feeling kept these three from openly exhibiting their friendship. The queen dow ager was averse to the war ; her party opposed it, and she was known to be my great ally. They even asserted that she had sent the enemy powder and arms, which I had furnished. The female part of the creation have generally been extolled as the finest models in the world. The first discoverers described them as possessing regular sea-"], [800, "320 MARQUESAS. tares, fine hands, beautiful feet, of elegant stature ; and, moreover, surpassing the most beautiful women of Lima. What Lima may have exhibited in 1595 we cannot exactly arrive at; but, at the present day, the comparison will not bear repetition. We were not fortunate enough to see any of these extraordinary beau ties. Their features are regular, complexion good, teeth perfect, hands neat, but feet far from elegant. Indeed, the term elegant, as applied to woman, does not belong to any condition out of the sphere of civilization. In stature they vary considerably ; from the sylph-like Spa niard to the substantial English bouncer. Of the latter order was the king's sister \u2014 who was well able to take her own part. Undoubtedly they are the finest of the sex we have met in Polynesia. The peculiar brilli ancy of the eyes and teeth, added to a soft languor of expression, which is seldom witnessed in polished society, has, I fear, bewildered the senses of their first visitants. They evidently witnessed more than we did. None of the extraordinary advances or impro prieties charged against them were displayed. They are also charged with want of affection or attachment. Of course we are not in a condition to negative this charge ; but I should, from personal observation, suspect this to be unfounded. In the instance of the queen dowager, she pretended, at all events, to doat on the memory of Com modore Porter ; displayed his presents and picture with a tear in her eye, and repeatedly inquired if I knew him. She is now rather old. At all events, grateful recollec tion remains."], [801, "321 MARQUESAS, In another case, where I had to investigate a serious quarrel between two English residents, the case evidently hinged upon conjugal affection. I have also remarked very great attachment towards each other. Other strong cases were related by the pilot. On the other hand, I think it not a little remarkable that, looking: on either hand at Tahiti, Sandwich Islands, or the Navigators, we notice marriages contracted with native women ; if the females, then, of the Marquesas bear such characters for beauty, surely it is strange that we do not observe them transplanted to some of those islands, or to the American continent. Their dress is very simple. A few folds of native cloth round the waist form a petticoat ; and a kind of shawl of similar material, gracefully passed obliquely across the body, completes their costume. They are particu larly fond of bathing ; and in this respect exhibited a proof of modesty, by selecting unfrequented spots. There are always exceptions. One great peculiarity the females enjoy at these islands is, their freedom from danger in war. They are consi dered as flags of truce, particularly chief women ; and can pass from side to side at pleasure. They are not subject to the exemption of eating with the males, as formerly in Tahiti and the Sandwich Islands. With respect to their religious amelioration, I much fear that the day is yet distant when they will be brought into comparison with Tahiti. There is no power to lead, no king to command ; and they are too impatient of resrtaint to listen to the missionaries. VOL. II. Y"], [802, "322 MARQUESAS. Another strong reason against any important change, is their original loose worship of images. Had they been accustomed to place faith in the heathen worship, as in other islands, their minds might have been directed to a more powerful source to which they should address their prayers."], [803, "*32l No. IV.\u2014 K U I K A H I.

Her Majesty's ship Sulphur was the school in which I more particularly studied geographic botany. Precon- ceived views, and results drawn from the perusal of the writings of scientific travellers, were here practically tested. Her extensive voyage, and rapid transition from one portion of land to another, afforded rich and most favourable sources of comparison. With a bias towards the subject, it was an occupation of delight to develope the principles of the study, and to apply them to a result. Climate is the basis on which the earliest data must be founded, and with the liberal use of instruments, observa- tions on temperature and humidity were in time col- lected. These, with observations on the physical condi- tion of the surface, furnish us with many of the circum- stances which govern the distribution of the flora of the world. What I have accomplished under these heads has been collected together, and form the subject of a lengthened paper, which, through the liberality of the proprietors of the Annals of Natural History, has been already published.

In the mean time they will be found eminently useful in studying the features of vegetation, and more particularly in leading the subject to the naturalization of plants \u2014 the great end and aim of geographic botany. My views respecting these regions have been more fully dwelt on in Sir W. J. Hooker's Journal of Botany for June 1842, and our space here does not permit me to enter on these at a greater length.

Extent. \u2014 An important portion of the northern hemi sphere is occupied by a vegetation entirely without trees, and covering a dreary, bleak, inhospitable surface, hardly capable, even in the most favoured spots, of any cultiva tion. Greenland composes much of this, and the region further comprises that part of America to the north of a line commencing at Hudson's Bay in 60\u00b0 N. lat., thence stretching to 68\u00b0 at the Mackenzie river, and continued to Behring's Straits ; with that part of Siberia to the north of 65\u00b0, and Iceland, Spitzbergen, and Melville island. The natural course of this line is with the forest, obeying its sinuosities and sweeps, and will be found to enclose a region of some peculiarities. The northern limit of course only ceases with the vegetation. Ph vsical Characters. \u2014 Th e surface is usually extremely rocky and rugged, destitute of soil, and maintaining its flora in sheltered valleys and ravines. It is now a re-"], [812, "330 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. ceived fact, that all those plants mutually existing in the northern parts of Europe and America are found in this region ; hence it seems to have been a region of trans mission, and to have been eminently active in supplying the northern parts of these two portions of the globe with many plants in common. Climate. \u2014 There are but two seasons, summer and winter, which succeed each other with surprising rapidity. The latter is severe and protracted, and occupies a large portion of the year; summer suddenly follows on its decline, and from the now protracted presence of the sun much heat is accumulated. The activity of the vegetation would appear to be in proportion to the duration and com pleteness of its dormant condition, and is very characte ristic. In Greenland, the range of the thermometer during the year is from 84\u00b0 to \u2014 48\u00b0, or 132 degrees. Flora. \u2014 Shrubs compose the larger vegetation ; they are not the large bushy plants known as such in tempe rate and warm climates, but are of d wars stature, and appear to be struggling against the elements to attain that state which nature has destined them to assume; thus some of them are only a few inches high'; still they are numerous, and have sometimes showy flowers with brilliant colours. Leguminos\u00e6, umbellifer\u00e6, caryophylle\u00e6, and crucifer\u00e6, have a smaller share in the vegetation than might be expected ; bnt ranunculace\u00e6, saxifrage\u00e6, and ericace\u00e6, hold a more important station, and the propor tion of gramine\u00e6 has greatly increased. It is, how ever, among cellulares that the greatest change is mani fest, particularly in musci. Greenland has a flora of 403 species, of which 172 are phenogamous,and231 cryptogamous. These are distributed among 137 genera and 45 natural families. On analysis, the phenogamous species are found to be in proportion"], [813, "331 NORTH-WEST AMERICA REGION. to the genus as 2 to 1, the cryptogamus as 4-5 to 1 ; taking the whole flora, the value of the genus is 2-9, of the natural family 3 ; of the phenogamous genus 2, of the cryptogamous 4*5 ; of the phenogamous family 23, of the crytogamous 7*3. The genera have few species compared with Iceland ; saxifraga, draba, ranunculus stellaria, cerastium, epilobium, pedicularis, eriophorum, juncus, carex, and salix, being the only phenogamous genera with more than three species. There are no trees; pyrus aucuparia reaches 61\u00b0 as a small shrub, and about a dozen species are peculiar. Iceland, situated between 63\u00b0 and 68\u00b0 N. lat.., has 652 species. Of these, 359 are phenogamous, and 293 crypto gamous. Umbellifer\u00e6 constitute 109th part, leguminos\u00e6 81st, crucifer\u00e6 40th, composit\u00e6 33rd, and gramine\u00e6 15th. The most numerous phenogamous genera are salix, saxi fragea, ranunculus, gentiana, veronica, potamogeton, plantago, epilobium, rumex, polygonum, geranium, hieraceum, gnaphalium, orchis, carex, juncus, agrostis, aira, poa, festuca. Melville island, in 75\u00b0 N. lat., has 116 species distri buted between 22 families ; or of phenogamous plants 67, and of cryptogamous 49. A few of the species are not found elsewhere, and it may have a genus of its own, at present an unsettled point. Relations. \u2014 The most interesting are with the three upper regions of alpine vegetation, where many of its characteristic features reappear. II.\u2014 THE NORTH-WEST AMERICA REGION. Extent. \u2014 The rocky mountains and Pacific Ocean on the east and west, and 68\u00b0 N. lat., and the Columbia river to the north and south, enclose this region. 8"], [814, "332 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. Physical Characters. \u2014 Thesurface is irregular, consist ing entirely of mountain and valley, without the least pre tensions to plain ; the former composed chiefly of primi tive rocks, among which granite is abundant, quartz is sometimes seen, and rarely, I believe, limestone. The soil is often rich, from the great accumulation and rapid decomposition of vegetable remains. Climate. \u2014 Being freely exposed to winds from the ocean, and westerly winds prevailing, the climate is con siderably modified. Compared with Europe, it is far cooler for the latitude, and with the opposite coast with out those extremes so common there. It is, however, much more moist than either, and the rainy days are very frequent. In 56\u00b0 N. lat., the mean temperature has been ascertained to be 45\u00b05, and the range of the year from 2\u00b03 to 81\u00b09. Only thirty-seven really clear and fine days were experienced, on forty-six snow fell, and on the rest more or less rain. This was at Sitka, or New Archangel. At the Columbia river in 46\u00b0 N. lat., being the southern limit, and with an interval from the above of ten degrees, the mean-temperature is 54\u00b0, the annual range from 18\u00b0 to 92\u00b0, number of rainy days 157, the quantity of rain 53*6 inches, and snow is rarely seen. Flora. \u2014 Though the inequalities of the surface are great, soil is abundant, and the investing vegetation vigo rous. The constant moisture favours premature decay' and thus the trees are early undermined, and falling from their ranks in the forest, cover the ground in vast num bers. It is not easy to conceive how thickly the surface is crowded with these, unless by recalling something like the vast accumulations of the coal measures. Within the tropics I have never seen anything equal to the scene of devastation the northern part of this region presents ; trunks of trees, of great length and clear of branches,"], [815, "333 NORTH-WEST AMERICA REGION. are seen on all sides strewed in tiers, and covered with a dense agamic vegetation. It would often seem that they were unable to attain a good old age, as, always exposed to moisture from the repeated rains, they have yielded to its influence immediately that period of life arrived when the activity of vegetation diminishes. Here everything is moist, the soil is completely saturated, mosses and lichens are in their liveliest vigour, and much of the surface is swampy. Tracing the regions from Prince William's Sound in 6\u00b0 north latitude to the east, and then to the south, the whole will be found to be covered with one vast forest. It extends to the north as far as the boundary line, and to the south, through several degrees of latitude, to the Columbia river, where a sudden change occurs, and which is a very decided line of demarkation between this and the California region. Returning for a moment to Prince William's Sound, a tongue of land stretches from it to Oonalaskaand the other islands of the Aleutian chain, over which there is no forest, and the only ap proach to trees is a few stunted spruces in the sheltered valleys. But the vegetation is very luxuriant, and to wards the close of summer the roses, willows, and lupins form a dense mass not easy to penetrate. At this time, on the sides of the lower mountains, sustaining towards their summits irregular patches of snow, there is a rich ness and quiet beauty about the flora particularly attrac tive, for many of the flowers are showy, and their colours clear and brilliant. Here especially are mimulus luteus, geranium eriostemon, lupinus nootkatensis, making the surface quite blue with its flowers, epilobium latifolium, polemonium humile, and some ferns and grasses, many of the latter of which are in common with Europe. Elsewhere the forest, though dense, consists of but few"], [816, "334 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. species; abies has three, which, witli cupressus thyoides, constitute all the larger trees, whilst some smaller are contributed by crat\u00e6gus, salix, cerasus, betula, and to the south diospyros. The undergrowth of shrubs is so extremely luxuriant, that it appears a chief characteristic, and, regardless of the shade of the forest, flourishes in great vigour. These shrubs are chiefly the species of vaccinium, men ziesia, rubus, and ribes, which, though numerous in spe cies, have a multitude of individuals. Towards the south, lonicera involucrata, mahonia glumacea, symphoria racemosa, gautheria shallon are superadded, and par ticularly aspidium munitum, a handsome fern, very social, and covering portions of the surface to the ex clusion of others. Another peculiarity is, that though some of the genera appear through several degrees of latitude, they are continued by new species ; thus ribes, rubus, rosa, and lupinus, are seen everywhere in the re gion, yet each species had but a small range, and is im mediately succeeded by another. Relations. \u2014 Two plants are common which are emi nently distinguished for their large foliage, and as members of famdies of a warmer climate ; panax hor ridum, a fine shrub with large showy leaves, upwards of a foot in length, has a range of growth from 45\u00b0 to 61\u00b0 north latitude ; and dracontium camtschaticum, with a very different habit, spreading its broad leaves over the surface, on the under side of which is usually a small hairy helix, abounds in moist situations from 61\u00b0 north latitude to the Columbia River, or 46\u00b019'. Mimulus guttatus has a wide habitat, extending from 59\u00b0 3(Y north latitude to 37\u00b0 in California. The herbaceous plants are of families common to these latitudes, though both crucifer\u00e6 and umbellifer\u00e6 are scarce, and the genera are"], [817, "THE CANADA REGION. 335 similar to the European with few exceptions. The southern part mixes but feebly with the California region, and the features are preserved singularly intact even to the banks of the Columbia. Here quercus commences with many others, abies ceases suddenly, and pinus partly supplies its place, nor disappearing from the elevated lands till it arrives in the vicinity of Panama. A collection of plants from its northern part contained about one half common with the north of Europe, and a similar number with Siberia. III.-THE CANADA REGION. Extent. \u2014 To the west the Rocky Mountains, and to the east the Atlantic Ocean; in the south a line commencing on the coast in 44\u00b0 north latitude, thence to the margin of Lake Erie and to the Mississippi, then taking a north, and afterwards a north-west direction by the north branch of the Saskatchawan river to the Rocky Mountains. Its northern outline is irregular, being determined by the forest; towards Hudson's Bay it crosses the country in 60\u00b0 north latitude ; but attains a higher latitude to the west, till it reaches 68\u00b0, near the Mackenzie River. Physical Characters. \u2014 Much of this surface is covered with forest. There are no important mountain chains, though smaller ranges separate several large plains. These have generally a fruitful alluvial soil, but wild rocky districts are not uncommon, too dreary and inhospitable to support a vigorous vegetation. The primary moun tains of the Iroquois region pass its southern boundary, and separate some plains in the vicinity of the lakes and the St. Lawrence, the luxuriant fertility of which,"], [818, "336 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. according to Murray, is almost unsurpassed, and whose characteristics are limestone rocks, waters highly charged with calcareous matter, and copious deposits of gypsum and marl. Nova Scotia, New Brunswrick, and the is lands, form an important portion of the region. Here granite, clay-stone, sandstone, and limestone, constitute the basis on which the soil reposes. In Prince Edward's Island the soil is fertile, and though occasional masses of granite occur, scarcely a stone or pebble is to be seen ; sandstone is the basis of the island, and clay abounds. In Newfoundland the surface is more rocky, secondary formations prevail, with coal and various sandstones. Of Labrador little more is known than that it is covered with a vast forest, and is unusually inclement for the latitude. Climate. \u2014 This varies considerably, but is every where severe for the latitude. Like the United States the extremes of temperature are intense, and with the anomaly that the seasons of Lower Canada run into greater extremes than Upper Canada, or that the range is greater near the sea than inland. Summer and winter succeed each other so rapidly, that spring and autumn are not distinguishable. About the close of October, sharp frosts commence, heavy falls of sleet and snow occur in November, and this state of the weather prevails till the middle or end of December, when it rapidly yields to a clear sky and a frosty atmosphere, which continue till nearly the end of March. A rapid change now takes place ; a fervid sun bursts forth, which melt ing the snows and unlocking the frozen streams, vegeta tion appears with magic haste, and every spot is beau tiful and green with verdure. From May to September inclusive, a warm and oppressive summer prevails. Flora. \u2014 Unlike the neighbouring Iroquois region, the"], [819, "THE IROQUOIS REGION. 337 forest offers little variety in its trees, these being chiefly spruces, as abies alba, a. nigra, a. canadensis, with occasionally thuja occidentalis, pinus resinosa, and larix microcarpa. Mixed with these are several trees with deciduous leaves, but they do not extend quite so far north, nor so completely enter into the composition of the forest ; quercus auibigua, betula papyracea, b. lenta, b. excelsa, populus balsamifera, p. tremuloides, p. grandidentata ; and with limits something more southern, acer saccharinum, a. rubrum, fagus ferru ginea, ulmus americana. A close compact forest is unfavourable to the humbler vegetation, and thus there is no great variety ; and in the present instance is more particularly characterised by shrubs of cerasus, sambucus, viburnum, salix, rhodora, sedum, kalmia, ribes, rubus, rosa, and amelanchier. Relations. \u2014 Among the herbaceous plants are many peculiar species, but almost always of genera widely diffused over other parts of the continent or of Europe. About half-a-dozen genera only seem peculiar. Wher ever, during a portion of the year, the climate possesses considerable warmth, there will generally be found re presentatives of forms belonging more abundantly to warmer latitudes ; here, accordingly, are met with two species of panax, two of aralia, and drac\u00e6na borealis. IV\u2014 THE IROQUOIS REGION. Extent. \u2014 I have attempted, in the name of this region, toconnect the memory of the brave Indians with the magnificent forests they once claimed as their own. The word was applied collectively to several tribes of North Americans, well known in their day as the Six Nations, VOL. II. Z"], [820, "338 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. and closely concerned in the early political transactions of this country. They were the admiration of their co temporaries, but nothing now remains of them, unless sufficient of their history to adorn a tale. Perhaps a few solitary descendants may be traced out, far from the land of their fathers, but no more. The forests them selves are disappearing under the thrift and industry of their greatest enemy, the white man ; the trees that once sheltered the Indian lodge are falling beneath the axe of the regenerator ; and the trackless forest, so often traversed by the skilful hunter and dauntless war rior, is now covered with corn-fields, canals, and rail roads. The boundary of this region commences on the coast of the Atlantic in 44\u00b0 north latitude, and proceeds, just skirting the southern margin of Lake Erie, onward to the Mississippi. It now continues along the edge of the forest on its western shore, approaching it more closely at its mouth than in its northern course ; and afterwards crossing Florida in 27\u00b0 north latitude, with the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean, it incloses an irregular parallelogram of about 690,000 square miles. Physical Characters. \u2014 This surface is unequally di vided by the Alleghany mountains, which slope towards the Atlantic and the Mississippi. The latter has also a gra dual and regular ascent from the Gulf of Mexico to the lakes of Canada, of 1,200 feet. Both of these plains abound in a fruitful soil wherever the forest has been removed, but superior fertility and excellence belongs to that between the mountains and the Mississippi. The mountain system, though attaining no great elevation, has a length of 1,200 miles, and occupies a belt of about one hundred, of which two-thirds are estimated to consist of valleys. It traverses the region obliquely from north-"], [821, "THE IROQUOIS REGION. 339 \u201e\u201est to south-west, and has an average height of between 2,000 to 3,000 feet, the highest summits never exceeding the latter. There are elsewhere some loftier elevations, Mount Washington being 6,428 feet, and the Black Mountain in Carolina 6,476 feet. The Alleghanies are divided into four distinct ridges, and are chiefly composed of primary stratified rocks. This stratification is very generally prevalent, and one of its effects is visible in the numerous cascades, falls, and rapids of the rivers. Gneiss, granite, sienite, and hornblende are frequent in the northern parts, and are equally the basis of the plains as of the mountains. Towards the south the granitic rocks in a great measure disappear, and are supplanted by an extensive limestone formation. Much of the surface of the plain between the mountains and the Atlantic is covered by sand, which in many instances is far more productive than might be imagined, from, it is supposed, a submersion to which it was formerly exposed. There are likewise extensive patches of marsh or moist meadow land, and nearer the sea occasionally inundated districts. Climate. \u2014 With so wide an extent of latitude, there will be much difference in the climate. Generally it may be called a climate of extremes, particularly in the northern part, where this feature is experienced in greatest force. The vicissitudes are great, and accom plished with much rapidity; the extreme of heat and cold even in a single day is immense, and it has been known to be 41\u00b0 ; 28\u00b0 is mentioned as common. After the hottest days, the nights may be piercingly cold. An American writer has summed up a detail of his climate by observing, that in spring it has the moisture of Britain, in summer the fervid heats of Africa, in June the bland warmth of Italy, in winter the snows of Norway and z 2"], [822, "340 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. the ice of Holland, the tempestuous winds of the West Indies, and in all seasons the variable weather of Great Britain. Such a combination is not likely to be favour able to the human race, but under it the vegetation is udoubtedly varied and luxuriant. Plants love a warm atmosphere, especially if combined with.brilliancy of the sun's rays ; and a succeeding cold season, instead of proving hurtful, seems rather to prepare them to expand in the coming summer with unusual vigour. Flora. \u2014 A vast impervious forest once covered the whole eastern part of North America. Towards the north it commenced around the shores of Hudson's Bay, reaching as far as 60\u00b0 ; and stretched towards the south in one broad mass, bounded on one side by the Atlantic Ocean, and on the other by the Mississippi, the father of rivers. It did not quite confine itself to the east side, but crossing the river, continued down its west bank in a belt of fifty or a hundred miles broad. The only interrup tions throughout its extent were occasioned by two in roads of prairie, mentioned under that region. To the south it received no check till it arrived on the margins of the Mexican Sea. A portion of this forest comprises the present region. Beyond the northern boundary of the latter the forest consists of but few species, but to its south a new state of things prevails ; for many new and extensive genera now contribute their species, and bestow an unrivalled variety. One hundred and fifty distinct kinds of trees are known, of which eighty attain an height upwards of sixty feet. Of these the most peculiar to the region are the various carya, nyssa, liriodendron, taxo- dium, robinia, and gymnocladus. A small part only of this sorest has been removed ; but where this has hap pened a material change has been produced in the vegetation. Its original herbaceous plants, which re-"], [823, "341 THE IROQUOIS REGION. quired shelter and protection, have disappeared from the clearings, and were replaced by strangers. But if the forest again resumes possession of the soil the old inha bitants return, to the exclusion of the intruders. The numerous species furnishing these trees are, with few exceptions, peculiar, and, including* those just mentioned, belong to the following genera, many of them having several species: \u2014 Quercus, ulmus, pinus, juglans, dios pyros, cupressus, acer, negundo, laurus, celtis, gleditschia, virgilia, magnolia, tilia, maclura, resculus, pavia, corylus, fraxinus, ostrya, juniperus, morus, rhus, rosa, euonymus, rhamnus, hamiltonia, hydrangea, prinos, clethra, kal uiia, crat\u0153gus, comptonia, myrica, sorbus, halesia, her beris, olea, philadelphus, malus, cerasus, gordonia ; but many of the latter are only shrubs.

A strong tendency exists in the southern portions to display tropical characters, as is evident from some of the endogen\u00e6 already mentioned, and is farther confined by tillandsia, bromelia, epiphytic orchidace\u00e6, chani\u00e6rops palmetto, and other palms; sapindus, passiflora, turnera, bignonia, croton, and pontederia. The monouiic* families are very few, and are confined to podophyllace\u00e6, sarraceniace\u00e6, and limnanthace\u00e6 ; of genera 332 are monouiic in North America, which is certainly a large number to have so limited a range. There are two which are singularly absent, erica and ficus ; for the latter might be expected in the south, since it is so plentiful in the low lands of Mexico. The forest trees are so numerous, that was it our opinion that vege- * Confined to one region."], [825, "343 THE IROQUOIS REGION. tation was diffused from centres, we should almost con sider this as that whence the temperate regions of the world had been supplied. Leguminos\u00e6 bear among them a great proportion for the latitude Others are remarkable for the size and brilliancy of their flowers ; occasionally for their glossy leaves; and the autumnal tints of an American forest have long charmed the ima ginative observer. Gramine\u00e6 are feebly represented, and to some extent their place is supplied by junce\u00e6 and cyperace\u00e6, which love the marshy lands. The range of growth of some of the trees has been carefully observed. Quercus virens, the live oak, is found along the shores of the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico to the Sabine river, but not more than twenty miles from the sea, and ceases at 37\u00b0 N. latitude. Quercus prinus, the chesnut oak, abounds in the Atlantic states south of 41\u00b0; q. stellata, the post oak, in Maryland, Virginia, and the upper parts of Georgia and the Carolinas, preferring a dry gravelly soil ; q. montana, the rock chesnut oak, valuable in ship-building, grows in stony soils on the Hudson, Lake Champlain, and in the Alleghanies of Pennsylvania and Virginia. Juglans nigra is common in a deep and fertile soil south of 43\u00b0. Acer saccharinum-* the sugar maple, ranges chiefly from 43\u00b0 to 46\u00b0, but is common in some parts of Pennsylvania and Genessee. Besides sugar, it yields potash abundantly, good charcoal, and a valuable wood. A. nigrum, the black sugar maple, is found farther south, and chiefly abounds in the vicinity of the rivers of the west. It yields sugar freely, but is less generally useful than the former. Betula papyracea, the canoe birch, is a northern tree, not descending be yond 43\u00b0. B. lenta occurs from 40\u00b0 to 48\u00b0, and farther south on the summits of the Alleghanies. B. nigra, on the banks of the rivers, from 41\u00b0 to Georgia. Lauras"], [826, "344 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. carolinieusis, the red bay, in swamps to the south of 37\u00b0. Diospyros virginiana is common in the United States south of 41\u00b0. Asimina triloba, the papaw, but not to be confounded with carica papaya, ceases at 40\u00b0. Populus angulata grows only to the south of 39\u00b0. Cham\u00e6rops palmetto stretches along the coast of the Atlantic to 35\u00b0. This palm grows to forty or fifty feet high, and has some useful qualities. The wood is in request for wharfs and other submersed buildings, as it is not attacked by worms ; it also will not splinter when struck by cannon balls. Cornus florida only grows south of 43\u00b0. Nyssa villosa, the sour gum, south of 41\u00b0. N. biflora, the black gum, to 43\u00b0, and always in moist situations. Fraxinus acuminata abounds to the north of 41\u00b0, and its wood is so valuable for strength and elasticity, that it is exported. Ulmus americana thrives best from 42\u00b0 to 46\u00b0, but is found generally. Its wood is inferior to the European. Pinus resinosa, the red pine, is not seen south of 43\". P. palustris, a valuable tree for its wood, its copious resin, and as occupying a very arid soil, commences at Norfolk, in 37\u00b0, and stretches along the coast for 600 miles, and with a breadth of 100. P. t\u00e6da, the loblolly pine, exclusively to the south of 38\u00b0. P. strobus chiefly be tween 43\u00b0 and 47\u00b0; and the tallest kinds are used for the masts of vessels. Abies canadensis, the hemlock spruce, has the same range as the last. A. nigra, chiefly from 44\u00b0 to 53\u00b0. Its wood is preferred for spars, and spruce beer is made from its branches. A. alba has a similar range. Thuja occidentalis, lignum vit\u00e6, or white cedar, grows with the spruces. Taxodium distichum, the bald cypress, is peculiar to swamps south of 38\u00b0. Juniperus virginiana, the red cedar, prevails south of 44\u00b0 in dry exposed situations.* * For much of these details I am indebted to the interesting sketch of the"], [827, "THE CALIFORNIA REGION. 345 Relations. \u2014 This region is so rich in variety that very extensive relations might be expected, but though these are certainly numerous, the peculiarity of its flora is very striking. With Europe it might be supposed to have many species in common; yet of 2,891 phanerogamic, only 385 re-appear there. The proportionate scarcity of umbellifer\u00e6, crucifer\u00e6, and trifoliuin, is somewhat re markable ; and in examining the vegetation we cannot fail to be impressed how closely the productions of cold and hot regions are brought together, and consequently how much the intermediate temperate portion is compressed. This appears to be the reason why the groups just men^ tioned are so little seen. With the China region there are some interesting points of resemblance, through hydran gea, cocculus, and others ; with South Africa in auiaryl lide\u00e6, India in scitamine\u00e6 ; and with the Patagonia and California regions through berberis, and many other genera with the latter. Clusia rosea is met with in Carolina, and several cinchonace\u00e6 prevail through the region to the vicinity of the lakes. V.\u2014 THE CALIFORNIA REGION. Extent. \u2014 After crossing the Columbia river from the north, an entirely altered vegetation commences. The dense compact fore-ots of abies cease suddenly, and are sup planted by an open country, spotted by occasional clump of oaks, and the river lines fringed by platanus, fraxi nus, juglans, and salix. The outline of the region may botany of the United States, as in the American edition of Murray's Ency clop\u00e6dia of Geography. 4"], [828, "346 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. be traced up the Columbia river to the Rocky Mountains, which it meets in about 50\u00b0 N. latitude, and is continued along them to the south, till approaching the com mencing waters of the Colorado, it runs along its course to the gulf of California. The remaining portion is cir cumscribed by the Pacific Ocean. Physical Characters. \u2014 In its northern part the sur face is regular, and there are some well-watered fine allu vial plains, without a rock or stone. Occasionally ranges of low mountains traverse it, chiefly of porphyry, basalt, and jasper, which are not of sufficient elevation to affect materially the vegetation, but support some groves of pinus lambertiana and abies religiosa ; pinus rigida prefers the plains. The broad plains which separate them are often overflowed in the winter, which with their deep rich soil renders them very fertile. To the south, the scenery is wild and rugged, nearly altogether moun tainous, the ranges running from north to south. Not a tree is to be seen, but there is a moderate sprinkling of a more lowly and interesting vegetation. The prevailing rocks here are serpentine, gneiss, basalt, and greenstone. There is no soil nor fertilizing streams, water being very scarce. Climate. \u2014 To the north the climate is even and tem perate ; the winters are mild and of short, duration, and snow appears on the loftier hills ; and the summers have an agreeable warmth, with the atmosphere clear and transparent. In the autumn the dews are excessively heavy. The summers of the southern portion are warmer, the temperature being generally from 60\u00b0 to 74\". The rains are soon over, but during their continuance deluge the country. The atmosphere is particularly clear, and it would also appear dry, as when signs of the"], [829, "347 THE CALIFORNIA REGION. wet season were gathering in the heavens, the dew-point was 62\u00b0, the shade 72\u00b0 ; and at the same time the sun's rays were 115\u00b0. Flora. \u2014 The finest part of this region is to the north, where an open country prevails, varied by patches of trees of noble growth. Of the oaks, two species are deci duous, and two evergreen. The latter are confined to the neighbourhood of the sea coast between 38\u00b0 and 34\u00b0 N. latitude. The other trees are not numerous, and are chiefly comprised under platanus, acer, pavia, juglans, cornus, laurus regia, and the aromatic tetranthera cali fornica. It is among these forest trees that the chief relations with the Iroquois region is established, and it is one of affinity. The undergrowth consists of several species of rubus, ribes, lupinus, rhus, vaccinium, arbutus, and lonicera ; and such is the variety of some of these, that a new species may be met with almost every hun dred miles. Vitis, scarcely expected, grows abundantly on the margins of some of the rivers. Shrubby com posit\u00e6 prevail throughout, but are in the greatest inten sity towards the centre of the region ; and in the more arid parts cacte\u00e6 and euphorbiace\u00e6 are particularly nu merous, with a few leguminos\u00e6. Cacte\u00e6 are not seen further north than 34\u00b0 ; here also is the limit of ricinus communis, of course introduced, as is ph\u0153nix dacty lifera, a few large trees of which may be seen about San Diego, but only yielding a sour fruit- As characteristic peculiarities of the region may be mentioned, its great aridity, general scarcity of trees, superior prevalence of cacte\u00e6, composit\u00e6, and euphor biace\u00e6, great number of plants with lactescent juices, and with fragrant foliage, the frequent developement of the flowers and leaves at different periods, and the general small range of its species. The negative features consist"], [830, "348 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. in the scarcity of ferns, mosses, and fungi, none of which exist in the southern part, except perhaps the latter during the rains. Lichens, with sickly aspects, occa sionally cling to the trees or rocks. Relations. \u2014 California, though less known, has an equally fine climate with the south of Europe, Chili, the Cape of Good Hope, or New South Wales ; and with these parts of the world has a general resemblance in its vegetation. In establishing a comparison between the western and eastern parts of the American continent, a superiority must be assigned in the forest trees to the east, and in the herbaceous vegetation to the west. VI. THE PRAIRIE REGION. Extent. \u2014 This is a peculiar tract enclosed by the vast forests of North America. It extends from within a hundred miles of the west bank of the Mississippi to the Rocky Mountains, stretching to 54\u00b0 N. latitude, and again only bounded on the south by the wooded country of the Texas and the Mexican Sea. The outline is tolerably regular, except that two processes cross the above river ; one penetrating the states of Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio; and the other farther south, stretching into Alabama. Physical Characters. \u2014 The prairie is far from being a continuous extensive plain, and in this respect must yield to the Pampas. It consists rather of an assemblage of plains, often with slightly undulating surfaces, and frequently covered with a fruitful soil ; their level being occasionally broken by projecting masses of rocks or ranges of low hills. The subjacent structure is com posed of red or grey saliferous sandstone, chiefly the"], [831, "349 THE TRAIRIE REGION. former, with beds of clay. Chloride of sodium abounds with other salts, and are found largely in the vicinity of the Rocky Mountains, and in the northern part of the region. Gypsum likewise occurs, and gravel, sand, or boulders occasionally prevail. Climate. \u2014 The long droughts to which the prairie is liable have been supposed to preclude the existence of shrubs or trees, and to be favourable to the more fuga cious grasses. Heavy rains sometimes fall, and during their continuance rivers spring up, and gliding over the country, nourish a lively vegetation. In the dry season these soon shrink to small streams, disconnected chains of ponds or marshes, or entirely disappear. Flora. \u2014 This extensive portion of country supports a by no means insignificant flora. Gramine\u00e6 is the most important group, and is represented by numerous festuca, bromus, stipa, aristida, poa, agrostis, crypsis, k\u00e6leria, hordeum, eriocoma, and others. Grasses flourish more particularly in the northern part, yielding gradually towards the south to various herbaceous composit\u00e6, some cucurbitace\u00e6, vites, scrophularine\u00e6, solane\u00e6, boragine\u00e6, and euphorbiace\u00e6. The peculiarities of the region are derived chiefly from the absence of trees, the great preponderance of gramine\u00e6 and of composit\u00e6 through the genera rudbeckia, helianthus, silphium, Coreopsis, and other allied groups, and in the scarcity of bulbous plants in a situation, where, from a comparison with the Cape of Good Hope and other places, they might be supposed to exist. Cacte\u00e6 appear farther north in the prairie than in the California region, and are often ac companied in both by a yucca. However interesting the Rocky Mountains may prove to the geologist, they have no flora sufficient to give them any individuality as a region. They are as destitute of"], [832, "350 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. arborescent vegetation as the prairie, and the interesting herbaceous plants found among them are only a portion of this flora. If their latitude generally is considered, they will be found incapable of possessing any important alpine vegetation, and even around their bases the snow will lie long aud perseveringly on the ground. Relations. \u2014 Towards the south this region becomes gradually blended with the California and Chihuahua regions : an analogy with the pampas is established through the numerous gramine\u00e6; and with the northern regions by numerous crucifer\u00e6 and umbellifer\u00e6, but those of the prairie are nearly all peculiar. The more interest ing relation exists with the Steppes of Tartary, with which it has many points in common. The chief relation is that of affinity, the same genera being represented in both by different species; among these are artemisia, astragalus, thermopsis, sophora, glycyrrhiza, fritillaria, and diotis ; and rheum is replaced by the analogous genus eriogonum. VII.\u2014 THE CHIHUAHUA REGION. Extent. \u2014 This name is pronounced Chi-wah-wah, and though the designation may appear somewhat novel, on the spot it is in extensive use ; but almost equally little is known of the inhabitants, productions, and flora. On account of the barrenness of information respecting the latter, we can hardly more than indicate this region. Though an important portion of Mexico, it differs from it in many respects, and it is necessary to draw a strong line of demarcation, since the very name of Mexico is apt to convey to the mind of the botanist an association of characters certainly not pertaining to this part of the"], [833, "351 THE CENTRAL AMERICA REGION. republic. On the north it has the Prairie Region, sweep ing round it even to the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, and meeting the Central America Region, thus completely separating it from the Atlantic. To the south, it ceases about the limit of the tropic, and on the west it has the Gulf of California, and the Rio Colorado. Physical Characters. \u2014 Bold and mountainous. Climate. \u2014 Cold for the latitude, and apparently liable to vicissitudes. Flora. \u2014 A thin forest occasionally covers part of the surface ; at other times the vegetation is lowly, and there are broad spots entirely without any. The general cha racter is rugged and austere, the land rising rapidly to a moderate elevation. Hence the climate is cool for the latitude, and the productions those of ten or fifteen de grees farther north. Steep precipices, and narrow passes abound, with the customary attendants of stern mountain scenery. Between the various ranges are fertile plains well adapted to agriculture, and the valleys are often very productive. Nitre and common salt are sometimes mixed copiously with the soil, depriving it of fertility. Composit\u00e6 are numerous ; some are shrubby, but the tribe coreopside\u00e6 more particularly prevails. Cacte\u00e6 are com mon ; a few amaryllide\u00e6, some showy and interesting spieces of labiat\u00e6, and perhaps also of scrophularine\u00e6 and boragine\u00e6. Relations. \u2014 Unknown. VIII.\u2014 THE CENTRAL AMERICA REGION. Extent. \u2014 The southern portion of the republic of Mexico, the whole of the Federal States of Central America, and a portion of New Granada ; it thus extends"], [834, "352 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. from the north tropic to the Gulf of St. Michael in the Bay of Panama, but sends a tongue to meet the Prairie Region, on the Mexican Sea. In elevation it attains 4,500 feet, or the commencement of the cultivation of wheat ; and the lowland cultivation ceases about this, which is inconsiderable for the latitude. Humboldt's warm region ceases at 600 metres, or 1,968 feet, but this is no limit to either the introduced or natural productions. Physical Characters. \u2014 That part comprising the Mexican States, and the Upper States of Central America, rises rapidly from the shores of both seas to the elevated and peculiar table-lands of this part of America. Near both shores the soil is productive, if not abundant, but on leaving them the surface is usually rugged, and broken by huge masses of granite, porphyry, serpentine, or bazalt. This part of the region is composed almost en tirely of these primary rocks, very few of secondary for mation being known to exist. More to the south, aud near the Isthmus of Panama, the country is far more even, the continuity of the Andes being completely broken, and in the vicinity of the lakes of Leon and Nicaragua is so even that no perceptible inequality can be noticed on traversing it, and the greatest difference is no where more than a few yards. Here the soil is rich and abundant, very productive, and capable of yielding many successive crops. Climate. \u2014 The seasons are tropical, the rains com mencing from April to June, according to the latitude, and lasting five months. During the rest of the year a hot sun and clear sky prevail. Flora. \u2014 This region belongs to that variety of tropical vegetation where leguminos\u00e6, &c, prevail, and hence we infer a certain aridity of soil and atmosphere. In this respect it yields greatly to the Oronoco Region, and"], [835, "353 CENTRAL AMERICA REGION: though Schouw combines them in his anomalous region of Cacte\u00e6 and Piperace\u00e6, I venture to separate them, after some practical acquaintance with both. Everywhere a forest exists, but it is usually a thin open forest : the trees are not distinguished either for stature or bulk, and there is a scarcity of undergrowth. In this latter respect there is a very remarkable difference between it and the North- West America Region. Nor is the variety of the forest trees great ; h\u00e6matoxylon campechianum is common ; swietenia mahagoni and cedrela odorata are gregarious in the neighbourhood of the lakes, and very numerous as individuals. Mimose\u00e6 are particularly abundant on the summits and sides of the hills, where there is any expo sure, and the larger kinds convey a particularly airy and picturesque effect. Bauhinia, hymen\u00e6a, and schrankia, have several species. Ficus is also numerous, and from the manner of growth is highly distinctive ; one species has a strange partiality for encasing the trunk of the cham\u00e6rops palmetto, of which instances are numerous. Tropical endogen\u00e6 are not frequent, a few scitamine\u00e6, musace\u00e6, and commeline\u00e6 appearing only in the wet season; passiflora, piper, melastoma, and ferns, are not common ; cacte\u00e6 are spread over the region, but are not in such vigorous existence as elsewhere. Agave ameri cana, salvia, hyptis, asclepias, viscum, loranthus, mikania, cordia, geraschanthus, heliotropium, tourne fortia, quassia, datura, and solanum, are most frequent in the vegetation. Palm\u00e6 are almost comprised in cham\u00e6rops palmetto, bactris minor, cocos nucifera, a licuala, and a ph\u0153nix. Relations. \u2014 The extensive existence of ficus is a source of resemblance with the Indian forest. Cacte\u00e6 are very generally diffused, though never in any intensity, and through them a general character is maintained VOL. II. A A"], [836, "354 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. with all America, subject to a warm or even temperate climate. It yields to the West India Region in the num ber, variety, and luxuriance of its vegetation, but its closest connexion is here ; also to the South American tropical regions; and, considering its situation, is far from being rich or productive. Within it, it must be remembered, is an alpine region, and the celebrity the flora has enjoyed is shared between them. On the west coast, in 19\u00b0 N. latitude, I saw a solitary tree of metrosideros glomuli fera, which conveys an interesting relation with New Holland. IX. THE MEXICO ALPINE REGION. Extent. \u2014 The Mexican mountains, above 4,500 feet, between 12\u00b0 and 22\u00b0 north latitude. This height is the lower boundary of the cultivation of wheat, and on the elevated plains it thrives admirably, when fed by regular irrigation. Since latitude within the tropics has such a trifling influence on climate, the difference in the alpine range of growth of vegetation on the mountains of Mexico and the Ecuador is surprising. In the latter, Quercus is not seen lower than 5,800 feet, but in Mexico it commences suddenly at 2,700 feet. Physical Characters. \u2014 The distribution of the Mexi can highlands is remarkable. Instead of rising gradually to a lofty sierra or ridge, as in the Andes of South America, the ascent suddenly ceases in a broad expanded table land with an elevation from 4,000 to 8,000 feet. On this are placed many active volcanos, and it is likewise diversified by ridges of low hills and numerous lakes, whence mountain streams take their origin. Climate. \u2014 The mean heat is perhaps lower than might be expected, and in the less elevated situations thin ice is"], [837, "MEXICO ALPINE REGION. 355 common in the winter. At times the power of the sun's rays is very great. Flora. \u2014 The character of the vegetation varies ; much is covered by a thin forest of trees, stunted, and crooked in their growth, and struggling among rugged volcanic rocks; and also by large fertile plains, sustaining a varied and abundant flora, through which run clear streams, fringed with trees of very European aspect and many lively plants. Still there are places extremely barren, and where exposure and the absence of water have excluded all vegetation. There is, however, no want of fertility, and the variety in the climate is fa vourable to a multitude of fruits and vegetables. The tropical productions of the plains soon cease, and leave the region in the possession of trees, shrubs, and her baceous plants, whose analogies are with temperate and even cold climates. Quercus has nearly twenty species, which grow through a great variety of elevation, and cease only at about 10,000 feet; one authority says 10,400, and another 9,843 feet. This genus is widely distributed through the continent ; to the north we find it with deciduous leaves, on the east coast in 45\u00b0, and on the west in 47\u00b0 ; it soon becomes an evergreen, and as cending the mountain sides, does not cease till it has crossed the equator. Recalling that many of its species are found on the Himma-leh mountains, in Java, and other Indian islands, its partiality for low latitudes is very decided. Wheat ceases to be cultivated at the same elevation, and previously rye and barley are mixed with it. Pinus occidentalis is frequent, ranging between 6,100 and 13,000 feet, and as far south as 12\u00b0 north latitude. There is another species, I believe as yet un described, with long cones and longer leaves. It is found around Tepic in the northern part of the region, com- A A 2"], [838, "356 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. mencing at 3,500 feet. Other trees and shrubs are sup plied by abies hirtella, cupressus thurifera, c. sabi noides, taxodium distichum, taxus montana, alnus mex icana, salix several species, aniygdalus microphylla, cheirostemon platanoides, mespilus pubescens, and se veral species of arbutus, arctostaphylos, vaccinium, rosa, and ribes. Relations. \u2014 With temperate Europe and America it has many genera in common, as senecio, cnicus, draba, ranunculus, anemone, arenaria, stachys, pedicularis, myo sotis, polemonium, galium, cornus, and caprifolium ; but a firmer connexion with the latter is established through lupinus, ageratum, and chelone; yet nearly every species is peculiar. The more peculiar genera are ' mirabilis, mau randya, leucophyllum, hoitzia, georgina or dahlia, zinnia, sckhuria, ximenesia, lopezia, vauquelinia, choisya, and cheirostemon.' It possesses, in common with other alpine regions, the negative character of having no peculiar natural family, and comparatively few genera; its indi viduality depends on species. Through quercus and pinus, and some of the herbaceous genera, it is con nected more closely with the Himma-leh than with the Andes region. X.\u2014 THE WEST INDIA REGION. Extent. \u2014 The West India Islands, the Bahamas, and the extremity of Florida, south of 27\u00b0 north latitude, com pose this region, which, with the exception of the latter, is the same as Schouw's. It possesses all the vigour and luxuriance of an island climate within the tropics, where moisture is ever ready in the atmosphere to feed vege tation ; and the elevation of the surface, which in Cuba"], [839, "357 WEST INDIA REGION. attains nearly 9,000 feet, is also sufficient to produce a variety in the productions. The whole is situated be tween 10\u00b0 and 27\u00b0 north latitude. Physical Characters. \u2014 These islands vary much in their character and geological formation. They admit of a twofold division ; the volcanic rising to elevated summits, covered with forest, abundantly supplied with streams of water, and very fertile, as St. Vincent, St. Lucie, Martinique, Dominica, and Guadaloupe ; the others, principally composed of limestone, are low, less watered, by no means so productive, and sometimes even sterile, such as Barbadoes, Tobago, Antigua, and Bar buda. Cuba, the most extensive island, is chiefly covered with forest, and has a superficies of 54,000 square miles. A chain of mountains traverses it from east to west, which rises into several peaks, and sends many streams to the plains below. The mountain chain is composed of granite, syenite, gneiss, and mica slate, and the lower lands of secondary formations, and they are eminently fertile and productive. Jamaica has a super ficies of 4,256 square miles, and the Blue Mountains, whose greatest elevation is 7,278 feet, make an agreeablo variety in the climate, and a healthy retreat for the invalid. These are chiefly composed of transition rocks, with, nearer the coast, red sandstone, marl, and limestone reposing on them. Some parts are alluvial, and generally well watered and fruitful. St. Domingo has an area of 28,000 square miles, and the central mountain peaks are lofty, La Serrania attaining 9,000 feet, and La Sella, 7,000 feet. Their flanks support noble forests, and are traced by numerous fertilizing streams. Puerto Rico contains 240 square miles, and is equally fertile with the rest. Its highest part is about 4,000 feet, and it has several fertile valleys and plains. The Bahamas comprise a"], [840, "358 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. numerous group, composed of sandstone; and though the soil is generally dry and rocky, they yield soma good timber. Climate. \u2014 The temperature is usually equable, but must be called warm ; the range is therefore inconsider able, and the mean at different places will vary from 73\u00b0 to 81\u00b0. It is only on the accession of a north wind, that much deviation occurs, and then even ice is stated to be produced, but those islands most to windward are the greatest sufferers. Flora. \u2014 Originally nearly the whole of this region was covered with forest ; a few exceptions might only be found where tropical grasses occupied the surface. . Now cultivation has removed an important portion, but ex tensive woods still exist. Swietenia mahagoni abounds in several islands, as does] also guaicum officinale, with various species of myrtus, uvaria, laurus, and melastoina. The sameness these might otherwise produce is broken by several palm\u00e6, and especially by the arborescent ferns, whose peculiar beauty is highly characteristic of the scenery. Ferns are generally very abundant, and assume a tropical variety of stature and habit. The most pre valent and characteristic are asplenium arboreum, cyath\u00e6a arborea, c. speciosa, c. muricata, with numer ous species of polypodium, pteris, aspidium, gymno gramma, acrostichum, and adiantum. A multitude of twining plants festoon the vegetation, lashing it into an impervious mass, belonging to convolvuluce\u00e6, passi flore\u00e6, some leguminos\u00e6, assisted by interesting kinds of paullinia and aristolochia. Orchidace\u00e6 are very abundant, particularly the extensive genus epidendrum, and species of oncidium, bletia, catasetum, and spiran thes are also numerous. The claims of Florida south of 27\u00b0 north latitude to"], [841, "359 WEST INDIA REGION. be considered a part of this region, are established through tillandsia, sapindus, indigofera, chrysobalanus, rhexia, croton, jatropha, and several others. Relations. \u2014 The position of this region between the large continents of America insures an intimate relation with them, modified by its insular situation. This is, however, stronger with South than North America, per haps arising from the moister atmosphere common to both, for there are no other circumstances which are not equally shared by the Central America region. With the South American regions it is strongly related by similar genera of palm\u00e6, passiflore\u00e6, orchidace\u00e6, pluni bagine\u00e6, cordiace\u00e6, and arborescent and herbaceous ferns. With the central America region the connexion is through ficus, a few orchidace\u00e6, asplenium arboreum, swietenia mahagoni, pinus occidentalis, and some others, particularly those of the sandy shores, as hippo mane mancinella. There is a singular absence of quercus in the higher lands, considering how very numerous the species are in the Mexico alpine region within the same latitude. It has all the luxuriance of other insular re gions within the tropics, and is unsurpassed by them in the variety of its ferns and orchidace\u00e6, as none others have a similar number for a given space. In the latter, the Pacific islands are much poorer, perhaps from the absence of the dense forest they appear to love. Wyd leria portoriccensis and lepidium virginicum, two cruci ferous plants, are found on the island, indicated by the specific name of the former."], [842, "360 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. XL\u2014 THE ORONOCO REGION. Extent. \u2014 That vast portion of South America, stretch ing from the Cordillera of the Andes to the Atlantic, and from the Carribean Sea to the Rio Plata, presents several divisions characterised by certain physical features. From the elevated lands of the interior of the continent three sets of rivers take their origin, and after tra versing huge basins, are at length emptied into the ocean in three directions, to the north, the east, and the south. The vegetable productions of the divisions have also their peculiarities, which are sufficiently dis tinct to authorise a separation ; and assuming a designa tion from the principal river of each, we have the Oronoco Region, the Amazon Region, and the Paraguay Region, the boundaries of which are conveniently traced along the ridges of those secondary mountains, at the bases of which their tributaries have their origin. The Oronoco Region occupies the northern part of South America, and a line running along the sierra of Araray, and traversing the continent to the Bay of Guayaquil, forms its southern limit ; whilst to the north it ceases at the Gulf of St. Michael, and is elsewhere inclosed by the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Physical Characters. \u2014 Some lesser ranges of moun tains traverse the region, with their sides broken into steep and confined valleys. From their bases extend vast plains or llanos, covered either with forest or luxuriant grasses. These extensive llanos are repre sented in Brazil by the campos, and around Buenos Ayres by the pampas, but are here in their greatest richness. The rivers often inundate their banks, fer tilizing a soil already extremely rich, and for a time"], [843, "361 THE ORONOCO REGION. converting large districts into Savannah. A very sandy soil prevails in some places, as in the neighbourhood of Cumana, supporting chiefly multitudes of gigantic cacte\u00e6. Humboldt has observed that the vegetation here ap peared more luxuriant wherever the limestone was covered by quartzy sandstone, the latter appearing fa vourable to the retention of moisture. Climate. \u2014 Situated so near the equator, the climate is a warm one. Caraccas has an annual mean of from 70\u00b0 to 72\u00b0, which, however, is far too low for the region, perhaps as much as 8\u00b0. The range is stated to be from 51\u00b0 to 85\u00b0, being considerable for the latitude. The humidity of the atmosphere varies according to the soil and vegetation. On the Pacific, in the Bay of Choco, rain falls ten months in the year, but in the more arid parts rain is far from frequent or abundant. The climate of Guiana has been supposed to be favourable to the growth of certain spices, as cloves and nutmegs, which, from some idiosyncracy, are still produced of the best quality only in the Moluccas. Flora. \u2014 Much of the region is covered with forest, particularly in the vicinity of the oceans, between which and the interior a broad belt intervenes. In many in stances the trees are remarkable for the beauty of their wood, the fragrance of their secretions, and the rich and valuable resins they exude. In Guiana trees of this cha racter are very numerous, and belong chiefly to Laurine\u00e6. Throughout are spread a vast number of representatives of the tropical arborescent families. Gramine\u00e6 abound in the llanos, chiefly of kellingia, cenchrus, and pas palum, intermixed with species of mimosa, turnera, and malvace\u00e6. On some of the rivers a grass, cynerium saccharoides, attains a height of thirty-two feet. Where the climate is humid, piperace\u00e6, passiflore\u00e6, and me-"], [844, "362 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. lastomace\u00e6, are very numerous, overshadowed by the singular clusia and the lofty and fecund bignonia. Filices are numerous as individuals, but, together with orchidace\u00e6, do not abound in species. Some palm\u00e6 are peculiar, and of interest. Relations. \u2014 With the neighbouring regions there are naturally some strong affinities. Rhopala, a proteaceous genus, occurs ; and also a species of punica. XII.\u2014 THE ANDES REGION. Extent. \u2014 As ur alpine regions always commence at the line which separates the cultivation of the lowlands from that of the mountains, the lower boundary will be at 6,500 feet, and includes all above this to the confines of the vegetable world at 18,000 feet. It stretches to the northward along the magnificent mountain chains of New Granada, and to the south through Peru and Bolivia, where the line of lowland cultivation will descend a little. Its exact extent to the south has not been acertained. Physical Characters. \u2014 Among the stupendous scenery of the Andes and the steep and scarped precipices and mountain sides, vegetation would appear unlikely to flourish ; yet these often afford a shelter, and also assist to collect a soil in the valleys and plains. Hence, from the barrenness of a bare surface of primitive rocks, to the luxuriance of fertile and warm valleys, there is every variety of productiveness. In the plains between pa rallel ranges the soil is often deep and rich, and is equally suited to agriculture or the rearing of herds of cattle. Mountain torrents descend in fury through deep chasms,"], [845, "363 THE ANDES REGION. or sometimes assuming, for a while, tranquillity, wander in peaceful and fertilizing streams through the plains. Climate. \u2014 The atmosphere of alpine regions is liable to violent disturbance from storms, which are both rapid in their approach and disappearance, and often leave behind much devastation among the trees of the forest. The temperature of any given spot is very equable, and ranges, for the whole region, from 65\u00b0 to several degrees below the freezing point. Rain falls throughout the year in frequent showers, with little regard to the seasons, and the amount is no where great. To the decreased pressure, greater brilliancy of the sun's rays, and di minished suspended moisture, some of the peculiarities may be referred. Flora. \u2014 The least elevated portion is occupied by a magnificent forest, and valuable as containing numerous species of cinchona, which yield a medicine highly prized throughout the world, except in the neighbourhood of its production. Some tropical families ascend tenaciously to these elevations, as piperace\u00e6, melastomace\u00e6, cacte\u00e6, and passiflore\u00e6, the latter assuming the novel habit of arbo rescence ; and the numerous synanthere\u00e6 are particularly characteristic. Ficus, oreocallis, clusia, persea, and ocotea, are mingled with podocarpus, quercus, ilex, and salix. Above the forest is a large district of bushes with much variety in the species ; drymis and wintera from the south, meet ribes, rubus, and viburnum from the north, and are associated with various species of thibaudia, alnus, andro meda, fuchsia, vaccinium, calceolaria, culcitium, duranta, barnardesia, escallonia, berberis, and befaria. The flora is agreeably diversified by some h\u00e6manthus, alstr\u0153meria, sisyrinchium, and other liliaceous plants. The grasses, which, in both a botanical and economical point of view, are so important, occupy a broad space between 13,000"], [846, "364 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. and 14,500 feet, and are contributed chiefly by jurava, stipa, agrostis, panicum,avena, and dactylis. Succeeding to the grasses are many herbaceous plants, and lastly the lichens, crowning, as it were, the flora of the region. Even this very slight sketch would be incomplete with out mentioning some of the groups which flourish on the higher elevations and give an aspect of variety. A few of these are herbaceous composit\u00e6, lowly umbellifer\u00e6, saxifrage\u00e6, crucifer\u00e6, valeriane\u00e6, and caryophylle\u00e6 ; with species of gentiana, rumex, plantago, arum, oxalis, dorstenia, swertia, and lobelia. The plants attaining the greatest elevation are two lichens, umbilicaria pustulata and verrucaria geographica. Relations. \u2014 Between all alpine regions there will be numerous analogies, but few points of identity, and also a certain similarity with regions of the lowlands in a pro portionate latitude. With the Mexico alpine region are several sources of resemblance through ericace\u00e6, synan there\u00e6, crucifer\u00e6, quercus, salix, and cheirostemon plata noides. It however is deficient in the important genera of pinus, abies, and rosa. The flora is so rich and varied, that relations may easily be traced with most regions under a temperate climate. XIII. THE AMAZON REGION. Extent. \u2014 This extensive region occupies a chief part of the empire of Brazil, and comprises the richest and finest portion of South America. It consists of a magni ficent basin intersected by a multitude of rivers, many of which are of considerable size. The original streams of the largest of these, the Amazon, have their rise in the Andes, and gradually uniting their waters, traverse the region to the Atlantic ocean. Its boundaries are the"], [847, "365 THE AMAZON REGION. ridges of the mountain chains, which may be regarded as the margins of the basin, and cannot be traced with accu racy. From east to west it extends from the Atlantic to the Cordilleras, on the north it has a sinuous outline on the summits of the Sierra de Araray and the Parime chain to the bay of Guayaquil ; and on the south between the provinces of Minas Geraes and San Paulo, bending to the head waters of the Paraguay onward to the Andes in Bolivia. Physical Characters. \u2014 From the Andes, plains of almost boundless extent gradually incline towards the Atlantic. Several ranges of low mountains intersect them, but their comparative importance is trifling, and their elevation rarely exceeds 4,000, never 6,000 feet ; which is insufficient to produce any material change in the vegetation, though permitting some plants to adopt a selection. Balbi regards these plains as table lands, with an elevation from 1,030 to 1,660 feet. Granite and syenite form the bases of both the mountain chains and the lowlands, on which repose gneiss, mica slate, chlorite slate, quartz rock, and limestone. On these again are sandstone and slate clay, with alluvial deposits. True volcanic rocks have no existence. The soil varies ; in the forest it is either a rich dark vegetable mould, or a fruit ful deep red loam, and both are astonishingly productive under cultivation. In the more open country sand enters largely into the soil, and when opposed to a moist as well as warm atmosphere, displays a varied vegetation. The soil in the neighbourhood of the rivers has, from their periodical inundations, attained the greatest fertility, and gives birth to an excess of luxuriance. Climate. \u2014 The equator traverses the region, but the climate partakes of that unsteady character with regard to humidity which is so frequent, and at the same time so"], [848, "366 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. productive of variety. Para will give us the state of the climate on the plains nearest the river. The atmosphere is hot and sultry, and the range of temperature through out the year very small ; the mean is 84\", and the annual fall of rain from 80 to 100 inches. More to the south, the year is regularly distributed into the wet and dry seasons. At Rio Janeiro the rains occur from September to March, the temperature high, and often with much electrical disturbance of the atmosphere. In the interior of the country rain is less abundant, and in some places scarce. The seasons are the reverse of those in the neighbouring Oronoco regions. Flora. \u2014 In this region the American tropical families are in excess, and have the greatest number of represen tatives. The vegetation has a twofold character, com prising the forest, which extends in a broad belt along the coast from north to south, and the Sertam country, aeon traction of dezertam, where grasses and shrubs prevail, and occasionally a few trees in sheltered valleys or ravines. The forest is composed of an endless number of trees. of which to mention some would be placing others too much in the background. These trees attain a great height, with straight clear stems, their foliage uniting in a canopy above, and leaving all beneath in perfect shade and quiet. This great longitudinal developement is not favourable to a protracted existence, as age and climate soon attack the trees, and their places are left vacant for others. Of the natural families which abound in greatest intensity, and are also conspicuous for their interest, are, palm\u00e6, assuming much variety of habit, cinchonace\u00e6, melastomace\u00e6, piperace\u00e6, myrtace\u00e6, maregraaviace\u00e6, gesnerie\u00e6, sapindace\u00e6, vochyace\u00e6, guttifer\u00e6, malpighi ace\u00e6, hippocrateace\u00e6, and bromeliace\u00e6. Epiphytic plants festoon the trees in multitudes, but here orchi- 10"], [849, "367 THE AMAZON REGION. dace\u00e6 are not frequent, and their place is supplied by species of bromelia, tillandsia, the strange pothos, and many ferns. The twining plants are freely supplied by passiflore\u00e6, leguminos\u00e6, convolvulace\u00e6, aristolochi\u00e6, asclepiade\u00e6, and mikania. The Sertam country has its own vegetable charms, and though much occupied by grasses with a dull grey hairy surface, has large spaces covered with bushwood, and sometimes even trees. Many of these are attractive, and chiefly belong to cinchonace\u00e6, composit\u00e6, apocyne\u00e6, malpighiace\u00e6, and euphorbiace\u00e6. A few of the more numerous genera are declieuxia, rhexia, banisteria, gaudi chaudia, croton, wedelia, kleinia, and sauvagesia. The trees are described by Von Martius as attaining only fifteen or twenty feet in height, and growing as a light open grove. The chief are derived from laplacia, gom phia, marcgraafia, vochysia, qualia, solanum, byrsonima, erythroxylon, panax, and rhexia ; and amaryllide\u00e6 are frequent. \u201e Some peculiarities may be noticed on the sides and summits of the different mountain chains. On Itacolumi, or the Child of Stone, a mountain near Villa Rica, attain ing 5,710, Von Martius saw the curious arborescent lilies of barbacennia bicolor, b. tricolor, b. tomentosa, b. luzul\u00e6solia, b. ensifolia, vellosia abietina, and v. taxifolia. Other characterizing genera are galium, mo rinda, declieuxia, oxypetalum, ditassa, lisianthus, exagum, phyllanthus, lavradia, gloxinia, gesneria, vitis, and terns troemia. Growing on the ironstone floetz formation, and supposed to be distinctive of it, were, laurus erythropus, bauhinia ferruginosa, abatia tomentosa, brysonima niti dissima, banisteria versicolor, vanillosma firmum, lisi anthus pulcherrimus, phyllanthus robustus, and mikania glauca. The swampy ground is distinguished by species"], [850, "368 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. of hydrocotyle, drosera, andromeda, gaulthcria, utricu laria, sauvagesia, and eriocaulon. Relations. \u2014 Among the alpine plants, if so they can be called, are many intimately connected with the ve getation of the temperate regious of Europe and North America, as panax, clethra, vitis, galium, and gaultheria. Ambrosia artemesi\u00e6folia, a strand plant of the Iroquois Region, occurs on the shores of Paraiba. Walsh saw patches of the European fern, aspidium filix mas, and also bushes of Rubus occidentalis. The same traveller mentions \"avena sterilis attaining a height of ten feet. For some time the existence of canna indica was sup posed to confer an interesting point of identity with India, but it is now known to be a frequent plant within the tropics. XIV.\u2014 THE PARAGUAY REGION. Extent. \u2014 It embraces the space of country traversed by the Paraguay River and its tributary streams ; its outline will thus extend from the coast between the Brazilian provinces of San Paulo and Minas Garaes, and, arching to the north, terminate on the limits of the Pampas Region, and again on the south along the course of the Rio Plata, and the hitherto unascertained margin of the same region. Physical Characters. \u2014 A portion of this country is not so completely a plain as would appear from the maps, as towards the Andes several spurs are sent off which spread into the interior. San Paulo is sufficiently elevated to affect considerably its productions, and the difference between it and Minas Geraes has struck several travellers. Generally the soil is rich and fertile,"], [851, "THE PARAGUAY REGION. 369 but there are large spaces covered with scarcely any thing but sand, aud yielding a poor bushy vegetation. Climate. \u2014 That of San Paulo corresponds to the whole region; the mean temperature of the year is 73\u00b0, and the range is small. Hoar frost is sometimes seen, but snow is unknown. The rains occur at two periods, the autumnal being the heaviest. Flora. \u2014 The tropical features, which the Amazon Region possesses in such intensity, have greatly dimi nished ; palm\u00e6 are few ; ferns continue very numerous, but with a habit more suited to a drier climate. Bac-* charis and other composit\u00e6 cover the sandy districts, and cacte\u00e6 are frequent. Umbellifer\u00e6, though far from numerous, have a greater preponderance than in neigh bouring regions. The forest is open, and composed of fine trees ; arborescent ferns still continue, and where they assemble in groves exclude all other vegetation, a peculiarity possessed by them when growing gregariously. In a collection of plants made in the warmer portion of the region, composit\u00e6 were a Pith, leguminos\u00e6 a 15th, cinchonace\u00e6 and orchide\u00e6 a 20th, melastomace\u00e6 a 29th, labiat\u00e6 and solane\u00e6 a 40tb. Tristan da Cunha, situated in 37\u00b0 S. lat., is known to possess 113 indigenous plants, among which are several umbellifer\u00e6, which induces us to regard the island as a fragment of this region. Relations. \u2014 These are perhaps feeble with distant regions, whilst they are not strong with those in the vicinity. Araucaria brasiliensis is frequent in the forest, a representative of an Australian genus, though having a nearly allied species in Chili. VOL. II. B B"], [852, "370 THE REGIONS OF VEQETATION. XV.\u2014 THE CHILI AND PERU REGION. Extent. \u2014 A peculiar and well-defined region, but still far from productive. It includes a narrow strip between the Cordilleras and the Pacific Ocean from Cape Blanco in 4\u00b0 S. lat. to the oblique line stretching from 36\u00b0 S. lat. on the coast of Chili to Port St. Antonio on the opposite side. Both limits are well marked ; at the northern the forest of the adjacent region commences suddenly, and at the southern, around Conception, rapidly appear those numerous genera, which establish so strong a relation between the Patagonia Region and the tem perate latitudes of the northern hemisphere. Some doubts may arise whether the Andes of its southern part should not be included, and I am disposed to think they ought, but at present it is impossible to trace the exact relations. The two islands of Juan Fernandez also belong here. Physical Characters. \u2014 The flank of the Cordilleras regarding the Pacific is composed chiefly of porphyritic rocks, but the somewhat inclined plane which slopes towards the ocean is formed by deposits of clay, both tertiary and recent, very frequently inclosing shells, and resting on a substratum of brown sandstone. The surface may be divided into the valleys and the intervening ridges ; the former containing some soil, and a supply of water near which is assembled the entire vegetation, whilst the spaces between are usually quite bare, or only support some straggling brushwood. The soil in the exposed places contains a large proportion of salt, both of nitrate of potash and chloride of sodium, which lies in a thin stratum one or two inches beneath the surface and can be easily removed in solid thin cakes. This"], [853, "371 THE CHILI AND PERU REGION. admixture renders the soil very puffy, and after being moistened by the heavy dews it forms a thin brittle crust. It also deprives it of the customary cohesion, and wherever the soil has collected, as on the sides of the hills and valleys, the foot readily sinks six or eight inches. Climate. \u2014 Though much is within the tropics, it has few corresponding features. The temperature of the intertropical part is warm during the dry season, but is unusually cold and chilly at the opposite period ; it has thus a great range. Rain is a novelty almost through out, and instead there are dense falling mists, called garuas, from May to August, which render the weather particularly unpleasant. In the northern part these cease with great suddenness, for in the Bay of Guayaquil the rains are very heavy, and at Tumbez, within half a degree, a shower is not seen for years together. To the south the two are gradually shaded off into each other, and at Valparaiso the rainy season is short and less regular, whilst at times there is something like the garuas. The absence of regular rain has been attributed to the south wind, which blows with much constancy ; and it has been observed that during the season of mists a light breeze from the opposite quarter is not unfre quent. At Valparaiso the temperature is more in ac cordance with its geographical position ; it is situated in 33\u00b0 S. lat., and during June and July, the two most unfavourable months, the range was from 46\u00b0 to 64\u00b0 the dews extremely heavy, but rain fell latterly. Flora. \u2014 Nothing that can be called forest exists, a few trees only being scattered sparingly about, and though much is within the tropic, corresponding characters are not strong. Cocos chilensis has a few individuals scat tered about the valleys in the neighbourhood of Val- B B 2"], [854, "372 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. paraiso, and the potato may be seen here growing wild on some of the hills ; a species of bambusa is not un- common, and a salix is frequent in the valleys. The chief tree is cordia decandra, but many spots are not deficient in cultivated fruit trees. The plants recalling tropical features aie azara serrata, krameria cistoidea, coriaria ruscifolia, cassia sp., mimosa cavenia, loasa aceri- folia, amirola glandulosa, and croton lanceolatus. Cereus, opuntia, euphorbia, lobelia, calceolaria, and oxalis, are common. About Valparaiso are low thickets of shrubby composit\u00e6 ; and amaryllide\u00e6 and iride\u00e6 are numerous. On waste ground near Lima trop\u00e6olum majus abounds, with sida. datura, cestrum, alternanthera, \u0153nothera, asclepias, and calceolaria. In a few favoured valleys the ground is quite yellow with the multitudes of flowers of pancratium amencaes, whose expanding flowers are the signal for the commencement of the revels bearing its name. Relations. \u2014 The most interesting will be with the California Region, with which there is much similarity in climate, and some in productions through ageratum, mimulus, castilleja, rhus, ribes, berberis, and laurus. The prevalence of bulbous plants in Chili confers some resemblance with the South Africa Region. XVI.\u2014 THE PAMPAS REGION. Extent. \u2014 That portion of South America between the Andes and the mouth of the Rio Plata is composed en tirely of this peculiar district. To the north it extends to the neighbourhood of the towns of the interior, and ap proaches the river Paraguay ; its exact outline is here imperfectly known. To the south it terminates in an"], [855, "373 THE PAMPAS REGION. oblique line, extending from the Port of San Antonio to 36\u00b0 S. latitude on the west coast. Physical Characters. \u2014 A vast plain stretches on all sides, very slightly raised above the level of the sea, and only diversified in a few places by low hills. Some un important rivers have their origin, and are often again lost in the soil. Reddish marl is mentioned as occurring, but is not perhaps general. To the south the soil is impregnated with saline matter. Climate. \u2014 The seasons are temperate, and their alter nations produce a rapid change in the vegetation. Flora. \u2014 The remarks of Sir Francis Head on the features are appropriate. \" The great plain of Pampas of the Cordillera is about 900 miles broad, and the part which I have visited, though in the same latitude, is divided into regions of different climate and produce. On leaving Buenos Ayres, the first of these regions is covered, for 180 miles with clover and thistles ; the second, which extends for 430 miles, produces long grass ; and the third region, which reaches the base of the Cordillera, is a grove of low trees and shrubs. The second and third of these regions have nearly the same appearance throughout the year ; for the trees and shrubs are evergreens ; and the immense plain of grass only changes its colour from green to brown ; but the first region varies with the four sea sons of the year, in a most extraordinary manner. In winter, the leaves of the thistles are large and luxuriant, and the whole appearance of the country has the rough appearance of a turnip field. The clover, at this season, is extremely rich and strong ; and the sight of the wild cattle, grazing at full liberty in such pasture, is beautiful. In spring, the clover has vanished, the foliage of the thistle has extended across the ground, and the country still looks as if covered with a rough crop of turnips. In"], [856, "374 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. less than a month the change is most extraordinary ; the whole region becomes luxuriant with enormous thistles, which have suddenly shot up to a height often or eleven feet, and are in full bloom. # * # The summer is not over before the scene undergoes another change ; the thistles suddenly loose their sap and verdure ; their heads droop, the leaves shrink and fade, the stems become black and dead, and they remain rattling with the breeze one against another, until the violence of the pampero or hurricane levels them with the ground, where they rapidly decompose and disappear; the clover rushes up, and the scene is again verdant.\" Ranunculace\u00e6, caryo phylle\u00e6, and crucifer\u00e6, make their appearance, and the low bushes are most probably chiefly composit\u00e6. Species of lathyrus, polygala, anemone, oxalis, lobelia, galium, plantago, and teucrium, are also frequent. Relations. \u2014 There is a strong connexion with some of the European Regions through numerous genera, and some slight alliance with the South Africa Region. It is curious that an exotic thistle, cynara cardunculus, should have taken such entire possession of a large district, as to have obliterated nearly the whole of the spontaneous vegetation. Its luxuriance is so great, that the question arises, whether plants can ever find a situation more favourable to their existence than that in which nature has placed them ? The excessive developement also of psidium pomiferum, at Tahiti, would seem to require an affirmative. In general character there is some similarity with the Prairie Region, but the minuter features are different, and the latter is less fertile."], [857, "375 THE PATAGONIA REGION. XVIL\u2014 THE PATAGONIA REGION. Extent. \u2014 In the vicinity of Conception, a change takes place in the character of the vegetation, and in the climate ; trees commence, and heavy rains are exchanged for the peculiar climate of Chili and Peru. An imagi nary line, commencing on the west coast, in 36\u00b0 S. lati tude, and extending obliquely to Port San Antonio, on the opposite side, separates the southern extremity of the continent, and with the adjacent islands constitutes the region. Physical Characters. \u2014 The Andes have now lost their stupendous size, and are continued as an inferior mountain range, of an average elevation of 3,000 feet, rarely or never attaining 6,000 feet, and their appearance is wild, bleak, and desolate. Primitive rocks abound, and granite greatly prevails ; towards the Straits of Magellan are various hornblendes and slates, and the latter appear favourable to vegetation, for fagus antarc tica attains on it a great size, whilst a reddish sandstone is barren. Climate. \u2014 Moist and unfriendly for the latitude ; the number of rainy days is very great, and a thoroughly fine one is rather a novelty. Though the temperature is not in extremes, still the summer months are chilly. For the month of May, in the vicinity of Cape Horn, the mean temperature was 40\u00b0, the range from 30 to 48\", and very equable through the day and night ; the fall of rain eight inches ; dew-point 2\u00b0 or 3\u00b0 below the atmo sphere, the greatest being 7\u00b0 or 8\u00b0; hail frequent, with the temperature from 42\u00b0 to 48\u00b0. About Conception the climate is more agreeable, the temperature warmer, and the rain falls at regular seasons."], [858, "376 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. Flora. \u2014 Irregular groups of wood cover the surface, wherever the climate is moderate, and there is a mitiga tion of its general austerity. The chief trees are as sembled about Conception, and somewhat to the south is the principal station of auraucaria imbricata. Among these are fagus obliqua, laurus lingui, laurelia aromatica, drymis chilensis, quadria heterophylla. At Tierra del Fucgo and Staten Land, fagus antarctica, an evergreen species, is frequent, and, assisted by others of a similar habit, gives a peculiar character to the scenery. Forster, the companion of Cook, has described with some quaint ness the general features. \" In the cavities and cre vices of the huge piles of rocks, forming Tierra del Fuego and Staten Land, so very like each other, where a little moisture is preserved by its situation, and where; from the continued friction of the loose pieces of rocks, washed and hurried down the steep sides of the rocky masses, a few minute particles form a kind of sand; there, in the stagnant water, gradually spring up a few algaceous plants from seeds carried thither on the feet, plumage, and bills of birds ; these plants form at the end of each season a few atoms of mould which yearly increases ; the birds, the sea, or the wind carries from a neighbouring isle, the seeds of some of the mossy plants to this little mould, and they vegetate in it during the proper sea sons. Though these plants are not absolute mosses, they are, however, nearly related to them in their habit. We reckon among them the ixia pumila, a new plant which we call donatia, a small melanthium, a minute oxalis and calendula, another little dioicous plant, called by us phyl lachne, together with the mniarum. These plants, or the greater part of them, have a peculiar growth, parti cularly adapted to these regions, and fit for forming soil and mould on barren rocks. In proportion as they grow"], [859, "377 THE PATAGONIA REGION. up, they spread into various stems and branches, which lie as closely together as possible; they spread new seeds, and at last a large spot is covered ; the lowermost fibres, roots, stalks, and leaves, gradually decay and push forth on the top new verdant leaves ; the decaying lower parts form a kind of peat or turf, which gradually changes into mould and soil. The close texture of these plants hinders the moisture below from evaporating, and thus furnishes nutriment to the vegetation above, and clothes at last whole hills and isles with a constant ver dure. Among the pumilous plants some of a greater stature begin to thrive, without in the least prejudicing the growth of these creators of mould and soil. Among these plants we reckon a small arbutus, a diminutive myrtle, a little dandelion, a small creeping crassula, the common pinguicula alpina, a yellow variety of viola palustris, statice armeria or sea-pink, a kind of burnet, the ranunculus lapponicus, the holcus odoratus, the com mon celery, (apium australe,) with the arabis hetero phylla. Soon after we observed, in places which are still covered with the above-mentioned, a new rush, (juncus triglumis,) a fine amellus, a most beautiful scarlet che lone, (C. ruelloides,) and lastly even shrubby plants, viz. a scarlet-flowered shrubby plant of a new genus, which we called embothrium coccineum, two new kinds of ber berry, (berberis ilicifolia, b. mitior,) an arbutus with cuspidate leaves, (A. mucronata,) and lastly the tree bearing the winter's bark, (drymis winteri,) which, how ever, in these rocky barren parts of Tierra del Fuego never exceeds the size of a tolerable shrub ; whereas in Success Bay, on a gentle sloping ground, in a rich and deep soil, it grows to the size of the largest timber.\" Many of Forster's new names have now become as fa-"], [860, "378 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. miliar as household words to the botanist. Mosses and lichens abound here, but ferns are scarce. The flora of the Falkland Islands is scanty, being composed chiefly of a few composit\u00e6, gramine\u00e6, lichens, and musci. Bolax glebaria is found here, and veronica decussata as a shrub six feet high, but not fit for fire wood, the deficiency of which is met by peat, which, Weddel says, is abundant. The South Shetlands have only some straggling grass and a lichen. Relations. \u2014 The relations are stronger with the tem perate regions of the northern hemisphere than with those in its vicinity. With the former it has a number of genera in common, as, omitting those already men tioned, betula, ribes, rubus, andromeda, vaccinium, auri cula, cardainine, draba, lepidium, stellaria, hydrocotyle, anemone, drosera, galium, tussilago, salix, carex, cy perus, and usnea. With adjoining regions, fuchsia, myrtus, drymis, baccharis, escallonia, calceolaria, and chelone. With the South Africa Region, nothwithstand ing a considerable difference in the climate, gladiolus, ixia, wistenia, galaxia, and crassula. And with New Holland, araucaria, embothrium, ourisia, and mniarum. Its own peculiarities are due to the novelty of nearly the whole of the species, and to the genera gaimardia, astelia, callixene, philesia, drapetes, b\u00e6a, pernettia, oligosporus, nassavia, bolax, azorella, donatia, ac\u00e6na, hamadryas, and the curious misodendrum. A relation of identity with European regions is established through pinguicula al pina, viola palustris, statice armeria, dactylis glomerata, and several mosses and lichens."], [861, "379 THE POLYNESIA REGION. XVIII.-THE POLYNESIA REGION. Extent. \u2014 The various groups of islands composing this region have no great superficies, but possess many features of peculiarity and interest. The region by no means includes all the group of the Pacific Ocean, but only those which are more particularly designated as Polynesia. It comprises the Sandwich Islands, the Society Islands, the Marquesas Islands, the Gambier Islands, the Harvey Islands, the low coral islands of the Dangerous or Pomoutou group, and the Radack and Ralick chains, with a few solitary detached, but unim portant islands. Physical Characters. \u2014 There are perhaps few spots where such an assemblage of agreeable external circum stances is met with, and where the visitor is assailed by so many favourable impressions. The climate is warm without being oppressive, the scenery partakes of all that variety nature can so well assume, where mountain, valley, and plain exist, and have each their charms ; and where the vegetation is varied and agreeable, with out being in excess. The islands may be regarded as so many mountains of basalt and lava, split by numerous valleys, and with their bases often dilated into plains, stretching with various inclinations to the cliffs or coral reefs of the shores. The valleys are usually very steep, and contain the chief and richest soil, for the mountains often display precipices with the smoothness and regu larity of artificial walls. Elsewhere are numerous pro jecting masses of rocks, rendering certain parts entirely unfit for cultivation. Among the denser vegetation the soil is black from the mixture of organic matter, but on the plains it is frequently of a deep-red colour, and may be used as a coarse paint. This owes much of its exist-"], [862, "380 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. ence to the decomposition of the lava rock, and is very productive when supplied with abundance of water. The coral islands must be excepted from the above, as they have a low flat circular surface, with small patches of vegetable mould. Climate. \u2014 Within the influence of the trade-winds, and ever fanned by their breezes, the temperature of the region is not high for the latitude. It is something greater at the Society Islands to the south of the equator, than at the Sandwich Islands to the north. At Ho nolulu, Sandwich Islands, Mr. Rooke's Observations for 1838, give the mean temperature as 77\u00b0 3, fall of rain 21*1 inches, fine days 285, rainy 37, variable 43. Similar observations at the Society Islands are wanting. The quantity of rain in different places varies greatly ; and in the interior, near the highest land, the amount will be three or four times more than the above ; and places to windward will have less than others to leeward. From some observations, I am disposed to fix 193 feet of ascent as equal to one degree of the thermometer. The seasons at the two sides of the equator will be at different periods, and rains occur a little after the summer solstice. At the Marquesas I found some relative temperatures to be, under the shade of vegetation 86\u00b0 5, the soil 80\u00b0, the sun's rays partially obscured, 103\u00b0. Flora. \u2014 The vegetation is not rich but interesting ; indeed it may be called a poor flora. Forest cannot be said to exist ; and the trees crowd up the valleys and less perpendicular ascents, with more the character of groves. Irregular patches of these diversify the aspect of the country, the intervals being filled with smaller vegeta tion. Drac\u00e6na terminalis spreads over the valleys ; and the troublesome grass, centrotheca lappacea, covers every dry spot on the ridges and sides of the hills, and even of"], [863, "381 THE POLYNESIA REGION. the plains. The trees are not large but numerous, and want the great height attained in the genuine forest. The vegetation is otherwise peculiar, from its small and inconspicuous flowers, being deficient in size and richness of colour, the absence of fragrant properties to a great extent, and the leaves being mostly small, undivided, and of a dull shade of colour. I- have thought that there were proofs here of plants degenerating towards the margins of the extent of their indigenous existence. Artocarpus incisa, broussonetia papyrifera, and aleurites triloba, grow nearly everywhere spontaneously. At the Society Islands they thrive vigo rously, as large trees ; but on advancing eastward they gradually diminish in size and vigour till, in the Gambier group, they are hardly of any use to the natives ; and in Easter Island, where the two latter are found, they are low and useless hushes. The same circumstance may be noticed with the shells, cardium cardissa, terebra macu lata, conus betulinus, purpura persica, and perhaps others. The Sandwich Islands have a superficies of 6,600 square miles. The prevailing families are, Alices, very nume rous ; a large proportion of composit\u00e6, cinchonace\u00e6, leguminos\u00e6, malvace\u00e6, cyrtandrace\u00e6, labiat\u00e6, urtice\u00e6, euphorbiace\u00e6, piperace\u00e6, and gramine\u00e6. The vegetation is more closely distinguished by several araliace\u00e6, goode novi\u00e6, lobeliace\u00e6, arnarantace\u00e6, and pandane\u00e6 ; whilst the presence of crucifer\u00e6, saxifrage\u00e6, and umbellifer\u00e6, invests it with further peculiarities. Till recently no palm beyond the cocoa-nut was supposed to exist, but a species of cham\u00e6rops has been discovered. Orchidace\u00e6 have no existence. The peculiar genera are few, kadua, charpen tiera, dubautia, and a few others. In Hawaii, Mouna Roa reaches 15,980 feet, and Mouna Koa 13,500 feet, and"], [864, "382 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. have a vegetation with alpine features. Vacciniuin, rubus, and fragaria are found here ; and when the flora shall be better known, a small alpine region will most probably become necessary. The Society Islands. These islands have a niucli smaller superficies, and a flora of only 500 species. They contain nearly the whole of the different species of the region south of the equator ; and there are very few not found at Tahiti, the largest of the group. The prevailing families of the Sandwich Islands exist equally here, the chief peculiarities depending on the presence of several crucifer\u00e6, on the comparative abundance of cinchonace\u00e6, euphorbiace\u00e6, and urtice\u00e6, the scarcity of leguminos\u00e6, and through celtis discolor in possessing ulmace\u00e6. The Marquesas yield nothing in natural beauty to the other islands, and have a flora hitherto very sparingly examined, but apparently identical with that of the Society Islands, though even less abundant. The self introduced plants which fringe the shores are different from those of the same class at the Sandwich Islands, and evidently come from that part of the coast of America nearest at hand. Some species monopolize a large sur face. Hibiscus tiliaceus runs far into the valleys, to the exclusion of everything else ; desmodium purpureum occupies the waste ground near the sea ; and centrotheca lappacea spreads higher upon the hills. The bread-fruit and cocoa-nut compose large groves. Tke Harvey Islands have a vegetation identical with the Society Islands. Rarotonga has the reputation of being the most picturesque island of the Pacific. It is very productive ; and the paramount object of the resi dents at present is to exclude the guava-bush, which at Tahiti has spread so widely, obliterated the grass, and much other of the vegetation."], [865, "THE POLYNESIA REGION. 383 The Gambier Islands are volcanic islands set in coral reefs. The flora is the same as at the Society Islands. Metrosideros obovata has hitherto only been met with here. The Pomoutou Islands. These irregular coral islands are upwards of fifty in number. Their surface is com posed of ragged fragments of dead coral, with a little vegetable mould in places ; and sometimes water is found a few inches beneath the surface. The flora is extremely limited, and, it must be inferred, in no respect original ; yet there are one or two plants at present not known to exist elsewhere. A collection of plants made by myself, with a few additions from other sources, gives a total amount of 47 species, which are referable to 40 genera, and 27 families. Lepidium piscidium disregards the heat, and appears wherever there is a little soil, and the parasitic cassythis filiformis mats together the bushes. The JRadack and Ralich Chains, though closely resem bling the latter, are more productive, and cultivation is practised. Chamisso mentions 52 species, many of which are indigenous at the Sandwich Islands and Guahon. He also observes that the southern islands have a richer soil and older vegetation. Relations. \u2014 The existence of this region, as a whole, is very clearly defined ; the connexions with the nearest regions not being very intimate. Its relations are spread far and wide. In the Sandwich Islands there are affi nities with New Holland through metrosideros, myopo rum, exocarpus, cyathodes, and an aphyllous acacia ; with Europe are several jungermannia, and musci in common; besides, with North America and Asia, several identical species. In the Society Islands the affinities are strong est with New Holland through metrosideros, myoporum, casuarina, and dodon\u00e6a ; but they have no representative 5"], [866, "384 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. of epacride\u00e6, as at the Sandwich Islands. From these latter they are further distinguished by the presence of ficus and several orchidace\u00e6. With South America and Asia there are some relations, but they are not striking. Rhizophora has no existence. XIX. THE PAPUA OR NEW GUINEA REGION. Extent. \u2014 Several large and important islands, of which New Guinea is by far the most extensive, lying between the equator and 23\u00b0 south latitude. Commenc ing at the western extremity, the region includes the Moluccas, Papua or New Guinea, the former designa tion being the most in use in the surrounding seas, the Admiralty Islands, New Britain, and New Ireland, the Solomon Islands, New Hebrides, New Caledonia, the Feejee Islands, Tonga archipelago, and Navigator's Is lands. Physical Characters. \u2014 The scenery is bold and rugged, particularly about the Solomon group, and many of the islands are nothing but mountains. The forest, which abounds everywhere, rests on rocky declivities, with very little soil. In Papua and the Feejee Islands, there are extensive level surfaces of rich soil, apparently the deposit of rivers. There are several active volca nos, and much of the structure is in every probability volcanic. Conglomerate, limestone, and stratified sand stone occur in Papua. The islands of the Tonga group are curious flat tables of limestone, forty feet and up wards above the level of the sea, and with deep water close to their wall-like cliffs. The elevation of the mountains of Papua is undoubtedly not so great as has been supposed, and along the whole extent of its northern"], [867, "PAPUA OR NEW GUINEA REGION. 385 shore none are visible which at all approach the limit of perpetual snows. Climate. \u2014 Heat and moisture prevail, and render the climate a warm, and from the productions, it is likely, a peculiar one. An anomaly exists in the distribu tion of the seasons. It is customary for the south-east monsoon to bring the dry season to the space over which it blows from May to October inclusive. The north west monsoon prevails for the remaining months of the year and accompanies the rains. The reverse happens over the extent of this region, for though the monsoons o ' ***> are not so powerfully felt at its eastern extremity, the cli mate is everywhere the same. In the south-east mon soon the rains are heavy and frequent, and the deposition must be very considerable. Flora. \u2014 Approaching this region from the eastward, the character of the flora as distinct from the Polynesian is very evident; palm\u00e6 become more numerous through cham\u00e6rops, caryota, and areca ; pandanus has many spe cies ; leguminos\u00e6, though more abundant than in the Polynesia Region, and composit\u00e6 are not frequent, a proof of the usually moist state of the atmosphere ; cycas first appears at New Ireland, and rhizophora in the rivers of the Feejees. However, it is a flora, with the exception of the Moluccas, almost unknown. Papua or New Guinea. \u2014 Forest covers everywhere this large and fine, but unhealthy, island, and presents a variety which perhaps makes it the most prolific of vegetable forms in the world. The vegetation is ex tremely varied, and the species appear to have a limited range. Here, as elsewhere, it is chiefly on the margins of the sorest, that flowers and herbaceous plants are seen. The colours are generally little attractive, and white greatly prevails. This is partly compensated by VOL. II. C C"], [868, "386 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. the frequent fragrance of the flowers, and sometimes even of the foliage. Leguminos\u00e6, solane\u00e6, and umbellifer\u00e6, are uncommon. Trees of achras and myristica are numerous in the forest, and there are several species of each. The nutmegs are without the aroma found in myristica moschata. This genus extends as far to the east as the Feejee Islands. Ferns of every variety of habit are most numerous, and orchidace\u00e6 abound. The Moluccas have a less compact forest, as open spaces of bushes often occur, but a great variety in its trees. They are remarkable, as the native country of the clove and nutmeg of commerce, and of other aroma tic productions. Relations. \u2014 When the southern shores of New Guinea are better known, there will most probably be discovered many sources of resemblance with New Hol land. At present the most prominent are, casuarina, common throughout the region, melaleuca and eucalyp tus in the Moluccas, and acacia laurifolia, an aphyllous species, in the eastern groups. A passiflora is common in the Feejee and Navigators' Islands. Agathis appears in the Moluccas, as well as in New Zealand, and the resin is largely used, under the name of dammar, to give light. XX \u2014THE AUSTRALIA TROPIC REGION. Extent. \u2014 The space between the northern shores of New Holland and the limit of the tropic in 23u28' south latitude. The genuine characters of this region are lost, even within this limit, towards the west coast, where at Point Leveque in 123\u00b0 east longitude, it meets the west Australian region."], [869, "387 AUSTRALIA TROPIC REGION. Physical Characters. \u2014 Little is known respecting it, the coast only having received a partial examination. The shores are generally low and sandy, often barren, but sometimes clothed with a rich and luxuriant vegeta tion. Climate. \u2014 Tropical in temperature, but deficient in the usual amount of suspended moisture. Flora. \u2014 The thin forest of New Holland prevails, but partakes more of the usual tropical characters, and in some places is so dense and vigorous as to be almost impenetrable. In the vicinity of Van Diemen's Gulf spe cies of eucalyptus, corypha, pandanus, acacia, and croton, form a thick vegetation. The shores are closely beset by rhizophora, brugiera, and carallia, all genera of rhizo phore\u00e6. Palm\u00e6 are not numerous, and are represented by corypha, seaforthia, livingstonia, and calamus. Le guminos\u00e6, as might be expected in such a climate, are very abundant ; also euphorbiace\u00e6 through croton and phyllanthus ; and conifer\u00e6 are present in podocarpus, callitris, and araucaria. A. excelsa is not here a large tree, but occasionally covers much space. Cinchonace\u00e6 do not abound, and such as exist have Indian relations. Bignoniace\u00e6 have a few species. Cryptogamic plants, epiphytic orchidace\u00e6, and others with similar habits, and depending less on their roots for food than on the at mosphere, are all infrequent. Loranthus, embracing as it does genuine parisites, is frequent on all the coasts of New Holland. Those plants so entirely characteristic of this continent, and which are developed so profusely in the metropolis of their existence, are still spread among the vegetation, but in reduced numbers. Proteace\u00e6 are nearly limited to grevillea, hakea, and persoonia ; the Australian myr tace\u00e6 are few ; diosme\u00e6 has only eriostemon and phe- C C 2"], [870, "388 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. balium ; eucalyptus has few species and individuals, and diminished vigour ; casuarina is gradually disappearing. Relations. \u2014 Mr. Allan Cunningham has had the best opportunities of examining the vegetation. In an ex pedition directed to this part of the coast he collected 1500 species of phenogamous plants, of which 520 had been previously described. In a comparison between the east and north-west coasts in the parallel of 15\u00b0, and with an intervening space of 1,800 miles, he sound only forty-eight species in common. He also gives a list of fifty-two Indian and South American plants, which are indigenous to Australia. (King's voyages, Appendix.) Umbellifer\u00e6 have a few species, and there are some close relations with the flora of New Guinea and the Malay Islands. Among others, myristica is not uncommon on the northern and north-western coast. XXI.\u2014 THE NEW SOUTH WALES REGION. Extent. \u2014 The British colony of New South Wales occupies a large portion of the east coast of New Holland. Our region is, however, more rigorously defined, and will comprise the east portion of the continent south of the tropic, and ceases to the west and south somewhere in the neighbourhood of the mouth of the Morumbridgee. Physical Characters. \u2014 The whole continent has been divided into two parts, the region of terraces, and the region of plains, separated by the 148th meridian. Captain Sturt observes, that of the ridges which divide the latter, each presents a different rock formation, and also that he has noticed that the botanical and geological features are intimately connected. The Blue Mountains"], [871, "389 NEW SOUTH WALES REGION. attain no considerable elevation, scarcely exceeding 3,000 feet, and form a wild and sterile barrier between two portions of the country. The soil varies, much is ex tremely arid, and some is productive on slight cultivation. It is probably a variety which will soon wear out, and large tracts are required for grazing purposes. The kind of trees growing are regarded as a good indication of the quality of the soil ; the native apple (Angophora lanceo lata) selecting a good soil, and the spotted gum and stringy bark a bad. Rhagodia, salsola, and similar plants, are met with in places, and indicate a saline soil. After the wet season, ephemeral rivers traverse the country, and lose themselves either in sandy plains or chains of marshy ponds. At other seasons much of the surface is indifferently watered. Climate. \u2014 There is a great disposition to excess both in temperature and in dryness. The range of the ther mometer is sometimes very great and sudden, being in the summer months from 36\u00b0 to 106\u00b0, the mean 70\u00b0; and in the winter months from 27\u00b0 to 98\u00b0, the mean 66.\u00b0 At Sidney the number of rainy days is 107. There is evi dently a strong adaptation of the vegetation to the climate and other physical agents. Flora. \u2014 It has been observed by many, that in the Australian vegetation there is a sombre dulness which en tirely excludes any of those lively and agreeable impres sions it elsewhere so frequently creates. The forest, where it abounds, is not close aud compact, but so open as to offer no obstruction to the passenger, and intervals are frequently occupied by dry stunted bushes, or straggling crass. Mr. P. Cunningham remarks that the trees are nearly all evergreens, with fewer branches, and compara tively fewer leaves than European trees. Many shed their bark, and whilst the new has the appearance of a dead"], [872, "390 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. tree pealed, the old bark is hanging in loose shreds and flakes, giving the whole much the character of an assem blage of dead trees. Dr. R. Brown attributes the mono tonous aspect and w ant of lustre in the vegetation to the equal existence of the cutaneous glands, or stomata, on both surfaces of the leaf. Nor when vegetation has ceased does the decay of the decomposing parts impart the usual fertility, for Captain Sturt conceives that the decaying leaves and timber, instead of adding richness to the soil, actually preclude minor vegetation, and that plants seem to shun the spot where a tree has fallen aud gone to decay. In a climate so arid, the seasons will assert a powerful influence over the vegetation, and as soon as the beneficial effects of the rains are felt, there is much gaiety and liveliness in the numerous curious and handsome flowers ; but on their disappearance the vegeta tion soon becomes parched and uninteresting. The wood of the trees possesses to an important extent the pro perty of incombustibility, which is supposed to be due to the presence of aluminous earth. Thebotanist must take a closer inspection, andhere finds a novelty and pleasure the more general observer is de prived of. The various species of eucalyptus, nearly a hundred in number, compose the chief bulk of the forest ; it has been estimated at four-fifihs. They are frequently trees of enormous dimensions, except within the tropics, where they are also fewer. Exocarpus cupressiformis is the commonest tree of New Holland, without the tropics. Casuarina has many species, which have the local name of oaks. Leguminos\u00e6 are very abundant, the decandrous papilionaceous kinds prevail, as pulten\u00e6a, gompholobium, and dillwynia ; and the aphyllous species of acacia are almost peculiar. Composit\u00e6 are liberally represented by the tribe corymbifer\u00e6, but very sparingly by the two"], [873, "391 NEW SOUTH WALES REGION. others. Orchidace\u00e6 are very numerous as species, but not as individuals, always growing sparingly, and sometimes are extremely rare ; those which are epiphytic cease at 34\" S. latitude, and are more abundant in this region than the tropical. Palm\u00e6 extend to the same limit. Protea ce\u00e6, myrtace\u00e6, and epacride\u00e6, abound in great numbers in peculiar genera, and intermingled with diosme\u00e6, goodenovi\u00e6, myoporine\u00e6, stylide\u00e6, restiace\u00e6, treman dre\u00e6, polygale\u00e6, and dilleniace\u00e6, impress very distinc tive peculiarities. Cryptogamic plants are not so abun dant as usual, owing to the dryness of the climate, the absence of large trees in many situations, and the deci duous bark. A tree-fern, dicksonia antarctica, extends through the region, even into Van Diemen's Land. Relations. \u2014 It is not a little singular, that identical species of European plants appear here in greater numbers than in South Africa, or other intervening regions. Dr. Brown's experience renders his observations valuable. \" In comparing very generally the flora of the principal parallel, (between 33\u00b0 and 35\" S. latitude) of Terra Aus tralis, with that of South Africa, we find several natural families characteristic of the Australian vegetation, as proteace\u00e6, diosme\u00e6, restiace\u00e6, polygale\u00e6, and also butteneriace\u00e6, if hermannia and mahernia be considered as part of this order, existing, and in nearly equal abun dance, at the Cape of Good Hope ; others are replaced by analogous families, as epacride\u00e6 by erice\u00e6 ; and some tribes, which form a considerable part of the Australian peculiarities, as dilleniace\u00e6, the leafless acaci\u00e6, and eucalyptus, are _entirely wanting in South Africa. On the other hand, several of the characteristic South African orders and extensive genera are nearly or entirely want ing in New Holland ; thus, iride\u00e6, mesembryanthe mum, pelargonium, and oxalis, so abundant at the Cape of Good Hope, occur very sparingly in New Holland,"], [874, "392 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. where the South African genera aloe, stapelia, clifsor tia, pen\u00e6a, and brunia, do not at all exist. Very few species are common to both countries, and of these, the oaly one which is at the same time peculiar to the southern hemisphere is osmunda barbara.\"* XXII.\u2014 THE WEST AUSTRALIA REGION. Extent. \u2014 The tropical features of New Holland are not fully developed on the north-west coast, which makes it necessary to extend the limits of this region in this direction. It will thus occupy the western portion of the continent from 123\u00b0 E. long., and become mingled with the New South Wales Region on the south coast in the neighbourhood of tl.e Morrumbidgee, the interior of the continent being unknown. Physical Characters. \u2014 It is a feature in New Holland that the shores are invested by a broad belt of sandy soil, which gives them a very unprepossessing aspect to the stranger, and most of all to the settler. This is succeeded by grassy and thinly-wooded plains. Such is particularly the character of this region. At a little distance from the coast is a parallel, but irregular and broken, range of hills ; and others detached are spread over the country. Basaltic rocks are not unfrequent, but that kind of sandstone known as ironstone, chiefly prevails, and forms the basis of the plains. Limestone is also not unusual. This surface generally is indif ferently supplied with streams. Climate. \u2014 Similar to that of New South Wales, but not so liable to extremes of temperature or to long droughts. At Perth the average temperature in Fe- * oFlinder's Voyages, Appendix, Vol. ii., p. 588."], [875, "VAN DIEMEN'S LAND REGION. 393 bruary, at four p.m. was 84**, in August 63\u00ab, and at ten a m. respectively, 81\u00b0 and 60\u00b0. The mean of these hours throughout the year are 72\u00b0 1 and 69\u00b0 5. January, February, and March, are the months of greatest heat and aridity. Flora. \u2014 The plants of this coast are almost entirely distinct from those of the east coast, but with King George's Sound they are strikingly identical. This pe culiarity, however, is chiefly confined to species. The most characteristic plants are species of casuarina, callitris, zamia, exocarpus, xanthorrh\u0153a, and kingia australis, and nutysia floribunda. Eucalyptus has few species, and angophora is not known. (Brown in Journal Geographical Society!) The northern limit of xan thorrh\u0153a is at 28\u00b0 S. lat. The vegetable productions, then, of this region are sufficiently peculiar, for whilst it fully retains Australian features, its closer forms are its own. Relations. \u2014 South African ferns are more abundant than in any other portion of the continent, and this is conspicuous even in its proteace\u00e6. An European plant, arenaria marina, is met with. XXIIL\u2014 THE VAN DIEMEN'S LAND REGION. Extent. \u2014 The island so called, situated between 40\u00bb 42' and 43\u00b0 43' S. lat., and having an area of 17,192 square miles. Physical Characters.\u2014 Van Diemen's Land has fewer of those extremes so frequent in the neighbouring-continent. The surface is occupied by fertile plains, occasionally swelling into hill and dale, and sometimes raised into ranges of inconsiderable elevation. Ben Lomond, to the"], [876, "394 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. north-west, attains 4,200 feet, and Mount Wellington, near Hobart Town in the south, about 3.700 feet. In the vicinity of the rivers are large plains with good soil, aud covered only with an herbaceous vegetation. The whole island is available, and rarely unfit for cultivation. Climate. \u2014 With our European notions of climate, this would be considered cold for the latitude. The seasons are more regular, and the distribution of heat and moisture more equable, thau in New South Wales. The smaller range of temperature is attributable to its insular position, aud the humidity to the prevalence of southerly winds. Flora. \u2014 There is a freshness and variety about the vegetation denied to New Holland. Though possessing many of its distinctive groups, the species are to a great extent limited ; its epacride\u00e6, proteace\u00e6, and myoporine\u00e6 have even peculiar genera. Eucalyptus, though with fewer species, attains here its greatest developement. Among its trees are podocarpus asplenifolius, dacrydium taxifolium, exocarpus cupressiformis, carpodontos lucida, atherosperma moschata, zieria arborescens, tasmannia australis, t. fragrans, with species of gaultheria, poma derris, and fagus. Cryptogamic plants are numerous, and some are identical with the European. Dicksonia antarc tica, an arborescent fern, is met with. Relations. \u2014 The connexions of the vegetation are widely extended. With the more temperate parts of Europe there are many genera in common, as stellaria, linum, viola, clematis, anemone, ranunculus, veronica, drosera, geranium, polygonum, cardamine, and nastur tium. With the South Africa region more particularly, by pelargonium, elichrysum, and oxalis ; with North America, by gaultheria and aster ; and with the Malaisia region, by podocarpus."], [877, "395 NEW ZEALAND REGION. XXIV.\u2014 THE NEW ZEALAND REGION. Extent.\u2014 Two islands situated between 34\u00b0 and 48\" S. lat., and with an area of 62,160 square miles. The northern is the smaller, but possesses the greatest capabi lities, and is called Eaheinomauwe. The southern is known as T'avai Poenammoo. Physical Characters. \u2014 A lofty range of mountains, from 12,000 to 14,000 feet high, traverses both islands, their upper portions covered with eternal snows, and their lower clothed with noble forests, the trees of which are equally distinguished for their tall and stately growth, as for their great girtb. The soil of the plains is plentiful in places, and yields a good return under cultivation. Climate. \u2014 Temperate, but liable to fluctuations. Flora. \u2014 Tropical vegetation still lingers in palms, arborescent ferns, and epiphytic orchidace\u00e6 ; the latter cease at 45\u00b0 S. lat. Areca sapida reaches 34\u00b0 S. lat. There is a curious mixture of its own peculiar forms with others common to both near and distant regions, as is evident in the genera drac\u00e6na, forstera, myoporum, melaleuca, avicennia, weinmannia, tetragonia, dicera, pitnelea, epacris, phormium, knightia, plagianthus, cya thea, angiopteris, gleichenia, fuchsia, andromeda, oxalis, and mesembryanthemum. Palms, tree-ferns, and epiphy tic orchidace\u00e6 all occur farther south than in New Holland. The kawrie, yielding valuable masts and spars, is the dammara australis or agathis australis. Relations. \u2014 The most interesting are with the Pata gonia Region through fuchsia, mniarum, drymis, ac\u00e6na, sisymbriuin, and lepidium ; and with the South Africa Region through gnaphalium, tetragonia, and oxalis. 4"], [878, "396 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. There are also some other interesting affinities with South America. Agathis loranthifolia, a near ally of the kawrie, abounds in the Moluccas. XXV.\u2014 THE SOUTH AFRICA REGION. Extent. \u2014 Southern Africa beyond the tropic; Cape L'Agulhas, the extreme point, is in 34\u00b0 55' S. L. Physical Characters. \u2014 \" The surface of this region is striking and peculiar, presenting three successive mountain ranges, running parallel to the coast and to each other. The first, called Lange Kloof, is between 20 and 60 miles from the ocean, the breadth of the intermediate plain being greatest in the west. The second chain, called the Zwaarte Berg, or Black Mountain, rises at an interval nearly similar behind the first, is considerably higher and more rugged, and consists often of double or triple ranges. Behind, at the distance of 80 or 100 miles, rises the Nieuweldts Gebirgte, the loftiest range in Southern Africa. The summits, to a great extent, are covered with snow ; from which circumstance the eastern and most elevated part is called the Sneuwberg, or Snowy Mountains, whose highest pinnacles are not supposed to fall short of 10,000 feet. The plain nearest the sea is fertile, well watered, richly clothed with grass and trees, and enjoys a mild and agreeable climate. The plains between the successive ranges are elevated, and contain a large proportion of the species of arid desert called karroo. The southern plain in particular is almost entirely composed of the great karroo, 300 miles in length and nearly 100 in breadth, covered with a hard and impenetrable soil, almost unfit for any vegetation. Along the foot of the Sneuwberg, however,"], [879, "397 SOUTH AFRICA REGION. there is a considerable tract, finely watered, and affording very rich pasturage. Beyond the mountains, the territory is for some space black and sterile ; but it gradually im proves till it opens into the extensive pastoral plain occu pied by the Boshuanas. So far as this has been explored to the northward, it becomes always more fertile, though to the west there has been observed a desert of very great aridity. The eastern coast also consists chiefly of a fine pastoral plain, occupied by the various Caffre tribes, and broken by some chains of mountains, the direction of which has been very imperfectly explored.\" \u2014 (Murray's Geo graphy.) The most fertile soil is found in the neighbour hood of the coasts, along the base of the Snowy Mountains, and in the vicinity of the rivers. Several rivers and streams traverse the country, becoming during the rains much swollen, and shrinking in the long and painful droughts to a small size, or to chains of muddy pools. Sandstone and granite greatly prevail in the mountain ranges, on which often repose clay-slate and greywache. \" As far as is at present known, the whole of the table-land of Africa to the north of the Orange River is composed of limestone in horizontal strata, clay-slate, sandstone, and quartz rock, granite, greenstone, serpentine, and potstone.\" \u2014 {Jameson in Murray's Geography.) In some places the soil is very salt. Climate. \u2014 Over such a diversified surface there will be much variety in the climate. The mean temperature and range are different in situations in the neighbourhood of each other, and the eastern coasts are colder than the western. Mr. Colebrook's observations give the mean of Cape Town 67\u00b0 3, and the extremes 96\u00b0 and 45\u00b0, or fifty one degrees. The mean of the coldest month is 57\u00b0, of the hottest 79\u00b0, least summer heat 77\u00b0, and the solar radia tion is very considerable. Inland both the mean and"], [880, "398 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. range are lower; at Stellenbosch the mean of one year's observations was 66\u00b0 3, range from 87\u00b0 to 50\u00b0 ; at Zwart land the mean 66\u00b0 5, range from 85\u00b0 to 54\u00b0. The year is divided into the cold or rainy season, which lasts from May to October, and the warm or dry season, from November to April. From the same we have some facts on the hygroscopic condition of the atmosphere obtained near False Bay from December to March. At sunrise the ordi nary dryness was 6\u00b0 or 7\u00b0, the extreme from 12\u00b0 to 3\u00b0. The maximum at noon was 26\u00b0, the greatest range within the day 35\", mean dryness of the morning 7\u00b0, of the noon 14\u00b0, and further minimum dryness scarcely a fourth of the atmospheric capacity for moisture. Flora. \u2014 This portion of Africa presents a good speci men of a particular variety of vegetation, where there is an intimate relation between the flora and external influencing circumstances, and a close adaptation of the organs of plants to the duties required of them. In many respects this is highly conspicuous ; the leaves are often very small or minutely divided, and clothed with hairs, or to mentose, or lanuginose investments ; many species are provided with fleshy succulent leaves, which do not part readily with their juices, and serve as so many magazines of nourishment, whilst the very numerous bulbous plants are eminently adapted to a climate which, for a long season, is extremely arid ; at this time the bulbs retain their vitality without requiring any nourishment, and are ready to assume activity on the appearance of the rains. The want of moisture, equally with low temperature, as seen in northern regions, would seem productive of a low, stunted, bushy vegetation, and is also characterised by the frequency of spinous organs, the disagreeable effects of which are expressed in the quaint name of wait-a-bit, given to acacia detinens. The colours of the flowers are usually rich and"], [881, "399 SOUTH AFRICA REGION. brilliant, the brightness of the solar rays, assisted by a clear atmosphere, having developed them in the most per fect manner. Pink, yellow, and white flowers greatly pre vail, with a rare mixture of those tamer colours seen in a luxuriant vegetation under a moist atmosphere. Though the flowers are not conspicuous for their fragrance, this is frequent in the foliage; we observe this in various pelargonium cultivated with us, and on the spot in species of diosma, composit\u00e6, and the numerous stapelia, if the carrion odour of the latter can be so called. The mention of a beautiful provision of nature must not be omitted, particularly as it involves a departure from a general rule. The capsules of several species of mesem bryanthemum refuse to open except when moistened by the rains, lest, opening in a dry season, they should shed their seeds on an unprepared soil. The very numerous species which constitute the flora of South Africa belong, to a considerable extent, to genera which are peculiar ; and even when it shares its natural families with other regions, its genera are rarely extended to them; as in proteace\u00e6. leguminos\u00e6, iride\u00e6, composit\u00e6, rosace\u00e6, and crucifer\u00e6. It is only in particular situations that forest exists, giving shelter to numerous savage buffa loes. The largest trees are ilex crocea, curtisia faginea, cunonia capensis, taxus elongata, laurus teterrima, olea ca pensis, tarchonanthus camphoratus, t. arboreus, brabejum stellatum, acacia vera, ekebergia capensis, and various pro teace\u00e6, gardenia, and royena. We will glance hastily over the prevailing families and their more peculiar genera. Proteace\u00e6 abounds in protea, serrularia, leucospermum, lorocephalus, spatalla, mimetes, and nivenia; Legumi nos\u00e6 has liparia, lebeckia, aspalathus, borbonia, les sertia, psoralia, podalyria, and schotia; Ericace\u00e6, the very numerous and interesting group of erica, and the far"], [882, "400 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. smaller genus bl\u00e6ria; Diosme\u00e6 prevail extensively in diosina, agathosma, adenandra, and baryosma ; Ascla- piade\u00e6, the numerous and strange stapelia, with huernia and gomphocarpus ; Crassulace\u0153, a family with some kin- dred habits, is represented in crassula, rochea, leptas, and cotyledon ; Ficoide\u00e6, by the various mesembryanthemum, with tetragonia and hymenogyne ; Polygale\u00e6, in polygala, muraltia, and mundia; Composit\u00e6 prevail extensively, and many are characterized by that peculiar texture of the flower belonging to everlastings. Most of the following genera are peculiar : chrysocoma, arctotis, othonna, osteo- spermum, tarchonanthus, sphnegyne, erichrysum, cacalia, pteronia, berckleya, and gazania; Orchidace\u00e6 cannot be supposed to be abundant ; disa and satyrium find conve- nient localities on the Table Mountain, and some of them are scarce; Iride\u0153 abound in ixia, gladiolus, tritonia, watsonia, hesperantha, sparaxis, babiana, and trichonema ; Amaryllide\u00e6 equally so in h\u00e6manthus, strumaria, bruns- vigia, nerine, cyrtanthus, and gethyllis. There are yet several important genera requiring notice : euphorbia has a group of species which simulate the habit of cacte\u00e6, and supply their place ; aloe has a great variety of species, and others are frequent, in oxalis, phyllica, restio, struthiola, cliffortia, roella, hypoxis, eucomis, massonia, lachenalia, and streletzia. Heliophila, a cruciferous genus, is monomic. Lobelia, cestrum, lyceum, chironia, and others prevail. Two families also claim to be regarded as monomic, \u2014 bru niace\u00e6 and pen\u00e6ace\u00e6. Climbing plants are uncommon, as are also cryptogamic. Some ferns are found on the sides of the Table Mountain, the particular flora of which has other evidences of a moister atmosphere. The mass of the vegetation is to a great extent confined to the colony, and several of its more peculiar groups, ericace\u00e6, proteace\u00e6, diosme\u00e6, and restiace\u00e6, do not appear on the arid karroo,"], [883, "THE MOZAMBIQUE REGION. 401 which is occdpied by gregarious species of lyceum, acacia, euphorbia, and mesembryanthemum. Some have a very limited range, and the species of stapelia abound more particularly on the arid sands of the west coast. Relations. \u2014 The various relations of a region so com- plete as that of South Africa must be extremely interesting ; and it seems probable that so rich a vegetation, with a liberal hand, gives more representatives to other regions than it receives from them. Passing over a more extensive view of its relations, we will confine our notice to groups having their chief existence elsewhere. A few of the genera of Europe, North America, and Siberia, have species here ; the presence also of salix, bryonia, and viola, recalls a dif- ferent latitude and climate. In common with the north- eastern portion of Africa, it has acacia vera, cucumis colo- cynthis, and a zizyphus; and has an affinity with New Hol- land in metrosideros angustifolia. Several introduced plants are becoming diffused, as solanum nigrum, sonchus oleraceus, and poiygonum persicaria. XXVI.\u2014 THE MOZAMBIQUE REGION. Extent. \u2014 That portion of the east coast of Africa be tween 10\u00b0 N. lat. and the south tropic in 23\u00b0 28' has been so little visited, that nothing is known of its vegetation, ex cept that it is clothed with rich forests, and has a climate in all respects tropical. Physical Characters. \u2014 Spacious plains abound near the coast, traversed by considerable rivers, and liable to partial submersion. Climate. \u2014 Tropical, moist, and frequently unhealthy, but well suited to the growth of the nutmeg, cinnamon, VOL. II.

Flora. \u2014 Further than that it abounds in luxuriant forest, and supplies us with Columba-root and a few other articles of commerce, little is known concerning it, and the native rulers are too jealous of foreigners to permit any examina tion of the interior of the country. Relations. \u2014 It differs so entirely from the regions to the north and south, that the propriety of its separation from them seems undoubted. XXVII.\u2014 THE MADAGASCAR REGION. Extent. \u2014 The large and fruitful island of Madagascar, situated between 12\u00b0 and 26\u00b0 S. lat., and the far smaller islands of Bourbon, Mauritius, and the Sechelles. Physical Characters. \u2014 In Madagascar, extensive fer tile plains extend from the shores towards a lofty range of mountains in the interior. The soil is represented as rich and highly productive, and extensive marshy districts are occupied as rice-fields. Climate. \u2014 Tropical, moist, and in some parts of Mada gascar extremely fatal to human beings. Flora, \u2014 Just enough of the productions of Madagascar are known to assure us they are peculiar, and to stimulate research. The vegetation is luxuriant, and varied with the usual aspect of the tropics. The natural family of chlenace\u00e6 is confined to it ; areanthes and other orchidace\u00e6 abound. Tanghinia veneniflua, yielding a most energetic poison, and hydrogeton fenestralis, remarkable for the structure of its leaves, are both natives. Several species of the small family of homaline\u00e6 are found in the islands, and also the myrtaceous genus jossinia."], [885, "403 THE WEST AFRICA REGION. The Mauritius has rather an extensive and tolerably well-known flora, and with a fair proportion of peculiar species. Danais and chasalia are confined to it. Bourbon closely resembles the Mauritius. The Sechelles are chiefly remarkable for a double fruited variety of cocos nucifera, which is produced on three of the islands. Relations. \u2014 From its position, Madagascar would seem to belong to Africa, but such observations as have been in stituted on its flora and that of the neighbouring coast, point out decidedly stronger affinities with India. Ed wardsia is common both to New Zealand and the Mau ritius. XXVIII.\u2014 THE WEST AFRICA REGION. Extent, \u2014 A considerable tract of country, inhabited by many populous nations, situated between the Great Sa hara or central desert of Africa and the Atlantic Ocean, and Cape Blanco, in 20\u00b0 55, N. lat, and 23\u00b0 28, S. lat, or the south tropic. Physical Characters. \u2014 In the neighbourhood of the coast the surface is composed chiefly of level plains, broken occasionally by ranges of low hills, and with chains of lofty mountains in the background, of primitive formation. Much of the soil is alluvial, and surprisingly productive ; and the banks of the numerous rivers are low, and during a part of the year extensively overflowed by the rising of the waters. At the mouth of some of the rivers are large salt-water marshes, covered by mangrove and other congenial plants. But salt, so abundant in other parts of Africa, is here in the interior so scarce as to be greatly prized. D D 2"], [886, "404 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. Climate. \u2014 Tropical, and generally moist; but in the vicinity of the desert partaking of its aridity. Flora. \u2014 Over this extensive surface there is little variety in the vegetation ; the same forms are continually repeated, and there is a scarcity of some of those elsewhere so abundant in the tropics. Palm\u00e6 have few species ; elais guineensis, ph\u0153nix spinosa, raphia vinifera, and the cocoa-nut, are the chief. Musace\u00e6, scitannne\u00e6, piperacc\u00e6, are scarce. Yet there is a denseness and luxuriance in the vegetation hardly surpassed in any other part of the world. The forest is extensive and magnificent, the trees attaining a large size ; and on the banks of the rivers which have been navigated some have been seen of enor mous dimensions. Cinchonace\u00e6, leguminos\u00e6, and mal vace\u00e6 abound ; ficus, cassia, acacia, and euphorbia have many species. Some of the more conspicuous belong to bombax, adansonia, sterculia, cadaba, parkia, hoflandia, melhania, pentadesma, crat\u00e6va, capparis, grewia, ptero carpus, psychotria, bignonia, avicennia, anona, and panda nus candelabrum. The Cape de Verd Islands have, perhaps, a less varied and vigorous vegetation than the coast. St. Helena, situated in 16\u00b0 S. lat., has the character of a very poor flora, but of which the members are nearly alto gether peculiar. Of 61 species, two or three only have been noticed elsewhere. Ferns, grasses, composit\u00e6, and the cocoa-nut and date-palm, are met with, but the climate is ungenial, and the sugar-cane scarcely thrives. The peak of Diana is elevated 2,692 feet. Ascension Island is situated in 7\u00b0 S. lat. The Green Mountain attains 2,818 feet. Some of the caves are ver dant with ferns. Grasses are in proportion numerous, and portulacca oleracea, euphorbia origanoides, asclepias curas savica, convolvulus arenarius, and carex pedunculata, over run the plains."], [887, "405 THE CANARY ISLANDS REGION. Relations. \u2014 Between the tropical portions of Asia, Africa, and America, many of the natural families are shared in common ; thus we see combretace\u00e6, meliace\u00e6, ochnace\u00e6, sapindace\u00e6, terebintace\u00e6, anonace\u00e6, sapote\u00e6, and potaliace\u00e6, all essentially tropical groups, freely repre sented in each. Frequently the genera are in common, but beyond this the relations are feeble. Still some exten sive families are only sparingly represented, as passiflore\u00e6, melastomace\u00e6, myrtace\u00e6, and loranthace\u00e6. It is probable that when the vegetation of the base and flanks of the Cameroon Mountains shall be known, they will require a separate consideration. Their supposed elevation is 13,000 feet. XXIX.\u2014 THE CANARY ISLANDS REGION. Extent. \u2014 These islands are in the same parallel at the Great Sahara, being situated off that part of the African coast where that desert meets the ocean, and are thus situ ated, in a geographical position, between the Barbary Re gion and the West Africa Region. In addition to the islands more properly known as the Canaries, the region includes the fertile island of Madeira, with the almost desert Porto Santo and the Dezertos, and the Azores. Physical Characters. \u2014 The islands of these groups may be regarded as so many mountains rising above the ocean to considerable elevations. Teneriffe attains 12,176 feet, and the highest part of Madeira, 6,233 feet. Their plains and valleys abound in a fertile soil, the productiveness of which is further insured by its volcanic origin, insular position, copious supply of moisture, and warm atmosphere. In some parts lava prevails so completely as to exclude vege-"], [888, "406 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. tation, and those islands with an aspect towards the coast of Africa are materially affected by its arid breezes. Climate. \u2014 The temperature is warm and even, but some parts are subject to considerable depression from sudden gusts, which sweep the cold air from the summits. The mean of Funchal, Madeira, is 65\u00b0, number of rainy days 73, and fall of rain 31 inches. At Santa Cruz, Te neriffe, the mean is 71\u00b0. The temperature given for the alpine regions of vegetation are calculated ; those used by Spix and Von Martius are assumed from the calculations of Howard ; we therefore pass them over till we possess strictly observed data. Flora. \u2014 This must be regarded as an alpine region, and the different portions of its flora have been described by Humboldt, Von Buck, Von Martius, and Kuhl. There is, however, some discrepancy between their statements; for not only are the alpine regions of Teneriffe made to differ from those of Madeira, but also from the rest of the Canaries. In attempting to reduce them to mutual con sistency we shall follow out the views we have previously expressed on this subject* Teneriffe has been ably examined by Humboldt, and his regions are nearly natural. 1. The Region of Lowland Cultivation extends to 1 ,800 feet. It is distinguished by the presence of a few tropical forms; drac\u00e6na draco, ph\u0153nix dactylifera, cham\u00e6rops hu milis, musa paradisaica, m. sapientum, arborescent euphor bias, and some species of mesembryanthemum from Africa, meet species of cactus from America. 2. The Region of the Woods extends to 7,200 feet. These woods are lofty and extensive, and comprise laurus indica, I. f\u0153tens, 1. nobilis, rhamnus glandulosa, erica * London Journal of Botany for March, 1842."], [889, "407 THE CANARY ISLANDS REGION. arborea, erica texo, quercus canariensis. Ferns are nume rous. A convenient subdivision may be established, since the pines occupy only the upper part of this region for the breadth of 25,000 feet; thus constituting \u2014 1, the sub region of laurels to 5,400 feet ; 2, the sub-region of pines to 7,200 feet. 3. The Region of Shrubs. \u2014 Spartium nubigenum abounds, and not much else, for the surface is chiefly vol canic ashes. 4. The Region of Grasses. \u2014 Scrophularia glabrata, viola cheiranthifolia, and the cruciferous plants, cheiranthus longifolius, c. frutescens, c. scoparius, erysimum bicorne, crambe strigosa, c. l\u00e6vigata, are met with. 5. The Region of Cryptogamic Plants. \u2014 It contains only urceolaria and other lichens. Madeira, as the name implies, was formerly covered with woods, but the early cultivation of the sugar-cane, and sub sequently of the vine, and still more recently the adoption of grazing, has produced a total change in the original fea tures of the vegetation. 1. The Region of Lowland Cultivation extends to 2,000 feet. The agave, plantain, date, pomegranate, and fig all thrive well. Of sixty species found here, 36 are common to the north of Europe, 17 to southern Europe and northern Africa, and 7 peculiar to the Canary Region. Among them is scarcely a genus with more than one species. 2. The Region of Woods extends to 3,000 feet. The trees are not numerous ; castanea vesca, pinus canariensis, laurus f\u00e6tens, 1. indica, clethra arborea. In thirty-two species, eight only are European, the remainder being pe culiar. Here, therefore, the flora is more characteristic, and introduced plants have not attained this elevation. 3. The Region of Shrubs extends to the loftiest part of the island. Spartium scoparium, cytisus divaricatus, erica"], [890, "408 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. scoparia, and vaccinium padifolium, abound. Grasses, be longing to cynosurus, aira, and agrostis, begin to appear on the higher stations. In Madeira succulent plants are frequent ; the trees have coriaceous leaves, and the northern families of amentace\u00e6, saxifrage\u00e6, and caryophylle\u00e6, are uncommon, as are the tropical families of euphorbiace\u00e6 and malvace\u00e6. Of com posit\u00e6, the tribe of corymbifer\u00e6 is scarce, but cichorace\u00e6 abundant. The Azores are situated something to the north of the other islands. Like them they are volcanic, with bold scenery, scarped rocks, deep ravines, and a general elevation of the surface from 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The indigenous flora is scanty, but the climate is good, and highly suited to the growth of tropical and such other fruits as have been introduced. From their supposed comparatively recent origin, the early history and subsequent diffusion of vegeta tion might be satisfactorily studied here. Relations. \u2014 In such a region a considerable change must have been produced by the extinction of native plants> and the introduction of others. Its affinities are more copious with Europe than south Africa. The species of cactus are regarded as instances of migration from America, and drac-\u00e6na draco is supposed to have come originally from India. Of 62 plants collected at Teneriffe in Kotzebue's first voyage, 30 were peculiar to our region, 30 common with Europe, and 2 with Africa. Von Buch mentions 533 species as belonging to the Canaries, of which he considers 162 as introduced."], [891, "THE BARBARY REGION. 409 XXX.\u2014 THE BARBARY REGION. Extent. \u2014 The northern part of Africa, embracing the states of Morocco, Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, is separated by the Great Sahara from the rest of the continent, and to the west is beaten by the waves of the Atlantic, whilst to the east it extends nearly to the delta of the Nile. The Atlas range of mountains forms an important portion of this region ; and, when better known, will most probably con tain its greatest peculiarities. There are also some other mountains of considerable elevation. Physical Characters. \u2014 With much dry and barren land, there are also extensive districts of great fertility. The soil is generally sandy, but productive when supplied freely with moisture ; and the neighbourhood of the Atlas mountains is indicated as possessing much that is rich and fertile. From the elevated lands numerous streams descend to the plains ; those towards the north finding an outlet in the Mediterranean Sea, whilst those falling to the south are chiefly lost in the thirsty sands of the desert The highest ascertained part of the Atlas range is 11,400 feet, is in the vicinity of Morocco, and clothed with perpetual snow. Salt marshes and lakes, and saline soils, are all of frequent occurrence. Climate. \u2014 The heat is great, but not so oppressive as in Egypt or Arabia, in the same latitude. At Algiers the mean of the year is 70\u00b0, of the summer 80\u00b02, and of the winter 61\u00b04. Vegetation is in its greatest vigiour in autumn, after the rains. It is then that a crowd of herba ceous plants hasten to spread abroad their beauty, retiring rapidly as the moisture disappears ; leaving a bushy vegeta tion to struggle with the parching atmosphere of the dry months."], [892, "410 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. Flora. \u2014 Only a partial examination has been made, and our chief acquaintance with the vegetation is due to M. Defontaines. It is owing to this that a very powerful con nexion has been traced with the vegetable productions on the northern shores of the Mediterranean. When our knowledge of the interior is more complete, a greater pro portion of peculiar forms will undoubtedly be discovered ; at least such is a fair inference from what is observed else where. Upwards of 2,000 species are known, and it has been remarked that, though a great number are peculiar, they belong to genera shared with Europe. In 344 woody kinds, about a hundred are peculiar. Those groups of plants which prefer a dry warm atmosphere, such as legu minos\u00e6, malvace\u00e6, labiat\u00e6, solane\u00e6, caryophylle\u00e6, and certain composit\u00e6, prevail. Among characterising genera may be mentioned rhus, zizyphus, vitex, viburnum, dios pyros, pistacia, celtis, tamarix, juniperus, thuja, olea, adonis, verbascum, smilax, cercis, cistus, nerium, and agave. Pinus halepensis grows in large forests, and other species are frequent; a large surface is occupied by ph\u0153nix dactylifera. On the Atlas range are many quercus, and fagus, alnus, salix, with many herbaceous genera common to Europe. Relations. \u2014 We separate this from the Nile region, on account of its alpine vegetation ; and from the European regions, though undoubtedly some affinities are great, since the same combination of alpine and lowland vegetation does not occur in any of them. The alpine features more closely coincide with the Pyrenees, whilst those of the plains recall Italy and the south-east of Europe."], [893, "411 THE NILE REGION. XXXI.\u2014 THE NILE REGION. Extent. \u2014 The whole portion of country traversed by the Nile and its tributary branches. Towards its source the elevation of the surface compensates for the lower lati tude, producing a milder climate and corresponding vege tation. It thus embraces a broad belt of country between the Red Sea and the Great Sahara, by which its isolation from other botanical regions is rendered nearly complete. Physical Characters. \u2014 There is much diversity in the surface. The valley of Lower Egypt presents an uniform plain, almost without a hill, and subject to the periodical inundations of the Nile. Gradually a chain of bare and rugged mountains converge towards the river, leaving the intervening valley with only the breadth of a few miles. Upper Egypt assumes a bolder character ; the banks of the Nile become rocky, and the inundations far less general. In Nubia, for this reason, the river is sometimes unap proachable, and a laboured irrigation is practised. Abys sinia is traversed by piles of mountain masses of extreme barrenness, and with intervening valleys, whose rich and productive soil is some compensation for their sterility. There is here a general elevation of the surface, and some of the mountains attain a great height. Egypt has been justly considered a granary with almost an unfailing supply; a productiveness which is dependent more on the overflow ings of the Nile, than on any inherent richness of its some what sandy soil. Climate. \u2014 Few regions would, perhaps, supply us with more interesting sources of the adaptation of the vegetation to the climate, if we were furnished with the necessary information. The temperature is warm ; that of Lower Egypt particularly so, the mean summer heat of Cairo"], [894, "412 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. being 92\u00b0. Rain is scarce ; the dews, however, are heavy. Rain is more frequent about the Delta, and in the vicinity of the coast, than elsewhere. Thunder and lightning are even more uncommon than rain. The seasons are not very strongly marked, and run imperceptibly and rapidly into each other. Summer commences in June, and lasts till September. Autumn succeeds. The cold season begins in December, and lasts two months ; and in February spring makes its appearance. Harvest succeeds in seven or eight weeks to the sowing; and the trees lose their leaves in the cold seasons, and are rapidly replaced by new. The inundations of the Nile, to which Egypt owes its vast fertility, are due to the autumnal rains of Abyssinia. Their effects are visible in the first week of July, when the river begins to swell; and, continuing to increase, has reached half its augmentation in August, and its greatest in the latter days of September. For two weeks it con tinues stationary, till on the 10th of November it has fallen one-half, and afterwards continues to decrease till the 16th of May, when it has reached its lowest. Flora. \u2014 For three months the vegetation of Egypt is bathed in the overflowing waters of the Nile. As these subside a rapid vegetation ensues, the period of fructifica tion is hastened and has passed away, and during the remainder of the year a parching aridity prevails. The superior luxuriance belonging to the former would be greatly misplaced in the latter ; and, regarding the charac ter of the vegetation, that particular variety has been dis pensed to it which is congenial to the dry seasons, and will survive the inundation. It is not be expected that the flora will be numerous ; and the aspect of the country is uniform and tame, being only relieved by some accidental trees of mimosa, zizyphus, ph\u0153nix'dactylifera, and cucifera thebaica. Abyssinia is more fruitful, and contains many"], [895, "413 THE NILE REGION. spots of rich variety, and patches of fine forest In accord ance with these views, succulent plants are common ; the leaves are those suited to a dry atmosphere, and spinous organs are much developed. It has been deemed singular that fungi should be entirely wanting in a soil for a certain period saturated with moisture, and apparently suited to their ephemeral existence. In some barren spots, beyond the reach of the inundation, certain plants have established themselves, and drag on a starved and stunted existence. The valley of Lower Egypt is not likely to present a very perfect specimen of an indigenous flora, having been under the closest cultivation for many ages ; and it is probable that its alluvial soil has been the gradual deposit of the Nile, and that it has received its vegetation from Abyssinia and elsewhere. We shall, therefore, direct our attention chiefly to the former. Some insight into the flora of Abyssinia has been ob tained, particularly by Salt and Caillaud, who made collec tions. Many of its species are found to be peculiar, and to bear a larger proportion to the entire vegetation. Leguminos\u00e6 are very abundant through acacia, cassia, mimosa, pterolobium, erythrina, alhagi, desmanthus, and bauhinia. Other conspicuous genera are euphorbia, avi cennia, juniperus, tamarix, zygophyllum, fagonia, polym nia, \u0153rua, brucea, balsamodendron, cordia, and pistacia. Coffea arabica is indigenous, and fresnella fontanesii forms thick groves on some of the hills. Gramine\u00e6 are nume rous, and several kinds of holcus, sorghum, poa, and andropogon, are cultivated. In those frequent situations, where neutral salts are mixed with the soil, are salsola, salicornia, traganum, and calligonum. The bed of the Nile is often closely set with sedges and flags. Papyrus antiquorum is equally found here and in the lakes of Abys sinia. Nelumbium speciosum has disappeared ; yet still"], [896, "414 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. the rivers of India and China are enlivened by its fine red flowers. The white-flowered nymph\u00e6a lotus abounds ; and n. c\u00e6rulea is sometimes seen. Arum colocasia is cultivated for food. The vast sea of land of the Great Sahara is an effectual barrier to the extension of the flora of this region, in the direction over which it prevails. It consists of a low flat plain, with the surface covered with white and grey quartz, and becoming more shingly towards the east, or in the direction of the prevailing wind. It is towards its eastern part that the oases chiefly exist, affording a grateful rest ing-place to the traveller, occupied by a rather numerous population, and having a lively vegetation. The dreari ness of the surrounding waste is here replaced by groves of date-palm. Acacia vera and other species shade the gushing streams, and tufts of grasses vary the surface. Relations. \u2014 Many of the plants frequent on the shores of the Mediterranean appear in Lower Egypt ; and some of those of Arabia cross the Red Sea to Nubia and Abys sinia. The most interesting relation, however, is with the South Africa Region through several species of mesembry anthemum, pelargonium abyssinicum, protea abyssinica, hagenia abyssinica, brunia ciliata, albuca abyssinica, and geissorhiza abyssinica. Adansonia digitata of the west coast re-appears, and the trunk is applied to entombing the dead. A tropical character is displayed in some of the genera enumerated, and in musa ensete. Rosa abyssinica occurs in the valleys of that country. XXXII. THE ASIA MINOR REGION. Extent. \u2014 Let us suppose ourselves stationed at the head of the Persian Gulf, and then project lines to the 10"], [897, "415 THE ASIA MINOR REGION. west and north in the direction of the latitude and longi tude. These, with the Caspian Sea, the range of Caucasus, the Black Sea, and the Mediterranean, will enclose an in teresting portion of country, watered by the Euphrates and other considerable rivers, and comprising Syria, Palestine, the rich provinces of Turkey in Asia, Bagdad, and a portion of Persia. Physical Characters. \u2014The aspect and general features are variable. In some places it would be difficult to exceed the dreary barrenness and unproductive nature of the sur face, resisting with complete success any invasion from vegetation. There are, however, others, and they are numerous, where the verdure and fertility are of the most agreeable kind. In Asia Minor, between the ranges of hills, are often beautiful and extensive plains in full cultivation, and dotted by the villages of the inhabitants ; the groups of cypress and the singular burying-grounds pointing out those of the Turks, whilst cultivation and its attendants indi cate those of the more thrifty Albanians. These plains are always well watered by streams originating in the surround ing mountains, and their benefits are greatly extended by irrigation, which from the aridity of the soil seems indis pensable. Climate. \u2014 This is generally regarded as warm, but some parts, as Bagdad, are distinguished for their great beat, and the northern winds produce a rapid and impor tant depression of temperature. The summer months are generally warm and very dry, and the atmosphere is serene and transparent. Rain is even scarce in some places. Flora. \u2014 The vegetation of Asia Minor is eminently adapted to delight the traveller. He is not buried in a vast dark sorest, where the view is most circumscribed, and without objects to engage attention. Forest trees are grouped together in the valleys and mountain sides, whilst"], [898, "416 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. occasional open spaces are in the undisturbed possession of piles of rocks, or more profitably occupied in agriculture. Sometimes a waving line of brighter green points out the course of a river or mountain stream. The foliage is gene rally distinguished for its evergreen character, the dark sombre shade of its colour, aud the leathery consistence of the leaves. The trees most prominent are quercus infec toria, platanus orientalis, pistacia terebinthus, p. lentiscus, and other species of these genera, pinus halepensis, abies orientalis, cupressus sempervirens, juniperus sabina, cera tonia siliqua, juglans regia, liquidambar imberbe, and others of acer, celtis, fraxinus, and celsia. Among the smaller vegetation, labiat\u00e6 are numerous, and have their chief station here. The nearly allied family scrophularine\u00e6 is also freely represented, and cucurbitace\u00e6 and asphodele\u00e6 are conspicuous for their numbers. In some parts are ex tensive tracts producing a great multitude of individuals of tamarix, acacia, glycirrhiza, and hedysarum alhagi. And in others of even a less favourable character are met with chenopodium, ruta, rumex, artemisia, centaurea, amaran tus, cucumis, lyceum, solanum, mesembryanthemum, and asclepias syriaca ; which last, though a pretty plant, has an extensive range, and is every where a weed. The vege tation of Mount Caucasus is particularly rich and fasci nating, but it has a very European character. Relations. \u2014 I regard this region as separable from the Danube Region, with which it has much in common, in the different aspects of the vegetation, and in the partial ces sation, sometimes nearly complete, of several genera as populus, spir\u00e6a, crat\u00e6gus, campanula, rhamnus, viola, &c, and of the group of umbellifer\u00e6. With the China Region it has many interesting relations, and prunus armenaica, which is represented as covering the sides of Caucasus, is again seen in China ; and with North America there are"], [899, "417 THE ARABIA REGION. several through \u00e6sculus, juglans, and liquidambar. Ulmus campestris is supposed to have been introduced to Pales tine by the Crusaders. XXXIII.\u2014 THE ARABIA REGION. Extent. \u2014 The Arabian peninsula, and separated from the adjoining region by a line extending due west from the head of the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean sea. Physical Characters. \u2014 Arabia is little else than an extensive desert clothed with straggling thorny shrubs, and having some spots of redeeming fertility. Rocky cheerless mountains traverse it, occasionally sheltering within them small fertile valleys, called Wadis. About Yemen, the country is superior, and vegetation has some luxuriance, and is remarkable for its fragrant qualities. Climate. \u2014 An excessive clearness and transparency pre vail in the atmosphere from the scarcity of moisture. The skies are almost always cloudless ; from June to September showers occasionally fall, but chiefly about Yemen or Arabia Felix. Hot winds, coming from Africa, sometimes sweep its western shores. Flora. \u2014 Arabia, famed for its spices, derives its repu tation more probably from being a country of transit, than as their source. Still it has contributed its share, and even the general character of the shrubs is aromatic. Moving eastward, we meet in this region several new forms, re minding us strongly of Asiatic vegetation. Where forest exists, numerous species of ficus enter largely into it, mingled with sterculia platinifolia, tomex glabra, grewia, populifera, balsamodendron gileadense, b. opobalsamum, b. kataf, b. kafal, m\u00e6rua uniflora, m. racemosa, cynan- VOL. II. E E"], [900, "418 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. chum arboreum, celastrus edulis, c. parviflora, keura odori fera, and pandanus odoratissimus. Little woods of arbo rescent euphorbia occur. Cryptogamic plants, gramine\u00e6, and cvperace\u00e6, are all scarce. Some of the bulbous plants of South Africa make their appearance, cucurbitace\u00e6 are not uncommon, and succulent plants are also frequent. Coffea arabica is regarded as not indigenous, and the testi mony of the Arabians themselves refers its origin to Abys sinia. Acacia arabica is native, and some active medicines are produced, as senna, aloes, myrrh, and olibanum. Socotra is a mountainous island, consisting of granite, of indifferent fertility, nearly bare of trees, and distinguished for its aloes, dates, and dragon's blood. Relations. \u2014 Its tropical forms are chiefly from India, but the most interesting affinities are with the South Africa Region through aloe, stapelia, mesembryanthemum, and b\u00e6minthus. Several species are shared in common with the Nile Region. XXXIV\u2014 THE TARTARY REGION. Extent. \u2014 A broad irregular space, of peculiar aspect and fluctuating fertility, occupies the centre of Asia be tween the Altai and Himma-leh chains of mountains, in cluding the states of Tartary, Thibet, and portions of Persia and Cabul. Physical Characters. \u2014 Situated as it is between stu pendous mountain chains, the greater part of the surface presents a considerable, but varying elevation, and is further diversified by being traversed by others of inferior grandeur. Aridity chiefly prevails, much of the soil being very sandy ; large portions are sometimes so salt as not to yield the slightest vegetation, and the wind is said to"], [901, "THE SIBERIA REGION. 419 drive it on the bushes and cover them as with a hoar frost. Partial fertility is imparted by the streams, and more par ticularly by the rivulets occasioned by the rains. Climate. \u2014 Extremes characterize the seasons; the summers are burning and arid, and the winters severe and nipping. Flora. \u2014 Wherever there is shelter and some moisture, trees from the Asia Minor Region are met with, as pistacia lentiscus, p. terebinthus, pinus pinea, morus nigra, olea europea, and some oaks. Species of artemisia spread in crowds, impregnating the atmosphere with their peculiar aroma, and giving a bluish green tint to the steppes. Other characteristic species are spartium junceum, s. spi nosum, statice tartarica, calligonum polygonoides, and others of seliuum, centaurea, tamarix, salvia, verberis, ruta, lyceum, solanum, capparis, asclepias, astragalus, hedysarum, spir\u00e6a, rumex, and lithospermum. The fruits are those of warm temperate latitudes, and millet barley, sorghum, amarantus, and paspalum are cultivated. Relations. \u2014 The flora is poor, and so indifferently known, that this portion of its history remains in obscurity. The proportion of spinous plants is unusually great. XXXV.\u2014 THE SIBERIA REGION. Extent. \u2014 A continuous barrier, enclosing the vast steppes of Siberia, is formed by the Ural and Altai moun tains, which forms its western and southern borders, and terminates at the sea of Okotsk in 55\u00b0 north latitude. The steppes of Ischin, a portion of Tartary, is thus in closed, and the region is limited to the north by the extent of the growth of trees somewhere about 65\" north latitude. E E 2"], [902, "420 THF. REGIONS OF VEGETATION. The whole of the Altai range is comprehended, and con stitutes an important portion. Physical Characters. \u2014 The surface within the moun tain ranges presents an extensive level plain, traversed by numerous large rivers with a general course to the Arctic- Ocean, and therefore with an inclination towards the north. The aspect and nature of the surface varies ; to wards the north it is dreary and usually frozen ; more to the south there are extensive districts of rich dark soil, and in the vicinity of the rivers are fine alluvial tracts. Small lakes and marshy patches abound, with their peculiar vegetation, and saline substances are occasionally largely mixed with the soil. The highest parts of the Altai range do not attain any considerable height. Climate. \u2014 Siberia is not so bleak and inhospitable as has been generally represented, though, compared with similar parallels in Europe, or even in Amerca, it must still be called inclement. Over much the soil is frozen even to June, but where the inhabitants can be drawn from the chase of the fur animals to the less exciting pur suits of agriculture, large and profitable crops of the northern cerealia are produced. The variety and beauty, with tiie occasional richness of the vegetation, is an un questionable proof that the climate is not always severe. Flora. \u2014 The clothing of vegetation which invests the surface, varies in different situations. In some are thick forests, in others extensive marshes ; large tracts are some times covered with saline plants, or lastly, a luxuriant and pleasing vegetation prevails. The forest chiefly follows the direction of the rivers, and the pine prevails. Among the herbaceous vegetation, perennials are by far the most abundant, and though numerous species are iden tical with European, a great many are peculiar, and some still new to science. Nowhere, perhaps, do herbaceous"], [903, "421 THE SIBERIA REGION. plants so truly luxuriate as in these latitudes, where they are in unrestricted possession of the rich soil. Their short existence through the summer month-; is compensated by a vigorous growth and obtrusive beauty. The pre dominating families are ranunculace\u00e6, crucifer\u00e6, umbelli fer\u00e6, leguminos\u00e6, saxifrage\u00e6, and caryophylle\u00e6. As the seasons advance, labiat\u00e6, scrophularine\u00e6, and boragine\u00e6, contribute important members ; whilst liliace\u00e6 and iride\u00e6 are conspicuous among the spring vegetation. The indi viduality of the flora depends almost entirely on species, for the genera are extremely similar to those of Europe, and though the features of the vegetation are different, a catalogue would appear to show a close resembance. A few may be mentioned as to some extent distinctive, and which have usually several species ; astragalus, hedysarum, caragana, pedicularis, p\u0153onia, zygophyllum, phloniis, ephedra, and robinia. Ceratocarpus arenaria and diotis ceratoides are represented as covering large tracts ; whilst the saline plants belong chiefly to polycnemum, atriplex, chenopodium, frankenia, tamarix, nitraria, and salicornia. Pallas and Ledebour are almost our only authorities for Siberian vegetation. The latter has examined somewhat closely the flora of the Altai Mountains between 47\u00b0 and 54\u00b0 north latitude, and 73\u00b0 and 87\u00b0 east longitude. The influence of aspect was found to be important in favour of the south ; from various observations, the limit of per petual snow seems as high as 7,350 feet ; in some places corn grew at 4,400 feet, and here also was the limit of habi tations. At 4,900 feet the vegetation most resembles that of Europe. The highest limit of trees is 7,200 feet ; pinus cem bra, with a south aspect, attains 7,200 feet, and with a north aspect, 5,800 feet. Betula alba reaches 5,850 feet, and pinus siberica and abies communis grow together to the height of 5,800 feet where they both cease. Ledebour mentions two 4"], [904, "422 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. peculiarities in the vegetation ; the nearly total absence of hard-wooded trees, such as those furnished by quercus, fagus, acer, tilia, carpinus, aud fraxinus; and that many of the fami lies which have numerons species are represented by few genera; thus, saussurea, serratula, and artemisia in compo sit\u00e6, zygophyllum in rutace\u00e6, and astragalus, oxytropis, and phaca in leguminos\u00e6 monopolize the far greater part of the species in their respective families. Relations. \u2014When we reflect how much the continuity of the land has diffused the animal and vegetable produc tions of the northern part of Europe, Asia, and America, the Siberia Region must be allowed to have retained its entireness with great success. At the southern limits of the Altai range such a change occurs in the climate and physical characters as to be incompatible with a vegetation like that of Siberia. Towards Bering's Straits, though the interval is small, the difference between the two coasts is as marked as can be expected between neighbouring re gions. Kamtschatka has received no important accessions from America, though the flora of the latter is represented in rhododendron, robinia, erigeron, claytonia, and trillium. This distinction is less evident on its west side, where the plants of Europe and Siberia intermingle. Through rheum and p\u0153ouia it claims an alliance with the more southern floral regions of Asia. XXXVI.\u2014 THE JAPAN REGION. Extent. \u2014 Balbi, in his Geographie, has indicated a Sinico-Japanese Region, but the lofty volcanic mountains, insular position, and rough climate of Japan, would seem to point to a peculiar vegetation, and one with predominat ing alpine features. The foundation of this region con-"], [905, "423 THE .JAPAN REGION. sists of Niphon and Jesso, with the other islands known collectively as Japan. It also includes the long island of Saghalien, and a portion of the main of peculiar aspect and nearly covered with forest, situated between 55\u00bb north latitude and the river Hoang-ho in China. The penin sula of Correa is thus embraced, and the northern part of China, in which is situated the capital Peking, but a tract of country of great aridity and barrenness. Physical Characters. \u2014 The aspect of the Japanese Islands is bold and rugged, and the mountains are ele vated far above the line of perpetual snow. The con nental portion, except to the south, is traversed by moun tain chains. Climate. \u2014 Severe for the latitude and prone to ex tremes. At Nangasaki, in 32\u00b0 45 north latitude, observa tions give the mean temperature as 68\", aud the range in the year from upwards of a hundred degrees to below the freezing point. Flora. \u2014 It is but indifferently known ; the mass of the vegetation is temperate, but singularly mixed with tropical forms. Raphis flabellifoimis and cycas revoiuta mingle with species of acer, quercus, thuja, pinus, and juniperus. Thunberg collected near Naugasaki 755 ph\u00e6nogamous plants, which certainly bespeaks a flora rich in forms. Its bizarre character will be visible in pinus, abies, larix, tilia, salix, citrus, bumbusa, ficus, olea, mespilus, cydonia, prunus, salisburia, podocarpus, clerodendron, nerium, laurus, diospyros, paullinia, vitex, melia, broussonetia, camellia, illicium, and hydrangea. Like the China Region, the vegetation in connexion with the climate well deserves attentive study. Relations. \u2014 In many respects they are close with China, and also abundant with Siberia through pinus cembra, the birch, the larch, and the willow, &c, The"], [906, "424 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. affinities with the North American Regions are much stronger than happen in the China Region, through sam bucus, \u00e6sculus, pavia, magnolia, vitis, bignonia, juglans, and rhododendron. XXXVIL\u2014 THE CHINA REGION. Extent\u2014 A large portion of the east of Asia, comprising the vastempire of China, Correa, Japan, and the islands border ing the coast, presents a remarkable vegetation, influenced by some peculiarities of climate, and having many interesting relations with other and sometimes distant regions, from all which its isolation is complete. I regard it as conveniently divided into two regions ; the China Region, and the Japan Region ; the former entertaining copious relations with India, and the latter with Siberia. The China Region, the object of our present attention, does not embrace the whole of that empire, but that portion of it situated between the Hoang-ho, or great river, and the Gulf of Tonquin. Its western boundary is within a line stretching from the Gulf of Tonquin to the Himma-leh Mountains, and, continu ing along the chain which separates Thibet from China, ceases at the Tartary Region. To the east it is bounded by the Pacific Ocean, but includes the islands of Formosa Loo-Choo, and Hainan. Physical Characters.\u2014 No country in the world pre sents such a forbidding aspect as China. The land on the southern shores is generally bold, and seems to be so swept by the periodical winds that vegetation will not thrive. A little feru and coarse grass alone resist them, with occasion ally a few stunted bushes. In other places the shores are low, and flooded by the sea. Where, however, there are"], [907, "425 THE CHINA REGION. sheltered valleys vegetation prospers, and is more distin guished for its variety than luxuriance. The interior of the country, on the lowest estimate, supports a population of 230 to the square mile, the chief part of which has for ages been engaged in the great na tional pursuit of agriculture, and cannot have failed, in this long period, to have materially altered the face of the country, and to have driven the native flora to the moun tains, and other places not favourable to cultivation. To this may also be attributed the scarcity of forest, but it must at the same time be remembered that this latitude elsewhere is not remarkable for this kind of vegetation. Particulars of the interior of China have been collected by the English and Dutch embassies, and in the writings of the Jesuit missionaries. The country is traversed by several moun tain chains of no great elevation, pursuing various direc tions, and impressing a picturesque and even romantic as pect on much of the scenery. This is aided too by the scattered growth of trees, which are spread in open irregu lar clumps, and by the methodical and extreme cultivation of the plains. The prevailing mineral structures are granite, often traversed by veins of quartz or supporting blocks of it, coarse limestone, clay-slate, and sandstones. Bazaltic trap occurs in the island of Hong-kong. It was very generally observed that the rocks were in a state of rapid disintegration. The soil has an universal character throughout China, consisting of a loam of a red or ferrugi nous colour, sometimes clayey, and capable of being formed into bricks, which become blue after burning. The soil itself is sufficiently productive, and is diligently assisted by a persevering upturning and division of the lumps, the plentiful application of manure, and the most laboured irri gation. The mountains are rocky and barren, scattered with trees of quercus glauca or other species, laurus"], [908, "426 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. camphora, or stillingiasebifera. The range separating the province of Canton is extensively wooded with pinus mas soniana and p. lanceolata. Many bushes of melastoma, myrtus, rhus, camellia, eugenia, and chloranthus, abound in similar situations. Climate. \u2014 Meteorological observations have been con ducted at Canton through a series of years, which give some satisfactory mean results. June, July, and August, are the summer months, as with us, and the heat is intense. In December, January, and February, the weather is equally bleak and cold. The mean temperature is 70\u00b0 4', and the range from *29\u00bb to 94o, or sixty-five degrees. It is in all respects a climate of extremes, for both the annual and diurnal range is great and its peculiarities will be placed in the strongest light by a comparison with that of Calcutta, San Bias in Mexico, or other places in a nearly similar latitude. The influence of the sun's rays in the cold season is great est according to my observations, at one p. m., when their radiating power is 43\u00b0 above the shade. The hygrometric state of the atmosphere does not appear so much influenced by the seasons as usual. Rain falls in all the months, but by far the greatest quantity in the summer. The mean of sixteen years observations is 70*6 inches. The amount varies greatly in different years, and also in different months. Thus ninety inches have been known, and in 1840 there only fell sixty-one inches. The range of the hygrometer is probably below the average, for in the dry season I never obtained a greater depression than 6\", and even then the dews were very heavy. Flora. \u2014 The vegetation comprises great variety in species, and attractive kinds are more than usually abun dant. It has been observed that, in relation to the space, forest is not frequent, but this is met by a great variety of low shrubby plants, the preponderance of which is character-"], [909, "427 THE CHINA REGION. istic. Generally their foliage is evergreen, and with the customary rich deep green shades. Aromatic qualities also prevail among them. The flowers, though not of large size, are very frequently of rich deep colours, having a very showy appearance, and when they fade are succeeded by berries nearly as attractive from their varied colours as the flowers. The number of different kinds of berries yielded by the shrubs is really astonishing. One of the most strik ing features of the region is the mixed character of the vegetation, and it would perhaps be impossible to find it carried to a similar extent elsewhere. The violet is seen blooming under the shelter of the melastoma, the bamboo and the pine grow together on the hills, and the potato and sugar cane are cultivated in the same field. A great num ber of natural families are represented, some of which are more prominent than others. Aurantiace\u00e6 is particularly abundant ; three species of orange are indigenous, and there are many varieties, and the fruit is always fine. The climate is undoubtedly eminently favourable to this group. Camellie\u00e6 is nearly limited here, and has several impor tant species. Rhamne\u00e6, connarace\u00e6, nepenthe\u00e6, legumi nos\u00e6, composit\u00e6, myrtace\u00e6, sterculiace\u00e6, cinchonace\u00e6, and conifer\u00e6, all deserve mention. There are some which appear unusually scarce, as tropical endogen\u00e6, orchidace\u00e6, amygdale\u00e6, and the cryptogamic families generally, particu larly fungi. The arborescent vegetation is chiefly supplied by quer cus, of which there are most probably many species. Pinus, also, with several species, one of which descends to 22\u00b0 N. lat, thuja, cunninghamia, podocarpus, juniperus, acer, morus, sterculia, melia, ficus, magnolia, laurus, and bambusa. The shrubs are considerably more numerous: ilex, olea, rhododendron, rhus, rubus, azalea, rosa, spir\u00e6a, camellia, gardenia, canthiuin, itea, myrtus, eugenia, vibur-"], [910, "428 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. num, photinia, raphiolepis, prmos, triphasia, murraya, gly cosmis, pittosporum, melastoma, bauhinia, chloranthus, olea, jasminum, diospyros, and hibiscus. Among the plants of a more fugitive existence are malva tricuspidata, kalanchoe spathulata, clematis hedysarifolia, drosera loureirii, sida rhombifolia, indigofera hirsuta, crotalaria retusa, c. vachellii, abrus precatorius, mesembryanthemum cordifolium, torilis japonica, paratropia cantoniensis, with species of hypericum, polygonum, chenopodium, salvia, chrysanthemum, aster, gnaphalium, and grangea. Cyanus nelumbo and trapa bicornis are plentiful on the canals and quiet waters. Viscum ovalifolium is found in the neigh bourhood of Canton : and another parasite, cassythis fili formis, festoons the shrubs with its sickly branchlets. The geographical range of the latter is extensive, stretching as it, does from the Cape of Good Hope in 18\", E. long., to China, the Indian islands, and across the Pacific Ocean to 140\u00b0, W. long., or nearly two-thirds round the globe. In a statistical view, the number of species in the flora appears to be small in proportion to the leading groups re presented, as they stand in about the following numerical relations : families 5, genera 13, species 16, giving some thing more than three species to each family. Some of the cultivated or more remarkable plants are worthy of notice, and the tea shrub is naturally the most prominent The numerous varieties known in commerce are equally produceable from the two species, thea bohea and t viridis, the difference depending on soil, culture, the age of the leaf, and the manufacture. It is a handsome shrub, with fragrant white (yellow, Davis) flowers, preferring the sides of the hills and a poor soil. Green tea is chiefly produced in Kiang-nan, between 29\u00b0 and 31\u00b0 N. lat. ; black tea in Fohkien, between 27\u00b0 and 28\u00b0 N. lat. The favourite soil is a decomposed granite mixed with feltspar, and which"], [911, "THE CHINA REGION. 429 is used in the manufacture of the elegant porcelain in which the infusion is drank. One portion of the world, as the English and others, pronounce it tea ; the other portion, as the Portuguese and Spaniards, cha. Both words are Chinese, but the former is the dialect of Amoy, and the latter of Canton. The range of the indigenous shrub is perhaps as far as 45\u00b0 N. lat. The sugar-cane is cultivated to 30\u00b0 N. lat. ; but its productiveness is probably not great. The banana is abundant about Canton, but the fruit re quires to be protected by a covering of the dry leaves\u2014 a practice I never observed elsewhere. It is far from attaining perfection, the saccharine qualities seeming to form after the fruit has been gathered, and when it is becoming almost rotten. Rice is most extensively cultivated throughout the empire, and is really the staff of hfe. The seeds of stil lingia sebifera are surrounded by a substance resembling, and having the same use as, tallow. Ligustrum lucidum yields from its berries a wax. A branch of olea fragrans is the reward of literary attainments, Camellia oleifera and other species contain oil in their seeds, which is easily ex pressed, and is sold at Canton under the name of tea oil, for all common purposes. \u00c6schynomene paludosa was for some time supposed to produce the rice paper of China ; the proper plant, however, is still a desideratum. This plant is also a native of China, as well as India, where it is called shola, and has its uses. The fruits more particu larly Chiuese are the loquat, litchi, longan, flat peach, man darin orange, red lime, and fingered shaddock. Relations. \u2014 The entireness of its flora may be sought in the peculiarity of the vegetation when compared with the latitude, and in the sources of resemblance it has with distant regions, as with the Iroquois Region through mag nolia, juglans, prinos, and ilex ; with the California Region in general aspect and habit, and in the prevalence of rham-"], [912, "430 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. ne\u00e6; and with several distant regions through pimis, quercus, acer, rhus, rhododendron, azalea, myrtus, lonicera, rubus, &e. Few of these plants connecting it elsewhere are shared with neighbouring regions, if we make some ex ception in favour of Japan : but of its more tropical species many occur equally in the various parts of India and the Malay islands. Through paliurus, diospyros, olea, and tamarix, we are reminded of Asia Minor. Species of euphorbia partially replace the cacte\u00e6 of the New World. XXXVIII.\u2014 THE BIRMAH REGION. Extent. \u2014 At present we separate this region rather be cause it has not the features of the neighbouring regions, than from any known peculiar characters of its own, since so little is known concerning it. It embraces a large por tion of country extending south from the Himma-leh mountains, between the Ganges on one side, and the Gulf of Tonquin on the other, with the exception of the Malacca peninsula, which belongs to the Malaisia Region ; including thus the kingdoms of Birmah, Siam, and Cochin China. Physical Characters. \u2014 The interior is little known. The country would appear productive, and is watered by several large rivers. Climate. \u2014 Tropical, but apparently without those ex tremes of temperature so frequent in the China Region. Flora. \u2014 Botanists have hitherto made very slight in roads. Loureiro has given us a fragment of the vegetation of Cochin China. Aurantiace\u00e6 seem to be nearly as fre quent as in the China Region, and there are several of the most tropical plants in common, but a nearly complete ab sence of those of more temperate latitudes, which so abound"], [913, "431 THE MALAISIA REGION. there. In Assam the tea plant has been found in abundance, and the leaves have been since manufactured and exported to England. Some of the species of Blume's Flora Jav\u00e6 occur here, and perhaps also of other of the Malay islands. Rela i ions. \u2014 Unknown. XXXIX\u2014 THE MALAISIA REGION. Extent.\u2014 The numerous islands of the Indian Ocean, of which Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Celebes, the Phillipines, Flores, and Timor, are the most extensive. The Moluccas are not included, as they belong to the New Guinea Region ; the peninsula of Malacca, however, forms an im portant part of this region. Physical Characters Bold scenery and lofty moun tains are especially characteristic of these islands, and ex tensive traces of volcanic action are in many places appa rent They are generally distinguished for their rich soil and fertility, the latter due to a moist atmosphere, frequent heavy rains, and the constant influence of a hot sun. Though some of the mountains are extremely lofty, they rarely attain the elevation of perpetual snows. Climate. \u2014 The equator traverses the region, and pro duces a difference in the distribution of the seasons in the islands somewhat removed from it. Those to the north have their wet seasons from May to September or October, being nearly the same as our summer. To the south, the rains commence in October and cease about April. At the equator, the distinction of these seasons is less decided, the different parts of the year being very similar. The range of temperature is very small in the year or during the day. The thermometer generally stands at 86\u00b0 to 90\u00b0."], [914, "432 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION*. The rains are very heavy, and the air is usually laden with moisture. Flora. \u2014 With few exceptions, the whole of the islands are covered with forest, which is particularly exposed to that rapid growth and decay consequent on a humid and warm atmosphere. It is rich in species, and distinguished as the source of some of those remarkable for their aromatic or luscious qualities, and which might be easily diffused throughout the region. In many respects they are the same as those of the Indian regions, with such differences as depend on climate. Leguminos\u00e6, malvace\u00e6, and some others, are therefore not proportionately numerous. Java is a rich and fruitful island. Its forests are filled with cinchonace\u00e6, which abound here in astonishing num bers, and which would seem to be the spot of greatest inten sity of the family. Hydrocere\u00e6, having only a solitary species, is confined to the island. The curious rafflesia and the famous antiaris toxic-aria are indigenous. On the ele vated lands of the interior quercus and other genera -of a temperate climate are encountered. Sumatra and Malacca, like Java, are covered with forests, supporting or sheltering a luxuriant vegetation, among which orchidace\u00e6, ferns, and climbers, are very numerous -, and the dead wood is often invested with lichens of gloomy colours. Celebes has an estimated superficies of 70,000 square miles. The forest vegetation is thinner than elsewhere, and the surface often very rocky. The neighbouring island of Borneo, however, has the usual vast compact forest, in which the dry obalanops cam phora is conspicuous, and where at present it is confined. Timor is distinguished for its sandalwood forests, but santalum is probably diffused over all the islands. The Phillipines, though nominally belonging for so long"], [915, "433 THE HINDOSTAN REGION. a time to the Spaniards, are really in possession of the natives, and sealed against Europeans ; they are, therefore, little known. Some of the tropical plants of the China Region are found here, and the seasons are directly the re verse of those in the southern islands. From these and some other reasons, they may, perhaps, deserve to be con sidered as a distinct region. Relations. \u2014 In the circumstances of the climate, and in some of the more prominent productions, there is a clear resemblance with some parts of the Oronoco Region. In the superior prevalence of cinchonace\u00e6 in both, this is par ticularly manifest. With the Indian Regions there is much in common, aird tectona grandis and other trees abound in the forest of Java, though dipterocarpe\u00e6 belongs chiefly to the islands. XL.\u2014 THE HINDOSTAN REGION. Extent. \u2014 Vast research has been already devoted to the immense flora of intertropical Asia, but the results rather make us acquainted with detached portions, than convey a -general view of the whole. Thus there are extensive dis tricts hitherto unexamined, and of which we consequently know nothing. A difficulty, therefore, exists, amounting in some cases to an impossibility, of defining its regional vegetation. However, there are important points of dif ference between the portion known as Hindostan and that comprehending Birmah and Cochin-China, and for the pre sent we will regard the Ganges as an arbitrary line of dis tinction. To the north are the Himma-leh Mountains, and to the west the region probably crosses the Indus to the Solyman range. Physical Characters.\u2014 Great diversity of character is VOL. II. F F"], [916, "434 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. visible over this extensive surface. In the neighbourhood of the rivers, particularly that of the Ganges, the surface is an extensive alluvial plain, where a hillock would be a a novelty. In other parts, a number of secondary moun tain chains traverse the country, and give rise to many rivers and streams which carry fertility through their course. These elevations are often extremely bold and rocky, and are sufficiently great to affect the vegetation and climate. On the whole the soil is fruitful, and in some places eminently productive ; in others there are occasional sandy or rocky districts. Climate. \u2014 The seasons are tropical, with perhaps a greater range of temperature than is customary for the lati tude. At Calcutta the mean heat is 79o 4, and the tempe rature sometimes falls to 63\u00b0 ; at Madras the mean is 84\u00b0 4, and at Bombay 81\u00b0 9. The quantity of rain has been esti mated at Calcutta to be 81 inches annually, and at Bombay 82 inches. In the Nhilgerries, where the elevation in fluences the climate, the mean of the year at Serloo, elevated 3,500 feet, is 70\u00b0; at Jackanary, 5,000 feet, 60\u00b0; and at Ootacamund, 8,500 feet 56\" 6. At the latter, the average fall of rain is about 64 inches. Flora. \u2014 The magnificent vegetation of this region pre sents all that is rich and beautiful, and such as can be expected within the tropics. The extensive forests con tain a great variety of trees, often of surpassing magnitude ; and frequently the number of individuals is very great, as in the saul forests which skirt the base of the Himma-leh Mountains, and sometimes in the assemblage of palms in situations suited to their growth. We have only room to state, that the mass of the vegetation is derived from the following natural families : araliace\u00e6, nelumbone\u00e6, cap paride\u00e6, flacourtiane\u00e6, anonace\u00e6, myristice\u00e6, dilleniace\u00e6, laurine\u00e6, menisperme\u00e6, sterculiace\u00e6 and dombeyace\u00e6, 6"], [917, "435 THE HINDOSTAN REGION. sections of sterculiace\u00e6, moringe\u00e6, el\u00e6ocarpe\u00e6, salicari\u00e6, myrtace\u00e6, combretace\u00e6, santalace\u00e6, olacine\u00e6, leguminos\u00e6, urtice\u00e6, artocarpe\u00e6, euphorbiace\u00e6, celastrine\u00e6, rhamne\u00e6, sapindace\u00e6, vites, meliace\u00e6, cedrele\u00e6, aurantiace\u00e6, conna race\u00e6, amyride\u00e6, burserace\u00e6, anacardiace\u00e6, ochnace\u00e6, balsamine\u00e6, bignoniace\u00e6, piperace\u00e6, cucurbitace\u00e6, cin chonace\u00e6, loranthace\u00e6, loganiace\u00e6, asclepiade\u00e6, myrsine\u00e6, cyrtandrace\u00e6, begoniace\u00e6, cycade\u00e6, commeline\u00e6, scitami ne\u00e6, smilace\u00e6, pandane\u00e6, and aroide\u00e6. \u2014 (Greville.) Many of these families, however, are more copiously re presented elsewhere, aud some are but rarely seen. The families strictly confined to India are few, as memecyle\u00e6, alangie\u00e6, aquilarine\u00e6, stilagine\u00e6, and some of these even may be disputed. Ceylon is estimated to contain 24,660 square miles, and its highest point attains 8,280 feet. The climate varies much in temperature and fall of rain in different parts. At Colombo the annual range is from 76\u00b0 to 87\u00b0, and the fall of rain from 75 to 80 inches. The vegetation is similar to the continental, and the elevation of surface is friendly to the existence of a somewhat altered vegetation, mixed with a few genera of temperate latitudes. Relations. \u2014 There is so much similarity in the con trolling influences within the tropics of the different conti nents, that we are not surprised to find them approaching each other in the general characters of their vegetation. This is not only visible in the more bulky tropical families, as combretace\u00e6, melastomace\u00e6, piperace\u00e6, cinchonace\u00e6, and celastrine\u00e6; but in the inconsiderable groups of peda line\u00e6, olacine\u00e6, ochnace\u00e6, samyde\u00e6, hippocrateace\u00e6, and homaline\u00e6. In some instances, where the relations are less intimate, a compensation seems attempted, as in the pre sence of cyrtandrace\u00e6 for the gesnere\u00e6 of intertropical America. Whilst America presents some affinities with F F 2"], [918, "436 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. New Holland, they are rarer in Asia, a circumstance per haps due to geographical position. Several genera are shared with the China Region, the most remarkable being nepenthes. Cyrtandra is numerously represented in the Sandwich Islands. XLI.\u2014 THE HIMMA-LEH REGION. Extent. \u2014 This is probably the most interesting alpine region in the world, as some allowances are necessary for the charm with which Humboldt has invested the Andes. The novelty of his researches ensured an early and lasting impression on the minds of scientific men, and the wide re putation which ensued has so overshadowed the subject elsewhere, that all other mountain chains have been re duced to almost a secondary importance. The names of a few Englishmen have recently become associated with the examination of the natural features and productions of the Himma-leh Mountains, and the obscurity in which they were long buried has been considerably removed. This gigantic mass of mountains traverses a great portion of Asia from east to west in a somewhat devious line between 25o 20' and 31\u00b0 N. lat, and 75\u00b0 and 95\" E. long. In accord ance with our views of the extent of an alpine flora, this region commences at the spot where the lowland cultivation ceases, and which, in different aspects and situations, varies, to an important extent, between 3,200 and 4,400 feet. Above this are the four permanent belts of an alpine flora. Von Buch is disposed to think there is room for another region towards the limit of vegetation, but I do not deem it advisable to distinguish further in the alpine regions. Physical Characters. \u2014 The Himma-leh Mountains"], [919, "437 THE HIMMA-LEH REGION. are not a solitary chain, but are composed of many heaped against each other, of varied outline and elevation, and containing within them numerous defiles, valleys, plains, and every other disposition of surface liable to occur, 3rd materially influencing the climate and vegetable produc tions. In many of these situations is collected a rich soil and all the appliances of great fertility. Their geological structure presents numerous rocks ; approaching the chain from the south, sandstone first appears, distinctly stratified and containing strata of lignite ; to these succeed various kinds of slaty rocks, imbedding quartz, limestone, and horn blende ; lastly, gneiss appears in vast quantities, traversed by veins of granite, and imbedding garnets, schorl, hyacinth, and native gold. Animal remains occur in considerable quantities in some places, consisting of marine shells, fish, and the bones of animals. The breadth of the region varies between 250 and 350 miles, but the extent of surface geographically furnishes no correct estimate of the rea] superficies. The snow-line fluctuates according to the cir cumstances of the locality, but may be generally stated at from 14,000 to 16,000 feet, and is always higher on the northern flanks. Among the loftiest peaks are Javaher, at taining 25,800 feet ; Dhawalagiri, 28,500 feet ; and Chu.. mularee, 29,000 feet ; but vegetation has ceased long before. Climate. \u2014 Whilst the region possesses the evenness of temperature, brilliancy of atmosphere, and other attendants of alpine situations, the climate is greatly affected by aspect, and the mean heat, range, and distribution of moisture dif fer on its northern and southern flanks. Flora. \u2014 Nature has enriched this magnificent range of mountains with a varied and abundant vegetation. It is singular, that some of the genera that do not usually pro duce trees, have species here which attain a considerable"], [920, "438 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. bulk, asjuniperus,salix,ligustrum, rubus, and rhododendron. Though the range of its alpine regions varies considerably with aspect, the very brief notice we must here take of them will be found generally correct. 1. The Region of Loivland Cultivation extends to 3,200 or 4,400 feet. This correctly does not belong to the Himma leh Region, but to that embracing the plains of Hindostan. Tropical productions prevail, as scitamine\u00e6, epiphytic orchidace\u00e6, numerous tropical forest trees, the sugar-cane, pine-apple, mango, banana, and bamboo. 2. The Region of Woods extends to 11,000 feet. The vegetation is dense and luxuriant ; the more conspicuous genera are laurus, quercus, pinus, ilex, magnolia, gordonia, prunus, pyrus, fraxinus, michelia, podocarpus, morus, ulmus, berberis, and populus. 3. The Region of Shrubs extends to 12 or 13,000 feet. Many of the genera of the last region enter this, but when of arborescent habit they universally become stunted and dwarf; salix, vaccinium, betula, juniperus, taxus, cupressus, stunted species of quercus and pinus, viburnum, lonicera, rhododendron, rubus, ribes, rosa, and ulex. Among her baceous plants are potentilla, fragaria, gentiana, viola, saxi fraga, salvia, dracocephalum, plectranthus, ranunculus, polyanthus, primula, antennaria, ageratum, sida, and gera nium. 4. The Region of Grasses extends to 14,600 feet It abounds in natural pasture land. 5. The Region of Cryptogamic Plants extends to the line of perpetual snow. Lichens and mosses prevail of identical genera, and also to a great extent, species, with the high latitudes of Europe. Relations. \u2014 As we increase the height above the plains, the affinities with the neighbouring regions become less distinct, and others are established with distant latitudes"], [921, "THE SPAIN REGION. 439 and other mountain ranges. They soon become very inti mate with the Alps and Pyrenees, and even with the Altai and Andes. Genera common to both are represented by similar species, and sometimes one tree or shrub seems to occupy the place of another ; thus, abies dumosa replaces the pinus pumila of Europe. There are a few species identical with Europe, as hedera helix, rosa canina, r. spinosissima, and salix babylonica. (Levant.) American affinities are recognized in magnolia, juglans, careya, age ratum, photinia, and osmorhiza. XLII.\u2014 THE SPAIN REGION. Extent. \u2014 Spain and Portugal, with so much of the mountain chains and southern side of the Pyrenees as is devoted to the cultivation of the plains ; and the islands of Minorca, Majorca, and Loica. Physical Characters. \u2014 The European peninsula is traversed in all directions by numerous mountain ranges, often of the most forbidding sterility. Nor are the features of the intervening plains frequently much improved by any important accession to the vegetation. The most promising verdure will usually be found collected in the valleys, or along the courses of rivers and streams, and in some of the most fertile lower plains. The different provinces present some variety in this respect. Climate. \u2014 The summers are warm, and the winters mild. Some parts are generally dry and severe throughout the year ; but the northern parts, with a milder climate, are liable to much rain and heavy weather. Flora. \u2014 The vegetation everywhere is characterized by the evergreen oaks ; the habit, mode of growth, and foliage of which are peculiar. These consist of several species,"], [922, "440 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. some of which are at present imperfectly defined. Among them quercus suber is distinguished as composing large woods; and q. ilex and q. tanzin are abundant. Entire woods of these trees are frequent in Aragon, Catalonia, the Castilles, Estremadura, Andalusia, Valencia, and Mur cia. Quercus valentina of Cavanailles is seen in the eastern part of Valencia and other parts of the south. Q. australis of Link, a fine species, is associated with q. suber near Gibraltar. Q. fastigiata is found on the flanks of the Pyrenees. Of the deciduous kinds q. rubur is very abun dant in the northern provinces, not existing in the central. Sometimes q. pubescens accompanies it. Q. coccifera prefers the south, where it abounds extensively, and ex tends as far north as the centre of Spain. Q. \u00e6gilops is met with in the Sierra Morena. Captain Cook, in his Sketches in Spain, regards the vegetation as conveniently distributed into three divisions. The first division comprehends Gahcia, Asturias, the Basque provinces, Upper Navarre, and the maritime parts of Old Castile. It is distinguished for the humidity of the atmosphere, equable temperature, its pastures, verdure, and luxuriant vegetation. It produces little or no oil, wine of an inferior quality, but much valuable timber. Quercus robur, q. ilex, menziesia daboeci, pteris aquilina, ulex stricta, u. europea, are chiefly characteristic. The second division includes the Castiles, Estremadura, Aragon, part of Catalonia, and the upper portions of Valencia, Murcia, and Andalusia. The climate is remarkable for its dryness. In some parts the olive is abundant ; and Aragon is famous for its large pine forests. Quercus ilex, q. tauzin, q. prasina, and numerous cistus and helianthemum prevail. The third division occupies the shores of the Mediterranean, the western coast of Andalusia, and the valley of the Guadelquivir, as far as Cordova. The sum- 7"], [923, "441 THE SPAIN REGION. mers are hot and dry, and the winters mild. Syngenesious plants are abundant, as are also cistine\u00e6 and iride\u00e6 ; and the sugar-cane, cotton, rice, sweet potato, lemon, orange, fig, and pomegranate, may be all seen. It will be instructive to trace the vegetation south from the Bay of Biscay to Madrid, then south-east to the Me diterranean. In Asturias we are surrounded by quercus robur, castanea vesca, corylus avellana. The range of mountains may now be crossed, some parts of which about Puerto de Pajares attain from 8,000 to 9,000 feet. On the mountain sides here are fagus sylvatica and quercus prasina. About Valladolid is pinus pinea. The upper ranges of the Guadarrama are clothed with pinus sylvestris, and beneath it, at a somewhat less elevation, is quercus tauzin. Here, too, according to Captain Cook, is the southern boundary of the ash. After passing Madrid, pinus hale pensis is seen mingled with p. pinaster ; the former grows exclusively on the shore of the Mediterranean, and its northern European limit is 40\u00b0 20'. N. lat. at Sacedon. On the Sierra de Cuenca pinus sylvestris occurs for the last time, having hitherto tenaciously clothed every moun tain summit, and p. maritima, and p. halepensis conduct us to Valencia. Reseda is frequent, though it does not embrace the favourite of our gardens, which is a native of Egypt. Narcissus and similar plants are abundant in the spring vegetation, and among a multitude of others there are a few genera particularly deserving of mention as conspicuous in the flora; helianthemum, cistus, erica, teucrium, lavan dula, ulex, spartium, ononis, rosmarinus, cerinthe, anchusa, echium, passerina, nepeta, delphinium, &c. Of several families which have for a long time been re garded as densely clustered about the shores of the Me diterranean, cistine\u00e6 is found in the greatest intensity in"], [924, "442 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. the Spain Region ; labiat\u00e6 in the Asia Minor Region ; caryophylle\u00e6 in the Danube Region, but are nearly equally numerous in Asia Minor, proportionately few in Spain, and many species are indigenous to the north of Europe and Siberia. Boragine\u00e6 are perhaps most numerous in the Danube Region, though very abundant in Asia Minor ; less so more to the westward, but increase in the Canary Islands. And oleace\u00e6 are most prevalent in the Italy Region, though fraxinus has most of its species in North America. The Balearic Islands have a few peculiar plants. To Minorca are ascribed buxus balearica, arum crinitum, caprifolium implexum, ligusticum balearicum, rubia angus tifolia ; and to Majorca rubia lucida. Relations. \u2014 Several tropical plants have migrated to this region, and imparted distinct features, such as cha m\u00e6rops humilis, ph\u0153nix dactylifera, agave americana, opuntia vulgaris, and other cacte\u00e6. Its most decided pe culiarity, as an European region, is derived from the presence of many African species. Both these features are more strongly impressed in the south, and the scanty vegetation about Gibraltar is characterized by genista unifolia, spartium j unceum, teucrium valentinum, phlomis fruticosa, cham\u00e6rops humilis, and opuntia vulgaris. A collection of ph\u00e6nogamous plants made by Von Martius at Algesiras contained 143 species belonging to the south of Europe, 60 to temperate Europe, and 17 to Africa ; and of the whole number 58 were indigenous to Great Britain. A very interesting relation with the South Africa Region is displayed through erica, which has here several distinct species ; and indeed the prevalence of the genus in a portion of Europe is remarkable when we reflect what a broad barrier intervenes, how truly a cape genus it is, and how very sparingly it is* diffused elsewhere, even"], [925, "443 THE ITALY REGION. when the climate and circumstances seem favourable, the whole of the two Americas not offering a single species. More relations with the same region may be traced through passerina and others. XLIIL\u2014 THE ITALY REGION. Extent. \u2014 Italy, to the south of the Alps, that portion of France south of the Cevennes, and Sicily, Malta, Corsica, and Sardinia. Physical Characters. \u2014 Those who have entered Italy from the north by way of the Alps, have been always im pressed by the sudden change and interesting character of the vegetation. The north of Italy is eminently fruitful, and in the Milanese the soil, aided by irrigation, yields four crops of grass in the year. This is the country of the Parmesan cheese. Prolonged irrigation destroys the grass, and a rotation of crops is conducted. The sluices are shut, and the soil subjected to courses of hemp, leguminous plants, oats, wheat and maize, for five years. After this, grasses accumulate, and are assisted by irrigation, usually for fifteen years. The territory about Genoa is rocky and unproductive, and much of the south is in the same condition, and some parts almost too unhealthy to cultivate. In Sicily, the lava fields are planted with cactus, which after thirty years become fitted for cultivation. Climate. \u2014 Generally the seasons are warm and even, and the temperature rarely below 32\u00b0, but in some places, as at Naples, they are liable to extremes. At Rome the mean temperature is 59\u00b0 5, of winter 45\u00b0 8, of summer 75\u00b0 2 ; at Toulon the mean is 62\u00b0, of winter 48\u00b0 4, of summer 74\u00b0 8, and at Hieres, in the neighbourhood, the orange ceases"], [926, "444 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. to grow ; at Palermo, in Sicily, the annual mean is 65\u00b0, and the range, in twenty years observations, from 105\" to 34\u00b0, or seventy- one degrees ; the number of rainy days is only 65, and the fall of rain 21 '1 inches; the cotton plant, banana, and sugar-cane all repay cultivation. The amount of rain and rainy days varies somewhat ; in Provence the number of rainy days is only 67, in Florence 103, fall of rain 31*6 ; in Rome, rainy days 117, fall of rain 39 inches, but at Tolluezzo in Fruili, and at Carfagnano in the Apennines, the amount is said to be respectively 82 and 92 inches. More rain falls to the west than to the east of the Apen- nines. Flora. -As an European region, it is distinguished by the open character of its vegetation, the dry juiceless ever green foliage, absence of real forest, and the mixture of tropical and sub-tropical forms. The olive, myrtle, fig, vine, and pomegranate, abound everywhere. Several of its grasses are peculiar, and some attain a large size, as arundo donax. In a climate like that of Italy, there will be a very considerable difference in the vegetation of the sea sons, and the warm rains of spring are especially favour able to the presence of asphodele\u00e6 and similar plants ; ornithogalum, muscari, erythronium, ixia, bulbocodium, anemone, adonis, clematis, ranunculus, fedia, lotus, medi cago, bellis, chrysanthemum, are now numerous; the more permanent vegetation is derived from certain species of quercus and pinus, acer, pseudo-platanus, diospyros lotus, paliurus australis, morus nigra, celtis australis, capparis spinosa, acanthus mollis, plumbago europea, erythrina corallodendron, smilax aspera, cassia italica, phyllyrea, hibiscus, erica, cistus, buxus, pistacia, oinus, numerous boragine\u00e6, labiat\u00e6, scrophularine\u00e6, solane\u00e6, and mal vace\u00e6. Sicily has a flora extremely similar to Italy, and with"], [927, "THE DANUBE REGION. 445 very few peculiarities. In the introduced plants there is a greater resemblance to the tropics. Malta, from its situation, may be supposed to have more African plants than Sicily. Its total flora is about 200 species, nearly the whole of which it is likely have migrated here. Spix and Von Martius collected 150 kinds, of which 56 were common with Germany, 90 with the south of Europe, and only 4 with the neighbouring coast of Africa. It may have a few plants of its own, as fungus melitensis, yucca tenuifolia, and ricinus armatus. Corsica offers a few peculiar plants, and the summits of the hills are covered with pinus laricio. Sardinia has supplied us with common parsley, petro selinum sativum, but it is not limited to the island. Relations. \u2014 In many respects this is a parallel region with the Spain Region, for tropical features show themselves in both, but in the latter are more mixed with African. Labiat\u00e6, though numerous in both, are more abundant here. In the habit of the vegetation it corresponds in many respects with the Asia Minor, California, South Africa, and New South Wales Regions. The Cape of Good Hope genera of iride\u00e6, gladiolus, mor\u00e6a, trichonema, have each represen tatives here. Putoria calabrica, a cinchonaceous plant, is met with in the south. XLIV\u2014 THE DANUBE REGION. Extent. \u2014 That portion of Europe to the South of the Carpathians, and between the Adriatic andBlack Seas, and consisting of Hungary, the Turkish provinces in Europe, and Greece, much of which is fertilized by the Danube and its tributaries. The southern extreme of Greece is in many respects very similar to Asia Minor."], [928, "446 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. Physical Characters. \u2014 No part of Europe is superior in the capabilities of the soil, yet none has been rendered so little available. From some of the productions it would appear more favourable than any other portion of this quarter of the world, for the growth of several of the plants of warm latitudes. The far greater part is still covered by sorest and there are vast marshes where rice is extensively cultivated. Climate. \u2014 The summers are warm, and the winters not usually severe, but the temperature is liable to vicisi tudes. Flora. \u2014 The forest which abounds over much of this region, is composed of a little variety in its trees ; in Hungary, species of prunus enter largely into it, sometimes with multitudes of fraxinus rotundifolia ; whole forests of cherries and apricots are seen in Wallachia, and the elevated lands sustain large numbers of firs, oaks, pines, and beeches; daphne cretica and spartium parviflorum characterize the shores of Gallipoli ; the plum is everywhere cultivated in the greatest abundance, and is the source of a brandy called raky ; rhus cotinus abounds in Sclavonia and the neighbouring provinces ; and in the southern and south eastern states are large groves of the olive. Isatis tinctoria, or woad, exists in Hungary, and other species are indigenous; valeriana celtica, or spikenard, seems to prefer a certain elevation ; daphne, nerium, clematis, capparis, arbutus, amygdalus, populus, acer, asparagus, orobanche, antirrhinum, astragalus, pyrus, crat\u00e6gus, spir\u00e6a, gypsophila, thalictrum, helleborus, artemisia, chrysocoma, cnicus, carlina, kitaibelia, bubon, seseli, are all character istic. Quercus racemosa is confined to the south, and the melon and the vine are largely cultivated in Hungary. Relations. \u2014 In Spain the vegetation partakes of African features, and in this region of that of Central and"], [929, "447 THE ALPS REGION. Western Asia. If it here wants the picturesque beauty of Italy, it is also without the dry sapless aspect of its trees ; and the smiling circumscribed character of the vegetation is compensated by luxuriance and vigour. Those plants which like shelter, as certain ranunculace\u00e6 and ferns, are more abundant and for a similar reason crucife\u00e6 are pro portionately numerous. Mesembryanthemum has two or three species in Greece. XLV\u2014 THE ALPS REGION. Extent. \u2014 The elevated sides of the mountain chains in the south of Europe, above the line of lowland cultivation, to their summits, or the limits of the vegetation. The principal are the Pyrenees, the different portions of the Alps, the Carpathians, the Apennines, and Mount \u00c6tna. Physical Characters. \u2014 It comprises an extent of rug ged and bare mountains, but often sheltering within them rich moist valleys, and small verdant plains. Primitive rocks chiefly prevail, and sometimes with such steep scarped sides as to preclude the assemblage of soil and vegetation. In Mount \u00c6tna, and in some parts of the Alps, there are large fields of lava, which, after a certain period, become clothed with plants. Climate. \u2014 This will vary from temperate to frigid, ac cording to the elevation ; it is also liable to fluctuations, and to be disturbed by brisk winds and storms. The mean temperature of St. Gothard at 6,390 feet is 30\u00b0 4. On St. Bernard the fall of rain is 63 inches, which seems great for the latitude, since the mean of twenty places in the lower valleys of the Alps is 56* 5 inches. The mean temperature of \u00c6tna, at the base, is 64\u00b0."], [930, "448 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION Flora. \u2014 The vegetable productions of higher latitudes gradually appear as the elevation is increased. At first are seen thick forests of their trees, till by degrees they become dwarf and stunted, and are then succeeded by shrubs; after these come certain herbaceous plants, with a large proportion of grasses, large spaces covered with lichens, and lastly perpetual snows. The flowers of this region are often distinguished for the pureness and brilliancy of their colours. The characteristic plants are chiefly derived from gentiana, campanula, phyteuma, cher leria, androsace, primula, aretia, soldanella, ramonda, helleborus, aconitum, saxifraga, p\u0153onia, cytisus, and rho dodendron. The Pyrenees are situated between 42\u00b0 and 43\u00b0 N. lati tude, and some of the highest peaks attain from ten to twelve thousand feet The lower portions of both the north and south sides are covered with forests. The oaks on the north side, as quercus robur, q. tauzin, q. pubescens, q. fastigiata, but no evergreen species, these being con fined to the southern flanks, and the genus ceases at 3,260 feet. Pines now prevail, pinus sylvestris being sound on both sides, at its upper limits being mixed with p. unci nata, which soon after appears alone and closes in the trees at 7,800 feet. Rhododendron ferrugineum now grows in the valleys in vast quantities, with some northern shrubs. Some herbaceous species of cold climates with lichens soon after close in the vegetation among the perpetual snows, which commence at 8,950 feet. Abies communis and larix europea, have no existence here. The ever green oaks cease at the village of Andorra. Several of the alpine parts of the Spain Region belong here, as the Sierra Nevada in Granada, Sierra de Estrella in Portugal, Sierra de Cuenca, heights of the Guadarrama, and others."], [931, "449 THE ALPS REGION. The Alps stretch across, the south of Europe between 44\u00b0 and 48\u00b0 N. latitude, and present many greatly elevated peaks and ranges; Mont Blanc, the loftiest, attaining 15,730 feet. Their physical history and flora are scarcely of inferior interest to the Himma-leh mountains, but are far too extensive to be detailed here. The lowland cultivation ceases at about 2,000 feet, and is succeeded by forests of oak, chesnut, and pines, to 3,900 feet Betula alba, rho dodendron, and stunted spruce, reach 7,800 feet, salix her bacea extending something higher. The line of perpetual congelation is about 8,760 feet The Carpathian Mountains are situated in the east of Europe, between 45\u00b0 and 50\u00b0 N. lat There are also some lofty peaks within this range, detached from the general chain. Mount Lomnitz attains 8,436 feet, but the average height is something below this. The lowland cultivation ceases at 1,500 feet. The region of woods succeeds to 4,600 feet the lower part being chiefly occupied by the oak, birch, and particularly the fir. Next is the region of shrubs, and here also are a few stunted trees of pinus mughus, extending to 5,600 feet. And to these succeed a number of low alpine plants to 6,500 feet or the summits of the mountains. When the elevation is greater, the sur face is occupied by lichens to 8,000 feet, constituting the region of cryptogamic plants. Mount \u00c6tna is situated in 37\u00b0 43\u00b0 N. lat., and has an elevation of 11,360 feet. Observers differ as to the lines of vegetation. The lowland cultivation of the vine and maize ceases at from 2,200 to 3,300 feet. The orange, lemon, and lime attain 1,900 feet date 1,600, gossypium herbaceum 1,000, morus nigra 2,500, fig 2,200. The plants characteristic of the lava beds are andropogon hirtus, a. distachyos, lagurus ovatus, rumex scutatus, valeriana rubra, plumbago -europ ea, thymus nepeta, satureja greca VOL. II.

The region of woods extends to 6,500, the oak and chestnut ceasing at 4,350 feet, and pinus sylvestris at the limit of the region. The region of shrubs ceases at 8,f25 feet, and contains bushes of juni perus, berberis, betula, and fagus. The region of grasses ceases at 9,750 feet, and of cryptogamic plants at 10,000 feet. Relations. \u2014 Rhododendron, and some few others, carry our associations to the alpine regions of Asia and Ame rica, to lesser heights in China, and to some northern latitudes. Sempervivum abounds in species in the Ca naries, yet on \u00c6tna not a trace of it exists, but is replaced by sedum, which is equally numerous, but has no existence in the Canaries. XLVI.\u2014 THE CENTRAL EUROPE REGION. Extent. \u2014 That portion of the centre of Europe to the north of the southern chain of mountains is distinguished for a certain individuality in its vegetation, and the exten sive cultivation of wheat. The southern limit is bounded by the Alps and the Carpathians to the Caspian Sea, and the Pyrenees and the Cevennes, thus excluding a portion of the south of France. To the north it includes Den mark, and a part of the south extremes of Sweden and Norway, and is separated from the Volga Region by a line commencing in the Baltic on the coast in 55\u00b0 N. lat., and traversing the southern provinces of Russia to the sea of Azof. Its northern limit is in the vicinity of the"], [933, "THE CENTRAL EUROPE REGION. 451 boundary of acer, pseudo-platanus, morus nigra, populus alba, p. nigra, pyrus malus, the vine and the chestnut ; and the region generally may be regarded as that portion of Europe where wheat is most advantageously cultivated for food, to the north soon yielding to rye, and to the south to Indian corn and rice. Wheat is stated to be most pro fitably cultivated between 36\u00b0 and 50\u00b0 N. lat., and to cease entirely at 60\u00b0 or 62M The British islands complete the region. Physical Characters. \u2014 According to Balbi, the surface of Europe presents several remarkable geographical fea- tures. Its centre consists of an extensive plain of con- siderable productiveness, and to the north in Russia it rises to a broad table-land of about 1,150 feet of elevation. Another important table-land occupies the centre of Spain, having an elevation of 2,300 feet, that of the Jura Alps attains from 1,750 to 3,850 feet and another in Piedmont from 600 to 2,000 feet. But a far greater diversity is im- parted by the several mountain chains of the Pyrenees, the Alps, the Carpathians, the Apennines, and the Dofrines, which considerably modify the climate and the character of the vegetation. Besides there are several valleys which serve to guide certain rivers to the ocean, and which are pre-eminent both for their beauty and fertility. Of these the most distinguished are the valleys of the Lower Danube, the Rhine, the Drave, and the Po. Formerly, by far the greater portion of the surface was covered with forest, much of which has been gradually removed by cultivation, but very extensive tracts in Russia and Poland are still in this state, and throughout Europe generally a good deal of forest still remains. On the whole, the soil is good and fruitful, but there are spots consisting of little else than rocks, or where the occasional invasion of the sea renders it unserviceable, or where bog, morass, or heath exists, to G G 2"], [934, "452 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. the exclusion of cultivation, as in the countries south of the Baltic. Climate. \u2014 Malte-Brun and Balbi assign to Europe three well-defined climates ; the Atlantic distinguished for its even temperature, and its moisture ; the climate of the north-west of Europe being one of extremes of temperature : and the climate of the south, which, with its higher tempe rature, holds a middle station between the two others. Aware, however, that this division very imperfectly ex pressed all the important features, a further seven-fold one was proposed. Europe is so situated, between extensive seas on one side and a large mass of land and range of mountains on the other, that it cannot fail to be greatly governed by their influence over climate, and to offer some variety. Compared with other climates of a similar latitude, it will be found to be mild, less exposed to vicissitudes, and that vegetation attains a higher northern station. Between the west and east portions there are certain differences. The mean heat may be nearly the same through the same parallel, but the distribution in the seasons will be different. On the west side, the climate being equable, the range throughout the year is not great, and the mean of the summer and winter months will not be in excess ; the atmosphere is also moister, and the number of rainy days greater. On the east side, however, the mean of these two seasons is prone to extremes, and to take respectively higher and lower stations. Whatever differences occur in the mean heat of the year will be in favour of the eastern portions. The result of this on vegetation is, that plants which prefer a climate free from extremes, and that move with the mean temperature, will take a higher northern station on the eastern side, as is visible in some of the plants of Norway and Sweden, the apple for instance ; and those which revel in a hot summer, and are indifferent to"], [935, "THE CENTRAL EUROPE REGION. 453 the extremes of winter, will be found occupying a limit gradually extending towards the north-east In the Central Europe Region, the circumstances of the climate are less strongly marked. The mean varies from 48\u00b0 to 54\u00b0, and the usual annual range from 28\u00b0 to 83\u00b0. The atmosphere is often much loaded with moisture, and the rainy days are nearly half the total to the year, though the quantity of rain which falls does not exceed from 22 to 30 inches. The mean hydrometric state of the atmo sphere is four or six degrees below the mean temperature. In a climate so clouded, the power of the sun's rays over vegetation must be supposed to fall far short of their effects in lower and more brilliant latitudes. Flora. \u2014 The indigenous productions are those of a tem perate latitude. The climate holding a middle station, the plants of the south wander here, and those of the north do not find it ungenial ; it has thus a large proportion of species for the extent of surface, and the more important groups of plants are freely represented. The region will therefore display, with a number of species, also a number of genera and families, the proportions of the latter to the former bring greater than usual. In the forest trees, how ever, the number of species as compared with other regions is singularly small, and genera extensively represented else where have here often only solitary species. Nearly all have deciduous leaves, and though grasses have not an im portant numerical relation to the flora, they flourish in great luxuriance. These trees often manifest a partiality to par ticular soils, and in the forest, which clothes a larger por tion of Poland, the oak, yew, ash, poplar, chestnut, and willow, are found on the clayey soil, whilst the pine and the fir occupy exclusively the sandy soil. Inconspicuous flowers prevail greatly, as might be expected where amen taceous and coniferous plants are so numerous, but in other 4"], [936, "454 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. regions it is not unusual to have an intermixture of attrac tive flowers even in the trees, such as is not seen here. The details of the region may be sought for in ranuncu lace\u00e6, crucifer\u00e6, caryophylle\u00e6, geraniace\u00e6, saxifrage\u00e6, leguminos\u00e6, particularly the section vicie\u00e6, rosace\u00e6, stel late, composit\u00e6, boragine\u00e6, ericace\u00e6, gentiane\u00e6, labiate, scrophularine\u00e6, polygone\u00e6, chenopode\u00e6, the families of amentace\u00e6, orchidace\u00e6, junce\u00e6, cyperace\u00e6, gramine\u00e6, and a large proportion of the cryptogamic families. Umbellifer\u00e6 have a slight preponderance over other regions, as will be seen in their distribution. The total number of species is 1,009, but the duplicate habitats are here included. In the Central Europe Region there are represented 172 species ; Danube Region, 161; Italy Re gion, 152; Asia Minor Region, 90; Spain Region, 82; Barbary Region, 69; South Africa Region, 63; Iroquois Region, 61 ; Volga Region, 53; Siberia Region, 50; Chili and Peru Region, 45 ; New South Wales Region, 29 ; Pa raguay Region, 19; Patagonia Region, 10; other regions, 216. They are here found to exist in far greater numbers in the northern hemisphere, and particularly in Europe. In the latter they are most densely assembled in the cen tral, southern, and south-eastern portions, whence we may infer their partiality for a warm temperate climate, for warm summers and extremes in the seasons rather than the reverse, and lastly, for an atmosphere tolerably supplied with moisture. A few species cling to Western Europe along the shores of the Atlantic, and are not found in the eastern countries. Some have a partiality for elevated stations in the Pyrenees, Alps, Andes, and Mexican high lands, and the Asia Minor Region derives its species in great part from Caucasus. France is chiefly included in this region ; it has an area of 200,925 square miles, and 5,966 species ; or, in the pro portion of one species to about 34 square miles."], [937, "THE VOLGA REGION. 455 The British Isles are estimated to contain 110,181 square miles, and their total vegetation, omitting alg\u00e6 and fungi, is composed of 2,393 species, or one to every 46 square miles. These are distributed among 939 genera and 112 families. The value of the genus, or its average pro portion of species, is 3*7 ; of the family, or its proportion of genera, is 5*7 ; of the exogenous genus, 2*8 ; of the same family, 4*7; of the endogenous genus, 2-8; of the same family, 6*7; of the cryptogamic genus, 8*5: of the same family, 13. The flora has little to distinguish it from the continent of Europe. Ireland has 682 exogen\u00e6, 211 endogen\u00e6, and 41 ferns. Some plants are found there not indigenous to Great Britain, but generally occurring to the south of Europe ; as, arbutus unedo, menziesia polifolia, papaver nudicaule, sedum palustre, arenaria ciliata, saxifraga umbrosa, pin guicula grandiflora, trichomanes brevisetum, hookeria l\u00e6tevirens, and h. splanchnoides. The two last are quite peculiar. Relations. \u2014 Besides the close relations to neighbour ing regions, some interesting affinities exist with the dis tant Patagonia and Van Diemen's Land Regions. Com pared with its American parallel, the Iroquois Region, it fails greatly in variety, and particularly in the forest trees. XLVII. THE VOLGA REGION. Extent. \u2014 Russia, to the west of the Ural Mountains, and to the north of a line commencing at the fifty-fifth degree of latitude on the Baltic, and extending to the Sea of Azof; with the whole of Norway and Sweden, with"], [938, "456 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. the exception of a small portion of their southern ex tremes. Physical Characters. \u2014 Russia consists chiefly of an extensive plain of inconsiderable elevation, and dotted with numerous lakes and marshes, and Norway and Sweden are intersected by lofty mountains. Climate. \u2014 To the eastward the climate is one of ex tremes, the summers being hot and the winters long and severe. On some days the temperature is higher than is usual many degrees to the south. The western coun tries have a more even climate, but still a rigorous one. Flora. \u2014 The extensive and often magnificent forest, which covers nearly the whole of this region, is composed chiefly of pinus sylvestris, mingled with abies picea, and a. communis; and pinus cembra is met with towards the Ural Mountains. Though the species of pine are fewer here than in the south, the trees are of far finer growth; a circumstance that occurs also with the eucalyptus in Van Diemen's Land, where, though there are fewer spe cies, the trees grow much larger. Sheltered by the forest, a dense undergrowth flourishes, of species of vac cinium, andromeda, empetrum, rubus, salix, betula, and arctostaphylos. Conifera^, amentace\u00e6, saxifrage\u00e6, cruci fer\u00e6, and ranunculace\u00e6, are particularly prominent, and some members of umbellifer\u00e6, caryophylle\u00e6, and bora gine\u00e6, are mixed with the vegetation, but are rapidly disappearing. An English botanist visiting this region will find most of the northern plants of his own island, but will perhaps be more surprised to see what an altered character a vegetation of similar species assumes here ; for he will find many plants very common, which were rare at home, and others before regarded as common weeds are here prized. Senecio jocob\u00e6a, so frequent a nuisance in our meadows, is in Norway an object of diligent search. Several important plants have their northern limits in"], [939, "457 THE OCEAN REGION. this region. Quercus robur ceases at 61\u00b0, fraxinus excel sior 60\u00b0, fagus sylvatica 60\u00b0, prunus cerasus 57\u00b0\u2014 60\u00b0, tilia intermedia 63\u00b0, abies coinmunis 67\u00b0, populus alba and p. nigra 56\u00b0, pinus sylvestris 70\u00b0; the ash, alder, aspen, and juniper, in Norway, reach the arctic circle, or 67\u00b0, but cease near the Urals at 60\u00b0. Alpine vegetation can scarcely be supposed to exist in a region which possesses so many of its characters, and any attempts to give it prominence will be attended with very feeble results. In Lapland, between 66\u00b0 and 68\u00b0, accord ing to the statements of Wahlenberg, the Region of Trees attains 1,800 feet; the Region of Shrubs succeeds to 2,500 feet, and is closed in by lichens and perpetual snow at 3,300 feet. In Finmark, according to Von Buch, at 70\u00b0, pinus sylvestris grows to 730 feet ; betula, larix, and vaccinium, to 3,100 feet; then cryptogamic vegetation and perpetual snow at 3,300 feet. Relations. \u2014 The parallel regions in America are filled with forests of noble trees of abies instead of pinus, mixed with cupressus thyoides, and occasionally a pine, crategus, or fraxinus ; besides this there is much similarity in the vegetation. XLVIIL\u2014 THE OCEAN REGION. Extent. \u2014 The shores and shoal waters of the ocean through all latitudes, from high-water mark to a depth at present uncertain, but which most probably is incon siderable. Physical Characters. \u2014 The medium in which marine plants live may, in several ways, affect the functions of those which select it for their habitation. The influence of the atmosphere is nearly excluded ; and light, even at"], [940, "458 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. small depths, is greatly obstructed. The saline constituents must be regarded as essential to their well being, though I have seen a fucus and a potamogeton growing together in water of a very slight degree of saltness. In many cases they evidently display a selection as to their place of attachment, and usually prefer mud or soft rocks to harder substances. They appear particularly scarce in coral islands, perhaps because the coral animal feeds on them. Climate. \u2014 The seasons aud temperature have a decided influence. In the summer months this flora is in great vigour, and when a season occurs eminently favourable to vegetation, it is proportionately affected. From their geographical distribution it may be inferred that these plants are sensible of small variations in the habitual tem perature. Within the tropics those living in shoal waters are surrounded by a temperature varying from 74\u00b0 to 86\". At greater depths the temperature gradually and evenly descends. A decrease, however, does not always happen. In 25\u00b0 N. lat, when the air was 67\u00b0 and the surface of the sea 69\u00b0, the temperature at 35 feet was 73\u00b0. The tem perature at the surface will generally be found to fluctuate about the mean of the latitude, but is liable to be disturbed by currents, as is the case with the gulf stream, which so modifies and warms the climate of the Bermudas. In high latitudes the surface may be sometimes below the mean temperature, and an increase occur for certain depths, but this will rarely exceed 42\u00b0 or 44\u00b0. Flora. \u2014 Notwithstanding the uniformity of the ocean, the facilities of diffusion, and simple organization of the vegetable beings which inhabit it, they will be found often remarkably circumscribed in their limits of growth. The same laws prevail as on the land, that there shall be every where variety, and that under similar circumstances in widely separated localities there shall be close relations."], [941, "459 THE OCEAN REGION. Looking over, then, this extensive region, the different deep inlets, gulfs, and seas, will each be found to have their own peculiar kinds, and sometimes in such numbers as almost to justify their exaltation into separate regions. It is said that the species found in the Red Sea are almost entirely different from those of the coast of Syria, though separated by so small a portion of land. In our own island rhodomenia cristata and odonthalia dentata are confined to the northern shores ; and fucus tuberculatus, laurencia tenuissima, rhodomenia jubata, rhodomela pinastroides, irid\u00e6a ensiformis, and others, to the southern. The flora of this region is entirely derived from the na tural family of alg\u00e6, but does not comprehend all its species, since many prefer fresh waters. Lamouroux has calculated that the total number of species may reach 5,000, or even 6,000. Fucus and laminaria exist in enor mous beds in the high latitudes of both hemispheres. Se veral species of sargassum replace the former within the tropics, where they are often densely crowded on the sur face, and generally in an active state of vegetation. Tam nophera, caulerpa, gelidium, amansia, and dictyote\u00e6 are chiefly tropical. Codium tomentosum is found in nearly all seas throughout the world. Macrocystis belongs to the southern hemisphere from the equator to 45\u00b0 S. lat , and durvillea and lessonia are likewise limited to this part of the world. Thaumasia ovalis, a remarkable plant, is found only at Ceylon. Cystoseira has several species on our own coasts, and others abound in the northern hemisphere, but a peculiar group is met with in New Holland, where, Gre ville remarks, it is as peculiar as the aphyllous acaci\u00e6 are on the land. Relations. \u2014 Between the terrestrial and marine vegeta tion the link is perfect and complete. Of the latter, the mass unquestionably find the waters of the ocean essential 10"], [942, "460 THE REGIONS OF VEGETATION. to their existence. Some, however, of closely allied organ ization prefer fresh or sweet waters ; and there are a few which live indifferently in both. With lichens, hepatic\u00e6, and fungi, they have much structural resemblance, and like them prefer cold climates, where they all flourish in greater numbers and luxuriance. Moisture also is necessary to the existence of them all, and the selection of certain lichens and fungi of old walls may be due to the saline sub stances to be found there, and which the marine plants re ceive from the ocean."], [943, "INDEX.
