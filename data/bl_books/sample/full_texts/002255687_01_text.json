I feel that some explanation is needed of the reasons which have induced me to step out of my province as a publisher,- and encroach on the domains of authors ; for, independently of a natural feeling, akin to jealousy, which either author or publisher must feel if one or the other attempt to combine the two vocations, it is clear that they cannot, as a general principle, be united with advantage. I trust, however, that authors will forgive me, and not re venge themselves by turning publishers. There is, nevertheless, some advantage in a publisher dabbling in literature, for it shows him the difficulties with which an author has to contend \u2014 the labour which is indispensable to produce a work which may be relied on \u2014 and it increases the sympathy which should, and which in these days does, exist between author and publisher. The circumstances which caused me to under take the laborious, but most agreeable, task of giving Lectures on the History of England, were these. A Society for the Improvement of the Labouring Classes was formed in 1855 in the small village of Chorley wood in Hertfordshire, the population of which was almost A 3"], [18, "PREFACE. VI entirely agricultural. After this Society had been established for a year or two, it was thought desirable that monthly evening Lectures should be delivered during the winter season. These were well attended, and, having given in 1857 a Lecture on Switzerland which seemed to interest my agricultural neighbours, I was requested by the incumbent of the district, the Kev. A. Scrivenor, to deliver a series of Lectures on the History of England. In an easy moment I promised to do so. I little thought, when I consented to this request, that I was undertaking a task which would require no ordinary perseverance to accomplish, and would occupy a lifetime of such leisure as I possess to bring to a conclusion. I thought that a few Lec tures, skimming lightly over the surface, touching on the main events only, and telling the workers of the soil what races had ruled over their forefathers, and what had been their general character, would suffice. No one thoroughly understands a subject until he tries to teach it to some one else ; and when, for .this purpose, I grappled with the History of England, studying it in a very different way to that in which, as a boy, I plodded through the dry abridgments, I became fas cinated with the subject. It laid hold of me and would not let me go ; and thus it was that I became entangled in authorship. The history I have given of the way in which I was induced to undertake these Lectures, will ex plain their deficiencies. I began by giving short ac counts of the various reigns, but, as I worked on, I became less and less satisfied with so brief a narrative,"], [19, "PREFACE. VII and could not refrain from entering into greater de tails ; and thus, while the sixteen years of King John's reign occupy only five pages, the thirty-five years of that of Edward I. occupy nearly one hundred. I now regret this disparity, for I feel that I have too briefly passed over several most important periods of our history, but I hope I am not now erring in an opposite direction. The first Lecture was printed nearly as it was delivered; the account of the division of England into shires, parishes, and so on, and of the origin and meaning of the names of places, was considerably added to, but, in the main, the Lecture was printed as delivered. The subsequent Lectures, however, have been carefully studied, and much increased in length, since I read them to my audience. Many matters which would not interest them, would, I thought, interest that more instructed public which I began to hope and believe I was addressing as readers in stead of listeners. The nature of the audience which I originally addressed rendered it necessary that I should en deavour to use plain and simple language, and to express my ideas clearly, for without this they could hardly have understood me, and would certainly not have taken an interest in the Lectures. In these efforts I trust I have succeeded. For the same reason I have tried throughout to give a narrative interest to the history, by relating events, as far as possible, in their natural order of time, and not, as a rule, separating any one series of events from A 4"], [20, "VIII PREFACE. the general thread of the history. To this system there are, of course, many exceptions ; but I have followed it to the best of my ability, believing that the sequence of events, and their dependence on each other, are thereby more clearly seen. When any par ticular subject, too, has specially interested me, I have followed it out at considerable and perhaps dispro portionate length, believing that those things which I myself felt a desire to understand fully, would be equally interesting to others. Thus, the origin of the laws and government of England, and of the courts in which those laws are administered, fasci nated me, and induced me to devote more than ordinary time and space to their elucidation. I have now said enough to explain why I have undertaken these Lectures, and the plan on which they are written ; and, in conclusion, I have only to thank my numerous friends, really too numerous to mention by name, for the kind and most valuable assistance they have given me in revising and cor recting them.

I shall, therefore, do my best to relate to you the History of England, from the earliest times till now, in such a way as will interest as well as instruct you. I shall try to avoid loading your minds with events of little importance, but I shall also try not to omit any which you ought to know. To tell everything would be impossible, but I hope to give you such a know ledge of the great events which have happened in England, as will help you to understand what was done by your forefathers.

I do not wish that you should rest idly contented, without trying or wishing to better yourselves. That is the last thing I should wish, and you will see that your fore fathers did not thus act. But when you learn that the comforts we now all of us enjoy every day, were quite unknown even to kings and nobles in old times, you will feel you have much to be thankful for. When you learn that the liberty we now possess was not won without many a fierce struggle, you will be proud of those noble men who gained for us the victory. You will learn, too, that it is only by slow degrees that we have improved ; and, therefore, while still struggling for improvement, you will not be impatient because there is no magician's wand to realise in one moment all that you desire. It is a glorious subject that I have in hand \u2014 The- History of England, the history of our own country. Who among you will not feel his heart glow in listen ing to such a theme ? Who among you is not proud of being an Englishman? Who among you does not wish to know the history of his forefathers? \u2014 the history of those men who have built up an empire on which, it is truly said, the sun never sets? an empire greater and more glorious than any which ever existed ; than any which now exists ; and which, if we only, each one and every one, strive mightily for that which is right, will (we may fairly hope) last as great and as glorious, or become even greater and more glorious, through ages yet to come.

I shall therefore tell you who they were from whom we received the earliest accounts of the in habitants of Britain, where those inhabitants came from, and what sort of people they were. The earliest reliable notice of these islands is written by a Greek historian, named Herodotus, who wrote about 2300 years ago, or more than 400 years before the birth of Christ ; and the part of Britain which he mentions is Cornwall and the Scilly Islands. He is unable, however, to say much about them ; he can tell us but little except of their existence. He says, \" Nor do I know anything of the Cassiterides (by which he means Cornwall and the Scilly Islands), from which we get tin.\" And he adds, \"I have never been able, with all my pains, to meet with any one who could tell me, from his own knowledge, that the farther parts of Europe are sea.\" From another Greek writer, named Strabo, who lived about 50 years after the birth of Christ, we learn that it was the Ph\u0153nicians who traded here for tin. The Ph\u0153nicians lived in Tyre and Sidon, and their trade is mentioned in many passages of the Old Testament. The Prophet Isaiah, when foretelling the downfall of Tyre, thus alludes (in chap, xxiii.) to the greatness of its trade: \u2014 \"The crowning city, whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the honourable of the earth.\" The Prophet Ezekiel especially mentions their trade in tin. In the twenty -seventh chapter it is written, \" Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multi tude of all kind of riches ; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in thy fairs.\" Strabo tells us B 2"], [42, "4 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OP ENGLAND. it was the Ph\u0153nicians who traded here, and he says that the inhabitants \"subsist by their cattle, leading for the most part a wandering life, and having metals of tin and lead. These and skins they barter with the merchants for earthenware and salt, and vessels of brass.\" A later writer describes their The Ph\u0153 nicians come for tin. mode of getting the tin. He says, \" They prepare the tin, and show much skill in working the earth which produces it. This being of a stony nature, and having earthy veins in every direction, they work their way into these veins, and so by means of water separate the fragments.\" Well, the Ph\u0153nicians traded here for tin, and they were very anxious to keep this trade to themselves. But the Romans followed their ships, and found out where the tin came from. Strabo says : \u2014 \" Formerly the Ph\u0153nicians alone carried on this traffic, conceal ing the passage from everyone ; and when the Romans followed a certain shipmaster, that they also might find the mart, the shipmaster purposely ran his vessel upon a shoal, and leading on those who followed him into the same fatal disaster, he himself escaped on fragments of his vessel.\" But nevertheless, after re peated efforts, the Romans discovered the passage; and, in the year 55 B.C., Julius C\u00e6sar, the first Ro man Emperor, invaded Britain, intending to make it a part of the Roman empire.

Cornwall and the Scilly Islands, and the inhabitants belonged to the race which we now call Celts. The Celts are believed to have been the earliest inhabi tants of the Western parts of Europe. They were probably the original inhabitants of the whole of England, and came here from France and Spain. But when C\u00e6sar came, the eastern and sea-coast generally was inhabited by Belgians, who had crossed over from what is now called Belgium, and from the north-west of France. Julius C\u00e6sar, who wrote an account of his invasion, says: \u2014 \" The inhabitants of the interior of Britain are said to be the original race ; but the sea coasts are inhabited by Belgians, who had settled there for purposes either of war or plunder.\" It is probable that these Belgians, in times long before we have any written histories of these islands, had driven the original inhabitants into the interior, into Wales, into Cornwall, and the West of England generally. The Welsh still speak the original lan guage. Not very long ago, Cornishmen spoke a lan guage which was nearly the same; and it is curious that the inhabitants of a part of the sea-coast of France, called Brittany, lying immediately opposite the British shore, still speak a language very like the old Cornish. Manners and Customs of the Ancient Britons. Julius C\u00e6sar, who, as I have told you, wrote an account of Britain, gives an interesting description of the manners and appearance of the people, from which you will see that they had made great advances since the time of the Ph\u0153nicians. He says : \u2014 \" The inha bitants of the interior do not sow grain, but live on milk and flesh, and clothe themselves in skins. All B 3"], [44, "6 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND. Chariots and horses, Agricul ture of the Britons. the Britons stain themselves with a plant called woad (a kind of cress plant, called in Latin Isatis), which produces a blue colour ; and this makes them appear more terrible in battle. They wear their hair long, and shave every other part of their body except the head and upper lip.\" The Britons had numbers of chariots and horses, and a Roman writer says, \" They fight not only on foot, and on horseback, but in chariots drawn by two and four horses. They are armed after the fashion of the Gauls, and have scythes fastened to the axles of their chariots.\" Julius C\u00e6sar says : \u2014 \" The mode of fighting from these chariots is peculiar : first, they gallop about in all directions, throwing their jave lins, and thus, by the alarm which the horses create, and the noise of the wheels in general, confuse the ranks of their enemies. After which, when they have got in among the troops of cavalry, they leap down from their chariots and fight on foot. By their daily habit of exercise they have acquired such skill, that in steep and precipitous ground they will stop their horses at speed, turn and guide them at will, run along the pole, stand on the yoke, and run back again at full speed into the chariot.\" Agriculture of the Ancient Britons. Another writer describes their cultivation of the soil: \u2014 \" Though the country abounds in milk, there are some among the natives who do not know how to make cheese ; and they are neither acquainted with the use of gardens, nor understand other branches of agriculture.

Their towns are on the hills, on the tops of which they enclose a large space with felled trees, and within this fence they make for them selves huts, composed mostly of reeds and logs, and sheds for their cattle.\" Religion of the Ancient Britons. Their religion was called Druidism, and their The priests were called Druids, from the Greek word Drus, which means an oak. The oak was considered a sacred tree, and the mistletoe which grew on the oak was held in especial reverence. The Druids taught the immortality of the soul, but they also taught the people to worship the sun, moon, and stars, and it was their custom to offer up human sacrifices. Numerous men, women, and children were inclosed in great idols of wicker-work, and then burned. There are many Druidical remains in England.

The Britons consequently knew of C\u00e6sar's coming, and prepared to defend themselves, and when C\u00e6sar reached the English coast, he found the cliffs covered with armed men. He therefore sailed for a part of the coast about seven miles further north, where the landing could be more easily managed, and he made an effort to disembark his troops near where Sandwich now stands. The Britons fought bravely, and it cost C\u00e6sar much hard fighting to land his troops. He did not, however, make much progress in conquering the in habitants; and therefore, when the Britons sent am bassadors to sue for peace, C\u00e6sar was very glad to grant it, and to return to France for the winter. The next year he came back, and landed at the same place as on his first invasion. He marched inland about twelve miles from the coast, and when he reached the river Stour, near where Canterbury now stands, the Britons attacked him, but were driven back to the woods. They retreated into one of their strongholds, a place surrounded by a mound and trench, every approach to which was blocked by felled trees. C\u00e6sar drove them out of this place, but was soon obliged to go back to his ships, which had suffered from a great storm. When he returned to the Britons' stronghold, he found it filled with a much larger force, commanded by Caswallon, or Cas sivelaunus, as the Romans called him. In the fio-ht ing which followed, sometimes the Romans had the best of it, and sometimes the Britons ; but at length the Britons were scattered, and C\u00e6sar crossed the Thames to attack Caswallon in his own territories."], [49, "11 CARACTACUS.

He never again invaded England, and for the next hundred years the Romans left this island quiet. About forty-three years after the birth of Christ, a.d. 43. the Roman emperor, Claudius, determined to con quer the island, and sent over a large army for this purpose. The Britons were led on by Caradoc, or Caractacus. Caractacus, but were conquered, and at last Carac tacus was taken prisoner, put in chains, and sent to Rome. The Romans were so touched with his noble manners and brav.e demeanour, that they at once struck off his chains. Notwithstanding all their success, the Romans Queen were very far from having conquered the country, and the Britons were not disposed to allow them to remain quiet ; they therefore took the field under the command of Queen Boadicea. A great battle was fought, near where St. Albans now stands ; the Britons were de feated, and Queen Boadicea killed herself in despair. But the Britons had other enemies beside the Ro- mans.

A.D. 420. What did theRomans do for us? London built. the Firth of Forth to the Firth of Clyde, or from Edinburgh to Glasgow. Those towns were not then built, but the line of the walls extended to the places where those towns now stand. The Romans remained in Britain about 400 years, when at length the Roman empire began to decay, and about the year 420, their troubles at home compelled them to leave England for ever. The Effects of the Roman Invasion. The dominion of the Romans was without doubt productive of much advantage to the Britons ; but it is certain that the Britons, although they did paint themselves blue, were not so savage as some writers describe them. They could not have tamed their horses, and made their chariots, without a consider able knowledge of mechanical arts, which places them far above the Hottentots, the Caffres, and others whom we now call savages. Nevertheless, the Bri tons made great advances during the dominion of the Romans. Very numerous towns were built, among which I may mention that London was founded during their sway ; and, indeed, the names of many towns over nearly the whole of England (such as Chester, Lancaster, Leicester, and all end ing in Chester, Caster, or Cester, which is derived from the Latin word Castra, meaning tents, a collection of tents, or an encampment), show us how widely and how firmly the Romans had planted themselves in England. In digging up the foundations of houses in London, the remains of Roman pavements and build ings are often found, and Roman weapons have been found in the River Thames.

Hawridge Common, only a few miles from this spot, and there are but few districts where Roman antiquities have not been found. Excellent roads were made from one end of the country to the other, traces of which still remain. One, called Watling Street, reached from Dover to London, and proceeded to the North of England, passing through St. Albans, which was then called Verula mium; and it is from this name that the Earl of Verulam takes his title. I mention this great road especially, because you will take an interest in it, from its connection with St. Albans. A very important event occurred during the stay of the Romans, viz. the conversion of the Britons to Christianity. It is uncertain by whom Christianity was introduced, and even the precise time is un known, but it is certain that, about the year 300 a.d., Christianity was firmly established in Britain. About that time British bishops attended a council in France ; and a few years previously, St. Alban, from whom St. Albans derives its name, suffered martyr dom as a Christian. During the sway of the Saxons, of which I shall soon have to speak, Christianity was nearly extinguished in the land, but the inhabitants of Britain were reconverted by St. Augustine, about the year a.d. 600, as I shall presently relate to you more fully. I cannot enumerate to you all the advantages we derived from the Romans ; but I must tell you that we derived also some disadvantages from their stay in England ; for with greater civilisation came greater luxury, and the Britons were less brave and less able to resist their enemies when the Romans left them, than when they came."], [52, "14 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND. The Saxons come over toEngland. ad. 429. Arrival of the Saxons. Another famous race now appeared, and began to ravage the coasts, \u2014 a race which is the foundation stone of our greatness \u2014 a race whose descendants have thriven, while the children of other races have decayed. I allude to the Saxons. They came as pirates, and they ravaged the land as robbers ; but they were bold freemen, they are our ancestors, and it is to them that we owe the energy, the perseverance, and the unconquerable determination that distinguish the English people. \"Where are now the Spaniards, who once ruled a large part of the Old World, and who discovered and ruled over a large part of the New? Sunk and degenerate, and all their greatness gone. What is the state of that gallant nation the French ? They, too, are sunk. Notwithstanding, or perhaps I should say, as a necessary consequence of the horrible scenes of wild revolution through which they have passed, they have, for the present at least, lost all the liberty they once possessed. What has been their success in peopling the earth? When the French have planted their foot on foreign soils, whether in America, in India, or in \" Afric's tor rid zone,\" never have they been able to found one flourishing colony. These are the descendants of the Celts. But what is the history of the Anglo-Saxons ? They have colonies in every clime ; they have de scendants in every quarter of the globe ; and, thank God ! they have preserved their freedom as vigorous as in the days of their old Saxon forefathers. The true old Saxon spirit is so well expressed in a poem by Mr. Kingsley, called an \" Ode to the North- East Wind,\" that I must read it to you :"], [53, "15 THE SAXONS. ODE TO THE NORTH-EAST WIND. Welcome, wild North-easter ! Shame it is to see Who can over-ride you ? Let the horses go ! Odes to every zephyr ; Ne'er a verse to thee.

O'er the Danish moorlands, From thy frozen home. Go ! and rest to-morrow, Hunting in your dreams, Tired we are of summer, Tired of gaudy glare, While our skates are ringing O'er the frozen streams. Let the luscious South-wind Breathe in lovers' sighs, Showers soft and steaming, Hot and breathless air. Tired of listless dreaming, Through the lazy day : While the lazy gallants Bask in ladies' eyes. Jovial wind of winter Turn us out to play ! What does he but soften Heart alike and pen ?

While on dreary moorlands But the black North-easter, Through the snow-storm Lonely curlew pipe.

Whatever calls forth his energy, that seems to the Saxon a source of happiness ; and the energy called forth by our varying climate, and by our cold north-easters, seems to me to be well described in the noble lines I have quoted. Where did the Saxons come from ? It was from the north-western parts of Germany and the frontiers of Denmark, and more especially from Sleswick, Holstein, and the north-western half of Hanover that these invaders came. They called themselves Angles, but by the Britons and Romans they were called Saxons. From the Angles, England derives its name of Angla-land, or England. The Saxons came from Denmark. Some of the Saxons established themselves in Surrey and Sussex, and formed the kingdom of South Seaxe, or the South Saxons ; others in Hampshire, Wiltshire, Dorsetshire, and Devonshire, and formed the king dom of West Seaxe, or the West Saxons ; and others, in Middlesex and Essex, formed the kingdom of East Seaxe, or the East Saxons. South Seaxe, or Sussex. West Seaxe, or Wessex. East Seaxe, or Essex. Others established themselves in Norfolk, Suffolk, and Cambridge, and formed the kingdom of East Anglia, which was divided into the North-folk, or people living in the North of Anglia, from whence the name Norfolk comes, and the South-folk, or people of the South, from whom the name of Suffolk comes. The settlers in the midland counties, Leices tershire, Warwickshire, &c, formed the kingdom of Mercia ; and to the north of the Humber they formed the kingdoms of Deira and Bernicia, after wards called Northumberland.

The races which have sprung from the mixture of these Angles, or Saxons, with the original inhabitants of these islands, are called Anglo-Saxons. Ethelbert, King of Kent.

D. 787, Ethelbert, King of Kent, there is but little that can be relied on. The Saxons had then been here about 150 years, and, being Pagans, they had done their best to root Christianity out of the land. But at that time St. Augustine came to England. He was sent over by Pope Gregory the Great, who had been struck by the beauty of some Britons sent to Pome as slaves. They came from that part of the country which was settled by the Angles. When the Pope heard they were called Angles, and that they were not Christians, he said they ought to be Angels not Angles, and in the year 597 he sent over St Augustine to con vert them. King Ethelbert received the missionaries kindly, and was converted to Christianity. Edwin, King of Northumberland, who had married King Ethelbert's daughter, Ethelburga, soon followed his example, and thus Christianity was again established in the land. The history of England for the next 200 years is a confused record of battles between the rulers of the various little kingdoms into which Eng land was divided, and which were called by the general name of the Heptarchy, or Seven Kingdoms. But about the year 827, Egbert, King of Wessex, having mastered the other kingdoms, made himself King of England, which was then for the first time so called. The other kingdoms still existed, it is true, but from this time they were all subordinate to the King of England. Invasion of the Danes. About this time there came another fierce race from the North, and ravaged the coasts as pirates. These were the Danes. According to the Saxon"], [57, "INVASION OF THE DANES. 19 Origin of Bury St. Edmunds. chronicle, they made their first appearance on the coast of Dorsetshire in the year 787, but they began to be more formidable enemies in Egbert's reign. The Danes were races of people inhabiting the coasts of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. They were consequently accustomed to the sea, so much so that they were called the Sea-kings, and they were continually engaged in piratical expeditions. In Egbert's reign they landed in the Isle of Sheppey, at the mouth of the Thames, plundered it, and then returned to their ships. During the reign of Egbert's son, Ethelwulf, and his grandsons Ethelbald, Ethel bert, Ethelred the First, and Alfred, the Danes ravaged the whole kingdom. In the year 870 they invaded East Anglia, and took up their winter quarters at Thetford. \" In that winter, Edmund, King of East Anglia, fought against them; and the Danes got the victory, and slew the king, and subdued all the land, and destroyed all the minsters they came to. The names of the chiefs who slew the king were Ingwair and Ubba. At that same time they came to Medeshamstede (Pe terborough), and burned and beat it down; slew abbot and monks, and all that they found there ; and that place, which before was full rich, they reduced to nothing.\" King Edmund was buried at the place where his body was found, since called Bury St. Edmund's; and many churches still exist dedicated to St. Edmund, king, and martyr. In the year 871 they were in possession of Read ing. The old Anglo-Saxon chronicler says : \" This year the army came to Reading in Wessex ; and three days after this two of their earls rode forth.

It is not known exactly where this hill is, but it is supposed to be near Wantage, and that the great White Horse cut in the chalk on the side of the hill is a commemoration of this battle. A White Horse is traditionally believed to have been the standard borne by Hengist and Horsa, the supposed first Saxon invaders, and is still the banner of the men of Kent. It is certain that this White Horse has existed for a very long time ; for in the time of Henry the First, between 700 and 800 years ago, the valley on the side of which the horse is cut was called the Vale of the White Horse. This White Horse has from time to time been cleaned of the grass, and this is called the Scouring of the White Horse, after which games and all sorts of merry-makings always take place. Latterly there have been very few of these scourings ; the last that took place was in 1857, the one next before it was in 1843. Reign of King Alfred. A.D. 871 to A. D. 901. When Alfred came to the throne, the Danes were in possession of nearly the whole of England except Somersetshire, Devonshire, and Cornwall.

King Al fred's con tests with the Danes warrior, he was also a wise legislator. He improved the laws of England, but, like all wise men, he made no uncalled-for changes. He kept what was good ; and what needed improvement, that he made better. Thus, at the end of his laws, he says : \" Then I, King Alfred, collected these things, and I ordered them to be written. And many things which my predecessors had held, and pleased me, I retained; and many which displeased me, I rejected, by the advice of my wise men, and commanded to be observed otherwise. But I was unwilling to put in much of my own, be cause we know not how far they may please posterity. But what I found existing in the days of King Ina, my kinsman, or of Offa, the King of the Mercians, or of \u00c6thelbryght (Ethelbert), who was the first baptized king in the nation of the Angles, whatever of these appeared to me more equitable, I collected, and rejected the rest. And I, Alfred, King of the West Saxons, showed these things to all my wise men, and they said, ' Let them be observed.' \" These were the words of a wise man. King Alfred greatly improved the education of his people, and he caused many books to be translated from the Latin into the Anglo-Saxon, which was the language spoken by the English in those days. Slavery was common in England at that time, and the labourers were nearly all slaves. King Alfred did his best to put down this slavery, but he did not succeed ; and it was many years before the English labourer became free, and was able to claim the pay ment of a fair day's wages for a fair day's work. Soon after Alfred came to the throne, he fought a great battle with the Danes at Wilton, in Wiltshire, and defeated them.

Armies traversed the country from the Thames to the Tweed, abiding in one place only till they had consumed its resources. The Northumbrians, says an old chronicler, became their harrowers and ploughers. The spirit of the West Saxons was at length worn out. The Danes, breaking through the Saxon lines of defence at Chip penham, overran the whole country, driving many into exile beyond the sea, and subduing the rest to their will. \" All,\" says the chronicler, \" but Alfred the King.\" He, unconquered, taking with him a few noble Saxons, established himself in the centre of a marsh, or morass, surrounded by bogs and forests, in a spot, in Somersetshire, still called the Isle of Athelney. There he remained for a time, seemingly forgotten, as well as deserted. He concealed himself on one occasion in the hut of a keeper of swine, and while the swineherd was out looking after his swine, Alfred was left to watch some cakes which were baking by the fire. The King had something else to think of beside looking after the cakes, and he let them burn. When the swineherd's wife came in she was angry; she did not know that the man who looked like a poor peasant, and whom she had charged to watch her cakes, was Alfred King of England, and she scolded him for his neglect.

He was always watching the Danes, and trying to find out their weakness. Once he disguised himself as a harper, and so got into the Danish camp. He found the Danes thought he was conquered, and that there fore they were eating and drinking and living a careless life of wild revelry. So Alfred issued from his hiding place, and his people flocked to his stand ard. Suddenly he fell upon the Danes, defeated them, and forced them to beg for peace. Guthrum was their leader, and one of the conditions of peace on which Alfred insisted was, that Guthrum should become a Christian. To this Guthrum agreed, and he remained a faithful friend of King Alfred till he died. England now remained quiet for the remainder of Alfred's life, and he was able, therefore, to give himself up entirely to the improvement of his country and his country's laws.

The Danes become the terror of the country. Dane-gelt. Ravages of the Danes. of Ethelred the Unready, the history is little more than a record of contests with the Danes. For about three centuries the Danes were the terror of the country. They generally anchored their ships at the mouths of rivers, or lay under the islands on the coasts. Thence they sailed up the rivers into the interior of the country, where they often mounted on horseback and rode with wonderful speed from one place to another. Their progress was marked by the burning of churches and convents, castles and towns ; and great multitudes of people were either killed or dragged away into slavery. Not even the remote districts of Wales were free from these marauders. It is true that it was difficult for the Danes to force an entrance on the land side, and, in order to do so by sea, it was necessary to make a long and dangerous voyage round the long penin sula formed by Cornwall and Devonshire. But yet the Danes seem to have known Wales well, for they always called it Bretland, or the land of the Britons, to distinguish it from England. In the reign of Ethelred a tax called Dane-gelt was imposed, for the purpose of paying the Danes money to leave the country; but, as a matter of course, the Danes took the money but did not leave the country. In the old chronicles we constantly meet with such records as the following: \u2014 \"a.d, 991. This year Ipswich was ravaged. And in that year it was decreed that tribute, for the first time, should be given to the Danish men, on account of the terror which they caused to the sea coast ; that was at first ten thousand pounds.

Then became the dread of the army so great, that no man could think or discover how they could be driven out of the land, or this land maintained against them ; for they had every shire in Wessex sadly marked, by burning and by plundering. Then the King began earnestly with his Witan (or wise men) to consider what might seem most advisable to them all, so that this land might be saved before it was entirely de stroyed. Then the King and his Witan decreed for the behalf of the whole nation, though it was hateful to them all, that they must needs pay tribute to the army. Then the King sent to the army, and directed it to be made known to them that he would that there should be a truce between them, and that tribute should be paid, and food given them.

And then they established free friendship, by word and by pledge, on either half, and declared every Danish king an outlaw from England for ever. Then, during Lent, King Ethelred came home to his own people, and he was gladly received by them all.\" On his arrival he attacked the Danes, and com pelled Canute, the son of Sweyn, to retire to his ships. But Canute soon subdued Wessex, and then passed into Mercia. Ethelred gathered together a force to oppose them ; but fearing treachery he retired to London, and his troops dispersed. Canute next made himself master of Northumbria, and then returned to Wessex, and prepared to attack London. But at this time Ethelred died, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Edmund Ironside. After many fierce contests with Canute, Edmund found himself obliged to divide his kingdom with him, after which he soon died. Canute now became King of England, and secured his throne by marrying Emma, the widow of Ethelred. There were only four Danish kings of England, viz : Sweyn, Canute, and his two sons, Harold, called Harefoot from his swiftness, and his brother Hardicanute. Canute seems to have governed England well. He improved the laws, he restored order and tranquillity to the"], [65, "THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 27 kingdom, and he endeavoured to put an end to the ancient enmities between the Danes and Anglo- Saxons. His successors, Harold Harefoot and Hardicanute, greatly oppressed the Anglo-Saxons. The English People and Language spring mainly from the Anglo-Saxon Race. The downfall of the Anglo-Saxon race, as Kings of England, began with the crowning of Sweyn. But, though the Anglo-Saxons did not henceforth reign over England, except for a short period, yet we know, from the number of Anglo-Saxon words in our language, as well as from other reasons, that the Saxons had so completely settled themselves over all the country, and mixed so completely with the ancient inhabitants that, as I have before said, the Anglo-Saxons must be considered as the race from which we, mainly, have sprung. We English are a mixed race. There were first, as I have told you, the Celts, then the Belgians or Gauls, then the Romans, then the Saxons, then the Danes, and last of all, as you will soon hear, the Normans. But although we are thus a mixed race, we know, as I have before said, from our language, that the Saxons mixed with us more than any other races. They were, as an eloquent writer * says, \" The founders of our laws and liberties, whose language we speak, in whose homes we dwell, and in whose establish ments and institutions we justly glory.\" The English people spring mainly from the Anglo- Saxons. In illustration of the derivation of our language from the Anglo-Saxon, I may mention, that out of the sixty-nine words which make up the Lord's Prayer, Many English words come from the Anglo- Saxons. * Sir James Mackintosh."], [66, "28 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND. The Anglo. Saxon Ian. guage has great force. all are Anglo-Saxon but five. The greater force of the Anglo-Saxon is also manifest, if we compare two sentences. If we use English words derived from Norman-French or Latin, we say, \" Felicity attends virtue;\" but if we use good old Anglo-Saxon, we say, \" Well being comes from well doing.\" The difference between the Anglo-Saxon and the Norman or French is in some instances curious. The Anglo-Saxons were a little rough and homely ; the Normans po lished, civilised, and acquainted with the arts of life. Ox is an Anglo-Saxon word, but when the ox is cooked he becomes beef, from b\u0153uf an ox, a French word used by the Normans. Sheep is Anglo-Saxon, but the roasted sheep is mutton, from the French word mouton, a sheep. The calf is an Anglo-Saxon beast, but the Norman turns him into veal, from the French word veau, a calf. The pig and his snout are Anglo-Saxon, but, if you make him into pork (from the French word pore), he at once becomes fit for the table of a Norman baron. It would be easy to multiply these instances, but I have said enough to show you that you are every day talking Anglo-Saxon when you fancy you are talking English. Division of England into Shires, Parishes, Hundreds, dsc. The division of England into shires (or as we now call them, counties), into hides, tithings, hundreds, parishes, and manors, has been attributed to Kino- Alfred, but it probably existed at an earlier period. The country was certainly so divided in the time of the Anglo-Saxons. In the Life of King Alfred, by Asser, many of the present counties are mentioned by name, and in the laws of King Edgar, Alfred's"], [67, "29 TERRITORIAL DIVISIONS: PARISHES. Division of England into shires. &c. Origin of the ownership of landed property. Origin of Parishes. great-grandson, parishes are mentioned; and, indeed, as the word Parish is derived from a Latin word parochia, which originally came from the Greek, it is likely that the word, and the division of the land expressed by the word, were introduced with Chris tianity during the time of the Romans. The word County was not used in Anglo-Saxon times, as it is a French word introduced by the Normans, which they applied to the divisions formerly called shires. It is difficult to trace the origin of these divisions, or of their boundaries, with minute accuracy; but still, much has been found out, and I can tell you enough to give you some ideas on the subject, and to arouse your curiosity. When the country was first peopled by settlers from other lands, a family took possession of and cultivated a tract of land, the boundaries of which must originally have been very uncertain. As the family increased, the tract most likely was increased too. But in those early times there was constant fighting going on, and the successful leader of a band of armed men naturally took possession of the lands occupied by those he conquered. Thus certain por tions of land became, and remained, the property of certain men and of their descendants, who were named thanes or lords. Now from this we will first try to trace the origin of Parishes. When Christianity began to spread itself, the lords built churches on their lands. Every man was obliged to pay tithes for the support of a church, and the lords, in order to secure Divine Ser vice being performed in these churches, obliged their tenants to pay their tithes to the church on their land, and the tract of land thus apportioned became a parish. It sometimes happened that the lord had"], [68, "30 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND. Origin of Shires. Divisions of Lands called Marks. outlying portions of land, separate from the rest of his property, which he charged with like payments. This accounts for parts of parishes lying some times, even now, within the boundary of another parish.* The origin of Counties or shires is supposed to have been something of this kind. The earliest divi sions of land of which we have any mention were called Marks. Land, in the earliest times, was held sometimes by many men in common, or by several householders, and land thus held was called a Mark or March. Trees of peculiar size and beauty, and carved with figures of birds and beasts, sometimes served as boundaries. Thus we read of a spot called \" the Five Oaks,\" of an oak called \" the Marked Oak,\" and at Addlestone, near Chertsey, is an ancient and most venerable oak, called the \" Crouch or Cross Oak,\" which is believed to have been a boundary of Windsor Forest. Sometimes the boundaries were striking natural features ; a hill, a brook, a marsh, a rock, or the artificial mound or burial place of an ancient warrior, warned the intruder to keep off dangerous ground, or taught the herdsman how far he might lead his flocks. In water or marshy land poles were set up, which it was as impious to remove as it would have been to cut down or burn a mark-tree in a forest.f The men or families living within these Marks were called Markmen, and were united together for mutual defence, and for their own government. In some cases several of these Marks probably united together and formed a Shire. It is of course difficult, at this distance of time, and with so little authentic history, to find out with certainty whether this was * Blackstone. + Kemble."], [69, "TERRITORIAL DIVISIONS : TITHINGS, ETC. 31 Hides. tithings, and hundreds, Origin of the word Shire. the origin of some of the shires ; but, if it is so, the origin of the boundary lines of the counties is to some extent accounted for. The land was also divided into hides, tithings, and hundreds. A Hide contained about 120 acres, and supported a free family. Ten such free families constituted a Tithing, and ten or twelve such tithings constituted a Hundred. A certain number of these hundreds may have united together to form a Shire, or the shires may have been divided into hundreds, tithings, and hides. Yorkshire was once divided into three divisions called trithings, which have been since changed into ridings. In Sussex these divi sions were, and are, still called \" Rapes,\" as the Rape of Bramber, &c, from the Saxon word hreipp, a rope, because the country was divided by ropes drawn across the land. This mode of dividing the land, along with the name Rape, is now found in no other place but Iceland, a Norse colony. This has led learned men to believe that some of the Northmen (or Norse) settled in Sussex. Lewes is a Norse name, Hlodhus. I may Tiere mention that the word Shire is de rived from a Saxon word, scyran, to cut or divide, because a shire was a division of the land ; and that Sheriff means the Shire-reeve, or judge of the county, as Borough-reeve means the judge of the borough or town. Tithings and hundreds were instituted to assist in the administration of justice. The ten families dwelling together in a tithing were sureties or free pledges to the king for the good behaviour of each other ; and if any offence was com mitted in their district they were bound to have the offender forthcoming.

In other parts of England all are shires. bitants of the tithing was annually appointed to pre side over the rest, and was called the tithing-man, or head-borough. If the tithing could not produce an offender who had fled, the head-borough was to take two of the most respectable members of the tithing in which the offence was committed, and nine from the three nearest tithings, and these twelve (the head-borough being reckoned among them) were to clear the tithing of being parties to the escape of the criminal. If they could not do this, the goods of the offender were answerable for the compensation fixed for the offence, and if these were not sufficient, then the tithing at large had to pay. Even now, in case of damage to property by riot, the owners are entitled to compensation from the hundred. It is a curious matter for inquiry why some counties were called Shires, and why others were not so called. As yet, learned men have not been able to explain this, but still it is interesting to observe how the shires are distributed. In the first place, in the south-east and east of England, there are no shires ; there are Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Middlesex, Kent, Surrey, and Sussex. In the middle of England, or the old kingdom of Mercia, all the counties are shires ; there are Leices tershire, Nottinghamshire, Staffordshire, and so on. Again in the south, or ancient kingdom of Wessex, they are all shires ; there are Somersetshire, Dorset shire, Hampshire, Wiltshire, Hertfordshire, Berk shire, &c. Cornwall meant Cornish Wales, and was so called because the inhabitants spoke the same language as the Welsh. In Wales all are shires except Anglesey, or English isle."], [71, "TERRITORIAL DIVISIONS: SHIRES. 33 In the north of England there are very few in other shires. The counties are principally lands ; there aiTare are Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmoreland ; Lands and these are the only lands in England except Rutland and Cleveland, a district of Yorkshire. Durham is the only county in the north which is not a land or a shire. The other two northern counties are shires, viz. Lancashire and Yorkshire. In York shire were formerly three small shires, viz. Hallam shire, Blackburnshire, and Richmondshire, and one land, viz. Cleveland; and in Northumberland was formerly a small shire called Hexhamshire. In Scotland there are only three counties which are not shires, and of these Caithness and Suther land are both Norwegian. This is why the latter, although the most northern county in Scotland, is called South-, or Suther-, land. It was south of Norway. In Ireland there are no shires. The shires took their name in most cases from The shires towns, which were built before the country was di- n\u00b0amesie'r vided into shires. Thus we know that York was from towns already built before the time of the Romans, before shires were built. heard of, and must have given its name to Yorkshire. In like manner Leicester gave the name to Leicester shire, Hertford to Hertfordshire, and so on. This rule applies to the whole of the midland counties, form ing, as I have mentioned, the old kingdom of Mercia. Shropshire at first seems to be an exception ; but Shrewsbury, the capital town, was anciently spelt Scrobbesbury, from which Shropshire (perhaps ori ginally Scrobbesburyshire) was probably derived.

Norfolk and Suffolk were the ancient kingdom of East Anglia divided into the North-folk and South folk. Essex and Middlesex were parts of the king dom of East Seaxe. Kent was the old kingdom of the Cantwara, and Canterbury was the borough or town of the Cantwara. Sussex was South Seaxe ; Surrey was formerly Suthric, or Suthrige, which meant the southern people, or people south of the Thames. In the north the counties took their names from divisions of the land; thus, Northumberland was a part of the old kingdom of Northumbria, or land north of the Humber, and Cumberland was the land of the Cumbrians. If any apology were needed for thus bringing before you an account of the origin of these an cient divisions of our island, the following extract from Dean Trench's Lectures on the Study of Words would be quite sufficient. He says : \" Of all the thousands who are aware that the Angles and Saxons established themselves in this island, and that we are in the main descended from them, it would be curious to know how many have realised to themselves that this ' England ' means ' Anode land,' or that in the names of ' Essex,' ' Sussex,' and ' Middlesex,' we preserve a record to this dav of East Saxons, South Saxons, and Middle Saxons, who occupied those several portions of the land.

The changes they effected in our laws are matter of controversy, and patriotic Danes claim for them trial by jury, and many other benefi cial institutions. In this there is unquestionably great exaggeration. The exact truth is difficult to ascertain, but the Danish names of places, scattered over a considerable portion of England, show that they had settled themselves widely throughout the country. The Danish names of places may easily be dis tinguished from the Anglo-Saxon. Thus, all places which end in -ton, -ham, -bury or borough, -forth or -ford, -hurst (a wood or forest), and -worth, not to mention others, are Anglo-Saxon. Sussex, Surrey, and Kent were eminently Anglo-Saxon counties, and the number of places whose names end in -hurst, as Penshurst, Midhurst, Ewhurst, are evidence, not only of their Saxon character, but also of the extensive forests which formerly covered large portions of those counties, and of which many parts still remain, espe cially on the borders of Sussex and Surrey. The Weald (wold or wood) is yet applied to the same district, including the adjoining part of Kent.

In one instance it is curious that the Danes changed the name of an old Saxon city into a Danish name, and that the Danish name has remained to this day. Derby, which from its termination is evidently a Danish word, was originally called by the Saxons Northweorthig. The Danes had five great settle ments in that part of England, viz. : Derby, Stamford, Lincoln, Nottingham, and Leicester. What I have told you about these names of places is sufficient to show you that the Danes settled them selves widely over England, and principally on the north-east coast, from which they seem to have spread into the midland counties. From the south, where they made great efforts to overcome the Anglo-Saxons, they seem to have been entirely driven out ; and neither in our language, nor in our laws, have they, in any part of England, left traces so deep as the Saxons. The Reign of Edward the Confessor. a.d. 1042. Hardicanute died in 1041, and, on his death, the English, enraged at the oppressions of the Danes under his reign and that of his predecessor Harold Harefoot, shook off the Danish yoke, and chose for their king, Edward, called the Confessor on account of his piety.

When the Normans ad vanced, the Anglo-Saxons, under the command of Harold, kept inside their camp, which was strongly fortified with ditches and palisades, and there they awaited the attack of the Normans. Again and again the Normans rushed furiously against them, charging with their cavalry, and pouring showers of arrows from their bows and cross-bows into the Anglo-Saxon ranks. But in vain. The Anglo-Saxons were armed with battle-axes, with which they broke the lances of the Norman cavalry, and penetrated their coats of mail. At length the Normans tried to draw their foes out of their strong camp by stratagem. They rushed to the attack, and then pretended to retreat. The Anglo-Saxons were deceived. They followed them in disorder, were attacked by the Normans, and driven back with great slaughter. Three times did this happen, but yet the Saxons were uncon quered. At length a fatal accident gave the victory to the Normans. An arrow entered Harold's eye, and pierced his brain. Quickly did the news of Ha rold's fatal wound spread through the Saxon ranks. Dismay and consternation quenched their valour, while the Normans gained fresh spirit from their woe. Again they rushed to the attack ; the Saxons fled, and the Normans gained the day. Thus ended the reign of the Anglo-Saxon kings, and thus began the reign of the Norman kings of England, beginning with William of Normandy, called from that time William the Conqueror.

William creates the New Forest in Hampshire. Among the acts of William the Conqueror, of which we find traces to this very day, I must mention the creation of the New Forest in Hampshire. William carried his love of hunting to excess, and, with a view to provide himself with a tract of country where deer, wild boars, and all sorts of game, might increase and multiply, he turned the cultivated ground of a great part of Hampshire into a forest, and so it remains to the present day. It is being gradually brought back into cultivation, but a large portion of the New Forest planted by William the Conqueror still remains. A writer of the time gives this cha racter of him : \"So stern was he and hot, that no man durst gainsay his will. He had earls in prison ; bishops he hurled from their bishoprics. He overran Scotland, and he would in two years have Avon Ire land, In his time men had much distress. He took money by right and by unright. He made many deer parks, and he established laws by which whoso ever slew a hart or hind was deprived of his eyesight.

The curfew bell was done away with in the reign of William Rufus, but, even now, it is still rung at Norwich, at Winchester, at Oakham in Rutlandshire, and some other places. Domesday Book. A view of the reign of William would be very incomplete without a notice of what is called Domesday Book. This was a book drawn up by order of William, and contained a complete account of the state of England in his reign. The original written book still exists in the Chapter House of Westminster Abbey. It is the most complete and most curious account of a country in such far off times that has ever been written. It gives the names of the owners and tenants of every estate in England, and shows us the different classes and occupations of the rest of the people. We find there were Norman Barons and Saxon Thanes. These were the nobility of the land, and were called freemen. Then there was a class called Villeins, \u2014 not villains, meaning bad men; but a class of men allowed to occupy the land at the will of the lord, on condition of performing certain services, often of the meanest nature.

There were in it as tenants four Frenchmen, twenty-two Villeins, nine Bordars, five Cottars, and five Serfs. There was one mill, a fishery, with meadow and pasture, and wood for 1200 pigs. The manor of Aylesbury, in the neighbouring county of Buckinghamshire, made a royal manor in William's reign, was formerly held on very curious terms. It was granted on condition of the tenants finding litter or straw for the king's bedchamber three times a year, if he came that way so often, and providing him with three eels in winter, and three green geese in summer. Domesday Book proves that at that time the vine was grown in England. There are thirty-eight vineyards enumerated in the southern and eastern counties. Many gardens are mentioned. Mills are registered with great distinctness, for they were always the property of the lords of the manors, and the villeins could grind only at the lord's mill. It would be easy to extend this account of the state of England from Domesday Book, but I have told you enough to show you how curious and im portant is this account of England in those times. At length William the Conqueror came to his end. He was obliged to go over to France to defend his possessions in Normandy, and at the siege of Mantes his horse trod on some burning embers, and injured him so severely that he soon died from the effects of his accident.

A.D. 1087 to A. u. 1100. William the Conqueror was succeeded by his second son William, called William Rufus from the redness of his hair. He hastened from Normandy and seized the crown before his elder brother Robert could take any steps to support his claims to the throne. Robert succeeded his father as Duke of Normandy, and in vaded England with a view of placing himself on the English throne. But William made fair promises to the Anglo-Saxons, who flocked to his help, and the invaders were defeated. William retaliated by carry ing the war into France. He took possession of many towns, and thus again established the dominion of the English over a large part of France, which began by William, Duke of Normandy, sitting on the English throne, and which lasted for nearly two centuries, and was the cause of constant war and enmity be tween the two nations. The Crusades. In the reign of William Rufus began those extra ordinary expeditions to a distant land, of which you must have heard under the name of the Crusades, or wars of the Holy Cross. It had been for several hundred years the practice of the Christians to make pilgrimages to Jerusalem, in order to visit the Holy Sepulchre, where the body of Our Saviour was laid. The Egyptian caliphs,"], [89, "51 THE FIRST CRUSADE. who ruled over part of Palestine, had always encou raged these pilgrimages, for they necessarily brought much money into the land. But when the Turks, who hated the Christians bitterly, obtained posses sion of Jerusalem, they laid heavy burthens on the Christian pilgrims. At length a Frenchman, called \"Peter the Hermit,\" went over Europe preaching war against the Infidels. He had himself been a pilgrim, and had, therefore, seen the cruelties inflicted on the Christians by the Turks. He roused all Europe to unite as one man to drive the infidels from the Holy Land. Peter the Hermit appealed to the Pope to help the noble cause, and the Pope answered his call. \" Go,\" he said, \" to attack the enemies of God. Let such as will fight for Christianity put a red cross on their gar ments, as the symbol of the Redeemer's sufferings, as an outward sign of their OAvn love.\" Then gathered the people together with a spirit which has hardly ever been equalled. Even old men, women, and children eagerly followed the sacred banner, and much they must have added to the horrors and the sufferings which the Crusaders underwent. It was no easy matter in those days for thousands of people, and they a complete rabble, to travel thousands of miles, without discipline, without proper supplies of food, without surgeons to attend to their wounds, through countries of which they knew nothing, through climates to which they were utter strangers, among people whose manners were different from their manners, and whose language was to them an unintelligible jargon.

It was a far distant land, which a few pious and adventurous spirits had reached Jby difficult paths, over mountains and through deserts, and had returned to tell of its wonders and its dangers. At length the Crusaders reached the Holy Land, in spite of all their difficulties and all their suf ferings. The English were led by Robert Duke of Normandy, the elder brother of William Rufus. They advanced against Jerusalem and, after a siege of two months, they carried it by assault, with a dreadful slaughter of the Turks. This was the first crusade, and the success of the Crusaders enabled the Christians for a long time to visit the Holy Sepulchre in peace and safety. There was, however, a second, and a third, crusade, of which you will hear by and by. This first crusade took place, as I have said, in the reign of William Rufus, but of him I have nothing more to tell you of any importance.

Her Saxon name was Edith, but to please the Normans, her name was changed to Maud or Matilda. Henry sat on the throne for nearly forty years, but nothing very remarkable took place during his reign. In the early part he was constantly at war with his elder brother, Robert Duke of Normandy, who again invaded England in an attempt to obtain the English throne. His army, and that of King Henry, lay in sight of each other for some days, but peace was made between them by the influence of Anselm, the Archbishop of Canterbury. It was agreed that Robert should keep possession of Normandy, and Henry remain king of Eng land. But Henry was very ambitious, and soon found a pretext for invading Normandy. He gained a victory over his brother, took him prisoner, and carried him off to England.

He did only what others of our kings did in those times without being branded as usurpers. The rightful possessor of the crown, as we should now think, was Matilda, the daughter of the late king ; and Stephen's whole reign was occupied by contests for the throne with her and her uncle David, king of Scotland, who supported her claims. In order to gain adherents to his cause, Stephen was obliged to make many concessions to the Norman barons. They extorted leave to fortify their castles, which they filled with their turbulent soldiers, and greatly oppressed the people. An old chronicler says : \" They filled the castles with devils and evil men. They seized those whom they supposed to have any goods, men and labouring women, and threw them into prison, for their gold and silver, inflicting on them unutterable tortures. Some they hanged up by their feet, and smoked with foul smoke ; some by the thumbs, or by the beard, and hung coats of mail on their feet. This lasted the nineteen years that Stephen was king, and it grew continually worse and worse.\" These are the words of a writer of those days, and they give us a striking picture of the ferocity of the times.

The name Plantagenet is derived from the Latin name of the broom plant, Genista, and Plan tagenet means the plant Genista, or broom. Henry's father, Geoffrey, took this name because he usually wore a sprig of this plant in his helmet. Henry was not only King of England, but he possessed nearly one third of France. From his mother he inherited Normandy, from his father Anjou, and with his wife Eleanor, the divorced wife of Louis the Seventh of France, he received Aqui taine. Henry's reign was memorable for his contests with the Pope. The murder of Thomas a Becket, Arch bishop of Canterbury, sprang from those disputes. It was a struggle between the Pope and the King of England to decide which was the strongest, temporal power, \u2014 that is, the power of the state, or the ecclesiastical power, \u2014 that is, the power of the church. The struggle began in this way. England in those days was a Roman Catholic country ; and the Pope claimed authority over the kings, but more especially over all the bishops and clergymen in every country. The English clergy, supported by the Pope, refused to be judged by the laws of the land, and demanded that none should have power over them but their bishops and superiors in the church. Since the Reformation, which took place in the reign of Henry VIII. , the Pope has had no power in this country, and the clergy have de voted themselves to teaching religion to the people ; and they now not only devote themselves to this, but they do all in their power to promote the education"], [96, "58 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND.

But in those days it was otherwise. Thomas a Becket stood by the Pope. He was the son of a citizen of London, who went with the Cru saders to the Holy Land, and who married the daughter of a Saracen. He early showed great ability, and thus gained the friendship of Theobald, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who sent him to Italy to gain knowledge, and on his return promoted him to high offices. When Henry came to the throne, Thomas a Becket was made chancellor, and was in trusted with the education of the King's son. The King bestowed on him also much property in land, and gave him the castle at Great Berkhampstead to live in. Here he dwelt in the greatest splendour, and his pomp and luxury were beyond anything that had ever been seen. His historian, in describing his luxuries, gives a curious illustration of the manners of the times. He says that his rooms were every day in winter covered with clean straw or hay, and in summer with green rushes, lest the gentlemen who visited him should soil their fine clothes by sitting on a dirty floor. This does not give one a very exalted idea of his grandeur ; but what are now every-day comforts, were in those days unheard-of luxuries. He was fond of hawking, hunting, and feats of horsemanship. When Archbishop Theobald died, the King put Becket in his place. He knew that Becket was aware of his intention to put down the encroachments of the clergy, and he thought he might rely on him as his friend. But no sooner did Becket become archbishop, than his whole nature seemed to change. He kept up his former pomp"], [97, "THOMAS A BECKET. 59 Thomas a Becket sides witli the Pope. The King complains of Becket's opposition. and splendour in the number of his servants, but in his own person he put on the most rigid austerity. He wore sackcloth next his skin ; his usual food was plain bread, and his drink was pure water. He gave up the great offices of state which Henry had bestowed on him, and told the King that henceforth he must devote himself to his spiritual concerns. The fact was that he was an ambitious man, and was resolved to support the power of that church of which, in England, he had now become the head. An opportunity soon came for showing his intentions. A priest grossly insulted a gentleman's daughter, and murdered her father. The King demanded that the priest should be delivered up, to be punished accord ing to the laws of the land ; but Becket, now Arch bishop of Canterbury, refused, and maintained that he should be judged by the church alone. The King summoned the clergy, to decide what was to be done ; and it was settled that a priest who committed a crime should be judged by the laws of the realm, as if he were a layman. Becket pretended to submit ; but, being supported by the Pope, he again opposed the King. Finding he was likely to be worsted in the conflict, he escaped secretly to France. After an absence of six years, he was allowed to return to England, and he soon again put the power of the church in opposition to the power of the King. Henry was much provoked, and at last ex claimed, \" To what a miserable state am I reduced, when I cannot be at peace in my own realm by reason of only one priest ; there is no one to deliver me from my troubles.\" Henry, it is to be hoped, did not mean that he wished the archbishop to be mur dered, but his words were heard by four knights, who"], [98, "60 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND. determined to take the part of the king against the archbishop.

It is fortunate for us that the principles for which Becket strove are not the principles of our days ; but the murder of the archbishop was a crime which cannot be justified by any consideration, whether human or divine. The Pope and the clergy in general naturally looked on Becket as a martyr, and three years after his death, he was canonised, or made a saint, by the Pope. His body was removed to a magnificent shrine in Canterbury Cathedral, enriched with pre sents from all parts of Christendom. Pilgrims went thither to obtain his intercession with Heaven, and even the King himself made a pilgrimage to the tomb of St. Thomas a Becket. His kingdom was disturbed by rebellion, and by an invasion from Scotland, and it was believed that these disasters were a judgment on him for the murder of St. Thomas a Becket. He therefore made this pilgrimage to the shrine. He walked barefoot towards it, knelt down, remained in fasting and prayer a whole day, and watched the holy reliques all night. He even submitted to greater humiliation : he assembled the monks to gether, put a scourge into the hands of each, and allowed them to lash his bare shoulders. It is said, that in one year 100,000 pilgrims arrived in Canterbury, and paid their devotions at the tomb of St. Thomas a Becket. The shrine was destroyed by Henry VIII. at the time of the Reformation, but there are still sixty-four churches in England dedi cated to his memory.

Some Jews, however, came to offer him presents, according to the custom of the East, and they forced their way into Westminster Hall, where the ceremony was to take place. A Christian struck a Jew as he entered, a quarrel between Jews and Christians at once began, and the Jews were driven out of the Hall. London was full of people from the country, who had come up to see the sights, and all the Lon doners were in the streets. A cry arose that the King had ordered all the Jews to be massacred, and then began a fearful attack on the poor Jews. Old and young, women and children, were murdered alike. Some shut themselves up in their own houses, which were set on fire, and the inmates were thus burnt in their own dwellings. In other cases, the rabble forced their way into the houses, and threw the sick and dying into the flames. The Christians set the Jews a bad example. At York the scenes were, if possible, worse. After seeing their wives and children butchered before their eyes, the Jews shut themselves up in the castle, which was besieged by a furious mob for several days. At last, the night before the assault was expected, a Hebrew rabbi thus addressed his people : \" Men of Israel, God commands us to die for his law, as our glorious forefathers have done in all ages.

Richard's reign was chiefly memorable for his ad ventures in the Holy Land, at the head of the Crusaders ; for, out of the ten years of his reign, not one was passed in England. You will recollect that I told you the first crusade took place in the reign of William Rufus, and that its object was to deliver Jerusalem from the Turks. The first cru sade was about the year 1100, and the Crusaders succeeded in their object ; but the Turks did not allow the Christian pilgrims to visit the Holy Se pulchre unmolested. Consequently, a second crusade was preached about fifty years after the first; and, after fighting the Turks for nearly forty years, the Crusaders were defeated, and Jerusalem was taken. In this crusade the English had but bttle part. The Kings of England and France now determined to unite for a third crusade. Richard's whole soul was in the expedition, and he cared not what he did so long as he could raise money enough for the war. He sold lands, he sold earldoms, he sold public offices. He even sold the right which he possessed of com pelling the King of Scotland to do him homage. \" I would sell London,\" he exclaimed, \" if I could find a chapman.\" At length the army was raised, embarked, and landed in France. Richard and the French kinff, Philip Augustus, had agreed to unite their forces.

For this the French king never forgave him. At length, after many adventures, the combined fleets reached the Holy Land, and Richard and Philip laid siege to Acre, a strong city on the coast. The Turks defended Acre with great courage, but at last they were obliged to yield. Now were seen the fatal effects of the quarrel between the two kings. Philip did not forget Richard's want of faith to his daughter, and he was also jealous of the renown Richard had gained for his bravery. He was angry that, as an old .chronicler says, \" There was not of him a word, but all of Richard the king.\" Philip, therefore, secretly treated with Saladin, the brave leader of the Turks, for peace. Saladin agreed to release 2,500 Christian prisoners, and to pay the Crusaders a large sum of money. The French king now proclaimed that the Crusade was at an end, and returned to France, leaving Richard behind to see that Saladin fulfilled the con ditions of peace. But no sooner had the French departed, than Saladin began to make delays in keeping his promises. Richard determined on a fearful revenge. He had taken nearly 3000 hostages for the fulfilment of the conditions of peace, and these he now determined to slaughter. They were led out of the city and hanged.

The place of his imprisonment is said to have been discovered in the following manner. In those days it was the custom for kings and great men to keep minstrels to sing and play to them. It seems that Richard's minstrel, named Blondel, was wan dering about in Germany in search of his sovereign, doubtless watching near every fortress in which his lord and master might be shut up. He one day heard a well-known song, sung by a well-known voice. It was his beloved master. Blondel imme diately answered him by singing another verse of the same song. Thus the King knew he was dis covered by his friends, and Blondel knew he had found the King. The minstrel communicated witli the King's friends in England, who negotiated with the emperor for the King's ransom. The emperor demanded an enormous sum, which the English had much difficulty in raising. The plate of the churches and monasteries was melted down to make into money, and, says an ancient annalist, \"England from sea to sea was reduced to the utmost distress.\" At length the ransom was paid and Richard returned to England. During the King's absence in the Holy Land, his brother John, prompted by the French king, Philip Augustus, had endeavoured to possess him self of England, and the French king had endea voured to seize King Richard's possessions in Nor mandy.

When John became king, the distinction between Saxons and Normans was strongly marked, and before the end of the reign of his grandson, it had almost dis appeared. In the time of Richard the First, the ordinary imprecation of a Norman gentleman was, \"May I become an Englishman,\" \u2014 as we now say, \" I'm a Dutchman if I do such or such a thing.\" The ordinary form of indignant denial was, \" Do you take me for an Englishman ? \" But one hundred years later, the descendant of such a gentleman was"], [107, "69 JOHN MURDERS HIS NEPHEW. John's contest with his nephew Arthur. John murders his nephew. proud of the English name.* In John's reign, too, the English language began to be the language of the nation. I will now relate the events of King John's reign in regular order. On the death of Richard, the crown was claimed by Arthur, called Arthur of Brittany. He was the son of John's elder brother Geoffrey. But John was chosen king because Richard had left the throne to him by will, and Arthur was a mere boy. In those days, the right order of succession to the throne was not clearly settled. John was firmly seated on the English throne, and Arthur took pos session of those parts of France which belonged to the English crown. But as soon as he was crowned, John went over to France to recover his possessions. At first, Arthur was successful ; but at length King John fell suddenly on his army, and took Arthur prisoner. He was but a youth, but John feared to allow him to live, and he caused him to be murdered, or, as some say, murdered him with his own hands. A writer of the time thus describes the horrible scene. Some of John's counsellors suggested to the King the necessity of unfitting Arthur for rule by blinding him. The wretches sent to execute this command were disarmed by the tears and cries of the poor boy, and the cruel deed was delayed till the King's pleasure was known. It was all in vain. At midnight, poor Arthur was suddenly awakened, and ordered to come out of the tower in which he was imprisoned. At the door he found his merciless uncle, with an attendant. Arthur threw himself on * Macaulay."], [108, "70 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND. John's dispute with the Pope. his knees, and with a flood of tears implored his uncle to spare his life. John ordered his attendant to murder the poor boy. The attendant, Walter de Mauluc, more tender-hearted than his master, shrank from the deed, and then the remorseless tyrant, seizing his nephew by the hair, stabbed him with his own hands, and threw his body into the river Seine. By this foul murder John lost the greater part of his French dominions at one blow. The French king, who, according to what is called the feudal system (of which you will hear in the next lecture), was his superior, summoned John to appear before him to answer the charge of murdering his nephew. John refused, and Philip took possession of the French provinces, with but little resistance from John, who returned to England. King John was soon afterwards engaged in a dis pute with the Pope. In those days the Pope claimed the right of having a voice in the appointment of English bishops. John determined to dispute that right; and on the death of Hubert, the Archbishop of Canterbury, he appointed the Bishop of Norwich to succeed him. The Pope demanded that one Ste phen Langton, an Englishman educated in France, and friendly to the Pope, should be appointed in his place. John refused: whereupon the Pope excom municated him, and laid the kingdom under an inter dict. Under an interdict all the churches were shut. No knell was tolled for the dead, for the dead re mained unburied. No merry peals welcomed the bridal procession, for no couple could be joined in wedlock. These were among the effects of excom munication and interdict. The Pope also prevailed on the King of France to collect an army to invade"], [109, "John's dispute with the barons. 71 The cowardly John yields to the Pope. The Barons resist John Magna Charta, A.D. 1215. England. When the cowardly John heard of this, he was frightened, and implored the protection of the Pope, whatever submission it might cost. The Pope insisted on the appointment of Langton, to which the King agreed ; and further, on his knees he humbly offered his kingdoms to the Pope, who ac tually had possession of them for five days. By these base means he averted the anger of the Pope, and prevented the invasion of England by the French. But out of the greatest evil Providence can bring forth the greatest good; and it is to this miserable man we are indebted for the liberties we enjoy this day. As the murder of poor Arthur lost the King his French dominions, so did his base submission to the Pope lead to the establishment of English liberty. John's Dispute with the Barons. John's conduct throughout his reign had made him universally unpopular, and now the Barons were enraged beyond measure by his yielding to the Pope. Even Langton, the Pope's Archbishop of Canterbury, now showed himself a true patriot. He took the part of the Barons against the King, and at their head demanded the restoration of their ancient liber ties, and the cessation of his various oppressions. Each party collected an army; but John was soon deserted by his followers, and at last his court was reduced to seven attendants, some of whom were, in their hearts, friends to the Barons. At length, on the 19th June, in the year 1215, a meeting between the King and the Barons took place at Runnymede, on the banks of the Thames, near Staines."], [110, "72 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND. Here the Barons presented to the King that great Charter of our English liberties, of which you must have heard under the name of The Magna Charta. This Charter provided that no man should be im prisoned, or be deprived of his possessions, or be outlawed or exiled, but by the law of the land, and that no taxes should be raised but by the general council of the nation. On these two principles our liberty rests. In other countries men are imprisoned without knowing with what crime they are charged. ; they are kept in prison without trial, and they are condemned without being heard. In other countries taxes are levied by the arbitrary power of the king ; but here, in England, no tax can be imposed without authority from the House of Commons. John took an oath to govern England according to this Magna Charta. This was a great victory over John, and sorely did it vex him. No sooner was he free from the Barons, than he resolved to escape from his oath. He procured foreign soldiers, and overran the country with armies from abroad. The English unwisely called in the aid of the French king ; and, had they gained the victory over John and his foreign soldiers, they would in all probability have sorely rued the day, for they would have found that they had only exchanged an English tyrant for a foreign master. But John soon came to his end. He had assembled a large army to fight one great battle in support of his crown, when, passing alono the shore of the Wash, near Wisbeach, he was over taken by the tide.

Position of England at the Death of King John. My former lecture, as you will remember, ended with the death of King John, soon after Magna Charta had been wrung from him by the barons. You will remember that John was weak, and cruel ; that he was a tyrant and a coward ; that he led an evil life, and that, whenever it suited him, he broke his sacred oath. His son, Henry the Third, whose history I shall next relate, was a better man. No man ever said a word against his manner of life ; he was not a tyrant, and never showed the mean cowardice of which his father was guilty. But he was not a great man, VOL. i. *G"], [116, "76 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND. England's position at the death of John. He was not a wise man like Alfred, or Canute the Dane ; not a man of strong will like William the Norman ; not a man of gallant bravery like Richard the Crusader ; nor a man of learning like Henry the First. But in his reign England made way. Laws were improved, freedom was strengthened, and England became more English. How was this ? It was greatly because he was not a man of strong will, \u2014 because he was not a man of high and lofty aims. He was always in want of money, and to get it he did not shrink from granting in return those demands which gave greater freedom to his people, although at the same time they lessened his own power. He also was always leaning to the French, and thus roused an opposing English spirit. He could not forget that the Plantagenets were a race of Frenchmen, and nobles of France, as well as Kings of England. He therefore showered down honours on Normans, on Gascons, and on the nobles of Poitou and Guienne. He made them his courtiers, his advisers, and his friends ; and thus he roused the English barons to demand, that English nobles should rule over an English people, and thus he helped to make England and England's rulers unite together as an English nation. You will remember, lastly, that at the end of King John's reign, the barons of England, goaded on by his oppressions, and enraged at his treacherous attempts to set aside the Magna Charta, to which he had solemnly sworn, had unwisely called in the French to help them. They called on Louis, the French prince, the son of Philip Augustus, King of France, to come to their aid. Louis pretended that he had a right to be King of England, because"], [117, "77 PURPOSES OF THE PRESENT LECTURE.

But it was unwise to call in foreign help, and had not John died before, by the help of their foreign friends, the English barons had overcome him, England might have become a part of the dominions of the King of France. I have recalled these events to your minds, in order that you may remember what was going on in England, at the time to which 1 had come, at the end of my former lecture. But before I go on with the regular History of events, I wish to pause and take a general view of some of the institutions of the country, which existed at the death of King John, some of which, indeed, began much earlier, but many of which were greatly changed during his reign and that of his immediate successors. I shall, therefore, devote this lecture to that object, but in the next I shall proceed with the regular course of the History. In making this survey, I shall have to beg your earnest attention ; I hope that young and old, men and women, will attend carefully. You must not expect that I am about to amuse you. You will, I hope, find much that is very interesting, but I intend to tell you about serious and important matters, which all Englishmen should understand, and which at these times, above all, should be brought before them. My subject to-night will be, The Ancient Laws and Customs of the Country. I wish to tell you who made our laws, how they were made, who put them in force, and thus I wish to enable you to understand the rights and privileges of Englishmen ; and while, on the one hand, I hope to make you fully value those G 2"], [118, "78 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND. Feudal System, which you now possess, I wish, on the other hand, to prepare you for the proper use of any greater pri vileges which hereafter may be yours. Hie Feudal System. You have already heard much, and in the reign of Henry the Third and his immediate successors you will hear more, of the barons, their castles, and their retainers ; and of the King's castles, and of the King's demesnes. Besides the King's castles, the whole country was in those days covered with others, strongly fortified, belonging to the proud barons, who summoned their vassals to appear in arms at their side, whenever they wished to attack their neighbours, to resist the King, or to help him in his wars. You will hear that these barons sometimes went to Parliament, clothed in armour, each baron surrounded by his own vassals, all fully armed. Now to understand all these matters, I must explain to you that system which I mentioned in my former lecture, and which I told you was called The Feudal System. Under this system all ranks, from the King to the lowest labourer, were bound together; but under conditions that we should now call slavey. I begin my account of the ancient institutions of the country with the Feudal System, because this system was so mixed up with every relation of life, with the origin of the present ownership of land, with the making of our laws, with the putting those laws in force, and indeed lay so completely at the root of all that was thought or done in those days, that you cannot understand the History of England unless you know what the Feudal System means."], [119, "79 ORIGIN OF LANDED PROPERTY. Origin of property in land. Invaders seized the land. Ownership of Land. The Feudal System rested entirely on the owner ship of land, and the duties attending such ownership. It will be well, therefore, to begin by trying to find out how it was that any particular estate or portion of land belonged to any particular person. We know that in the present day many owners of land have bought it from others. But many have received their estates from their fathers, and they have come down from one generation to another. There must, however, have been a beginning of all this, and we must therefore try to find out how it was that the first owner got his land. How the land was owned before the Romans came, we have no means of finding out. But ownership there must have been, for the land was tilled. Flocks and herds might be led over a wild country without any part of it being especially the property of any one person. But no one would plough and sow, as the Ancient Britons did, unless they knew that they would reap the produce, and that they had a right in the land. Beyond this, we know nothing about the ownership of land before the Romans came, nor indeed do we know much more about the subject during their stay in England. The Romans lived chiefly in towns, which they built, leaving the na tives in possession of the land. But, when we come to Anglo-Saxon times, we stand on firmer ground. We know that the Saxons, and all German invaders, seized the land, and kept it either wholly as their own, or gave the natives only a share in it. But the leaders of those Saxon tribes who invaded England were not Kings who ruled over G 3"], [120, "80 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND. The leaders took the largest share. Allodial and feudal. soldiers whom they hired and paid, and who were bound to obey them. They were on the contrary a body of bold free rovers, united under a chief of their own choosing, bolder, abler, or more powerful than themselves. When, therefore, one of these chiefs, with his followers, had overcome a tribe of Britons, and was ready to settle in the land, each man obtained a share, which the chief was obliged to grant.1 There can be but little doubt that the leader took the largest share of the land, or of the plunder. But this was not always yielded without strife. For in stance, when Clovis, King of the Franks, invaded Gaul, the plunder taken was set out at Soissons for distribution. Among the things was a precious ves sel, taken from the Church at Rheims. Clovis asked leave to take it, whereon a fierce soldier exclaimed, \" You shall have nothing here but what falls to your share by lot,\" and, striking the vessel with his battle axe, he dashed it to pieces. Still, without doubt, the leaders had the largest share, and it seems that where soever there was a division of land, there the leader took a portion. For, in the earliest records of authentic history, we find, that, generally through out the different states, the King possessed ample domains.1 Allodial Lands and Feudal Lands. The lands that were divided among the followers of a chief were their own entirely. But the King, from time to time, granted portions of his land to his followers, as rewards for their fidelity, in return for acts of special service, or to attach them more closely to himself. These portions were granted on certain conditions, which gave rise to what is called"], [121, "81 FEUDALISM A SYSTEM OF MUTUAL SERVICE. Mutual service and protection the essence of feudal- ism, the Feudal System. Under that system, the lands which were a man's own property, were called allodial lands, and those which he held of the King, or of any other man, were called feudal lands. In England there never were lands which could properly be called allodial, for William the Conqueror, who introduced the Feudal System into England, provided that all ownership of land should spring from himself, as I shall presently more particularly explain. The lands which were a man's own property, before the intro duction of the Feudal System could not be called allodial, as this term had special reference to that system. Those who held feudal lands were obliged to perform certain duties in return for the use of the land, and to submit to certain laws and usages which were sometimes of an oppressive and degrad ing nature. Feudalism suited to Ancient Times. But we must remember that, while on the one hand, the vassal (as the tenant or occupier of the land was termed) swore to be faithful to his lord (as the grantor of the land Avas called) and to yield him self up to him, the lord, on the other hand, swore to protect his vassal. So great was the benefit of this protection, that many men who held allodial lands were glad of their own will to make them feudal, for the sake of the protection of the lord whose vassal they became. Indeed, \" the greater part of the allodial land had become feudal in the eleventh century.\" 57 The Feudal System began in barbarous times, when every man's hand was against every other man's, and when men were therefore glad to bind themselves together for mutual help. G 4"], [122, "82 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND. The duties which the King's vassals engaged to perform were purely military.58 Each tenant, or vassal, was compelled to provide a certain number of knights or horsemen, fully armed, and ready to fight under the King's banner, and he was bound to keep them in the field at his own cost for a certain number of days.

These had numerous retainers dependent on them, and they imitated the King in parcelling out the land among these retainers, exacting from them services similar to those which the King exacted from themselves, as well as other services, of which I shall presently give you an account. Subvassals or sub- feudatories and sub- infeuda tion. This practice was not prohibited, provided sufficient land were retained by the tenant in chief to enable him to perform the services due to his superior lord.34a After a time, however, this practice was found to be against the interests of the superior lord, and a celebrated Act of Parliament, known by the name of Quia emptores (which means \" forasmuch as purchasers\" did such and such things), was passed in the reign of Edward the First, to provide that when ever a vassal granted land to a subvassal, the sub vassal should hold his land on condition of renderino the required services to the superior lord of whom the vassal held his land.35 Tenure of Land. From various causes the King's tenants found it convenient thus to parcel out their lands. Some- Forms of tenure."], [123, "TENURE OF LAND. 83 times they had more land than they themselves could easily manage, and their military duties often pre vented them from cultivating their lands. They therefore granted portions of their estates to inferior tenants 23, some on military tenure, and some on, what was called, socage tenure, \u2014 that is, on condition of making returns in service, corn, cattle, or money, the term socage being derived from the Anglo-Saxon word, soc, which means a plough. This was the origin of rents.58, 59 The services exacted by these lords of their subvassals or tenants were of different kinds. First, there was free service, which meant such as was not unbecoming a soldier, \u2014 as, to serve under a lord in his wars, and so forth.

These services, whether free or base, were also either certain or uncertain. Certain services were such as were stinted in quantity, and could not be exceeded on any pretence ; as to pay a stated annual rent, or to plough such a field for three days. The uncertain services depended on unknown contingencies, \u2014 such as, to do military service in person, or to pay an assessment instead, whenever called on, or to wind a horn whenever the Scots in vaded the kingdom (which applied of course only to the northern counties), which were free services ; or to do whatever the lord should command, which was a base service.59 a Certain and un certain service. There were other and very curious forms of tenure.

The vas sal's oath. Taken with great so- lemnity. Homage. The Oath of Vassalage. Every military tenant, when he took possession of his land, whether he held it directly from the King, or from one of the King's vassals, had to make the following oath : \u2014 \" Hear, my lord ; I become your liege man of life, and limb, and earthly worship : and faith and truth I will bear to you to live and die. So help me God.\" 74a This oath bound the vassal to defend his lord against all men. In battle, he was bound to lend his horse to his lord when dismounted, to stay by his side while fighting, and if his lord was taken prisoner, the vassal was bound to free him by giving himself up as a hostage for him. The oath was made with great pomp and ceremony. The vassal made it unarmed and bareheaded, on his knees, and with his hands placed between those of his lord ; and, after the oath was taken, the lord and the vassal kissed each other. But the custom of the King's tenants parcelling out their land to tenants under them, called subvassals, rendered an alteration in the oath necessary. The King's tenants swore to defend their lord the King, against all men ; but the sub vassals thenceforth swore to defend their lord against all men except the King. This ceremony was called \" doing homage,\" from the French word homme, a man, because the vassal became his lord's man, that is, he gave himself up to him entirely. The Feudal System, as you will hear, was not fully established in England until the Normans came, but there were traces of it in Anglo-Saxon times. In the time of Athelstan, the grandson of Alfred, it was decreed that a man should take Fealty Oaths, that is, Oaths of Fidelity, in the following manner : \u2014 \" Thus shall a man swear Fealty Oaths. By the"], [126, "86 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND. Ancient fealty oath, Form of investiture of a tenant, The pos sessor of land bound to fight for his lord.

But it makes one believe that in Anglo-Saxon times the people were far from free. Investiture. After the oath was taken, the vassal was invested with the land. This was done in two ways. He was either put in actual possession of the land by his lord going with him and giving it up to him, or it was given to him by a symbol, that is, by the delivery of a clod of earth, a sod of turf, a branch of a tree, or whatever else might be agreed on to represent the land.10 Results of Feudal Customs springing from the Obligation of Military Service. The feudal customs and duties which sprang from military service being exacted of those who held land, were of a very curious nature. But you will see that they sprang naturally from the system. The possessors of estates were not, under the Feudal System, the absolute owners of the land they held of the King, but it was so usual for the estates to descend from father to son that their possessors"], [127, "87 FEUDAL WARDSHIP. became almost absolute owners. But yet the pos sessor could not sell or give away a part, or even the whole, for he who held the land was bound per sonally to fight for his lord, and the person to whom the land was sold might be unable to do so. All therefore at the death of the possessor went to his heir. But the heir might be a child, and unable to perform military service. The lord therefore took possession of the estate, and kept all the profits of it, until the heir became of age. This was not all. When the heir was old enough to possess the estate, he of course was bound to perform military duties, and the lord therefore became his guardian, in order to train him up in such a way that when he became of age, he should be accustomed to the use of arms. The lord became the guardian of his vassal's heir. Tlie Lord's Control over the Marriage of Females. It might, however, happen that the heir was a girl, Customs in who of course could not, in person, fight for her lord, heir being The lord therefore had a right to settle whom she afemale- might marry. Her husband would be his vassal, and it was necessary that his vassal should be a man able and willing to serve and help him. Her father even, for the same reason, could not give her in marriage without consent of his lord, but if the lord refused, he was bound to give a reasonable ground for his refusal. When her father died, the lord acted as the heiress's guardian, and when she was fourteen years of age he might marry her to whomsoever he pleased.75 At one period the lord had the right of compelling the heiress to marry one of three persons whom he presented to her, and there was only one ground on which she Females could refuse. She might say she hated all the three, years old 7 that she loved another, that she was an afflicted obhged\u00b0to widow and would rather not marry again. But all manJ-"], [128, "88 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND. The king often sold his power over the marriage of heiresses. \u25a0 Reliefs. this would be of no avail. If, however, she said she was more than sixty years old, and, therefore, would rather not marry at all, the lord was obliged to let the old woman have her own way.80 Abuses of the Feudal System. These customs were not finally done away with till the reign of Charles the Second, though it was high time they should be. They led to all kinds of abuses. Thus, King John sold to one Thomas Basset the guardianship of an heir, and the right of making him marry one of his daughters. One Reginald de Pon tibus, or Reginald Bridges as we should call him, bought a husband for his daughter, and one Walter Cancy bought the right of marrying any wife he pleased. A widow named Wiveron paid Henry the First a certain sum of money in order that she need not marry unless she pleased ; the widow of the third Earl of Chester after the Conquest paid 500 marks, or 333/. 6s. Sd., that she might not be compelled to marry during five years ; the Countess of Warwick gave security to John that she would not marry, nor enter a convent for twelve months, and she then paid him 1000/. that she might remain a widow as long as she pleased. Under the improved system of Magna Charta, widows were allowed to remain single as long as they pleased, provided they gave security not to marry without consent of their lord.79 Reliefs, Fines, Aids, and Heriots. But there were other conditions following on the feudal possession of land. When an heir, or a fresh tenant, succeeded to an estate, he had to pay a sum of money, which was called a relief, or a fine. If the vassal died without an heir, the estate went back to"], [129, "TAXATION UNDER THE FEUDAL SYSTEM. 89 Aids. Heriots, the lord, and was said to be escheated, from an old French word, eschoir, to fall or happen. The term relief is derived from a Latin word, relevare, to lift or take up again, and the relief was paid by the incom ing tenant or heir, on taking, or lifting up again the inheritance of an estate, which had, as it Avere, fallen to the ground on the death of an ancestor.95 If on the other hand, the vassal failed to perform his mili tary or other duties, the estate was forfeited. There were other payments, called aids, which the vassal was bound to pay to his lord on certain occasions, viz. : when his eldest son was made a knight, when his eldest daughter was married, and when the lord was put in captivity. There was also another custom connected with the holding of land, which exists in full force even at the present day. I mean the custom of claiming a heriot, on the death of a tenant, or on a new tenant entering on possession. The right of claiming a heriot be longed to those upon whose lands were held on socage tenure, which I have already explained, and which was converted into what we now call copyhold tenure. Freehold tenure was occasionally subject to this claim, but this was rarely the case. There is this difference between Heriots and Reliefs. The Heriot was the act of the leaving, and the Relief of the incoming tenant or heir. For a long time a heriot has meant the best live beast, or the best piece of moveable property, such as jewels or plate,61 which belonged to the tenant, and which could be found in his possession at the time of his death. Heriots did not, however, originate with the Feudal System, and did not from the first bear the meaning I have just given, but they consisted originally of war"], [130, "90 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND. Heriots. Heriots in the time of Canute. accoutrements. The word itself is derived from two Anglo-Saxon words, viz. here, an army, and geatwe, appointments, or apparatus, so that its original mean ing was fitting out for battle, and included from the first the horse as well as armour. In confirmation of this we find, in the laws of Canute,74 the following interesting details about the nature of the heriot at that time. \" And let the heriots be as it is fitting to the degree. An ' eorls,' such as thereto belongs, that is, eight horses, four saddled and four unsaddled, and four hel mets, and four coats of mail, and eight spears, and as many shields, and four swords, and two hundred mancuses of gold.

The origin of the custom was probably the duty of military service falling on all holders of land, even before the complete establishment of the feudal system. When, therefore, a tenant died, and his power of performing military duties consequently ceased, the lord claimed the wea pons, or equipments with which he performed those"], [131, "91 CHIVALRY SPRANG FROM FEUDALISM. Fidelity and braverv Chivalry military duties. Originally he may have claimed them in order to give them to the next tenant, for, according to the strict theory, or original notion of heriots, the horse and arms had been the gift, or rather the loan, of the chief, and were to be returned at the death of the vassal, in order that they might furnish some other adventurer with the instruments of service.96 After a time, heriots ceased to mean war equipments only, and were held to give a right, on the part of the lord, to the best live beast, or best piece of moveable property. Good Effects of the Feudal System. Feudalism had its bright side. It arose, as I have said, in barbarous times, when it was good that men should unite together for mutual help in any way. It encouraged feelings of fidelity and respect on one side, and on the other, the duty of protecting and guarding- those who had sworn to be true and faithful. Bravery was held in great esteem, and what is called Chivalry sprang out of the Feudal System. Chivalry sprang from Feudalism . There is so much that is interesting in Chivalry, and it had so great an influence on the manners of the times, that, although it did not flourish in its greatest glory until a century after the reign of Henry the Third, yet a few words on the subject will not be out of place here. Chivalry never was a distinct institution, like the Feudal System, but was rather an exalted idea of the perfection which ought to be arrived at by a military ii"], [132, "92 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND. Symbolic forms. knight. It was a perfection that never was and never could be attained ; but it was set before a young man, when he became a knight, or when he was first allowed to bear arms, as the perfection at which he should aim. The introduction of a young man to the military service was an essential element of feudalism and was the first germ of Chivalry.81 The sons of vassals were allowed to bear arms equally with the sons of their lords, and the barons' castles became schools of military discipline and chivalry, to which the young men considered it a privilege to be admitted. The vassals were glad to avail themselves of such a privilege, and the lords were equally glad to train up a body of brave and chivalrous supporters. Until the young man became of a proper age to bear arms, he served in the castle as-cupbearer, page, or esquire ; but, from the day that he was allowed to bear arms, he ceased to serve in mere household duties, had the privilege of fighting for and protecting his lord, his lord's family, and his lord's estate, and, in a word, became what is called a knight.81 Investiture of a Knight. The ceremony of Investiture, or of presenting a knight with arms, was one of great solemnity, and was intended to impress him with feelings of religion and of honour. He first took off his clothes, and entered a bath, as a symbol of purification. He then put on a white garment as a symbol of purity ; next, a red one, as a symbol of the blood he was ready to shed in defence of his lord, and lastly, a black one, as a symbol of the death he was ready to undergo in dis charge of his duty. He then went through various"], [133, "93 TOURNAMENTS. religious ceremonies, and finally he was girt with his sword. The oath he took bound him to fear God, to serve his King, to protect the weak, to do good for the sake of glory and virtue alone, never to fight a man at unfair odds, and to observe faithfully his plighted word.82 Above all, he bound himself more especially to the defence of women, whom he was supposed to love and obey with the utmost devotion.

Before leaving the subject of Feudalism, I must notice the way in which its ruling principle became abused and degraded. This principle was, as you will remember, the personal discharge of military duties. In course of time many men found this to be an irksome duty, and a custom grew up of paying money to the king instead thereof; this was called scutage, escuage, or shield-money from the Latin word scutum, a shield. This gave the King great power of oppression, for, if he wanted to go to war, he levied a scutage, and after a time, whenever he wanted money he levied a scutage, under the pretence of going to war. At last, however, it was provided by Magna Charta, that these scutages should not be levied without consent of Parliament. Payment instead of service. Scutage.

In order to understand the way in which he introduced it, we must go back to the mode in which men obtained possession of land in the Anglo-Saxon times. The way in which William introduced the feudal system. Those to whom land was given, at the time of the Saxon invasions, held it as their own, and they had the power of giving or selling it to others. All such sales or gifts were accompanied by the giving of a document, called a charter, or land-boc. Whoever had possession of this land-boc, was held to be the owner of the property. These documents, or title deeds as we should call them, were usually placed in a monastery for safety.9 When William came, the lands were no longer seized by a number of fierce warriors, each one claiming a share as his right, but they were distri buted, as rewards, by the leader of a body of soldiers who were bound to obey him. William had promised his warriors to give them land, and one of his first objects was to keep his promise. But he wished that all titles to land should spring from himself, and so he destroyed every one of these land-bocs, by which the Anglo-Saxons held their lands, on which he could lay his hands.9 He then took possession of the royal lands, which were very extensive, seized also the lands of those who had taken arms against him, and distributed them among his followers, who were called Barons, keeping, however, extensive lands for him self.21 The lands were not however, as in Saxon times, given in absolute ownership, but they were granted on certain conditions, viz., on what is called He seized the title deeds of the land owners, and grant' ed the lands on feudal tenure."], [137, "FEUDAL SYSTEM UNDER THE NORMANS. 97 William I. granting Lands in Richmondshire to Alan, Count of Britanny.

I shall now give you some further information as to the tenure of land, and this will lead me to tell you of the different classes into which the nation was divided, and of the state in which they lived. The lands, or estates distributed by AVilliam among his followers, were called Manors by the Normans. The divisions of land thus named, existed, as I told you in my former lecture, in Anglo-Saxon times, but they were not called Manors till the Normans came. The name was derived from a Latin word (manere) meaning to dwell or remain, because the lord dwelt on the land in a house or mansion. A manor was a tract of land held by a lord or great personage, who kept to himself such parts of it as were necessary for his own use. These were called demesne lands. The rest he distributed to freehold tenants. Of the demesne lands again, part was kept in the actual occupation of the lord, for the purposes of his family, part was held in villeinage (which I will explain to you im mediately), and the rest, being uncultivated, was called the lord's waste. This waste portion served for public roads, and for common of pasture, to the lord and his tenants. This explains to you the origin of, and laws relating to commons, such as Chorleywood common, at the present day. Manors were formerly (by the Normans) called baronies, as they still are Lordships, and the owner of the Manor is, as I have no doubt you know, called the Lord of the Manor.60 William the Conqueror seized for himself nearly 1 500 Manors, besides giving between 2000 and 3000"], [139, "99 DIVISION OF THE NATION INTO CLASSES.

The lowest class of the community were called Thralls or Villeins, who existed in a state of abso lute slavery, and none who had unhappily been born in, or had fallen into, bondage, could acquire an ab solute right to any species of property.85 This was also the case in Scotland, as may be seen by the book of ancient Scottish laws. \" Na bondman may buy or purches his libertie with his awin proper gudes or geir, because all the cattell and gudes of all bondmen are understand to be in the power and dominion of the maister : swa that without consent of his maister, he may not redeme himself out of bondage with his awin proper denires or money.\" 85 These villeins probably originally consisted of con. quered Britons39, but as criminals who could not pay the fines to which they were subject by law were degraded to this state, many of the Saxon invaders no doubt became included in the class, even before the Normans came.97 After their arrival it was common for the Normans to make slaves of the Saxons. These Thralls or Villeins were, in some cases, attached by law to the soil, and could not be removed from it, but they always belonged to the owner, for the time being, of that particular estate. Others, who were called villeins in gross, were the personal property"], [140, "100 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND. Villeinage. Ceorls, or Churls, of the lord23, and could be sold by him, as he would sell his horses or his cattle, and if a villein was mur dered, the fine which was paid for murdering a man was paid to the lord who was his owner.4298 These slaves were so numerous as to form a considerable branch of English commerce.99 An author, who lived in the reign of Henry the Second, informs us, that such a number of them was exported to Ireland, that the market there was absolutely glutted ; and another declares that, from the reign of William the Conqueror to that of King John, there was scarce a cottage in Scotland that did not possess an English slave.85 A man who held land in villeinage did so on con dition of rendering such services as were usually rendered by villeins, or, as described by a learned lawyer of the time of Henry the Third, \" Pure vil leinage is where a man holds on terms of doing what soever is commanded of him, nor knows in the evening what is to be done in the morning.\" 43 Every man was bound to place himself in dependance upon some man of rank and wealth, as his lord. A \" lord less \" man was liable to be slain as an outlaw by any one who met him.41 It is thus expressed in the laws of King Athelstan : \" And we have ordained, respecting those lordless men of whom no law can be got, that the kindred be com manded that they domicile him, and find him a lord in the folk-mote ; and if they then cannot or will not produce him at the term, then be he thenceforth a 'flyma' (that is a man who has fled for his offence), and let him slay him for a thief who can come at him.'-70a The next class were called Ceorls, or as we should say, Churls.100 These were freemen.

Both councils were constituted of the superior orders of the King's tenants or vassals, together with archbishops, and bishops, and abbots of the principal monasteries.101 On some occasions in ferior members of the clergy were summoned. The superior clergy always formed part of the council of wise men \u00b0 ; for, in those times, they were the best educated part of the nation, and the law formed an especial branch of their studies.

Commons both sprang. It is difficult to say when the House of Commons first began, or when the Lords and Commons first formed two separate Houses. But it seems clear that no House of Commons, such as we have at the present day, existed before the reign of Henry the Third ; for, as we shall presently see, it was not until that reign that cities and boroughs sent representatives to Parliament. It is not at all certain, and indeed it is unlikely, that, in its present form, it even then existed separately from the House of Lords. It is difficult to say at what time the two Houses were formally separated, yet from the earliest times, after the admission of repre sentatives from towns, the three bodies forming the Parliament often consulted separately, and always voted separately. Their chief business was to grant sums of money to the King. The Bishops granted money from their own body, and the Lords and the Commons did the like. The Commons could not have granted money out of the property of the Lords or of the Bishops.88, 89 In the present day it is the House of Commons that votes money from, or taxes the whole community. But it was not so then, and it was not so until a much later period. House of Lords and House of Commons. The three classes forming Parliament always voted separately.

But during the reign of Henry the Third, if not earlier, all freeholders were entitled to vote.47 Still it was only the counties that were represented. It was not until the year a.d. 1265, that towns were represented. In that year Simon de Montfort, after the battle of Lewes, issued writs to the Sheriffs directing them to return two knights for each county, and two citizens or burgesses for every city and borough.

He thus made them to some extent responsible for the mea sures which were taken to find money for the King. I have now traced the origin of our present Houses of Lords and Commons, but I must say a little more about their forming two separate Houses. It is difficult, as I have said, to find out exactly when the House of Commons was formally separated from the House of Lords ; but the fact that they were thus separated is of great importance. There can be no doubt that the necessity for all measures, except the levying of taxes, being debated in both Houses, ensures a fuller consideration of all that is brought before them. It also prevents the rise of a despotic power, which would be sure to spring up from the uncontrolled authority of a single chamber. It is of importance too that there are only two Houses of deliberation. There might have been three Houses. It would not have been an unnatural proposal that the lords should sit in one House, the county members in another, and the representatives of towns in a third. But had this been the case, class would have been set against class, and endless con tests would have been the result. There is, lastly, one more peculiarity of our Parliamentary System, and it is this, viz., That although we have an heredi tary aristocracy it is not entirely separated from the people.

It is useful for every man to know something about these matters now, but it is very interesting to find out what was the beginning of them. Origin ofthe Laws of England. Now, I must begin by telling you that there is no The King maxim of early law, so often repeated, as that \" The jj^faT King is the fountain of all law and of all iustice.\" k^and iustice Bracton, a learned lawyer of the time of Henry the Third, whose reign I mean to tell you about in my next lecture, says, \" The King would have been bound, by his coronation oath, himself to deal out justice to his people, if such a task could have been performed by him; but, as he could not do this, it was his duty to appoint able men as justices, sheriffs, and ministers to do it for him.\" 31 The earliest code or body of laws of which we Theeariiest hear in our history, was that of Ethelbert, King of Kent, about the year a.d. 600.103 In imitation of the laws- Romans, on whose laws most of our early laws were founded, he issued his decrees, and his Gewitena gemote or council of wise men, of which I have told you, gave him its advice on them.4 It thus appears that it was the King who brought matters before the wise men, and that they only gave their advice on such matters as he brought before them. Indeed, so far was the maxim carried, \" That the King was the fountain of all law,\" that it was even admitted that, \"AVhatsoever pleased the King had all the force of law.\" 5 In this code of Ethelbert, almost every kind of injury might be compounded for by a pay ment in money.3 A certain sum of money was to be I 2"], [150, "110 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND.

After a time such crimes were subject to other punishments, and after a further time they were again atoned for by a payment in money.32 Laws of After Ethelbert's code of laws the most important Edward the was that of Canute. In this were embodied the laws of and w\"' Ine KinS of Wessex, in a.d. 688, of Alfred, Edgar, and Ham the Canute's other predecessors.7 \" The laws of Edward Conqueror. l the Confessor are constantly referred to in the dis- putes between the King and his subjects ; but this does not mean new laws, made by Edward, but laws which were in use in his time.8 The laws of William the Conqueror were founded on those of Canute. How the Laws were enforced. These codes consisted of the unwritten or common law and custom of the kingdom, collected together in one body for use. I must now tell you how, Shire- from the earliest Anglo-Saxon times, the laws were motes, or put in force. I have already told you that, in Alfred's county *, ... courts; time, England was divided into counties or shires, motes, or and these were again divided into hundreds and cou\"ts; and tlthings.

The Eorl was, however, always assisted by one of the clergy, a class of men, as I have before said, who were well acquainted with the law. This as sistant was obliged to bring with him the Dom-boc, or Doom-book, or Book of Laws, in order that, when necessary, he might explain from it the law applicable to any particular case. \" King Edward commands all the reeves (or officers) : that ye judge such just doom as ye know to be most righteous, and it in the dom-boc stands.\"68 \" And let the hundred-gemot be attended as it was before fixed ; and thrice in the year let a burh-gemot be held ; and twice a shire-gemot ; and let there be present, the bishop of the shire and the ealdorman, and there both expound as well the Law of God as the secular Law.\" n No witnesses were examined before these courts, for, as the thanes who formed the court came from the neighbourhood, it was supposed that they themselves knew all the facts of each case. The knowledge of writing at that time was uncommon ; agreements were consequently made before other persons, and thus the knowledge of many private businesses was more widely spread and impressed on the memory. If there was a difference of opinion, that doom in which eight agreed was held to stand. \" And let doom stand where thanes are of one voice : if they disagree, let that stand which eight of them say.

It is difficult to understand the justice of this rule ; but it must have been sup posed, as these thanes gave judgment according to their own knowledge, that those who were in the minority gave a judgment contrary to their own knowledge, and therefore a false judgment. The necessity for juries all agreeing, in the present day, probably sprang from this practice. The sheriff There was always present at these courts a King's pr?senrayS officer, called a shire-gerefa, or shire-reeve, or sheriff, whose duty it was to collect the fines fees and for- feitures due to the King. This shire-gerefa often acted as the deputy of the Eorl, and after the Conquest, he nearly always acted in his stead.14 The King If any especial case of importance needed to be issued writs i00ked into 14, the King issued an order to that effect to in impor- ' _ \u00b0 tant cases, the thanes, which was called a writ or precept, and, in the present day, such writs are, as you most likely know, issued by the judges in the Queen's name. The King's Court. These three courts, viz. the county court, the burg mote or town court, and the hundred court, took cognisance of both civil and criminal cases. That is, they rendered justice in cases where one man had deceived or cheated another, and in cases where one man had robbed or beaten another, and so forth.

It probably always formed a part of the court of state which every Anglo-Saxon sovereign held on his birth day, and at other fixed times. At this court all his vassals, including the eorls, King's thanes, principal officers of state, and even ceorls who held office under the King, were bound to attend.12 The King had many palaces within his kingdom, at his various vills or manors, and used to hold his court, and celebrate the high festivals of the year, at one or other of them as he thought fit.91 At these courts, besides adminis tering justice, the King consulted with the great men Court os State held on the King's birthday. at one of his palaces.

This portion of the business of the King's Council was, after a time, managed by the separate court, which I am now explaining to you, called the King's Court. The law was administered in this, and other provincial courts, by officers called Justices ; and in the reign of William the Conqueror an officer was appointed to preside over them, who was called the Chief or Grand Justiciary, or chief of the Justices. He was a person of very great im portance. He was viceroy in the absence of the King, and writs were issued in his name. He was usually a dignitary of the church.24 The King's Court divided into oilier courts. In William the Conqueror's reign, all business relating to the royal revenue was taken away from the King's Court, and transacted in a court called the Court of Exchequer, which was formed after the model of a similar court in Normandy. The Grand Justiciary, and the Chancellor, (about whom I shall tell you presently,) who had the charge of the King's great seal, and such of the King's barons and \u2022dignitaries of the Church as the King chose for the purpose, attended.

The Cou:t of King's Bench. Chancellor of the Exchequer when a vacancy occurs.26 This court was called the Exchequer, from the che quered cloth, resembling a chess-board, which covered the table there, and on which, when certain of the King's accounts were made up, the sums were marked and scored by counters.90 In King John's reign, another branch of business was removed from the King's Court. By one of the articles of Magna Charta it was declared that those injuries called common pleas, that is, pleas or com plaints relative to land, or to injuries merely civil, such as a debt owed by one man to another, should no longer follow the King.28 That is, they should not be tried in the King's Court, which at that time followed the King from place to place in his progresses through the kingdom. From thence forward such causes were tried at Westminster in a court called the Court of Common Pleas, and from that time the King's Court was called the Court of King's Bench, because the King used to sit there in person. It continued to be, and still is, the superior court of law of importance in all matters of Common and Criminal Law, and in many other matters. The thi^ee courts I have described, viz., The Court of Exchequer, the Court of Common Pleas, and the Court of King's Bench, were, and are, the principal Courts of Justice in the realm for the administration of the common law. Formerly, each of these courts had a separate jurisdiction. The King's Bench heard principally criminal causes, and certain others, such as trespass accompanied by violence, and also such as related to the controlling of inferior courts; the Common Pleas was for trials of disputes between subject and sub-"], [156, "116 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND.

Curious contrivances were however resorted to in order to bring causes, which properly belonged to one court, to be tried in another, and as judges in those days received fees as payment for causes tried in their own courts, they willingly sanctioned various devices for bringing additional cases within the limits of their jurisdiction. This shifting of business from one court to another was managed in this way.29 The judge of the Court of Exchequer had no right to try a cause relative to a debt owed by one man to another, which, as I have before said, belonged to the Court of Common Pleas. But, by a legal fiction, the judge ofthe Court of Ex chequer managed thus to get it into his own court : The creditor was allowed to plead, that is, to allege that he owed money to the King, and that he could not pay the King, unless he were paid the debt that was due to himself. Now, the Court of Exchequer had to do with all cases relative to money due to the King ; and such a cause, therefore, was by this con trivance allowed to be tried in that court, if the com plainant wished it. In like manner, the Court of King's Bench managed, by the following device, to extend its jurisdiction so as to try all civil cases \u2014 that is cases relative to rights of property, actions for debt, and so on. It was entitled to try such cases when the defendant was already a prisoner in the custody of the court for some offence within its"], [157, "POWERS OF COURT OF KING'S BENCH. 117 The Court of King's Bench controls all other courts whatso ever, proper jurisdiction. The complainant therefore, who wished his cause to be tried in the Court of King's Bench, alleged that the defendant was in the custody of that court, though in fact he was not, and the court never inquired into the truth of the statement. These contrivances were not put an end to until the reign of William the Fourth, when an Act of Parliament was passed giving direct jurisdiction in civil cases to the Courts of King's Bench and Ex chequer, so that a private person may now bring his action in any one of these courts. The Court of King's Bench has special exclusive Power. But the Court of King's Bench, or, as of course it is now called, the Court of Queen's Bench, still has special exclusive powers, in certain cases. It keeps all inferior courts within the bounds of their authority, and may either order their proceedings to be removed for its own consideration, or, where they exceed their jurisdiction, stop their progress entirely.53 Thus, if the Lord Mayor's Court, in the City of London, which is a borough court, or court for the recovery of debts within the city, were to attempt to try a case relative to property in land, the Court of King's Bench would stop the proceedings immediately, by a writ of prohi bition. Or, if a cause which properly belonged to the Lord Mayor's Court, involved any important principle which might more conveniently be tried in a superior court, the Court of King's Bench would, by a writ of certiorari, (that is, by a writ commanding the inferior court to certify, or return the records of the cause before them) immediately remove the cause into its"], [158, "118 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND. ana com pels magis trates and others to do what the law re- quires. Common law courts. own court, if either of the contending parties wish it. This court also controls all civil corporations, and compels magistrates and others to do what the law requires in every case where there is no other course prescribed.53 Thus, if an Act of Parliament directed that some particular city should maintain in good repair a certain bridge, and the city neglected to do it, the Court of King's Bench would issue a writ called a mandamus (which means, we command), compelling the city to do what Parliament had required. Again, if some person, not duly elected as Lord Mayor, insisted on acting in that character, the Court of King's Bench would issue a writ called a quo ivarranto (which means, by what warrant or autho rity do you thus act ?), to prevent his so doing. All the courts of which I have now given you an account are called the Common Law Courts. Common law meant originally, the ancient unwritten law of the kingdom, grounded on the general customs of the realm, but it now also includes the laws founded on Acts of Parliament, and it has been defined, \" the whole of that code, whether founded on statute, usage, or precedent, which is now administered in the Common Law Courts of Westminster Hall.\" This definition also comprehends the law admi nistered in various local courts. Its peculiar cha racteristic is, that questions of fact arising out of its proceedings are submitted to the decision of a jury.84 There were also inferior courts, called Manor Courts, or Courts Baron, which were principally for determin ing disputes relative to Jand. But they also fre quently administered justice in general, civil, and criminal cases. \" The bishops, abbots, earls, king's thanes,\" and all"], [159, "119 ORIGIN OF LAW CIRCUITS. Originally the King carried justice all over the kingdom. who possessed estates known by the name of manors, exercised, from the time of Edward the Confessor, a jurisdiction similar to that of the county and hundred courts. The judges were the free tenants of lands within the manor, and those who held lands of the manor, or who, as vassals of the lord, were bound to attend his court. Innumerable instances of persons having the right to hold these manor courts, with civil and criminal jurisdiction, are to be met with in Domesday Book and other documents of the* Anglo- Saxon times, and in early Norman documents.16 These courts have now fallen into almost entire disuse, and their primitive jurisdiction is restricted within very narrow limits. Further Arrangements for Administration of Justice rendered necessary by the Superior Courts sitting at Westminster only. We have now traced the history of the various courts of law, and we have seen that, originally, jus tice followed the King ; that is, that in his progress through the kingdom, the King was attended by a council, which helped him to manage the affairs of state, and to administer justice. We have seen that, after a time, various courts of justice were separated from this council, and that instead of following the King over the country, they were fixed at Westmin ster. We must now see how justice was thencefor ward administered throughout the kingdom.

Judges of In the reign of Edward the First these itinerant justices became, under commissions issued by the Crown, Judges of Assize, that is, they held what we now call \" the Assizes,\" at the various towns. The word Assizes is derived from a Norman-French word (assises, session) meaning to sit down together, be- cause the judges held their \"sittings\" to administer"], [161, "JUDGES ON CIRCUITS. 121 Judges of Nisi Prius.

It was still considered that Westminster Avas the proper place for the administration of justice, and these judges were said to be sent to try by a jury of the respective counties, the truth of such matters of fact as were then under dispute in the Courts at Westminster Hall.65 All actions, that is, all proceedings at law for the redress of injuries, began by issuing a writ, and these writs always were, and still are, issued from the Courts at Westminster and are returnable there. That is, these causes would, in the common course of things, be tried at Westminster, in the court from which the writ issued, and whereto it should be returned, and they were therefore said to be matters under dispute in the Courts at Westminster. But it was provided that they should only be tried there nisi prius, that is, \" unless previously \" (for that is the meaning of these Latin words), to the day ap pointed for the trial, the Judges of Assize came into the county, where the matter \" under dispute \" originated, to try the cause.66 A commission still issues from the crown, empowering the judges and a few other persons associated with them in the commission, to try causes in their circuits. These judges had also, and still have, what is called a general commission of gaol delivery. This gave them the power to try and deliver from prison every- one who might be in gaol when the judges arrived at the circuit town. This practice is very properly described by Black stone as one \" of singular use and excellence.'\"' 67 In many foreign countries, even at the present day, men may be kept in prisons and dungeons for years, with-"], [162, "122 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND.

But by this practice the gaols are cleared, and all prisoners tried, punished, or delivered twice at least in every year, for these circuits are now made twice in each year, and sometimes oftener. The well-known, and most important act, called the Habeas Corpus Act, by which men detained any where against their will, are entitled to be brought before a judge, in order that he may decide whether they are detained in lawful custody, will be noticed in a subsequent lecture, as it was not passed until the reign of Charles the First. The Judges of Assize, you thus see, go on these circuits instead of the Sovereign, and by virtue of the commission issued by the Sovereign they may be said to represent the Sovereign. They therefore are, and always have been, received in the counties with great state. They are attended by the high sheriff, accompanied, till lately, by javelin men, or men carrying javelins. This is a sketch of the origin of our judges going on circuit and holding assizes in the present day. Criminals, or breakers of the law or of the peace of the kingdom, are now, and for several centuries have been, in the first instance brought before the Justices of the Peace, or inferior magistrates ; and, if there is considered to be sufficient evidence against them, the magistrates commit them to prison, where they remain until the judges come on circuit for the trial of all prisoners. Justices of the peace, as magistrates are properly termed, were first appointed in the reign of Edward the Third. There were, previously, officers appointed as wardens, or keepers of the peace ; but in the reign"], [163, "123 TRIAL BY JURY. of Edward the Third the power of trying felonies was granted to them, and they then acquired the more honourable name of Justices. Justices of the peace, or magistrates, hold various sessions or sittings for the transaction of business, the principal of which are the Quarter Sessions, which must be held four times a year. The powers granted to the Justices of the peace by Edward the Third are now somewhat diminished.62 Trial by Jury. I have now told you how our laws were made, and Guilty or how they were put in force, by which you see whose duty it was to punish the guilty. But we have to examine next the very important question, \"how is an accused man found to be guilty or innocent ? \" In order to do this, I must endeavour to trace out the history of the Trial by Jury, a system of the highest value to a nation, with the possession of which for the trial of criminal cases, no country can be enslaved, and without which no country can be free. The value of trial by jury consists in two great Value of . . Trial by principles. First, that the guilt or innocence of a jury de prisoner is determined by a body of men, who have f,y\"dl\u00b0at nothing to do with the infliction of the punishment, principies. and not by the judge who awards the punishment, or by the officers appointed to carry the sentence into execution.

They rose by degrees, from small beginnings. The necessities of some particular circumstance induced men to take a certain course. A similar circumstance occurred; the recollection of a former successful result of the course previously taken induced men again to take the same course. This at last became a constant habit in all similar cases, but, in cases differing slightly, a slightly dif ferent course was taken. Thus Mr. Starkie, an eminent lawyer 33a, says, that no definite answer can be given to the question, \" When did Trial by Jury begin? \" and that it can be answered only by tracing the different steps by which it arrived at its present form. If we considered that the only peculiarity of Trial by Jury was, that those who pro nounce the sentence should be distinct from those who carry the sentence into execution, we should come to the conclusion that Trial by Jury existed in the earliest Anglo-Saxon times.48 For it is quite certain that in the hundred courts, of which I have told you, the assembled thanes, or lords, who pro nounced the sentence, were quite distinct from the Eorl and Shire-gerefa, who carried the sentence into execution. But there is something more than this in the system of Trial by Jury, viz., that those who pronounce the verdict shall be the prisoner's equals, and this great and most valuable principle of the whole system of English law is nowhere distinctly recognised until the granting of Magna Charta. I believe that when that great bulwark of our freedom was granted, Trial by Jury was distinctly recognised, although it was, even then, not quite in the form in No exact time can be fixed when Trial by Jury began. Those who pronounce the verdict must be the prisoner's equals, first esta blished by Magna Charta."], [165, "125 ANCIENT FORMS OF TRIAL. Grand Jury and Common Jury. Grand Jury exist ed about a.d. 978. which it now exists. I will, however, endeavour to track out the progress of this system of trial from the earliest time at which we can find any trace of it. Tivo Ivinds of Juries. I must begin by reminding you that, as you pro bably know, there are, in criminal cases, two kinds of juries, the Grand Jury, and the Common Jury. It is the business of the Grand Jury to say whether there is sufficient ground for sending a prisoner to trial at all, but it is the business of the Common Jury to say, when the trial comes, whether a man is guilty or innocent. The origin of the Grand Jury is clearer than that of the Common Jury. The Grand Jury can be distinctly traced in the reign of Ethelred the Unready, son of Edgar, and great-grandson of Alfred. This was about the year a.d. 1000, or above 800 years ago. In Ethelred's code of laws, it is ordained, that, at the assemblage of the hundred courts, \"the twelve eldest thanes shall go out, and the shire-reeve with them, and shall swear on the relic that is given to them in hand, that they will accuse no innocent man, nor conceal any guilty one.\" 73 This seems to be, in principle, the Grand Jury of our days, which is in substance a kind of inquest or inquiry into the state of crime of the district, for the purpose of referring to trial such cases as, upon inquiry, appear to require that more solemn and practical method of inves tigation. But the origin of trial by Common Jury is not so easy to make out. When the twelve thanes returned to the rest of the body, the whole body of thanes, K 2"], [166, "126 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND. after taking their solemn oath, proceeded with their examination of the prisoners. Now you will recollect that I told you that the system on which they pro ceeded was like our modern system thus far, viz., The that the thanes who pronounced the sentence were whopro- distinct from the officer who put the sentence in nounced execution. But even thus far there was in the the sen- m _ . tence were proceedings an important difference from the Trial by from the Jury of the present day.

We must therefore reach a later period of our history before we can say that the modern system of Trial by Jury was established. The Institutions of the Anglo-Saxons promoted Personal Knowledge of Facts occurring in each District. The system In order to carry you on to the next step I pledge! must remind you of that curious system, called Frank-pledge, which I very fully described to you in my last lecture. You will remember that according to this system, if an offence was committed in a tything, or district in which ten families dwelt, all the men of the tything were answerable for it, unless they could bring the offender to justice. Even now,"], [167, "ANCIENT FORMS OF TRIAL. 127 When the system of Frank- pledge was given up, witnesses became necessary, Trial by Compur gation. in certain cases where property is destroyed by the violence of lawless persons, whom the officers of the law have failed to restrain, the hundred, in which the crime is committed, is bound to compensate the injured person for the damage done to his property. The modern system of entering into recognizances, or making suspected persons find particular and special securities for their future conduct, is very ancient, and came into use as the system of Frank pledge went out of use. In those days, also, there were many difficulties in the way of a man moving about from one place to another. The thanes of the neighbourhood were therefore likely to know everything connected with any offence committed in their district. But, after a time, this system of Frank-pledge gradually decayed, and it then became necessary that the thanes should hear from others the facts relative to any particular offence. This was one step towards the modern system of witnesses.49 This imperfect Trial by Jury was applied only to Civil and not to Criminal Cases. The system of the thanes deciding as to an offence according to their own knowledge, or that of others, was applied principally, or entirely, to cases in which the title to landed property was concerned. In cases of crime, such as robbery, or murder, the thanes adopted another and very remarkable system. In these cases a prisoner was tried by Compurgation, or by Ordeal, or by Battle. In the Trial by Compurgation, so called from a Latin word, meaning to clear or purify, the accused K 3"], [168, "128 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND. was bound to clear himself by producing neighbours to swear to their belief of his innocence. The value of the oaths was estimated by the worth of those who made them in the Anglo-Saxon scale of persons ; that is, according to the amount to be paid if they were murdered. The number of oaths was reckoned up. If the accused produced the number required by the law, he was set free; if not, the thanes who looked on pronounced him guilty.50 The Trial by Battle was used only in simple cases of one man demanding justice against another. In this Trial by Battle. Ordeal Combat, or Trial by Battle. (Koyal MSS., 14 E, IIL) form of trial, the justice or innocence of the accused was determined by single combat. It is a remarkable fact, that the trial by battle, though long disused, was not formally abolished until the fifty-ninth year of the reign of George the Third, that is, in 1819. The Trial by Ordeal was of a singular, and indeed impious nature. It was founded on the idea that Providence would interfere to protect an innocent man, and would enable him to bear, without hurt, Trial by Ordeal."], [169, "129 TRIAL BY ORDEAL. some extraordinary suffering ; and that, therefore, by the infliction of suffering greater than a man could naturally bear, you could compel the inter position of Providence. \" The ordeal was considered a religious ceremony, and was of several kinds. The two principal were by water and iron; by water hot or cold, and by hot iron. The person, the water, and the iron were prepared under the direction of the priest by exor cisms and other formalities, and the whole conducted with great solemnity. For three days before the trial the culprit was to attend the priest, to be constant at mass, to make his offering, and in the meantime to sustain himself on nothing but bread, salt, water, and onions. On the day of trial he was to take the sacrament and swear that he was not guilty of or privy to the crime imputed to him. The accuser and accused were to come to the place of trial attended with not more than twelve persons each. \" The accuser was then to renew his charge upon oath, and the accused to proceed in making his purgation. If it was by hot water, he was to put his hand into it or his whole arm, according to the degree of the offence ; if it was by cold water, his thumbs were tied to his toes, and in this posture he was thrown into it. If he escaped unhurt by the boiling water, which might easily be contrived by the art of the priests, or if he sunk in the cold water, which would certainly happen, he was declared in nocent. If he was hurt by the boiling water, or swam in the cold, he was considered as guilty. \" If the trial was to be by the hot iron, his hand was first sprinkled with holy water ; then taking the K 4"], [170, "130 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND. In the reign of Henry the Second Trial by Jury was further advanced. iron in his hand, he walked nine feet. The method of taking his steps was particularly and curiously appointed. At the end of the stated distance he threw down the iron and hastened to the altar ; then his hand was bound up for three days, at the end of which time it was to be opened ; and from the appearance of any hurt or not, he was declared in the former case guilty, and in the latter acquitted. Another method of applying this trial by hot iron was by placing red hot ploughshares at certain dis tances and requiring the delinquent to walk over them, which, if he performed unhurt, was considered as a proof of his innocence. \" These trials by water and fire were called Judicia Dei, or the Judgments of God.\" 93 These are only some of the many and very curious forms of ordeal. The thanes looked on, and gave their verdict according to the behaviour of the prisoner. It is obvious that this was a most unsatisfactory mode of determining a man's guilt or innocence, and it led to great trickery and imposture. Nevertheless it con tinued in practice for many years. Trial by Twelve sworn Knights first introduced by Henry the Second. In the reign of Henry the Second the Trial by Jury was advanced one step further, but only as regards matters relating to landed property. It was then settled that such matters should be tried by twelve sworn knights. This was considered a great privi lege, and was extended to criminals on payment of a certain sum of money to the King.51, 52 Here we have the Trial by Jury, but not the trial by equals; and the"], [171, "131 TRIAL BY JURY. Trial by Jury at length fully established by Magna Charta. Trial by Jury, such as it then was, was limited in criminal cases to those who could afford to pay for such a luxury. For the others, Trial by Ordeal was adopted, but after a time that system of trial was forbidden, and in the year a.d. 1215, the year before the granting of the Great Charter, it was formally abolished. Trial by Compurgation had been done away with by the Normans soon after their arrival, and Trial by Battle was suited to peculiar cases only. The Trial by Jury, therefore, as established by Henry the Second, became general in criminal as well as other cases. At last it was provided by the Magna Charta granted by King John, that no man should be con demned but by the lawful judgment of his peers or equals. In the words of Magna Charta, it was en acted that \" no freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or disseised, or outlawed, or banished, or any ways destroyed, nor will we pass upon him, nor will we send upon him, unless by the lawful judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land.\" Here the great principle of Trial by Jury is distinctly recognised. It is not exactly the modern system, for it does not appear that witnesses were at that time brought before the juries, and there is no distinct evidence of such being the practice for two hundred years afterwards.48 Never theless the two great principles on which the system rested, viz., first, the separation of the jury from the judge, and secondly, the pronouncing the guilt or innocence of the prisoner by the verdict of his equals, were established at the time that the Magna Charta was granted, and it is unnecessary in the present place to trace the history of the changes until it arrived exactly at its present form."], [172, "132 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND. I cannot, however, leave the subject of Trial by Jury, without again expressing my opinion of its value, particularly in criminal cases, and summing up its special advantages. It secures, as far as is possible, an honest verdict, it educates the people in the laws of the country, it compels a judge to attend carefully to a trial, as he has to sum up all the facts to the jury, and it renders impossible the corruption or despotism of a judge.

So great was the respect paid to this court, that, in ancient times, it was considered by the humbler classes, and by the oppressed generally, that the head of this court had the power of giving redress for every kind of injury and injustice, whether the Common Law provided a remedy or not.38 This high and mighty court was called the Court of Chancery ; and I must now endeavour to trace out how this great court arose, and when it obtained its high powers. Origin of the Court of Chancery. The King In the earliest times of our history, as I have told secPretareda J7011' personally was applied to for the"], [173, "133 ORIGIN OF THE COURT OF CHANCERY. redress of injuries. It was impossible for the King himself to attend to all such applications. Conse quently he appointed wise men under him to look to them. But still, it was necessary for the King to have a secretary to assist him in bringing these complaints under the notice of the wise men, and in other matters of business.106 Writs (that is, written precepts or orders) also had to be issued summoning the adversary, against whom the complaint was made, to appear before the wise men, and forms were adopted to be used in like cases. An office, or chamber, in which such business should be transacted, also was necessary. The office was called The Chancery, and the secretary was called The Chancellor. The name of Chancery was given to this office, because the Secretary, who sat in the office, had his seat in a kind of inner chamber, divided from the rest of the office by a sort of lattice work, called in Latin can celli, from which the word \" chancery \" is derived. The chancel of a church is derived from the same word, and is applied to a part of the church which is railed off. It is supposed by some, that the word \"chancellor\" is derived from another Latin word meaning to cancel, because the Chancellor some times cancelled the proceedings of other courts. But inasmuch as the secretary was called a Chancellor before the Lord Chancellor performed such duties, it seems clear that the derivation of the name from the place where he sat is the correct one. But, whatever may have been the derivation of the name, the King had a secretary, who was called a Chancellor. With out attempting to trace the existence of a Chancellor up to a more remote time, it is certain that the Anglo- Saxon monarchs, from Ethelbert downwards, had whose office was called The Chancery, and hence the secre tary was called a Chancellor, Anglo- Saxon Kings had Chancel lors."], [174, "134 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND. The Chan- such an officer.54 The secretary or Chancellor, at ginaTiywas first, was always a dignitary of the church. When aJ..\u2122|sa the Anglo-Saxons were converted to Christianity by St. Augustine, in the reign of King Ethelbert, the King had his own chapel and his own priest, who was always near his person, who acted as his confessor, and who took care of his chapel.55 This person Avas undoubtedly much better educated than the Anglo- Saxon laymen who attended on the King. On the conversion of Ethelbert, he probably selected as his priest one of the Italian missionaries who came over with St. Augustine, and who must have possessed much more knowledge than the Anglo-Saxons. The priest being constantly near his person, and being a well-educated man, naturally acquired the King's confidence, and we find that the King made him his secretary, and not only employed him in matters of common business, but consulted him in matters of state. I have told you in what way this secre- tary came to be called Chancellor. Now, the Chan- The Chan- cellor, or priest-secretary, being the King's confessor, came the became the keeper of the King's conscience, and, Jjfej\u00a3jn\u00b0fs although the Chancellor is not now a priest, nor has conscience, been since Cardinal Wolsey, he is still to the present day called the keeper of the King's conscience.

In very early times the King himself had the power of mitigating the severity of the law, for we find in the Laws of King Edgar, \" If the law be too heavy,"], [175, "135 THE SYSTEM OF CIVIL LAW. Civil Law founded on Roman Law, let him seek a mitigation of it from the King.\" 71 It was always a maxim that the King could not inten tionally do any wrong, and that therefore if any of his subjects suffered wrong from being unable to obtain justice in the courts of law, the King, if he only knew of this, would set the wrong to rights.64 The Chan cellor, consequently, as keeper of the King's con science, was bound to see that the King did no wrong, or if inadvertently he did wrong, the Chan cellor advised him how to act, or acted for him. The Law administered in the Court of Chancery is founded on the Roman Law. As the Lord Chancellor was almost always, for several centuries, an ecclesiastic, he was well versed in the principles of the Roman law, which then formed a leading subject of study with the clergy. The Roman Empire, which so long governed the world, reached a high state of civilisation, and gradually perfected an elaborate and enlightened system of law, which is contained in books which have come down to our times. This system, which is called the Civil Law, in contradistinction to the Com mon Law (which I have already explained to you), is superior in many respects to the ruder and more imperfect laws of our ancestors, and from it the Chancellors mainly drew the principles which they applied with great success to regulate those transac tions between man and man which could not, consis tently with justice, be settled by the rules of the Common Law of the realm.

Court of Chancery prevents Examples of Remedies provided by Court of Chancery. I have told you that one of the principal objects of the Court of Chancery, was to temper the rigour and severity of the other courts of law. It was found that the strict law, as administered in the other courts, was not always in complete accordance with justice. Suppose, for instance, the owner of an estate should borrow money on it, and give up his estate to the lender, on condition that if he repaid the money in twelve months the estate should be given back to him. Well, he might not be able to repay the money in twelve months, but in a year and a half he might be in a position to do so. According to Common Law, the lender of the money might keep the estate, although it might be worth ten times more than the money lent. This would be most unjust, and the Court of Chancery would interfere and compel the restoration of the estate on repayment of the money with interest. Again, suppose, in old times, the owner of an estate was going to the Crusades. It would be necessary that, in his absence, some person should act as the owner and perform such feudal services as fell on the owner of the estate. To secure the performance of these duties, he might entrust his estate to some friend, and convey it to him on the promise that it should be restored to him on his return. If his friend proved false and would not give back the estate, the Courts of Common Law afforded no redress, but the Court of Chancery enforced the trust and compelled the restoration of the estate to the rightful owner.

Let us suppose, for instance, that I learned that one of my neighbours was beginning to erect close to my dwelling a manufactory of some unhealthy and offen sive nature that would be a nuisance. Instead of waiting until he had done it, I should at once apply to the Court of Chancery, and the Lord Chancellor would issue an injunction, and thus restrain the further building of the manufactory if I could make good my complaint. If I were to wait till the build ing was completed and at work, I could then get damages for the nuisance in a Court of Common Law, but that would be no compensation to me, and therefore this power of the Court of Chancery is of the utmost value. Undermining a house, changing the course of a stream, digging a mine under another man's land, are similar injuries which the Court of Chancery would prevent. The changes in the duties of the Chancellor were so gradual, that it is difficult to say when the Court of Chancery became a separate and distinct court, but it seems that it was not till the end of the reign of Henry the Third, that the supremacy of the office was established.56 It is not my intention at present to trace the changes of the Court of Chancery beyond this period, as it will find a more appropriate place as we advance in the history, and when I treat of the improvement of our laws, which, I have told you, I shall do at a future time.

This practice appears to me to have been very beneficial. On the one hand, it secured the assistance of a body ofthe best educated men of the time, in the adminis tration of the law, and, on the other, it prevented the clergy from being separated from all temporal matters, and thus dissevered from their flocks in all but spiritual concerns. Clergy joined with the laity in law matters in England from the earliest times. William the Con queror When William the Conqueror became King of England, \" he directed that no bishop or archdeacon should for the future hear complaints relative to church matters in the county or hundred court, but that all such pleas should be determined before the bishop, wheresoever he should appoint, according to the canon and ecclesiastical laws, and forbad all laymen from interfering in such matters. To this ordinance the civil jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts which now exist throughout the kingdom owes its origin.\"25,26 Church matters were thus ad ministered in a separate court, but it was not long before an attempt was made to withdraw church men, separated the ecclesi astical from the civil jurisdic tion, and thus our ecclesi astical courts begar."], [181, "141 THE CANON LAW.

This separation of jurisdiction over ecclesiastical matters from the civil courts was the cause of con stant disputes between the Kings and the Popes, and between the clergy and the laity. \u2022 In considering these important events, it is well to remember that all England was then Roman Catholic, and that it was Roman Catholic kings of England, and a Roman Catholic laity, who disputed the usurpations of the Pope and the Roman Catholic clergy. \" When the spiritual court was once divided from the temporal, different principles and maxims began to prevail in that tribunal. The bishop,\" who was the head of the Spiritual Court, \" thought it no ways unsuitable that subjects of a different nature from those concerning which the temporal courts decided should be adjudged by different laws.\" He therefore introduced the Canon Law, according to which the law in the spiritual courts on the continent of Europe was administered, and which was so called, because it was there called the Codex Canonum vetus Ecclesi\u00e6 Romance, or ancient code of the canons (or rules) of the Roman Church. It is probable that these ancient canons originally were not so prejudicial to the rights of the sovereign and the state. They were intro duced into this country by permission of the go vernment, and it seemed expedient so to do. The existence of a church with various grades of ministers seemed to demand a special system of law. But the body of canon law soon exceeded all reasonable bounds. \" Instead of confining their regulations to sacred things, the canonists laid down rules for the ordering of all matters of a different nature, whether L 2"], [182, "142 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND.

The buying and selling of land, leasing, mortgaging, the prosecution and punishment of murder, theft, and many other objects of temporal judicature, are provided for by the canon law ; by which, and by which alone, it was meant that the clergy should be governed as a distinct people from the laity.\" 93a \" The Emperor Constantine had thought that the irregularities of an order of men, devoted to the affairs of religion, should be veiled from the scru tinising eye of the people. With this view, he granted to each bishop, if he were accused of violating the law, the liberty of being tried by his own colleagues ; and moreover invested him with a criminal jurisdic tion over his own clergy.\" 77 \" The Canon Law was founded on the Roman civil law, and could not exist without it 93b, and the study of the civil law was, in the time of the Normans and their immediate successors, almost confined to the clergy. Thus armed with an almost exclusive know ledge of these elaborate systems of law, the clergy ventured to encounter the established authority of municipal law, whose dictates were very opposite to their schemes of ecclesiastical sovereignty.\" 93\u00b0 \" In the reign of Stephen a very complete collection of Canon Law was made, containing many extrava gant opinions, all tending to exalt the clerical state, and exempt the clergy from secular law. 93e Lectures on the subject were delivered at Oxford, and Stephen, alarmed at the danger of such doctrines, forbad the reading of books on Canon Law, but the clergy disre garded the prohibition. Among the doctrines thus set forth, it was laid down, \u2014 that any custom against the decree of a Pope is void : that all men must obey"], [183, "CONTESTS BETWEEN CHURCH AND KING. 143 the Pope's commands. It is made an anathema to sue a clergyman before a lay judge; if a lay judge condemn a priest he is to be excommunicated ; a lay man cannot give evidence against a priest ; and so on. Till these doctrines prevailed the separation of the temporal and ecclesiastical courts was not of much importance.

This enactment was called \" The Constitutions of Claren don.\" By this it was provided, among other matters, that priests accused of any crime, of which the secular courts took notice, should be tried by those courts ; that the consent of the king was necessary to the filling up of any benefice, and that, during a vacancy, the king should receive the rents as of his demesne. The pope objected to these enactments, and Henry, struck with a panic of superstition and remorse for the murder of Becket, refrained from putting them in force. He wrote to the pope aud stated that \" notwithstanding the opposition of the greatest and wisest men of the kingdom, he had yielded amongst other things, that no priest should be brought before a secular judge for any crime except an offence against the forest laws.\" Still the Constitutions of Clarendon remained in force, although Henry feared to put them in force. 93b It is unnecessary, in this place, farther to pursue the history of the quarrels between the king and the church, but I have thought it necessary to introduce this notice of them, in order to explain the extent to which it was attempted to extend the Canon Law. From this time the Ecclesiastical Courts had juris diction over wills, marriage and divorce, and all spiritual matters. \" Questions as to the validity of wills of real and personal estate were of a nature that might well be decided on at the county, hundred, or manor courts, but, on the separation of the ecclesiastical from the civil jurisdiction, the bishops carried with them the"], [185, "ORIGIN OF OUR ECCLESIASTICAL COURTS. 145 The clergy retained jurisdiction over mar- riage. and spiri tual con- cerns. jurisdiction as to wills and intestacy, so far as regards personal estate.\"20 Real property, that is, landed property, could not be left by will, so long as the Feudal System lasted, as land could not be transferred from one person to another without actual delivery, which could not take place after the death of the testator.34 \" The clergy, from the first, claimed, and it was ex pressly conceded by Richard the First to the Nor man clergy, that all questions of breach of faith, and of oaths,\" which perhaps were considered to be spi ritual matters, \" should be tried before the ecclesias tical tribunals ; but, by the Constitutions of Clarendon, the ecclesiastical courts were altogether restrained from meddling with all questions of breach of faith or trust, arising between laymen, in regard to civil matters. Questions relating to marriage and wills, including money agreed to be paid on marriage and legacies, as well as all matters merely spiritual, were left to the cognisance of the ecclesiastical courts. The probate of wills of personal estate has, ever since the separation of the cognisance of ecclesiastical matters from the countv court, belonged to the ecclesiastical courts.\" 30 The jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts has long ceased to be under the control of the clergy, but it was thus that they came to have the control over all matters relative to church discipline, marriage, divorce and wills. By recent statutes (20 & 21 Vic. cap. 77. and cap. 85.) the jurisdiction of the Ecclesiastical Courts over matters relating to wills and to marriage and divorce, has been taken away, and two new courts of the Queen have been created ; one the Court of Probate, and the other the Court for Divorce and Matrimonial Causes. Thus these matters which were I. 4"], [186, "146 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND. Doctors' Commons, for so many centuries treated in this country as eccle siastical, have at last been transferred to temporal courts as more properly belonging to their jurisdic tion. Having now given an account of the system of law administered by the Ecclesiastical Courts, it may be interesting to give an account of the place where the law is administered. An English bishop had spiritual jurisdiction over his whole diocese, and there was in every diocese a court held before the official principal of the bishop. Besides these there were courts of the archbishops. The highest court of the kind was the Court of Arches, which was known by that name long before the time of Henry the Second. It was so called from Bow Church, which was designated Sancta Maria de Arcubus, or St. Mary of the Arches, in which the court was holden. For a long time the lawyers, or advocates, who practised in this Court mixed with and lived among the general mass of the people. But in the beginning of the reign of Henry the Eighth, they agreed -to dwell together in contiguous houses, and enjoy a community of board, or commons. Their place of abode was then called the College of Doctors and Advocates. They imitated college life in pro viding that, although the Advocates might be married, their wives could not reside in the college. In 1568, the Dean of the Arches took a lease of Montjoy House, and other buildings in the parish of St. Ben nett, Paul's Wharf, and the court over which he presided, viz., the Prerogative Court of Canterbury, together with the Admiralty Court (of which I shall give an account), were thenceforward holden there, and the whole place was called Doctors' Commons. 107"], [187, "147 CONCLUSION. Admiralty Court. The Saxons tried to embody their laws in complete Codes. Court of Admiralty. The administration of the law in all matters con cerning crimes or injuries committed on the sea, is practised by the Court of Admiralty, which, for reasons I will presently explain, holds its sittings in Doctors' Commons. The Admiralty Court is a court of very high antiquity. It has been distinctly traced as far back as the reign of Edward the First, and there is strong probability of its existence in the reign of Richard the First. This prince stands very high in the history of maritime jurisprudence. On his return from the Holy Land, while he was in the island of Oleron on the coast of France, he compiled a body of maritime laws, which has thence been called ' The Laws of Oleron.' \" 94 This has always been deemed the foundation of the laws of^the Court of Admiralty. The forms of its proceedings were borrowed from the civil law, and the advocates in this court were doctors in the civil law, from whence the connection of this court with the Ecclesiastical Courts in Doctors' Commons may easily be traced. CONCLUSION. From the sketch thus given of the history of the origin of our laws and courts of justice, it will be seen that in the early Saxon times, the system attempted was to embody the whole of the written law of the"], [188, "148 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND. kingdom into a complete code of laws. This was a humble imitation of what had before been done with great success by some of the Roman emperors, par ticularly Justinian ; but our Saxon codes were rude in their construction, and meagre in their provisions, and they were therefore incapable of being applied to many cases which arose as society became more civi lised, and its transactions more complicated. From the time of the Norman conquest no attempt has been made to form a code of the English laws, but Acts of Parliament have been passed from time to time when experience showed that some improvement in the existing laws was necessary. Our statute law, which is composed of such of these Acts of Parliament as re main unrepealed, and our unwritten common law as expounded by the Judges, and the system of equit able jurisprudence, which has in course of time been elaborated by a long series of judicial decisions in the Court of Chancery, now constitute what may be called the raw materials of English law ; but these are of such an undefined and complex nature, and so scat tered, that only those persons who have made law the study of their lives can profess to be acquainted with all the details, or understand how to apply legal principles to any but the simplest cases. In modern times this has not been at tempted. It is there fore diffi cult to study our System of Law as a whole. Many per sons think our Laws ought to be formed into a Code. No man, however, is permitted by our Courts of Justice to excuse himself on the ground of ignorance of the law of his country, and it has therefore been contended by many persons that our laws ought, after the practice of the ancient Romans, and our Saxon ancestors, and most of the modern continental states, to be reduced within the compass of a code which may be read and referred to by any one who wishes to know what the laws are, which he is bound"], [189, "CONCLUSION. 149 This has been ac- complished in Crimi nal Law. A complete Code of English Law would be of great value. to obey. Some steps have been taken in recent legislation, which may be considered as preliminary to this desirable result, and several Acts of Parliament have already been passed for consolidating into one statute all former Acts relating to the same subject matter. This has been accomplished with much success with regard to the criminal law, which is almost wholly composed of statutory enactments, and we may expect some day to see even our unwritten common law, and our system of equitable jurispru dence dealt with in the same manner, though the difficulties to be encountered there will necessarily be far greater. The attention, however, of some of our most eminent lawyers and statesmen is now directed to the task, and there can be no doubt that efforts will be made to surmount all obstacles. It has been the destiny of the British nation to found colonies in every quarter of the globe, and to spread its laws and institutions over an empire on 'which the sun never sets. To the inhabitants of those colonies, no more munificent boon could be given by the parent country, than a complete compendium of its laws embodied in a Code. It has been said of Bona parte, that he will be known to posterity by his Code Napoleon when his victories are forgotten. We may also, as Englishmen, express our hope, that when the colonies which we have planted have become great and independent states, they will have to reckon among their obligations to England, not only their Anglo-Saxon blood and lineage, and the noble lan guage of Milton and Shakspeare, but also a Code of Laws more complete in its provisions, and more enlightened in its principles, than any which the world has yet seen."], [190, ""], [191, "N 0 T E S.

At the commencement of this, my third, Lecture on the History of England, I must remark, that, as we have now reached a period, when events left marks, which may be traced even at the present day, I intend, henceforth, to enter more minutely into the history of each succeeding reign. The reign of Henry the Third is said to be Un interesting, and there are, indeed, but few stirring events, while in the character of Henry himself, there is nothing to admire. He was by turns in the hands of favourites, who were foreigners, of the cardi nals sent over by the Pope, or of barons to whom he was obliged to yield. When in need, he took solemn' oaths to reform abuses; when his need was VOL. I. *M"], [198, "156 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND. satisfied, he scrupled not to break those oaths. Thrice did he solemnly swear to govern according to the Magna Charta, and thrice did he laugh that charter to scorn, when he had escaped from the danger which alone induced him to make the pro mise. He had no strong will, inciting him to some definite end, and by its bold consistency compelling admiration, in spite of the tyranny by which alone that end could be accomplished. No ! he was conr sistent only in getting what he could, in granting what he could not help, and in revoking what he had granted so soon as he recovered the power. He had no vices, he was but miserably weak. Henry III. A.D. 1216. Henry's character weak and fickle : And yet his reign is not only important, but, as I hope you will find, it is interesting also. The struggles to free the realm from French dominion, the resistance of the barons against the King's oppres sions, the successful rebellion of Simon de Montfort, and the consequent growth of self-government, are all matters of interest ; ay, and of moment too, even at this our present day. But there are interesting matters too, of lighter kind. You will hear of the Life of the merry foresters, of Robin Hood and Little John, \" under the greenwood tree ; \" of strange ad ventures of the barons ; and of the fairs held over ail England under peculiar privileges. These matters will, I hope, lighten the graver scenes, of which you must be informed, if you are to listen to the history of your native land. but the reign is im portant, be cause poli tical power was ex- tended.

I must Henry in. now take up the thread of the History from the time a.d. 1216. at which it was broken off, and, to enable you to understand the events which took place at the begin ning of Henry's reign, I must remind you of the chief of those which took place at the close of that of King John, and add a few details to the facts I then related to you. The Manila Charta had been wrung from Kino; Magna John by the barons. They had been roused by his wrung oppressions, by his treachery, and by his vices, to an J0\"1 K:ns assertion of their rights ; or rather, one might say, to demand pledges, or securities, that from hence forth, the Kings of England should govern accord ing to settled laws, instead of according to their own caprices. King John, however, although he had solemnly King John tries to gs~ sworn, to rule according to the Magna Charta, had cape from no sooner affixed his seal thereto, than he made [Jone\u00b0ndl* ready to escape from its conditions. Having sub mitted entirely to the Pope, he felt he might count on his help in the hour of need, and hence he sent and ap to Rome, to beg for absolution from his oath. The p0pefor \" absolution was granted. But John, while securing ab3olutl011' spiritual aid, did not forget the need of temporal help ; and he sent messengers, to those parts of his French dominions which had not been taken from him, to hire soldiers, at any price, to fight for him and levies against his own deceived subjects. The barons too, so'idiers. on their part, felt the need of help, and of a leader, round whom they and their friends might rally. Therefore, they also applied to France, and offered The barons the English crown to Louis, the son of Philip Au- \"r^fto gustus, afterwards King of France as Louis the Louis' M 2"], [200, "158 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND. Eighth. Louis pretended he had a rightful claim to the English throne, as the son of John's elder sister Eleanor, who married Alphonso the Ninth, called \"the good King of Castile.\" He treated John as an usurper, who had murdered the rightful claimant. The barons did not recognise his claim ; but they did not object to avail themselves of it. It is likely also, that they thought the French soldiers hired by John would not fight against the son of the King of France, and, as nearly one third of France belonged, or had belonged, to the Kings of England, they may have felt no horror at a King of France becoming the King of England, joined to France.

The reign of Henry the Third began with a strug gle to free England from French invasion, and was throughout much occupied in wars with France, for the recovery of those provinces that John had lost, and for the keeping of those which still belonged to the Plantagenet Kings of England. It will there fore be well to remind you how it was that certain parts of France once belonged to England ; to state what they were, and what still remained at the death of John ; and then to tell you what parts of England were held by the French on Henry's accession. Henry's reign much occupied with wars with France. The right of English Kings to possessions in France, was derived from a Duke of Normandy who became King of England as William the First.

Henry III, A.D. 1216 how ac quired, genet, had, as I related to you in my first Lecture, larger possessions in France than William. He was lord of Normandy, Anjou, Maine, Touraine, Aqui taine, and Poitou ; but he did homage for them to the King of France, as his feudal superior. During the absence of Richard the Crusader in the Holy Land, Philip Augustus King of France, endeavoured to seize these provinces ; but John, when he succeeded to the throne, ruled over nearly the whole of the French coast, from the borders of Flanders to the foot of the Pyrenees. John had derived this dominion from his father Henry the Second, who received Normandy from the Conqueror; Aquitaine and Poitou from his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine, the divorced wife of Louis the Seventh of France ; and Anjou, Maine, and Tou raine from his father Geoffrey Plantagenet. But he soon lost the greater part of his French possessions. It was the great object of Philip Augustus to increase the royal domain of France, which, at his accession, consisted only of a small extent of territory round Paris, and indeed in no way represented the territory we mean now when we speak of France. \" If one compares the power of the King of France, to that of the King of England (in France), at the accession of Philip Augustus, a.d. 1179, one is sur prised at the disproportion. The Boulonnais, Nor mandy, Maine, Anjou, and Brittany, formed, to the north of the Loire, a sovereignty, compact, and supe rior in extent to that of the King of France, which comprised only the Isle of France, and a part of Picardy and of the Orleannois. While, if Henry the Second divided with his suzerain, or feudal lord, the sovereignty of the provinces north of the Loire, he was almost sole possessor of the provinces to the south, M 3"], [202, "160 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND.

Touraine, Poitou, Angoumois, Saintonge, Guienne, Gascony, le Berri, la Manche, le Limousin, and the greatest part of Au vergne belonged to him. The Count of Toulouse did him homage for that province, of which he had always defended the independance ; and the possessions of the King of Aragon, along the Mediterranean, from Perpignan to the mouths of the Rhone, were placed, by treaties of alliance, in a sort of dependance on him. The power, or influence, of England, thus extended over forty- seven ofthe departments, while Philip Au gustus hardly ruled over twenty.\" ' Philip Augustus desired to obtain possession of the whole country. The various duchies, which only feudally submitted to him, had maintained an independance which he wished to destroy; and whenever he had, for a time, subjected them, they soon began to be dissatisfied with his government, and welcomed back John. But Philip Augustus took nearly the whole of Aquitaine from John, in the be ginning of the 13th century ; and by a treaty signed at Parthenay, in 1214, a truce for five years was agreed on between John and Philip Augustus, the conditions of which were, that John shou\u00bbld give up all his pos sessions north of the Loire, viz. Normandy, Brittany, Anjou, Maine, and Touraine. Thus Philip Augustus greatly increased the domain of the King of France, and Henry the Third, at his accession, possessed only Gascony, and part of Guienne. He probably held some castles, and had some indefinite hold on parts of Poitou, but the province itself, as a whole, had submitted to Philip Augustus.

The Earl of Pembroke appointed guardian. many barons from his own cause by his profuse gifts of power and honours to his countrymen. He had made the Count de Nevers, Earl of Winchelsea, and Gilbert de Gand, Earl of Lincoln. Many powerful barons had in consequence returned to King John, who was very liberal of promises to those who came to his help. From these causes, at Henry's accession he had a powerful body of friends to support him, and his youth enlisted others on his side. Many were naturally touched with the helplessness of the youth, willing to support him in defence of his throne against a foreigner, and hopeful, that from him they might obtain those rights, which his father had wrested from them. Henry too was sure of the Pope's support, which in those days was a matter of great moment. The Pope had excommunicated Louis, and all John's opponents, and of course lent his spiritual aid to the young King. William Mareschal, Earl of Pembroke, a powerful baron, who had remained true to John, was appointed guardian of the kingdom, and the young King was placed under his care. He was a man of great abi lity, and it was mainly to his wisdom, that Henry was indebted for the speedy possession of his throne. So soon as the death of John was publicly known, the Earl of Pembroke summoned the earls, bishops, and barons who had remained true to the late King, to meet him at Gloucester ; whither he had taken Prince Henry. He then addressed them, and said : \" that, although they had persecuted his father for \"his evil deeds, yet the son was innocent of his \" father's faults ; and that therefore they ought to have \" pity on his tender age and make him their King, and"], [205, "MILITARY OPERATIONS. 163 \" expel Louis the son of the French King.\" 5 \" Let Henry in. \" him be made king,\" was their answer; and a few days a.d^ib. afterwards he was crowned at Gloucester: but, the Corona crown itself having been lost with John's baggage, young a plain circle of gold was used in its stead.

On their way, a contri bution was again levied on the unfortunate abbot of St. Albans ; after which they pillaged the church of St. Amphibalus, near Redbourn.

Henry's troops were admitted into the city by the skilful management of the King's party within the castle, and the crossbow-men quickly began the attack. The horsemen fought the archers in the narrow streets at a great disadvantage, and were soon thrown into confusion. \" Then sparks of fire were seen to dart, and sounds as of dreadful thunder were heard to burst forth from the blows of swords against hel meted heads ; but at length, by means of the cross bow-men, by whose skill the horses of the barons were mown down and killed like pigs, the party of the barons was greatly weakened.\" 33 The King's party sallied out from the castle, the insurgents were totally routed, and their leader, the Count de la Perche, with a large number of the barons, was killed. In the quaint language of the old chroniclers, this was called the Fair of Lincoln. This was a serious blow to the French cause, and a defeat at sea gave it the finishing stroke. Louis, on hearing of the defeat of his army at Lincoln, sent over to his father for help ; but he, fearing the anger of the Pope, left it to the Prince's wife to help him, thinking thereby to escape the execution of the Pope's threats. Accordingly, by the efforts of Blanche of Castile, the wife of Louis, a French fleet of eighty large ships, besides smaller vessels, was collected at Calais, and set sail for England under the command of the French Admiral, Eustace the Monk.

Henry III. A.D. 1217. Thus ended the attempts on the English crown in less than a year from Henry's accession. After the defeat at Lincoln, Louis had retreated to London, where he built up all the gates but one, to secure himself from an attack by the King's forces. But, on hearing of the defeat of the French fleet, all hope of success was gone, and he willingly made peace with Henry, and returned to France. According to the custom of the feudal system, which I explained in my former Lecture, it was arranged, that Louis should relieve the barons who had called him to their assist ance, of their homage and their fealty ; and that Henry should give them a full pardon on their return to their allegiance. Louis also promised that, if ever he came to the French throne, he would restore to Henry all the provinces which had belonged to his father. Departure of the French. Arrangements for the Government of the Kingdom. After the departure of the French, Alexander the Se cond, King of Scotland, who had taken part with John's opponents, made peace with Henry, and was received by him with great honour at Northampton ; where it is said, by some historians, he did homage to Henry for the territories which he held of the King of England.

For the performance of these things he gave hostages, \" Mailgon the son of Rees, and Rees the son of Griffin, and Mareduc the son of Ren.\" 1 The young King was now seated on the throne with- out a rival, but he had not a single relative to advise him. Even his mother, Queen Isabella, who had followed the example of her husband King John, in his profligacy, and had thereby forfeited the esteem of the nation, left him to the care of others, and went over to France to marry her former lover the Count de la Marche. Henry, however, had good advisers. The Earl of Pembroke was a wise and upright man, and the legate Gualo, who had been sent over by Pope Honorius the Third to advise the young King, performed his duty with discretion and fidelity.

John had lavishly distributed the crown lands, and the lands of the insurgent barons, among his partisans, foreigners as well as natives ; and had surrendered to them the command of the royal castles. They now refused to give them up till Henry became of age; whereupon, in a.d. 1223, when the King was only sixteen years old, the Pope issued a bull, or edict, declaring him to be of full age, and ordering all who held the King's castles to deliver them up under pain of excommunication. 9 The Earls of Chester and others refused to comply, but were at length compelled to submit.

It is needless to relate in detail all the struggles between the King and his barons; but it is worthy of notice that the King's council, held at Oxford in January 1223, deemed it necessary that Henry should confirm the liberties granted by his father, although when he came to the throne he had sworn to ob serve the Charter ; from whence it appears that the King and his two advisers had already neglected to observe the conditions of the Magna Charta. Henry yielded, and promised to make inquiry concerning those liberties, and to cause them to be proclaimed. The barons demand a confirma tion of the Charters. The History of Fulke de Breaute. I must now relate to you the history of one of John's foreign barons, who also played a conspicuous part in the present reign, as it illustrates the turbu lent manners of the times, engendered by the civil wars and the cruel despotism of John. This baron was named Fulke de Breaute. His history is related by Illustrates the man ners of the times."], [213, "FULKE DE BREAUTE. 171 Henry III. Born in Normandy Soon makes his way in England monks whom he robbed and maltreated, and therefore it cannot be supposed that he met with much mercy at their hands ; but neither, as you will see, did he deserve much. These monks constantly speak of him as that Falcas, that Falcasius. Latin was the language in which the monks always wrote, and in turning the name Fulke into Falcas, or Falcasius, they probably wished to express their hatred of his sanguinary rapacity, for the word seems to be de rived from a Latin word (falx) meaning a scythe. Another historian, not subject to any suspicion as to his motives, calls him \"the old plunderer,\" and you will see he well deserved the name. He was born in Normandy, and came over in the reign of John to seek his fortunes. \" About this time,\" says Matthew Paris, \" there was one Fulke de Breaute, a native of Normandy, a bastard by his mother's side, who had lately come on a scurvy horse, with a pad on his back, to enter the King's ser vice.\" 38 Physically he seems to have been a brave man, but of moral courage he was quite destitute, for when overtaken by misfortunes his courage failed him entirely ; he had however such fox-like readiness of resource when fairly hunted down, that it is impos sible to avoid being interested and amused with his adventures. Fulke soon made his way in England, for we hear of him as one of John's principal advisers in his dis putes with the Pope. When John had submitted to the Pope, had failed to observe the Charter, and had waged war against the barons, up comes this bird of evil omen. \" Accordingly,\" says an old chronicler, \" King John, accompanied by that detestable troop of foreigners whose leader was Fulke de Breaute, began N"], [214, "172 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND.

We next hear of him laying waste the Isle of Ely. \" About this time,\" it is said, \" the Isle of Ely was laid waste by Fulke, who also, mounted on his horse, with his sword drawn, irreverently entered the Cathedral itself, and dragging from thence noblemen, clergymen, and matrons, and the Lord Stephen Ridel himself, compelled him to pay a most heavy ransom.\"40 Then he plundered the town of St. Albans, killing some of the nobles in the Abbey itself, where they had taken refuge. For this, it is said, he was reproved in a vision by St. Alban, \" who looked upon him with a stern eye so fiercely, and reproved him so bitterly, that he was almost bereft of his senses.\" 41 Accordingly, he went to the abbot and his brethren, in great humiliation, entreating for pardon, which was granted him on his submitting to be whipped by every one of them. \" But,\" adds the chronicler, \" he did not restore any of the property he had seized, or make any reparation to the poor followers of Christ for the injury he had done them.\" 32 John and De"], [215, "FULKE DE BREAUTE. 173 Breaute now went on hand in hand in their savage cruelty. Under John's orders, he and the Earl of Salisbury kept passing and repassing to and from the city of London, to watch and harass the barons, and cut off their supplies. Then John gave him more castles to command, charging him as he valued his life, to harass the barons. At last John died, and Fulke made friends with Henry, and was as great a man as ever. At the head of his castellans, or keepers of his castles, he took part in the siege of Mount Sorel, and was of great service at the siege of Lincoln. \" Falcasius then, seeing a great many of the more noble of the enemy struck to the earth, boldly burst forth with his followers from the castle into the midst of the enemy; he was, however, made prisoner by the number who rushed on him, and carried away, until he was rescued by the bravery of his cross bow-men and knights.\"33 Henry III He harasses the barons.

Seven engines battered the walls with large stones from morning to night, and a machine called a cat, protected the sappers in their attempts to undermine the foundations. The barbican was then taken by assault, the outer wall was forced, and the castle, horses, and provender fell into the hands of the King. At length the foundations of the keep, or inner stronghold, gave way, and laid open the fortress. The royal standard was now hoisted on the tower, and the garrison capitulated. The castle was destroyed, and the leaders of Fulke's party, to the number of about eighty, were executed. Fulke's courage now failed him, and he thought it was time to make his peace with the King.

History and Origin of Fairs. Before resuming the continuous narrative of the events of the reign, I must give an account of the Fairs which were at this time held in different parts of England. They were not only one of the greatest sources of amusement in those times, but they were moreover of importance as a source of revenue to the King, and were among the means by which he op pressed his subjects. Fairs were sources of revenue ; Fairs are of great antiquity. Stourbridge fair, which at one time was of great importance, is said by some to have originated in the time of the occupation of Great Britain by the Romans. \" The first fairs arose from the gathering together of worshippers and pilgrims about sacred places, es pecially within or about the walls of abbeys or cathedrals, on the feast days of the saints enshrined within them. The sacred building was often in the open country, or near some village, too small to pro vide accommodation for the throng assembled at its yearly feast of dedication. Then tents were pitched, and as the resources of the district could no more suffice to victual than to lodge its flying visitors, stalls were set up by the provision dealers to supply their wants ; \" 42 and thus by degrees, the convenience of these marts led to their use as general markets. The King, however, reserved to himself the right of granting leave to hold these fairs, and tolls were levied on all goods sold there. This became a con siderable source of revenue. Sometimes the King proclaimed a fair, all the tolls levied at which were paid to him ; but more usually he granted the right of holding a fair to some favourite, or for some par- existed in England in the time of the Ro- mans originated in pil grimages to sacred places. Stalls were set up to supply the multitudes with food, and thus fairs by de grees be came mar kets. Tolls were levied by the King, or licenses granted."], [223, "181 HISTORY OF FAIRS. ticular purpose. Thus the right of holding a fair at Smithfield, was granted by Henry I. to the monks of the priory of St. Bartholomew, for the benefit of the priory. Fairs were constantly held in churchyards, and sometimes even in the church itself; and it was not unusual, when a fair was held . within the pre cincts of a cathedral, to oblige every man to bind himself by an oath at the gate, not to lie, steal, or cheat till he went out again. Those who attended fairs were greatly privileged ; traders on their way to or from a fair, were free from arrest, except for debts arising out of the trade of the fair itself. Henry HI. Right of holding Bartholo mew Fair granted to the monks of the priory. Fairs held in church yards. All trade within a certain distance, was stopped during the fair, so as to compel traders to resort to the fair during its continuance, and it was unlawful to set up two fairs within seven miles of each other. This practice was much abused by Henry III. He not only held fairs, for instance, at Westminster, to the great damage of the citizens of London, and with \u25a0 out any plea of old custom or general utility ; but also, during its continuance, he prohibited other fairs, even one so far off as Ely, which the Bishop of Ely had a right to hold at that time. All trade in the neigh bourhood stopped during the fair. Henry abuses this custom to increase his tolls. The fair on St. Giles's Hill, near Winchester, which was the greatest in Europe after that of Beaucaire in France, was given to the Bishop of Winchester by William the Conqueror for three days ; and by Henry III., for sixteen days ; and during its con tinuance, all the shops were closed, not only in Win chester, but also in Southampton.

The great hill or mount of St Giles overlooking the town, on which Earl Waltheof is said to have been executed by order of the Conqueror, was covered with store shops or stalls, some belonging to the Crown, and many to the bishop. There was the French street ; the stalls of the men of Caen ; the street of the Flemings ; the streets of the men of Nottingham and other English towns ; and there was also the ' street in which old clothes are sold.' In the town of Win chester itself, there was the High street with its Spicery, or quarter of the Grocers; the street where the Haberdashers sat ; the Mercery street ; the Dra pery ; Parchment street ; the quarter of the Jewry ; and the respective streets of the Fullers ; Weavers ; Carpet-makers and Tanners.\" 5i Every fair had its own court of justice, for the immediate settlement of all disputes at the fair. This was called the Court of Pie Poudre (or Court of Powdered Feet), and its name was derived from the dusty feet of those who attended the fair. \" To add to the attractions of a fair, and more especially to induce the rich and powerful to resort to it with full purses in pursuit of pleasure, amuse ments were introduced ;\"43 and thus sprung up the games and shows of modern country fairs, which have now, however, nearly disappeared. For many centuries, fairs were the only places where every variety of goods could be purchased, and thus they were of great service. \" Even so late as the 16th century, there was so little of commercial life in English towns, that stewards of country-houses, made their annual purchases of household stores at fairs, that might be a hundred miles distant from the estab-"], [225, "THE KING'S EXACTIONS. 183 lishments for which they were providing.\" 44 Thus it is ordered in the Earl of Northumberland's household book, that \" he that standes charged with my lordes house for the houll yeir, if he may possible, shall be at all fairs where the groice emptions shall be boughte for the house for the houlle yeir, as wine, wax, beiffes, multons, wheite and inaltie.\"45 The beefs and muttons were salted meats, which shows the little progress agriculture and the breeding of cattle had then made.

On the return of the Pope's legate Pandulph, to Rome in A.d. 1221, the rivalry of the two ministers or favourites, Hubert de Burgh and Peter des Roches, became more decided.

By the improvidence of his father, King John, the royal pos sessions had been greatly diminished ; for he had been obliged to give many of the royal demesnes, to such of the barons as were base enough to support him in his attempts to oppress the people, and to the foreign ers whom he hired to help him. Consequently some of his natural sources of revenue were dried up. We must also recollect that in those days there were no regular taxes. When the King wanted money, he applied to his Council.

When supplies were granted, it was usually in the form of what was called a fifteenth. This was formerly the real fifteenth part of all the movable property belong ing to the subject, when such movables or personal estates were a very different and a much less con siderable thing than they now are, and originally, at each grant, a fresh assessment of the value of property was made.47 This was a very oppressive mode of levying revenue, for sometimes it was levied even on workmen's tools.55 Henry III. Origin of the consti tutional mode of obtaining redress of grievances. Origin of fifteenths. There were also some other sources of revenue; such as fines on taking possession of landed property at the death of the former tenant, payments in lieu of military duty, and others arising from the feudal system, as explained in my second Lecture. The King had also the right of keeping to himself the tempo ralities ; that is the revenues of lands and tene ments belonging to an archbishop's and bishop's see, and of all abbeys and priories of royal foundation, till the successor was appointed.46 This was a source of great abuse, for the King often delayed the appoint ment of a successor for the sake of the revenues. Other sources of revenue. The wars with France were the most constant source of expense, and one of the earliest causes of Henry's demands of money.

It was provided by the treaty between Henry and"], [227, "THE KING ASKS FOR AN AID TO INVADE FRANCE. 185 Louis, after the \" fair of Lincoln,\" that, when Louis succeeded to the throne of France, he should restore to Henry the French possessions which had belonged to his father. This was a promise he was not likely to fulfil. Philip Augustus, the king of France, died on July 14th, a.d. 1223, and his son Louis succeeded him as Louis VIII. Henry III. A.D. 1223. Louis, on his accession, not only refused to fulfil his promise, but published the original sentence of forfeiture against John, entered Poitou with a nume rous army, and extended his conquests to the right bank ofthe Garonne. In the following summer, a.d. 1224, a parliament was assembled at Northampton, and the King demanded an aid to enable him to invade France. The barons would not grant any money without greater security for their liberties ; for, although the King had, as I have informed you, confirmed the Charter on his accession to the throne, its provisions were constantly infringed. The de bates were interrupted by the siege of Bedford, but were renewed after its capture ; and at the following Christmas, after a stormy discussion, the aid was granted on condition of the King again confirming the Charter. The King was obliged to yield, and both the Great Charter and the Charter of Forests were solemnly ratified in that form in which they now appear in our Statute Book.

He therefore told them the King required their counsel and aid, that the royalties of the Crown and their ancient rights might be recovered. For the retrieving of which, he thought that the fif teenth part of all moveables, both of ecclesiasticks and laicks might be sufficient. This being pro pounded, the archbishops, and all the bishops, earls, barons, abbots, and priors, after some deliberation, returned the King this answer, that ' they would readily gratify his desires, if he would again confirm their long-desired liberties.' Thereupon, the King agreeing to the request of his great men, many Char ters were forthwith written, and sealed with the King's seal, and one of them directed to every county in England, and to the counties where there were forests there were sent two, one concerning their common liberties, the other concerning the liberties of the forests.\" u He then goes on to say that, in assess ing this tax, \" their horses, ploughs, arms, and household utensils, as also their jewels and necessary provisions for housekeeping, were excepted.

As soon as the King had obtained this grant of money he lost no time in making use of it ; and be fore the following Easter (a.d. 1225), he sent his brother Richard to France to attempt to recover his provinces. After nearly a year's fighting with but little result, an armistice was agreed on, but before its expi ration Louis died (on Nov. 8, 1226), and was succeeded by his son, Louis IX., a boy eleven years old, who became known in history as St. Louis.

The storm of anger which had been brewing for several years now burst on Hubert's head.

Henry acted on this sug gestion, and called on Hubert to give an account of all the wardships he had held ; of the rents of the royal demesnes he had received ; and of all the aids and fines which had been paid into the exchequer.

When the King heard of this, suppos ing that Hubert designed to escape altogether, he sent down a body of armed men to take him prisoner. On hearing of their approach, he took refuge in a church, where he awaited them, with the cross in one hand, and the host, taken from the altar, in the other. The sanctity of the place was not respected, and he was dragged from the altar, bound on the back of a CO \" horse, and taken to the Tower of London. The Bishop of London was much incensed at this sacrilege, and, on his remonstrance, the King ordered Hubert to be restored to the church ; but he also directed that the church should be surrounded, so that Hubert could neither escape nor receive food. He therefore soon gave himself up to the King, and was again taken to the Tower. The King now discovered that Hubert had much treasure lodged with the Knights Templars in London, and accordingly, he demanded that it should be given up to him. Hubert, of course, could not refuse, and the receipt of the money seems to have softened the King's heart ; for soon afterwards he re granted him all the lands which his father had given him, and also those he had purchased. Nevertheless, he sent him prisoner to the castle of Devizes.15 nenry III. A.D. 1232. Takes re fuge in a church. Is dragged from the altar, but is taken back. The church is watched.

Then ensued a series of contests between the King and the barons ; faithless promises on the part of the King ; Hubert de Burgh escaping from prison and joining the insurgents, the clergy uniting with the barons in their resistance to the King's tyranny, and excommunicating the King's friends, including even the Bishop of Winchester. At length the King was obliged to yield. He dismissed Peter the Poitevin back to his bishopric of Winchester 17, and treated his former favourites with great, but probably well-de served, severity ; and received back into his favour Hugh de Burgh, and some of the principal insurgents.

The opportunity soon came. The Christmas following, he summoned his Council to meet him, and endeavoured by fair promises to per suade them to grant him an aid. They refused com pliance, till he added three barons of their own party to his Council, and then only on the condition, \" That from thenceforward the King should reject the coun sels and advices of foreigners and strangers, and adhere to those of his faithful and natural subjects ; and that the money collected should be secured in some abbey, church, or castle, that so, if the King should recede from his promise, it should be restored to every man again.\" l9 Henry III.

In 1237, the King c eness again sent for the Pope's legate, under pretence of obtaining his assistance in \" reforming the state,\" but in reality to support him against the barons. Two years afterwards the Pope recalled his legate ; but the King, fearing the barons would take ad- his feeble vantage of his departure, obtained permission for ness; him to remain. The aid which had been granted was collected ; but notwithstanding all the caution of the Parliament, the King got possession of it, and his faith squandered it among his foreign friends. It is weari- cssnes some to recount all these petty squabbles ; but, as I have before said, they are of importance as precursors of the coming storm. The Pope's Oppression of the English Clergy. I must now turn to matters of more enduring in terest ; and I shall therefore endeavour to explain to you the nature and origin of the Pope's demands on the Church, and of the spirited resistance made to them by the Roman Catholic clergy of England. From the earliest times, the clergy had formed a Thereia body linked together from the lowest priest to the 'j\u00b0\"s\u00b0jthe Bishop of Rome, and, when the feudal system was the p'ope established, \" the constitution of the Church became in a great measure assimilated, in the ideas of the Western Christians, to the institutions of a feudal kingdom. The Pope appeared to hold the place of the sovereign : the Bishops were considered nearly in the light of his barons; and subordinate to the o 4"], [236, "194 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND. bishops stood the inferior Clergy, in the quality of sub- vassals.\" 49 Again, as the civil sovereign de manded pecuniary aid from his barons, so did the Pope demand contributions from the bishops, who paid their portion and levied the remainder from the rest of the clergy. So long as these demands were moderate they were granted without opposition. But by degrees they increased. The Pope had originally no temporal power, and indeed it was not until the beginning of the 7th century that he made any claims to be regarded as a temporal prince. \" In the person of Gregory the Great, the Bishop of Rome first be came, in act and in influence, if not in avowed autho rity, a temporal Sovereign.\" 48 \" The patrimony of St. Peter, in the times of Gregory the Great, con sisted in the estates of the churches, which were very large. But this ecclesiastical property was wholly distinct from the temporal dominion of the Popes in Italy, which was entirely the creation of a later age.\" 56 \" By accepting the donation of Pepin, and by subse quent acquisitions,\" the Popes added temporal to their spiritual power, and \" the wars in which they were compelled to engage, sometimes with their own sub jects, and sometimes with foreign states, entailed on them expenses far beyond the annual amount of their income.\" 49a The Popes consequently made larger de mands, sometimes amounting to a tenth or more of the annual income of the clergy. At first, they were made under pretence of prosecuting the Crusades; but some how or other it was discovered, that every war in which the Pope engaged was for the defence of religion. Thus, to give an English instance, from the present reign. In the year a.d. 1240, the Pope having a quarrel with Frederic, the Emperor of Germany, de- Henry III. A.D. 1240.

But the English clergy refused, saying \" that they ought not to contribute anything against the Emperor, because he neither was convicted nor con demned by the judgment of the Church ; and that as the Roman Church had its own patrimony, so other churches had theirs also, by the grants and beneficence of kings, princes, and other great men, no ways tri butary to the Church of Rome ; and likewise that although the care of the Church belonged to the Pope, yet the dominion and property did not.\"21 The Eng lish clergy had met in the previous year to resist the Pope's oppressions. In July 1239 it is stated \" the bishops met at London to consider upon a very great, but difficult undertaking, which was how they might relieve the Church of England from those many op pressions it lay under, by the perpetual exactions of the Pope's legate ; \" and in answer to his demands, \" they briefly answered, that the Church had so often been squeezed by him and others from Rome, that they could endure it no longer.\" 19a Henry III. A.D. 1240. The Eng lish clergy resist. For some time neither the King nor the barons in terfered in these disputes with the Pope ; but at length Henry felt that if the clergy were impoverished, the burthen of taxation would fall entirely on the laity, and that consequently he would find greater difficulty in raising money. The barons on their part also felt that if the King squeezed less out of the clergy, he would squeeze more out of the laity. The King and the barons therefore took part with the clergy, and the Pope (Innocent IV.) made promises of mo deration. But his necessities soon compelled him to increase his demands, and in a.d. 1246 he levied a heavy contribution on the clergy.

As expressed a.d7~i246. by an old historian, \" On Mid-Lent Sunday the same Parliament of the whole kingdom met at London according to summons, where the King conferred with the bishops apart, the earls and barons apart, as also the abbots and priors apart, concerning the means how to redress the grievances of the nation, proceed ing from the exorbitancies of the Roman Court. \" 2 The conclusion was, however, very lame and impotent. They sup- They agreed simply to supplicate the Pope to desist PopeTwho from his oppressive exactions. As might be expected, farther d *^e P\u00b0Pe not yield. \" He sent his Apostolic Com mands, mands to the bishops, that some of them should find fifteen, others ten, and others five stout and brave men, well horsed and armed for one year, as the Pope should direct.\" 3 This was to assist him in his war against Frederick, Emperor of Germany, whom he had deposed. The Pope, fearing opposition from the King, ordered the bishops to keep secret his exac tions, under pain of excommunication. They informed the King, however, and two barons were consequently sent to Rome to induce the Pope to moderate his demands. This was not the way to suc ceed ; and it did not succeed. The Pope insisted ; the The King King resisted for a while, but at last yielded. Then came fresh demands from the Pope, resistance on the part of the King, and finally, in 1247, submission of the clergy to the Pope's demands. The King finding that if the Pope pillaged England, he himself could The King, get no money from his subjects, summoned \"the whole and the eS' nobility of the kingdom to meet at Oxford to consult clerpy , about it, but especially the prelates, that they mi^ht again meet, r J r J o consider how the Church should be relieved from these oppressions. And although some of the prelates had"], [239, "THE POPE'S OPPRESSIONS. 197 resolved to refuse the aforesaid contributions, yet their hearts failing them when they met, they, con trary to all expectation, consented to a contribution to the Pope of 11,000 marks.\"22 This is about 22,000/. of our money, but if its amount is calculated according to the comparative price of corn, it would be at least 100,000/. Henry III. A.D. 1247. but the clergy fear and yield. Other Oppressions of the Pope. There was another grievous oppression under which the Church laboured, viz., the appointment of foreigners to vacant benefices in England. To so great an extent was this carried, that in 1240 \" the Pope sent his precepts to the Archbishop of Canterbury and to the Bishops of Lincoln and Salis bury, commanding them to prefer no less than 300 Romans or Italians to the first vacant benefices in England, and not to collate any others till they were all sufficiently provided.\"20 Many of these foreigners were ignorant of the English language. After strong remonstrances, the Pope (in 1247) agreed that no Italian should be beneficed without the King's pre vious consent, which he doubtless believed he should have no difficulty in obtaining, and many foreigners were still appointed. All this while the King him self was accused of defrauding the Church of her proper revenues, by keeping bishoprics and livings vacant for years, in order to appropriate the revenues to himself in the meanwhile. The Pope appoints hundreds of foreigners to vacant livings. Henry keeps liv ings vacant to obtain the re- venues. It is difficult and tedious to attempt to unravel these constant plots and counterplots, oppressions and resistances. But one conclusion may be safely drawn, viz. : that the Pope and the King were always trying who could extort most from the English"], [240, "198 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND.

In the year a.d. 1247, the King sent ambassadors to France to demand the restitution of Normandy ; but all the answer they could get was, \" that the King of France had been in quiet possession of it for forty years, and that the French King had most right to it, because King John had undergone the judgment of his peers.\" 23 A nobleman now first appeared on the scene, who, a few years subsequently, became the most important person in the whole kingdom. I mean Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester. He was the son of a French nobleman who had married a sister of the Earl of Leicester, and he was one of those fo reigners whom Henry had brought over and made his favourites. To the great anger of the native barons, the King privately gave him in marriage to his sister Eleanor in a.d. 1238, and in the following year created him Earl of Leicester. In a.d. 1249, the King sent him over to France to endeavour to recover, by force of arms, those provinces which his ambassadors had failed to obtain by persuasion. De Montfort invaded Gascony, and met with great suc cess; but he was obliged to return to England in a.d. 1251 to get money and more men. He had gone over at his own cost, the King probably not being able to furnish him with means, as he had been re fused supplies by his Council the year previously.

Simon de Montfort ruled Gascony with a strong hand, and consequently the nobles complained to Henry of his tyranny. Henry sent to inquire into the truth of the complaints, but his messengers reported that, although they found some who had been severely treated by the Earl, yet it was only according to their deserts. Simon de Montfort would, therefore, have been acquitted of the charges brought against him, had it not been for the weak fickleness of the King. Henry was very jealous of his brother Richard, Earl of Cornwall, because he opposed his system of favouring foreigners ; and when he found that he was one of De Montfort's supporters, he suddenly turned round on De Mont fort and called him a traitor. A violent quarrel now ensued between the King and Simon de Montfort, who told the King \" he lied, and were he not a King he would make him eat his words.\" 27 The quar rel was nevertheless patched up, and De Montfort returned to Gascony. No sooner was he gone, how ever, than (in 1252) the King made his son Edward governor of Gascony. De Montfort's strong hand being removed, the Gascon nobles revolted, and Henry himself went over in 1253 to put down the rebellion. \" By the end of the summer the King had recovered all his castles in Gascony, either by force or composition.

Yet the King continued all this winter in France.\" 28b The King's Struggles with the Barons. During the Avhole of this time, while the struggle for the recovery of the French provinces was going on, the King was continually engaged in quarrels with his barons for supplies, and in oppressions to extort money. He was occasionally reduced to great extremities. In 1248 he was obliged to sell his jewels, his plate, and even his household utensils.24 It is probable that his ordinary revenue was not enough for his necessary expenditure ; but yet, regardless of his straits for money, and regardless of the promises by which alone he had obtained grants of supplies, he increased his expenses by his favours to foreigners, by his constant wars with France, and by his ambitious projects for his sons. His Parliaments were, how ever, continually willing to grant him supplies on condition of his redressing their grievances, and abiding by his promises to rule according to the Charter. But, unfortunately, whenever he got the money he forgot the grievance ; and so prepared the way for the coming rebellion. Thus too he laid the foundations of the constitutional mode of obtaining redress of grievances, which prevails to this very day. The King's struggle with the barons goes on. The King's extremities for money. Refusal of supplies becomes the con- stitutional mode of obtaining redress of grievances. In a.d. 1248, he caused a new fair to be proclaimed at Westminster.

These things caused great heartburn ings and discontents among the citizens.\" 28 The forest laws were administered, too, with great severity. In 1250 Henry sent an officer to inquire into transgressions against the forest laws, \" which charge,\" says an old chronicler, \" he executed with that violence and extortion as exceeded belief, clap ping up gentlemen in prison for but muttering against his unjust proceedings, and ruining divers ofthe best quality for killing but a deer or a hare, albeit it were in the very highway.\" 25 It is indeed sad to relate the history of this reign, as it is nothing but a history of the King's oppressions and treachery on the one side, and of the persevering resistance of the barons on the other.

The money was granted, after much altercation, on condition that the King should govern according to the Charter, and a day was appointed when he and his nobles might take a solemn oath to that effect. Accordingly, on the 3rd of May, the following solemn scene took place. The Archbishop of Canterbury, and the rest of the bishops, assembled in their full robes, holding lighted candles in their hands, and excommunicated and anathematised, with bell, book, and candle, all those that opposed, violated, diminished, or changed the Liberties and Customs of the kingdom. The King laid his hand on his breast, and said, \" So may God help me, as I inviolably observe all these things;\" but he refused to hold a candle. The bishops and the nobles, who also held lighted candles, then put out their candles, and threw them smoking on the ground, in token, that those who broke their oaths, might so smoke and stink in hell. No sooner, how ever, was the Council dissolved, than the King con trived how he might break through all those things he had lately granted.28 a Henry HI. A.D. 1253.

The Emperor left three sons \u2014 Conrad, King of Germany, by his first wife; Henry, by his second wife, who was sister of Henry the Third of England ; and an illegitimate son, Man fred. The Pope was desirous that the throne should not again be occupied by an Emperor of Germany ; and offered the kingdoms to the Earl of Cornwall. On his refusal to accept them, the Pope made a similar offer to the King for his son Edmund. Henry re fused, as he did not wish to oppose the claims of his nephew, and, doubtless also, because he had no money to spare. The Emperor's eldest son, Conrad, was determined not to give up his claim to the throne without an effort, and marched from Germany at the head of his army. He took Apulia, and was pre paring to invade Sicily when his brother Henry died. The Pope immediately urged the King of England to take advantage of this circumstance, and to accept the crown for his son ; to which the King foolishly agreed. But he was unable to fulfil his agreement, as the barons refused to supply the necessary means. Conrad now died, and Manfred seized the throne, defeating the Pope's troops, who had resisted Manfred's pretensions during the negotiations with Henry. The Pope still endeavoured to persuade Henry to raise an army, and march to his assistance, offering to absolve him from a vow he had made to engage in a crusade to the Holy Land if he would consent. Henry would will ingly have complied, but he could get no money from the barons. Nevertheless, Henry would not give up the Sicilian crown, and promised to land with an army the following year. He also bound himself to pay all the expenses of the war, which had, up to that time, been incurred by the Pope. The year 1256 came; Henry HI.

The Pope complained of Henry's nonpayment, and the King tried by every means to raise the money. But the barons very properly dis approved of his making a war, which he could not afford, to place his son on the throne of Sicily ; and they could not be moved. Henry then, assisted by threats of excommunication by the Pope, compelled the clergy to furnish the required sum, and they were forced by every kind of extortion to provide the money. Henry III.

He was be lieved to be the richest Prince in Europe ; having carefully husbanded his revenues ; and he was un able to resist the temptation of being made a king. Early in 1257, he went over to Aix-la-Chapelle to be crowned, and in the following year he took possession of his new dominions. Richard had frequently joined with the barons in opposing his brother, but he always supported what he considered the just rights of the Crown. His absence therefore left the barons free to follow their own course, and under the guidance of the Earls of Hereford and Gloucester, and of Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, they associated them selves together to reform the state. being made King ofthe Romans, the barons are left to follow their own courses without control."], [247, "205 COUNCIL OF ARMED BARONS.

On these conditions the barons agreed to pay the King's debts, and to support the claims of Edmund to the throne of Sicily. On the appointed day, June 11th, the Parliament met at Oxford. It has unjustly received the name of \" the mad Parliament,\" but it would be well if all Parliaments had been equally wise ; and it is certain that from this Parliament sprang those reforms which resulted eventually in the present constitution of Par liament, as I explained in my second Lecture.

The go vernors of the castles swore to keep them faithfully for the use of the King, and to restore them to him on the receipt of an order from the Council, and at the expiration of twelve years to surrender them loy ally on the demand of the King. The Committee then ordered that four knights should be chosen by the freeholders of each county, to ascertain and lay before the Parliament all the injuries committed within the county during Henry's reign ; that new high sheriffs should be appointed annually by the votes of the freeholders ; that all sheriffs, the Trea surer, the Chancellor, and the Grand Justiciary should give in their accounts annually ; and that Parliaments should meet three times a year. Henry III. A.D. 1258. Reform of Parlia- ment. These were all most reasonable reforms, and had nothing of revolutionary violence about them ; and it says much for the wisdom and moderation of De Montfort and his associates, that they were not tempted by their possession of uncontrolled power, to abuse it, to gratify revenge, or to promote their own personal advantage. The re- formers de serve great praise for their mode ration. The reformers did not proceed without a good deal of opposition from some of the barons, and from some of the King's relations ; but, by his energy and activity, De Montfort compelled them to submit, and to take the oaths of obedience to the Council ; and even Edward, the King's eldest son, was obliged to follow their example. In January, 1259, De Montfort was alarmed at hearing that the King's brother Richard, A.D. 1259. p 3"], [250, "208 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND. the King of the Romans, was on his way back from Germany. Richard had squandered away great sums of money, and was coming to England to raise money from his estates.

A.D. 1259, The Earl of Cornwall returns, but is not allowed to land until he has sworn to obey the new go vernment. The barons themselves now began to be impatient for the promised reformation of abuses. The changes already made were only the machinery by which the expected reform was to be carried into effect. By the original agreement, the reforms were to have been made before Christmas, 1258 ; but Simon and his friends either found their task more difficult than they had expected, or they may have been unwilling to divest themselves of any part of their power. The barons become im patient for the pro mised re forms. In October 1259, a plan of reform was enacted by the Parliament ; but, although it provided a remedy for a crying evil, the maladministration of justice, and protection to the villeins against oppres sion, it disappointed the nation, and caused a reaction in favour of the King. \" Its principal objects were to secure the inferior tenants from the oppression of their lords, and to purify the administration of justice. This latter object was to be brought about by the ap pointment of commissioners to inspect the conduct of the judges. Two were to attend in the King's Bench, two in the Exchequer, and one to attend each itinerant justice on his Circuit.

It seems that the French Parlia ment was assembled for the transaction of business, but on the first day, the French peers were kept waiting all day, in expectation of Henry's presence. Henry, however, had been so detained, by stopping to hear masses, at every church which he passed, on his way from his lodging at St. Germain to Louis's palace, that he did not arrive till it was too late to begin busi ness.

At first he declined joining in the business of the Par liament, on the ground that the town was under an interdict \u2014 as he discovered by the churches being closed. Whereupon Louis explained the reason of it. Louis then asked Henry why he so delighted to hear masses. He replied, \" Why do you so delight to hear sermons ?\" Louis answered, \"Because he found it good and agreeable, to hear frequently con cerning his Maker.\" Henry returned, \" And to me it is better and pleasanter, to see my Creator than to hear of Him.\" The two Kings then agreed to allow the peers to transact the affairs of the Parlia ment, whilst they enjoyed their devotions. Henry III. A.D. 1259. During the King's absence in Paris, civil war was on the point of breaking out between the parties of De Montfort, supported by Prince Edward, on the one hand, and that of the Earl of Gloucester on the other. This was, however, prevented by the mediation of Richard, the King of the Romans. On Henry's return from France, he found the gates and streets of London guarded, as if in time of war. With a view to put an end to the disturbances, the nobility of the kingdom were summoned to meet the King at West minster. When the Parliament was assembled, the Prince was reconciled to his father, but neither the Prince nor De Montfort was reconciled to the Earl of Gloucester, who shrank from the attempt to substan tiate certain charges he had brought against De Mont fort.

Henry III. A.D. 1201 The King again attempts to free himself from his oaths. Obtains absolution from the Pope. The power of the barons was still undiminished, and they proceeded to appoint those of whom they approved, to the great offices of state. The King now \" began to grow grievous weary \" of the Pro visions of Oxford. He never heartily set to work to study the true national interests, and could not bear that his will and his system of foreign favouritism should be curbed. He determined to set himself free, and with this view applied to the Pope for absolution from his oath ; he sent over to the King of France for help against his own subjects, and he applied to his son to assist him in getting together an army. He went to the Tower of London, seized the trea sure it contained, fortified the city, and again com pelled the citizens to take an oath of fidelity to him. He then \" took courage, and made the Lord Philip Basset his chief justiciary, against the will of the barons, by reason of which there rose a great discussion between the King and them. But he did not much regard that, for, being now resolved to proceed in the course he had already begun, he went a circuit to all the Cinque Ports, and received the oaths of fidelity from the barons of them ; and coming to Dover, he took the government of the castle from Hugh Bigod, and gave it to Edward de Waleran, together with the custody of the Cinque Ports and the county of Kent.\" 29b On the arrival of the absolution the King \" re ceived it joyfully.\" When the barons heard of this, they humbly besought the King to observe his oath ; but the King, \"in a great passion,\" refused. Nothing, however, was done till Prince Edward returned from the tournament at Paris. When he arrived he refused to accept the absolution. \" But when the Prince under-"], [254, "212 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND. stood by what councils his father had been governed he was very angry, and retired from his presence, and ad hered to the barons, according to his oath, and entered into a confederacy with them, to search out and drive away from the King, all evil counsellors and their favourers, because that by their instigation the King had been deceived, and those provisions, which the Prince then believed to be beneficial both to the King and kingdom, were now vacated by the Pope's late absolution.\"2913 Henry III.

On this occasion the King sent his justices itinerant all over England ; but the barons \" forbad all men, at their peril, to appeal or plead before them, because they had gone their circuits within less than seven years.\"29d This looks like a denial of justice; but it was not to be forgotten that the King constantly made these justices itinerant the instruments of his oppression ; and the King had given the barons ample cause to fear and distrust his every action.

De Montfort, how ever, took measures to prevent the Prince from march ing to London from Windsor to relieve the King ; and Henry, being thus disappointed of relief, thought it prudent to yield. The Queen ineffectually opposed this arrangement; which so much incensed the citizens of London, that, when shortly afterwards she attempted to go to Windsor to join her son, the people, with whom she was very unpopular, insulted her, and prepared to sink her barge with stones ; and she was obliged to take refuge in the bishop's palace near St. Paul's. Prince Edward was no party to this compromise with the barons ; and, while some of his forces plundered the country round Windsor, with others he marched to Bristol.

The barons now felt they were engaged in a mortal strife with the King's party.

In London every male inhabitant above twelve years old was sworn to be true and faithful to the barons' cause ; and orders were given, that, at the sound of the great bell of St. Paul's, all should assem ble in arms, and obey the orders of the barons' officers.

Five hundred of them were seized and put in prison, in order to extort ransom from them. One, named Cockben Abraham, was killed in his own house by John FitzJohn, one of the barons ; who, at first, intended to keep all the treasure belonging to his victim, but, afterwards, thought it would be safer to secure one half, by giving the other to De Montfort. Those were curious times, when men who fought for liberty disgraced themselves, one by murdering a Jew for his money, and the other by receiving half the plunder. It was said, that the Jews had been discovered plotting against the barons, in favour of the King ; but it is more likely, that the treasure they were supposed to possess, was the temp tation to these scenes of cruelty and inj ustice. Henry III. A.D. 1264. Alas ! The barons stain their hands with cruelty to the Jews.

All other prisoners were to be set at liberty. De Montfort, however, kept the King in his own custody ; and sent King Richard with his son Henry prisoners to the Tower. Prince Edward was confined, first in Wallingford, and afterwards in Dover Castle, of which Henry, De Montfort's eldest son, was appointed governor. The princes also are kept prisoners. De Montfort now exercised all the powers of a King. Henry was King in name, but Simon de Mont fort, Earl of Leicester, was King in deed. It was agreed, that the King should give up his power of choosing his councillors, to a committee of three ; of whom De Montfort, of course, was one ; the others were the Earl of Gloucester and the Bishop of Chi chester. To them the King gave authority, to ap point in his name, a council of nine, who were to exercise all the usual powers of government. In order to avoid a repetition of the abuses which had caused the war, it was ordered, that no foreigner, though he might come and go peaceably, should be appointed to any office ; that all the ancient and laud able customs of the realm should be observed, and Simon de Montfort rules the kingdom in the King's name."], [263, "THE QUEEN TRIES TO OPPOSE DE MONTFORT. 221 that three of the bishops should be appointed to re form the state of the Church, and to procure for the clergy, compensation for their losses during the late troubles. Henry III. A.D. 1264. But De Montfort, soon found that his power was not to remain undisputed. Henry's Queen, Eleanor, had escaped to France, and had collected a numerous army to invade England, and deliver Henry from the barons. The friends of Henry, and the enemies of De Montfort, flocked to her standard, and a numerous fleet was assembled at Damme, a fortified town in Flanders, near Bruges, to convey the army to the English shores. The Queen tries to come to the King's help. She col lects an army in Flanders. De Montfort was equally active. He collected together the whole force of the kingdom on Barham Downs, near Canterbury. The military tenants were ordered to bring into the field, not only the force specified by their tenures, but all the horsemen and infantry in their power. Every township was com pelled to send eight, six, or four footmen, well-armed with lances, bows and arrows, swords, cross-bows, and hatchets, who should serve forty days at the expense of the township ; and the cities and boroughs, received orders, to furnish as many horsemen and footmen, as the sheriff might appoint. No excuse was to be allowed, on account of the shortness of the time, the approach of the harvest, or any other private inconvenience. De Montfort himself took command of the \" channel fleet,\" and cruised about, in readiness for the approach of the invaders, watch ing the Flemish ports, to attack the ships immediately they left the harbours.

Her soldiers were many of them hired troops, who had engaged to serve her only for a limited time ; and when that time had expired they disbanded themselves, and her whole army melted away. Henry III. A.D. 1264. The Queen's army dis bands itself. The Pope tries to help the King. The Pope, too, made vain efforts to support Henry against the barons. He sent Cardinal Guido to take him under his protection ; but before the bishop had embarked from Boulogne, he was told that his life would be in danger if he ventured into England. He therefore contented himself with ex communicating the barons, and with summoning four of the bishops, to meet him at Boulogne, to be the bearers of the excommunication. The bishops were on De Montfort's side ; but they feared to disobey the cardinal, and accordingly they obeyed the summons. They took back the bull of excommunication, but allowed it to be taken away from them on their landing at Dover. The King's friends now continually urged De Mont fort to release the princes ; and in the autumn of 1264, he summoned a Parliament to meet after Christmas, to consider what should be done. To this Parliament, burgesses from towns were for the first time sum moned. This was undoubtedly the beginning of popular representation, and the origin of the present House of Commons, as I explained in my Second Lecture. De Mont fort is urged to release the princes. Parliament summoned to which town bur gesses are for the first time re- turned as members. The Parliament met on the 21st of January, 1265, and decided that Prince Edward should be released from confinement and join his father, who was still under the charge of De Montfort ; but that he should still remain in charge of his keepers.

He had imprisoned the Earl of Derby, Montfort. on a charge of plotting with the royalists ; and Glou cester, fearing the same fate, and probably equally open to the same suspicions, separated himself from De Montfort, and espoused the cause of the King. The records of these times are too scanty, to ena ble us to understand the frequent changes in the conduct of the leading men. It is supposed by some historians, that De Montfort's ambition, was the cause of the defection of these two noblemen, but it is equally probable, that they were only jealous of his power. Be this as it may, the loss of these two supporters was the beginning of De Montfort's rapid fall.

Henry III. A.D. 1265. While these negotiations were going on, Prince Edward made his escape. De Montfort had marched with his forces to Hereford ; taking the King and the Prince with him. The Prince was allowed one day to ride outside the town with his keepers, and they rode races to try the speed of their horses. A little before sunset a horseman, mounted on a grey charger, appeared on a neighbouring hill, waving his bonnet. This was a signal previously agreed on between the Prince and his friends; and the Prince, having found that his was the fastest horse, instantly galloped off towards the strange horseman. The keepers followed, but were soon left behind, and the Prince escaped.

When De Montfort heard of the Prince's escape, he issued writs to the military tenants of the crown, summoning them to meet him at Worcester. But the King's party was not inactive, and determined to cut off De Montfort's communication with the rest of England by preventing his crossing the Severn.

A.D. 1265. When Prince Edward had defeated De Montfort at Newport, he returned to Worcester, and then sent out spies to learn the movements of De Mont fort's son. They ascertained that he and his army were at Kenilworth ; and that young De Montfort and his knights did not sleep in the castle, but in the priory and neighbouring farm-houses. This was for the sake of bathing in the river Avon in the morning. He accordingly determined to sur prise them ; and, marching from Worcester in the evening, he reached Kenilworth at sunrise next morning, the 1st of August, 1265. He caught them bathing, as he had been led to expect. A writer of the time describes them as taking to flight, some of them half-naked, and others carrying their clothes under their arms in baskets. Many prisoners were taken, but Simon, with his pages, escaped into the castle. On the same day, De Montfort had managed to cross the Severn, and had halted at Kempsey, about fifteen miles from Worcester, intending to join his son the next day at Kenilworth. But Prince Edward, had marched back with his prisoners to Worcester. On learning De Montfort's movements, he marched out of the town, in the direction of Bridgenorth, to deceive him. He soon, however, crossed the Severn, at Clains ; and doubled back towards Evesham, the neighbourhood of which he reached before sunrise next morning, August 4th.

But failing in this, and in danger of being surrounded, he ordered his troops to form a circle, and oppose on all sides the pressure of the enemy.

He was unhorsed, and his assailant was about to kill him, when he called out, \" Hold, fellow, I am Harry of Winchester.\" The Prince heard his father's voice, and rushed to the rescue. At length the Welsh troops fled, De Montfort and his eldest son Henry were killed, and the King's victory over the barons was complete. Henry III. A.D. 1265. De Mont fort and his son are kill ed, and Historians are divided in their opinion of De Mont fort. Some represent him as an ambitious traitor, de sirous only of accomplishing the selfish ends suggested by his own criminal ambition ; while others, and as it appears to me with greater truth, represent him as the Avise and patriotic leader, of the popular old Eng lish, or even Anglo-Saxon party, in their struggles against Henry's oppressions and foreign predilections. Whatever may have been his motives, it is certain that to him we are indebted for the beginning of popular representation, by his having for the first time sum moned town representatives to Parliament. Other popular leaders, might possibly have seen the wisdom of giving the people a share in the government, but this might not have been the case, and it might have been long delayed. At any rate, it was Simon de Montfort who did it, and it is to him that we are indebted for that which, in the language of Sir James Mackintosh, may be termed \"the practical discovery of popular re presentation.\" 50 The same historian adds, \"The par ticulars of the war are faintly discerned at this distance of time.

The following is a part of a modern version of a ballad written soon after the fatal battle of Evesham, an early MS. of which in Anglo-Norman French, still exists in the Bodleian Library at Oxford.

In the words of Sir James Mackintosh, \" After the battle of Evesham, and the death of De Montfort, the baronial party appeared to be extinct. The Parliament assembled by the royalists, was the pliant instrument of their rapacity and revenge. The followers of De Montfort were proscribed, and their lands distributed among the conquerors. The King distinguished himself by nothing but the unmanly insolence of a feeble mind intoxicated by undeserved success.\"52 Henry summoned a Parliament to meet him at Winchester ; and found no difficulty in obtain ing: its consent to severe measures against the de seated barons and their followers. The citizens of London were deprived of their charter, and the estates of all who had followed De Montfort were confiscated. But these measures did not quiet the kingdom. The dispossessed knights and barons spread themselves as banditti all over the country, and among the number was Robin Hood, of whom I shall presently give you a more particular account. It took Prince Edward a long time to put down these opponents. He first took possession of the Cinque Ports, which had almost always been on De"], [275, "HENRY'S OPPRESSIONS. 231 Montfort's side. He then captured Winchelsea, from Henry hi. whence he proceeded to Hampshire, which, with the A.iTms. neighbouring counties of Berkshire and Buckingham- Adam de shire, were ravaged by Adam de Gordon, who was said to be the strongest man of his age. He and his followers were surprised in Alton Wood, in Hamp shire, and were defeated. The Prince was a more generous man than his father, and, having by his own personal courage overcome Adam Gordon, in admira tion of his bravery he at once pardoned him, and took him to the Queen at Guildford that very night. He thus made him a fast friend and a loyal subject for life. Many of the barons took refuge in the Isle of Ely, a.d. 1266. where they long resisted the King's forces. Kenil- KenS-\u00b0 worth also held out ; but it was at length reduced by worth' famine in November, 1266. While the siege was going on, attempts were made by some of the king's adherents, who disapproved of his severity, and were anxious to secure the good government of the country, to bring about an accommodation between the parties. A committee was therefore appointed, consisting of twelve prelates and barons, and they drew up a docu ment, called \" The Dictum of Kenilworth,\" dated October 15, 1266, which was confirmed by the King in Parliament. By this it was provided that the liberties of the The Die- Church should be preserved ; that the charters should niiwonh be observed, which, it was stated, \" the King is ex- S-Tse-6 pressly bound by his oath to keep ; \" so necessary vei% was it, even in the moment of victory, to remind the Kino-- of his duties.

At length the land was once more tranquil, and the King directed his attention to the improvement of the country. Bridges were thrown across rivers, roads were made, and at a Parliament held at Marlborough at the end of 1267, some of the most useful among the provisions of the barons were confirmed. Henry III.

Pope Clement the Fourth, who, as Cardinal Guido, had excommunicated the barons after the Battle of Lewes, was well pleased at the king's victory at Evesham, and sent over Cardinal Ottoboni to congra tulate him on his success. He seems, however, to have felt the necessity of curbing the severe spirit of Henry and his son ; for he instructed the cardinal to express his disapprobation of the harsh measures of the Parliament at Winchester, and he earnestly ex horted them to use with moderation the power they had obtained by victory. Ottoboni then turned his attention to ecclesiastical matters, and many of the regulations he made relative to the plurality of livings and other matters, remain in force to this day.

Henry HI, His charac ter. Summary of the Character of Henry the Third. Thus ends the history of a King who left behind him no love for his virtues, nor hatred for his crimes. He was an amiable, religious, man ; of elegant tastes ; but weak, vacillating, and indolent. In order to be left to the quiet enjoyment of his favourite tastes, and occupations, he was only too willing to make promises, which were no sooner made, than he found reason to break them. He had not sufficient strength of mind to remain firm to his plighted word. His reign will, however, remain memorable, so long as our constitutional government stands, as having been the time when its foun dations were first securely laid. In narrating the events of this reign, I have been constantly obliged to remark on the weak and blam- able points in the king's character ; but, it would be unjust to his memory, were I not also to point out his redeeming good qualities. Unfortunately, how- ever, these were more suited to the adornment of a private station, than to shed lustre on the character of a king. He was pure in his domestic life, and of strong religious feelings ; and he had a great love for, and was a great patron of, art. \" Henry did more to advance the progress of art than any English sovereign anterior to Edward the Third. \"54a He re- built Westminster Abbey from its foundation ; he de- corated and ornamented Windsor Castle, which was said, by a contemporary writer, to be the most magnificent palace in Europe ; and he \" repaired, or rebuilt, most of the numerous manor-houses be longing to the crown; besides contributing largely to the improvement of parish churches in all parts of the kingdom.\"543 He brought to England many"], [279, "PRINCIPAL WRITERS. 235 Italian artists; and his taste for the fine arts must have been one of the sources of that profuse ex penditure, which often involved him in difficulties. His social qualities were also great ; and he dis played them, not only in his liberal entertainments to his great men at home, but in his splendid festi vities abroad when he visited France. Henry III. His cha racter. Remarkable Persons in Henry's reign. In Henry's reign, the English language was still confined to the daily intercourse of life, and was not adopted in written books. But there were several writers, who, although they used the Latin tongue, have shed a lustre on this reign. The name of Roger Bacon is the first that presents itself. His learn ing extended over almost every branch of human knowledge. He is called an astrologer and an alchemist ; but he was really a deep student of nature, whose mysteries he skilfully unravelled. He not only understood the laws of light, but he conceived the idea of a telescope, and made some advances towards an explanation of the phenomenon of the rainbow. He knew the effects and composition of gunpowder, and was well acquainted with many branches of what is now called Natural Philosophy. The historians of the time next claim our notice, and the chief of these were monks. There was Matthew Paris, a Benedic tine monk of the monastery of St. Alban's, William Rishanger, another monk of the same abbey, and Roger of Wendover, who was originally a monk of St. Alban's.

Henry m. an account of whom the history of this reign would be very imperfect. I refer to Robin Hood. Robin Hood. Robin Hood may be looked on as a representative of the popular or Anglo-Saxon party, which had never ceased to exist from the time of the conquest. By some persons, he is looked on, almost as an imagi nary personage ; by others, as a criminal outlaw ; by others, as a ruined nobleman, who took to the woods to retrieve his fortunes by robbery. But, according to the most trustworthy accounts, he was a Saxon yeoman*, whom oppression had driven, to a life of warfare, with all oppressors and plunderers of the people. Robin Hood was a Saxon yeo man. Of his actual existence there can be no doubt. A Scotch historian, John of Fordun, who lived in the fol lowing century, alludes to him by name. \"Then,\" he says, \" arose, from among the dispossessed and banished, that most famous cut-throat Robert Hood, and Little John, with their accomplices, whom the foolish multitude are so extravagantly fond of cele brating in tragedy and comedy, and the ballads con cerning whom, sung by the jesters and minstrels, delight them beyond all others;\" but he adds, \"of whom, however, some praiseworthy facts are nar- A Scotch historian says he \" took to the woods after the battle of Evesham. * Chaucer thus describes a yeoman of the following cen tury : \u2014 ;' And he was clad in coat and hood of green.

Henry III Annual fes tivals held in his me- mory, Anecdote about Bi shop Lati mer. rated.\" Another Scotch historian, who continued Fordun's history, has a short but most valuable allu sion to Robin Hood. In narrating the events of the year succeeding the bloody battle of Evesham, when the old English party were utterly discomfited, he says, \" Robin Hood now lived an outlaw among the woodland copses and thickets.\" Of the existence, therefore, of Robin Hood there can be no question, nor is the time at which he lived doubtful ; and the reason why he took to the woods is also clear from Fordun's statement. An annual festival was held in his memory, and on that day \u2014 kept religiously by the inhabitants of the hamlets and small towns of England \u2014 none were permitted to employ themselves in anything but pastime and pleasure, and its observance lasted even over the times of the Reformation. This fact is attested by Bishop Latimer. In his sixth sermon preached before King Edward VI. he thus describes the scene that took place. \" I came once my seise to a place, riding on a journey homeward from London, and I sent word over night into the town, that I would preach there in the morning, because it was holy day, and methought it was an holy dayes work, the church stood in my way, and I took my horse and my com pany, and went thither (I thought I should have found a great company in the church), and when I came there, the church dore was fast locked.

I thought my Rotchet should have bene regarded, though I were not ; but it would not serve, it was fayne to give place to Robin Hoode's men.\" 53 Henry III. From the time of the Norman conquest, the Anglo- Saxons had taken refuge in the woods from the op pressions of the Normans. The forest of Sherwood, in Nottinghamshire, which was the principal scene of Robin Hood's adventures, is particularly mentioned as a terror to the Normans, and as the habitation of the last remnant of those Anglo-Saxons, who still preferred resisting and living on their oppressors, to submitting to their hated rule. This forest of Slier wood was visited by Richard the First, and an historian of the time says, \" he had never before visited these forests, and they pleased him much.\" Robin Hood seems to have joined these Anglo-Saxons in Sherwood forest. The Anglo- Saxons who op- posed the Normans had long gathered together in the woods. Robin Hood joins them in Sherwood forest. The life led by Robin Hood and his companions does not, it is true, admit of a complete defence, but it must not be forgotten that they represented the national struggle of the Anglo-Saxons against the Normans, and ofthe natives against foreign favourites. As to his personal character, it was very good. He never harmed a woman, as one of the old ballads makes him say, Robin Hood's per sonal cha racter. \"I never hurt woman in all my life, Nor man in woman's company.\" He never took money from the poor man ; but what he took from the rich he shared with the poor; and he never ill treated those he robbed, but they al ways went away impressed with a sense of his courtesy."], [283, "239 ROBIN HOOD. His religious duties were punctually performed \" Now a custom good, had Robin Hood, Henry III. In lands both far and near ; Every day, before he would dine, Three masses would he hear.\" This is of course an exaggeration ; but it is evidence of the character he bore. Nevertheless, he never spared the rich clergy ; but, whenever he caught them in the forest, he made them pay handsomely for their ill luck in putting themselves in his power. Many of the ballads about Robin Hood are doubtless mere fictions ; but many of them must describe events which really happened. There breathes throughout them all, a charming feeling for the beauties of the wood lands. One begins in this way : The Robiu Hood bal lads are full of love of woodland scenery. \"In summer when the shaws be sheene, [or shining,] And leaves both large and longe, Itt is merrye walkying in the fayre forrest To heare the small birdes songe. The wood weele sang, and wold not cease, Sitting upon the spraye, Soe lowde, he wakened Robin Hood, In the greenwood where he lay.\" Another thus : \" In summer when the leaves spring, The blossoms on every bough, So merry do the birdies sing, In woodys merry now.\" Robin Hood's principal companions were Little John, so called because he Avas a very big man ; Much, the Miller, a small man ; Scathlock, a bald man ; and Friar Tuck, a jolly fat friar.

Space will not allow the insertion of any of the ballads at full length, and indeed a Lecture might Avell be devoted to them alone; but I shall make selections from one of the principal ballads about him, filling up the parts omitted with such facts as will enable you to follow the story.

Robin Hood now agreed to lend him the money, gave him good clothes, mounted him on a good horse, and lent him Little John to be his squire. The knight then told Little John that he must at once go to pay the abbot, or else his land would be forfeited. The abbot and the monks thought the knight Avould not come. from the Abbot of St. Mary's.

The nun belonged to the rich clergy party, who owed Robin Hood many a grudge, and she left poor Robin to bleed to death. Robin thought he would try to get his friends, who had accompanied him to the nunnery, to come to his help : \u2014 \" He then bethought him of his bugle horn, Which hung low down to his knee ; He set his horn unto bis mouth, And blew out weak blasts three. \" Then Little John, when hearing him, As he sat under the tree, ' I fear my master is near dead, .

In one thing, he was much like his father. His left eyelid drooped, and almost covered the eye ; yet his face, and his Avhole bearing, bespoke him a man of wisdom, and of courage.

When it is remembered, that the summer and winter dresses of the King's attendants Avere furnished at his cost, and made under his roof, and that it was difficult to buy any large quantity of the cloths and furs, necessary for the clothing of a numerous retinue, except at the great fairs, it is easy to see that the Avardrobes needed ample room.

Now that the guests are seated, and ready for their repast, up comes the meat on a spit, served round by the servants, and each man cuts off a bit Avith his knife, and puts it into his Avooden bowl or on his trencher.

I cannot pretend, nor indeed can I afford space, to give a complete picture of domestic life in those days, but this slight sketch will help to bring it before your minds, and I will now endeavour to mention the principal articles of English trade and manufacture in the 13th century. There was a great trade in Avines from France and Spain, but principally from Bordeaux in the King's French province of Gascony. In the reign of Edward, Ave often read of great cargoes of Avine being cap tured by armed vessels issuing from the Cinque Ports, or five ports of Winchelsea, Dover, Rye, Hast ings, and SandAvich. These wines from Bordeaux were probably all claret, Avhich must have been then drunk in greater proportion to other wines than now, for we find that 116 barrels of Bordeaux were drunk at Edward's coronation. Wool Avas our great article of trade with foreign nations, and was sold chiefly in a raw state. But wool alone can hardly have been sent abroad in suffi cient quantities to pay for the numerous articles we were obliged to buy from foreigners, and there seems to have been a considerable trade also in tanned hides.7 There were a good many Avoollen manufactories in"], [308, "262 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND.

In order, therefore, to preserve the peace of the Land as kingdom, no time was lost in declaring the Prince to *e death King's lawful successor. On the day after the father, King's funeral, the Earl of Warrenne and Surrey, and the Earl of Gloucester, went to Westminster Abbey, and, Avith all the clergy and laity there present, swore fealty to Edward at the high altar.

He then crossed over to Italy, where he was Avell received by the Pope, Gregory X., who had been a felloAV pilgrim with him to the Holy Land. Passing through Italy, and received everywhere Avith great honour as a crusader, he crossed the Alps into Savoy, and so entered France. Edward I. A.D. 1272. On his arrival in Burgundy, the Count of Chalons, having heard of Edward's prowess, invited him to a tournament. It was not in the young King's nature to refuse such a challenge, and both sides therefore made ready for the mimic fight. Edward sent to England for knights to take part in the warlike sport, and, on the appointed day, he came to the field at tended by 1000 horsemen, besides men on foot. The Burgundians, who, in number, were nearly double the English, seem to have meant mischief from the first; and, doubtless, it Avas a suspicion of this, that made Edward send to England for his knights. The tour nament began, and the mimic fight soon became a bloody battle. The Count of Chalons, with fifty select knights, bore doAvnon the young King, and the Count engaged in a hand to hand fight Avith him. Finding he could not overcome the King with his sword, he threAv his arms round his neck, and tried to pull him from his horse. Edward spurred forward his horse, and the Count fell to the ground, and was killed. The English now set on the Frenchmen with fury, and quickly put them to the rout. After this, Edward went to Paris; Avhere, as a feudal vassal, he Avas bound to do homage, for his possessions in Gascony, to his Lord Paramount, Philip the Third, King of France.

His first employment was the correction of abuses, which had crept in during his Aveak father's reign ; and Avhich had doubtless groAvn greater, during his own long absence. The better to do this, he issued Avrits, in the middle of October, only tAvo months after he was croAvned, to inquire into the whole state of the realm ; and, directly after Easter, the next year, he held a Parliament at Westminster, at which some important laws, called \" The Statutes of Westminster the first,\" were passed. The intention of these great laws is shoAvn by the wording of the preface to them : Edward I. A.D. 1274. Edward begins his reign by correcting abuses. A.D. 1275. \" These are the acts of King Edward, made at West minster, by his Council, and by assent of the Arch bishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Earls, Barons, and all the Commonalty of the realm thither summoned.

In those days, this mattered more even than now, for the Sheriffs, Coroners, and others Avho dealt out justice, Avere then all elected by the people. \" Because elections ought to be free,\" says the Statute, \" the King commands, that no man by force of arms, nor by malice or menace, shall disturb any in making a free election.\" Once more: there was a curious, and unjust, cus tom, in many cities and boroughs, that, if any person of one city, who belonged to any society or guild in that city, owed money in another city, whoever, belonging to such society or guild, went to the city where the debt Avas due, Avas held to be answerable for the debt, although he really had nothing to do with it.

When the Saxons invaded England, some of the ancient Britons fled into Wales, where they kept their old language and laws, and were ruled over bj-\" their ancient line of kings. During the chief part of the Saxon period, Wales was divided into four portions, viz. Gwynedd, PoAvys, Dyfed, and Deheubarth, each of Avhich formed, at least at times, a distinct kingdom, and the last in cluded several smaller states. Offa, the powerful king of Mercia, Avho reigned between the years a.d. 755 and a.d. 794, compelled the Welsh kings of PoAATys to retreat beyond the Wye, and planted Saxon colonies in the tract of country lying Avest of the Severn, between that river and the borders of the mountain region, and constructed a ditch and ram part, knoAvn as Ossa's Dyke, from the mouth of the Dee to that of the Severn. The Welsh constantly broke through the rampart, but, under seATeral of the later Saxon kings, the Welsh Avere compelled to acknowledge a kind of dependence on England.25 Petty Avars between the English and Welsh bor derers were, however, always going on, and the Kings of England granted the Lords, Avhose lands joined Wales, such lands in Wales as they could Avin from the Welshmen. These Lords, Avho were called the Lords Marchers,11 introduced the English laws as much as they could, but it Avas not till Edward's conquest of Wales that English law became general.

Jury (as we noAv call it) should be brought in, in certain cases; \u2014 that is to say, that the truth of a charge should be inquired into by good and lawful men of the neighbourhood, chosen by the consent of all parties. But, in other cases, chiefly relating to debts and the like, they required that the old Welsh system should be kept. This was, that when a matter could be proved by those Avho had seen or heard, and the complaining party brought such Avitnesses as could be relied on, he should recover his demand.12 Edward I. A.D. 1275. Thus, the Welsh had long been troublesome neigh bours of the English, but the great Avar between Eng land and Wales began in this way. At Edward's coro nation, LleAvellyn the Prince of Wales Avas summoned to do homage to him, as his feudal lord ; but he refused to come, unless the King's son, the Chancellor, and the Earl of Gloucester, were given up to him as hostages for his safe coming and going. He was, or pretended to be, afraid for his life. His demand Avas not granted. He was again summoned to the Parliament at West minster in a.d. 1275, and again failed to appear. Shortly after, the King, being at Chester, on a pro gress through his kingdom, summoned Llewellyn for the third time. Once more he refused to come, again making excuse of fears for his life. These fears may have been real, as his father had been put into prison in the Tower of London, while on a visit to that city, and, in attempting to escape, he had fallen down and broken his neck (a.d. 1244). Edward now got Aveary of his vassal's disobedience, and resolved to compel him to do homage, by force of arms.

A.D. 1275, The folloAving year, an incident happened, which must have taken away the chance of any friendly agreement betAveen Edward and Llewellyn. During Simon de Montfort's visits to Wales-, in the last reign, his daughter Eleanor, a young lady of great beauty, became known to Llewellyn, who fell in love Avith her. On de Montfort's death, his Avidow and her daughter took refuge in France, whither Llewellyn now sent, to ask the King to give Eleanor in marriage to him, and to join him in an alliance against Edward. After consulting the mother, Philip granted Llewellyn's request, and the young lady Avas sent on her Avay to Wales, accompanied by her brother. All these negotiations became known to EdAvard, and, by the treachery of a knight in Eleanor's train, he also became acquainted with her intended voyage. The ship in Avhich she sailed, Avas accord ingly attacked, off the Scilly Isles, by four Bristol vessels, and the young lady and her brother Avere taken prisoners. The Princess Avas given up to the care of the Queen, but her brother Avas imprisoned, first in Corse and then in Sherbourne Castle.

Edward The King at once marched off to Chester, retook Rhuddlan Castle, and sent forces to attack the Welsh in the West and in the South. During this year he achieved no great success ; and did but little more than make ready for carrying on the war the next year. In the autumn, to keep up the warlike spirit of the nobles, he held a great tournament in London, at Cheapside ; and, in the beginning of December, he issued writs, summoning all lords, spiritual and temporal, who held of him by knight's sen-ice, to meet him at Worcester, eight days after the feast of St. John the Baptist, that is about the end of June, to aid him in putting down the rebellion of Llewellyn. attacks the Welsh with small success.

It is difficult to trace the steps by which Arthur became an object of almost worship, but it is certain that, after a time, he was looked on by the Welsh, and by all the remnants of the Ancient Britons, as the royal warrior who had successfully resisted the hated Saxons, and who would one day reign again, and trample them under his feet. For this reason, it was represented that he was not dead, but either slept, surrounded by his knights, in a vast cavern, unknoAvn to mortals ; or was transported to some happy land, beyond the earth, from whence he would return to gladden the hearts of the Britons. These vain hopes encouraged the Welsh in their rebellions, and it was therefore desirable to prove that Arthur was indeed mortal, that he had died like other men, and that consequently it was in vain to resist the English, in hopes of his victorious return. Henry the Second had tried to convince his people that Arthur was dead by a pretended discovery of his The Welsh believe in Arthur's victorious return to earth.

Edward directs his Attention to improving the Condition of England. Edward now turned his mind to matters concern ing the quiet and good government of his own kingdom. \" During the troubles of the last two reigns,\" says Rapin, \" diA^ers persons had appro priated to themselves lands to which they had no right.\" The King therefore issued writs of \" Quo Warranto,\" that is, Avrits to inquire by what warranty men held their estates. The barons resisted. \" My ancestors,\" said the Earl of Warrenne and Surrey, Avho had entertained the King with so much pomp before his coronation, \" My ancestors, coming in Avith William the Bastard, won these lands by the sword, and by the sword Avill I defend them, against any that will take them away. For the King did not conquer for himself alone, neither did my ancestors help him for that end.\" Edward found he had stirred up a nest of hornets, and was fain to give in. The barons Avere too strong for the King for some time to come. It was well it was so ; they still had work to do for England, though they did it for themselves alone. When that work was finished, they had to give way. Edward having conquered the Welsh reforms abuses in England. The barons resist. There was another weighty matter calling for the King's attention.

The sword of justice, (or of injustice,) was sharp and ready in those days. We must now return to the history of Wales. According to his promise, LleAvellyn came to London, with some of his principal nobles, and did homage to Edward on Christmas-day, a.d. 1277. The Welsh nobles, however, were but little accustomed to the comparatively civilised life led by the English, and were therefore much irritated at the manner in Avhich they were received by the Londoners. \" They came, according to their custom, attended by large reti nues, and were quartered in Islington and the neigh bouring villages.

Edward I. A.D. 1278. After the ceremony of doing homage was over, LleAvellyn was summoned to attend a Parliament, early in 1278, but he failed to appear. Edward, beginning to suspect his fidelity, went doAvn to Wales to watch him. LleAvellyn thought it best to yield ; he made excuses, and regained the King's favour so far, as to induce him to consent to his marriage with Eleanor de Montfort. The marriage took place at Worcester in the following autumn, the King paying all the cost of the solemnity. Llewellyn and his bride kept their Christmas with the King, at Westminster ; \" with great jollity,\" as the chroniclers say. Edward's conduct to Llewellyn Avas certainly generous and wise. LleAvellyn's, as will be seen, making every allowance for his own and his former subjects' feelings, was neither one nor the other. Llewellyn married to Eleanor de Montfort. The following year, a.d. 1279, Edward and his Queen went to France to do homage to Philip for the Earldom of Ponthieu, in Picardy, which had lately fallen to the Queen by the death of her mother. Edward did homage also for Aquitaine. Philip con firmed possession of these territories to EdAvard and his heirs for ever ; in consideration of which EdAvard gave up all pretensions to Normandy.

This was called the Statute of Mortmain. The power of the Church, especially in Roman Law of Catholic times, was very much abridged by this law. Men's fears on their death-beds were often excited by the priests, and, in order to atone for past crimes, they gave their lands and possessions to religious houses. These were said to pass into mortmain, or the dead hand, because no benefit to the state could then come from them. As mentioned in my last Lecture, fines were paid to the King when property changed hands at the death of the owner. But religious bodies, and other corporations, could not die, and the King therefore lost his fines for ever. Besides this, by its consequent accumulation of enormous wealth, the Church became too powerful for the good of the country.

On November 6th, the King marched forth from Rhudd lan Castle, intending to attack the Welsh in their stronghold of Snowdonia, as the district round Snowdon was called. He crossed the river Conway by a bridge of boats, and then, thinking it wise again to conquer the Isle of Angles-ey, before going into the mountains, he sent part of his army over to the island in ships.

During his absence, his soldiers guarded the bridge of Orewyn, by which he had crossed the Wye.

Mar garet, the eldest, married the Earl of Galloway, whose grandson was John Baliol ; Isabella, the second, married Robert Bruce, whose son was Robert Bruce, Lord of Annandale ; and Ada, the third daughter, married Lord Hastings, of Avhom John Hastings, Lord of Abergavenny, was the son. Baliol was therefore the grandson of the eldest daughter, Avhile Bruce and Hastings Avere the sons of the second and third. The claims of the various competitors having been heard, their further consideration was postponed till the 2nd June, the folloAving year, a.d. 1292. At this meeting, it was decided, that the claims of Baliol and Bruce should be first heard, and it was settled that the King's decision should be given on the 14th October following. On that day, the grounds, on Avhich these tAvo competitors rested their claims, having been heard, the King asked his great council, \" whether the more remote by one degree in succession, coming from the eldest daughter, ought, according to the laws and customs of those kingdoms, to exclude the nearer by a degree coming from the second sister ? or, whether, the nearer by one degree descending from the second sister, ought, by the laAvs and Decision postponed.

Edward still acted Avith the greatest deliberation, and took further time for consideration ; but, before his final decision, Bruce and Hastings each set up a claim to a third of the kingdom. It was, however, quickly decided that the kingdom of Scotland was indivisible, and on the 17th November, King Edward gave judgment in favour of Baliol. Edward I. A.D. 1292, Nov. 17, A.D. 1292, Edward decides in favour of Baliol. Orders were at once issued to the governors of the castles throughout Scotland to deliver them up to Baliol ; and the great seal of Scotland was broken into four parts, which were deposited in the treasury of the King of England, as an evidence of the pre tended sovereignty of England over Scotland. The next day Baliol swore fealty to Edward, and soon afterwards he Avas crowned at Scone. On the 26th December he did homage to Edward at Newcastle upon-Tyne. No doubt can iioav be entertained of the strict justice of Edward's decision in favour of Baliol, and, whatever opinion may be held of his subsequent conduct, there does not appear to be any valid ground for imputing to him designs against the crown of Scotland up to this time. Unfortunately for Scotland, Baliol was a weak man ; and Edward, it must be admitted, trampled on him, regardless of his pledges to the regents of Scot land. It is possible, that throughout all these trans actions, Edward may have had glimmering thoughts, that the day might come, when the divisions among Baliol a weak man, and Edward tyrannises pver him,"], [341, "295 EDWARD AND BALIOL. the Scotch nobles would give him a chance of dealing Avith Scotland, as he had dealt Avith Wales. But, if such ideas did cross his mind, he did not allow them to influence his acts before Baliol was on the throne. It is, hoAvever, unusual, to wait till the victim is firmly seated in a place of power, before an attempt is made to sacrifice him. Still, till Baliol was on the throne, Edward treated him with justice and courtesy. No sooner was he made king, than Edward became unjust and despotic toAvards him. Edward I. A.D. 1292.

This threat Avas soon put in execution ; but, in the meantime, the wretched Baliol had released King Edward from all his promises and oaths. Baliol had now to submit to still further degradation. The Earl of Fife complained, that he had been deprived of certain lands and tenements by Baliol, and appealed to EdAvard, as his Lord Paramount, for redress.

Baliol had spirit enough, for the moment, to disregard this summons, but, on Edward again summoning him to appear before his Parliament at Westminster, his heart failed him. He presented himself before the Parliament, the following Michaelmas, a.d. 1293. On being asked, what answer he had to make to the complaints of the Earl of Fife, he replied, \" I am the King of Scotland. To the complaint of Macduff, or to any matters respect ing my kingdom, I dare not make answer without the advice of my people.\" \" What means this refusal ? \" cried Edward. \" Are you not my liegeman? have you not done homage to me ? is it not my summons that brings you here ? \" Baliol still struggled in the meshes of the net, in which he was entangled, alleging, that he dared not answer Avithout the advice of his people. The Parliament supported Edward, and advised him to seize three of the strongest castles in Scotland. But he feared to go too far. He did not Avish to provoke the Scotch into open rebellion, and at last, agreed to postpone the further consideration of this business till the folloAving year. Wars with France. We must now leave Scotland for a time, as EdAvard was occupied in disputes with France, and disturb ances in Wales, during the next two years. The dispute with France began in this Avay. In the spring of a.d. 1293, certain English and Norman seamen were getting water for their ships, at a spring on the coast of Normandy, Avhen a quarrel arose between them, which ended in the death of a Norman. His countrymen tried to avenge his death, but were"], [343, "297 WARS WITH FRANCE. defeated. The Normans then complained to the Edward i. King of France, Avho gave them leave to pillage the a.d. 1293. English. A number of petty sea-fights now took place, till, at last, a large French fleet, sailing to Gascony to fetch wines, met Avith, and destroyed, a number of English ships. The inhabitants of the Cinque Ports were greatly enraged at this, and fitted out a fleet of about sixty vessels, to attack the French on their return from Gascony. In this they suc- ceeded, and gained a complete victory, seizing the Avine Avith Avhich the ships were laden. The King of France noAV demanded satisfaction of Edward, Avho, in reply, made very reasonable proposals. But the King of France would not listen to them, and ordered, that no French goods should be sent to England, and that no English goods should be allowed to come in to France. This Avas an injury to both nations, \u2014 as much to his own subjects, as to the English. In those days the true principles of commerce were not understood, and people thought they could injure their neighbours without hurting themselves.

Edmund however found great difficulties in bringing this about ; and was on his Avay to England, when he was induced to return by messengers from the Queen and Queen Dowager of France, who had lent themselves, as will presently be seen, to a plot, prepared by the King of France, to obtain possession of EdAvard's French dominions by fraud. The Queen and Queen DoAvager offered their good offices, to mediate between France and England. The conditions proposed put Edward completely in the hands of Philip. Six of the strongest castles in Gascony were to be given up to the French; an officer, appointed by the King of France, was to live, and preside in his name, in every city of the Duchy, except Bourdeaux, Bayonne, and La Reole, till peace Avas concluded ; and the King of England Avas to give hostages, for the due performance of the articles of peace, that Avere to be agreed between them.

Letters of safe conduct were to be sent to EdAvard, previous to his setting out for Amiens. Edmund wished to make sure, that these proposals were approved of by the King of France, and, with this object, he sought an interview Avith him. The King promised, on the word of a king, to do all that the Queens had promised.

But, to the great dissatisfaction of the clergy, he also seized vast sums of money, that Avere hoarded up in monasteries and cathedrals for ecclesiastical uses. Edward's foreign relations became further complicated by a quarrel Avith the King of Castile. The vessels of the Cinque Ports, which were always prowling about for mischief, seized 280 Spanish ships, laden with mer chandise for France, in consequence of Avhich, the King of Castile declared war against EdAvard. Edward remained at Portsmouth with his army, ready to embark for France, from Midsummer to the beginning of September, being delayed by contrary Avinds.24 At length he became weary of waiting, and appointed commanders to go in his stead. His fleet set sail, about Michaelmas, a.d. 1294, but part was driven back by storms, and consequently the forces which were landed in Gascony did not meet with much success. King EdAvard, having thus provided for the war with France, turned his attention to the disturbances, which had broken out in Wales, and ordered the forces, under Earl Edmund and others, which were on their way to Gascony, to march into North Wales instead. On the 11th November, they were driven back from Denbigh. Edward himself marched into South Wales, about the end of November, where he met with better success, and then marched into North Wales.

Edward having quelled the Welsh disturbances, turned his attention to the war Avith France, and sent to Baliol, the King of Scotland, as his vassal, to demand from him the assistance, to which, as his Lord Paramount, he Avas entitled. He suspected his fidelity ; and indeed, he had received information, that Baliol had entered into a treaty with France, by which it was agreed, that his son should marry the niece of the King of France, and that they should help each other in making war on Edward. Baliol refused the assistance Avhich the King of England had demanded, and prepared for war. He banished the English out of Scotland, and seized their estates. Edward now prepared to invade Scotland, and compel the submission of his vassal. At Newcastle the war broke out, without immediate intention on either side. Robert de Ros, an English nobleman, Lord of the Castle of Weark, Avas in love with a Scotch lady, and revolted to the Scots, leaving his x 3"], [348, "302 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND. brother in possession of the castle. His brother remained faithful to Edward, and, in expectation of an attack from the Scots, sent to Edward for assistance. The King sent him 1000 men, but, on their way, they were surprised at night by the Scots and defeated. Thus began the war between England and Scotland, and Edward expressed his great satis faction that it was begun by the Scots. Edward I. A.D. 1295 EdAArard at once marched on towards Scotland, and laid siege to Berwick-on-Tweed, which he took by storm, and committed a massacre on the inhabitants. The numbers slain vary, according to different histo rians, from 7000 to 17,000, and one, Matthew of West minster, goes so far as 60,000; but all accounts must have been greatly exaggerated. That this slaughter deserved the name of a massacre cannot be disputed ; partisan writers attempt to excuse it on the ground of the ferocity of the Scots, and by comparing it Avith the slaughter which has taken place in many modern sieges. But the fact still remains, that a large number of the inhabitants of Berwick were mas sacred, and Edward's name must be thereby deeply stained. A.D. 1296 Edward takes Ber wick-on- Tweed, and mas sacres its inhabit ants. Baliol now formally renounced his allegiance to Edward ; and, after the victory at Berwick, Edward advanced steadily into Scotland. Baliol renounces his alle giance. The castle at Dunbar was, at this time, one of the strongest, and by its situation one of the most important, in Scotland.17 Its lord, Patrick, Earl of Dunbar, served in Edward's army ; but his wife, the Countess, who held the castle, and hated the English, entered into a secret plot with some of the Scottish leaders, and delivered the castle up to them. As soon as Edward heard of this, he sent the Earl of"], [349, "303 WARS WITH SCOTLAND. Surrey, with a large force, to recover the castle. The Edward I. Scots, anxious to keep so important a place, led on a.d. 1296. their whole army, and took up a strong position on the high ground above Dunbar. On the appearance of the Scotch army, Surrey advanced through a valley to attack it. The Scots, misled by a seeming con fusion in the English ranks, rushed down from their strong position to attack them. The English received them in perfect order, and after a short resistance the Defeat of Scots were routed. The next day Edward advanced ateDSucn\u00b0tar. with the rest of his army, and the castle was given up to him.

This resolution was commu- nicated to the King, who, naturally, became only so much the more enraged against them, and ordered them to be put out of his protection. The meaning of this was, that they were deprived of the protection of the law. No counsellor, or pleader, was allowed to plead for them before any temporal judge. It was made known, in court, by the Chief Justice of the"], [351, "305 WAR WITH FRANCE. Common Pleas, \"that, for the future, no justice Edward I. should be done to the clergy, in the King's court, yet A]7T^97 that, nevertheless, justice should be done to all persons making complaints against them.\" This soon produced a division among the clergy, many of whom quickly submitted to the King. Those who still refused, were left to be injured and abused by any one that met them. Oftentimes, their horses were taken from them on the King's highway. Even the Archbishop of Canterbury himself, while on his Avay to court, to make complaint of these hardships, had his horses seized by the King's officers at Maid stone, and he was forced to borrow horses for the rest of his journey. His efforts to persuade the King to be more merciful were all to no purpose, for the King looked on him as the very ringleader of the obsti nate clergy, and consequently treated him Avith such severity, that he was obliged to lodge and board with a parish priest of his diocese. There can be no doubt that these proceedings of The King's the King were arbitrary and illegal, for the Parlia- ings arbi ment, by whose authority alone the money could be dfecta raised, had refused to grant it. But the struggle go- between the Crown and the Church was of good effect, as it checked the Pope's interference in the temporal concerns of the kingdom. Notwithstanding his difficulties in raising money, The King the King still determined to carry on the war with France. With this view, he entered into an alliance \u00a3ar Wlth ' _ France, with the Earl of Flanders, the condition of which was, that they should both make war with France, and that neither should make peace without the consent of the other.

His army wanted provisions, but he had no money to buy them, so he exacted 2000 qrs. of wheat and oats, and large quantities of salted meat, from each county, without payment. He then summoned a council of his military tenants, to meet him at Salisbury, to make arrangements for the in- vasion of Gascony ; but as he had no intention of going in person, the barons refused to go. Quarrel A great quarrel now arose between the King and the 1),et^en barons. The Earl of Norfolk, Marshal, and the Earl the King ' ' and the of Hereford, Constable, of England, excused them- selves from going, saying, that their offices obliged them, by their tenure, only to attend the King when he went abroad in person. \" I am ready,\" said the Marshal, \" to attend your person in the front of the army, as I am bound by hereditary right.\" \" But you shall go with others, and that without me,\" re- plied the King. \" I am not obliged, neither will I go without you,\" answered the Marshal. \" Sir Earl,\" said the King, in a violent rage, \" you shall either go or hang.\" \" Sir King, I will neither go nor hang,\" replied the Marshal, and so he departed from the King's presence. This council, however, agreed on one point, and that Avas, to compel the clergy to submit to the King. When the council broke up, and the two Earls returned to their counties, they gathered together a"], [353, "THE KING'S EXTORTIONS. 307 body of 1500 horse, to resist the King, and they Avould not alloAV the King's officers to take any wool, leather, or provisions. They also resolved to hold a separate Parliament, in the Forest of Wyre,7a on the borders of Wales, to consider how they, might best resist the King's extortions. The clergy too, under the guidance of the Archbishop of Canterbury, met together for the same purpose. But they could not agree, and, at length, the Archbishop broke up the meeting, saying, \" Let every man save his own soul.\" Edward I. A.D. 1297. Still the King persevered. He issued Avrits from Portsmouth, on the 24th May, ordering a great force to assemble at Winchelsea; and, in order to pre vent the repetition of the barons' excuses, he, this time, ordered them to meet him, to go Avith him to Flanders. But the dissatisfaction caused by his arbitrary proceedings had not died away, and the summons Avas disregarded. May 24. The barons refuse to meet the King at Ports mouth. Troubles in Scotland now began again, but the King, rather than give up his war with France, left Scotland in the hands of the Earl of Surrey, Avhom he had appointed Governor of that kingdom. Again the King summoned his barons to meet him at Win chelsea, and, not doubting he should succeed in raising forces to go Avith him, he made arrangements for the government of England, by his son, during his absence, and made an effort at reconciliation with the clergy. A meeting took place in Westminster Hall, at the beginning of July, when the King asked pardon of the people there assembled, excusing his conduct by saying that, as for \" that part of their estates which they had either given him, or his ministers had extorted from them, it Avas taken for the good of the country, and that they might enjoy Troubles in Scotland, but the King again sum mons the barons to invade France."], [354, "308 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND.

Stirling Castle is placed on the top of a high mount, which, on the north and west, de scends abruptly, by rocky precipices, to the plain ; on either side are mountainous ridges ; in front stretches out a magnificent plain, through which runs the River Forth, in a winding course, rendering approach to the castle very difficult. Wallace therefore made his arrangements with the view of inducing the English to leave their strong position and give battle on the north side of the river. A narroAv bridge Avas the only means of crossing the river, and it afforded only space enough for two abreast. Early in the morning of Friday, September 11th, a large body of English and Welsh passed over the bridge; but the Earl of Surrey, Avho, Avith Hugh Cressingham, the Treasurer, commanded the English forces, being asleep in his tent, the rest of the army had no orders to folloAv and support them, and they Avere therefore obliged to return.

The consequences of this victory were most impor tant ; castle after castle surrendered to Wallace, and in a short time not a fortress or castle in Scotland remained in Edward's hands. Prince Edward, Avho was left guardian of England during his father's absence, had become seriously alarmed at the success of Wallace, and on the 9th September, two days before the defeat at Stirling, he had issued writs, summoning a Parliament to meet him in London at the end of the month, to consider the state of the kingdom.

The Prince promised that the Charters should be confirmed, and a full pardon granted to all Avho had opposed the King. These barons therefore attended the Parliament ; but, doubtful of their safety, unless they secured it for themselves, they came, attended by 500 horse and a chosen body of foot soldiers, and would not enter the city, until they had leave to place their own guards at all the gates. At this Parliament it was agreed, that the confirmation of the Charters, and the pardon of the barons, should be sent to the King in Flanders for his seal. The King delayed his assent for three days, but at last, on the 5th November, he yielded, and peace was thus restored Avithin the kingdom.

After the decisive battle of Stirling bridge, and before Edward had prepared to return to England, Wallace had proceeded southward, and ravaged Nor thumberland and Cumberland, carrying off immense booty. The cruelties he committed were dreadful, and deprive him of the claim to be considered the noble hero he is often represented to be. But, it must be remembered that the manners of those times Avere savage, and that even EdAvard him self cannot be acquitted of cruelty in the wholesale massacre of Berwick. A great man, a true hero, is better than his times ; but this praise cannot be given to Wallace. Wallace next entered Durham, but his march Avas stopped by the severity of the Avinter. On their way, the Scotch had plundered a rich monastery at Hexham, and passing through the same place, on their return, they saw three monks, still lingering in the solitary monastery, who thinking that the tide of war had passed away, had crept back to repair the ravages it had left. The monks fled into the chapel, pursued by the savage Scottish soldiers, Avho fancied they had returned to guard, or carry off, some hidden treasures. The soldiers bade the monks say where the treasures were to be found. \" Alas!\" said one of the monks,\" it is but a short time since you yourselves have seized the whole of our property, and you best know where it now is.\" At this moment Wallace entered, and commanding his soldiers to be silent, requested one of the monks to celebrate mass.

Still, the jealousy of the nobles crippled him greatly, and he was unable to muster a force powerful enough to meet the English in the open field.

Bruce crowned on March 27, A.D. 1306, Edward received the news of this formidable revo lution in Scotch affairs at Winchester, whither he had gone after making a tour of pleasure through Dorset and Hampshire. Although now nearly sixty-five years of age, and hardly able from his corpulence to mount on horseback, or to lead his armies in person, he at once prepared for a seventh invasion of Scot land ; but he was obliged to intrust its command to others. This was the age of chivalry, and in order to give greater spirit to the intended expedition, he availed himself of its imposing ceremonies.

To narrate his romantic adventures would require a Brace's volume in itself. He and his companions lived on the aaventures. roots and berries of the woods ; on the venison they procured by hunting ; on the fish they caught in the rivers ; and the skins of the deer and the roe furnished them with bedding. Their wives and daughters shared their perils and increased their difficulties.

Bruce soon folloAved him, and they then ventured to land in Scotland, where they surprised Turnberry Castle. Shortly after this, Douglas regained possession of his oAvn castle by stratagem ; he entered it in disguise, found his retainers ready to welcome his return, and planned an attack on the English, Avhich proved successful. Bruce noAV however met Avith a disappointment which nearly caused his ruin. Some reinforcements which he expected from Ire land Avere unfortunately intercepted, and put to the rout, and Bruce was again a wanderer among the mountains attended by only sixty men. The English pursued him closely, and tried to hunt him down with bloodhounds. At night Bruce waited for his pursuers at a narroAV gorge, where one man could defend himself against a multitude ; he heard the baying of the hounds, and by the light of the moon he saAV his enemies approach. One by one he sleAV his foemen as they came, till, at length, being joined by his little band, whom he had planted a little distance off, he put his enemies to flight.

Whereof &c. Witness at the King's Manor of Chilterne Langele, the fifth day of January. By letter of the private seal and by the counsel. NOTE A. (Page 283.; It is difficult to assign any reason why Edward the Third was not created Prince of Wales ; but Henry the Sixth, probably, was not so created because he was only a few months old when he became King. Edward the Sixth was about to be created Prince of Wales when his father died ; Charles the Second was declared Prince of Wales, although, probably on account of the troubles of the times, he was never so created ; and, lastly, James Francis Edward, the Pretender, was styled Prince of Wales, but was never so created, doubtless because William of Orange landed soon after his birth. NOTE B. (Page 283.) \" In the thirty-first year of the reign . of Henry the Third (a.d. 1246), the Earldom of Chester was annexed to the En glish crown for ever, and was conferred by him, in the thirty-"], [383, "337 NOTES eighth year of his reign (a.d. 1253), on his younger son Edmund, who afterwards surrendered it to his elder brother Prince Edward. By act 21 Rich. II. cap. 9, the Earldom of Chester was erected into a principality, and, although this act was repealed by act 1 Hen. IV. cap. 3, the Earldom of Chester has, ever since, been granted in conjunction with the Principality of Wales.\" 28 NOTE C. (Page 283.) The first creation of a Duchy in England was by a charter granted by Edward the Third, dated March 17th, a.d. 1337 (11 Edw. III.), in favour of his son, named Edward the Black Prince, who had been created Duke in Parliament, Monday next after the Feast of St. Matthew preceding, to hold to himself and to the eldest sons of him and his heirs, Kings of England; by virtue of which charter, the eldest son of the King of England is by law acknowledged Duke of Cornwall the instant he is born. The Dukedom, however, reverts to the crown if the King's eldest son dies during his father's lifetime, leaving a son ; for the holder of the Dukedom must be the King's eldest son, as well as heir to the throne. It cannot, therefore, descend to the King's second son, in the event of the King's eldest son dying without issue. This explains the reason why Richard the Second and Henry the Fifth were created Dukes of Cornwall, who were not so by birthright. Richard the Second was not a King's son, but grandson, his father, the Black Prince, having died before the death of Edward the Third ; Henry the Fifth was not the heir of the person (the Black Prince) originally created Duke of Cornwall, but of his younger brother, viz., John of Gaunt, the fourth son of Edward the Third, who was the father of Henry the Fourth, the direct line having died out in Richard the Second. Edward the Fifth was created Duke of Cornwall, although the eldest son of the reigning monarch, who was himself the heir of the Black Prince, his father probably con sidering it the safer means of investing the Duchy in him ; inas much as he was not born Duke of Cornwall, and only became so by the death of Edward Plantngenet."], [384, "EDWARD HI. died a.d. 1377.

TO ILLUSTRATE THE GENEALOGY OF THE DUKES OF CORNWALL."], [385, "339 NOTES In consequence of the interest and importance of this subject at the present moment, I here add the following extract from the \" London Review,\" of February 28th, 1863 : \u2014 \" The Earldom of Cornwall, which preceded the Duchy, may be said to be coeval with the Conquest. Earl Robert of Mortaigne, the half-brother of the King, is returned in Domesday Book as the holder of nearly all the county, the Church lands and a few manors held by the King himself excepted. The rapacious Earl had even stolen some of the Church lands (Jianc terrain abstulit comes ecclesi\u00e6 S. Michaelis, says the record). The Earldom was always in the hands of the King, or of some prince of the blood, down to the time of the creation of the Duchy by Edward III., but its possessions were squandered by the profuse grants of successive holders. In the reign of Henry III., however, the revenue of the Earldom was so large, as to prove formidable to English liberties ; in the struggles between the King and De Montfort, the King's brother Richard, the King of the Romans, devoted his wealth to the pay of German merce naries, and there are manors in Cornwall whose names still show that they were once held by the free-lances who fought at the battles of Lewes and Evesham. Edward III., as is well known, created the Duchy of Cornwall in the person of his son the Black Prince, and upon the true interpretation of the words of the gift, 'Eidem Duci et ipsius et h\u00e6redum suorum regum Angli\u00e6 filiis primogenitis et dicti loci ducibus in regno Angli\u00e6 hereditarie successuris,' depends the controversy between Mr. Gladstone, Mr. A. Smith, and Sir John Trelawny. Luckily we are not called upon to interpret the limitation anew, as its meaning has been settled by several precedents. The first question upon it arose upon the death of the Black Prince in the lifetime of his father, leaving a son afterwards Richard II., and it was decided that Richard did not succeed to the Duchy because he was not the first-born son of a King of England. This precedent would be perhaps out of date, but no similar circumstance occurred till the death of Frederick, Prince of Wales, in the lifetime of George II., when an Act of Parliament (33 Geo. II. cap. 10) was passed, which declared the King to be Duke of Cornwall, and gave him a power of leasing the possessions of the Duchy. Mr. Augustus Smith was, therefore, quite right last week when he said that on the death of a Prince of Wales leaving a son, the Duchy reverted to the crown ; and although Mr. Gladstone's statement in reply was correct in its facts, it had no bearing on the argument. Mr. Gladstone's facts were an .answer to the second question \u2014 whether on the death of a Prince of Wales without issue, but leaving a second brother, the Dukedom would pass to that brother ; and it is clear that, according to former decisions, it would. The second son fulfils the condition of being a King's son, which the son of the Prince would not be ; and although it might be thought that he was not primo genitus, yet it has been settled that this word is not restricted to the son"], [386, "340 NOTES actually first-born, but includes the first-born surviving son. This was decided upon the death of Arthur, the eldest brother of Henry VIII., and upon the death of Henry, the eldest brother of Charles I., and was acted upon in the case of the deaths of the infant children of Henry VIII., and the infant eldest brother of Charles II. Coke, indeed, reports dif ferently in the Prince's case ; but, his report on this point was declared by the Lord Chancellor Ellesmere, who presided at the trial of the case, to be erroneous, and it was disapproved of in the last century by Lord Hardwicke. Sir John Trelawny was, therefore, wrong in denying that a second son of the King would succeed to the Duchy of Cornwall upon the death, in the lifetime of the father, of the first son without issue, and we may perhaps correctly and succinctly describe the qualifications of the Duke of Cornwall, when we say he must be the son and heir-apparent of the reigning Sovereign ; and if there be no such person, the Duchy is, pro tempore, merged in the crown. \" It must not be concealed that the ameliorated condition of the Duchy of Cornwall may hereafter be a source of anxiety. The proposal to charge the jointure of the Princess Alexandra upon its revenues, to the principle of which the Chancellor of the Exchequer half assented, could not, it is plain, be entertained without an infringement not only of the private rights of the Queen, but of those of the possible future Dukes, the younger brethren of the Prince. On the other hand, an accumulation, under present circumstances, of the revenues of the Duchy during a minority coexistent with that of the Prince of Wales, would produce two millions of money, and render the heir to the Crown virtually independent of Parliament. The danger may be to us imaginary, but it remains possible, and its existence should be remembered.\""], [387, "PLANTAGENET LINE. TABLE SHOWING THE DESCENT OF EDWARD I. Henry II. mar.

The First and Third Edwards were both great kings ; but Edward the Second, unfortunately, possessed no single quality to make us love or respect him. He was, in everything, the very opposite of his father, whose dying commands it was the first act of his reign to disobey. He was, seemingly, of an easy disposition, but his yielding temper was only weak ness, and his semblance of good nature was rank VOL. I. *A A"], [394, "346 lectures on the history of England. Edwd.

His inordinate affection for his two favourites, Piers Gaveston, and the younger Despenser, involved him in perpetual quar rels with the barons, which certainly, in their result, fostered and strengthened the constitutional liberties of the people, but, in their immediate effect, interfered seriously with the wars of conquest or defence in which the country was then engaged. The romantic incidents of Bruce's heroic exploits, and the breaking up of the famous order of the Knights Templars, give an interest to the history of this reign, which would otherwise be a mere record of the struggles between a weak tyrant and depraved favourites, on one side, and selfish barons on the other. Cruel and lawless murders, and legal, but not less cruel, executions were perpetrated on both sides, and we seek in vain for a single public man, of either party, during the whole of this reign, whose character we can contem plate with pleasure. All that the barons cared for, was, to gain more power for themselves, and thereby prevent the King from taxing them too heavily, or interfering with the course of justice. In their re sistance to the King they were influenced by their own personal interests only : no trace of large views, or general principles of government, such as are to be found in that corner-stone of our liberties, the Magna Carta, is discoverable in their proceedings. But yet, while intending to work only for themselves, they, without dreaming of it, worked for the advan tage of posterity also. There is, however, in this reign, one remarkable"], [395, "THE KING'S AFFECTION FOR GAVESTON. 347 exception to this charge of narrowness, which, while Edwd.n. on the one hand it proves the short-sighted views of a.d7i307. the barons in general, yet shows, on the other, an Remark apparent enlightenment of one among them, worthy of ceptionto a later age.

I shall relate this incident in its due course. Having thus given you a sketch of the general cha racter of this reign, I shall now proceed with the continuous history. The King's affection for Gaveston. Edward the First died on July 1st, a.d. 1307, and Hisac- cgssioti was succeeded by his son Edward of Carnarvon, the first Prince of Wales, who was then in the twenty fourth year of his age. Before the death of the old King, Bruce had been very successful in Scotland against the English, and the great King therefore, though through illness hardly able to move, had roused himself for a last struggle against his obstinate foe ; but he died in the attempt. Feeling that his end was His near, he called to him his son, and made him promise, dyirTgcom by all that was holy, to carry on the war against mands- Bruce, till Scotland lay at his feet ; to take his father's bones with him as a constant reminder of the promise he had made and as a token of his fidelity, and not to bury them till the war was crowned with success. Edward also made his son promise that his heart should be taken to the Holy Land.

Gaveston recalled by the King. man, who had done great service to the King, in his wars with France, and he had been brought up, from his youth, with the young prince as his companion. He was handsome, skilled in arms, and of a lively ready wit. But he was licentious and depraved, and gave the young prince ill advice and led him into evil habits. The old King therefore, in a great Council, held at Carlisle, at the end of February, only a few months before he died, fearing that Gaveston would utterly corrupt his son, had banished him from the kingdom, and he now, on his death-bed, bade his son not to recall him. Every one of these dying commands Edward the Second disobeyed, so soon as the breath was out of his father's body. He at once prepared for the late King's burial in West minster Abbey, made no serious attempt to conquer Scotland, and recalled Gaveston from exile. On the death of his father, the young King re turned to Carlisle, to prepare for continuing the war; and on the 1st of August, he marched to Dum fries, where he received the homage of some of the Scottish nobles, and then, marshalling his army in three divisions, he seemed to make ready for battle. But Gaveston, obeying without delay the young King's summons, suddenly returned from exile ; and Edward, at once, gave up all thoughts of lead ing the army in person* He received Gaveston with extravagant marks of affection, called him his brother, and created him Earl of Cornwall. Having resolved to return to England, he appointed Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke, guardian of the kingdom of Scotland, \" leaving with him powers to give what terms he thought fit to all the Scots that would submit, except such as had been concerned in"], [397, "HONOURS HEAPED ON GAVESTON. 349 Edwd.

Comyn's murder, or in promoting the last insur rection.\"1 The war with Scotland was carried on, but with out skill or energy, for seven years. The master mind of the great King no longer directed its man agement, and the changeable caprices of his son, who appointed six different Governors of Scotland during one year, weakened the spirit of the invaders, till at last, the fatal battle of Bannockburn seated Bruce firmly on the throne. I shall reserve the history of those wars till I reach the period at which that battle was fought, and in the meantime proceed with the personal history of the King, and the events which happened in England. On his return to England at the beginning of his reign, Edward continued to heap favours on Gaveston. Early in November, he married him to his niece Margaret de Clare, sister of the young Earl of Glou cester, and daughter of his own sister, Joanna of Acre, who had married Gilbert de Clare, the former Earl of Gloucester. He also granted him the hon ours, or great manors, of Wallingford, St. Valery, and Knaresborough ; the chase of, or right of hunting over, Dartmoor; the whole county of Cornwall, and all the estates of Edmund, late Earl of Cornwall. He made him his Secretary, and created him Great Chamberlain of England.2 The Earls of Lancaster and Hereford, and other barons who afterwards rose in rebellion against the Kino- and his favourite, concurred in these acts of the King.3 They did not yet know their sovereign's character. All these foolish favours puffed up Gaves ton with insolent pride, and he amused himself and the King, by turning the barons into ridicule. He A A 3"], [398, "350 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND. gave them nicknames, calling the Earl of Lancaster, \" The Stage Player \" and \" The Old Hog ;\" the Earl of Pembroke, \" Joseph the Jew ;\" and the Earl of Warwick, \"The Wild Boar of Ardennes\" and \" The Black Dog of the Wood.\" In an old play, on the life and reign of Edward the Second, by Mario w, these scurrilous practices of the King and his favourite are thus alluded to78 : Edwd.

Gaveston also gave much offence to the barons, by overcoming them at a great tournament, held early in December, at his castle of Wallingford, to which he invited various foreign knights, highly skilled in this warlike sport, who were more than a match for the English ; and he did not hesitate to avail himself of treachery also to secure victory to his side. \" Hearing that a party of brave knights were coming to join his adversaries, he went pri vately out of the place at the head of two hundred knights, attacked and dispersed them.\"4 Gaveston holds a tourna ment at Walling ford. The regular course of the history must here be interrupted to introduce an account of the rise and overthrow of the famous order of the Knights Tem plars ; for it was in this year, a.d. 1307, that measures for their destruction were first taken.

J J"], [399, "ORDER OF THE KNIGHTS TEMPLARS. 351 Edwd. II. A.D.130: Origin of the order. The abolition of the order in France was accom plished by Philip the Fair, with the assistance of Pope Clement V., a mean-spirited prelate, whom Philip had raised to the Papacy, as a compliant tool to work with. Blasphemy, and crimes of the most revolting nature, were laid to their charge, but were not proved ; and there can be but little doubt that these charges were false as applied to the order in general, and that their enormous wealth was the temptation to their destruc tion by the King of France. The order of the Knights Templars was instituted in the year a.d. 1118, about twenty years after the taking of Jerusalem by the first Crusaders. Originally nine noble knights, who had distinguished themselves at the siege, banded themselves together to protect the pilgrims to Jerusalem, and Baldwin II., King of Jerusalem, granted them a place of habitation within the sacred inclosure of the temple of Solomon on Mount Moriah. They were thence known as the Knights of the Temple of Solomon. It soon, however, became necessary for these knights to add to their numbers, and to undertake the defence of the king dom of Jerusalem against the Mahometans ; and Hugh de Payens was chosen as their first leader, under the title of Master of the Temple. In a.d. 1128, Pope Honorius V. constituted them a religious order, under rules of the greatest strictness. It is unnecessary here to enter into a history of the heroic doings of these Knights Templars during the Wars of the Crusades : it is sufficient to state that their wealth and renown increased with wonder ful rapidity.

At length, in the year a.d. 1299, the Templars were signally defeated by the Saracens, and the Christians were utterly driven from the Holy Land. All hopes of regaining possession of Palestine were now entirely given up, and the purpose for which the order of the Knights Templars was instituted was at an end. Had their services still been required for the defence of the Christians in Palestine, or had their enormous wealth been still devoted to the sup port of soldiers defending Christianity against Islam ism, it would not have been so easy for Philip to have accomplished their destruction. But their course having been run, Philip could rob them with impunity ; and the charges brought against them tended to stifle sympathy for their fate. As I have already stated, there is no sufficient ground for believing that the crimes imputed to them were characteristic of the order ; but it is not unlikely that individuals among them may have been tainted with Eastern vices, and the rules which they swore to obey required such superhuman virtue, that it is probable some of them may have been tempted, by the impossible austerities required of them, to fall into the opposite extreme of laxity. Some pretence of justice may therefore have been put forward in pronouncing their condemnation. The charge of blasphemy, too, may have had some apparent founda tion, from a misconception of the meaning of some of their ceremonies. Thus, it was stated, that when a knight was admitted to the order, he was compelled to express his disbelief in Our Saviour, and even to spit on the Cross. It seems probable that he was obliged Crimes imputed to them ab surd as against the order, but indivi- duals may have been guilty.

Edwd. II. A.D. 1307. Confession of the crimes imputed to them was ex torted from the Templars by tortures of horrible barbarity ; and the victims were given to understand that confession would be followed by pardon, while persistence in the assertion of innocence would be looked on as an aggravation of their crimes. Confession of crimes was ex torted by torture. In England, it was long before torture was made use of to force the Templars to confess ; but both Edward II. and his father were actuated by the same motives in attacking the order. Shortly after the total loss of Palestine, Edward I. seized and appro priated to his own use the moneys accumulated by the Templars, alleging that the purpose for which their property had been granted to them no longer existed ; and Edward II., on his accession, went with his minion Gaveston to the Temple in London, and carried off a large amount of treasure belonging to the order. Edward I. and Ed ward II. seize the property of the Tem plars. So soon as Philip the Fair had issued orders for the seizure of all the Knights Templars in France, he wrote to the principal sovereigns of Europe, urging them to follow his example, and, among others, to Edward II., who had just ascended the throne. The young King expressed his disbelief in the charges against the Templars, but summoned the seneschal of Agen in Guienne, the originator of them, to ap pear before him, in order that he might be examined Philip of France urges the King of England toimprison the Tem plars."], [402, "354 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND. as to their truth. The result of the inquiry was, that, on the 4th December, a.d. 1307, Edward wrote to the Kings of Portugal, Castile, Aragon, and Sicily, expressing his disbelief in the charges, and a few days afterwards he wrote to the same effect to the Pope. But the Pope had issued a bull, a short time previously, calling on Edward to arrest all the Templars in his dominions ; and, on receipt of the bull, the King, either believing in their guilt, or hoping to get possession of their wealth, promised obedience.

On the 8th of January, a.d. 1308, the Templars in all parts of England were suddenly arrested, and their property was seized by the King. Then followed scenes as lamentable, and as terrible, as those which were simultaneously taking place in France. Warriors who had fought to the last in the Holy Land \u2014 grey headed knights never before suspected of crime \u2014 were brought up before the Pope's inquisitors, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Bishops of London and Lincoln, and accused of a long series of crimes.

But the moment of weakness had passed away, and, although he well knew the terrible fate that would befall him, on being called on to avow his guilt in the face of an assembled multitude, he rose triumphantly, declaring that it was only the pain of torture that had caused him to admit the truth of the charges against him, asserting his innocence, and denouncing his judges, till he was interrupted and hurried back to prison. The next day he was slowly burnt to death. Thus ends the history of this great order ; and from the nature of the evidence, and the mode in which their trial was conducted, it is impossible to come to any other conclusion than that, whether they were guilty or not guilty, the charges were utterly unsupported by a tittle of proof which, in a modern court of justice, would for an instant weigh against them.79 Events from the King's Marriage until the Death of Gaveston. At the end of January in the following year, the King went to France to marry Isabella, daughter of Philip the Fourth (called the Fair), King of France. She was only sixteen 14 years old, but was considered to be the most beautiful woman of the time. The King sailed from Dover on the 22nd of January, was married, with great splendour, at Boulogne on the 28th, and returned to England on the 7th of February. \" This marriage was the cause of the longest and bloodiest wars that ever desolated France, for it was in her name that Edward the Third made claims to the throne of France.\"15 Although the King was absent from England for"], [405, "THE KING'S CORONATION. 357 little more than a fortnight, yet he appointed Gaves ton Guardian of the Kingdom during his absence, giving him power to control all Church preferments, and granting to him feudal rights not usually con ceded to guardians, though of royal family.5 On his return, when the great men of the kingdom came to meet him at Dover, he received none with such affection as he bestowed on his minion Gaveston, \"giving him the sumptuous presents of fine horses, rings, jewels and other curiosities of great value presented to him by the King of France on his mar riage.\"6 All these injudicious follies exasperated the nobles to such a degree that they demanded Gaves ton's banishment, threatening to stop the King's coronation, unless he yielded to their demands. Edwd. II. A.D. 1308. Gaveston appointed guardian of the kingdom. On the king's re turn he disgusts the barons by his love for Ga veston. The King, accordingly, promised, that, at the next Parliament, he would yield whatever they should require of him ; and the barons then consented to the King and his Queen being crowned at West minster Abbey on the 23rd of February. But still, the King's madness and Gaveston's insolence could not be kept within bounds. Edward appointed Gaveston to carry the crown before him at the coro nation, and Gaveston insulted the nobles, by the superior splendour of his apparel, \" being dressed finer than the King himself.\" 7 The coronation oath taken by the King was as follows : King pro mises amend ment. His coro nation. \" The Bishop of Winchester.

Liberties derived from Ed ward the Confessor. The barons now, having no belief in the King's promises, determined to seize Gaveston, and they hunted him over half the kingdom. The only one among them, who still adhered to the King, was Hugh le Despenser, the father of the King's future favourite.18 The barons exaspe- rated. Gaveston went first to his castle at Wallingford, and then, searing he was not safe there, fled to the King at Windsor. The barons, being unable to find him, held a great meeting at Northampton to con sider the affairs of the kingdom, \" threatening those who should neglect to come in to them, with no less than the plundering and destroying of their houses and estates.\" 38 Here it was agreed tbat \" if the King does not govern according to reason, the barons are Gaveston flees from their fury."], [407, "THE KING'S MISGOVERNMENT. 359 bound by their oath to bring him back to reason.\" l9 Edward now got frightened, and summoned a Par liament, which met at Westminster in the spring. The King still tried to protect his favourite, but the Parliament decreed, that he should be banished from the kingdom for ever. Edward obtained leave how ever for Gaveston to go to Ireland, of which he appointed him Governor, and such was the infatua tion of this wretched King, that he went with Gaveston to Bristol, from whence the minion em barked for Ireland. Edwd. II. A.D. 1309, Gaveston banished, on May 18, but goes to Ireland. During this period the whole government of the kingdom went on badly. Bruce, as you will shortly hear, continued to gain more and more power in Scot land, the crown property in England was being wasted, and the course of justice was interfered with. The barons complained, among other things, that the King's purveyors took all kinds of provisions without pay ment; that additional duties had been laid on wine, on cloth, and on other foreign produce; that the coin was debased; that the King's officers held pleas which did not fall under their cognizance, and exercised authority beyond the \"verge,\" that is, a circuit of twelve leagues round the King's person.

His pre sence at a council displeases the barons, Earldom of Cornwall, and it was only on the con firmation of the Great Charter, and the Charter of the Forests, that Parliament consented to grant the King \"the 25th penny of all their personal estates.\"39 Shortly afterwards (on July 26th), Edward held a Council or Parliament, at Stamford, to consider what should be done to resist Bruce's progress in Scotland, and at this Parliament the King contrived, by promi sing redress of the barons' grievances, to obtain leave for Gaveston to remain Earl of Cornwall. Gaveston had now been living in banishment for more than a year, but in great splendour and power. The King could bear his absence no longer, and, without con sulting his Parliament, he sent to him to return, and even went to Chester to meet him. On his return, \" Edward received him with transports, which con vinced all the world that he loved him to distraction, and carried him to Langley in Hertfordshire, where he kept him some time to himself; not caring to be di verted by the Queen, his ministers, or others, a moment, from enjoying his company.\"8 This greatly disgusted the barons, who appointed tournaments in different places, in order to get their partisans together, and concert measures for wreaking their vengeance on Gaveston. The King, fearing the barons would thereby gain too great power over him, put down these tournaments by proclamation.9 Soon after Gaveston's return, on October the 18th, the King held a Council at York, at which Gaveston was present as Earl of Cornwall, in consequence of which the Earls of Warwick, Lancaster, Oxford, Lin coln and Arundel40 refused to attend. These barons were probably absent from the council at Stamford, at which it had been agreed that Gaveston might"], [409, "361 COMMITTEE OF ORDAINERS. remain Earl of Cornwall, but, granting even that they Edwd. n. were bound by the act of the barons who were present, ~~ n , , . , \u201e -,1 A.D. 1309. braveston s unauthorised return to England, was a sufficient justification of their refusal to attend a council, at which he was present.

The King, however, instead of yielding to their just complaints, consulted Gaves- ton as to what he should do, and, by his advice, he sent over to his dominions in Gascony for soldiers. Three hundred horse were accordingly sent forth from thence, to march through France on their way to England. But the King of France, moved doubt- less by his daughter's complaints, refused to allow them to pass through his kingdom, and they were therefore AD obliged to return. At length, the King was forced to The King yield, and, at a Parliament held on the 16th of March, yields- in the following year, he agreed to the appoint- ment of a Committee of \" Ordainers,\" to reform the \"Ordain- kingdom.

In principle it was similar to the proceedings which resulted in Magna Carta ; and, indeed, the Reform Bill of a.d. 1830, may be looked on as a modern result of a ' Com mittee of Ordainers.' The Ordinances of a.d. 1311 do not lay down general principles, such as are to be found in Magna Carta, for their object was rather to compel obedience to existing, than establish new principles for the security of liberty, nor do they, like the Reform Bill of a.d. 1830, attempt to adapt the admitted principles of government to the exi gences of advancing civilisation ; but they are, never theless, entitled to our approval, as the result of peaceable measures to counteract the tyrannic folly of the King. In September the King invaded Scotland ; but Bruce utterly despised him, and said \" that he was more afraid of the bones of his father, even when dead, than he was of the son, though living ; and it was much more difficult to get half a foot of land from Edward the First, than a kingdom from his successor.\" 10 Edward had some trifling successes, but gained no lasting victory.

Finally it was ordained that one bishop, two earls, and two barons should be appointed in every Parliament, \"to hear and determine all the complaints of those that will impeach the King's ministers, whosoever they are, for doing anything contrary to these ordinances.\" 43 One would have thought that the solemn and important arrangements, made by these ordinances, would have roused the King to a sense of his duty, but we shall soon see that he was \" irreclaimable.\" 44 In compliance with the ordinances, Gaveston went to France in the beginning of November, a.d. 1311, but he soon left that country for Flanders, thinking himself not safe in France, \" because that the King hated him on the Queen his daughter's account.\" 45 The Parliament which confirmed the ordinances sat for nearly two months, having great difficulty in bringing the King to agree to them : at last he did so, but \" only under a private protestation against them, to the effect that, if they contained anything to his damage or prejudice, or contrary to"], [413, "365 GAVESTON RETURNS.

They threatened then to come armed, having no confidence in the King's observing the ordinances 47, but they were forbidden to do so by the King. In the meantime Gaveston found himself \" uneasie \" 48 in Flanders, and was bold and foolish enough to return to England. The King, expecting his return, again prorogued the Parliament, and went to York to meet him. He kept his Christ mas there, in company with Gaveston and other foreigners. This greatly disgusted the Queen and the barons, who \" now saw the King to be irreclaim able.\" 49 Edward tried to justify his reception of Gaveston, by the fact of his having protested against the ordinances, and in February (a.d. 1312) he issued declarations to all the sheriffs in England, stating that Gaveston had been banished contrary to law, and commanding them to restore to him his lands, with the profits thereof. Finding that these decla rations produced no effect, he offered to treat with the barons concerning the ordinances. This they of course refused, and banded themselves together to resist the King. They did this very unwillingly, being \"loath to raise a civil war against the King.

In Gaveston's baggage were found many jewels belonging to the crown, of which an exact inventory was taken, that an account might be given of them thereafter. As soon as the Earl of Lancaster was informed of the King's departure from Scarborough, and of his leaving Gaveston there, he sent the Earls of Pembroke and Warren to besiege that castle, while he himself marched with the rest of his army towards the centre of the kingdom, so as to frustrate any attempt of the King to raise an army for the relief of Scarborough. Pembroke and Warren soon compelled Gaveston to surrender himself a pri soner to them, on condition of his life being spared. He was committed to the care of the Earl of Pem broke, who carried him towards Wallingford, Gave ston's own castle, where he intended to keep him in safety, till it was settled what should be done with him. When, however, he arrived at Dedding ton, about four miles from Banbury in Oxfordshire, the Earl of Warwick availed himself of a temporary absence of the Earl of Pembroke, to seize Gaveston, and carry him off to Warwick Castle. \" The black dog of the wood\" was glad to have an opportu nity of using his teeth.

It seems that, although the King had agreed to the ordinances, yet they were not practically acted on, for the barons now again demanded that they should be confirmed, and put in execution. Not receiving any satisfactory answer from the King, the barons assem bled their forces at Dnnstable, with the view of pro ceeding to London, where the King then was, and compelling him, by force of arms, to yield to their demands. The King got frightened, and sent his nephew, the Earl of Gloucester, with certain bishops, and two nuncios, or ambassadors, from the Pope, to treat with the barons, at Wheathampstead near St. Albans, whither they had advanced. \" The King, on his part, promised to grant a general pardon to them, and to all their adherents, reserving power to grant the like to those that had favoured Gaveston's return.\" 26 The King evades the ordi- nances.

But what safe conduct soever he offered him, it was not possible to persuade the Earl to put himself in his power, before the pardon wras proclaimed.\"27 Shortly after this reconciliation, the King's eldest son, who afterwards became Edward the Third, was born at Windsor on November 13th. All this time, the Scots, profiting by the divisions of the kingdom, and the weakness of the King, were vexing and harassing the North of England. The King and Queen spent their Christmas at Windsor, surrounded by foreigners, who did all in their power to prejudice the King against the barons. We thus see, that, while the realm, more and more, needed unity and strength, the King, by his folly, did nothing but increase its divisions and weak ness, and thus kept preparing the way for his own tragic end.

On the return of Edward and Isabella to England, a Parliament Avas summoned to meet in September. At this Parliament, the King, forgetting the conditions on which he had made peace Avith the barons, set up complaints against them for putting Gaveston to death. The Earl of Lancaster, Avho came \" with a great number of armed attend ants, raised from his oAvn tenants,\" 51 and Avith other barons, answered, that they had only destroyed a public enemy, and they further declared that they Avould no longer trust the King. Peace, however, betAveen the King and the barons was soon restored, but again on terms humiliating to the barons. They agreed to humble themselves before their Sovereign, and beg his pardon ; while the King, on his part, only promised that \" he would no longer question any man for the death of Gaveston.\" 52 It is difficult to find a sufficient cause for the barons yielding in so humiliating a manner. They gained absolutely nothing from the King, except an escape from the possible penalties of the murder of Gaveston by some of them. But, having gone so far, they should not have drawn back, until they had compelled the King to govern his people as laAV and justice required. The King on the other hand gained everything, or seemed to do so. He humbled the barons and granted nothing but pardon for a crime Avhich he Avould not then have dared to punish.

England and Scotland, since the beginning of the reign of Edward the Second, but glancing back, occasionally, at Avhat happened at the same time in England, in order that you may understand the relation the different events bore to each other. When Edward, at the beginning of his reign, returned to England with Gaveston, he dismissed the Earl of Pembroke from the government of Scotland, and appointed, in his stead, John de Bretagne, Earl of Richmond, nepheAv of the late King. A large army was collected, and orders Avere sent to the sheriffs of London to transport \" to Berwick the provisions, mili tary stores and arms requisite for the troops, Avith certain large crossbows., called balist\u00e6 de turno, em ployed in the attack and defence of fortified places.\"31 (A.D. 1307.) Events in Scotland at the be ginning of Edward's reign. The Earl of Richmond, at the head of this army, attacked Bruce and compelled him to retreat to the North of Scotland, Avhere, however, he does not ap pear to have been followed by the English. But some of the Scottish nobles, the chief among them being Bruce's mortal enemy John Comyn, Earl of Buchan, prepared to attack him. At this time Bruce Avas grievously ill, but he roused all his energies to meet Comyn, Avho had been joined by his own nepheAv Sir David de Brechin, and, although so Aveak as to be obliged to be supported on horseback by a squire on each side, he led on his men, and put his ene mies to flight.

Edwd. II. A.D.1314. Events in Scotland at the be ginning of Edward's reigu. Bruce had, by this time, reduced great part of the North of Scotland to submission, but the South still resisted his authority, and he therefore sent his brother Edward to bring it under subjection. By the middle of June (a.d. 1308) Sir Edward Bruce had expelled the English entirely from GalloAvay, and the gallantry of his exploits rivalled, if they did not equal, those of his brother. The victor}', by Avhich Bruce finally drove out the English, Avas gained over Sir John de St. John. The English were in number fifteen hundred, while Bruce's army Avas far inferior in force, but he supplied, by strata gem, Avhat he lacked in strength. Bruce found out, by his scouts, that the English intended to make a forced march, and take him by surprise. He accord ingly placed his foot soldiers in a narroAv valley, strongly fortified by nature, and early in the morn ing, under cover of a thick mist, he set forth at the head of fifty knights on horseback, and gained the rear of the English. His intention Avas, to allow the English to attack his foot soldiers, and, Avhile this was going on, to rush on them from behind and throw them into confusion.

Edwd. II. A.D.1314. Events in Scotland during the early part of Edward's reign. In the meantime Robert Bruce continued success ful in the North of Scotland ; while Edward's armies, although supported by a large party of Scotch mal contents, met only with reArerses. Bruce's early and stedfast friend, Sir James Douglas, reduced Selkirk and Jedburgh to obedience, and shortly afterwards joined his forces Avith those of Bruce. (A.D. 1308.) Bruce now felt himself strong enough to take revenge on the Lord of Lorn, a district of Argyleshire, who had pursued him so relentlessly and so nearly Avith success in the year before. He determined, ac cordingly, to invade his territories. To reach them, he had to pass through a narrow and rugged defile, called the Pass of Awe, bounded on one side by Loch Awe, and on the other by a steep mountain called Ben Crua chan. The Lord of Lorn, knoAving that Bruce's soldiers must pass through this defile, placed his men in am bush on the side of the mountain, ready to hurl down rocks and stones on them, as they passed beneath, and then, having thrown them into confusion, to rush down and ovenvhelm them. But Bruce heard of their plans, and, unknoAvn to the men of Lorn, placed some of his soldiers above them on the moun tain, under the command of Douglas. When Bruce entered the pass, the men of Lorn attacked him Avith great fury, but, as the attack was expected, Bruce's soldiers were able to resist it successfully. While"], [422, "374 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND. the fight Avas going on in the pass, Douglas and his men rushed down from the mountain heights, sur prised and defeated the foes in ambuscade, and then joined with Bruce in putting the men of Lorn to rout. Edwd. II. A.D.1314. Events in Scotland during the early part of Edward's reign. It Avas Avhilst Bruce was thus daily gaining more extensive SAvay in Scotland, that the King of Eng land Avas grieving over Gaveston's exile, plotting his return, and so misgoverning his own kingdom, that he was compelled to submit to the appointment of the \" Ordainers \" to reform abuses. The Scots, on the other hand, roused by Bruce's successes to a due appreciation of his claims on their obedience, now recognised him as their lawful King, at a general council of the prelates and clergy held at Dundee on the 24th February a.d. 1310. Bruce now laid siege to Perth, and at last Edward, glad to escape from the Ordainers, and hoping by victory to divert the minds of the barons from their projects of reform, roused himself to energetic action, and in September invaded Scotland in person. But, after all, he gained no success of any value, for Bruce, relying on the tactics Avhich had proved so success ful on former occasions, avoided any general battle, and retreated before the English, laying waste the country behind him as he Avent. Edward therefore could reach no enemy to conquer, could get no food for his soldiers, and was consequently obliged to Avith draw, baffled, to Berwick, where he spent the winter. (A.D. 1310.) Early in the following year, Edward Avas obliged to return to London to confirm the \" Ordinances,\" and he therefore sent Gaveston, who had come back from exile, to invade the eastern parts of Scotland. Bruce, despising the King, and his substitute, carried"], [423, "AA'AR AVITH SCOTLAND. 375 the Avar into England itself, thus becoming an in vader, instead of standing on the defensive. He ravaged the northern counties, Avith such fury, and carried off so much plunder, that the Lords Marchers of those counties Avere glad to purchase a truce. On his return to Scotland, from this successful foray, Bruce laid siege to Perth, which still remained in the hands of the English. It resisted his attacks for six weeks, but at last he took it by stratagem. Perth was fortified with a high Avail, defended at intervals by stone towers, and surrounded by a deep moat full of Avater. Bruce found out Avhere the water was shallowest, and then, striking his tents, marched off as if he had given up the siege. But, after eight days, he returned in the night, provided with scaling ladders, and reached the moat, undiscovered by the garrison. It was the depth of Avinter, but Bruce, carrying a ladder in his own hands, and fully armed, led his soldiers through the water, which reached up to his throat. He felt his way with his spear, Avaded safely through, and was the second man Avho fixed his ladder and mounted the Avail.

The inhabitants of Durham Avere glad to purchase a truce for themselves by the pay ment of 2,000/., equal to nearly 7,000/. of the money of our time, but Bruce made it a condition that, whenever he chose to invade England, he might take his troops through Durham Avithout opposition. The counties of Northumberland, Cumberland, and Westmoreland, each, Avillingly paid 2,000/.,* to be in cluded in the same truce. On his way back to Scot land, Bruce tried to take Berwick by surprise, but did not succeed. His friends had, hoAvever, some important successes, attended by romantic adventures.

The castle of Edinburgh was taken by a different stratagem. It is situated on the summit of a very high and steep rock, and was strongly fortified. The rock was so steep as to be almost inaccessible. Bruce's party had laid siege to this castle, without success, for six Aveeks, Avhen at last a soldier pointed out to them a part of the rock where, in his youth, he had climbed up and down, to visit a girl whom he loved.

The in vaders kept on, and at last clambered over the Avail. The garrison, however, was not taken by surprise so completely as that of Roxburgh, for the assailants were immediately seen, and the shout of treason roused them to arms. A desperate fight ensued, but at last the castle was taken. Edwd. II. A.D.1314. Events in Scotland during the early part of Edward's reign. The almost inaccessible castle of Stirling was nearly the last fortress of importance which still held out against the Scots, and Bruce's brother, Sir Edward Bruce, noAv laid siege to it. Its governor, Philip de Mowbray, was hard pressed, and feared his garrison Avould be starved out before it was possible to get help from England. He therefore concluded a truce Avith Sir EdAvard Bruce, on the condition of surrendering the castle by the 24th of June, the feast of St. John the Baptist, in the following year, if it were not pre viously relieved by an English army. Bruce justly blamed his brother for making so disadvantageous an agreement, but he did not attempt to break it. (A.D. 1313.) Siege of Stirling.

But, on learning De Mow bray's agreement about Stirling Castle, he made immense preparations for its relief. He summoned the Avhole military force of his kingdom to meet him at Berwick on the 11th June a.d. 1314. To this general muster ninety-three barons Avere commanded to repair Avith horse and arms, while the different (A.D.1314.)

EdAvard reappointed the Earl of Pembroke governor of Scotland, and sent him thither to prepare for his OAvn arrival. He directed letters to O'Connor, Prince of Connaught, and twenty-five other Irish native chiefs, in like manner, to attend Avith their vassals. A fleet of above fifty ships was appointed to coope rate Avith the army ; ample stores of provisions for the troops, and forage for the horses, were collected from all quarters ; smiths, carpenters, masons, and armourers joined the great array; and numerous wagons and carts, for the conveyance of the tents, pavilions, and baggage, formed a necessary part of the well-appointed army.

The ground, in this direction, lying between the Forth and the Bannockburn, Avas a level marsh, unfit for the passage of a large army, but practicable for a small body of troops. Bruce therefore, seeing that the English must ad vance by the Falkirk road, expected that they would cross the Bannock at a ford on the Kilsyth road, and consequently posted his army across it, on sloping ground to the north of the Halbert and Milton Marshes. The right of his army rested on a deep marshy hollow, lying on the west and north sides of the Coxe Hill, and through which ran a little stream. The left rested on the Bannock, at Milton Mill, where the river runs through the deep ravine already mentioned. In order, however, to strengthen his position still further, he caused a number of pits to be dug in the ground from the Halbert Marsh to the marshy hol low under Coxe Hill. In these pits sharp stakes were placed, and they Avere then covered over Avith turf. On the Coxe Hill, Bruce placed a body of men, to observe the movements of the enemy, and to resist any treacherous attack from Stirling Castle, the garrison of which was bound by the truce to take no part in the battle.

This was on Saturday the 22nd of June. On the following day, Sunday, the sol diers heard mass and confessed themselves Avith great solemnity.

He divided his soldiers into three masses, and a reserve. Sir Edward Bruce commanded the right division ; Sir James Douglas, and Walter, the Steward, the left ; Randolph the centre ; and Bruce himself took charge of the reserve, placing himself on a hill called the Caldon Hill. He fixed the staff of his standard into a massive stone in front of the reserve. This stone still remains in its original position. His order of battle. Bruce then sent out messengers to reconnoitre, and they soon returned saying, that the English army Avas advancing in great strength, and making a very Avarlike appearance.

Bruce had seemingly relied on the marshy nature of the ground, beyond the ravine through which the little ri\\'er flowed, as a sufficient protection to his army, and had made no preparation to resist this flank movement. In order therefore to gain the rear of the Scotch army, Edward, early in the morning, had sent forward a body of 800 horse, led by Sir Robert Clifford, to cross the Bannock and relieve the castle. Clifford succeeded in crossing the stream, his forces being concealed by a bank Avhich lies on the west side of the carse, or marshy plain, and was making his way to the castle, when Bruce discovered the movement of his troops, and despatched Randolph with a select body of foot soldiers to intercept them. So soon as Clif ford saw the approach of the Scotch, he ordered his soldiers to wheel round and charge. Randolph formed his men into a square, and received the shock of the English horse without Avavering, and at length, after desperate attempts on the part of the English, and determined resistance on the part of the Scots, the English Avere compelled to retreat.

But the Scotch were terribly galled by the showers of arrows poured upon them by the English bowmen. Bruce therefore ordered Sir Robert Keith to take a body of 500 horse, the only cavalry in the Scotch army, round Milton Marsh, and charge the English archers. The archers had no weapons but their bows and arrows, and their quivers being emptied, they were unable to resist the attack of the Scotch cavalrj--, and fled. Bruce noAV saw signs of Avavering among the English, and, bringing up his Avhole reserve, charged the English with his entire army in one line. At this critical moment, by Bruce's orders, the High landers made their appearance on the top of Gillies' Hill, and the English, supposing them to be a fresh army advancing to the attack, fled in confusion. This last charge of Bruce decided the fate of the day, and the Scots now obtained a complete victory over their opponents. Thirty thousand of the English are said to have been left dead on the field, but EdAvard escaped in safety, and took refuge in Berwick. It was still many years before the Avars between England and Scotland ceased, but the battle of Bannockburn had the effect of securely establishing Bruce and his successors as kings of Scotland.

Short Parliaments were frequently held, to consider Avhat steps should be taken to protect the North of England from the never-ending ravages of the Scots. But the weak character of the Kino-, and his continual quarrels Avith the barons, prevented anything effectual being done. These Par liaments, hoAvever, had to attend to home affairs of some importance. The seasons had been very un favourable to the groAvth of the crops, and the drain on the country for soldiers had much interfered with the proper cultivation of the soil. The result of these combined causes was a great scarcity of food, amount ing almost to famine. Distress in England from failure of crops.

Parliaments were now constantly held, to consider what should be done, to resist the ravaging Scotch men, and to raise supplies for carrying on the war. But the King's treachery hindered any united action. Complaints were constantly made that he did not observe the Ordinances, nor the Perambulations of the Forests, nor the Great Charter. In the Parliament held in January, a.d. 1315, six months after the battle of Bannockburn, one twentieth part of moveable goods had been granted to the King, but in Stafford shire and Shropshire the people had refused to pay these taxes, because of the King's want of faith.

He had had such success that he was soon crowned king of Ireland, but, needing more soldiers, his brother Robert went over to his assistance.

The dark shadow of coming events, fatal alike to the favourites and to their Royal tool, now became distinctly visible, and day by day crept slowly on. Philip the Long, Avho had succeeded his brother Louis the Tenth as King of France in a.d. 1316, had died on the 3rd of January, a.d. 1322, and Edward ought at once to have gone over to France to do homage to his brother and successor, Charles the Fair. He did not, however, do so, and Charles therefore sent ambassadors to remind him of his duty, and to summon him to appear.

They feared that, if the King were absent from England, the barons Avould rise against themselves.

The French King had built a castle on the English territory, and Ralph, Lord Basset, the King of England's seneschal of Bourdeaux, demolished it.30 The Earl of Kent proposed to give Basset up to the King of France, but EdAvard refused to submit to so disgraceful a humiliation, and the King of France therefore sent the Count de Valois to seize Aquitaine and Poitou. The enmity between the two Kings Avas now greatly increased, trade between their subjects was stopped, and EdAvard vented his spite against the King of France on his OAvn Queen, who was the King's sister. He knew that she hated the Despen sers, and looked to her brother as her protector against them, and even against himself. He dis missed all her French servants, seized her manors, and gave her only a small pension, irregularly paid, to live on. She was consequently advised to take the first opportunity of paying a visit to her brother the King of France, and her uncle the Count de Valois, to take their advice against the Despensers. She soon had the Avished-for opportunity.

The Earl conceived the idea of a marriage between the Prince and one of his daughters, and, by the advice of his brother John, agreed to support the Queen and the Prince by force of arms, on that con dition.

On the 22nd September, a.d. 1326, the Queen landed at Orwell, near Walton, in Suffolk, with less than 3000 men. It is remarkable that she ven tured to defy the power of the King and his favourites with so small a force ; but she was doubtless well informed as to the state of feeling in England, for her landing was unopposed, and no sooner was she on shore, than barons, bishops, and knights flocked to her support, some with money and some with soldiers, so that she was soon at the head of a consi derable army. So soon as the King had heard of the Queen's landing, he issued (on September 28th) a proclama tion calling on the people to come forward in his defence, promising payment to the soldiers, pardon for all past offences to the great men, and offering a large reward for Mortimer's head. The Queen, on her part, issued a counter-proclama tion, promising good government, and forbidding plundering and all outrages, but excepting the tAVO Despensers from the protection she offered to all others. But the day of reckoning had come at last ; the King's proclamation was only idle words, scattered by the wind. None responded to it.

NOTE TO PAGES 376, 387, & 406, AS TO PRICES.

The difficulty arises chiefly"], [467, "NOTE 417 from the circumstance that we have not a sufficient number of authentic facts for the purpose. We might adopt, as the basis of our calculations, the wages of an agricultural labourer at any particular period, and the articles he could buy with such wages. But in times so remote as the 13th century, we have very few statements as to the amount of wages, and we have even reason to believe that a farm-labourer then received some food or clothing in addition to his wages. Our calculation would, therefore, rest on an insufficient basis, but an attempt may be made to reason on such facts as we do possess. Thus we find that, in a.d. 1272, a labourer received \\^d. a-day,* or 9d. a- week. About that time, wheat varied from 20s. a quarter at Northampton, 17s. at Bedford, and 13s. Ad. at Dunstable in a.d. 1258, to 6s. 8d. in a.d. 1270, and 4s. Qd. in a.d. 1281. The average may be taken at 12s. a quarter, or Is. Qd. a bushel. A farm labourer, therefore, according to this calculation, could buy half a bushel of wheat with his week's wages. At the present time, we may fairly take the average wages of an agricultural labourer at 12s. a-week, and the price of wheat at 56s. a quarter, or 7s. a bushel. A labourer, therefore, could now buy more than a bushel and a half of wheat with his week's wages. It might from hence be inferred, that a labourer was threefold better off now than in the 13th century, but, as I have already stated, we are tolerably certain that he then received other kinds of payment in addition to his wages ; and it is necessary also to know what he had to pay for such things as he had to buy, but we have no facts of any value to guide us. We read of a fat ox being sold for 16s. in a.d. 1279, and a salmon for 5s. in winter, and 3s. in summer, but we do not know the weight of either one or the other, and so it is with other articles. A comparison of wages and prices at those remote times, affords us, therefore, very little help in arriving at a conclusion as to the comparison between the power of buying, and the quantity that could be bought for any given sum. The fact which it is desirable to ascertain, or the question to be answered, is, \u2014 What quan tities of like articles of necessity, luxury, and comfort can a man, at any particular period, obtain for a certain sum of money ; and what amount of labour is required to obtain that sum of money ? It is useless to know that a man can obtain a certain quantity of Avheat, clothing, fuel, or anything else, for a certain sum of money * Eden's \" State of the Poor,\" vol. iii. p. 10."], [468, "418 LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND. unless we also know what work he must do to get that sum of money, or what means a man has of paying such a sum of money ; and we have not sufficient facts to enable us to answer these questions. There is, however, another way of arriving approximately at the comparative value of any given sum, at two periods, which, indeed, is a necessary step in all calculations of this kind, but which alone gives us very little additional help. I refer to the quantity of fine gold or silver in any given coin at the two periods. This is an essential point, as it is obviously of no use knowing that wheat, for instance, was sold, at a certain time, at so many shillings a quarter, unless we also know whether, at that time, a shilling meant the same as a shilling now. The pound troy weight, or 12 oz. of the metal of which English silver coins are made, contains 11 oz. 2 dwts. of pure silver, and 18 dwts. alloy. In the eighth year of the reign of Edward I. (a.d. 1280), this pound-weight of silver was coined into twenty shillings. In a.d. 1816, and at present, the like quantity was coined into sixty six shillings. The shilling of a.d. 1280 was, therefore, equal to about 3s. 3^rf. (say 3s. 3d.) of the present coin : that is to say, the shilling of the present day is worth less than one- third of the shilling of the time of Edward I., and, on this basis, if we wish to convert the money of the 13th century into the money of the present day, we must multiply it by three and a quarter. This is the calculation I have adopted in my present lecture, as it seems to me to be the only one based on any actual fact. But it is ob vious from what I have stated, that this calculation gives us no measure of the value of any article of produce, as compared with the power of purchasing it ; and the conflicting opinions of different political economists, as to the multiplier to be made use of, convince me that at present we have not sufficient means for ascertaining the relation borne in the 13th century by a payment to the means of meeting it. We cannot say that, as compared with the present time, taxation was heavy or light, wages were high or low, oxen, sheep, or poultry were cheap or dear ; all we can do is, to convert shillings of the thirteenth century into shillings of the nineteenth, and then compare the relation which the prices of various articles at any particular period bore to each other at that period, and to the prices of a list of articles, of apparent similarity, at the present period. It may perhaps, however, be allowable to say that, as a result of the inquiries which have been made, and the opinions which have"], [469, "419 NOTE. been given by various persons, on this subject, the multiplier which will, with approximate correctness, convert the money of Edward I. into a purchasing power of equal force at the present time, would be somewhere between 12 and 20. Thus, for example, 1001. of money in the time of Edward I. would, all things considered, go as far in purchases of all kinds as 1,200Z. or 2,0O0Z. at present."], [470, ""], [471, "NOTES.

THE CHOKLEYWOOD ASSOCIATION for promoting provident and industrious habits among the labouring classes was established in 1855. The original object was only to provide allotment gardens for the labourers, but it was .thought desirable to make this begin ning, a foundation for other objects. An Association was there fore formed, of which, those who had allotment gardens be came members ; and those who subscribed to the Association also became members. It was thought that by thus binding the various classes together, union and good feeling would be promoted, and that a machinery for carrying out other bbjects would also be ready ; and so it has proved. The next step was the giving of Prizes for the best-grown vegetables and the best-cultivated gardens. It was then thought that it would promote good feeling and mutual confidence if all the members of the Association, both gentry and labourers, met together once a year at supper, after the distribution of prizes for the gardens. Labourers' wives were admitted, as it was thought unfair that they should be left out. This experi ment succeeded very well."], [513, "LECTUEES ON THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND BY \"WILLIAM LONGMAN LECTURE FIFTH COMPRISING THE BEIGET OF EDWAED THE SECOND (A.D. 1307 TO A.D. 1327) Delivered in an abridged form at Chorleywood, at Christmas 1862 Mourners watching the Bier of Philip IV.
