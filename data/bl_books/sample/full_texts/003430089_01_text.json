Dogberry \" Truly, for mine own part, if I were as tedious as a king, I could find in my heart to bestow it all of your worship.\" \u2014 Much Ado about Nothing. ON the 10th of October, 1843, I left London for a tour on the Continent with a small family party. We went at first to Brighton, intending to cross over to Dieppe, but owing to the boisterous weather we were obliged to retrace our steps, and go to Folkestone : whence, after some little delay, owing to the state of the weather, we crossed the Channel to Boulogne, and proceeded, by Rouen, to Paris, where we arrived on the 16th. On the 25th, we went by Fon tainebleau and Auxerre to Chalons sur Saone, and thence, down the Saone, to Lyons, and down the Rhone, to Avignon, and Nismes. Thence we went"], [18, "4 INTRODUCTION TO PART I. to Nice and Genoa ; and thence, by Spezzia, Carrara, Lucca, and Pisa, to Florence; where we arrived on the 18th of November. We remained in Florence until the 29th of January ; and then proceeded to Siena, and so to Rome. From Rome, after the Car nival, on the 22nd of February, we went on to Naples ; whence, on the 6th of April, I embarked for Palermo, and made the tour of Sicily ; returning to Naples on the 7th of May. On the 19th, we left Naples, by sea, for Leghorn ; whence we revisited Pisa, and Florence, where we arrived on the 22nd. From Florence I made an excursion to the convents of Vallombrosa, Camaldoli, and Laverna; and on the 17th of June, we left Florence for Bologna, Padua, and Venice, where we arrived on the 27th. From Venice we went by Padua, Verona, and Brescia, to Milan, where we arrived on the 5th of July. We left Milan on the 10th, and having crossed the Alps by the Simplon pass, we arrived at Martigny on the 13th ; and after visiting the great St. Bernard, and making some little stay at Chamonix, we arrived at Geneva on the 27th. On the 30th, I returned to Chamonix ; and on the 5th of August, passed, by the Col du Geant, to Cour mayeur, and returned to Geneva on the 9th. On the 15th, we left Geneva for Paris, where we arrived on the 19th. On the 5th of September, we left Paris; and on the 7th, arrived in London."], [19, "5 INTRODUCTION TO PART I. During this period of eleven months we kept a very regular journtil in humble prose of all that occurred ; but in these days of uneventful and easy locomotion, thrilling adventures, and hair-breadth-'scapes, are quite out of date. Hence, however, a state of things ensues by no means unfavourable to mental sketching ; and, if the tourist be so disposed, he has ample oppor tunities of directing his attention to the poetical imagery that unceasingly presents itself, as he moves from place to place. Accordingly, side by side with the original journal, another one, in metre, grew up ; and it makes its appearance in its present dress with some extracts from its more methodical companion incorporated with it. It is manifest, in justice to the interesting route that was taken, that much more might have been done ; that many opportunities have been let slip ; that many chasms might have been filled up. But whoever has undertaken to keep a journal of a tour, must have become aware of the amount of resolution required to preserve the con tinuity of even the most matter-of-fact register ; and with respect to the following trifles, the author merely hopes that they may appear to wind amidst the inter ruptions which they could not but experience, with their thread, like that of a running brook, now in sight, and now hidden, but in reality always free and unbroken."], [20, "6 INTRODUCTION TO PART I. New realms their theme, new cities, manners, men, Like self-sown plants my random sketches grew Now 'tis a joy these trifles of my pen, Dear fellow-travellers, to collect for you.

On either side the ploughshare had wrought out Deformed uncleanly furrows, timidly Encroaching on the waste : low grey stone walls Offered a scant protection : here and there Short stunted oak and hazel, thorn and briar, Struggled with skeleton fragments of the rock, Denuded, worn, storm-eaten : ou the right, .Against the sky-line loomed a single tower, Whereon a melancholy telegraph Was set to wave its arms aloft in air,"], [25, "11 PROSE AND VERSE.

The impressions as to general effect which that city con veys are of a singularly novel and forcible character- Genoa has in profusion its marble palaces, whose walls are arrayed in all their ancient solid and costly magni ficence ; but I would chiefly dwell upon the perpetual intervention of variously coloured architectural views, painted in close juxtaposition with, and even upon, these same marble walls: so that you may really pause in the streets, and imagine you are gazing at the scenery of a theatre : yet from the effects of pro portion, aided by the rich tone of the climate, there results truth and harmony from that which, elsewhere, would only suggest the idea of a ludicrous attempt at deception. The streets are narrow and sombre, but they are not gloomy ; and you may see overhead a strip of blue sky broken by the palace cornices ; whilst"], [36, "22 MEMORIALS IN in the side lanes the sunshine streams from above, as through an absolute slit. But when the sky is over cast, the want of illumination destroys all the singu larity and beauty of these effects. The prevailing idea is still that of the scenery of a theatre; but of a theatre as seen by an insufficient light. Again, the dimensions of the great hall of the ducal palace are truly noble ; but for the most part the or naments which it contains are the veriest trash imagi nable. The statues in the niches (if they deserve the name of statues) are merely counterfeits, made up of plaster, rags, and paper ; but it is quite surprising how fine is the effect thus demonstrated to be attainable by the force of proportion and colouring alone.

PISA'S four curiosities, the leaning tower, the ca- thedral, the Baptistery, and the Campo Santo, stand together on a smooth level grassy space, tranquil and appropriate, with the effect ofthe precincts of some of our cathedral closes. The tower leans more than we had expected. It stands well away from other build ings, but near enough to the cathedral to group finely with it. The tint which these marble edifices have ac quired is most lovely ; golden as the sun itself ; so dif ferent from the tint of the lichens and weather-stains of a more northern climate ; and the variations of the shadowy effect of their open pillar-work at all hours of the day relieve the dreariness of unmitigated sunshine.

Though some of the architectural details of the in terior of the cathedral are open to criticism, yet the effect is very impressive ; and the building contains a profusion of works of art of the highest merit. In the Campo Santo we directed our attention solely to the frescos. Never before was I made acquainted with wonders that conveyed to the mind such elevated ideas of the art of painting. Perhaps the story of Abraham, by Benozzo Gozzoli, is as finely told as any. The countenance of the Patriarch, after receiving the divine command to sacrifice his son, is fraught with an expression of obedience, with something of a dignified surprise at the importance ofthe message, thus almost carrying out Abraham's character as a Prophet. Equal ly admirable is the fresco ofthe cultivation of the vine, and the drunkenness of Noah. In the fresco of the last Judgment by Orgagna there is marvellous power and dignity ; and the division of the Inferno into several distinct and separate chambers of horror, resembles the awful reiteration which we find in scripture of the words \" where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.\" Part of another fresco entitled \" the"], [44, "30 .MEMORIALS IN Triumph of Death,\" also by Orgagna, is a perfect illus tration of the following lines in one of Wordsworth's finest sonnets \u2014 \" Methought I saw the footsteps of a throne ' Which mists and vapours from mine eyes did shroud \u2014 Nor view of whom did sit thereon allowed ; But all the steps and ground about were strown With sights the ruefullest that flesh and bone Ever put on ; a miserable crowd, Sick, hale, old, young, who cried before that cloud, ' Thou art our King, O Death, to thee we groan !

In the church is the celebrated crucifix painted by Giotto ; and in the Chapter Hall, the cloisters of the Convent, and the corridors upstairs adjoining the dormitories, are many exquisite and unique specimens in fresco of the paint ings of the Fra Beato Angelico da Fiesoli, a brother of the order, born in 1387, died in 1455. Nothing can equal the peculiar calm sublimity of the works of this heavenly minded artist, perhaps the most interesting of all the great Fathers of painting. I would particu larly instance the large fresco of the Crucifixion ; that of the Annunciation of the Virgin ; that of the Virgin and Child attended by Saints ; that of the Coronation of the Virgin ; and that of Christ visiting the spirits in prison. In the convent I paid a visit to Fra Serafino, one of the brethren. He received me with great civi- D"], [48, "34 MEMORIALS IN lity, and showed me his own paintings ; and, in truth, he is no mean artist. He also showed me, adjoining his own, the cell that was occupied by the ill-fated Savonarola. In his own cell he had several singing birds in cages, and others hopping about the room quite tame. On one of the walls, in a bad light, and in a state which shows it has recently suffered by ex ternal violence, is a fresco of the Virgin and Child by the grand old painter Fra Bartolommeo, who also was a brother of the order about the year 1480. The design of this fresco is very grand. The child is of almost gigantic proportions, such as we can conceive that a Heathen artist would have adopted in order to express his idea of an infant Hercules or Jupiter. The Christian artist seems to have aimed at the em bodying of a prophecy ; at the representation of a child that should grow to all that was noble and princely : born to us in order to take the government upon his shoulder. Fra Serafino is in the prime of life ; intelligent, and apparently happy in his profession of holiness, and in his own quiet pursuits. I met upon the stairs another of the Brethren, who was very old and asthmatic ; and as he stopped for breath upon the landing place, I saw him turn to the wall, unobserved as he thought, and kiss a small picture of the Virgin with the sincerest"], [49, "PROSE AND VERSE. 35 and most touching air of devotion : then, as I passed him, he saluted me in the most paternal and affection ate manner.

As he approached, he took no notice whatever of me ; but I could see that his eye was fixed intently upon some object near me, which I could not make out; but in a few moments, with a key which he held under his gown, I saw him make a dart at the key-hole of the door of his cell, close by me, which he entered, and locked himself in. \" Ha mezza mente, Signore ! \" said my attendant to me \u2014 \" povero Padre Leone ! \" \" Mary Mother, Shield and sain the Idiot Brother ! \" Florence, January, 1844."], [50, "36 MEMORIALS IN sr SONNET ON THE DEVOTIONAL PAINTINGS OF THE EARLY ITALIAN MASTERS.

A T about four o'clock in the afternoon, (Friday, * **- April 26) mounted on mules and horses, we left Catania for Nicolosi, for the purpose of taking guides from that place for the ascent of Etna. Our party at starting consisted of Mr. T , Mr. S , myself, two muleteers, and a boy : we were afterwards joined by Mr. K , and his muleteer, also mounted. Here Mr. T 's mule made a most vicious attack with teeth and heels on the mule of Mr. K\u2014 \u2014 ; bites and kicks were exchanged unpleasant even to witness ; however, the animals were quieted without accident. In less than three hours we reached Nicolosi, a village said to be more than 2000 feet above Catania, and ten miles distant. Here we remained until about half-past eight o'clock ; when we sallied forth to continue our journey up the"], [98, "84 MEMORIALS IN mountain ; our party being augmented in number by two guides, also mounted. We set off in spirits ; for the night was most beautiful : clear, warm, and quite calm, with a fine moon about a week old ; by the light of which we could see the distant summit of the moun tain quite distinctly, with the smoke issuing from the crater now and then tinged with flame. Leaving the Monte Rosso on the left, we proceeded up a tedious road consisting of ashes, scori\u00e6, and rough hard lava; whilst the muleteers occasionally awakened the echoes of the Etnean solitudes with their wild chants. It was not very long before we came to the woody region of the mountain; and at about eleven o'clock we arrived at a hut in the upper part of it, called the Casa del Bosco. By this time we all began to feel the cold of the night very sharply ; and I do not think I shall ever forget the genuine de- light with which we saw a bright fire, which the guides made for us in the centre of the lava-built casa, blazing up to the very roof. Fuel there was here in plenty : the floor, however, was earth ; and the only furni- ture some of the stones of Etna ; stretched on which, after getting thoroughly warm, I had half an hour's sound sleep. The warmth here was of the greatest service to us, and lasted us through the remainder of the night."], [99, "PROSE AND VERSE. 85 At about midnight we left the Casa del Bosco, still on our mules ; and proceeded upwards and upwards, always by a similar kind of path. Not long after we left the Casa del Bosco, the moon began to fail us ; and we had to pass under a wall or low cliff of lava, the shadow of which kept the path in darkness, whilst the moon shone obliquely in our faces. Just here we came to a part of the road difficult to pass ; and the rider preceding me stopped, and said he could neither see the way nor go on. He, however, soon managed to surmount the obstacle ; which was a steep broken step (as it were) in the lava rock. I then took my turn. My horse, after getting his fore-feet on the impediment, seemed to make no further effort ; but let himself slip backwards on his haunches against the mule behind me, who, in his turn, recoiled against the next, and a serious accident appeared inevitable. I dismounted, and the muleteers came to my assistance, and after some dangerous flounderings and plunges on the sharp lava, my poor steed lay quite still with his hind legs tucked close under him, evident!}' in the greatest terror. I walked a little further up the ascent ; and they got him up, and brought him to me, and I re mounted, and we proceeded as before. The road con tinued more or less beset with similar obstacles ; and the moon soon afterwards went down ; but the night was"], [100, "86 sMEsMORIALS IN so fine and calm, and the stars so brilliant, that we did very well as to light. However, as we were once more stopped by some impediment similar to the last, T s mule again took the opportunity of flying at one of the others, and a regular combat took place between the animals, in the dark, to the imminent peril of the riders. I heard some sound kicks given and received ; and saw indistinctly T 's vicious brute twisting violently round and round on his hind legs ; close to the edge of a black precipice, which in the obscurity looked bottomless. It was really a frightful sight. But these things occur so suddenly, and are, one way or another, terminated so quickly, that, at the time, you think little or nothing of them. Most happily, no harm ensued, and we all continued our route as before. Soon after this, we reached the snow, which lay in wide patches in the hollows of the lava and ashes. We crossed several of these patches without accident ; but on one of them the mule of the foremost of my companions fell, with his leg through the snow ; and my horse slipped down, close to the sharp edge ofthe lava. I dismounted immediately, and was quite as tonished to find what a slippery state the snow was in. How the animals managed to walk or stand upon it I know not. Not being aware of this, on alighting, I fell"], [101, "87 PROSE AND VERSE. down immediately ; and on attempting to recover my legs, slid rapidly backwards until I was brought up (in nautical phrase) by coming in contact with some one of the party behind. However, we all crossed without injury, and remounted ; and continued our progress upwards. At last we came to a place differing little in appear ance from others that we had passed ; where, however, the guides decided that we must leave the mules and horses. Accordingly we resigned them to the charge of the muleteers, who returned with them to the Casa del Bosco, there to wait for us on our descent. The guides furnished us with sharp pointed sticks ; and we set forwards on foot. Our way lay over an apparently interminable succession of slopes of frozen snow ; rug ged, and excessively slippery; and I believe we all found them painfully toilsome to ascend. For my own part, I often fell, and slid back several yards, and had all the work to do over again ; so that in a short time I began to feel so much fatigued that I was several times compelled to stop and lie down on the snow : and in this way I proceeded until we reached the Casa Inglese. The Casa Inglese is a small hut, nearly 10,000 feet above the sea, erected for the accommoda tion of persons ascending Etna ; but it was impossible to enter it, as the snow was still as high as the eaves"], [102, "88 MEMORIALS IN of the building. It is usual in making the ascent later in the year, to ride thus far, which renders the excur sion much less fatiguing. Beyond the Casa Inglese, though the dark mass of the cone lay right before me, and apparently quite near, yet the slopes of snow continued to rise up, one after another as if by magic. Again and again, as we attained for a few minutes the luxury of some rough ashes to walk upon, did I inquire of my guide, whether there was any more snow ? and again and again did he reply, \" Si, Signor, c'e un altro poco piii avanti\" \u2014 until I fairly thought myself and the mountain bewitched. We had now attained an altitude approaching 10,000 feet above Catania, and I began to experience the effect of the rarefaction of the air. I felt no distressing symptoms whatever in the chest; but a violent throb bing in the head came on, yet without pain. As soon as I ceased walking, it became, as it were, distinctly audible, like a loud and regular hammering at ten or twelve yards distance ; but after I had rested a few seconds, it entirely subsided. And in this way I pro ceeded slowly, until the snow was indeed all past, and the base of the cone, on which snow did not lie, was fairly attained. My companions, who had started from the place where we had left our mules, at a pace which I could"], [103, "PROSE AND VERSE. 89 not keep up with, had by this time left me considerably behind ; but not so far as to prevent the two guides, one of whom remained with me, from calling to one another. My guide was here hailed by the foremost, to say that one of my companions was tired, and had sat down to wait for us to come up with him. How ever, after waiting a little while, as I afterwards learnt, he went on ; and we did not rejoin him until we reached the summit. We now began to ascend the cone by a circuitous route, over hard and very steep volcanic rock covered with loose stones of all sizes. Here I got many falls, and once slid several yards down the side of the moun tain, but recovered myself without injury. On com paring notes afterwards, I found that my companions, who were ahead of me, had all had falls about this part of the ascent. The day now began to break ; and, among other remarkable volcanic features, we distinguished, far beneath us, the stream of lava which broke out in the lower part of the mountain, and so nearly overwhelmed the town of Bronte, last Decem ber. Soon afterwards, at twenty minutes before five o'clock, I found, to my infinite satisfaction, that I had attained the edge of the crater ; along which, but still with a considerable ascent, amidst thick dri^ng sul phureous vapours, we continued to walk, to the highest"], [104, "90 MEMORIALS IN point of the mountain. Here I rejoined my compa nions, two of whom, with their guide, were settling themselves to sleep in the warm ashes. I walked on, along a narrow ledge, composed of very frail materials, to the furthest accessible point ; where, before me, I saw the disk of the rising sun, and beneath, Taormina, Messina, with the volcanic islands, and among them, Stromboli, in the distance; together with the whole line of coast, and the expanse of sea : whilst close on my right, enormous volumes of smoke, now illuminated with splendid sun-light effects, and now tinged with the fires of the crater beneath, rolled furiously away to the leeward : whilst on the left I saw another part of the crater irregularly divided into fearful valleys and hol lows, issuing from which I heard continued explosions as of artillery ; each explosion being succeeded by the harsh clatter of the fragments that had been hurled up wards, as they fell back upon the rocks. Even when on the spot, it is not an easy matter to obtain a distinct idea of the summit of Etna. The smoke and vapours shut out a great part of the view, and the faculties are bewildered with witnessing violence and confusion not usually connected with the operations of Nature. The real character of the weather was perfectly calm and serene ; but even under the most favourable circum- stances in this region of terror every thing partakes of the character of furnace and storm ; and at this eleva-"], [105, "PROSE AND VERSE. 91 tion, aided, in all probability, by the operation of the volcano itself, the air drew away pretty strongly from the north, with a piercing effect of cold that was hardly to be resisted. We stood on a frail narrow ledge ; and three several times we felt shocks of earthquake. The prevailing idea upon the summit of Etna is, \" How dreadful is this place I\" We soon all reassembled, and got together out of the wind just below the edge of the outer slope of the cone, supporting ourselves by thrusting our heels into the loose ashes, the warmth of which we found inex pressibly grateful. I have already described the sensations I experienced during the ascent. Another of the party suffered greatly with pain in the chest : and another, when on the summit, vomited ; but he would not allow that it was owing to any thing but to the stench of the sul phureous vapours. At Catania, I had protested against making the ascent at night ; but I was outvoted ; and I now think that, on the whole, for local and other reasons, we did right to ascend at night. Besides, we had observed that at about ten in the forenoon, a cloud generally settled for the day on the summit ; making it advisable to reach it very early in the morning. However, the day we fixed upon for our expedition was fine through out ; but not so the day before, nor the day after."], [106, "92 MEMORIALS IN As I had anticipated, notwithstanding the fineness of the weather, the sight of the sunrise, like all sun rises seen from mountain tops, proved a failure. I had heard much of the general magnificence of the spectacle, as well as of the extraordinary effect of the projection of the dark shadow of the cone of the mountain over the face of the country ; but I saw nothing connected with these particulars the least worthy of remark. During the ascent, however, in the night, the circumstances attending the view of the sidereal heavens far exceeded my expectations. The splendour of the constellations outshone any thing of the kind I had ever before witnessed, or even imagined. The Milky Way lost its uncertain nebulous character, and put on the appearance of luminous, well-defined cloud; and I do not assert it as a fact, but I verily believe that by its light, and the general light of the stars, I saw my own shadow on the snow. It was in deed a glorious spectacle I As Etna has no lofty mountains near it, the stellar horizon had the appear ance of being far below us : we had in fact more than an entire hemisphere to gaze upon : and I saw some fine stars rise from, and others set within, the black abyss beneath us. The rising of the planet Jupiter early in the morning, was in this respect a very beautiful phenomenon. I saw also in the course of the night two faint flashes of lightning in the cloud-"], [107, "93 PROSE AND VERSE. less darkness beneath us ; and, in the sky above, two, and only two, excessively faint meteors. The morning twilight appeared of very brief duration. On the summit we found the sulphureous vapours very overpowering; and after remaining there about an hour, we began the descent of the mountain, not the way by which we had ascended, but directly down the sheer declivity which lay beneath our feet, where we had all been reposing. From its extreme steepness it at first appeared impracticable ; but one of the guides led the way quickly and decidedly ; and we soon found it afforded a very rapid and comparatively easy path ; for it consisted for the most part of fine ashes, into which we sank more than ankle deep at every step, without the possibility of slipping : but now and then the ashes ended abruptly, giving place to a steep face of hard sulphureous rock, covered with loose stones ; and wherever this occurred, you were pretty sure, without care, to get a smart fall. This path soon brought us to the slopes of frozen snow, which, in the ascent, I had found so formidable ; and to my great surprise, I descended them without difficulty, and kept well up with my companions. We now diverged to the left in order to obtain a view of the famous Val del Bove ; an enormous deso late valley or ravine, high up in the mountain, pre senting every variety of the most awful volcanic"], [108, "94 MEMORIALS IsV scenery. It is much the finest thing in the whole region of Etna. Although no colouring could have been anticipated in such a scene, yet the varieties of black were quite astonishing. Effects too of light and shade abounded; and the transparent air, and the bright morning sun, cast a velvet -like softness of tint over the lava streams, with now and then a tinge of the most delicate purple imaginable, \" - - - Smoothing the raven down Of darkness till it smiled. We were in truth most fortunate in obtaining so perfect and enjoyable a view of this tremendous valley; often for months together the abode of aerial clouds and tempests, even when unvexed by volcanic storm. We continued our route down the patches of snow, until we once more entered upon the woody region ; and at about nine o'clock, regained the Casa del Bosco, where we found our muleteers fast asleep in the sun. After a short delay, we remounted, and as we had had a fatiguing walk of about eight hours, we were not sorry to ride down the remainder of the mountain. Here I was much pleased at hearing the cuckoo : it was the first I had heard this year; and the first I recollect to have ever heard out of England. We had now a better opportunity of observing the woody region than when we passed it in the night."], [109, "95 PROSE AND VERSE. I confess I was disappointed in the beauty of it ; at least, of that part of it which we crossed. There were some terrific cascades of lava that had desolated many localities of the region, within sight. From hence we enjoyed an excellent view of the very numerous minor volcanos that have at various times broken out in the lower regions of the mountain. They are all now extinct, but they have generally proved very de structive. Some of them, the Monte Rosso, for in stance, are hills of considerable elevation. We also saw the celebrated Grotto del Capre, which we had passed in the night. It is an insignificant cave near the Casa del Bosco, and was once the only refuge for travellers ascending the mountain. Many names of travellers are carved on the trees which surround it. I was disappointed to find that the chestnut tree called from its great size \" de' cento cavalli,\" did not lie in this part of Etna. It must be visited in a distinct excursion from Nicolosi. Passing from the woody region through the desola tion of lavas of various dates, and over a long tract of the black pulverized ashes of the Monte Rosso, we at length reached Nicolosi. Here we dismissed our guides, and obtained some refreshment, and remained about two hours, and then remounted in order to ride quietly back to Catania. But our scrambles were not"], [110, "96 MEMORIALS IN yet over. Just as we were leaving the place, the vicious mule managed once more to fly like a tiger at one of the others ; a fresh kicking and plunging en sued, which broke T 's girths, and he fell on his back on the sharp stones of the steep paved village street which we were descending. Most fortunately he was not hurt. He remounted, and we continued our ride to Catania, where we arrived between three and four o'clock, having been absent about twenty three hours ; and, considering the season of the year, we could not but be satisfied with the success of our ascent of Mount Etna. In the evening we had the honour of a visit from Professor Forbes, of Edinburgh. He had just arrived at Catania, and wished to make some enquiries of us concerning our expedition. In the course of conver sation, I mentioned to him the symptoms which I had experienced when near the summit of the mountain ; and he told me that he had often ascended to great heights, and that he had occasionally, but not in variably, felt similar symptoms.* The next morning I perceived that a steel key which I wore at my watch chain, and the steel pipe of my watch key, had become corroded, and turned nearly * See Ascent of the Col du GSant, in this volume."], [111, "97 PROSE AND VERSE. black. This was evidently owing to my having re clined upon, and having thus brought them into con tact with, the sulphureous ashes on the summit. In the Cabinet Encyclop\u00e6dia, in the volume on Astronomy, by Sir John Herschel, is the following note. \" The height of Etna above the Mediterranean (as it results from a barometrical measurement of my own made in July, 1824, under very favourable circum stances) is 10872 English feet.\" The distance from Catania to the summit of Etna is called thirty-six miles. This must surely be an exaggeration. Agreeably to this reckoning, we should have performed, in going and returning, twice thirty six, or seventy-two miles, in about twenty hours : making our average progress, whilst actually on our road, something greater than three miles and a half an hour ; which, although we descended rapidly, is too much. The fact is, guides are in the habit of calling an hour spent on a mountain excursion, a league ; which exactly accounts for the estimated distance. Catania, April, 1844.

THE day after leaving Catania we spent a delight- ful morning in the contemplation of the antiqui ties and wonderful scenery of Taormina, and thence came on to Messina. I do not like to quit Sicily with out a word respecting Scylla and Charybdis. I have been twice at Messina, which is in their immediate neighbourhood, but on neither occasion have I been able to explore them carefully, though I have been on sailing excursions about the strait in a small boat, and have twice passed through it in a steam vessel. Scylla is a castle-crowned rock, and of course, per fectly well identified. The whole locality is extremely picturesque. Respecting Charybdis some uncertainty exists. Some say it is the eddy called the Garofalo off Messina lighthouse ; others, that it is the strong eddy off the Faro of Messina, nearly opposite Scylla, ten miles off. But the entire strait is full of eddies, and this makes its navigation at all times somewhat preca rious. During our stay at Messina my companions"], [116, "102 MEMORIALS IN sailed over to Scylla, but it blew so hard that they could not attempt to land. One of them told me on his return that he had heard the breakers make an unusually loud noise against the rocks. He therefore, as well as Ulysses, must be admitted to have heard the barking of Scylla's enchanted dogs. But similar sounds are to be heard on every bold coast in bad weather. It is most likely that the terrors of Scylla and Charybdis are as great now as ever they were ; nor do the fabulous exaggerations of Homer and Vir gil show any thing to the contrary. Owing probably to the pious awe with which their religious feelings in vested every natural object, the ancient poets differ in this from the moderns, that they have left us scarcely any descriptions of natural scenery, divested of fable, and treated subjectively, in the spirit of modern idyls, in which the supposition is, that the poet is on the spot, and speaking in his own person. But the ancients are rich in epic and dramatic narration, put into the mouth of persons supposed to be at a distance from the place of which they are speaking ; and in such narrations, descriptions may be introduced so as to be unexcep tionable, although they may not convey correct ideas of the localities to which they refer. In our own lan guage we have a strong instance of this. Shakspeare's well-known description of Dover cliff neither conveys"], [117, "PROSE AND VERSE. 103 an accurate notion of that cliff in particular, nor, as indeed Johnson's note on the passage points out, of the impressions naturally made on the mind of a per- son standing on the brink of a terrific height. But it is further to be observed, that the passage is not put into the mouth of a person on the spot, but of one who is essaying to make another, who is blind, believe that they are standing together on the summit of the cliff, when in reality they are at a distance from it. The description has therefore a dramatic propriety and a naturalness of its own, the sustaining of which, in its place in the drama, is of far more importance than the dressing it up as a recognisable picture of a given locality. Dover cliff, it must be confessed, has little enough to do with Scylla and Charybdis ; but it would be as unreasonable to argue from Shakspeare that Dover cliff has altered, as to argue from Homer that Scylla and Charybdis have altered. Before we criti- cise a description, we ought to understand what the writer wished to delineate. A scene truthfully por- trayed, in prose or in metre, has its merits ; but the interests of a higher order of truth are consulted, when the features of the external world are made subservi ent to delineation of character.

We soon commenced a long ascent, after surmounting which we arrived at La Verna, in something less than five hours from Camaldoli. La Verna is, in fact, a Hospice, on the summit of a pass leading from Bibiena, Chitignano, andPieve San Stefano, directly over the Apennines.

Of O'Con nell he said \u2014 \" E un uomo di ferro !\" After some refreshment, we walked out, and met in the corridor a country lad who had been severely bitten in the leg by an adder, and had come to the Convent for relief. The good brother in the spezeria who acted as leech, examined the wound, but appeared sorely puzzled, and inquired of us if we were \" medici ?\" We then visited the various shrines and spots of peculiar sanctity in the immediate neighbourhood of the Convent.

Accordingly, on the 30th of July I signified my wishes to the Chef des guides at Chamonix, who readily appointed three guides to accompany me, and we had hopes of being able to start that same afternoon.

My guides, and their qualifications, were as follows : Alexandre Devouassoud (twice up Mont Blanc, five times to the Col du Geant.) Michel Coutet (never up Mont Blanc, twice to the Col du Geant.) David Simon (three times up Mont Blanc, never to the Col du Geant.) Jean Edward Devouassoud (once up Mont Blanc, never to the Col du Geant.)

The planet Jupiter was shining magnificently over the"], [143, "129 PROSE AND VERSE. Grandes Jorasses, and the moon, three weeks old, was just rising over the Aiguille du Dru. I had felt a little uneasy during the night owing to hearing some strong gusts of wind ; but they had now quite died away ; and the silence was unbroken, save by the steady roar of the many small torrents falling from the opposite rocks, and lesser glaciers, into the Mer de Glace. It was not in the least cold. By a quarter after two we were on foot ; and after half an hour's walk by moonlight, we came to the precipitous face of rock called Les Ponts, a point which we passed without difficulty, after which we were soon fairly launched upon the Mer de Glace. We took the route leading to the Jardin, as far as the moraines at the foot of the Couvercle, and then coasted along them as far as the Tacul, where we ar rived at half past four. The sky now appeared of the most exquisite rose colour over the Couvercle, and of a fine yellow over the Aiguilles Rouges, behind the Flegere. Once, before it was light, during our progress, one of the guides cut a step or two for us in the ice with the axe which he carried for that purpose, and it was curious to see it strike fire on the gritty surface. At the foot of the Tacul I had some spiked nails screwed into the soles of my shoes. Whilst this was doing, I gazed with renewed * won- * I had had nearly the same view before, when I visited the Jardin.

The sun was now shining brilliantly on the highest peaks ; there was no vapour or cloud visible ; nor was there any wind, save a moderate breeze. Nothing could be more wonderful than the conviction that there were many hours of uncertain labour before us in the passage of the glacier, which from hence, in the clear morning air, appeared so little formidable. The wea ther was so fine that the eye was deceived as to height and distance even more than usual. At about half past five, on a steep slope of snow considerably above us, under the Aiguille du Grepon, I saw, to my great delight, a troop of about fifteen chamois. They were not tumbling down precipices upon their heads, nor exhibiting themselves in any of the conventional attitudes in which they are repre sented in the picture shops ; but were filing gently a cross the snow, one after another, just as you see deer in a park ; nor did they appear to take any notice of us. Hereabouts we came to some ugly crevasses in the glacier, with snow bridges over them, which had a trea cherous look, owing to the new-fallen snow of Friday last, which still lay thickly on this part of the glacier. In fact, we were now beginning to attain a conside-"], [145, "PROSE -\\ND VERSE. 131 rable height. Next, we came to several crevasses in succession, extending, to all appearance, right across the glacier; these in many places were of great width; but we found narrow places in all of them, so that we passed them with ease. By six o'clock we had ascended the glacier to about the level of the Jardin* (or per haps not quite so high) which we now saw, at a distance, in its solitude, insulated in the upper part of the glacier du Talefre. Soon afterwards, we got into the heart of the glacier du Tacul, and Devouassoud went ahead of us all to explore the way. Here we came to some really bad places, which we passed, with care and patience, and which elicited from Coutet the pithy remark \u2014 \" Sacre- bleu !

We now, however, got some breathing time on a small plain of snow ; and afterwards, for a little while, continued our progress up the glacier, without having to pass any bad crevasses ; we were aided too, rather than impeded, by the new fallen snow, the softness of which took off the danger that would otherwise have existed of slipping upon the ice. Hitherto our progress had been very slow, and we had been obliged to make many counter-marches, so that it was now past seven o'clock. I will observe, by the way, that it is quite impossible for the most extravagant pencil to exaggerate the out lines of glacier scenery. We found every variety of the most abrupt angular masses of icy cliffs, crags, pyramids, and pillars ; and huge piers, supporting su perincumbent strata of ice, twisted and moulded, as though by the operation of heat and excessive pres sure, into such wavy figures as volcanic lavas are often seen to take.

Our general line of march was not up the centre of the glacier, but lay nearer the right side of it, as you face the Col. Soon afterwards, in consequence of our coming to a very bad crevasse, Devouassoud was again sent out to explore apassage in one direction, and Coutet in another, leaving me and the two others together. Here, a large wasp, apparently puzzled, like ourselves, came buzzing round us. We were at fault here for some time. At last, a very narrow bridge of ice was seen at some little distance, which by its darker colour appeared to be old ice, and therefore firm. This bridge, if such it may be called, lay on our right, many feet above us ; and the question was how to reach it. Devouassoud, with ad mirable coolness, yet running risks which made me feel almost faint with anxiety as I witnessed them, managed, by the help of steps which he cut with his axe in the solid ice, to scramble up to the base of a small column of ice, that communicated with a sort of platform, on which there was firm, though scanty, standing room, and whence the bridge might be im mediately reached. The ice column looked insecure ; and the more so, from the quantity of brilliantly white fresh-fallen snow that had lodged against it.

Devouassoud, then cautiously cut steps round its exte rior surface, and so ascended to the platform, followed by another guide, who held one end of a strong cord, the other end of which was tied round my body. I then followed them. The two guides, now firmly placed on the platform, held the cord slackly, not intending to use it unless it was required. It was agreed that they should tighten it if I called out to them to do so, and not else. Thus I wound my way, in their footsteps, carefully round the column ; with yawning gulfs, formed by crevasses intersecting crevasses in every possible direction, beneath me ; steadying myself with one hand, and holding the cord loosely between the finger and thumb of the other; like a child who learns to walk by holding up its frock before it; confidence in either case being the only support really required. The other two guides followed me. WTe then all crossed the narrow bridge of ice without difficulty, and descending by a low, yet perpendicular cliff of ice, we resumed our line of march, leaving this formidable crevasse behind us. It was now eight o'clock. Soon after this the glacier changed its appearance altogether. As we ascended, we found more fresh snow, and fewer cre vasses ; but there was no less need of caution. Here we all tied ourselves together with two stout cords, and"], [149, "135 PROSE AND VERSE. proceeded for half an hour more, until we came to a convenient place for halting ; where we stopped, and took some breakfast ; having had a laborious walk of more than six hours from the Montanvert, almost en tirely over ice. Here I accidentally let fall on the snow the case of the green spectacles which I wore on this expedition. It immediately began to glide away, as if animated, and disappeared down a crevasse at about eighty yards be low us. Nothing is safe for an instant if not well looked after on these treacherous slopes. In order to prevent a like mischance happening to our poles, the loss of any of which would have been a serious matter, we took care never to let them out of our hands without first sticking them firmly upright in the snow by their pointed ends. Whilst we were in the middle of the glacier, I could not help remarking what ridiculous figures we all were, equipped with blouses, frieze gaiters, green spectacles, veils, and slouched hats, pacing along with the most solemn gravity. Devouassoud, in particular, with huge spectacles, and his hat tied on with a handkerchief under his chin, supporting himself with his stick, was no bad representative of Mother Goose. After our repast we resumed our march exactly as before. At a quarter before ten we came on the fresh"], [150, "136 MEMORIALS IN track of more chamois, but we saw none. Mont Blanc now appeared on our right in a rocky opening by the side of the glacier ; and I stood in mute surprise to see how astonishingly diminished in height it now appeared, and how close to us ; yet in reality it was more than six thousand feet above us, and, on that side, wholly inaccessible. We hence pursued our course up a long and steep ascent of snow, in one monotonous zig-zag, interrupted only by our sinking knee-deep into the soft snow, and by the counter-marches it was ne cessary to make in order to find snow bridges strong enough to bear us across the crevasses with which the snow, or serac,* was at this height intersected. Some of these bridges were on principles decidedly unmechanical ; with a downward, and not an upward curve ; fringed with dripping icicles many feet long. Such as these we carefully avoided. In many places we saw creases in the smooth snow, under which we found incipient cracks, and crevasses, of a few inches only in width, showing the perpetual changes going on in these wonderful regions, so that no two journeys * \" On appelle Seracs des parallelipipedes, des cubes, et d'autres formes un peu regulieres de glace et neige, qu'on ren contre a de grandes hauteurs.

And now the bare outline of the summit of the Col seemed to lie just before us ; it was not, how ever, until after nearly another hour's labour over the inclined plane of eternal snow (glacier no longer) that we actually found ourselves upon the highest ridge, 11,142 feet above the level ofthe sea;* having attained our point not without some hard work, and undergoing some risks ; but without any painful de gree of fatigue, and without experiencing any ill effects whatever from the rarity of the air.f The cool, silent precautions of my guides throughout were beyond all praise. But it is not desirable, and it is scarcely possible to remain long on the uppermost ridge. You must make immediately for the rocky buttress where Saussure's cabin stood. In order to reach this spot, you pass a very dangerous steep snow slope, terminating abruptly in an enormous crevasse, on the summit of the glacier of Mont Frety, on the side towards Piedmont. Here, if any unhappy being should chance to slide down, he would be precipitated over the edge of the serac, into the crevasse ; or, possibly, he might shoot right over it, into blank air, and fall ultimately on some spires of t See ascent of Etna, in this Volume. * Forbes."], [152, "138 MEMORIALS IN rock at a terrific depth below. In crossing this slope the new-fallen snow stood us in good stead. It was exactly of the proper consistency for walking upon safely and easily : nevertheless, it appeared to me to be a place where, in some states of the weather, an avalanche might easily be detached, carrying all before it, and with it, over the precipice. Devouassoud told me that on one occasion, on passing this spot, he found it an entire sheet of ice, so that he was obliged to cut steps with his axe right across its whole length in order to reach the rocks. These, however, we now attained without difficulty; and, on arriving, we congratulated one another on the success that had hitherto attended our expedition, and commenced forthwith an attack on our remaining pro visions. From this point the view to the north is quite shut out : but on turning to the south, on the right is the summit of Mont Blanc, with its dependant glaciers, and precipitous buttresses and outworks ; in truth, a sublime and wonderful sight.

No description can convey an adequate idea of this side of Mont Blanc, and of the appearance of the de scent from the summit of the Col du Geant towards Courmayeur. Whilst we were gazing at the view, our attention was arrested by a hissing noise, which we found to proceed from the snow on a very long and precipitous slope to our right, the surface of which, under the in fluence of the noon-day sun, began to slide in gentle avalanches down towards the rocks beneath. We im mediately, merely for the sake of amusement, com menced hurling stones, as large as we could lift, down the slope, in hopes of augmenting the avalanches, but it was wholly without effect. The velocity, however, which these stones acquired before they reached the bottom of the slope, and the force with which they dashed against the rocks below, bursting asunder in clouds of dust, was a striking sight. Two of my guides"], [154, "140 MEMORIALS IN succeeded in detaching a very large mass, which rolled down with tremendous violence ; but it had no more effect on the snow than the smaller ones. Some of the boards of Saussure's cabin, alluded to above, still remain on this spot. Here it was that in his devotedness to science that distinguished philosopher passed seventeen days and nights. The debris of rock here contain a vast quantity of crystals ; and here we found a portion of the broken stem of a thermometer. We also saw several butterflies whilst we remained on the summit. We had, earlier in the day, seen several dead and dying insects on the surface of the snow, and one or two dead half-fledged birds. We remained on the summit ofthe Col until a quar ter before one, and then commenced the descent to wards Courmayeur. Our way lay down a long preci pice of loose rocks and stones, fortunately free from snow. This descent, together with a glissade of snow much lower down, and after that, a steep descent of rude mountain pasture, occupied us, without intermis sion, until past three o'clock ; when we made another halt, at the tail of a snow slope, from under which there issued a delicious stream of ice-cold water. Here we finished our wine, and congratulated each other sincerely on the success of our expedition ; for now all difficulties were past ; and I will not deny having"], [155, "141 PROSE AND VERSE. looked up at the frowning battlements of ice on which we had been so lately standing, with the most exhila rating sensations. During the descent, I was much struck with the towering magnificence ofthe distant Mont Velan, which I had seen in great beauty, when on an excursion to the Great St. Bernard, a fortnight before. The beauty of the scenery below, about Courmayeur, as seen during the descent, exceeds any thing which the vale of Chamonix affords. Other steep pastures, fir woods, and a succession of green sloping meadows, led us finally down into the vale of Courmayeur at a quarter past five. Here, just as we had reached the bottom, although I felt in no respect unpleasantly fatigued, I was attacked by a giddiness so sudden and violent, that I fell against a young ash tree, and thence headlong down a soft grassy bank. My guides, in alarm, ran to my assist ance, and in less than a minute I was perfectly re stored ; nor was I in the least hurt by the fall. This kind of attack I never before experienced. I have no doubt of its having been occasioned by changing the air of the glacier, and of the Col, for that of the valley, which we all found very hot and close. I continued my walk with great caution for a little way, apprehen sive lest the seizure should return : but finding that on"], [156, "142 MEMORIALS IN crossing a narrow wooden bridge over a foaming tor rent, I could stand and look at the troubled waters without inconvenience, I dismissed the subject from my mind, convinced that the indisposition was merely transient. And so it proved. We at length reached Courmayeur at six o'clock, having been on foot for fifteen hours and three quarters. In the evening I experienced a very slight bleeding at the nose. I slept well that night, and the next morning felt little or no remains of fatigue. There is no part of the passage of the Col du Geant, from Chamonix to Courmayeur, that is extraordinarily fatiguing ; though the glacier is sure to be in a state more or less dangerous, and the summit of the Col towards Courmayeur may be in a very dangerous state indeed. The excitement is unceasing, and the atten tion perpetually occupied. I have really been very fortunate in my mountain excursions ; and have been well rewarded for paying a little patient attention to the turns of the weather, which is in a very unsettled state. We had scarcely arrived at Courmayeur, when dark clouds began to gather round the summit of Mont Blanc, and soon after, over the Col du Geant ; and at dusk it came on to rain heavily, with thunder and lightning. I had no fellow-traveller with me on this occasion ;"], [157, "PROSE AND VERSE. 143 and I am sure that in all excursions out of the common run it is best to perform them alone ; that is to say, accompanied only by the necessary guides. Much time must be lost when the party is a large one ; and it is evident that in dangerous places the fewer that have to cross them the better. With respect to passing the Col du Geant, I think, on the whole, it is better to go from Courmayeur to Chamonix, than from Chamo nix to Courmayeur. It may be a question, in case of bad weather, which is the better place of the two to be detained at : but at Chamonix you are sure of getting good guides at a short notice ; and if you intend start ing from Courmayeur, you must send round to Cha monix for a guide to be the leader of the party, and must keep him with you till you start. Also, on the Chamonix side, in passing the glacier, you are going up hill all the way, whereby you obtain a better sight of your main difficulties; which also you thus encounter early in the day's work. But on the other hand, should the rocky precipice on the side of Courmayeur have any snow upon it, the ascent would probably be better than the descent ; however, in such a case it would per haps be the more prudent plan to defer the expedition altogether. The next, morning (Wednesday August 7) was fine after the rain and thunder of the night ; but we ob-"], [158, "144 .MEMORIALS IN served that fresh snow had fallen on the heights, and that the precipitous rocky descent of the Col was now gray with snow ; so that had we delayed our expedi tion a single day longer, it would in all probability have failed. At eight o'clock I left Courmayeur with my guides, and proceeded by the Col de la Seigne, to Chapuy,* our quarters for the night. We were scarcely housed, about dusk, before a thunderstorm came on ; during which, I saw, by a blaze of lightning, three children of the hamlet sitting on the grassy slope of the mountain, not heeding the weather, and no one heeding them. The rain at last drove them in. One had a bowl of milk in his hand ; and another a wreath of Alpine flowers. The next morning we went on by the Col du Bon Homme, to the baths of St. Gervais. Here I bade farewell to my trusty guides, shaking them all four cordially by the hand at parting. They were, of course, going home to Chamonix.

JUVENAL'S \"nequeo monstrare et sentio tantum\" \u2014 the \" felt but undefined\" \u2014 seems at first the only account to be given of the pleasure enjoyed in the con templation of works of art, and especially of Sculpture : but a little consideration shows it to be analogous to the pleasure derived from a simile, which Dr. Johnson defines to be \" the discovery of likeness between two actions in their general nature dissimilar, or of causes terminating by different operations in some resemblance of effect.\" And again he says, \"A simile may be compared to lines converging in a point, and is more excellent as the lines approach from greater distance.\" Life qf Addison. And again \u2014 \" A simile, to be per fect, must both illustrate and ennoble the subject; and show it to the understanding in a clearer view, and display it to the fancy with greater dignity.\" Life of Pope. So, under the hands of the sculptor, a block of marble, every way most unlike the living subject, becomes an enchanting object of intellectual contem plation. And this is effected (as I shall again have occasion to remark) by the influence oi form alone; for in sculpture, the effects of light and shtide, and of"], [168, "154 OBSERVATIONS ON perspective, are impossible ; and any attempt at a closer approach to reality by colouring, or other adventitious aids \u2014 any mistaken substitution of deception for imita tion \u2014 must defeat its own purpose, and tend, like an exhibition of wax work, to surprise without pleasing the spectator, and to overwhelm him beneath an ineffec tual load of detail, and lifeless exemplification. Sculpture is preeminently distinguished by its purely abstract quality \u2014 its ideality \u2014 its admitting of but one style, or, rather, admitting of none \u2014 its holding the letter in entire subjection to the spirit of the subject \u2014 its rejection of realities for the expression of essential verities. If it falls but a little short of this degree of excellence, it is at once repudiated. The sculptor who would pride himself upon his skill in the expression of detail, and rest in that as an end, thenceforwards loses caste ; \u25a0*- Infelix operis summa, quia ponere totum Nesciet\" HOR-ACE. All tours deforce \u2014 all petty triumphs \u2014 all fake appli ances and means, are equally unworthy of his calling. Of this false character are the three following pieces of sculpture in the Chapel of San Severo at Naples; the Modesty (so called) by Corradini ; Man in the toils of Vice by Queirolo ; and the dead Christ, by"], [169, "155 IMITATION. Giuseppe San Martino ; to which we might add, the popular figures of Tarn O'Shanter, and Souter Johnny, that were exhibited some years ago in our own country. It is not from such efforts as the above, but it is from the pure and abstract specimens of the art, that the mind's eye, as it were, acquires the power of restoring a mutilated statue ; for, provided the relic be first-rate, however its material shape may have been injured, the spectator recals without effort the form of the original conception, as though it were immortal and indiscerp tible. The Theseus and the Ilissus in the British Museum, and the Antinous in the Vatican, are grand examples of this. Further, these very qualities of lofti ness and abstraction in form and character exclude nearly all expression from the countenance of a statue, except that which is given to it by the position of the head. The celebrated group of the wrestlers, in the Florence gallery, offers a well-known example. Their features are perfectly calm and unmoved, though the figures themselves appear engaged in the most violent bodily action. On the other hand, the malignant scowl of Canova's gladiators, in the Vatican, adds no thing to the expression conveyed in their attitudes, and can hardly fail to shock the spectator. Again, who, in witnessing first-rate stage dancing, ever thinks of inquiring whether the performer's countenance is"], [170, "156 OBSERVATIONS ON beautiful or not ? Such exhibitions would be equally effective though the performer wore a mask. Every one must have observed that even in grotesque panto mime, the masks then worn rarely fail to bear the ap pearance of varying their expression with the attitudes of the performers. Such is the all-sufficiency of the poetry of form. Hence, however, it follows that sculp ture is necessarily tied down to rigorous accuracy of outline. For who could bear disproportion in a statue ? who could enter upon a physical question of thews and sinews, when called upon to feel deeply, and to gene ralize upon moral attributes ? Moreover, a statue, being a solid, is, geometrically speaking, of three di mensions ; and is, on that very account, brought into such palpable, close, unprotected contact \u2014 such imme diate juxta-position and comparison, with surrounding objects and the breathing world, that it requires to be ensured from meeting with positive contempt by the magic influence of its abstract qualities, with which, as with a kind of divinity, it must be hedged about, or perish. The unities of time and place in a piece of sculpture, are, of course, perfect ; and it is further imperative on the sculptor to preserve its unity of ac tion perfect. The roughest design ever modelled \u2014 the rudest sketch ever dashed off \u2014 will be more pleasing than the finished statue that does not quite succeed."], [171, "157 IMITATION. It is scarcely too much to say that the sculptor ventures for complete success or for total failure. And since the sculptor cannot have a style, he cannot become popular. There cannot be a Hunt or a Wilkie in sculpture. In painting, the case is wholly different. A picture is a surface, and is therefore, geometrically speaking, of two dimensions only. Its unities of time and place are necessarily, as in a piece of sculpture, perfect ; and so ought its unity of action to be ; albeit, greater latitude is allowed to the painter in its developement. Nay, some latitude is allowed him even as regards the unity of time ; for a picture may, as it often does, present circumstances to the spectator, which assist in telling the story, but which could not have occurred at one and the same instant. Besides, the painter produces his effect by a knowledge of colouring, light and shade, outline, and perspective ; each indeed re quiring separate study, but each contributing its dis tinct resources, combining at last in favour of the painter. Many faults in the above particulars are venial : nor is it true, as sometimes asserted, that false drawing in a picture is as unpardonable as false gram mar in writing.* Not because the art of painting has * It is possible to throw a veil even over a grammatical"], [172, "158 OBSERVATIONS ON in itself no abstract quality ; far from it ; but because the faults can be artificially concealed ; they, therefore, do not interfere with the delight of the spectator. In matters of art, \" ce n'est pas pecher que pecher en silence.\" Sir Joshua Reynolds (Notes to Fresnoy, 37) says, \u2014 \" From the various ancient paintings which have come down to us, we may form a judgment with tole- rable accuracy of the excellencies and the defects of the arts among the ancients. There can be no doubt but that the same correctness of design was required from the painter as from the sculptor ; and if what has happened in the case of sculpture, had likewise hap- pened in regard to their paintings, and we had the good fortune to possess what the ancients themselves esteemed their master-pieces, I have no doubt but we should find their figures as correctly drawn as the Laocoon, and probably coloured like Titian.\" But, with deference, does it necessarily follow that the pain ters contemporary with the sculptor of the Laocoon would even in their \" masterpieces \" always draw un- error. For example, in the Book of Common Prayer, in the exordium \u2014 \" Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God of his goodness to give you safe deliverance, and hath preserved you in the great danger of Child-birth ; &c.\" \u2014 the beauty of the rhythm is such that it is not immediately perceived that the verb \" hath preserved\" has no nominative case."], [173, "IMITATION. 159 erringly, although they must be supposed to have per fectly understood the principles of drawing ? Further, how can a statue be said to be \" drawn \" ? Drawing is a word which can only be applied to that which is supposed to be behind, and which is exhibited or projected upon, a plane surface, which is the limit of the approach that the object in a picture can make towards the spectator ; and the world of painting, as it were, thus becomes a region safely removed from the interference of external objects. Hence, it follows that the lowest degree of the art, down to the posi tively bad, and even wretched, will never be without advocates and supporters ; because a picture never can cease altogether to be imitation \u2014 never through the meretricious blandishments of false taste, to whatever pitch of enormity they may be carried, can risk the entire loss of its denomination and character ; a loss which infallibly befals the sculpture that sinks at all below a certain limit, or oversteps the modesty of the rules that are naturally, and not arbitrarily, assigned to it. The Transfiguration of Raphael, and the ve riest sign-post daub, are both of them pictures : but the Theseus of the Parthenon, and Wyatt's Newfound land dog in variegated marbles, are not both of them statues. In common parlance a particular figure or limb in"], [174, "160 OBSERVATIONS ON a picture, is often said to appear to come out of the canvas. This only means that it is more prominent than the other component parts of the picture : the very utmost it can do is to appear to push the plane of the canvas before it: for, otherwise, it would be an imitation of a basso-rilievo, and not a picture. Ano malies are to be met with in the works of the early painters, that are neither examples of, nor exceptions to, any thing that has here been stated. To take a solitary instance, in the Brera gallery at Milan, is a painting by Carlo Crivelli (a. d. 1412) of the Virgin and Child, with attendant saints, in three compart ments ; each compartment being painted, not upon a plane, but upon a convex surface of wood. Several ornaments appertaining to the dresses of the figures, and the keys borne by St. Peter, are attached bodily by gilt wires to the external surface of the painting. But from the hardness of the outlines, the palpable erroneousness of the perspective, which renders criti cism impossible, and the severe character of the whole, the above peculiarities do not in the least detract from its effect, which, owing to its sentiment and rich colouring, is very grand and solemn. Painting may, with the greatest propriety, consist of large groups of figures ; a further instance of the latitude allowed to the painter in the developement of"], [175, "IMITATION. 161 his action. But in sculpture, if an historical subject, for example, consisting perhaps of fifteen or twenty personages, were attempted to be represented, though each particular figure, like the figures in the Niobe gallery at Florence, might be admirably executed, yet the whole would be little better than a spectral assem blage encroaching to an intolerable degree upon ex ternal objects. Of this nature is the uncouth, ill devised monument erected to the memory of Canova in the church of the Frari at Venice, which I cannot believe to have been designed by himself. Again, Samson slaying the Philistines might be represented in painting, but not in sculpture. Again, the cele brated marble group of the Dirce, at Naples, may be objected to on account of the number of figures it con tains. Another, and a very singular instance, is the marble group of the fall of Lucifer and his angels, by Agostino Fagiolato, in the Palazzo Papafava at Padua. It is about five feet high, and contains sixty figures ; the whole being said to be cut out of a single block. In spite of the ingenuity exhibited by the artist, it strikes the eye at once that the whole is supported by a base which is of greater diameter than any other part of the group, so that a pyramid of figures is re presented, a form which of necessity carries the eye upwards instead of downwards, and suggests the idea M"], [176, "162 OBSERVATIONS ON of a rise instead of a fall. Moreover, under its glass case, when seen from a little distance, it looks, owing to its complexity, not unlike a specimen of stalactite, or some calcareous marine formation, such as we see in museums of natural history. It is perhaps the most curious example of perverted art in existence. In all these examples the unity of action is violated. At the same time, such subjects may very properly be repre sented in a cameo or intaglio, or in a basso-rilievo, in which the figures are, as in a picture, referred to one general plane surface; a principle certainly acknow ledged in the following graphic passage from the Pro messi Sposi (cap. iv.), where it is said of two persons, neither of whom will suffer the other to take the wall \u2014 \" Quei due si venivano incontro, entrambi stretti alia muraglia, come due figure di basso rilievo ambulanti.\" Again, the fine spiral illusion of Trajan's column af fords a magnificent example of the properties of bas so-rilievo. Alto-rilievos, on the contrary, are rarely finely conceived. In them statuary appears to be ap plied bodily to a background, to which they are hardly referable ; and this gives them a confused character. Their fault is a lack of distinctness of purpose ; their unity of action is broken and disturbed ; the spectator is left in doubt whether the artist intended them to be, geometrically speaking, of two or of three dimensions."], [177, "IMITATION. 163 The Laocoon, in the Vatican, is not so much a group, as a single figure exquisitely garnished and set out. The two children, as they are called, have evi dently been introduced merely as accessories, and to assist in telling the story. Moreover, they modify the outline of the whole ; whilst their very impossibility confines the main interest to the principal figure, which is a perfect example of the oneness attributable to sculpture. Again, for example, let Cupid chaining a lion be re presented in sculpture. Agreeably to the abstract spirit, the natural relative proportions of the figures need not be sustained. The lion may with propriety be represented even smaller than the Cupid ; for the object is to embody an allegory \u2014 the triumph of love over brute force \u2014 and not the taming of a real lion by a child, which possibly such a group might assume the appearance of, if it were exactly proportioned. But let the same subject be represented on canvas. Now, no such liberty can be taken with the relative propor tions ; for the art of painting is endowed with accesso ries sufficient to secure it against misinterpretation, and is, in return, pledged to fidelity. It has been remarked that the boats are too small, in Raphael's cartoon of the miraculous draught of fishes ; but that remark would never have been made, had that subject"], [178, "164 OBSERVATIONS ON been represented in basso-rilievo. From this, coupled with the foregoing remarks, it may be easily deduced, that the number of figures in a piece of sculpture ought not to exceed two or three ; and that the most intellectual efforts of the chisel are single figures. Il will follow too from what has already been said, that, because sculpture is wholly without the soft ening accessories of drawing, there are many single figures which it may not attempt to represent. Such a figure as the lame beggar at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, in Raphael's cartoon, would not be bear able in sculpture : nor can I think that the statue of the lame man by Pythagoras of Leontium, mentioned in high terms of praise by Pliny, could have been an agreeable object of contemplation. In the Florence gallery, the statue by Donatello, of St. John in the wilderness, in an emaciated state, is a similar instance. Works of imitation are not all admirable because re presented to the life. Sculpture, born to lofty flights, and unbounded range of thought, degenerates as soon as domesticated : but painting, by admitting a lower tone, becomes fitted for the cabinet as well as the gallery. It has been observed of Chantrey that his imaginative subjects lost much of their intellectual intention after he had been long engaged in the execution of busts and portraits"], [179, "lsMITATION. 165 in marble : on the other hand, the poet Cowper's well known effusion beginning \" O that those lips had lan guage ! \" owes its tenderness to its being addressed to a picture. He would never have so dwelt upon the scenes of his childhood, and introduced his readers into the very nursery, in lines penned to his Mother's Statue. As we have seen is the case in alto-rilievos, objects of three dimensions are often injudiciously mingled with those of two, in stage scenery, and in its kindred branches of imitative art. In this case failure is sure to be the result. Theatrical effects are produced by the joint agency of living performers and of scenery; which latter is displayed on a stage of both width and depth, necessarily backed by a landscape or sky painted upon a plane surface ; in fact, by a picture ; it is therefore somewhat of a mixed and ambiguous character. But this ambiguity escapes remark so long as the interest of the audience is engrossed by the action and dialogue. But when the legitimate interest of the drama falls off, vain are the efforts made to elevate stage scenery into a source of real entertainment. Every one must have been struck by the incongruity of the elements of imi tation brought together in the moving panoramic views, with which, in spite of their costly magnificence, the effect of our pantomimes is frequently chilled."], [180, "166 OBSERVATIONS ON Again, it is curious to witness the violence with which the elements of stage scenery resist any misapplication of their effectiveness. I recollect once having seen some dwarfs or pygmies make their entry from what was intended to represent their proper dwelling ; but which was a dwelling painted upon the front scene on a proportionally diminutive scale ; and therefore to the spectators bore the appearance of a dwelling of the ordinary size, seen in perspective at a considerable distance ; so that, on their entrance from the practi cable door in the front grooves, a few steps carried the tiny actors to the very foot-lights, over the seeming space of half a mile, to the confusion of all intelligi ble effect. Palladio's interesting Teatro Olympico, at Vicenza, exhibits a similar want of judgment in the arrangement of the stage. The building is, to a certain extent, intended to be on the model of an ancient Greek Theatre, and is furnished with immoveable scenery. At the back of the stage, views of two streets are exhi bited by means of solid wooden painted models of houses, made less and less, and placed bodily one behind the other so as to give the effect of the natural perspective of the streets. And whilst the stage is empty, all is well. But when an actor has to make his entry down one of these vistas, passing in three tragic strides over the ap parent space of at least three hundred yards, the effect,"], [181, "167 IMITATION. as may be readily anticipated, is peculiarly unhappy. Again, the following is a mistake which shows the impossibility of overstepping certain limits in stage representations. In London, a year or two ago, in the performance of the Tempest, the opening scene of the storm was thus introduced. It was arranged that during a few seconds before the drawing up of the curtain the cries of the mariners on the stage should be heard ; and with these supposed notes of preparation in the ears of the audience, the curtain rose. This manage ment was intended, no doubt, greatly to enhance the effect. But it is manifest that the mind of a spectator, before the drawing up of the curtain, even for the mi nutest portion of subdivided time, cannot possibly con ceive the play to be begun ; and in consequence, this ingenious device, instead of increasing the interest, had merely the effect of creating the idea of a disturb ance behind the scenes. Quite in point with these remarks is the following anecdote from the Rejected Addresses. \" Mr. Whit bread contended that the actor was like a portrait in a picture, and accordingly placed the green curtain in a gilded frame remote from the foot-lights ; alleging that no performer shall mar the illusion by stepping out of the frame. Dowton was the first actor who, like Manfred's ancestor in the castle of Otranto, took"], [182, "168 OBSERVATIONS ON the liberty of abandoning the canon. ' Don't tell me of frames and pictures,' ejaculated the testy Comedian ; ' if I can't be heard by the audience in the frame, I'll walk out of it.'\" And unquestionably the actor was right. Pictorial effect was no part of his business. The manager was misled by the desire of reducing scenical representations to one constant denomination of extension. His error was the attributing impor tance to an incongruity which had, certainly, a real existence, but which, on the boards of a theatre, was of no real consequence. Tableaux vivans are the converse of paintings. Their object is to make solidity look like surface, and the real living subject stand for its own resemblance. From what has been said above, it is easy to see that, in order to be successful, they must be conducted with care and good taste ; and that any injudicious intro duction of accessories, confounding them with stage effect, must be fatal to the illusion. I remember wit nessing a charming effect that took place in a tableau quite accidentally. One of two lovely young women who formed the group, fatigued perhaps by the attitude in which she was standing, unconsciously began to move, as if reanimated, like another Hermione, whilst her eyes lightened up, and a smile played about her features, as she gazed upon her motionless companion,"], [183, "169 I.MITATION. as if she were about to address her ; and in that instant the curtain was let fall, leaving an impression on the mind more agreeable than any that fancy could have evoked from a bewitching and masterly painting. In the Winter's Tale, the spectacle of Hermione as a painted statue is neither barbarous nor absurd in the representation, taken conjointly with the dialogue and arrangement of the scene. It should be also borne in mind that the old English Dramatists are in the habit of using the words picture and statue as conver tible terms.* In the minds of the audience the injured Hermione yet fives ; and on the stage even Leontes does not seem quite deceived by the artifice, but to be half addressing his words to her ears, and half to those of the surrounding personages. The manner too in which the harshness of the scene is softened down by Leontes referring to Perdita, and thereby constituting her a link of approximation between the Statue and the other characters present on the stage, together with Perdita's reply, is eminently beautiful : Leontes. ----- O royal piece, There's magic in thy majesty, which has My evils conjured to remembrance, and From thy admiring daughter took the spirits, Standing like stone with thee ! * See Massinger's City Madam, Act v. ac. 3."], [184, "170 OBSERVATIONS ON Perdita. And give me leave ; And do not say 'tis superstition, that I kneel, and then implore her blessing. Winter's Tale. Act. v. sc. 3. In reading even these few lines we forget the Sta tue, and see only the wife and mother. In pictures of a high and abstract class, the naked female figure is often seen most fancifully adorned with jewellery: and statues, when no deception is intended thereby, may, I think, be allowed to be decorated in a taste which is at first sight false, but which is in truth a shape in which legitimate homage may be conceived to be done to the ideal form embodied in the marble. The golden sandals of the Theseus of the Parthenon may have been ornaments of this description. Thus too, the ears of the Venus de' Medici at Florence are actually bored for earings; so are the ears of the Venus d' Aries at Paris ; again, thus does Ovid repre sent Pygmalion as caressing and adorning the ivory statue he had made : Interea niveum mird feliciter arte Sculpsit ebur, formamque dedit, qua fcemina nasci Nulla potest ; operisque sui concepit amorem.

That very extravagance of admiration were rather, cethinks, praiseworthy than otherwise, that would suspend a necklace of pearl about the neck of a fine statue, or crown its head with a garland of the earliest and sweetest violets ; not without a sensation of plea sure in approaching the verge of incongruity in the very wantonness and pride of a thorough appreciation of the art. But I will not indulge in remarks that may perhaps appear too fanciful. Coloured toys, and china figures of men and ani mals, being conceived and executed in jest rather than in earnest, are, in their proper places, very pleasing. Deception is no part of their intention. The absolute necessity that exists for generalization in all matters of imitative art, is well illustrated by the signal failure of the Daguerrotype as a means of tak ing portraits. In these productions, for chemical rea sons, the metallic plate is variously affected by images which are necessarily of various intensities, depending"], [186, "172 OBSERVATIONS ON upon the complexion of the sitters; and therefore hardly a case occurs of the process being tried, in which some lines and shadows are not unduly exagge- rated, and others omitted, so that a portion of the truth, but not the whole truth, is conveyed, thereby in many instances quite falsifying the effect. Moreover, our idea of any individual is not formed from the ex- pression of his countenance, or attitude, at any given moment ; but from a general average of all the impres- sions made upon us by his presence at different times ; an effect which a portrait painted in several sittings, which occupy time, may well express, but which the momentary process of the Daguerrotype, except by rare accident, cannot succeed in producing. A machine cannot select, modify, or generalize, and therefore can- not attain to imitation. But copies of pictures and statues, and especially of the latter, made with the Daguerrotype, are by no means amiss. In such copies, though they are instantaneously produced, there is no lack of selection, modification, and generalization ; be- cause these have been severally secured by the labours of the artists who have wrought on the originals. Time has already been expended upon them, and the process of copying them by instantaneous methods comes in with its full effect. Similar remarks may be extended to portraits or"], [187, "173 IMITATION. statues of actors in character. I cannot admire the conception of even Harlowe's well-known picture of the Kemble family, whom he has represented as acting the trial scene in Shakspeare's Henry VIII. Contrast with this the fine abstraction effected by Sir Joshua Reynolds in his portrait of Mrs. Siddons, not as Lady Macbeth, or Queen Catharine; but as the Tragic Muse ; and consequently embodying all her characters at once. After all, beset as imitative art is with the imperious dictates of fashion, entangled as it is with its own ra mifications, still it is naturalness alone that confers on any of its productions effect and value. And the quality of naturalness is not to aim at a cold delinea tion of reality, but to have the developement of truth for its sole object : and this is good taste : whereas, the practical effect of bad taste is to falsify, by substituting deception for imitation ; not having the faculty of per ceiving that the required truth consists in the selection, modification, and generalization of the external features of Nature, by which process alone can the mind be rescued from the crude interruptions of circumstance. This is as much as to say that in order to secure na turalness, Nature must be improved upon ; a principle recognised in the \" qua f\u0153mina nasci nulla potest\" of the passage cited above, and in the following from Homer ;"], [188, "174 OBSERVATIONS ON rbv fitv 'AQrjvain 8iJKtv, Aloe hyeyavia, ptiZova t liaiSUiv Kai itimnova- Kdd' 6t Kuprirog oiiXac r/Kt Kopag, vaKivBivui avQu 6/ioiaf. uiq 5' ore tiq xpvabv irtpixivirai apyvpii) dvi)p XSpig, ov \"H(*iai*roc SiHatv Kai llaWdg 'A8iivn Tiyyr\\v iravroiTjv, %apUvra Sk fpyd reXetEt* &\u00a3 dpa rif KaTtxtvt \\apiv Kttf>a\\yT6 Kai HipoiQ.

Poor were they from their birth, and rural toil Supplied their daily bread : yet both were young, And strong, and healthy ; and their spirit rose Above the surface of calamity, Buoyed up by hope, and gaiety of heart, Which in their nation often takes the hue Of loftiest virtue. So the orphans clave To one another, and swift years rolled by. It was the busy day of harvest-home; And Maurice with his fellows fared afield, Foremost to gather in the rustling sheaves. Their hearts were willing, but their bodily frames Fainted with toil: a dull, unnatural sense Of hot imprisonment and ponderous gloom Hung o'er the flagging spirits like a pall.

There lay her stay, her guide, her love, her life, Her other self. She fell upon his couch, And called on Maurice. The night wore away, And the next day and night ; but hope was none, Save in the downy feather placed before His lips, that with his breath was idly stirred ; And in his feeble inarticulate moans, And some few precious words of wandering speech.

Still the kind neighbours came, To weep around him, for they loved him well. Months passed, with little change ; and it was said, Though reason and perception were restored, Maurice must go a cripple to his grave. But in the secret soul of Genevieve Heroic thoughts arose, with feelings 'kin To gladsome inspiration. She had heard A wounded veteran, to his home returned, With fervency of thankful speech proclaim The healing virtues of the ocean wave : And Genevieve was fed on liveliest hope.

Her heart Was fixed ; and oftentimes she laughed and sang, In triumph of the unconquerable will, To hide from Maurice her exceeding toil. Nor passed the twins unnoticed. The rude swain Paused at his work to bless them ; even the loud Postilion, that had passed them and repassed, Upon the pave slacked, and raised his hat, And hushed his whip's explosions ; oftentimes The charitable sisters by the skirts Of towns and villages, and the spare priest, Devoutly questioned them, with hands upraised In solemn benediction.
