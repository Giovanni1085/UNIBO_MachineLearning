Dear Sir, \u2014 In my letter to you posted from the Norddeut s.her Lloyd Postdampfer Sachsen (before reaching Ceylon), I had promised to give you, shortly after my arrival in Bombay, a sketch of what sort of voyage I made in the Ger man boat. I now keep up my promise, and have got this my first fascicule, printed as an advance sheet to my future publication (which will take some time to publish, especially in a country like this), giving a faithful and accurate narra tive or personal history of my tour in Europe. This is my 3rd tour to Europe ; and it will embrace a period of some 5 months from July 10th, the da}7 on which I left Bombay on S. S. Singapore, Rubattino line, as its Surgeon and Medical Officer, down to November 1 _th, the day on which I landed in Colombo, on my way home to Bombay. Although the period of my actual tour in Europe, from Moscow to Birmingham and Balmoral to Genoa, embraces a short term of two and a half months (from August 2nd to October 27th), still it is so very full of unique events, so very instructive, and so full of interesting episodes, which betray a good many traits in the character of the great English nation, as well as in the temper and character of its neigh bours \u2014 the French and the Germans, that I fear I'll not be able, with my feeble pen, to delineate the various parts or sections of it, in the way I should wish to do."], [20, "4 To faithfully and graphically sketch this my tour, another Max O'Rell\u2014 the author of John Bull and his Island and other works forming part of the entire John Bull series,\u2014 or another Auguste Laugel, the author of L'Angleterre, Politique et Sociale\u2014 will be required. For as rightly remarked by my French Professors of the Ecole de Medecine. Paris, Dr. Benja min Anger and others, it was a regular Pali- Comedie ou Come die politique joue par nos voisins, wherein I, \u2014 a poor innocent Indian, was made the victim of what I have rightly named the delusion Anglais. The Red Rag of my White Baby has allowed himself to be chased out of London, after a good deal of fruitless boycotting of him in Central Europe, \u2014 though not chez-vous in Russia, where on the contrary my passport was endorsed with a permit to travel and to remain there for six months more. Now that he is caged and chained, like the Joe Gorilla, iu the country of the Hindoos, it is time to review the whole history of the tour, dispassionately and with much of thought and less of feeling. I promised you to do that, and hope ere long to present you soou a good little volume containing my own views and opinions as to the traits I have observed in my poli-comedie actors during this my tour in Europe. I must take time to think out the various conclusions I have come to, both as regards the moral and psychological aspects of the subject, as disclosed to me in this Poli-comedie Anglais, played out on the platforjn of Europe, and in which it seemed, at first, that I was the \" il etait bien expose\" person, but turned out in tho end, that it was more the exposure of the sensitive points of somebody else, who were so bent, from the moment, I set my foot on the European soil, to chase me out of it. it was indeed an exceptional chance for me, an Indian of ..me experience and knowledge of Europe and its people, to have the rare privilege of looking from a different point of"], [21, "5 view, at the countrymen of the practical, far-seeing and shrewd men, who rule and govern this, the country of the Hindoos. And I believe they, i.e. the Anglo-Indians, will be the last men to smother me in my attempt, feeble as it is, to hold before the Englishmen of London and the Continent, a faithful Looking-Glass for them, from my own point of view. I beg to remain, Your most obliged And grateful friend, Dr. K. R. VICCAJI."], [22, "6 Avant- Pro pas. This my tour was indeed a regular Poli-Comedie, wherein a White Giant fruitlessly tried to kill a Black Bug, out of pure delusion, and which led him to magnify the Bug into another little bit of a Giant, scratching him on the face. For all that sort of scratching, I (a poor innocent quiet Black Bug of Bombay) had given him during my student days in Paris in 1880-81, he has severely scratched me in return, and kept incessantly stinging me like a spiteful wasp, from the moment I set my foot on the European soil, to the date of my return and landing in India. But for all that, I bear no grudge, no ill-will against his nation. For the blunder and delusion of a couple or more of the leading men of the nation, I will be the last man to kick the entire nation. I am not a misanthrope, to hate the whole set ; neither a lip -loyalty man like many \" subjects of the Viceroy\" (vide concluding para, iu the end) in this country, and carry two faces, to preach a bos les Anglais with one face, and to sing \" God save the Queen'' with the other. Like my \"Time-is-money \" man himself, I claim to be equally frank, honest, and conscientious ; and if I record and publish the prominent features of this Poli-Comedie Anglais, it is not that I resort to reprisals, after being allowed by my White Giant to retire into- my own shell, unscathed and alive. While the various poli-comedie acts and scenes, were being enacted, I have observed some sensitive points, some wrong ends, \u2014 certain traits in my principal poli-comedieactors. I have often felt how my \" greenhorn \" of a John Bull has made himself transparent before me, and which up to this he was never. He has allowed hvmself to be seen by me. And I'll really be wanting in gratitude to him, if I don t (in my turn) become equally transparent and reflect as it were his own image, which he has left on my breast. In presenting to him this the first fascicule of my Looking-Glass for my poli-"], [23, "7 comedie actors in Europe, in the shape of personal history of my tour from Moscow to Birmingham, I believe I am simply making myself sufficiently transparent, to allow myself to be seen by him. Torender a perusal of this my narrative of tour in Europe (this the third time) intelligible and interesting, it is necessary to arm the reader with certain facts and incidents, having re ference to my former two European tours, undertaken in the years 1875-76 and in 1879-80-81. But as I will be going fully into the history of these, in my complete diary to be pub lished some time hence, I'll content myself, by way of pream ble, by transferring bodily to this advance sheet, a great part of my letter to the Editor of the London Times, dated Paris, September 13th, 1890, and which was returned to me with the Editor's compliments. It was headed \" Boycotting of a Native of India in Europe,\" and much of it will be found printed in Appendix No. 1. I would also call the reader's attention to the long list of Select Poli-comedie Songs and Hungarian Valses, given at the end of this preface. A previous acquaintance with these is likely to initiate him better into the mysteries of the whole poli-comedie plot, played out on the political platform of some of the cities of Europe, visited by the Indian Tourist. The last act of the poli-comedie was very adroitly performed, both by the poli-comedie actors and I \u2014 the victim of delusion Anglais,\u2014 on board the Norddeutscher Lloyd Postdampfer Sachsen ; and this the first fascicule, in fact embraces the entire narrative of my journey homewards on board the said ship. My object in preserving mes souvenirs of this very interest ing tour in Europe, extending from Moscow to Birmingham in one direction, and Balmoral to Genoa in another, is not so much to record my experience obtained therein, for the benefit/of my countrymen, the Parsis of Bombay, \u2014 who are so fond Si travelling in Europe and America ; nor for the man of cow-dung and red paint~the Hindoo, who seldom crosses the"], [24, "8 sea, and who is too much attached to his own ancient institu tions and ways of living, to his \" monkey police\" and to his idols ; and who is not at all likely to appreciate or to understand the bearings of what he may be told by me. I am sure the people of this country \u2014 I mean the educated classes of the Parsis and Hindoos \u2014 would not and cannot look at this subject from the same standpoint of view as an European would. Looking to the ignorance of many of our educated classes, I mean, even of the many who have studied and lived for some time in England, as to what constitutes \" European life \" and \" European society;\" upon what foundation their entire social and political fabric rests ; how in close touch with each other and with the governing authorities and united, under one banner, each individual member of a nation is; how their social institutions of Cafes, Theatres, Clubs, and nightly re-unions, and above all their conscription or volunteer system, link each individual unit of a nation Europeen into one harmonious whole ; \u2014 I say for many of my educated and travelled country men, it will be difficult to understand thoroughly aud appreciate in all its bearings, the details of the sufferings I have undergone in some of the cities of Europe, owing to what I have justly named pure delusion Anglais. Even if some of my sympathising Indian friends are able to look at this poli-comedie affair, in the same true light as it ought to be, still it is not to them I look for justice. I will be the last man going (after ray knowledge of civilized Europe and its people gained this, the third time) to appeal to an Asiatic, for any grievances I may have fro ventilate. I will be the last man to ask an Asiatic, and much less a subject of the conqueror of the Hindoos, to sit in judgment on this contre-temps Anglais affair. I will be the last Euuopeanised Parsee going, to let any of the uncivilized Indians kick the highly civilized and superior nations of Europe, \u2014 I mean the English, the French, the German or the Russian. My Philippi will not be, \u2014 can never be \u2014 India, the country of the Hindoos, but Europe itself. I should always"], [25, "9 like to wash my dirty clothes wherever found, and would not carry them beyond my own residence, from country to country and people to people. My main object in recording mes souvenirs de vogaye, is to hold a faithful Looking-Glass before my Poli-Comedie actors themselves, so that they may be able to find out, after their own manner, and hang the man or men who in his or their delusion set the entire nation Anglais against me; and through it, its many sympathisers and friends on the Continent of Europe, as soon as I set my foot on European soil. I would only repeat here, what I have repeatedly expressed to many in England and on the Continent, I came in contact with, that if I was an Englishman, entrusted with the task of looking after an Indian travelling in Europe, suspected (as I was ever since 1881) of something akin to Fenian action and opinion; suspected of reviling or criticising unfairly the administration of India, I should either let him understand, that it was not safe for him to travel in Europe again, until he cleared him self of the stain attached to his name by his former action in Paris in 1881 ; and for which I would tell him our Intelligence Department had secretly placed his name ever since on our \"Black List.\" And should the Indian suspected of Fenian like views or opinions still persist, I would threaten him with annoyance from the English Intelligence and Consular Depart ments, scattered all over Europe ; and to threaten him still more would show him also, what a long purse I have, in the shape of Secret Service Budget of India, and which is always debited to its Military Account Department. Or if this would no more suit the views of the many \" liberty of action and free dom of thought \" men (in England), I should quietly allow the suspected Indian Fenian, to travel in whatever part or parts of Europe he liked. I would even arm him with a passport, for travelling into the very heart of Russia, and while I did all that, I would keep strict surreptitious watch on him and on all his movements. And when the proper time came,"], [26, "10 when I could morallg be satisfied, that the Indian Tourist was really guilty of reviling or defaming the management of my Asiatic Empire, or that he was gratuitously carrying a brief in behalf of the Brahmin and Baboo political grievance mongers of the principal cities of India, I would then only and not till then take steps, to seize my game by the neck or to chase him out of Europe, back to his Indian cage, to be chained there. Even of these two courses, the best and the most politic course would be, to take no notice at all of what even a dozen \" Anti-Anglais \" would say, contre le regime anglais des Indes. For to notice such opinions or criticisms, would only be exposing one's sensitive points or wrong ends and which it is always safe to conceal as much as possible. Narrative of the personal history of my tour is to a great extent anticipated by my letters, written to friends in India and elsewhere from Europe. As I look upon them as a very inter esting and valuable souvenir, I have tried to re-obtain as many of them as I can (excepting those that were torn or destroyed) from my friends in Bombay, and have printed them in extenso in the appendix. I leave it to the reader's intelligence to understand, what part of each letter is meant for castigation or as a rejoinder to my poli-comedians ; what to amuse or to lull and pacify their rage, by appealing to their vanity ; what to draw or pump them out more, and what to act as a ruse or blind. I knew that was the only way, to give a bit of my mind to my poli-comedians, aud to whisper as it were into their ears sage counsel and admonition. For I am sure my femme anglaise and her friends stood so much in need of curtain lectures, from the moment I began my tour in Europe, to the east of Frankfort-on-the-Maine, to the time I landed in Ceylon. I am glad I have succeeded to a great extent in this my method to later le pouts of my White Giant, that I am sure when the Black Bug is again en lour in Europe, he, my White Giant, will at once begin to sound the trumpet of \" hands off \" and cry out \" Ne vous fiiez pas d lui, c'est une ficelle.\""], [27, "11 This is my sixth voyage to and from Europe, and never had I any occasion to handle pen and paper so very frequently, and with so great a penchant for writing long letters, which were nicknamed on the ship, my \" despatches\" and \" lectures.\" I find I wrote more than 20 long, very long, letters or \"despatches\" after sighting Port Said. As they all were intended to give a bit of my mind, to my poli-comedie actors on board the ship, they were for evident reasons unsealed. After \" despatching \" them, I could in no time read their contents on the faces of many of my actors, who it seemed to me were easily drawn out if blistered ; and lulled, pacified and amused, if treated with sweetened pan -cakes and cqjolerie. I was quietly noticing to what sort of innocent flirtation, I had almost driven my poli comedie actors, by mes chants amoureux, and which kind of flirtation, I am proud to assure the reader, did not end till I quitted the deck of the S.S. Sachsen at Colombo, on the morning ofthe 10th November 1890, after breakfast. In short, I was considerably amused within myself to find that by this method, peculiarly Parisienne, I could make each and all of my poli-comedians dance, the Hungarian Valses at my direction and at my will. In reproducing most of my letters written from the sea, as well as from Europe, I have taken good care to suppress my love-songs, i.e.. all that was amoureux in style and thought, and which should, wisdom always dictates, never see the light of the broad world. To conclude, I trust that this faithful Looking-Glass which I hold before my poli-comedie actors themselves, would tell them to prenez garde in future, how they blindly leap into a trap prepared for them, by their wily neighbour on the other side of the Channel ; to think twice before they commit again a blunder, like the present great blunder, which, I am sure, has led many far-seeing people in Berlin and Russia, and in Paris surtout, to laugh under their sleeves at my \" greenhorn of a John Bull.\"* * Expression borrowed from an American Book called \" Two English men, by an American,\" pp. 154."], [28, "12 Specimens* of Select poU-comedle Songs and Phrases and \"Hungarian. Waltzes.\" I think I must first ensure the good-will of my readers, and with this object in view, I like to preface the personal history of my tour, with a few specimens of Poli-Comedie Songs, and Phrases and '-Hungarian Waltzes.\" To most of these frequent reference will be made in the narrative. Many of these were almost daily dinned into my ears, all throughout my tour, either by the poli-comedie actors themselves or their agents, friends, and sympathisers. The English poli-comedie songs will be especially referred to, in the Tourist's London Notes (to bo published hereafter). The Continental \" Hungarian Waltzes\" will be alluded to in my narrative of journey on the Continent, in Berlin and Paris especially, and on the lines of railways connecting these two cities. 1. \"A b\u2014 d \u2014 y Fenian and a bold beggar, travelling all over Europe.

It was evidently intended to direct my attention to him. I gave a gentle reprisal to his stupid re marks, so very ostensibly forced into my ears, by hinting openly, \u2014 \" It is real moral cowardice to be attacking a solitary traveller in that style\" and the ladies round about him smiled and after some whispering going on between this London bully, a young man barely 26 (with a nose whose shape and type were indicative of weak intellect) and his neighbours, he left the theatre. I was really sorry for him.

I am here for a short time and shall feel highly obliged, if you can drop me a post-card, saying when I can see you here in your bureau. I have simply to talk upon a matter, not so much of personal interest to me, as to your countrymen in general, living in the cifies of Europe. Pray don't be alarmed at what I say. It is after all a very trivial affair. When we meet I am sure, I'll be putting you in possession of facts and things, which ought at least to startle you, just as they have done to me.

But as I was absent in Scotland at the time, I wrote yesterday morning in acknowledging his letter, to say that I will be calling on him Wednesday, 22nd instant, at 4\u00a3 p.m. to tell him personally, what sort of boycotting treatment I had suffered from the hands of men, quite unknown to me, and who could never have seen me before, in the cities of Ger many and other places in Europe. I called punctually at 4._ o'clock at the India Office, and was shown bythe porter a room facing his bureau, and was told by him to wait there for some time for Sir Fitzgerald's arrival. At about 10 minutes to 5 he came in, and I was shown into his room. Here I first as sured him, that I had come to see him more in his private capa city, as the official gentleman of the India Office, who had helped me so much in my first visit to England in November 1875, in the matter of my sick brother F.R.V. and not in his official capacity as the Political A. D. C. to the Secretary of State for India. I handed him a copy of my French These ; also copies of letters addressed by me to the Editor of the London Times, The Daily Telegraph, the Bombay Gazette, and Messrs. Dadabhoy Naoroji and D. Byramjee, London. (To be published hereafter with my Diary or Personal History of Tour in Europe). I simply brought to his notice the whole of this ugly blunder, which led to my boycotting in the cities of Europe, directly I entered them, and then parted after about 15 minutes' conversation. For he had directly I was ushered into his room, told me that as he was staying out of town, he had very little time to spare, aud that I should be very brief in whatever I had to tell him. I accepted the hint, and thought it better to hand him the entire correspondence with a copy of my French These, which was the original cause of this mis chief. I requested him to peruse the entire correspondence at his leisure, and if he did not like it, to consign it to the fire place behind his seat. This morning at 10| o'clock, I had called on Sir W. G. Hunter (my old Surgeon General and Professor and Principal,"], [43, "27 Grant Medical College, Bombay) who knew me since 1860, when he first came to the Jamsetji Jeejeebhoy Hospital, as Acting Surgeon for Dr. Ballingall. I went to him to learn what reply he had to give me, with reference to my application to give me a good paying appointment on the Nizam's Guaran teed State Railway, of which he was one of the Directors, and the reply I got from him was, that he had handed my applica tion to the Secretary of the Railway Company, and that there was no vacancy at present. He asked me when I was going back, and strongly urged me to go soon to Bombay and do there something, instead of doing nothing in London. Tres bien ! I understood well the meaning of the hint, which was simply to see an unpleasant man like me, again caged and chained to the Indian Shop of my \" greenhorn of a John Bull,\" perhaps for ever, i. e. until he falls sick and dies. I may take this opportunity of recording here, as my experience of what I call a trait in English character. It is that I have often found my John Bull (with a view to serve his own objects and ends) insisting upon a bare-faced denial of fact or facts, at times distorting and at times suppressing portions of it. I had asked this, my familiar old professor, if he had received any letters from me directed from Paris, and which were sac-simile copies of my letters to the London Times and the Bombay newspapers. He boldly assured me not one of my letters from Paris did reach him. Now I could not conceive, that a letter registered*}* in a Paris Post Office and addressed, not to an ordinary person but to an M. P. and a Knight of Her Majesty's Order of St. George, could ever be miscarried. However, I leave off this matter, which beyond showing a trait in English character is of no material im portance to me.

Also to an article headed Our Hookabardar, in a number of the Globe of the same month, and to which also by indirect hints, my attention was called in the Hotel, at the newspaper stall. law 1 cam\u00a9 to fee b\u00a9yeey_tec_ la B\u00abg0p@, I was obliged to quit the Empress Theatre, as early as 11 o'clock, and with my breast full of chagrin, at the most contemptible way in which I was treated by well-dressed and apparently well-to-do Englishmen, from whom a solitary traveller like me and one who stands in the relation of a fellow-subject with them, is entitled at least to a different sort of treatment, and more especially when I was visiting their own country. I strongly felt that my \" Time-is-money \" i-ian has not that sense to appreciate, what a compliment I had paid him in coming over from the Continent to his city, which I had seen twice before this and stood in no greater need to see it any more. His treatment of me on the Continent was sufficient to frighten any other man, less experienced than my self with Europe and its people, and to induce him to take to his heels and to go back to India. In fact, this was the actual sort of advice given to me by a countryman of mine and a member of the National Liberal Club, when 1 wrote to him a long letter complaining of the boy-"], [48, ". .1 . . ..... .11, tK.

Singapore, Rubattino Line of Passenger service in the East, for Europe, as its surgeon and medical officer. Directly I set my foot on European soil, the first gun was fired at Messina, by a man of the Latin race, the late Portuguese Consul for Bombay, who marching past me on the deck used to sing into my ears more than once, \" Je croyais bien qu'il est imbecile.\" The actual boycotting of me did not begin, till I opened my tour to the eastward of ' Frankfort-on-the Maine. Up to the time of my arrival and stay in this city of Germany, I believe I was surreptitiously watched by my John Bull's Agence de surveillance, paid perhaps from the Secret Service Budget of India. I believe I was up to Frankfort watched as to what direction I take, \u2014 westward of it to Paris and London or to its eastward to Berlin and Russia. I had honestly and frankly given out my programme of tour, even to some of the officers of the Rubattino boat, when bidding them good-bye, and on their asking me where and what parts of Europe I intended to make my tour in. And from Wiesbaden the game of chase, most deservedly named Poli-comedie or Come die Politique (Political Comedy) by my French Professors, was opened by une dame anglaise, when she cried out, on seeing me march past her, on my way to the Salon-de-Lecture of the Kursal Hall, \" They say he is mad \" (! !) How the second act of the Poli-comedie was next played out in Berlin, and how hard it was tried there to give my legs a strong pull back, and not to allow me to proceed to Russia, the country of another Red Rag to rny White Giant, I prefer detailing in my notes of tour in Europe to be published hereafter. I had heard an old honest anglais passenger, on board the Dover-Ostend boat (October 24th, Friday afternoon), talking"], [52, "36 to a lady in my presence and amusing himself at my expense, saying that \" When she found she could not get back, she made her will, called a priest, and began to make confession.\" Yes my frank White Baby, I did make what you choose to call a \" confession.\" I believe it is now your turn, my White Baby, Sir Mad-Hour and his colleague Mrs. McDuff, of Canadian Burma, to make your confession, at the Westminster Abbey, if you choose, before God and before the nation, to whom you have in your delusion, let into a very awkward situation before the Courts of Berlin and Russia. I'll dwell more on this point iu my concluding section. Notwithstanding all this \"confes- sion\" on my part and that too made from the very city where the \"sins\" (?) were committed in 1880-81, and in the face of the very men who wanted to pose, with their guilty conscience as the friends and well-wishers of the \" Ires riche et tres aimable anglais\" when it suited their purpose to tap his purse, but who on another occasion frequently call him \" mauvais anglais\" \" excentrique anglais\" \" les voleurs des Indes\" \" a, bas les anglais,\" &c. &c; \u2014 notwithstanding, I repeat, all my honest endeavours to clear the situation, I found to my utter disgust that what I call the delusion anglais would not subside. On my return to London from Scotland, I found I was still stinking in the nose of my \" Time-is-money\" man. For many used to say when alluding to me that \" he has only come half round ; he will be all right in time ; still he keeps writing despatches and sending poison to the people of India.\" And I found some would use threatening or insulting language and preach it insinuatingly into my ears. On the evening 5f Thursday the 23rd October 1890 (my last night in London), with my breast loaded with chagrin and cursing my White Baby, Sir Mad -Hour and his Burmese prima donna, Madame McDuff, of Canadian Burma, for infecting the entire nation anglais with their -Illusions and setting it unnecessarily against me; \u2014 I could hardly enjoy the sights of the Empress Theatre. I could not do better than to return, though rather too early (11 o'clock) to"], [53, "37 my hotel. So I thought of spending a short hour I had at my disposal before retiring into my bed-room, to pen a letter to my brother-in-law, Mr. H. M. R. of 18, Chowringee Road, Calcutta ; and I called for pen and paper in the Salon de Lecture and began to pen my last letter from London to him. I expressed therein the great pain and anguish I had suffered from the hands of my \" greenhorns\" for magnifying me into an- other \"Dhuleep Singh,\" another \"Tippoo Saheb\" and a \" Fenian travelling overall Europe,\" viewing me magnified with their eyes decked with Ecole de M.decine goggles. I described to him how my greenhorns tried to chase me out of my ever-beloved land of the paradise of the living, i.e. Europe, especially its capital cities, not only Paris, Varsovie, Berlin and Petersburgh but from their own capital London, by their foolish and in- sensate tricks. While I was penning this my last London letter to my relative, I had to suffer very quietly the abusive epithets levelled against me, by some that looked like respect- able and well-bred Englishmen and their ladies, then present in the Salon de Lecture. With a view to prevent my writing long \"despatches\" and \" lectures,\" full of \" arsenic \" to my countrymen and relatives in India, they seemed to try hard to shake me, and to put me out of temper by calling out loudly \"Al ho! the drole is coming out very strong,\" \"Mad cap.\" \"That man is mad,\" \" Butler,\" \" Nigger,\" and I know not how many more such parliamentary epithets. I quietly let let chiens enrages bark as much as they pleased, and with a concentrated attention and collected mind, I drew up as fast as I could, a long letter of some 10 or 12 pages and retired into my room at about 30 minutes past 12 o'clock. My white Giant chases bis Red Rag out of Sia Giant London at last. Friday morning, Oct. 21fth. \u2014 This morning while descending the steps of the hotel, I had to hear the first compliment of \"bon voyage\" from the maids of the hotel saying to each other"], [54, "38 \" The madman is going to-day \" (!). On the breakfast table a few frowns and stares. Not one face to sympathize and to con sole the Poli-Comedie victim of delusion anglais, and a sufferer in health and peace of mind and purse too, by their insensate and childish persecution of him, not only on the Continent but in their own capital city\u2014 the Giant London. After break fast, I paid off my hotel bill,\u2014 and before leaving for the Char ing Cross Station, I employed my spare time in penning letters in the Reading Room to Mrs. Middleton of Leeds, to Mr. Charles Sims of Birmingham, and to my honest and gentlemanly faced aimable ami, Herr Hugo Fischer, the Lace Merchant of 85, Gosteno'i Dvor, Petersburgh, a German by birth, but living in Russia and a Russian subject since the last 20 years. While penning it, I used to notice or rather to read on the faces of the ladies and gentlemen, seated on the sofas opposite to me, that hatred and inward dislike of me, which I knew how to interpret, and for which I also know well, whom to blame and whom to hang. At a quarter to ten, a carriage was sent for and before entering therein, the Hall porter and the waiters of the Salles &c. began question ing me, whether I'll again be coming to London. \" Will you come again and when ? \" I replied, \" Why not ? Unless your countrymen in India pull my legs, there is nothing to prevent my coming back here and putting up in this very Hotel. \" The Railway porters at Charing Cross, directly they sighted me in their carriage-yard, worked up their facial angles of expression to a sort of joy and ease, at the sight of an un pleasant man, parting company. Although inwardly I was extremely depressed and moaning, I constantly kept before my eyes, the few but more sensible words of my good intelligent mother, conveyed in her last letter to me dated Sept l'.th, _nd which alone kept me buoyant. These alone and the pros pect of revisiting her, after all the merciless kicking I had, at the instigation and at the instance of my deluded White Giant, on the Continent, and even in the heart of his own native city"], [55, "39 and in his own 1st -class hotel, \u2014 kept me cheerful, and gave me sufficient courage and strength, while leaving my John Bull's great mart of the world, forcibly and against my will and inclinations. For it was my intention, after a quiet or rather a passive reception, I had from the people in Scotland and in Birmingham, to prolong my stay in London for some two or three months more. I thought of occupying myself, all this time, with my own pet idea of writing out and publishing a good smart book, containing my opinions on the manners and external life of the people, of the different cities of Europe I had visited. I can easily account for the quiet or passive reception I had in Scotland, by the fact, that my White Baby had taken good care, and wisely I believe, to put me in charge of an old influential Englishman and his lady, \u2014 who joined me from Hotel Balmoral, Edinburgh. Under the guidance of this gentleman and his madame, I was taken to Aberdeen, thence via Ballater to all round the Balmoral Castle Estate (where the Queen was then staying) and to Braemer, the Duke of Fife's estate. After a stay at Braemer for a couple of nights they brought me back to Aberdeen and then parted company. For the bait of posing as a Barnum's show, to be exhibited at Balmoral [I have no doubt such was my White Baby's in tention] and which was silently hinted as it were to me, I gave up my Killikrankie Pass route, which I was strongly advised to see by my teacher, Professor Bryant, of Guy's Hospital. I was just thinking, directly I left Birmingham to shift into some decent Chambre meublee, in a healthy and open part of London. Located in that city, with all its intellectual sur roundings, and with the aid of the splendid Library of the British Museum, free and open to everybody who applies for it, I could have easily sketched a nice little book, in the shape of Promenades in the cities of Europe. From my own poiut of view, I could have described the out-door life of the different peoples, I saw during my tour from Moscow to Birmingham ; and could have even shown how different it is"], [56, "40 from that of the various peoples of this country. I had to give up this pet idea, as well as many others I had pictured to myself, like writing out for the Parsee papers of Bombay, a graphic description of the Edinburgh Exhibition and the Forth Bridge, I had visited when in that city. With a resolution and firmness invariably my characteris tics,\u2014I determined to quit London that very morning, October 24, Friday, although the ticket issued to me by the Tourist Cook, was available for about 14 days from the date of issue. Before crossing the bar at the Charing Cross Station Platform, I had bought a copy of the society paper called Truth, which, especially its stories, I was generally fond of reading even in India. This, my f avourite paper too, my sobbing heart would not permit me to peruse with ease or pleasure. I recollect well how before I reached the Dover Pier, there was a free down pour of rain giving vent to my emotional feelings ; and after a little rain of that sort, I did s^ek distraction in the green fields and pastures, all along the line of the London, Chatham and Dover line of Railway. There was only one passenger with me, an old man, who, it seemed by the Baedeker's book in his hand, was bound for the Rhine. He too was with me on the Dover-Ostend boat, and on inquiry he told me he was going to Koln and that he had two sons in India, one at Saugor, Central Provinces, and another in Punjab. Before sighting Ostend, I had shut myself up in the smoking room of the boat, and there I again reconsidered my intention of doing Vienna and Miinchen, before going down to Genoa or Trieste for embarking. After some reflection, I came to the conclusion that in deference to the delusion of my White Baby, I must give up all my pet ideas of doing more of the cities of Europe, and be as quickly as possible \"out of sight,\" and \"out of mind,\" more for my own comfort and peace of mind than his own (vide Appendix No. 2). While nearing the landing pier at Ostend, I could distinctly read in the faces of the men, standing there, awaiting the arrival of the boat, an eagerness to see the"], [57, "4; \u2022 ,J,.o- .{.,.,\u25a0'.\u201e.-\u2022 rry the o Jhdi'an J-awm' that was being s\u00abit pfl to India hy my John Bidl in custody ; mart at A Sift* in special vaitUrt c//e,\u201e\u201e\u201e,/'e (on these lines of Railway ef Bwlgiiun and Holland i, h.,! which he had 1 sm-pei -I. mad- irrajigement.

Took my cafe cvmplet at the buffet, and heie"], [58, "42 I learned by inquiring from the garcon, that I could take a train to Frankfort-on-the-Maine. Departure 7-20, arrival time 8 o'clock, and after spending some 3 or 4 hours there, one can return in time for the express, leaving Mainz for Bale and Genoa, where the train will arrive on Sunday at 11 o'clock a.m. While I was asking the garcon, at the Mainz Station buffet, (a German, though he was speaking with me French very decently), about the hours of departure aud arrival of trains to Frankfort and back and of the express train to Italy, I observed a tall German well-to-do gentleman, coming up towards us, and telling the garcon something in his own language, which made him quit me immediately, and leave me alone to grope in the dark as it were with the German time tables, so very difficult for me to interpret. I soon twigged what the inten tion of this young allemand must have been ; that I should stick to Mainz for full 6 hours and not go to Frankfort. For, there was the probability of my missing the Italian Express and thus I might upset the arrangements, which may have been made by my \" Greenhorn,\" to convey me, a State prisoner in custody of his Ayence de surveillance to Genes. However, after this young man and the yarcon made themselve's scarce, I booked my baggage for Genoa by the Express leaving at about 1 o'clock p. m. and also booked for Frankfort by the 7-20 train. Frankfort-on-the-Maine. \u2014 I went to Frankfort-on-the Maine, the Manchester of Germany, and though small in its number of inhabitants and size compared to Berlin, it is the wealthiest city of Central Europe or the German Empire. I am told that the Exchange operations of the whole of Europe are conducted by the rich bankers of this young city. As I prefer describing this city and its sights elsewhere, I'll content myself by recommending here to, my countrymen desirous of visiting Europe, that in no city of Europe, not even in London or Manchester, can they expect to find every article of their personal European outfit, so cheap or d ban marche as in this"], [59, "43 city. All sorts and varieties of articles of clothing, woollen as well as cotton, leather Portmanteaux, boots, hats, umbrel las, &c, &c, I have found here, so dirt cheap, that I would invariably recommend my countrymen, fond of donning Cos tume Europe'en, to buy all their personal and travelling requi sites for Europe in this city, and nowhere else. The city is besides centrally situated and whence tours can be undertaken to its westward in France and Belgium, and to its eastward in Germany and Russia ; northwards to Norway, Denmark, and England, and to its southward to Vienna and Switzerland ; making it the headquarters or the starting point of the Indian Tourist in Europe. To our Indian Tourists, especially those who may be perfectly unacquainted with Europe, I would simply ask to note the addresses of some of the Maisons of Frankfort I had to deal with : \u2014 S. Heymann, 7 Neue Krame, for ready-made suits of clothing, pants, vests, pardessus, &c, or even made sur mesure or to order. For leather articles such as boots, portmanteaux, valises and other similar bags, I would recommend the manufactory of Jon. Wilh. Frank, 10, Grosse Sandgasse. For umbrellas, C. Sonnbom, 20, Weis zadlergasse. For shirts and collars, Frank and Baer, 37, Alter Markt. All these warehouses open into the Schiller Platz, and in this neighbourhood will be found shops and warehouses selling at prices which will defy competition even in the great mart of the world \u2014 London, or Paris or even Berlin. After making hastily a few purchases in the city, I returned after a petit dejeuner to the Railway Station. The glass roof of this spacious central station, (whence one can book for Berlin or Vienna or Russia) is in itself a sight. I still recall with pleasure, its splendidly fitted up clean lavatory rooms, the like of which I haven't seen or met with in my travels all over Europe, from Moscow to Birmingham. From Frankfort I returned in time to Mainz, to catch the Italian Express, departure 1 o'clock p.m. Towards evening a change of carriages was made at Bale and Customs' visite oi the"], [60, "44 baggage was gone through. Nothing very unusual occurred in the jouruey through the St. Gothard Tunnel, till Genoa was reached next morning at 11 o'clock. Arrival in Genoa, Sunday the 2Qth :\u2014 Early this morning, a change of carriages from the Swiss to the Italian railway was made at the frontier station. While nearing Genoa, the train passes through a mountainous country and by the side of a watercourse, where the scenery all round the Railway isenchanting. \" Hotel de Genes\" canvasser came forward with a request for his Hotel, and although I had preferred for reasons of convenience and central situation, a Hotel like the Hotel Angleterre or Hotel Milano, on the Via Balbi, I closed with his offer and left for that Hotel, situated in Place Carlo Felice. Here I took a grand bain for 2-50 fr and after my dejeuner d la fourchette left for the Norddeuts cher Lloyd Agent's office, and bought a ticket for a 2nd Kajiite from Genoa to Colombo for \u00a328 3s. (565 marks). I then called at Rubattino and Co. and there told the managing clerk my intention to quit by the German boat, and to give up my right for a free first class passage back to Bombay. Before the Table d'hote hour (\\ past 6 o'clock) I wrote a good long letter to Mrs. of Leeds, giving her a bit of my mind as to why I was obliged to quit London so soon, as four days immediately after my return from Scotland, and wil hout waiting there for her return to town, which she had promise! me, while biddingher au revoir at the Aberdeen Station. At she Table d'Hote a scene occurred. A couple of young Brazilian (?) girls were tutored, apparently by some malevolent Anglais, no doubt, to keep me threatened and crushed by \" going on with the cheese \" (tease). Both of them went into the parts assigned to them, with an amount of conceit and show which I am unable to describe, \u2014 alleging that although I then looked quiet and innocent as a dove, when my tura would come (\u00bb'. \u00ab. in Bombay) ,1 will spare nothing to poison my countrymen against les Anglais and to retaliate there, for all the kicks aud"], [61, "45 tortures I had to suffer in Europe from their hands. I allowed them their full go or rather their mad-go, till the last course was served ; and then pretending to talk with the garcon, I opened my volley of fire. I openly called the two j'oung girls \" negrillonnes, jaun&tres\" and compared them to the East Indians and coloured Eurasians chez-nous; and this had the desired effect of shutting them up and quieting their rage. \u00a9a b\u00a9ard tee s. @.

Left before 12 o'clock for the Rubattino office, to demand if any sum was due by me to them, for the conveyance of the box for- warded to them from Berlin, through the agency of Brasch and Rothenstein, General Carriers, 28 Friedrich-Strasse. Berlin, W. Sent a telegram to Ma saying \"Sailed German Lloyd, landing Colombo.\" I then left for the dock, where my Hotel Commissaire was waiting with my baggage. Took a small jolly-boat and went over before 1 o'clock to the steamship Sachsen ; saw the first or chief steward and demanded after handing him my ticket, cabin accommodation. I was informed \"No room, ship all full\" (?). The second steward said perhaps I'll be accommodated in his cabin, on one of the spare berths. Had to promenade for some time on the upper deck, round about the first-class smoking saloon and deck. The chief steward was repeatedly applied to for a berth and I was told by him to wait ; he recommending me at the same time to go to Genoa and spend my day on shore, as the boat was not likely to weigh anchor till 6 o'clock to-night, I declined to do so and preferred remaining on board, taking some gustation to sustain"], [62, "46 me. Towards evening the Crown Prince of Norway with bil Princess and a large staff, with a number of attendants, u I many other passengers came on board ; and everywhere on the boat there was a bustle and movement. One of tin Rubattino boats was lying in the harbour vis-d-vis to our boat. I was constantly watching the faces of a few of the Italian Company's Ship's Officers, who while staring at me seemed to feel the humiliation of the silent kick given by me, to their company, by declining to avail myself of my right tot a free first class passage on board their boat. They seemed to understand, I believe, why I should have preferred to pay my own passage back, and that too, on the boat of a nation iu hand and glove with les Anglais and in a second class cabin. 1 wish they had twigged (and of which I have no doubt), the actual cause of my running into an expenditure of \u00a328 8s., my second class fare from Genoa to Colombo, plus the cost of wine and of passage to Bombay from Ceylon. Nord- Deutscher Lloyd German Mail and Passenger Service in the East : \u2014 All the German Lloyd boats are said to be fitted up as bateaux de luxe and this one too, I found replete with even comfort to passengers. Even my 2nd class accommodation was surpassing in comfort, cleanliness and convenience to what I found in my previous two voyages, by the P. & 0. (S.S, Travancore and Alongolia), \u2014 the two voyages by the M. M. (S.S. A nadyr and Ava), and the last one by the Rubattino boat (S. S. Singapore). In speed also, these German boats are very fast, making easily on an average, notwithstanding headwinds and contrary currents, from 12| to 14 knots or sea miles in an hour. A company which provides to the travelling public very fast boats, like the Cunard and other Atlantic liners and fin - nishes it with an accommodation and comfort on a level with the 1st class hotels of the capital cities of Europe, aud makes their boats regular floating hotels, would never condescend to offer to their customers, the bait of a free allowance of wine in the shape of une bouteille de vin ordinaire d chaque repas, as,"], [63, "47 is the case with the boats of the Latin races, \u2014 the Italian and French Mail Services and some other lines of passenger service. I look upon this sort of bait in the same light, as the Palais Royal Restaurant Diners et DejeAners, pour un franc cinquante on deux francs, and would much prefer to have a choice of my own wine, and to pay for it, and at the same time be able to enjoy the comforts of clean bed sheets, clean baths and 000 rooms ; more frequent and substantial food, airy cabins, and long spacious decks for promenade, with a Band playing thrice a day, to enable one to se distraire, and all the ships' cabins and saloons lighted by electric light ; and its corridors lit all throughout the night. At five o'clock the agent of the Company at Genoa came on board, and on my appljdng to him, he too said there was hardlv room for me, \" All berths taken up.\" So I was in a fix, for my \"metallic force \" was not sufficient to enable me to change my ticket for a 1st Class berth. I apprehended all this excuse of \" no room,\" and \" all berths taken up,\" arose from an un willingness on the part of the ship people to take me onboard. I now recalled forcibly the language of two Englishmen, one in London and the other, on board the paquebot Princesse Henriette (Dover -Ostende line), \u2014 both of whom I had heard questing \"What boat will take him back to India?\" And when the Agent told me to spend a month more in Genoa and wait there for another Lloyd boat, alleging * ' Genoa is a nice place,\" I said, \" I'll be going via Trieste or Brindisi, and would thank him to return me my passage money.\" He kept quiet and walked off. Chauffer le Monsieur commences :\u2014 In the evening a short time before weighing anchor, when I was standing on the upper deck (2nd class), near the railings and the same gentleman passed by me, I avoided to notice him, or to apply to him for a berth. For I apprehended from the temper and behaviour of some of the passengers, on board at the time, that the matter might assume an ugly shape and so"], [64, "48 behaved with tact and guarded silence. Shortly before the anchor was weighed, the pilot came on board, to take the ship out, and at this time an abdominal typed passenger, speaking German and English a little, and of whose exact nationality I have some doubt, whether Allemand or Hollandais, \u2014 began to stare very hard upon me with an angry look, and began to eall me sou, drole, madcap, &c. And I soon twigged that my \" patron \" or \" maitre,\" as the French used to call my White Baby, must have telegraphed permission from London, to take the \"nice precious thing\" on board and hence it was, that the abdominal type man could not keep his rage down and gave vent to it, directly he came to know that I was to be one of his fellow-passengers. The dinner was served at 7 o'clock. Everything seemed dirange. I was accommodated with a seat (extemporised as it were for me) in the smoking saloon, with a lot of what I took for British roughs and working- class men.* Two of these began to talk with me with an affected familiar or free tone ; and one of them, the short statured, middle-aged spare-bodied man, wanted to pose before me, as a Scotland Yard man. This man began to question me directly the soup was served. \" Where I came from ? Where I was going to? What parts of Europe I had travelled in and how long a stay I had made there ?.\" I cut this inquisitive man off, by saying to him that I am not supposed to carry the history of my tour on my forehead, for his or other people's edification. This sort of curt reply did shut him up, and I cared very little for all the offensive terms, he and his neigh- bours then indulged in, some of whom were speaking la langue allemande. While dining in the smoking saloon, I had dis tinctly observed three or four passengers, from the 1st class deck going past behind me, and exchanging signs or gestures with the short-statured spare bodied old man and his neighbours. Immediately after the dinner was over, I left the smoking-room * N- B\u2014 Were all these men really 2nd class passengers or came from tbe 3rd to help the \" Chauffer qu-elqu'un\" process ?"], [65, "V) and after a few minutes promenade took my seat on a bench on the upper deck. It was nearly Kj o'clock and as yet no . berth allotted to me. I oould not help but curse the tUlunivn anglais, which still wauted to harass me. fancying perhaps that his hand was unseen by me, so fai'f rum his immctt, Without a berth to Lit in and with my baggage and over- :oats still lying here and there, in front of the second steward's rabin, I could neither change my rlothes nor try to lie down anywhere, exhausted as I was after all the morning's \u00aberk In Genoa, and promenades on the deck since one o'clock. Pur I found that day not a single chair available for me to lie and to rest in. I knew that delay to provide me with sleeping acoommodation was actually intended more to draw me out. to pot me out of temper, to shake me passively or silently as it w---rt . And 1 oould not h*lp but give a corresponding repons* to my White Baby's friends and agents, by patiently with fetAilding all such, aud many other efforts to annoy aud to embarrass '' au unpleasant man \" and a solitary traveller. H was nearly nine o'clock and I believe 1 even went into a drowsy sleep on the bench, where I had taken my seat. See ing me fall asleep, the 1st steward called me down and showed mt a berth in a iiitjt class cabin ou the spar deck, vii-d-rts tiit captain's own cabin, and which had also a skylight opening on tl.e promenade deck. Here there were three attendants of ths Crown Prince of Norway, and I was only allowed to cany there with me, my Gladstone bag and two of my hand-bags, and was (old to leave my small box of portmauteau out. This alter a little coaxing, I induced the 2ud steward to allow me to pnt in the cabin. The three servants of the Crown Prince, I am glad to say, did behave with me as neutrals, and one of them who understood and spoke a little English, would help me at time; with his razor or other things of that sort. October ii\\(h. 2'Jt/i, 30fA, 31sr were spent lu the Mediterra nean. \u2014 Port Said was sighted at 10 o'clock on the 1st of November, aud our boat dropped anchor opposite to Nord-deut- 4"], [66, "50 scher Lloyd Agency Office, exactly at 12 o'clock noon. The Turkish Man-of-war, as our ship passed her, saluted the German Emperor's flag, as well as the Crown Prince with minute guns. As I have kept no regular diary from the time I left Paris for London, I cannot give here a narrative of all events, which passed seratim from day to day, so I'll content myself by indi cating, as briefly as possible the history of my tour, on what I call Chcmin-de-fer-fiottant of Kaiser Wilhelm II. divided into groups or sections from Genoa to Port Said, Port Said to Aden, and Aden to Colombo. Before I begin to narrate the personal history of my tour on board the ship, I should like to record here, what seemed to me at the time, like manifestations of amour-propre, on the part of the two leading nations of modern Europe. Although two full decades have passed since they were at each other's throats, still the hatred, dislike or to call it in more milder terms jealousy, ever since then endangered, between the indi vidual members, representing each of these two nations, has not yet subsided. It was on Sunday evening (November 2nd) at about 6 o'clock that a Messageries boat (French China Mail) passed our boat, then lying in her mooring at Port Said, on her way up the Mediterranean, her band playing the national French tune of La Marseillaise. The German crew and others on the fore-deck and forecastle, at the time, gave an immediate reponse, to the patriotic hymn of the Francais, by singing there and then, with a perfect military ring, their own favourite song \"Watch on the Rhine \" (in their own Deutsch language). I watched this incident with great pleasure, and after the Messageries boat had passed ours, I felt within myself the truth of the opinion, that it is nations who fight and not their rulers. Let the kings and the royalty of the different nations of Europe, exchange howsoever they like, among themselves, the ordinary rules of civility and stand to each other on terms of perfect cordiality and friendship, or even domestic ties, the declaration of war or the maintenance of peace between the"], [67, "51 nations they rule, does not rest with them, but with the nations themselves. The rulers of a nation, and its leaders, have only to obey the nation's will and be guided by it. In the Mediterranean . \u2014 The very night of the day the boat left Genoa harbour, and when I was lounging on a bench on the deck, I heard a passenger (speaking Queen's English with pure accent Anglais) seated opposite to me (though in the dark) and loudly calling me out \" My madman be free, be free and easy : talk ! ; talk ! ! \" I pretended going into sleep, and it was at this very time, that the 2nd steward took me down below and showed me my berth. I retired to bed before ten o'clock. Next morning (October 28th) directly I was on the deck the \" Hungarian Waltzes \" began. At about 10 o'clock (after breakfast) while I was reading an amusing little book called \" Two Englishmen, by an American,\" the music of what I eall the \" article dc Paris \" or the \" sou trick \" assumed a very serious aspect. A German 3rd class passenger came up to within 10 yards of me and pointing me out by his hand used to cry out loudly, \" That man is mad, he is a mad-cap ; a drole, etc.\" I guarded very cautiously my sang-froid, and not seeming at all to notice him I continued perusing my interesting book. 1 knew that this man, who had never before seen me in his lifetime, never had seen in me any signs of mad or drole aetion, and whom it was the very first iime in my life I had sighted, \u2014 I say this man (a 3rd class passenger) must have been specially tutored to tap, as it were, at my wrong end or sensitive point, and to draw me out into a regular duel of words with him. I knew that he dare not assault me or seize me by my throat. Even if anything of that sort had unfortunately happened, 1 was prepared to withstand and to suffer it with fortitude, patience, and resignation. For my sole object was to find my way back to India, now that I was on board a ship. This is my 6th voyage on board a ship to and from Europe, and perhaps the 20th time that I was in the sea ; and I am so well acquainted with the internal econo- mies of a ship, that I knew the least resort to retaliation on my"], [68, "52 part, would recoil on moi-metne, with the crushing force of the whole unsympathetic multitude present on board the ship. I kept secretly praying to Almighty God to put some better sense, some mercy for me, \u2014 a solitary unprotected traveller, in the callous and deluded heart of my persecutor the White Giant, and I was rewarded by my \" take no notice \" sort of demeanour. I found that this German workman or missionary, I know not, went back tired and uon-plussed. About half an hour later on there came on our 2nd deck a German woman, who was pointed to me as a cocotte by a German passenger, Mr. Th. Collmam, of Berlin, and who he told me was going to Calcutta ; and she did land at Colombo, where I saw her walking on Monday morning, after the boat had left for Singapore. This 3rd class passenger, femme legere, came on the 2nd deck and took her stand on the same spot, where the workman or catechist had taken his place half an hour previous ; and pointing her finger to me, repeated loudly and frequently the \" Hungarian \" or angry Valses with more of pathos and gesticulation. She too found me, that I was too well-bred and too much of a knowing man to condescend to notice such chiffoniers, like which she appeared to me (until Mr. Th. Collmam had disclosed to me her charac ter), and she too left discomfited. I continued to occupy the same chair, at the same place on the 2nd class deck. While all this sort of game was going on, I quietly observed, that the eyes of the entire passengers, on the 1st class deck at the aft, and among whom were the Crown Prince of Norway and his staff, were unceasingly directed towards me. This very moment, I suspected, that there is some sort of wire pulling, some kind of tutoring going on, and that too from the 1st class deck by some one or more Anglais. And I was bent upon spotting the man, who I am sure was the ringleader in all this mischief, to keep me threatened and crushed, as he might have fancied, so that when I reached India and my turn came, I would no more dare to allude to this blunder of my White Baby, and which I am sure made him lose his nose before the"], [69, "53 courts of Berlin and Russia. I did succeed in spotting the man out, but it was only after passing the Suez Canal and the Red Sea. He was a 1st class English passenger, whom I have often referred to in my letters to my friends, as the paddy nosed Anglais, and who crossed with me to India from Ceylon on the S. M. Railway, where he separated from me at a Junc tion Station. I found him speaking the Madras vernacular at Tuticorin, and somewhat familiar with native and English officers on the line. More about him hereafter. The Poli-comedians on board the ship identified. \u2014 Once for all, I may here mention that what I call after the Russians and others, \" the Hungarian Waltz \" was daily, morning, noon, evening and even at nights, being constantly played into my ears, by more than half a dozen 2nd class passengers, English speaking, of both sexes, and also by about half a dozen Deutsch passengers. At times, with energy and without interruption! these angry waltzes were played by the men and women seated opposite to me, and also to my right and left in the dining saloon, at the breakfast or at tea or at dinner-time especially. What the French used to call the \"chauffage\" was almost every evening attempted on the dinner-table, directly I was observed to have partaken of some wine, and also during my nightly promenades on the deck. Prominent among the chauffeurs were a spectacled Hollandais, an abdominal type Alle mand seated fourth to my right on the dining table, a couple of young German lads, a \"Johnson \" or \" Johnstone, \" who with a policeman's glove on one hand would affect to intimidate and browbeat me everywhere on the ship by his presence, and that too at times with a threatening stare at me. There were also in my White Baby's corps de chauffeurs, more than half a dozen British workmen. For they looked like uneducated men, without manners or head sufficient to occupy their time in reading or writing, and whose mode of talk and accentuation of English words, left no doubt in my mind, that they were not of the type of the well-bred English gentlemen. There were also women"], [70, "54 of the same sort, all taking pleasure in helping the White Giant iu his chase for th. Black Bug. Their method of working, and the Tourists role in the poli comedie. \u2014 I had often observed the 2nd steward andothor wait en of the dining saloon, coming in and transmitting a signal, -is it were, to the 2nd class passengers, and at times openly telling them \" to go on with the cheese,\" and my White Baby's music commences from all sides, mostly from the quarter of tin opposite sex, all of whom were speaking true Queen's English. I had often slyly seen my table boy Auguste, standing behind my chair. *fco. 5 on the dining table, and watching my face and directing with his hands, the people seated on the opposite table, to go on with the insulting names, to run me down, \" to keep me threatened and crushed,\" and to make me miserable aud depressed, \u2014 so that I may lose my appetite aud force, and die as it were by I inches. Directly assured myself of this sort of game, I would work up the muscles of expressions of my face, in a way to indicate to those who watched it, intense pain and mental torture. This had the desired effect of draw ing out the agents of my Greenhorn of a White Baby. I had only to assure them thus of success, in their foolish game of chauffage, and they (especially the passengers Anglais, male and female seated on the table opposite facing me,) would go on with their angry valses, with a laughter and self -elation, which can better be imagined than described. At times, I would work up my facial angles, so as to express the feeling of nonchalance and even joy, and at times would even grin or laugh, while the Hungarian Valse was being sung. At times I would show off , as if I was loving or en tete-d-tete with Made- moiselles \"Maggie\" and \" Melini,\" of the Cafe Americaine and the Moulin Rouge of Paris, or show myself off, especially while promenading on the deck, say after a glass of beer before dinner time or after partaking a quarter of a flask of Rheingold, as if I' was, at the time of their chauffer le cerveau action recently fiance with M'Ue. Gabrielle, the only very handsome"], [71, "55 sille of Madame Bureau, in whose house I was a lodger in London in 1879. To cany the ruse to its fullest possible ex tent, I would at times in my cabin, directly the old \" John stone,\" my garde malade, would come in and before he falls into sleep, I would cry out (as if I was speaking while dreaming) \"Oh! Gabrielle, pardon me; I pardon thee \" ! I knew well I was the victim of delusion Anglais, and in my role of a victim in the poli-comedie plot, I had to play my part very adroitly. And I am glad to assure my readers, as well as my frank and honest \" Time-is-money \" man, that in the role assigned to me by my White Baby, Sir Mad Hour and his Burmese Prima Donna Madame McDuff, I played my part to the best of my ability, uot only on board the Postdampfer Sachsen, but in Paris and also in London too. At Berlin I was somewhat of an inefficient actor, as I was not then sufficiently initiated by my theatrical professors Mesdemoiselles Dreyfous, Ball, Pinet, Fort and Dieulaf oy, into the secrets of what are called les ficelles d'un aeteur. In fact the lessons given to me in 1881, by these very clever artistes attachis d I' Opera of the Quartier Latin Quarter, I had almost forgotten this time. And it was not until their prima donna Mademoiselle Anger helped me, on entering Paris, to revise their excellent lessons, that I came to know how to play my role of the victim to the poli-comedie Anglais. For her very valuable lessons Mdlle. Anger gave me. for about a week or more in Paris, I had to pay her only a trifling sum of 5 frs. par jour. Out of this, she pauvre femme had to pay her tram fare from Passy to my hotel, 5, Rue de Beaune, and also trois francs cinquante for her dinner, which she used to take with me, at the Table d'hote there. Tourist's Ficelles du metier. \u2014 I must leave the description of my role as poli-comedie victim in Paris and other towns of England and Scotland up to Genoa, to my narrative of tours in Europe (to be published hereafter very shortly). I'll content myself with giving here, a brief description of how I kept the whole ship, waltzing admirably to the tune of the Hungarian"], [72, "56 Valses, by employing one of my own ficelles du metier, and which I had so successfully employed iu Paris, in tickling my Professor Francais of maladies menlales and all his followers and adherents in that city. I first wrote on the 31st October my poli-comedie song on a carte- blanche, to my friend Surgeon H. D. Pesikaka, of Hornby Row, Bombay, while nearing Port Said. I said to him, \" The Barnum show is finished and the Chimpanzee is no more to be exhibited and everything must in the natural course of things return to their normal aspect\" (vide Appendix No. 3). This was followed by another dated November 1st to another friend of mine also in Bombay. I said therein \" After all, my White Baby has not found the Barnum show a profitable concern. He had made a good capital of it in central Europe, but in Russia the show was a total failure. In Paris the wasp was squeezed sufficiently in 1881, \u2014 when he gave in turn a good sting there. My White Baby's agent, residing in Downing Street, London, had the show 6ent to the Caledonian Castle, but as the Chimpanzee was not provided with a regular court dress, he could not be presented, and the lady in charge was heard to say, in the exit door of the Aberdeen Station, that \"They have given him up.\" What a malheur for my poor monkey, who is now sent back or rather comes back, with C\u00e6sar's motto \"Veni, Vidi, Vici\" on his chapeau\" (vide Appendix No. 4). The contents of these two cards, despatched one in the morning and the other a day before, became a common talk with some of the passengers before nightfall. One Allemand warned a female passenger, who was talking with me, after dinner on the deck at Port Said (Nov. 1st), and scared her away from me, by alluding to the above karten. I soon twigged the game and wrote next morning, two or three long despatches, one again to my friend Surgeon Pesikaka, to Dr. Jumnadass, and another to Calcutta. Some of these were posted in the Egyptian Post Office Port Said, and some on the Bateau (all these will be found in the Appendix marked Nos."], [73, "57 5,8, and 16). I invariably found that no sooner was a lecture or a karten despatched and in a couple of hours' time I could read the contents thereof, on the faces of many of the passengers, whom I took good care to mention or indicate in my despatches. I knew that with my \" Greenhorn,\" I was a suspected man, and the White Giant in his political delusion would not scruple to do any dirty act, which he imagined might give him a clue to read me from my inside, or as he often expressed it in his slang \" to read the book.\" I was morally satisfied that this sort of dirty game was going on, with all my despatches and lectures, written from Paris, where I had to stay the whole month of September. In order to give the poli-comedie actors in that city, (where the religious tenet of many is \" Rien apres la mort\") every facility to indulge in their delusion, I used to hand personally almost all my heavy and important despatches to the clerk, at the Bureau de Chargement, paying for them the trifling regis- tration fee, at the rate of 5 sous or 25 cents per cover. Not that I feared misoarriage of my despatches. I was quite sure they would reach their destination, unless somebody like my friend the Doctor of Norfolk Crescent, had the audacity to assert, that no letters of mine from Paris did ever reach him in London. My object in getting my curtain lectures registered in Paris, was to direct the attention of my poli-comedians to the fact, that Voild, mon gateau de riz ; et avahz tous ce qui est dedans ; just subject it to some steam -bath process if you wish ; try to understand my lecture to you and learn therefrom what I think of you, \u2014 you Ecole de Medecine men of guilty con- science, and what I think of your ways and means of judging me, and then to pousser moi jusqu'au la mort et mettre moi d misere, simply to pose before my greenhorn and simpleton your neighbour, as his sincere and amiable friend. I was morally satisfied that this sort of dirty work was going on in Paris, where every evening, I used to read the contents of my regis- tered, but for evident reasons unsealed despatches, on the face and in the eyes of many a Parisian, both on the boulevards,"], [74, "58 in the cafes and many of the theatres, like the Grand Opera. The same sort of game, I rightly suspected was being carried on, by my greenhorn in his maison commercialc et indue trieUt. Personally, being a suspected man and a victim of political delusion, I had not the least objection to my White Giant try. ino- to peep into my inside in this manner, \u2014 perhaps peculiarly his own. But there was a way to do it, with great circum spection and discretion, and above all strict secrecy. That these he entirely wanted, was evident to me, both chez lui, and as well as after I was out of his maison. It was, there fore, no surprise to me to find the same Jeux de I'enfance repeated in a German floating town I was in. I had taken good care to cover my opinions of my John Bull, and his sensitive points or wrong ends, with comic sketches and love songs, in order to humour my greenhorn's bureau de surveillance, which was actually (as I will hereafter show) maintained on board the ship also, I know not at what cost, and who is to pay for it. But the Secret Service Budget of India, I am sure, will have to fork out all that sum. As a specimen of a humorous sketch I used to give in my long, long letters, ostensibly addressed to my friends in India, but secretly intended for my greenhorns, the Poli-comedie actors, I would quote the following description of a ball given on board the ship by Captain Von Gossel to the 2nd class passengers on the 2nd deck, from letters addressed to friends in Bombay (printed in the Appendix, vide Nos. 11 and 12) : \u2014 \" I now treat you to another humorous sketch. It is of a ball \" Captain Cyrus enjoyed the night before last on board the \" ship \"Germania.\" He has made an entry of it in his diary, \" and by his permission I copy herein a few extracts for your \"amusement and pleasure There were about a dozen \" dames and double the number of cavaliers. It was some \" thing like \" Bal au Flambeau \" which, Captain Cyrus says, \u2022'he has seen so often iu Paris Among the ladies present \" were three or four from the 1st Kajiite (1st class) but not all."], [75, "59 \" For as chez nous, with these people too, there is caste and rank \" in society. A nobleman and a gentleman will not mix with a \" foundling and a polisson, and if an unfortunate gentle - \" man like your Captain Cyrus, has the misfortune to be out of \" pocket and prefer to travel 2nd class, still he is looked upon \"as a gentleman and an officer. The words 'Egalite,' \"' Fraternite,' and 'Vaterland' have only their force and '\u25a0 meaning, when a nation has to fight or to defend, when every \" nobleman and peasant is supposed to stand shoulder to \" shoulder and to fight for his country. Well, the ball again. \" It was opened by Madame La Grand'Mere, matched to the \"ship's chief engineer. Among the prominent dancers was a \" .Mrs. Blue Cabbage \u2014 for, she wore a Blue Gown and had a face \" as rotund as a Cabbage ball, and from which were displayed \" ugly teeth, covered with sordes and which were so hygieni \" cally uncared for, that they stood in marked comparison \" with the pearly white teeth of three or four dames Anglaises '\u2022 and Allemandes in the 1st class. How she danced and with \" whom, was carefully observed and noted by my Captain \" Cyrus. For, he has set this remark opposite to Madame Blue \" Cabbage's name, \" Dancer, heavy and rough.\" There was une \" Anglaise, jeitne et belle, matched to an Anglais, \u2014 for the birds \" of the same feather always flock together, and although she \" was dancing splendidly and as gracefully as it is possible to \" do on a rolling ship's deck,\u2014 she, poor creature, seemed to be \" suffering from some chagrin.

Writing to another friend on the following day the Tourist wrote : \u2014 \" Tell my Australian pet, that in my letter (which ask him to \" give you to read), dated yesterday, my description of the ship \" Germania ball was incomplete, as the wretched ganjon would \" every time I write, come up to spread the table.

Every picture one sees, he can \" not purchase and so the matter ends.\" No sooner were these sketches despatched and within some two or three hours, I could read the contents thereof, on the faces of the passengers I had mentioned therein. Mrs. Old Shoe felt snubbed and would no longer, taking her chair close to me and pretending to play with her child, pour into my ears, \" C'est le drole, n'est ce pas ? drole, n'est ce pas ?\" &c, and I also heard next morning, another female passenger telling Mrs. Old Shoe in my presence : \u2014 \" You have now squared your account with him.\" The fat and short Monsieur (Allemand ou Hollandais, I know not), directly he sighted me, began to stare me full in the face, with eyes glittering with anger and revenge, for naming him \" General Tom Thumb, dancing thump! thump!! thump !!! \" The Mrs. Blue Cabbage would no more venture to look at me or to allude to me, while at the dinner-table ; and next morning, I was glad to observe she had paid greater attention to the hygiene of her teeth, and would try her best to conceal them under her upper lip, and also not to open too widely her eyes, as to expose the whites of her eyes all round the corner. The sille of an old Hollan dais, going to Batavia, and who would often exchange compli ments with me every morning, or at times in the evenings"], [78, "62 also, in French \u2014 \" Bonjour Monsieur\" or \" Bonsoir Monsieur,\" detested me with a hatred intensely peculiar to her sex. Ami why? Because I had described her in my description of the ball as \" the Batavian Chimpanzee, jumping rather than dancing in the arms of her cavalier.\" Madame La Grand'Mnv (aD these are English-speaking female passengers of tlie 2nd class, and dining in the same saloon with me, every day on the table opposite to me) felt herself complimented, and in return sol m\\ flatteringly calling her \"La Grand'mcre\" she showed mo the good grace of no longer torturing me, as she used to do, before this \" despatch\" was sent to India. But the most amusing effect, I observed my curtain lecture to my femme anglaise produced, was to draw out a jeune el belle anglaise. I had paid her the highest compliment I could, \u2014 though I knew well she did not deserve it, \u2014 in my description of the ball of Wednesday the 5th inst, and I was much amused to find, how I succeeded in drawing her out. Ever since that, she made it a point to keep herself before my eyes constantly. At times playing with her maid companion, ut times coming all the way from the first deck, to promenade on our second deck, and going past me, several times. At times bringing her chair, from tbe first deck to the second and sitting under the bridge, with light clothes on and her back turned to the windward side, \u2014 when a fierce, cold headwind was blowing from the south of the Red Sea, enough to give one lumbago. In short, she used to move and show herself after breakfast, at noon, or in the evenings, and at times during the nightly band hours (9i \u2014 10| o'clock), in away to keep herself constantly be fore the snake-charmer's eyes. And Why? Because. I flattered her in my sketch of the ball, that she was the only person on board the ship, whose face recalled me my London life, London theatres, London sights, the finite -a -manger and the Salon de Lecture of the London Grand Hotel I was in, and the lovely and handsome faces of les anglaises, in whose presence I was moving there. She, along with others on board, mtu"], [79, "63 have thought, that the only way to bring me round to English tastes, to English life and manners, and to scrape off my French veneer, was to keep herself before me constantly, so that I may penser toitjours de Londres et sa monde. And I, too, on my part, sustained extremely well, my role of a poli-comedie victim to delusion anglais, by returning her glances and behaving in a way, so as to impress the many on the ship (who were con stantly watching my movements), that I took a great pleasure to see my belle et j e ane but frank and innocent anglaise, and to be seen by her in return. Most of my letters are so interspersed with French words and expressions, as it is invariable with me, \u2014 that I remember very well Mrs. M of Leeds, whom my White Baby had dis creetly assigned the role of acting as my guide, philosopher, and friend in my tour in Scotland, more than once alluding to me, as \" Madame Sarah Bernhardt ;\" and I was not surprised, if some sentences in many of my letters should have given to my poli-comedie actors on board the German boat, the idea that I had a regular French veneer ingrained into me, and which naturally led me to pose as an \" Anti-Anglais\" in manners, tastes, thoughts, and action, and that every means should now be tried, to hart me from my leanings or love for French cuisine, French wine, French theatres, and French books, and also French society. I knew how in Germany a traveller is not encouraged to talk French, and he is given to understand that he should speak it as little as possible, especially if he knew English or even Deutsch very imperfectly. I had often observed what a silent irritation or dislike, I used to get up for a few evenings, that I was reading a French book, on a French comedie (Le Demi-Monde, by Alexandre Dumas Junior). I had seen this comedie played in Paris (in September) at the Comedie Francaise. Perusal of this opera now used to recall to my mind, the splendid acting of that first theatre of Europe and all its tres joli et tres chic surroundings. For my mind was full of chagrin, owing to the constant irritation and annoyance, I"], [80, "64 was subjected to by my poli-comedie actors, even on board the vessel after it had traversed the eastern side of the Suez Canal and entered the Indian Ocean. It was only by feeding every now and then upon my past recollections of past pleasures, that I was able to se distraire, and to soothe my irritated brain and to give it the requisite freshness aud elasticity, while moving and living in the midst of an unsym pathetic multitude on board the ship. I must end now my reference to this handsome anglaise passenger (bound for Singapore) by thanking her once more,\u2014 for I have already tendered her my best thanks in one of my letters to my friend, \u2014 for a couple of very clever hints she gave me to quit the Fancy Dress Ball, on the 12th November evening which took place on the 1st Kajiite deck, and to which passen- gers of the 2nd Kajiite were also invited by the ship's comman- der, Captain Von Gossel. Before entering into what I call the Fancy Dress Ball incident, I must narrate here other facts and incidents, which go a great way to explain the trap prepared for me on that occasion. I hope the conception of this trap was not dictated by vindictive thoughts, suggested by my comical criticisms of the ball to the 2nd Class on the night of 5th November. Most likely this new trap or a secretly conceived shake, to be given to me after the last dance, was due to a severe castigation, I had inflicted on my White Baby in my curtain lectures and also to the bitter readings given to his agents on board ( Vide Appendix Nos. 5, 9, 10, 16 and 17). The stage- tricks of my poli-comedie actors exposed. \u2014 A day or two previous to the Fancy Ball, I had drawn out a paddy nosed anglais, 'a Monsieur Irlandais of Gustbruck Hill, \u2014 passenger of the 1st class, \u2014 upon whom my suspicions rested ever since we passed the Suez Canal, as the ringleader of all the mischief and irritation on board the ship. I have referred to him in my letters, as the Chef of the bureau de surveillance, established by my White Baby of ministere des affaires etrangeres on board the ship, to watch me and \" to keep me threatened and"], [81, "65 crushed,\" until I land in India. For he feared that I might create a sensation against him, by exposing (and which I am quite justified in doing) his foolish, childish and insensate treatment of me, to my countrymen in Bombay. I am sure it was apprehended that I might expose to the educated India, what are the \" wrong ends \" or \" sensitive points \" of my White Baby, \u2014 whose countrymen have at a great sacrifice of blood and treasure, opened another great mart, for his wares manufactured at Manchester, Lancashire and Sheffield, and have after a century's hard struggle enabled him to pose as \" L' Empereur des Indous \" on the political platform of Europe. It may be through this sort of absurd fear, or it may be the consciousness of guilt, in mercilessly pushing to misere et mort, a Native of India, a Bombay Parsee, \u2014 an unprotected and a solitary traveller, \u2014 \" a little game not worth killing \" (as an American justly remarked in Paris, the very first morning he sighted me, September 3rd), which led to his taking some steps for ticketing me, an unpleasant man. For he seemed to have fancied, that such a step would hush up, once for all and for ever, all this \" il a fume sa pipe et il etait bien expose\" affair, from a country and a people who know very little of him, beyond that he is a white man sent by God to rule over them. And what were these measures, adopted by my White Baby, Sir Mad Hour, to keep me ever threatened and crushed. Threatened by pretending to guard me, even on board the ship, under his own police d' espionage, by openly marking me down as if I was a cotton bale, and could easily be marked by such stupid epithets or trade-marks, as a drole, sou, madcap, folle, fosse, &c, while moving among a people who had never before seen me, or knew me, and whose appointed role was to set me down on the shores of India in a perfectly mou state, and bordering on what they called in Paris \" il va mourir \" state. In short, to land me in this country, perfectly threa tened and crushed, paralyzed in mind, if not in body. With this object in view, an old man with an affected pose 5"], [82, "66 of a Scotland yard man, whom I have already referred to in my letter to Mrs. M of Leeds as \" Cognac Johnstone,\" and about whom I have already made a reference in my note of embarkation from Genoa, was told off to watch me in my sleeping-berth in the cabin. His constant presence, my White Baby imagined, might keep me ever intimidated, like a person suffering from \" delire de persecution par le police anglais,\" and which sort of absurd idea,' a Greek Doctor in Paris, at my Hotel, 5, Rue de Beaune, wanted to hammer into my brain. I had often observed this man enter the cabin, by day or by night, directly I went in. He would often keep himself before my eyes on the landing or on the deck. At times I have seen him pegging with full 4 ozs. of raw Cognac, the very first thing he was fond of directly he got up. For he always kept a bottle of Hambourg Cognac in his valise by his bedside. I had once objected at Suez to be in the same two-berth cabin with him, after leaving Port Said, on account of his insulting behaviour with me, and his insulting language the very first day he joined me in one cabin, as a fellow -lodger. But my poli-comedie actors were so strong on board this foreign ship too, that they would not allow the ship people to separate this man from me, as I expected them to do, when they shifted me from berth No. 31 to another five-berth cabin, and gave me No. 36. I was, however, content, that though this man, \u2014 representative of my White Baby's temporarily organised Scotland yard on board the ship again lodged with me in the same five-berth cabin, there was another Hollandais passenger, whom the ship people had the good sense to lodge with us and of whom I have said in my letter, dated 6th November 18!)0, as quite an innocent lad (vide Appendix No. 10). Another young man, half-AUemand and half-Anglais in mode, manners, speech and thought, with the pose of a man of science and a gentilhomme, was told off to keep my company on deck and in the dining-saloon. He was indeed a well-read man, talked of Charcot of Paris, and even mentioned the names"], [83, "67 of some of his aides and agreges, and all the while pretending that he was not a medical man. He showed a strong leaning towards tous les choses anglais, from Scotch Whiskey and English Cheddar down to the Eastern road Rabble-babble. His role was to note what books I read, what annotations I make in them, how I pass my time on deck, and to keep the chef de bureau de surveillance, a Monsieur Irlandais of Gust- bruck Hill informed. He himself got introduced to me, the very next morning after we left Genoa, just as my Cognac Johnstone had done or wanted to do, when he intended to draw me into close conversation with him, on the very first evening of our departure from Genoa. After entering into some con- versation the very first day of our interview, this passenger (always decked with a gold pincenez, flannel shirt, celluloid collars and cuffs) asked me, if I would like to study the charac- ters of the different sorts of men and women on board. I at once felt how wrongly he tried to tater moi, and I instantly shut him up, by replying that it is no use doing that. As every man on board a ship has his shoulders painted, or wears in short a quite different aspect to what he generally has on shore, a mendiant might by a little show pass for a riche ; and a jail-bird or a polisson or a chiffonier for a gentilhomme and a merchant ; an apprentice lad for a chef oi a cigar factory or some plantation field of tea, coffee or sugarcane, somewhere in the Dutch settlements in Java and Sumatra. This my ' philosophe,' I had often observed, was (especially at nightfalls) en tete-a-tete with my Cognac Johnstone, and both these were in constant touch, with the Monsieur Irlandais of lte Kajiite. Under these and helping them constantly, there was a regular monkey police, \u2014 an army of Messrs. Little- brains and Rabble -babbles, some abdominal typed, some semi- abdominals, many greenhorns, some just budding young German lads, and a couple* of spectacled massive-skulled Hollandais, \u2014 going on 3 to 5 years' terms of agreement to various parts of the Eastern Archipelago. In this monkey"], [84, "68 police were enrolled some female passengers of Thackeray's Betsy type, and whose appearance, education, manners and dress would not warrant me, to place them on a higher class than that of the English barmaids or Paris hospital sags femmes. In addition to these\u2014 all belonging to my 2te Kajiite deck, \u2014 there were some (not exceeding half dozen in all) anglais et anglaise of the lte Kajiite, with whom co-operated a few abdominal type passengers of other nationalities and travelling in the same lte Kajiite. All these believing themselves to be members of one family (my White Giant's), took a great int < n *>t in watching and criticising and at times helping, by their co-operation, the several poli-comedie scenes and acts that were being performed by my White Baby's Agents on board the ship, to kill a victim of delusion Anglais. When I saw myself surrounded by such an army of White Giant's Snakes on board the ship, even to the east of Suez, I thought within myself, how green I was in fancying or believing that the magnifying telescope from the banks of the Thames would not go further than Port Said, and that direotly I entered the 1 ndian Ocean, things will return to their natural or normal situ ation. The moment I saw my belief falsified, I saw the great urgency of acting with tact, coolness and judgment. I knew that as a Black Bug, I had to struggle hard against my deluded White Giant, single-handed, and that I was without a single aide or confidante to guide and to help me, and that too in a situation where everyone is, as it were in clamp and padlock as on board a ship. And I must indeed thank Almighty God to have gifted me with the powers of an Indian Snake-Charmer. As a Snake -Charmer, with my bagpipe of pen and paper in hand, I had to charm my White Baby's Snakes, represented on board the German ship by men and women of all nationali ties, \u2014 not only European but Asiatic too. For there were 4 Japanese voyagers and two or three of them, who spoke German as well as English, I knew were actually incited to handle the Parisian fragile broom, and who kept fruitlessly"], [85, "69 twirling it before my face in the Indian Ocean. This type of Asiatics, were all by their size, intelligence and manners too contemptible a set for me to take notice of. One night, while I was promenading on deck, and being alone, amusing myself with some petit chant (in my own Indian language), I found three or four British navvies (and to some of whom I had blistered in my despatches of that morning, calling them regular Jail-birds, &c.) seated in a group, running me down, and with voices loud enough to drown the sound of the heavy sea waves, beating against the sides of the boat. In an unguarded moment (when I had just then partaken a small glass of Fin champagne'), I resorted to a feeble reprisal, by singing \" My White Baby speaks,\" \" My White Baby telephones from London.\" A German missionary, belonging to the Basel Mission and bound for China, at once jumped on his legs from his seat, which he and his wife daily used to occupy, generally every evening on the deck, and ran to a Ceylon Anglais\u2014 old and lame-footed, informing him howl resented the foolish remark of the illiterate British roughs. This old man, who had constant access to the 1st class saloon and deck, transferred the \"news\" to the Monsieur Irlandais of Gustbruck, and at an hour past half -past nine or about ten o'clock, this bully gets out of his cabin and rushes past me, in great haste to call out my Cognac Johnstone. Well, Cognac Johnstone comes on the deck, with a London policeman's glove on one hand, the other hand in his trouser pocket, with his eyes and face openly frowning at me, and walks twice or thrice in front of my chair on the deck. I knew it was all a a show of intimidation, on the part of my White Baby, and did not care to notice, even the fierce glare of this man of the Brandy Bottle, who had, I was sure, perhaps had the tenth dose of his \" Hambourg Water,\" since morning, and this I could easily see from his burning red face and cheeks. I could predict easily (as a professional man) from his looks, that with this man of the Brandy bottle and"], [86, "70 Police Glove. Senile Dementia could not be far off. not many years but months. But what was to me a very important and a very precious discovery was. that. I there and then (that very evening) spotted the man, who was the ringleader in all that passed on board the ship, with reference to me. I suspected him, this a Monsieur Irlandais <,f Gustbruck Hill or a paddy nosed Anglais (as I have called him in some of my letters), along with two or three others, his cons - trymen, one an old man who got down at Port Said, the other working with photo-camera on board the ship. The latter being a nervous-type man, had therefore more of sense and decorum in his behaviour, than his colleague, the abdominal type man from the Gustbruck Hill. The very next morning that the Monsieur Irlandais came on deck, I exchanged glances or rather vindictive stares with him, and soon led him and all others on board the ship to understand, that he was the man at the bottom of all the mischief, so ruthlessly carried on under the flag of our young Kaiser Wilhelm II. and in his floating town of Germania. I quietly regarded and enjoyed the astonishment, of many of the 1st as well as the 2nd class passengers, as to how I came to spot the man. Should they, any of these days chance to see and to read this my narra tive of tour in Europe, they will understand how and when I succeeded in spotting him, \u2014 although I had my suspicions centred in him and all his colleagues Anglais, even long before that night. My suspicion had rested at first on all the 1st Kajiite English passengers, directly the very awful shakes were given to me, the day after leaving Genoa ; and it was only with me a matter of time and close observation, to spot the exact man as a ringleader of the mischief in the ship. My Monsieur Irlandais in all his subsequent acts seemed to me a regular greenhorn, for, he behaved all throughout his journey with me, up to a junction station on the South Indian Railway, like a child or a baby. That very morning at about 10| o'clock, the hour when the ship's bier-halle is opened, he"], [87, "71 came to my 2nd deck and seemed bent upon closing with me. All the time he began to dash against me, with a fierce look. I could easily read his eyes and his character, as indicated by his physiognomy of expression. I soon saw, after about a couple of minutes attentive study of his full face and eyes, that the man was not worth my notice. I have depicted the man sufficiently in one of my letters to my friend in Bombay, and also I believe in my letter to Mrs. M of Leeds, and to another fellow-passenger, who parted company from me on the South Indian Railway. Ever since that night, I spotted him out as the ringleader or Chef de bureau de surveil lance, established by my White Baby onboard the German boat, I never lost sight of the man. Invariably I used to keep my eye on him, whenever he chanced to be on his own 1st deck or on mine the 2nd. It was only by constantly keeping my eye on him, that I succeeded in warding off a trap prepared for me by him, on the Fancy Dress Ball Night. Fancy Ball ofATov. 12th, Indian Ocean. \u2014 Notice to the pas sengers of the 2nd class, inviting them to be present in Fancy Dress costume, at a ball to be given by the Captain, on Wednesday, the 12th November, on the 1st deck, was pasted on the landing, two or three days in advance. And as many of the passengers were busy in preparing their costumes, there was a sort of partial lull in the poli-comedie songs, which were not now sung so frequently, as in the Mediterranean or in the Red Sea. Besides I had in the Red Sea, arranged for and was actually taking lessons in German, from a lady passenger on board every morning. This act \u2014 study of their language \u2014 was looked upon in itself as a sop, I fancy, by many on board. In one of my despatches (vide Appendix No. 8) I played the ruse of referring to what progress I had made, during my previous two voyages, on board the M. M. boats, and how every French pas senger had helped me, in acquiring their French language from the day I left Marseilles for Point de Galle. And I was glad to find next morning as a sequence to this despatch, three or"], [88, "72 four German lads, interesting themselves in my study of their language, and helping me to get up my German lessons every morning and evening. I believe some of my carefully worded lectures too had some effect to soothe the irritation Anglais. For I found a passenger Anglais, whom I used to recognise as Ceylon young Anglais of the 2nd class, (although he did not land there as he told me once he would, and went straight on to Singapore), more familiar and more communicative with me. My barmaid and sage femme class too somewhat quiet, and the only people upon whom my White Giant's agent, Monsieur Irlandais, would count for support were his own countrymen, poor illiterate \" brutes,\" whom I would pity, than think of kicking ; also half a dozen young men, Allemands or Hol landais, and a couple of abdominal types of the same nationality much advanced in years. Fancy Dress Ball Trap, how warded off. \u2014 The 2nd class English passenger, whom I have referred to above as my Ceylon Young Anglais, had a respectable and well-bred exterior, but he was in hand and glove necessarily, with the British chiffoniers or working classes and the British women seated opposite to him on the dining table. I had often observed this man press the keys of my White Baby's Hun garian piano for his favourite tunes. This \" gentleman Anglais\" asked me, on the afternoon of the Fancy Dress Ball night, to subscribe my share of 10 marks to the wine sub scription, he and his other coadjutors \u2014 the British navvies \u2014 had got up. I declined to contribute a single pfenning. Then he came down to 5 marks by way of splitting the difference. This too I declined, and said it was the Captain's ball, and he ought to provide us with wine and champagne. So the matter dropped. The reader need not be astonished, when he learns that except this \" gentleman Anglais,\" a 2nd class passenger, not one of his several coadjutors or countrymen from the 2nd class, \u2014 I refer to the working class, illiterate men, \u2014 had graced the ball by his or their presence. When he had asked"], [89, "73 me to go in shares with these very men and himself, and also to contribute my 10 marks to the wine fund, I suspected some dodge. And as the development of the comedie proceeds, it will be seen that I was right, in declining to put my name down on the wine fund paper. When the ball was going on, **\u00bb was rightly glad, that I had good reason to decline to join the wine company and keep myself aloof, and that I did not easily fall into a trap, (unseen by me as yet in the evening, though I was on a look out for it), that had been laid for me. My Cognac Johnstone was a great favourite of the bar maids and sage femmes, and every now and then he was appealed to in such terms as these : \u2014 \" Where is Mr. John stone ?\"\u2014 \" Here you are.\" \" CaU Mr. Johnstone.\" \" Where is the Dance to take place ?\" asks a Vanity Fair Betsy; and my Cognac Johnstone or somebody else replies down below, and indicates with his finger the hold below our dining saloon. This query was put in my presence, during the tea-time on the afternoon of the Fancy Ball. Neither this, nor the demand for contributions to the wine fund, had at all scared me from going to the ball. To these, two circumstances may be added the third. It was that the band-master hinted to my saloon boy Auguste, that they had essayed that afternoon to play the Valse of \" Fish on the fire,\" \u2014 a Valse that was to be played in the evening at the Fancy Ball and danced perhaps, as a last dance, by the Monsieur Irlandais of Gustbruck Hill and some of the many Anglais, that were then present. I was close to the band-master in the dining saloon, and I remember drop ping in my joke, at the time, that instead of treating us to the music of \"Fish on the fire,\" he had better give us the music of \"Frying pan on the Fire,\" or better still \" From the frying pan into the fire.\" These three circumstances, trifling in themselves, were regular barometric readings to me, as to the storm to be apprehended at the ball, From the* time the ball commenced, till I left it (llf o'clock), I never lost sight of my chef de bureau de surveillance"], [90, "74 of my White Baby. I refer to my Monsieur Irlandais of Gust bruck Hill. I kept my eye constantly upon him, as well as upon the photographer Anglais of the first class, and 2 or 3 other continental passengers of the 2nd class. Three times did the Monsieur Irlandais take away from me, respectable German passengers (1st class), with whom I was engaged in conversation. He even took the Captain once aside, from close to me to the opposite side of the deck, and spoke to him some thing ; also to the Chief Engineer of the vessel. While I was seated on a bench (when the cotillon dances had com menced), and seeking an opportunity of talking with one of the Japanese Sisters of German parentage, I saw how this pretty lady too was removed from my side. Again when I was talking with a respectable gold spectacled thin tall gentleman, another 1st class German passenger, by whose left side was a young German lady, and I seated to his right, I remarked two 2nd class passengers coming towards us. One of them pretending to introduce the other, to the spectacled gentleman, began to talk something in German of course, which I could scarcely understand. I could, however, soon read the meaning of it, from the long faces, which both the German, gentleman and the young lady by his side made. The abdominal type alle mand of the 2nd class had introduced another of his fellow passengers, \u2014 Herr Th. Collmam of Berlin, the passenger from whom I wanted to buy his little book of Vocabulary, English- German, but which he after all presented to me, after procur ing another copy for himself, and with whom I was very fami liar on board. I heard him distinctly say to the said 1st class passenger seated beside me, something which I understood to mean, that they were going to set up a public -house, and that \" Pakaon \" (I spell the word as I had heard it that night) was shortly to be exhibited. The 1st class gentleman, it seemed to me to say, that he is (meaning I am) now studying German &c. But all that had no effect upon the vindictive Mon sieur Irlandais, bent upon painting me or as they used to say"], [91, "75 \" he is to be ticketed.\" Why ? Not that he expected our White Giant would reward him with a Star of India, for drown ing a Black Bug like me in the Indian Ocean. But it was because, I had classified him iu the D. T. Class, in my unsealed despatches and lectures, and had also compared him in his physiognomical expression to my Harry's coachman Rama. This chien enrage had thereupon quietly arranged, and set a nice little trap for me, with the knowledge and perhaps the concurrence of the frank, honest belle Anglaise. For, she too I ran down in one of my letters. She once did say within my hearing while passing by me, close to the bridge (connecting the 1st and 2nd deck), \u2014 \" Is that man mad ?\" And I said to myself, I must blister her next morning, to bring her to her proper rational senses, and to chase the delusion Anglais out of her mind. And I did it. I was sure it will have effect. Just as my Mrs. Oldshoe and Mrs. Blue Cabbage and others were shut up, so she, poor innocent Anglaise of Singapore, was also brought round by one single lecture, and that, too, by verbally preaching it, in the presence of one or two 2nd class passen gers. I found her coquetting with her maid companion on the mid -deck, the following evening after dinner, and I at once seized the splendid chance of orally narrating, my opinion of her to those round about me. I was sure the ship's telegraph or telephone would carry my lecture, that very night to the person blistered, for kicking me impudently the night before. When the 1st class spectacled German gentleman and the lady by his side were scared away from me, by a message from Monsieur Irlandais, delivered through the medium of 2nd class passengers as indicated above, I too quitted the bench and went and stood by the side of the Captain. When I was standing close behind the Captain, my greenhorn Anglaise drop ped a couple of expressions to the Captain, which made me more wide-awake and to come to a resolve, there and then, to take to my heels immediately. In her first round, she demanded of the Captain, \" How many dances you promised me ?\""], [92, "76 The Captain, whom I never saw dancing, both in this as well as in the former two balls, replied, \" ivhat dances?\" And the matter dropped, as she moved on. In her 2nd or 3rd round she, a_ tin looking at me aud at the Captain alternately, said with a sneerin0* lauo-h, \" you must wait till the last dance.\" Imme diately I caught the meaning of this hint, and in some 5 minutes more, I thanked the Captain for his kind invite, saluted, and retired to my cabin to undress. As it was too early to retire (llj o'clock), I went to the 2nd Steward's Bier-halle go down, and there called for 2 pints of Columbhar Bier, one after another, as I felt somewhat depressed and agitated by this sort of vindictive chase. Here my table boy, Auguste, comes in and tells something to the 2nd Steward. I could not understand him, as he talked Deutsch. But in the very expres sive facial angles of this, my saloon boy Auguste, barely out of his teens, I could easily read signs of discomfiture, \u2014 what a sell to Messrs. Irlandais and his coadjutors, who had laid, I can divine easily, what sort of trap for me, a solitary, unpro tected traveller and a poli-comedie victim of delusion Anglais. As a sign of this sort of discomfiture, I found that next morning, my garcon de bad, would not come at all to call me to the Bad-Zimmer, though it was past 7 ; and I had to occupy all my time from 6\u00a3 o'clock (the hour appointed for me to take the bath), till past 7, in reading up my German lessons in my cabin. It was only after my garde-malade, Cognac Johnstone, went out and left some message, with the Stewards in the Steward's saloon, that I believe my garcon de bad came to call me, saying the bad was ready for me, at twenty past 7 o'clock that morning. I quietly took it and left for the deck immediately. The whole of this day (13th November) my discomfited Monsieur Irlandais, neither my belle and frank Anglaise, nor some of their chief coadjutors would show me their embarrassed faces. On the 14th November, I wrote another despatch to my friend Surgeon H. D, P. in Bombay, aud while writing, a young German lad, Monsieur Dindigul, of"], [93, "77 Ludwick, keeps hanging about me, and I purposely tell him that I was writing to my friends in Bombay, a good account of the Fancy Dress Ball, which took place the night before. This was what I prefer calling, my signal to the chef de bureau de surveillance Anglais, to profit by it, if he likes. And I was morally certain he did. He must go to mimerica for two years. \u2014 Up to the time (November 1st) the vessel arrived at Port Said and from the moment we left Genoa, there was no end of shaking given to me by men and women of all sorts. I divined well the dodge was to chauffer mon cerveau to a pitch of excitement, and then to deprive me of my liberty and to chain me down in the hold of the ship, until she dropped anchor, and then to await instruc - tions by telegraph, from my White Baby on the banks of the Thames, near the Westminster Bridge, whether to take me to India, as a malade dangereux, or to drop me down at Port Said and thence to pack me off to America. I used to hear often times, not only some of the passengers but even the three atten dants of the Crown Prince of Norway (in whose spar deck cabin I was lodged from Genoa to Port Said) , especially on the morning following my caustic karten of 31st October and 1st November and the despatches from Port Said, saying to each other that he must go to America for two years. Such talk regarding my White Baby's intention to deport me to America, I had heard very often in London even. If he did not carry out this his blunder, it was because I ran (as it were) out of London, within four days of my return from Scotland, long before the White Giant could mature his plan of killing a Black Bug in that style. I had left London, after a resolution made of a sudden and within 24 hours of making it, and under the emergent or exigent circumstances, which demanded my early quitting the White Giant's palace of brouillard et parapluie. Frustrated there in his own city, my Giant showed some unwillingness to let me embark from Genoa. Perhaps he had all this while fancied, that his ' ' menial being out of pocket and living on"], [94, ":-' . i i \u25a0 , , : , .....' .d 1 I'l ap An .,;;.- \u25a0 \u25a0 ! \u25a0 tie < - im ..I l',.|i-eoriie.|ie \u25a0'.-.N., I il - I I le \u25a0\u2022' le I ' I :, | -,,,,.!. .., < ...i -id e.

I could easily glean from the talk I used to hear at the Grand Hotel and its table d'hote, that he evidently wanted to keep me out of his Indian shop, for about a year or more. I am sure he did actually conceive such a foolish course. The great Dhuleep Singh was sent back from Aden to Europe, and his entry to India was prevented, barely four years ago. This action regarding Dhuleep Singh of the Panjaub, was in itself a blunder, akin to the many our John Bull has been making ever since the Crimean War. From that time up to this date, I can lay my finger, on no less than a dozen great political blunders, which our frank and unthinking John Bull's leaders of the nation have made, and for which even the man of cowdung and red paint, I have heard in some of the cities of India, laughing under his sleeves. Had I taken no steps in Paris (where I had to shut myself up for the whole month of September, fearing the effects of the irritation Anglais), to dispel the delusion of my White Giant ; had I not attempted to improve the situation and to rehabilitate myself in his eyes, as well as in the eyes of my eountrymen iu Bombay, by making a sort of \"confession,\" as to comment sou fit lajournaliste d Paris en 1880-81, regarding the management and maintenance of my White Giant's Asiatic boutique, I am sure, judging from his disposition and behaviour with me, that he would have carried out his intention of deporting me to America. And why ? Just to give me time to cool down, by new sights and new impressions in the New World, and to forget all his insensate and cruel acts of boycotting me, a poor inno cent Black Bug,\u2014 his own subject, and getting me kicked by the other nations of Europe, with a view to kill me by inches, simply out of his pure delusion. For every time a letter was being penned, our White Giant was in a rage, and would begin to tap at what he fancied to be my wrong ends. I have heard many a greenhorn in London, preaching into my ears the words ' He is a rogue, they are all hard upon the paint, and fear that the arsenic, contained in the paint will poison the whole"], [96, "80 people of India\" ! I must leave the reader to stretch the mean ing of this sort of language and to draw his own conclusion, therefrom. And just as in London, so on board the Sachsen, I did not hear of America, until my caustic lectures and dis courses were despatched. To the discomfiture of many Messrs. Littlebraius aud the Rabblebabbles on board, our White Ciant it seems to me at last, wisely telegraphed permission to take the Black Bug to his home, with instructions to see him landed safely in India, now that he has withstood all the fear ful shaking given to him in the Mediterranean. For, at tea time, immediately after embarking from Port Said, I had heard my barmaids and sage-femmes, giving vent to their disappoint ment remarking, \"it is as it were a precious thing, ought to be guarded and carried home safely and so forth.\" The talk of d I'Amdrique then and there ceased, and was no more heard by me in the Red Sea or the Indian Ocean. Method of signalling from the 1st to the 2nd Deck. \u2014 Our White Giant's chiffoniers and workmen would still keep going on singing their Hungarian Valse, they were instructed to sing by the bureau de surveillance, by signals such as the waiters \u2022brought to the dining saloons, or given by a ivave of les chapenux Anglais, from the first deck to the 2nd deck, or brought from them verbally, by three or four second class passengers of other nationalities. These men seemed to me, extremely condescend ing to oblige my Monsieur Irlandais of Gustbruck Hill and his colleagues Anglais, for the late very precious gift of Heligoland to their countrymen. \" Who is the butcher ? Where is the butcher\" ?\u2014 To shorten the narrative of the sweetened pancakes, in the shape of des patches and lectures, I offered to my White Baby, and which he seemed to gulp down sans fagon, I would like to refer to one or two more incidents, and then finish this my personal history of my voyage home by the N. L. Postdampfer Sachsen. Once I called Mes Saucissons or Messrs. Sausages (as the Germans are nicknamed by John Bull) the Butcher of the Rhine. And the"], [97, "81 very next morning, an Anglais of the working class (2nd class passenger), while going down the steps to the dining saloon, ques tions behind me in a loud tone, \"Who is the butcher \"? \" Where is the butcher \"? I also that day observed, what a blistering effect this sort of expression had, on some sensitive Allemands. So the very next opportunity I had, of penning another des patch, I played the ruse of stating therein, that my house keeper of Rue Richepanse, Madame Blanche, used to call him \" the butcher of the Rhine.\" This clever dodge of shifting on to the shoulders of the French \u2014 the natural enemies of the Germans\u2014 the sting of the appellation given by me and me alone, had, I soon saw, a soothing effect. For some of the mem bers of the equipage of the vessel \u2014 I mean some matelots and cuisiniers and garcons and even Officers and others, who used to stare bitterly hard at me, for daring to call their countrymen the butcher of the Rhine, seemed to me to be softened down. I soon felt I had soothed the irritation caused by that sort of expression. A despatch sent to England to Mrs. M of Leeds. \u2014 In my letter or despatch written, while nearing Colombo to Mrs. M of Leeds, I had severely handled my \"Cognac Johnstone\" and my \" philosophe\" and the \" Monsieurlrlandais,\" \u2014 their chief. This had the remarkable effect of quieting them. I stated therein how this man (the philosophe) would promenade, with a serious pose and every now and then would seize a chance, to ask me to favour him with a look at the books or pamphlets I was reading, just to note, I knew, what annotations I make therein. He every now and then used to note, how far I had advanced in reading the volume of the Newcomes, presented to me by my Lady guide, philosopher and friend of Scotland. I also informed Mrs. M. how this espion philosophe of my White Baby, would preach to me some three or four times, his own views, justi fying the act of suicide. And another friend of his (Mr. T. Colluram. of Berlin), would come and direct my attention to"], [98, "82 the word suicide in his English -German Vocabulary, and ask me how to pronounce it, Zuizide or how ? I knew well how to interpret such foolish and insensate acts of our deluded White Giant. Still another ruse. \u2014 And the more to quiet tlie Hungarian band of my White Baby I played another ruse. One morning (Friday, November 14th), while nearing Colombo, I entered the 2nd Steward's room, to pay my weekly bill of wine, and there, on an envelope (I had asked him to spare me), I wrote in his presence and on his table, the name and address of Sir G. S. V. Fitzgerald, Political A.-D.-C. to the Secretary of State for India. The news I was sure would soon be circulated from one end of the ship to the other, \u2014 that a letter is going to be written that day to the India Office. I quietly guarded the envelope in my pocket that day. Next morning (Saturday, No vember 15th) was a rainy morning, and I had in addition to my Beer glass, taken a glass of sherry and my usual half bottle of red or white wine during midday meal. Everybody expected that I would write out another slashing despatch, and that they will again have (and this the last time, as we were due at Co lombo on the day following), a nice chance of opening the book and translating its contents. The hour for serving tea came, \u2014 4 o'clock p. m., and finding that still I did not write it, many on my dining table, from my philosophe down to my Madame la Grand'mere, began to cry out \" He is drunk,\" \" He is drunk.\" I quietly accepted the hint and I began to tater le pouls oi my philosophe, seated opposite to me, \u2014 asking him if any letters for Europe, posted that day would be transferred to a postdampfer of the same line, proceeding to Europe and awaiting our arrival at Ceylon. He said \" he was not sure,\" but he assured me that any letter for Europe would be quite safe, if posted here in the poste Kaiserlich. He evidently meant to tell me, that it would be unsafe for me to post a letter to Europe, in a British or British -Indian postbox ! I believe my evergreen philosophe did up to this day, perhaps fancy, that"], [99, "83 the reasons why I kept writing almost daily, so many letters on board the ship (and I don't think any of the passengers had written so many letters as I did), was perhaps through my fear of miscarriage from the British postbox. I am sure, until he looks into this Looking -Glass, he and his set will not change their opinion, and will still keep flattering themselves with the false idea that they all saw through my inside, whereas I could not see through theirs. I am sure he little fancied, while on board the ship, that all my despatches and lectures were les gateaux sueres, and couched in humorous sketches and love songs purposely, to act as a blind, to my own intention of giving a bit of my mind to my poli-comedie actors, as to what I thought of them and bow I viewed the foolish actions of many of them on board. The last despatch to India, dated November 15th, 9 o'clock p.m. \u2014 At 1\\ p. m. (November 15th, Saturday) after dinner, I went down to the dining saloon, called for pen and ink and began to pen a letter, not to the India office A.-D.-C, but to my own brother-in-law in Calcutta. I eannot here describe the glee, into which my principal poli-comedie actors, I mean the men forming the bureau de surveillance went into, as soon as they found me with pen and paper again, getting ready another sweetened pancake for them, with \\ pint of Rheingold opened before me. In this my letter, I excused myself by saying, that I was going that morning to write a slashing letter to Sir G. S. V. Fitzgerald, but I prefer doing that from Bombay, with more of thought and less of feeling. I took advantage of this my last chance of offering another gateau to my White Baby and his coadjutors, on board the ship who so eagerly helped him. I tried to blister the latter, by alluding to the Military craze of the rising nation of Central Europe, and which has been so humorously criticised by Mr. Child, in his article in Harper's Magazine for August J 890. I had read an epitome of Mr. Child's coup d'\u0153il of Berlin, in the Figaro, when in Paris. I said in this my last letter,"], [100, "84 written on the last night of my quitting the ship, how the poor Alsatians were cowed down to submission, by the Butcher of the Rhine, by a regular Military show, and that how I longed to take a run this the 2nd time to Stras bourg or Metz, to judge for myself, whether the rulers and the ruled there, after some ten years, since my last visit to the latter city in 1880, had at all been recognised. This had, I soon observed, some veiy crushing effect. I should certainly call such language, as the storm which a passenger had said in my presence, he feared would come on at Colombo. Yes, it was a storm cache, not the silly sort of storm, which occasionally one notices on board a ship, directly the land is in sight and the steamer drops anchor. But the great thunderbolt in that my despatch was the avowal, on my part, as to how I succeeded in defying my poli-comedie actors by a perfect command of my muscles of facial expression. I avowed, how I could draw these men out, by working up my facial muscles to an expression of great torture and pain, or defy them by expressions of nonchalance and ease. I also re ferred to the stupid insinuations of one old woman (a passenger in the Italian boat), when she accused me of being a murderer and a poisoner of my Parsi wife ; and complained that is the style in which these people judge me. All this had such a blistering effect on mes Saucissons et mes Anglais excentriques, that while seated on my chair (after handing in my despatch to the paymaster in his room at 9-20 ; for the despatch box was closed at 9 o'clock), I read with pleasure and just pride the faces of a couple of 1st cl. passengers. These two gentlemen had turned up on the deck, near the railings, and in full glare of the electric light, shedding its bright lustre on the mid-deck, where the ship's band was playing at the time. One of them, a middle-aged gentleman with a Turkish fez on, stood on the bridge, connecting the 1st and 2nd decks ; and the other the gold spectacled German gentleman was vis-d-vis moi on his own deck. On the faces of these both, what did I read, after for-"], [101, "85 warding my despatch to Calcutta ? Utter discomfiture for be ing sold actually by an Indian, whom our White Giant wanted to chase out of Europe, by ticketing him as the drole and mad cap, and to send him back to be caged and chained to his In dian shop. I am sure when this narrative of journey comes to their knowledge, I know not how much some of these very passengers, who used to ring into my ears a German song on an evergreen Christmas tree, almost every night, would now begin to bite their own finger nails, and to pull out the hairs of their own scalps, for blindly following in the wake of our poor deluded White Giant. He is a giant indeed, in person and in possessions, but most unfortunate for him, gifted with the brains of a child or a baby. The Tourist thanks the Captain. \u2014 I cannot let this opportunity pass without thanking the Commander of the Norddeutscher Lloyd Postdampfer Sachsen, Captain Von Gossel, for comfort- ably guarding me on board his ship and seeing me landed safely on the palmy shores of Ind, at the port of my destina- tion (Colombo), and that too in the teeth of so very strong a dislike and hatred of me, as the man \u2014 the cause of all poli- comedie mischief in the principal cities of Europe. While tendering him my best thanks, for all the marques de bienveil- lance shown to me, I would also compliment him on the splendid state of discipline maintained under his command on board. For not a member of the ship's equipage (from the stewards down to the youngest matelot) did ever utter a mot mauvais contre moi, or point his finger of scorn to me ; \u2014 a fact which struck me, as a remarkable contrast with the kind of treatment I met on board the Italian ship (on which I was engaged from Bombay as Surgeon), while she was lying in the Genoa dock. I will refer to this at length in my future publication. Suffice it to record here en passant for the reader's information, that in a small and unimportant town like Genoa, and in the full heat of August, I had to waste my four precious days, literally doing nothing. I had to wait there from 2nd to the 5th of"], [102, "86 August, the arrival of my letter of remittance, from Bombay (posted tho day following my sailing from Bombay\u2014 July 11th by the outward English Mail) directed to my address, care of the Rubattino office, Genoa. Strange to say, this, my only letter, found its way back to Bombay, when all others received later on were redirected to London and Paris. I regret this sketch, I have so hastily drawn, of my return journey from London to India, is not so well delineated as I should have liked to do. Many interesting incidents and sketches and table-talk are yet to be put in. But I hope to improve the narrative and to revise the entire section here after, when the other portion (and it is a very important portion) of my journey from Genoa to Wiesbaden, Wiesbaden to Berlin, Berlin to Petersburgh and back again via Mos cow and Varsovie, and thence to Paris via Koln, Paris to London, and London to round about Balmoral Castle and back via Birmingham, will be drawn up and published. Meanwhile I would like to end this sketch of my journey in the Postdampfer Sachsen, from Genoa to Colombo (October 27th to November 16th) with the following German song, intended for me, no doubt, and which I got some greenhorn of an Allemand to write with his own hands in my book. I would present this very song to my fellow-passengers of the N. L. S. S. Sachsen, mesdames et messieurs, both of the 1st and 2nd Kajiite, with my many souhaits de bien venue to the East. I would beg of them to guard carefully, this their own song, with them, until some two or three years after this, I may have the pleasure of greeting them with bon voyage on their return journey to their homes. I hope (D. V.) then to join with them in a chorus, to sing this very song on the evergreen Christmas tree, on board another Norddeutscher Lloyd postdampfer :\u2014 > \u0152amubaum \u00c6antubaum [O, continent; O, continent.] OTte griin.it Srine Blatter, Bu griinst mcht bios -wit Sommtrjett \u0152u gtUnst attcfi farnn's g.fricrt urn. sc.tut't."], [103, "87 Concluding section. \u2014 In conclusion, once for all, I would de clare here frankly and honestly, that in trying to preserve mes souvenirs of all the sufferings and kicks I have received from my deluded White Giant in Europe, not only chez lui (where had he been a practical man of tact and good sense, I should have liked him to wash our dirty clothes), but over all the cities of Europe I have visited, and over all the lines of railways of different Governments I have travelled upon, my sole object in preserving a faithful and honest record of my sufferings, is not to resort to reprisals. I am a man in whose veins the true blue blood of my ancient fore-fathers, the Zoroastrian Persians, is still running ; and as a descen dant of what was once a high and noble family going in my community in Bombay, and as a grandson of the late Viccaji Meerji, the founder of the great firm of Excise Farmers and Bankers, flourishingly trading in Bombay, more than 50 years ago, \u2014 I am the last man to think of revenge. I owe no grudge, no personal enmity to the many races of Europeans from whom I have had to suffer, out of sheer delusion Anglais ; I mean specially the countrymen of the race, which has in this, the modem age, given to the world a regular anny of Heroes, and as souvenirs of whose heroic deeds, I have been, some years since, guarding in my own drawing-room a large chromo-pic ture of \" Kaiser Wilhelm I. und seine Helden 1870. \" When ever I sight this living picture, as it were, of heroes mounted on their showy steeds, I know what feelings of admiration and love, are excited in me for the nation, which could produce such men in this modern age. It was impelled by such feel ings that I went to their country, where I wanted to make myself somewhat familiar with their language and institutions. And if by some misadventure, some unseen malheur, I have been defeated in this my object, I despair not. Now that my White Baby's Red Rag is chased back to the country of the Hindoos and chained there, God knows, how long, or perhaps for ever, till he falls sick and dies, \u2014 I am sure the delusion will"], [104, "88 and must subside, and in no time things will return to their normal or natural aspect. To my White Giant too, I will no longer sting like a wasp for the dreadful squeeze given by him to me. A poor Black Bug bike me can easily be crushed and killed by him, had it pleased the Almighty to so ordain. I would simply beg of him now and ask him to find out the real mischief-makers, in his own way and according to his best lights, and to move the nation's representatives to hang them. Instead of hushing up this ugly matter of boycotting and chasing out of Europe, an unpleasant native of India, it is to his future interest, as a great Asiatic Power, to guard his sensitive points or wrong ends, from the scratches of his own jealous neighbours, who ever they may be ; and to be no more sensitive to the feeble or trifling scratches, which an Indian like me may have made on him or may think of making in the future. So far as I am personally concerned I know, that as a native of India, I am not entitled to the same privileges and rights, enjoyable by an Englishman and a subject of the Queen. For I was distinctly given to understand in London, and that too by an educated and well-bred Englishman, this the only and the first time in my life, that I am not a subject of the Queen-Em press but of the Viceroy, whom she sends out every five yeaisto rule this the country of the Hindoos. It was on my humour ing him, one day while passing the Marble Arch at Hyde Park, on the top of an Omnibus, by asserting that He and / are subjects of the same Sovereign, and that as such we stand in the relation of \"half brothers\" to each other, \u2014 that he instantly opened out and corrected me, by reminding me that \" you are not the subject of the Queen, but of the Viceroy.\" Tres bien! my frank and honest John Bull.

I trust some more sensible and more intelligent and more loyal subject of the Viceroy, than what I am, may accept this expression of an English man's opinion, (given in his own house with a candour natural to him), in its true and proper sense, and act up to it by composing, in each and all of the Indian vernacular languages, a new hymn, \" God save our Viceroy of India\" \u2014 to be sung by our little children, on every public occasion, say at the landing pier of the gate of India (Bombay), and in the Town Halls of its principal capitals. To dwell more on the bearings of this assertion will be going off at a tangent. So I had better now conclude this my first fascicule of my narrative of European tour, by assuring my White Giant, that \" nous ne nous chauffons pas du meme bois, nous n'avons rien de commun;\" and that \"s'il m'attaque, je lui serai voir a quel homme il aura affaire.\" In getting this my Looking-Glass for my poli-comedie actors in Europe, I believe I have acted honourably and honestly, being guided solely by the wisdom of the precious French proverb, \u2014 \" Aux grands maux les grands remedes,\" corresponding in sense to which aphorism is the following line of Corneille : \u2014 \" Ils aut ne craindre rien, quand on a tout d craindre.\""], [106, "A_P__>E_Ns__>IX:. No. 1. Boycotting: a Native of India in Europe To the Editor of the \" TIMES.\" On the 10th of July last, an opportunity suddenly presented itself of revisiting Europe, and I eagerly seized it, by accepting the appointment of medical officer on board the S. S. Singa pore, Rubattino Une of Italian Mail Steamers, and arrived at Genoa on the 2nd of August, where I had to wait until the 5th idem, pending the arrival of my letters from Bombay. Neither at Genoa nor at Frankfort -on -the -Maine did anybody care to notice me, nobody knew who I was, and I was moving freely and was enjoying my visit to these cities quietly. From Frankfort I went to Wiesbaden, which place I had hurriedly seen in 1875. * * * After a dreadfully long monsoon voyage (10th July to 2nd August) under the strong heat of the Red Sea, with my hands full of professional work on board the ship, I felt somewhat exhausted and fatigued ; and in the bracing air of Wiesbaden, I thought of regaining my health by a short stay of about a week or so. But most unfortunately for me, the \" poli-comedie\" or \"Corn-die politique\" (which I also call boycotting) here begins. An English lady in the Salon de Lecture of the Kursal Hall, who could never have seen me before, and who never knew who I was, stares at mo full in the face and says loudly, ' They say he is mad. ' I guarded my sang-froid at the time and passed by her without noticing her and the next morning at the Table d'Hote of the hotel I was in, an Englishman* sitting close to me began to put me a variety of questions on India. He asked me point blank, how it is that the English in India make colossal fortunes so very easily and quickly? Can you tell me why the natives of India are so very invariably very poorly paid by their English * Who told me, he was the Canvasser on the Continent for a Scotch Insurance Company."], [107, "91 employers, their salary scarcely suffices to feed and to clothe them ? What is the number of English troops in Bombay ? Is it well fortified for defence ? &c. &c. He also wanted me to fix my time of visiting England, especially his own city Edin burgh, so that he could be there to show it to me at the time. I could soon see through the drift of his questions, and I was sure a mischief (the like of which I had very feebly experienced *\u00bb 1881), teas brewing. So I next morning at once quitted Wiesbaden and went direct to Berlin. I had twice gone over the principal cities of Western and Southern Europe, and this time I had a great desire to see places or parts of Europe I had never before seen. I was strongly recommended by a German passenger, on board the ehip (Mr. Willrich, of Ditmar and Co., Bombay) to see Berlin, and he even presented me with a copy of the Illustrated Berlin Guide, published by the American Exchange in Europe, Berlin Agency. In Berlin, the \" poli-Coniedie \" began openly, and I was to my face insulted by people (of all ranks and classes) who never knew me and could never have seen me before, with such epithets as drole, imbecile, bete. I could not conceive any cause, which would justify men, and that too highly edu cated and apparently serious men, to insult a stranger and a for eigner, who was alone, solitary, unprotected and totally ignorant of their language, on the very day he set his foot in their city. Gifted as I am by nature with a somewhat touchy disposition, I commenced to brew chagrin iu my breast, I lost flesh and appe tite, and at times, with so many eyes on me in public cafes and theatres, &c. I often got confused and would even miss my chemin. Another Indian in my place would have soon taken to his heels and cursing his lot or his revilers, would have at once thought of re-crossing the Lesseps Canal, I could easily see that just as I put on two costumes, European in Europe, costume Parsee chez-moi, I carry two eharaoters and two faces, My position, prestige and occupation, on the other side of the Suez Canal were never such as to justify any person,\u2014 not even"], [108, "92 the countrymen of the men who so fanatically have commenced to pousser moi d bout here, \u2014 to revile me and to call me on my face a bete, a sou, a drole, imbecile, &c, &c, or to put me under an espionage, as if I were a dangerous man to be let loose on the continent of Europe, and that I deserved to be soon chased out of it back to India. It did not require in me a long reflection to see below the surface of things,\u2014 when I saw people quite un- known to me and to whom I was a perfect stranger, seeing drolcrie in my eyes (ladies especially), some in my ears, some scanning my face with a dreadful look, as if I was a great Fenian going, or a rogue, or a polisson. Even the Police of Berlin, I found so manipulated, that whenever I happened to converse with anybody on the road or to make a purchase in a shop, or to enter a casts or concert garden, I have often observed the Ger- man gendarme point to his head and make signs or sending some passers by in the shop, to tell people that I was a crazy drole. I have heard passengers travelling in my own compart- ment by Express trains, pointing me out on Railway buffets and platforms to the conductors and others \" C'est Indien Id est drdle,\" and what was to me mo3t amusing is that in Petersburgh, while I was reading an article in your paper of August 20th, ou Dhuleep Singh, an Englishman in the reading room of the Hotel I was in, remarks to his friends within my hearing \u2014 \"We have another Dhuleep Singh among us\"! Here in Paris a friend of mine mockingly compares me to \" Tippoo Saheb \" who waged war contre les Anglais aux hides. Being alone and unprotected and not at all knowing the languages spoken here, I thought my best course was to guard silence, surrounded as I was by people who knew nothing of me (beyond what they were told) and who I felt sure were befooled by some astute person or persons evidently with the object of chasing me out of Europe* * * * * I was really sur prised to find in the cities of civilized Europe, methods similar to our Indian villages, adopted by men of education and good breed ing. I have seen comedies played in the theatres of Europe"], [109, "93 as well as of India, wherein they mettre en peine and at last ii la porte unpleasant persons. Hence I quietly kept watching and observing all these tricks or devices* for the adoption of which I must indeed comphment the brains, which first con- ceived it in my case. Such devices often scared away ladies and children from me in the theatres and concerts, and kept everybody's attention on me. At last matters went beyond the limit of patient endurance, for, one night while returning from the Belle Alliance Theatre, Berlin, to my hotel (Kaiser William Strasse), I found people pulling me by my legs while I was mounting the top of a tramcar, and I had to complain about it to my hotel keeper. He spoke and understood English, im- perfectly however. I told him who I was, where I came from, showed him the testimonial (see page 29) I had obtained at Genoa on the 5th ultimo from Rubattino and Co.'s bureau, expressing their satisfaction, both as to my professional merit and behaviour on board their ship. This had some effect of quieting the rage. I wish the deluded person or persons, who thought of such a stupid device to chase me out of Europe back to India, had some sense or conscience, left in them to judge of the grave consequences, both to my person and to my purse in a foreign country, which their delusion en- dangered. I resolved to quit Berlin, and without waiting even a day more to see Potsdam and Sans Souci (and which I visited hurriedly only on my return from Warsaw to Paris, when I halted for 12 hours at Berlin), I left directly for Petersburg. When I talked of going to Russia, everybody in Berlin would make a long face, and nobody would give me any in formation as to the cheapest route to Petersburg and back to Europe again. Ever since the time I had read Mackenzie * A description of how and by whom the ' sou ' trick was started to chase me out of Paris in 1881, after I was received as Doctenr en Medecine of the Faculty, who set the ball rolling, and how it was imitated by my White Babies this 'ame and worked by them from rail to rail, aud country to country, to chase uie out of Europe will be found in my diary ot touv in Europe."], [110, "94 Wallace's work on Russia, his graphic description of Moscow and his picturesque sketch of the fair of Nijni Novgorod, I longed to see Russia and its varied people,\u2014 of whom the Eng lish papers in India talk toujours, so much so as to hammer the word Russia into the brains of the unlearned Hindoos of Punjab and the N.-W. frontier. I was constantly observing that from the moment I set foot on the Russian Railway, that the ever-suspicious nature of the Russians was tickled by the leading actors of the \" Comedie politique \" ; and I was not the least afraid of the strict espionage in which I was kept, up to the moment I crossed the Russian frontier at Thorn. I found the Russian as hospitable as we Parsees are, and what was to my advautage, I found him so very wide-awake, that he would not allow himself to be befooled by foreigners, as to my great regret I found his immediate neighbours were. Both by day and night, I was able to move freely, without the least apprehension of any sort, or any annoyance from the people (as in Berlin) and enjoyed my trip at Petersburg, Moscow and Varsovie better than in Germany ; for I found every educated Russian speaking with me French and somewhat the English too.* * * * * f The moment I entered Paris I found these men (my poli-comedie actors) so fanatically down on me, not only my John Bull of Europe, but his wife and his sympathisers, that I knew not how to cool his excited mind ; for me to pay him off single-handed in his own coin would not do at all. I eagerly wished and still wish that some sensible persons from the num bers moving about everywhere here, \u2014 for the Chapeaux An glais I can easily spot in any city of Europe, \u2014 would just but condescend, to converse with me and to give me an opportunity to drive away his delusion, impelled by which he runs me down wherever he spots me, with such vile words as ' C'est le bite, t A description of the journey I performed from Berlin to Paris via Koln, will fit in this brief sketch of my personal history admirably, but it will be found in its proper place in the 2nd Fascicule to be pub lished hereafter."], [111, "95 il est drdle, il est sou, il va mourir, il a mal au c\u0153ur, and also at times using threatening expressions, such as that \" he will have to pay by his neck on his return to India, \" &c, &c. I can not recall with what feelings of disgust, I quietly heard or rather suffered myself to be marked down, by an aged English man in the Opera House of the Varsovie Park- He was not far off my fauteuil d' Orchestra and was talking loudly in French to a Russian Military officer, saying ' C'est un Indien, il est bete' ! I wish for John Bull's own reputation (and less for my own sake), he preserves his own national calm and collected mind, and cool temper, and takes the trouble to see below the surface of things, before he fanatically rushes on a poor obscure unfortunate native of India, (and that too not a Hindoo, but a Parsee), and makes a laughing stock of himself before the eyes of the far-seeing and wide-awake French and the Russians. * * I have often mixed with the English in India, and like all other classes of educated native, I have studied the prominent traits of his character so well, that we in India require no Max O'Rell to tell it to us. For every Englishman in India lives, as it were, in a glass-house, just as we Indians are up here. From the moment he is out of his bed-room, till he re-enters it again at night, he is under a close observation of every educated Indian, and I e&npridire from what I know of him (the Englishman of India), that no Englishman in India would ever so lose his self-respect and forget himself, as to venture to run down a stranger, in the fashion I have seen it done by his countrymen in Europe. When I hear my deluded friends calling me names, swearing at me, and trying to irritate me, my consolation is, to put down their vile action, as coming from men who know not the rules of \" Savoir vivrei' and who are simpletons enough to believe, by whomsoever and whatso ever they hear or is said to them ; of whose conscience the least I can say is that it must have been left in some corner of their tiro.r, and that evidently they don't carry it in their breasts,"], [112, "96 and whose conduct deserves to be looked down upon as a spe cies of moral cowardice. For it is nothing more than moral cowardice, to attack without reason or justification (but out of pure delusion) a solitary stranger. I remember well a Russian gentleman telling me, that even if I disliked les Anglais and even if I had the boldness or impudence to criticise and to run down in any manner I liked, the way in which they rule India, that was no reason why les Anglais, whose subject I am and upon whose protection and support I ought to count here at least in Europe, should behave with me in a way which he says, savours of nothing more than moral cowardice on their part. A word more as to my anti -English feelings. I believe no native of India was ever so passionately fond of English life and manners as myself ; it was once a dream of my life to visit London and to enjoy life there, \u2014 a city where my father, brother, and other members of my family have often visited and lived in. It was in November 1875, that I first visited London, and while on the voyage out on board the S. S. Travancore (P. & O. line), I was so shamefully treated and made so very miserable by a handful of English passengers, who first made of me a Roi from Bombay to Aden, and directly they learnt at the latter port, that I was a poor obscure mendi ant, serving somewhere in the Medical Department, and their mistake in making of me a Roi, they were so intolerant of my presence on board the ship, that what they (including thcir ladies) did and said then, I still vividly remember. Ever since that my dislike (or hatred as some choose to call it) of the English began ; and on my return to India, I began to study carefully the weak points in their administration of the country of the Hindoos. When again in Europe in 1879-80, living here among a free and frank people, and under a republican form of government, I imbibed a little of their spirit. At that time I was suffering under a personal grievance against my employers,\u2014 the English in India. I was also smarting much"], [113, "97 against my friend ou the banks of the Thames, for having sent me back empty-handed (without a diploma of tho Royal 'College of Surgeons, for which I had studied hard, and for which I was pulled through its first examination). If under these circumstances, I have said and portrayed before his neighbours (on this side of the English channel), his mode of administration of India, in a way not all flattering to him,\u2014 1 ask, does that act constitute Fenianism ? I am sure I have not criticized the way in which India is ruled, to one-tenth the extent, at which it is done by educated Brahmins and politicians, nor have I painted my friend the John Bull of India, in so dark a colour as some do in India. I see no reason why an Englishman should be so very over sensitive, if any Indian, a little familiar with Europe (as I am) were to criticize iu any way he likes, the administration of India by England. A time is fast approaching, when dozens of Hindoo Congresswallas, and Hindoo political agitators will seek to ventilate their real or fancied grievance against the English rule in India, on the political platform of Europe. They have but just commenced the study of the French and German languages, and some the Russian too. And, I ask, will these men be set down (like me) for Fenians ? Will they be espionaged by all the British Consulates scattered over Europe ? Will they be run down with such words as \" C'est Indien Id est bete ; il est drSle ,-je croyais bien qu'il eslfolle.\" Will they be questioned, through the agency of the Americans and the French or Germans, as to how England retains its hold of India by a handful of an army ? and their opinion demanded as mine has been, as to what they think of Russia and its soldiers. ****** Notwithstanding all this, my personal dislike of the English (which began in 1875) is not diminished, and why? The cause is not far off to seek. Insulting, irritating and crushing treatment of we, the educated Indians, of whom an Englishman in India, always demand-* an 7"], [114, "98 amount of servility and obeisance, which wo cannot accord with free will and a frank heart. To conclude, I have been watching, Sir, very critically, the various phases of this poli-comedie, this contre- temps anglais against me. I can trace it to his simple over-sensitiveness to criticism, surtout on his administration of India. We all in India, know perfectly that an Englishman will bear any amount of criticism and rabid talk, from the Indian or vernacu lar press, and the quasi-political associations of the cities of India ; he will bear any amount of taunt and what not from the Congress members and their agents, on his system of land-tax and forest laws, &c, provided it comes from them in some corner of a political platform, somewhere in Liverpool or Manchester. But he will never \u2014 not for any amount \u2014 stand un mot mauvais on the platform of Europe, especially if it happens to come from an Indian. This sort of oversensitive ness has led to his hatred of me, and the hatred has in time worked itself into a delusion, the drole effects of which are, that he sees in me (an obscure mendiant, living in a corner of Bombay, and where not even a buggy or victoria driver would even care to notice me) \u2014 a regular B \u2014 d \u2014 y Fenian, danger ous to be let loose in Europe and ought to be chased back to India, by any possible or feasible device. I am sure it is only the delusion, which leads liim to look upon me, magnified as it were into another Dhuleep Singh. I can easily understand why he is so down on me, with all his crushing might and influence in the cities of Europe, through the agency of the various British Consulates, scattered over the continent. I believe and I have strong reasons for so believing, that I first began to see my friend's finger, the moment my ship touched Messina, \u2014 the first European port. For my part I like this subject to go into the oblivion of the past, and I hope the countrymen of my rulers of India, living on the continent of Europe, will for the sake of their own country's reputation, as a great Asiatic"], [115, "99 power (as Sir Grant Duff once called it) divest themselves of such delusions. To me personally, it matters little, if as a victim of their delusion, I am pousse jusqu' au la mort in Europe. I would sooner prefer repose in the Pere la Chaise of Paris, than a niche in the Towers of Silence of my native city \u2014 my ever beloved Bombay. I am sure, and have been so all along, that truth will triumph in the end ; and time alone will cool down his rage, howsoever late it may be, and pull my friend out of the awkward position, into which he has allowed himself to be drifted by his simple or frank nature. He will see his mistake ere long, I am sure. For I see he has (since my arrival here) just begun to see it.

My dear Pesikaka, \u2014 Your \" wine and woman \" friend is now here and writes a letter from board a steamship on his way to Ostend. European civilization and European life, with"], [118, "102 all its intellectual surroundings act so powerfully, as a ferment to my mind, that I know not how to express to you my feelings of depression and sorrow at leaving Europe so very early. No more of the continental riot in Angleterre, and both in Scotland and Birmingham, I saw such passive expressions of hatred and dislike of me, that I moved there with perfect ease and freedom. The half Himalayan almost Kashmir-like scenery round about tho Queen's Castle ground, between Ballater and Braemar, had charmed my worried mind, and I cannot describe to you how I cursed the two provincial Anglais \u2014 husband and wife \u2014 for driving me out of that quiet place (Mrs. McNabb's, Hotel of Fife Arms), where I had only passed two nights, and had one day made a good walking tour of about 12 miles with a Scotch guide, and a pint of sherry and a packet of sandwiches in hand. I felt I was no more in our John Bull's Isle of brouillard et parapluie, but was either in Kashmir or on Jallaphar at Darjeeling. I was a week or 10 days late in England. I had originally intended to go there from my Sage-femme's Maison d' Accouchement on September 20th. But I had to wait anxiously for my \" metallic force,\" without which it is not possible to move or even to livo in Europe. I write this with my half heart in London where the last sight I enjoyed last night was a grand ballet in a new varieties House, called \" Empire,\" (which is a regular opposition shop to our old and favourite Alhambra) and the other half in Bombay. I every moment feel that it will be very difficult for me, to get again reconciled to what I call my Hindoo Use. For it is a real life to me in the country of the Hindoos. India I look upon as no more my country, \u2014 or as the French would say my \" Palrie.\" It is quite unsuited to our physique and our mental capacity. But it can't be helped. God's will has placed our people among a lot of Hindoos and Moslems, who were it not for our \" metallic force\" i.e., our prosperity and our intelligence, would soon kick us out."], [119, "103 Well, I am off the tangent again, in this rolling boat, writing standing in the office room of the ticket clerk, with my feet and fingers half -deadened by cold. So I come to my theme again. I had almost decided on my way from Birmingham to London to prolong my stay in England, till Xmas at least. Winter is the real time for picking up flesh and force, and I was about to telegraph to my Banquier, our friend, to send me the equivalent of another 4 per cent, paper. But two frothy incidents have led me to alter my plan completely. One was in the Covent Garden Opera House, where a steaming bully wanted to threaten me or to cut me, and whose action reminded me the Varsovie Theatre incident. The other was a regular gush of steam or froth, from a regular ramollisement cerebral type, seated in the dining saloon of the Grand Hotel, opposite to me. These civilized people invariably act by hints. They never abuse or assault a person, but by their insinuations and hints give him to understand that \" you are an unpleasant man to us ; you must go back to your country or your home.\" I calmly and quietly in my bed reflected the various pros and cons of the whole affair, that night, and decided to be out of sight and out of mind of my John Bull. I came up to his maison commerciale et industrielle, not because I am a commercial man, not because I look any more to parchment (Diplomes and Titles) ; not for my love of science or art ; but only to allow myself to be seen by him, and to give him by my actual presence in his own house, a chance oi fudging me for himself, with his own eyes and ears open, .in his own way. I have seen London sufficiently, and cared not to see any more of it ; except to enjoy some pretty faces there and to amuse myself in a country, whose language we speak as if it were our own. Rightly judged, it was the highest compliment I could pay him; pay to myself, and also to give thereby a silent kick to my or theatrical man. Notwithstanding all this 1 find the delusion still persisting. I should rather say it has receded to its former points, \u2014 hatred and over -sensitiveness to"], [120, "104 criticism. In fact, a knowing old crow like myself (one who could easily see below the surface especially in matters con cerning me) saw distinctly, that my Anglais's mind still oscillates between hatred of me and over-sensitiveness. So I came to the conclusion, better to be soon out of his sight and out of his mind and leave the rest to time, to let the situation find or gravitate of itself, to its own natural or normal level. My Anglais is a regular busy-body. He is what I prefer call ing my \"Time-is-money\" man, and I doubt if time would do much, i. e., had I stayed until Xmas, my relations with him would have much improved. I was on the eve of finding a good airy chambre, where I could be librc, as I was iu 1879-80 in Paris, * * * * * and I was about to enter my chambre meublee say next Monday. But as is always the case with me \u2014 there is always a slip between the cup and the lip, and here I am again upsetting all my plans and ideas. Had I stayed, in some six weeks' time I should have drafted a nice Diary in the shape of Souvenirs of my European tour, \u2014 of course taking good care not to hint at all to this uglg matter. Were I ever to do so, it would be a regular blot to my work and a hinge to hang upon for my critics. Up to last evening, when I bought my Rail ticket from Cook the Tourist, I was half inclined to spend about two weeks more on the continent. But a very sensible and pithy letter from my good intelligent mother, and it is the only one I have seen, since leaving Bombay July 10, has induced me to run down quick to Bombay, and without even going to Frank fort or Munich or some part of Switzerland, round about the St. Gothard Pass. I have decided to proceed direct from Koln to Genoa, thence I'll be sailing by the N. German Lloyd \u2014 veiy fast boats, and about which Mr. Willrich, of Ditmar & Co., the Lamp warehouse firm, corner of Church Street in Bombay, who was a passenger with me to Genoa, was talking veiy favourably. Returning so early, I prefer paying my own pas sage, to going as a mendiant in my old slow tubS.S. Singapore."], [121, "105 The German boat is due at Genoa, Nov. '27th, and if I miss that, I'll take the Trieste or Austrian Lloyd. I have you know travelled by those aristocratic boats of our Anglais (the P. & O.) 2ce ; twice by the French boats and once by the Italian, and with my ever-restless disposition and love for new scenes and new faces I like to voyage by either of these lines, and will directly I sail inform you people by telegraph.

After all, my White Baby has not found the Barnum's show a profitable concern. He made good capital of it in Central Europe, but in Russia the show was a total failure. In Paris the wasp was squeezed sufficiently in 1881, and when he gave in turn a good sting there. My White Baby's Agent residing in Downing StreetvLoudon, had the show sent tothe Caledonian Castle,\u2014 but as the Chimpanzee was not provided with a regular Court Dress, he could not be presented ; and the lady in charge was heard to say in the exit door of Aberdeen Station, that \" they have given him up.\"! What a malheur, for my poor monkey, who is now sent back or rather comes back with C\u00e6sar's motto \" Vcni, vidi, vici\" on his chapeau. CYRUS. No. 5. Port Said, 2nd November 1890, Sunday. Nordde.utscher Lloyd S.S. Sachsen. My dear Pesikaka, \u2014 Our Professor Sylvester's favourite, \" the great Doctor Viccaji \" is coming to Bombay some 15 or 18 days hence. My White Baby has given him, or I should say, ai-med him, with a grand certificate of Lunacy, signed by his own Savants and Special Alienist Doctors. You should indeed like to know, who these are and what are the qualifications of my White Baby's savants, to certify as to the Lunacy (and that too of an order or kind \" past all remedies\") of the person so well known to everybody and in eveiy part of Bombay, and I should say all the principal cities of India. These are, 1*/, the Police of Berlin (in August). Ind. The garcons or waiters of the Cafes and Restaurants of Paris and London, 'ird. The Cabbies of London. 4th. The street-girls of the Strand and Charing Cross. b/h. The London Bully and the London Cockney. 6th. The what I should prefer calling \" Gentlemen Parvenues\" and \" Rotten Rows\" of the respectable places of public resort in London,"], [123, "107 such as the salons of the Grand Hotel, I was in, and the Opera house and Theatres of London. Even my White Baby's \" Lady Doctors\" came out so eagerly to sign the certificate of Lunacy of the \" great Dr. V.\" of Professor Sylvester, that although I cannot identify them by name, though they were dining with me in the same Salle-a-manger of the Grand Hotel, London ; but to some of whom I would meet in the Theatres and in fauteuils worth half guinea each,\u2014 it will suffice for you to know that these \"Lady Doctors\" \u2014 experts in the subject oi maladies mentales are of the same class and intelligence, which is represented by the girl \" Betsy \" in Thackeray's \" Vanity Fair.\" Some of these 1 shotdd like to group in my class of \" Stinking Jupons.\" I may now proceed to tell you the grounds upon which they have founded their opinion of the Lunacy of your friend the Doctor. Of course the reasons of Insanity were furnished to the aforesaid savants a,ni experts by my White Baby, confined to his Bureau chambre in some corner of Downing Street and where the offices of the \" Ministere des Indes \" are located. The reasons are briefly these : That he, the said Dr. V. being a British Indian subject, did intentionally and wilfully and maliciously malign and vilify and defame John Bull in the capital city of his neighbours on the other side of the water, in the year of grace 1881. 2nd. That he, the said Dr. V. in this his third tour to Europe went to Russia, to persuade the Russians to undertake an invasion of India, and to wrench our John Bull's conquest of that countiy of the Hindoos, out of his hands. 3rd. That he went to Berlin and Koningsberg to judge which nation's soldier looks better, more formidable and more strong than my John Bull's soldier. These and such other reasons, \u2014 not possible to divine, as most of them are not yet out of my White Baby's admirable brain \u2014 have led him to apply to his savants and experts on Insanity, to certify as to the lunacy of your friend Dr. V. and to chase him out of Europe. In fact, he had made up his mind, the moment that"], [124, "108 Dr. V. set his feet on European soil, and did try his utmost to pull his legs down, the moment he went eastward of Frank fort-on-the-Maine. It seems he had made up his mind over since 1881. His neighbour, the wily \"Frog-eater\" (in whose theatre my White Baby takes his Autumual and Summer holidays, and to whose good words and adulation he attaches a great importance, for to him \" Paris\" is all Europe, and what is said of him and done in Paris is to him, as it were, said and done in all Europe) it seems to me, has studied his ivealc points extremely well ; he (the cunning nervous typed, wide-awake French man) knows thoroughly his neighbour John Bull's right and wrong ends. He had only to tap my John's wrong ends and to set the ball rolling. This he succeeded in doing so very admirably, ever since my departure from Paris in 1881, that my White Baby of Downing Street brooded over the whole affair ; and brooding, brooding, he went into Melancholia, and the Melancholia got hold of his childish brain so strongly that it became a real Delusion, \u2014 the sort of Delusion which is indicated in the \"many reasons of Lunacy,\" jotted down in his great London certificate. Armed with this sort of high and unimpeachable certificate, your friend is coming to Bombay, and you will be good enough to secure, as early as possible, nice rooms in the Asylum of Bombay. Mind they should be very clean and airy rooms. No matter if the Asylum clerk charges Rs. 10 per diem. His bill will be paid by White Baby's cashier in London, of course not without any endorsement on the part of the malade patient. Fun and humour apart, I may now assure you that the per usal of half a dozen Books called the John Bull series, or the view some dozens of times of the so-called caricatures or Panto mime Anglais, in Paris, and which were shown and explained to your learned friend, the Dr. V. by his Chere Amie of Boulevard St. Germain ******* an(t even my association with him in his own country (Angleterre) for some months"], [125, "109 during the years 1875-76 and 1879-80-81, could never have shown me my John Bull, in the manner I have now seen him. Calmly and dispassionately considered, I am inclined to think there is something rotten in the man. Of course, I don't mean to blame the entire nation, for the faults of a few deluded. But looking to the way in which he magnified me, and entertained his suspicions about me, I cannot help but calling him a regular childish man, wanting in moral sense and at times even in what we call common sense, tact and judgment in his relations with me. As I have told you before in many of my letters from Paris and London, that I should certainly think his country men in India are men of a much superior calibre, possess more of sense, judgment and tact, and not one of them woidd even be tray himself in that childish way in which he behaved with me and that too on the very last night of my stay in London. All my thought that night was so absorbed in Bombay and in my mother, that I could hardly relish the splendid grand Ballet in the Empire Theatre, where some 60 or 80 lovely faces, with fat legs (not the fiddlestick legs of the Petite Parisiennes) and many with noses of the true type of handsome Anglaises, were dancing and the sight of which Ballet is not likely to vanish easily out of my mind \u2014 even in our stinking and ugly Bombay. And I soon returned to my hotel, where I utilised my spare time \u2014 before retiring to bed \u2014 on the 6th floor of the Grand Hotel, in writing a hasty letter to my brother-in-law in Cal cutta. I cannot describe to you how my suspicious greenhorn of a John Bull was chafed at my writing letters to India ; and many respectable men and women (whom I should never call well-bred gentlemen and ladies, although they were in a place and in a building \u2014 the Reading room of the Grand Hotel) began to cry out, \"Al-Ho! the Drole is coming out very strong,\" &c. &c. A man like me \u2014 who is a perfect master of maladies mentales and whom travel, observing and criticising disposition has given him such a command over \" men and"], [126, "110 manners \" of the world, that he can soon look below the surface of things,\u2014 oi course did not mind at all and allowed my dogs to bark as they liked and quickly jotted down a long letter to my brother-in-law and posted it. Even on this boat, a German boat, he constantly shows me his hand ; but when I came on board the vessel, and even long before that, I have given my deluded friend of Downing Street a free carte blanche. He does not know that I am a pupil of one of his own countrymen \u2014 I refer to a Trinity College Dublin man, and like him (though at times touchy and toujours of nervous temperament) I am a regular Ice Bag. This will do for you to-day. Read it to all our friends at tho Ripon Club, and be amused and amuse others. While penning it, I am too much amused and enjoy the fun of writ ing such things.

That title goes quite in the shade before the certificates and addresses I have received and am still receiving and perhaps some more are yet in store for me in India \u2014 from my White Baby of Downing Street, London, where is located the Bureau ofthe \"Ministere deslndes.\" Read my very amusing letter I have just penned to my Australian Pet \u2014 a long amusing; letter ; and if you show him this letter, I am sure he will have no objection to spare it to you for perusal, and when you get it, do not fail to read it to our Colonel. I have already posted"], [128, "112 him a card yesterday, and which I have handed to the clerk of the Boat for posting in the Egyptian Post Office at Port Said. I am glad you are now moving for a German class. I have been hammering at it ever since last year. But you people took no heed of my advice and started in my absence an Italian class. I may tell you now after my recent experience of Europe, that the Italian language is just like the Italian Bank Note. Nobody norlh of the Alps ever care to take from your hand* Italian Paper; and like it, nobody would ever en re to speak the Italian language. Even the French is being shoved,\u2014 of course gradually, to a corner ; and the Language of modern Europe \u2014 Europe Ccntralc \u2014 is soon to be la langue Allemande. I have heard it spoken in Swiss Rail ways, in RuBsia, and all throughout, of course, in Germany in preference to French. The German is the man of future Europe, The abdominal type of the German represented by the Bavarians &c. has given way to the superior intellectual force and brain of the nervous type Prussian, and the old disunited Germany is now no longer so. The man of muscle and force goes hand and glove with the man of brain and intellect. All arc united under the banner of \" Vaterland\" and I would not be surprised that long before our Colonel takes his Diplome of the Faculty of Medicine de Paris (of which he is so fond and which I should certainly encourage him to do \u2014 for reasons to be stated on' some future occasion), if another guerre Allemande-Franco, this time and not Franco -Allemande of 1870 breaks out; already tho chauffage has commenced ; and the partition of Holland like the Luxembourg Question is on the tapis. My boy or young Kaiser only requires to get his brain heated ; to have once at least what Napoleon III. called the \" Baptism of Fire.\" Bismark is shelved, that is a ruse ; another such ruse is the foolish talk of making Alsace and Lorraine a little republican buffer state. This is a bait to the Theatrical man, and the one great weak trait in a Frenchman is bis readiness to accept any bait put before him.

Anger and Fort would say that I have carried out in its fullest sense their countryman's remark or taunt directed against me viz. \" . I Stait chez Bis?nark.\" Ii last time in 1880, I avoided Berlin, though I was at Frankfort and Miinchen, it was simply out of policy \u2014 with a view not to wound his feelings. But as the beggar turned round and wanted to chase me out of his city in 1881, on account of my French These, I was bound by no consideration to respect his feelings and I did write a long letter to Anger from Berlin. I found it not a city of sable and casernes, as I was told in Paris in 1880 but a second Paris \u2014 which in no time, owing to its central position \u2014 if not geographical \u2014 at least as a politi cal and military centre of modern Europe, will be a great rival of Paris and will pull it down deservedly. It is some such considerations which have given me a powerful impulse to study the German Language. I know what progress I had made in my French, while on the Messageries S.S. Anadyr in 1876, and in S.S. Ava in 1881. But unfortunately for memy Anglais \u2014 I mean not the Anglais of India but some deluded beggar of the India Office or in some British Consulate (as I was told in London) has put me, ever since my arrival here into such a bad odour with this principal nation of Europe, that I don't think I can expect from the German passengers on board the ship, the same degree of bien aise and interest which the French showed me in 1876, and which alone then encouraged me to prosecute the study of that language after my return to India. You all know well that the first Crow who earnestly took up the study of the French Language was your honest and energetic and Europe-loving friend, Dr. Viccaji ; and I am sure it seems to me, that this time too the credit or the 8"], [130, "114 honour of setting an example to our countrymen, for learning another great Modern or living language of Europe\u2014 the Ger man, is going to fall to my lot. Tan/ miittx. Now a word to amuse you, as for the Tippoo Saheb title. He is coming, and will not demand of his Bombay friends to turn up at the Apollo Bunder with music and Tom -Toms. For every day from sunrise to midnight, my White Baby of Down ing Street has arranged for a good selection of \" Hungarian Valses\" and \" Hungarian Dances \" danced before him, \u2014 even in Bismark's boat and by Bismark's countrymen, by regular Experts, in the art of dancing the Hungarian tunes. Who these are ? and what class of men they are ? \u2014 I have no time left to tell you. But to an \" Old Shoe \" (as one stink ing Jupon \" here called me) like me,- who has minutely studied and road the most able work of Dr. Duchenne de Bou logne, on the Physiognomy of Expression, and who can read the action of the Muscles of Expression on the face of every man or woman, it does not take long to know and to understand these my Hungarian Valse Dancers in the North German Lloyd S.

I will telegraph my arrival there and I am sure you will hear of it from my Ma. You must pardon me for not writing to you oftener, in this my third European tour."], [131, "115 But I am so very busy in crushing and conquering the delu- sion of our Madame Anglaise, that I hardly had time left to see and to enjoy life in lovely Europe. I wish you were with me this time, just as we were together in Paris and Brighton, and chez Haxell's\u2014 to see and to judge with your own eyes what a contemptible figure our John Bidl or as the French justly call him, the excentrique Anglais cut in the Boulevards of Paris for the first four nights of my stay there. The French caricature him and show his eccentricities in manner, in his dress, talk, pose, and what uot. I have often seen my simpleton and sea- girt Anglais figure in the Grand Opera and other Theatres of Paris, with his chequered Overcoat on, and a smoking cap on his head, \u2014 both of which he would like to keep on his person and walk or promenade in the Foyer during the entr'actes, and once I well remember un gendarme or guard stationed there bring our Master \" Bundle -of -odd -sticks \" to his senses by asking and actually insisting upon him taking off his eccentric \" chapeau\" (a regular skull cap) and behaving well in the presence of ladies. Strongly prejudiced as I was during my 18 months of continuous stay in Paris, against my White Baby, and smart- ing under a grave provocation and my own personal grievances against the man, \u2014 I could never have conceived that an Eng- lishman would in his own house show or betray himself to me, an Indian, his fellow subject, in such a contemptible and disgusting way as I found him. And notwithstanding the very high opinion I still entertain of his commercial instinct, of his industry, of his honesty, of his frankness and many other qualities \u2014 I, after all, have now come to see a black side of him, which has led me (and through me means all intelligent India) to suspect that there is something rotten, something very shaky in the man and which does not augur well for his distant future. We all know that his nation has never given to the world a Napoleon or a C\u00e6sar or an Alexander, and not even men of the modern gene- ration, I mean not one like the late king of Prussia -Emperor William I., the grandfather of the present man, whose life I"], [132, "116 have read ; not one statesman of the calibre and brain of Bis mark, or one warrior like the aged Von Moltke. Not one Thiers or Mons. De Giers has our Anglais been able to show us. There could not be a greater shuttle-cock going among his liv ing statesmen than the old Home Rule man, Gladstone. His Irish dirty clothes he keeps washing ever since the last de cade, and as yet no end of it. And all this why and wherefore? It is simply because the nation Anglais, as the French author of \" L'Angleterre Politique et Sociale\" has truly remarked, is a nation mixed \u2014 born of a mixture of many races, the Angles, Jutes, Normans, Saxons, Danes, and many others mentioned therein. Although he poses chez nous as the true type of \" European,\" and every white-faced Eurasian Dog, man or woman, woidd like to be classed among the \" Europeans \" too, I could distinctly see that he is as much removed from the bright and shrewd classes of the nervous typed European family \u2014 I mean the Russians, Germans (=Prussians) and the French, as a low caste Hindoo is from a Brahmin Hindoo. Were it not for the grace, intelligence, charm and non -affectation of his wife, les femmes Anglais, I know not where my John Bull would be. His wife keeps him going and helps him\u2014 at least tries to keep him \u2014 my \"Time-is-money\" man, floating on a par, level with the leading nations of Europe. It is she that has taught our \" rough and tough\" John some lessons of what is called ' savoir vivre,' it is she who has instilled in him the modern \u00c6sthetic taste, it is she who rules his home (fire-side) and his hie politique. Where our soft-brained Dutch governor would have been, had it not been for his Madame... sharp, shrewd and far-seeing as she was. I never had any chance of conversing with her ; but I used to read and observe care fully what she said and did in Bombay. For my part, I have completely given up the man,- \u2014 to me his vie sociale et politique can have no more interest now. I have studied it almost with a natural fondness, \u2014 enough, and I shall have no more of it. He has completely belied my high opinion of him. I look upon"], [133, "117 him as a contemptible creature not worth notice, wanting in sense (common sense as well as moral sense), judgment, tact, and tout d fait child-like. On my return to India, a couple of weeks hence, in whatever I may do and say I will make no mention \u2014 not a mot bon or mauvais of him and of his cities. I'll never forgive and forget the beggar for all his insensate acts, owing to which all my enjoyment of life in Europe has been marred and embittered ; and until I (D. V. ) again chance to revisit Europe and to enjoy its civilized pleasures and life to my heart's content once more, I don't think I'll cease to curse him. Even if I was a Prince in India (which I would not like to be) I could not have returned his \" kicks\" \u2014 his deluded kicks to me; tit-for-tat is impossible and out of the question. We all know what the silent curses of a widow or an innocent man mean, and how Almighty God wreaks his vengeance upon the oppressor of the innocent and helpless. Now from the serious to the humorous part of my letter. Mon vieux monsieur, your \"vieux avare\" is coming. You can tell Jal \u2014 my Duke of Dong ree that his \"Hero\" is coming, \u2014 once more to play the chess tournament with him at his Chess club. It was Jal who had called me, I believe, \" Hero\" one evening, when my name was so much noised about in the English and Vernacular papers of the whole of India \u2014 of Lahore, Calcutta, Madras and Poona, in connection with my Anti- Congress letters to the Bombay Gazette. That veiy Hero has the misfortune or rather I should say the exceptional good fortune oi starringhimseii, as the B \u2014 d \u2014 y Fenian, \"qui haieles Anglais et qui va tuer les Anglais\" in Europe, I mean the leading capitals of Europe. All this simply out of what I have essayed to make clear to you people, a true form of Delusion Anglais. Our Jar's Hero has checkmated his deluded Anglais and had once before and now the second time checkmated the conceited and vain Ecole de M.dicine man; and I look upon it as a great source of pride and pleasure to me to have so successfully checkmated ma femme Francaise et ma femme"], [134, "118 Anglaisr \u2014 although T cannot checkmate my Duke of Dongroe, but may often get pawn -mated by him. The Suez Canal is now navigated at nights too, under electric light, and the whole system was well explained to me by the Italian Captain, who took me to his bridge and gave me a lot of information about the system of canal navigation. And I am now thinking if I can utilise all that information in the shape of a splendid public lecture to our people at the Framjee Institute. I know the history of the Suez Canal, from Lord Palmerston to Dizzy's tenure of office in my White Baby's Chambre, and I think I can make of it all, a good public entry in Bombay, and thus give a silent but indirect kick to my White Baby and astonish him. * * * * Thank God once more I am in the country of the Hindoos, with my brain galvanized or rather Europeanised, and this time, thanks to my White Baby, and my deluded femme Anglaise, made more wide-awake, more observing, more critical and less frank than what it was before.

Up to Port Said I was accommodated for \" want of space\" (?) in Cabin No. 1 on the spar Deck (1st class) ; from Port Said, to cabin berth No. 31 ; this again from Suez to cabin berth No. 36. The last was at my request \u2014 as I disliked"], [135, "119 for special reasons of my own to be in one cabin with an old polisson looking short Anglais or Australian or I know not what nationality, who on the veiy first evening of oui- sailing began to put to me certain inquisitive questions, while dining, with an affectation and vanity on his face which I only tolerated on a ship like this ; but would never have tolerated on shore. I ob jected to this man's threatening language to me the very next morning of my transference from Cabin (No. 1 berth) to cabin No. 31 berth. Now look what happens. I am vis-d-vis the same old polisson's face in another five berth Cabin, where with a powerfully glaring electric light shining on my face, and the brute surreptitiously casting his glances at me. I care nota jotfor such travellers. There is, however, one consolation, that in the same chambre there is a young German lad \u2014 a quite innocent sort of fellow. I had hardly three hours sound sleep last night, \u2014 with my mind half in Europe and half in Bombay,\u2014 for I am now as it were midway between the two places. I have taken two aloes pills this morning, and if by this evening the beggar Gri maidt's pills act, I'll be happy and feel easy. With an unsympa thetic surrounding on board \u2014 this the only time of all my voyages to Europe, I am obliged to confine myself to my books, or to while away my time in writing amusing letters \u2014 half amusing, half regretting or rather cursing my White Baby. The more calmly and dispassionately I think of his stupid pranks, and of the role he played in all the leading cities of Europe as the chief \" PoU-Comedie \" actor (I am using Dr. Anger's and the Greek Doctors expression), I am naturally led to the conclusion that there is something rotten, something shaky, something \u25a0wrong in the moral side of our Anglais ; and which as I said in my letter penned yesterday to my Rothschild and already posted, does not augur well for his future. In his be haviour with me you will have seen the attack was entirely unprovoked, unjustified, and quite out of all reckoning, more especially when his and my mutual relationship is borne in mind. If I had a good work on Psychology at hand, such as"], [136, "120 Maudsley's Physiology and Pathology of the Mind or Tuck and Bur-knell's volumes, I am sure, I could reason out the problem and conclusively demonstrate to any sound thinker, that what I here aver is to a very great extent quite tho proper thing. He evidently wanted to imitate the Paris Ecole de Medecine men, \u2014 fancying that was the proper and the only successful way of chasing me out of Em-ope. The French had some sort of rea son and justification in getting irritated at a Thesis, to which unfortunately for me my name happened to be joined; and their sou or drole trick was confined chiefly to their own quarter. But with my deluded White Baby, his imitation of the \" article de Paris\" extended further \u2014 beyond his sea-girt isle, and into the veiy hearts of the capitals of his rivals \u2014 Russians and Ger mans. Take my word, another Gibbon will be required \u2014 one cannot say how many decades hence \u2014 to write another history of the decline and fall of my White Baby's Empire. His isle does not require to be besieged ; his giant city does not require to be ransacked. If its commercial prosperity is gone, finished, Cest assez. The Yankee pulls at it from the Atlantic side ; and his beau-frh-e the German from the European side. I had a talk with Dr. Anger, a couple of days after my entry into Paris about London and its commercial status ; and he too was of the same idea as mine. He regretted that his neighbours, les Allemands, se font riche and va partout, manufacture and trade on a more extensive scale than his own countrymen. This very nation, the German \u2014 has now its turn to go up the ladder. Things are looking up with the Germans; I have been observing that since my last European tour. As yet it is in its infancy. A few years hence \u2014 say 40 or 50 and our Bismark will occupy the same position as Napoleon the Ire. did in the last century, and like Napoleon, a future Kaiser-Allemand will be Master of Europe. The child (Allemand) is still not grown up into manhood. Let him expand and grow and deve lop, and as we have often seen and heard \" History shall repeat itself. \""], [137, "121 I pity my honest John Bull. He does not see or face the situation as he ought to or as a foreigner like us would like him to do. Oui- Wbite Baby is so unthinking, so unconscious or wanting in confidence of his own strength and ability, so very unthinking, so much wanting in judgment, that he sees in Russia his future rival in Asia. From the very little I have seen of Russia (and if I could not see this White Bear, half European and half Asiatic, half civilized and half barbarian power more thoroughly, I must thank our stupid White Baby for it) I am sure it is an actual \" Colossus of Clay \" \u2014 as described once by a war correspondent in the late Russo- Tui-kish war. Russia to invade India,\" and to invade it success fully as to conquer it, \u2014 is it seems to me a pure delusion Anglais. Another delusion like the one and almost on a line with the one with which he has been down on me in Europe. Lots to be said on this question. But no time. I fancy if there is to be any European rival of my White Baby - \u2014 and that too both in his commercial, political and military relations, \u2014 it will be this \" Butcher of the Rhine. \" This is the man of the future. And once he is a master of all Europe [Russia (European) excluded, but sufficiently humiliated and controlled by him] like Napoleon I. he, i. e., some future Von Bismark, will naturally turn his attention to Angleterre, if not to invade it and to conquer it, at least to snatch from our white \" Perfidious Albion \" its commercial superiority and all that is linked with it \u2014 viz. its colonial possessions and conquests. Canada and Australia will soon claim to be \" amputated \" and my John Bull may expand his \" India \" \u2014 (the country of the Hindoos) as much as he likes \u2014 from China to Persia or Mesopotamia, he will not be able to reap that advantage and profit fronrhis Asiatic conquests, which one would naturally expect of him to reap after a great sacrifice or shedding of his blood and force. It is such ideas I wanted to work up and to expand in Lon don had I remained there, after some more of sight-seeing."], [138, "122 But thanks to my Greenhorn White Baby, he has saved me a good round sum of money. I have already spent from August to this day somewhere between \u00a3210 and \u00a3215, and had I prolonged my stay, to get myself more in touch with him, to cast off my French coat and to get freshly fiance with my femme Anglaise, I am sure my Budget total would have amounted to \u00a3400. AM this I have saved and what is more, a calm and dispassionate reflection on his acts, has led me to come to one grateful conclusion, and that is to divest myself entirely from my sympathies with his vie sociale et politique. I'll hang his India, hang his Parliament aud hang his wars ; and my future motto will be \u2014 as it has for ever been \u2014 to enjoy life and its blessings, to the utmost possible extent to which God has enabled me to do. Dinner bell is striking and so I must stop now.* ************ Adieu, Yours affectionately, CYRUS. No. 11. Norddeutscher Lloyd, Dampfer Sachsen ; Friday, 7th November 1890. Red Sea, 5th day, about 400 miles from Aden. My dear Pesikaka, \u2014 My invariable maxim is \" First Business and then Pleasure, \" so I begin this my last letter to you from Europe (for in a European boat, and with European passengers and in my European costume \u2014 I believe myself though in the fierce heat of the Red Sea to be still in Europe 1 with a few business items, and then will try to amuse you all with my comic and un petit pen original pen. I have seen Europe this the 3rd time, and have passed the Suez Canal, this the 5th time, and I believe I can utilise all my knowledge and experience of Europe and its attractions and sights by giving a few popular lectures to our people in our language. I am just revolving in my mind what sort of lecture to give to the class of audience we get in the Framji"], [139, "123 Institute. A dry lecture, saying Frankfort, or Berlin or Mos cow possesses so many inhabitants, so many theatres, tram cars, &c, will not do. I would make it quite interesting and intel ligible for ordinary men, and mix it with many humorous sketches of the scenes and people I have seen, so as to excite the interest of even the half -educated but reading classes. I am sure I could not better celebrate my entry into Bombay once more, after a very \" Grand tour du Monde Europeen,\" than by some such appearance before the Parsee and Gujrathi Hindoo public at the Framji Institute. I should have preferred bring ing with me a nice magic lantern to illustrate the cities and scenes by oxy-hydrogenic projection. But I don't know how to curse my stupid and deluded White Baby for upsetting all my calcula tions and plans. I am satisfied now that in going to upset me he has upset himself ; in trying to expose me, he has exposed himself. I can easily imagine what sort of figure he must now be cutting in the Courts of Russia and Berlin in trying to befool them, just as he was befooled by the French (ever since 1881). He has now ample time left to sleep on the pillow of his delusion and to calculate the total amount of pounds and pence he has wasted in keeping a regular surveillance on me, all pour rien ; in moving the Courts of his own neighbouring powers to look after the movements of an Indian bete, and a \" Fenian \" at heart. On the very second day of my entiy into Paris, Dr. Anger gave me a practical hint, and by which I soon smelt the rat throughout. He said \" you know all well, you are not a child, fust wait, my friend, for a week, and all will be quiet.\" He kept asking me, however, when I was about to start for London, and that he should like to accom pany me. I at once saw it was once more the old game of 1881,\u2014 \"the Dreyfous Thesis Riot,\" which made me a regu lar stinking pot in the nose of every French Ecole de Mede cine man, and I should say the entire Quartier Latin and through them many French Parisians. And what do you think. I did. I knew the weak traits in French character, and"], [140, "124 profiting by my previous experience of this my theatric-al man and mendiant and m , I said, \" I hate London ; I have had enough of it, I will not go there; if I go, I will only be there for three or four days to arrange for my financial matter, and the bait I held out to him was that I will be staying in Paris for full two months or more, studying Pasteur's methods, perhaps till Xnias (Noel) and this bait the m accepted at once; and I cannot tell you the fun I enjoyed of him, and how I was laughing under my sleeves, when this Jew Francais (for his name is Benjamin Anger) was introducing me to every Frenchman he used to meet on the road, or the Grand Opera, or at the hotel, saying this is Dr. Viccaji de Bombay, he likes (il aime) Paris so much (il est ami particulaire de mon Patron de maison) that ilvarester d Paris fusqu'au le fin de Novembre, &e. leven engaged a room by the month in a hotel of his own choice and nomination and the price of which he himself had settled. I knew directly my Greenhorn of a John Bull, who every night and morning used to make an exhibition of himself in the Boulevards of Paris and its cafes and restaurants, and I was sure that he, while running me (down) a la mode fanatique there, little knew that the wily French dog was at the bottom of the mischief, and that it was he who enjoyed the fun most \u2014 directly this my simpleton gets cooled down, I'll be finding my way to London, and there take up the entire question, of what I deservedly have termed \" Delusion Anglais.\" But my White Baby would not see through, would not trouble his mind and his thinking powers (should he have any and I am sure he has, but they were damped or masked completely by his delusion). For, had he just tried to see below the surface of things, and taken me into his confidence, he would have been spared a large amount of trouble and exposition of himself. \" Done is done,\" he can no longer undo it. But, look here, the whole matter remains on the record of time. Had he but washed liis dirty clothes in his own sea-girt island (after allowing me to enter it, as I had"], [141, "125 originally intended to do via Hambourg from Berlin, and that was my original programme of tour) \u2014 he should not have had to suffer that humiliation which he has now to face. He may hang anybody he likes now for all this ugly mistake of his ; \u2014 r for there is no more blundering dog going in the whole of Europe \u2014 I mean northern Europe, Europe of the leading Euro pean nations, \u2014 or he may not hang ; but after all with me it is a moral conviction in my mind, that my Greenhorn has cut his own nose with his own hands, and by his own knife \u2014 manufac tured perhaps in his own cutlery warehouse, Sheffield. This of itself is a sufficient recompense for me. Thank God, I was not a coward, and did not follow the cowardly advice of Dadabhoy Naoroji, of \"going back to India\" or \" take no notice\" \u2014 (so he wrote to me from London), and I boldly went to my John Bull's Isle \u2014 moved shoulder to shoulder with him, lived in his first class hotel (the Grand Hotel), used nightly to dine at his Table d'Hote, where every lady and many sweet and lovely but innocent faces \u2014 kept gazing at me ; and every gentleman, and some \"Rotten Rows\" there were in the lot \u2014 kept gazing at me, as if I was a great man, \u2014 the \" Red Rag \" of my White Baby. After all, your friend Cyrus is the grandson of a noble-hearted man, the true blood of his ancestors still runs in his veins ; he is honest and sound jet (both in body and mind) to every inch of his body, \u2014 and he has and did actually defy every unit of Anglais and every one of his agents in Germany and Russia to pousser him au misere, i.e., to mortify him and make him miser able ; in short to boycott him out of Europe by running him down as a mad -cap, a sou, a drole, and what not! I assure you that no nation of Europe did ever raise his finger against me or dare touch or molest me in Europe in my costume European, and so long as I behaved as an homme comme Us aut. For I believe myself as much an Anglais, as an Anglais is himself ; being his subject, trained and educated by him, and squandering the gold bearing his own Sovereign's stamp. I have often seen how much a German is dreaded, \u2014 a German"], [142, "126 traveller I mean, wherever he goes, oat a sold dare molest him. Not even on the French Boat M. M. by which I had travelled, nor on French soil. Even the small mendiant Mr. who was a passenger with me in the Italian boat, was not at all touched or a word said against him or against his nation by the Anglais and Italians and the Americans on board uotwith - standing his many eccentricities. Once I was talking with Dr. and Mrs. M on the heavy German cuisine and other German subjects; directly they would sight W coming, the topic was at once changed. Next to the German, the man must dreaded is the Anglais, and after him the Russe. I recollect how I used to pose as a riche Anglais in the Como lakes aud Varese hotels and in Suisse and even on the Rhine \u2014 during my first tour in Europe, when I spent 9,000 rupees in 9 months. In my second tour from Paris via Rhine and Frankfort to Miinchen and Vienna and back there, via Strasbourg, not one man \u2014 German or Italian \u2014 did raise or point his\" finger at me, iu the way they do it now. And why so ? because my deluded Baby tells them to act so ; bids them, as it were. After all, truth must come to the surface, and has come. And now I care little. Ill no more trouble myself with 'exposing' my White Baby before the Hindoos. I'll remain perfectly indifferent. I am a man of noble blood, and frank heart, and can forget and forgive \u2014 and true to the wise preaching of my most beloved mother, I'll invariably return \" good for evil.\" \" Honi soit qui mat y pense \" \u2014 is the motto of Our Old Lady \u2014 aud I should like to march and to shape my future conduct in the lines indicated by those precious words. I am satisfied \u2014 the nation \u2014 I should say the entire nation anglais is getting itself infected with seeds of moral degeneration, a sure precursor of future fall and decline. Read on this subject my letter to you \u2014 directed temporarily to Calcutta to amuse my boys \u2014 my sister's sons there. Now a few humorous hits and then I wind up. Tell Dr. Gerson Da Cunhathat his \" Gambetta of Bombay \" is coming \u2014 coming with actual letters patent from the Czar of Russia"], [143, "127 to be installed as the First Governor-General of India (of all that is Indes Anglaises\u2014 from Rangoon to Quetta) directly the Czar of all the Russias conquers it. Tell him in my name please, and also all our friends at the Ripon Club and the Medical Union, and also to your ever jolly Madame and her sister and mother and brother \u2014 that all the Anglo-Indian Newspapers \u25a0 from the \"Times of India \" to the \" Englishman \" of Calcutta are wrong in believing that the key of India is in Herat ; and that if the Russians were to take Herat, India would be menaced. It was Lord Salisbury I think who said the key of India is neither in Herat nor in the N.-W. Frontier, now being fortified to face the Russian scare \u2014 so passionately paraded by that conceited and cunning., .the \" Duffer-In,\" as his countrymen used to call him, in contradistinction to Lord Ripon \u2014 whom they had nick-named \" Duffer-Out\" :\u2014 \" One \" Duffer Out \" and another \"Duffer-In\" ; but that the key of India was somewhere in London in his own possession in Downing Street (India Office). But even then he was wrong. For my White Baby has found that the key of all India is in the pocket of the \" great Dr. Viccaji \" of Bombay. This wretched man came surreptitiously to Europe, and went to Russia, saw the Czar, who invited him to a Breakfast at his Palace of Peterhof and handed the key of all India, to the Czar of all Russia, and the Czar was so pleased with this his \" Fenian \" like act and for which an Englishman dining vis-d-vis him at the Table d'Hote, 5, Rue de Beaune, Paris, had threatened our great Dr. Viccaji, saying that \" he will have to pay by his neck, when he returns to India,\" that he at once issued, signed and sealed in Dr. Viccaji's pre- sence, Letters Patent conferring the high honour of nominat ing Dr. Viccaji as the First Indian Governor -General of In- dia ! ! ! Tell aR our friends that this news (which I send you in anticipation in advance) is the exact verification of a para, which appeared in my White Baby's Paper called Truth. The Letters Patent are sealed, and cannot be opened, till the Russians come to India, and conquer it ; and as a reward or in"], [144, "128 gratitude for the key of all Indes Anglaises, I have handed them, they will be installing me in the Vice-Regal Palace of Simla, first occupied by our \"Duffer-In\" himself in 1888. It is ihis very man who, I have reasons to believe, is at the bottom of all mischief. Let him be, and he has reaped his reward. It is that my White Baby has, after aU, though too late \u2014 found out that his wily neighbour on the other side of the channel, has tapped at his wrong end and that the consequence of it has been all this ugly blunder. [Here follows a description of the Bal au flambeau of Wednesday, the 5th November, vide pp. 58-59-60]. No. 21. Norddeutscher Lloyd S. S. Sachsen. Sih November 1890. My dear Colonel, \u2014 I must kill my time somehow or other on board a ship, without a good friend or companion to while away my time ; and so I kept myself daily engaged, in penning half amusing, half serious letters to my chums in Bombay, ever since we entered the Suez Canal. My yesterday's letter I thought was going to be the last of its kind from what I call Europe, i.e., westward of Aden, which is the gate of India, and every sea or land to me to the eastward of it is not Europe, but India, or rather the country of the Hindoos. But owing to strong head-winds, and a heavy swell of the sea, we are belated in reaching Aden by some 8 or 10 hours, and as the 'Poste Kaiserliche ' (German Post) has notified that it will be closed at 5 o'clock this evening, I seize this my last opportunity of penning you once more, another letter which will be delivered to you along with my others \u2014 Post Card and letter written this week. To day is the day when I have seriously commenced the study of the great Language of Europe Centrale. Two evenings ago, I happened during my evening promenade to causer with a middle"], [145, "129 aged femme Allemande (Zweite Kajiite, 2nd class passenger) who was sitting under the Bridge. I seized some good chance or other to converse with her. You know what a vhitty-chatty mau I am ; God has granted me a small amount of the \" gift of the gab \" and I must use it to the best of my powers and opportunities. To cut the matter short, I arranged for a lektion (lesson) from her every morning, 9-30 to 10-30 o'clock after breakfast. What a strange coincidence ; my first maitre of the French language was a woman \u2014 nay, a regular budding girl, \u2014 Mademoiselle Gabrielle, of London, when I was reading there (1879) for the College of Surgeons. Oh ! I forget, my first was Madame Blanc, of Rue Richepanse, Paris, in 1875, Decem- ber, or January and February 1876. I did not make much pro- gress with old Madame Blanc, but with my blue-eyed, docile and sweet-tempered Gabrielle, daughter and the only daughter of my housekeeper, Madame Bureau, I had made considerable progress even in London. I now recall to myself how passionately she was fond of me; for she was sleeping close to my own room, and we had one common ante-room, into which our bedroom doors opened. Every morning she would greet me with her lovely smile, directly I would issue out of my room for break- fast. She was \" doing\" my chambre and eveiy morning by 11 o'clock she woidd arrange my room and my books and clothes with a method and detail admirable, and I soon felt this girl had set her heart on me, and she wanted to make me comfortable all the time I stayed in her mother's lodgings. But I was indeed a fool not to profit by her hints and signs.* * * * * It is since then that there was ingrained into me, as it were, a love for the French language, French cuisine, French Theatres, French cocottes, and if you like \"French Society\" too may be added along with these. And I naturally turned to Paris, directly I was referred by the College of Surgeons, for a further study of six months in London Hospitals. This I tell you is the origin or rather the foundation of my going in for the Diplome de Paris. I know not what are your reasons for \u2022J"], [146, "130 taking a liking to a French Diplomc. My ideas were quite different and had I been collared with the Russell Square GabrieUe (whose sight I did not lose even till the middle of 1881,when I revisited Loudon), or any other Parisienne Gabrielle, the Diplome Francais would have been of great use to me, at least, if not in France itself, in some French colony, like Algiers. I am not jealous of you at all. But think, do think twice before you leap in the dark. I know how little I profited by my stay of 18 months in Paris Hospitals, as half my energy was wasted in acquiring and understanding the language there. I know you know French much better than what I knew it in 1880, and that you can now write and compose French weU, and I can hardly still do that, half so well as you do. Never mind for all my misfortunes : be bold and do come up and study in Paris. I'll put you in the way of getting your Thesis up. Select an Indian subject like Dysen tery, or Leprosy, or Elephantiasis, and I am sure your Examin ers \u2014 generally the ayreges will barely be able to show any depth of knowledge of these diseases, so little known and seen iu Europe, and will keep complimenting you, saying \" tree interes sunt; iris bien fait \" and so forth. Don't for any consideration imitate me in getting the Thesis, required from everybody for the Doctorate. Of course I knew it was a regular farce to expect of me to write in French an essay on any subject, when I could hardly pen a letter in that language. Aud I did what the American and other foreigners and even many French students themselves do, Malheurcusement that Thesis has been the cause of so great a mischief, so great a riot, even at this distance of time, that I need not now any more dwell on it. I'll now give a bit of my experience of Europe. I know you preciously treasure up all my letters, and so I would simply say a few words to enfoncer dans votre tete, how to live in Europe, how best to see it, and how to turn its civilisation and its brain to personal profit and advancement. All this means a long lecture \u2014 for which no time. So briefly I may tell you don't"], [147, "131 rush at once to Paris or to London directly you start from Bombay. Great cities like these, even Berlin or St. Petersbourg would puzzle you, or any Indian first setting his foot there, and you will not be able to find your way among a people \u2014 aU uniformly dressed, speaking one language, and whose very in telligence and ways are every minute making impressions on your brain. I would therefore advise you to book only as far as Brindisi, Trieste or Venice or Genoa or Naples. A residence in the smaller cities of Europe, like Naples, Milan and Munchen, Frankfort or Marseilles for about a week will accustom you to European Use and European manners and European food. Then gradually work up your way to Paris, if you mean to study there or to London. If I was in your place, I would go to neither of these cities ; but go straight on to Philadelphia \u2014 University of Pennslyvauia, or to New York, Belle Vue Hospital. America means entire Europe with Chapeau Republicain and nothing more. I was to go there and had actually got a reply from the Pennsylvania University Registrar, as to the terms to be kept, and fees to be paid. But sheer luck or rather the love inspired in me by rny budding blue-eyed Gabrielle drove me to Paris in preference to America, and you know how much my investment of more than 8000 francs for my Paris parchment has repaid me. Thank God I am not \" a hand to mouth living man.\" I follow the Duke of Westminster's adage, \" Limit your wants and you are rich.\" It is he who once said (I remember reading in his speech) \"My richness does not consist in the vast ness of my possessions (for he is the richest nobleman anglais going) but in the fe tone ss of my wants.\" And to me, a garcon yet at this age and would like to remain a garcon for ever, till I die, or until * * * * * * To me, therefore, it matters not if my Paris investment has not repaid me, and has to a very large extent not come up to my expectations. But to you, I am sure, it will be a different thing. Again, I doubt if the wily French dog would now, after his experience of me \u2014 whom he used to caU \" Vous-etes Oriental,\" would show you that degree of souffrance"], [148, "132 and toleration that hu once shewed me. J have carefully studied the beggar's weak traits and I invariably held out a bait to him, that after I go to India, ant-joule des .'/iidiuii/s *.*\u25a0 ill turn up to Paris from India, to study at your Ecole de M.deoine. For these 10 years not one ! and I am sure, he must now bo feeling what a wily Indian I was. In fact he would not take me \u00a3\u25a0 *r an Indian ; but used to say, I am an anglais a \" Mouton Anglais;\" and the Secretary to the Ecole, Monsieur Pinet, would often tell me that for an Indian to be so intelligent and so clever in English, is impossible, at least your pere ou m re must be anglais. With such preconceived notions of mo, it was no wonder that my Thesis was looked upon as directed more by my natural or inherent sympathy with the English (for it was all drawn up from the English Monographs, though written and composed by a Frenchman with my help a little) and meant to be an insult to the Ecole Francais from his neighbour's boutique. On my return I'll give you ftdl verbal directions, as to how to conduct oneself on board a Ship. I know what ugly mistakes I had committed on board the Travancore anithe Ava, in resorting to reprisals, when teased by many a Messrs. Little-Brains. My last voyage as Medical Officer to the Italian boat has dis tinctly shown me how the Captain of a ship is, through the medium of his subordinates \u2014 the officers and stewards, &c. \u2014 in touch with every and each passenger ; as to what he eats, what he drinks, how he passes his time, how he withstands sea-life, what indiscretion he commits, and what his opinions are as to his own ship, \u2014 its speed, cleanliness, service, &c. I know how that conceited was laughed down by the Captain and other members of the ship's equipage ; how his old wife, who used to haw, haw, always on the table, and show off her knowledge of the French language\u2014 which I should think could not go beyond the words \" N'est ce pas,\" for she always used to repeat these words, was marked down as a great blagueuse, when she at one unguar ded moment said (a regular he or gun), that there were Tunnels"], [149, "133 on the Italian Railway between Brindisi and Torino, while there is not one to be found there. All these at once revealed to me the internal economy of the ship, and hence I am always on my guard how I venture to resort to any reprisal, when a lot of my White Baby's agents on board this boat try to shake me. I'll advise you also as to the cheapest means of living in Paris. Tell my Australian Pet that in my letter (which ask him to give you to read) dated yesterday, my description of the Ship Germania Ball was incomplete, as the wretched garcon would, every time I tried to write, come up to spread the table. In fact, in this 2nd Class travelling on board a ship, I am a fish out of water. No proper writing or reacting accommodation ; and a society of rneu and women not up to my standard. However, I am always of an accommodating spirit, with a men diant I pretend to be a mendiant, and would not change my shirt or collar, till they are perfectly soiled and dirtied ; with a polisson I am a little bit of a polisson ; with a child a child, and with a philosopher, a little bit of a man of science. And that is the only way to pull on, with people of all sorts, which one meets with in travelling. I should have liked to add to my description, one or two sentences more, and I am reminded to do so by the presence, at my very table, while I write the letter of the \" Batavian Chimpanzee \" and the Madame \" Blue Cab bage,\" with her whites of eyes when staring at me full in the face enough to frighten any child. In the Ball there was one Mrs. \" Old Shoe. \" She evidently had some difficulty in dancing. Here follows description of Ball quoted at pp. 60. - \" Tons ours la meme chose \" as the French say, and I am really tired of hammering at the same subject, viz. my White Baby. I have now taken my oath, seated on Mother Ocean, to divest myself entirely of my leanings and sympathies with the beggar's vie sociale et politique. I am satisfied he has commit ted this ugly blunder in a fit of delusion, and looking into the whole question with a calm and dispassionate mind, I would no more now notice him.

Again another ball, compared to which the dance of les men diants on the 2nd class deck was a regular tame and poor affair. Your Cyrus was in high hopes of seeing his belle anglaise, in a regular showy turn-out. But I was actually sold ; \u2014 disappointed quite in my expectations. In fact, I felt somewhat low and ashamed to find my jeune et belle Londres Anglaise, cut such a shameful figure as to come to a Fancy Ball without any Fancy Costume. I only saw this mouton"], [151, "135 anglaise after leaving Port Said. She may have been up to then sea-sick, and had to shut up iu her cabin. You know I have often remarked to you, that to my mind there is no more re freshing soup than a beautiful face, or a handsome picture or painting, or some lovely nature's scenery. A beautiful woman excites my thoughts, and always imparts vivacity to my mind. ******* Well, I studied carefully this my jeune Anglaise ; and although she is the only one person on board whose sight recalls to me my London life, I don't think much of her now. I have been attentively watching her eyes and movements. She is evidently toquee, un petit pen original it seems to me ; with thick hands and large fingers, not at aU becoming a delicate lady of high birth. Although she used to grin in my face \u2014 directly she would sight me, very likely taking me for the madcap or the Red Rag of her countrymen in Angleterre, but I hope I was not so lo her though \u2014 I could easily read hatred of me in her eyes. And I would say to myself, my belle anglaise, \" Je n'aime pas manger votre gateau, \" i.e., I would not aUow myself to be ensnared by your charms. *********** Her dancing too was not at all graceful. But I am very thankful te her, my greenhorn of au Anglaise, for giving me two very clever hints to quit the ball at once. I was quietly watching how a paddy-nosed Anglais\u2014 a regular Dr. K \u2014 p type, for either already he must have had a D.

It will amuse you veiy much how I clearly spotted him and a couple of his countrymen, fomenting mischief on the boat against me. * * * * * The beggar's facial physiog nomy I studied carefully yesterday, and I would class him in D.

I twigged the meaning. I am no longer an Italian Baby of my John Bulls of S.S.

I have gained single-handed, a splendid victory against my mighty White Giaut, \u2014 gifted with the brains not of a giant but of a baby, and I must now show myself quite deserving of that victory. The motto of \" Veni, Vidi, Vici\" embroidered on my chapeau by my femme Anglaise, I must prove myself worthy of. And rest assured, Dr. V. will not at all now give a shake to my John Bull in India with another riot, by way of reprisal, for the anti-Viccaji riot he got up against me in Europe. My ways of working will be of quite a different type, and you will find it befitting my noble and high family blood. I'll not disclose to anybody in Bombay my plan of campaign. Even our silly crows I'd no longer trust.

The Calcutta \" despatches \" have lately been recalled and are quoted below. In all, upwards of 20 \" despatches \" and short \" lecture notes \" were penned on board the ship, during the Tourist's voyage homeward, from the day the ship was nearing Port Said (31st Oct.) to the night before the ship anchored at Colombo (Nov. 15). It is amusing to note that up to the time of the Tourist's return to Bombay, many of his friends and acquamtances here could hardly understand the object or guess the meaning and bearings of the long letters, which he kept forwarding two and three at a time, by each mail. They were so full of interesting sketches, criticisms, and caricatures, couched at times with love"], [155, "139 songs, that evidently a few began to suspect that there was something going on wrong with then- Europeanized friend's head, \u2014 until the mystery was cleared to them soon after the Tourist's arrival. Many who had access to these letters, out of curiosity or interest, fancied that the ferment of intellectual activity and intellectual atmosphere of Em-ope, might have perhaps infused too much activity in his mind and consequently feared that it may have been already or is likely soon going to be overstrained. His very intimate friends to whom all these letters were directed, however, did not at all share in this sort of fear or fancy. They relied greatly on certaiu hints caches given by the Tourist, in most of his letters by the sign T/T or TT and which was subsequently changed into the word Tilly\u2014 saying my compliments to \" T T \" or \" T j_ \" or \" Tilly \" and other conventional signs of a like nature, all of which were meant to denote the familar expressions, \" Tricks of trade or ficelles du metier.\" When the entire mystery was laid bare and fully explained on the return of the tourist to Bombay, everybody began to compliment him, for the skill and courage displayed, in playing so adroitly his role of poli-comedie victim to delusion Anglais. It is at their special request that some of these letters are printed now, in the shape of Appendix, as very interesting souvenirs ofthe very amusing \"poli-comedie joue par nos chers voisins \" on the political platform of Europe, and wherein the White Giant fruitlessly tried to kill a Black Bug out of pure delusion.

My Downing Street man will, now that I am out of his sight aud out of his deluded mind, find time to reflect for himself and to draw a moral for his future guidance. The class of people he called to his aid, and I am sure will still be calling to run me down, or as he calls it to mark me or number me and to paint me, is of itself a proof that he has no solid foundation. All the J. B. series I have read, the dozens of Pantomimes I have seen of my White Baby would never have given me such a low idea of him as I have now obtained. Suffice to say I should never have thought of him, so very childish iu all his acts aud so Wanting iu moral souse and ordinary common souse too. Adieu for the present, K. R. V. No- 16. Norddeutscher Lloyd S. S. Sachsen, Monday, 3rd November 1890, 11 o'clock a.m. My dear IIeerjibhoy, \u2014 When I was a passenger by the P. & O. Travancore in November 1875, I remember how my Anglais fellow-passengers were calling me \" Italian Baby ;\" simply because I was then perfectly ignorant of European life and manners. I would sit on the Table d'Hote with my thick warm muffler round my neck, and an Anglais passenger opposite me would remark that \" I am living in Scotland.\" It was in fact a hint to me to take off my muffler, and respect the society, by observing their manners. Strange to say that some 15 years after, that very \" Italian Baby \" has now a chance or the opportunityof retaliation and that too in a very strong way. It is my turn now to name the countrymen ofthe Travancore passengers, my \"White Baby.\" I'll briefly give you my reasons, why I prefer calling our John Bull of Angleterre Baby. Like a child or baby, he has behaved with me. in quite a"], [157, "141 childish way ; and I could not conceive of a more contemptible position for a man of his intelligence and reputation, his com mercial and industrial instincts, his shrewd and cool temper, to act exactly like a child with me, a poor obscure Indian. In all his relations with me, ever since my landing in Europe, he has behaved with the temper of a quarrelsome and crying child, with out much thought and forethought and tact and judgment. Of course in what I here state as my opinion of him, I must conscientiously exclude his countrymen who rule in India. An Anglo-Indian, notwithstanding his hauteur and imperiousness, is after all a man of thought, judgment, and decision. I am sure he would never have behaved with me or with anybody in India or outside India in such a manner, as my \" Greenhorn of a John Bull \" (as an American author writes of him in his work called \"The Two Englishmen, by an American \") has behaved with me. In short it is the greatest possible blunder our John Bull has made. I know he is the greatest Blundering Dog going in Europe, and I would not be afraid to point out to any educated well-bred vigorous -minded Englishman, the many big blunders his nation's representative men have made, ever since the last Crimean war up to this day. A well-bred Englishman is a real gentleman, as he claims to be, and would not at all be over sensitive to criticism from a foreigner,\u2014 provided it is done in good faith and without malice. Unfortunately for me for the twoorthreeweeks I was inLondon,notonc vigorous-minded Eng lishman had the moral courage or good sense to converse with me on the subject of his own blunder. I can only gather his delusive ideas about me, from my talk with Americans and other nations, \u2014 who first began with beating in the bush and at last seemed to declare in a sense like this :\u2014 That I went to Russia to excite the Russians to invade India (pray, don't Wgh !) ; that I went to Germany to gauge the comparative size and strength of the German soldiers, as compared with that of the Tommy Dodd of my John Bull; that I villified and defamed in Paris his rule in India; that I called him d la"], [158, "142 Brahmin, a regular volem des hides; that I am entirely an English hater and a Fenian at heart. Hence it was or I should say it is, that I am a regular \"Red Rag\" to my John Bull. Now I would simply ask, could any grown up man, with his head sound on his shoulders, ever conceive of any such ideas ? and that too to entertain them with regard to a native of India, whose only fault (fault, if you choose to call it) is that he has lived in Paris fur about 18 months, and has picked up sufficient knowledge of men and manners of Europe. I have already told you in my Genoa letter, how I should have behaved or acted had I boon an Anglais, with any Indian suspected of injuring Englishmen's reputation as Rulers of India in Europe. Instead of surrepti tiously following me, wherever I went and satisfying himself with his own eyes and ears, as to whether what he was told hy my Theatrical man (with whom I had a great row in 1881 and which I have already explained aud disclosed to you all) was correct or not, he began to imitate his neighbour the Frog Eater by taking the very steps he took so unsuccessfully iu 1881, and like the frog eater it is no wonder if he should fail. I cannot exactly spot the man, who has been the cause of all this mischief. I suspect he is some man in the India Office, who has been the cause of putting his whole nation in a very awk- ward position on the Continent. But after some conversation, cross -questioning and reading the physiognomy of expression and eyes of a couple of intelligent Englishmen I met in England, my suspicions hit upon Madame Duffy Temple, who now lives in the British Embassy Street in Rome. If this be true, I tell you this person has lost all her chances of occupying the Presi- dential chair in the maison de commerce et Industrie of my friend Anglais. Tant pis. For me, it matters not much. The only thing I have suffered from is some amount of personal inconvenience and some amount of disappointment in my ways and means of enjoying life in my beloved Europe. But if enjoyment and pleasure have been denied to me by my \" White Baby,\" I must thank him for giving me thereby an"], [159, "143 exceptionally good training to my mind. The more he pursued me with his deluded ideas, the more he made me wide-awake, more cautious, more observant and more criticising. All these are precious gifts, which I entirely owe to my \" Time-is money \" man. I know he is honest, and without honesty he could uot hope to prosper commercially. I know he has conscience, as he still sticks to his Bible and to his Sabbath. I know he is thrifty, industrious, peace-loving, and frank. But what I dislike iu him is his want of thought ; he seldom has time to think before he acts ; \u2014 so very absorbed he is in coining money and in hammering out his wares. In his commercial Hue too, he is threatened with a strong competition by the Yankee on the other side of the Atlantic, and by the wily, industrious German on the Continent. Both these nations are running a race with my John Bull's market of the world (London) ; and I doubt if some 30 or 40 years hence, London will be able to stand all the outside competition she has to face. If my John Bull, i.e., his representative public men, who shape a nation's character and prestige was more wide-awake, less confiding on his neighbours, less of a bully and more of brain in all his political and foreign relations, I am sure he would occupy even this day Al position ou the political chessboard of Europe. But men like Grant Duff and Gladstone have pulled him out of the Europeau system, aud confined his talents and his force to Asia, aud I remember well Grant Duff (as Under Secretary) iu reply to an Opposition Speech, des ending his party's action, by asserting that England is an Asiatic power aud has not much to do with the politics of Europe. I can well understand that the person responsible to his nation, for the blunder iu my case, was thoroughly tired of watching me closely in London, after showing me everywhere \u2014 from Aberdeen to Birmingham, he felt I should no longer be allowed to hang about his nation's face aud to stiuk in its nose. So he actually did chase me out of London, sooner than I wanted to do. But hi so doing he does not know what a"], [160, "144 chance he has lost\u2014 the like of which maynot for ever return again of my doing him a bit of service in return for the cool and passive treatment, I had experienced in my journey to Scotland aud Birmingham. \u00ab # # * * \u00bb I am sure ho has still his eyes on me and will keep them until I reach home. I'll be able to gauge that directly I touch the gateway to India \u2014 yiden. Anything lie may say there about me, or do there which is likely to conic to the knowledge of our crows, will and must come to my knowledge in no time. If not while at Aden, some time after I arrive iu Bombay. For I know I am known to many of our crows in Aden. Aden news will soon fly to Bombay. But rest assured, to any man possessing conscience and who is God-fearing, repentance must come and sting his heart, and I should not wonder if my White Baby has now already began to repent. lie has seen his blunder, and I saw that directly I was a week or ten days in Paris. And I kuow what trouble he had to guard me and my purse from those mendiant nations iu Europe. Now what I'll do in India, on my arrival there, will be to guard silence, and will do nothing to betray any malice on my part to our John Bull. Dr. Viccaji haic les .Inglais \u2014 so said Dr. Auger of Paris, when he was introducing me to some Ameri cans in the Hotel of 5, Rue de Bcaunc. And I don't wish that on my conduct and action similar epithets or iuterpretation be put on by the Hindoos especially. I'll describe in my own way my European tour, \u2014 so full of episodes to me, and which (when I review it iu my mind, as I often do, while promenad ing on the Deck of this large and musical boat) seems to sur pass even some of the stories I have read in Truth, \u2014 the society paper of London. My life is and has ever since my youth been full of episodes. My love-episodes arc nothing ; my quarrels with the Brahmins of Belgaum and the Chief of Jam khandee, are nothing ; my opposition to my College Professors"], [161, "145 and the paper war I carried on with them iu Bombay \u2014 all these look quite small before this my European tour, during which I have kept (mind not of my own choice and doing, but quite unconsciously and unwillingly) the whole London [from Charing Cross to the Bank] and whole Paris (from the Opera to the Ecole de Medecine) ringing in the ears of everybody. Thank God, I have come out successfully from all this delu sive crushing and kicking by my John Bull. He has now to eat the humble pie and to reflect over the whole affair, the mischief he himself sowed and watered on the European soil. I have proved true to my ancestors' blood ; and notwithstanding all stupid efforts to mark me down as a lunatic and a madcap or a drole, half mad and a sou or fosse or folle, I now return to India with an exulting heart ; with my mind again galvanised with the civilization and contact of Europe and my chapeau crowned with C\u00e6sar's motto : \u2014 \" Veni, Vidi, Vici.\" Kindly read this amusing letter to your P;i and to many of your intimate friends Anglais. If I come to Calcutta this Christmas, I'll revisit your Lodge, aud revive my acquaintance with some of its members, and this time I am sure many of them will be somewhat curious to see the man who has been all these three months the common table-talk of European capitals from Russia to London. My best compliments to your old Pa and Ma and to my beloved cousins Khusro and Rustum. To Jamsoo Shet I have had no time to write \u2014 but the things I carry with me for him will compensate him amply. Adieu, my dear Heerjibhoy, Your affectionate brother, KAIKHUSRO. No. 17. Norddeutscher Lloyd 8. S. Sachsen. Suez, 4th November. 1890. Tuesday. My dear Pesikaka, \u2014 I have posted to you a very letter from Port Said, and to-day write L.g***-_n another equally 10"], [162, "146 amusing. I am sure all my letters must have been a great source of fun and mirth to all of yon in Bombay \u2014 especially to your Madame and your belle seeur, also ko Hi Reindeer, who looks upon John Bull and his wife, as the model of all that is well-bred and gentlemanly. We have been all long mark ing how often my Anglais wants brain : aud in this my third tour in Europe, I have verified to its veiy depth our opinion of him. I think there is no greater blundering clog going in the whole of Europe. I mean the north side of Europe. For Europe Southerns from Constantinople to Lisbon meaus a set, of people much inferior to we Parsees, \u2014 \" the Anglo-Saxons of the East,\" as our John Bull of India, so very often flatteringly calls us in his jouinaur anglais. The Turk richly deserves to be chased out of Christian Europe. The Greeks are a regular degenerate race. 1 saw lots cf them strolling Idee idlers, with an idiotic stare, in the Boulevards of Paris. The Italian i* what the French call the \" chien ingrat.\" It was France only which relieved him from the bondage of Austria and the Pope,. and as the price of its \" Magenta \" and \" Solferino \" took Nice and Savoy (Alpine Italy to the N. W. and (lose to the French frontier) from him. It is to get these back, that this ungrate- ful dog now licks Bismark's soles. But the wily German will only hold this bait to the dog to serve his own purpose. I have twice been in Germany. This time from Frankfort to Konigsberg, and last time from Miinchen to Metz and Stras bourg , and I believe the German to be the last man to let an inch of French soil escape out of his hands. The Schleswig- Holstein campaign has given him a seaboard on the north of Europe. The Alsace and Lorraine provinces have thrown the French further back, from the Rhine to the Vosges ; and he has now only to prolong his boundary from these provinces to the Mediterranean sea-board, to have another maritime arsenal facing Toulon and a seaport for his daily expanding commerce. And I am sure the wily and wide-awake Prussian \u2014 the nervous type of the German race and in whom, I believe, the Brain of"], [163, "147 Germany is represented\u2014 -will when the proper time comes, soon appropriate Nice and Savoy to himself, and leave the Italian dog barking and bawling. The Portuguese and the Espagnols are a regular degenerate race, not worth noticing. The brain and muscle, the Arts and Industries\u2014 sword and love of all Europe is centred now in its northern races. I regret for my poor \"Greenhorn of a John Bull\" (as designated by an American in his Book called \" the Two Englishmen\") that he cannot keep pace with the nations\u2014 the leading nations of Europe \u2014 the Russians, Germans and the French, in what is called Europe Political and Military. This is simply owing to his excessively developed commercial instinct. He look- to gold and silver, as the great agents to keep him floating. The prestige his forefathers had acquired, after fighting successfully at Waterloo and Trafalgar, is now gone, aud with it, I am afraid his pride as the leading great power of Europe. It is no wonder then, that he should look to the countiy of the Hindoos (India) as the proper sphere of his activity and energy. And it is in India and the Colonies Anglais (Australia and Canada) that we find our John Bull of the proper type and standard. But the John Bull shut up in his isle is on a regular high road to mental and moral de- generacy. And I am really stupefied to find him lower him- self in my estimation to a level, not far off from contemptible. I say my White Baby wants brain, and like an unthinking Baby \u2014 who cannot think or reason or judge and foresee and act for himself \u2014 just look what he has been doing with me He has been behaving with me like a child, imitating the French, and thought thereby he could successfully chase me out of Europe. When he was infected by the French (i.e., mj- Ecole de Medecine men, on account of the severe irritation my or rather his own countryman's These de Doctorat had caused them) in 1881, he believed like a child, what he was told. All these 10 years, he kept his eye on me, it seems, without saying a word to me. In fact, he had not the moral courage to do it."], [164, "148 And when I again turn up in Europe, he works up his ,,,-er sensitiveness tu criticism in matters Indian to a pitch almost \u00bbn a level with '\u2022 Delusion.\" Impelled by this delusion, he bus not only set up his own entire nation againsl me, to crush me, a regular Bug for him, but has been fruitlessly trying to infi el the other continental nations \u2014 I mean the Germans and the Russians, and to influence them to aid him or help him in his childish attempts to chase me out of Europe, as a very un pleasant Indian and a b,'te ! Did he succeed '. No ! and the reason is now self-evident. You will be surprised to learn that his delusion still haunts me, and now I will give you a very humorous sketch of the deluded acts of my White Baby, whom / cannot help but pity. For no crow loved him so much from my infancy, as your honest, frank \" wine and women\" friend, the true blue-blooded Cyrus of Bombay. I recollect well how I had once arranged to run up to London in 1866, as a Surgeon to the Black Ball line iron ship \" Alumbaugh.\" Captain Buhner, its Com mander, liked me so much and took such a fancy to me \u2014 I lielieve from my gift of the gab and general knowledge of tous les choses Anglais which then passed \u2014 that he at once offered me \u00a38 for a trip to Algoa Bay in charge of coolies and thence a passage by the Cape Route to London and back to India in his Company's ship. But I had then to yield to my dear mother's entreaties, who knew well my love of European or rather properly speakiny English life and manners, and feared I should be marry ing some penniless English lass, and not care at all to return to her any more. Even now. although the beggar foolishly accuses me of hating his nation and his institutions and his cities, simply because the cunning French have told him, \"il haie let Anglais.' et il va tuer les Anglais,\" if there is any living crow in London, who appreciates his life social and life political, and admires his industrial and commercial resources, it is your jolly aud energetic- and active-minded and ever-thinking and ever-ob serving Dr. Viccaji. \u2014 * ******* -But my deluded"], [165, "149 White Baby cannot aud will not understand me. His hatred of me is too much ingrained in his heart, ever since 1881 (my Paris year) and I don't think he will get rid of it for some time yet. For my part / have given him up completely as a contemptible child, not worth noticing at all. Directly I arrive in Bombay which is my Sans Souci Castle, I'll no more show interest in his papers, like the Pall Mall Budget and the Nineteenth Century, and Truth and other such publications, the perusal of which kept alive my interest in his public life, and in his social life somewhat.

I have this the third time seen London, more critically than before, and would have seen it still more had I but the chance of prolonging my stay there till Xmas (as I wanted to do). For much remains yet to see and to search in that great mart of the world, of which our Johu Bull is justly proud. But w-hatever little I have seen of that city is sufficient for my purpose, to dissect it anatomically and to lay it threadbare, as it were, before our people in Bombay. Were I to do that, I am sure I'll be set down as acting with malice and in bad faith. I must leave a description of London, Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Brighton, Northampton, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, and the Balmoral range of Hills, \u2014 either to some more intelligent or more stupid crow thau myself ; or at some future time, take it up myself, should God grant me another chance of revisiting Europe on my way to America, before my eyes get dim, and my teeth are knocked out of my jaws.

The poor fellow is still very unfortunate. He was tried by a Court Martial, held iu Paris (10 years ago) by the order of H. R. H. the Duke of Delhi, and sentenced exparte to be cashiered. On appeal, the"], [167, "151 Commander-in-Chief reversed the Court's finding and restored- Captain Cyrus to his regiment in Bombay.

The summons of arrest was served on him at Wiesbaden. His wife is one of the daughters of the tres riche Rothschild of Downing Street, London. She wants to separate from him, alleging that our friend Captain Cyrus is crazy, drole, mad-cap, half mud and more a sou. a fiolle and a fosse]]} All these are terms indicative of insanity. A regular Lunacy Commission was issued by the High Court of London and poor Captain Cyrus is to be judged by the \"Lunacy Commission.\" as to whether he is actually mad and not worthy to enjoy the matrimonial life and bliss with his femme Anglaise. The Commission is holding its sitting in Villa Germania, and its large Dancing Hall is placed at the disposal of the Judges and Q.

Who are these witnesses ? He says they are the Barmaids of the City, Straud and Euston Road Restaurants ; Gold Diggers and Coal Miners going to Australia ; Cement Workers going to Suez, and German Mechanics and Engine Drivers goingto China.

Our Captain Cyrus has written me a long letter, which I prefer briugiug to you personally and reading and explaining it to you. He accuses his turn wife Anglaise of labouring under delusion, instilled into her by her neighbour, Madame Sarah Bernhardt \u2014 the Professional actress of Paris and a great favourite the Parisians say of the Prince des Galles, and hence her popularity in Angleterre, but not in France. Her delusion is due to many causes and circumstances, says he, in his very long long letter to me. In her delusive fits, she has indented upon every nationality of Europe, to kick and to crush Captain Cyrus. Even at Queenstown, whence he sailed by the White Star liue to New York, his femme Anglaise had to bribe a couple of Brazilian girls seated opposite to Captain Cyrus in the Hotel d'ltalia, to run him down as a mad -cap. But our bold and energetic and wide-awake Captain Cyrus, soon smelt the rat and shut the steam up of these two Brazilian girls by calling them \" Negrelles,\" Ssc, Sf., \u00a7-c.

If not, vid Madras by the long and tedious Railway Route. I believe I am justified in my choice of selectiug the German Boat on my return voyage. A German passenger in the Italian Boat, who sent me to Berlin, had praised these boats much and we had even sighted one of these Lloyd boats in the Aden harbour on my way to Europe. My principal object was to lay the foundation, as it were, of learning the German language. This, thank God, I have carried out, though some what late ; and in some six months' time, if you come to"], [170, "154 Bomba\\. you will find me talking (even in broken, ungram maticaJ German with any ofthe Germans in Bombay. The boat is quite up to my expectation, minus the military craze, so critically noted by Mr. Child in his Coup d'\u0153il of Berlin, in Harper's Magazine for August. 1 have personally observed how the poor Alsaciens are bulbed by this what my housekeeper, Madame Blanc, used to call \" the Butcher of the Rhine\" \u2014 by his military show, in Metz and Strasbourg. I could have revisited these very cities once more to judge for myself, if any reconciliation of feeling between the rulers and the ruled has at all (after some 10 years since my last visit to Strasbourg] come on. In this ship no military show : not even the Fire Brigade Parade I used to see on the Messageries. It is very musical, we have had four Balls; only two of which were ac* * 3sible to the 2nd class. The Fancy Ballw&s a sight in itself. A couple of German ladies had dressed <i la Turque ; one of them \u2014 nervous typed tall lady \u2014 excellent dancer, and possessing a wonderful amount of nervous energy, enough to tire out any dancing master. Another Allemande, though more pretty and young, but weak and innocent as a dove, danced with a pose quite her own. A London type Anglaise is also among the i isseugers of the 1st class. Her commercial instinct counselled her not to respect the Captain' s invitation by putting on a Fancy Dress, which I expected her to do, and that in a manner so grand as to cut out even the German ladies. But no ; my commercial and thrifty Anglaise looked at the thing iu her national \" excentrique \" (as the French call les Anglais mood and came to dance with an ordinary red silk gown. She is the ordy creature who recalls to me my London Life, i.e. its hotels, its theatres, and its beauties \u2014 I wish she was not here\u2014 or if here, had laid up sea-sick iu her cabin, just as she was up to Port \u2022said. For, I am determined and will now henceforth divest myself completely of my sympathies for my John Bull et safille. I never for a moment could have conceived this our Anglais so far degenerate. The very fact of his imitating the"], [171, "155 French in his endeavours to chase me out of Europe \u2014 shows that like the French, he is on a high road to decline and fall. I'll write out a clear and concise personal history of my tour in Europe, aud I'll depict therein the various phase's of what I call Delusion Anglais. The beggar has never told me what his grievances against me are ; in what way have I touched his sensitive points in Europe in 1881 ; and why have I become a ' Red Rag ' to him. I only succeeded in gleaning some of his delusion from American ladies and American Doctors, with whom I had often a chance of conversing with in Paris. I am so far glad that my John Bull has after all seen how he was sold by the wily French Ecole de Ivleclecine man, with whom I had a big row in 1881. But that was a personal matter between me and my Ecole. And I am sure, after some 10 years, the Frangais would have welcomed me once more in his theatrical city, with a sweeter tongue and with his usual politeness, though with one of his eyes on my purse \u2014 \u25a0butf for this my White Baby. I know how, after his eyes were opened, he had to take good care that I am safely landed in Bombay once more. For had I even met with a natural death, from say Galloping Consumption into which I once feared my cough in Paris would run, I am sure all our crows and Hindoos would have for- SDoth pronouuced this my Greenhorn of a John Bull guiltg of manslaughter, if not actual murder. This itself would have been a sufficient brand on his forehead, and that too from a people who know him only from his \"governing \" side. This would have been the proper time for me to have reviewed my entire tour in Europe. But in a ship full of passengers, with scarcely any quiet writing table to sit and write at for the 2nd class passengers, it is not possible, and I prefer doing all that in Bombay. I was to write this afternoon a slashing letter to Fitzgerald, the Political A. D. C. to the Indian Secre tary of State. But this too I have given up and will write from Bombay, with more thought and less of feeling. I have handed him a copy of my Paris Thesis \u2014 the ultimate cause of the"], [172, "156 delusion Anglais, and alsocopies of all my letters I posted to you already from Paris. All my important letters I have sent registered. I had also sent to my lite now a M. P. aud knighted for Egj ptian service, some of my letters ; and when I saw him in London, just look how my Greenhorn Anglais wanted to sell me. He said he received no letters from me. Now either the French Post Office is a voleur (which I can never believe, \u2014 for the London Times aud the Bombay men have received copies of tie- same letters sent to him) or my Greenhorn Anglais is a liig 1 . a I'll give you a funny instance of the, way in which these people judge me. One Mrs. M -a passenger from Bombay, asked mn if I have a family and so forth. I did not like to tell her all the secrets of my matrimonial life, and I put off her inquisitive and impertinent queries by telling her that my wife died while under accouchement. ' Aud the very next .morning I have heard her telling another passenger in my face \" take my word that man has murdered his w'de ; he has poisoned her. \" While she keeps speaking this stuff, she stares hard at my face and I. like a wily Francais, work up my facial muscles of ex- pression, so as to seem really guilty of having poisoned ( '! J nn/ Parseemwife (whom I should have liked to show to Mrs. M iu Bombay, should she turn up there). I have lived sufficiently long in Paris aud studied its theatrical expressions of face, so attentively, that with my scientific knowledge of the physiog- nomy of expression, derived chiefly from Dr. Duchenne de Bou logne's original monograph essay \u2014 I can easily work up my facial angles to any sentiment I want. Iu my 2nd class dining saloon, usually messages are sent by about half a dozen foolish Anglais of the 1st class to tap me at what they fancy my wrong end; and a number of British working class men and women\u2014 some regular \" Roughs \" and I suspect oue or two are regular jail-birds, send forth directly a lot of steam in the usual Parisian and Grand Hotel London style, and to draw"], [173, "157 them out as much as possible. I work up my face to a pitch of actual mental torture aud pain, just as I used to do in Paris to draw out the impulsive Francais iu the Bouillon Duval and Quartier Latin. Again when my turn came at times I used to indulge in such a severe silent kick or an open reprisal, that the beggar would lose his head and begin to curse me ; thus, \u2014 \" 11 y a des sous, mais j'ai jamais iu un sou comme ca; e'est merveilleux,\" &c.. &c. To do the same with my John Bull's chiffoniers, my conscience would not permit. I know these poor ilhterate brutes are really innocent ; I let them indulge iu smoking their pipe. Tant mieux pour moi; the more easily and quickly I shall be divesting myself of all my ingrained love and sympathies for him and for his filles. She possesses both head and heart than this my Tirne-is-money man. My cabin is too hot now and I must finish this letter. Will telegraph from Colombo, arrival and departure for Bombay.

LONDON, Allow me, Sir, to present you this Looking-Glass, and through you to all your White Babies, friends and aides \u2014 my Poli-comedie Actors in Europe. In the words of Victor Hugo, I would say \" Ce livre est plus qu'actuel; il est urgent. Je le publie.\" The writer of these precious words, was only able to publish his Histoire d'un Crime, some 26 years after it was written, when in exile in Belgium. If I have been able to publish and to put on the record of time, a faithful and accurate history of my sufferings and persecution in Europe, so veiy quickly as some 26 days after my \"exil\" as it were in the Asiatic shop of my Whit- Giant, it is due to circumstances which are self -apparent to any thinking and practical man. Like that great work this little brochure too, is a record or a recital of a crime committed by my Poli-Comedie Actors in Europe. The crime shown in this Looking-Glass is though of a different kind and nature and quite a trivial one before the great crime of the man. who assassinated his patrie to pose himself in history, ever since 1851, as L'Empereur des Francais (Emperor of the 11"], [178, "160 French) until he had to give himself up in INT\", as the prisoner of Sedan \u2014 it is still after all but a crime. A crime conceived to kill \"A little game not worth killing, \" to drown and to paint or mark an Indian subject of the Wliite Giant, simply because he \"dislikes the English\" and is 'wrong footed.' With my feeble pen and my Parsee English \u2014 for I am not an Englishman and would on no account like to bo taken as such \u2014 I have tried to sketch and to describe certain tangible facts, which havo passed before me in my European tour, hoping thereby to communicate to my reader my own impressions, so very difficult for me to reproduce in words. All my narrative is more than a \" Deposition d'un tem >i-i ;\" and tis such I would simply press it to the attentive perusal of my White Giant and his responsible Baby officers. Should my White Giant now, after reading this the entire personal history of my torn- in Europe, be morally satisfied, as to the nature of the crime, the dwellers of his Whitehall have committed in his name and with his sanction ; how a poor innocent Indian Tourist was mercilessly and vindictively persecuted and chased by all his White Babies ; how the nation over which he rules was driven into an awkward position before its neighbours and rivals on the continent ; and how he became the laughing stock of the very men who originally started the mischief 10 years ago, when this time in September 1890 on their Boulevards, his own White Babies began to make a contemptible exhibition of themselves in running down a solitary traveller \u2014 un Indien \" qui a fait rien, seulcment il a fait le journaliste'', and how this sort of wild chase of a poor Asiatic savoured more of actual moral cowardice, as remarked by many thinking and sensible men, \u2014 I say if you, my White Giant, are morally satisfied in your conscience with the truth of this narrative, you, Sir, ought now to move your nation's l-fpiesentatives to find out tho man or men, who in sheer"], [179, "161 delusion have worked up all this mischief, and to ask them to hang him and to punish all his abettors on your Whitehall List.

Here in this the 2nd Fascicule of my Looking-Glass for my Poli-comedie Actors in Europe, I finish the narrative of my personal history of tour. Still there remains a lot more to say. I have missed therein a great many episodes, a great many kicks on tho part of our White Babies and a great many scratches on my part in return given to them. However, I trust I have so far succeeded in narrating facts and in giving them a tangible shape, and I must now leave it to my readers to draw from them their own impressions aud to try to get themselves as strongly impressed as I was, all the time I had to fulfil my role of victim to Poli-comedie Anglais. The Poli comedie of boycotting an unpleasant Indian (who had during his former residence in one of the capitals of Europe, for nearly 2 years, rendered himself very unpleasant to my White Giant) out of Europe, was conceived, planned and worked by certain responsible officers of my White Giant residing in his White hall Castle, Westminster. And if they have failed in their performance, and what was going to be merely a short holiday trip of barely 4 or 6 weeks, was prolonged into an extensive tour or \" travelling over all Europe \" \u2014 it was because the Poli-comedie Directors were not up to their work \u2014 aud had not sufficiently mastered the secrets of the theatrical art of playing a poli-comedie on the platform of Europe before a political audience. Or it was because the Indian Tourist was coo much of a scamp, too knowing and far too shrewd not to _e below the surface. Hence it was that all our White \u2022 xiant's attempts to kill or to paint and to mark me all the time wiat I was on my tour in Europe did fail. Fail they must, the entire fabriqu. of boycotting the Tourist rested ou a"], [181, "163 fictitious idea\u2014 a delusion that he was a dangerous man, une personne meprisable ou simplement un drole, and that therefore on no account he should be allowed to enter the Giant's political playground in Europe. It was feared his presence would injure the reputation for sagacity, honesty, and disinterested ness of the White Babies, whom the Giant sends to rule his distant possessions across the seas. It was feared that if the hinges of prestige and brag, upon which rests the huge machi nery raised by my White Giant in uncivilized vegetarian Asia were disclosed to his other rivals in Europe ; if the mines of \"hoarded wealth\" about which some of his Babies still desire to seek information (Vide Poli-comedie Song No. 7, p. 13) were disclosed to his mendiant neighbours on the Continent, there will be no more of grist brought to his mill, and that his poor \"White Babies will starve and die of starvation and want. Such fears are, of course, childish ; child-like, because a child and a child only can conceive them. If a grown-up man or what is more the Giant of a man \u2014 as I prefer calling the man, familiarly known to the nations of Europe under the sobriquet of John Bull or Jean de Taureau \u2014 were to entertain such childish ideas, any one would naturally think that that man is suffering from delusion or a false belief, a misleading of the mind. I have tried in some of my letters from Paris, written with the special object of clearing the delusion Anglais to trace the mischief to its true source, and have essayed to connect this Poli-comedie of boycotting me out of the cities of Europe with my White Baby's over -sensitiveness to criticism, in matters which concern his methods and modes of governing India, the country of the Hindoos. This, his over-sensitiveness was gradually worked up into hatred or dislike of me and which in turn grew up into delusion. A mind misled with a false belief that the Indian Tourist is a Fenian at heart and an enemy of my White Giant's maison, would, to sustain its ficti tious idea and to justify all subsequent action based upon it,"], [182, "164 invariably try and interpret every appearance to suit its own idea and assimilate every incident to its own pre-conceived views. Thus if the Tourist went to Russia, it was to act and to show himself there ci la Dhuleep Singh ; if a Russian casquette is put on, it is to cut the English ; if the Tourist went to Ger many it is to see and to judge with his own eyes, which nation's soldier looks better, more formidable and more strong than my John Bull's soldier ; if a French shirt, necktie, and habit de soir are donned, it is because the \"shoe\" is \"wrong-footed\"; if London is not visited again, during this my 3rd tour in Europe, it is because \" Docteur Viccaji hates the English\", he is Anti- Anglais ; if he prefers buying cheap on the Continent, instead of making his purchases from my White Baby's own expensive \"maison commerciale et industrielle, \" it is because he hates everything English \u2014 from English Beef and English Plum pudding down to English Books, English Ladies, and English Music; if some half-a-dozen copies of Mr. Dadabhoy Naoroji's Essay on the Poverty of India are distributed to the Tourist's inquiring friends and others in Paris, it is to encourage his thea trical neighbour in his assertion that \" the English enrich themselves at the expense of India \" ; if the Tourist could not make his choice, as often as he did in Paris, it was because he has only come half-round and that it will take him some time to come round (Vide Poli-comedie Song, No. 40, p. 19). Such are some of the droll ways and methods of reasoning adopted hy my White Giant and his responsible Baby officers. And whenever there is a false perception of objects and impressions in a man, he is said to be deluded or labouring under a delusion. I have endeavoured to show to our White Giant in this Look ing-Glass, how and when he came to be deluded. I have appropriately called this publication a Looking-Glass for my Poli-Comedie Actors. For, each phase of the entire comedie discloses certain traits in the character and disposition of our White Giant. I have already promised in my letter to Mr. Fischer of Russia (published in the 1st Fascicule,"], [183, "165 p. 3-5), to sketch some of the traits, and I must now try to make the Looking-Glass effective, so that it may reflect faithfully to my White Giant, the image of all the White Babies of which his skeleton is made. Their size, intelli gence, their mental and moral stamina; their incapacity for dancing Poli-comedie Polkas and Hungarian Waltzes ; their too apparent sensitive points or wrong ends ; their childish dis position and temerity, and how like little crying angry children I had often to lull and to pacify them ; \u2014 all these I have tried to show in my own way in this my narrative of facts. But owing to the haste and hurry with which this Looking-Glass is got up, I have been prevented from portraying all the requisite lights and shades so necessary to make the tableau effective. I promise to paint my tableau more efficiently and more vividly in what will form the 3rd Fascicule to this Looking- Glass; but which publication I prefer styling \"John Bull chez lui from an Indian's point of view.\" I like to do that sort of work hereafter (perhaps seated in his own Giant London) faithfully, without malice or vindictiveness, no more mes coups de dents, and with more of thought and less of feeling. It requires some study yet on my part to collate the facts observed and to deduce from them my conclusions ; in short, to ex . pose to my White Giant his weak points, all his traits, good and bad, which have of themselves been disclosed to me. To some of these I was guided by my previous reading and know ledo-e of his vie sociale et politique ; many of his traits, caracteres de la race, I have been able to glean from my closer inspection of our John Bull, ever since my first tour in Europe in 1875- 70. But at no time did he ever disclose to me all his weak traits of character and disposition as he has done now. Thanks to his theatrical neighbour, my Ecole de Medecine man, \u2014 I have had an exceptional and a very rare chance of looking at our John Bull in his own isle, from quite close and whence he was sufficiently transparent to enable me to see and to judge him. I know now what opinion I have formed of the man."], [184, "166 If now while transferring my experience and knowledge of Europe and its people to my countrymen, especially the Indian Parsees, whom he invariably styles in his clubs and society rooms as his \" Indian children,\" were I to put on record my im pression of our John Bull as I found him in his own sea-girt isle, I am sure he will be the first to welcome my self-imposed task. I am sure he will at least have the good sense or prudence to face the exposure with a calm, collected and sober mind which I am told he is reputed for. Many an educated Indian and one who has travelled in the country with eyes and ears open, knows too well, what John Bull is as the Emperor of the Hindoos and what his Empire of India means. He does not require to be told by me anything new. He, I mean the Brah min of Bombay or the Babu of Calcutta, knows more than what I can tell him on that point. But in a publication I intend to bring out (I hope before the year is out) under the title of \" John Bull and his Isle from an Indian's point of view,'' I promise to disclose to him traits in his character and dis position which even Max O'Rell, his own dear neighbour, has failed to observe and to record. This Poli-comedie was to my mind a regular crime, crime committed by my White Giant to kill a Black Bug, his own subject \u2014 because he \" dislikes the English \" and is \" wrong footed.\" As it is a crime committed under a misconception, under actual delusion, one cannot but forget and forgive it. It has, however, left in its wake a most memorable stamp on the nation, I mean the Poli-comedie Actors and actual perpetrators of the crime, and as well as on the nation's subject \u2014 the victim of its delusion. Good followeth evil. And in the long run, I am sure this Poli-comedie will do good to all its performers \u2014 our White Giant and his Babies as well as myself, his \" old shoe \" and \" our menial, our servant out of pocket living on drippings from India\" (vide Pol. -com. Song No. 32, p. 18). To the former it has provided an admirable Looking-Glass, which is worth being guarded"], [185, "167 for ever in the boudoir of his Whitehall. To the latter, it has taught a lesson and a severe lesson it was, no more to scratch again the Giant's face, which is not in the country of the Hindoos, of which he is the Emperor, but in the capital cities of his neighbours on the continent of Europe. That is the only way whereby I can leave my White Giant to a full and unsullied enjoyment of his Indian palace. In re turn for this service, I trust he will have the good sense and prudence, if not conscience, no more to persecute and annoy me, but to leave me alone to my own means and resources for existence in a new atmosphere and under new influences."], [186, "LOOKING-GLASS EOS MY POLI-COMEDIE ACTORS IN EUROPE, BEING Personal History of an Indian's Tour from Moscow to Birmingham.

He asked me, if I would like to take a run to Italy and back as Surgeon to one of his Company's Steamers, and explained to me the circumstances under which its own Italian Surgeon was disabled from re turning by that boat. I promised to give him my final reply by 9 o'clock next morning. After some difficulty and persua sim I su?C3cded in overcoming the objections of my old Ma, and. went to the Rubattino Co.'s office to say my Oui to the t'3rm? off ire 1, viz. a free fir it class passage to Ganoa and back and an en^agem*mt to lend my professional services as Sur geon and Medical Officer, only during the outward voyage, and that my return to be at my option after one, two or three months, on any date and by any boat I choose to six. I was told to call again at about 1 o'clock, by which time the local agency expected a reply to the telegram they had forwarded to Genoa. I called there at the appointed hour and an engage ment was closed with me. I was told to make all haste and go on board the boat then lying in the Prince's Dock, which she"], [187, "169 was expected to leave by 3| o'clock r. M. On my way to the Dock, I was told to look in the office again to sign the follow ing letter of engagement, and of which I was handed a press Copy. The Acting Agent, Florio Rubattino Co., Bombay. Sir,\u2014 I hereby accept the Office of Doctor on board your Steamer \" Singapore\" sailing to-day for Genoa under the fol lowing conditions : \u2014 . That my remuneration shall be Rs. 150, one hundred and fifty only, for the voyage to Genoa and back, with First Class accommodation both ways. That I shall not be working as a Doctor on my return voyage and the passage to and fro will be gratis. If I elected to wait on the continent for a month or so, my return passage will stand good for any steamer which may be returning to Bombay. The remuneration above said to be paid to me on my arrival here. \u2014 Yours, &c. While signing this letter the Acting Agent came to the table of the head Assistant, Mr. Darasha, by whom I was introduced to him. He recommended me to put on European costume and said I would be better respected by passengers and the equipage, in my costume Europeen than in my own native or Indian \u00bb'. e. Parsee costume. I assured him that I always preferred the European costume in travelling, especially in Europe. At the time my services were engaged, there was another competitor, one Dr. Norris for the post advertisedj that morning in the local English papers, for a Surgeon to the S. S. \" Singa pore \" to sail at 4 o'clock p. m. As I had applied for the vacancy some couple of hours before him, preference was given to me and the Head Assistant assured me that they would naturally give me a preference, on account of my knowledge of the French language and the Paris diplome, and also because I was so well known to him and to many in Bombay, and not to the other competitor, who could not produce his Diplome"], [188, "170 which was said by its holder to be on its way to India from England. Overtures were made to me through the agency of a countryman of mine (employed in Sauquet and Co.'s office) to give up my engagement with the Italian Co.'s Agent, and I was offered in lieu thereof Rs. 150 at first, which sum Was raised to Rs. 175 and finally to Rs. 200. Even this sum was brought to my house and handed to me at about 2. o'clock. And on my way back from home to the Rubattino office, when I showed this amount tendered by the English Doctor, as a con sideration to induce me to cancel my engagement with the Com pany (which was only verbal up to this hour and had to be ratified by actual signature on the letter of agreement) the Head Assistant, Mr. Darasha told me, he would have to look very small before his superior, if I were to retire at that late hour- I am sure he was not aware at the time when he said so, first, of my honest nature ; for once a parole d'honneur is given, I would be the last person to retrace my steps on any considera tion whatever. Secondly, he was not aware how quickly and powerfully I was galvanised at the prospect of revisiting Europe and tasting once more after some 10 years the charm of enjoying life there. My ardent love for Europe and its people has been cultivated almost from my infancy, and which will at once appear to any casual peruser of some of my letters from Europe, published1 as an appendix to the 1st Fascicule. This is not only the case with me but with most of my countrymen, i. e., the Parsees. The same ideas are expressed in my letter to the Editor of the Times, London, dated Paris, 13th September 1890, headed ' Boycotting of a native of India' in Europe, which the Editor had returned to me there with his compliments. I had in my concluding para, of that letter said \" To us, Parsees of India, the powerful force of the ferment of contact with English life and manners in Bombay is so very great, that you, Mr. Editor, need not be surprised, when I assure you, that no Parsee gentle men of education and means in India, ever thinks his education"], [189, "171 to be complete until he visits Europe and faces its civilization. He then alone can realize the industrial and economic attain ments of civilized life, the high scientific attainments of the people here, and their constant or restless intellectual activity, their ways and means of enjoying life, and a host of other things too numerous and quite out of place to mention here.\" I eagerly seized this opportunity of renewing my connaissance after some 10 years with the cities of Europe, I mean especially London and Paris, where I had enjoyed some of the best days of my life. To recall every now and then all the past recollections of the many happy days I had spent in Paris, during my student days there, was enough to keep alive in me my ardent love for Europe and its people. It was the monsoon month (July) and a heavy swell would have rendered irksome my reaching the steamer by a jolly boat, once it was out of the Dock Gates. So I made all haste, and packing a few clothes &c, I left for the Rubattino Office, to sign the letter of engagement and immediately thereafter drove to\u00b0the Dock. Before bidding good-bye to the Head Assistant, Rubattino Office, I had paid him Rs. 400 to buy a draft for me on London and post it to my address, care of the head office, Genoa, where I had also left instructions to. direct all my home letters. At \\ past 3 o'clock the steamer was taken charo-e of by the Pilot and the Dock Gate was cleared by 4| o'clock and the outer Light Ship by 5^ o'clock. I was intro duced by the Agent of the Company to the Commandante, Mons. G. Parodi, who wanted to see my diplome. This I immediately handed to him, and on his expressing his desire to guard it with him in his possessions, I let it remain with him. It was returned to me on the day I furnished to the Captain, a report for entry in his log-book of my charge of the ship as its Surgeon and Medical Officer. Including myself there were m all nine first class passengers. One of these was a German, one a Portuguese, one Swiss (both of these represented the Consulate of a minor European State, the forma- iu Bombay and the"], [190, "172 latter in Calcutta); all the rest were from Upper India. Among them was a nervous and a meditative type of English man, a high official from N. W. Provinces, who as becom ing his high position, was a perfect gentleman and un homme sirieux. I mention his presence here particularly, as it was at the instance of this gentleman that I had altered my date of return from September 1st to September 20th, when he said lie would also be returning to India, and the boat leaving on the latter date was, said he, one of the two Bateaux de Luxe belong ing to the Company. He had often obliged mo with a loan of his books for reading. The ship arrived at Aden on the morning of 20th July or 9^ days after leaving Bombay. The following runs, taken from the daily af/iche arc extracted from my diary : \u2014 July 11th 1C7 l'2th 190 July 16th 170 17th 181 13th 183 18th 223- 14th 171 15th 180 19th 195 20th Aden, anchored U A. M\". Only one passenger came on board from Aden, an Italian. Owing to the heavy sea and the monsoon blowing against us, the voyage was, to say the least, dreadful. The constant rolling and pitching of the ship prevented many from even taking a short promenade. Most of the passengers had to confine themselves to their scats on their canvas or cane chairs, on the upper deck near the aft sky-light or to lounge in the smoking -saloon or if sea- siek to remain in the cabin. At Aden we learnt that the English Mail of July 11th (S. S. \"Assam\") which left Bombay some 24 hours after us, had arrived there a day in advance, and had just left for Suez; Our boat had anchored too far out from the Steamer Point, to enable any of us to go into the town. A Mclver boat and a Ger-* man Lloyd steamed into the harbour before we weighed anchor at 10 o'clock a. li., and it was when sighting the white painted bottom of the Norddeutscher Lloyd China Maih"], [191, "173 homeward bound, that a German passenger (Mr. Willrich, of Ditmar and Company) gave me to understand how fast these boats are, and bow luxuriously they are furnished. When I had heard his description,. I little thought then, that circumstances would arise of themselves and force me as it were to forego my right of a free passage by the Italian boat and, that I'd be travelling by a boat owned by his countrymen \u2014 the nation of Heroes of the Modern Ag& \u2014 and to verify with my own eyes and personal experience the high encomium he had passed on them. From Aden I posted a letter home call ing for my ViUe de Paris bonds to be posted to Paris, care of the Comptoir National d'Escompte de Paris, as in the hurry of my departure from Bombay I had forgotten to take these with me. Steamer's speed in Red Sea : \u2014 July 21st 247 July 23rd 284 22nd 2G2 24th 274 25th Suez anchored 12 o'clock noon; Departure from Suez 10| o'clock p. m. ; Ismailia sighted on 20th 7_ o'clock a.m.; The Captain was kind enough to take me on the bridge and explain to me thence the system of navigating the Canal under Electric Light and by signals given from* the signalling sta tions to the pilot in charge. At Port Said the boat stayed 3 hours, from 3 to 6 o'clock P. M. Here came on board an American Missionary, who was returning from his Egyptian tour and the Italian consul for Port Said with his family, besides many other passengers. The fraternity of what I choose namino- my \"political patients\" had thus increased to three. For of the two Consuls brought from Bombay and Calcutta, both were on my sick-list, and though their confrere from Port Said was notr at least one of his teething child was. Up to this there was hardly a bruit or any indication to justify me in entertaining the least suspicion of the impending mischief. I knew how to face the hauteur and imperiousness of a pro fessional man and a rnedecin militaire, a passenger from the"], [192, "174 Punjab and of his aide Master Griinen, the sot -dis ant Doctor, from Kashmir and Patialla. I knew how to ward off their piking their noses into my work. I had during my two pre vious outward voyages oy the P. and O. both in their 1st and 2nd class, made myself sufficiently familiar with such species of \" Anglo -Indianism. \" But it is no use dwelling on that kind of narrative in a book intended to serve as a Looking-Glass for my Poli-comedie Actors in Europe. I'll not fail, however, to record my precious experience of the kind of treatment Indian passengers receive, while travelling in the boats (the P. and O.) of the Indian bureaucrats, in some of our Verna cular papers for the benefit of future sojourners. For the Indian tourist is so very little accustomed to travel by sea, that unless his eyes are opened and he is told how to conduct him self on board a ship, he is not at all likely to escape the shoals and quicksands, which he so frequently encounters on boats filled entirely with and manned by the countrymen of my Greenhorn, returning home. Life at sea is quite a novelty to an Indian. At times, he is alone, not a single countrymen of his own on whom he can count in case of need or distress. His habits, manners, dress and pose are quite enough to draw the attention of each and all who belong to a different nationality, and are accustomed to different ways of living. It is for these reasons that unless the Indian tourist is well-grounded into the internal economy of a ship, he is likely to find himself every hour in clamp and padlock, and not able to share the enjoyment of a journey which is in itself somewhat monotonous and tame. To delineate well this Poli-comedie, where the White Giant fruitlessly tried to kill a Black Bug (his own subject, no, I beg yourpardon, \" subject of the Viceroy,\" he sends out to rule his Asiatic Shop) it is necessary to take the events in a review order and to survey them from a stand-point elevated enough to be able to look below the surface. Always bearing this object iu mind, I'll now commence to narrate the principal incidents of my outward journey, in a way to enable the reader to con-"], [193, "175 nect or to link one incident with the next which follows it. I'll trespass a little upon the reader's indulgence and ask him to refer to the list of Poli-comedie songs given at pp. 12 \u2014 22 of the first Fascicule of my Looking-Glass and run over Nos. 44 to 51. This will serve as an introduction to his understand- ing the Poli-comedie acts and scenes on board the ship in the Mediterranean (Messina Harbour). The persons referred to in the Poli-comedie Song No. 46 as \"his father\" or the \"priest\" began one evening asking me after the dinner was over, as to what part of Europe I intended visiting this time. He even recom- mended me not to care any more to revisit London and Paris, which I had seen already, and that I should see parts or cities of Europe I have never before seen. I with a frankness natural tome, declared to him, that to make a tour of that sort every- thing depends upon one's time and the amount of metallic force at his command. I declared to him with my usual frank- ness also, that I had started with only \u00a310 in my pocket and that as I had barely time enough to purchase a draft from a Bank, I had left with Mr. Darasha, Rubattino's Head Clerk, the sum of Rs. 400, with instructions to forward a draft for the amount, care of the Head Office, Genoa. I said further tl at after that arrives, I prefer formulating my programme of tour from Genoa. I am strongly inclined to connect this my trans- parency as to the amount of gold I carry in my pocket, with the trap or bait held out to me by one of my political patients, who kept preaching two or three times into my ears that he always kept his boxes open, with his 1,500 frs. in gold, which he would only count every morning to assure himself they were not purloined. This passenger's cabin was in the saloon, room facing mine, and to which I had almost had daily access whet he was laid up sick, up to the time we entered the Red Sea. Even after leaving Port Said too, he took me in his cabin once or twice to show me his grand baggage, the pretty things con tained in it, such as the ostrich feathers and his Indian tinpots and photos &c, and Iso Ruzai or bedding, which he wanted 12"], [194, "176 to cany with him to Paris, where he said he expected to be transferred as Charge d'Affaires. I may note here en passant, for the edification of my reader, that this political patient had only given up his Indian quilt bedding on my telling him, tint he would be making an exhibition of himself before the European passengers in the train on the Continent, were he to carry with him his old soiled Ruzai, and the best use he could make of it was to make a present of it to his cabin waiter. Coup de Sonnette. \u2014 On surveying the whole series of events which followed one after another from the time we left Port Said, I am inclined to think that my White Giant had first very surreptitiously begun here in the Mediterranean, his plan of campaign to chase out his Red Rag. One morning, while I was in my cabin, I distinctly heard this my political patient, telling (at 7 o'clock tea-time) his colleague on board, the newly arrived political, in the presence of the Triumvirate, consisting of the confrere, his wife and their Master Griinen, that he had taken me to be a very nice man and that he had also shown me the photos of his family, &c. I suppose it was by way of rejoinder to the new arrival from Port Said, whom I am much inclined to look upon as the accredited agent of my White Giant's Christmas Pantomime in Rome, \u2014 Madame McDuff of Canadian Burmah. It was from this morning that I began to feel somewhat shaky. However I did not at all suspect the new political visitor from Port Said, who, my \" priest \" had told me, was a Consul and going on a month's privilege leave to Leghorn. The morning following this sort of talk (overheard by me from my cabin), I found my \" priest, \" a nice, honest and frank sort of man, not at all in terms of that entente cordiale, as he was with me up to our ship's arrival at Port Said. Every now and then, both at breakfast and dinner, I would hear the members of the Trium virate indulging in a sort of concealed language given in their Poli-comedie Songs Nos. 45, 46, 47, appended to the preface of the 1st Fascicule already published. Still I could not read the barometric indications of the storm or riot my \"White Giant"], [195, "177 was manipulating for me. Seated in a chambre of his White hall Castle, my White Giant could direct all Poli-comedie acts and scenes through the medium of his pantomime troupe scattered all over Europe and donning its political uniform. It is in the cities of Europe that the sensitive points or wrong ends of our Giant exist, and which the Bug had once scratched in 1880-81 in a way enough to madden him. The scratching then done was not felt, as it came to his knowledge too late to take any measures to crush the Bug. As the Bug at the time was on his way home to India, the Giant thought it pru dent to allow him to march there quietly, making a note at the same time in his Secret Service Despatch Book, that that Indian or the Black Bug was a dangerous man, a wrong-footed beggar, and ought on no account to be allowed to march again to the White Giant's Home, sweet Home, or to his neighbour's ginger-bread palace,\u2014 his autumnal playground. This note was communicated to the Giant's Indian shop and recorded in the Secret Service Book by his Manager and agents in Bom bay, where the Bug resided. These men sent a message to the White Giant at his Indian Branch Office, in London, saying that to their great surprise within the short space of three hours, the Bug had marched out of his Indian Cage and had sailed by the Italian boat, will land in Italy and will be passing through Italy on his way up to the capitals of Europe. The Giant was naturally afraid of again letting the dangerous Indian show himself in Eurojn. He recalled the severe pain of scratching that was given him in 1880-81 in the cafes of the Quartier Latin, Paris, and resolved immediately to leave no means untried to chase him back to India. Some of the means conceived with this object were perfectly degoutant, insensate, and which no man or giant of a man would ever think of resorting to, especially in the case of an Indian Bug like the Tourist. What these means were is indicated suffi ciently in the list of Poli-comedie songs and Hungarian Waltzes at pp. 12-22 published in my homeward journey."], [196, "178 Before reaching Messina, the irritation which the political feeler of Madame McDuff of Rome had caused while the boat was in the Mediterranean, was, every now and then, manifested, especially from the quarter of the Punjab Triumvirate, seated opposite to the Tourist at the dining* table. The Tourist had given his book of Baedeker's Manual of Conversation to the female member of the Triumvirate, and one evening before arriv- ing at Messina, he was startled and pained to hear this person, past the age of 45 and a mother of some three grown-up chil- dren, pretending to read sentences from that book of Travel Talk and insinuatingly calling the Tourist \" Topaz,\" \" Butler.\" The wisest course under these circumstances, was to take no notice of such chienne enragee, from what cause the Tourist was still in the dark. It is this very passenger who sang the Poli-comedie Song No. 49, and about which a reference is also made in one of my letters to Calcutta published in the Appen- dix marked No. 18, p. 156. Monsieur le Mari of this passen- ger would constantly try to pump the Tourist out by frequently telling him \"Italy isa nice place to settle.\" Also at times \" When will you be going to London ?,\" especially during the after-dinner promenade on the deck at 8 or 9 o'clock. For some of his insulting remarks, evidently levelled against the Tourist, he was once given such a nice little cut, that he could not help but cry out one evening on the dinner-table, \" Is he a gentle- man ? \" This was a sufficient signal to the Tourist to desist from blistering such a bully any more. His wife's impertinent curiosity as to what part of Europe the Tourist wanted to visit, was rightly kicked off by befooling her that he was about making a grand tour this time, from Paris to Vienna and Hamburg to Rome, and that as regards London he was not sure he would visit that city, but should he go, his stay there would not be longer than a week. At Paris he will be staying two or three weeks, and further that the date of his return to India he preferred leaving unfixed, so very much depending on circum- stances."], [197, "179 Guct-Apens. \u2014 But the actual declaration of war between the Wliite Giant and his Indian Bug was not made till the ship entered the Gulf of Naples. A lot of passengers came on board at Messina, Italian artistes belonging to a theatrical troupe returning to Napoli, about 25 or 30 in number, and a few other passengers, among whom was a young man about 26 or 30 years of age. He was evidently a demi-Anglais, judging by his somewhat coloured appearance. He pretended not to know English much, and always preferred to talk German or French. He always wore a smiling appearance and would invariably keep grinning directly he would sight the Tourist. He was accompanied by a lady, who he said was his sister-in-law, une veritable Anglaise, for she spoke pure Queen's English and had a Scotch cast of countenance. \"While this man wore a smiling appearance, the femme ac- companying him had a serious angry spiteful look. Both of them did not part company of the Tourist, till the ship anchored at Genoa. The Tourist naturally began to look upon this pair, man and woman, as another feeler of the \"White Giant, more confidential than the one on board from Port Said, sent by his Agent in Italy, Madame McDuff. His surmise was not far from wrong. For it was in the Messina Harbour, directly the boat had weighed anchor at 2 o'clock, that my White Giant notified war, and his first gun was fired by a man of the Latin race, the Tourist's political patient, carrying 1,500 frs. in gold lying scattered in his boxes, which he said he was in the habit of leavino- open in his cabin. This man, marching past the Tourist on the deck with another new passenger from Messina, keeps repeating 3 or 4 times, when nearing him, his Poli-comedie song \" Je croyais bien qu'il est imbecile.\" This song was taken up by a couple of male Italian artistes, young lads barely 25, but who it seems after some reflection or at the instance of their countryman on board from Port Said and a member of the Corps Diplomatic who was also close by, had the good sense to guard silence thenceforward."], [198, "180 Napoli arrived early on the morning of 31st July. The great bulk of the passengers got off and to the great relief of the Tourist, the Punjab Triumvirate and the two leading members of the Corps Diplomatic (the Bombay and the Port Said pas sengers) had all disembarked at Napoli. Of the White Giant's Agents now left on board and evidently working under instruc tions from the Madame in Charge d'Affaires Etrangercs at Rome, was the sun-burnt passenger from Messina with his sister-in law. These were the only two passengers on board along with the 3 or 4 that were bound for Genoa from Bombay. Directly after breakfast, the Tourist left at about 9 o'clock for a visit to the town of Naples. This he had seen in 1870 when he had stayed here for a couple of nights, awaiting the arrival of S.S. Anadyr from Marseilles, on his way back to India in August of that year. Before leaving for the town, he did not care to ex change parting salutations with the Punjab Triumvirate, Mon sieur et Madame La Massage and Master Griinen or with the sea-sick man of Aden, the Tourist's political patient. This last had the knack, however, to personally thank the Tourist surreptitiously, late in the evening preceding the ship's arrival at the Napoli Harbour. I say surreptitiously, advisedly, for he took advantage of a few minutes, when he was unseen by the Triumvirate members of my White Giant's family to enter the Tourist's cabin, pretend to interest himself in his Pharmacy room, and there to thank him and to bid him au revoir in advance as it were. I should have liked very much to lay bare this Portuguese Gunner of my White Giant, by recording here his opinions as to many choses Indiennes, such as the Club Anglais at the landing pier, Bombay; les fournaux Anglais of India; tbe Bombay Native Shets (i.e., merchants and bankers) ; the Quetta pre parations and the necessary effects of the opposition shop started by our White Giant's competitor in Asia, close to his Indian mart. But as all these have not the least bearing upon the Poli-comedie Looking-Glass, I would no more touch upon that"], [199, "181 subject. Moreover, I should like to look upon all such com munications of the Latin Gun's as confidential and not worth my while to make them public. Although he had the bad sense of kicking me, more to ingratiate himself into the good graces of the Punjab Triumvirate Company, as its sympathiser and friend, I would not, in return, place him (as he well deserves to be placed) into that awkward position of deserving a kick from my White Giant's Agents in Bombay, should he ever chance to return back here in his diplomatic uniform, driving the Donkey Crane of which he seemed to be so very fond. Before I drop down this my Gun of the Latin race in the Napoli Harbour, I would simply call the reader's attention to his Poli-comedie song of Donkey Engine (No. 45, p. 20) wherein he seemed to be strongly bent upon amusing the Madame La Massage of Murray Hills, especially with his donkey demonstrations of how the donkey crane of the ship will march \" comme ca,\" after the ship goes into its dock at the port of destination, Genoa. It was at Napoli that the Captain's cabin -steward, who from his knowledge of English acquired in America used to act as the Tourist's interpreter with the Italian Equipage, during his morning rounds to the sick, began singing his Poli-comedie song denoted by No. 50, p. 21, I. Fase. When the same ship was again in Port Said on her return voyage from India (2nd November) the Tourist went on board to pay a visit to the Captain. Seeing this garcon, the Tourist questioned him as to what he meant by hinting so stupidly in a language of which any person would be ashamed. The only sort of reply he could then get from this garcon was that he guarded silence and walked off. It was from Napoli that I began to read and to interpret correctly the barometric indications that were showing themselves. Even the Captain said, \"Leave the boat if you wish, your work is finished,\" though about half a dozen of the equipage were still on the sick-list. The boat left Napoli Harbour at 10 o'clock p. m. (July 31st) and arrived at"], [200, "182 Genoa on the morning of the 2nd August (6 o'clock). Here constant questions were put to the Tourist, as to the programme of his tour. It is invariably my habit to kick off impertinent inquirers, men who should have no reason to interest them- selves in a stranger's affairs, by putting them on false scent. And just as my Madame La Massage was sold by tbe flourish of a grand tour programme, some of the Italian members of the equipage were sold too. They were informed of my in ten- tion to visit first their great city of Rome \"the city of churches and popes,\" before thinking of going to any other town or city of Europe. I left the boat at 7f o'clock a. m. directly she was in dock and walked to the Head Office of the Company (Via Balbi) to demand my letters from Bombay. For, without my remittance draft I felt perfectly paralyzed and unable to move anywhere out of Genoa or even out of the boat too. Of the \u00a310 in gold I had brought with me, about \u00a34 were spent in purchasing some necessary articles of clothing at Port Said and at Naples and only \u00a36 had remained. I could not conceive how a letter posted on the day following our departure from Bombay, July 11th, could not have reached Genoa till August 2nd. The clerk in charge of the Passenger's letters showed me a number of letters, awaiting arrival of passengers, but not one to my address. Returned back to the ship for breakfast. The cabin saloons were all closed and the Captain already seated for breakfast. I told him there was no letter for me in the office up till then, and expressed to him my great anxiety at not finding any. He said perhaps the Indian mail letters of July 11th from Bombay may not have reached Genoa and perhaps were still on their way from Brindisi. After some reflection or rather hesitation on his part, he called upon his garcon Aubeau to put a plate for me. With an uneasy mind I could hardly relish my breakfast. While on the table I sounded the Cap tain's mind as to whether there were any chances for me to get boat to America and he said there was another compartment"], [201, "]\u25a0\u25a0\u2022\u25a0 or department fr>r hnots of the same Company running between Itstlj .onl Amevi'-a . and if J inipiiied (here I should l.'arn all ah.. id.

I at once sent a telegram to Bombay saying \"Remit by telegraph, 800. \" The figure 8 was transmitted 7, as I have found it after my return to Bombay on the Eastern Telegraph Company's tele gram. 9 words costing 45 frs. My Genoa message of the 2nd August was received in Bombay on Sunday morning the 3rd, and on Tuesday the 5th at 12 o'clock noon, I was handed by the head of the Rubattino Co.'s Passenger Department, a message from Bombay received on the 4th at Genoa, saying \" Apply Rubattino.\" I was given an Italian Bank note for 1000 Liras or Italian francs, and a receipt in duplicate taken from me for the amount paid. I was also that day given the equivalent of my fee agreed upon in Bombay for acting as Surgeon to the ship, viz. :\u2014 277-05 frs. (at Rs. 13| for every 25 frs.=\u00a3l.) and a certificate was also granted to me signed by the Co.'s Inspector General Monsieur Crespi, expressing their greatest satisfaction both as regards my professional merit and behaviour (p 29, 1. Fase). Directly I got these, I decided to quit that very evening the little dull town of Genoa, where I was perfectly sick of waiting for my remittance draft and doing nothing. I cashed the Italian Bank note at an English bankers' (Garnet and Brown) and in converting the Italian 1000 Liras note into francs in gold, I had to suffer a loss of 8^ frs. Before leaving the boat at 3 in the after- noon, I had to bid adieu to some of the officers of the ship present there, and to some of whom I frankly indicated on their ques tioning me again, my programme of tour then conceived, viz.: \u2014 to Frankfort, Wiesbaden, Berlin, Hamburg, thence to London and Paris. From Paris I had also thought of taking a run to Bordeaux, thence via Marseilles, Toulon on to Nice, and along the coast to Genoa.

To add to my miserable existence on board the ship in Dock, I may here call the reader's attention to the extremely dangerous way of getting access to the boat, at nights especially. The Dock gates are generally closed from 8 o'clock p.m. and only one or two gates guarded by the Customs sentries are kept open. To find my way thence to the boat, I had to cross 2 or 3 lines of rail over which goods engines were constantly being shunted ; and quite near the basin wall I had to jump over the ropes holding the cargo boats in position. At times a heavy- shower of rain would make the whole plot of ground round about the ship's siding full of mire and mud. Under such disadvantages, it was simply miserable to be living on board the ship, and enjoying the Rubattino Company's bounty there, until the agent had the good grace to pay me off and hand my Bombay letter of remittance, should it have come to him any time before or during my stay in Genoa. I even requested the clerk in charge of passengers' letters to tele- graph to Napoli, and call for my letters, should any have been redirected to that port. He distinctly assured me that was not the case and there was no need to telegraph. I even went to the bureau dc poste, Central Post Office, and demanded if any letter to my address had been received there from India, addressed pos te restante. In short, I could not understand how my letter of remittance posted July 11th, could not have arrived when the Bombay mail letters of that day were de- livered here nearly a' week ago. The explanation submitted to my mother by the Indian Chef de bureau, Rubattino's Local Agency, was to the effect that it was a mistake on my part to have called for the draft at Napoli and not at Genoa. My friend Mr. Ardesir Guzdar, of the French Bank, in his letter dated"], [205, "187 Bombay, 3rd October (received in London, October 22nd), writes to me, \"On receipt of your letter, Darasha called upon me at the Bank and told me, that his letter to your address containing the remittance of Rs. 400 was forwarded in accordance with instructions from you to Naples and as it was not called for, the Rubattino Office sent it back to Bombay. He shewed me at the same time the 2nd of the draft in your name, together with a cover bearing Naples post mark.\" In order to clear the mystery, hanging on this matter, I wrote a letter* printed in footnote, to Mr. Darasha, to which he replied as follows : \u2014 \" In reply to your very kind and courteous letter of this day, \" I have to inform you that the draft on London for equivalent \" of Rs. 400 was bought by me from the Chartered Bank of \"India, Australia and China on Friday, the 11th July (the \"very next day after you sailed), and was despatched on the same day by the English Mail in a letter addressed to you in \" care ofthe Company' s Office, at Genoa.

While passing the Dock Gate, I had to submit my boxos for the Customs visile there. This was the first port or place where a Customs examination of my baggage took place, and I would here draw the attention of the Indian Tourist to be always on his guard, when such an examination is made. On the lines of railway of Russia, Germany, France and England, and everywhere that passengers have to cross from one frontier to another, a visite of the baggage invariably takes place, and I am glad to record here my impres sion that during no Customs examination did I lose a single article out of my boxes. I lay a stress upon this fact, as to my great astonishment I found my coat brush and my favourite Moscow cap missing, after I reached Frankfort. I knew I had put them in my portmanteau before leaving the ship's cabin and I still suspect (I hope I am wrong) that it was during the Customs examination in the Dock Customs of Genoa, that these were purloined. By whom I know not. But as the black silk Russian cap was a present to me from my friend Mr. Ardesir Guzdar of the Cornptoir de Paris, in Bombay, who had brought it from Moscow when he was there in his tour in 1888 to Russia vid Persia, I feel its loss up to this day. IN GERMANY. From Genoa I booked to Frankfort-on-the-Maine direct, paying 73 francs for a second class Express fare. Nothing unusual to record on the line of transit. The St. Gothard Tunnel was passed very early in the morning ; and I regret I could not at that dark hour enjoy the sight of this long tunnel"], [207, "189 between Italy and Switzerland, 9 miles long, which took a great many years to pierce. A Swiss passenger before reaching Bale showed me the position of this tunnel on a map he had with him and demanded of me, if had I ever seen any of the beautiful parts of Switzerland, his native country. I mentioned to him the parts of the Kashmir of Europe I had visited during my first tour, viz.. Mt. Blanc, Chamonix Valley and across the Simplon, a descent tothe Como lakes and Varese; and during my 2nd tour from Genoa to Interlaken, Wengern-Alpes and vid Lake Constance to Miinchen. From Bale a gentleman with a lady came in my carriage, bound for Hambourg. The gentleman knew only German, and could hardly talk English. But the German lady knew English and spoke it with sufficient clearness and fluency for me to be able to converse with her. She had the kindness to question me if I knew German, and feared without a knowledge of that great language of Central Europe, I would not be able to take much interest in travelling iu Germany. However, she did not discourage me, and said I should find both Frankfort and Berlin worth my visit. At no part of my tour on the Conti nent was the necessity of having, at least a colloquial knowledge of the great language of Central Europe so early impressed on me as by this lady passenger. My subse quent experience has confirmed the value of her opinion. In my unpublished letter to the Editor of the London Times, dated Paris, September 13th, extracts from which appear in the appendix to my first fascicule already published, I have dwelt on this very fact and wrote therein : \u2014 The entire European Continent has hitherto remained a sealed book to the natives of India, I mean the mercantile, commercial, and educated classes of Parsees, Khojas, Memons and others, to whom crossing the sea is not forbidden ; and why ? Simple ignorance of the languages spoken here. Hence it is that whenever a native of India is landed on the Continent of Europe, he flies out of it and shuts"], [208, "190 himself up in London, as soon as he can, without seeing much of the Continent that is picturesque, and which from a commer cial as well as educational standpoint ought to be known to him. Interesting sights in Frankfort -on- the -Maine. \u2014 I arrived at Frankfort on the 0th day of August at 3-35 o'clock p. m. (21 hours' journey from Genoa). My choice of the Hotel Central was made at the recommendation of the gentleman, bound for Hambourg, who travelled with me in the train from Bale up wards. I have already referred to this city in my return journey (see p. 42 of the 1st Fascicule published). I'll only content myself here with naming the sights, in visiting which I employed my time in that city. Hauptbanhof (the large Central station) ; Schiller platz, where is to be seen Schiller's monument; Goethe's monument ; Kaisersalle (Imperial Hall); the Zeil, the Borse (Exchange Hall) ; the Opera house; Panorama; Palmen Garten and Zoologischer Garten with its Aquarium. I would here note that neither at Frankfort nor \\n the town of Genoa, nor on the line of Railways connecting these two cities, or in any of their Buffets or Refreshment Rooms, did a single man ever notice me. In my costume Europeen I was absorbed in the multitude, like a drop in the ocean. I was the unobserved unit in the multitude, and not a soul cared to pay the least attention as to who I was ? where I came from ? where I was going to ? / was moving here just as I was throughout my previous two European tours. A greater portion of my resi dence in Europe in 1880-81 was passed in Paris, where On jamais faire I'attention on the movements of any stranger. Up to my entry into Wiesbaden, I did not feel at all embarrassed about enjoying my tour. Wiesbaden.\u2014 I left Frankfort for Wiesbaden on the 9th August by 8 o'clock train (3 marks, 2nd class Express f are,transit of 50 minutes) and arrived at Wiesbaden at about 9 o'clock. This is a pretty sanitarium of Germany, which I had once visited"], [209, "191 in 1876, and where I had visited two splendid Physical and Chemical Laboratories, kept by father and son, Professors Fresinius, and where I had seen English students from Victoria University, Manchester, and other places taking a course of practical technical analysis. In visiting these, my intention this time was to combine business with recreation. I thought of recouping my lost health here, in the pure bracing air of Taunus : and had with that sort of intention even asked a German gentle man, whom I had followed up the Neroberg Hill to name me a pension (Boarding House) should there be one. For I was very uncomfortable in the Eisenbahn Hotel I had temporarily gone to. Directly I landed I left my baggage at the Cloak room (which is indicated in German by the word Gepiick) and walked to the Hotel Taunus, near the terminus. I had formerly put up at this very hotel and wanted a small room for from 2 to 2-50 marks. The English-speaking chef de service of the hotel said there was no room available for that price ; but if I were to take a room for 4-50 marks for a day or two, he would give me the first choice of a cheaper room directly it became vacant. To this sort of arrangement I declined to accede ; and the proprietor came up offering a cheaper room in his own neighbouring establishment .called the Eisenbahn Hotel. There I was shown a room on the third floor, to which one has to be led up a tortuous and dark staircase. I temporarily took it up and handing to the garcon the Gepack receipt to fetch my baggage from Jhe station, I left for a book-stall to purchase a small or concise guide-book* for Wiesbaden. This Ibought for75pfg. (9r/.) and left by the princi pal road, Wilhelmstrasse, to the Museum. Finding this building was not open to visitors, I mounted a tram-car, passing * Towns and Landscapes of all the World, published by T. Laurengic, Zurich. Weisbadkn. Sole agency for Wiesbaden : G. Starck, Book \u25a0Beller. These are the cheapest pocket illustrated guide-books for the most celebrated, remarkable and frequented towns and landscapes of the whole world. Universally sold at ;i 11 continental book-stalls. Price of each number 50 psg. or G pence. 13"], [210, "192 in front of the Museum, continuing my journey as far as the terminus. Thence with about half dozen Germans, I walked up to the steam-and-cogwheel cars, and fchence following the group, I found niy way on to the top of the Neroberg Hill. It was a rainy morning, and as the view ef the Rhine valley with the town of Mainz and the magnificent Rhine river too, were all shrouded in mist or fog at the time, we all returned by the same steam-and-cogwheel cars, and I walked home to the Eisenbahn Hotel. This is a third cla_. establishment, maintained by the proprietor of Hotel Taunus and in close communication with it. I found at the bar of thi-< my hotel, the same chef de service, with whom I had to deal in the other establishment, and who had also lodged me here. Hil demeanour towards me was rather rude ; almost insulting. I had seen sufficiently in my two previous tours the class of men he represented, and I knew well how to notice his steam ; it may be for uot taking his 4-50 marks room or for what other reasons I could not then understand. I took my dejeuner here at the table d'hote hour (1 o'clock). It was very miserable, looking to the price I was charged ; wine also indifferent. So I decided at once to leave it. As I said above I was on a look out for a pension, where I could lodge at a reasonable price for a week or more. Not being able to find out one immediately, I asked a German gentleman whom I met during my afternoon promenade on the slopes of Nerothal to indicate to me a good respectable hotel, where I could get a decent room and a good table. He mentioned to me the name of the hotel he had himself put up in. I lost no time in going there (Hotel Weins), and after making a choice of the room (2 marks per diem, no extra charge for service), I left for the Tavern Hotel (Eisenbahn) and asked for my bill, got my baggage down and at once removed that veiy evening to the comfortable hotel in Bahnhofs trasse, 17. From here I went in the evening at about 6J o'clock to the Kursaal Garden and Concert Room. Entrance 1 mark."], [211, "193 \" They say he is mad,\" cries out an English woman. \u2014 Here after a promenade in the park or Kursaal Garden I went to the Restaurant and thence found my way to the Salon-de-Lecture (Reading Room) of the Kursaal Establishment. While passing into the room I heard a young Englishwoman seated in a group with a lot of others of her own age openly cry out, \" They say he is mad!\" I took no notice of her and walked straight up to the reading table, and took to reading an English paper, the London Times. To my left was a middle-aged man with his back towards the table reading a newspaper. To my right were two or three English-speaking ladies. These commenced whispering among each other \u2014 smiling and whispering. The man to my left pretended to be suddenly startled, as it were by my presence in his neighbourhood, directly I opened out the newspaper and wanted to turn its pages. He also commenced surveying my face. I could not divine what nationality he be- longed to, although he was reading an English paper. For I took no notice of this old man, whose dodge was, it seemed to me, very likely, to pretend to be frightened at my presence, and let others seated close to him (there were more than a dozen people seated at the time at the reading table) understand that I was a lunatic and a dangerous person to be allowed to move freely among them, though decently clothed and conducting my- self respectably. I at once divined the dodge ; for I was to a cer- tain extent prepared for it by my White Giant's guns fired in the Messina harbour and by his wirepulling on board the Italian boat \u2014 very, very surreptitiously \u2014 from Port Said, but openly from Napoli and Genoa harbour. I knew it was all an insensate trick to scare me away from Paris. By handling what I prefer call in0, the Parisian broom to boycott an unpleasant man, my White Giant thought he would be recalling the Parisian mischief I had to face in 1881, after the These de Doctorat irritation. I have tried to explain in my letter to one of my countrymen in England, headed \" Below the Surface,\" and written from Paris, dated 24th September 1890, how I happened to become an"], [212, "194 unpleasant man to the Ecole de Medecine Quartier iu 1881 ; and how fruitlessly the Ecole de Medecine men and their friends in the Quartier Latin had tried to chase me out of Paris then ( 1 Ide Appendix C). The Parisian \" Fou \" and \" Drole \" trick may succeed to heat the brain of some oftheir own countrymen, i it ms there was nothing in common between them and me,\u2014 I mean as the mind of an Asiatic is differently constituted to the mind of an European, it seems not at all likely that the same species of heating materials which would heat their heads and drive them up to a pitch of insanity, would equally serve the purpose to smoke an Indian, especially of my experience and age. My White Giant, although he has been ruling in his Asiatic mart now more than a century, has yet not that thorough insight into the ways and manners ofthe people under his sway as we would naturally expect him to possess. For he is after all an \u25a0\u2022 ouvrier,\" or a \"travailleur,\" or a \"boutiquier\" or a British tar (sailor), and moreover he belongs to the \" abdominal type \" of human species. As such he is not supposed to command that degree of tact, judgment and foresight which are so appa rent in his neighbours on the Continent \u2014 I mean of \"the nervous type,\" and whose mental traits are differently constituted from those of the \" Nation de boutiquiers,\" whom I prefer naming my Time -is -money man and my White Baby. To Paris I'll go. \u2014 I knew well, I had studied in fact his ignorance on this point, and felt certain in my mind that he, my White Giant, will ultimately not succeed in chasing me out of Europe, until I revisit its city of paradise, Paris, and see the other large capital cities never before seen by me, such as Berlin and Petersbourg. It was in order to give the whispering femmes Anglaises, seated close to my right in the reading-room, a cut as it were, I took in hand a paper of Paris, the Figaro, and perused it. This was a sort of silent hint on my part to my White Baby's agents in Wiesba den that, try as much as you can to scaie me away from Paris, to Paris I'll go. Paris 1 love, for it is the only city in Europe"], [213, "195 where the means of enjoying life are artistically cultivated to the highest pitch which modern art is capable of, and that of all cities of Europe, it is to Paris alone that I'll be attracted as a magnet, whenever I_happen to be there. My White Giant, it seems to me, still smarted with the recollections of pain I had caused him by my feebly scratching his face in 1880-81 when in Paris, and it was natural that he should be again apprehensive of similar scratches from me there. My sudden presence in Europe again (after some ten years this time) agitated my White Giant not a little. He set his entire heart to work up the problem, how to chase back quickly this Indian . Fenian out of the European soil and to chain him once more back to India. The way he set about working this problem was not his own ; not at all suited to the nationality and the mental constitution of his opponent \u2014 his Red Rag ; it was not at all original or new. The White Giant dissected by a Political Anatomist. \u2014 In fact our White Giant's baby-like brain could not think out any new plan. Although mighty as a giant in his wealth and possessions, he is, unfortunately for him, gifted with the brains of a child. If our White Giant were to get himself dissected piece-meal by some skilled political anatomist, and his anatom ical structure exposed and explained, it will be found that his skeleton consists only of countless White Babies, so super imposed over one another and arranged as to seem from a distance a mighty giant, even to the westward of the Suez Canal. Before shrewd or travelled eyes, however, the Giant's pose can not long be sustained. Try as much as he can to pose as a Giant before the observing Orientals, his actions betray him. I am satisfied our White Giant has made himself so sufficiently transparent to me this time (and which he never was before) that I could no longer dread him with awe and apprehension. I have already begun to look upon him, though seeming a Giant in size and strength, as my White Baby. As such I must look over his childish pranks and no more think of chassis-"], [214, "196 ing him, but must caress him like an enfant and treat him to my gateau sucre or gateau de riz Indien. This I have been doing all along my tour, seated in his own mansion as well as in that of his theatrical neighbour on the other side of the Channel. Un Mouchard.\u2014 Well, after the second gun fired at the Kur saal Reading-room of Wiesbaden, on the evening of 9th August what follows ? It seems to me the White Giant was in doubt as to the advisability of closing with me so soon in the very com mencement of my tour, so he began to tatcr I'cnnemi through his feelers. One of these was a Hungarian, who came close to me, where I was standing and enjoying the sweet and rich music of the Kur-band in company with the German gentleman who had shown me the Neroberg Hill in the morning. He preferred talking with me in French, said \" He did not understand Eng lish,\" just perhaps to see how much colloquial knowledge I possess of that continental language. lie wanted to know from me the number of troops in Bombay, if it is well defended, the number and location ofthe \u25a0military stations in its neighbourhood, and so forth. My replies to all his military queries were such as to lead him to hint to our neighbour the German and tell him in the German language that I was an un homme pr/ venu, sur ses gardes et doublement fort. Ever since the Messina gun and the Naples and Genoa harbour signals, I was an un homme avert! en vaut deux (forewarned and forearmed). Thanks to my White Giant's Baby in one of the capital cities of Italy, Madame McDuff (who was in her spinster days taken for a celebrated prima donna in the Giant's Canadian Burma Theatre), I could already see through her stupid ways of sounding me, if I still entertain any Anti-Anglais views ; if I am still a hater of my White Giant's arms and army. Forewarned and forearmed. \u2014 Hence it was that I was able to keep at bay, at arm's length, the Anglais passenger at the table d'hote, Hotel Weims, on the day following (Sunday noon, 10th August) when he was singing to me his Poli-comedie song"], [215, "197 marked No. 7. (1st Fascicule, p. 13.) By questioning me as to the \u2022' hoarded wealth of India, \" he wanted to drive me to Mr. Dadabhoy Naoroji's Essay on the Poverty of India, copies of which I had the honour to obtain from its author in London and to distribute them (with his knowledge of course) in Paris during my student days there. When he questioned me how to distinguish a Eurasian, I drove him off the subject by tell ing him, \" I was not a Eurasian, but a Parsee in costume Europeen. \" The drift of the other questions, of this self-styled English canvasser on the Continent of some Insurance Company in Edinburgh, will soon appear to any reader accustomed to the process of tater I'ennemi. When he asked me to fix the exact date of my going to Edinburgh, I could not but laugh within myself at his conceit or arrogance. I knew that he was behaving just as his other countrymen the Greenhorns of Albion, and with a presumption characteristic of his race fancied, that I was yet a child and that like an innocent child I could hardly see through the drift of his questions. I wish these pages fall any of these days before the evergreen eyes of this my Greenhorn of a John Bull,\u2014 my neighour at the table d'hote, Hotel Weims, on Sunday, 10th August. He will only then be able to see me in my true colour. All his soundings as the accredited agent of Madame MeDuff or of her brother, Sir Mad Hour, could barely probe me. I believe he must have informed these the principal pantomime actors of my White Giant, saying that the replies to all Ms interrogatories to the Indian Fenian were such as to merit the expression\u2014 Jeter de la poudre aux yeux. I felt so disgusted with this man's very droll queries, that at last I pretended to be busy writing my home letters, and left the table for my room, where I jotted down as hurriedly as I could many of his Poli- comedie songs and phrases. The Barricade.\u2014 As a natural consequence of the sort of riponse from me to the soundings or probings of my White Giant, he became more suspicious, more sensitive, more resolved to boycott and to chase the Tourist out of his playground\u2014 the"], [216, "198 European Garden. To carry out his mad resolve, he let loose all his army of White Babies on the Continent, all his Green horns of John Bulls residing in the cities of Europe or travelling there. Each and all of these children of our White Giant were told, and to those whom he cannot reach through the medium of his consulates, he preached to them from the pulpit of Eng lish Churches on the Continent, to persecute and to ruu down the Fenian, the Indian Anti-Anglais, the Indian ingrained with French veneer, wherever he may chance to be seen and wherever he may be found. Well, the question now to ask is, after all, did he succeed in killing the Indian bird . No. Aud why not? Pray, read my answer in this my Looking glass, got up especially for my favourite femme Anglaise. li you like, ma cherie, take it into your boudoir and peruse it in secrecy. Two types of John Bull.\u2014 As an \"Indian\" and as a \" subject of the Viceroy \" I will be the last person to look fully in the face of the countryman of my \" L'empereur des ludous. \" For I owe my education, intelligence and knowledge to my association with him. To my mind John Bull, the Em peror of the Hindoos, is quite a different type of person to what I call my Greenhorn of a John Bull, \u2014 always living in a sea girt isle and always given to hammering his own ideas, and to magnify his India and always crying \" Time is money.\" Therefore it is that he has hardly time or leisure to think first and to act afterwards. This my Looking-glass is more for the latter than the former species of John Bull. Sight-seeing at Wiesbailen. \u2014 As it is my intention to write out hereafter at leisure a separate hand-book, either in my own Vernacular or in English, for my countrymen so fond of travelling in Europe, I'll detail therein my description of the various sights I saw in the principal cities of Europe. I'll also give in such a hand-book the names of the hotels I would recommend, the cheapest means of travelling and residing in these cities; also whatever commercial, industrial or other"], [217, "199 interesting intelligence which I could gather and compress for them. In short, How to see Europe and its people, will be my' motto for whatever sort of hand-book in English or Vernacu lar I'll be hereafter publishing for the use of my countrymen. I therefore content myself simply with noting down how my time was employed during my visit to some of the cities of Europe in this my tour. August 9th. \u2014 Morning to the Neroberg Hill to view the panorama of the Rhine Valley from the Nero temple. Kursaal Garden and Reading-room in the evening. 10th. \u2014 By steam tram to Biebrich, thence across the Rhine on a ferry boat to Mainz, and back to hotel for dinner. Evening promenade round about the Kursaal Garden to Sonnenberg ; thence ascended through the Taunus Forest and came to the Neroberg Hotel. Here seated in the terrace of its restaurant enjoyed the lovely panorama of the Rhine, under a full sunshine, and returned to town after a good walk. Departure for Berlin. \u2014 11th August. Decided late last night, after some reflection, to quit Wiesbaden and to give up my intention of enjoying the bracing ozonic air of this sanitarium for a week. I thought to myself that the place being cheap is one of the principal inducements to the thrifty babies of our White Giant to throng here. I found it so very full of les ehapeaux Anglais, with whom I had already by this time antici pated a good duel on the political ehess-board of Europe, that I said to myself the best course for me will be to quit it. So this morning I left Wiesbaden for Berlin. My hotel-keeper had kindly informed me that if I left Wiesbaden by 7 o'clock train, I should be in time at Frankfort to catch the Berlin Express which leaves Frankfort 1Q minutes after. Before leav ing Hotel Weims I saw its proprietor, Madame Weins, widow, a very obliging and honest person. She questioned me if I was a Frenchman, and if not at least if I spoke French, just to learn what knowledge I possess of the French language. She persisted in talking with me in French, although she spoke"], [218, "200 English as fluently or perhaps more fluently than myself. At Frankfort at the Opera House, one evening two or three persons, I remember well, did ask me if I was a Francais ; if I had been to Paris, etc.\u2014 all such queries will be interpreted fully in my Berlin notes (vide Poli-comedie song No. 12, p. 14, 1st Fa- . Berlin is 550 kilometres (342 miles) from Frankfort, and this distance is traversed by an Express in nine hours and a half. The Express stops only at six principal stations on the line ; 1\u00b0 Ems, 2\u00b0 Bebra, 3\u00b0 Eichenberg, 4\u00b0 Nord Hausan, 5\u00b0 Gutsen, 6\u00b0 Wei senberg. At 5-30 p.m. the 8 o'clock Frankfort Express puts you down at the Friedrichstrasse station or the central station of Berlin. No irritation, no Poli-comedie song in the train. although there were three or four passengers in my compartment. On my way to the hotel, Kaiser Wilhelmstrasse, I was driven through the principal crowded thoroughfares of Berlin, viz., Friedrichstrasse and Unter den Linden, and the sights of these so enchanted me, that I thought within myself that I was in another Paris or another New Paris. A very humorous sketch of Berlin and Berliners is given iu the August number of Har per's New Monthly Magazine (illustrated) by Mr. Theodore Child. When I had perused it, as well as its French synopsis in the Figaro at Paris, I found it so very lifelike and so full of humour and criticism that I have extracted some of it here for the reader's amusement. I stayed in Berlin from 12th to 19th August, during which period my time was fully occupied in sight-seeing. .Mr. Child's Impressions of Berlin. \u2014 Mr. Theodore Child says in his Impressions of Berlin : \u2014 \"Kaiser, war, and beer seem to be the three preoccupations of the inhabitants of Berlin. We might cite many a modern German writer in confirmation of our impressions. From the column of Belle-AUianzplatz to the Konigsplatz (where is the Siegesdenkmaal column in memory of the Franco-German war) is a long way. But we have made that way, and it is one long street. Military laurels lighten or darken everything here. The race that grows"], [219, "201 up between these two points must be warlike and a race of soldiers, and are there not trophies on all sides ? It is through war that we have become what we have become. We used to be a society of humble folks ; we used to live in old-fashioned, uncomfortable, ugly houses, whereas now we have stylish mighty colossal houses, with marble steps, satin wall-hangings, electric bells, and telephones. And what is the source and origin of all these things ? War\u2014 the war of 1864, 1866, and 1870. \" Its Military Craze. \u2014 \" Let us note parenthetically that you cannot walk a hundred yards in any direction in Berlin without being reminded of the victories of the Hohenzollerns. The army is everywhere. No opportunity is neglected of reminding the Berliners that they owe their greatness to the war. The fostering of the military spirit is carried so far, that the veiy oommissionnaires and street sweepers are dressed in martial uniform, while the variety of military, semi -military and would be military caps is so great that a volume might be devoted to this subject alone.\" Modern Berlin and the Berliners. \u2014 Speaking about the general appearance of Berlin, Mr. Child says : \u2014 \" Our first wandering through the streets of Berlin did not fill our souls with that thrill of joy and that sympathetic trepidation of the whole being, which we experienced when we first visited Venice, for instance, or Florence or Constantinople ; nor did they excite that wonderment and eager desire to appreciate which we felt in the great Ame- rican cities like Chicago. Berlin is absolutely wanting in charm, whether of situation, of general aspect, or of historical souvenirs. It is a modern city, but its modern aspect has no marked character and next to no originality. From the time of Frederick the Great, who was the founder of its prosperity, down to the present period of active transformation, which dates from the Franco- German war, the architectural history of Berlin was almost entirely one of imitation and adaptation.\" \" In point of population Berlin is the third city of Europe. In 1859 the capital of the Kingdom of Prussia counted 493,000"], [220, "202 inhabitants ; at the present day the capital of the German Empire has nearly one and a half million of inhabitants. Scarcely one-third of these, it appears, were born Berliners, baptized with Spree water, but all flatter themselves that they are Athenians of the Spree \u2014 \" Spreeathener \" as the local term is ; for the first ambition of the immigrant German who settles at Berlin is to become \" Berlinisirit, \" to assimilate the manner of talking, the sentiments, and opinions of his new and intellectual home. In politics the Berliners are always in opposition : their boast is that they criticise God and the uni verse, and everything iu heaven and earth ; discussion is their great delight ; in their newspapers, their clubs, their beer saloons and meeting places of all kinds, criticism, fault-finding, disputing, are the indispensable conditions of life.\" Beer-drinking its principal Amusement. \u2014 \" The amusements of the Berliners are, besides beer-drinking, which is the first, the last, and the most persistently and endurably popular, music halls, concerts, promenades in the Thiergarten, boating on the Spree, fishing and going to the races at Charlottenberg or at the Hoppegarten. A typical Berlin beer saloon is the Reisch salle, in Leipzigerstrasse, an immense Gothic vaulted hall, like the guard-room of some feudal castle. The roof and white walls are decorated with coats of arms painted in all the crude brilliancy of gules, sable, azure, argent, and or. The wain scoting is wrought in old style, and, so too, are the tables and chairs, sufficient to accommodate hundreds of people. All the. evening a strong orchestra makes the arched roof re-echo, now with a gay waltz, now with a Wagnerian fragment. At the tables are seated whole families, father, mother, and children ; at others young couples are flirting awkwardly and with few words ; at others soldiers are fraternising with civilians and counter- skippers with clerks ; at others you see groups of students with ridiculously small caps, and their faces slashed, seamed and sewn -up like a patchwork c*uilt, for the silly practice of duelling is still held in high honour in the German capital,\""], [221, "203 The Chase begins at Berlin. \u2014 Were I to look at this Poli comedie Anglais in a review order, I am inclined to believe that my persecutor the White Giant, after keeping me somewhat threatened in the boat before landing, preferred to remain in ambush at Frankfort and not at all to show me his hand there. He evidently wanted to know whether I would wend my way to the westward of Frankfort for London and Paris, or go to its east - ward to Berlin and Russia ; and after accurately ascertaining my movements to shape his plan of campaign accordingly. WThen I went to Wiesbaden his frank and honest sille, with a candour which always characterises her, let the cat out of the bag, rather too suddenly, and gave me un bon averti at the Kursaal Hall. Here the second gun was fired I presume without his order or knowledge, by our White Giant's own kith and kin. For at Wiesbaden, too, he seemed to me wavering and hesitating in his plan of action. He preferred lying in ambush. He was only sounding and probing me through his agents, the Continen tal canvasser of an Insurance Company and the Hungarian (?) who had asked me questions, which were not possible for any native of India to answer unless he was a military man, or had servedin some military department of the White Giant's Asiatic- Boutique. It was only at Berlin that he declared himself, of course through his petit-fils. He counted surely upon success in Berlin. For there the Tourist was confined within the four walls of the casernes of his beaufrere, now commanded since his demise in 1888 by his petit fils , born in the year 1859. Being young and promoted too soon to the command of his late good God-fearing father's casernes and troops, he is inexperienced. Up to this, he has not had any baptism of fire, like the only son of Louis Bonaparte. The reader does not require to be told here that this young and dashing Francais of royal blood died not in Europe, but in South Africa, while being led by the White Giant's babies in their Zulu Campaign. An army led by inexperienced Generals cannot gain laurels easily, and the army of continental soldiers employed by our White Giant in"], [222, "204 Berlin to push unto death and misery the Indian Tourist,, his Red Rag could not therefore but net inefficiently. For the first two days of my entry in Berlin, I was very passively and slyly shaken, not a mot mauvais on my face either at the Hotel or in the street or at the restaurant. Finding me soft or mou, my White Giant let his chien.. bark at me on the 3rd or 4th day more frequently at my own hotel restaurant and at any of the shops or cafes I would visit. I was on my guard and every moment I expected the White Giant to open fire on me. What led him to open the campaign (for he had already de- clared war in his own timid child-like way ere this, from the Italian ports and also from Wiesbaden) was the arrival on the 15th of August of the remittance of \u00a330 from London for me by wire through the Deutsch Bank. The telegraphic remittance from Bombay of a 1,000 frs., added to which was my honorarium of 277frs. (Rs. 150) from the Rubattino Company, were all no doubt brought to his knowledge. Gifted by nature -with a purely commercial instinct like the Indian Marwari (banking class and pawn-brokers), he the White Giant evidently kept his eyes on the amount of metallic force at the disposal of the Tourist. It was from tlie amount of gold available that he calculated the Tourist's programme and duration of tour in Europe. I know how my own \"Priest\" wanted to push me back to India by his boat of September 1st. Failing to sail by which I was to go bv September 20th ; if not, I was denied a passage till Novem- ber 1st, as not a single berth, I was told, was available for meby the boat of October 10th. Even by the boat of September 20th I was booked with great unwillingness. It was only on my pretending to study Pasteur's method at the Pasteur Institute, Paris, that I wanted to prolong my stay in Europe, I was allowed to book my return passage by the boat of September 20th. I believe he the Giant was startled to see his \" menial,\" his \"servant out of pocket and living on drippings from India\" get this dripping again from London. What could it be for ? What has the Black Bug to do in"], [223, "205 Europe all the while from August 2nd to Sept. 20th? \u2014 He soon learnt. Tourist's intention of proceeding to Russia, and how it ivas received by the Berliners. \u2014 I had frankly declared I believe my intention of visiting Russia to some few I met with and had even began to make inquiries, as to the quickest and cheap est route to and from Petersburg. I remember how everybody in Berlin made a long face, when I asked them for information about proceeding to Russia. Had even bought the German Bradshaw (Reichs-Kursbuch, price 2 marks) recommended to me by a Banker of Konigstrasse and kept searching it for land and water route via Stettin to the capital of Russia. Even my hotel -keeper would pretend not to understand it. One Berliner at the hotel retaurant, who used to be somew,hat familiar with me on account of his speaking English and French, also told me he would inquire and let me know the cost of the Stettin route for Petersburg and the time it takes. He never gave me the information sought, and after waiting for a couple of days I told him that I stood little in need of it, as I had found every information I wanted from the French Continental Railway Guide, Livret-Chaix, price 2 frs. Even at the Bourse cafe, where I used to dine in the afternoon, I could get no information as to the time of the St. Petersburg Express and its actual cost, in marks and roubles, from some men who talked with me English and to whom I made a refer ence, handing them the German Bradshaw I had bought. The Banker at Koningstrasse had even shown a like unwillingness to explain to me the German Railway Guide bought at his own recommendation. At some cafes and theatres, ladies and children would prendre garde, as if I was a dangerous lunatic to be associated with. In a tram-car one day a bold fat lady openly called me names, pretending all the while to be talking with a fellow -passenger. If I enter a shop to make pm-chases, such as hat or gloves or shirts or collars, in some 2 or 3 minutes any man or passenger would enter and whisper something or"], [224, "206 tell in his own language to the proprietor or to the shop grisettes, and directly these would laugh and give me a scornful look- At times, they would mount up the price of the gloves or anything offered for sale. In short the game of chase was begun openly from loth August. Till that date (on the 12th, 13th, and 14th) I was too busy sight-seeing, and had barely leisure enough to be seen in the public thoroughfares or cafes or shops. At my own hotel at the time of my morn- ing cafe complet (coffee, milk, bread and butter) passengers would talk among themselves and point to their heads, as if some- thing was wrong there. My own hotel servants would, directly they sighted me, wear a smiling jeer and amuse themselves, at the sight of the fool moving among them, who wanted to go to Russia, and who having imbibed the republican spirit of the Parisians, they fancied wanted to establish a republican form of government in India. I had more than once slyly seen the policeman carry his hand to his head and make signs by rotating his finger by the side of his temple, which the person talking with me would interpret to mean that the man is a lunatic and not worth talking to. In tram-cars or train, people who had never before seen me, never witnessed in me any sign of insane action, would try to annoy and to persecute me in their usually accepted style of heating one's brain up to a pitch of insanity. In short, to boycott me as much as pos sible anywhere and everywhere, so that I may quit Europe and walk back to my Indian home straight on from Berlin, with out seeing much of Europe, without going to Russia or to Paris. Why ? Simply because my White Babies wished it so. The Berliners infected by the delusion Anglais. \u2014 In theatres and concerts everybody's eyes were on me, some watching my ex pression of face, some surveying my eyes, and some my ears. I am sure, my deluded White Giant's tactics were to put me first in bad odour with the Berliners, assuring them that this man is brought up in Paris. All his leaning is towards the French. He is to go and live in Paris with his \"sweet\""], [225, "207 friends for some weeks \u2014 in short, he is a Philo- Francais or another Francais, although he comes from his Asiatic granary. To lend an aid of veracity to this sort of prejudice against me instilled into the minds of the Berliner by our White Giant, there was my French shirt, French neck-tie, and a taste or leaning for French cafe and French cuisine and French wine ; and not for the beer of Miinchen or Berlin, or the Still Hock of the Rhein, or the German compot and saucisson. Some were heard to say to each other in my presence, that I had strongly imbibed the Republican spirit of the French and wished that my White Giant's Asiatic granary be governed on the Parisian principles of Liberte, Egalite et Fraternise, for all the different races of its inhabitants. All this was enough to excite hatred of this great continental nation against me. The nation was just then under a great obligation to the White Giant, for the gift of a very valuable island in the North Sea, and would no doubt do anything to oblige him in return. \" Kill the game, or chase him out of your cities, and by all means don't let him go to the country of my great rival and hereditary enemy in Asia, of whose aggressive progress I am so much afraid (perhaps how much out of delusion very few know), that I am obliged every year to spend millions on millions to guard the frontier of my Asiatic granary,\"\u2014 so said the White Giant to all his continental babies and to his petit fils, the soldat of Europe Centrale. But this young man did not at all share in the delusion Anglais and told the Black Bug openly that even if you are a Fenian as the English take you to be, \" What can you do? You can't do anything\" (Vide Poli-comedie song No. 11. p. 14, 1st Fase). What he did at the White Giants' request was simply to give the Tourist a pull, a strong pull back, so as to try and prevent his going to Russia. In the teeth of this sort of opposition and boycotting, I did go to Russia ! It was on the evening of the 19th of August that I left Berlin by an Express for St. Petersbourg. There was still something more to see and to search in Berlin. There was the 14"], [226, "208 Sehloss of Potsdam and the Park of Sans Souci in its neigh b/ourhood not yet seen. There was the Opera House and various places of art such as the picture galleries and museums. There were many scientific attractions in Berlin, such as Professor Koch's laboratories, Physiological aud other Institutes, the Berlin Gymnasium, several interesting cliniques on diseases of the eye, throat, and skin. All such I had to discard and to give up, so disgusted was I with what I looked upon either as a moral disease, arising from somo delusion, or as a sort of manifestation of moral cowardice on tho part of apcople, whose leaders and representative men have, ever since the last 20 years, inspired in me notions of admiration aud respect by their memorable heroic deeds. I could not account how such a highly civilized nation of heroes could forget their own position und self-respect and betray themselves as moral cowards to me, au Indian from the country of the vegetarian Hindoos. Speaking about the Hindoos, I cannot avoid telling our modern heroes what their own countryman, Dr. Wernichs, has said in his Zeitschrift fur Biologie, volume XV., S.197. \" It has often been remarked that England could never govern Hindostan were it not that the Brahmins have taught the Hindoos to live upon vegetable food and have thus destroyed their vigour of body aud mind. \" The only way I could account for their insensate and cruel treatment of me was by believing thai, they, the Berliners, were infected by the delusion Anglais. As instances of their foolish behaviour with me, I could mention here a couple of in cidents. One morning, on my asking the ticket clerk at the Friedrichstrasse Station for a return ticket to Potsdam, (Zwcite Klasse, I distinctly said), she gave me two tickets instoa,d of one and handed me the balance of change out of the 10 mark gold piece I gave her. I could not understand how she came to give me two tickets. But fancying that there may be one for alter and another for retour I took the tickets handed to mo and left for the platform ; there I read in clear daylight each of the two tickets, and found both of them bearing the same description,"], [227, "209 whereupon I went down again to the, ticket clerk and demanded of her the reason for giving me two similar return tickets and wanted her to retake one of them and to return its value. Quietly she takes the ticket and returns me its price. It is easy to understand the meaning of such exactions upon an un pleasant man and a solitary traveller. At times at a bier -halle I would hand one mark, (which is divided into 10 pieces of lOpfg. or say Id. each) for a glass of beer; and the Kellner (German name for garcon or waiter) would return me 2 pence or 3 pence and appropriate the rest, i.e. 7 pence for a glass of beer for which other people don't pay more than 3d. or 30 pfgs. Should I draw his attention and make any demand, the garcon would sound the words \"yaya\" and quickly walk off from me. A banker and money changer at No. 49, Konigstrasse, with. whom I generally used to deal, not content with paying me about 3 or 4 roubles (Russian money, 100 marks = 40 roubles) less than what I was entitled to in exchange for my German marks, passed off some | rouble silver pieces for \u00a7 rouble each. Even such species of exactions from a traveller not conversant with the language of Central Europe I should withstand. The annoyance of their calling me names, who was a perfect stranger to them, wherever and at whatsoever time I happen to sight them, I would suffer. But the limit of endurance was overreached one night (Saturday, 16th August) when on my return from a theatre I was about to mount the top of a tram car, and some of the passengers on the platform down below began to pull me by my leg, saying \" Monsieur, pas de place.\" I could scarcely mount a couple of steps again and I had to encounter a pull by one of my legs, saying, \" Monsieur, pas de place, pas de place. \" I was all along observing that there were 3 or 4 places on the top. I, therefore, persevered and at last succeeded in gaining my seat. That very night I com plained to my Hotel-keeper and expressed to him my fears, how I dreaded a fall, and its necessary consequences, viz. a fracture of my collar bone or ribs or of my leg, had my footsteps"], [228, "210 but slipped while ascending. Ever since thai evening on roy return from a theatre or concert at nights, I used to avoid tho tram-car and always preferred returning home by hired ca I I resolved that very night to quit Berlin. For had I still pro longed my stay therein, I was afraid the childish and insensate treatment of me by some of the deluded Berliners, would assume more a dangerous shape. Departure for Russia. \u2014 I left by the 10 o'clock night express for St. Petersburg vid Konigsberg and Eydtkuhneu route. A number of Railway conductors and officials on the platform (Alexanderplatz station) were running me down quietly and indirectly as it were, expressing their displeasure at my going to Russia. I was even told by a Berliner in my Tavern hotel (for this Hotel without a Table d'hote was to my mind nothing more than a maison meublce with a Refreshment Bar and a small Restaurant a la carte added to it) that it was waste of money and time to be going all the way to Petersburg ; there was nothing there to see. I knew how to interpret this man's gratuitous recommendation. He little knew that he was talk ing to an Indian very fond of travelling, and whose countrymen and friends had travelled in Russia before. It was one of these who had entered Russia from Persia via Batoum and Volga, who had highly recommended me to make a Russian tour. The said Berliner little knew, that he was addressing his opinion to a person who had read or rather greedily devoured every line of Mackenzie Wallace's Book on Russia, and whose description of Moscow and of the great Russian fair in its neighbourhood, of Nijni Novgorod, was too vividly impressed to be effaced in a few years. Konigsberg arrived at breakfast time. Up to Konigsberg rien de nouveau to record, beyond the fact noticed by me that on all continental railways, foreign travellers, especially if they are travelling singly, are carefully watched and guarded by the authorities, and I was glad to welcome in my compartment a young Mili tary lad, without any baggage at all, who was journeying with"], [229, "211 me as far as Kdnigsberg. Here a number of passengers got into the carriage. Two of these were speaking English, two were Ger man officers in their uniform, and one a tall brown-faced robust man, seemed to be very fond of rum or some such drink, of which he carried a couple of pints, emptying them both by the time we arrived at Eydtkuhnen. I could soon see that I was the subject of their talk, but that I could not prevent, and minded my own affairs. From Eydtkuhnen the train was shunted to Wirballen, the Russian frontier station. Here all passengers got down and their boxes and baggage arranged for customs visile and examination of passports. Passport troubles and how they were faced. \u2014 I was not. at all provided with a passport, and fancied that a passport was only necessary for travelling in Russia, but not for entering its capi tal city of Petersburg. I also imagined that, just as was once the case with me, at the French frontier in 1875, I'd be allowed to proceed without a passport, being an Indian and not conver sant with the language of the country. When the Russian Customs Officer demanded a passport from me, I excused my self by assuring him that I was not provided with it, because I was obliged to leave Bombay of a sudden as Medical Officer to a passenger ship, and showed him my testimonial obtained from the Rubattino Co.'s Head. Office, Genoa (Vide p. 29, 1st Fasci cule). I further promised to procure one at Petersburg, from the British Consul there. I also assured him my object was only to see the capital city of Russia and nothing more. I had no intention to travel in the interior of Russia. I am sure he would have in his discretion made an exception in my favour and allowed me to proceed by the Russian Express to St. Petersbourg, which was to start in an hour's time. But the three or four Russian Officers who were examining and checking the passports of travel lers entering the Russian frontier, were all infected in no time by my White Giant's agents. I saw that very quickly when a couple of these began to mark me down as a sou and a drole, \u2014 of course, at the instigation and instance of the three or four"], [230, "212 abdominal type greenhorns that were with me in the train. The intercession of another passenger, I know not of what nationality \u2014 I believe he told me he was from Denmark \u2014 was also of no avail. At last, my baggage was put back in the German train returning from the Russian frontier station to the Ge** man frontier station ; and I was told to march off back to the place whence I came. II fa ut le passeport. \u2014 At the same time, he made me under stand that I can get a passport on application to the British Consul at Konigsberg, and that without a passport, he would not allow any person to enter Russia. Even the Russian sub jects themselves are subjected to this strict rule. Pie made me understand the absolute necessity of arming myself with a passport, by telling me with a characteristic firm Russian tone in French, \" II faut le passeport.\" To my great chagrin, I returned back to the frontier, cursing all the while the Russian system of checking the movements of travellers. Well, I arrived at or rather was forcibly sent back to the German frontier station of Eydtkuhnen. Here .1 saw an official of the Russian Government, who wanted to see my papers to satisfy himself as to my nationality and identity as a subject of the Gouvernement Anglais des Indes. I showed him some letters received by me, from London to my Berlin address, but these did not at all satisfy him naturally ; and then I had to hand him my ship testimonial. This bad some effect on the Russian officer. However, he too said \" II faut le passeport.\" I expressed to him my doubt of getting one from the English Consul at Konigsberg, where he directed me to go. As a subject of the Indian Government, *>'. e., of the Viceroy of India, I recollect what great difficulty! I had once in obtaining a passport from the British Embassy at Paris (Lord Lyons being in charge of the Embassy) in 1876. At that time I had to leave Bombay very hurriedly to help my brother, then dangerously sick in London. I had no time left to apply to the Local Secretariat here for a passport"], [231, "213 The British Embassy of Paris had then referred me to the India office for a passport, instead of applying there for it. For the reason perhaps that I was a subject of the Indian Government, .. e., the Viceroy of India and not a British subject or a subject of the British Government, as I was forcibly given to understand by an Englishman in London, even so very lately as a few days after my entry in that city (Vide p. 88 of 1st Fascicule). I was very much enraged at what I thought at the time to be a superfluous formality and quite an impediment to an Indian traveller, not at all acquainted with the language of the country, and who wanted to make only a short stay in the Russian city, just out of curiosity and nothing more. In an unguarded moment I even ran down the Russian Government, called it a \" barbarian \" government in the face of the Russian officer, and for which rude expression I take this opportunity of apologising for the gratuitous insult offered to the great European and Asiatic power, a mighty giant and a colossal power. I am in gratitude bound to record here my apology to the Russian frontier officer at Eydtkuhnen, in whose face I ran down the passport system 6i his govern- ment, without reflecting in the least on the utility of the system or the necessity which compels his government to enforce it. I advisedly employ the word \" gratitude.\" For in no part of my continental tour was I treated with such marked consideration as in the three cities of Russia I visited, and on the lines of Railways connecting them, viz. Wirballen to Petersbourg, Petersbourg to Moscow, and Mos- cow to Varsovie. I could easily see how our White Giant's babies had tickled the ever -suspicious nature of the Russians, and were it not for a very fortunate coincidence or accident of my falling in with a lace merchant of Petersbourg in my journey from Wirballen to the Russian capital, I knew how I should have fared in my tour in Russia. I should not call it a tour ; it was a peep at mighty Russia and its people ; nothing more than a peep. It was in memoiy of gratitude to the"], [232, "214 Russian people, that when H. I. M. the Czarowitz and _4_ brother came to Bombay last month, that I paid my respect? to their Sovereign's piinces by signing my name in their books of visitors. At Eydtkuhnen the manager of the Restaurant, who spoke French fluently, told me to wait till 4 o'clock the arrival of the Russian frontier police officer, who he said arrangera tous ce que vous faut. He at the same time opened my eyes by pointing to another passenger, awaiting for the last four or five days his passport from his country's Consul somewhere in the neighbourhood. Directly I said to myself, Bravo, Mon ami,je vous remercie beaucoup pour votre avis donne d demi-mot. Immediately I called for my baggage back to the station from the small miserable hotel I was taken to. Tho Russian Police Officer arrived at about 4 o'clock. He wanted me to show him my papers of identification, after seeing which he said he was helpless ; and he too impressed upon me the necessity of obtaining a passport without which nobody dare pass the Russian frontier. I had before this decided to go myself by 'the evening's train to Konigsberg, and directly the train was timed to arrive, I purchased my ticket for Konigsberg. To Konigsberg and back for Passport.\u2014 The Russian Schncll zug (quick train) arrived at Eydtkuhnen and I took my seat in an empty compartment marked \" nicht rauchen\" (not to smoke). Some minutes after two lady passengers entered my compartment. I found after a few minutes conversation that both ladies were Russian subjects; one of them proceeding to Konigsberg and the other to Berlin. The former a veuve, her husband she said was a medical man. The latter also the wife of a medical man, and herself belonging to the same profession. Both of these wondered how I dared to travel sans papiers, i.e., without pass port or papers of identification, and showed me their own passports and recommended me strongly not to forget to get my passport oise (endorsed or signed) by the Russian Consul, without which"], [233, "215 no purport ni valid 111 lo. ia.

When I saw the former. I was afraid that he might refer me to the India Office for u passport, as I was once referred to it by the Lord Lyons' Embassy in Paris. Indeed, my fears would have been realized had I to do with an Englishman or an Anglo-Indian. While I write these lines I cannot help but recall what a high servant of the Bombay Government (a Salsette East Indian formerly employed iu the Commissariat Office of Bombay) told me recently while on my way home from Ceylon. He was a passenger with me in the train from the Kalyan Junc tion. J le said that when he was in London ho had applied to the India Office for a passport to visit the Russian capital ; but the India Office had then declined to furnish him with one, alleging that as he is in the service ofthe Indian Govern ment, the Russians might take him for a spy from the British ! Splendid excuse, a clever makeshift to conceal my Greenhorn's own personal dislike to let any of his Indian subjects see and realize with their own eyes, what Russia means and what sort of people the Russians are. I too was prepared for some such sort of excuse to deny me a pass port. But most fortunately for me the British Vice-consul was not an Englishman, but a German. He told me with an uprightness characteristic of the nation he represented that he was simply a vice-consul in Konigsberg for guarding the commercial interests of Great Britain and had no authority to issue any passports, and that the consul, Mr. Hume. resided at Dantzic. He further said that I shoidd have been obliged to go to Dantzic but for a fortunate circumstance that the consul, Mr. Hume, had left with him one or two forms signed blank, and he would simply fill up one such form for"], [235, "\u00a317 M. . ![ dtrmaodi \u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0 ,, .-;j,..rt t,, , \u25a0 \u25a0a. . marks, mi T'.* -. 1 . \u25a0 _\u2022 \u25a0'i.,-h i,. e \u25a0 i \u2022: - - 1 a e.m. idai --i imp of ihftt \u25a0' i '\"\u25a0 ( . is-p..!! fcrrm, aud mad nil', in In.- i. gj: i '\" ' - 'la! tie p :-.,,..

When my name was called out, as the passenger entitled to enter the realms of the great Czar of all tbe Russias, I obscrud with what an air of satisfaction and pride the Russian officiaj handed to me my passport, after it was checked and properly endorsed by him. He deservedly felt that it was indeed a great compliment paid by a distant traveller to his country und to his government. I too, on my part, was overjoyed at the splendid victory I had scored, in the teeth of the silent or passive opposition of many of the infected Berliuers to my programme of a short tour in Russia. Had my White Giant been gifted with any brain becoming his high position and status \u2014 I mean, had he any tact and knowledge of the ways and means of the world, and of mankind in general - he would have now from this single iustance judged proper to leave me alone, laisscr faire, laisser aller. But the poor deluded Giant has been as I have all along been noticing, gifted by nature with the brains of a baby and as a necessary conse quence of a childish intellect, he continued his game of chase even in Russiau territory and on Russian railways. I noticed quietly how the White Giant's agents and his own babies were tickling the ever-suspicious nature of the wideawake Russians, even at the refreshment room of Wirballen. Now that I was armed with lawful authority to enter the territory of my Greenhorn's Red Rag and was actually on Russian soil, I had little to fear from his deluded persecution of me. At any rate I was sure I will not have to face the same sort of moral cowardice in a people of the nervous type, and who therefore are naturally wideawake, more thinking and not at all likely to be easily befooled by any foreigner, friend or foe. On the Russian Railway to Petersbourg. \u2014 Our express train for Petersbourg left Wirballen at 10 minutes past 12 midnig'it, and in the compartment I was in there were about half u dozen passengers, talking not only the language of the country"], [237, "219 (Russian) but German and French also. There were a couple of rich young Jews, who used to take pleasure in coming tome every now and then and tapping my chest and my pockets with their fingers. They were evidently informed from the Wirballen Railway Restaurant, that I was a crazy Indian, qui voyage toujours, qui liaie les Anglais; and as it were to wreak his spite against them, goes, perhaps like another Dhuleep Singh, to seek the protection of Russia. Could it not be to excite them to invade India and to conquer it? The Poli comedie song No. 6, \" What is to become of India should the Russians go there ?\" a query to the Tourist by an American lady in Paris, points to some such delusion. Such are all crazy ideas, no doubt. But I would here anticipate the reader's surprise, by telling him that I was actually compared to the Dhuleep Singh of the Panjab, the political pensioner of the British Government, in the capital of Russia, by an English man seated opposite to me in the Salon de Lecture of Hotel France, ( Vide Poli-comedie song No. 2, p. 12). I knew that nothing short of actual delusion, political delusion, on the part of my Giant Baby could magnify me thus. When this song was sung by my Poli-comedien Anglais in the capital of Russia, I was reading the article in the London Times of August 20th or 22nd on Dhuleep Singh, who I was sorry to read had been then afflicted with paralysis. Rencontre heureuse. \u2014 Well, in the train I quietly bore the pushes and fingering of the mischievous Jewish lads. I knew it was not through malice, but out of fun. For I had heard other passengers tell them (in French) that although he (i. e. I) seems quiet and meek, let his impulse of insanity arise in him and you shall see how you will have to run for your life. Early next morning, the conductor came to check tickets and to inform the passengers that tea and dejeuner was obtainable from the next station, which was furnished with a buffet. I could hardly understand the Russian, and another passenger seated opposite to me volunteered to interpret"], [238, "220 in French as well as iu English what the conductor was saying. This passenger was seated opposite to me, and I had seen him quietly watching me during the early part of our journey from Wirballen. His intelligent face, his oblig ing disposition, polite manners and a serious look had so favourably impressed me that I gradually began to approach closer and closer to him. Whin at tea in a buffet, I had heard him telling another gentleman that \" il ne connais pas comment on eherchera sa baggage,\" and profiting by this hint, 1 opened my portmanteau in the carriage and pretending to feel cold, I drew out from underneath it, my warm pantaloons and wont to the Toilette Room to put them on, leaving my box open for him to see and to satisfy himself that I was not a Nihilist from India, iu league perhaps with this class of pests of Europe, carrying Nitro- glycerine or some such explosive bomb iu my baggage to kill or to frighten his Czar. I showed him my passport and while showing it in my own way quietly hinted the reasons of the unpleasant situation I was in, in my tour in Europe. Hardly had I talked with him for a quarter of an hour, and a man of his penetrating mind at once saw below the surface, and felt there must have been some rub between the Black Bug and the White Giant of White- Hall Ca3tle. I quickly saw the effect of this impression I had made on his mind. For at about \\ past 10 o'clock at a junction station, after most of the passengers from Wirballen had gone out and new ones came in, one of them, a lady, began to tell her children not to sit near me, \u2014 telling them \"ce monsieur est sol. \" At the very time she was thus dissuading her children from taking their seat by my side, the garcon or waiter had brought for me a cup of Russian soup, which my co -traveller was good enough to send to me. He did not like to wake me up to go to the Restaurant with him as I was fast asleep just before the train arrived at the junction station. I heard this garcon at once checking the new-comer, lady passenger; and said in French, \" II n'est pas sol ; il est homme sirieux, seulemcnt il est"], [239, "221 fatigue et malade pcut-etre.\" From that very moment I observed her guarding silence, and .she let her children move freely round about me in the carriage. My fellow passenger from Wirballen to Petersbourg had by this time clearly seen through the gamo of chase or boy cotting of a poor Indian, who had unconsciously worked himself into a situation of unpleasantness with John Bull \u2014 the bully, and the \"greenhorn\" of Europe. His honest heart and God-fear ing disposition at once saw the necessity of protecting a solitary traveller and a perfect stranger in his country from the wild and insensate chase of the White Babies of our White Giant. Boycotting of the Tourist given tip in Russia. \u2014 Seeing the Black Bug taken under the protection of a gentleman and a merchant well known among all his countrymen, the Germans, as well as the Russians, my White Babies gave up the chase in Russia. The name of this fellow-passenger is Plugo Fischer. Lace Merchant, St. Petersbourg. Whatever comfort I enjoyed in my short, very short tour in Russia, I must attribute in the first place to him, aud secondly tothe high moral sense of the Rus sians in general, \u2014 a staunchly religious nation of Europe. The Russians for years have been proverbial for their deep insight into human nature. The broad extent of their Empire from the middle of Europe, to the whole of Northern and Central Asia. as far as the confines of China and Indian Afghanistan has brought them into close contact with a variety of races, and nationalities of men. The \" Nervous type\" of their constituti* >n is in itself a sufficient guarantee for any one to predict that they as a race must possess une bonne te'te fail oi tact, judgment and foresight. One has only to look at my White Baby's picture, as printed on the cover of MaxO'ReU's work, John Bull and his Island, to be impressed with the \" Abdominal type\" pf his constitution and to draw his own conclusion therefrom, as to the nature of such a physiognomic indication. He is sure to find a great contrast between him and other nations, similarly"], [240, "222 constituted as our John Bull is, and the many other European nations represented by the nervous type of human species. As I prefer referring to this subject elsewhere, I content myself with only making here a passing allusion to it and no more. The intense devotion of the Eussians, as a nation to their own religion and forms of worship has kept alive in their hearts a sensitive conscience, which can at once distinguish what is right from wrong, and which would not allow any deluded brain to do in an impulsive moment such a sinful and cowardly uet as persecuting and boycotting or pushing a solitary tourist and a foreigner to misery and to death. Herr Hugo Fischer, of 85, Goslitio'i Dvor. \u2014 Yrom the moment I was put by God under the \u00e6gis of this gentle man, I felt much relieved and eased and to a great extent forgot my sufferings in Berlin. It is for this reason that I look upon the photograph of my amiable friend Herr Hugo Fischer (to whom I have addressed the 1st part of my personal history of tour in Europe) as the most agreeable souvenir of Russia and its people, I have brought with me to India. As such I have been exhibiting it along with my Rus sian passport to all my friends and sympathising countrymen, who keep calling on me to learn from me personally the nature of the sufferings 1 endured, by the insensate and childish chase by my White Giant of Whitehall. It is with very great pleasure I recall how much this kind-hearted honest gentle man, a German by birth, but naturalized as a Russian for the last 20 years, had done to excite in me an interest in my travel in Russia. He gave me a lot of information as to tbe Russian railways, the Russian Restaurants, their Tartar waiters, and the Russian cities and scenes all along our journey to Petersbourg. He located me in a nice Hotel in the veiy heart of St. Petersbourg, where they speak French, German and English also, and it was on that account I could in no way feel gene during my stay in the capital of Russia. He used to see me every evening, at times in the morning, settle my"], [241, "223 programme of sight-seeing, accompany me to the theatres and concerts, and once or twice at a sacrifice of his own time accompanied me to the Royal Mausoleum. Had I stayed in Europe until Christmas (as it was \"my intention to do ( Vide p. 103, 122) it would have indeed given me great pleasure to revisit St. Petersbourg. The cost of passage from London to St. Petersbourg by the sea-route is only five guineas. I should have however pref erred crossing via Copenhagen, Stock holm and Christiania to Russia. Pleasures of life in Europe during winter. \u2014 The clear bracing atmosphere of St. Petersbourg, its beautiful surroundings in the neighbourhood of Peterhof and Cronstadt, the maritime port close to it, had so charmed me that I had given Mr. Fischer a promise to revisit his city in winter, \u2014 more with the object of enjoying a ride in snow on Russian droschkis. Win ter is the proper' time for picking up flesh and force in Europe, I mean in the cities of Europe. I^or generally these are emptied iu summer and all the fashion and beauty of the capital cities fly to the hills and mountains of the Swiss and Tyrolese Alps, or to the watering-places and springs of Central Europe, or to the bathing sea-port towns on the coast. Every sort of festivity, such as Balls and Dances, Operas, Skating and other sports, and Election meetings, Popular Lectures and Conferences, &c. \u2014 all these have their season in the winter months in the capitals of Europe. If an Indian is really desirous of obtaining an insight of Life in Europe, to see with his own eyes what \"Euro pean Life \" and \" European society \" means, he must make up his mind to prolong his stay in Europe. 7b many of my coun trymen Europe means London. For that is the only city or place whfef-e they keep hanging about ; and my Emperor of the Hindoos too, does not wish that any Hindoo from his \" India \" should see any other part or city of Europe beyond his own sea-girt island and its giant city London. To those who are settled in London and are trading there, or those who are obliged to live in London or Edinburgh for the purpose of 15"], [242, "224 study I refer not. I refer to the many who go to Europe with the object of seeing it, and who start a tour in Europe and By out of its cities without even getting a peep at the life to be seen in each of the capital cities of Europe, such as Paris, Frankfort, Berlin, Petersburg and Vienna. The reason of this is very plain. It is simply ignorance of the languages spoken in these cities. If my countrymen, and I refer especi ally to the class so fond of travelling in Europe \u2014 the Parsees of Bombay \u2014 were to take earnestly to the study of les langues rirants and try to pick up at least a colloquial knowledge of some of the principal languages spoken on the Continent, the German and the French, \u2014 before they start individually on a tour in Europe, I am sure they will find much therein to interest them from a commercial, industrial, educational and social point of view. More on this matter I intend publishing in a small hand-book for the guidance of my countrymen, the Indian tourists, styled \"What to see in Europe and how to see it.\" Comforts of travelling on Russian Railways. \u2014 The Russian train is in itself a sight to an Indian tourist. In the first place, all Russian railways are on the broad gauge, uniform all throughout the Russian Empire, and one can travel from Petersbourg or Moscow to Merv and Samarkand in one carriage without the necessity of changing. It is this broad gauge (broader than that of all European rails) which keeps the Russian railway system isolated from the whole of the European continent, and no schlaf-wagen or any other saloon carriage from the Austrian or German frontier can be shunted on to the Russian rail. Change of carriages for the passengers or goods traffic is absolutely necessary. The advantages of a good wide broad gauge are so great, in providing ample accom modation in the waggons, so very necessary for the comfort and safety of passengers, that Germany too is shortly going to alter its present gauge of Railway lines and make it uniform with that of Russia. I found the Russian waggons far"], [243, "225 superior to any I have seen in Europe. Having travelled in this my tour in addition to the Russian railways ou the Italian, Swiss, German, French and English railways, I believe I can easily make a comparison and contrast between the several railway systems from my own point of view as a tourist from India. The Russians do not seem to have spent large capital on tho erection of showy structures in the shape of large glass roofs and domes and showy facades, to be seen at the terminal station on the lines of German, French and English railways. Instead of providing showy stations (which are occupied with traffic for scarcely one-third the time of the whole 24 hours) the Russians have, as becomes a practical nation, spent large sums in providing to the travelling public comfortable and commo dious waggons. Each waggon has its entrance and exit from its buffer sides, and there is a corridor 3 feet broad, left for the guard or conductor to move about and also to keep watch at night for the safety of tho passengers. All classes of carria- ges, first, second, as well as third, are provided with toilette rooms and abrits or water closets, with a good supply of water in them. The seats too are spacious, broad and neatly cushioned with leather or velvet, and every carriage, even the third, has its danger-signal connection, in case of death or sudden sickness of a traveller. All are Iii with gas burners, in some the gas is carried in a highly compressed state in strono- metallic cylinders or boxes suspended from the bottom of the car. The waggons too are well protected from draughts by double doors and windows and in some there is the arran cement of opening out a movable table, to hold tea or soup cups or to lunch or to write while travelling. The most enjoyable thing in a Russian Railway Restaurant is the delicious Russian tea served from a Russian summaver, and with a slice of lemon in it. 15 kopecks, or about 4d. is nothino- for a cup of such highly flavoured and delicious tea the like of which I do not remember having tasted in any eountry out of Russia- not even in the Punjab, *'. .., the Kangra"], [244, "226 Valley nor in Darjeeling nor in Kashmir\u2014 places on the I linm lavau slopes I have visited. In short, all the while I was travelling on the. Russian Railways, upon which 1 had to past four whole nights and as many days, I felt as if I was living in a moving hotel ; when alone or with only one passenger shut up in my compartment, I fancied I was in my own chambre of a hotel or in a ship's cabin. Even in tho locomotive engines of Russian railways I found something to admire and to gaze at, constructed so very differently as they seemed to me. For the fuel they consume is chiefly wood, and petroleum on the lines of Asiatic Russia. Just as on the lines of the Nizam's Railway, in the province of Hydrabad Doocan, I found hero everywhere on the liue from Wirballen to Petersbourg large stocks of the wood of pine and other trees, cut and ready far use on the locomotives. After the passenger train and the locomotives, the next thing to attract attention is the provision of well furnished restaurants and buffets on the line. Tho Refreshment-room stalls and tables are always replete with wines of all countries and qualities, with patisserie equal if not surpassing to what one finds in the best patissorie shops of Paris or Lyons. Well-dressed, attentive, and honest Tartar waiters who have only to receive an order and sharply and in a-r instant it is oarried out. The taste with which some of these Refreshment Rooms are furnished showed me, that after all I was not moving in the country of an \" uncivilized \" and a \u25a0' barbarian\" form of government. Saint- Petersbourg. \u2014 St. Petersbourg arrived at 8-10 r. M. (Friday, 22nd August) and I was directed by my God-sent friend Hugo Fischer to go to Hotel do France, Grande Morskoi, 6 to whose canvasser or commissionaire Mr. Fischer gave verbal instructions to locate me in a comfortable room. I and another passenger got in the Hotel Bus and drove to the Hotel, which was nearly 2 or 23 miles from the Railway Station. Mr. Fischer had promised to see me on the evening of the day following, and so I spent my morning in finding"], [245, "227 out a small handy guide book \u2022\u2022' for St. Petersbourg and going sight-seeing to some of the principal edifices mentioned to me by Mr. Fischer in the train. Before I returned to my Hotel in the afternoon, I had seen enough to impress me with the actual wealth of Russia. To get an idea of this, an Indian tourist has only to see and to admire the rubies, diamonds and sapphires which adorn the pictures of several saints and the holy father, mounted in mosaic gold. I can never forget the sight of l'Eglise de Kasan, Perspective Nevski, built by the Emperor Paul I. on the model of the church of Saint-Pierre in Rome. Its niches are adorned with statues of Vladimir, Alexandre Nevski, of Saint-Jean and Saint-Andre. In it are also to be seen hanging many of the trophies acquired by Russia in its wars with European and Asiatic countries. The most beautiful Church of Isaac (l'Eglise Isaac) is sumptuously adorned with columns of malachite, some incrusted with lapis lazuli, columns of polished granite and white marble. It is stated in guide-books to have cost 25 millions of roubles (Rs. 40 millions) and to contain in its interior alone 5 lacs oi ponds (1 poud -= 40 lbs.) of marble alone. Royal Mausoleum, visited on the 24th Aug. in company with Mr. Fischer. Saw there the tombs of the Russian Emperors, and among the wreaths placed on the tombs was one sent by the Shah of Persia to adorn the tomb of the late Emperor. After doing the several interesting public edifices and monuments, such as the monument of Peter the Great, the column of Alexander, of Nicholas IL, Empress Katherine II. and the triumphal arches of Narva and Moscow I employed my time in visiting the principal roads, parks and gardens of the city, every morning from 10 to 2 or 3. My afternoons after 4, I employed in riding on the top of the tram cars and going about seeing the principal public edifices and * Saint-Petersbo urg et ses environs. Guide pratique.

Unfortunately for me, several public edifices such as the Hermitage, the Royal Winter Palaces, several Museums, Picture Galleries, &c, were closed ;.for some of them a pass was necessary, to be obtained from the Minister of the Public Works. To n iv great regret I had to leave these nn visited, consoling myself at the time, that I'll be doing those in rny next tour or visit to the Russian capital, which I desire much to sec and where I still long to enjoy life during tho winter when, it is at its best. \" We hare another Dhuleep Singh among us.\" \u2014 It was in the capital of Russia that a really great compliment was paid to me by an Englishman, and tho like of which I never had the good fortune of receiving anywhere in Europe. I was one evening (August 25th) in the Salon de Lecture of Hotel do France, waiting there for the promised call of Mr. Fischer. I was then reading in the London Times of August 20th or 22nd (I know not the exact date) an article on Dhuleep Singh of Punjab, whose name has been so often before the Indian public, very lately in connexion with the matter of his claims on the English Government for his \"Kohinoor\" Diamond and the accumulated revenues of his ancestral estates in the Punjab. Tired of hammering his claims in tbe ears of our John Bull, in his own sea-girt island, the poor man was coming to India, had even renounced Christianity, and wanted to embrace or did embrace the religion and custom of his forefathers \u2014 the Hindu Sikhs. Directly he arrived at the gate of India (Aden) he was sent back to Europe, under a threat, I suppose of subjecting him to durance vile, should he persist in his intention of coming to India. This very Dhuleep Singh \u2014 the last unfortu nate descendant of the reigning Sikh dynasty of Punjab, was"], [247, "229 struck down with paralysis, and a long leader in my White Baby's official organ, the English Times announced the fact to the world with a flourish of trumpets and exultation. I have often marked this as a trait in our John Bull, to exult himself at the fall of his enemies or unpleasant rivals and custo mers, even after crushing them or after they are dead and gone. This trait, so very peculiar to him, betrays his strong vindictive nature. Well, I as an Indian, was really sorry to read in the English Times, that the Prince of Punjab was struck down with paralysis ; and as it were to solace me or rather to hint me in his own way, that a countryman of my White Baby of White Hall, seated opposite to me with a couple of ladies by his side, tells them and lets me understand \"We have another Dhuleep Singh among us.\" I knew from the moment I set my foot on the continent of Europe I was a regular Red Rag to our John Bull, and I thought it was simply the outburst of irritation my presence had caused in the mind of this passenger Anglais, that he sang this Poli-comedie song. Could it be that he fancied that like Dhuleep Singh I had come to Russia to ventilate my grievances, and I have quite a number of them, standing unredressed ever since 1873. Or perhaps as remarked by a passenger in the train from Koln to Paris, it may be that I went to Russia to tell the .Russians with what sort of arms and army my John Bull has conquered the country of the Hindoos, and how after levelling everybody to the dust, he himself has begun now to pose as their Emperor. Or cotdd it be that my White Giant of White Hall fancied in his delusion, when one of his babies here in the capital of Russia ma o-nified me into \"another Dhuleep Singh,\" that I went to Russia to hand the \" key\" of his Asiatic granary to the Czar? If so, I am sure all the English journals of India, as well as the Indian bureaucrats who star in the heights of Simla, at Peterhof and other such places are all wrong in looking upon Herat and the Indian Afghanistan round about it as the key <jf India. Even Lord Salisbury once a Minister for India was"], [248, "230 wrong in allegiugthat the \"key of India\" lies somewhere in our White Giant's Indian pocket in London. I suppose the English passenger of Hotel de France, Petersbourg, who pointed me out to his lady friend as \" another Dhuleep Singh,\" fancied that the \"key of India\" is lying concealed somewhere in my pocket and that I went to Russia with the expressed intention of handing it to the Czar. Appendix No. 11, pp. 122. What I call delusion Anglais, could not take a worse form. This Delusion Anglais would have even showed itself in the capital of Russia in some other equally bad form, had the Anglais passenger been surrounded at the time by a few sharp and astute persons, a3 he generally is when he is iu the theatrical maison of his neighbour, or if he had the encouraging help from some speci mens of his own abdominal type belonging to ether nationalities as he had in Berlin. The Russians could not be infected by tlie Delusion Anglais. \u2014 The Russian loup, always suspicious as becomes a loup, was more than a match for our deluded White Giant. He would not allow himself to be befooled, like his neighbour to the eastward of the Rhine, and so all throughout Russia, I mean its three principal cities \u2014 St. Petersbourg, Moscow and Varsovie, and on the Railways connecting these cities with the German frontier I was not at all molested, not even bythe unlearned and rough classes such as waiters and cab-drivers and railway porters ; nor by the respectable classes moving in hotels, cafes and theatres. I can recall however only one \"chauffage \" at Cafe Leiner in Petersbourg (August 20th), it was not from a Russian, but from one whom I took to be an Allemand ora person of some other nationality and of an \"abdominal type \" like him. I had in my letter to Mr. Fischer from Moscow alluded to the coward attack of this chauffeur, with a view that he may be found out and castigated as he deserved to be, for the moral cowardice displayed by him in attacking a solitary and unprotected traveller without any real justi fication, but simply at the instigation of my White Giant's"], [249, "231 babies scattered in the cities of Europe for winning their daily bread. Peterhof. \u2014 Among the environs of Petersbourg the most pretty and interesting are Peterhof and Kronstadt. To the former I went on the morning of the 25th August (Monday), departure by the Baltic station at 12-45, arrival 1-30. The Palace of the Emperor resembled in many respects the Schloss of Berlin. Some rooms were decorated with mirrors all round on the walls and ceilings too, such as one sees in an Oriental Prince's Palace or Hall of Reception. The arrangement of the garden and its fountains reminded me of the fountain terraces of the Nishat Bag and the Schalimar gardens of Kashmir, where the Mogul Emperors of India, Akbar and Aurangzebe, used to spend their summer. Such sights made me feel that I was in a city where Europe and Asia were as it were shaking hands. From what little I saw of Russia, its position between the two continents justifies me in entertaining this sort of im pression ; and I was not surprised to find here men and manners of one continent gradually merging as it were into those of the other. To Moscow. \u2014 From Petersbourg my original programme was to go to London direct by the sea-route or via Stetten or Hamburg, across the Continent to Paris. This itineraire I altered after consultation and advice from my friend Mr. Fischer. I say friend, for at this time our acquaintance had quickly ripened into friendship, and I am glad to assure the reader that the confidence I reposed in him has been returned ; for, I have always received from him replies to my letters both in Paris and London. Mr. Fischer was good enough to spend with me nearly half hour to frame my itineraire of tour in Russia vid Moscow and Varsovie, and to calculate the comparative cost and time by this route, as well as by the other routes I have indicated above. Finding a very small amount of saving was possible, by taking the longer sea route or sea and land route combined, I naturally preferred journeying to Moscow \u2014 a"], [250, "\u25a0S 12 city described very graphically by Mackenzie Wallace in his work on Russia. I quitted St. Petersbourg by the Moscow Express at 3 o'clock p. m. on August 26th from the Moscow station. Here, some 15 minutes before my departure, Mr. Fischer came to see me off, and after putting me in my carriage he handed me his own photo, on the back of which is inscribed iu his own handwriting, \" A mon aimable Docteur Viicajee, en iin'miiire piuir quelques jours passes avec lui en Russie. Hugo Fischer.\" The train was chock-full of passengers and with difficulty I could get a place for myself, and my small hand bags. How to smoke a person in tlie train. \u2014 It was in this train from Petersbourg to Moscow, that frequently a tall sun -burnt man, with a pointed nose, small face, and a small withered beard, would keep showing his face to me. At times sitting opposite to me, at times going out of the carriage into another ; at times meeting me on the platform or passing by me in a Buffet. I had only once seen this very man in my carrriage, while returning one morning from Peterhof to Petersbourg. He did not show his face any more, until I saw him in this train. He kept out of sight for some two or three intermediate stations. Before the train arrived at Moscow, he had left my compartment and shifted into some other carriage. When I was about to get down from my carriage at Moscow, I observed him come close to my carriage door and while I got out he was throwing smoke on me, holding his lighted cigar in hand. Was this a sign to the Hotel canvassers who had massed a few yards further on \" to smoke this traveller\" (chauffer le) ? I should think it was. For I had heard one of the hotel canvassers was actually chaffing at my hotel guide at the kind of customer he had succeeded in fetching to his hotel. Who this man was and by whom he was so employed, I never cared to know. Moscow. \u2014 Moscow is the Benares of Russia, so full it is of churches. At the same time it is the great manufacturing"], [251, "233 and industrial centre of Russia. If any of my countrymen should cross from Berlin to St. Petersbourg, 32 hours run, cost 109 marks by Express, I would strongly recommend them not to leave Russia without seeiug Moscow. It is the only capital of Russia wdiere the tourist has a chance of seeing the various races and types of men, who own allegiance to the Czar. Men from all Asiatic countries up tothe confines of China, \u2014 Tartars, Mongols, Caucasians, Khirghiz, Cossacks, and Chinese, are all to be seen here. In addition to these there are various types of men from European Russia, and also a lot of foreigners settled in the cities of Russia for trade or employment. In Petersburg alone there are 65,000 Germans, 35,000 French, and 25,000 English. There is a daily paper called the Petersburg Zeitung for the Germans, and the Journal de St. Petersbourg for the French. The English residents have not the energy to get up a paper for themselves, as my \" Time-is-money \" man has hardly time left to edit and to publish a paper in his own language, or perhaps, for reasons of economy, he prefers reading in that city the papers of the Germans and the French, or likes rather to have the papers of his own country than any published there. To make up for this want, he is to be seen occasionally advertising in his own language in the Journal de St. Petersbourg, such adver- tisements as departure of a vessel for London, or some port in England, or an auction sale of some Englishman's goods in the capital of Russia. On the first day I was in Moscow, it was a relio-ious holiday, and all business establishments were closed. The day following too was observed partially as a holiday. I had to change some of my gold marks into Russian roubles ; after some inquhy I was directed to a German Banking Establishment. Here there were some signs of passive indications of chauffage, but not worth noticing. The^ hotel I was in was the one recommended to me by Mr. Fischer, and I found its proprietor very attentive and very kind to me, and ready to carry out my wishes or wants whenever expressed."], [252, "234 Voild le chien. \u2014 I met on the day I was to leave Moscow a young lad speaking English, who had travelled with me in the Berlin Express as far as Wirballen and from whom 1 had to separate for want of a passport. This man said he had put up in the same hotel (Hotel de France) at St. Petersburg and also at Moscow too he was in the same hotel (Hotel Billo) with me; further he told me that he was rather sorry to find me leaving Moscow so soon ; \u2014 voila le chien. The persons who arc paid for keeping up political or any other sort of \" espionage \" of a suspected person, employed no matter by whom \u2014 Government or private individuals, invariably lodge in the same hotel with him and also travel with him by the same train. Russian hospitality. \u2014 From Moscow to Warsaw, nothing unusual beyond getting as my fellow traveller a Russian Railway engineer going on leave to Charlottenberg. Pic was past the middle age, had re-married and was a grand father, lie spoke French with great accuracy, and much better accentuation than he did English. He gave me a lot of information about Russian Railways, the Caucasian Russia, the Khirghiz ; on the dangers of travelling alone in Railways on the continent as well as in England. He often used to hand me fruit \u2014 oranges and peaches \u2014 a basketful of which his daughter had made a present to him on his starting from Moscow. I was astonished at the knowledge of some Indian matters he displayed. He asked me about Brahmins and the political agitators, and also wanted to probe my opinion as to the way the English rule of India is received by the educated classes. This I declined to do; for this reason, that the English ever since I set my foot on the European continent look upon me as a \"Fenian travelling with anti-Anglais feelings.\" I showed him a large map of Russia I had bought at Berlin, \u2014 61 Charlottenstrasse. I recollect what irritation I had caused in Berlin by simply purchasing a map of Russia. The vendor of the map had the politeness to receive at first from me the price of the map of Russia, 4-50 marks, and for a general map"], [253, "235 of Europe 4-50 marks and for one of America 2-50 marks ; and at the moment of my leaving his shop called me sou, drole, behind my back. Well, on this map of Russia, the traveller traced one of the plus beau et pittoresque parts of Russia, close. to the Elburz mountain, and lying between the Caspian and the Black Sea, where the Railway from Tiflis is not yet completed. I may observe here, that an English gentleman who travelled with me from Berlin to Koln, on my way to Paris, had also mentioned to me the same portion, as the most favourite for tourists in Caucasian Russia, close to which a Russian line of Railway runs. This hospitable Russian gen tleman parted company from me at Linsk, and passed on to the Wirballen route on his way to Berlin. I went further south, bound for Varsovie or Warsaw. Warsaw. \u2014 I arrived at Warsaw at 11 o'clock forenoon, and took the bus of Hotel Victoria, to which I was recommended by Mr. Fisoher. Before mentioning Mr. Fischer's name, to the proprietor of the Hotel, directly I entered it, he demanded il I -wanted \" une grande chambre.\" I said \"non, seulement une chambre au lit\" mentioning at the time Mr. Fischer's name as the person who had recommended me to his hotel. This Hotel is also, like the Hotel Billo, owned by a German and full of Ger man boarders. Thanks to Mr. Fischer and above all to my wide awake nervous typedRussian, that here too \u2014 neither in the Hotel of Warsaw nor in the Tram cars I rode therein, nor in the public park nor cafes and bier-halles I visited, did a single person utter un mot mauvais contre moi. An English-speaking guide offered his services to me for i- rouble per hour. This I declined. For invariably my rule in the cities of Europe is to avoid the o-uide class. My experience of them is not favourable ; more over I dou't like to be led like a blind man over a city whose topography I like to study from a plan and to work my own way therein should time permit. Only once in Berlin on my way to the Sans Souci Park, being pressed for time, did I take a guide for 2 marks, to take me over the grounds, in the"], [254, "236 time at niv disposal, and nowhere else did 1 avail myself of the services of a guide. Iii Russia and Germany 1 could find my way by my knowledge of French, limitod as it is, and in Scotland I had not the least necessity to employ a guide, excepting once at Braemar, where one morning I made a walking tour of about 12 miles on the hills behind the Queen's hunting-grounds of Balmoral Estate. My original intention was not to halt at Warsaw, but to devote a day more to sight-seeing in Berlin. But I said to myself iir the train, that being received in such a good way by the Russians, I must notleave their country without paying them a compliment in the shape of a visit to their capital of Russian Poland, The sight of Warsaw, though a small city, pleased me much. The iron bridge over the Vistula, its Jewish popu lation, its military pose, and its prosperity \u2014 all these are enough to favourably impress a traveller. I employed my afternoon in Warsaw, obtaining the address of, and calling on a confrere, Dr. Martin Sokolewski, who had passed both his 3rd and 4th examinations for the Doctorat with me in Paris in 1880. Pie was at Nice, and did not return to Warsaw till after I left that city. From his house, I walked into the public park, and here seeing an opera house I reserved a ticket for myself for the evening performance. As I had still a couple of hours in hand before the theatre opened, I took a ride on the tramcar and paid a visit to the Jewish quarter. The Russian Jews. \u2014 The Russian Jews of Warsaw are soon recognisable, by their peculiar dress and appearance, from the Christian population. Their meek and cowed down appear ance was enough to impress me with the stories of their per secution. I had a's > asked the old Russian Engineer, who had travelled with me from Moscow, the reason why the Jews are so much persecuted. He gave me a lot of reasons,\u2014 the principal ami mg which was that they don't love their country ; \"On va en Jlliniagne,\" i.e. migrate to Germany and other countries and"], [255, "237 thus escape the conscription or other duties imposed upon every subject and citizen of European countries. \" C'est Indien,.... il est bete.\" A scene in the Warsaw Opera house. \u2014 I returned from the Jewish quarter in time to enter the Theatre, where I had secured a seat in the fauteuil d'Orchestre for 2 roubles. Here during an entr'acte a scene occurred, which has put most of the Poli-comedie acts and scenes in the shade. An English gentleman past middle age and evidently a man of some position, was talking with some high Russian military officers in uniform ; his face turned towards me and his back towards the stage. He was on the 3 rd or 4th row of seats to my left and I was a couple of rows just behind him to his right. Pointing me out with a bitter face this Anglais said in a perfectly audible tone, \" C'est Indien ...il est bete.'\" When he used this sort of language towards me, I could barely control my anger, and my face and eyes at once betrayed my wrath. The Russian military officers and others, some seated, some standing (during the entr'acte) facing me, and others round about me in the audience \u2014 all seemed astonished at this sort of lano-uan-e, and began to watch if I would make any attempt to resent. The insult was enough to make any person's blood boil, and to put him out of temper. With great self-command and prepossession, I could scarcely control my wrath. I knew that howsoever fortified I may be to kick this 'chien enrage,' there and then, the consequence would be not at all in my favour were I to give him tit for tat. I knew I was alone, solitary, unprotected and surrounded by men who are less likely to be guided by what I would say, and whom just a tickle from our White Giant would suffice to harm and to annoy me. Had I attempted then the least reprisal, I should have lost the sympathies \u2014 silent and concealed of the Russians in whose country I then was. I, therefore thought it prudent to control my temper, and with considerable reluctance I suffered myself to be openly insulted bv this respectable Englishman present in the Opera-house. I thought at the time, either this my White Baby was too near"], [256, "238 his semi-dementia stage or had just a glass more of Highland whisky, or it may be the Russian vodki, under the influence of which, the irritation caused by my presence must have bead heightened a great deal; or it may be this my Greet ihorn's dodge to excite the respectable aud influential class of Russians then present at the Opera-house to run me down and to make me miserable. Whatever it may be, this single incident was in i Nel I' enough to show mo a great trait in the English character, about which I prefer dwelling elsewhere. Although I was in the theatre till the last scene was enacted and the curtain dropped, I avoided the sight of the man, whom I took for the greatest moral coward going, disgracing his education, his position and even risking his own countrymen's proverbial reputation for calmness, soberness and sagacity. Some of the Russian officers seemed to be apprehensive of a row between me and him, and when they found me guarding my sang froid and calmness, I am sure they began to look down upou the conduct of this old John Bull who, finding himself nonplussed, and his Poli-comedie song not at all taken up by any of the audience, left the playhouse shortly after. To the Russian frontier again. \u2014 Sunday, August 13th. Spent my morning in going about the town, for I always like to stroll, whenever I am in a new city or among a new people. After dinner, left for the Railway Station to proceed to Berlin via Alexandrovo and Thorn route. Here directly the train arrived I was taken by the porter to a carriage, close to which was standing a guard or conductor, who beckoned the porter to put me in the compartnent of which he had just opened the door. Close to my compartment there were two first class com partments, one of which was occupied by the same old moral coward of the Varsovie Opera-house. This man got out at some 3 or 4 stations from Varsovie and with him too went a Lady who had taken her seat by my side. He had a couple of gun - with him \u2014 perhaps out shooting on a Sunday afternoon. May it not be that under such a pretext or a show, this old Anglais"], [257, "239 wanted to assure himself of my departure from the country, of what has invariably been a Red Rag to the White Giant, and which country he never likes an Indian, at least of my antecedents, to visit and to see. As the carriage proceeded on its way to the frontier station, I noticed in the compartment close to me a fat and tall Russian, whom I took for some Railway or other functionary ; for when we reached the Alexandrowo station a lot of Railway officials came to his carriage and saluted him. In the compartment next to this official's was a Russian Police officer, wearing green goggles and identified by me as such, first by his police casquet, and secondly by the obeisance he was receiving at every station from the railway police. I allude to the presence of these two Russian functionaries purposely for reasons which will appear further on. Before we arrived at Alexandrowo the conductor in charge of the train came to examine tickets and returned everybody his ticket ; but mine he kept with him and told me something in Russian which I could hardly understand. Two or three times I called for it, but it was not returned. Late in the evening, about an hour before the train arrived at the frontier station, the conductor returned me my ticket (in book form) which I had bought from Moscow, paying 53-50 roubles as my second class Express fare up to Berlin. Alter dark another conductor comes to collect the ticket for Alexandrowo, and in my ticket book he finds the coupon for Alexandrowo missing. Questions me about it half in French and half in Russian, and I could not help but tell him, I know where the coupon has gone. He tells me to search for it in the carriage, as it was possible I may have like a drole dropped it somewhere. While he tells me so, he quietly goes on with the process of \" Je vous serre la main, cordialement,\" with another Russian passenger, seated opposite to me, and in addition to the sign surreptitiously made with his hand joined to his\u2014 as if shaking hands, he speaks to him something, and the passenger understands him ; and he too in his turn tells me (in French) \" your coupon for Alexandrowo 16"], [258, "240 is wanting in your ticket book.\" Directly I observed this sort of game, I guarded silence, and did not even reply to the passenger seated opposite to me. I said to myself, to guard silence now would be giving a regular silent kick to the dodgers, who were bent upon harassing me in any way possible. Arrived at Alexandrowo I desceud, hand in my permit or authority to cross the frontier, which was attached to my passport and for which I had to pay (through my Hotel keeper) 2-40 roubles in Moscow. and 85 kopecks extra, charged again in my Varsovie Hotel Bill. Both the permit or pass to cross the frontier and the passport were being examined by the Passport bureau, where I found the Russian official close to my compartment in the train, take his seat. Some time after I observed this very official come out from the Telegraph room, about quarter hour before the train was timed to depart for Thorn \u2014 the German frontier station. When he walked past me ( I was at the time on the platform, awaiting the return of my passport endorsed with official authority to cross the frontier) I saw him greet me with a smile and a loud laugh. All along the way from Varsovie up to Alexandrowo I used to see this Russian official (I fancy of the Passport department) gazing at me with a half- suspicious and half scornful look, and this change on his countenance had its mean ing to me. Will he cross the Frontier to-night'? \u2014 Directly after the passport was handed to bis bureau, I went to the Refreshment Bar and there I heard some passengers exulting and saying to one another, that for a week more I shoidd not be able tofranehir the frontier. Evidently I fancy they expected an order from the head -quarters to detain me in Russia (unnecessarily of course), and to subject me to an amount of irritation and annoyance, that no sooner out of Russia, I would soon take to my heels and go back to India, and no more think of prolonging my stay in Europe. But to their great discomfiture, an order, I believe. was telegraphed to let the Indian cross the frontier, and not to detain him. Hence I believe the smile and hearty laugh of the"], [259, "241 Passport official, directly he was out of the telegraph room and saw me standing on the platform with an anxious look awaiting his authority to cross the frontier. Here, in this sort of game to harass an unpleasant man, I suspected the hand of my White. Giant through his agents in Russia. Or if not, it was an effect \u2022of his tickling the suspicious nature of the Russian. I may here inform the reader that at Warsaw after my morning pro menade, I had shut myself up in my room for more than 17. hours getting up my cash account: and penning some half dozen post \u2022cards to friends in India, and also in despatching a good long letter to Mr. Fischer at Petersbourg. From Moscow too, I had written him a good eaustic latter, running down an abdominal type man for his rude behaviour towards me at the Cafe Leiner on the day I quitted Petersbourg. It is possible that this my letter had produced its expected effect, and that a vindictive eye may have been kept on me for having dared to kick a Russian for his rudeness- How they read the inside of suspected persons. \u2014 It is possible that this letter, as well as all my other letters, did share the usual fate of exposure to a steam-bath, and then the tirage of a facsimile by photo, (if in Indian character), or by a type writino- machine. I believe it is possible, nay probable, from my subsequent experience of the way in which they \"read the Book\" or the inside of a suspected person in Europe. If so, it could only do me good. For in that letter, I had not put in any arsenic. On the contrary, had enclosed a paper rouble as a gift to the person who had amused us at a Concert at the Zoo Garden, and expressed my regret at my very short stay in Russia, and said it was not a tour of the kind I wished, but only a peep at Russia and its people. I recollect veiy well when I expressed to an Englishman travelling with me from Dover to London on the day I went there from Paris (Oct. 2), my suspicions as to how they \" read the Book\" in Russia, he said he was sure, that kind of game is carried on in that country. It was at that very time, that I could read in the"], [260, "242 eyes nid facial expression of my greenhorn Anglais, that his countrymen even woidd not scruple to imitate the Russians or the French, if they had any occasion to deal with a suspected person. In supportof my statement as regards the opening of letters of suspected persons, in the post offices of Europe, I would here quote from the Quarterly Review for January 1891, page 122, article ' Russia ; its people and Government.' \" It may be too much, for instance, to expect him (the Czar) to be cognizant of the tricks of bis post-office ; of the dishonourable wav in which letters, even from private English individuals, utterly above suspicion, franked to their destination and entrusted to his honour for safe delivery, are opened.\" Thank* to the Russian experience of the principal Poli-comedie director.

Here I learnt for the first time from a German money-changer, that the silver rouble pieces I wanted him to change into German marks were not of the value of _ of a rouble each, but were actually worth A rouble. Before starting for Russia, I had changed 100 marks into Russian metallic currency at a Banker's in Kbnigstrasse. 1 told him from what Banker and whence I had obtained them, and he distinctly said I was cheated by the money changer of Berlin. Whom to hang for all such tricks ? I knew not. But I must, at any rate, thank our White Baby for putting on me such trade-marks in Europe, which were in themselves sufficient passports to any dishonest person and every mendiant to practise exactions on me in various forms."], [261, "243 To Paris via Berlin and Koln route. From Thorn the train started at about 12 o'clock midnight, and in my compartment there was a young man, well dressed, with gold spectacles and a grand \" chimney-pot\" on his head. He had scarcely any baggage with him, only a small hand bag, of which too I have a doubt if it belonged to him or some other passenger. I distinctly heard this man on two or three, occa sions telling the conductors who would come to ask for tickets for cheeking them \" Ne le derangez pas ; c'est le drole, il est sou; and the frightened conductors would no more think of waking me up,but would leave me forthwith. I was all the while lyino- awake with my eyes shut and could hear distinctly what people round about me said. Who this man (seated opposite to me) was, I had no means of ascertaining. But this his conduct was a sufficient clue to me, as to the way \" the Pari- sian sou or drole trick \" is worked from railway to railway and country to country. I found the same sort of game in my journey from Koln to Paris; which I'll be describing further on. Even at Friedrichstrasse, the central station of Berlin, I found this, my young man, poisoning or prejudicing the minds of the railway servants, who came to receive tickets and to take out my baggage. Under whose orders this fellow-passenger, speaking German and French, was acting thus I cared not to know, and thought it was not possible for me to find out. However, the fact existed and the great beauty of the whole affair is that it did not escape my observation.

Tlie castle and the Royal Palace of this Windsor of Berlin was not open to the public that da}', aud so I had to content myself with a promenade and what little my guide could show me of the park and buildings of Sans Souci (the Versailles of Berlin). In the afternoon I gave a look in at the Bourse Cafe restaurant, just, to judge if the Anti- Viccaji feeling had died out. and which sort of feeling I used to rind at the time I was trying to get information from two or three men there, as to the cheapest ways of going to and from Petersbourg. I found it had certainly abated. I could read on the faces of many, who before my going to Russia would run me down loudly, signs of admiration and respect at the perseverance and resolution of the Indian, who in the teeth of their silent opposition did not only proceed to the capital of Russia, but went further inwards and travelled over a larger extent of Russian country, from Petersbourg to Varsovie vid Moscow. The Berlin Opera house had opened from the 1st of this month. Of this too I cared not, and as I had arranged at Petersbourg, I carried out my entire itinerary faithfully and punctually to each date. L'epreuve commence. \u2014 I booked in the evening from Berlin Central station (Friedrichstrasse Station) to Paris vid Koln. There was an hour or more to wait before the tickets were issued, aud so I employed my spare time in the Restaurant salle drinking cafe and cognac. While seated there, I saw after about half an hour had passed, an old woman (? Alsacienne) asking the garcon where to post her letter, which she kept showing in her hands, and all the while speaking French with a sufficiently audible voice. I had watched the same sort of trick at Varsovie where an old countryman or cultivator, had come to me, demanding where he could post a letter he carried in his hands, and wanted to know from me where the post-box was.

Until midnight he kept kaw kawing with his valet Williams ; and I kept quietly watching him all the while, if he was going to betray himself, like the gold spectacled chimney-pot lad, who travelled with me from Thorn to Berlin. I was glad to find that he had not the least idea as to who I was, where I was going to, and did not at all care to notice me. Perhaps that was the only Englishman on the continent I had met travelling in the same compartment with me, to whom I was not a Red Rag ; and I naturally approached to him, as morning broke. He indicated to me on his map, what parts of Russia he had made a tour in, and what difficulties he had to contend with in the way. The part of Russia he had travelled in between the Caspian and the Black Sea was almost the very same marked out to me by the Russian Engineer, who was with me from Moscow downwards. At Koln he and his valet Williams separated from me, as a change of carriages was effected here. Koln to Paris : La Lutte. \u2014 After my petit dejeuner, I was shown into a through carriage to Paris by a Railway servant ; and which was, by the time I went to it, occupied by the old Alsacienne of Friedrich strasse station, Berlin, and six other passengers. Of these the man seated close to me to my left was what appeared to me to be the son or brother of the old Alsacienne, to whom he was very attentive. This man too had all the appearance of a person not likely to travel by the 2nd Class. He, as well as the old Alsacienne by his side spoke French and German also. Both of them had all the gait and habits belonging to the rabble -babble class of people. Their dirty fingers and nails, their mode of talk, and their pose left no doubt on my mind as to their errand, which I may at once tell the reader was the same as that of the man who travelled with me from Thorn to Berlin ( vide p. 243) and perhaps more. During this part of my journey to Paris my White Baby had purposely selected men, whom I would take"], [265, "247 for Francais. For he knew my predilection for the Frenoh language and everything else French, and fancied that if he could but keep a French-speaking mail and woman of my age and within my reach, I may chance to form acquaintance with them, keep talking with them in French and may even guard their company in Paris during all my stay there. After all our greenhorn of a John Bull was but a greenhorn, and he little fancied that he had to deal with an Europeanised Indian Parsee, not a baby of the stamp he usually meets with in India; and who could easily see and has been all along seeing through his tactics. Both these, man and woman, had barely enough money to purchase even a bock of b-ier all the way from Koln to Paris, a journey of 8|- hours. They had both to subsist on tratines and saucisson they had brought with them. Facing me in the same compartment was a young lady passenger speaking English but reading a French livret; close to her right were two Anglais (? Anglo-Canadians) and near these an Allemand, about 28 or 30 years of age, extremely loquacious, with the pose of a military man, though he was dressed as an ordinary non -military person. This gentleman's sole function was to keep hammering constantly at my subject ; at times to browbeat me with a twirl of his moustache with his left hand. He was talking both German and French, and would at times interpose some English words, to make me understand his tall talk. This semi -abdominal type Allemand was in constant communication with the two Alsacienne chauffeurs \u2014 man and woman seated close to me. Vis-a-vis to him was another robust, tall, fat and snubnosed Allemand or Hollandais, with a massive skull and big jawbones He had the good sense like the spare-bodied fair lady seated opposite to me, to guard silence, at least not to betray himself like the two Canadians, or the old woman and her companion, or the young militaire. As the train moved on from Koln at first there was an eagerness on the part of the French-speaking man seated close to my left, to see if I would have some talk with him. Tired at last, he began to"], [266, "248 ask me in French such ordinary questions as when were we due in Paris; where we shall be stopping for breakfast, &C. I guarded silence and never opened my lips to reply to what ho said or what the old woman seated by his side said. I wa8 sufficiently prejudiced against the old woman from the Berlin station. My suspicions were fully confirmed directly I saw her in the same compartment with me, and playing her assigned role of a chauffeur and a feeler of my White Baby. My disdain to talk or to exchange a single word with her drew both of them out, and in an hour's time, after leaving Kiiln, the woman opened the attack by calling me, \" c'est le drole, n'est ce pas ; il est sou, sou; pas drole.\" I was indeed very glad she did betray herself this way, and thus the process of ' chauffeur le monsieur' commenced in the train, and was taken up by one of the Anglais or Anglo-Canadian passengers, who began with the Poli-comedie song marked No. 9 in the list of Poli-comedie songs and Hungarian Waltzes (vide p. 14). His idiotic stare and look were such, as to leave no doubt in my mind as to his weak intellect, and that he was the proper sort of person to accept the brief from my White Baby. One time the Alsacien mendiant would try to frighten me by touching my pockets ; would shift my rugs or take up my paper, without my permission, to read. Both him and the old soiled Jupon by his side, I kept at a respectful distance from me by a scornful look. Of the two Anglo-Canadians, I kept studying their physiognomic characters. The German Militaire I drew out by buying French papers and reading them. Entering my ever-beloved city of Paris, 1 had put on that morning my favourite coloured French shirt and this too he could not stand. I knew what a scarecrow this shirt was once with the Berliners, who if they hated me most, it was for my preference for everything French, and of which they were informed by the White Babies, when I was in Wiesbaden. In Frankfort too at the Opera, I was questioned by some nobodies if I was a Francais."], [267, "2 19 ' \u25a0\" '\u25a0-\u25a0 .- \u2014 ni.- -I'', ,, , J men that I h..e,- not rhc I '- \u25a0-\u25a0\u2022\u2022\u25a0'I, bill s|. ui,. of a rccuibbiiic,. t,, a l-'i.u.l - Duriul nij forma ,.\\-,, l.ao:. ,;i hailooe. licit her iu '\u2022\u25a0 -atMuIi. hoi, t Iu: o,d da B .hue . llor il> rsy, , ,',\u2022,, , f, , ,, I, UU* oi isehl, Sabboui^ .,.,,! > il u hd uiybody (al;,, me sot a I hman or i in r ,|Ui-t.i..u. ,1 me a- t,,, n ho I *\u00bb.-, And it i \u2022 if tor the render now to ; Ml j S the meaninc of fa-b oog On BK ibis 9\u00a9\u00abl ot rn-titioiis nationality.

In Paris the sagc femme class of the Quartier de 1'Ecole de Medecine could not but hate the Tourist for il etait chez Bismark, el maintenunt il est comme Allemand ou Alsaeien\" (vide Poli-comedie song No. 1 R, p. 14). Thus with three different nations, the unfortunate Indian Tourist got the fictitious stamp of three different nationalities, \u2014 all European, although he is an Asiatic by his birth and race, a true blue-blooded crow (the nickname by which my countrymen, the Parsees of Bombay, are commonly known to the other Hindoo subjects of the Viceroy of India). P'or all this good or rather exceptional piece of good luck, I must thank my deluded White Giant for magnifying me in his fit of delusion to an extent, as to receive three different nationality appellations, in three different countries, from three different nations of civilized Europe. Approaching Paris. \u2014 To return again to my journey from Koln to Paris, on September 2nd, 1890. The Militaire Alle mand was already chafed enough by my French pose due to my French collar and shirt and the French bow-knot of my neck-tie. When he saw me buying, after we entered the French frontier, French newspapers and perusing them, his irritation against me was heightened to a pitch w-hich drew him out at once, and the Alsaeien mendianl by my side would say to him, that I was brought up in Paris sil etait eleve en Paris) . He began also to pass remarks on my Russian casquet and seemed to say, that it was to cut the English that I was put ting on the Russian cap. This I had brought from Moscow and kept wearing it ever since in the train. One Ger man passenger I recollect once had remarked to me, during my return journey from Koln to Mainz, that I was donning the dress of every nationality, viz., Russian chapeau, French boots, French shirt and collar, and German veston and gilet. When he expressed himself thus, to complete the tableau, I"], [269, "251 had to draw his attention to the English socks, I had on to cover my feet. He, the Militaire Allemand, also said why I went to Germany ; to judge which nation's soldier looks more formidable and more strong, \u2014 the English soldier or the Ger man ? At this time, a Frenchman in soldier's uniform happened to pass by us on the platform of a station and this militaire Allemand passenger, scornfully directed the attention of every body in the carriage to the size and build of the soldier Fran cais, \u2014 thinking or imagining all the while that by thus kicking the Francais, his natural enemy, he was kicking me too. One time the Alsaeien man to my left would make this remark \" comment les soldats gardens le lit en Russie \" and how poor a city Moscow is when barely \"a million marks could be found if searched in all. \" All this sort of talk had a reference, I am sure, to one of my letters or post cards written from Moscow or Varsovie, to my friends in India, wherein I had said, how tra velling in Russian railways and Russia is perfectly safe, and how rich I had found its three cities visited by me and had called Moscow the Manchester of Russia. Directly the train arrived near Chantilly, I was overjoyed at revisiting after some 10 years my favourite Paris, the only city of Europe, where I had enjoyed some of the best days of my life and hope yet to enjoy therein should God the Almighty will it so. For it is not to the Parisians and to the Frenchmen in general, I owe a grudge. If I have had any misunderstand ing, it teas only with certain men ofthe Ecole de Medecine. and to which I have alluded in my letter headed \" Below the Surface \" printed in Appendix No. C. If this time I found my theatri cal man down on me. it was more on account of my having deserved his taunt \" il etait chez Bismark\" and for having exposed the Ecole de Medecine man's trick to put me in bad odour with my patron et maitre, as he used to call the English. All my effort in this direction to expose the real mischief starter of 1881 had the effect of drawing out the Parisian,\u2014 a certain class of them only ; not the respectable and. well-to-do and"], [270, "252 learned Francais, upon whose savoir vivre I should always rely. I knew how mes gateaux de riz were received at the bureau de charyement by the clerk in charge ; and how irritated he used to get directly he had to prepare for me, the expediteur, un bulletin de depot ; and how under that sort of irritation he, the posting clerk, used to cry out \" maintenant, il est sol, sol.\" I knew it was in self-defence, I was obliged to make a clean breast, or as an Anglais had rightly remarked, to make my confession as to what I did and said in Paris contre h regime Anglais des Indes'm 1880-81 ; and if iu doing so I had to betray the Ecole de Medecine man, it was purely out of self-defence and nothing more. But for all that I owe him no grudge. If to-morrow I should set my foot in Europe, I shall be the first to visit Paris and to enjoy the pleasures of life in Paris once more, and be happy in the city of Paradise of the Living. Hence it was that directly the station of Chautilly came (which place is about 30 kilometres from Paris) I was naturally in a sort of glee and excitement. I had actually given myself to a musical tune, more to cut the militaire Allemand, who had all the day his full mad-go against me. To his fellow-passengers I heard him speaking in French, with his arms folded and crossed across his chest, as if embracing somebody, so that I may understand his cutting remarks, that \" he will go to-night and embrace his cocottes \" and what not ; said further \"that there will be a regular pour out of his love-songs, of which he is giving us a rehearsal.\" Decency forbids my describing the exact way in which he used to caricature me, in the presence of the entire corps de chauffeurs ni the White Giant, travelling with me from Koln to Paris. I quietly heard all he as well as the other four passengers had to say, viz., the two Anglo-Canadians aud the two paid agents of our White Baby, preserving all the while my calmness, like a Brahmin of Benares. A critical period in the struggle between the White Giant's Agents and the Tourist in the train. \u2014 My coolness"], [271, "253 had the effect of allowing a full and complete escape to the steam of the Allemand militaire. Directly his froth subsided, I took a French newspaper in hand and pretending to read it, read as it were therefrom in an audible tone the following :\u2014 \"It is real moral cowardice to be attacking a stranger, a solitary traveller, without any reason or justification. Shame ! shame ! ! it is actual moral cowardice on the part of the people who behave so and so forth.\" This cut had such a nice effect in quieting the whole lot and the militaire voyageur especially, that his facial angles worked themselves up into a long face, downcast and small looking. Every other passenger \u2014 one of the two Anglais, who sang the Poli-comedie song No. 9, p. 14, and the old Alsacienne as well as the man to my left \u2014 also wore a long face. Each and all seemed somewhat puzzled what to do. How to return the kick? A little time after, all decided to quit the compartment en masse, and were on the look-out for the conductor. I cared not a jot. I knew I had paid for my passage to Paris, and the Railway was bound to put me down to my destination. At one time finding the annoyance unbearable, I had thought of calling the conductor and shifting myself into another compartment. But I said to myself, I'll only be exposing my sensitive points ; I had better not do that ; and conceived the plan of imitating the Anglo- Canadian and pretended like him to read my thoughts in English in a French paper I had then with me, in the manner indicated above. Of the eight passengers in our compartment, the only three busy-bodies were the old woman from the Berlin station, her neighbour to my left (both of whom I prefer naming Alsaeien mendiants), and the militaire Allemand with a figure somewhat blown up, approaching the abdominal type and nose indicative of vanity, conceit, and revenge. This man went so far as to foolishly declare to his neighbours, that the garcons of the Cafes and -Restaurants will be instructed to run that man down. When he was talking so, his face betrayed such signs"], [272, "254 of exultation and glee, that he fancied he would by such means be able to crush me in Paris. Was this sort of declaration, a ruse on his part to frighten me, with an Anti-Viccajee riot of the gargons of Paris, in order to scare me out of it quickly to our White Giant's Giant London. For, I had distinctly declared to some grisettes of the shops I was dealing with in Berlin, my intention of staying iu Paris for one full month. I had also sent a message (29th August), from Moscow to Bombay saying \"Returning via Paris.\" After the very dis gusting scene at the Opera House, Warsaw, where I was openly insulted by an aged respectable Englishman, calling me a bete, in the presence of the high military Russian officers there present, I had almost decided no more to go to London ; and my decision I even declared in a post card written from Warsaw to Bombay, saying I have scratched out London from my programme of tour, and that I should be returning from Paris to India direct. It is possible that my White Giant's babies thus came to learn my intention of staying in Paris for a month and to proceed straight on thence to my home- For they all are scattered broad-cast in the cities of Europe, to pick up whatever bread-crumbs and sweets they can obtain there ; on our Giant's own table, in his own tight little isle, there is hardly enough of room to accommodate them all. I was every day quietly witnessing how these our babies used to surround me, in whatever part of Europe I happened to be. It may be to chase me out of Paris, that this dodge may have been conceived, and with the news of which his agents and a couple of babies with me in the train wanted to forestall me before entering that beloved city. I said to myself \u2014 \" All right, my White Baby's corps of travelling chauffeurs. If the Police of your own city of Berlin could not chase me out of it, could you or your employer, the White Giant of West minster, hope to succeed in his game of chase, through such agency as the garcon of a Parisian cafe. As mentioned in one of my letters to the London Times written from Paris, dated"], [273, "255 Sept. 14th, 1.90, the superior savoir vivreoi the French people, high and low, educated aud uneducated, was a sufficient guarantee to me that the delusion Auglais could not do me in the capital of the French, that harm which it did me in Berlin ; say what you like and preach into my ears whatever your deluded brains prompt you to frighten me. All such stuff or talk is fiddlesticks to me.\" The cut I gave these travelling chauffeurs of our White Babies in the train from Koln while approaching Paris, had the desired effect, and after leaving Chantilly I found them quiet. Why? Because, they found to their better experience that do what they like, il n'a pas peur. When the Tour d'Eiffel came in sight about half an hour previous to our arrival at the Gare du Nord, the young lady seated opposite to me had the goodness to direct my attention to it and to show it to me. Even the foolish Cana dian-Anglais was sobered down, and exchanged some words with me. The two Alsaeien mendiants to my left affected to be poli et douce. But all this sort of calmness was no more to be trusted. The spiteful wasp was there, burning inwardly from the effects of moral -cowardice blister I had given the whole set, and which he seemed to feel was meant more for him and for his neigh bour the Anglais, than the poor miserable, illiterate old clothes men and women by my side. So he and his congeners conceived of another stupid plan directly after sighting the Eiffel tower. It was to hold themselves ready (some even kept standing with their umbrellas and portmanteau in hands) to get down at a roadside station, believing that I was a dupe or a drole, a fool who had no head to think and to reason, but to blindly imitate them. They thought I would be the first to descend tout de suite on the platform, being close to the carriage door, and thus make an exhibition of myself before the entire monde in the train. They seemed to think that I was perhaps another green horn, like my persecutor, the veritable greenhorn of a John Be 11, who like the evergreen 'Xnias tree, greenest not only in summer but even if it is frosting and snowing. In this their 17"], [274, "256 stupid device they faded, and the poor illiterate dirty-clothes paid agent of my White Baby seated to my left, accounted for it in his own way of reasoning, saying that they all failed to drop me down on the platform of a road-side station, some 12 kilo- metres to the eastward of Paris, because I carried a watch in hand and noted the time of arrival of the train there, and was guided by it solely, and not by my brain or eyes. Just fancy the ways of reasoning of a set of men, who are simpletons enough to believe that after my 18 months of residence in Paris, I could not recognise or know (some 10 years after, while entering it) when and where to get down from an express train going to that city. PARIS. At the very sight of the city, I thanked God for having spared my life with its health and strength to visit this the most picturesque city of the world. The severe kicking and irritation I had hitherto endured, since leaving Wiesbaden from my own deluded femme ylnglaiseh&d so shattered my health, that I thought of resting here for some time to pick up flesh and strength again. It is the only city of Europe where I have enjoyed most, simply because I know its language, howsoever imperfectly, and where I can even now recall some of the very pleasant evenings, I have spent with my confreres and others in the cafes and the dancing saloons surrounding the Ecole de Medecine. With the single exception of a slight accidental contre- temps in connection with my These dc Doctoral, a little before my return to India in April 1881, I never had any mishap there. As I have rightly observed in my first letter to the English Times : To us Indians the capital cities of Europe are a great attraction \u2014 a real paradise, and Paris to me is the zenith of the paradise. It was natural therefore to expect of me that I should turn to Paris, and be attracted to that city of charm and joy like a magnet."], [275, "257 My favourite Paris arrives. \u2014 Sept. 2nd. \u2014 Arrived in my favourite Paris punctually at 6-30, and the moment I set my foot in this city of the free and frank people of Europe, my joy knew no bounds. I had resolved to jouir de la vie in this my zenith of European paradise, to the best of my ability and means at command. I went temporarily to the Hotel in No. 2, Boulevard des Italiens, which I knew since 1875. My object was more to revive notre ancienne amitie there. I was glad to find the same old proprietor, who had transferred the business to his son, he himself having retired to his country seat, and the Hotel building much improved. Ascenseur, electric light, a bathroom, a salon de lecture and improved sanitary arrange- ments, with new fittings and furniture everywhere. I was given my old room No. 42, au cinquieme, its tariff doubled this time, six francs par jour. Its old honest and obliging concierge (une veuve) had left, and all hands changed, save the proprietor. After a visit to Lespes, the great coiffeur oi Paris (his son after his death since my last visit carrying on the business of Lespez Coiffeur, and whose saloon is worth any tourist's visit), I went to the Bouillon Duval and thence, after dinner, I left to call on Dr. Anger, one of my professors and examiners, at the Ecole de Medecine, Paris. Mon ami et confrere Mons. le Docteur Anger. \u2014 This confrere had come to Bombay a little before the Paris Exhibition on his way home from a tour across the Pacific via Japan and China. He had come to spend a week in Bombay, after doing Calcutta and Delhi. I had shown him some interesting sights of Bombay, and also introduced him to some of my confreres ang lais here, Dr Vandyke Carter, Dr. George Waters, and others. In return for the little service I had done him here, he had promised me un bon acceuil, whenever I might chance to be in his city. I had slyly sounded him one evening on his way to his Hotel on the Esplanade, from my house, where I had invited him to a dinner d la Parsee. I was glad to be assured by him at the time that the ugly affair of the These irritation was by this time"], [276, "258 forgotten, and that I could come to the \"Exposition which, he said, was going to be le plus granite et plus magnifique than all its predecessors, and enjoy life in Paris. Dr Anger's concierge, at 14, Rue du General Foy, told me he had shifted to Passy, and gave me his address, 18, Rue de la Faisanderie. I left my card for him and returned to my hotel after a promenade in the Boulevards at about 11 o'clock. \u2022' ./ little game not worth killing.\"\u2014 1 heard the concierge of the Hotel de Russie (a new person) directly she saw me pass her room to the staircase, speaking to a garcon, who was then standing by her, that \" Ce Monsieur est drdle,\" &c, and there after she worked the lift up to put me on my cinquieme itage au dcssus de t'cntresol. I could easily see that if a person, who had never seen me before, and to whom I was a perfect stranger, dares to attack me so boldly, either I should have by my behaviour or address given her some cause, or that she must have been put up by somebody to insult me. Next morning (Sept. 3rd) when I got down for my cafe complet at the Hotel Restaurant, an English-speaking passenger directs the attention of others round about him to me, by saying, \" We have a sick man here, we arc going to shut him up in his room.\" After he left, another English-speaking passenger (a shrewd Yankee he seemed to me) cried out \" A little game not worth killing.\" \"On vous. aj pelle drole a cause de votre couleur, couleur; ilus e/es si noir.\"\u2014 I left the Hotel by 10 o'clock for Dr. Anger's, taking with me the draft of a letter I wanted published in some French newspaper, like Le Temps or fa France or Figaro, exposing all the boycotting devices of my White Giant of Westminster. This my draft, I desired to show to Dr. Anger, who without letting me read it, advised me not to attempt such a thing, as he doubted very much, if any Paris journal would ever dare to publish anything contre les anglais, who are, he said, tres puissant et se font tres aimable. He further wanted to throw cold water on the"], [277, "259 heated brain of his friend, the Tourist, by assuring him with a half-serious and half-comic pose, which only a Francais is capable of assuming, that \" On vous appelle drole a cause de votre couleur, couleur, \" and pointing to his own forehead and face, said \"vous etes si noir\" in those parts, as if I was the only coloured man going in Paris, and deserved to be marked on that account as\" c'est le drole.\" Meaning of the French uoid drole. \u2014 I may here clearly explain the meaning of the French word drole. As an adjective, if applied to a man, scene or idea, it means something sin gular, pleasant, amusing or original, funny or queer. Thus c'est uh drdle d' homme or c'est homme Id est bien dr6le, means he is a queer fellow. As a substantive, it means a knave, a rogue, a fellow, and if meant to injure the reputation or character of a person, it means a blackguard or scamp. It also means a fool, and a contemptible person. Littre, in his Dic tionary, says, \" Se dit d'un homme ou d'un enfant qui, ayant quelque chose de decid-3, de delure, ne laisse pas d'exciter quelque inquietude. En un sens tout a fait injurieux, un mauvais drole, ou simplement un drole, une personne mepris able,\" which means a thorough blackguard. Dr. Anger's side-face (Dr. Anger de profil.) \u2014 Dr. Anger evi dently wanted to smooth the ugly affair by explaining it in his own Parisian style. It may be that he feared the old Dreyfous These irritation of 1881 would be revived, and the mischief it then worked or at least succeeded in setting up as far as Angle terre, across the channel, might be recalled. He evidently feared that the seeds of the plant then sown by his own colleague! Monsieur le docteur Benjamin Ball in 1881, and so fondly watered by some of his confreres et etudiants de I' Ecole de Medecine must have by this time grown into a giant tree. I may here observe that this colleague of his, a Jew and a Scotchman by birth, finding he could star his abilities, as the author of his \" Lecons sur les maladies mentales,\" much better in Paris than in his own country, had denationalized himself, and now (although an"], [278, "260 Englishman) dons the chapeau republicaiii ofthe Parisian. Dr. Anger rightly feared that the bulky and tough branches of that Dreyfous These tree would now injure the walls of his own new theatrical maison in the boulevard St. Germain. So he had a double role to fill. First, to pose as mon ami particiilier ; second, as the guardian of the interests of his own maison. In his former capacity on the veiy first evening (Sept. 3rd) of our interview, he had placed at my disposal the f au ten il dc medecine de service at the Grand Opera. In fact, that very morning at 1 1 o'clock he had called at my Hotel and left for me the following note : \u2014 \"Cher Ami, \u2014 Venez done ii l'Opera ce soir, j'ai une place a vous offrir. Demandez de la part du Dr. Anger le fautcuil du Docteur (Amphitheatre No. 60). A ce soir. Amitie. Anger.\" He introduced me to several of his friends, confreres especially. On my applying to him for a bon marche hotel, he recommended me personally to the proprietor of a hotel on the other side of the river, where he said, I might enjoy the society of the members of the Senate and the Chambre des Deputes, and many professional savants \u2014 an agreeable, good French society. He said further, with an air to please, a trait in French character, that in the Hotel of his choice, 1 will be made a prince. To pose further as my bienveillant ami, he used to come daily to me in the evening at the Table d'hote of the Hotel I had lodged in at his recommendation, and used to spend about half an hour with me in cas (5s of his own choice, previous to my nightly promenade or entry into a theatre. On the first day he even volunteered to drive me to the Cornptoir National d'Escompte de Paris, all the way from his house, 18, Rue dela Faisandrie to Rue Bergere, and there he acted as my interpreter to my demand for my remittance and my Ville de Paris bond, sent to its care from Bombay, by the mail of July 31st, and which draft and bond though arrived at the Bank on Augt. 19th were not delivered to me till Sept. 8th. All this he did in his individual capacity as a confrere et ami of one, who was some use and help to him in Bombay, and in return for which he"], [279, "261 had given him a puff in his Note de Vogage d'un Globe-trotter, contributed to a French Review, and published since in the form of a book. In his other capacity, as a guardian of the Ecole de Medecine, he once or twice sounded me as to the Dreyfous These, asking me on what subject it was, just to learn if I yet recollected the irritation it had caused in 1881 among the Ecole de Medecine men. I had heard him once telling the Greek Doctor, seated opposite to us at the Dinner table of the Hotel de France et de Lorraine, 5 Rue de Beaune, the nature of the \"petit travail\" (These) then presented by me for the Diplome de Doctorat. lt was only when he kept sounding me more than 3 or 4 times, whether I was likely to be going to London and when, and that he should like to accompany me, and asked me if I would show him that city, that I at once felt that there was going to be again enacted a repetition of 1881, of my Life in Paris ; and I said to myself, \"Ne vousfiez pas d lui, c'est une ficelle.\" (Don't trust him, he is a dodger). I recalled to myself the old stale fact of 1881, how my Quartier Latin friends, agitated by the irritation or humiliation of the kick, they themselves fancied the Dreyfous These had given the whole Ecole Francais, fruitlessly tried to boycott me and to chase me out of Paris, just as my friend the White Giant wanted to do with me now. ( Vide Poli-comedie song No. 13, pp. 14). How failing in this their method of boycotting me, they had all then kept asking me if I was going to London and when, in order to enable them to work up their astute plan of putting me in bad odour with one whom they fancy to be my patron et maitre, and of whom they seemed to say I am afraid. That I was perfectly justified in my surmise or my estimate of his character as a double-dealer, will appear at once to the reader directly he studies some of his Poli-comedie songs (vide Nos. 3, 5, 1 0 and 16). As a member or visitor of the Club Anglais, a fact I found out much later on (and which he never disclosed to me) he had to sustain a certain role in the Poli-comedie"], [280, "262 Anglais. Could it be that his eagerness to learn from me when I wanted to go to London was due to bis associal ion with les Anglais in their ( 'lub, near the Madeleine Church ': Tbe only time of the day when I saw him was in the evenings, when he used to be present at the Table d'hote in my Hotel. Here his seat was close to mine ; all the while he was talking with a lot of his countrymen and friends ; barely exchanging a dozen sentences with me as to how I passed my day, what parts of Paris I had visited, and what theatre I was going to that evening. His modulation of French words and sentences were so familiar to me, that I could with some attention and i ft'orl follow him in his conversation with the Greek Doctor and other ladies and gentlemen round about us on the taUo. The very first day (Sept. 4th) of our meeting in the dining room, and on the evening following, he was saying a lot of things about me, calling me \"chien enrage ; il hint les Anglais; il va I urr les Anglais ; il est un ami particulier de patron de mon maison; je ne pent pas le met/re a laporte, il ira dans six semaines d'iei au Chine; iljamais fume ; il va chercher une chambre meublei pour mener...\" \u2014 all such talk made me distrust the man. At the dinner-table he would tell me without even my asking him the price of the dinner, \" Trois francs cinquante.\" But his very voice while uttering these words I found full of chicaneiy. Directly he repeated these words \" trois francs cinquante,\" a young miss (American or English) facing us, would begin to grin. Again, some humorous expressions are dropped and the five or six Mesdames et Messieurs would burst out laughing. After dinner he used to accompany me to a cafe. where almost every night I had to folk out a cinq franc piece for our consummation, viz., cafe noir for me ; and a cafe avec cognac for him. If the garcon would demand a charge of -50c. for each petit verve de cognac, he would check the garcon and tell him to charge for superior brandy and to demand fur the two verres or liqueur glasses of \"fin champagne a raison d'un franc, se fait deux francs,\" alleging he had taken fin champagne"], [281, "263 (or superior Brandy) aud not ordinary. The garcon Would hereupon smile and return me a small balance of say 1 on \\ franc. This very man - my trusted ami et confrere of Paris would tell me, when the garcon would wait for his pourboire to pay him 20 to 30 centimes. It was, as it were, teaching or initiating me into the habit of paying what I look upon as a regular garcon tax. The pourboire tax in Paris. \u2014 A garcon means a waiter, or shop-boy or pot-boy at a wine merchant's. Thus Le garcon d'un restaurant or d'un cafe is the waiter in a tavern or in a coffee-house. The garcon class of Parisian restaurants do not believe themselves to be regular waiters, although they work as such. Any garcon will tell you when questioned, he is more than a waiter or a garcon ; he is in addition a negociant or correctly negociateur. For, says he, it is he who brings and secures the customers or clientele for his employer's tavern or coffee house. I have been told by several of these garcons, that they are obliged to pay their employers for the right to serve in their restaurants as garcons. Even the victoria or brougham driver (there are no vehicles like the cabs or hansoms of London) in Paris, i. e., the cocher expects you to pay him after giving his proper fare of T50 frs. = Is 3c/. for a course (which is actually 3d. more than what one has to pay in London) his pourboire, say 4 sous or 2d. If you don't, or refuse it after a demand is made for it, you are cursed (just as I have been often times) in some such words as \" Malheur arrive d vous.\" Tri fling though such matters seem to be, they afford to a critical tourist a gauge, wherewith to measure the comparative wealth and poverty of the two largest cities of the world on both sides of the British channel. The stranger's life in Paris is like living in a glass-house: \u2014 Everything is managed in Paris with such strict secrecy and with such a spirit of coalition and patriotism, under the banner of \" Liberte, Egalite, et Fraternise,\" that few strangers have the chance of looking below the surface. As regards many French"], [282, "264 places of business or amusement, what I have found pecu liar is that although a Frenchman in Paris would tell you, \"On famais fail V attention sur quelqu'un d Paris\" \u2014 it is quite the contrary case. Every stranger of note or means living in Paris, temporarily or for a long time, whether for amusement or study, he is after all living as it were in a glass-house. His balance at the Bank in Paris is known to the people most in terested in him. The purchases he makes are noted ; there is a constant eye on the amount of money he spends every evening in theatres and cafes and other places of amusement. And why is it so ? Simply because Paris is one of the principal cities of Europe which lives on the traffic of strangers, who flock to it ; and to amuse them and to keep them there, there tire a thousand aud one devices invented. It is in proportion to his poche and his liberality, he receives the puff of a polite wave of the chapeaux, or the graceful smile of his hotel -keeper's wife or an au revoir or bonjour, Monsieur ; bonsoir, Monsieur ; or a bon voyage from the concierge and the garcons of shops, restau rants and hotels. Paris nocturnal, a study in itself. \u2014 To a critical eye, Paris by night is in itself a study. If he can but quietly play his role of an observer of the unobserved ones, I am sur _ he will find much worth his connaissance. Although the Paris matutinal, the Paris industrial, the Paris scientific, are quite different from Paris nocturnal, still it is upon the latter and this alone \u2014 Paris de null \u2014 that they all feed. It will be quite foreign to my object of getting up a Looking-glass for my Poli- comedians to go further into this matter. But some of these days I'll take good care to transfer my experience gained on this point, to my coun trymen in India. The Americans have had enough of lessons to enable them to watch the purse of their countrymen sent across the Atlantic for a continental tour. One has only to read \" Paris by Night, \" a little book obtainable from many of tbe English book stalls in Rue de Rivoli, and satisfy himself whether what I state here is true."], [283, "265 Les chiens laches on the Pd. Montmartre on the night of Sep tember 4th, 5th and 6th. \u2014 When my Poli- comedian Dr. Anger, a member of the Club Anglais and a globe-trotter kept, asking me some half a dozen times for the first two or three days if I was at all to go to London and when, and even volunteered to join me in my London tour. Was he then acting as a feeler pour les Anglais \u2014 his friends in the Club Anglais ? Or was he going to later le terrain, on behalf of his own maison, and to judge whether I was worthy of being protected by his countrymen, during my tem porary stay in their city, from the wild chase of the deluded Anglais. I am sure had I then (during my first week of entry in Paris Sept. 2nd to 9th) frankly declared to him, that I was going to London to see rny countrymen, and that thence it was my in tention to go and see also the other cities of England which I had never before seen, he would have at once told his countrymen of the Quartier Latin (where the Ecole de Medecine is situated) that I was only a passing bird, and not worthy of being given a protection from the fanatic persecution of the Poli-comedie actors, the deluded Anglais of the Boulevards. He knew how fanatically I was run down about a 100 yards from the Hotel I was in ( Hotel de Russie, 2 Boulevard des Italiens), on my way to the cafes in the neighbourhood of the Passage Jouffroy by the English, who directly they saw me on the night of Sept. 4th, 5th and 6th, began to cry out \" Monsieur le drdle, sou, bete, fye\" and when tired, saying \"Monsieur, comprends pas, monsieur comprends pas.\" The last expression was an acknowledgment on the part of the deluded men of their discomfiture ; their failure to shake me, do what they can while moving in the crowd on the Boulevards. I knew it from the ring of their voices, that it was not Francais or rather the Parisian, or more correctly speaking it was not the voice of the Quartier Latin man, that was then trying to tap me at my wrong ends, should I have any. But it was clearly the voice of my boycotter in Europe, the White Baby of White Hall, who was now interested in chasing me out of Paris ; and had"], [284, "266 actually begun his game of chase from Wiesbaden and earned it all along my tour through Berlin and Russia to this city, For my Ecole de Medecine man had this time no reason, no interest whatever to chase me out of Paris, to mettre moi a la porte. He hardly was aware of my arrival in Paris. Even if he was, I was sure no Parisian, not even the unpolished Quartier Latin man would ever dare to demean himself to that species of moral cowardice, as was displayed to me by the babies of roy White Giant on the evening of September 4th, 5th and 6th. When under a cover of darkness men choose to hide themselves and to sing loud in a language not their own, their favourite Hungarian Waltzes (above indicated), during my promenade on the trottoir on the Boulevard Montmartre, I knew how to behave and how to withstand such cowardly at tacks, though an Indian and a \" slave\" of the Emperor of the Hindoos. I could not conceive of a more contemptible exhibition which any Poli-comedie actor could make before his neighbour. It is his neighbour, the theatrical man, who enjoyed most the fun. For I heard Dr. Anger, the Greek Doctor and others round about me on the Table d'hote, referring to this wild and fanatic chase of \"le chien lac he ei 'qui d fait rien, settlement it a fait le journaliste\" and enjoyed the fun of it. They called the chase a regular Poli-comedie or political comedy played out before them, for their amusement by their eccentrique neigh bours and patrons, and wherein I the unfortunate Indian Tourist was to play the role of a victim. He will have lo pay by his neck when he goes back to India.'\" \u2014 One of these very evenings when I was with Dr. Anger at the Cafe de la Quai d'Orsay, I happened to complain to him at the sort of persecution my deluded White Babies of the continent were carrying on, he told me \" Keep quiet, and you will find in a week's time eveiything will subside.\" Plow he happened to divine that sort of termination of the wild chase or boycotting of me, it is easy to understand. He knew. perhaps from his connection with the Club Anglais, and had also"], [285, "267 reason to believe, that I was no longer in any part of Europe to the eastward of Frankfort, where the White Giant does not, as a rule, like an Indian to travel, and the delusion Anglais must subside. Well it did subside, but not to the extent he or I expected. If it did not manifest itself again or any more in that most contemptible form as in the Boulevard Montmartre, still there it was, firmly ingrained in the minds of our White Babies. For at the Tour d'Eiffel and the Hippodrome where I spent my time on the 4th, at the Pasteur's Institute where I was on the 6th, at the Exposition at the Palace de 1' Industrie, at Versailles, and even in my own Hotel, I used to hear not only the usual \" Article de Paris \" or the Parisian expressions to boycott and to chase an unpleasant man out of one's country, but such threatening language, as \" he will have to pay by his neck when he goes back to India !\" The man who threatened me with this sort of expression was speaking pure Queen's English. He may be a \" subject of the Queen,\" residing in John Bull's own \" Home, sweet Home,\" or may have come from his Dominion of Canada. The lady close by this man I recollect once questioning me, \" What is to become of India if the Russians go there ?\" ( Vide Poli-comedie song No. 6, p. 13). It is to this lady and herfriends that Dr. Anger had once (Sept. 8th) while introducing me at the Table d' hote of 5 Rue de Beaune, said \" Docteur Viccajee dislikes the English,\" assuring me at the same time that the ladies and gentlemen seated opposite to me were not English but Ameri cans (vide Poli-comedie song No. 5). Revival of the Anti-Anglais pose. \u2014 On the day following, while exchanging his usual salutations, my Professeur and Examiner Dr. Anger called me \"Docteur Viccajee, le Tippoo Saheb,\" thinking I would be flattered and complimented by that sort of title. When I immediately questioned him why he complimented me in that style, he said, \" Don't you know Tippoo Saheb waged a successful war against the English at Seringapatam ?\" I guarded silence, but from that very day"], [286, "268 i Sept. 9th) I felt, I ought no more to confide in this man, as my ami et confrere, in this theatrical city of Europe. That very moment, I felt that this my Professeur of the Ecole de Medicine, Paris, was betraying himself, or going to play the same role, as his colleagues of the Quartier Latin, when they wanted (in 1881) to fasten on me the \" Anti-Anglais pose. \" I recalled to myself my student days in Paris, after I was received as Docteur en medicine there, when in order to fasten on me the Anti- Anglais pose, what a variety of means were adopted by my music and dancing teachers, Mesdames Ball, Pinet, Berger, Gosselin, Simon, Lancereaux, Fort, Verneuil and Dieu lafoy, and several others too numerous to mention here, and the names of whom I have now almost forgotten. I soon felt that this my Ecole de Medecine friend was up to his old game again. That by flattering me with such historic appellations as \" Tippoo Saheb,\" aud by preaching to me his countrymen's views in a has les Anglais style, he thought he could easily fasten on me once more (after some 10 years) this Anti- Anglais pose. He and through him all his Ecole de Medecine friends thought they could easily now show me up, in their own capital to my \" maitre et patron\" as the veritable Anti-Anglais of 1881, and thus justify their action of that year, when I was presented to the Londoners, as the P'enian Indou, deserving of being chased out of Europe back to India. The Parisian always wide-awake and comique. \u2014 After my late, bitter chase commencing from Wiesbaden, throughout Germany and Russia, down to the very gates of Paris, and in the veiy heart of Paris itself, Dr. Anger and his friends and confreres thought it would be easy to paint me as the \" Indou qui hait les Anglais, il va tuer les Anglais\"; and that if they could but do it now this time, as they once did in 1881, they were sure that my greenhorn of a John Bull will see more reason to confide in them, as his real friends and benefactors, and thank them also for the splendid service rendered to him. It is this sort of conduct which I prefer calling double -dealing,"], [287, "269 in which art no nation of Europe is so adept as the one represen- ted by my theatrical man. Although he never stirs out of his theatre\u2014 for Paris he calls \"11 ny a que Paris\"; \"Paris sans pair, theatre d' Europe\" \u2014 and is always confined within its four corners, on that account he is not a greenhorn, like our sea-girt John Bull. In his theatrical maison, he comes daily into contact with men of all nationalities and from all countries, who flock to him for his shows and to taste his gateaux sucres and to enjoy in his \" Paris pour tons les poches.\" To every stranger he always preaches in order to keep them attracted to his shows, that \" vivre d Paris est plus bon marche qu'd Londres\" and many a simpleton of a stranger (like myself) charmed by his gilded palace and the smile by which this sort of stuff is preached to him, believes what is told to him by a member of the \" free and frank\" nation of Europe, and perhaps often believes more than is told to him. It is by his daily coming in contact with such species of greenhorns, les sojourners et les etrangers, that the Parisian, shut up in his own Theatre of Europe, has the op- portunity of studying the weak points or traits of character in the individual members of a nation. John Bull's wrong ends are well-known to the Parisian. \u2014 I believe that of all the nations of Europe, if there be any whose sensitive points or wrong ends he has studied most, it is that of my \" Time-is-money\" man, our greenhorn of a John Bull, his great rival since the time of Napoleon. Ever since Waterloo, he is very jealous of our John Bull's prestige and power, and this sort of jealousy was on the point of being practically manifested in 1859. Louis Bonaparte in that year worked up the scare of invasion of England, and which scare gave our John Bull the idea for the first time, to start the Volunteer system, ;'. .. to raise an army of Volunteer soldiers. This Volunteer system, he has lately extended to his colonial possessions as well. But in India he seems to distrust his Hindoo subjects, even, after more than a century's rule therein, that he would not on any account enlist them as Volunteers."], [288, "270 He thinks and is perhaps justified in so thinking, that the handful of an army of the toy soldiers, he is training up on the main lines of Railways and the chief cities of India, is sufficient to do the work of a military police for him in times if i langer. Iu verification of what I have here mentioned, as to the sort of feeling with which I have often observed our frank, honest and industrious Time-is-money man islooked down upon by his theatrical neighbour, I should like to mention les pantomimes et caricatures anglais shown nightly in the music halls < ales Chantant) of Paris, and the Anti- Anglais songs I have at times heard sung by the students of Quartier Latin ; the secret scorn cast upon him in French society, upon his \" home-life,\" his \"club-life,\" his chequered Scotch tweed coat and umbrella, his files always wanting in grace and manners, his institu tions, and his uncared for \" pauvres et miserables \" (for out of every 100 Londoners more than 5 persons have to be supported by public charity). I should also like to draw the reader's attention to the entire John Bull series, such as John Bull and his Island, John Bull's Womankind, Our Dear neighbours, John Bull the Junior, &c., and many other critical works on our friend, the countryman of the conqueror of the Hindoos. Sensation in London in 1881 and on the Black List ever since. \u2014 All this was known to me ever since my student daj 3 in Paris, 1879-80-81. When I found my theatrical man for his own purpose and ends trying in 1881 to put me in bad odour with his own \" chers voisins,\" I was somewhat indiffer ent to his tricks or dodges. I relied more on the calm, collected and proverbially cool judgment of our John Bull, and quietly returned home to Bombay, though not without causing a sensation in London in March 1881,. when I was there after the Dreyfous These mischief, to purchase my stock of surgical instruments and books. I am sure many an Anglo- Indian in Bombay is aware of this fact. During my evening promenade on the Queen's Road, I could read soon after my"], [289, "271 return to Bombay, a silent hatred of me on their faces, and I knew how in the evening parties and public meetings, my presence was noted by some of the high officials here. A couple of passengers, who voyaged with me in the P. and O. S. S. Travancore, generally recognise me oftentimes here in Bombay, with what sort of souvenirs is only mutually known and understood between us. So long as the irritation Anglais reflected to London, from the Quartier Latin, Paris, in 1881, did not at all touch me, beyond a slight rub on board the Messageries Maritimes S. S. Ava, in which I returned from Marseilles to Point de Galle (in April of that year), I cared very little to notice it. I was, however, on the point of acting then upon the wisdom of the French proverb, \"Aux grands maux les grands remedes,\" and exposing all my theatrical man's tricks. I was about to lay bare the facts and circumstances in connection with the small and feeble Anti-Viccajee riot of the Rue de l'Ecole Quartier, in the shape of a small public lecture styled \" How I obtained my diplome of Docteur en Medecine de la Faculte de Paris.\" But I was dissuaded from taking such a drastic measure, by some of my intimate friends here, from whom I took counsel at the time. I relied upon my own way of looking at the affair, viz. : that it was, after all, a pure sell of my Greenhorn by his wily theatrical neighbour. I said to myself if my frank John Bull was offended in any way, by what I said and did in Paris, concerning the management of his Asiatic shop, he could not fail to question me on that point and learn for himself, whether what was brought to his knowledge by his own neighbour in Europe was true, and at all worth his while to notice. This he, my White Giant of White Hall has failed to do, not only in his own home (London), but here in his Asiatic granary, where he is all-powerful. Why? It is easy to understand. He knew that I was only a few days in London ; barely a week I had stayed there in Trinity Square close to Guy's (in March 18"], [290, "272 18S1), and was about to go to India. He knew that I was no longer going to prolong my stay in Europe, and as a practical man, he did not like to stand in my way of voluntary exile to India. To me it was a return to my own dear home ; to him it was a sort of voluntary exile or transportation of me to the east of the Suez Canal, far off from his sensitive points, the capital cities of Europe. It was enough for him to keep me on his \"Black List\" ever since 1881, and always to keep his eye on me, lest I should again find my way to Paris, or to some other part of Europe. I believe I am quite right in asserting that ever since that time, he, my White Giant, has minuted that no more I should be allowed to revisit Europe. To my White Giant's great surprise, within some three hours I happened to quit his Indian cage, and I am sure the fact was brought to his notice by wire from his agents hero. And he took precious good care to bring all the machi nery of his Consular and Intelligence Departments, scattered over the continent, to use all his might and power to chase the Indian Fenian, his Red Rag ever since 1881, out of Em-ope. Failure of the deluded chase predicted. \u2014 But the means our White Giant adopted for this purpose were thoroughly childish, insensate, and purely Parisian. The Parisian broom he had handled to chase me out of Europe was like many of its \"articles de Paris,\" fragile. From the moment he called in the help of a Latin race man to fire his gun in the Messina Harbour, from the moment his petit fille handled the Parisian broom at the Kur__,al Hall, Wiesbaden, I felt that our White Giant will not succeed in chasing me out of Europe. My original programme was to return to India by the boat of September 1st, after a short peep at Europe. This date I changed at the instance of an Anglo-Indian passenger (Mr. E. Grant) from the N.W. Provinces, who said he was about to return from his 3 months' leave, by a bateau de luxe sailing on Septr. 20th, and recom mended me to return with him by the same vessel. But the"], [291, "273 strong pull our White Giant caused to be given to me at Berlin, exasperated me more, and I became more bold, \u2014 \" a bold beggar,\" as one of his countrymen whispered into my ears in the Grand Opera, Paris (vide Poli-cotnedie song No. l,pp. 12). I determined with a resolution, characteristic of a Bombay Parsee, to risk all the deluded kicks of the White Giant, and to stretch my tour further onwards to the eastward of Berlin. It was in this city that I first conceived and resolved upon making a tour or at least enjoying a sight of the capital of Russia and its people, \u2014 the Red Rag of the White Giant and of all his Asiatic agents. What effect this alteration in the pro gramme of my tour had on the temper of the Giant and his Babies and their relatives living in Berlin, I have already indicated. In the teeth of their opposition, unarmed even with a passport, I found my way to the frontier of Russia. I was however sent back. Not daunted with this sort of check, I persevered, and after obtaining my passport in Konigsberg, I presented myself again to the Russian frontier officer to let me into his country. One of my mottoes invariably is \" Perseverance crowns Success,\" and thank God, I a poor Indian Black Bug did after all succeed, in facing the crashing kicks of my persecutor, the White Giant of Westminster. After a short but satisfactory tour in the country of this the great European as well as Asiatic power, I found my way to Paris. Plere I was near the Giant's home, only at a 7 hours' run from his Giant London, and in constant communication with him. The Tourist in the Giant's Play-ground. \u2014 In fact the Indian Red Rag of our White Giant had approached him too close ; was in his suburban home. Here the Giant's babies come every summer and autumn to play. They invariably like to bask in the lovely soft sunshine of this land of liberte, egalite, et fraternite. For it is the only place where they can find them selves out of the thick fog, at times dark, black and suffocating, which han\u00b0-s on their Giant London throughout the year, and"], [292, "274 where they can rarely dispense with their heavy parapluie and chequered mackintosh. Here it was after my return from Germany aud Russia, that I had to face boldly the delusion of our White Giant and all his deluded babies. Hero it was that I gleaned the nature of his delusiou from American ladies and American doctors. It was here that I had to bear the severe brunt of the giant's deluded kicks. His chase al Versailles. \u2014 As an instance of one such kick. I would quote here from my diary notes of Sunday tho 7th of September. \"That day I had been to Versailles via Gare du Montparnasse. There were lots of Anglais, much inclined to insult me. Every Englishman or Englishwoman passing by me in the walks of the Versailles gardens would pour into my ear the words drole, sou, bete ; some kept staring, somo frowning ; each and all wore a face expressive of hatred of me. Being alone I took a seat on one of the stone benches near the Basin of Apollo. Seeing me somewhat cowed down and wearing a look full of chagrin et peur, some sensible Frenchmen, pity ing the condition I was in, sent a man in the uniform of a commissionnaire, \u2014 very likely a guard of the palace of Ver sailles, to come and take his seat beside me. Directly I saw him seated close to me I soon began to talk to him, and thus succeeded in diverting somewhat my chagrin el peur. While thus spending my time in talking with him, I believed myself safe in his custody, and so long as I was with him the English were quiet. For I believe they understood the hint thus given by some practical and shrewd Frenchmen to them, not to molest me, a solitary traveller.\" I was so persist ently and vindictively molested by the English visitors, who had turned out in large numbers that afternoon in the Versailles gardens, to see Les Grandes Eaux, the fountains and the water play, that I could not help but eagerly cling to this French man in uniform. I left my seat directly he got up ; and to keep him and his young boy in my company, I even treated them to some gustation at a stall set up on the terrace. I"], [293, "275 followed this man to the Railway Station, where I saw him purchase a ticket for his young companion, and for himself present a paper (something like a printed warrant or official pass for a Railway journey), to the ticket clerk who retained the paper aud handed him instead a proper ticket of the 2nd class. We had all booked for Gare St. Lazare, where only I separated from him, thanking him for keeping company with me all the way from Versailles gardens to Paris. Before we quitted the grounds he took me to view the Plall where the Chambre des Deputes was held after the war of 1870-71, and during the time of the Commune in Paris. Here I heard this man referring to me as \" chien laches &c. The Longchamp Race Incident. The ruse of an arrest to frighten the Tourist. \u2014 Next Sunday (14th Sept.) I was to go by the water route to St. Cloud. But in the boat itself there were beside me a number of babies of my White Giant, and I thought it prudent to avoid them. For still it seemed to me from their talk that I was a regular Red Rag to them; so I sailed past the St. Cloud Pier to the Terminal Pier Station, and went to the Longchamps races. Here I found a number of stalls set up by Pari-mutuel keepers and Totalisators. The sight of them recalled to me what a nice little sum I had scored in 1880, at the Grand Prix de Paris, when I stood for the English horse 'Robert the Devil.' Rain had fallen that morning, and many a Frenchman in the Race enclosure and even in the cafe's and Boulevards, was sanguine that the English horse would not come out the winner. But my love for our John Bull and his Isle had not then taken that turn which led Dr. Anger to re mark about a week after my entry in Paris, \"Dr. Viccaji dislikes the English\"; and I naturally was inclined towards an English horse, or at least to choose a horse owned by an Englishman and the winner of the English Derby and the Four Oaks, but whose pedigree though was continental (Austrian)' This time it was not the Grand Prix day, and I had scarcely studied the race programme. I only handed to the totalisators"], [294, "276 my 15 frcs. for the horses, I chose at random in two of the races that remained to be run at the time I ( ntered the Race Enclosure. At about 5 o'clock, I was returning home au pied, following a crowd that was wending its way to the Auteuil Gate. To my great surprise, a Frenchman called me near him and at once arrested me. He and another (neither in the uni form of the French police) held me by each ami, and forcibly dragging me, made me march about 20 yards back to the stall of the totalisators, saying, \"pourquoi vous ave? ici-sr A' argent, avez vous joue, il est defendu jotter ici ; combien avez vous gagne, &c.\" While they were thus questioning me and forcibly dragging me to the Race Stand Police Station indicated by them, I told them, \" Pray, don't handle me so roughly, I am ready to go with you wherever you wish ; pourquoi vous me fail comme ca; si on ne m'aime pas, je suis pret quitter la France, adding at the same time that there are lots of places in the world where I could go and live. I also attentively watched the faces of the multitude round about me, each and all wearing astonishment on their faces, just as if they were on a stage, taking part in some sort of comedy, where an unpleasant man, the victim of delusion Anglais, was being chased out of a city. Directly these two men, my arrestors, found that they could hardly make any impression on me, and that I was ready to march with them, wherever they chose to lead me, they left me and walked off. I too wended my way back to the Auteuil Gate of the Bois de Boulogne, walking with and following the crowd. I heard people walking by my side saying to each other, \" II n'a pas peur ; il est tres durc ; il est riche; dgi presque cinquante.\" At the Auteuil Gate, seeing a restaurant, I took my seat there and feeling thirsty and some what exhausted from being on my legs from 3 to G o'clock, I wanted to refresh myself and called for beer. The garcon would take no notice of me, although some half a dozen times I called for a bock. While seated here, I saw standing some 10 feet in front of me, close to a tree on the trottoir a fattish man,"], [295, "277 with grey whiskers and moustache and somewhat potbellied, and whose hat, shirt, collar and neck-tie left no doubt on my mind, as to his identity as one of the White Babies of my White Giant. I found this man very attentively watching and scanning my face. I only glanced at him rapidly two or three times and pretended not to notice him. After 10 minutes waiting and fruitlessly calling the garcon for un bock (or beer glass as it is called in Paris), I was about to leave when a Frenchman seated at the same table with me, persuaded me not to leave, and in some couple of minutes a bock was brought to me. This I drank, paid for, and by way of marking my displeasure to the garcon, I declined to pay his pourboire, his fee for serving me, as he had rendered to me no service beyond what he was bound to do. That very evening, to show to my White Babies how I saw through their stupid sort of game to chase me out of Paris, I dined heartily at Duval's and enjoyed my evening at the Folies Bergere \u2014 a theatre of varieties. This ruse of an arrest for \" betting at the races \" was prac tised on Sunda}' evening the 14th September, to frighten me as it were out of Paris, and when I returned from the Folies Ber gere theatre that night at 1 li o'clock to the Boulevards, on my way home on the other side of the river, I saw many a man and woman, seated in the cafes and restaurants, point me out as the Indian upon whom the ruse of an arrest was played that evening at the Longchamps Race-course, without frigh tening him in the least. I am inclined to see a good deal of connection between Poli-comedie Song No. 23 (vide pp. 16) and this sort of game of my arrest on a Race course of Paris, at the instance or with the knowledge and connivance of our \"White Giant's agents, located in the Rue St. Honor, of that city. I cannot understand why a Professeur libre should give me, on the 12th of September, his address out of town somewhere near the Pyrenees Alps, to the south of France ? Why should he tell me to guard it in case something befalls me or comes to pass, and when I must stand in need of"], [296, "278 assistance? Was this sort of game anticipated by him ? or did he expect me to get arrested for using any of the fictitious coins, that were surreptitiously passed into my hands later on by dishonest garcons of restaurants and concert halls ? I had even once or twice brought this sort of dishonest trick to chase out an unpleasant stranger to the notice of my Hotel pro prietor, when she only remarked il faut faire V 'attention, afi a number of people were then in the habit of passing false one and two franc pieces into the hands of strangers. I had lived for nearly two years in Paris and this was the third time I was in that city. But at no time was I ever arrested by any man. At no time false coins were passed on to me ; at no time exactions in the shape of over-charges for consummations were imposed upon me, at no time people in the boulevards and hotels or res taurants regarded me with that attention and awe as now ; at no time would any of my professors have seen the necessity of arming me with their address (even if they should be far out of Paris, and beyond reach somewhere in the Pyrenees) and telling me to guard it, \u2014 \" si quelque chose arrive a vous, ecrivez moi, gardez mon adresse.\" This very Professeur libre, when he called at my hotel on the morning of 11th September, asked me \" to show him the way of finding out and recovering le terrain (fields or land) of his uncle, who he said died some 18 years ago in a suburb of Bombay, and of which he had heard nothing \" ! I transfer these lines as they were written in my diary notes of 11th September, Thursday, and must leave the reader to put on them his own interpretation. It looks like the Poli-comedie Song No. 36 (pp. 18), wherein an Englishman at Edinburgh wanted me to show him the way how to recover his claim for \u00a3100 or more, due to him from certain Military Officers serving in India. Tourist resolves to dispel the Giant's delusion. \u2014 When I found my Quartier Latin friends so eager to help my White Babies living in their midst, and to fan the flames of the"], [297, "279 delusion they themselves had originally instilled into their brain, I said, \" This is the proper time and place to show them up to my greenhorn of a John Bull.\" I judged it to be the fittest time and place to open the eyes of my deluded White Giant. I was sure my frank \" Time-is-money\" man was befooled by the wily theatrical man of the Quartier Latin. Seated in his own midst I took pen and paper, and wrote out several letters to the Editor of the Times, and the Daily Telegraph ; also to my own countrymen in London and Bombay. Copies of some of these were also furnished to an English daily Indian paper (the \" Bombay Gazette \"). In these I essayed to clear the situa- tion caused by the delusion anglais. It was indeed of the nature of a politic-al delusion, which led Englishmen and others on the continent to call me Dhuleep Singh, Tippoo Saheb, Fenian, and a bold beggar ; to magnify me to such an extent as to command the attention or notice of everybody. Directly after my first letter to the English Times dated Sept. 13th, the Poli-comedie join' par nos voisins began to assume a different phase. When I entered Paris it was my White Babies \u2014 les anglais, who ran me down, and their pursuit of me was directed with the sole end and pur- pose of chasiug me out of Paris and driving me to London, their own city, or if I did not care to go there, to retrace my steps to the Giant's Asiatic boutique. For evident reasons the \"White Giant and his babies would not have me here again as a critic and act comme lejournaliste in the very city where I had scratched him very severely in the face in 1880-81. Most of the scratching then given by me was not at all equal both in quality or quantity, to what he is accustomed to get from the Brahmin and Babu poli- comedians of the cities of India. Though feeble, its effects were severely felt, as it touched our John Bull's sensitive points ; his wrong ends. Smarting under the recollection of this, he naturally was afraid now, and thought the scratching might be repeated this time with double force and greater knowledge. In 1880-81 our John Bull's India was not at all agitated with such"], [298, "280 extensive political movements aud demonstrations, as are now made, every year since 1884, by the Hindoo Congress-men, India was just then trying to define her \" scientific frontier,\" the Russian scare was not then started, as it was after the Penjdeh skirmish. In short, the reins of governing this coun try of the Hindoos had not, up till then, gone into the hands of a man, whose experience of India and the Indians was nil, but whose knowledge of Russia and the Russians was extensive, and somew-hat intimate, owing to his having served iu the Russian court, as the political resident representative of our John Bull. What a failure his government of India was, will easily appear to any unbiassed reader of his own speeches at the Clubs Anglais, of Calcutta and Bombay. Plow over-sensitive and intolerant to criticism of his Hindoo subjects, this our old consul was, even when he was actually presiding and ruling over these vast uncivilized parts of vegetarian Asia, is apparent from his public speeches, addresses, and his own declarations. When such a sensitive and intolerant brain happens to be in charge of les affaires etrungires of our John Bull in some country of Europe, where the Indian Fenian was to disembark, it is no wonder that he should be the first person to advise the foreign office to take active and crushing steps to chase away such a dangerous man, lest he may dangerously infect the foreign powers, and put in jeopardy (!) the foreign relations of our White Giant's Asiatic shop. To his great comfort this old consul, for he is now 65 years old, found at the Foreign Office another unaccredited political hero \u2014 one of the babies of our White Giant, who once wanted to alter people's time and clocks according to his own whim and fancy and against their wishes. So with the aid of two such specimens of living magnates, my White Giant was made to move the machinery of les bureaux des affaires etrangeres to chase out the Indian Fenian, the detes table person or drole out of all foreign ports and places. Senile efforts conceived by senile brains can never achieve uccess, and such was the case. For, the Indian Fenian had"], [299, "281 managed, in the teeth of a crushing opposition, to visit what ever foreign countries, and to see whatever foreign people, he wanted or was desirous of seeing. He had now arrived at a city the birthplace to him of \"Fenian\" ideas, the city which had estranged him from his love of his patron et maitre, the city which showed him in reality what sort of potent force the government of a nation by itself is, and which made him com pare and contrast his own position of a \" slave \" in the country of the Hindoos. ' It was in this very city he had to face the brunt of the delusion anglais to its highest possible extent, and when tired of tolerating it any more, he thought of appealing to the nation's representative and the nation's feeler, the English Times. While doing so he was obliged to lay bare the whole Poli-comedie plot and to trace ittoits origin in 1881. In de monstrating to our \"White Giant's babies, how the delusion anglais originated from the Ecole de Medecine Quartier in that year, he ran certain risks. What those risks were and how he had to combat them, I'll now try to delineate. \"Aux grands maux les grands remedes.\" The cut-throats exposed. \u2014 Between September 12th and September 26th, our Poli- comedie victim was too busy in Paris in writing out his own briefs, his defence, or as an Anglais on the Douvre-Ostende boat remarked his confessions ( Vide Poli-comedie Song No. 43 quoted* below), and despatched them from Paris to the Printing House Square of my White Giant. These letters of defence, these confessions naturally (as they ought to) incriminated my theatrical man of the Ecole de Medecine. In a letter posted to one of the babies of the Giant in Bombay, I wrote, saying \"All this mischief has given me an extensive insight into life in Europe, about which I intend jotting a regular book directly I find time and ease to do it. To me it could not do much harm ; for I knew its true origin, its methods of work and its march or progress ; and all along I have been making a comparison and * \"When she found she can't get bade, she made her will, calle i a priest aud began to make her confession.\""], [300, "282 contrast between the Mohamedan or Anti-Parsee Eliots of Bombay (1874-75). excited by a Parsee's translation of an English book ou the life of Mohamed, and this what 1 call Anti- Viccaji Riot or Anti-Indian Riot, the originator of which was the Dreyfous These, and which commenced in the Quartier Latin and from its home here found its way to London then. Ever since my departure for Bombay in 1881, it lay dormant and broke afresh, with full force and energy, the moment I set my foot on the European continent again, after some 10 years. But it is for your countrymen, both in Europe and India too, to look this matter full iu the face, seriously and searchingly, and to find out how it conies to pass from trivial causes, you could so easily be sold or duped by your veiy neighbours, who owe not a little of their past aud present prosperity to the bieiu-eillance of the \" tres riches rt tres aimables Anglais.\" Long before I wrote so, I even despatched a tele- gram* to Bombay, calling for some copies of my French These to be forwarded to London. I know what an amount of irrita- tion this telegram, as well as letters containing my defence or \" confession \" had set up in the minds of my theatrical profes- seur of the Ecole de Medecine Quartier. In his professional capacity he is in close touch, far closer than the members of any of the other learned professions, with the people at large ; and it was no wonder to me to receive kicks from the pupils, friends and colleagues of the very meu who had set the ball rolling in 1881. (For more informatian on this matter, see extracts from some of my Paris letters printed in the Appendix). From the 14th Septsmber I used to post, almost every day, one or two letters to friends and others in England and India. The same \"ficelles du metier \" which drew out my White Babies on board the ship in the Indian Ocean, served equally well for mes amis anciens du Quartier Latin. Many a time I would go to the bureau de poste in the Boulevard St. Germain, * Copy of telegram, dated Paris, 29th September 1890 to the Tourist's home, Bombay\u2014\" Post London few copies ot\" my French Thesis.\""], [301, "283 opposite to the Ecole, aud hand personally for registration or chargement all my letters, just to show them what sweet pancakes, les gateaux de Riz Indien, I have prepared for my cut-throats. At times, if too late, I would go to the bureau centrale. Rue du Louvre, and very often I used to get as an expediteur, a Bulletin de depot from the bureau at the Avenue de l'Opera, through which avenue I had to pass every evening on my way to the Diner Europeen, or Bouillon Parisien, or Bouillon Duval. Before I could finish my dinner at any of these places, I had to bear almost every evening from the 14th to 26th September, an angry stare, a threatening look and a face full of hatred and vengeance from many a man, whom I was not in a position to identify, as coming from the Quartier de l'Ecole of my theatrical man, or from the salle de clinique of the Jewish professeur of the Ecole de Medecine who had actually started originally the \"sou \" trick and set the ball rolling, on a Sunday morning in January or February 1881. Whoever these men may be, it mattered not for me to know, so long as they were not the men belonging to my White Giant's maison, not the countrymen of my \" maitre et patron,\" les Chapeaux Anglais. The Poli- Comedians change ranks in Paris. \u2014 In fact the Poli comedie actors had changed fronts, my greenhorn of a John Bull receded his steps ; aud his place (in Paris) was gradually taken up by my theatrical man. At the Cafe Splendid in boule vard Montmartre, I had (on the 15th Sept.) to shut up the steam of a vendor of what I have called in my letters to my friends, \" the article de Paris \" or the \"plat (lit jour,\" to which I was very miserably treated in 1881 by my Ecole friends, by some such words as these, noted in my Diary notes for that day. \"At home till 12 o'clock. Diner Europeen for breakfast and then to Cafe Splendid (Glass Dome cafe) where a fat man began his sou trick directly he saw me seated close to his table. When I could no longer bear him, I called the garcon and asked him Ou est le petit sou, qui on a envoye des hides pour amuses"], [302, "284 les cochons laches, les mendian/s? This had a very caustic effect, Iu the evening, when passing this very cafe, what sorry and vindictive looks for me to face ! \" On the 17th when I was in a boat, seeing the Drainage works of Paris, I met two Englishmen, with whom I cl and conversed. Notwithstanding their presence close to me, there were feeble attempts made to offer for sale the \" Articles de Paris,\" and I used to notice the men in charge of the boat frequently cry out \"On va le chauffer maintenant; chauffez pas; laissez le tranquil. \" In my 1'aris Diary I have noted many such instances of Chauffage. One of the most amusing of such sort of shocks I had to witness and to ward off, was during my journey to what the French Tourist's Agent called le plus beau et le pittoresque particle notre pays, Compiegne et Pierrefonds. I am unwilling to trespass on the patience of the reader with dwelling on this my journey to these places, where I had been to spend my Sunday, September 28th. As I mean to note this my journey to one ofthe \" plus beau\" suburbs of Paris in my intended publica tion \u2014 How to see and what to see in Europe, it is useless here to go deeply into it. Suffice it to record that in the train [I was in the 1st class, having paid 18 frs. for a dejeuner and a diner avec une demi - bout eille de vin, and the railway and diligence fare] at the breakfast table, in the diligence or the Four-in-hand coach and during the return journey from Pierrefonds to Paris, there was any amount of chauffage from both male and female passengers. To this I gave a couple of silent but strong kicks, the effect of which was to draw out my impulsive man of the stage into a threatening language, saying, \" il faut I'assassiner ; demandez sa carte ; il ne connais pas qu'est ce que doit-etre arrive d Londres; il a peur de rien ;...quelle brouillard ; tous ours la parapluie la bas.\" From the 14th September, on the morning of which I had despatched my first letter, to the London Times, my Professor Benjamin Anger made himself scarce, and never cared at all to"], [303, "285 show his face at the table d'hote, of Hotel de France et Lorraine where I had lodged at his own special recommendation. It was in that very letter that I had for the first time referred to his comique nomenclature of this mischief as the \"Poli-come die Anglaise.\" I am sure his colleas-ues and others, watching this Poli-comedie Anglaise with a view to guard the interests of their own Ecole, thought it proper to separate this my only \" ami et confrere.\" From the language of my letters and the tone of defense I had attempted, they soon saw that he had betrayed them, and not at all pushed forward their interest as the trusted amis et chers voisins of their rivals, on the other side of the channel. From that date down to the day of my departure for London, I never saw this bienveillant Francais, the globetrotter, and a member of the Club Anglais, of Boulevard de la Madeleine. I several times enquired of my Hotel proprietor, as to the whereabouts of this my Professeur. He had already demenage from 14, Rue du General Foy or was about to do so ; and the only address I could learn of his from his friend, one Henri de Montessus de Ballore was, that if I wanted to see him I must call on him any evening at the Club Anglais, the locality of which he had also indicated to me. This Monsieur Henri de Montessus de Ballore was a tenant in the same Hotel with me ; he graced the hotel restaurant every morning at dejeuner and was punctually to be found at the table d'hote, to enjoy its splendid (?) dinners for trois francs cinquante. Ever since I began to distrust my Benjamin, my only disinterested guide, philosophe and friend in Paris, I was daily seeking an opportunity of cutting this man off. For this reason I was too glad to forego my hotel dinners for 3'50 frs. and dine at Duval's or at the Bouillon Parisian for 2-25 to '2-50 frs. enjoying the sight of the kaleidoscopic monde of Paris, instead of the familiar faces of senators, deputies and savants, whom Dr. Anger said I should meet at the table d'hote, and to whom he had promised to introduce me. At the sight of un drole d' homme, le chien enrage, it is possible these senators"], [304, "286 and deputies and savants were seared away from the table. although the \"Americains\" and somo other tourists, ladies and gentlemen, continued to grace the table. In Dr. Anger's friend, Monsieur Henri de Ballore, I found a man who was very fond of spending his evenings with me, after diuner, and who would much prefer my going with him to the Moutagnes Russes, or the Cafe Romaiu or late at night tothe Cafe Napoli tan's Salon de societc than to any theatre. When I once ex pressed to him my intention of purchasing a home telephone, electric bolls and batteries, he said he was an electrician himself and would show me a fabricant, une maison dr confianet he knew, where I could get such articles, good, reliable and at their fair value. But hardly was I three evenings in company with this friend of my disinterested ami et confrere, I felt myself so very much ashamed to be seen with him any more on the grand Boulevards or its Cafes, that I always avoided him and his society, though in common courtesy I was bound to salute him or to return his salutes. Thanks to my \" patron et maitre,\" for thus throwing me in the arms of a man, in whose society I was obliged to part with my hard-earned Indian gold, with considerable reluctance and many curses to the White Giant's grand babies of the White Hall Castle. Period of lucid interval in the Giant's delusion. \u2014 My Professeur libra too I had no more seen. Beyond my arrest at the Long champs race oval and immediate release, in some 2 or 3 minutes, nothing befell me, to make use of his address in the Pyrenees (56, Rue Gassies a Pau, B. Pyrennes). Here I cannot help but record my thanks to my White Giant, for having changed his role in this Poli-comedie Anglais. From the time my letter headed \"Boycotting of a Native of India in Europe\" was penned and despatched to the London Times, although the letter was not published by the Editor, still in his own quiet way he had secretly castigated the Giant's grand babies residing in his White Hall Castle, and all his other little babies of both sexes living on the Continent, that I found their aggressive attitude"], [305, "287 had ceased. No more did I find my greenhorn in the role of persecutor. On the contrary, ho had to play now the part of a protector of his own Sovereign's subject ; beg your pardon, my patient reader, nay, the subject of her Viceroy and \" our menial, our servant,\" coming from a disarmed and therefore timid country where the military spirit is thoroughly crushed and gone. Were I to ride on the top of an omnibus, an Englishman would come and sit by my side ; were I to dine at Duval's or any such public restaurant, either un Anglais or une Anglaise was sure to be near me on a table close by ; in a theatre or Cafe or dancing saloon he would not lose sight of me. In fact he saw a little bit below the surface, by my own individual efforts to clear his delusion. To verify this change of feeling in our White Giant's babies living and moving in Paris, I purposely joined a reading room and library situated in the Rue de Rivoli (Neale's Library), just a week before I left for London. I had paid my week's subscription in advance, 3 frs. for the week ending 29th September, and kept going',there at all hours, morning er after noon, during the tea time especially, when I was sure of meet ing many respectable Englishmen and Englishwomen. I soon saw there that the fanatic chase had all subsided, but there was that passive hatred or dislike of me. This change of front here, in an English reading room, installed by an English book-keeper on the entresol above his shop rooms, may be due partly to a telegram* I had despatched to Bombay, expressing my intention of going to London next month. For, all my White Giant's object in continuing his game of persecution, after I had completed my tour in Germany and Russia and entered Paris (for en joyment and amusement) was to chase me out of it. Such his wish was now on the point of being fulfilled. He had judged rightly that it was owing to my association with the French * Telegram to Bombay, after the receipt by wire of a remittance demanded. \" Thanks. Going Loudon October.\" 19"], [306, "288 students in Paris, that had led me to pose as au Anti- Anglais, in that city during the year of the Afghan war (1880-81) ; and he thought it to be impolitic to permit au Indian of my antecedents to revisit that city again. Seeing that he could not chase me out of Paris, after I entered it, and that any further perseverance with his wild chase of me in that cosmopolitan capital, would be simply making of himself a laughing stock in the eyes of many (who had rightly judged upon the whole affair as a regular Poli-comedie), my greenhorns ceased their tactics. This they did of their own accord or were perhaps led to it, by my unpublished letters to the Times and others. For in these letters I had distinctly complained to the Editor, that seeing the fanatic temper of his countrymen in Paris (during the first week of my entry there) I was obliged to postpone my intended trip to London. They knew that were they to per severe yet in their wild chase, I should not go at all to London, where they wished that I shotdd go (vide Poli-comedie song No. 19, \"On va l'envoyer a, Londres.\") Reconsideration ofthe Tourist's decision not to go to London; his final resolve logo there: \u2014 In fact, directly I saw the rage Anglais abate, I reconsidered my decision formed in Warsaw after the poli-comedie scene (alluded to on page 237) of not at all setting my foot any more in a city, of which not only I, but my father and brother and others of my countrymen had very bitter experience. I had resolved now to go there and I should have gone much earlier than I did, had my remit tance from Bombay been received by wire. It arrived on the 23rd, and I at once decided to quit Paris for London. I should have even quitted it that very evening, but as I was not to revisit Paris on my return journey, I preferred staying there till the end of September, and fixed October 1st or October 2nd, as the date of my departure from Paris. Sorting the chaff from the wheat. \u2014 To demonstrate my hatred or dislike of the Ecole de Medecine man, who I was sure was the principal agent to put me in such a bad odour with"], [307, "289 my \"maitre et patron,\" the English, I carefully avoided calling on many of my former professeurs, and some agreges et internes des hopitaux, whom I had known during my student days. Neither did I care to visit any of the hospitals nor even the newly built Ecole in the Boulevard St. Germain. Only once, with two American Doctors (Dr. Sam. E. Wood, Louisville, Kentucky, and Dr. William F. Holt, Macon Ga. U. S. A.) whom I accidentally met at the Pasteur Institute one morning, did I call at the Muse'e Orfila and Musee Dupuytren and took them the round of the old Ecole de Medecine anatomical collection. Both Dr. Anger and his friend the Greek Doctor had frequently urged me \"allez aux hopitaux,\" but invariably I excused myself for want of time. The double dealing of my confrere upon whom I relied most ; the anticipation of another favourite professor of mine, the professeur libre who gave me his address out of Paris ; the cold reception of me by another professor upon whom I had called at his house, 38, Avenue Montaine ; and the language and behaviour of the visitors at the Quartier Latin cafes and restaurants, \u2014 all these encouraged me in my resolution, no more to ally myself with a set of men, a majority of whom wanted to encourage the deluded Anglais in persecuting me or run ning me down, and to pose at the same time, with a guilty con science, as their friends and well-wishers. I knew I was not justified in not calling upon such men as Professors Charcot, Hardy, Pean, Lancereaux, Le Fort, Duplay, Farab\u0153uf, Jac coud, Guyon, Richet, Potain, Pannas, Fournier, Bouchardat and many others, \u2014 all very good and honest gentlemen, and in whose salles des cliniques I had often heard very interesting and learned discourses. I would here record my apology to these and many other gentlemen of Paris, and take this opportunity of assuring them, that I'll ever in my life and conversation show myself worthy of the high honour conferred on me, by adniit tino- me on the roll as their confrere. I know to this day how much I owe to their bienveillance and more especially that of the late Professor Vulpian, in succeeding to get through my"], [308, "290 grade dr Doctorat of the Faculte, so quickly as within 18 months of my enrolment on the Ecole register. If I had a reason or a cause to look down with contempt upon such of their colleagues and aides, who started the \" sou trick \" and set the ball rolling to chase an unpleasant oriental out of tho Quar tier, that was no reason why I should not be able to recognise the chaff from the wheat. For presenting a These which was entirely got up from Eng lish monographs and dedicating it also to an English phy sician, Dr. Taylor, Dean of Guy's Hospital (whose clinique I had attended when in London in 1879), and wherein it was frankly acknowledged that in none of the works of the living French authors, such as Jaccoud and Grisolle, was to be found any information on the subject-matter of the These, \u2014 I knew well how unconsciously I became an unpleasant man with men of the stamp and calibre of mind of Professor Benjamin Ball and Monsieur Berger, the agrege at the time to the late Profes sor Gosselin. I have already referred to the way in which the said Professor of the Ecole, (an Anglais by birth but now naturalised as a republican Francais) had behaved with me, in one of my letters, styled \"Below the surface,\" (vide Appendix C). I see no necessity of going deeper into that matter again. I would however ask of the many learned savants and representative men of the Ecole de Medecine, Paris, to accept this my apology, for any slight they may fancy I had given them, in not visiting their settles des cliniques. It was simply owing to the circumstance, that some of their own confreres, colleagues and others had been fanning the flame of delusion Anglais (originally instilled into the minds of their neighbours by themselves), that I was forced to keep myself aloof and not to mix with them, in the lecture rooms or Hos pital wards or even in the Quartier Latin cafes and restaurants. Hence it was that I could not revisit many of my above named respected maitres dans les Hopitaux de Paris. I hope the many expressions of regret I here record will be accepted and received"], [309, "291 by them in the same forgiving spirit, which characterises the free and frank nation Frangais, aud the veritable Parisien. My Jewish Tripod. \u2014 When I returned to India in April 1881, I had not the remotest idea that the mischief then started by such men as Ball and Berger could, at this distance of time, have gone to the extreme of my being suspected as a Fenian or Irish by the English ; suspected by the Germans to be a Francais at heart and in my taste and inclinations, and by some of the unthinking French as the Allemand or Alsaeien, and that therefore il fa ut famais avoir confiance sur lui (vide Poli-comedie song No 13 pp. 14). Another droll aspect of this Poli-comedie Anglaise is that the three men, owing to whose action or relationship with me, three different nationalities of Europe were fastened on me \u2014 an Asiatic and a true blue blooded Parsee of Bombay, are all Jews (European Jews) and not Christians. When I was in the service of the Government of Bombay as their Assistant Chemical Examiner, my own superior officer happened to be a Jew \u2014 Isidore Bernadotte Lyon. I know how very much my resignation of Government service in June 1879 is to be attributed to his insupport able hauteur and jealousy. I know how he had once declared to me his jealousy at my getting F. I. C. (Fellowship of the Institute of Chemistry, London) by upbraiding me \"why didn't you tell me you had applied for it; you stole a march on me /\" My These writer was also a Jew \u2014 Monsieur le Dr. Dreyfous ; and my Poli-comedian in Paris in 1881 was also a Jew \u2014 Professor Benjamin Ball, and whose place this time was taken up in his absence from Paris by another of his sect, Professor Benjamin Anger. All these members of my Jewish Tripod, belong to a race of men known in Europe as the wearers of the three-cornered hat;\u2014 so I was informed by my belovedProfessor John Henry Sylvester, Surgeon-Major, Indian Army, (Retired List) years ago when he was in Bombay. Departure for London, October 2nd : \u2014 For three or four days before my departure for London, I know how I was"], [310, "292 intimidated by many, in the cafes and even in my own hotel (Hotel de Russie, Bd. des Italiens, where I had shifted from the Hotel of Dr. Anger's choice) some preached into my ears \" il ne connait pas qu'est ce que c'est doit-Hire arrive d Londres\" Its madame la proprietaire did once remark, while we were at dejeuner a day before my quitting Paris, \"il ira en voiture spccialc\" and that a special cab will be ready for him in London. I knew how to interpret such language ; and punctually on the day I had appointed, I left Paris for London by the morning mail, leaving the Gare du Nord at 8 o'clock. Before quitting I desired to say my bonjour to Monsieur le proprietaire, who the concierge told me would come down presently. After waiting forsome five minutes, I caused the concierge to speak through the pneumatic tube and asked, if Monsieur le proprietaire, ( Monsieur Riguelle fits) was likely to come down. But he said in reply, ho was was not likely to get out for half an hour more. This was the only exceptional occasion, when I had to leave this my favourite Hotel, my maison de confiance, without personally wishing goodbye to its proprietor. For I recollect how invariably the old proprietor, Monsieur Riguclle, or in his absence Madame Riguelle, the father and mother of the present proprietor, would make it a point to say ban voyage and au revoir with an endearing smiling look, any time I had to leave the Hotel for England in 1875-76 or in 1880-81. If I missed this the only and the first time a similar smiling look from his son and daughter, I knew how to account for it. I suspect the Monsieur Riguelle junior anticipated a storm might burst, like the one the Captain of the S. S. Sachsen, speaking to a passenger close to him on the night of the Fancy Dress Ball, said he expected would burst in Colombo (vide Poli-comedie song No. 52, pp. 22). The concierge herself who had the impudence to designate me drole, &c, on the very first night of my entry in her hotel, excused her master's absence, saying that they all expected me to return to their Hotel and to their Paris, on my way home to India. But I at once"], [311, "293 assured her that that was going to be my final visit, and that she will not see me any more iu Paris, impressing my resolu tion by adding the words \"c'est fini.\" Ins ti tut Rudy. \u2014 Before leaving Paris I had spent there one of the pleasantest evenings with my old French Professor, Monsieur Charles Rudy and Madame Rudy. Both were kind enough to accept my invitation to dinner, and my object in noticing it here is to record one of the most interesting sou venirs of my life in Paris on 30th September 1890. To the Indian tourist wishing to study les langues vivants of Europe, I would confidently recommend Institut Rudy, established by this enterprising American gentleman since 1860. A 3 or 4 months sejour in Paris, with a course of lessons from Institut Rudy, would soon enable an Indian tourist to pick up colloquial French or German or Russian with ease and facility, not to be had anywhere else outside this beautiful and charming city. Here to this Institut Rudy, ladies and gentlemen of all ages and all nationalities flock for learning French or German or Russian or any other living languages of Europe, and even the Chinese. Professor Rudy is the author of the Chinese Ollendorff and himself undertakes the teaching of the Chinese language. ENGLAND. Une escorte d'honneur: \u2014 From Paris to Amiens I was the only passenger iu my 1st class compartment and another broad shouldered big man, without any baggage at all (only a pardessus to cover his feet), who kept reading the Figaro. This passenger dropped at Amiens, and a tall spare man came and took his seat in my 1st class compartment, His hands were covered with the glove of a London Policeman, with a helmet on his head and a light -coloured drill or a drab khaki coat on his person. With him was a young lad barely 12, seated opposite to him. He carried some tartines and a demi-bouteille de vin"], [312, "294 rouge. When the ticket examiner came and asked him to show his ticket he said \"je suis abonni,n and presented instead B ticket for the young lad that was with him. He had no paper OJF books with him to read. He and the little boy ate what little food he had brought with him, and drank the wine out of the bottle that was with them. Before reaching Calais he was talking with the lad, saying a lot of things, from which I have selected a couple of his Poli-comedie songs, Nos. 27 and 28. Directly I heard him show himself as our White Baby's representative, I shifted my seat and sat vis-a-vis and tried to later him. He asked me something about the recent mutiny going on in India. I knew he was referring to the Goa Riots and could have set him right as to the actual locality of the riot, and to what other European Government it belonged. But as he had already betrayed himself by his Poli-comedie song No. 27 pp. 17 as to who he is and what function he had to fulfil in travelling with me without a regular ticket, I preferred to let him wade through his ignorance. A few more sentences exchanged with him enabled me soon to gangc his mental calibre and knowledge of India. I was also able there and then to see what made him take an interest in the system adopted by his own employers for governing India. I did not after that notice him at all. On the Dover-Calais boat he officiously kept himself before my eyes, when I took my chair and sat on the bridge deck among a lot of 1st class passengers. I quickly saw through the airs he had put on ; and how he wanted to draw me into conversation with him. To confirm me in my opinion of him as a Scotland Yard man, I may mention here another circum- stance, trifling in itself, but which was a very conclusive testi- mony to my estimate of the man. When he came on the deck inquiring after me, if I felt cold or if I felt sick, I noticed a regular wave of smiles passing on the lips of all the English passengers ladies and men of all ages seated close to me. Di- rectly after the landing pier was touched, I lost sight of the man."], [313, "295 Dover to London. \u2014 In the train I fell in conversation with a couple of English Ladies and a gentleman with a long beard, spare -bodied, but not of the usual John Bull abdominal type. It seemed strange to me when this gentleman began to question me, as to what sort of annoyance I had in Berlin from the Police there ? What about my journey in Russia? While dwelling on my Russian tour, I expressed to him my im pressions, as to how suspicious a Russian is of foreigners travelling in his country, and also hinted my suspicious that in Moscow and Varsovie, an attempt might have been made \" to read the book\" andto see through my inside. For I was already given a character by my Poli- comedian the Giant, which had magnified me at a stroke into another Dhuleep Singh, and at another classed me with entertaining feelings of fraternity with the Nihilist and Socialist class of that vast country. To my great amusement this, my White Baby, in my White Giant's own island said, \"In Russia they are up to that sort of work, and that he should not be surprised if they had done it.\" Tourist conceals his plan of campaign to be adopted in the White Giant's home. \u2014 I at once changed the conversation, lest I might in an unguarded moment hint at the way I used to draw out my theatrical man, and which method I was bent upon tr3Ting in our White Giant's own island. I need not here dwell at length upon it now, after delineating it so fully in my narrative of return journey, published as the 1st fascicule of this Looking-Glass for my Poli-comedie actors in Em-ope. The Poli-comedie song No. 39 pp. 19, where Mr. N of 146, Wool Exchange, E.C. said in reply, \" you will presently know it,\" refers to this very kind of dirty act. In reply to his country man standing close to the door and facing me, who said \" they are all hard up, tired of waiting,\" Mr. N advised them to keep patience and to wait till the despatch is finished and properly stamped and put in the Red Pillar Box, in the passage leading from the Wool Exchange to the street."], [314, "296 My reading of Victor Hugo's Histoire d'un Crime and my knowledge of the Giant's treatment of his own political prisoners bad actually prepared me, to expect that sort of work from my Poli-comedie actors. My persecutor the White Giant I knew was impelled by pure delusion, due to a sort of political irritation and he thought for some unknown \" political reasons,\" he was justified in demanding from the powers in friendly terms with him a search of my \" despatches \" and \"lecture notes,\" to judge for himself what sort of \"arsenic is contained in the paint\" and how much of it is forwarded to India, and to its simple child-like people. When the victim of his delusion was in his own Giant London and in his ever green island, he thought himself master of the situation, and did all he could to keep the tourist in a glass-house. I knew from the moment I set my foot on the Dover pier (October 2nd) to go to London, till I finally left it (October 24th), how I was watched and my face scanned by every one of his babies, learned and unlearned, the high and the low, the polished and the rough, of both sexes and of all ages. I knew I was all the while unnecessarily magnified by some deluded baby or babies of the Giant, holding office in his White Hall. The two principal Poli-comedie directors identified. \u2014 Who they are and what they are, it was not possible for me to spot exactly, but after all I had this gratification to learn from the mouths of his own sensible and thinking babies \u2014 les hommes serieux, that one of these deluded babies, Sir Mad Hour, was then living in the Giant's White Hall castle. The other, Madame McDuff of Canadian Burma, owing to her advanced age, is unable to withstand the severe winter, the snows and frost of the ever-foggy London, and prefers to live on the continent. I may have a chance of visiting her, they said, should I pass through \" the city of churches and popes,\" on my way back to India. The thinking, frank, honest types of our John Bull, who had the candour to point out to me these two principal baby directors of our White Giant, also assured me, that if I chose I"], [315, "297 could call on Sir Mad Hour sans faeon, on my return to London from Scotland. My honest and candid informants felt certain that a short pourparler with him, in his own chamber at White Hall, would clear the situation at once. I thankfully declined the task. I had done already what I could, and to do which had cost me not only a lot of trouble and time, but which sort of work marred considerably my enjoyment in the only city of Europe, where enjoyment of life according to my own accepted standard and in unison with my thoughts and inclination was possible. I recollected how unwilling this baby, Sir Mad Hour, once was when he was starring as a satrap in India, to grant me a personal interview on some official matter. I did not like to press any more my own personal grievance to his notice at the time ; afflicted as he was with an untoward domestic bereave ment. Tourist's show before the Londoners and the Sensation he created everywhere. \u2014 In proof of what I have recorded here in this Looking Glass, I would simply leave it to my Giant's own conscience and his own knowledge to recall what sensation my entry had created in London, wherever I moved, in the city \u2014 on the top of an omnibus, in the Crystal Palace, theatres and even in the dining and reading room of the Grand Hotel I was in. I am sure this is the only instance within my knowledge where an obscure native of India like me had been magnified by the English residents of London and the continent into a great politician, another Dhuleep Singh and a Tippoo Sahib, or a Fenian, and to chase out whom all sort of drole but vicious devices were adopted. In short it was a moral disease infecting all the Babies of the White Giant and through them their friends, sympathisers and supporters in Europe. The only way to control such moral disease is exposure. To expose the true facts and to lay bare before the nation all the circumstances which led to the delusion anglais and its strange consequences requires courage and a presence of mind, which only a man with a well balanced mind can command. Courage to disarm the opposition from the Poli-"], [316, "298 comedians themselves, for it is their wrong ends 01 sensitive points I have tapped. Presence of mind to face their wild tricks, to mark me down and to maliciously paint me in order that they, the Poli-comedians, may succeed in hushing up this ugly blunder for ever, from the gaze of the honest and sensible men, their own countrymen in England as well as then fellow-subjects in India. \"Je vous serre la main cordialement.\" \u2014 With a view to keep myself in touch with intelligent Englishmen and to feel their pulse, or, as remarked by one of them, to be hand and glove with them, I shifted my residence from 0, Elgin Road, Upper Norwood, to the very heart of London, Grand Hotel, Trafalgar Square. Here I was able to gauge the feeling and temper of my White Giant's babies, with whom I was moving shoulder to shoulder, and in whose constant sight I was. What struck me most was that at no time did I find as now, my \" Time-is nioney\" man so communicative, so eager to talk and to ex change opinions with me ; so very affable as to respond to all my inquiries as to sight-seeing in London or out of it. I should indeed be wanting in gratitude were I to withhold my thanks to him for guarding me, both my person and my purse, in his own city. I everywhere noticsd his commercial honesty, and'whether in a restaurant or on a tram-car or in a public place of amusement, or in a shop, making parchases, I had invariably to pay the same price as any of the Englishmen would. There was no exaction, no attempt to impose and to deceive tin etrangcr and an unpleasant marked man as I was. I felt that after all, my John Bull, if he has fallen in my estimation in other respects, still had traits in his character which led me to admire him and to account for his prosperity as a leading Nation of Europe. In his capacity of John Bull, the Emperor of the Hindoos I had known him ever since my boyhood. His Empire of India, I have run over throughout its length and breadth from Kashmir to Tuticorin, and Darjecling to Kurrachee. I know in what sort of political and"], [317, "299 social relations our John Bull as the Emperor of the Hindoos stands with the educated section of natives of India. Had I but stayod in England a couple of months longer I should have given him a bit of my experience, gathered during my frequent travels in all parts of India, and derived from my past intimato association with the educated Brahmin class. If I failed to do that sort of servioe to him, my John Bull of sea girt isle, I mean especialy the Englishman of London and tho Continent must thank himself for it. For with all his affable ness, all the little acts of kindness shown to me by him, my greenhorn would, by his delusive impulses run me down off and on, even when I was in his own house. To chase me out of Europe and to send me back to India as early as possible was his real game. This his intention was already foreshadowed to me by one of his own employes (The Scotland yard man) in the train from Amiens to Calais on my way to London Oct. 2nd (Vide Poli-comedie song No. 27, pp. 17). I was not surprised, therefore, to find during my short stay in London (October 2-10 and October 20-24), every one of my green horns acting or behaving with me as directed and dictated by the White Hall Baby, Sir Mad Hour. On the very first day of my entry in a dining room of London (Gatti's Restaurant) I was quietly hearing a waiter, singing in my presence and close to me his Poli-comedie song (No. 30 pp. 17) in reply to a request from a respectable passenger, seated at a table close 'to me, to run me down and to mark me or to put some new mark on me. The few select Poli-comedie English songs given at pages 12-22 are enough of themselves to give the reader an idea of the sort of kind and polite treatment, I must have received from the countrymen of the rulers of the country of the Hindoos. I must content myself with a bare recital of tangible facts which is easy for any one to do. For, it is indeed difficult to transfer one's impressions, especially to my countrymen situated at such a great distance from the White Giant's home, and who only know or can known, the Babies he"], [318, "300 sends out to rale over them only from their ruling or govern ing side aud no more. The Poli-comedie show sent to the Caledonian Castle. \u2014 Yar all the time I was out of London, from morning of October 1 1 to evening of October 20th, I was travelling in the White Giant's Caledonia. I had never before seen the capital city of Scotland in my previous tours. It was so much praised by many and to it my attention was also called at Wiesbaden while dining with an Englishman at the Hotel Weins (Vide Poli-comedie song No. 7, pp. 13). This time I was led to visit that city, for this reason that when in India I had read in the Dailg Telegraph a glowing and a graphic account of the Scotch Express travelling at the rate of some 60 miles an hour. I wanted to enjoy such a fast Railway ride. Secondly, in the Scientific Ame/ican and other papers I had seen an excellent illustration of one of the wonders of the modern age, the Great Steel- iron bridge on the Forth, 10 miles to the north of Edin burgh. I had planned this my visit to Scotland from Paris, where I got my letter of credit from the Credit Lyonnais made payable in Edinburgh also. At the recommendation of one of my pro fessors at Guy's (Mr. Bryant, the great surgeon of London) I had planned a tour across the Killicrankie pass to some of the Scotch lakes and thence to Glasgow. This I was obliged to give up. As it will be interesting for the reader to learn, how I came to give up my programme of tour, over that historic Highland pass, I'll now briefly proceed to describe it. My Lady guide, philosopher andfriendfn the Caledonian Alps. \u2014 My stay at Edinburgh lasted from Saturday evening, Oct. 11, to Tuesday noon, Oct. 14. I happened to pick up acquaintance while dining with two provincial Anglais, a lady and gentleman, living with me in Hotel Balmoral, Prince's Road. Both were very affable, very kind and sensible, \u2014 a true type of what I always understand the wellbred English gentleman and Eng lish lady to be. On the evening of Oct. 13th they asked me to what part of Scotland I was going and after expressing to"], [319, "301 me their intention of doing the Balmoral range, welcomed me to join their party. The very mention of the words Balmoral and Braemar induced me to give up my original programme and to join them. I was told I could go to the Killicrankie pass from Braemar as well, and where these two provincial Anglais, Mr. and Mrs. Middleton, intended to make a stay of some days before returning to their house in Leeds. I twigged the meaning of what my White Baby's tactics were, up here in Hotel Balmoral, Edinburgh, at a distance of 593 miles from his White Hall Castle. That I did actually smell the rat at the time, will appear from what I wrote to a friend on this matter. (Vide appendix No. 3 and 4, pp. 105-6). Of course I took good care not to betray ntyself on this point all the time I was in England. We left Edinburgh by 1.50 train and arrivedatAberdeenO.20. October 15th passed in Aberdeen, and on the 16th Thursday, left for Ballater by train (departure 12.20 ; arrival 3 o'clock P. M.) From this station in drenching rain and under a fierce cold wind we went by an omnibus, in which we were the only three passengers bound for Braemar, as the season had already closed or was closing. We arrived at Braemar at 6 o'clock P. m. The road from Ballater to Brae man, about 2 5 miles, passes all along the western and southern slope of the Balmoral ground of the Queen's summer residence going by that name. Scenery splendid and even at Brae mar (Duke of Fife's Estate) it was so entirely Himalayan and I was so charmed by it that I imagined I was in some part of Kashmir, in my own country, and not in what they call on the Continent \"pays du brouillard.\" \"They have given him up.\" No court-dress; can't be pre sented. \u2014 \"When I joined the two provincial anglais in their journey to Braemar, I was in exultation and began to compli ment the tall baby of White Hall, Sir Mad Hour, for arranging in his own surreptitious way for an exhibition or an exposition of the Indian Fenian and another Dhuleep Sing, at the Caledonian castle. But my hopes were much damped"], [320, "302 when I heard my Lady guide, philosopher and friend, at tho exit door of the Aberdeen Station telling her husband in a load audible tone (for her aged husband was a little deaf) \"They have given him up.\" Still pretending not to have noticed her warning bell, I suffered myself to be led by the nose by these two provincial anglais. The disgust with which my show iu Caledonia was looked upon will appear from the Poli-comcdio song (No. 37, pp, 18) which was sung by a thin, middle-aged man seated near the fire-side in the smoking room of the Im perial Hotel, Aberdeen, speaking to a friond opposite to him. He styled the exposition \"Lord Mayor's Show \"and I have in my Karten posted from board tho S. S. Sachsen, dated 31st Oc tober styled it \" Barnum's show.\" I think ho expressed frankly the feeling of every sensible and thinking Englishman, when he said \" Tinpot affair ; wish they had done with it.\" I too was sick of the exposition- made of me by my principal Poli comedian actors Sir Mad Hour of Westminster and his aide on the banks of the Tiber, Madame McDuff. Like all sensi ble and practical Englishmen, I too was quito sick of the fuss and magnifying process to which I was subjected, simply out of pure delusion. At Braemar we spent two nights, and next morning I was informed by my companions who liked to faire ses vohmles that the Hotel of Fife Arms was going to be closed ; no society for them to pass their time at Braemar, where they had informed me in Edinburgh they intended to spend about a fortnight, and they therefore wished to return to Aberdeen via Ballater \u2014 the same route we came by. Further, they said, if I wanted to stay here (at Braemar) it would be difficult for me to get back, as the Diligence service was going to be stopped ; and as the mail coaches to Killicrankie Pass had also ceased running, I had better go with them. The In dian chimpanzee, \" the nice precious thing to be guar ded, \" not being provided with a regular court-dress, I knew could not be presented ; and I had no resource"], [321, "303 left but to submit. We left Braemar at 10i- o'clock on Saturday morning the 17th Oct., arriving at Aberdeen via Ballater in time to catch the Great Western Express for London, which leaves Aberdeen at 8 o'clock p. m. Here my Lady guide, friend aud philosopher parted company, promising however to see me in London, where she was to be in a week's time. Just look at this and look at lhat. \u2014 Our return journey from Braemar was very auspicious. If nobody, at least nature was kind to me. Under a bright soft sun, we all three, with some other passengers, among whom one gentleman was a photographer, managed to ride on the top of the mail coach and thus obtain a good view of the hills studded with pines and ferns and of the rivulets round about the Queen's Bal moral Castle. My bienveillant companions, the Madame and Monsieur of Leeds, kept me cheerful all the way during our 18 miles of diligence ride, by constantly telling me just look at this and look at that, though not quite to the style they do while playing the comedy of Les Cloches de Corneville. The madame kept pointing to some statues in the Queen's garden or some lovely scene on the hills ; while her husband directed my attention to the Scotch whiskey casks, that were being driven by cartloads to the Castle. What a severe disappoint ment did I feel in not being able to obtain a sight or even a glimpse of the luckiest sovereign going on the face of the earth, I have expressed in my letters from Braemar and Birmingham to friends in India. Tourist returns to London via Birmingham :\u2014 From Aberdeen I booked direct to London and some time after the train started I expressed to the conductor of the train my intention of going to Birmingham. I had seen Manchester and Liverpool in my last tour, and this time I wanted to do Glasgow. But as I had given up my Killicrankic pass route and with it the city of Glasgow, I decided to spend a short time in a manufactur in\u00b0- citv of Eugland, I had not before seen, and which may be"], [322, "\u25a0;hi on my way to London. The guard recommended me to drop at Rugby junction and thence proceed to Birmingham. 1 arrived here at 10' a. m. How I spent my Sunday, and nearly the whole of Monday till 4 p. m. I prefer detailing elsewhere. Meanwhile I like to record here my testimony of the kindness 1 received from Mr. Charles Sims, Professor of Dental Surgery in Queen's College, Birmingham. One of the most pleasant evenings I ever spent in an English family by the fire-side on a Sunday evening was in Mr. Sims family house, where I had the pleasure of enjoying his hospitality. His portrait in the Nov. Number of \"Birmingham Faces aud Places\" keeps alive my visit to that great industrial town of England, where I am happy to say not a soul did ever care to notice me or to pa)' me the least attention. The \"nervous\" type is theprevailingtype of John Bull in Birmingham. And I naturally expected here to find practical men of tact, judgment and common sense. My expectations were amply verified. For not a man or woman did at all care to drop into my ears any abusive word or to stare at me with i look of disgust and hatred. I remember, one abdo- minal type of John Bull in Birmingham allude to mo as \"our clever young Mac\"! However that was somewhat of a \"polite\" compliment from the Babies of the White Giant. The calm or passive reception I had in my tour in Scotland aud in Birmingham, had induced me before arriving at London to think of arranging for prolonging my stay in the Giant's mansion there, \u2014 with what intention and object, I most refer the reader to my notes of October 20th, the day of my return to London, published in the first fascicule, page 23."], [323, ".(fVppe-ratlix A.

I prefer to call it pure simple delusion on the part of your countiymen in Europe, owing to which I \u2014 a nobody in Bombay, a mere small gnat, \u2014 am magnified here iu Europe into a person worthy of an exposition in the cities of Europe, and also worthy of being chased out of it and sent back to India as early as possible. I wish for the sake of the good name and reputation of your countrymen (out of India) you had the courage and indepen dence of an impartial journalist, to publish facts I have detailed in my letter, notwithstanding that your journal stands in the relation of a pure \" Official Organ \" to the authorities in England. You would then have rendered a service, not to me personally, but to your own countrymen, and helped me a great deal to dispel the delusion, \u2014 which evidently began from over sensitiveness to criticism, and gradually worked up its way into hatred of me, and hatred was transformed into delusion."], [324, "306 It is a pity that a journal of your standing aud reputation cannot look into this affair from all points, and prefer to view it from a selfish or personal aspect only.

Rest assured, Mr. Editor, that if even all the leading journals of the United Kingdom were to show a similar want of courage and independence as journalists, to publish unsavoury facts and choose lo suppress them, still I am not the person for all that to give up the struggle. For, I am 6ure there are other ways and means, still open to me as a subject of our Queen-Empress, though a native of India, to lay threadbare to their fullest possible extent this mischief, conceived by some deluded official in the India Office, and which the shrewd and far-seeing people of the continent of Europe, have justly set down for a \"Poli-comedie\" or \" comedie politique jouee par nos voisins.\" I cannot recall a single instance where a native of India, solitary and unprotected, and travelling for the sake of pleasure and knowledge in European countries, has been made the victim of a delusion, and subjected to a very shameful treat ment simply to chase him out of Europe. And if I fail at present to obtain justice from English Journalists in their own country, I am sure and morally certain that truth will triumph in the end, and that in no far distant time you, Mr. Editor, will see your mistake of trying to bury this ugly matter into the oblivion of the past from motives purely personal. I beg to remain, Sir, Your most obedient servant, K. R. VICCAJI, M. 1)."], [325, "307 B. To The Editor of the Times, London. Sir, \u2014 Pardon my troubling you once more. You are to me the only Englishman representative of the Press, who is in official touch with the authorities ; and I must naturally look to you for justice. I know not how to thank you, for the salutary effect my letters to you have produced in the temper of the English people here, although you have in your wise dis cretion judged it proper not to publish them. No longer any Englishman or Englishwoman now \"notices\" me; on the contrary their presence here in cafes or theatres is a check to others inclined to ran me down. I enclose for your own private perusal only a sac-simile copy of a letter headed \" Below the Surface,\" which I have drawn up for the information of my own friends and countrymen in Bombay and London. I have tried to trace therein the origin of this mischief to the time when the These or Essay on \" Phlehites Rhumatismales et Goutteuses \" was published (in December 1880 or later on). I can trace the irritation it then caused from the Students and Hospital Internes to the Professeurs here, and no further. For, I know what Professeur and can even name him, set the ball rolling, in these words: \u2014 \"je crois qu'il est sou; il voyage toujours,\" \u2014 said in my own presence (fancying I did not understand what was said) after a short clinical lecture in his Hospital to which I was especially invited by him, on a Sunday morning by appointment made three days previously. I remember perfectly well that time (February and March 1881) when everybody in the Ecole de Medecine Quartier was eager to chase me out of Paris ; and I am sure the Anti- Anglais pose fastened on me then was simul taneously conceived by the irritated men. To give vou an idea of the irritation that wretched little pamphlet (about a dozen copies of which are still with me in Bombay) caused in the minds of many oversensitive and"], [326, "308 imaginative professional men here, I may simply tell you that even the Printer to the Ecole dc Medecine would not print my title and address on the cover correctly. And my Bombay University Qualification of Licentiate of Medicine was so altered into \" Licenciee,\" as to mean that the writer of it was some female doctor. I had to get him to cancel the titlepage and the cover of some extra copies I had bought of him, and to reprint them correctly. I have not gone sufficiently deep in my letter, \" Below the Surface,\" especially as to the means adopted immediately after the These affair and after I wis declared qualified for the diplomi of Docteur en Medecine, to fasten on me the Anti-Anglais pose which would, as they then fancied, certainly induce, les Anglais to kill me (\" tueront \"). With my simple, frank and honest nature, I could not then at the time probe below the surface (as I could immediately after), and everything that glittered seemed gold to me then. Discretion bids me forbear, not to go deeper still. For, Mr. Editor, I am now moving in a city and among a people, in close touch with each other, and the reli gious tenet of some of whom (as I have learnt it to be iu my student days here) is \" Rien apres la mort.\" One word more and I am done. What strikes me as very strange, and what is very difficult for me to understand, is how a shrewd, calm and collected people, as your countrymen are always reputed to be, can so far lend their ears to mischievous men, -without proper enquiry ; and allow themselves to bo drifted into an awkward position. Had this mischief, originat ing in what I call the Dreyfous These and ending in an Anti- Anglais pose, \u2014 perhaps of the very worst type, secretly and maliciously fastened on me \u2014 been enquired into searchingly by the authorities in England, directly it came to their knowledge (in 1881), they would then have had lots of clues to trace it out to its true source and to satisfy themselves as to the actual extent to which it existed. For, I could then have furnished clear evidence as to the various means adopted, by both men and"], [327, "309 women surrounding me, to engraft on me an Anti-Anglais apron, \u2014 such as some anti-anglais songs put into my hands ; the Pantomime or caricatures Anglaises shown to me .* the Russians (students I fancy), I was introduced to in Cafes and who striking their breasts, would assure me \" C'est nous qui vous donnerons la liberte,\" \u2014 because we natives of India as they said often to me, were regular \" esclaves \" of the English, in short, to enfoncer dans ma te'te \" comment on halt les Anglais en Europe loujours.\" I fear all inquiry now (after some 10 years) in this direction, especially in a city and among a people united to a man under the banner of Egalite and Fraternise, will and must necessarily fail. Yours &c. K. R. VICCAJI. 5 Rue de Beaune, Paris. 25th September 1890. c. BEL 0 W THE S UREA CE. Hotel de France et de Lorraine, 5, Rue de Beaune, Paris, 24.A September 1890. My dear Dadabhai Bykamji, * * \u2022\u25a0- I should trace the mischief to the time (Nov. or Dec. 1880 or Jan. 1881) when I had to submit a The sis or Essay before receiving the Diplome of the Docteur en Medecine. This essay has a history of its own, and which I prefer telling you personally. Suffice it for you to learn now that I could not then, and even as yet cannot pen or write or speak correct French. I did as other foreigners here do, when they go in for their Diplome of Docteur, and my These or Essay I got written out by a French Doctor named Docteur Dreyfous. This man it seems wanted to kick at some living authors and"], [328, "310 professors, aud in afootnote iu the essay he wrote for me, he did give a severe kick to them. At the time I was passed and received as a Docteur, no notice was taken of this footnote. Neither my own examiners nor myself, had the least idea, that such an ugly interpretation would bo put upon that little Essay of about 20 pages, after it was published and circulated. I caunot here give you any idea of the irritation it caused among au unreasoning, vain and impulsive set of men \u2014 I meau the medical students, Hospital Iuternes and some Doctors here. And instead of avenging their anger ou the actual writer of the Thesis, and who was well known to them and to whom all knew I had paid 250 frs., they first began to kick me in their usual Parisian style. This is to chase a man out or to boycott him by setting him up as a drule or fool, or even asa sou or a mad cap. This \"article de Paris\" they found could not take root in me, and I knew well how in February and March 1881, when I was here, the representatives of these self-irritated men used to pass remarks on me, always taking their seat close to me in cafes and restaurants. Notwithstanding all their ceaseless aud loud talking and swearing at me, when they found me preserv ing my equanimity of temper and eating with an appetite, as sharp as usual, they would remark \"Monsieur comprends pas,\" meaning I don't understand the drift of their insulting remarks and so I don't at all feel the effects of their trick. Failing in this their attempt to chase me out of this place (then in Jan.- March 1881) they conceived of avery astute device, and a regular Poli-comedie plot was arranged for me. For they were constantly, anywhere and everywhere, asking me when I was going to London. The plot was simply to put me in bad odour wilh the English, whom they used to call my \"Masters,\" and I, i.e., all we natives of India, \"their slaves.\" I don't give you the French equivalents of these, as you will understand better in English. I was not aware of this plot until I landed in England, \u2014 I forget the exact date of March 1881, a little before my return to India and I knew well what a sensatiuu it had then caused, especially"], [329, "311 in London for a couple os days. But as I knew I was not guilty ofany Fenian-like act, I feared nothing. I made my necessary1 purchases in London (of books, instruments, etc.), and did even come back to Paris and spent about a week here. I still remember well how at the Ecole de Medecine, on seeing me again turn up, many were astonished, for they thought (as they ex pressed) the English would certainly kill me. From Paris I went to Marseilles. I little knew that I was there \" dogged \" or followed surreptitiously, just as I was from Paris to Bruxelles, and via Ostend to London in 1881. I was on board the S. S. Ava \u2014 Messageries Maritime, of course in a 3rd class (= 2nd P. ct 0. Line), and here unknown to me the \"Poli-comedie\" plot was worked. For I could then see clearly how at times it was worked openly on board the ship, and the Parisian speciality of the drole or sou trick, went on every now and then until I landed at Point de Galle. On board the Messageries ship, directly after we entered the Canal, I was threatened with serious consequences by a passenger, who travelled with me by express from either Paris or Lyon . I remember well what he told me about some telegram having gone to London about me. I never believed him, for I soon saw his dodge was to make me pay some 50 or 100 francs as a bribe or douceur to the garcon or steward of our 3rd class saloon, to eke out exact information from the stewards of the 1st class Saloon. Arrived at Suez just before sunset, and I know how he i.e. our steward and a few other passengers were eagerly looking towards the very first boat (Government boat I fancy) that was coming to us from Suez directly we anchored. I remember well how he, the passenger, and many others directly began to look small and I (to cut the matter short) quietly found my way to Bombay. Seeing that I had my Diplome, I was very unwilling that all this matter should see light or eke out. However I knew and did see some effects of this mischief in my journey from Ceylon, via Madras to Raichur ; mischief started from the Quartier,"], [330, "312 Latin of the Ecole de Medecine here followed me up. H very feebly and surreptitiously, as far asBouabay. I cared* itraw for it then, as I even now do.

In that Essay the authority of not one French living author was quoted, although lots of reference was made to the English literature existing on the subject. On the con trary in a small footnote a kick was given by its writer (Dr. Dreyfous) to the living French authors, by simply mentioning the names of their works, wherein he said (in a small footnote at page 8 or 12, I forget now ; the These is not with me now here) search was made for information on the subject of Gouty and Rheumatic Phlebitis. I remember very vividly up to this very day, how at the time (Febr. 1881) one ofthe Professors of Clinical Medicine \u2014Professor Simon, at the Hotel Dieu \u2014 criti cized severely the apathy of the French students iu not studying the language of their neighbours, and owing to which he observed, we (i.e., the French Medical profession) remain ignorant of what wares are manufactured in our neighbour's opposition shop. One good effect of that irritation (in Feb. 1881 when it was at its highest pitch) was to indirectly encourage the study of the English language on the part of the French students. For I saw then everywhere in the Quartier Latin placards notifying Instruction in Langue Anglaise. But how, from such a trivial cause, the India office people have allowed themselves to be duped through the agency of these very wire-pullers, as to put me on their black list ever since 1881, \u2014 it is a wonder to me. I have distinctly and with a clean breast stated in my letter to the Bombay Gazette and also to Mr. Dadabhai Naoroji, what I did, and what sort of political apron I had put on in 1880-81 when I was here in this very city; when my knowledge of French was very imperfect ; when my only companions were the Secretary to the Ecole de Medecine, Monsieur Pinet \u2014 now no longer in the Department ; retired or died I know not, \u2014 and a few, not even half a dozen medical students and a few cocottes. Does that at all justify my \" wife,\" to set the entire machinery of British"], [332, "314 residents and consulates in the cities of Europe at work, with one and the sole object, viz. \u2014 to chase me away back to India as early as possible ? Does that, I ask, justify her getting the Germans and the Russians and even the Americans to kick me in the Railways and the cities of Europe ? For this purpose the broom she handled was a stupid broom, quite fragile, like many other articles de Paris, and would soon tear and wear away. This you see has actually happened. For in the teeth of such a nasty broom I have faced exposition, which my wife wanted to make of me in all the cities of Europe I have visited. For I was sure truth shalt triumph in the ena, and that it was more her own exposition, she was making than mine ; and every kick given to me \u2014 of course at her bidding \u2014 was through me\u2014 (as the subject of her Government) a kick to her also. In her unconscious fit of delirium or delusion, she has, I know, kicked me much more than I deserved, more than what I could endure, and if I have resented (of course in my own feeble way) and tried to pay her off in her own coin, she has to thank nobody but herself for it. Her treatment was such as to soon make of me a true type of an Anti- Anglais which I was not all this time, *. .., up to the time of my landing in Europe. I begin now to see from the way she, \u00ab'. e. her relatives are receiving me here, that she sees, at least has begun to see her mistake. For no respectable Englishman now notices me oras they say \"faire I' attention,\" neither any respect able Frenchman. The presence of an Englishman now, in a cafe restaurant in my neighbourhood acts as a check to rabid Frenchmen, \u2014 especially to some illbred and conceited men of the Quartier de Ecole de Medicine, to \"prendre garde\" how they molest me, though an Indian, but a subject of Englishman's dominioms. The other night I was at the Folies Bergere (a Promenade Concert) and I there sought a chance of exchanging a few casual words with two Englishmen, who stood near me. I wish you were then with me, to watch and to judge for yourself, how many French eyes were on me"], [333, "315 at the time. A sharp hasty glance at once enabled me to read their faces, which meant that the apron of Anti- Anglais pose, which they have been forcing on me ever since January 1881 (for up to that time I was very popular, tres aimable, tres gentil, ami particulicr de mon proprietaire de maison, assez riche to patronize their various articles de Paris) \u2014 -that apron is being torn through, and consequently the Poli-comedie plot based on this fictitious Anti-Anglais jiose, soon 'likely to fall into pieces. As for these men, who arc seeing me through their \" Dreyfous These goggles\" \u2014 I know well how to interpret what they say and talk. Although an Indian,\u2014 a regular slave of the English, as we natives of India are looked down upon as such (for Max O'Rell has told them that even the Princes of India are eager to act as shoe-blacks to the English), the beg gars know not, that I am one of the very few who knows them from inside out. To get an insight into the interior or inside of a Frenchman, it won't do simply to see his external life, as seen in the boulevards and cafes \u2014 but one must frequent his thea tres, hear his comic operas and society songs especially. It is from here that I have gained all my knowledge of him ever since 1880. It is from here that I have learnt how to read his or other people's eyes and faces. It was and is still to me a regular study to watch with my jumelles, or opera glass in hand, the ever-changing eyes and physiognomy of the male and female comedie actors. * * * * To tell you the truth it was a real amusement for the first three or four days of my arrival here to watch and to listen atten tively to two Doctors (one of them my Professor and Examiner Dr. Anger) in my immediate neighbourhood on the Table d'hote of the hotel I am at present in, talking with each other on my very subject ; and enjoying great fun as to what they call the \"poli-comedie\" or \"comedie politique\" played out by their neighbours, who they distinctly see were evidently duped to play the role of political comedy actors, and I the unfortu nate victim of their plot."], [334, "316 To conclude, For all this mischief, rest assured I Would never hate the entire nation or the whole city. 1 owe my own life and health to this very city, when I came here very sick with Bronchitis, excited by the London fog of January 1876. I owe my own superior intelligence in knowledge of European life and manners to my being in close personal contact with Un people here in 1880, when I was studying here, I like to promenade in its Boulevards; I appreciate its means of enjoy ing one's life and mono)-, and which are brought up to the level as it were of highest perfection here. I love its cocottes or beauties ; I like its easily digestible cuisine and sweet wines. I was and am still charmed by its savoir rirre. Similarly for the mistakes of some deluded India Office officials I won't hate the entire English nation, in their great city, London ; and the very fact of my having reconsidered my decision aud decided to come to London next month is a proof of what I say. To see an Englishman from his inside, one must join his club to which we in India, have no access ; we are rigidly shut out from it. But the P. & O. 1st clas saloon was a great floating club \u2014 Club Anglais \u2014 to me ; and it is here that I came in close contact with the Auglo-Indian, and had a good insight into his inner life aud temper. Unfortu nately for us both, it is in such floating clubs, as I call them. that we have seen each other's black sides, \u2014 perhaps I saw more of him (the Englishmau's) than he of mine. But I let that matter drop at present. To me it is only a question of some \u00a3s. more, and a couple of months enforced absence from Bombay. But if seriously looked at, this matter,I tell you, should not be allowed to rest here \u2014 just as it did in 1881 \u2014 and lie dormant perhaps for some years more, until I again or any other native of India turns up in Europe like me, aud who may unconsciously lend himself as a tool iu the hands of some astute people ou this side us tbe English Channel. I know how these astute people united under the banner of Egalite and Fraternite, are duping my"], [335, "nip Ol I \" wife ;\" and keep pretending as if they were her best friend and are actually doing her some great or honest service. But I doubt, if iu future (after this plot is unearthed) they wili ever succeed iu drawing their neighbour again into a similar Poli-comedie role, perhaps for their own amusement. Adieu for the pres?nt. I'll be leaving Paris after this week's Bombay mail letters arrive from Genoa, where I had instructed m}* home people to direct. Yours, &c. K. R. \"V Dadabhai Byra.iji, Esq. Chichester House, German Place, Brighton. D Hotel de France et de Lorraine. 5, Rue de Beaune, Paris, 18th September 1890. My dear Mr. Dadabhai Naoroji, I beo- to enclose herein my MS. copy of a letter, dated the 14th instant, to the Editor of the London Times and the Editor of the Dailg Telegraph, headed \"Boycotting of a native of India in Europe ! \" I have posted this day a copy of it to the Editor Bombay Gazette, and am also going to send copies to some select papers in India. To the Gazette, I have written 2 other letters, Nos. I. and II. the latter are not intended fin publication. They are more as a remplissage to my letter to the Times. Facsimile copies of these my letters to the Gazette Editor have been also furnished to the Times and the Telegraph on the. 16th instant; as I believe, I have given some clue therein, to trace the delusion out. 1/lH.lWll, -.-s -S-- The Times returned me my MS. two days ago with a Memo, endorsing these words:-\" With the Editor's compli ments and thanks. \""], [336, "318 Peruse them carefully please, ut your leisure, and tl you car interfere in my behalf with the India Office authorities and try to find out the origin of this mischief. Another native of India. 1 am sure, would have boon pushed unto death by such shames ul and what I should call tout d fait cowardly treatment, \u2014 not only on the part of some deluded Englishmen on the Continent, but caused by t/inn !\u25a0\u2022 be given to me by the Germans, and the Russians, and the French too, in whose countries I have tra velled. But my past experience of Europo and my general knowledge of the world, \u2014 above all, my honest aud clean con science have stood by me. In the teeth of such stupid <le\\ ices to boycott me on this side of the Suez Canal, and to chase me back to India as early as possible, I am proud to say I have travelled from one end of Europo to the other. I could do nothing, while under constant movement in tra velling, to dispel the delusion that I was or am a regular Fenian or an Anti-Anglais, and as much bent upon driving the English out of India (sic !) aud criticizing their administra tion of India in the worst possible form before their neighbours in Europe. I could only take up the subject cither here or in London. Seeing the very excited temper of the English people (whom I can spot easily at once in every city of Europe), for the first 5 or 6 days of my arrival here, I have judged it to be unsafe for me to come to London, and hence I have taken up this subject in hand from here. If you can see your way, do please help me with your advice and influence. I am alone and unprotected ; I am pursued throughout my tour from Wiesbaden and Berlin, down to my entry in Paris, purely out of sheer delusion instilled by some astute person or persons, into the heart of our frank, simple and unthinking John Bull. I say without fear unthinking, because as rightly judged by au American author, he I mean his people belong to the abdominal type of the human species, and therefore rarely cares to think and to act for himself. To the .-ame physiognomic type of the human p ch belong the"], [337, "319 Germans. The Russians and the French are classed by the same American Doctor (whose name I cannot now recollect) under the Nervous or Nervine type of the human species. Hence it is, I am sure, why these two nations on the two opposite borders of Europe are very wide-awake and not likely to be easily sold or duped by any person of foreign nationality. You will be astonished, my dear Mr. Dadabhoy, to learn that even my Bombay letters from my poor old mother were stopped at Genoa chez Rubattino & Co., and I cotdd not get them, though I had instructed them (more than once) to post them Poste Restante, Paris, on the day I left Genoa (5th August 1890). I could not get them until I wrote to Genoa and waited for some daj s and at last was obliged to telegraph for them. The French Bank (Cornptoir National d'Escompte de Paris) would not even hand me my draft for some 500 Francs and one Ville de Paris Bond for which I called at their office, Rue Bergere, with a French Doctor, on the 3rd September, the day following my arrival here ; although these were handed to their Bombay agency on the 31st July last, and had arrived here before the last week of August. It was only after I suc ceeded in getting my home letters from Genoa on the 8th instant, when I took their Bombay agency receipt to them and demanded payment, that my draft and my bond were handed to me, after a great deal of fuss or much ado for nothing, or a ruse to search them out as it were, in their petite chambre, the department of \" Correspondance etrangere\" , and after keeping me waiting for nearly three-quarters of an hour. These and many other like facts will and shall, see light. For until the whole mischief is laid threadbare and open, of course by all available honest means, \u2014 I am sure our simpleton of a John Bull will not cast off his delusion. To me personally all the exhibition made of me, in the cities of Europe, is but a trivial matter. I care not a rap for the people here. I have seen them sufficiently, and this time during my 3rd tour in Em-ope"], [338, "320 have had the exceptionally rare chance of seeing them through their inside as it were. I now know well how under the cloak of politeness, good manners, and gentlemanly appearance, and their Christian civilization, there lies concealed, side by side, in their hearts and brains, vices and moral debasement, even of the existence of which, we in India have not the remotest idea. I have my own opinion of them as to their easy conscience, their (I mean of the men I had to deal with) want of judgment, and their open moral cowardice, as often displayed by men of all classes\u2014 learned and unlearned, the high and the low\u2014 in attack ing a solitary and unprotected traveller, like me, whose manners, customs and nationality are quite apart from their owu. If calmly and dispassionately viewed, it is a question which affects the English people more, \u2014 as rulers of India ; and I could see that easily from the way the whole affair is interpreted by some intelligent Frenchmen, who say I am \"un homme scrieux, seulement il a fait le journaliste\" and who look upon this mis chief as a regular \" Poli-comedie \" or \"Comedie politique,\" played by their neighbours, perhaps for their special amuse ment (very likely ever since 1881) but at my poor unfortunate man's expense. I authorize you to make any use you like of these my letters and copies of which I have also forwarded on to India. My health is so very much shaken by this mischief (which I prefer calling a regular delusion anglais) , this persistent irritation of an innocent, and quiet man like me, that I think it quite unsafe for me to return immediately to Bombay, in this hot weather in the Red sea, with plenty of cholera on the coast, and have written to Rubattino to cancel my passage by the Boat of September 20th by which boat I had before quitting Genoa got myself provisionally booked. I now prefer returning next November or December at the latest. Please write me a few lines in acknowledgment of this letter and let me have your proper address, Meanwhile I have posted the"], [339, "321 letter to the kind care of Dadabhoy & Co. of the Wool Exchange, E. C. I am, yours very truly, KAIKHUSRO R. VICCAJI. V Mr. Dadabhai Naoroji's reply to this is printed at page 32, 1st Fascicule. E. Hotel de France et de Lorraine, 5, Rue de Beaune, Paris, 25th September, 1890. Dear Dadabhai Naoroji, I received your letter of the 21st instant, last night. As your Essay on the Poverty of India (a few copies of which I had brought from you from London in 1881) has been lending colour to the mischief, that \" the English enrich themselves at the expense of India,\" I am afraid you would not like to stir in this matter. It will be simply cowardice on my part to run away back to India and not to face the mischief. I am morally confident that I was not at all guilty and never deserved such treatment, for boycotting and chasing me back to India from the cities of Europe, and for getting me kicked by the German and the Russians and the French too, in all their Railways, I have travelled in and their cities I have visited. You can easily see that, when I have travelled from one end of Europe to the other in the face of the drole et sou trick, which from its birth-place in this city in 1881, I preset calling a regular article de Paris, or a, plat du four. I see you can neither look at the matter from my own point of view nor from that of the Englishman's. As yet you have not read the papers ; you cannot appreciate the situation I am in nor the awkward position into which some officials of the India Office have allowed themselves to be drawn ever since 1881, by the originators of this mischief. At the bottom of it"], [340, "322 lies the Anti- Anglais pose given to me from the Ecole de M-di cine Quartier, directly I was declared recu or qualified for the Diplome of Docteur en Medicine. I have lived sufficiently long among these people here to understand what it means, when a Frenchman tells you that \u00ab' les Francais n'aiment pas faire la petite mine devant les etrangers \" \u2014 (a Frenchman never likes to look small before the foreigners). This was the sort of interpretation put upon a These or Essay, eveiy student has to present before getting entitled to the diplome of docteur en medecine. My Essay was written for me by a French Doctor, \u2014 Dr. Dreyfous, who evidently (out of pure spite or I know not what), wanted to kick some of the living authors and professeurs here, and he unnoticed, while correcting the proof sheets, added a footnote to the Essay (he wrote for me for 250 francs) which caused considerable irritation, among the students and the hospital internes after it was printed and published. At the time the These or Essay was presented, no notice at all was taken of it. The irritation (I remember well) declared itself in the shape of the drole or sou trick, so very common here. Finding it failed to take root in me, the device of posing me as an Anti-Anglais was very astutely conceived and carried out. I am sure a Frenchman knows the weak traits of Eng lish character and many a Max O'Rell has done that. But an Englishman's knowledge of a Frenchman is derived (it seems to me) from what he sees of him in his Cafes and Boulevards and not from inside oi him. I am coming to London next month. I am waiting here only for my Bombay letters directed to Rubattino, Genoa. I have not heard or seen any of my home letters since 15 August last. I will not leave Europe nor suffer myself to be chased out of it either by the Germans, the Russians or the French (and by such tricks which are so very patent to me from Feb. and March, 1881) until I knock at the door of the India Office and try to open the eyes of some deluded irresponsible official there"], [341, "323 who has I am sure on the faith of what was told to him from here in 1881, put me evidently on the Black List. It is he alone I am morally certain is the cause of all this mischief which has led many farseeing and shrewd people here to look upon it a\u201e it were a \"Poli-comedie ou comedie politique jouee par nos voisins \" (political comedie played out by our neighbour). Excuse my trespassing on your very precious time in Europe by this my long letter. You will be good enough to return all my papers to Mr. D. Byramji of the Wool Exchange, E. C. from whom I'll receive them, when I come to London. Yours truly, KAIKHUSRO R. VICCAJI. Dadabhai Naoroij, Esquire. National Liberal Club, London. F The Grand Hotel, Trafalgar Square, London, Thursday, October 23, 1S90. To The Editor of the Times, Printing House Square, London, Dear Sir, \u2014 I beg to enclose herein for your personal perusal only, a copy of the French These I had to present at the Ecole de Medecine, Paris (in Nov. 1880), before getting my Diplome of Docteur en Medecine there. I have marked therein parts or lines, which were the real source of all that irritation among the Ecole de Medecine men. It began directly after the These was published and culminated in what I have called in my letters to you and to"], [342, "324 my other friends a regular \"Foil Trick\" \u2014 so veiy common ly resorted to in Paris, to chase any unpleasant man out of it. Failing in this trick, or rather I should say simultaneously with it a regular \" Poli-comedie \" plot was conceived and carried out so successfully that even some 10 years after that event, I am still made the victim of it, from the moment I set my foot again in Europe. I'll be leaving London after very nearly a month's stay in your country, and before I return to Bombay, I avail myself of this the last opportunity to thank you once more for enabling me to come up here from the Continent and to have the pleasure of revisiting, this the 3rd time, my favourite old haunts and promenades in your capital city.
