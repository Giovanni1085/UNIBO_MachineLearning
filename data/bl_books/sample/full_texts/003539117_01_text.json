While the spacious pages of the County His torian, says the ingenious Editor of the \" Northern \" Garlands,\" are too exclusively engrossed by topo graphical surveys, genealogical tables, statistical numbers, or agricultural refinements ; the humble and amusing village strains, founded upon the squabbles of a wake ; tales of untrue love ; super stitious rumors ; or miraculous traditions of the"], [16, "( VIA ) hamlet ; are very slightly regarded, if not glanced over unnoted. A county garland is one of those minor publications scarcely considered worthy the attention of a county editor ; and from the motley basket of an itinerary mendicant, the reader is alone supplied with such an entertainment. To glean for each county its appropriate Ballads might, there fore, be an acceptable task. If they neither vied for adventures with the deeds of chivalry, nor eclipsed the gallant knight and courtly dame in marvellous amours ; yet their characteristics would be a just and faithful representation of domestic manners and provincial customs ; they would exhi bit nature without the foil of art ; and \" the short \" and simple annals\" of the rustic would often be found preserved in the ditty, which \" at her wheel \" the village-maiden sings.\" It may be easy to jumble together a parcel of Songs, of all dates, and upon all subjects, indiscriminately, and from their historical allusions, or novelty of romantic incident, excite and partly gratify curiosity ; but this medley must fail to convey an equal interest with the re cord of some domestic tale, founded upon the at tractive scenes of youth ; when, however rude the combination of language and numbers, our partia lity may be said to \" grow with our growth.\" To the mind that has once imbibed an hereditary love of rural haunts, fancy, amid the vicissitudes of life, the toil of worldly pursuits, or the visitation of foreign climes, can mock the lapse of time, and, like the wandering Swiss, still fondly picture home, and dwell with enthusiastic delight on native strains. The English have always been a great Ballad nation, and once abounded with various Songs of Trades, and numerous Songs for the People. The Ballad, says Aikin in his \" Essay on Ballads and \" Pastoral Songs,\" may be considered as the native species of poetry in this country. It very exactly answers the idea formerly given of original poetry, being the rude, uncultivated verse in which the"], [17, "(IX) popular tale of the times was recorded. As our an cestors partook of the fierce, warlike character of the northern nations, the subjects of their poetry would chiefly consist of the martial exploits of their heroes, and the military events of national history, deeply tinctured with that passion for the marvel lous, and that superstitious credulity, which always attends a state of ignorance and barbarism. Many of the ancient Ballads have been transmitted to the present times, and in them the character of the na tion displays itself in striking colors. The boast ful history of her victories, the prowess of her favorite kings and captains, and the wonderful ad ventures of the legendary saint and knight-errant, are the topics of the rough rhyme and unadorned narration, which was ever the delight of the vulgar, and is now an object of curiosity to the antiquary, and man of taste. In later times, these pieces consisted of the village tale, the dialogue of rustic courtship, the description of natural objects, and the incidents of rural life. Their language is the language of nature, simple and unadorned; their -tory is not the wild offspring of fancy, but the probable adventure of the cottage, and their senti ments are the unstudied expressions of passions and emotions, common to all mankind. The old Song of \" Chevy Chase\" was long the favorite Ballad of the common people ; and Ben Jonson used to say, that he had rather have been the author of it than of all his works. Sir Philip Sidney, in his \" Dis \" course of Poetry,\" speaks of it in the following words : I never heard the old Song of Piercy and Douglas, that I found not ray heart more moved than with a trumpet ; and yet it is sung by some blind crowder with no rougher voice than rude stile; which being so evil apparelled in the dust and cob web of that uncivil age, what would it work trim med in the gorgeous eloquence of Pindar ? The celebrated Author of the \" Task\" was strongly at tached to this stile of composition, and in one of his \" Letters\" says, that it is a species of poetry"], [18, "( X ) peculiar to this country, equally adapted to the drollest or the most tragical subjects. Simplicity and ease are its peculiar characteristics. Our fore fathers excelled in it, but we moderns have lost the art. It is observed, that we have few good English Odes : but to make amends we have many excel lent Ballads, not inferior, perhaps, in true poetical merit to some of the very best Odes that the Greek or Latin languages have to boast of. \" These venerable, ancient so_c-__._itf.rs \" Soar 'd many a pitch above our modern writers ; \" With rough, majestic force they moved the beast, \" And strength and nature made amends tor art.\" Ballads are described by Puttenham, a Critic in the reign of Elizabeth, as small and popular Songs, sung by those Cantabanqui upon benches and bar rels heads, where they have no other audience than boys or country fellows that pass by them in the streets: or else by blind harpers, or suchlike tavern minstrels, that give a fit of mirth for a groat. Such were these \" Reliques of ancient English Poetry,\" says D'lsraeli, in his \" Curiosities of Literature,\" which are more precious to us than they were to our ancestors ; strangers as we have become to their pure pastoral feelings, and more eccentric habits of life. They form the Collections of Percy and Rit son. But the latter poetical antiquary tells us that few are older than the reign of James the 1st. The more ancient Songs of the People perished by hav ing been printed in single sheets, and their humble purchasers had no other library to preserve them than the walls on which they pasted them. Those we have consist of a succeeding race of Ballads, chiefly revived or written by Richard Johnson, the author of the well-known Romance of the \" Seven \" Champions,\" and Deloney, the writer of\" Jack of \" Newbury's Life,\" and the \" Gentle Craft,\" who lived in the time of James and Charles. The practice of collecting them into books did not take place, says Ritson, till after the reign of Eli-"], [19, "(XI ) zabeth, and is probably owing to this Johnson and Deloney, who, when they were advanced in years, and incapable, perhaps, of producing any thing of merit, seem to have contented themselves with col lecting their more juvenile or happier compositions into little Penny Books, entitled gap. lands ; of these, being popular and often reprinted, many are still extant. In the Pepysian * and other libraries, are preserved a great number, in __>[at& t-CttCs, 1 2mo. under the following quaint and affected titles: A Crown Garland ofGo'.iMen Roses gathered out of England's Royai I Garden, &c. by Richard Johnson, 161_ (In the Bod leian Library.) \" In Bib.

Mr. Heber and Mr. Hill have each a copious col- lection ; and Mr. Gutch, when a Bookseller at Bris- tol, gratified the curious by exhibiting in his Cata- logue of 1810 a number of garlands, which proved a successful bait for a hungry book-fish, for I saw them, says Dibdin in his Bibliomania, a few days after in the well-furnished library of Atticus (R. Heber, Esq.) who exhibited them to me in triumph, grasping the whole of them between his finger and thumb. They are marvellous well-looking little vo- lumes, clean, bright, and rejoicing to the eye ; many of them, moreover, are first editions. The severest winter cannot tarnish the foliage of such garlands. In Dr. Farmer's Catalogue, No. 6288. were upwards of seventy Garlands and Penny-Histo- ries.

These Songs and Ballads were written on various subjects and printed between the years 1560, and 1700. In a note to the Roxburghe Catalogue (Pref. pp. 7- 8) it is stated that this Collection was origi nally formed fas 'the celebrated library of the Earl of Oxford, at the begining of the last century, and"], [21, "( XIII ) was then supposed to exceed the famous Pepys col lection at Cambridge. It was obtained from the Harleian library by Mr. West ; at whose sale it was purchased for \u00a3.20 by Major Pearson, a gen tleman who had made old English literature his particular study. In his possession, with the assist ance of his friend, Mr. Isaac Reed, the collection received very great additions, and was bound up in two large volumes, with printed title pages, index es, ._c. In this state it was bought at Major Pearson's sale in 1788, for\u00a3.26 4_. by the D uke of Roxburghe, who soon added a considerable number to the two volumes, and formed a third. At the Duke's sale it was purchased by Mr. Harding. This numerous and matchless collection is printed in the _5!ilC_ IL.tt.r, and decorated with many hun dred wooden prints. They are pasted upon paper, with borders (printed on purpose) round each bal lad : also a printed title and index to each volume. To these are added the paragraphs, which appeared in the public papers, respecting the above curious collection, at the time they were purchased at Mr. West's. At Mr. I. Reed's sale No 5867. a Port folio of single-sheet Ballads, sold for 15<\u00a3. 10s. Antiquarian research, and even Poetry itself, have been of late turned to the elucidation of ancient man ners, and customs; and the pursuit is a decisive proof of the superior intelligence and curiosity which be long to modern times. The favorable attention, there fore, which has been shewn to such works, how ever trifling, has induced the Editor of the present collection to communicate a small Garland of Poetic Flowers,illustrative of these topics ; in which, how ever, the reader must not expect to find romantic wildness, or the interesting fable, muchless \"thoughts \" that breathe, or words that burn.\" But to the Antiquary and the County Collector no apology need, surely, be offered for thus opening a fresh source of gratification and amusement in their fa vorite pursuit ; and this first attempt to collect to gether the scattered Poems, &c. &c. illustrative of"], [22, "( XIV ) the County of Suffolk cannot, it is presumed, be unacceptable, as they will exhibit a just and faith ful representation of domestic manners, and provin cial customs. In the arrangement, adopted by the Editor, the following collection is divided into Four Parts, of which the First Part will be found to consist of \" Local Descriptions ;\" the Second of \" Circumstan \" ces and Events, Historical, Political, Legendary, \" and Romantic ;\" the Third of \" Biographical Me \" moirs, Anecdotes, and Characters ;\" and the Fourth of \" Manners, Habits, and Customs.\" To each Poem are prefixed such necessary Remarks and Observa tions as tend to ellucidate the subject, but which, from the narrow limits of the plan, are of course superficial, and calculated rather to excite than to gratify curiosity. They do not, indeed, affect to convey any fresh information, or to abound in anec dotes hitherto unnoticed : it is hoped, however, that they still may be deemed necessary by ordinary readers, and no unacceptable appendage to the seve ral articles. The Notes, likewise, which are ap pended, will be found to contain some little information of which every one may not be already possessed, and which may serve to amuse at least, if they fail to instruct. It has been the Editor's en deavour to form this garland of the choicest and most variegated flowers ; and to dispose those which he has culled in such a manner as to place in their proper fight the dark shades, sprightly glow, and airy colors, and thus to form a combination at once pleasing to the eye, and gratifying to the taste. To a valuable and highly esteemed Friend, the accuracy of whose information is unquestionable, from whom the Editor first derived a taste for An tiquarian and Topographical research, and with whom he has spent many pleasurable hours in its pursuit, he stands indebted for much useful infor mation, particularly in the Biographical Part of this collection. He is, therefore, alone restrained from"], [23, "( XV ) expressing what he feels for such continued assist ance by the delicacy of an intimate friendship. It would be absurd to state that the Subject is exhausted. Many Pieces, both of Miscellaneous and Romantic Poetry, are doubtless yet remaining in various libraries throughout the County, and in the hands of private Collectors, which have escaped the researches of the present Editor : but he has completed the object which he proposed to himself, and trusts that he has been instrumental in render ing accessible to common readers no inconsiderable portion of Suffolk local poetry."], [24, ""], [25, "CONTENTS.

Morning \u2014 River Scenery \u2014 The Glen \u2014 The Artist \u2014The Fisherman\u2014 The Spell\u2014 The Yacht- Days of Yore \u2014 Conclusion. The picturesque beauties and characteristic features qfthe River Orwell are very accurately and tastefully described in the following Poem. The \" Ancient Fisherman,\" whose character is pour- trayed in these Stanzas, is not a mere creature qfthe imagination, but an eccentric Being, once resident in the parish of St. Clement, Ipswich, by name Thomas Colson, but better known by the appella- tion of Robinson Crusoe. He was originally a wool-comber, and afterwards a weaver ; but a want of constant employment in both these occupations induced him to enter into the East Suffolk Militia ; and whilst quartered at Leicester, he learned, with B 2"], [32, "8 his usual ingenuity, the art of stocking-weaving, which trade\"he afterwards followed in this County. But this employment, in its turn, he soon relinquish ed ; and became a fisherman on the river Orwell. His little vessel sis vessel it might be called, for every part qf it was his own handy work J presented a curious specimen qf naval patchwork, as his extreme poverty did not afford him the means qf procuring proper materials : yet in this leaky and crazy vessel it was his constant custom by day and by night, in calms and in storms, to toil on the river for fish. His figure was tall and thin ; his counte nance meagre, yet striking ; and his eye sharp and piercing. Subject lo violent chronic complaints ; with a mind somewhat distempered, and faculties impaired; he was a firm believer in the evil agency of wizards and witchcraft. On this subject indeed he was by no means uninformed ; and a frequent perusal of the \" D\u0153monology \" qf the British Solo- mon, K. James the I, operating on a gloomy and superstitious temper, soon confirmed his belief in these absurd opinions. He appeared also to have read \" Glanvil's Saducismus Triumphans\" with considerable attention; and while arguing on this his favorite topic, his quotations from this author were just and apposite. His mind was so haunted with the dreams qf charms and enchantments, as to fancy that he was continually under the influence qf these mischievous tormentors. His arms and legs, nay almost his whole body, was encircled with the bones qf horses, rings, amulets and characts, verses, words, Sfc. as spells and charms to protect him against their evil machinations. On different parts qf his boat was to be seen the \" horse shoe nailed,\" that most effective antidote against the power qf witches. When conversing with him, he would de- scribe to you that he saw them hovering about his person, and endeavoring, by all their arts, to punish and torment him. Though a wretched martyr to the fancies of a disordered imagination, his manners were mild and harmless, and his character honest"], [33, "9 and irreproachable. But however powerful and effective his charms might be to protect him from the agency qf evil spirits, they did not prove sufficiently operative against the dangers qf storm and tempest. For being unfortunately driven on the ooze by a violent storm on the 3rd qf October 1811, he was seen and earnestly importuned to quit his crazy vessel; but, relying on the efficacy of his charms, he obstinately refused ; and the ebb of the tide drawing his bark off into deep water, his charms, his spells, and his characts failed him ; and poor Robinson sunk to rise no more ! The Editor of this Collection has in his possession the following Charm in the hand-writing qf Colson, which he subjoins literatim et verbatim. \"A CHARM to make a young woman seem to be in love with a young man. Take new wax and the pouder qf a dead man, make an image with the face downward and in the likeness qf the person you wish to have : make it in the ouers of mars and in the new qf the mone : under the left arm poke place a Swaler's hart and a liver under the rite : you must have a new needal and a new thread : the Sprits name must be menchened, his Sine and his Character. I take this oppertunity to inform my f rinds that about 16 yeares ago this Charm was put >\" practice by sum willains qf witches at Needham-markett, William Studd been one of them : and they hart put me to much torment and lamed me many times, thay own to me that thay make use of part of the bones of Mrs. Wilkerson of Felixtow, she that suffred at Rushmere sum yeares ago : this is sartainly true, and I am ready to give it upon oth if required.

Nor yet the bee, to care alive, On sounding wing hath left his hive ; The haunt of busier man is still ; The morn beam slants athwart the hill ; Unconscious draws the blackbird nigh, Then starts, a stranger form to spy, And swift, with glossy wing display'd, Flits fearful through the shrubby glade. Upon my verdant canopy All unexal'd night's tear drops lie, Or gently shook, with soothing sound, In balmy dew-show'rs patter round. Those tall acacias gliding bye, The white sail steals upon my eye : And ever, as the loitering breeze Moves the light boughe, or waves the trees. White cluster'd dwellings, scarcely seen, And tow'r, and turret, peep between ; And pennon'd mast, and gilded vane, A moment shewn, then hid again, All gaily in the morning ray, Like youth's fantastic visions play :"], [35, "11 While ev'ry graceful form I see, Inspires the wish to live with thee. Oft has thy voice, in childhood's hour, Awoke me in the northern bow'r, And shall the lyre I tun'd to thee Hang silent on the southern tree ? Shall cares or pomps my heart controul, And chase thy pleasures from my soul ? No : still thy voice shall soothe my ear ; Thy harp's wild descant still be dear ; Nor long wilt thou my claim refuse, When to my bow'r I call thee, Muse. Come, let us wander thro' the glade, Where willows throw, in lengthen'd shade, Their tangling arches o'er the rill, That steals its source from either hill, And gently winds its covert way, Scarce gleaming to the eye of day. In sooth the \"wild sequester'd glen Seems little trod by mortal men : Its lowly bow'rs of deep'ning green, So clos'd the woody heights between, So hid, so still, form meet resort For fays to hold their sylvan court: Yet here I've mark'd the Artist* stray, Here linger out the summer day, And with enthusiast pencil trace, Or storm or sunshine's varied grace : \u2022 The banks of this beautiful river were the frequent haunts of that admirable painter Gainsborough, while resident at Ipswich ; and afforded ample scope for the exercise of his inimitable pencil. Mr. George Frost, a most ingenious artist of Ipswich, and an ardent admirer of the productions of Gainsborough, ,and who deems \" it distinction enough to catch the slightest of his perfec \" tions,\" is the personage alluded to in the above stanzas."], [36, "12 But chief when golden lights relieve The dark and giant shades of eve, He feels his soul to transport warm, And fixes ev'ry fleeting charm. And sure, in playful mood, 'tis thine, Dear Muse ! to guide his varying line, As breathe, in ev'ry form and tone, Strange feelings scarce to painting known ; Effects sublime, and graces free That speak the soul of poesy ! Come, rest upon the beetling cliff, And mark that little rocking skiff : Though measur'd true the oar's bright stroke, Its plank is pierc'd, its gunwale broke : Yet on it glides, and leaves behind Yon anchor'd bark, where, to the wind, Long trains of meshy folds display d, Announce the Fisher's toilsome trade. And who is this that plies the oar, The skiff impelling to the shore, With squalid garments round him flung, And o'er his bending shoulders hung A string of perforated stones, With knots of elm and horses bones ? Say, Muse, may this a mortal be, Or shape fantastic drawn by thee ? And why his look so wild, so wan ? It is the ancient Fisherman, Who dreams that wizards, leagued with hell, Have o'er him cast their deadly spell. Tho' blanch'd his hair and bow'd his form, Yet still he toils, in sun and storm ;"], [37, "13 The boat he plies, the raft he steers, When swift the rapid whirlwind veers, When scarce the corvorant can sweep The surface of the foaming deep. Tho' pinching pain his limbs endure, He holds his life by charm secure, And while he feels the tort'ring ban, No wave can drown the spell-bound man. Can Leeches hand, or sages skill, His pains assuage, his troubles still ? The ills from fancy's pow'r we feel, 'Tis fancy's pow'r alone can heal : Then, Muse, employ thy sweetest strain To cure the ancient wand'rer's pain. Cije \" O rest thee, rest thee, sailor bold, In lowly hut beneath the willow, Warm fire shall chase the Autumn's cold, And fragrant woodruffs strew thy pillow \" I may not rest, I may not sleep, For spells my weary eyelids strain, Fierce fiends their watchings by me keep, And call me to the roaring main. They shriek around, they ride the blast, Hang on my nets in vivid fires, And whirling in fantastic spires, Like smoky wreaths ascend the mast ; And ever as the midnight hour Their hate confirms, renews their pow'r ; Infernal forms my couch invest, Then, Lady, may I, can I rest ? \""], [38, "14 \" O rest thee in the mossy cave, The falling rill shall soothe thy slumbers ; And sweetly to the murm'ring wave The wild harp breathe its magic numbers.\" \" I may not sleep \u2014 with hellish pow'r The wizard works in secret bow'r ! I saw the wretch a mass prepare Of melted wax and dead men's dust ; From mould'ring sculls he scrap'd the hair, And worms from eyeless sockets thrust ; Then shap'd the whole \u2014 distinct and true, I saw my very image rise ; My swelling brow, my sunken eyes, Too soon to dreadful likeness grew ; And as the plastic form he prest, Some magic words he nuitter'd o'er : Then from a hying swallow's breast, The reeking heart and liver tore : The bleeding spoil on either side Beneath the moulded arms he tied, And from a cobweb curtain'd nook, The dark demoniac rite to swell, Some half burnt bones the wizard took, I shudder' d, for I knew them well.

Now shall we, Muse, in fancy float With revellers in pageant boat, And view with them each lovely scene, Of wooded hill, and valley green, Till Orivell water, broad and free, In mingling billows joins the sea ? Or shall we, on the pebbled shore, Retrace the bolder scenes of Yore, And tell what corses ridg'd the plain * When Angles chac'd th' invading Dane ? Or call to view the listed field, . Where gleam the banner, crest and shield ; Or, by the merry greenwood side. With squire, and dame, and falc'ner ride. And mark how well the gyr-hawk, tried, Brings down the heron's tow'ring pride ? \u2022 The banks of this river, and the adjacent country, were the frequent scenes of the most sanguinary conflicts between the Danes and the inhabitants of this comity. In the parish of Nacton, a village bordering on the banks of the Orwell, and near the road leading from Ipswich to Trimley, is a place called \u00ab' the Seven Hill a,\" so designated from a number of elevations, which have all the appearance of banows, though they are more in number than the name implies. Hence it has been plausibly conjectured that it was near this spot, and not at Rushmere, that Earl Ulfketil engaged the Danes in 1010, iu which he sustained a signal defeat. In these barrows the slain are supposed to have been buried."], [41, "17 Or list the bugle's jocund sound, That cheers the deeper throated hound. Who tracks, unfoil'd, his princely prey.

The following lines are a translation from a Poem. written in the reign of James the I. entitled \" \u00c6des Solitaries,\" by the Rev. Charles Davy, who says in one qf his Letters, dated June 20, 1782 \" I shall apply \" them to the Spot where it has pleased the divine Pro \" vidence to place me; and the spirit qfthe author would \"forgive it, could he know with how muck propriety \" they are adapted to this situation, in which I hope \" to close the evening of my life.\" This Gentleman was educated at Caius College, Cambridge, where he proceeded to the degree qf B. A. 1742, and M. A. 1748. He was presented to the Rectory qf Topcrqft, Norfolk in 1764,- and in 1776 to that qf Onehouse in this County. He was the author qf \" Conjectural Observations on the Origin and Pro gress qf Alphabetic Writing, 1772,\" 8vo. and in 1787"], [42, "18 he published in two volumes 8vo. \" Letters upon Subjects qf Literature.\" In the Preface to this work he says, \" most qf these little essays were written many years \" ago ; they have been collected from detached papers, \" and revised for publication as a relief to the author's \" mind, during a confinement now ofnwre than eighteen \" months continuance. It seemed good to the Supreme \" Disposer of all things to reduce him in a moment, by \" an apoplectic stroke, from the most perfect slate of \" health and cheerfulness, amidst his friends, to a pa \" ralytic permanent debility ; a debility, which hath \" not only fixed him to his chair, but brought on spasms \" so exquisitely painful, and frequently so unremitled, \" as scarcely to allow a single hour's repose to himfor \" many days and nights together. Under the pressure \" of these afflictions, God hath graciously been pleased \" to continue to him his accustomed sow qf spirits, and \" to preserve his memory and his understanding in some \"degree qf vigor. These alleviating blessings have \" enabled him to borrow pleasure from past times, in \" support qf the present ; to call back the delightful and \" instructing conversations he enjoyed in a society qf \" worthy and ingenious friends, and to resume those \" studies and amusements, which rendered the former \"part of his life happy.\" His writings in general evince a sound understanding, a correct taste, and a benevolent heart. He died April 8, 1797, in his 75th year, and lies buried in the chancel qf the Church qf Onehouse, but witlwut any inscription to his memory. NO gilded roofs here strain the gazer's eye ; No goblets flow with noxious luxury ; Sleep, balmy Sleep, here rests his downy wings, Nor waits the purple pomp of gorgeous coverings : No gems here dazzle the offended sight ; No trilling airs inspire unchaste delight ; No servile bands with crouching necks appear, Not Flatt'ry's self can find admission here."], [43, "19 But lofty groves of beauteous forms are seen, The builder oak,f \\hejir for ever green ; The tow'ring ash, whose clustering tops receive The rising sun, and deck the ruddy eve ; The alder brown, that loves the watry vales, The asp light-quiv'ring to the summer gales ; The willow pendent o'er the mazy stream, The poplar huge, the elms extended beam, Their different colours here display, and vie In all the tints of varied harmony. Nor less the shrubs their wholesome fruits afford. And blooming orchards still supply the board : t The Manor of Onehouse, in the reign of Edward the Third, wa_ ia the possession of Bartholemew Lord Burghersh, (one of the twelve noblemen to whose care the Prince of Wales was committed at the battle of Cressy) with grant of free warren for all his demesne lands in Suffolk. A farm house hath been built on the site of the old bails where he probably resided, which was encompassed with a moat, upon whose eastern bank an oak is now growing, and ap parently sound, the circumference of which, at the smallest part of the bole, is sixteen feet, and twenty-four at the height of three yards from the ground. Notwithstanding one of its principal lead ing arms, with several other massy boughs on the north side ha\\e been broken off by tempest. , it contains at present upwards of four hundred and ninety feet of solid timber by measurement, in its stem and branches About sixty yards to the southward of this venerable tree, i_ a broad leafed elm, whose boughs in the year 1731, extended sifly four feet towards the north, and near forty upon its opposite side, measuring each way from the center of the trunk. The greater part of this parish, two centuries ago* wa_ a wood, except a narrow strip declining' to the sonth east near this large distinguished mansion, which was beautifully situated upon _ rising ground, gently sloping into a valley, with a rhrulet winding through it. In the base court, or the outside of the moat towards the east, which is a square of half an acre, now the milking yard of the farm house, there were growing in the year 1776, as many ashen trees as contained upwards of a thousand and three hun dred solid feet of timber Ihis estate, with the manor and advow&on of the rectory, is now in the possession of Roger Petti ward, of Great Finborough Hall, esq. The church, which is small, and has a baptistery, or font, of unhewn stone, seems to have been a Saxon building ; but a part of the north wall only, extending about ten yards from the tower, which is circular, is all that remains of the original stmc\u00bb ture. It is situated two hundred yards to the north of the moat that surrounded the old mansion house, whose grandeur and solitary situation probably gave name to the parish. No less than a fifth portion of its lands at pre-ent consists of woods and groves siuely planted with timbers ; and even a part of the rectorial glebe ail- i &in ing to the parsonage house is a wood qf ten or twelve acres*"], [44, "20 Earth spreads her charms, with flow'rs the meads are crown'd, And smiling Ceres pours her gifts around. How sweetly does the love-lorn nightingale To night's dun shades repeat her mournful tale ; And when the rosy morn appears in view, , The painted tribes their cheerful notes renew ; From every copse they fly, on every spray Swell their gay throats, and hail the rising day. No sordid views deprive the soul of rest ; No Passions here disturb the labouring breast ; Save Grief, that sickens at another's woe, And bids the melting sorrows sweetly flow. Far from the madding people's furious strife, Far from the anxious cares of busy life, Beneath this straw-thatch'd roof, this humble cell, t Calm Peace, and Friendship pure, delight to dwell ; And when retired to rest, soft dreams employ Their slumb'ring thoughts, and tune the soul to joy, Which, rapt in bliss, through airy regions flies, Quits the dull earth, and claims her native skies. .The Parsonage House, now the residence of the Rev.

BERNARD BARTON. The slurre at Felixtow is bold and steep, being composed of a hard sand, intermixed with shingle, and perfectly free from ooze ; and the marine view delight ful, the beach can by no means be denominated a barren one, as it frequently happens that very large and fine pieces of jet and amber are cast ashore, and picked up at low water. During the late war, several Martello Towers were erected here, at a very considerable ex- pence, for the protection qf the coast. On the cliff, about three miles from Languard Fort, is situated Felixtow Cottage, the residence of Sir Samuel Brudenell Fludyer, Bart. It was formerly a mere fisherman's hut, and was purchased by the eccentric Philip Thicknesse, Esq. then Lieutenant Governor of the Fort, for \u00a355. whose taste, aided by the embellish- ments qf his wife's pencil, soon converted it into a charming occasional retreat ; and here they resided during the summer months. On relinquishing his Lieu- tenant Governorship, he disposed of this Cottage lo the Dowager Lady Batemanfor \u00a3400. about half the money which he had expended upon it. The beauties qf this place have been fully described by Mrs. Thicknesse in her Memoirs ; but great alterations have been made both within and without since the period to which her account refers : in particular, the arch, which she mentions as being formed qf huge stones in front qfthe cottage, has been removed ; by which a most extensive marine prospect is opened from the terrace that winds round the edge of the cliff. An engraving qfthe Cottage, when inhabited by Governor Thicknesse, on a reduced scale, was inserted in the Gent. Mag. Aug. 1 8 1 6. p. 105. from a larger one, which is now become scarce.

Duncan Forbes, many years Lord President qf the Court qf Session in Scotland. With' this gentleman he was sent abroad; and after some residence at Orleans and Montauban, went lo Rome, and completed what is usually termed the grand tour."], [49, "25 'The friendship qf the tutor and pupil remained unim- paired through life ; and the former, having obtained the living qf Stradisliall, through the friendship of James Vernon qf Great Thurlow, esq. whose son he ac- companied on his travels, had the satisfaction qf receiv- ing for many years the long and frequent visits qf his first pupil, and of superintending the early education of his eldest son Duncan Forbes, in his own vicinity. In one qf his letters to Mr. John Forbes, dated Jan. 14-th, 1737, he says ; \"As to my own affairs, I have \" given up with travelling for good and all. Mr Vernon \" has offered me a snug little benefice down in Suffolk, \" which I am to be put in possession qf in a few weeks, \" and where I propose to pass the remainder qf my \" days in study and retirement.\" In another letter to the same person, dated Aug. 15th 1738, he thus de- scribes his situation at StradishaU ; \" As to my own \" affairs which you so kindly enquire after, you know \" I am fixed here in a 100\u00a3. living, with which, \" thank God! I am very well content, when I see the \" misery that people born lo no fortunes are reduced to, \" when they take it in their lieads to through themselves \" into the grand monde. The duties of my office are \" by no means disagreeable, and the solitude I live in, \" though sometimes a little irksome, has its conve- \" niences. If I had books, I want not time; and \" I am pleased to find that so long rambling has not \" abated my love qf study. When I came hither, my \" house was in exceeding bad order.

He was admitted at Cambridge to the degree of M. A. per Literas Regias in 1748. In 1749 he was pre sented to the rectory qf Kettlebaston, by William Leman, gent, which he resigned in 1760, when he was presented by Edward Vernon, esq. lo the vicarage qf Great Thurlow. He died in 1774.

Thus safely low, my friend, thou can'st not fall : Here reigns a deep tranquillity o'er all ; No noise, no care, no vanity, no strife ; Men, woods, and fields, all breathe untroubled life. Then keep each passion down, however dear; Trust me, the tender are the most severe. Guard, while 'tis thine, thy philosophic ease, And ask no joy but that of virtuous peace ; That bids defiance to the storms of fate : High bliss is only for a higher state."], [51, "27 Description qfthe Coast at ALDEBURGH. BY THE REV. GEORGE CRABBE, L L. B. The following description qfthe Aldeburgh coast is from the pen qf that truly original poet, the Rev. George Crabbe. In the early part qf his life he was a resident licrc; and consequently was enabled to give a finished picture qf the characteristic features of its scenery; and a just delineation of the manners and customs qf its inhabitants. Till within the last fifteen or twenty years, Aldeburgh, depopulated and impo- verished by the incroachments qf the sea, was hastening to complete decay; but several families of late, who wished for a greater degree qf privacy and retirement than can be enjoyed in a more fashionable watering- place, having made this town their summer residence, its appearance has been totally changed. To the deep sands, .tvhichformerly led lo it, have succeeded excel- lent turnpike roads ; and instead qf the dirty clay-built cottages, which gave the place a mean and squalid appearance, are now seen many neat and comfortable mansions, the property and occasional retreat qf per- sons qf rank and fortune. The manners and morals.af the lower classes likewise are very much meliorated ; and it may fairly be presumed, from their general good conduct, civility and decorum, that the improve- ment of these has been commensurate with that which has qf late years taken place in the general appearance qf the town. A portrait qf Mr. Crabbe was published in the New Monthly Magazine for February, 1816. \u2014 Cast by Fortune on a frowning coast, Which neither groves nor happy vallies boast ; Where other cares than those the muse relates, And other shepherds dwell with other mates ; By such examples taught, I paint the cot, As truth will paint it, and as bards will not. c 4"], [52, "28 r. or you, ye poor, of letter'd scorn complain, To you the smoothest song is smooth in vain ; O'ercome by labour and bow'd down by time, Feel you the barren flattery of a rhyme ? Can poets sooth you, when you pine for bread, By winding myrtles round your ruin'd shed ? Can their light tales your weighty griefs o'erpower, Or glad with airy mirth the toilsome hour ? Lo ! where the heath, with withering brake grown oer, Lends the light turf that warms the neighbouring poor; From thence a length of burning sand appears, Where the thin harvest waves its wither'd ears ; Rank weeds, that every art and care defy, Reign o'er the land and rob the blighted rye : There thistles stretch their prickly arms afar, And to the ragged infant threaten war ; There poppies nodding mock the hope of toil- There the blue bugloss paints the sterile soil ; Hardy and high, above the slender sheaf, The slimy mallow waves her silky leaf; O'er the young shoot the charlock throws a shade, And clasping tares cling round the sickly blade ; With mingled tints the rocky coasts abound, And a sad splendour vainly shines around. Here joyless roam a wild amphibious race, With sullen woe display'd in every face ; Who, far from civil arts and social fly, And scowl at strangers with suspicious eye.

Where now are these? Beneath yon cliff they stand, To shew the freighted pinnace where to land ; To load the ready steed w rith guilty haste, To fly in terror o'er the pathless waste ; Or, when detected in their straggling course, To foil their foes by cunning or by force ; Or yielding part (which equal knaves demand) To gain a lawless passport through the land. Here wand'ring long, amid these frowning fields,, I sought the simple Use that Nature yields ; Rapine and Wrong and Fear usurp'd her place, And a bold, artful, surly, savage race : Who, only skill'd to take the finny tribe, The yearly dinner, * or septennial bribe, t Wait on the shore, and as the waves run high, On the tost vessel bend their eager eye ; Which to their coast directs its vent'rous way, Their's, or the ocean's miserable prey. As on their neighbouring beach yon swallows stand. And wait for favouring winds to leave the land ; While still for flight the ready wing is spread : So waited I the favouring hour, and fled ; Fled from these shores where guilt and famine reign, And cry'd, Ah ! hapless they who still remain ; \u2022 Given by the Corporation at the election of its Annual Oilicers t Aldeburgh is one of those mockeries of Representation, that fiends two Members to Parh me .'.."], [54, "30 Who -still remain to hear .the ocean _oar, Whose greedy waves devour the lessening shore ; Till some fierce tide, with more imperious sway, Sweeps the low hut _nd all it holds away ; When the sad tenant weeps from door to door, And begs a poor protection from the poor.

At the Dissolution, the annual income was estimated at 318_ 17*. 2rt. Its site was granted send Henry VIII, to Thomas, Dike of Norfolk, and in Hie 36th of the of the same king to William Forth, in wbose family it long re mained. In 1737, George Wright, esq. whose property it then was, fitted up the Gate-House, and converted it into a handsome man sion, which has sirce been inhabited, as a shooting seat, by various persons of distinction. Mr Wright, at his death, left it to his widow, from whom it deeended to John Clyatt, a watchman in London, as heii-at-law ; and was by him sold to Mr. Strati* n, printer to his Majesty.

He added two tasteless wings to it, which are as yet unfinished, aud by him it was sr.ld, with the Rondlesham estates, to the father of the present uoble possessor. The Priory was both large and magnificent; its walls and ruins occupy nearly twelve acres. The Gate-House was an elegant struc ture. Its whole front is embellished with coats of arms finely cut in stone; and between the interstices of the free-stone are placed square black flints, which, by she contrast of the colour, give a very beautiful and rich appearance.

Honington will in future be celebrated as the birth place qf Robert Bloomfield, one of the simplest and most captivating qf our pastoral poets, and qf his brother the author qf the following elegy. A cottage near the church was inhabited by the family ; and the mother qf the poets finished her career under its friend ly roof, in the year 1804. The spot, which is the subject of this ballad, is less than has an acre. It was certainly an ornament to the village, and to the Bloomfields every circumstance gave it peculiar endear ment. There the author of \" The Farmer's Boy,\" and of this ballad, first drew breath: there grew the first daisies which their feet pressed in childhood. On this littk green their parents looked with delight ; and the children caught the affection, and learned to love it as soon as they loved any thing. As a poetical effusion, says Capel Lofft, it strikes me that this elegy has the tone, simplicity, sweetness, and pleasing melancholy qf the ballad. There is a stroke or two of indignant severity : but the general character is such as I have described. And with filial gratitude and love there is blended, at the close, that turn for reflection, which is so remarkable in this author. A view qfthe Church and Green is prefixed to this poem. The proud City's gay wealthy train, Who nought but refinements adore, May wonder to hear me complain That Honington Green is no more; But if to the Church your e'er went, If you knew what the village has been. You will sympathize, while I lament The Enclosure of Honington Green."], [58, "34 That no more upon Honington Green Dwells the Matron whom most I revere, If, by pert observation unseen, I e'en could indulge a fond tear. Ere her bright morn of life was o'ercast, When my senses first woke to the scene, Some short happy hours she had past On the margin of Honington Green. Her parents with plenty were blest, And nuro'rou . her children, and young, Youth's blossoms her cheek yet possest, And melody woke when she sung : A Widow so youthful to leave, (Early clos'dthe blest days he had seen) My Father was laid in his grave, In the Church-yard on Honington Green. I faintly remember the Man, Who died when I was but a child ; But far as my young mind could scan, His manners were gentle and mild: He won infant ears with his lore, Nor let young ideas run wild, Tho' his hand the severe rod of pow'r Never sway'd o'er a trembling child. Not anxiously careful for pelf, Melancholic and thoughtful, his mind Look'd inward and dwelt on itself, Still pensive, pathetic, e.nd kind : Yet oft in despondency drown 'd, He from friends, and from converse would fly. In weeping a luxury found, And reliev'd others' woes with a sigh."], [59, "35 In -solitude long would he stay, And long lock'd in silence his tongue ; Then he humm'd an elegiac lay. Or a psalm penitential he sung : But if with his friends he regal'd, His mirth, as his griefs knew no bounds; In no Tale of Mark Sargent he faild, Nor in all Robin Hood's Derry-downs. Thro' the poor Widow's long lonely years, Her Father supported us all : Yet sure she was loaded with cares, Being left with six children so small. Meagre want never lifted her latch ; Pier cottage was still tight and clean ; And the casement beneath it's low thatch Commanded a view o'er the Green : O'er the Green, where so often she blest The return of a husband or son, Coming happily home to their rest, At night, when their labour was done : Where so oft in her earlier years. She, with transport maternal, has seen (While plying her housewifely cares) Her children all safe on the Green. The Green was our pride through the year : For in Spring, when the wild flow'rets blew. Tho' many rich pastures were near, Where cowslips and daffodils grew; And tho' such gallant flow'rs were our choice. It was bliss interrupted by fear \u2014 The fear of their Owner's dread voice, Harshly brawling \" You've no business here.'"], [60, "36 While the Green, tho' but daisies it's boast, Was free as the flow'rs to the bee ; In all seasons the Green we lov'd most, Because on the Green we were free ; 'Twas the prospect that first met my eyes, And memory still blesses the scene; For early my heart learnt to prize The freedom of Honington Green. No peasant had pin'd at his lot, Tho' new fences the lone heath enclose ; For, alas ! the blest days are forgot, When poor men had their sheep and their cows- Still had Labour been blest with Content, Still Competence happy had been, Nor Indigence utter'd a plaint, Had Avarice spar'd but the Green, Not Avarice itself could be mov'd By desire of a morsel so small : It could not be lucre he lov'd ; But to rob the poor folk of their all. He in wantonness ope'd his wide jaws, As a Shark may disport with the Fry ; Or a Lion, when licking his paws, May wantonly snap at a Fly. Could there live such an envious man, Who endur'd not the halcyon scene, When the infantine peasantry ran, And roll'd on the daisy-deck'd Green. Ah ! sure 'twas Envy's despite, Lest Indigence tasted of bliss, That sternly decreed they've no right To innocent pleasure like this."], [61, "37 Tho' the youth of to-day must deplore The rough mounds that now sadden the scene. The vain stretch of Misanthrophy's power, The enclosure of Honington Green : Yet when not a green turf is left free, When not one odd nook is left wild, Will the children of Honington be Less blest than when I was a child ? No ! \u2014 childhood shall find the scene fair: Then here let me cease my complaint ; Still shall health be inhal'd with the air, Which at Honington cannot be taint: And tho' Age may still talk of the Green, Of the Heath, and free Commons of yore, Youth shall joy in the new-fangled scene, And boast of that change we deplore. Dear to me was the wild-thorny hill ; And dear the brown heath's sober scene: And youth shall find happiness still, Tho' he roves not on common or green : Tho' the pressure of wealth's lordly hand Shall give emulation no scope, And tho' all the appropriate land Shall leave Indigence nothing to hope. So happily flexile man's make, So pliantly docile his mind, Surrounding impressions we take, And bliss in each circumstance find. The youths of a more polish'd age Shall not wish these rude commons to see; To the bird that's inur'd to the cage, It would not be bliss to be free. n"], [62, "38 VERSES WRITTEN AT DUNWICH. BY HENRY DELL. Dunwich, once an important, opulent and commer cial city, but now a mean village, stands on a cliff of considerable height, commanding an extensive view of the German ocean. The present ruinous state of this once flourishing place is oiving chiefly lo the repeated encroachments of the sea. Seated upon a hill composed of loam and sand of a loose texture, on a coast desti tute of rocks, it is not surprising that its buildings should have successively yielded to the impetuosity of the billows, breaking against, and easily under mining the foot of the precipices ; anil probably in a few years they may oblige the constituent body to betake themselves lo a boat, whenever the king's writ shall summon them to the exercise qf their elective franchise; as the necessity qf adhering to forms, in the farcical solemnity qf borough elections, is not to be dispensed with. This town once contained eight parish churches ; three chapels ; a house belonging lo the knights templars ; two monasteries ; and two hos pitals ; and a mint. All Saints is now the only church qf which any portion remains. Informer times a wood, called east wood or the king's forest, extended several miles south-east qfthe town, but it has been for many ages swallowed up by the sea. Contiguous to this was another wood, from its relative situation denominated west wood. Though many qfthe traditionary accounts relative to this town are probably fabulous, yet it is certain that it is a place of very high antiquity. It is conjectured by some to have been a station qf the Ro- mans from the number qf their coins that have been discovered here. So much is certain, that in the reign of Sigebert, king qf the East Angles, Felix, the Bur gundian bishop, fixed his episcopal see at Dunwich in the year 636; and here by succession it continued for about two hundred years. In 1754 was published in 4-to \"An Historical Ac \" count cf Dunwich, fye. by Thomas Gard-ner, \" illustrated with copperplate.s ;\" which has now become the scarcest qfthe Suffolk Topographical works."], [63, "39 Ye venerable walls with ivy crown'd, The sad remains of ancient Gothic state, Whose scatter'd honors, strew thehallow'd ground; The spoils of time and unrelenting fate. Thy pomp, thy pow'r, O Dunwich, now's no more; .Lost is thy splendor, sunk in endless night; Fair trade and commerce have forsook thy shore, And all thy pristine glories vanish'd quite. Thy pleasant hills, thy vales, thy rich domains, The sea's devouring surge hath wash'd away; Disclosed the graves,* and gave their last remains To the remorseless waves, a fated prey. Ah what avails that once those sacred dead, Supreme in arts, and arms, or glory shone? Alas how vain ! each high distinction's fled, And all their blooming honors now are gone. All sublunary things thus pass away, Old ocean's self, shall thus a period find; The cloud-capt tow'rs, the pompous domes decay, All, all dissolve, nor leave a wreck behind. Here oft the Muse with rapture loves to stray, And o'er these ruins, far from noise and folly, Thro' solitary glooms, she takes her way, In pensi ve mood, indulging melancholy. Beneath these moss-grown stones, the waste of years, Lies many a heart now mouldered into dust, Whose kindred spirits grace the angelic spheres ; Completely blest, and perfect with the just. * By the continual falling of the cliff, the remains of the dead are frequently washed from the repositories, and scattered upon the beach. n 2"], [64, "40 Like me, they flourish'd once in youthful bloom Now cold and silent in the peaceful urn ; Like them, I soon must pass death's cheerless gloom.

The banks of this beautiful river are in general highly picturesque, especially when it becomes an \u00c6stuary at Downkam Reach, about three or four miles below Ipswich; to which place it is navigable for ships of considerable burthen. The banks there rise into pleasing elevations, clothed with a rick luxuriancy qf wood, and adorned with several good seats : and the river assumes the feature qf a large lake, being to all appearance land-locked on every side. Vessels fitted up for the accommodation qf passengers sail every tide from Ipswich to Harwich, a distance of about twelve miles, and back again; an excursion that is render- ed truly delightful by the beauty of the surrounding scenery. The port qf Ipswich is almost dry at ebb ; but the returning tide generally rising about twelve feet, con verts it into a magnificient sheet qf water. Orwell, delightful stream, whose waters flow Fring'd with luxuriant beauty to the main ! Amid thy woodlands taught, the Muse could fain, On thee, her grateful eulogy bestow. Smooth and majestic though thy current glide, * And bustling Commerce plough thy liquid plain ; Tho' grac'd with loveliness thy verdant side, While all around enchantment seems to reign:"], [65, "41 These glories still, with filial love, I taste, And feel their praise; \u2014 yet thou hast one beside To me more sweet ; for on thy banks reside, Friendship and Truth combin'd; whose union chaste Has sooth'd my soul ; \u2014 and these shall bloom sublime, When fade the fleeting charms of Nature and of Time. STANZAS Addressed to the Inhabitants qf Yoxford, in 1787. BY ANN CANDLER, A SUFFOLK COTTAGER. Yoxfordisa remarkably pkasant village, situatedabout four miles to the north of Saxmundham, on the Yar- mouth road. On the north side qf it is Cockfield Hall, formerly the seat qfthe Brook family, but now the resi- dence of sir Charles Blois, bart. Here is also the neat mansion of David Elisha Davy, esq. receiver general of the land-tax for the eastern division of the county. This gentleman, in conjunction with Henry Jermyn, of Sibton, esq. has been long engaged in the compila- tion of a \"History of Suffolk,\" a work devoutly to be wished, and for the compklion of which their valuable and abundant collections, as well as their extensive knowkdge in the antiquities and topography qf the county, render them folly competent. That Suffolk should have remained so long without its legitimate historian, a county so respectable for its antiquities, and presenting so many topics qf useful amusive specu- lation, may justly be esteemed a matter qf surprise. Dear village ! sweet delightful spot! Blest scene that gave me birth ! Though now, alas! unknown, forgot, I wander o'er the earth.

And ye, who in this darling spot, Securely dwell serene, Be ev'ry bliss in life your lot, And pleasure paint each scene. Still unembitter'd may you taste The sweets of health and peace ; While plenty decks the choice repast, And Ceres gives increase.

The River Gippin has its source at a small village in the centre of the county, near Stowmarket; io which it gives its name. Running in a south-east direction, it waters Ipswich ; and assuming below that town the nanui of Orwell, proceeds to meet the Stour opposite Harwich. It was made navigable from Stowmarket to Ipswich in 1793. It is sixteen miles in length, and has fifteen locks, each sixty feet long, and fourteen wide; three built, with timber, and twelve with brick and stone. The total expence incurred in the undertaking was \u00a326,380. The charges for the conveyance of goods upon it are one penny per ton per mile, from Stow lo Ipswich, and half as much from the latter town to Stowmarket. Some idea may be formed qf the bene ficial effects qf this navigation, from the statement, that soon after its completion, it had reduced the price qf land-carriage more than one half, and the carriage only upon coals four shillings per chaldron, and con- sequently raised the rent qf land considerably. Meandering Gippin, loveliest stream, That ever roll' cl its limpid flood Through many a rich sequestered mead, And many an overhanging wood, \u2022 These lines were occasioned by reading a paragraph in the Ipswich Journal, that the inhabitants of Yoxford intended to peti tion parliament for a charter to hold a weekly market, whether such a petition were pieseuted I know not. D 4"], [68, "44 l, I owe thee much ; thy gentle tide Deserves what I can ne'er bestow, To flow along immortal lines, As sweetly as thy waters flow. O ! had I those fame-giving powers, Which Collins or which Gray may claim, Poets unborn should haunt thy springs, And grace their poems with thy name. Oft, when above the eastern clouds The sun hath peer'd in glorious pride, Rapt in some sweet poetic dream, I have wander'd by thy willowy side, And, while the linnet and the thrush Have warbled sweet their wood-notes wild Indulg'd the scene that fancy ting'd, And many a fragrant hour beguil'd. Oft, in the fervid blaze of noon, Sinking beneath the sultry gleam, I've plung'd with Hope's impatient spring, In thy invigorating stream ; Plung'd \u2014 and, while sporting in thy waves, Derided disappointed Pride; And with the vile and stagnant bath Compar'd thy pure translucent tide. Oft, too, in summer's evening mild I've glided by thy bending shores, Wafted along by gentle gales, Or speeded by the dashing oars :"], [69, "45 Till winding by some craggy steep, With spreading foliage richly crown'd, I've slack'd the Nautilus's * course, To gaze upon the scenery round ; While not a murmur hath disturb'd The evening calm, serenely still, Save, now and then, the woodman's axe, And, now and then, the liquid trill. Farewell, lorn stream, a long farewell ! Fled are those charms these sighs deplore : . Those virgin charms, which rifled once, Are doom'd, alas ! to bloom no more. BARNHAM WATER, BY ROBERT BLOOMFIELD, Barnham Water is a small rivulet, which crosses the road from Euston to Thetford; it is in the midst qf a \"bkak, unwooded scene,\" and justifies the poet's lamentation in its full extent. In this neighbour hood, is a row often or eleven tumuli qf various size, which mark the scene of a most sanguinary engagement in 871, in which the Danes under Inguar, their leader defeated and afterwards put to death Edmund, the last qfthe East Anglian kings, destroyed the town qf Thetford, and massacred its inhabitants. The bodies qf those, who were slain in this dreadful and decisive conflict, were interred in these tumuli. \u2022 A favourite little boat of the authors. . In the yearl\"93 the Gippin was converted into a navigable canal."], [70, "46 Castle Hill and its appurtenances which Bloomfield calls the \"Danish mounds,\" are supposed by some lo have been raised by the Danes, previously to the battle, as an annoyance lo the town, and by others to have been the work qfthe East Anglian kings. Here was a camp qf extraordinary strength, with this prodigious mount in the middle : on its summit is a deep cavity, in wliich a number of men may stand entirely concealed. It is judged to be the largest artificial mount in this kingdom, and is surrounded by three ramparts, which were formerly divided by ditches: the ramparts are still in good preservation. The mount is about 100 feet in height, and the circuinference at the base 984 ; its diameter measures 338 feet at its base, and 81 on the summit. The enclosing ramparts are still nearly 20 feel high, and their ditches at bottom 60 to 70 feet wide. The ditch round the mount measures 42 feet wide at the bottom. The wkole qf these works is a mixture of clay and masses of chinch. Fresh from the Hall of Bounty sprung,* With glowing heart and ardent eye, With song and rhyme upon my tongue. And fairy visions dancing by, The mid-day sun in all his pow'r The backward valley painted gay ; Mine was a road without a flower, Where one small streamlet cross'd the way. What was it rous'd my soul to love ? What made the simple brook so dear ? It glided like the weary dove, And never brook seem'd half so clear. \u00bb On a sultry afternoon, late in the summer of 1802, Enston-llall lay in my way to Thetford, which place 1 did not reach until the evening, on a visit to my sister : the lines lose much of their interest exeept they could be read on the spot, or at least at a corresponding se_son of the year. . b"], [71, "47 Cool pass'd the current o'er my feet, Its shelving brink for rest was made, But every charm was incomplete, For Barnham Water wants a shade. There, faint beneath the fervid sun, I gaz'd in ruminating mood ; For who can see the current run And snatch no feast of mental food ? \" Keep pure thy soul,\" it seem'd to say, \" Keep th_t fair path by wisdom trod, * That thou may'st hope to wind thy way \" To fame worth boasting, and to God.\" Long and delightful was the dream, A waking dream that fancy yields, Till with regret I left the stream And plung'd across the barren fields ; To where of old rich abbeys smil'd* In all the pomp of gothic taste, By fond tradition proudly styl'd, The mighty \" City in the East.\" Near, on a slope of burning sand, The shepherd boys had met to play, To hold the plains at their command, And mark the traveler's leafless way. \u2022Thetford was formerly the metropolis of the kingdom of the East Angles ; and in the twelfth century the See of a P.ishop, and a place of considerable note, with twei.ty churches, (two of which now only remain) six religious houses, and five hospitals.

COBBOLD, OF HOLY WELLS, IPSWICH. During the latter part qfthe Anglo-Saxon dynasty, the Danes, ivho had become a powerful people in the north, turned their attention southward, and at various times invested these coasts with a view qf finally getting possession qfthe country. Suffolk shared largely in the general calamity, resulting from the depredatory in- cursions qf these lawless plunderers. Within the space qf ten years, they pillaged the town of Ipswich twice ; first in or about the year 991/ and again in 1000. In 1000 Ulfketel, desirous qf restoring the fortunes cf his degraded country, risked a battle with the Danes"], [74, "50 at Nacton, but his vigorous and persevering courage proved unavailing. He sustained a signal defeat; and the Danish triumphs we're complete. The whole qf East Anglia was over-run; neither towns nor churches were spared, unless redeemed by the inhabitants with large sums qfnumey; apid tire most dreadful outrages were every where committed. The scene of this legend is in Wykes, a hamlet in the parish of St. Clement, Ipswich, which was given. by Richard I. to John Oxenforde, one qf the founders of Trinity Priory in that town, bishop qf Norwich, and author of an history cf England down to his own time. The hamlet and mujior, from this circumstance, received the appellation of Wykes Bishop, and belonged to the see qf Norwich till 1535, when they were given by act of parliament to Henry Fill, who granted them in 1545 to sir John Jennie, knt. Whilst in the posses sion of the bishops, they used frequently to reside at their house here, which was situated on Ike south side qf the road leading from Bishop's Hill towards Nacton. A square mound indicates ike site qfthe house, and some beautfully clear springs, gushing out qf an adjacent hill, on the estate of John Cobbold, esq. still retain the appellation qf \" Holy Wells.\" Many institutions, fye. are said in the books at Norwich to have been granted at this place. The churck qf Wykes is sometimes mentioned in old writings, but it is not known /where it stood; and possibly it might be no more than a chapel for the use qfthe bishop and his attendants. Long had the battle doubtful stood ; The sick'ning sun, from fields of blood, In western clouds withdrew his light, When conquest crown'd the wav'ring fights And swift, athwart the sandy plain, The Angles chae'd-the routed Dane. On silken banner bath'd in gore An aged chief the raven bfli;e;"], [75, "51 Short his retiring step, and slow, And oft he turn'd to face the foe : His strength, by bleeding gashes quell'd* A youthful squire as oft upheld, Who, though no dark'ning down began To shade his cheek and write him man. Now prov'd himself, in early fight. A henchman brave, for bravest knight. The victor bands that round them clos'd That gallant pair awhile oppos'd, Then fainting in the conflict vain, Fell, breathless, on a hill of slain. And kites and crows a requiem sung O'er Hurder bold and Ivan young. Through clouds in heavy volumes roll'd, Pale gleam'd the moon on corses cold, Tliick strewing all the heathy bed 'Twixt Deben's wave and Orwell's spread.'\" O'er Ivan's cheek, as marble pale, Reviving swept the midnight gale. And rouz'd his soul from sickly trance To mem'ry's pang and horror's glance : In speechless agony he prest Brave Hurder's Up, and gory breast, And thought he felt, in doubtful strife. One faint short throb of ling'ring life: By hope with sudden strength endued, The boy like young Alcides stood ; From death's cold heap, with sinewy force He bore that pale and bleeding corse, And rent.his vest, and scarf, and bound With tender care each gaping wound. \u2022 See note at page 16."], [76, "52 O could the youth those gashes lave, In bubbling fount or limpid wave, Then might return life's gentle heat, Then life's soft pidse distinctly beat : But o'er that wild and barren sand No fountain cheers the thirsty land ; The weary shephel'd on the plain, For shade and streamlet sighs in vain. With patient step, those desarts o'er, His precious burthen Ivan bore, And faint with toil the stripling grew When Yppe's turrets rose to view : Here wooded hills, with yielding brow, Slop'd to the Orwell's wave below, And bright the moon's emerging beam With trembling radiance mark'd the stream. While dark and broad her shadows fell O'er deep ravine and bushy dell. As Ivan paus'd, a murmur near Of gushing waters met his ear, With cheering note of holy bell From chapel lone or hermit's cell, And through the dark wood's deepest shade The taper's glimmering radiance play'd. With every failing nerve new strung, To Use, to hope, the mourner clung, And firmer bore his charge, and toil'd Adown that pathway rough and wild ; Nor flinty rock, nor tangled briar, Might stay his step, or courage tire, Till, reach'd the the hermit's mossy cell, Prone, fainting, on the floor he fell. A sage had fix'd his dwelling there For pensive solitude and pray'r ;"], [77, "53 A rugged chasm, by time, or shock Of nature, channel'd in the rock, Though sylvan art had grac'd the room With rustic portico and dome Of arching chesnuts roughly hewn, And couch of roots, with rushes strewn ; While from its side a gushing rill Roll'd, murmuring, down the rocky hill. This silent hour the sage had given To breathe his oraisons to heaven ; His sainted look might fitly shew How resignation tempers woe ; Devotion pure and zeal refined Had raised to heav'n his ardent mind : But when his glance, in soften'd mood, That youth and bleeding warrior view'd, The tears that pity's eyelids fill, The nurse's care, the leech's skill; All prov'd his heart was human still. Wash'd in that fountain's crystal tide, Each healing balm with pray'rs applied, And gently laid on bed of rushes, Soft breathing sighs, and frequent flushes, O'er Ivan's cheek began to spread Of life and health the mantling red : But Hurder's eye, in sullen glare, Rejected hope and wooed despair, While frenzy's accents on his tongue With imprecating horror hung. \" Ah cease, rash man ! \" exclaim'd the sage, \" And calm thy bosom's impious rage, \"For know, if wounded christian lave, \" His gashes in this blessed wave, E"], [78, "54 -> \u2022' They meet no ling'ring doubtful cure, \" His life is safe, his healing sure : \" With Hermit's pray'rs and hermit's skill \" I bath'd you hi the holy rill.\" \" For christian flow these waters free \" With healing pow'r ? Then not for me.\u2014 \" Yet greets my heart the boon they give, \" My Ivan, gallant boy ! shall live ; \" For he of christian parents born, \" By spoil from Britain's coast was torn. \u2014 \" For me thy saintly pray'rs are vain ; \" Black Hurder I, the pirate Dane.\" \" The pirate Hurder ? O'er my soul \" Again the storm is doom'd to roll ! \" Be hush'd my wrongs ; revenge, be still \" Ah heaven, restrain my wand'ring will ! \" Speak, tell me, ere thy wasting breath \" Be captiv'd in the pangs of death, \" Say, who this youth, whose glances dart \" Tumultuous throbbings to my heart ? \" \" I know not : \u2014 from your eastern shore \" His mother, with the boy, I bore, \" Of beauty meet for Hurder's bride, \" But she with scorn my suit denied, \" Plung'd, desp'rate, in the raging sea, \" And fled from life, to fly from me. \" Ask not if Hurder knew remorse :\u2014 \" I train'd the boy in honour's course \" And christian lore ; 'twas all I could, \" And lov'd him, as a father would !"], [79, "55 \" O spare me, death, \u2014 a moment more, \u2014 \" A ruby on his neck he wore \" Enchas'd in gold, and on his arm \" Some skilfid hand, for spell or charm, \" Had, with indelible emboss, \" In punctur'd stains pourtray'd the cross. \" Forgive me, Ivan, darling boy ! \" Thy hand, dear youth, \u2014 I faint ; I die.\" In one deep sigh the spirit fled, And Hurder rested with the dead. On Ivan's neck the hermit hung ; To Ivan's breast enraptur'd clung, And wept, and sobb'd in transport wild. \" O Sigebert ! my child ! my child ! \" For Heav'ns best gift restor'd, to Heav'n \" The sacrifice of praise be given ! \" Record my vow, ye Saints, to found \" A chapel on this hallow'd ground, \" And consecrate the Holy Well \" With shrine and altar, book and bell. \" Here youths shall chaunt the choral lay ; \" Here rev'rend priests devoutly pray ; \" And matin song, and vesper rite, \" Salute the morn, and bless the night.\" Soon rose from earth the sacred fane, And sweetly breath'd the pious strain : That fane, as circling seasons flew, In fame, in wealth, in splendor grew, And shrine, and church, and holy ground, A bishop's stately palace crown'd. But time, with silent slow decay, Sweeps earthly pomp and pride away ; Nor church, nor palace, now are known By massy wall, or mould'ring stone ; e 2"], [80, "56 A moated square just marks the scite Of mitred state, and splendid rite : Yet pure and bright the living rill Rolls down the alder-skirted hill, And fancy loves to linger here, And paints the past, in vision clear, As, whispering, to the muse she tells The legend of the Holy Wells. LINES, WRITTEN ON LEAVING IPSWICH. Ipswich is an ancient and populous, but an irregu lar built town, happily situated on the side of a hill, with a southern aspect, declining by an easy descent to the river Orwell, near the place where the fresh and salt water meet; and forming a sort of half moon or crescent on its bank. It contains twelve parish churches, a spacious market place, a corn exchange, a custom house with a good quay, theatre, assembly and subscription rooms, free grammar school, shire hall, county and borough goal, house of correction, barracks for cavalry, fye. The streets are well pav ed, but, like those of most ancient towns which have not suffered by fire, are narrow and irregular ; and con sequently do not make such a striking appearance, as if they ran in right lines. At the corners qf many qf them are yet to be seen the remains of curious carved images, grotesque figures, arms, flowers, fye. and great numbers qf the houses are adorned, some qf them to profusion, in a similar manner. The town contains many good buildings ; and an advantage which it pos sesses in a high degree is, that most qf these, even in the heart qfthe place, have convenient gardens adjoin ing, which render them not only more agreeable, but the town Uses more airy and salubrious. It has de clined from Ms former consequence; the manufactures of broad cloth and canvas being at an end ; and its"], [81, "57 present commerce chiefly depends upon the malting and exportation qf corn. It has, however, a considerable coasting trade, and a small share of foreign commerce. Several views qf Ipswich have been at different times published. Oh Ipswich ! sweet scene of my juvenile hours, Thy pleasures recede from my view, To thy grass cover'd meads, embroidered with flowers, I bid a reluctant adieu. Ye scenes of my childhood, I bid you farewel, With smiles that my anguish conceal, But the heart's secret pain sighs unbidden tell, These tears its reluctance reveal. I go where bright science her standard has plac'd, And commerce extends her wide sail, Where beauty is deck'd by the finger of taste, And elegance throws off her veil. Yet wantthesegay scenesthedear charms of that spot, Where childhood, sweet era, was past ; Oh Ipswich ! thy pleasures will ne'er be forgot, Long as mem'ry's tablet shall last. I view thy green meads as the land of my youth, Ere sorrow this breast did invade, Ere yet I had prov'd the too sorrowful truth, Life's landscape is chequer'd with shade. How sweet to reflection now rises each hour, Spent under the shade of thy trees ; The past seizes on me with syren like power, Forbidding the present to please : E 3"], [82, "58 To fancy how bright are the days that are flown, All sorrow from them is effac'd ; O'er them what illusions remembrance has thrown. Past years with what colours are grac'd. Oh mem'ry ! thy magic beguilements give o'er, For sick'ning to truth I return, She tells me of those time nor place can restore, Who sleep 'neath the cold marble urn. Ah! where are the friends that made childhood so blest, Do they still in Ipswich remain ? Ah no ! they are gone to the mansions of rest. All senseless of pleasure or pain. Yet dear to my heart are the friends that are left, Nor few to my bosom are given, Of those that are gone, though now I am bereft. Faith whispers I meet them in heaven. LINES WRITTEN AT SOUTHWOLD, OCTOBER, 1809- Sonthwold is pleasantly situated on a cliff or point qf land, near a fine bay, at the mouth qf the river Blythe, which here discharges itself into the sea. The church, dedicated to St. Edmund, is supposed lo have been finished about 14fi0, and is a very fine fabric. Its total length is 143 feet 6 inches, audits width 56 feet 2 inches. It has two aisles, which are separated from the nave by seven arches, and six pillars of elegant workmanship. The tower, about 100 feet in height, is a fine piece qf architecture, beautified withfreestone,"], [83, "59 intermixed with flint of various colours. The porch is highly ornamented : over the entrance is a vacant niche, which is decorated in various parts with gothic letters, similar to those qf the inscription upon the arch over the great west window qfthe tower : SA T. EDMUND. ORA. P. NOBIS. ' Every letter is sur mounted by a crown. The north door has a niche on cither side, with a figure on each, resembling an angel with prodigious wings in a kind qf pulpit, and the hands joined as if in the attitude qf prayer. The pillars, supporting these niches, rise from grotesque heads. The mouldings between the receding arches qf all the doors are ornamented with foliage, flowers, grotesque heads and figures ; as is also the fillet that runs round the body qfthe church .above the windows. The interior qf this edifice still indicates that it was yet more highly ornamented than the exterior. The carved work qfthe rood-loft, and the seats qf the magistrates, now somewhat defaced, originally bore a great resem blance to those in Henry VHth's chapel at Westminster. Every pew was likewise decorated withfigures qf birds, beasts, satyrs, fye. The ceiling of 'the chancel is hand somely painted, as is likewise thai over the skreen in the nave. As the beach here partakes of the advantages enjoyed by other towns on this coast for sea-bathing, it hasqflate years derived considerable advantage from the visitors, who resort thither during the summer season for that purpose, and for whose accommodation two convenient machines arc kept in the toivn. It has been remarked, that at this town in particular, us at all the places on this coast, the swallows commonly first land on their arrival in England, and hence also they take their departure on their return to warmer climates. Both the church and town have been fre- quently engraved. Southwold, all hail ! peace to thy billowy shore ; In vain may tempests rage or ocean roar, Thy verdant cliffs still bless the seaman's eye, Thy genial gales still health and ease supply : e 4"], [84, "60 Still may thy sons, an active gen'rous train, Guide the frail bark in safety thro' the main ; And home returning, with delight and joy Embrace the faithful wife, the blooming boy. Yes, their's the bliss domestic love imparts, Unknown to sordid minds and venal hearts. Though Vice, with giant strides, throughout the land Extends her sway, and boasts supreme command, When far remov'd my ling'ring fancy strays O'er the memorials of departed days, Southwold shall rise to memory ever dear, For worth and virtue yet are cherish'd here. HAVERHILL, BY MR. JOHN WEBB. The following lines are extractedfrom a beautifully descriptive poem, entitled \"Haverhill by John Webb, 1810,\" lZtno; a poem, in which the author has ii fus ed a considerable portion qfthe spirit and pathos, which so strongly characterize the \" Deserted Village.\" Mr. Webb is a native qf Haverhill, and has added another name lo the respectable list qf those poets, who have not been indebted to education, and are usually, although very improperly, called \" self taught poets.\" In the preface lo his poem he informs his readers that, \" born in the vale qf obscurity, he never experienced \" any qf the benefits that result from education : his \" days have been spent in scenes of honest industry, and \" his leisure intervals devoted to amusive and inslruc \" live studies : \" To him 'twas giv'n \u2014 whom Fortune lov'd to lead \"Through humble toils, to life's setpicsler'd bow'rs \u2014 \" To him 'twas giv'n to wake the self taught reed, \" And soothe with song the solitary hours.\" W HITEHEAD."], [85, "61 *' Though he is conscious that these humble essays \" at poetry will, like the sensitive plant, shrink from \" the touch qf criticism, yet he fondly hopes that it will \" tend to smooth the critic's rugged brow, to be iiform \" ed that they were written while the author moved in \" the humble sphere qf a journeyman weaver.\" The beauties qfhis native place the author appears to have viewed with a picturesque eye, and to have de scribed with a poetic spirit. In his descriptions qf artificial life and manners, and in his delineations qf local characters, he is equally as just and as successful, as in his paintings of natural objects and qf rustic scenery. His poetry is generally qf the pensive cast, but every where gives a most favorable idea qfhis taste and his reflection; qf one, who has had the wisdom to employ his talent without the extravagant aberrations which would interrupt the business qf life, and the exercise qf honest industry. The whole impression qfthe poem has been long sold ; and as its intrinsic excelknce so well merits a more general and extensive circulation, it is to be hoped that Mr. Webb will feel disposed to favor the public with a second edition, Enlarged. Hail ! Haverhill,* hail ! a Muse, who knows no rules, Unskill'd in language, and untaught in schools ; To whom proud Science never lent a ray Of classic light to gild her artless lay ; Would in her rustic song thy hist'ry trace, And from oblivion snatch thy lowly race. Hail ! Haverhill, hail ! What though thy humble name Ne'er grae'd the annals of historic fame : * Haverhill is a small market town, with a manifacture of checks, cottons, and fustians. The principal street, which is partly in this county, and partly in Essex, is long and wide, but the hou_s in general are mean and shabby. The Church is a large ancient structure, but offers nothing remarkable to the attention of the antiquary. The town likewise contains two Mei t ing Houses, and a Charity School, and was formerly of much greater extent ; the ruins of another Church aud of a Castle being .still visible."], [86, "62 f _ What though thy shallow streams that creep along Have never murmur'd in the poet's song ; Nor ever bard has wak'd his tuneful powers, To paint thy meadows with poetic flowers ; Yet shall thy streams and meads my Muse inspire With simple hand to strike her self-taught lyre. Ye rural scenes, by mem'ry long rever'd, By many a tender sympathy endear'd ; Your grassy lanes, gay pathways, towering trees, Still do they boast a charm \u2014 the power to please. Yes, native bowers, your sylvan haunts among I first invok'd the fabled Nymphs of song : Strung my rude harp, when but a simple child, And fondly warbled forth my \" wood-notes wild.\" Hail, long known spot ! paternal Dwelling, hail The neatest cot in Burton's rural vale. Though fairer mansions, prouder domes, I see, Still my fond heart with rapture turns to thee. Thy white-wash'd front, and little gay parterre, (Which owes its blossoms to a mother's care) ; Those box triangles, and those box-edg'd beds, Where Flora's blushing offspring lift their heads ; Those lilacs tall, and fruitful cherry-tree ; Though simple objects, still have \"charms for me. Nor let the Muse forget thy woodbine bower, Where pleasing studies wing'd the leisure hour ; Beneath whose canopy, with blooming maid, I've sat, till Vesper piere'd the leafy shade With his bright ray ; and pass'd, in converse sweet. Fair hours of bliss within thy green retreat. Not distant far, where yonder streamlet glides, Mid varied flowers which deck its shelvy sides, There stands a modest Structure,* neatly fair, Whose front displays no ostentatious glare. \u2022 Haverhill Place."], [87, "63 For use, not splendor, was the dome design'd, And form'd to please the unambitious mind. Yon lovely spot, where once rude nettles grew, Presents a little Eden to the view. Touch 'd by the hand of art, gay tribes arise, And Flora boasts her many-colour'd dyes. The white-thorn hedge, w ith shades of ever-green, Surrounds and decks the cultivated scene. If e'er I sigh for sublunary bliss, That sigh shall heave for such a home as this ; If e'er a wish within my bosom rise, That wish shall be for this small paradise. Beneath yon hedge some vestiges remain, Which mark the spot where stood an hallow'd Fane. But ah, how fall 'n ! Against Time's potent hand, Nor storm-proof tower, nor sacred dome can stand : The proudest palace, at th' appointed hour, Must prostrate fall, and own the tyrant's power. Now on this consecrated, still domain, Glad Ceres, smiling, views her yellow grain: Here oft the ploughshare, and the peasant's spade, The silent sabbath of the tomb invade ; Draw the dread curtain of the grave away, And rouse the drowsy tenants into day. O that some spirit of this ancient race, Would rise and tell the history of the place ; And to my mind, my curious mind ! unfold Some brief memorial of the days of old ; Tell why its guardian genius could not keep The holy pile from Ruin's ruthless sweep ! Yon verdant field, which claims my next regard, Still bears the homely name of \" Parson's Yard : \" There, free from storms that loftier roofs invest, The parsonage stood, where dwelt the village priest :"], [88, "64 But what his character, or what his name, Or whence he sprung, is now unknown to fame. Behold yon mean, though picturesque Abode, By brooklet parted from the public road ; Whose narrow bridge, compos'd of pole and plank, Supplies the means to reach the farther bank : Though unattractive to the vulgar view, This cot a titled artist's* pencil drew. Hail, shade obscure ! the poor man's calm retreat, Where labour makes the coarsest viands sweet ; -Where mild Content, with sacred Virtue join'd, Shed their soft sunshine on the humble mind. Proceed, my Muse, and quit this fatal dale To mount yon hill, and breathe a keener gale. There once a Castle rear'd its haughty brow, And frown'd defiance on the vale below : But built by whom, by Saxons or by Danes, By whom destroy' d, no record now remains. Swept by thy powerful wing, imperious Time ! Aloft in air no ruin nods sublime : No fractur'd pediment, nor shatter'd wall, In sullen silence waits its destin'd fall : No triflers here, of antiquarian breed, On wild Conjecture's airy morsels feed : O'er this lone scite no virtuoso pores, To add some rusty bauble to his stores. Haply this fortress, in its proudest hour, Could laugh a siege to scorn, like Macbeth's tower ; But now of former strength no trace is found, Save an old weedy moat, and earthy mound. But hark ! the noise which issues from on high, With din incessant, speaks \" the Rookery \" nigh : Here may I lie, on mossy bank reclin'd, And mark the manners of the sable kind. \u2022 Sir George Beaumont, bart."], [89, "65 From this amusive scene I bend my feet, T j view yon pleasure-ground and ancient Seat : * Enchanting spot ! inviting, sweet recess !

ROBERT BLOOMFIELD. The village qf Fakenham is situated in a pleasant valley, which is watered and fertilized by a branch qf the river Ouse. The meadows afford abundant pasture, and the neighbouring uplands are richly cultivated. The whole parish is the property of his Grace, the Duke qf Grafton, and furnished the scenes qf several qf the pieces of Bloomfield. In this village, nearly opposite to the church, is a cottage in which the Poet's mother was born. A Moated Eminence in this place is supposed to have been the scite of a Mansion, formerly destroyed by fire. Near the inner margin of the Moat still exist several decayed trees, the remains qfa circle qf Elms, that, according to the Poet, once completely surrounded Ike Mansion. His ideas qfthe hospitality of the place are most probably derived from some tradition still ex tant in the neighbourhood. On thy calm joys with what delight I dream, Thou dear green valley of my native stream ! Fancy o'er thee still waves th' enchanting wand- And every nook of thine is fairy land,"], [91, "67 And ever will be, though the axe should smite In Gain's rude service, and in Pity's spite, Thy clustering alders, and at length invade The last, last poplars, that compose thy shade : Thy stream shall then in native freedom stray, And undermine the willows in its way, These, nearly worthless, may survive this storm, This scythe of desolation call'd \" Reform.\" No army past that way ! yet are they fled, The boughs that, when a school-boy, screen'd my head : I hate the murderous axe ; estranging more The winding vale from what it was of yore, Than e'en mortality in all its rage, And all the change of faces in an age.

Opposite to Harwich, the river Orwell unites itself with the Stour, which rises on the western side of the county, atidjirst running southward to Haverhill, takes an eastern direction, and forms, throughout its whole course, the boundary between Suffolk and Essex. It passes by Sudbury ; and after being joined by the Bret and other smaller streams, receives the tide at Manningtree. The united waters of these rivers, having formed the port of Harwich, discharge them selves into the German Ocean, between that town, and Landguard Fort.

LINES Written on the Coast of Suffolk, AUGUST 27, 1793. Aldeburgh derives its name from the river Aide, and is pleasantly situated under the shelter of a steep hill, which runs north and south the whole length of the principal street, about three quarters of a mile. It was formerly a place of considerable importance, but re- peated incroachments of the sea have reduced it to the rank of a small fishing town. During the last century, the ocean made great ravages, and destroyed many houses, together with the market-place and cross. A plan of the town in 1559, which is still extant, proves it at that time to have been a place of considerable magnitude; and represents the Church as being at more than ten times its present distance from the shore ; and that there were Denes of some extent, similar to those at Yarmouth, between the town and the sea. At the northern extremity, on the summit of the hill, stands the Church, an ancient building, though very much intermixed with modern work, with a handsome Porch, on the south side. It contains no remarkable monuments; but there are some stones apparently of considerable antiquity in the church-yard, which, from its elevated situation, commands a magnificent view of the ocean. Near the Church stands a Marine Villa, built on an Italian plan, by __. Vernon, Esq. and much admired for a beautiful octagon room. At the extremity of the tmvn also, on the brow of the hill, are situated the"], [95, "71 mansion of the Hon. P. Wyndham ; and a romantic Cassino, the favorite summer-residence of the Marquis of Salisbury. At the opposite end of the terrace, is the seat of W. C. Crespigny, Esq. For the protection of the fishery and trading vessels on this coast, there is a battery of two eighteen pounders at the southern ex- tremity of the main street ; and a Martello tower on the beach, about three quarters of a mile further to the south, is intended to add to their security. This build- ing, though commenced some years ago, yet remains unfinished ; indeed the necessity and advantage of suck an expensive erection appear equally doubtful. The native inhabitants cf this place are chiefly fishermen.

Sfttgrriptim. FOR THE TOMB OF GUTHRUN THE DANE, In St. Mary's Church, Hadleigh; BY NATHAN DRAKE, M. D. Guthrum, Guthrun, or Gormo, the Dane, was one of those chieftains or sea-kings, who, towards the close of the ninth century, issuing from the heart of Scan dinavia, carried all the horrors of the most savage warfare throughout the coasts, and even the interior of England. Educated in the religion of Odin, the acknowledged god of slaughter and desolation, these fierce warriors conceived themselves alone entitled to happiness in ano ther world, in proportion to the violence of their own death, and the number of the enemy whom they had slain on the field of battle."], [97, "73 As in their ferocity, therefore, was founded their sense of virtue, and their hope of immortality , wecan 7iot wonder at the cruelties which marked their course. \" The cruel Guthrum,\" says one of our oldest histori ans, . arrived in England A. D. 878, at the head of an army of Pagan Danes, no less cruel than himself, who, like inhuman savages, destroyed all before them with fire and sword, involving cities, towns, and villa ges, with their inhabitants, in devouring flames ; and cutting those in pieces with their battle-axes, who attempted to escape from their burning houses. The tears, cries, and lamentations of men, women, and children, made no impressions on their unrelenting hearts; even the most tempting bribes, and the humblest offers of becoming their slaves, had no. effect. All the twvns through which they passed exhibited the most deplorabhz scenes of misery and desolation; as venerable obi men lying with their throats cut before their own doors ; the streets covered with the bodies of young men and children, without heads, legs, or arms ; and of matrons and virgins, who had been first publicly dis honoured, and then put to death*.\" It was into the camp of this ferocious leader of pi ratical invasion, that our patriot king, the unrivalled Alfred, was introduced, in the disguise of a harper ; a stratagem which, enabling him to detect the insecurity of his foes, and their want of discipline, led, very shortly afterwards, to their compleat defeat at Edding ton in Wiltshire. With Alfred the first result of victory was clemency and benevolence ; to Guthrun and his folhwers, now prostrate at his feet, he profered, not only mercy and forgiveness, but protection and territory, provided they would abandon paganism, embrace Christianity, and be regulated by the laws of civilized society. To these terms Guthrun joyfully , and, as the event proved, sincerely acceded, himself and thirty of his officers being immediately baptized in the presence of Alfred. Part of his army was sent into Northumber- land, and the remainder, with their chief and his \u2022 J. Walingford, apud Gale, torn. 1. p. 536. F 3"], [98, "74 retinue, settled in East Anglia, Guthrun fixing on the scite of Hadleigh, in Suffolk, as a central situation for his capital, or heapb-lieje. t Here he continued to reside and reign nearly eleven years, inviolably observing the laws and the religion of Alfred, and preserving his own people within the strictest bounds of peace and good order. No stronger proof, indeed, can be given of the integrity and fidelity of Guthrun, than that no sooner had he ceased to govern, than the Danes of East Anglia showed signs of turbu- lence and disaffection, and took the earliest opportunity of co-operating with their countryman Hastings, in his invasion of England, A. D. 893. Guthrun died, according to the testimony of history, a sincere convert to Christianity, about the year 889, and was buried within the ground now occupied by the present church of Hadleigh. An ornamental gothic arch, in the wall of the south aisle, is said to mark the grave where this celebrated warrior rests. It is evi- dently, however, of a date some centuries posterior to the age of him over whom it is placed, and was probably designed merely to rescue from oblivion the traditionary spot of his interment. In consequence of some repairs which, in 1 767, were carried on in this church, termed, in the will of Dr. Pykenham, Ecclesia Sanct\u0153 Mari\u00e6, the supposed tomb of Guthrun was opened ; when, deep beneath the surface, was discovered a massy grave of stone, the floor of which was tesselaled with small square glazed tiles, and covered with some light blue ashes ; circum- stances which seem to corroborate the record, and the local appropriation of antiquity. O stay thee, stranger, o'er this hallow'd ground In solemn silence pause ! Here sleeps the chief Whom royal Alfred, with a christian's zeal, From deeds of savage slaughter, from the rites Of Odin, bath'd in blood and breathing war, Turn'd to the living God : \u2014 Guthrun the Dane. t From this Saxon term head-liege, appears to have been derived the modern name of Hadleigh. Vide Weeve.s Funeral Monuments."], [99, "75 b Here oft, repentant of the erring course That stain'd his dawn of manhood, hath he bow'd His head in meekness ; with a pilgrim's faith Abjur'd the idols of his native land ; Pray'd for redeeming grace ; and, sighing deep, Dropp'd the lone tear upon his Saviour's cross : Then, hence retiring, with a patriot's care, Rul'd his brief realm, and kept his vow of peace. O ye, who, mid the strife of battle, burn With lust of fame or pow'r ! Say, have ye felt, E'en in the glow of conquest, when the car In triumph bore you o'er the tented field, Felt ye a throb of joy so keenly sweet. Such thrilling rapture as did Guthrun feel, When, free from ruthless rage, and thirst of blood The storm of vengeful passion lull'd to rest, Here, prostrate at St. Mary's shrine, he felt His heart within him yearning for his God. Go, stranger, if perchance to thee belong The honour'd name of father, teach thy sons, That not in deeds of rapine or of spoil, Pow'rs forceful arm, or vict'ry's crimson steel, Consists the virtue or the good of man ; That he, who bade them breathe and live, alone Looks on the heart, alone vouchsafes to dweU In that pure bosom, where, with peace, reside The sister-forms of piety and love."], [100, "76 an epistle TO CARTERET LEATHES, Esq. n. THE REV. WILLIAM BROOME, LL.D. The following unpublished poem of Broome's maybe considered as a literary curiosity. It is printed from a proof sheet, in the possession of the editor of this vo lume, with MS. additions in the hand-writing of the author, and apparently corrected by him for another volume of poems. William Broome was a native of Cheshire, and was educated on the foundation at Eton. He was after wards sent to St. John's College, Cambridge, by the contributions of his friends, and proceeded to the de gree of B.A. 1711. M.A. 1716. and LL.D. Com. Reg. 1728. In 1713 he was presented by lord Corn wallis to the rectory of Sturston, where he married a wealthy widow. In 1720 he was presented by his lordship, to whom he was chaplain, to the rectory of Oakley. In 1728 he was presented by the Crown to the rectory of Pulham, in Norfolk, which he at first held united with Oakley, and afterwards with the vicarage of Eye, to which he was presented in the same year 1728. He died at Bath Nov. l6th, 1745, and was interred in the abbey Church. Of Broome, says Dr. Johnson, though it cannot be said that he was a great poet, it would be unjust to deny that he was an excellent versifier ; his lines are smooth and sonorous, and his diction is select and ehzgant. His power of words and numbers fitted him for translation ; but in his original works, recollection seems lo have been his business more than invention. What he takes, however, he seldom makes worse; and he cannot be justly thought a mean man, whom Pope chose for an associate, and whose co-operation was considered by Pope's enemies as so"], [101, "77 important, that he was attacked by Henley with this ludicrous distich: \" Pope came off clean with Homer : but they say, \" Broome went before, and kindly swept lite way.\" His publications are\" A Miscellany of Poems, 1727-\" 8_o. \"A Sernwn preached at the Assizes in Norwich, \"Aug. 8th, 1737.\" 4/o, and \"A Coronation Sermon\" in 1727. He appeared early in the world as a translator of the Iliad into prose, in conjunction with Ozell and Oldisworth ; but how their several parts were distribu ted is not known : and in the volumes of poetry, pub lished by Lintot, commonly called \" Pope's Miscella nies,\" several of his early pieces were inserted. When the success of Pope's translation of the Iliad gave en couragement to a version of the Odyssey, Pope, weary of the toil, called Broome to his assistance, who trans lated eight books, viz. the 2nd, 6th, 8th, 11th, 12th, l6th, 18th, and 23rd; and wrote all the notes. Towards the close of his life, he amused himself with translating several of the odes of Anacreon, which are inserted in the Gent. Mag. under the signature of Chester. The air serene and calm, one summer's day, O'er Euston's spacious heath I took my way ; Where tim'rous hares their coverts sometimes make, And lie secure beneath the furze or brake : Where bleating sheep, not to be number'd, stray, Whose young and sportive lambs around 'em play j Then passing by that stately mansion,* where Extreme delights I've oft been wont to share ; * Huston was formerly the property of sir Ilenry Bennet, knt. who, for his adherence to the house of Stuart, was appointed secretary of state by Charles the 2nd, and created baron Arlington, vicount Thetford, and earl of Arlington. He built the hall; and left an only daughter and heiress, Isabella, who married Henry FiUroy, one of the natural children of Charles the Slid, by the duchess of Cleveland, who was created by his father earl of Euston, and duke of Grafton, and who by his marriage inherited Euston. The mansion is large and commodious, built with red brick, and destitute of superfluous decorations either within or without. t U almost surrounded by trees of uncommon growth, and of the matt"], [102, "78 Whether the Tudors portraits I beheld Down from the last Plantagenet reveal'd; Or the Charleses drawn by fam'd Vandike, Which connoisseurs have never fail'd to strike : Seeing each aweful and majestic grace, Finely exprest upon the monarch's face ; I forward rode, and cross'd a rapid rill, Whose streams o'erflowing Rushforth pastures fill ; Then soon subsiding fertilize the soil, And amply recompence the mower's toil ; Now Norfolk's wide champagne salutes the view, Affording pleasure in each prospect new : Here corn thick waving hides the furrow'd lands, And seems to court industrious reapers hands ; While careful farmers much exulting see The promis'd harvest with their wish agree.

Mr. Wyndham's pavilion is gracefully neat, And the Marquist may boast of his rural retreat. Mr. Vernon's parterres so luxuriantly bloom, That they vie with Arcadia's most fragrant perfume ; But friend Wade's pretty cottage, plac'd close to the sea, I declare, is a palace sufficient for me.

Our next route, my dear sister, 's intended for Harwich, So behold us at Ipswich remounting our carriage ; But, as travellers must frequently find to their cost, There's a proverb call'd Reckoning more fast than your host.

And now thro' a very deep water we glide, Whilst the sea roughly roUs with the swell of the tide ; For just at the junction of the Orwell and Stour Our two Charons were tugging at least half an hour; And the surge was so high when we got to the shore, That our landing detain'd us full ten minutes more. But now we're at Harwich, and thankful am I, Our inn's the Three Cups, and our dinner draws nigh- But first for a walk to survey this old borough, To peep at the church, and the church-yard go thorough.

Here for her sons a noble building * rais'd ; \u2022 Bury seems very early to have enjoyed the benefit of a Free School; for^abbot Sampson, in 1198, erected a school-house, and setUed a stipend on the master, who was required to give gratui tous instruction to forty poor boys. This building stood near the shire-hall, and the street received from it the name School-hall stieet, which it still retains. The Free Grammar School, founded by King Edward the 6th, seems to have been but a revival of the former ancient institution. Its original situation was in East-gate street, but that being found inconvenient, a new school-house was erected in North gate-street by public contribution. The bust of the founder stands over the door in the front ol the building; and under his arms, at the upper end of the school room, are these verses : Edvardns Sextus posuit Virtutis Alumnis. Gratis disce, puer, Regia namque Schola est. There are forty scholars on the foundation, and it is free for all the sons of towns-people, or inhabitants. This seminary is super intended by an upper and under master ; aud adjoining to the school is a handsome house for the former. The present head master is Benjamin Heath Malkin, D.

All other honors and emo luments he declined. Having withdrawn himself by degrees from public business, he spent the remainder of his life in an honorable retirement amongst his books and friends; and there prepared an elegant and correct edition of the works of Shakespeare.

The tombs and other memorials for the dead are extremely nume- rous, and contain various ancient inscriptions ; among others two epitaphs are deserving of notice for their remarkable singularity, viz : the one on Charles Gran- ger, a shoe-maker ; and the other on Joan Kitchen. There are two singular memorials likewise for persons, who had been midwives ; the one had brought into the world 2,237, and the other 4,323 living children. When the Abbey was in its prosperity, there were standing within the precincts of it three churches, be- sides the Abbey Church ; viz : St. Margaret's, St. Mary's, and St. James's. The remains of the west end of St. Edmund's, which bound the Church-yard on one side, exhibit a singular and motly appearance. One of the octagon towers, which formerly terminated either end, is still standing, and has been converted into a stable. Three arches, once the entrances to the three aisles, have been filled up with modern buildings, and converted into as many neat houses. In the Church- yard stands Clopton's Hospital, a handsome brick building with projecting wings, founded and endowed in 1 730, agreeably to the will of the late Poley Clapton, M. D. as an asylum for six poor men and as many women, three of either sex out of each parish. The front exhibits the arms of the founder ; and a Latin inscription below records the object of the institution. On the opposite side of the Church-yard stands the Shire Hall. It is a building of modern erection, on the site of the ancient Church of St. Margaret, and contains two convenient courts. The Church-gate is a noble specimen of Anglo-Saxon architecture. It stands opposite to t/ie west end of the Abbey Church, to which it served as a magnificent portal. It is 80 feet in height, of a quadrangular form, and remarkable for the simple plainness and solidity of its construction. The Church-yard has been frequently engraved."], [125, "101 Hail, sacred shade ! where, oft, in youthful sports My blissful hours of sweet retirement sped ; Far, from the busy croud, and noise of courts.

His character is pourtrayed, in the following lines, by his friend Mr. Stewart; \" Firm was his faith, from bigotry refin'd, His hand was liberal, as his heart was kind; Bv friends respected, by his flock rever'd, To every tender telative endear* d ; Thus did he live, aud thus resign his breath, Lov'd in his life, lamented in his death : And here, in hope, beneath this sacred stone, la sure and certain hope, lies WADDINGTON.\" i His Niece.

He mourn'd so much, that doctor's art Could give no ease unto his heart, Who was so strangely terrify'd, That in short time for love he dy'd. She that from him was sent away Knew nothing of his dying-day, But constant still she did remain, And lov'd the dead, altho' in vain.

COBBOLD, OF HOLY WELLS, IPSWICH. John Reeve, alias Mel ford, was the last, who presided over the rich and noble Abbey of Bury St. Edmund. He was a native of Metford, and was elected Abbot in 1514. Of his life but few particulars are known. In 1522, a commission was directed to him to ascertain the bounds of Ipswich, a jury im panneled, and their return filed in chancery. At the grand funereal solemnity of Abbot I slip of Westminster, in 1 532, he was the principal assistant. On Nov. 4-th, 1539, after having in vain endeavoured lo avert the"], [141, "117 fatal blow by several most humiliating concessions, he was compelled to surrender his splendid and wealthy monastery into the rapacious hands of Henry the VIHth. An annual pension cfSOO marks was assign- ed him; and he retired from the splendor and magni ficence of the abbatial palace and dignity to a private station, in a large house at the south-west corner of Crown Street, which was the Exchequer Room belong- ing to the Abbey, and which has undergone less altera- tion than any other of the same age in the town; and where, in 1768, his arms were still to be seen in one of the windoivs, with a scroll beneath, inscribed Dominufl 'Cannes _3_fot_ abbas. He appears, however, to have fallen a victim to the severity of the change ; as he very soon sunk under the weight of disappointment and sorrow, occasioned by the havoc aud devastation made in his church and abbey, the overthrow of that religion to which he was so firmly attached, and the degrading necessity he was under of resigning his honors and his dignity. These causes operated so strongly upon his mind, as to produce tka t chagrin and vexation, which shortened his life, and brought him to the grave on the 31st of March following, after having survived the degradation of his order, and the loss of his abbey, for the short space only of four months. Amongst the numerous monuments and ancient grave- stones in the church of St. Mary, was that of this pious and learned man. He was interred in the middle of the chancel, and over Ms grave was originally placed u very large flat-stone cf grey marble, embellished at the four corners with the arms of the abbey, impaling those of his own family, and also his effigy in brass, in full pontificals, with a mitre on his head, and a crosier in his hand. But this ancient stone was most indecently broken and removed in 1717, by some Goihs of the 18th century, to make room for a new one lo ccver the remains of a Mr. Sutton, who was buried in the very grave of the Ex- Abbot. On the stone ?vas the following inscription : T"], [142, "118 __uria quem sD ominutn at 9bbatcm notocrit Olim , Kllius bic retubant 000a aepulta _Etiti* ftuffblce $8 elfotna nomen -nato 3(ol>annem Oijctunt Kemps* progeniesque pater.

Abbot Reeve appears to have been one of the ancestors of the family of that name lately resident at Harleston in Norfolk, if we may judge from the almost exact similarity cf the arms. The Reeves were situated in London at the time of the Restoration ; but how long before that period is uncertain, though proba bly for a considerable time. In the church of St. Sepulchre some memorials for them may still be seen. The family was burnt out of London by the great fire in 1667 _ and with the remains of their fortune, one branch purchased the Inn al Stonham, in this county, called Stonham-Pye, where they resided for many years. From thence their descendants removed to Harleston, where lately resided Mr. William Reeve, an eminent surgeon, and of considerable property. The Rev. William Reeve, his only son, Vicar of Hoxne, and Denham, a person of great learning, charity, and generosity, died in 1786, and in him this branch of the family became extinct. Another branch resided at Bildeston, a descendant of which, Mr. Read Reeve, was lately living at Lavenham.

To the tune of \" Who list to lead a Soldier's life.\" Charles Brandon, the celebrated Duke cf Suffolk, was son and keir of Sir William Brandon, standard- bearer to Henry, Earl of Richmond, at the battle of Bosworth. The family is represented to be of great antiquity, and to have assumed its name from the lord- ship of Brandon in this county. He was remarkable for the dignity and gracefulness of his person, and his robust and athletic constitution. He distinguished himself in tilts and tournaments, the favorite exercises of Henry, by his consummate dex- terity, gallantry, and valour. He was brought up with that prince, studied his disposition, and exactly conformed to it. That conformity gradually brought on a stricter intimacy, and from thenceforth his ad- vancement to royal favor and honors was rapid and extraordinary. His first creation to nobility was to the title of viscount Lisle, the 5th of Henry VHIth. for his emi- nent services in the campaign against France ; and soon after he was raised to the dignity of Duke of Suffolk. It was thought al the time the king conferred this honor upon him, that he intended him afar greater, by giving him his sister Mary in marriage, who had tong won his heart by her beauty, grace, and accomplishments. But policy and the etiquette of courts forbade their union, and consigned the young and beautiful Mary to the arms of an aged, and infirm monarch. For just at this period, Lewis the Xllth. of France, seeking the alliance of the English King, a match was made up between him and the princess, to i 3"], [146, "122 the great grief of the duke ; who, however, though he dearly loved her, had sufficient honor not to use the least means for preventing the marriage. After her short-lived and unnatural union with that monarch, the duke became her husband. When the news was brought to Henry, he seemed much dissatisfied with it, and at first kept Suffolk at a distance ; but the king of France and others interceding in his behalf, he was soon recon- ciled, and the duke had no small share afterwards in the administration cf affairs. During the period of that capricious reign of vanity, extravagance, and blood, he preserved his influence to the last, and died, in the estimation of his king and country, in the year 1545, with this character, that although a better cour- tier than a statesman, yet he used his prince's favors with so much moderation, as not to disoblige any one. He was interred in the south aisle of St. George's Chapel, at Windsor Castle. The duke had four wives ; and by the Princess Mary, his third wife, he had one son, Henry, who was created, the 1 7 th of Henry VHIth. Earl of Lin- coln ; and two daughters, of which Frances married, first, Henry Grey, afterwards Duke of Suffolk, and secondly, Adrian Stokes ; and Eleanor, Henry Earl of Cumberland. This nobleman is one instance that Henry was not altogether incapable of a cordial and steady friendship ; and Suffolk, seems to have been worthy of the favor, which, from his earliest youth, he had enjoyed with his master. The king was sitting in council when informed of his death ; and he took the opportunity both to ex press his own sorrow for the loss, and to celebrate the merits of the deceased. He declared, that during the whole course of their friendship, his brother-in-law had never made one attempt to injure an adversary, and had never whispered a word to the disadvantage of any person. \" Is there any one of you, my lords, who can say as much ? \" When the king subjoined these words, he hooked round in all their faces, and saw that confu sion, which the consciousness of secret guilt naturally threw upon them."], [147, "123 The duke generally resided, with his royal consort, ut his noble mansion of Westhorp Hall, in this county. The cloister, the chapel, with its painted windows, and the original furniture, were kept up till about half a century ago, when it was entirely pulled down, and the furniture and materials dispersed. Eighth Henry ruling in this land, He had a sister fair, That was the widow'd Queen of France, Enrich'd with virtues rare : And being come to England's court, She oft beheld a knight. Charles Brandon nam'd, in whose fair eyes, She chiefly took delight. And noting in her princely mind, His gallant sweet behaviour, She daily drew him by degrees, Still more and more in favour : Which he perceiving, courteous knight, Found fitting time and place, And thus in amorous sort began, His love-suit to her .grace : I am at love, fair queen, said he, Sweet let your love incline, That by your grace Charles Brandon may On earth be made divine : If worthless I might worthy be To have so good a lot, To please your highness in true love My fancy doubteth not."], [148, "124 Or if that gentry might convey So great a grace to me, I can maintain the same by birth, Being come of good degree. If wealth you think be all my want, Your highness hath great store, And my supplement shall be love ; What can you wish for more ? It hath been known when hearty love Did tie the true-love knot, Though now if gold and silver want, The marriage proveth not. The goodly queen hereat did blush, But made a dumb reply ; Which he imagin'd what she meant, And kiss'd her reverently. Brandon (quoth she) I greater am, Than would I were for thee, But can as little master love, As them of low degree. My father was a king, and so A king my husband was, My brother is the like, and he Will say I do transgress. But let him say what pleaseth him, His liking I'll forego, And chuse a love to please myself, Though all the world say no : If plowmen make their marriages, As best contents their mind, Why should not princes of estate The like contentment find ?"], [149, "125 ', But tell me, Brandon, am I not More forward than beseems ? Yet blame me not for love, I love Where best my fancy deems. And long may live (quoth he) to love, Nor longer live may I Than when I love your royal grace, And then disgraced die. But if I do deserve your love, My mind desires dispatch, For many are the eyes in court, That on your beauty watch : But am not I, sweet lady, now More forward than behoves ? Yet for my heart, forgive my tongue, That speaks for him that loves. The queen and this brave gentleman Together both did wed, And after sought the king's good-will, And of their wishes sped : For Brandon soon was made a duke, And graced so in court, Then who but he did flaunt it forth Amongst the noblest sort ? And so from princely Brandon's line, And Mary's did proceed The noble race of Suffolk's house, As after did succeed : From whose high blood the lady Jane; Lord Guilford Dudley's wife, Came by descent, who, with her lord, In London lost her life."], [150, "126 CAPTAIN DEATH: WRITTEN by one of the surviving crew. History, perhaps, cannot afford a more remarkable instance of desperate courage than that, which was exerted on December 23rd, 1757, by the officers and crew cf an English privateer, called the Terrible, equip- ped with 26 guns, and manned with 200 men, under the command of Capt. William Death. On the 22nd he engaged and made prize of a large French ship from \u2022St. Domingo, after an obstinate battle, in which he lost his own brother, and sixteen seamen. Having se- cured his prize with forty men, he afterwards fell in with the Vengeance, a privateer of St. Maloes, carry- ing 36 large cannon, with a complement of 360 men, which attacked and recaptured his prize. Both ships then bore down upon the Terrible, whose main-mast was shot away by the first broadside. Notwithstanding t/iis disaster, the Terrible maintained such a furious engagement against both, as can hardly be paralleled in the British annals. The French commander and his second were killed, with two-thirds cf his complement ; but the gallant Capt. Death, with the greater part of his officers, and almost his whole crew, having shared the same fate, his ship was boarded by the enemy, who found no more than 26 persons alive, 16 of whom were mutilated by the loss as leg or arm, and the other ten grievously wounded. The ship itself was so shattered, that it could scarcely be kept above water ; and the whole exhibited a most dreadful scene of carnage, horror, and desolation. The victor itself lay like a wreck ; and in this condition made shift, with great difficulty, io tow the Terrible into St. Maloes, where she was not beheld without terror and astonishment. This adven ture was no sooner known in England, than a liberal subscription was raised for the support of Death's widow, and the surviving crew."], [151, "127 The strange combination, mentioned by some writers, of one of the Terrible's Lieutenants being named Devil, the Surgeon Ghost, and of her having been fitted out at Execution-Dock, seem entirely destituu of founda tion. The gallant Capt. Death was a native of this county, and his widow and daughters resided, after his death, at Mistley in Essex. The muse and the hero together are fir'd, The same noble views have their bosoms inspired ; As freedom they love, and for glory contend, The muse o'er the hero still mourns as a friend : And here let the muse her poor tribute bequeath To one British hero, \u2014 'tis brave captain Death ! His ship was the Terrible,- \u2014 dreadful to iee ! His crew were as brave, and as gallant as he ; Two hundred, or more, was their good complement, And sure braver fellows to sea never went : Each man was determin'd to spend his last breath In fighting for Britain, and brave captain Death. A prize they had taken diminish'd then- force, And soon the good prize-ship was lost in her course : The French privateer and the Terrible met ; \u2014 The battle begun, \u2014 all with horror beset : No heart was dismay'd, \u2014 each as bold as Macbeth;\u2014 They fought for Old England, and brave captain Death. Fire, thunder, balls, bullets, Were seen, heard, and felt; A sight that the heart of Bellona would melt ;"], [152, "128 The shrouds were all torn, and the decks fill'd with blood, And scores of dead bodies were thrown in the flood;\u2014 The flood from the days of old Noah and Seth, Ne'er saw such a man as our hrave captain Death. At last the dread bullet came wing'd with his fate, Our brave captain dropp'd, \u2014 and soon after his mate ; \u2014 Each officer fell, and a carnage was seen, That soon died the waves to a crimson from green : And Neptune rose up, and took off his wreath, And gave it a Triton to crown captain Death. Thus fell the strong Terrible, bravely and bold ; But sixteen survivers the tale can unfold ; The French were the victors, \u2014 though much to their cost,\u2014 For many brave French were with Englishmen lost.

He was enchanted with the beauty, grace, and numerous accomplishments of thi young princess, but died in less than three months after the marriage. His successor Francis the 1st. proposed the Queen dowager's return to England, to which king Henry consented, after having made the best conditions he could for his sister, and taken security for the payment of her dowry. This done, some of the English nobility wete appointed to go over into France to receive the Queen and conduct her back ; amongst whom was the Duke of Suffolk ; who, upon his arrival, renewing his suit, and being already in her good graces, found it no difficult matter to gain his point ; and wisely concluding that Henry might not so readily consent to his marrying the dowager of France, as he would have done to his marrying the princess his sister, he icould not delay his happiness, but had the marriage privately so- lemnized before he left that country. It is known, however, that Suffolk had entirely gained her affections long before she icas married to the French monarch. For soon after his arrival she asked him, whether he had now the courage, without farther reflection, to espouse her ? And she told him, that her brother icould more easily forgive him for not asking his consent, than for acting contrary to his orders. But this was most probably done ivith the king's connivance. It is, however, certain, that no other subject durst have ventured upon a Queen of France, and a sister of the inexorable Henry the Vl/Jth. It is remarkable, that neither this princess nor her sister had any great pride or ambition ; for al- though they both had been wedded to monarchs. we find that the eldest sister, Margaret, after having buried her first husband, James the Vth of Scot- land, chose one of her nobles for a second, and married Archibald Douglas, Earl of Angus. The Duchess died at the Manor House of Wes-"], [154, "130 thorp in 1533, and was first buried in the abbey church of Bury St. Edmund ; but at the dissolution of that monastery, her remains were removed to the church of St. Mary, and interred on the north side of the altar; and over them was placed a plain table monument. This tomb, simple and unadorned, was for some lime supposed to be only a cenotaph ; but on opening it in 1731, a covering of lead, evidently inclosing a human body, was found, with this in- scription on the breast, \" Mary Queen of France, >1533.\" Notwithstanding this discovery, the tomb continued without any external memorial of the rank of the person deposited beneath it, till 1758, when Dr. Symonds of Bury had it repaired at his own expence, and a marble tablet inserted with the following inscription : Sacred to the Memory of MARY TUDOR, Third Daughter of Henry VII. King of England, AND QUEEN OF FRANCE ; who was first married, in 1514, to LEWIS Xllth, KING OF FRANCE; and afterwards in, 1517, to CHARLES BRANDON, DUKE OF SUFFOLK. She died in his Life-tune, 1533, at the Manor of Westhorp, in this County ; and was interred in the same Year in the MONASTERY OF ST.

Tune \" Dunwich Roses.\" Hugh Bigod was the descendant cf Roger Bigod, who, at the time of the Norman Survey, was in pos session of 117 manors in this county. The family came over with William, the Conqueror ; and for their emi nent services at the battle of Hastings, Roger was thus richly rewarded. His brother, Hugh Bigod, was created by King Stephen Earl of East Anglia ; and in 1166 was advanced, by Henry the Hnd. to the title and dignity of Earl of Norfolk, and died attainted in 1177- He was succeeded by his son Roger Bigod, who, though heir lo the Earldom of Norfolk, and to the stewardship of the royal household, was obliged to purchase both by the payment of 1000 marks, in conse quence of the attainder of his father. In the time of King John, he joined the refractory Barons, and was one of the most active amongst them in procuring for the people that great palladium of English liberty, Magna Charta. He, dying in 1220, was succeeded by his son Hugh, the subject cf the following Ballad. The Castle of Bungay is conjectured to have been built by this powerful family. During the intestine commotions, in the turbulent reign of Stephen, it was so strongly fortified by Hugh Bigod, and stood besides in such an advantageous situation, that he was accus tomed to boast of it as impregnable ; and is reported by Holinshed to have made use of this expression ; \" Were I in my Castle of Bun aye, \" Upon the Water of Waveney, \" I would ne set a button by the King of Cocknaye.\" On the accession of Henry the Hnd. however, this nobleman, who had invariably espoused the cause of K 2"], [160, "136 Stephen, was obliged to give a large sum of money, with sufficient hostages, to save this castle from de struction. Joining afterwards in the rebellion of Hen ry's eldest son against his father, he was deprived by the king of the castle of Bungay, as well as of Fram lingham ; but they were both restored, with his other estates and honors, to his son and heir, whose posterity enjoyed them for several generations. Hugh died in 1225. In the reign of Henry the IHrd. this castle was demolished ; and in the 10th. year of Edward the 1st. Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, obtained permission to embattle his house, erected on the site of the ancient castle. He endowed his second wife, Alice, with this manor ; and having no children, settled all his castks, towns, manors, and possessions on king Edward, and his heirs. The castle, borough, and manor cf Bungay , are supposed to have been given by that monarch to his fifth son, Thomas de Brotherton, and to have been carried, by the marriage o/his daughter and co-heiress, into the family of the Uffords. The records, belonging to this castle, perished in the dreadful fire, which consumed the town, in 1688. The mutability of human affairs is strikingly evinc- ed by the present state of this once flourishing edifice ; once the baronial residence of the great and powerful, where \" Stalely the feast, and high the cheer, \" Girt with many an armed peer ; \" Illumining the vaulted roof, \" A thousand torches flam'd aloof; \" From massy cups, wi'h golden gleam, \" Sparkled the rich metheglin's stream ; *' To grace the gorgeous festival, \" Along tl.e lofty-windowed hall ; \" The storied tapestry was hung, \" With minstrelsy the rafters rung\" it is now become the habitation cf the lowest class of people ; a great number of wretched hovels having been raised against its walls, and let out in lodgings to the poor."], [161, "137 The King has sent for Bigod bold, In Essex whereat he lay, But Lord Bigod laugh'd at his Poursuivant, And stoutly thus did say : \" Were I in my castle of Bungay, Upon the river of Waveney, I would ne care for the King of Cockney.\" Hugh Bigod was Lord of Bungay tower, And a merry Lord was he, So away he rode on his berry-black steed, And sung with license and glee, ** Were I in my castle of Bungay, Upon the river of Waveney, I would ne care for the King of Cockney.\" At Ipswich they laugh'd to see how he sped, And at Ufford they star'd, I wis, But at merry Saxmundham they heard his song, And the song he sung was this : \" Were I in my castle of Bungay, Upon the river of Waveney, I would ne care for the King of Cockney.\" The Baily he rode and the Baily he ran.

The circumstance, says Bloomfield, occurred long before I was born ; but is still related by some of the oldest inhabitants in that part of the country. Fakenham Wood, near Euston Hall, is, perhaps, the largest in the county, and covers an extent of 314 acres. It was the frequent resort of Mr. Austin and his family, at the time that Blooinfield was with him, on a Sunday afternoon, in the summer months. Here the farmer was wont to indulge his juniors with a stroll to recreate them after the labors of the week ; and this was the Poet's favorite haunt in his boyish days, when ever his numerous occupations left him sufficient leisure to muse on the beauties of nature. A view of Fakenham from Euston Park, taken near \" the darksome copse that whisper d on the hill,\" and presenting the \" White Park Gate \" through which the terror-struck villager fled, when pursued by the bong eared apparition, is given in \" Store/ s and Greig's \" Illustrations of Bloomfield, 1806,\" 4to. and 8vo. The lawns were dry in Euston park ; (Here truth inspires my tale) The lonely footpath, still and dark, Led over hill and dale."], [164, "140 Benighted was an ancient dame, And fearful haste she made To gain the vale of Fakenham, And hail its willow shade. Her footsteps knew no idle stops. But follow'd faster still ; And echo'd to the darksome copse That whisper'd on the hill ; Where clam'rous rooks, yet scarcely hush'd. Bespoke a peopled shade ; And many a wing the foliage brush'd, And hov'ring circuits made. The dappled herd of grazing deer That sought the shades by day, Now started from her path with fear. And gave the stranger way. Darker it grew ; and darker fears Came o'er her troubled mind ; When now, a short quick step she hears Come patting close behind. She turn'd ; it stopt !... nought could she see Upon the gloomy plain ! But, as she strove the Sprite to flee, She heard the same again. Now terror seiz'd her quaking frame : For, where the path was bare, The trotting Ghost kept on the same ! She mutter'd many a pray'r."], [165, "141 Yet once again, amidst her fright, She tried what sight could do ; When through the cheating glooms of night, A Monster stood in view. Regardless of whate'er she felt, It follow'd down the plain ! She own'd her sins, and down she knelt, And said her pray'rs again. Then on she sped, and hope grew strong, The white park gate in view ; Which pushing hard, so long it swung That Ghost and all pass'd through. Loud fell the gate against the post ! Her heart-strings like to crack : For, much she fear'd the grisly ghost Would leap upon her back. Still on, pat, pat, the Goblin went, As it had done before : . . . Her strength and reso^tion spent, She fainted at the door. Out came her husband, much surpris'd: Out came her daughter dear : Good-natur'd souls ! all unadvis'd Of what they had to fear.

Some short space o'er the green ; And there the little trotting sprite Distinctly might be seen."], [166, "142 An Ass's Foal had lost its dam Within the spacious park ; And simple as the playful lamb, Had follow'd in the dark. No Goblin he ; no imp of sin : No crimes had ever known. They took the shaggy stranger in, And rear'd him as their own. His little hoofs would rattle round Upon the cottage floor : The matron learn'd to love the sound That frighten'd her before. A favourite the Ghost became ; And, 'twas his fate to thrive : And long he liv'd and spread his fame, And kept the joke alive. For many a laugh went through the vale ; And some conviction too:... Each thought some other Goblin tale, Perhaps, was just as true."], [167, "143 A MERRY SONG, ON THE duke's late glorious success over the dutch. Tune \" Suffolk Stiles. ' Southwold Bay, commonly called Sole- Bay, is, cele brated as the theatre of a most obstinate and sanguinary naval engagement, which look place on the 20th. of May 1672, between the combined fleet of England and France on the one side, and that of the Dutch on the other. The former consisted of 101 sail, 35 of which were French, carrying 6,01 8 guns, and 34,530 men ; and the latter of 91 men of war, 54 fire-ships, and 23 tenders. James, Duke of York, commanded the Red squadron ; the Count EfEtrees the White ; and the Earl of Sandwich the Blue: the Dutch were commanded by De Ruyter, opposed to the Duke of York ; Blank art to Count EfEtrees, and to the Earl of Sandwich. Cornelius De Witt was on board the Dutch fleet, as deputy from the States. The combined fleet lay in the Bay, in a very negligent posture, extending from Easton-ness lo Menes-Mere. The Earl of Sandwich, an experienced officer, had given the Duke warning of the danger ; but received such an answer, as intimated that there was more of caution than of courage in his apprehensions. Upon the appearance of the enemy, every one ran to his post with precipitation ; and many ships were obliged to cut their cables in order to be in readiness. Sandwich, though determined to conquer or to die, so tempered his courage with prudence, that the whole fleet was visibly indebted to him for its safety. He hastened out of the Bay, where it had been easy for De Ruyter, with his fire-ships, to have destroyed the combined fleet, which was crowded together ; and by this wise measure, he gave time to the Duke of York, and lo Count D'Elrees, to disengage themselves. He himself, meanwhile, rush ed into the battle ; and by presenting himself to every"], [168, "144 danger, drew upon him all the bravest of the enemy. He killed Van- Ghent, and beat off his ship; he sunk another, which ventured to lay him aboard, and three fire-ships, that endeavoured to grapple with him. And though his vessel was torn in pieces with shot, and of 1000 men, which she contained, nearly 600 were killed, he continued still to thunder with his artillery in the midst of the enemy. But another fire-ship, more for- tunate than the first, having laid hold of his vessel, her destruction was inevitable. Warned by Sir Edward Haddock, his captain, he refused to make his escape, and bravely embraced death as a shelter from that ignominu, which a rash expression of the Duke's had thrown upon him. During this fierce engagement with Sandwich, De Ruyter remained not inactive. He attacked the Duke of York, and fought him with such fury for more than two hours, that of two and thirty actions in which he had been engaged, he declared this combat to have been the most obstinately disputed. The Duke's ship was so shattered, that he was obliged lo leave her, and shift his flag to another. His squadron was overpowered by numbers, till Sir Joseph Jordan, who had succeeded to Sandwich's command, came to his assistance ; and the fight being more equally balanced, was continued till night, when Ike Dutch retired, and were not pur- sued by the English. The loss sustained by the two maritime powers was nearly equal. The Dutch lost three ships of war ; and their loss in men is supposed to have been very great, as the publication of it was forbidden by the States. Two English ships were burned, three sunk, and one taken; and about 2,500 men killed and wounded. The French suffered very little, having scarcely been engaged in the action. It is supposed that they had received secret orders to spare their ships, and let the Dutch and Englisk weaken themselves by their mutual animosity. On the 27th. which was Whit-Monday , there was a great merry- making on board the fleet ; and so sudden and unex pected was the approach of the enemy, that many officers and sailors, who were on shore at Southwold,"], [169, "145 Dunwich, Aldeburgh, and the adjacent country, could not get on board their ships, although large sums of money were offered for boats to carry them off; but were obliged to remain spectators of the fight. Many likewise were disporting and regaling themselves at Framlingham fair, as the traditionary accounts of the Southwolders test fy to this day. Owing to a calm and thick fog, little more than smoke could be discerned on shore ; but by the report of the guns, a violent con- cussion was felt in all the houses of Dunwich, South- wold, Walderswick, and even as far as Lowesloft. During the engagement, the Southwolders, apprehen- sive of danger from the enemy, were seized with such a panic, that they mustered a strong guard, and suffered no country people, who came flocking into the town to behobd the fight, to repass the bridge, before victory smiled un the English. One day as I was sitting still Upon the side of Dunwich hill, And looking on the ocean, By chance I saw De Ruyter's fleet With Royal James's squadron meet, In sooth it was a noble treat To see that brave commotion. I cannot stay to name the names Of all the ships that fought with James, Their number or their tonnage, But this I say, the noble host Right gallantly did take its post And cover'd all the hollow coast From Walderswyck to Dunwich. The French who should have join'd the Duke, Full far astern did lag and look"], [170, "146 Although their hulls were lighter, But nobly faced the Duke of York, Tho' some may wink, and some may talk, Right stoutly did his vessel stalk To buffet with De Ruyter.

And all along from Gravesend town, With journeys short on foot they went, Unto the sea-coast came they down, To pass the seas was their intent: And God provided so that day, That they took ship and sail'd away. * Susan, afterwards Countess of Kent"], [175, "151 And with a prosperous gale of wind, In Flanders they did arrive ; This was to them great ease of mind, And from their heart much woe did drive And so with thanks to God on high, They took their way to Germany. Thus as they travell'd still disguis'd, Upon the highway suddenly, By cruel thieves they were supriz'd, Assailing their small company : And all their treasures and their store, They took away, and beat them sore. The nurse, in midst of all their fright, Laid down their child upon the ground, She ran away out of their sight, And never after that was found : Then did the dutchess make great moan, With her good husband all alone. The thieves had there their horses kill'd, And all their money quite had took, The pretty baby almost spoil' d, Was by their nurse also forsook. And they far from their friends did stand, And succourless in a strange land. The sky likewise began to scowl, It hail'd and rain'd in piteous sort, The way was long and wond'rous foul.

And all in fury as he stood, He wrung the church keys out of his And struck him so that all the blood hand, His head run down as he did stand ; Wherefore the sexton presently For aid and help aloud did cry. Then came the officers in haste, And took the dutchess and her child, And with her husband thus they past, Like lambs beset with tygers wild, And to the governor were brought, Who understood them not in aught.

WRITTEN IN 1740, By John Price, a land-waiter, in the port of Poole. In Dr. Percy's \" Reliques of Antient Poetry,\" vol. 2. p. 376. is an admirable ballad, intituled \"Hosier's Ghost,\" being an address to Admiral Vernon, in Porto-Bello harbour, by Mr. Glover, the author of Leonidas. The case of Hosier was briefly this : In April 1726, he was sent ivith a strong fleet to the Spanish West Indies, to block up the galleons in the ports of that country ; but being restricted by his orders from obeying the dictates of his courage, he lay inactive on that station, until he became the jest of the Spaniards. He afterwards removed to Carthagena, and continued cruizing in those seas, till far the greater part of his crews perished by the diseases of that unhealthy climate. This brave man, seeing his officers and men thus daily swept away, his ships exposed to inevitable destruction, and him- self made the sport of the enemy, is said to have died of a broken heart.\u2014 The ballad concludes, \" O'er these waves, for ever mourning, \"Shall we roam, depriv'd of rest, \" If to Britain's shores returning, \" You neglect my just request : \" After this proud foe subduing, \" When your patriot friends you see, \" Think on vengeance for my ruin, \" And for England\u2014 sham'd in me.\" In 1739, Vice- Admiral Vernon icas appointed commander in chief of a squadron then fitting out for destroying the settlements of the Spaniards in the West Indies ; and, weighing anchor from Spit*"], [180, "156 head on the 23rd of July, arrived in sight of Porto- Bello, with six ships only, under his command, on the 20th of Nov. following. The next day he com menced the attack of that town; when, after a most furious engagement, on both sides, it was taken on the 22nd, together with a considerable number of cannon, mortars and ammunition, and also two Span ish ships of war. He then blew up the fortifications, and evacuated the place for want of land forces sufficient to retain it ; but first distributed 10,000 dollars, which had been sent to Porto-Bello for paying the Spanish troops, among the forces for their bravery. The two houses of parliament joined in an address of congratulation upon this success of his majesty's arms; and the nation, in general, teas wonderfully elated by an exploit, which was certainly magnified much above its intrinsic merit. Hosier ! with indignant sorrow, I have heard thy mournful tale ; And, if heav'n permit, to-morrow Hence our warlike fleet shall sail.

BARNARD BARTON. Edmond Dandy, esq. a Portman of Ipswich, and a very rich and religious man, erected at his own ex- pence the Market-Cross in the year 1510, during his Bailiwic. He was one of the Representatives for the Borough in the Parliaments of 1511, and 1514 _ and served the office cf Bailiff three times, viz. in 1498, 1503, and 1510. In 1514, he founded a Chantry in the Church of St. Lawrence for a Secular Priest to offer, at the altar of St. Thomas the Martyr, in be- half of himself and his relations, amongst whom he reckoned Thomas Wolsey, the celebrated Cardinal, then Dean of Lincoln, and his parents Robert and Jone Wolsey, deceased. He nominated Sir James Crowfield the first priest ; and to him and his succes- sors he gave his house in St. Lawrence Parish, adjoin- ing to the Crown in King's Street, for a residence, and his lands in Sproughton, Stoke and Alnesborne, for a maintenance. This Mr. Dandy was one of the most respectable men of the town ; all his daughters married gentlemen of good fortune ; and the issue of one of them was the wife of the Lord Keeper Bacon. He died in May 1515, and was buried in the church of St. Law- rence. Mr. Beaumont, who was Minister of that parish in 1729, says, that there was part of a white stone, then placed in one of the windows of the chancel, on which there had been brasses, and on which was the following inscription : _\u00bbere unDet IiC0 burieD tfie boBp of -EBtn SDanDP Some \u0152ime H-ortman anU IBailief of _!pstoic{>. _E_ e 8ntiem jFounBer of pe ..roea anU of ti>e aims Ijouaes in ILaDi' taut, to <LEtocrg one of tot& &e ease an 100 of tooo."], [183, "159 agat tointct to rfie maintenance tobcreof be catie tert_in HanDa in i). olbroofc to pe Bailietoea of 3IpbIdcI) ann tiieit Succeaaota for etict. fte Dje_ tSpap 1515 aim fjaH Tlaoue bp aiice f\u00bba toife Dauebtcr of Bacon 3Elm iDanlip of ffrctincfjam in g>u\u00a3F tobo marricD 3cnca Dauebtct of _.bomaa 8.uar. of 3ips_>ci) ISobctt Danlig marries lioice Oaucljtet of <%i>omae Keati of 2?ccclea in Sud. 3;6!jn S__m_2 3fonc DanDr an_ acnes _>anl)p.

William De La Pole, Duke of Suffolk, was a brave and skilful officer, and during the latter part of the glorious reign of Henry the Vth. served with much reputation in the wars of France, and was made a Knight of the Garter. Upon the death of that king, he was left in France with the Earl of Salisbury, for the defence of the English acquisitions there ; and in 1424, upon the taking of the city of Maine, was made governor thereof. In 1442, in consideration of his manifold services, he obtained a grant to himself, Alice his wife, and their issue male, in reversion, of the Earldom of Pembroke, in case Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, should die without issue male. In 1444, he was created Marquis of Suffolk; and obtained a grant to himself, his wife and the heirs of their bodies of the manors of Nedging, and Kettlebaston, to hold by the service of carrying a golden sceptre, with a dove on its head, upon the coronation-day cf the king's heirs and successors ; as also another sceptre of ivory, with a golden dove on its head, upon the day of the coronation of the then queen, and all other queens of England, in time lo come. In 144.3, he was sent over to France, apparently to settle the terms of a truce, which had then been begun, but in reality lo procure a suitable match for the king. The princess, selected to be the partner of his throne, was Margaret of Anjou, the daughter of Regnier, titular king of Sicily. The treaty of marriage having been soon brought lo a conclusion"], [186, "162 by Suffolk, he was sent as the king's proxy to espouse the princess, and conduct her to England. He e? joyed ever afterwards a high degree of favor with the queen, through whose means he was made Lord Chamberlain, Lord High Admiral, and raised to the dignity of Duke of Suffolk. This nobleman is accused of having been concerned, with the Cardinal of Winchester, in the murder of Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester ; and after the death of the Cardinal, governed every thing with Uncontrolled sway. His conduct soon excited the jea- lousy of the other nobility ; and every odious and un- successful measure was attributed to him. He was charged with mismanagement ; waste of the public treasure; the foul murder of the duke; and the loss of divers provinces in France; with many other high crimes and misdemeanours ; for which he was commit- ted to the Tower ; and though the queen interposed and effected his release, yet the popular resentment against him was so strong, that the king, to skreen him as much as possible, sentenced him lo five years banishment. This was considered by his enemies as an escape from justice ; and when the Duke left his castle at Wingfield, and embarked at Ipswich, with an intention to sail to France, the captain of a vessel was employed to inter- cept him in his passage. Being seized near Dover, his head was struck off on the gunwale of a boat in 1449, and his body thrown into the sea ; but being cast on shore, it was removed to Wingfield, and interred in the chancel of the collegiate church, where under apurfled arch with a bouquet on the point, and a quatrefoil in the pediment on a freestone altar-tomb is his recumbent figure in stone with whiskers, pointed helmet, gorget of mail, gauntlets, square-toed shoes, a lion at his feet and under his head a helmet without a crest. On the front of the tomb are four plain quatrefoils with shields. It is recorded cf the Duke, that when his father and three brothers hud lost their lives in the service of their country, in the wars with France, he spent thirty years in the same campaign, and for seventeen years never returned home. Once he was taken prisoner, whilst"], [187, "163 only a knight, and paid \u00a320,000 for his ransom ; fif teen years was he a privy counsellor, and thirty years a knight of the garter. He married Alice, the widow of Sir John Philip, knt. and the daughter of Thomas Chaucer of Ewelme and Donington in Oxfordshire, the son of Goeffery Chaucer, the famous poet, by whom he obtained vast possessions. In the \" Paston Letters \" are three written by this Duke, Vol. 1. pp. 32. 39- For an account of the Family and Monuments at Wingfield, see \" Gough's Sepulchral \"Monuments, Pt. 2. p. 249.\" In the chancel of the church of Wingfield are some noble monuments qftlie De La Poles, whose arms adorn the font, the east window, and the pulpit. About a quarter of a mile north west of the church are the remains of the castle, built by Michael De La Pole, the 1st Earl of Suffolk, whose arms, with those of Wingfield, cut in stone, remain on each side of the entrance. It stands low, without any out-works for its defence. The south front, or principal entrance, is still entire. By the marriage of Catherine, the daughter and heir of Sir John Wingfield to Michael De La Pole, the 1st Earl of Suffolk, this manor and the extensive estates attached to it were carried into that nolle family, in which it continued for several generations. While in their possession, they obtained a licence to convert the manor-house into a castle, and to inclose and impark all the woods and lands belonging to it. Against the south wall cf the chancel is hung a pe* digree of the De La Poles, neatly written on parchment, with their arms beaut fully emblazoned ; and to which is prefixed the following title : \" An exact account cf the most noble Family of the De La Poles, from their first settling at Wingfield, until the extinction of the Family, collected by Wm.

Margaret, a little before his death. The incidents are chiefly taken from the First and Second Parts of Shakespeare's historical play of Henry the Vlth. Oh Royal Margaret, from the Kentish strand Receive these tokens of thy Suffolk's hand, And may kind love the sacred charge convey, And love-born zephyrs waft it on its way To thee, thou pride, thou pleasure of my life, Thou more than friend, than sister, or than wife ! At this sad hour, left friendless and alone, With my lost greatness all my friends are flown. Ah, fickle greatness ! and ah, friends unkind ! Faith, friendship, duty, vanish into wind ! Say, will my pen prove faithful to my woes, And the sad story of my grief disclose, This last sad scene of all my sorrows tell, And bid the darling of my soul farewell ? When pass'd the dread decree that bade me roam, For five long years, an exile from my home ; And when Oppression, sanctifi'd by Might, And Rapine, hallow'd by the name of Right, Had seiz'd with impious hand my fair domains, My native forests, and paternal plains ; And when keen Malice, watchful to destroy, Raz'd my proud domes, once fill'd with mirth and joy; Firm and unmov'd the dreadful tale I hear, Nor think the mighty ruin worth a tear. Lamp of my life ! I shed for thee alone The frequent tear, and heav'd the ceaseless groan."], [189, "165 Still present to my soul, in act to part, Thy dear idea clung around my heart ; Ah ! had not there thy image been enshrin'd, That heart had danc'd all lightly as the wind: Scorn paid with scorn, I then had left the land, And courted pleasure on another strand. Pride of thy sex ! believe me, whilst I swear Thou wert alone the cause of all my care ; I \"swear by all my former feats of arms, And by an oath more sacred, by thy charms. I go, sad exile, (such the stern decree !) For five long years from happiness and thee ; To pass the night in woe, and waste away, In sad complaints and vain, the lengthening day. For to the stranger in a friendless land Time counts the tedious hours with sparing hand His lazy sands almost forget to run, And the long lingering year rolls slowly on ; The lagging months in sad succession flow, The day too lingers, and the hours move slow. But oh, my Queen, if Suffolk still be dear, Still harsher notes than these must grate thy ear, For Fate's dire laws, unknowing to relent, Pronounce a harsher doom than banishment! For me no more soft smiling Hope prepares The treasur'd joy to calm my present cares ; No more my Hero hangs the friendly light To guide her true Leander through the night : Life's fickle sea tempestuous gales deform, And, my light lost, I perish in the storm.

But all in vain to reach the friendly shores, The bending sailors ply their equal oars, And every art is tried, and every sail Expands in vain to catch the fleeting gale : The swift pursuer o'er the watery waste Urges his course, and, with increasing haste, Approaching near prepares the missile fight, And furious force arrests our fruitless flight ; Close by our side, the leader gave the word, With vengeful rage the ruffians haste on board. Though unprepar'd for war, our numbers few, Yet still we strove against the lawless crew ; Awhile th' unequal conflict we maintain, Then sink o'erpower'd beneath the conqueror's chain The ruthless ruffians with vindictive breath Pour bitter threats on all, and menace death, But chief to Suffolk, as his happier hand Had maim'd the leader of the ruffian band.

Nor gorgeous crowns, nor regal sceptres move ; I listen'd only to the voice of love. But now, alas ! far other thoughts arise. Far other scenes distract my closing eyes ! For, all ! the ruthless ruffian chides my stay, And envious death denies this short delay ; Denies me longer on the theme to dwell : More lov'd than life, my beauteous Queen, farewell ! THE REASON FOR TAKING DOWN THE IPSWICH CROSS AT LENGTH DISCOVERED. In 1812, it was deemed necessary , in furtherance of the improvements that were then taking place in the town, to pull down the Market Cross, which was effected with great difficulty, as the timber and every part of it were in most excellent preservation. As a remnant of antiquity, one cannot but regret its loss. We have already seen that it was erected by Edmund Dandy in 1510: some further notices of it, extracted from the accounts of the Treasurer of the Corporation, may not be uninteresting. Benjamin Osmond, by will dated June 1619, gave 50\u00a3. towards building the Cross. In 1628, 34>\u00a3. was paid to the Town, in lieu of 50\u00a3. which was given by B. Osmond towards building of the new"], [196, "172 Cross. Paid to Thomas Allen in part of the framing of the Cross, 23\u00a3. More paid to him by warrant for building the same Cross, 10\u00a3. More paid to said Allen in full of 38\u00a3. for framing the said Cross. Several entries are in the above accounts respecting the timber taken from Ulveston Hall lands for the use of the Cross, and of the sums paid by the corporation to Tooley's Charity for it. 10th. May, 1660, the Cross was ordered to be beautified for the proclamation of King Charles the Hnd. and five or six great guns to be provided at the Common Quay; and to be dis charged at the same time. 12th. April 1694, it was ordered, that a new Justice be set up on the Cross, and the Cross repaired, at the charge of the Town. 15th. April, 1723, ordered, that the town Treasurer repair the Market Cross at the charge of the Corpora tion ; and this year, the thanks of the Corporation were ordered to Francis Negus, Esq. for his present of the Statue of Justice, which was brought from his seat at Dallinghoe. This gentleman represented the Borough in the Parliaments of 17 17 , 1722, and 1727- The Arms on the Cross, above each pillar, were those of Ipswich ; of the families of Dandy, Bloss, Long, Sparrowe ; and the two Tradesmen's marks of C. A. and B. K. M. The Cross was a large octagon building cf wood; the roof being supported by eight pillars, and surmounted with a well-executed figure of Justice, with her usual attributes. It was twenty-seven feet diameter, and about fifty feet in height to the top of the figure. This figure has been since placed over the entrance cf the New Corn-Exchange, having been first transformed into that of Ceres, by an exchange of the sword and scales for the sickle and wheat ears. This gave occa- sion to the following jeu d'esprit : \" Long, in Ipswich Market-place, \" Aslrtta look'd, with languid face, \" Upon the proud Agrarian race, \" Broken her sword, her scales uneven ; \" Resolv'd that corn again shall rise, \" Ceres the lofty space supplies, \" And holds her sample to the skies, \" While scorn'd Astr\u00e6a flies to heaven ! \""], [197, "173 Long must Ipswich alas ! thy fair Structure deplore. And deeply lament thy sad loss, An act so Vandalic her feelings must wound, And make each Antiquarian look cross! And strange to relate, no memorial would now This Structure have e'er handed down, For no ardor its Freemen or Natives inflam'd, Had it not been for one Raw* of the town !

Peregrine Bertie, Lord Willoughby of Eresby, was the only son of Catherine, Duchess of Suffolk, by Richard Bertie, esq. her second husband ; of whom some account is given at page 147- In the year 1586, he distinguished himself at the siege of Zutphen in the Low Countries. He was the year after made general of the English forces in the United Provinces, in the room of the Earl of Leicester, who was recalled. This gave him an opportunity qf signalizing his courage and military skill in several actions against the Spaniards. One qf these, greatly exaggerated by popular report, is probably the subject of the following old Ballad, which, on account qf its flattering encomia on English valor, has always been a favorite with the people. His Lordship married Mary, the daughter of John Vere, Earl qf Oxford, and left issue by her, who died in 1624, five sons and a daughter. He deceased in l601, and was buried at Spilsby in Lincolnshire, where a monument was erected to his memory. The subject of this Ballad may possibly receive illus- trationfrom what Chapman says, in the Dedication to his version qf Homer's Frogs and Mice, concerning the brave and memorable retreat qf Sir John Norris, with only 1000 men, through the whole Spanish army, under the Duke qf Parma, for three miles together. Both Captain Norris and Turner were famous among the military men of that age. To the extraordinary history of his mother, the Duchess of Suffolk, at page 147, the following descrip- tion of her monument in Spilsby church may, perhaps, be deemed an interesting addition. Under the arch, which separates the aisle from the chancel, is a large monument qf stone, richly gilt and ornamented. In two recesses are the busts qf a man and woman ; the man in armour, the woman with a ruff, <$_..

ILLE OBIIT IX APRILIS 1582. On the top of the base stand three whole-length figures supporting escutcheons ; and on the base itself are eight more escutcheons. The front is supported by three pillars. In six divisions are engraved passages qf scripture, and at ike bottom are five escutcheons. In the Gent. Mag. vol. 77. pt. 1 \u25a0 p. 209, is an en graving qf the plate, in two compartments, originally prefixed to the Ballad entitled, \" The most rare and excellent History of the Duchess of Suffolk, eye.\" See also \" Fuller's Church History,\" Book 8, p. 38. The fifteenth day of July, With glistering spear and shield, A famous fight in Flanders Was foughten in the field : The most couragious officers Were English captains three ; But the bravest man in battel Was brave lord Willoughbey. The next was captain Norris, A valiant man was hee : The other captain Turner, From field would never flee. With fifteen hundred fighting men, Alas ! there were no more, They fought with fourteen thousand then Upon the bloody shore."], [202, "178 Stand to it noble pikemen, And look you round about ; And shoot you right you bow-men, And we will keep them out : You musquet and calliver men, Do you prove true to me, Tie be the formost man in fight, Says brave lord Willoughbey. And then the bloody enemy They fiercely did assail, And fought it out most furiously, Not doubting to prevail ; The wounded men on both sides fell Most pitious for to see, Yet nothing could the courage quell Of brave lord Willoughbey. For seven hours to all mens view This fight endured sore, Until our men so feeble grew That they could fight no more ; And then upon dead horses Full savourly they eat, And drank the puddle water, They could no better get. When they had fed so freely, They kneeled on the ground, And praised God devoutly For the favour they had found ; And beating up their colours, The fight they did renew, And turning tow'rds the Spaniard, A thousand more they slew."], [203, "179 The sharp steel-pointed arrows, And bullets thick did fly ; Then did our valiant soldiers Charge on most furiously ; Which made the Spaniards waver, They thought it best to flee, They fear'd the stout behaviour Of brave lord Willoughbey. Then quoth the Spanish general. Come let us march away, I fear we shall be spoiled all If here we longer stay ; For yonder comes lord Willoughbey With courage fierce and fell, He will not give one inch of way For all the devils in hell. And then the fearful enemy Was quickly put to flight, Our men pursued couragiously, And caught their forces quite : But at last they gave a shout, Which ecchoed through the sky, God, and St. George for England ! The conquerers did cry. This news was brought to England With all the speed might be, And soon our gracious queen was told Of this same victory : O this is brave lord Willoughbey, My love that ever won, Of all the lords of honour 'Tis he great deeds hath done."], [204, "180 To th' souldiers that were maimed, And wounded in the fray, The queen allow'd a pension Of fifteen pence a day ; And from all costs and charges She quit and set them free: And this she did all for the sake Of brave lord Willoughbey. Then courage, noble Englishmen, And never be dismaid ; If that we have but one to ten, We will not be afraid To fight with foraign enemies, And set our nation free : And thus I end the bloody bout Of brave lord Willoughbey. .*~~%_.x.*\u00bb^*-* THE ORIGIN OF THE MONDAY NIGHT'S CLUB, AT IPSWICH. This Club was first established in the year 1725, and consisted qf an unlimited number qf members. They met alternately at each other's houses on every Monday evening ; and although there were many wig members amongst them, yet, in politics, they were all most decided tories. The club ceased to exist in the year 1812 The following Song, which was sung at their annual dinner, was written by the late Dr. Clubbe. He had practised for many years in Ipswich, both as a Sur geon, and as a Physician ; and died at his house in Brook-street, after a long and painful illness, April 25th, 1811, in the 7 1st. year of his age. The Doctor"], [205, "181 was the eldest son of the Rev. John Clubbe, rector of Whatfield, and vicar qf Debcnham, the author qf an admirable piece qf irony, levelled against modern anti- quaries, \" The History and Antiquities qf Whca/field.\" Of the Doctor, who was a man cf considerable humour, and qf a most chearful disposition, many pleasa?tt anecdotes are still in the recollection of his friends. To a pun, or a facetious story he was no enemy. His me- dical acquirements had deservedly obtained for him the highest esteem qf the public ; while the suavity qf his manners, and the sociability of his character, had justly endeared him to a large circle of acquaintance. He published \" A Treatise on the Inflamation in the \"breasts of lying-in Women, 1779,\" Svo. and \" On \" the Venereal Poison, 1782,\" Svo. He lies buried in the church-yard cf St. Stephen, Ipswich, and in the church a neat mural monument has been erected to his memory, with the following inscription in Capitals : TO THE MEMORY OF JOHN CLUBBE, LATE A VERY EMINENT PHYSICIAN, IN THIS PLACE, WHO DIED 25TH. APRIL 1811, AGED 70 YEARS. His well known probity, Universal benevolence, Friendly disposition, obliging temper And engaging manners During a long Residence in this Town, Endeared him to all Who sought either his acquaintance As a friend Or his assistance as a Physician And his loss Is as generally lamented. In the year twenty-five, as by oral tradition, A set of Choice Spirits, enliven'd by wine, Agreed 'mong themselves, in a special commission, To erect a new banquet at Bacchus's shrine. N"], [206, "182 All rosy, good humour'd, and full of invention, By some proper name the new meeting to dub, They agreed one and all, not a voice in dissention, It's name shou'd be called, The Monday Night's Club. Prefix'd thus its name, time and place they selected When and where they shou'd hold their nocturnal carouses ; And one night in each week they by vote then directed The Club should be held at each others ownhouses. To secure its existence came next in discussion, For clubs, if not foster'd, fall into decay ; They decreed all it's members, in future succession, In Religion and Party shou'd think the same way. In Party, the Tories shou'd first be admitted. And of them only those who reside in the town ; In Religion, Church Priests shou'd alone be permitted, And both as the true and staunch friends of the Crown. A wag then exclaim' d, my good friends, you're aware Mere Religion or Party can't keep it from sinking ; We must make out a bill of some good wholesome fare, For no club can exist without eating and drinking. Let it's fare be quite simple, bread, butter, and cheese, Hot suppers inflame and distemper the brain ; Nice stomachs may then eat or not as they please, And sup and re-sup o'er again and again."], [207, "183 Let it's liquors be port, punch, porter and ale, In wine says the Proverb there's truth and no care ; Each member may then in libations regale, And toast that first blessing of heaven, the Fair. The fumes of tabac snotli tVif> muim of thinking, Give a truce to the mind to reflect on its lass ; Long tubes are of course an appendage to drinking, For a whiff now and then adds new zest to the glass. Well pleas'd with then- banquet, now fully completed, They arose, and took each a full bumper in hand ; Live for ever our Club ! with three cheers they re- peated, Be it envied by all other clubs in the Land. THE SUFFOLK COMEDY. IN THREE PARTS. To the Tune of *' Phillis the Lovely.\" The following old Legendary Ballad is printed from an unique copy in the possession of Mr. Raw, of Ipswich. PART I. You young men and maidens of beauty most bright, Give ear to my story of love and delight ; I know that most people will of it approve, It shews that some maidens are crafty in love. n2"], [208, "184 It is an old saying we often do hear, That maids go a courting when it is leap year ; A comical courtship this proves in the end, Most people will smile ere my song's at an end. Young Cupid he ranges about now and then, And maidens are wounded as well as the men ; For all must submit to his conquering bow, As now by experience you soon all shall know. A handsome young lady in London did dwell, Whose parents were dead, it is known very well ; She had the possession, all in her own hands, Of great store of riches, and houses, and lands. A gentleman out of the country did ride, And at a great milliner's shop in Cheapside He took up his lodgings, as I do declare, When many a beautiful lady came there, Fine gloves, and rich ribbons, and fans there to buy, And such other nick-nacks as pleased their eye ; The gentleman of them did take a full view, And often would pass a sine compliment too. This beautiful lady amongst all the rest, She came to the milliner's shop I protest, And seeing this gentleman, she, for her part, That instant was wounded by Cupid's sharp dart. This honoured beautiful lady by birth Thought him the handsomest creature on earth ; So sweet was his carriage, such eloquent ways, In person so graceful, exceeding all praise. When business was over, this man to be plain, Took coach and then rode back to Suffolk again, At which the young lady was grieved full sore, For he was the person that she did adore. The ardour of love was enkindled so great, Her fond heart lay panting and fearfully beat ;"], [209, "185 So deep was she wounded, she could no more rest, The tortures of love so inflame. 1 her breast. Then said the young beautiful lady, I find That now I am greatly perplex'd in my mind ; In love I am deeply entangled, she cry'd, Oh ! that I could be, but that gentleman's bride. Methinks how delighted I'd be with the choice, I do like his temper, and likewise his voice : His courteous behaviour, in every degree, So fine is, so sweet, and so pleasing to me. I never shall rest 'till I find out his name, And learn by some method from what place he came; But now if my passion to him I unfold, I fear he would slight me and call me too bold. But rather than I will quite languish and die, In a very short time I am resolved to try, Perhaps I by policy then may contrive, To gain him I fancy, my heart to revive. PART II. Soon after, this beautiful young lady gay, In man's fine apparel herself did array ; And for this spruce gentleman enquiry made, Because now to love him her heart was betray'd. They told her from St. Edmund's Bury he came, Which is in the county of Suffolk by name ; Disguised she rode down to Suffolk we find, In order to ease her poor troubled mind. In the fair town of Bury then, as it is told, This damsel then sought for this gentleman bold, And in a short time did find out where he dwelt, But who can express now the passion she felt. N 3"], [210, "186 This lady then went to a tavern hard by, But chest like a man that no one might esspy That she was a woman, thus in her disguise, You'll say that she acted both cunning and wise. She sent for this gentleman with a design To come and take part of a bottle of wine ; And soon to the tavern this gentleman came, To visit this stranger of honour and fame. The lady was like a young man to behold, And said, sir, excuse me for being so bold ; Though I am a stranger no harm do I mean, In fair London city your face I have seen. The gentleman straitway replied in mirth, You are not a person of breeding and birth ; Is not your intention, I ask, me to cheat ? Now what is your business, pray let me intreat. Sir, I came from London (I hope no offence) To you in great business, and 'ere I go hence, The truth of the matter you too soon shall know : This set him a sighing, when she talked so. They called for a supper, and when it was o'er, The gentleman said, sir, I do you implore To tell me your business. Then in her disguise, She acted her part now both cunning and wise. Sir, I have a sister, a lady by birth, She is the most beautiful creature on earth ; And she is worth hundreds and thousands a year, To tell you the truth she does love you most dear. My sister lies languishing now for your sake, And therefore compassion I hope you will take, And slight not a captive, in love so confin'd, Your answer I hope will be loving and kind. The gentleman answer'd without more ado, You question me hardly, but now tell me true,"], [211, "187 If that your faces resemble alike, Then I with your sister a bargain will strike. Dear sir, she is like me in every part : Why then I can love her with all my fond heart ; If there be no bubble nor trick in the case, Your sister's kind proffer I mean to embrace. She said, I must ride on to Cambridge with speed ; But since you have answer' d so kindly indeed, I will ride to London, before you get there, And, sir, you shall find that all matters are fair. PART III. The gentleman then, between hope and despair, His journey to London forthwith did repair ; He found where this beautiful lady did dwell, And of her good fame he was pleased right well. The lady got home, as before she had said, And he was admitted by her waiting maid To the young lady's presence ; approaching the room, To pay her his visit he then did presume. Dear honour'd lady, excuse me nor blame, From Bury St. Edmund's in Suffolk I came, I had the good fortune your brother to see, Who told me you had a great value for me. Sir, what do you mean ? I declare on my death, I have not a brother alive on the earth ! This filled the gentleman with much discontent, And he said, on a fool's errand then I am sent. So taking his leave, on his going away, This beautiful lady she caus'd him to stay ; And then unto supper she did him invite, The charms of her beauty his soul to delight."], [212, "188 Worthy sir, she exclaimed, right welcome you be, But pray now relate the whole matter to me, What person it was that made use of my name, Because to affront you he was much to blame : Dear sir, I am sorry and grieved in heart, That you should have had such affront on your part, Then all the whole matter he soon did declare ; The lady she smil'd, for she could not forbear. He had but small stomach to eat at the first, Her kind entertainment made him to mistrust That it was but some juggle the matter to prove, He greeted the lady with proffers of love. She said, I now fancy that you have red hair, Dear madam, you wrong me, I solemnly swear : So his wig he pull'd off, and then throwing it down, Cry'd, madam, behold now my hair it is dark brown. The lady burst out into laughter, and said. Your wig will just fit me, as I am a maid ; She her head dress pull'd off, and his wig she put on, Saying, sir, do I look like a handsome young man ? The gentleman's heart then began to rejoice, Saying, that is the f_ce and the sweet pretty voice, Which I met with at Bury, therefore be not coy, For now I am crowned with rapture and joy. Why sir, are you sure on it, perhaps you mistake ? No madam, I do not, my oath I can take. Then how do you like me, sir, tell unto me ? Sweet honoured lady, right happy I be. Then a lady excuse sir, I beg and intreat, For I'm a poor captive who lies at your feet ; I now crave your pardon for being so rude On such a kind gentleman thus to intrude. 'Tis true sir, I want not for silver or gold : I hope you'll excuse me for being so bold ;"], [213, "189 For love is a witchcraft, none can it withstand, When little brisk Cupid gets the upper hand. Dear lady, your love makes amends for it all, And therefore in right happy splendor we sliall Be crowned with comfort, when we are both ty'd, And I shall be bless'd with a beautiful bride. At Bow-church in London then married they were ; Attended with gentlemen and ladies fair, They rode down to Bury, and as many say, Great feastings there lasted for many a day. Prolosue, SPOKEN AT THE LOWESTOFT THEATRE, On Thursday, August 14, 1790. On Thursday, August 14, 1790, previously to the performance of the \" School for Scandal \" by Mr. Hamstow's Company qf Comedians, the following ex cellent Prologue, written by a Gentleman qf Lowestqft, was spoken by Mr. R.

From the height of its situation, and the dryness of its soil, it is not expnsed to any of those unwholesome damps and noxious vapors, which arise from low and marshy grounds. The shore here is bold and steep, being composed of a hard sand, intermixed with shingle, and perfectly free from ooze, and those beds of mud so frequently met with on many shores : this renders it firm and pleasant for walking. The steepness of the beech too is considered of singular advantage in sea bathing, as depth ot water can always be obtained, without the machines pro. cee ding far into the sea.

Tlie admirers of nature cau scarcely enjoy a more delightful prospect than that which is beheld from the church-yard, where sea, lake, and land unite to embellish the picture. The Lake, which approaches very near to the sea, affords glimpses of its transparent waves, with the small vessels gliding over their glassy surface, exhibiting a pleasing emblem of tranquillity, when contrasted with the turbulence of its restless neighbour, with ships of ten-fold mag nitude dashing on her bosom. * Blundeston is about three miles distant from Lowestoft, aud was formerly the residence of the Rev. Norton Nicholls. It is a beautiful spot: the wood, water, aud decorations are tastefully disposed, and worthy the admiration, which has been so deservedly bestowed upon them. Mr. Mathias, in an elegant and well-written Memoir of his friend Mr. Nicholls, which is appended to his f Ob servations on the writings, and on the character of Mr. Gray, &c. 1815,\" lStmo. thus describes this charming retreat. \" Upon the best motives Mr. Nicholls retired from London, and resided constantly with his mother in the cheerless depth , and then uncul tivated solitude, of his Suffolk Livings, where he passed his time in continued study, and in the exercise of his professional duties. But I m u<st o bserve that, since his residence there, the country and the neighbourhood have assumed another aspect. As there was no rectorial house upon either of his livings, he fixed upon a place which I could wish that future travellers might visit, and speak of it, as we do of the Leasowes, I mean his Vilta at Blundeston, which (if barbarous taste should not improve it, or some more barbarous land surveyor level with the soil its beauties and its glories,) will remain as one of the most finished scenes of cultivated sylvan de light, which this island can oifer to our view. It was his own and his appropriate work ; for scarcely a trace of its uncouth original features can be found or pointed out to the visitant. But to the eye of a mind, like Mr. Nicholls 's, the possible excellencies' of a place."], [217, "193 Where Science, youth, the great, the gay resort, In health's blest seat let Comus hold his court. If harmless pleasure can your minds engage, Mock not the efforts of our mimic stage ;t yet unadorned, were visible; and even as it then was, there was to be found in it walks and recesses, in which Mr. Gray observed, in his sublime conciseness, \" that a man, who could think* might think.\" By perseverance and skill he at last surmounted every difficulty which was opposed to him through a long series of years, and he formed and left the scene as it now is. (December, 1809 ) Thoughont the whole, and in every part of it, the marks of a judg ment, which cannot be questioned, and of an unerring taste, which was regulated by discreet expense, are so eminently conspicuous, as to proclaim Mr. Nicholls to have been, what a kindred poet _o happily terms, *( Un artiste qui pense, Prodigue de genie, et non pas de depense.\" Delille, Les Jardins, L. 1. To be a visitor and an inmate guest to Mr. Nicholls at Blundeston in the gay season, when his lake was illuminated by summer suns, and rippled by the breeze; when every tree and shrub, in its chosen position, seemed to wave in homage to its possessor and cultivator; when a happy and youthful company of either sex, distinguished by their talents aud accomplishments, was enlivened by the good humour and spirit which presided over the whole; with the charm of music, and with every well-tempered recreation, which the season could present, and with all the elegance of the domestic internal arrangements ; it was difficult, indeed, 1 say, to be a visitor and a guest at Blundeston in that gay season, and not to be reminded of Spenser's imagination; \" For all that pleasing is to eye or ear, Was there consorted in one harmony ; Birds, voices, instruments, winds> waters, all agree ! \" Whoever have been witnesses of the scene will know that I speak of it as they have seen it, and that I have set down nothing in fiction.\" As a supplement to this interesting Memoir is annexed an Italian Ode or Tuscan Canzone, addressed to Mr. Nicholls when living, and composed at his Villa at Blundeston. It is entitled \" Ail' Erudito e nell' Amena Letteratura Versatissimo Norton iNicholls Presentandogli L'Aggiunta Ai Componimenti Lirici Scelti de Piu lllustri Poeti D'ltalia.\" The Rev. Norton Nicholls, the accomplished and intimate friend of Mr. Gray, received the early part of his education at Eton, under the celebrated Dr. Barnard. In 1760, he entered at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he proceeded to the degree of LL.B. in 1766. In 1767 he was presented to the Rectories of Bradwell and Lound, both in this County. He died at his house at Blun deston on the 2 Id. of Nov. 1809, in the 68th year of his age, and was interred in the chancel of Richmond Church, Surry, where a marble tablet is erected to his memory, the inscription on which is given in Lysons* Environs, Supplement p. 42y. t The Theatre, a spacious building, is situate a little to the west of the town, in what is called Bell Lane.

He straight gave her a loving kiss, And without more delay, He took her by the lily white hand, And thus to her did say ; I wish Old Nick may fetch me straight, (A woeful tale to tell) If ever I prove false to thee, My dearest Nell.

With kisses and embraces, She granted her consent ; And having got a licence, Unto the church they went ; Where he made her his lawful wife, As for a truth I tell, And now they live a happy life, Sing, O brave Nell !

ON KING GEORGE THE Ilnd's LANDING AT LOWESTOFT, On his Return from Hanover, the 14th of January, 1736-7. His Majesty had been a considerable time on his voyage from Helveotsluys to England, occasioned by slurmy and contrary winds, and had been also exposed lo the most imminent danger. When the royal barge approached the shore, a body of sailors belonging to Lowestqft, uniformly dressed in seamen's jackets, re joicing that their King, after having escaped the perils of the ocean, was honouring their native town witha visit, waded into the sea, and, meeting the barge, took it on their shoulders with the King, the Countess qf Yarmouth, and all the attendant nobility in it, and carried it lo the beach, without suffering it to strike the ground. His Majesty was met at t/ie sea shore by John Jex, esq. of that town, with his carriage, who conducted him to his house : ISIr. Jex having the very high honour qf being coachman. This mighty monarch landed about twelve at noon, and about two Ivours after set off for London. Between six and seven o'clock in the evening, Mr. Carrington, one qf the King's messengers, arrived al the Post Office in Ips- wich, with the agreeable news that his Majesty would be there that night ; on which the Bailiffs, Porhnen, fSec. assembled in their formalities to receive him, at St. o2"], [224, "200 Margaret's gate. The whole town was immediately illuminated ; and Christ Church, the house of Thomas Fonnereau, esq. in particular, made a most splendid appearance. His Majesty did not arrive till a little after eleven, when the crowd was so great at the gate, that the Magistrates could not pay their duty to him there ; but repaired to the White Horse and attended him as he came out of his chaise. He immediately went up stairs into the great dining-room, whither they were soon admitted, with several of the Clergy of the town, and had all the honour to kiss his hand. Mr. Bailiff Sparrowe, finding his Majesty was very much fatigued, addressed him in a short, but very hand- some speech, settingforth the joy the corporation felt in paying their duty io him, after the many anxious thoughts they had had on account qf the great danger that he had experienced. The King came in the same chaise from Lowestqft to Saxmundham, where he was accommodated with a set qf Lord Strafford's horses, which brought him hither. The messenger, who was gone forward, left orders for a coach and chaise with four horses each to be hired here, and as many dragoons as could be got together to attend him. His Majesty entered the chaise a little before twelve, and passed through the town, attended with the joyful acclamations qf a numerous crowd of people, and was pleased to lake notice qfthe ladies, who shook their handkerchiefs at the windows in the market place, by waving his hat. By the lime that he reached Copdock, it was so dark that lights woe deemed necessary. The harbinger, or officer, that went before, enquired of the landlady of the inn, if she had any flambeaux, or could procure any ? Being answered in the negative, he asked, her if she had any Links ? Aye, that I have, said she, and some as good as his Majesty, God bless him ! even eat in all his life. And immediately produced some fine sausages ! He stopped al honest Isaac Spencer's, at the Swan in Stratford, where he laid himself down upon a bed for three or four hours ; and about six took coach for London. A messenger had been sent before from Woodbridge to Felixtow, who ferried over to"], [225, "201 Harwich, and ordered the coaches round io Stratford. His Majesty went through Colchester without stopping, and arrived at St. James's Palace about two in the afternoon. This mode qf travelling forms a striking contrast to the present rapidity qf Royal conveyance ! Great George, in safety, is return'd again From all the dangers of the raging main ! Blest be the day, be none distinguish'd more, Than that, which brought him to the Low'stoft shore. Methinks I see the glad expecting crowd, Which on the sandy beach rejoicing stood. Twice twenty sailors clad in decent white Survey the distant pinnace with delight, And e'er the royal barge can reach the land, Plunge in the waves, and bear it to the strand ; The joyful multitude, with loud acclaim, Surround the King, and shout his much lov'd name : The much lov'd name from glad'ning hills rebounds, The hollow deep re-echoes with the sounds. Oh ! let th' united nation grateful meet, And strive who best their welcome Lord shall greet ; Tune ev'ry instrument of joy, and sing How bounteous heaven preserv'd their gracious King. When storms and waves their mutual horrors join'd, When winds and seas their strongest force combin'd, Bright ministering angels then were there, George and Great Britain were their guardian care ; O'er him their sacred wings extended wide, Check'd the rude winds, and stem'd the swelling tide. May these mean lays some happy bard inspire, Whose raptur'd bosom glows with patriot fire ; And be their theme by him more nobly drest, \u2014 A monarch sav'd, and three great nations blest. o 3"], [226, "202 _\u00a3t u. an & \u20acratfi.al Ballatr, CONCERNING JOHN AND ELIZABETH SMITH, OF COOKLEY, NEAR HALESWORTH. John and Elizabeth Smith were tried and convicted at the Assizes holden at Bury, March the 21, 1812, for the wilful murder qf Mary Ann Smith, an infant aged eight years, the daughter qf the said John Smith by a former wife, in consequence of a series qf star- vation and cruelty, at Cookley in this county. They were both executed at Ipswich, on Monday the 23d, in the presence of an immense concourse qf spectators, confessing their guilt, and acknowhdging ti to have been their intention to have destroyed their other children. John Smith was thirty-nine, and his wife twenty-seven years qf age; and they had been married only four months. They both appeared per fectly penitent, and were launched into eternity, a dreadful example of the depravity of human nature.

THE # all ot _. __mun &, KING OF THE EAST ANGLES A TRADITIONARY TALE. In 870, Inguar, the Danish chieftain, gained pos session qf Thetford, the capital of East Anglia. King Edmund collected his forces, and marched to oppose the invaders. The hostile armies met near Thetford, and ester an engagement, maintained for a whole day"], [228, "204 with the most determined courage, and great slaughter on both sides, victory remained undecided. The pious king, to use the language of the Monkish writers, was so extremely affected by the death qf so many martyrs, who had shed their blood in defence of the christian faith, and the miserable end qf so many unconverted infidels, that he retired in the night to the village of Eglcsdene, now Hoxne. Hither he was followed by an embassy from Inguar, who was soon after the battle joined by his brother Hubba, with ten thousand fresh troops. The Danish chief tain proposed that he should become his vassal, and divide with him his treasures and dominions. But Edmund returned for answer that he would never submit to a pagan. At the same time, out of tenderness for his subjects, he resolved to make no further resistance, and accordingly surrender ed without a struggle to the superior force sent against him Still, however, refusing lo accede to the terms qfthe conquerors, he was bound to a tree, his body was pierced with arrows, and his head cut off , and thrown contemptuously into the thickest part qf a neighbouring wood. The tradition, on which this tale is founded, is as follows, and is current in the parish of Hoxne to this day. In the hope of escaping his pursuers, the monarch concealed himself under the arch qf a bridge near the place, now called Gold Bridge, and so named from the brilliant appearance of the gilt spurs, which he happened to wear, and which proved the means of dis- covering his retreat. A newly-married couple, return- ing home in the evening, and seeing by moon-light the reflection qf the spurs in the water, betrayed him to the Danes. Indignant at their treachery, the King is said to have pronounced, in the warmth of his resent- ment, a dreadful curse upon every couple, who should afterwards pass over this bridge in their way lo or from the altar of Hymen ; and we are told that even at this day> after an interval qf nearly one thousand years, such is the superstitious regard paid to this denuncia- tion, that persons, proceeding to or coming from the church on such an occasion, never fail to avoid the"], [229, "205 bridge, even if they are obliged to take a circuitous road. It is a remarkable instance of the great length cf time in which traditions in parishes are sometimes continued. The morn arose, and shot her ray, Resplendent, from the clime of day, Along the wide extended heath, Which night beheld a scene of death. The tents of England's King gleam'd white, Reflected from the dawning light. Fast o'er the misty hills, afar, The Chief of Loch/in* urg'd the car, _ And wak'd to strife th' advent 'rous war : His standards, streaming to the sky, Led forth his troops to victory. With eagle glance, the Monarch stood And view'd the fatal field of blood, Then urg'd his valiant few, to stand. The guardians of their native land ; The spirits of the mighty dead Leaned from the Heavens, o'er Conflict's bed, Intent to hear th' expiring sigh, The dying moan of Liberty. Inguar approached, Death in his rear, And on his van, Revenge and Fear. Each line advanced \u2014 the battle woke, And reddened at each echoing stroke ; Sword rang on helm, and spear on shield ; Each chieftain doubtful held the field \u2014 Oppression swayed the Danish heart, But Freedom nerved the English dart. * Denmark."], [230, "206 Long raged the thick fight's furious bray ; With blood bedewed \u2014 a fallen prey \u2014 Lay high-piled ranks of countless dead, The Heavens their shroud \u2014 the heath their bed\u2014 The bannered Raven,i tow'ring, waved O'er Edmund's ranks. \u2014 In vain they braved The ruthless fury of their foe, For Victory sat on Inguar's brow. Distraction seized on Edmund's soul;, And o'er his senses phrenzy stole. The day's declining ray was past, And evening's mist the sky o'ercast,\u2014 Uncertain of the trackless space, The vanquish'd Monarch urg'd his pace, Till Eglesdene's high rising fane, At distance, cheer'd the gloomy plain ;\u2014 With weeds o'ergrown, an ancient pile Of mossy bricks, and Runic style. The Waveny's sedgy confines bore, A passage safe from either shore.

At half past five, P. M. the enemy hauled up within hail of us on the starboard side, and the batde began, both ships steering full under the topsail. ; after exchanging between two aud three broadsides, the enemy's ship fell on board of us, her mizen channels locking iu with our fore rigging. I went forward to ascertain her position, and observing that the enemy were flinching from their guns, I gave orders to prepare for boarding. Our gallant bands appointed to that service immediately rushed in, under their respective officers, upon the enemy s decks, driving every thing before them with irresistible fury- The enemy made a desperaie bul dis orderly resistance. The firing continued at all the gangways and between the tops, but in two minutes time the enemy were driven sword in hand from every post. The American flag was hauled down, and the proud Old British Union floated triumphant over it. In another minute they ceased firing from below and called tor quarter. The whole of this servive was achieved in fifteen minutes from the commencement of the action. \" I have to lament the loss of many of my gallant shipmates, but they fell exulting in their conquest. My brave First Lieute nant Mr. Watt was slain in the moment of victory, in the act of hoisting the British colours : his death is a severe loss to the service. Mr. Aldham, the Purser, who had, spiritedly, volunteered the charge of a party of small-arm men, was killed at his post on the gangway. My faithful old Clerk, Mr. Dunn, was shot by his side ; Mr. Aldham has left a widow to lament his loss. I request the Commander in Chief will recommend her to the protection if the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty. My veteran boatswain. Mr Stephens, has lost an arm.

Of my gallant seamen and marines we had twenty-three slain, and fifty-six wounded. I subjoin the names of the former. No expressions I can make use of can do justice to the merits of my valiant officers and crew ; the calm courage they displayed during the cannonade, aud the tremendous precision of their fire, could only be equalled by the ardour with which they rushed to the assault. I recommend them all warmly to the protection of the Commander in Chief. \" Having received a severe sabre wound at the first onset, whilst charging a party of the enemy who had rallied on their forecastle, 1 was only capable of giving command till assured our conquest was complete, and then directing Second Lieutenant Wallis to take charge of the Shannon, and secure the prisoners, I left the Third Lieutenant, Mr. Falkiner (who had headed the main-deck boarders) in charge of the prize.

It is impossible to particularize every brilliant deed performed by my officers and men, but I must mention when the ships' yard arms were locked together, that Mr. Cosnahan, who commanded in our main top, finding himself screened from the enemy by the foot of the topsail, laid out at the main-yard arm to sire upon them, and shut three men in that situation. Mr. Smith, who commanded in our fore-top, stormed the enemy's fore-top from the fore-yard arm, and destroyed all the Americans remaining iu it.

Henrietta Maria, the fair heroine of the following stanzas, and the celebrated and beloved mistress qf the unfortunate Duke of Monmouth, was the only daughter and heir of Thomas, Lord Wentworth, of Netilestead, the eldest son of Thomas, the 1st. Earl of Cleveland. On the death of the Earl, her grandfather, she succeed- ed to the Barony qf Wentworth, the Earldom having become extinct by the demise of her father without issue male. She was a woman qf an elegant person, most engaging manners, and the highest accomplish- ments. Lady Wentworth resided for many years at Toddington, in the county of Bedford, with the Duke, her lover, whose attachment to her continued to his death. The Duke acknowledged, just before his execution, to two prelates and other divines who attend- ed him, that \" he and Lady Wentworth had lived in \" all points like man and wife ; \" but tliey could not make him confess it was adultery. He acknowledged \" that he and his Duchess were married by the law qf \" the land, and therefore his children might inherit, \" if the king pleased. But he did not consider what \" he did when he married her. He said that since that \" time he had an affection for Lady Henrietta, and \"prayed that if it were pleasing to God, it might con- \" finite, other/vise that it might cease : and God heard \" his prayer. The affection did continue, and there- \"forc he doubled not it was pleasing to God ; and \" that this was a marriage ; their choice of one another \" being guided not by lust, but by judgment upon due \" consideration.\" When he addressed himself to the people from the scaffold, he spoke \" in vindication qf \" the Lady Henrietta, saying she was a woman qf \" great honour and virtue; a religious and godly lady.\" He was told by some of the divines of his living in adultery with her ; he said \" iw. For these two years p 3"], [242, "218 \" last past he had not lived in any sin that he knew of; \" and that he was sure when he died to go to God ; \" and therefore he did not fear death, which they \" might see in his face.\" * Lady Wentworth is said lo have died broken-hearted, in consequence of his untimely end. It is certain, how ever, that she survived his execution but a few months, and was buried at Toddington, under a costly monu ment, on which is the following inscription : Sacred to the memory of the Right Honourable the L'.dy Henrietta Maria, Baroness 'Wentworth, who died unmarried April the 23rd, 1686 She was sole daughter and heir of the Right Honourable Thomas, Lord Wentworth, buried here the 7lh of March, 1664, by Philadelphia his wife, daughter of Sir Ferdinando Cary, Knt. who was interred near her husband the Pth of May, 1696. And grand-daughter and heir of the Right Honourable Thomas, Earl of Cleveland, Lord Wentworth, and Lord Wentworth of Ncttlestead, &c. also buried here April the _th, 1667. Several great grand-children of this unhappy connec tion are living, and inherit the characteristic features, and personal beauty qf their ancestors. May they inherit happier fortunes ! There is a fine whole length portrait of this Lady engraved by R. Williams from a Painting qf Sir G. Kneller. On the death qf Lady Wentworth, the Barony des cended lo her aunt, Anne, the daughter qf Thomas, Earl qf Cleveland, and the wife of John, Lord Lovelace.

ON THE Wnfotimiatt J.'.amrn, Who were Wrecked on the Coasts of Suffolk and Norfolk, October 31, 1789. BY P. HOMER. A few minutes before four in the morning, one of the most violent squalls of wind from the North East came on, that had ever been remembered. As it com-"], [246, "222 menced not less suddenly than violently, it was the occasion qf a scene, almost too dreads ul for description. A large fleet of ships was lying in the Yarmouth Roads, several qf which being driven from their anchors, and running foul qf each other, the greatest confusion ensued. Some foundered, and many lost their masts ; whilst others were obliged either to slip or cut their cables, and run to the Southward, which luckily for them, on account qf the quarter from which the gale blew, they were able to accomplish without much dan- ger, so that two only were forced on shore to the South- ward qf the harbour. The case, however, qf those vessels, which were caught by the storm to the North- wardof the Cockle-Sand, was infinitely more distressing and fatal. Those that were at anchor, waiting for the light to enter the Roads, were, almost every one of them, forced to quit their anchors by the violence of the wind, or by other ships coming athwart them ; some sunk instantly upon their striking against each other ; others perished the moment they were driven on the sand ; some, having been beaten over the Cockle, either went down in deep water, or fell upon the Barber ; and several met their fate on the shore. Ships from the Northward were every moment coming in, some with every sail split, and hanging like so many pen- nants ; others with one mast only standing ; some with nothing but a small piece qf torn canvas fastened to the remaining stumps of their masts ; others with all their boats and anchors washed away, making signals of distress, and in a perfectly unmanageable state driving through the Roads at the mercy qf the waves, and at last sinking in the sight qf hundreds qf spectators. The immense damage, done Iry this storm on the coast of Suffolk and Norfolk, was shocking beyond ex pression. Indeed, the whole coast exhibited a scene the most awful and distressing. Ships dismasted at anchor ; others scudding before the wind without any canvas to set; and wrecks of ships, that had been lost on the sands, /hating in every direction. Between Soulhwold and Yarmouth, a space qf only 25 miles, iO ships were ashore. Between Yarmouth and Cramer,"], [247, "223 a space of about 30 miles, 120 dead bodies were cast ashore; and HO sail of finking, with 70 other boats were lost. Out qf 150 ships, that were blown out qf the roads, 3S were totally lost, with nearly half their crews. Nor was the destruction, occasioned by this violent storm, confined to the sea alone, although the effects q) its jury ivcrc there displayed in all the excess of horror. Trees, buildings, windmills, <_j -c. were blown down ; and upwards qf 400 sheep were drowned by the sea having forced the banks of the marshes.

The circumstances, which gave occasion to this Ballad, are as follow : Three young Ladies qf Mel ford agreed to bathe in a river, about half a mile dis- tant from the town, there beina no private accommodation for that purpose in the neighbourhood. An curly hour, ut which they would be the least liable to be discovered by strangers, was determined on ; and at four o'clock in the morning they proceeded to the appointed place. But as they walked through the town, they were unfortu- nately espied by a blacksmith. Curiosity prompted him to find out whither the fair-ones were hastening ; but he did not discover himself' lo them till they were in the river, the perfect images qf their primitive mo- ther Eve ; when perceiving him approach, they scream- ed out, and prudently sat down in the water. The modern Vulcan, dead to the distresses of these Venuses, determined to divert his uncouth fancy by carrying off their clothes, with which he did not return. In this pitiable situation they were obliged lo remain fur nearly an hour, when a poor woman passing that way, on hearing the rude behaviour which they had experien- ced, and their consequent embarrassment, procured them such necessary articles qf apparel, as enabled them to return home with decency.

At that hour, also, on.thc firing \u00abf a cannon, the Presidents, Vice Presidents, and din- ner company, sporting their true- blue cockades and streamers, assembled in the Crown Meadow. At half past twelve, another piece of ordnance gave the joyous intimation that the cooks were all busily em- ployed in taking up and dishing the respective courses. In another half hour, the dinner was on the table ; and as soon as the whole had been pro- perly arranged, a bugle sounded, the conipum/ arose, and the Presidents invoked a blessing on l/n feast. Due time having been allowed, for the de- struction of beef and pudding, a second bugle sound- ed, the tables tvere cleared, thanks were returned, and as the first loyal toast, \" The King'' teas given with three limes three: from fifteen hundred voices at once, the air resounded with \" the King,\" and the succeeding shouts made the very welkin shake. After the above, the whole company adjourned to the \" Oylmpic Courses' \" And there another feast began !;' To describe, particularly, the numerous sports, which awaited the spectators, icould be impossible: they consisted of a Jerusalem poney race, a jump- ing match in sacks, foot races, grinning-matches through horse-collars, jingling-matches, &'c. fye. To crown the solemnities of the day, a grand bon fire was lighted, in which the unhappy effigy of Bonaparte was mercilesslu consigned to the flames. A brilliant display of fire-works succeeded, and closed this august festival.

THE ELVEDON HUNT, 1754: BY RICHARD GARDINER, ESQ. ALIAS DICK MERRY-FELLOW, Of Mount- Amelia, in the Parish of Ingoldisthorp, Norfolk.

On Tuesday, November 5th 1810, was found off the buoy of the Rough near Harwich a dead Whale, and on the following day it was towed into the harbour. This aquatic prize was made by Job son and Baker, of Ipswich, in company with a ves sel belonging to Colchester : and as it was found be yond the jurisdictional limits of any port, it was qf course the sole property qf the captors. On Thursday, it was toived up the Orwell, as high as Dunham Reach, which could not have been affected but for the spring tides. On Friday, the opera tion qf cutting up commenced ; and as from the circumstances in which it was found, it was in a very fair stale, the produce, it is supposed, was con- t Richard Gardiner Esq. the eldest son of the Rev. John Gardin er, LI.. D. Rector of great Massingham and Brunsted, in Norfolk, and Perpetual Curate of St. Gregory and St. Giles, in the City of Norwich.

So distinguished a \" proficient was he in polite learning, that he opened \" a school in his monastery for teaching the sons of the \" nobility the arts qf versification, and the elegancies \" qf composition. Yet although philology was the \" object, he was not unfamiliar with the fashionable \" philosophy : he was not only a poet and a rhetorician, \" but a geometrician, an astronomer, a theologist, and \" a disputant. He is the first qf our writers, whose \" style is clothed with thai perspicuity, in which the \" English phraseology appears at this day to an Eng \" lish reader.

Rowland Taylor, LL.D BY NATHAN DRAKE, M. D- Dr. Rowland Taylor, a learned and godly divine, was presented to the Rectory of Hadleigh, in 1544, by Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury , whose domestic chaplain he was. He was, says Fuller, a great scltolar, a painful preacher, charitable to the poor, of a comely countenance, proper person, (but inclining to corpulency ) and cheerful behaviour. He constantly resided on his living, confirming his flock in the truth by his diligent teaching and exemplary life, correcting the vicious and negligent by his impar tial reproofs, and winning the poor by his daily charily and assistance. In the sanguinary persecutions, which disgraced the reign of the weak and bigotted Mary, he suffered for his firm adherence to the doctrines of the Reformation. The particulars are as follow. Some of the inhabitants qf Hadleigh, headed by one Foster, a lawyer, and one Clerke, a leading man in the town, endeavoured to re-establish Mass in Hadleigh Church; and having creeled an altar in it, procured John"], [276, "252 Averth, the Parson of Aldham, to come and celebrate there, on Palm Sunday. Dr. Taylor was unacquainted with the design, but hearing the bell loll as he sat in his study, hastened to the church ; and there finding the Priest, with a shaven crown and Popish vestments, ready to officiate, he burst out into a rage, saying, \" Thou devil, how darest thou to enter this church qf \" Christ, to defile it with idolatry ? I am the skep- \" herd that God and Christ have appointed over this \"flock; and I command thee, O Popish wolf in \" the name qf God, to depart hence, and not poison \" this flock with Popish idolatry.\" The Parson was afraid to proceed, and seemed ready to retreat ; but Foster and his adherents, having turned the Doctor by force out of the church, desired him to go on in his office, and finish the service. Soon after this contest, Foster and Clerke sent up a complaint to Dr. Gardiner, then Lord Chancellor, and Bishop of Winchester, against the Doctor, who was by the Bishop's letters ordered to appear before him ; and in a short time was condemned lo the stake. The Doctor was taken by the Sheriffs qf London, and conveyed to an Inn without Aldgate, where he was delivered to the Sheriff qf Essex, who conducted him to Chelmsford, when Sir John Shelton, the Sheriff of Suffolk received him, and car- ried him to Lavenkam, where they stopped two days. On entering Hadleigh by the bridge, a number of the poor wept bitterly, when the Sheriff rebuked them. On the Doctor's passing the Alms-House, he enquired if the blind man and woman were alive, and being an swered in the affirmative, threw the glove, which contained his money, in at the window. On his way io Aldham Common, the Doctor said, \" I shall this \"day deceive the worms in Hadleigh Church-yard ;\" and fetching a leap or two when he came to the town, \" now, said he, lack I but two stiles, and I am even \" at my Father's house.\" He was burned February 9, 1555, on the Common in that parish, which is usually, though improperly, called Aldham Common. On a spot, which marks the place of his execution, is a stone with this mispelt inscription :"], [277, "253 1555 D* TAYLOR . IN . DE FENDING . THAT WAS . GOOD . AT THIS . PLAS . LEFT HIS .

It stands close to the foot-path leading from Hadleigh to Aldham Church, about three quarters qf a mile from the town, on rising ground, which commands an ex- tensive prospect over the adjacent country, and embraces the beautiful tower of Kersey, with many bold and striking objects. The whole field, in which it is placed, was, in 1817, planted witkiurnips, excepting a small piece about a foot wide, round tlie railing, which was qf grass. When brought to the stake, the faggots being placed by the executioners, Mulleine qf Kersey, and Soyce, Warwick, and King qf Hadleigh, the Doctor said, with a loud voice, \" Good people, I have \" taught you nothing but God's holy word, and those \" lessons that I have taken out qf God's blessed book, \" the Holy Bible ; and I am come hither this day to \" seal it with my blood.\" When the fire was kindled, holding up both his hands, he called upon God, and said, \" Merciful Father of heaven, for Jesus Christ \" my Saviour's sake, receive my soul into thy hands.\" He then stood still without either crying or moving, with his hands folded together, till Soyce, one of the execution- ers, struck him on the head with au halbert, so that his brains issued out, and the dead body fell down into the fire. Thus rendered this man qf God his blessed soul into the hands qf his merciful Father, and to his most dear Saviour Jesus Christ, whom he most entirely loved, faithfully and earnestly preached, obediently followed while living, and constantly glorified in death.

THE LIFE OF THOMAS TUSSER, WRITTEN BY HIMSELF. Of Thomas Tusser, one of our earliest didactic poets, and who has been styled the British Varro, few parti- culars are known, beyond what he has himself recorded in his own poetical life, which is the chief source from whence biographers have drawn their supplies. He was born about the year 1515, at Rivenhall, near Wilham in Essex, of an ancient family, and was first placed as a chorister in Ike collegiate chapel qf"], [280, "256 the castle of Wallingford ; then impressed into the King's chapel, from whence he was admitted into the choir of St. Paul's Cathedral ; and completed his education at Eton, King's College, and Trinity Hall, Cambridge. From hence he was called up to court by his patron, William Lord Paget ; but at the end of about ten years, he exchanged the life qf a courtier for that of a farmer, and settled at Katwade, now Cattiwade, a hamlet of the parish of Brantham, in the hundred qf Samford, near the river Stour. Here he composed his book qf husbandry, the first edition qf which was published in 1557. It is probuble that he must have been acquainted with rural affairs for several years at least before he could produce the rude essay, which forms the germ of his future, and more elaborate work. He appears to have suffered some reverse in his farming business, as we find him after- . wards successively at Ipswich, where his wife died, at West Dereham, and at Norwich. He married, how- ever, a second wife qf the name qf Amy Moon, which affords him a play of words ; but this match did not add to his happiness, apparently from a disparity in age, she being very young, tie then obtained a singing-man's place in the cathedral of Norieich. After this he tried farming again, at Fairsled, near his native place ; but again failing, he re- paired to London, which he mentions with due commendation, unlit being driven from it by the plague in 1574, he went to Cambridge. When this scourge abated, he returned to London, and died there, about 1580, and was interred in St. Mildred's Church in the Poultry, with thefollowing epitaph, which is recorded by Stow ; Here Thomas Tusser, clad in earth, doth lie, Who sometime made the Points of Husbandry : By him then learn thou may'st, \u25a0 here learn we must, When all is done, we sleep, end turn to dust : And yet, through Christ, to heaven we hope to go, Who reads his books, shall tind his faith was so. For an author the vicissitudes of his life present an uncommon variety of incident. Without a tine-"], [281, "257 ture of careless imprudence, or vicious extravagance, this desultory character seems to have thrived in no vocation. Fuller quaintly observes, that his stone, which gathered no moss, was the stone of Sisyphus ; and in Peacham's Minerva, a book of Emblems printed in ;6l2, there is a device of a whetstone and a scythe, icith these lines : They tell me, Tusker, when thou wert alive, And hadst for prosit turned every stone, Where'er thou earnest, thou couldst never thrive. Though hereto best couldst counsel every one, _s it may in thy Husbandhy appear, Wherein afresh thou liv'st among us here So, like thyself, a number more are wont To sharpen others with advice of wit, When they themselves are like the whetstone blunt. In Tusser's production may be traced the popular stanza, which attained to such celebrity in the pas toral ballads of Shenstone. His work seems to have obtained a very favorable reception, as more than twelve editions appeared within the first fifty years, and afterwards many others icere printed, The best editions are those of 15S0, and 1585, but they are very scarce. In 1812, the public was favored with a new edition in 8vo. carefully collated and corrected by Dr. Mavor, which is rendered highly valuable by a biographical memoir ; a series of notes, georgical, illustrative, and explanatory ; a glossary ; and other improve ments.

Of Thomas Naske, the noted controversialist, whose literary squabbles with Gabriel Harvey are so full of bitter ribaldry, and whose apology for his unhappy companion, Robert Greene, contains so many curious notices of the petty manners of the Metropolis, especially among hireling authors of his own time, much has been said in almost all the late publications, which have any allusion to Eliz abethan literature. It is a name, indeed, familiar to every one, who has pored over the exuberant note makers on Shakespeare. He was a native of Lowestoft in this County, and was educated at St. John's College, Cam bridge, where he became B. A. in l_S5, If we may judge from his pamphlet, entitled \" Pierce \" Pennilesse,'' which, though written with consi derable spirit, seems to breathe the sentiments of a man in the height of rage and despair against the world, it appears probable that he had met with se vere disappointments , and was reduced to extreme misery and distress from his own indiscretions, and a life of extravagance and debauchery. He is sup posed to have died about 1 600, a sincere penitent. Nashe wrote with considerable ease, harmony, and energy ; in a vein of spirited and judicious criti cism, of caustic satire, and of pointed humour. Not withstanding the occasional mendicity which his pages display, the whole are richly diversified with matter and local allusions, and enlivened with wit ticisms ; and furnish such an assemblage of amu sing traits of manners and of authors, that his writings may justly be called the granary for com mentators, and those whose research has turned to the Elizabethan \u0153ra. More notes have been ga tlwed from the light tracts of Tom Nashe than from the voluminous productions of any of his con temporaries. Mr. D' Israeli, in the second volume"], [294, "270 of his \" Calamities of Authors,\" a book which is probably in every reader's hand, has given so in- genious and entertaining an account of the literary quarrel between Nashe and Harvey, that it ivill spiare the present writer the imprudence of an im- perfect repetition cf the same story. But the ver- satile Nashe took an important part in a controversy of an, higher concern. He teas a main opponent to the puritanical and seditious Sectarians, who con- tended under the name o/\"Martin Marprelate. \" There \" was, says Isaac Walton, in his Life of Hooker, \" not only Martin Marprelate, but other venemous \" books daily printed and dispersed ; books, that \"ivercso absurd and scurrilous, that the graver di- \" vines disdained them an answer. And yet these \" were grown into high esteem with the common peo- \" pie, till Tom Nashe appeared against them, who \" was a man of a sharp wit, and the master of a \" scoffing, satirical, merry pen, which he employed \" to discover the absurdities ofthoseblind, malicious, \" senseless pamphlets , and sermons as senseless as \" they. His merry ivit made such a discovery of \" their absurdities, that he put a greater stop to \" these malicious pamphlets, than a much iviser \" man had been able.\" Drayton, in his Epistle \" of Poets and Poems\" says : \" And surely Nashe, tho' he a proser were, \" A branch of laurel yet deserves to bear ; \" Sharply satiric was he, and that way \" He went, since that his being, to this day \" Few have attempted, and I surely ihink \" Those words shall hardly be set down with ink, \" Shall scorch and blast so as his could, where he \" Would inflict vengeance !\" Nashe ivas a great favourite with the tcits of his day. One calls him \" our true English Aretine,' another ' sweet satyric Nashe,\" a third describes his muse as \" armed with a gag-tooth, and his pen \"possessed with Hercules' s furies.\" He is well cha racterised in \" the Return from Parnassus :\""], [295, "271 \" His stile was witty, tho' he had some gall ; \" Something he might have mended, so may all ! \" Yet this I say, that for a mother's wit, \" Few men have ever seen the like of it.\" In the \" Pierce Pennilesse,\" are the following lines, descriptive of his despair under poverty and neglect, after having tired his youth with folly, and surfeited his mind with vanity. \" Why is 't damnation to despair and die, When life is my true happiness' disease ? My soul ! my soul ! thy safety makes me fly The faulty means that might my pain appease; Divines and dying men may talk of hell ; But in my heart her several torments dwell. Ah, worthless wit, to train me to this woe ! Deceitful arts that nourish discontent ! Ill thrive the folly that bewitch'd me so ! Vain thoughts, adieu ! for now I will repent ; And yet my wants persuade me to proceed, Since none take pity of a Scholar's neerl . \u2014 Forgive me, God, altho' I curse rny birth, And ban the air wherein I breathe a \u25a0wretch ! Since misery has daunted all my mirth, And I am quite undone through promise-breach. O friends, no friends that then ungently frown When changing Fortune casts us headlong down. Without redress complains my careless verse, And Midas' ears relent not at my moan ! In some far land will I my griefs rehearse, 'Mongst them that will be mov'd when I shall groan !

AND DEAN OF ST. PAUL'S. The fair Subject of the following verses was the younger, and only surviving daughter of Sir Robert Drury, of Hawsted, Knt. by Anne, the eldest daugh ter of Sir Nicholas Bacon, of Redgrave, the Pre mier Baronet qf England. She died in l6_0, at the early age of 15. Tradition reports, that her death was the consequence qf a box on the ear, given her by her father. This absurd story is supposed to have originated from her being represented, both on her monument and in ker picture, reclining her head on one hand. Another tradition relating to her is, that she was destined to be the wife us Prince Henry, the eldest son qf James the 1st. She was certainly a great heiress, and their ages were not unsuitable ; but it may reasonably be doubted whether there is more truth in this story than in the other. So much, however, is certain, that she is immortalised by the muse qf Donne, who had determined tu celebrate her anniversary in an Elegy, as long as he lived : \" Accept this tribute, and his first year's rent, \" Who, till this dark short taper's end be spent, \" As oft as thy feast sees this widow'd earth, \" Will yearly celebrate thy second birth, \" That is thy death.\" But we have nothing beyond the second anniversary.

An Engraving from it is given in \" Cul/um's History qf Hawsted.\" In the South east corner of the chancel qf the church qf Hawsted is a mural monument to the memory qf this Lady.

Aubrey, in his MS. I fe, calls him \" a \"puritan in Essex, who cut his hair short.\" In 1627, lie was presented to the vicarage qf Stowmarket. In 1628, Milton, in a letter dated from Cambridge, pro mises him a visit at his country house in Suffolk ; and compliments him on the independency qf mind, with which he maintained himself, like a Grecian Sage, or an old Roman Consul, on the profits qf a small farm. In the same year, however, inconsequence qf his reli gious opinions, and the persecution qf the Puritans by Abp. laud, he was compelled to retire to the Continent, where he obtained the appointment qf Minister to the British merchants at Hamburg. He appears to have returned to England in or before the year l6_0, when the long parliament offered to him and to his brother exiles protection from the tyranny of the High Commis sion and the Star-chamber courts. In 1643, he was"], [303, "279 appointed a Member qfthe Assembly qf Divines, where he was a constant attendant, and one qf the authors of the book, called \" Siueci, mm/us,\" defended by Milton. On the visitation of the University ot' Cambridge by the Eorl of Manchester, he was preferred from a Preachers/up in Duke's Place, London, to the Master- ship cf Jesus College, Cambridge, and admittel by the Earl in person, who came to the College Chapel, put him into the master's seat, and with some uthcr formali- ties gave him the investiture of that headship, Apr. 12, 1644. He retained this situation, with much credit to himself, and advantage to the College, till Nov. 14, 1650, when his refusal of subscription to the Engage- ment occasioned his ejectment. Clarke, a calvinistic biographer, attests thai he was a man cf great let tiling, qf much prudence and piety, and of great ability and fidelity in the work qfthe ministry.

He was educated at St. Peter's College, Cambridge, where he proceeded to the degree qf M. B. in 1723. He practised, with considerable success, al Haverhill for some years ; but a fondness for company, an eccen- tricity us character, and an unfortunate propensity io drinking, by degrees diminished his practice, and reduced him to the most abject poverty. After many reverses of fortune, brought upon himself by his impru- dence, and irregularities, he sought a refuge in a sordid and miserable shed in that town, where he ended his days on the 28//* qf* February, 1767."], [309, "285 He was a person as remarkable for talent and ability, as for his great and singular prostitution of them.

'Twas in that hut, from nuptial joy apart, And the sweet bliss that glads the social heart ; Estrang'd to love's soft charm, or friendship's power, Eccentric Clodio pass'd life's last sad hour. Genius was his, a cultivated taste By every brilliant gem of science grac'd ; His was the art medicinal, to place The rose of health on beauty's faded face ; O'er pallid forms a crimson flush to spread, And make disease, pale fury ! hide his head ; From death's cold grasp the drooping youth to save, And of its tenant rob th' expecting grave. But ah ! intemp'rance shew'd her baleful charms, And lur'd the son of Galen to her arms ; Invited him to quaff the grape's rich blood, And drown his talents in a rosy flood. Reckless, at length, of fortune or of fame, Or the fair blessing of a spotless name, In mirth's mad orgies youth's sweet prime was past, Till want, gaunt phantom ! grip'd his victim fast ; Sunk in his own, and in the world's esteem, Mid rags and filth, he clos'd life's \" fev'rish dream.\" Was it for this a parent's tender care Nurtur'd, with anxious love, the hopeful heir?

Thomas Gainsborough, an admirable English artist, was born in 1727 at Sudbury, where his father was a clothier. He very early discovered a propensity to painting. Nature was his teacher, and the woods of Suffolk his academy, where he would pass in solitude his mornings, in making a sketch of an antiquated tree, a marshy brook, a few cattle, a shepherd and his flock, or any other accidental objects thai were present- ed. There was not a picturesque clump qf trees, hedge-row, stone or post at the corner of the lanes, for some miles round the place of his nativity, that he had not delineated on slips of paper, or old dirty letters which he called his riding school. In the neighbourhood qf his father was a very respectable clergyman qf the name qf Coyte. With the sons us this gentleman young Gainsburough passed much of his time. The parson's garden having been plundered qf a quantity qf wall-fruit, much pains were taken, but without effect, to discover the thief Young Gains- borough, having one summer's morning risen at an early hour, and walked into the garden to make a sketch of an old elm, seated himself in an obscure cor- ner, and had just taken out his chalk to begin, when he observed a fellow's head peeping over the wall, with the apparent intention qf seeing if the coast was clear. He made a sketch of the head of the man, and so ac- curate was the resemblance, that he was instantly known, andupon a closer enquiry proved to be the fellow, who had before robbed the garden. From delineation he got to culuuring, and after painting several land- scapes, from the age qf ten to twelve, he quilted Sud-"], [314, "290 bury, and went to London. During his residence there he married a young lady, who possessed an annuity of \u00a3200, and then retired to Ipswich, and considered himself happily settled for life. When Mr. Thicknesse was appointed Lieutenant Governor qf Landguard Fort, he found Gainsborough dwelling in a house of six pounds a year rent in that town. Himself aud his neighbours loo were strangers to his genius. Al that lime Gainsborough, seeing a coun- try fellow with a slouched hat looking wistfully over his garden wall at some windfall, pears, caught up a bit qf board, and painted him so inimitably well, that the board was shaped out, and set upon a wall in Mr. Creighton's garden, where it attracted the notice of Thicknesse, and induced many lo speak to the melan- choly looking figure. Mr. T. soon after employed him to paint a prospective view qf the Fort, the adja- cent hills, and a distant view qf Harwich, when the late king was passing it in his way to Germany. Upon Mr. T's asking this excellent, artist the price, he mo- destly said fifteen guineas. In the winter following, Mr. T. took it io town, and shewed it to Major, th, engraver. He equally admired it, and immediately engraved it. The painting unfortunately perished by hanging against a damp wall ; but the plate will ever continue to display the great talents qf these two excel- lent artists. Mr. T. soon after promoted Gainsbo- rough's removal to Bath, where he settled about 1758. In 1774, he again returned to London, and in this situation, possessed qf ample fame, and in the acqui- sition qf a plentiful fortune, he was disturbed by a cancer in his neck, which, baffling the skill of the first medical professors, brought him to his grave on Au gust 2, 1 788. He was buried, according to his request, in Kew Church-Yard. Among his amusements, mu sic was almost as much his favorite as painting ; and qf his powers in this science no belter description can be given than that by Jackson of Exeter, in his \" Four \" Ages.\" But, however trifling in these amusements, he was steady and manly in the prosecution of excel-"], [315, "291 lencc in his art, though not without some degree qf that caprice peculiar to his character. If ever, says Sir Joshua Reynolds, this nation should produce ge- nius sufficient to acquire to us the honorable distinction qf an English School, the name qf Gainsborough will be transmitted to posterity among the first qf that rising name. Whether he most excelled in portraits, land- scapes, or fancy pictures, it is difficult to determine : whether his portraits were most admirable for exact truth qf resemblance, or his landscapes for a portrait-like representation of nature, suck as we see in the works of Rubens, Rysdael, or others qf these schools. In his fancy pictures, when he had fixed upon his object qf imitation, whether it was the mean and vulgar form cf a wood-cutter, or a child qf an interesting character, as he did not attempt to raise the one, so neither did he lose any of the natural grace and elegance qfthe other, such a grace, and suck an elegance, as are more frequently found in cottages than in courts. This ex- cellence was his own, the result qf his particular ob- servation and taste. For this he was certainly not indebted to any school ; for his grace was neither acade- mical nor antique, but selected by himself from the great school qf nature. He was one of the few artists of eminence this country has produced, who never was indebted to foreign travel for his improvement and advancement in painting : Consummate artist ! say from whence you drew The precepts of thy art, so just, so true? With freedom thus, who bade thy pencil flow. Such force, such sweetness in thy colours glow! Hast thou, to give perfection to thy piece, Studied the works of ancient Rome and Greece?

Like great Contgio, Nature's pencil fraught With inborn genius, and by praciice taught, He view'd even Raphueis works, with conscious pride. And \" I'm n painter still,\" the artist cry'd ! t O er seas or alps let other artists roam, Inquest of beauties, which you find at home ; Such charms our British Nymphs alone possess, And none but Gaiiuborough's pencil can express ! Nature was his guide : and the subjects he chose for repicsentation were generally very simple, to which his own excellent taste knew how to give ex pression and value. In his landscapes, a rising mound and a few figures seated upon or near it ; with a sow or some sheep grazing, and a slight marking us distance sufficed for tie objects; their charm teas the purity of tone in the color, the free- dom and clearness of the touch , together with an agreeable combination qf the forms ; and with these simple materials does he always produce a pleasing picture. In his fancy ones, the same taste prevailed. A cottage girt ; a shepherd's boy ; a woodman ; with very slight materials in the back-ground, were treated by him with so much character, yet so much elegance, that they never fail to delight. For, Art with no common gifts her Gainsborough grae'd. Two different pencils in his hand she plac'd ; This shall command, she said, with certain aim, A perfect semblance of the human frame ; This, lightly sporting on the village green, Paint the wild beauties of the rural scene. t See Dupile's Life of Corregio."], [317, "293 Verses written on Gainsborough twenty-five Years before his Death.

Farewell, aspiring Youth ! thy race is o'er, Nor ever wilt thou serve bright glory more ; Torn from her power, and planted in the skies.

For thee, a mournful tear must e'er prevail, And veteran soldiers, wondering, tell thy tale.

Consign'd to mingle with his parent earth, His name in distant lands will ne'er be known ; Dull apathy presided at his birth, And ignorance mark'd the infant for her own Confined within the workhouse' lofty wall, When time revolving brought a holiday, Elated, he obeyed the festive call, And sallied forth with shreds of ribbands, gay. Soldiers, at wake or fair, he lov'd to meet, Their martial trophies view'd without a fear; And when in gay parade they pass'd the street, With shouting boys he follow'd in the rear.

When prying scouts explor'd his snug retreat, Unvex'd by cares that reasoning mortals goad ; Reluctant then, they forc'd him from his seat, And loud reproaches urg'd him on the road.

From the \" MARKET TOWN,\" a MS. Poem BY MR. JOHN WEBB. The Rev. John Whitmore, the unfortunate sub ject of the following verses, was for many years a resident at Helion-Bumpstead, a village in Essex about a mile and a half distant from Haver hill. He was born at Wiston in this county, ichere his father teas a miller, admitted of Caius College, Cambridge, in 1741, and proceeded to the degree of B. A. in 1744- After his derange ment, he lived entirely secluded in the house of an elderly widow, ivho took great care of him. He usual/y ivalked once a tceek to Haverhill to have his face and head shaved, always bathing the latter with some gin after the operation. He never went into company, and was very singular in his opinions and conduct, although perfectly harmless and inoffensive. He did no duly in the neighbour hood, except occasionally burying a corpse. Being once asked by a neighbouring clergyman to marry a couple for him, he positively declined performing the ceremony, alledging as his reason, that he did not chuse to encumber himself with other people's curses. His time was mostly spent in rambling through the rural scenes, which surrounded his cottage retreat ; or when at home, iu reading, and in preaching sermons\u2014 no one present. His under standing had been long impaired , and latterly become deranged; but this derangement appeared to have been much augmented by an unfortunate habit of drinking, which increased upon him towards the end of his life. In person he was tall and comely ; wore a large wig, and a very long blue great coat \u2022 and generally walked with a large staff' headed by an enormous knob. He was commonly known by the"], [328, "304 vulgar appellation of the \" draggled- tail Parson\" He died Dec. 4th, 1790, at Helion- Bump stead, and was buried there in a genteel manner : but no monument has been erected to his memory. There liv'd in yon green dale, that skirts a grove, The seat of harmless sport and rural love ; A tall dejected man, whose mien forlorn, Bespoke the victim to misfortune born. His down-cast eyes, that roll'd with vacant stare, Gave the black glance, that wait on grim despair ; His dress, and speech, and gesture, all betray'd Th' affecting symptoms of a mind decay'd. Life's morning rose o'er him serenely fair, Bright shone the sun thro' all the field of air ; Joy shed around his path, her gladsome beam, And hope dispens'd her soft illusive dream ; Health on his form bestow'd her rosy shower, While science led him thro' each classic bower. Time flew when Clerio's studious term expir'd, To a lone village cure the youth retir'd, And liv'd by all, that knew his worth, approv'd, A worthy pastor by his charge belov'd. Till love, whose nod imperial all obey, Or form'd of noble mould, or humble clay, Who 'midst the cotted vale, and courts of kings, Throws his light dart, and waves his purple wings : Till love, a soft infatuating guest, Banish'd mild peace, white fairy ! from his breast Alas ! the sacred function fail'd to prove A safe defence against the dart of love. For lo ! a nymph, in pride of youthful charms, Fill'd his untutor'd breast with soft alarms ; Her dear idea reign'd without controul, And beauty's magic spell enchain'd his soul."], [329, "305 Yet all his fond attentions could not move That proud unfeeling heart, which scorn'dhis love; A rival youth was view'd with partial eyes, And the gay stripling gain'd the beauteous prize. 'Twas Clerio's wayward fate to join their hands, Trembling the while, in Hymen's silken bands ; He gave a sanction to their nuptial bliss, And bade a long adieu to hope and peace ! Severely struck, he felt the coming storm, Conscious he could not long its rites perform, He left the church ; and sought a distant glen, And liv'd unseen, unridicul'd by men. Phrenzy like his, requir'd no keeper's force, No galling fetters e'er restrain'd his course ; Though clouds of frantic sorrow gloom'd his mind, To bird, to beast, to insect he was kind ; For hungry Robins strew'd the wheaten crumb, And shudder'd ev'n to crush the \" trodden worm.\" Nor was he cold to man, tho' craz'd with care, His heart for him the generous wish could spare ; But of the tender sex was wont to say, \" They are strange things, alas ! they'll have their \" way.\" Oft, when young spring, fair era of delight ! Charm'd with her flowery scenes the wand'rers sight, He rang'd the vales, with flowery millions gay, To breathe the aromatic sweets of May ; Or lay reclin'd, a verdant shade beneath, And wove for his lorn brow a willow wreath : Such as, (so Shakespear sings) in days of yore, Discarded, lass-lorn, slighted lovers wore. Oft too, when midnight sway'd this nether globe, And round green Nature wrapp'd her ebon robe,"], [330, "306 He sought the copse, and briar-enwoven dell. And told his soft complaint to Philomel. She, charming songstress ! musically kind, Sooth'd with mellifluous notes his wounded mind ; Till echo, waken'd by the melting strain, Wafted the tuneful woe to many a distant plain. And when rough winter, in terrific form, Loos'd from her caves the demons of the storm ; Commission'd o'er the pathless glades to sweep, Or with wild wing to vex the surgy deep : Then to his woodland haunts would he repair, And talk as to some spirit of the air, Serenely hear loud thunders shake the sky, And see, unmov'd, the vollied lightnings fly ; The vivid flash, and elemental roll, Congenial horrors ! cheer'd his gloomy soul. Revolving seasons saw him still the same, The hapless victim of a hopeles flame : Till death's kind angel sign'd a sweet release, And bade his troubled spirit rest in peace. Ah ! should it please the great all-gracious Power To take each friend that glads my social hour ; Should the grim spectre, Want, my cot assail, And turn the ruddy cheek of plenty pale : Commission'd from on high, should fell disease, Remorseless, on my dearest comforts seize : Should death's black ensign, big with funeral gloom, Wave there, and call my Hetty to the tomb : Thus try'd, thus stript, O may I be resign'd ! But spare thou dread Supreme ! 0 spare my mind !"], [331, "307 _.n <_. irsi) ON THE MUCH-LAMENTED DEATH OF THE REV. EDWARD PEARSON, D. D. \" Non omnia terra. \" Obruta ! Vivit amor, vivit dolor ! Ora negatur \" Dulcia conspicere ; at Here et meminisse relictum est.\" Petr. Ep. Lib. 7. Ep. 1. The Rev. Edward Pearson was born at Norwich in 1757 ,\" and in 1778 was entered at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, of which Society he became, suc cessively, Fellow, Tutor, and Master. He proceeded to the degree of B. A. 1782,- M.A. 1785; B.D. 1792; and D. D. 1808. In 1786, he obtained the Norrisian Prize. In 1797, he was presented by Dr. Ellislon, the Master, to the Rectory of Rempstone, Notts. In 1807, he was chosen by the Trustees lo preach the Warburtonian Lectures at Lincoln's Inn, which he completed early in 1811. In 1808, on the Death qf Dr. Elliston, the Master, and on the ineligibility qf the Rev. Francis John Hyde Wollaslon to fill that situation, he was elected; and in the same year was appointed Vice-Chancellor. In 1810, he was elected by the University to the office qf Christian Advocate. He died at his Rectory House at Rempstone, August 17, 1811, after a few days illness, and in the 5Uk year of his age. He married in 1797 Susan, the daughter qf Johnson, of Henrietta Street, Covent-Garden, who survived him, but by whom he left no issue. To a various and extensive erudition, and the most exalted christian virtues, he united a gentle benignity qf spirit, and an engaging benevolence of heart. In his general intercourse with the world, he uniformly"], [332, "308 displayed that mild and unaffected simplicity qf manners, which so strongly characterised the great Teacher of the Jewish Law, whom our divine Master dignified with the title of \" an Israelite indeed, in whom there \" was no guile.\" The sanctions qf religion and mo- rality were engraven deeply on his heart ; and in every instant of lij'e, he appeared to speak, to act, and to think, as in the sight of God. His situation in College. afforded him ample scope for the exercise cf his talents and his virtues; and his conduct as a Tutor and a Master was exemplary, and worthy qf general imita- tion. In the high and important character of the Father and Shepherd qf his flock, he was zealous and indefatigable ; and by a rigid and conscientious per formance qfthe pastoral office, he indulged his ardent inclination to promote the spiritual improvement, and . the eternal welfare qf others. Firmly and cordially attacked to the doctrine and discipline cf the Church qf England by principle and from conviction, he labored earnestly, both by his preaching and in his writings, to guard the minds of those, entrusted to his care, against errors from without, and delusions from with- in ; to retain them within the fold qf the church ; and to \"keep the unity qfthe spirit in the bond qf peace.\" In short ; in every relation qf life, whether public or private, he discharged its respective duties with sound judgment and the most scrupulous fidelity ; and by combining whatever is amiable and attractive with whatever is estimable and revered in human character and conduct approached as nearly, perhaps, to the idea of a perfectly wise and good man, as the infirmity qf human nature will permit.

After lying there some time, lie was bonndover in a recognizance of QOl to appear. at the next assizes. He attended, but did not answer when he was called. In going home, he met Sir Edmund on the road, who attempted to take him prisoner, but he rode away. Sir Edmund's servant pursued and stopped him. When Sir Edmund came up, he first lashed him with his whip, and then snatching his cane from him, laid it severely on his head and body, and sent him prisoner to Ipswich, rather than to Bury, that as he said, \" he might break *' the covey.\" From thence Mr S. sent for and obtained a Habeas Corpus for trial at the Common Pleas, where, upon declaring how lie had been used, he was discharged.

It was his honor, in a declining \" age, when others disputed away truths and duties, to stand up \" in a vigorous defence of both. He preached not himself, but \" Christ Jesus the Lord, and himself a servant for Jesus' sake. He \" never declined his work at home or abroad, but with an unwea \" ried diligence continued in it so long as he lived. He had as \"tittle regard to this world as it deserved, being much above the \" ceremony and guise of It, and ordinarily addressed himself to all \" as a citizen of heaven, in a language, proper to his own country. \" His life was a life of holiness, faith, service, and communion ; \" and as a reward thereof, he had ordinarily the peace of God \" in his soul, that passeth all understanding. His pains and inflr \" mities, his watchings and wearinesses, his persecutions and im \" prisonments, his bonds and his stripes for Jesus' sake, are all \" over.\" He published \" Au Antidote against Quakerism\" ; antf \" Doctrine and Instructions ; or a Catechism touching many weigh \"ty points in Divinity, 1674.\" He had likewise two Disputatious with George Whitehead, and other Quakers,"], [341, "317 Here, too, liv'd Cobb *, in Mary's blood-stain'd days, Whose pious worth transcends my feeble praise ; Who the fierce threats of popish priests withstood, Avow'd the truth, and seal'd it with his blood : Th' unconquer'd spirit smil'd at death's grin, frown, Soar'd to the skies, and gain'd a martyr's crown !

Being a rigid Protestant, he was apprehended by his neighbours for heresy, and examined by the Rev. Michael Dunning, chancel lor of Norwich, who put to him the common ensnaring question, whether he believed that Christ was really aud substantially in the Sacrament? To which Cobb gravely answered, the body of Christ, bom of the Virgin Mary, was in heaven, and otherwise he did not or could not believe, because he read, in the scripture, that Christ did thither ascend, and cannot find that he ever de scended, and so cannot be bodily in the Sacrament. 'I he chancel lor again asked him, whether he would obey the laws of the realm of England, made for the unity of the faith? He answered, that his body should be at the King's and Queen's commandment, so far as the law of God would allow, but his faith should be ruled by the word of God, the only centre of christian unity ; for there is but one faith. These answers were deemed heretical, and he was condemned to the stake, Aug. l\u00a3th, 1555, and in Sept. following suffered martydom at Thetford. t Samuel Fairclough was born April 20th 1594, at Haverhill, where his father was an able minister, and was the youngest of fiiur sons. He was educated at Queen's College, Cambridge, and was there supposed to be puritanically inclined. At an early age, he was private tutor to Mr. Compton, afterwards Earl of North ampton, and was chosen to act the part of Suida, in the comedy of Ignoramus, which he obstinately refused, though strongly soli cited, and even laughed at for his refusal by the Vice Chancellor.

They resided at the Hall, a fine old mansion in that parish, and produced many persons under Mr. John Ward, Lecturer of Haverhill, who had a hearty love for him, and preached about occasionally at the chief town. in Essex and Suffolk, with great acceptance and success. He was successively Lecturer at Lynn, and Clare, and afterwards Hector of Barnardiston, aud Kedingtou, to which benefices he was pre- sented by his great friend and patron, Sir Nathaniel Barnardiston. At Kedington, he continued nearly thirty-five years preaching four times a week, twice on the LordVday, a thursday lecture, and on the Saturday evening, in preparation for the sabbath. His thursday lectures (for which a license was purchased at a great rate) were Condones ad Clemm, all the ministers for many miles round constantly attending them, and often ten or twenty scholars and fellows of colleges from Cambridge. His other sermons were ad popitium ; to plain country people, who flocked from all parts to hear him. He was nominated one of the Assembly of Divines, but was excused from attending, and he absolutely refused to take the engagement. He was offered the Mastership of Trinity College, Cambridge, but declined it from a love of retirement, which induced him to avoid all public trusts \u2022 In 1662, he was ejected for non-conformity, and was succeeded In the Rectory of Kedington by Mr. afterwards Archbishop Tillotson. Although he and his family lost above a 1000_ per ann\u00ab by his non-conformi- ty, he was always cheerful. He had the comfort of residing for some time in the same house with two of his sons, and two of his sons in-law, at Finchinglield. After some time, he removed to the habitations of his daughters atHaveningham and Stowmarket, suc- cessively, and spent the remainder of his life in solitude and _ _cied exercises, patiently waiting for his change, which he at last cheer- fully welcomed, when he was 84 years of age, on the 14th of Dec. 1677- Fairclough was one of the most finished scholars, and celebrated preachers among the moderate puritans of his time. His discour- ses were well-digested, and carefully committed to writing, before they were publicly delivered* He had then his notes constantly before him : but such was the stength of his memory, that he was scarcely ever seen to turn his eyes from the audience. He was a man of a public spirit, who scorned to prefer his own private con cerns to the general good of the church and state. He had entirely devoted himself to the service of the public, and as long a_ he had strength he cheerfully improved every talent to the honor of that _ vd, who had intrusted him with it."], [343, "319 of distinguished eminence.

WILLIAM HUMPHRYES: BY MR. JOHN WEBB. The Rev. William Humphryes was educated at a school at Brompton^ and entered himself as a student at the academy at Homer ton, in 1778. On leaving this academy, lie was invited to preach to a small and de cayed congregation at Haverhill, where he was ordained December 10, 1783. Here he was the devoted and exemplary pastor qfan increasing country congregation. His pulpit labours were highly esteemed ; and his"], [349, "325 attention lo the families and individuals qf his flock was unremitting. But in 1791 he was compelled, through ill-health, to resign his charge, and return to London. In the spring cf 1792, his health being con- siderably improved, he accepted the office of pastor qf a congregation at Hammersmith, which he retained with the greatest credit to himself, and advantage to his flock till July 10th, 1808, when, by the rupture qf a blood-vessel, he was compelled for ever to resign his ministry. As soon as he was a little recovered, he was recommended to take a journey for change qf air, and accordingly he repaired to his friend, the Rev. Mr. Gurteen, at Canterbury. Here he spent nearly five weeks ; but during the last fortnight his health very rapidly declined. Finding that he was daily getting worse, he expressed a desire to return home ; and quitted Canterbury September the 27th. On reach- ing Hammersmith, he was almost exhausted, and on the following morning he breathed his last, in the 46th year qf his age. As a friend, he was most affectionate. His judgment was sound, his affections warm, and his counsel wise and disinterested. In the higher charac- ter qf a christian, he was eminently pious, a most holy and consistent professor qf the Gospel, a scribe well instructed in the kingdom qf heaven, and actively per- severing in that holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord. He was interred in the Dissenters' burial ground, Bunhill Fields, October 6th, 1808, when an excellent address was delivered at the grave by his friend the Rev. W. Jay, qf Bath, which was printed, together with the funeral discourse preached on the following Sunday at Hammersmith, by the Rev. R. Winter, to a very crowded and much-affected au- dience, under the following title, \" Sermon occasioned \" by the death qfthe Rev.

For these performances he sometimes receives a crown, half-crown, or sixpence ; and frequently, in lieu of money, a meal. He is a person of mild, unassuming, and inoffensive manners, and possesses a mind strongly tinctured with a sense of religion. His general appearance is wretched in the extreme. For many years he has wandered about different villages, subsisting entirely on the charity of the inhabitants, and such passengers as are moved to pity by his forlorn and miserable appearance. He constantly ranges about in all weathers, from morn ing to night, and seems insensible of the worst. In"], [353, "329 this wretched manner does he subsist, always sleep ing in the fields, an out-housc, or under some hedge, wherever night happens to overtake him.

Straw's my couch, no sheets, nor bedding, Ponderous snow dissolving lies ;\u2014 When I wake, no carpel treading, Fleecy snow its place supplies. No grand tap'stry decorating These drear walls, now moist with snow ; Nought my mind exhilarating, Doom'd alas! to pungent woe! Snow, which boreal blasts are whirling, Rapid thro' the ambient air ; Gain'st my sordid vestment hurling, Dims my eyes, and chills my hair. This vile raiment hangs in tatters ; No warm garment to defend ; O'er my flesh the chill snow scatters\u2014 No snug hut, no social friend ! Though by cold severe I perish, No warm viands friends impart ! No rich cordial wine to cherish. Or revive my languid heart. In heav'n no gelid thrillings enter. There's a rich exhaustless store !

In IS 10 Mr. John Cordy, of Worlingworth, very kindly and humanely interested himself in behalf qf the poor itinerant Poetaster, and published a state- ment of his case in the Ipswich Journal, which induced the late Duchess of Chandos, the Countess of Dysart, Lord Henniker, Sfc. to send donations to him for the use qf this solitary wanderer. A plan ivas accordingly formed to make him station- ary ; but an attempt might as well have been.made to hedge in the cuckoo ! A cottage was hired at Worlingworth and furnished, and his \" Poems \" ivere to have been printed for his benefit. But alas ! a scene of humble comfort seemed neither grateful to his mind, nor auspicious to his muse ; for after residing there a month or two, he set off on one of his peregrinations, and returned no more. Custom doubtless had ivrought such a habit in his nature, that he really would have preferred the soli- tude of a sordid shed to the splendid enjoyment of a palace, and a bed of straw to a couch of down. When the following lines were written he was then a wanderer about Haverhill : but about the year 1790, he suddenly quitted that place, and never afterwards returned. He is now frequently at Framlingham, in a miserable shed at the back of the town, and daily walks io Earl Soham, or some qfthe neighbouring villages. He is, most probably, the last of the Suffolk Minstrels :"], [356, "332 \" The Last of all the Bards was He \" For, well-a-day ! their date was fled, \" His tuneful brethren all were dead ; \" And he, neglected aud oppress'd, \" Wished to be with them, and at rest.\" He is now in the 70th year of his age, and has been in the constant habit of wandering about the country, in this singular and abject condition, from the age of iQ. Near yonder bridge, that strides the ripling brook, A hut once stood, in small sequester'd nook, Where Chambers lodg'd : though not of gipsy race, Yet, like that tribe, he often chang'd his place. A lonely wand'rer he, whose squalid form Bore the rude peltings of the wintry storm : An hapless outcast, on whose natal day No star propitious beam'd a kindly ray ; By some malignant influence doom'd to roam The world's wide, dreary waste, and know no home.

A modern reader would suspect that many of the salutary maxims of this old Poem had decorated the margins, and illustrated the calendars of an ancient almanac. It is valuable, therefore, as a genuine picture of the agriculture, the rural arts, and the domestic \u00e6conomy and customs of our in dustrious ancestors in this county. In this account of husbandry implements, Tusser takes up no less than eighty lines, and these lines consist of mere names tacked together, with scarcely an epithet that is not necessary. He likewise re commends the farmer to provide himself with a double set of the most necessary implements, to prevent any suspension of his ivork by accident. Barn-lockeq, gofe-ladder, short pitchfork, and long,* Flail, straw fork, and rake, with a fan that is strong; t \u2022 A Gofe is a mow ; and the Gofe ladder is for the thresher lo ascend and descend in order to throw down the sheaves with the assistance of the short Pitchfork, while the long was for pitching the straw. t The Straw fork and Rake were to turn the straw from ofF the threshed corn ; and the lun and Wing to cleau it. z 3"], [370, "346 Wing, car tnaveif and bushel, peck, strike ready hand, Get casting shouel, \u00a7 broom, and a sack with a band.

CAROL FOR St. EDMUND'S DAY. \"Synge we nowe alle a su Ave rei gentis Anglorum.\" The circumstances relating to St. Edmund, says the Historian qf Bury, which took place on the retreat qf the Danes, and which have formed a favorite theme for the monkish writers, and a favorite subject for their painters and sculptors, are given with miraculous embellishments, and with various degrees qf amplifica- tion, by most qfthe monastic poets and historians. To offer the utmost indignity to the martyred King, the Pagans cast his severed head and body into the thickest part qf the woods at Eglesdene. When the departure qf the Danes removed the terror which their presence had inspired, the East Anglians, prompted by affection for their late Sovereign, assembled, in con- siderable numbers, to pay his corpse ike last duties qf t A triangular spade. J Soles mean coarse leather soling for shoes, which formerly husbandmen and their servants applied, as wauicd."], [374, "350 attachment. After a sorrowful search, the body was discovered, conveyed to the neighbouring village, Hoxne, and there interred ; but the head could not be found. These zealous and dutiful subjects, therefore, divided themselves into small parties, and searched every part qfthe wood. Terrified by its thickness and obscurity, some qf them cried out to their companions, \" where are \" you ?\" A voice answered, \" here, here, here ! \" They hastened to the place whence the sound proceeded, and found the long-sought head in a thicket qf thorns, guarded by a wof, \" an unkouth thyng and strange \" ageyn nature.\" The people almost overpowered with joy, with all possible veneration, took the holy head, which its guardian quietly surrendered lo them, and carried it lo the body. The friendly wolf joined in the procession ; and after seeing \" the precious treasure,\" that he had with so muck care protected, deposited with the body, returned into the woods with doleful mourn- ing. The head was some time after observed lo have united with the body ; and the mark of separation appeared round the neck like a \" purpil thread.\" His martyrdom is thus described by Langtofl : Elfride had a kosyn, that kyng was of scheld, Northfolk and Southfulk of Elliide be held. That was Saynt Edmunde the ermine that tyme bare, A duke of Danmark, his name was inguare.

The obsequies qfthe martyred King were dignified by no august solemnities ; and his body, \" buried in t/te \"earth,\" lay neglected \"in the obscure chapel'' at Hoxne for 33 years, when the sacred remains were removed to Bedericksworth, since called St. Edmund's Bury, where a church of timber was erected over the place of his interment, which remained till King Ca nutus, in 1020, built a most magnificent church and abbey in honour qfthe holy martyr, St. Edmund was considered by succeeding Kings as their special patron, and as an accomplished model of all royal virtues. The feast of St. Edmund, November the 9.0th, was ranked amongst the holydays qf precept in this kingdom by the national council qf Oxford, in 1222, and was observed at Bury with the most splendid and joyous solemnities. We find that, upon this festival, 150 tapers qf lib weight or more illuminated the abbey church, its altars, and its windows.

At Christmas, the hardness of winter doth rage, A griper of all things, and specially age : Then lightly t poor people, the young with the old, Be sorest oppressed with hunger and cold. At Christmas, by labour is little to get, That wanting, \u2014 the poorest in danger are set ; What season then better, of all the whole year, Thy needy, poor neighbour to comfort and cheer. At this time and that time, some make a great matter; Some help not, but hinder the poor with their clatter, Take custom from feasting, what cometh then last? Where one hath a dinner, a hundred shall fast. To dog in the manger, some liken I could, That hay will eat none, nor let other that would. Some scarce, in a year, give a dinner or two, Nor well can abide any other to do. Play thou the good fellow ! seek none to misdeem ; Disdain not the honest, though merry they seem ; For oftentimes seen, no more very a knave, Than he that doth counterfeit most to be grave. Good husband and huswife, now chiefly be glad, Things handsome to have, as they ought to be had. They both do provide, against Christmas do come, To welcome good neighbour, good cheer to have some. \u2022 A contraction for good hnsbandmen. t An old form of expression.

From \" this prodigious number of hands, the whole business, \" except some smaller parcels put out by the job, must \" have been soon finished. \"Share were probably two \" principal days ; for two large parties were hired, \" every year, for one day each.

Make siier of reapers, get harvest in hand, The corn that is ripe doth but shed as it stand ; Be thankful to God, for his benefits sent, And willing to save it, with earnest intent. To let out thy harvest, by great, or by day, Let this by experience lead thee the way : By great will deceive thee, with ling'ring it out, By day will dispatch, and put all out of doubt. Grant harvest lord* more, by a penny or two, To call on his fellows the better to do : Give gloves to thy reapers, a largess to cry, And daily to loiterers have a good eye. * The lord of harvest was generally some stayed, sober-working man, who understood all sorts of harvest work. If he was of able body, he commonly led the swarth in reaping and mowing. It was customary to give gloves to the reapers, especially where the wheat was thistly. A A 3"], [386, "362 Reap well, scatter not, gather clean that is shorn, Bind fast, shock apace, have an eye to thy corn ; Load safe, carry home, follow time being fair, Gove just in the barn, J it is out of despair. Tithe duly and truly, with hearty good will, That God and his blessing may dwell with thee still ; Though parson neglecteth his duty for this, Thank thou thy Lord God, and give ev'ry man his. Corn tithed, Sir Parson, together go get, And cause it on shocks to be by and by set ; Not leaving it scattering abroad on the ground. Nor long in the field, but away with it round. If weather be fair, and tidy thy grain, Make speedily carriage, for fear of a rain ; For tempest and showers deceiveth a many, And lingering lubbers lose many a penny. In goving at harvest, learn skilfully how Each grain for to lay by itself on a mow : Seed-barley, the purest, gove out of the way, All other nigh hand, gove as just as ye may.

In harvest-time, harvest-folks, servants and all. Should make, all together, good cheer in the hall ; And fill out the black bowl of blythe to their song, And let them be merry all harvest-time long.

Here, midst the boldest triumphs of her worth, Nature herself invites the reapers forth ; Dares the keen sickle from its twelvemonth's rest, And gives that ardour, which in every breast From infancy to age alike appears. When the first sheaf its plumy top uprears. No rake takes here what heaven to all bestows \u2014 Children of want, for you the bounty flows ! And every cottage from the plenteous store Receives a burden nightly at its door. Hark ! where the sweeping scythe now rips along : Each sturdy mower emulous and strong ; Whose writhing form meridian heat defies, Bends o'er his work, and every sinew tries ; Prostrates the waving treasure at his feet, But spares the rising clover, short and sweet. Come, Health ! come. Jollity ! light-footed come ; Here hold your revels, and make this your home. Each heart awaits and haUs you as its own ; Each moisten'd brow, that scorns to wear a frown : Th' unpeopled dwelling mourns its tenants stray'd ; E'en the domestic laughing dairy maid Hies to the field, the general toil to share. Meanwhile the farmer quits his elbow-chair, His cool brick-floor, his pitcher, and his ease, And braves the sultry beams, and gladly sees His gates thrown open, and his team abroad, The ready group attendant on his word, To turn the swarth, the quiv'ring load to rear, Or ply the busy rake, the land to clear. Summer's light garb itself now cumb'rous grown, Each his thin doublet in the shade throws down ;"], [389, "365 Where oft the mastiff sculks with half-shut eye, And rouses at the stranger passing by ; Whilst unrestrain'd the social converse flows, And every breast love's powerful impulse knows, And rival wits with more than rustic grace Confess the presence of a pretty face. Now noon gone by, and four declining hours, The weary limbs relax their boasted pow'rs ; Thirst rages strong, the fainting spirits fail, And ask the sov'reign cordial, home-brewed ale Beneath some shelt'ring heap of yellow corn Rests the hoop'd keg, and friendly cooling horn, That mocks alike the goblet's brittle frame, Its costlier potions, and its nobler name. To Mary first the brimming draught is given, By toil made welcome as the dews of heaven, And never lip that press'd its homely edge Had kinder blessings or a heartier pledge.

In the same year he teas pit sensed to the Rectory of Flowton, and to the Vicarage of Brandeston.

THE PLOUGHMAN'S FEASTING DAYS : BY THOMAS TUSSER. \" The Five Hundred Points of Husbandry \" abound with many curious particulars, that bespeak the manners, customs, aud modes of living in this county, from the year 1520 to about half a century after. Though popery was legally abolished at the period when this was written; yet protestants did not think it necessary, <ts a pledge of their reformation, to renounce those festive, or fasting days, which it had either recommended or tolerated. Among the former, the \" Ploughman's Feasting Days \" seem to have been duly observed, either partially or generally, throughout most parts of England, in our author's time ; and in recommending \" old guise - \" to be kept,\" he certainly, in this respect at least, did not deviate from his protestant creed."], [394, "370 This would not be slipt Old guise must be kept. Good huswives, whom God hath enriched enough, Forget not the feasts, that belong to the plough ; The meaning is only to joy and be glad, For comfort, with labour, is fit to be had. Plough Monday.* Plough Monday, next after that Twelfthtide is past, Bids out with the plough, the worst husband is last, If ploughman get hatchet, or whip to the screen, Maids loseth their cock, if no water be seen, Shrovetide. t At Shrovetide to shroving, go thresh the fat hen, If blindfold can kill her, then give it thy men. Maids, fritters and pancakes enow see ye make, Let slut have one pancake, for company sake. * Plough Monday was to remind the cultivators of the earth of their proper business; and a spring was given to the activity of domestics, by sortie peculiar observances. The men and maid servants strove to outvie each other in early rising, on Plough Monday. It the ploughman could get any of the implements of his vocation by the fireside, before the maid could put on her kettle, she forfeited her shrovetide cock. The evening concluded with a good sapper. t The custom alluded to in this stanza is now probably quite ob solete. I describe it on the authority of i nl ii.au, who seems to have \u25a0witnessed its celebration. \"The hen is hung at a fellow's back, who has al_o some horse bells about him; the rest of the fellows are blinded, and have boughs in their hands, with which they chuse this fellow and his hen about some large court or small enclosure. The fellow with his hen and hells shifting as well a. 3ie can, they follow the sound, and sometimes hit him and his hen ; other times, if he can get behind one of them, they thresh one another well favouredly ; but the jest is, the maids are to blind the fellows, which they do with their aprons, and the cunning baggages \"will endear their sweethearts with a peeping -hole, whilst the others look out as sharp to hinder it. After this, the hen is boiled with bacon; and a store of pancakes and fritters are made. She that is noted for lying a-bed long, or any other miscarriage, hath the first pancake presented to her, which most commonly fall to the dog's share at last, for no one will own it their due.\""], [395, "371 Sheep-Shearing.

The cows of Suffolk have long been celebrated for the abundance of their milk, which, considering their size, and the quantity of food, far exceeds the produce of any other race in the island. Though the peculiar breed of this county is spread all over it, yet a tract of twenty miles by twelve is more especially the scat of the Dairies. This space is comprehended within a line drawn from the parish of Coddenham lo Asltbocking, Otley, Charsfield, Letheringham, Hacheston, Parham,Framlingham, Cransford, Brusyard, Badingham, Sibton, He veningham, Cookley, Linstcad, Metfield, Wethers dale, Fressingfield, Wingfield, Hoxne, Brome, Thrandeston, Gislingham . Finningham, Westhorp, Wyverston, dipping, Stonham, Creeling, and again to Coddenham. The breed is universally polled; and the size small, few rising, when fattened, to above 50 stone at 14/6. each. The characteristics qf this breed are, a clean throat, with little dew lap ; a thin, clean snake head ; thin legs ; a very large carcase ; a rib tolerably springing from the centre of the back, but with a heavy belly ; back-bone ridged ; chine, thin and hollow ; loin narrow ; udder large, loose, and creased when empty ; milk-veins remark ably large, and rising in knotted puff's to the eye ; a general habit of leanness ; hip-bones high and ill covered ; and scarcely any part of the carcase so formed and covered as to please the eye accustomed to fat beasts qf the finer breeds. The best milkers are in general red, krindled, or of a yellowish cream colour. The quantity of milk yielded by one of"], [397, "373 these cows is from five to eight gallons a day. Ji hen the quantity of milk, in any breed, is very great, that of butter is rarely equal. It is thus in Suffolk ; the quantity of milk is more extraordinary than that of butter. The average of all the dairies, in the district, may be estimated at three firkins ; and three-fourths of a whey of cheese per cow, clear to the factor's hands, after supplying the consump tion of the family. The quantity of butter com puted to be sent from Suffolk to London annually is about 4,O,O0Ofirkins. The Suffolk butter is much esteemed; but alas! those, who make good butter, must, of course, make bad cheese ; and therefore the generality of Suffolk cheese is well known to be as remarkably bad, as the butter is excellent. But in those districts, ivhcre little or no butter is churned, as good cheese is made as any in the kingdom, being little, if at all, inferior to that of Stilton. Unrivall'd stands thy country cheese, O Giles; Whose very name alone engenders smiles ; Whose fame abroad by every tongue is spoke, The well-known butt of many a flinty joke,* That pass like current coin the nation through; And, ah ! experience proves the satire true. Provision's grave, thou ever craving mart, Dependant, huge metropolis ! where art Her pouring thousands stows in breathless rooms, Midst pois'nous smokes and steams, and rattling looms ; * Hil ger will break through stone. walls, or any thing, except Suffolk cheese, says Ray. Suffolk cheese, from its poverty, saj-s Grose, is frequently the subject of much humour. It is by some represented as only (it for making wheels lor wheelbarrows; and a story is told,thata parcel of Suffolk cheese being packed up in an iron chest, and put on board a ship bound to the Hast Indies, the rats, allured by the scent, eat through the chest, but could not penetrate the cheese.

The following lines exhibit a correct picture qf the farmer's mode qf living, in this County, at the period when Tusser wrote. In this respect it is highly in- teresting ; and though we find few delicacies of an expensive kind, every thing is substantial and whole- some though plain, \u2014 a just representation of the Eli- zabethan age. Salt meat, and fish both fresh and salted, it is evident, were standing articles qf diet. A plot set down for farmer's quiet, As time requires, to frame his diet : With sometimes fish, and sometimes fast, That household store may longer last. Let Lent, well kept, offend not thee, For March and April breeders be : Spend herring first, save salt-fish last, For salt-fish is good, when Lent is past. When Easter comes, who knows not than That veal and bacon is the man ;* And Martilmas beef t doth bear good tack, When country folks do dainties lack, When Macrell ceaseth from the seas, John Baptist brings grass-beef and pease.

Behold the sound oak table's massy frame Bestride the kitchen floor ! the careful dame And gen'rous host invite their friends around, WThile all that clear'd the crop, or till 'd the ground Are guests by right of custom .-...old and young, And many a neighbouring yeoman join the throng, With artizans that lent their dext'rous aid, When o'er each field the flaming sun-beams play'd. \u2014 Yet plenty reigns, and from her boundless hoard, Though not one jelly trembles on the board, Supplies the feast with all that sense can crave ; Writh all that made our great forefathers brave, Ere the cloy'd palate countless flavours try'd, And cooks had nature's judgment set aside. With thanks to heaven, and tales of rustic lore, The mansion echoes when the banquet's o'er ; A wider circle spreads, and smiles abound, As quick the frothing horn performs its round ; Care's mortal foe, that sprightly joys imparts To cheer the frame and elevate their hearts. Here, fresh and brown, the hazel's produce lies In tempting heaps, and peals of laughter rise, b b 3"], [402, "378 And crackling music, with the frequent song, Unheeded bear the midnight hour along. Here once a year distinction low'rs its crest, The master, servant, and the merry guest, Are equal all ; and round the happy ring The reaper's eyes exulting glances fling, And, warm'd with gratitude, he quits his place, With sun-burnt hands and ale-enliven'd face, Refills his jug his honour'd host to tend, To serve at once the master and the friend ; Proud thus to meet his smiles, to share his tale, His nuts, his conversation, and his ale. THE HAVERHILL MATCHSELLER : A SUFFOLK TALE. BY MR. JOHN WEBB. The unfortunate subject of the following verses is still living, and residing at Haverhill. See yonder abject, squalid form, on which Disease and want their baleful phials pour ; Upon whose faded cheek, so ghastly pale, Dull grief has plough'd deep furrows. \u2014 Ah! that eye Has lost its wonted lustre : on the ground 'Tis fix 'd intent, nor heeds proud fashion's son, Who flutters by it ; like the gilded fly, That wantons in gay summer's fervid beam, And sips sweet nectar from the flowers of June."], [403, "379 How slow he moves ! his better hand a staff Grasps hard, with rude enormous knob, Such as our antique grandsires us'd, what time Fair Anna rul'd, and gallant Marlb'rough fought. But mark ! his left, a small and wither'd stump, A basket holds with sordid matches fill'd. \" Poor mendicant ! methinks thy hand was lost \" In fighting for thy country and for me ! \u2022' I'll tarry till thou com'st, and to my cot \" Invite thee \u2014 woe-worn wretch ! my mantling ale \" Shall rouse thy drooping spirits, make thy heart, \" That seldom knows the pulse of joy, rejoice.\" 'Tis done \u2014 the lazy loitering crimson tide Bounds, with a rapid current, thro' his veins : His eye emits a ray replete with fire ; And features, long bedew'd with mis'ry's tear. Brighten in smiles. \u2014 Thus oft, when nature mourns Her verdant realms deform'd by drizzly showers, Forth looks the golden sun, and glads the scene. \" Friend,\" cries the happy beggar, \" by that look Inquisitive, I judge that thou would' st like To hear my tale of woe : \u2014 tis all I can \u2014 That little all I give. In yon green vale, that's water'd by a stream, Unknown to song, for there no woodland bard, As genius prpmpted, tun'd his artless reed ; Where beauteous landscapes charm the curious eye ; Where flowers, of every hue, regale the sense ; And congregated songsters feast the ear, With soft mellifluous symphonies, I drew My infant breath, and enter'd life's new scene : My father till'd a small, but fertile farm,"], [404, "380 Which well supply'd his household.

Full largely of his bounty I partook : He wept my helpless state. \u2014 No battle stroke, Edge of keen sword, or cannon's murd'rous ball, Depriv'd me of my hand ; for I alas ! Was a lorn cripple, even from my birth. Parental kindness, like a guardian seraph, Was ever hov'ring o'er me for my good : But ere his plan of kindness was fulfill' d, I shed the tear-drop o'er his early bier. Ah me ! though young, I heav'd a heartfelt sigh, When his lov'd form repos'd on earth's cold breast ; I deeply felt his loss, and feel it stUl, Tho' grief has sapp'd, and black misfortune's storm Has shook the seat of mem'ry to its base !

But short the reign of sublunary bliss, Bright as the drop that gems the bending thorn, Alas ! as short liv'd too : for human joy, (Like the perceptive plant) recoils in haste From grim misfortune's felon touch, and shrinks, And falls to earth. \u2014 WhUe thus supremely blest, I soon forgot the sense of former ills. A lovely girl and boy our union crown'd : But while we fondly idolized our babes, We liv'd unmindful of that gracious source, From whence our blessings and our mercies flow'd. The power we ceas'd to homage was incens'd, And soon destroy'd our idols.

Still I hid From my dear mate the anguish of my heart, And sought to soothe the tempest in her breast With sympathy's mild balm.

A DESCRIPTION OF HUSWIFERY: BY THOMAS TUSSER. Tusser, says Stillingflcet, wrote from practice. He appears to have been a good-natured, cheerful man, and though a lover of \u0153conomy, far from meanness, as appears in many of his precepts, wherein he shews his disapprobation of that pitiful spirit, which makes farmers starve their cattle, their land, and every thing belonging to them ; chusing rather to lose a pound than spend a shilling. This '* Book of Huswifery,\" as it may be called, presents a genuine picture qf the domestic \u0153conomy of the Suffolk and Essex farmers, in the reign of Elizabeth, ivith the labours and duties of the day, as they return in endless succession. Now listen, good huswives, what doings are here, Set forth for a day, as it should for a year : Both easy to follow, and soon to atchieve, For such as by huswifery looketh to thrive. The forenoon affairs, till dinner (with some) Then afternoon doings, till supper-time come ; With breakfast and dinner time, sup and to bed, Stand, orderly placed, to quiet thine head."], [408, "384 ', The meaning is this \u2014 for a day what ye see, That monthly and yearly continued must be ; And hereby to gather, (as prove I intend,) That huswifery matters have never an end Morning Works. No sooner some up, But nose is in cup. Get up in the morning as soon as thou wilt, With over-long slugging, good servant is spilt. Some slovens, from sleeping no sooner get up, But hand is in aumbry,* and nose in the cup. That early is done, Count huswifely won. Some work in the morning may trimly be done, That all the day after can hardly be won. Good husband, without, it is needfull there be, Good huswife, within, is as needful as he. Cast dust into yard, And spin and go card. Sluts' corners avoided, shall further thy health, Much time about trifles shall hinder thy wealth. Let some to peel hemp, or else rushes to twine. To spin, or to card, or to seething of brine. Grind malt for to drink, See meat do not stink. Set some about cattle, some pasture to view, Some malt to be grinding, against ye do brew. Some cometh, some brineth, some will not be taught, Where meat is attainted, their cookery is naught. \u2022 A Cupboard to hold victuals."], [409, "385 Breakfast Doings. To breakfast that come, Give every one some. Call servants to breakfast, by day-star appear, A snatch, and to work \u2014 fellows tarry not here. Let huswife be carver, let pottage be heat, A mess to each one, with a morsell of meat. No more tittle tattle, Go serve your cattle. WTiat tack in a pudding, saith greedy gut wringer, Give such, ye wot what, ere a pudding he finger. Let servants once served thy cattle go serve, Lest often ill serving make cattle to sterve. Dinner Blatters. For hunger or thirst, Serve cattle well first, By noon, see your dinner be ready and neat, Let meat tarry servant, nor servant his meat. Plough-cattle, a baiting, call servant to dinner, The thicker together, the charges the thinner. Together is best, For hostis and guest. Due season is best, altogether is gay. Dispatch hath no fellow, make short and away. Beware of Gill Laggoose disordering thy house, Mo dainties who catcheth, than crafty fed mouse ! Let such have enough, That follow the plough. Give servants no dainties, but give him enough, Too many chaps walking do beggar the plough. Poor seggons,* half starved, work faintly and dull, And lubbers do loiter, their bellies too full. \u2022 A poor starveling labourer."], [410, "386 Give never too much, To lazy, and such. Feed lazy, that thresheth, a flap and a tap, Like slothfull, that alway be stopping a gap. Some litherly lubber more eateth than two, Yet leaveth undone what another will do. Where nothing will last, Spare such as thou hast, Some cutteth thy linen, some spoileth thy broth, Bare table to some doth as well as a cloth, Treent dishes be homely, and yet not to lack. Where stone is no laster, take tankard and jack. Knap boy on the thumbs, And save him his crumbs. That pewter is never for mannerly feasts, That daily do serve so unmannerly beasts. Some gnaweth and leaveth some crusts and some crumbs, Eat such their own leavings, or gnaw their own thumbs. Serve God ever first ; Take nothing at worst. At dinner, at supper, at morning, at night, Give thanks unto God, for his gifts so in sight. Good husband and huswife will sometimes, alone,. Make shift with a morsell, and pick of a bone. Enough thou art told ; Too much will not hold. Three dishes well dressed, and welcome with all, Both pleaseth thy friend, andbecometh thine hall. Enough is a plenty, too much is a pride, The plough, with ill holding, goes quickly aside. iWooden."], [411, "387 Afternoon Works. Make company break ; Go cherish the weak. When dinner is ended, set servant to work, And follow such fellows, as loveth to lurk. To servant in sickness see nothing ye grutch, A thing of a trifle shall comfort him much. Who many do feed, Save much they had need. Put chippings in dippings, use parings to save, Fat capons or chickens that lookest to have. Save drippings and skimmings, how ever ye do, For med'cine for cattle, for cart, and for shoe. Leave capon unmeet, Dear fed is unsweet. Such off corn as cometh, give wife to her fee, Feed willingly such as do help to feed thee. Though fat feed is dainty, yet this I thee warn, Be cunning in fatting, for robbing thy barn. Piece hole to defend ; Things timely amend. Good sempsters be sewing of fine pretty knacks, Good huswives be mending, and piecing their sacks. Though making and mending be huswifely ways, Yet mending in time is the huswife to praise. Buy new as is meet, Mark blanket and sheet. Though ladies may rend, and buy new every day, Good huswives must mend, and buy new as they may. Call quarterly servants to court and to leet ;t Write every coverlid, blanket, and sheet 1To account."], [412, "388 Shift slovenly elf, Be jailor thyself. Though shifting too oft be a thief in a house, Yet shift slut and sloven, for fear of a louse. Grant Doubtfull no key of his chamber in purse, Lest chamber door lockt be to thievery a nurse. Save feathers for guest, These other rob chest. Save wing for a thresher,, when gander doth die, Save feathers of all thing, the softer to lie. Much spice is a thief, so is candle and fier, Sweet sauce is as crafty, as ever was frier. Wife, make thine own candle, Spare penny to handle. Provide for thy tallow, ere frost cometh in, And make thine own candle, ere winter begin. If penny for all thing be suffered to trudge, Trust long not to penny, to have him thy drudge. Evening Works. Time drawing to night, See all things go right. When hens go to roost, go in hand to dress meat, Serve hogs, and to milking, and some to serve neat. Where twain be enow, be not served with three, More knaves in a company, worser they be. Make lackey to trudge, Make servant thy drudge. For every trifle leave jaunting thy nag, But rather make lackey of Jack-boy, thy wag. Make servant at night lug in wood or a log, Let none come in empty, but slut and thy dog. \"fA duster."], [413, "389 False knave ready prest, All safe is the best.

Thou woman, whom pity becometh the bestj Grant all that hath laboured time to take rest. Supper Matters. Use mirth and good word, At bed and at board. Provide for thy husband, to make him good cheer, Make merry together, while time ye be here. At bed and at board, howsoever befall, Whatever God sendeth, be merry withall. No brawling make, No jealousy take. No taunts before servants for hindering of fame, No jarring too loud for avoiding of shame. As frensy and heresy roveth together, So jealousy leadeth a fool, ye wot whither. Tend such as ye have, Stop talkative knave. Young children and chickens would ever be eating, Good servants look duly for gentle entreating.

After- Supper Matters. Thy soul hath a clog ; Forget not thy dog. Remember those children, whose parents be poor, Which hunger, yet dare not to crave at thy door. Thy bandog, that serveth for divers mishaps, Forget not to give him thy bones and thy scraps. Make keys to be keepers, To bed, ye sleepers. Where mouths be many to spend that thou hast, Set keys to be keepers, for spending too fast. To bed after supper, let drowsy go sleep, Lest knave in the dark to his marrow do creep. Keep keys as thy life ; Fear candle, good wife. Such keys lay up safe, ere ye take ye to rest, Of dairy, of buttery, of cupboard and chest. Fear candle in hayloft, in barn, and in shed, Fear flea-smock and mendbreech, for burning their bed. See door lockt fast, Two keys make wast. A door without lock is a bait for a knave, A lock without key is a fool that will have. One key to two locks, if it break is a grief; Two keys to one lock, in the end is a thief."], [415, "391 Night works trouble head, Lock doors, and to bed. The day willeth done, whatsoever ye bid, The night is a thief, if ye take not good heed. Wash dishes, lay leavens, save fire, and away, Lock doors and to bed, a good huswife will say. To bed know thy guise, To rise do likewise. In winter at nine, and in summer at ten, To bed after supper, both maidens and men. In winter, at five a clock, servant arise, In summer at four, is very good guise. Love so as ye may Love many a day. Be lowly, not sullen, if aught go amiss, What wresting may lose thee, that win with a kiss. Both bear and forbear, now artd then as ye may. Then wench, God a mercy ! thy husband will say. MENDLESHAM GAMES, 1735. His nam Plebecula gaudet. Hor. Mendlesham was formerly a market-town qf some importance, and is situated in a deep miry soil, near the source qfthe river Deben. The place itself is mean, but the church is a handsome structure, with a lofty embattled tower. The two porches are fine, and rich- ly ornamented, particularly that on the north side ; on the top qf which are four well-sculptured grotesque figures. It was given by King William Rufus to the cc 2"], [416, "392 Abbot and Convent of Battle, in Sussex, who had the impropriation and advowson qf the vicarage till the dissolution. Hugh Fitz Otho procured the privelege of a market and fair from King Edward the 1st, the latter qf which it still retains annually on the 21st qf September. The lordship qf this town was formerly vested in the family of Duke, but now belongs io that of Tyrett. Towards the conclusion of the 17th century, an ancient silver crown, weighing about 60 ounces, and conjectured to have belonged to one qfthe East Anglian Kings, was found here. A gold concave ring, with an inscription in the Sclavonian, or Runic character, was also ploughed up here in 1758, qf which a de scription, with a plate, is given in the Gent. Mag. Vol. 51. Pt. 2. p. 975. Camden supposes Meudles ham to have been the residence qf Dagobert, one qfthe Kings qfthe Heptarchy. On a brass plate in the church is \" An Account qf \" Houses and Lands, given in Charity lo the Parish \" Church qf Mendlesham, in the County qf Suffolk, \" taken July 25. 1 807,\" and which then let, collec tively, for \u00a3266 per annum. \" The rent and profits \" qfthe said Houses and Lands are annually received \" by the Churchwardens qf the said Parish for the \" time being, and by them laid out and expended in \" repairing the said Church, the Yard, House, and \" Buildings on the said Church Estates, in paying the \" Schoolmaster's Salary, and assisting the poor and \" needy persons belonging to the said Parish.\" Once on a time, in town renown'd of yore For weekly market, market now no more, Where Sallows sets his razor to a hair, And Killet's cyder bounces brisk and clear ; Cyder, the muses fav'rite drink, inspires To sing a subject all mankind admires ; The Holland Smock a tapster here displays, To tempt the light-heel'd damsels to the race,"], [417, "393 In hopes to make his barrels faster ru% And draw the country to his ale o brown : Hence, tho' the sunny season call'd to work, Bridget her rake throws by, and John his fork, The neighboring villages pour'd forth their youth, And age itself was there with his colt's tooth. For who cou'd stay away, when Gunners seen, A rural goddess on the crowded green ? Havors and Bait, and many more, remain, Maids that might follow in Diana's train. And now the sun had shorten'd his career, When on the lists two nymphs in draw 'rs appear ; Cook, who full oft had triumph'd in the field, Whose sturdy make to man wou'd hardly yield ; Her well known fame dismay'd the softer sex, So only one oppos'd, instead of six. Nor will our landlord give his smock away So cheap, 'tis kept to grace some future day : But to requite the country for their loves, He graciously bestows a pair of gloves, Which Cook must wear, with ease she gains the goal, Whilst Blomficld follows like a filly foal ; Blomfield, too young, but yet, if right I see, What Cook is now, in time shall Blomfield be. So have we seen a greyhound and her young Stretch o'er the lawn, and drive poor puss along ; The first year's running this of that fell short, But turn for turn next season show'd us sport. Thus time will put our organs out of tune, As all things change which lie beneath the moon.

Good bowlers all, and honest men, I hope, And he that is not, let him win a rope. Burroughs and Rednal fill the judge's seat, And cock their pipes with gravity and state ; Three times the bowl is sent from every hand, But Chiltock's fortune did most pins command : Chiiluck exults, victorious, in the throng. Now some trudge homeward, some their mirth pro- long With double mugs, and grateful whiffs of smoke, And the house roars with many a rustic joke. Nor was Crowdero wanting with his kit, To take advantage of the merry fit, To screw the maidens heartstrings up to love, And show their swains how gracefully they move; The swains before had play'd the wrestler's part, To prove their manhood to each kind sweetheart By a hard fall, which, if the truth were known, Is scarce so taking as a soft green gown. But stay, my maids, till Michaelmas be come, Now mind your spinning, and encrease the sum To recommend you to a thrifty spouse, To buy the wedding ring, and fetch the cows.

Songs of trades, or songs of the people, are of very remote antiquity. The Grecians, says D' Israeli in his entertaining work, the '\u2022' Curiosities of Lite - \" rature,\" had songs appropriated to the various trades. There was a song for the corn-grinders ; another for the workers in wool ; another for the weavers. The reapers had their carol ; the herds- men had a song, which an ox-driver of Sicily had composed; the kneaders, and the bakers, and the galley-rowers, were not without their chaunt We have ourselves a song of the weavers, which Ritson has preserved in his \" Ancient Songs ;\" an i it may be found in the popular chap-book of \"the Life of \" Jack of Newberry ; \" and the songs of anglers, of old Isaac Walton, and Charles Cotton, still retain their freshness. Dr. Johnson is the only writer I recollect who has noticed something of this nature which he observed in the Highlands. The strokes of the sickle were timed by the modulation of the harvest song, in which all their voices were united. They accompany every action which can be done in equal time with an appropriate strain, ichich has, they say, not much meaning, but its effects arc regularity and cheerfulness There is an oar song used by the Hebrideans, and our sailors at Newcastle, in heaving their anchors, fye. use a song of this kind. These songs abounded in the good old times of Elizabeth and James, for Hall in his Satires notices them as \" Sung to tlie wheel, and sung unto the payle ;\""], [420, "396 and Shakespeare describes them as \" old and plain,\" chaunted by \" The spinsters and tlie knitters in the sun, \" And the free maids that weave their threads with bones.\" Whatever these songs ivere, it is evident they formed a source of recreation to the solitary task- worker. But as the more masculine trades had their own songs, whose titles only appear to have reached us, such as \" the Carmen's whistle,\" \" Wat- \" kill's Ale,\" \" Chopping Knives,\" fye. they were probably appropriated to the respective trades they indicate. 'J'o this day mummers, in honor of Bishop Blaize, the saint qf wool-combers, go about chaunt- ing on the eve of their holy-days. A custom long existed in this country to elect a Boy-Bishop in almost every parish ; the Montem at Eton still pre- vails ; and there is a closer connection between the custom, which produced the \" Songs of the Crow \" and the Swallow,\" and our northern mummeries, than may be at first suspected. Our ancient bcggarSj likewise, had their songs, some of which are us old as the Elizabethan period, and many are fancifully characteristic of their habits and their feelings. The following little ditties are common in differ- ent parts of this county. They are sung by the rustics at their horkey s, merry-makings, frolics, and other jovial meetings ; but are note rapidly giving way to the attractions of more fashionable songs, and polished melodies. At the harvest suppers both songs and healths are sung; but the former have generally no relation to the subject of harvest, and the latter are short songs sung with the jug in hand. Some of these ditties have been \"orally \" collect- ed ; while others have been obligingly communicated by the kindness of a valuable correspondent."], [421, "397 SONGS. he.
