In the following Drama, the language and in cidents of the beautiful and affecting Tale from which it is taken, have been carefully preserved. The unity of action in the original story, the regular developement of the plot, and the highly-wrought interest of the conclusion, al ways appeared to me calculated to produce a powerful effect on the stage, and rendered the task of adaptation for that purpose comparative ly a very easy one. The event has even exceed ed my expectations. Where such ample mate rials were already provided, little was necessary beyond their arrangement into the form, and within the compass, of an acting Drama. The only addenda, therefore, consist of two short scenes, an occasional speech, when necessary to connect the dialogue, and a material alteration in the management of the catastrophe, which,"], [12, "VI PREFACE. though terrifically grand and impressive in the original, it was totally impossible to represent in a theatre. The Piece has been received with the unani mous applause of repeated audiences ; and its success must fairly be ascribed to the un rivalled performance of Mrs H. Siddons, in the character of Lucy Ashton, and the pecu liar excellence of Mr Mackay in that of Caleb Balderstone. Mrs H. Siddons's performance stands alone ; and any praise 1 could bestow on it would be but a feeble addition to the general admiration with which her efforts have been witnessed. The character of Lucy Ash ton is one of singular difficulty ; and requires, from its representative, a display of mental powers, of a much higher order than those which frequently triumph over many of the more brilliant and imposing heroines of the tragic drama. It is a part, almost exclusively, of silent and intense expression, \u2014 deriving lit tle assistance, either from the energy of the language or the commanding nature of the situations. On reading the play alone, it would be very difficult to form any just con ception of the effect produced by Mrs H. Siddons, throughout the two last acts of this character."], [13, "PREFACE. VII Mr Mackay's Caleb Balderstone is an addi tional proof, that, in this range of the Drama, he has no competitor. His natural and unla boured delineation of the old, faithful retainer, is a specimen of Scottish character totally dis tinct from his Bailie Nicol Jarvie, and quite on a parallel with it in every particular. Mr Jones and Mr Murray are entitled to my warmest thanks for their zealous exertions in Bucklaw and Craigengelt, parts by no means calculated to display their peculiar excellencies. Both contributed greatly to the amusement of the audience, in the scenes in which they were concerned. These characters are very strik ing by description in the Novel ; but it would be almost impossible to render them equally prominent by representation in the Drama. The dignity of Mrs Renaud's deportment, and the impressiveness of her manner, in Alice Gray, imparted to the character more conse quence than it could derive from almost any other representative.

Unhappy Ravenswood! Even to the grave the malice of thy enemies pursues thee ! Here, in the sanctuary, the satellites of law impede the solemn service of religion. Right well, my friends, have we maintained the honour of our house, and preserved the body of our chief from such unmanly insult. 2c? Gent. Let this Sir William Ashton, this new Lord Keeper, look to himself; for, if I read aright young Edgar's bold demeanour, he will remember and revenge the wrongs his father suffered. 3d Gent. I doubt it not ; and when he calls upon his kinsmen, I wear a sword to second his. 1st Gent. Peace ! peace ! such words are best un uttered. The usurper, by the awarded sentence of"], [18, "2 THE BRIDE OF LAMMERMOOR. the law, holds the inheritance of our noble relative. Edgar is young, impetuous, urged on to revenge by ancient enmity and recent insult ; he brooks but ill the galling weight of poverty. Urge him not to desperate enterprises. 2d Gent. Peace ! he is here ! Edgar Ravenswood enters from the Chapel, and descends to the front. Rav. Kinsmen and friends, you have performed no common duty to the body of our deceased re lative. The rites of due observance, which in other countries are allowed to the meanest Christian, would this day have been denied to Allan, Earl of Ravenswood, had they not been assured to him by your devoted courage. 1st Gent. We but performed our duty. The in sult offered to our lord, extends to all who claim the honour of his blood. Rav. Others bury their dead in sorrow and in silence \u2014 in reverence and in lamentation ; our funeral rites are marred by the intrusion of bailiffs and ruffians ; and our tears, the tears of clansmen for their chief \u2014 the tears of a son for his only pa rent, his solitary friend, are chased from our cheeks by the glow of just indignation. \u2014 But it is well I know from what quiver this arrow has come forth. It was only he who dug the grave, could have the mean cruelty to disturb the obsequies : and Heaven do as much and more to me, if I requite not to this man, and his house, the ruin and disgrace he has brought on me and mine. 1st Gent. Spoke as becomes the heir of Ravens wood ! \u2014 Our swords are yours, whenever you re quire them. Rav. Once more, my friends, receive my thanks. But now, enough of words.

Sir W. Who and what is this old woman you are so anxious to bring me acquainted with ? I think, Lucy, you know all the old gossips in the country. Lucy. To be sure I do, Sir, or how could I help the poor old creatures in hard times ? But Alice is the empress of old women, and the queen of gossips. She seldom associates with any of the peasants, for they are all afraid of her. Some con- sider her a witch, others a lunatic \u2014 but though her manner is wild, and her conversation superstitious, she is kind and gentle, and has a dignity in her deportment which would become a countess.

All this, my dear, is no answer to my question, who this woman is, and her connexion with the Ravenswoods. Lucy. I believe she was nurse to the last Lord, and is distantly related to the family.

I am sure she is grateful for your protection, and would rather speak to you than any person in the world. Do, my dear father, let me conduct you to her. Sir W.

You lose no interest with me for regretting your former masters ; I respect your gratitude, and hope we shall live to be good friends when we know each other better. Alice. Those of my age, my Lord, make no new friendships ; I thank you for your kind intentions, and wish I could repay you better than by what I am going to say. \u2014 You now stand on the brink of a precipice ! Sir W. Indeed !\u2014 Alice. You have driven matters hard with the House of Ravenswood \u2014 You are still planning fur ther persecution.

Ah ! he perished by the hand of an assas sin ! \u2014 Alice. Therefore, I may well say, beware of press ing a desperate man with the hand of authority.

My dear Sir, shall we return to the castle ? Sir W. aside. The manner and language of this woman surprise, nay, alarm me ! Can there be grounds for suspicion of violence ? No, no; the fate of Chiesley is a warning sufficient to deter. Come, my love, let us continue our walk, and smile at the superstitious cautions of your ancient friend. [Exeunt.

I would have stated my wrongs, so that they should have shaken his soul within him. Buck. Yes ; your very look and manner would have frightened the old man to death. Rav. Consider the provocation \u2014 consider the ruin and death caused by his hard-hearted cruelty. An ancient house destroyed \u2014 an affectionate father mur dered. Why, in our old Scottish days, he that sat quiet under such wrongs, would have been held un fit to back a friend or face a foe. Buck.

Not too honest, nor toe much of the soldier either ; but such as thou art, 'tis my luck to need thee, for I must have spurs put to Lady Ashton's motions. Craig. I'll dash them up to the rowel-keads. She shall come here at a full gallop, like a cow chased by a whole nest of hornets. Buck.

Amen, Alice, and send you your senses and your good humour. If you hold this mysterious language, instead of welcoming your friends, they will think of you as other people do. Rav. And how do other people think ? Henry, (whispering Rave?iswood.) They think she's a witch, and should have been burnt at Haddington. Alice, (iiiflamed by violent passion.) What is that you say ? that I am a witch, and should have suffer ed with the helpless old wrretches who were murder ed at Haddington ? Henry.

My thoughts are my own ; and if my mor tal sight is closed to objects present with me, it may be I can look with more steadiness into future events. Are you prepared to sit lowest at the board which was once your father's own, as a connexion and ally of his proud successor ? Are you ready to live on his bounty ? to follow him in the bye-paths of interest and chicane, which none can better point out to you ? To gnaw the bones of his prey, when he has devoured the substance ? Can you say as Sir William Ashton says ? think as he thinks ? vote as he votes? and call your father's murderer your revered patron ? Ravenswood !

Woman ! on the verge of the grave, dare you urge the son of your master to blood and to revenge ? Alice. Heaven forbid ! And, therefore, would I have you shun these fatal bounds. Ravenswood, a dark prophecy hangs over your house, and my fore boding spirit trembles, lest in you it should be ac complished.

Having told you this, if you are indeed your father's son, you will make it a pretence for flying from her presence. Depart, Master of Ravenswood, you have my secret. If you remain an hour under Sir William Ashton's roof, without the resolution to marry his daughter, you are a villain ;\u2014 if, with the purpose of allying yourself with him, you are an in fatuated and predestined fool. [Exit into the cottage. Rav. (solus.) She loves me then, and I am trifling with her affection. Dare I examine my own heart ? Alas ! I fear her image is too strongly impressed on it : To sue for the hand of an Ashton, and to be re fused \u2014 this were a consummation too disgraceful. I wish her well, and, for her sake, forgive the inju ries her father has done to my house ; but I will now see her for the last time, and take my leave of her for ever. [Exit Rav.

I have always been fond of wandering here ; and the more so, because it is, as I have heard, a spot connected with the legendary lore I love so well. Rav. It has been thought a place fatal to our fa mily, and I have some reason to term it so. It was here I first saw Miss Ashton, and here I must take my leave of her for ever. Lucy. Take leave of us ! What can have hap pened to hurry you away ? I know Alice hates \u2014 I mean, dislikes my father \u2014 yet he is powerful ; wait till you see what his gratitude will do for you. Rav. It is not to your father, Miss Ashton, but to my own exertions that I ought to owe success in the career on which I am about to enter. \u2014 (Lucy turns away to conceal her emotion \u2014 Ravenswood takes her by the hand) \u2014 Forgive my rudeness \u2014 I am too rough \u2014 too intractable, to deal with any being so soft and gentle as you are. Forget that so stern a vision has crossed your path of life, and let me pursue mine, sure that I can meet no worse misfor tune after the moment that divides me from your side. Lucy.

What coidd she object to the alliance ? Lucy. I did not say object ; but she is jealous of her rights, and may claim a mother's title to be con sulted. Rav. Be it so. We will wait her arrival. Lucy.

Nay, my dear Eleanor, listen to reason for a moment. Why is it, that, on your return from so long an absence, you assail me with reproaches, counteract all my plans, and rudely dismiss from my house a guest whom I had invited ? Lady A. Rather ask your own conscience, my Lord, why you have become a renegade to your own party and opinions ?\u2014 why you have abandoned the ruling principle of your life, and descended so low, as absolutely to plan a marriage between your daughter and a beggarly bankrupt, who has ever been the inveterate enemy of you and yours ? Sir W. But by your insulting treatment of Ra venswood, you have revived the enmity of one who has too much the power of harming us. Lady A. Were we not ever foes ? and when did you know a Douglas accessible to fear ? But he is gone, and, in all probability, will trouble us no more. Sir W. The Marquis of Athol has warmly espous ed the cause of his kinsman, Ravenswood. His power and influence may obtain a fresh decree to wrest our large possessions from us, and restore this ruined family to rank and riches. Surely a con nexion which would end for ever the unhappy feuds Lady A. Never- \u25a0 -though the loss of rank and power were certain \u2014 never shall those feuds be end ed by such a marriage.

He has the first estate and influence in"], [57, "THE BRIDE OF LAMMERMOOR. 41 the country ; and, against this match, what reason able objection can you urge ? Sir W. None, but her own repugnance. If Lucy freely consent to receive the addresses of Bucklaw, my wishes will accord with yours. But if her heart remain with Ravenswood, her hand shall not be forced upon another. Lady A. She already repents of the engagement into which she has been trepanned. I have a mo ther's authority to annul it, and fear not to obtain her ready compliance. Enter a Servant. Serv. Mr Hayston of Bucklaw is arrived, my Lady. Lady A. I rejoice to hear it, and will wait on him immediately. [Exit servant.~\\ And now, Sir Wil liam, let us prepare Lucy for the interview.

May I be double distanced, if ever I saw a man in my life have less the air of a bridegroom ! Cut me out of feather, if you don't look as if you were condemned to be hanged. Buck. Why, Craigie, I never spoke ten words to a woman of rank in my life. The chance is, I shall make but a bungling business of this. Craig. Why, you were bold enough the day you met her at the hunt.

If she would talk about hunting, I should get on ; but the chance is, I shall scarcely stammer through half a sentence in the regular way. Craig. Never fear ! Muster up your courage. Speak boldly, and the prize is won. Enter Lady Ashton and Lucy. (Lucy is extremely pale, and appears to pay little attention to the pass- ing scene, as if almost unconscious of the conversa- tion.) Lady A. My dear Bucklaw, you are thrice wel come to Ravenswrood Castle. Captain Craigengelt, your servant. [Bucklaw and Craigengelt bow* Lady A. Lucy is acquainted with the purpose of your visit, and ready to hear you on a subject equal ly interesting to us all ; but, as she is very young, (and has lately been trepanned into an engagement of which she is now heartily ashamed,) you will, I know, excuse her wish that I should be present at the interview. Buck. That's the very thing, Madam : I should have desired it on my own account ; for I have been so little accustomed to gallantry, I fear I shall make some cursed mistake.

You needn't blush, my love, and still less need you look so alarmed. Buck. I believe I am a fool, Miss Ashton. I have tried to speak to you, as people tell me young ladies like to be talked to, and I don't think you comprehend what I have been saying ; and no won der, for curse me if I understand it myself. But, however, once for all, if you can take a plain young fellow for your husband, I will place you at the head of the first establishment in the three Lothians : you shall have the best lodging in the Canongate of Edinburgh, go where you please, do what you please, see what you please,\u2014 and that's fair. , Since I have mustered up courage to make a plain pro- posal, I would fain hear Miss Ashton, from her own lips, give me a plain answer. Lady A. My dear Bucklaw, let me spare Lucy's bashfulness. She has consented to be guided by her father and me in this matter. Lucy, my love, speak for yourself: Is it not as I say ? Lucy. I have promised to obey you, Madam, but upon one condition. Lady A. She means that she has written to Ra venswood, and expects an answer -,\u2014 the restitution of the en^a^ement into which he had the art to in volve her. Buck. Perfectly right ! \u2014 quite fair ! \u2014 \" It is best to be off with the old love \" Before you be on with the new.\" But I thought you might have had an answer six times told before now.

My son, Colonel Ashton, is equally anxious ; and do you think we could per mit either, when both are so dear to us, to go to a desperate man on a desperate errand ? In fact, we are all of opinion, that, as no answer has been re turned, silence must in this, as in other cases, be supposed to give consent, and a contract abandoned, when the party waves insisting upon it. Lucy. Madam, I entreat you to urge me no fur ther. I feel conscious heaven and earth have set themselves against my union with Ravenswood ; but, till this unhappy engagement be restored, I should commit a heavy sin in doing what you require. Let me be once assured that he wishes to set me free, and dispose of me as you please. I care not how \u2014 when the jewels are gone, what signifies the casket. Lady A. But, my love, if he remains obstinately silent ? Lucy. He will not be silent. Unknown to you, I have sent him a double of my former letter by a certain hand. Lady A. You have not \u2014 you could not \u2014 you durst not \u2014 (suddenly checking her anger.) \u2014 My dear est Lucy, how could you think of such a thing ? Buck. No matter! \u2014 I respect Miss Ashton for her sentiments, and I only wish I had been her messen ger myself. Lady A. (Ironically.) And pray how long are we to wait for the return of your Pacolet \u2014 your fairy messenger ? Lucy. I have numbered weeks, days, hours, and minutes ; \u2014 within a week I shall have an answer, un less he be dead. Till that time, Sir, let me be thus far beholden to you, that you will beg my mother to forbear me on this subject. Buck. I will make it my particular entreaty to Lady Ashton, Madam. Miss Lucy must not be hur ried, my Lady, \u2014 messengers may be delayed. I have known a day's journey broke by the casting of a fore-"], [61, "45 THE BRIDE OF LAMMERMOOR. shoe. To be sure, by the time she mentions, I ought to be at Caverton Edge, to see the match be tween the Laird of Kittlegirth's black mare and Johnson the meal-monger's four-year-old colt, but Craigie can bring me word how the match goes ; so that's all settled. In the meantime, I shall not dis tress Miss Ashton myself; and I hope you and Sir William will leave her equally at liberty to make up her mind. Lucy. Sir, you are generous. Buck. As for that, Madam, I only pretend to be a plain, good-humoured young fellow, as I said before, who would willingly make you happy, if you will permit him, and show him how to do so. Lady A. My daughter, Bucklaw, does full justice to the sincerity of your attachment. And now, we had better confer with Sir William on the subject ; he expects us in the library. Buck. I attend him, Madam. Miss Lucy, I take my leave. By my honour, I respect your sentiments, and, though the prosecution of this affair be rendered dearer to me than before, yet, as I am a gentleman, I would renounce it for ever, were it so urged as to give you a moment's pain.

She's going to prove little better than a rifler ; just wets her singles in the blood of the partridge, then breaks away, and lets her fly ; and what good can the poor bird do after that, you know, except to pine and die in the first heather-cow or whin-bush she can crawl into. Lucy. (Holding him mournfully by the hand.) Right, Henry ! Right ! Very right ! But there are more riflers in the world than your falcon, and more wounded birds, than seek but to die in quiet, who can find neither brake nor whin-bush to hide their heads in. Henry. Ay, that's some speech out of your ro mances. My mother says they have turned your head. But I hear Norman whistling to the hawk, so I must go and fasten on the jesses. [Exit Henry. Lucy. (After a pause.) It is decreed that every living creature, even those who owe me most kind ness, are to shun me, and leave me to encounter the difficulties by which I am beset.

Lucy Ashton alone. At length the dreaded hour is arrived, and this day must decide my fate. Still, still, no answer to my letters. Where is the hope, the last and lingering hope to which I clung for safety like a drowning wretch ? 'Tis vanished ! \u2014 and despair alone remains. Ravenswood ! Ravenswood ! have I deserved that you should thus desert me, thus leave me unsupport ed to sustain this deadly persecution, opposed to"], [69, "r~ THE BRIDE OF LAMMERMOOR. 53 which my reason wavers, and my poor heart is breaking. Where can I turn for pity or for rescue ? Father ! mother ! \u2014 those names should mean pro tection, tenderness and love, yet speak of cruelty and unrelenting rigour ! \u2014 One friend alone remains. \u2014 In the dark grave, all human sufferings are closed, and gladly will I welcome death, rather than break the faith I pledged to Ravenswood. Enter Henry Ashton. Henry. They have sent me to know if you are ready, Lucy. The writings are prepared, all the family assembled in the great hall, and my mother says, the ceremony must be over before twelve o'clock, or the marriage won't be happy. Lucy. Marriage and happiness ! alas ! For me alone those terms are disunited. Henry. Do you know, Lucy, I am glad you are to have Bucklaw, after all, instead of Ravenswood, who looked like a Spanish grandee, come to cut all our throats*, and trample our bodies under foot. Tell me truly, an't you glad to be fairly rid of him ? Lucy. Ask me no questions, Henry \u2014 there is little more can happen to make me either glad or sorry in this world. Enter Lady Ashton. Lady A. Lucy, my love, why do you keep us waiting ? The family is assembled, and the business must proceed immediately. Come, I'll conduct you to the hall. Leave us, Henry. [Exit Henry. Lucy, after endeavouring to speak, bursts into tears, and throws herself at her mother's feet. Lucy.

By the memory of that tender love with which you reared my infancy and childhood,\u2014 by the deep sense of filial duty and obedience, which, till this fatal moment, my life has proved, \u2014 I entreat, I implore you, save me from misery and destruction\u2014 and save yourself, my mo ther, from that remorse, which your own heart must one day feel, for having brought this woe upon your wretched child ! Lady A. Shame on such weakness, Lucy ! Where is your pride ? your duty to your parents and your family ? All, all absorbed in one disgraceful passion ! Lucy. My vow ! my vow ! Lacly A. His silence has absolved you from it, and proves he wishes to forget his own. Have we not heard, too, that he is on the point of marriage with another ? If these arguments have no weight, think that your parents' word is pledged\u2014 their ho nour implicated\u2014 think that, when freely left to fix the time, you named this day.

Sir William Ashton, Colonel Ashton, Henry, Bucklaw, Randolph a Clergyman, and all the Domestics discovered. \u2014 At one side, a table, with writings. \u2014 Lady Ashton leads on Lucy. \u2014 All the Gentlemen bow. Sir W. Now, then, to the business of the day. The parties are all assembled. Are the writings prepared ? Rand. Every thing is ready, my Lord. Sir W. Then, let us proceed at once. Nothing now is wanting but the formal signature of all con cerned. The marriage ceremony must then be com pleted. [Goes to the table to sign. Rand, (approaching Lucy.) Yet, ere the solemn contract be performed, permit me to express my fervent hope, that the union between these honour able persons may prove a source of long and lasting happiness. Be not cast down, Miss Lucy, but meet a scene of joy with cheerful looks ; \u2014 doubt not, obedience to your parents' wishes will heal your wounded mind, and crown your future days with many blessings.

Lucy drops the pen, rises from her chair, and ex claims It is he ! It is he ! \u2014 He is come ! He is come ! [She falls into her mother's arms. Ravenswood bursts open the folding doors, and comes forward in the centre, his dress much dis- ordered, and partly enveloped in a large riding cloke. His hat slouched. His face haggard and pale. \u2014 All start with astonishment at his entrance. \u2014 Lucy raises herself, and stands gazirig on him as if petrified. [A pause. Lady A. (recovering herself.) I demand to know the cause of this rude and unauthorised intrusion ? Col. A. That is a question which I have the best right to ask, and I request the Master of Ravens wood to follow me, where he can answer at his leisure. Buck. No man shall usurp my previous right in demanding an explanation from the Master. Col. A. I will relinquish to no one my right of calling to account the man who has offered this un- paralleled affront to my family. Rav. Be patient, gentlemen ! If you are as weary of your lives as I am, I will find time and place to pledge mine against one, or both ; but, at present, I have no leisure for the disputes of triflers. Col. A. and Buck, (drawing) Triflers ! Sir W. (Comes between them.) My son I com mand you \u2014 Bucklaw I intreat you \u2014 Keep the peace, in the name of the Queen, and of the law. Rand.

He shall account to me, or by Heaven I will stab him where he stands. Buck. You shall not touch him here : He once gave me my life, and were he the devil come to fly away with the whole house and generation, he shall have nothing but fair play. Rav. Let him who really seeks danger take the fitting time when it is to be found. My mission here will be shortly accomplished. (Turns to Lu cy.) Is that, Madam, your hand ? (Produces her letter.) Lucy. (In afaultering voice.) Yes. Rav. And is this also your hand? (Producing the written contract.) Sir W. If you design to found any legal claim on that engagement, Sir, do not expect to receive an answer here. Rav. Sir William Ashton, I pray you, and all who hear me, that you will not mistake my purpose. If this young lady, of her own free will, desires the re storation of this contract, as her letter would seem to imply, there is not a withered leaf, which this au tumn wind strews upon the heath, that is more va lueless in my eyes. But I must and will hear the truth from her own mouth : Without this satisfac tion, I will not leave the spot. Murder me by num bers, you possibly may ; but I am an armed man, \u2014 I am a desperate man ; and I will not die without ample vengeance. This is my resolution, \u2014 take it as you may. \u2014 I will hear her determination from her own mouth, alone, and without witnesses. (Takes out two pistols.) Now, choose whether you will have this hall floated with blood, or grant me the decisive interview with my affianced bride ; which the laws of God and the country alike entitle me to demand. Rand. In the name of Heaven, receive an over ture from the meanest of its servants. What this gentleman demands, though urged with over vio-"], [74, "58 THE BRIDE OF LAMMERMOOR. lence, hath in it something of reason. Let him hear from Miss Lucy's own lips, that she hath acceded to the will of her parents, and repents of her covenant with him. Let him have the interview on which he in'sisteth. It can but be a passing pang to the mai den, and then he will depart in peace unto his own dwelling, and cumber us no more. Lady A. Never ! \u2014 Never shall this man speak in private with my daughter \u2014 the affianced bride of another. Pass from the room who will, I remain here. I fear neither his violence nor his weapons, though some who bear my name appear more moved by them. Rand. Nay, Madam, let me entreat you, add not fuel to firebrands. The Master of Ravenswood, cannot, I am sure, object to your presence, the young lady's state of health being considered, and your maternal duty. I myself will also tarry. Per haps my grey hairs may turn away wrath. Rav. You are welcome to remain, Sir, and Lady Ashton, also, if she thinks proper ; but let all others depart. Col. A. (As he is going out) Ravenswood, you shall account for this ere long. [Exit. Rav. Whenever you please, Sir. Buck. (As he is going out) But I have a prior de mand on your leisure, a claim of some standing. Rav. Arrange it as you will. \u2014 Leave me but this day in peace \u2014 and I shall have no dearer employ ment on earth to-morrow, than to give you all the satisfaction you may desire. [Exit Buck* Sir W. (As he is going out) Master of Ravens wood, I think I have not deserved that you should make this scandal and outrage in my family.

Rav. Do you know me, Miss Ashton ? I am still Edgar Ravenswood \u2014 I am still that Edgar Ravens wood, who, for your affection, renounced the dear ties by which injured honour bound him to seek vengeance\u2014 I am that Ravenswood, who for your sake forgave, nay, clasped hands in friendship, with the oppressor and pillager of his house \u2014 the tradu cer, and murderer, of his father ! Lady A. My daughter, Sir, has no occasion to dispute the identity of your person. The venom of your present language is sufficient to remind her that she speaks with the mortal enemy of her family. Rav. I pray you to be patient, Madam ; my an swer must come from her own lips. Once more, Miss Ashton, I am that Ravenswood to whom you granted the solemn engagement which you here desire to retract and cancel. Lucy. It was my mother, I Lady A. She speaks truly \u2014 It was I who advis ed, persuaded, and commanded her to set aside an unhappy and precipitate engagement! Rav. (to Lucy.) And is this all ? are you willing to barter sworn faith, the exercise of free will and mutual affection, to such unnatural and hard-heart ed tyranny ?

Lady A. Master of Ravenswood, you have asked what questions you thought fit\u2014 you see the total incapacity of my daughter to answer you. But I will reply for her, and in a manner which you can- not dispute. You desire to know, whether Lucy Ashton, of her own free will, wishes to annul the engagement into which she has been trepanned?\u2014 You have her letter, under her own hand, demand- ing the surrender of it ; and, as yet more full evi- dence of her purpose, here is the contract, wdiich she has this morning subscribed, in presence of this reverend gentleman, with Mr Hayston of Bucklaw. (Retires up.) Rav. (Having gazed upon the deeds in mute aston- ishment.) And it was without fraud or compulsion that she subscribed this parchment ? Rand. I vouch it upon my sacred character. Rav. This is indeed an undeniable piece of evi- dence, and it would be equally useless and dishon- ourable to waste another word in remonstrance or reproach. (Lady Ashton comes forward), There Ma- dam \u2014 (giving to Lucy the paper and piece qf gold) these are the testimonies of your first engagement \u2014 you may be more faithful to that which you have just formed. I will now trouble you to return the corresponding tokens of my ill-placed confidence \u2014 I ought rather to say of my egregious folly ! Lucy gazes on him unconsciously \u2014 raises her hands, and endeavours to disengage the ribbon, by which the piece of gold is suspended round her neck. Lady Ashton assists her ; she gives the gold and a paper lo Ravenswood. Lucy. It was the last link which bound me to life, and it is broken ! Rav. (Much affected.) And she could wear it"], [77, "THE BRIDE OF LAMMERMOOR. 61 thus \u2014 could wear it in her very bosom \u2014 could wear it next her heart \u2014 even when but complaint avails not \u2014 (Tears the contract.) \u2014 I will no longer be an intruder here. Your evil wishes, and your worse offices, Lady Ashton, I will only return, by hoping these will be your last machinations against the honour and happiness of your daughter. \u2014 (Turns to Lucy) \u2014 And to you, Madam, I have nothing further to say, except a prayer to heaven that you may not become a world's wonder for this act of wilful and deliberate perjury.
