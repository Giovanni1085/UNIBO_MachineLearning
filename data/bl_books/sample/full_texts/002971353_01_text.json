THERE is not any dramatic entertain- ment more frequently performed on the theatre at Paris, than the Oracle of Monfieur St. Foix ; an author, for delicacy, and purity of flyle, allowed, by all good judges, to be one of the beft in the French language : and, to fay the truth, the conftant applaufe with which the Public have favoured this piece of his, ap pears to be little lefs than what is juftly due to its merit ; fince nothing can be prettier than the idea on which it is founded ; or more happily executed, than the character of the girl ; in whom love, as the fimple production of Nature, is drawn in the moft lively and charming colours. Under thefe circumftances, I was always much furprifed at the little fuccefs it met with upon the Englifh ftage. Mrs. Cibber's tranfla tion cf it was excellent ; and the performance of that incomparable actrefs, in the firft reprefenta tions, gave it additional luftre. But I imagine, the character of the Fairy, a legendary being, very different in England from what it is in France, threw upon it an air of childifhnefs. This"], [6, "4 PREFACE. This, I hope, may, in fome meafure, be reme died by the introduction of a Magician : and the prefent tafte of the town favouring the at-\u00bb tempt ; I thought, by the addition of mufic, to which the fubject feems peculiarly adapted; I might be able to render the whole a toy, very capable of affording an hour's amufement. The Oracle has already been twice put into an Englifh drefs ; firft by an anonymous author, and afterwards by Mrs. Cibber. The former is a literal tranflation ; and, for that reafon, very indifferent. The latter I fhould certainly have made ufe of upon this occafion ; but I found, in confequence of my plan, fuch curtailing and fo many alterations neceffary, that, in the end, I thought it would be jufter to give a more faulty paraphrafe of my own. With regard to the mufic, I apprehend it muft pleafe -, as it has been felected with the greateft attention, both to the beauty of the airs, and its effect upon the theatre. There are, in deed, fome people, who may poffibly be of opn nion, that I ought to have chofen old Englifh and Scotch ballads ; or got mufic compofed in the fame tafte. But, in fact, fuch fort of compofition.* fcarce deferve the name of mufic at all ; at leaft, they can have little or no merit on the ftage -, where every thing ought to be fupported by a degree of action and character."], [7, "PREFACE. 5 But, be the fuccefs of this Opera what it will, it would be very ungrateful in me not to ac knowledge my obligations to Mr. Garrick for the great pains he has taken in preparing it for reprefentation : if it fucceeds, to him, indeed, it muft be chiefly attributed ; who has a genius for every thing ; and thinks nothing, however trifling, below his attention, that may prove an entertainment to the Public.
