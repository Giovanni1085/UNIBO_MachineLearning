The chapters which follow have been arranged on the only plan by which it seemed logically possible to sketch the great amount of history with which they have to deal : it may be as well to point out the way in which they are meant to be of use. Each castle in the valley of the Loire has a history of its own, sometimes going as far back as Roman times, sometimes reaching forward to the present day ; but in each castle there is also some particular event, some especial visitor, whose import ance overshadows every memory connected with the place ; it therefore became possible to arrange these \" moments \" chronologically, and thus gradually to unwind a more or less connected thread of history from the rise of the Angevin Plantagenets where Chinon guards the bridge of the Vienne to the last"], [20, "PREFACE X days of the Valois in the Chateau of Blois. In some cases the story has been carried on by chapters on the more important personages, such as the earlier Dukes of Orleans or Marguerite de Valois, but any thing approaching to thorough treatment of so long a period in one book was impossible. This arrange ment of the mass of details which had to be in some way dealt with, seemed to recommend itself both from its utility to the traveller in the valley of the Loire, and from its clearness in the presentment of a certain side of French history to that large portion of the cultivated universe which, like M. le Maistre, is wont to do its travelling at home. \" Could any spot of earth Show to his eye an image of the pangs Which it hath witnessed, render back an echo Of the sad steps by which it hath been trod.\" Characters will perhaps gain in reality for the reader, scenes may be imagined with a greater vividness, when described in their actual setting. \"The stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.\" The materials used have been first and foremost the rich mine of original authorities published in the Documents Lnsdits, the collection of Mhnoires by Petitot, and the smaller transcripts by Zeller from"], [21, "PREFACE XI the Memoirs and Letters of the time, which are in a more portable form and of distinct value. Among more modern authorities I have referred to the Histories of Michelet and of Martin, and the Analyse Raisonnse of Chateaubriand; for Chapter II. to K. Norgate's Angevin Kings ; for episodes at Chinon and at Blois to Yriarte's C\u00e6sar Borgia and the Stan hope Essay for 1891 ; to Un GentilJwmme des temps pass/s and Francois L. by C. Coignet ; and to The End of the Middle Ages and Marguerite of Navarre by Madame James Darmesteter, to whose invaluable suggestions I have been very much indebted through out the whole work. On questions of architecture, Petit's Architectural Studies, the wonderfully com plete works of Viollet le Due, and the Renaissance of Art in France by Mrs. Mark Pattison, have been consulted. A list in the Appendix has collected a few other authorities upon various subjects. Much help has doubtless been obtained elsewhere, but it is not wittingly left unacknowledged. All of the guide books which are published for each chateau have been freely used, and in recognising my obliga tions to their various authors I would especially single out the accurate and conscientious produc tions of Mgr. Chevalier, whose publications from the archives of Chenonceaux are particularly vol. I b"], [22, "PREFACE XII valuable, and lastly, the researches of M. de la Saussaye in the history of the Chateau of Blois and its neighbourhood. I am assured that the materials at present collected have never been published in one book before either in France or England ; the need for them in a port- able form for travellers in Touraine is certainly a distinct one, and it is hoped that the illustrations will still further increase the interest of Englishmen in a province, once an English possession, whose history has so much in common with their own. I have especially to thank M. PeVicat of the Rue de la Scellerie, Tours, for allowing me to reproduce several plates from a book of which he has lately published a few copies, and which forms the finest collection yet extant of the best types of art in Touraine. The earlier chapters of Mr. Henry James's Little Tour in France, full of happy suggestion and a keen artistic sense, will show the traveller the right way to use his eyes; Mgr. Chevalier's Guide Pittoresque du Voyageur en Touraine will give him further details and still more extend his wanderings ; Mrs. Mark Pattison's Renaissance in France will point out for him all that is most valuable in Tours and in Touraine of architecture, painting, and sculpture. These three books will also give all the information required"], [23, "PREFACE XIII concerning the town of Tours itself, its possibilities of pleasure, its facilities for locomotion, its unequalled surroundings. In the Appendix I have inserted a few points which would have overcrowded the text, but which seemed necessary to give completeness to the work ; among them is a note on the Library of Tours furnished for me by the kindness of the librarian, M. Duboz. The first division of the Appendix collects some additional points of interest in the town of Tours itself and in Touraine ; the second is a list of the manuscripts and books in the various public libraries of the town ; the third deals with the numerous portraits and pictures (chiefly of the school of the Clouets) to be seen in Touraine and elsewhere in France and England, that bear upon the portion of history treated ; in the last is added a further list of books and manuscripts which may be used where more facts are needed than I have been able to reproduce. From lack of space much has been omitted that may afterwards appear, should the want for it seem pressing. I have, however, been able to add a Genealogical Table, which includes all the more im portant families in France who had any connection with Touraine, and a Map which is reduced from the"], [24, "PREFACE XIV sheets of the French Government Survey, and will show the relative position of the places mentioned, several of which are considerably beyond the bound aries of Touraine, accurately so called. From this map it will be seen that three centres of exploration should be made by the traveller in the valley. The first, Saumur, from which he can drive to Fontev rault and Chinon, then go by rail to Azay-le-Rideau, and by rail or road return to Tours ; the second, Tours, from which three excursions are possible \u2014 (i) by road along the Loire to Luynes, Cinq Mars, and Langeais, and thence home by train ; (2) by rail past Montbazon to Loches ; (3) by rail to Amboise, thence to Chenonceaux, and home by rail ; his third centre will be Blois ; from here he can drive to Chambord and return by the Chateau of Cheverny, and the next day follow the road along the Loire to Chaumont, and drive back through the Forest of Russy, past the Chateau of Beauregard, and so to Blois. Throughout the province the hotels are good, the wines sound, the roads excellent, and a great deal can be done on horseback or in a light carriage ; the trains are slow but conscientious, and by the various lines will take the traveller who is wise enough to be leisurely, to almost any place he may desire to visit."], [25, "PREFACE XV In conclusion, I take this opportunity of expressing my deep sense of the courtesy and assistance so freely rendered me on every side during my stay in Touraine, and more especially I would acknowledge the great help given me in many ways by M.

Beneath the lime trees on the terrace walk I sat, and watched the silver of the moon Slip softly from the river to the sands That fringe with pale gold bars the silent Loire. The busy chirping of the insect wings, That all day long had rustled in the sun, Was still ; the tiny lizards on the wall, That all day long had flitted to and fro The burning stones, had vanished ; sweetly fell A silvern silence on the shadowed fields Where scarce a blade of grass bent to the breeze, The gentle breeze of evenings in Touraine Which comes but to caress the weary brow And breathe contentment ; from the darker line, Where the soft grey of heaven kissed the earth, The moon rose higher to the cloudless blue And touched with light the tall Cathedral Towers, That like twin sisters rose above the trees Crowned with the evening star."], [36, "There came a sound More felt than heard, as of the rustling wings Of countless souls that moved in upper air Or glided with the moonbeams through the night ; Souls of the dead who visited the homes Where once they dwelt ; and some sought all in vain And some who found seemed sorrowful to find, Or, with a horror of remembered sin Pursuing them, shuddered and passed alone ; And some few, near the old Cathedral Towers, Rested awhile in peace, as though to kiss A treasured memory within the stones. Softly the echoes from the far-off bell Whispered along the river, and the souls All gathered, so methought, within the fane, And joined their silent prayers with those below Who sang thanksgivings ; all the vault of night Seemed full of harmonies that rose and fell Till they were caught up to the heaven above And borne amid the company of souls From lesser lights to higher, where the stars Bent down to listen. So the future seemed To mingle with the past.

It is crossed from east to west by the rapid and sandy stream of the Loire, which flows through it for a dis tance of some ninety kilo metres from a point not far above Amboise to the valley of Fontevrault. The three chief tributaries ofthe Loire, at this part of its course, join the river from its southern side ; and with very few VOL. I B"], [38, "OLD TOUR ALNE 2 exceptions it is with this left-hand bank of the stream that we shall chiefly have to do, our limits being Chambord to the east, in the department of the Loir et Cher, and to the west Saumur, in the old province of Anjou, the modern department of the Maine et Loire. In the forests to the north and east of Blois are the Chateaux of Chambord, of Cheverny, and Beaure gard ; while farther to the south and west is Chaumont looking down upon the Loire, which then flows be neath the ramparts of Amboise westward to the cathedral towers of Tours. Upon the right bank, farther down, are Luynes, Cinq Mars, and Langeais ; and the Cher, which near here flows from the south east into the Loire, has passed the galleries of Chenonceaux, some sixty kilometres from its mouth. The southern waters of the Indre are guarded by the rugged keep of Loches, and by Montbazon farther westward, and finally wind in and out among the trees that shade Azay-le- Rideau, before losing them selves in the swifter current of the main stream. At Candes the river is still further swollen by the Vienne, which after passing the ruined towers of Chinon has flowed by the Forest of Fontevrault to add its story to the many voices of the Loire. Perhaps no stream in so short a portion of its course has so much history to tell. Until the end of the sixteenth century this part of France was covered with a multitude of chateaux, for beside the"], [39, "INTRODUCTORY 3 old feudal towers, whose strength had saved them from destruction in the happier times of peace, the nobles of later days had raised more elegant abodes, in which they strove to preserve only what had been picturesque in the earlier fortified dwellings. By the wars of religion and the disturbances of the Fronde a great number of the chateaux had been ruined or defaced : by the line of policy which was begun by Louis XI. and carried on by Henry IV. to receive its full development at the hands of Richelieu and Louis XIV., the old feudal spirit had been finally crushed ; even architecture took an entirely different form. The Court, which for so many centuries had moved to and fro among the pleasant castles of Touraine, migrated towards Paris, and filled the wide walks and never-ending gardens of Versailles and Fontaine bleau : the last of the old feudal barons was Agrippa d'Aubigne, the friend and comrade in arms of Henry of Navarre, who kept his fortresses till he left France, and then sold them to the Rohans. By the Revolu tion the old chateaux were within an ace of being destroyed for ever ; the \" crown of Cybele \" in Touraine lost nearly half its beauty, for with chang ing times the life of other centuries perished, and \" like an unsubstantial pageant faded,\" though legends of it and memories of it still cling to the ruined walls like the ivy which a kindly soil has lent to hide their falling gateways. It is true that here"], [40, "OLD TOURAINE 4 and again a new life mingles with the old, but many of the ancient homes stand empty and deserted, or, saddest fate of all, await richer purchasers to save them from destruction. Chenonceaux is in the grip of a great Paris com pany ; in Amboise, where Abd-el-Kader chafed in prison, where Marie Stuart sighed over the slaughtered Huguenots, no courtly laughter comes again to grace the mutilated halls, for the Orleans princes abode there but a little while, and have left it dead again. Loches seems happier as the seat of a Sous-Profet, who dwells by the tomb of Agnes Sorel ; Plessis-lez- Tours is worst changed of all. The churches of the Middle Ages live on still and have a meaning for us even in their ruins, for the faith that built them is among us still ; but the feudal castles belong to a life and a time so different from our own that to understand them at all we must go back to the history of which they formed a part ; we must try, as well and shortly as may be, to people these walls that are still echoing with a larger and a fuller life than ours, to realise the men who built them and lived in them, to imagine for ourselves that dead and gone feudalism in the midst of which the youth of the French nation grew hard and strong. Nor is it difficult to discover a reason for the interest and fascination which the modern world finds, and will always find, in that old life : we are perpetually receiving pleasant shocks from its"], [41, "INTRODUCTORY 5 astounding originality, from the unexpected nature of its modes of thought and action. An age un fettered by the later restrictions of what is called society, by a morality from which it results that the actions of any given man in any given position can often be accurately foretold, a generation which was innocent of Kant, and ignorant of Herbert Spencer, could well preserve a spontaneity and freshness of impulse, an individuality of method and resource which is as strange as it is fascinating to men of a later and more conventional society ; for the passions of its barbarism mingle in curious ways with lighter fantasies of the imagination, with a deeper and more heartfelt poetic feeling. But in this very freedom of the feudal age lay the germs of its decay. The system that liberated the warriors of the time from all the higher bonds imposed by the idea of Nation ality had placed in society a principle of anarchy that was incompatible with the existence of a great country, that favoured private civil wars, that made a national resistance impossible, and was the source of the terrible disasters of the Hundred Years' War. William the Conqueror, at the conquest of England, had discovered long before the rest of France the defects of the old system, and had broken the mould of Feudalism ; 1 it was one of the many signs of his greatness that he had done so. There is yet another fact which, while it adds 1 C. Coignet, Francois I."], [42, "OLD TOURALNE 6 one more reason for our interest in these early days, is itself the mainspring of much of their hot-blooded impulse and versatile emotion : in no other country have women exercised so great an influence upon politics and the whole life of the people as in France. It has been truly said that they have avenged the passing of the Salic law ; but they have done more : throughout French history, even down to modern times, the motto which guides the historian's re searches is \" Cherchez la Femme.\" From the heroine of Charles VII. down to the grand-daughter of that Agrippa d'Aubigne already mentioned, their ambition and their influence for good or evil have been exhibited by women who understood better than those of any other nation how to wield the weapons peculiar to their sex. It is the same in later as in earlier times. \" The vice of the six teenth century,\" says Michelet, \" is the unrestrained outburst of its passion, its blind desire for physical enjoyment, which outraged what it loved.\" The reaction was a matter of course.

The little kingdom of Anjou, given to its first counts by Odo of Paris in reward for their services against the dreaded pirates, was wedged in between the Loire, the Sarthe, and the Mayenne, and in the hands of less energetic owners would have been inevitably swallowed up in the possessions of the powerful Counts of Blois, had not these latter shown as much of irresolution and weakness as their life long opponents possessed of keen and unwearying activity. Alone of all his race the second Count, Fulk the Good, waged no wars and took but little part in politics : of him is related the story that when on his way to Tours from his own province he met a leper desiring to be carried to the shrine of St. Martin ; the good Fulk lifted up the loathsome burden which every other passer-by had refused, and bore him on his shoulders to the shrine, where the leper vanished ; and it was revealed to Fulk, as he was sitting in the choir of the church he loved so well, that the leper was the Christ Himself. His son, Geoffrey Greygown, was of a more martial character, and helped Hugh Capet to his throne before he was laid to rest with his father in the Church of St. Martin.

His prowess as a fighter was shown early in the victory of Conquereux, where, in spite of Breton pitfalls, he led his cavalry again and again upon the foe, \" as the storm wind sweeps down upon the thick cornrigs.\" By that victory he secured the lower waters of the Loire. Farther up he held Amboise through his mother's right, and Loches by his wife, and from both places he dashed out upon Touraine against the power of Odo, Count of Blois, in the beginnings of a strife which was but the foreshadowing of the quarrel between Stephen of Blois and Henry of Anjou for the English crown.

From his high tower of Loches, beneath which his son, the future Hammer of Anjou, was being brought up in a blacksmith's forge, the Black Count looked out across the lands of Beaulieu, lit up by the rising sun, and, in a sudden fit of repentance for much bloodshedding, built there, in 1012, an abbey, which was consecrated on his return from one of several visits to the Holy Land undertaken from the same strange spasmodic promptings of irregular religion. Four years later, after several victories over Odo of Blois, he turned his restless arms from Touraine northward to the lands of Maine: it was a momentous change of policy, the first link in the chain that was to stretch across the borders into Normandy and beyond seas to England, until it ended in the mar riage ofthe Empress Matilda to Geoffrey Plantagenet. But for the moment farther advance northward was stopped by a resolute attack from Blois, which the Black Falcon checked with his usual vigour. Swooping upon Saumur, whose master was away near Tours, Fulk seized the valley of the Vienne, retook Montbazon and Langeais, and by finally"], [58, "OLD TOURAINE 22 capturing Chinon, reduced all Touraine, except its capital. Characteristically he left the last task un finished, went suddenly (for the fourth time) to Jerusalem, and died on his way home near Metz.

Then, taking up Fulk's un finished work in Touraine, Geoffrey seized St. Julien and attacked the town of Tours, which, after some severe fighting, he finally captured. .But Touraine was not yet to be Angevin, and the conquest of Le Mans now began to bear fruit. In 1048 Duke William of Normandy came to the help of his suzerain the French King and attacked Maine ; but a rapid change of policy followed William's too evident and increasing power. It is characteristic of the times that some ten years after we find King Henry at Geoffrey's palace in Angers arranging a combined harrying of the Duchy of Normandy.

Nor were other signs of this shameful period any more encouraging. The only bright spot in the dark reigns of Fulk Rechin and of Philip I. is the life of Count Elias of Maine, who for a time saved Le Mans from Norman rule. But with the accession of Louis VI., and after Henry of England, by the victory of Tinchebray, had made himself master of Normandy, better days dawned for Anjou with the marriage of the new Count Fulk to Aremburg the heiress of Maine. The next years are years of fighting with Normandy and England, which resulted in impressing the English King Henry more and more with the strength and capacity of his young Angevin rival. At last, in 1 1 19, Matilda of Anjou was married to William the Aetheling, heir to the English Crown, to whom Fulk shortly after left his kingdom before going to Jerusalem. But the end was not yet. The youth who would have inherited an undisputed power over England, Normandy, and the possessions of Anjou was drowned in the White Ship in November 11 20.

All hope for the new Empire of the Angevins now rested on the issue of this marriage, and Fulk, feeling, perhaps, that his day was over and his work in Europe done, was given the cross by Archbishop Hildebert in the Cathedral of Tours, and said good-bye to his daughter, the widow of William the Aetheling, who had retired to the Abbey of Fontevrault. The rest of his family met him for the last time in the same quiet cloisters, and he went away to fight the Turks and Saracens as King of Jerusalem. Geoffrey Plantagenet, who took his name from the golden broom that brightens the wide fields of Maine and Anjou, was of \" a fair and ruddy counte nance, lit up by the lightning glance of a pair of brilliant eyes ; \" his broad shoulders and strong frame were graceful as they were strong and active. Nor were his intellectual attainments less striking, in a time of almost universal ignorance among the fighting barons. Within a few years a son and heir was born to Matilda at Le Mans, the future Henry II., who was to overshadow even his father's strong individuality. Two years later died Henry I.

Stephen, Count of Boulogne, the first layman in England after the King, was the third son of Stephen, Count of Blois, by his wife, Adela, daughter of the Conqueror. At the King's death he had the immense advantage of being on the spot almost immediately after, though such a tempest arose at his crossing from Boulogne as almost rid the young heir in Anjou of his most dangerous rival. But at first the outlook seemed black indeed for the child of Geoffrey and Matilda. England they had lost, and Normandy was gone too ; yet the Angevin persistence won at last, helped by the old unsteady nature traditional in the house of Blois. In 1 1 39 Matilda sailed for England with her son, to be received by Robert of Gloucester. Seven years of struggle followed, during which the English Chronicle gives a fearful picture of the sufferings of the land, until, in 1146, Stephen secured his hold upon the English crown. Meanwhile across the Channel Geoffrey of Anjou had taken Normandy, and had been recognised its duke by King Louis VI. The young Henry was then called back to be given the duchy by his father, who died in 1 151.

While these two worked together they were the best of friends ; and when their interests clashed their hatred was the keener.

After a vain attempt to settle it by the famous Constitu tions of Clarendon, Thomas Becket, much to the delight of the French King, was soon flying for safety to a Cistercian abbey in Burgundy. Mean while King Henry's power grew and strengthened on both sides of the Channel.

On the 29th of December in the same year all Europe was horrified by the news of the Archbishop's murder before the shrine of St. Benedict in the Cathedral of Canterbury.

No Bacbuc was there to throw us into a poetic frenzy, but the stones before us, eloquent in their ruin, were enough to rouse the dullest of imaginations. This cliff that rises steeply above the waters of the Vienne at some little distance from its banks was, like Amboise and Langeais, some four hundred years before Christ, the home of a Celtic tribe who drove out a still earlier race ; traces of these latter are perhaps to be found in the dolmen of great stones about two miles to the east of Chinon, which may have marked the burial place of a chief. In the writings of Gregory of Tours Chinon is described as a \" castrum \" \u2014 the word he always uses for a Roman fort, and the Romans left their traces here as they have done in nearly all the fortress cliffs which dominate the plains and rivers of Touraine ; Roman funeral urns and the remains of bodies have been found that had been burnt within the ramparts, for the Roman Empire had, in 446 A.D., been shaken to its base by barbarian invasions ; the Armorican Republic had just been joined by the men of Tours and Anjou, for whom a little later St. Mexme was performing miracles within the fort to keep at bay the forces of Aegidius.

A sepulchral stone (still preserved within the chateau) was found among these remains of masonry, representing a man upright in a large tunic with wide sleeves ; above it is the crescent-shaped sign so often found in monuments of this period. Looking upwards at the whole line of buildings from the town, the arrangement of the three castles becomes apparent. Farthest to the right stood the castle and chapel of St. George, built by the Plan tagenet kings to protect the one weak point in a position of almost unique strength and safety, the tongue of land to the east which unites the pro montory on which the fortress rests to the line of hills beyond it. Joining these buildings, now levelled to the ground, to the Chateau du Milieu, is a fine stone bridge on bold archways with carved balustrades that leads to the drawbridge of the entrance beneath the Tour de l'Horloge. The little guardian in petticoats who replies to the traveller's summons for admission still hears him, and still answers his request, through the narrow slit cut in the thickness of the wall that communi cates with the room in which the soldiers used to work the portcullis.

Immediately behind this is the guardroom and armoury, next comes the kitchen, then the common living-room, whose windows are furnished with low stone seats on which to sit and watch the curve of the Vienne as it flows towards the Loire. From the next room, which has a small square bakehouse by its side, descends a strange little flight of steps through a narrow passage cut in the rock down to the bottom of the moat. This moat is crossed by a stone bridge, which, like the longer one at the entrance, replaced the old wooden structure about the sixteenth century. It is defended by two towers ; from that on the left, built in the thirteenth century, perhaps the best view of the whole castle is to be obtained, while the full sweep of the river below is seen at its finest. The tower on the right is of the same epoch, and contains some of the best masonry in Chinon ; it was the old donjon of the castle, and its strong foundations plunge down into the moat beneath in one bold line of massive buttress.

Along the wall of which this tower forms the western corner are the oldest relics of the twelfth century buildings. Chinon more than all other places in this part of the country leaves an impression of antiquity far greater than that of its neighbours ; it is easy to people Blois with the gallants of Henry III.'s Court, or the intrigues of Louis XIV. ; Chenonceaux tells its own light, uneventful story in every ripple of reflected sunbeam upon its graceful windows ; but Chinon, greater in extent than all of them, a very wilderness of towers and battlements-^Chinon is in ruins irretrievably. It would seem as if the move ments to which its walls gave birth were too weighty for the nurse that bore them, and the mother of so many royal fortunes has not had strength to live to see the fulness of their destiny. The history of the Plantagenets of Chinon has passed on to the walls of Windsor. The dense woodland of larches, oaks, and firs which stretches to the north-east, almost to the valley of the Indre, was no doubt one of the attrac tions of Chinon to Fulk Nerra and to the greatest of his descendants, Henry II. of England and Anjou, whose favourite home in France was here. It"], [76, "OLD TOURAINE 40 remains for us to complete the story of the Angevin kings which was traced up to the highest point of their prosperity. A great change is now to come. With the death of \" the young King,\" his son Henry, in 1 183, discord at once broke out between Richard, Geoffrey, and John, the other three sons ; a further element of complication was introduced by the death of Geoffrey of Brittany, whose son Arthur was almost immediately claimed by the French King as his ward. The confusion had reached such a pitch that Richard had seized his father's treasury at Chinon, when news came of the great Saracen victory over Guy of Lusignan, which gave Jerusalem itself into the hands of the Infidels, and Richard took the cross from the Archbishop of Tours. The would-be Crusaders began operations against the Infidel by quarrelling among themselves at home ; amidst a general disorder Richard joined Philip of France against his father, and Henry II., hotly besieged within Le Mans, had but just time to escape from the flaming town towards the Norman frontier. Suddenly changing his direction, in a ride that equalled the legendary rush of the Black Falcon on Saumur, the King spurred frenziedly back to Chinon, while his attendant knights fainted or died from fatigue and wounds upon the way. Then Philip advanced by Chaumont and Amboise as far as Rochecorbon, and proposed a meeting at Azay ;"], [77, "CHINON 41 but the devil which had helped Fulk Nerra on his ride had entered into Henry after his escape from Maine, a devil of despair and pain that racked his peace of mind while it tortured his body with a fever. Tours fell to the French King, and Henry was unable to move from his room. Then he was summoned again to meet Philip at Colombieres between Azay and Tours. By a great effort Henry started from Chinon, and rested on his way at the Commanderie of the Knights Templars at Ballan ; there, leaning for support in his extreme anguish against a wall, he was persuaded to rest for a while by William the Marshal. The meeting was for the next day, and neither his own son nor the French King would put it off. On that July morning two great shocks of thunder from a clear sky put the finishing touch to the collapse of the poor King, who was obliged to be held fainting upon his horse \u2014 he signed a humiliating peace. On his return to Chinon he had just strength left to soundly rate the monks of Canterbury, who had come at this inopportune moment to present their demands ; one of them, as he went out, cursed him by the memory of the murdered Becket. That night his Chancellor was reading to him the list of the rebels. \" Sire,\" said he, \" may Jesus Christ help me ! the first name which is written here is the name of Count John, your son.\" Then Henry turned his face to the wall, caring no more for himself or for the"], [78, "OLD TOURAINE 42 world. For some days he lay half unconscious, muttering, \" Shame, shame on a conquered King.\" At last he was carried out to die before the altar of the castle chapel. The servants stripped his body and laid it naked on the ground to be covered by a cloak borrowed from William de Trihan. The last rites were with difficulty arranged by William the Marshal. \" Robed as for coronation, with a crown of gold upon his head, a gold ring upon his finger, sandals upon his feet, and a sceptre in his gloved right hand,\" he was borne across the bridge that he had built to be laid in state in the Abbey Church of Fontevrault ; thither came his unworthy son Richard to see the body, which streamed with blood, it is said, as he approached it. Henry was buried before the high altar by Bartholomew the Archbishop of Tours, in July 1 189. Three years afterwards Philip of France, returned from the Crusades, was ravaging Anjou. The attacks on the foreign dominions of England which had been prompted by the news of Richard's imprison ment ceased for the moment when he was released. But in 1 193 the attacks upon Touraine had become so fierce and systematic that Richard left England never to return, and made direct for Tours, where he drove out the canons of St. Martin as being friends of the French King. He then blockaded Loches and took it, turned on Blois, and surprised so many valuable papers and cases that Philip was obliged"], [79, "CHINON 43 to make a truce ; finally, where the Seine bends suddenly to the north, Richard built his famous Chateau Gaillard with its three lines of defence very much like the walls of Chinon. The fame of the Lionheart, which gains little from his doings in French territory, is still less increased by the story of his death. In 1 1 99, being very much pressed by want of money, he suddenly heard that a treasure had been discovered at Chalus, and claimed it as the overlord. In attempting to take the castle he was shot, and died from the mortification of the wound.1 John, who had been appointed as his brother's heir, hurried to Chinon and was acknowledged King by the royal household. But a counter-claimant appeared in Arthur of Bretagne, who was at Tours with his mother, Constance, supported by the King of France and the adherence of the barons of Touraine. To attempt to foil Constance, Eleanor came out from Fontevrault and took up her son John's cause. A peace was patched up by the Dauphin's marriage with Blanche, niece of the English King. In the next year John, having put away his first wife Avice of Gloucester, scandalised the barons by his marriage with Isabel, the daughter of the Count of Angouleme, and spent the next summer at Chinon with her and Berengaria the widow of his brother Richard. 1 In the Chroniques de Normandie, a MS. of the fifteenth century, there is a strange picture of the storming of Chalus, showing Richard's wound in the shoulder."], [80, "OLD TOURAINE 44 Discontent grew more and more throughout the provinces. Already had John been sentenced by default to lose his lands and fiefs, when Philip in 1 20 1 attacked Arques while Arthur of Brittany besieged Tours, where his small band of knights was reinforced by Hugh de la Marche (the bridegroom John had first insulted) and by Geoffrey of Lusignan, an inveterate foe of the Plantagenets. The next move was to the siege of Mirebeau, whither John's mother Eleanor had gone after her second retreat to Fontevrault. Arthur was taken prisoner by the relieving forces which John brought up, sent to Falaise, and was no more heard of. This was a fatal mistake, for it drove John's rebellious subjects to choose between him and Philip. Their choice was soon made. By spring of the next year the taking of the Chateau Gaillard drove the English from all French lands north of the Loire ; on Midsummer Eve, 1205, after a long and desperate siege, Chinon was taken too, and by the beginning of 1 206 the English were finally driven out of France. In the thirteenth century there was not much of importance that happened at Chinon. The French monarchy, so much enlarged and strengthened by Philip Augustus, was still further expanded by the religion and the higher life of St. Louis, \" the most loyal man of his age,\" whom Charles VIII. and all France of the time looked back upon as their patron"], [81, "CHINON 45 saint, and with whom died the last spark of the crusading spirit. In 1309 occurred one of the few notable events of the next century at Chinon, the examination of Jacques Molay, Grand Master of the Knights Templars, by the Pope's cardinals in state assembled. The order of the Templars had been founded nearly two hundred years before by nine knights who defended the Temple at Jerusalem. Growing in wealth and strength, the Knights had left Palestine and built their Temple opposite the Louvre in Paris. Strange rumours of the wealth and wickedness of this secret society were rife throughout France, and suddenly the King seized every member of it ; the \" Proces des Templiers \" l gives some horrible details of their trial and examination. Meanwhile the Pope, 1 In the collection of Documents inidits sur Fhistoire de France. See also Revue des deux Mondes, 15th Jan. 1891, \" Le Proces des Temp liers d'apres des documents nouveaux,\" Ch. V. Langlois ; and L. Delisle, Mimoires sur les operations financiires des Templiers. The Knights Templars so unrighteously condemned six centuries ago have only quite lately received the justice due to them ; the verdict of Michelet must be reversed in the face of the later facts forthcoming. It seems clear that the chief, if not the only reason for the summary destruction of the order was to be found in the rapacity and indebtedness of the King. From the acknowledged safety of their fortresses in Europe it had resulted that the Templars became the bankers of the warriors and prelates of the troublous times of the Crusades. The wide extent of their connections enabled them to begin operations of the highest value with the Jews and Lombards, and their inevitable rise in power and importance was the beginning of their unpopularity. The King who hunted them down was also their heaviest creditor. The only testi mony against them was the confessions wrung from the anguish of the prisoners by the torture to which they were mercilessly condemned."], [82, "OLD TOURAINE 46 who was in \" Babylonish captivity \" at Avignon, was made to dissolve their order, many Templars (includ ing the Grand Master) were burnt in Paris, and almost the only remnant of their existence left in France is the name of \" Commanderie,\" which still clings, as at Ballan, to the places where once a house of the famous order used to stand. This particular Com manderie, whose graceful modern rooms are grouped round the little library with its carved ceiling, which is the last relic of the Templars, was inhabited even down to 1790 by the Knights of St. John, who suc ceeded the old order. In 1337 began the Hundred Years' War, the struggle between France and England for the mastery which began with the crushing defeats of Crecy and Poitiers. Then came the period of Du Guesclin's victories over the English from 1 360 to 1380, only to be followed by another twenty years of disaster which ended in the catastrophe of Agincourt. The fortunes of France were indeed at a low ebb ; it is from Chinon that the first ray of hope appears ; the short visit of Joan of Arc, the beginning of that romantic and inexplicable episode of which she is the heroine, is the salient point among all the traditions of the castle. The years that immediately followed Agincourt were terrible years for France. The Dukes of Bour bon and Orleans, fighting in the front rank, had been taken prisoner, and the power of the Armagnac"], [83, "CHINON 47 party was still further weakened by the alliance of the Queen (who had been exiled to Tours for her misconduct) with the Burgundian party. The mas sacres in Paris which followed resulted in the death of some two thousand of the Armagnacs, and the Dauphin himself hardly escaped with life. The so called \" Cabochiens \" were filling Paris with blood shed and disorder.1 Soon after the death of Henry of England the poor French King ceased the mockery of life that still remained to him ; the touching attachment of his people to this crazed monarch would alone show how oppressive was the rule of the princes who were now in power. In 1422 the Dauphin assumed his royal robes as Charles VII. in Berri, while Bedford and his Englishmen in Paris were shouting \" Long live the King of France and England \" round the little son of Henry V. The English had run a wedge into the very heart of France from the sea -coast to Paris, and to this lazy, kindly, good-looking Charles VII. was left the task of turning them out. His defeats at the very outset were so numerous that he was nicknamed \" Le Roi de Bourges,\" and the misery of France went on unabated.2 The state of the people at this time 1 Monstrelet relates the entry of the Burgundians into Paris on 28th May 1418, and the Journal of the Bourgeois de Paris gives terrible details of the scenes in the streets during the continual massacres that went on.

The evil influences of La Trdmouille and the anti-nationalist party had already begun to be felt in this as in other matters about the Court, when in 1428 letters came from Tours praying for help against the English at Orleans, the northernmost point of the Loire and the key to Southern France, which was besieged by Bedford.

She needed all her courage to support the cold and cynical reception which was all she found in return for enthusiasm and offers of victory ; and the Chapel of St. Martin in the castle precincts must have witnessed no slight struggle between her reluctance to go forward and her eagerness to fulfil her destiny. The contemptuous trial of her powers made by the King at her very first appearance, the examina tions and tests which she was afterwards to undergo, the numberless perils of her position, all must have combined to make her self- sought trial wellnigh harder than she could bear.

There is no fact more astonishing in history and none better established than this episode of Joan of Arc.2 She was not believed in by many of those in power in her time, a time which was still strongly imbued with the principles of feudalism and keenly suspicious of movements in a new direction ; in her vin et me dit qu'elle m'en ferait bientot boire k Paris.

If there is anything more strange than the silence of France while her heroine was being tried by unjust judges and cruelly done to death, it is the almost complete silence, either for praise or blame,1 which for a long time follows the burning of the Maid at Rouen ; but of later years all France seems to have suddenly waxed enthusiastic over this episode in her history ; statues, dramas, poems have followed one another in quick succession ; it needed the Revolution and the rise of the people to exalt the shepherdess into a national saint. \" I never 1 If we except the \"proces de rehabilitation,\" and Le Mistire du Siige d'Orleans (produced in 1467), which ends before her death, we can find nothing worth the writing about Jeanne d'Arc till far later times."], [90, "OLD TOURAINE 54 committed the crime,\" says Southey, \" of reading Voltaire's La Pucclle\" and we recommend our readers to follow the English poet's example ; the untrue picture given of the Maid of Orleans by Shakespeare becomes in the later work a cynically false and distorted libel. M. Joseph Fabre, whose enthusiastic work is one of the most conscientious monographs existing on this subject, draws out a strange parallel between Joan of Arc and Socrates with regard to the visions and voices which the shepherdess constantly affirmed had been vouchsafed to her. The results of later investigations go to show that at the time of Jeanne's visions, St. Michael, on whose assistance she lays especial stress, was particularly in the minds of all devout French men. The hated English had just received a decisive check among the swirling tides and treacherous quicksands of the rock of Mont St. Michel, on the northern coasts ; the patron saint of that strange island fortress seemed to have already begun his defence of French territory. But such supernatural problems are too wide for us ; more interesting is it to trace the gradual rehabilitation of Joan of Arc in the good opinion of the English, her first and unfair judges.1 In that opinion she passed through all the stages of the sorceress, the heroine, and the saint.

Caxton gives a small page to her in his English Chronicles, in which is mentioned the lie that Shakespeare has preserved against her tainted purity. Historians, whose chief profession was the faith of Christ born in a manger, were equally unfavourable in dealing with the peasant heroine of France.2 By Thomas Fuller she is still classed with the Witch of Endor, and it is only in the eighteenth century that the change begins.

After Jeanne's death a certain change seems to have come over the King's life at Chinon.1 From the Tour d'Argentan, in the corner of the Chateau du Milieu farthest from the entrance, it is said that a secret passage used to wind,2 by which Charles VIL, at that time more worthy of the name of King, visited Agnes Sorel, whose statue rests upon its sculptured lambs at Loches. \" Je vais combattre ; Agnfes l'ordonne ; Adieu repos ; plaisirs adieu,\" 1 The fame of the favourite of Charles VII. has rather obscured the virtue and goodness of his wife, who quietly encouraged all the best influences of the time ; see the miniature in Les Douze Perilz dEnfer by her learned chaplain Robert Blondel, in which he presents the book to her, 1455. \u2014 Biblioth. de T Arsenal. s No traces of it exist now."], [93, "CHINON (Continued) 57 as Beranger makes him say, and whether owing to the influence of \" la belle des belles \" or not, the King of 1450 is a very different man from the \" roi faineant\" for whom Jeanne d'Arc died. \" Dunois, la Tremouille, Saintrailles, O Frangais ! quel jour enchants Quand des lauriers de vingt batailles Je couronnerai ta beauts !

But even Agnes Sorel could not charm away the troubles which pursued Charles VII. in all his chateaux. At Chinon the Dauphin had been whispering with the Sire de Chabannes, and from the window of his rooms was plotting away the honour of the Scottish guards. Useless to execute several of the soldiers and to expel the Dauphin \u2014 one trouble was but followed by another. Heralds arrived with their futile explanations and were sent back in anger, and at last the King with his soldiers wearily set out for Amboise on his way northwards. At Mehun sur Yevre he died, and the news soon came to Marie d'Anjou, the wife he had left at home, that she was a widow, for black care sat behind the horseman and killed him more surely than the arrows of the enemy.1 The reign of Louis XI. was marked at Chinon by the arrival at the royal stronghold of Margaret of Anjou. Quitting for a time the struggles between Lancaster and York, this somewhat turbulent Queen had left Kirkcudbright for Brittany and Anjou to get help from Louis XL, who promised more than might have been expected of him. He probably had his reasons.

Any diversion, too, that would tend to unsettle the dynasty in England was a welcome aid, keeping the English in a state of enforced neutrality ; there was even the chance of Calais being surrendered as the price of help. So, strangely enough, Peter de Br\u00a3ze, the Seneschal of Normandy, was offered his choice of continued prison or the chances of the English wars, and we find him later on assisting the restless Margaret at the siege of Alnwick, while the strife between the two parties went on as fiercely as ever. Louis himself did not often darken Chinon with his presence. It was close to here, at Les Forges, in the forest to the north-east, that while the King was at dinner, \" luy vint comme une perclusion,\" and he lost the power of speech. Commines, who tells us of the scene, was sent for, and waited on his sick master for forty days. Other courtiers, who had not been so well advised in their offers of assistance, were exiled from the Court as soon as Louis re covered. His great fear was a loss of authority in his weakness. All the time of his illness the two brothers, Louis and Charles d'Amboise, were writing despatches and arranging affairs of State in a lower room, but every letter had to be taken up to the paralytic, who could barely see or speak, to receive the mockery of his approval. It was at the time of his recovery from this attack that he at last released"], [96, "OLD TOURAINE 60 Cardinal Balue, whom he kept imprisoned fourteen years. His last and fatal illness overtook him at Plessis-lez-Tours. A more interesting event is the betrothal of Philippe de Commines to Mdlle. de Montsoreau, which took place at Chinon in 1473. It was during the strange scene at Peronne, where the craft of Louis almost overreached itself and placed him in the hands of Charles, Duke of Burgundy, that Commines had first learned the extraordinary intellectual powers of Louis XL, with which he seems to have been so much dazzled that he lost sight of the depravity of that odious monarch's real character. Just before his betrothal the historian had passed into France, where \" Louis XI. lui fit cet honneur de dire qu'il l'avait bien servy a Peronne.\" The Duke of Burgundy let him off all debts on his estate, the convenient sum of 6000 livres came in from a jeweller at Tours, and he was richly rewarded by the French King for a loyalty which was frequently held up to the imitation of his companions. That there was a real tie of sympathy and friendship between these two very different characters is seen, if in nothing else, in the fact that Commines was almost the only man who could understand the King's enfeebled utterances during his illness. This keenness of temperament was reflected, too, in the finesse with which he managed all the political affairs"], [97, "CHINON (Continued) 61 with which he was entrusted either in France or Italy. Among his other rewards he was made Governor of Chinon in 1476, and soon began to take that active part in politics which ended later on in his imprisonment at Loches by Anne of Beaujeu, who held the royal power for her young brother Charles VIII. \" I have ventured on the great ocean,\" he says regretfully, \" and the waves devoured me.\" But he emerged with safety later on, and the world gained his history, written, it is said, in the hours of his enforced leisure. He was employed by Charles VIII. and favoured by Louis XII., though this latter monarch showed him some little in gratitude, and perhaps rather feared the political experience of a minister of Louis XI. His work as an ambassador, especially in Italy, was always of service to his country ; his work as a writer was the only thing of the kind that could have been compared to that of Machiavelli or even of Guicciardini, the first sound attempt at a philo sophy of history ; and by his death at Argenton, near Chinon, France lost one of her most skilful statesmen and far the best historian of his time.1 1 Montaigne's opinion of Commines is worth recording here. \" En Monsieur Philippe de Commines il y a cecy : vous y trouverez le langage doux et agreable d'une naifve simplicite, la narration pure, et en laquelle la bonne soy de 1'autheur reluit evidamment exempte de vanite parlant de soy, et d'affection et d'envie parlant d'autruy.\" Mon taigne's recommendation of his own essays to his readers could produce no better justification for an author's work.

In 1498 Louis XII., who had just come to the throne, was applying to Pope Alexander VI. for a divorce from his first wife, Jeanne de France. The royal letters came to the Vatican during the reign of the Borgias. Lucrezia was being given in marriage to one after another of the Italian princes as it suited the policy of her unscrupulous father. C\u00e6sar Borgia, who had not long before murdered his brother, the Duke of Gandia, was longing to give full rein to his ambition, to throw away his Cardinal's hat and take up the sword, to fight his way from a successful captaincy to the Dukedom of the Romagna, and even higher honours. The request of Louis XII. came at a very opportune moment. The bill of divorce was easily bought from C\u00e6sar's father by the gift of the Duchy of Valentinois to his son, and a treaty promising equal advantages to France and friend of Commines, tells us he was tall and handsome, that he spoke German, Italian, and Spanish, that his memory was prodigious, and his industry amazing."], [99, "CHINON (Continued) 63 the Vatican. In the general interchange of civilities Georges d'Amboise was given a Cardinal's hat, and c\u00e6sab BORGIA (drawn from the Woodcut in Paulus Jovius, ed. 1575). towards the end of 1498 C\u00e6sar Borgia set out from Ostia for Marseilles, accompanied by the Baron de"], [100, "64 OLD TOURAINE Traus, the French ambassador, and provided with ample funds for his lavish expenditure upon the way from the two hundred thousand ducats seized from the unfortunate Bishop of Calahorra. In those days the science of etiquette was very fearfully and wonderfully arranged, and in all their treatises the worried officials at the French Court could find no mention of the reception proper to a Pope's son. The difficulty was evaded without suppressing the gorgeous entry which it was well known the Italian had prepared for himself and his suite. The King went hunting with his Court and met Borgia some miles outside the town ; upon the bridge across the river the Cardinal de Rohan was ready to receive the Italians, and headed the procession that started for the castle gates ; every detail of its magnificence has been carefully preserved for us. First came eighty mules in gorgeous harness blazoned with C\u00e6sar Borgia's crest and arms, fol lowed by the finest horses of the prince's stables ; then eighteen pages riding, clad in \" velours cram oisie,\" two of them resplendent in cloth of gold ; more mules followed \" still more exquisitely ap pointed,\" evidently carrying \"the precious documents from Rome,\" thought the onlookers ; after, amid a flourish of drums and trumpets, rode the new Due de Valentinois and his suite, among whom was the Cardinal d'Amboise. The duke was resplendent in"], [101, "CHINON (Continued) 65 red satin and cloth of gold, and thickly covered with jewels ; great rubies were in his cap, his very boots were sewn with precious stones.1 A crowd of mules, carriages, and litters closed the procession ; \" Ainsi entra pour avoir grand renom Ledit Seigneur au Chateau de Chinon,\" sings the poet whom Brantome copied ; but while the formal welcome was in progress within the royal apartments, the old soldiers who had fought through Italy with Charles VIII. were laughing at this new fledged Frenchman's ostentation, a display, by the way, which C\u00e6sar rarely allowed himself in Italy. That evening the articles of the treaty were agreed upon \u2014 the divorce was granted and the alliance formed against Naples ; in return, France was to help the Pope in the Romagna, C\u00e6sar was to receive the Duchy of Valentinois and certain sums down in ready money ; better than all, he was to be given the services of one hundred French knights ; thefleurs de lys of France were to be quartered with the Borgia arms \u2014 \" c'etait lui livrer l'ltalie,\" says Michelet. But what was perhaps nearer to the duke's 1 An authentic portrait of C\u00e6sar Borgia is a difficult thing to find. Of the portraits in the Bibliotheque Nationale, a drawing by Lec\u0153ur is the best, which is probably taken from the woodcut in Paulus Jovius. The famous description of C\u00e6sar Borgia which Jovius gives is worth inserting: \"Faciem atro rubore suffusam . . . oculosque introrsus re cedentes, et atroci vipereoque obtutu scintillantes ac igneos ostenderet, quos nee amici quidem et familiares contuendo ferre possent ; quanquam eos inter foeminas jocabundus, mira commutatione ad lenitatem con vertere consuesset.\" \u2014 Pauli Jovii, Elogia, p. 201. 1575.

The later history of Chinon is not so full of interest ; the movement of events passes to the other chateaux, whose Renaissance windows had been scarcely thought of when C\u00e6sar Borgia was in France. The castle is somewhat troubled by the vicissitudes of the Wars of Religion and frequently changes hands, not without suffering from the excesses of both parties. The townspeople of Chinon, who seem to have shown an extraordinary amount of pluck and spirit in these trying times, were still further harassed by a terrible visitation of the plague: the first attack lasted four years. After the murder of Guise at Blois had still further embittered party spirit throughout the kingdom, and Henry of Navarre had led his forces to Chinon on his way to attack the Due de Mayenne, who had succeeded his murdered brother in the headship of the Catholic League, the plague broke out again in 1589, and throughout the unhappy little town the red and white crosses were marked upon the doors, and great fires burnt at every thirty paces to purify the poisoned air. A strange glimpse of the habits of the time is given in the records of the rude sanitary precautions"], [103, "CHINON (Continued) 67 that were taken at this crisis : \" pourceaux, vaches, pigeons, oies, cannes, ou autres betes immondes \" are to be kept out of the houses, says the edict, which might have been framed for the benefit of a be nighted Irish peasantry ; one Matthieu Renard and his wife are charged with the care of the sick at a fixed price. In the' midst of all this distress events outside were following fast. The letter of Henry III. to his wife Louise, at Chinon, reached her after her husband's death by the knife of Jacques Clement ; she retired to an inconsolable widowhood in Chenonceaux. The old Cardinal de Bourbon had been summoned from his prison in the castle to dispute his royal title with Henry of Navarre, and died without defending it. Chinon was rapidly entering on the last century of its existence. The history of the town in the first years of the seventeenth century gains considerably in interest from the careful accounts of its \" Receveur, M. Besnard,\" which have been preserved by M. de Cougny. After the peace this good M. Besnard, whose acquaintance it is quite worth while to make in these records, welcomes with his fellow-townsmen the Prince of Conde. He fires salvos of honour from certain \" fauconnaux \" placed upon the bridge, which was still in ruins, and presents the traditional offering of fruit and wine, nay, even searches for artichokes to send up to the castle, and \" confitures"], [104, "68 OLD TOURAINE seches \" for the princess \u2014 the last refinement of politeness. Conde was soon sent off to Vincennes, and there was no one now to send sweetmeats to the ladies, for Roehefort, the \" ame damnee \" of the Cardinal, is there instead, and soon the whole town is cringing to the great Richelieu himself in the full pride of that despotism which was partly forced upon him by the anarchy of Huguenot revolutions. How the delicate but frugal soul of Besnard would have shuddered had he seen the town -clerk of a community grown recklessly extravagant spend nearly three hundred livres upon a single fete. But it was almost the last that Chinon, either town or castle, was to see. In 1628 the outraged inhabitants with difficulty persuaded Muret, the King's architect, to spare their castle walls ; and when Chinon was joined with Langeais, Richelieu, and other estates to the great possessions of the Cardinal, the old castle only bored him, and was designedly left to ruin and decay. One of the greatest of the feudal monuments was allowed to moulder into uselessness, like the institutions of which it was a remnant, by the man with whose name is chiefly connected the final crushing of the feudal spirit. M. Touchard Lafosse says that in 1758 the room where Jeanne d'Arc was received still stood in its entirety.

Some three or four miles farther on we reached the extreme limit of the Province of Indre et Loire, the town of Candes,1 where the dark and swift waters of the Vienne mingled with the ice-bound current of the Loire.

And Candes itself is little like to what it was. Placed at the meeting of the waters, it must very early have been marked out as a place of some importance, and indeed, before 400 there must have been a con siderable number of clergy at the church which the famous Bishop of Tours had built here, for in that year St. Martin, being on a visit to the priests, died at Candes.1 His body was, after some dispute with the men of Poitou, buried at Tours, and the church at Candes was consecrated afresh to his memory. It was no unworthy companion, on a small scale, to that great shrine at Tours, of which but two towers remain to indicate its ancient size and beauty. In any other country than Touraine such a church as that at Candes would have alone made the district famous, and no greater surprise had encountered us than this sudden sight of sculptured saints and battle mented roofs 2 at an opening of the twisting little 1 In 1495 the town had already begun to decrease in size and importance.

The fourteen statues rest on a base richly decorated with foliage and strange monsters, twisting round the heads of kings and queens carved with marvellous expression. The decoration is extended up the towers, and seems in many cases unfinished, for in several of the niches simple blocks of stone are left that have never been carved into completeness. The interior of the porch is supported by one light springing column, whose capital branches into the groined work of a roof all carved with statues and strange arabesques. Within the church the same transition of style is observable. The lacework of the foliage upon the double rank of pillars in the nave is in the late thirteenth -century Gothic, while the capitals in the choir are Byzantine.

The road along the river bank turns south to Fontevrault at the village of Montsoreau, which irre sistibly reminded us of Bussy d'Amboise and his unfortunate Diana.1 But the place was long filled with more terrible associations. It served as the rendezvous for a swarm of titled robbers, whose exactions from the voyagers up and down the Vienne and the Loire remained a standing source of annoy ance to the district until the days when Richelieu could veil his policy beneath a semblance of benevo lence, and relieve the river trade by crushing the feudal rights of Montsoreau.

At this time one Robert d'Arbrissel, a monk of \"humble but honest parentage\" and a scholar of some mark at Paris, had begun to distinguish himself by the fervour and eloquence of his preaching. So great became his renown that Pope Urban II. especially requested him to preach in favour of the Crusades, which just then were moving all the hearts of Europe.

He was soon surrounded by crowds of men and women, good and bad, of every age and degree, who left all to follow him. At the head of this vast multitude, which kept increasing every day, the preacher wandered through town and country until his flock of converts became unmanageable. He had started for the Holy Land ; his charity was compelled to begin nearer home, and at last in this valley he had to stop and make some provision for his strange and ill-assorted company. The contrasts have begun already, these voyagers for Palestine settle by the Loire ; such was the strange beginning of the famous institution that was to shelter the children of kings beneath its roof, and to become famous throughout the length and breadth of Europe. The queer pilgrimage had ceased by a spring where tradition still remembers the habitation of the robber Evrault, whose stronghold with its conical roof and lantern is still recommended to the wonder of the credulous. The place had a bad reputation, and the owners of the ground found the pious task an easy one of giving up a site to the new colony. Help of more land, of food and clothing, poured in from all sides.

What was the motive of D'Arbrissel in his plans it is difficult and perhaps profitless to conjecture, but the fact remains that the prosperity of Fontevrault seemed to depend upon its Lady Abbess, and to vary in proportion at once to the strength and the weakness of her authority. But the founder's motto, \" Mere voila votre fils, sils voila votre mere,\" was to have a wider meaning still : the mixed character of his first flock was to be reflected in the future constitution of the community. The first four houses built by the first abbess were for the learned ladies, for penitent women, for lepers, and for monks, and suggested pretty accurately the mingled elements of the first assembly, which had now grown to the respectable figure of 4000. After leaving the strictest rules as to the separation of the sexes, their clothing and their food, and abso lutely prohibiting the use of wine (\" qui fait meme apostasier les sages,\" say the rules), the good founder died, and was honoured by a funeral at which a great number of his admirers from all parts of the country assisted. The reign of the abbesses had begun ; a glance at their names alone, in the list published by M. Malifaud, will give an idea of the importance to which the institution soon attained.

Especially was this the case with Henry 1 1., who built the Pont aux Nonnains, which we have already heard of, across the Vienne, near Chinon, to allow, men said, an easy passage from the castle to the abbey and its fair inmates, who were already suspected of something more than ready hospitality.

The last, and perhaps the best of the four as a work of art, is of smaller size and carved in wood which has also been coloured : it represents another English Queen, Isabel of Angouleme, one of the most wicked and most beautiful women of her time. She was the daughter of Aymar, Count of Angouleme, and upon the day of her betrothal to Hugues de Lusignan she was carried off by John of England, who put away his first wife Avice to marry this unprincipled and voluptuous beauty ; she bore him the future Henry III.

In 1848 Louis Philippe moved them to Versailles ; they even travelled through the busy streets of Paris to the Louvre to be repainted, but on their way to England the famous 24th of February intervened, and they were reclaimed finally and irrevocably by the province in which they now rest after these strange wanderings. \" The eastern part of the Abbey of Fontevrault,\" says Mr. Petit,1 \" though it exhibits slightly pointed arches, has a pure Romanesque rather than a transi tional character.

Touraine con sequently became the centre of the new movement and the home of a strong and flourishing art. By the middle of the sixteenth century the manufacture of tapestry,1 which had not appeared as a local industry anywhere else in France, had taken such an impetus in Tours that it seemed likely to replace the art of painting. But long before the centre of the artistic movement changed to Paris under Francis I., the school of Tours had won for itself a leading position among the artists of France, and this not only through the example of emigrants from Burgundy like Michel Columbe, for Touraine never owed much to northern influences, but rather through the visits of its own artists to Italy, such as that of Jean Fouquet,2 the painter of Louis XL, to Rome, 1 Mrs. Mark Pattison, Renaissance of Art in France, vol. i. caps.

From 1470 to 1475 he was paid by Louis XI. for pictures, miniatures, and the design for a tomb, but his chief patron was Etienne Chevalier, treasurer of Charles VII. and Louis, for whom he finished the copy of Boccaccio's \"Des Cas des Nobles Hommes et Femmes,\""], [130, "OLD TOURAINE 94 and through the many Italian artists who came from Rome by Narbonne and passed through Touraine on their way to Paris or to England.

The shower of Italian influences let loose by the expedition of Charles VIII. did not fall upon soil that was unprepared for it. Touraine and all France were already eager to learn more of the Italy with which they had begun to come in contact. An exact idea of this connection with Italy, even though briefly stated, is absolutely necessary for the understanding of what follows in the history of France.1 John, the good King of France, who died in 1 364, had a daughter Isabella, who married Gian Galeazzo Visconti, first Duke of Milan. The palace to which the French princess was brought was filled with priests and friars from the Certosa, with professors from the new college, with poets like Geoffrey now at Munich, on 24th November 1458, and also a prayer-book in which his taste for Italian architecture is especially remarkable.

Examples in England, either of the work of this artist of Tours, or of his school, are the illuminations in the French \"Legend de St. Denys\" at Christ Church, Oxford, and a prayer-book in the Bodleian Library (Douce, 311).

But his estate languished without him. Dunois had been captured, and the messenger who brought ill news said nothing of the good work that his friends were doing. Already, in 1427, hearing in the Tower of London of the English advance along the Loire, Charles had feared for his books at Blois, and sent them by the Seigneur de Mortemart to his house in Saumur. They were moved farther on to La Rochelle, until eight years later, the danger having passed, Charles writes to have them sent back to Blois, and directs especial search to be made at Orleans for a cherished little volume stamped with the arms of Berry. In 1433 he uselessly gave in his submission to the King of England, who, as the grandson of Charles VI., was posing as the real heir of France. But seven more years dragged on before the Duke of Burgundy, the son of Jean Sans Peur, arranged his deliverance. It was granted now, for the policy of England was at this time to weaken the royal power by encouraging the great barons, as it had been before to weaken feudality by keeping Orleans prisoner.

The friendship of Charles d'Orleans with the son of his father's murderer is an interesting and touching trait in this strange story of his release. His dreamy, romantic nature was not made for the sterner necessities of revenge.1 In 1440 he returned to France with all the ideas of 141 5, and took up his abode at Blois, where his \" good fat face,\" his strong Italian nose and chin, are seen among physicians and astronomers, watching over his choir, listening to the harpers, and reading the ballads that everybody wrote to please him : no one paid the least attention to Charles's own verses, the only ones that were to live. During the first few years of freedom, the time there was left to him from the business of collecting his ransom, to which every one contributed, he spent in happily wandering about and \" seeing France \" 2 after his long absence, 1 \" Or voyez que c'est des jugements de Dieu.

In 1422, John and Charles d'Orleans being both in prison and Henry VI. of England crowned King of France, Asti had sent for protection to Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan.

The old Duke of Milan wearily got rid of him ; but another factor appeared in the Dauphin Louis, whose alliance with Milan soon became clear, and Dunois, enraged, insisted on Asti being immediately given up ; this was done, for Francesco Sforza was playing for the higher stake of Milan, after the duke's death, against the unexpected heir, Alfonso of Arragon, King of Naples. Then Charles d'Orleans himself came out to Asti, but only to make promises to Venice, to lay great stress on the real friendship between himself and Burgundy, and to do nothing more practical than rhyming verses with Antonio Artesano. The hesitation of Charles gave Francesco Sforza his opportunity ; he rode into starving Milan with his soldiers' armour hidden by the welcome loaves of bread, and took the city. This was as unwelcome to the Dauphin as its occupa tion by Charles d'Orleans would have been, but a sudden rise of independent spirit repulsed for a time the French claims on Milan and on Genoa too. Charles had gone home again with much new learn ing in Italian rhymes and fashions, many new ideas on dress and arms and architecture, which were to be worked out as opportunity should serve at his own Court.

But a still greater astonishment was to come. In 1462 Charles was receiving the amused and delighted congratulations of the whole of France at the birth of the young son who was to become Louis XII. This event was not only startling but positively distasteful to Louis XL, who had quite looked forward to quietly absorbing 2 the possessions of the heirless Duke of Orleans into the Crown domain, and indeed came to Blois that very year to try and get Asti from him. But he failed, and the elegant and picturesque life at the chateau went on gravely and quietly as ever, amid a twittering of ballads and the sound of minstrels' singing, while Villon, Rene d'Anjou, Robertet, Jacques de la Tremouille, or Boulainvilliers came and played chess 3 with the old duke, or wrote 1 Of Charles's two daughters, one married the Comte de Foix, the other was an Abbess of Fontevrault. 2 Compare the policy of the same King later on in marrying this very child Louis to Jeanne de France, with the expressed desire of bringing the Une of Orleans to an end.

But Anne was too capable to be lightly put aside.

But Louis had not allowed schemes of revolt to take up all his days in Brittany : he found time to make love to the ambitious little heiress, Anne de Bretagne, who had been by no means satisfied with her marriage by proxy to the Emperor Maximilian.2 This was not unknown to Anne de Beaujeu, and Louis d'Orleans was offered his freedom if he could arrange a marriage be tween Charles VIII. and Anne. He accomplished this somewhat delicate mission successfully, and re turned home, to the warlike Court of Charles VIII., where the cautious Marechal de Gi\u00a3 was vainly striving to suppress the military aspirations of thc King. These dreams of conquest were further encouraged by the embassy of Venice asking for help against Naples, Milan, and Ferrara. The policy of Louis XI. began to bear fruit.

Knowing that his claims would not be allowed, but encouraged by secret offers of help from Venice, Orleans soon began to claim Milan for himself; but Ludovico Sforza's subtle policy necessitated not only the revoking of the imperial letters with which II Moro had provided himself, but quite new letters establishing the Visconti claim. Sforza's title had been gravely recognised, too, in Venice before the imperial ambassadors. Nothing remained but an appeal to arms. So, quite contrary to orders, Orleans sent twenty knights forward suddenly to occupy Novara, and before the month was out had seized the town.

Philip lost it for a time, but took it from John Lackland, who was not strong enough to protect the forces of the widowed Berengaria.

Here the Bastard of Bourbon, Antoine de Chabannes,1 and other captains \" avec foison de gens d'armes,\" came to meet him and arrange for the conspiracy at Moulins.

The King crushed the conspiracy and tried to give the restless Dauphin occupation in conquering the rebellious Count of Armagnac and in some very savage fighting against the Swiss. Louis' wife, Margaret of Scotland, who had sailed to her wedding at Tours pursued by English ships, died at twenty-two about this time, and certain dark suspicions clung to the Dauphin's reputation from which he never shook himself free all his life. His other characteristics soon began to show themselves too. In constant and open opposition to his father, he was at one time obliged to fly to Burgundy, and actually writes in excuse, \" pour ce que, comme vous sgavez, mon bel oncle de Bourgogne a intention de brief aller sur le Ture, a la defense de la foi catholique.\" It was while he was listening to the Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles at his distant Court at Genep, that he heard tidings of his father's death, and at last seized the power he had been thirsting for so long.

Scott's masterly presentment of Louis XI. in Quentin Durward will be in the mind of all travellers in Touraine, and Chateaubriand has thrown into strong relief the strange contrasts visible in this unique character, who was as immoral in his private life as he was tyrannically severe in public judgments.1 This Louis, who made his servants heralds, and his barbers Ministers of State, whose only confidants, says Voltaire, were low-born men with hearts lower than their stations, who regained by unscrupulous cunning what he lost by the natural depravity of his 1 It is a curious fact for students of heredity that the daughter of Marguerite de Sassenaye, the mistress of Louis, married Aymar de Poitiers, an ancestor of the fair Diana whom we shall meet at Chenon ceaux.

The King who chained up the volumes of the Nominalists protected the first printers from Germany, and the freedom of the printing press received its first real encouragement in France from the most tyrannical monarch on the French throne.

In his enlightenment and his superstition, his cruelty and his great plans for France, Louis is a true type of his age, which was that of transition from dying medi\u00e6valism to the new life which the art of the Renaissance was bringing. It had been long in coming to France. One hundred and fifty years before, Dante and Petrarch had begun modern literature, but in France the horrors of the long war with England, of the plague, of the Jacquerie, above all of the civil war, had brutalised men. The ghastly idea of possession by the devil had taken hold of men's minds, and religion became a mockery in the face of the orgies of the Papacy of Avignon or of the monks nearer home. Born in a time wherein nothing was finished and everything had begun, Louis partook of the mon strous nature of his unformed age, an age in which the 300 registers of the \" Tremor des Chartes \" paint manners as Villon, Basselin, or Regnier paint them, without shame and without restraint.

The policy of centralisation which one day should be the salvation of France was temporarily its ruin ; men were reduced to one dull, dead level, the springs of morality were choked, energy was crushed, and when the King wished to rule he found his kingdom little better than an empty void. Thus is it that great discoveries and new inventions, material aid or chance assistance, all do nothing. Yet Joan of Arc had not died or the great chancellor Gerson preached in vain.

At this juncture Ludovico returned with an army behind him, swept back Trivulzio from Milan, and took the famous Bayard prisoner. \" The Loyal Servitor \" tells the story, which does nothing but credit to II Moro.1 1 See \" Le loyal Serviteur,\" Chronique du bon Chevalier, Michaud et Poujoulat, Ire Serie, t. iv."], [187, "LOCHES (Continued) \u2014 THE PRISONS 151 Bayard, being in garrison about twenty miles from Milan, heard that there were some three hun dred Italian heads to be broken in Binasco.

With loud cries of \" France, France ! More, More ! \" the troops met, and the Italians were soon flying towards Milan with Bayard hard upon their tracks. So heartily did the good Chevalier pursue his enemies that, paying no heed to the turning back of his companions, he rushed through the gates of Milan with Cazache's men, and was therein taken and brought before Ludovico, who wondered to see him so young, and asked the business that brought him, in such hurried fashion, to Milan. Bayard, \" qui ne fut de rien \u00a3bahi,\" answered courteously and well ; and in a short time upon his own good horse again, and clad in the armour he had worn in the pursuit, he was riding out of Milan with a herald and telling the Seigneur de Ligny in the French camp of the courtesy and courage of II Moro, \" qui pour peu de chose n'est pas ais6 a 6tonner.\" As we have seen before, Novara stood or fell with Milan, and to the strengthening of Novara Ludovico now turned.

It was in this part of the conspiracy that the bishops with whom we are concerned were implicated, and they certainly suffered to the full the penalty for their imprudence. Bourbon's secret negotiations with the Emperor had taken place in the spring of 1523, and though rumours of them had reached the Court, Francis had paid no attention to them, and was on his way to Lyons for the march that was to end in Pavia, when the Sieur de Br\u00a3ze, Seneschal of Normandy, husband of the famous Diana, brought him accurate tidings of the conspiracy, which were obtained through the confession of two Norman gentlemen \u2014 De Br^ze had no notion that he"], [192, "156 OLD TOURAINE was implicating in this terrible charge his own wife's father, Jean de Poitiers, Seigneur de Saint Vallicr.

In a few days Bourbon escaped to his fortified castle of Chantelles, and from there sent the Bishop of Autun to the King asking for assurances of re stitution to his lands and goods. But the King's deepest suspicions had been aroused by the flight, and the bishop was arrested on his way to Lyons, bearing the Constable's despatches, and with him Saint Vallier, Emard de Prie, La Vauguyon, and others of the duke's friends. Bourbon meanwhile went on, stopping for one night at Puy in Auvergne, probably with his friend the bishop, and at length after several exciting escapes got safe to Italy. Still deeper in the hideous recesses of the rock of Loches, in gloomy caverns where the light from our small lamp could barely penetrate to the fungus rotting on the slimy walls, is the den where Saint Vallier, the father of Diane de Poitiers, was shut up by Francis I. \" Monsieur mon fils,\" he writes to his son the Seneschal, \" le Roy m'a faict prendre sans nulle raison . . et m'a faict mener icy au chasteau de Loches comme un faulx traistre qui m'est si tres"], [193, "LOCHES (Continued)\u2014 THE PRISONS 157 horrible regret que je m'en meurs.\" And to Diana : \" Madame \u2014 suis icy arriv^ au chasteau de Loches aussy mal traicte que paouvre prisonnier pourroit estre . . . je vous requiers ayez tant de pity6 de vostre paouvre pere que de le vouloir venir veoir.\" 1 And Diana did her best, though at first with little success, for the King wrote hotly to his judges to press the trial, and to find out by any and every means, from Saint Vallier and the others, all the details of the conspiracy. \" II faut necessairement et promptement scavoir,\" he writes, \" au besoin par torture qui sont les conspirateurs. . . .

For two years he was kept in the walls of Loches by Richelieu, without any positive proof having been brought against him, and merely in the hope of extracting some confession from his misery. To the same end he was ordered for execution and reprieved at the last moment, but 1 Mrs. Watts Jones gives the following translation of the above \u2014 \" He who sighs hath never known, Come within these walls of stone ; Here not only shall he sigh, He shall groan in misery."], [195, "LOCHES (Continued) \u2014 THE PRISONS 159 nothing would shake his determination to keep silence, and he finally left France for Italy until the King's death. No wonder that amid so many gruesome real ities one fable has arisen that has even received the support of serious authorities. A certain Pontbrillant, Governor of Loches, had the unpleasant curiosity to investigate the inmost recesses of its prisons. Several iron doors were broken down, and at last behind one of them was found the body of a man sitting with his head upon his hands, of great stature, and clothed like a knight of three centuries ago. The corpse fell into dust on contact with the outer air. Here is much matter for a tragedy. But what is known and certain is sadder than any imagination, and nothing in the castle leaves so deep an impres sion as the scratches and lines upon the walls with which the prisoners strove to lighten the weariness of their cells or to keep some thought of hope within their hearts. Here is one more of these inscriptions, with whose graceful sentiment we left behind us the blackened walls of Loches \u2014 \" Qui vaut mieux amour ou justice ?

At the end of this street rise two vast round towers that from a distance look far too big for their sur roundings, and it is not till the visitor is fairly in the little square beyond the house of Rabelais, and face to face with the main entrance, that he can realise the full proportions of the Chateau of Langeais. Alingavia, says M. Mabille, was one of the oldest of the Roman settlements, and Roman remains are still traceable in the foundations of the old donjon keep, rebuilt in 1000. Gregory of Tours tells us, too, that St. Martin built a church here, and the present edifice contains some of the early work near the east end, which is triapsal ; x some old shafts and arches are arranged on the south side so as to form a covered walk externally.2 But of the buildings within the castle walls, of which distinct traces are still left, the fort built by Foulques Nerra to blockade Eudes at Tours is the oldest. Little but the outer shell of its walls and a few traces of masonry about the windows remains, but from the little hill on which it stands can be obtained the finest view of the inner side of the chateau. \" The interior court \" \u2014 I quote from Mrs. Mark 1 Henry Petit, op. cit. 5 In 1 1 18 the Fulk of Anjou who died upon the throne of Jeru salem in 1 142, built a chapel at Langeais, and founded a collegiate church for his relics from Palestine."], [200, "164 OLD TOURAINE Pattison Y \u2014 \" is almost wholly confined by the build ings around it ; the high walls which defend it on the outside are cut up at well-guarded angles by massive towers, and pierced at irregular intervals by narrow openings. The whole length is crowned by heavy machicolated battlements, so that the aspect of the exterior is severe, but the facade which looks upon the court is not wanting in elegance. Four small towers, each of which contains a spiral staircase, break the monotony of the front and give access to the dif ferent stories. The interior space is divided out in the simplest fashion, and the arrangements adopted on the ground floor continue in unvarying repetition tier above tier. But above, along the roof, run no heavy battlements ; a bold projecting cornice takes their place in surmounting the wall, and over this rises a sharply pointed roof, the outline of which is broken by towers and pierced by chimneys and dormers.\" I have quoted thus far to make quite clear thc exact position of Langeais in the architecture of Touraine. It is a fortress of the Middle Ages that is one of the finest existing examples of a French castle built about the middle of the fifteenth century, and bears upon its very walls the traces of coming change. The cornice, which at Langeais replaces the battlements on the walls of the inside only, is destined soon to replace them on the outside also. 1 The Renaissance of Art in France, vol. i. cap. 2."], [201, "LANGEAIS 165 \" At Chenonceaux, at Azay-le-Rideau, at Blois, at Chambord, its bold projecting lines encircle each building with a crown.\" We had seen the older forms of feudal architecture at Chinon and at Loches ; Langeais seemed the connecting link be tween the older order and the new. The problem which its architect had to solve was to combine a stronghold capable of defence with a house cal culated for the increasing necessities of daily life ; the fortifications seem planned on a scale very much behind the science of the times, for gunpowder is left wholly out of the calculation, while every means for keeping out an escalade attack has been carefully made use of : the only gate that opens from without into the court is flanked, as at Chaumont, by two massive towers and guarded by a portcullis. Of the first building on this site, after the Black Count's donjon had fallen into ruins, little save a few bricks remains to indicate that Romano- Gallic methods of construction still continued. A later chateau was begun by Pierre de la Brosse, the son of a good family in Touraine, who had seen some service in the Court of St. Louis, and reached the highest powers of a favourite under Philip III.

The Chateau of Langeais as it stands at present was built in 1464 under the direction of Jean Briconnet, first mayor of Tours, by the care of Jean Bournie, minister of Louis XL, and governor of Langeais, who was also the builder of Plessis-lez- Tours, a chateau which in its complete state was"], [203, "LANGEAIS 167 very like what Langeais has remained.

Perhaps the strangest feature of the place is the quaint little passage beneath the roof, the guards' \" chemin de ronde,\" formed by the machicolations, that extends all round the chateau, lighted by innumerable little windows which give an ever changing view of the valley of the Loire from the forest of Chinon west and south, to the cathedral towers of Tours far off among the mist towards the east. But the most interesting room in Langeais is the great hall, where Anne de Bretagne was married to King Charles VIII. of France. The story of the war in Brittany, and the revolt of Orleans against the Regent Anne de Beaujeu, has already introduced us to the little Breton duchess. Brantome sketches her portrait in his Gallery of Illustrious Ladies. \" Her figure,\" says he, \"was small and delicate. It is true that one leg was shorter than the other, though by very little, and it was scarcely noticeable, for her beauty was no whit"], [204, "OLD TOURAINE 168 damaged by that, and many very beautiful women have I noticed with this same slight defect (ceste legere dsfectuosite), such as the Duchesse de Longue ville.

But if Anne had thus far gained from her Breton upbringing, she had all the Breton faults, 1 The firm chin and somewhat large nose of her face in later life are best seen in the medal struck in 1499, after her second marriage, which bears the legend \" Lugdun \u2022 Republica \u25a0 gaudente \u2022 Bis -Anna \u2022 regnante benigne \u2022 sic \u25a0 fui \u2022 conflata.\""], [205, "LANGEALS 169 the pride, the anger, and the self-will of that strong and narrowed nationality. If her wishes were clearly defined, her will imperious, her views were also somewhat limited : she lacked the supple nature of a truly great woman, because she was without that loftiness of mind and intellect which allows its possessor to appreciate while it criticises every form of life and manners with which it comes in contact. This is why we find her alternately the prey to pride, to anger, and to hate, to a tenacity of purpose through good and evil which degenerates into a wrong-headed sullenness. \" Once she has bethought her of anything,\" says Contarini, the Venetian ambassador, \" she must have her way, whether by smiles or tears.\" Similarly it is her love of ven geance, her unrelenting hatred, that her panegyrist Brantome can alone find to blame, \" si la vengeance est un sy, puisqu'elle est si belle et si douce.\" It was she who built the good ship La Cordeliere which blew up in action with the English fleet off Saint Mache in August 1513. A princess with so strongly marked a character was not one to let herself be married at the con venience of her subjects or of any man, and all Europe had been already somewhat amused at her capture of the unwilling Maximilian and her alliance with England and Spain.

At last the politic and skilful Regent saw her opportunity. Making every use of the influence over Anne possessed by the young Duke of Orleans just released from prison, and tempting at the same time her ambition by the offer of a throne, the Regent arranged the marriage of her young brother Charles VIII. with the heiress of Brittany. The duchess had little scruple in giving up her tardy lover Maximilian, whose daughter had already been somewhat similarly abandoned by the King of France, and in December 1491 the marriage contract of Anne and Charles VIII. was drawn up in the great hall of the Chateau of Langeais, which assured the union of France and Brittany, and gave the business-like little Breton the right of marrying the next King of France if she outlived her first husband. At this time she was about seventeen years old. The firmness of her character was yet veiled by the modesty and grace of youth, and all her natural courage and loyalty was conspicuous. Strictly honourable in her life as she was faithful to her religion, she at once took up the authority of her position and grasped the meaning of affairs around her. Contarini describes her husband at the same period as plain of visage, with great eyes that seemed to see but weakly, an aquiline nose too"], [207, "LANGEAIS 171 large for the face, and thick lips always open, slow of speech, and with certain nervous movements in his hands.

Pierre de Rohan, Sire de Gie, of a Breton stock, had the blood of Du Guesclin in his veins, through his grandfather's marriage, and by his mother was a descendant of the Viscontis. He was taken from Brittany, where his recollections were not of the most pleasant kind,1 by the Admiral de Montauban, and by him placed in the Court of Louis XL, where he learned to be a good Frenchman even if he were a bad Breton. In six years he was a councillor and captain of the Chateau of Blois, and, later on, is sent with Commines to Amiens, where negotiations with England were in progress, to see that nothing contrary to agreement was attempted by the crowd of English soldiers who had come with their ambas sador. But no especial watchfulness was necessary; the Englishmen were found to be all dead drunk.

It is one more proof of his tact that, though a member of the Regent Anne de Beaujeu's council, he could yet remain a firm friend of Louis d'Orleans, calm down the revolts in Brittany, and finally be one of the chief negotiators in the marriage of the Duchess Anne. De Gie was uneasy, and with reason, at the con versation of the Court. The King, who had grown up neglected at Amboise with nothing to occupy his thoughts but the romances of chivalry which Charlotte de Savoie read him, had only been preserved from hazarding his forces sooner by the interruptions of the war in Brittany. But now great movements seemed to be in the air. In the year after his marriage Spain had chased the Moors from Granada, and America was discovered by Columbus. The full effects of the policy of Louis XI. became evident not only in the pursuance of his Italian schemes, but in the strength and consolidation of the royal power which made such attempts possible at all. The invasion of Italy had been a constant dream among Frenchmen, and now, amid the confusion of Europe, France saw her opportunity. The Mussulman"], [209, "LANGEAIS \u25a073 raids from the East had terribly exhausted life and property in Italy; Venice and Naples had even been so mad as to use these dangerous neighbours against each other, and make a Turkish invasion possible. There was danger, too, from the West. Since 1480 Torquemada had made all Spain like one vast furnace of human flesh, and had turned out the Jews to wander over Europe leaving plague and famine in their tracks ; twenty thousand famishing spectres died before the walls of Genoa. Italy herself was filled with prodigies and warnings ; men like Machiavelli, in despair of Divine help, had taken Policy for their god, others were listening to the warnings of Savonarola, or watching the pictures full of the sombre teaching of the grief of Michael Angelo. In the midst of all this the ambition of the young French King, which had been smouldering since thc Venetian embassy in 1484, was fanned into quick flame by the messages of Ludovico Sforza \u2014 France should step in to this distracted Italy, France who alone could understand the message which Italy had to give, who was to make a discovery more powerful in its results than that of Spain beyond the ocean, and to set in motion the two great electric currents ; one, called the Renaissance, setting away from Christianity, the other, called the Reformation, trying to get nearer to it ; the school of Rabelais and Voltaire on the one side, the Puritanism of Luther and of Calvin on the other."], [210, "174 OLD TOURAINE Commines tells the whole story of this ill-advised invasion of Italy \" without generals, without money, with the impromptu army of a moment's whim.\" Let us look closer at this strange company that is crossing the passes of the Alps.

It was a distracted country this Italy through which the stampede of the young French King's army rushed almost unhindered, a country where Leonardo's frescoes and Bellini's Madonnas looked down upon the crimes of Borgias and the ambitions ofthe Medicis ; where the burning words of Savonarola taught the people submission to the scourge of God ; where Capponi roused the burghers to enthusiasm for their new French patron, and opposition to young Piero de Medicis, the mortal enemy of France. But Piero had made no plans for defence and no schemes for alliance, and found himself at last obliged to leave his Florentine palace and his young son Lorenzo (the father of Catherine de Medicis) and meet the French King in his camp. There was a great contrast in the two men : the handsome, graceful Italian, arrogant and proud as he was cruel, and the small, high shouldered Frenchman looking sickly and but half grown up, yet with the bright eyes that promised a kindly, honest nature, and a power over his soldiery that sent them to the death in fighting for his sake."], [212, "176 OLD TOURAINE A third contrast was added by the presence of Ludovico Sforza, who was already beginning to be perplexed at the young King's success, and now found that Charles had completely outwitted the Florentine and secured all the best side of the bargain for Italian lands and money. In November 1494 the French troops were marching through the streets of Pisa, gay with decorations and crowded with a wildly enthusiastic populace, crying \" Libert^, Liberty,\" and casting down the great lion that represented the hated Signorie of Florence from its pillar over the bridge of Arno ; in a few days the King's statue was there in its place ; \" but,\" says Commines, \" they have since done with the King as they did with the lion, for it is the nature of the Italians to do pleasure to the strongest, though these Pisans had received such harsh treat- ment (from Florence) that they may be excused.\" Charles himself was compelled by circumstances stronger than his inclinations to behave with little kindness to this harassed town of Pisa. No sooner had he left the town upon his way to Florence, than the impossibility of his promises became clear \u2014 to support Pisa was to give deadly offence to Florence, for, says Commines, \" Pise leur est plus grande chose que Florence propre, sauf les corps et les meubles.\" But the young King was too much the slave of his first honest impulses to thrive in the land of Machiavelli ; he could not see much farther than"], [213, "LANGEAIS 177 the successes of the present. The whole expedition was equally uncertain in its movements and its aims ; triumphal entries into Naples, Florence, even Rome itself, availed nothing ; the advice of Brigonnet and De Vesc weighed as little with the young King as did the more prudent counsels of Commines or the Marechal de Gie, and when the great league against the French with Venice at its head became a fact accomplished, there was nothing for it but retreat which all but ended in disaster. The army had made another Capua of Naples and delayed the homeward march too long ; it was stayed still further by the attractions of the Pisan ladies, and now Louis d'Orleans was blockaded in Novara. At last they were caught by the enemy at the foot of the Apennines, and death stared them in the face. \" La peur,\" says Commines, \" venait aux plus braves.\" Then De Gie with Jean Jacques Trivulzio and a handful of men took Pontremoli, crossed the steep pass and came down near Fornova close to the enemy, who were camped by the river Taro, swollen with floods. While De Gid with difficulty held his dangerous position between the river and the hill, the French army laboriously climbed the same slopes he had crossed before, and for six days with bleeding hands dragged their cannon and their baggage across the pitiless rocks, in danger all the time of being cut to pieces by the enemy's attack. But the Italians waited ; the Bishop VOL. I N"], [214, "178 OLD TOURAINE of St. Malo and Philippe de Commines tried negotia tions, but they failed, and the fight soon began. The King rode at the head of his troops and showed himself as brave as any of his men, and though fighting one against six the French at last cut their way through with the loss of some two hundred men against four thousand of the enemy. Even then the advice of the more prudent was rejected ; the Breton commanders and St. Malo would not recognise that there was nothing left but an honourable retreat ; it was only the terrible news that kept pouring into the camp from all sides that at last decided Charles to advance towards rest and help at Asti and Turin. A peace was patched up hastily, chiefly through the negotiations of Commines, and the King got back to Lyons, where after two months came the news of the death of the little Dauphin, whose tomb is in the cathedral of Tours. This sorrow seems to have been far more bitterly felt by the mother than by Charles, and Anne's feelings were still further hurt by the ill-restrained joy of Louis d'Orleans, who felt himself a step nearer to the throne of France.1 1 Commines relates how, with a strange idea of lightening the sorrows of the Queen, Charles had in several young courtiers to dance before her, \" et entre les autres y etait le due d'Orleans qui pouvait bien avoir trente quatre ans.\" The duke seems to have put more joy than sympathy into these ill-timed capers.

But before bidding it farewell there is one more memory, a very different one, that cannot but detain a traveller in the land of Rabelais. In 1534 the chronicler of the Heroic Deeds of Pantagruel was in Rome with Du Bellay, and for the next ten years remained under the protection of that house, until the death of Du Bellay, \" Sieur de Langey,\" in 1543.

From this bridge there is one of the finest views, among many, of the sweeping current of the Loire. The forest of Blois, which we had left behind us, just shows above the house-tops, and across the river the towers of the castle rise upon the wooded hill and dominate the little village by the banks.1 1 Evelyn, in 1644, saw this view from another direction scarcely less beautiful. On 2nd May he writes in the Diary: \" We took boate, passing by Charmont {sic), a proud castle on the left hand ; before it is a sweete island deliciously shaded with tall trees.\""], [224, "188 OLD TOURALNE In the time of the early Angevin Counts, Chau mont was one of the outposts of the Counts of Blois towards their enemies' country, and was given to Gelduin, Lord of Saumur, after Foulques Nerra had so suddenly turned him out of his own castle by the famous night attack, which owed its supernatural swiftness \u2014 so men said \u2014 to the help of the devil. The son of this Gelduin was the first of that famous family of D'Amboise which was to give so many celebrated names to the history of France, and the Chateau of Amboise itself seems to have originally formed part of the same estates. But Amboise was too far off from Blois and too near the formidable Counts of Anjou and Touraine to remain in this connection for long ; indeed, it was owing to a reverse in one of the perpetual wars with Henry Plantagenet that the first castle at Chaumont was razed to the ground. It was a few years after the new building had arisen that Henry II. met Thomas a Becket here for the last time before the arch bishop's murder ; and just before it was again completely destroyed there was born here, in 1460, the most famous of his race, Georges, Cardinal d'Amboise. This second destruction was due to the political blunders of Georges' father, Pierre d'Amboise, who, after assisting Louis XI. as Dauphin in the con spiracies of the Praguerie, was so ill-advised as to oppose that astute monarch later on in the rebellion"], [225, "CHAUMONT 189 called the \" War of the Public Weal.\" His punish ment, the destruction of his chateau, suited at once Louis' principles of summary justice and his policy of weakening the nobles on every possible occasion.

There are still the two great towers that guard the entrance, and on the left side towards the river another tower, that binds together the corners of the corps de logis, rises above the line of roofs, and plunges boldly downwards in one sweep ing line through brakes and brambles to the foot of the hill. The whole chateau was originally built by Charles, the brother of the Cardinal, who also held high office in the State, in the form of a quadrangle, but the fourth side towards the river, which existed in 168 1,1 was pulled down by M. de Vaugien, a Parisian magi strate, to whom the domain belonged in 1739.

On the left hand of the entrance gate is the Cardinal's hat and coat-of-arms of Georges d'Amboise, while the porcupine of his master, Louis XII., is on the inside of the wing that joins the entrance towers. The rise to power of the future favourite was rapid and precocious. At fourteen, when the new Chau mont was scarcely risen from its foundations, young D'Amboise was made Bishop of Montauban, and very soon became the almoner of King Louis XI. in a Court where he would have the best of training in the art of holding his tongue and managing politi cal intrigues expeditiously and quietly. Of this sagacity he soon gave proof.

D'Amboise's connection with the Duke of Orleans was judiciously maintained during the whole of Charles VIII.'s reign, and while Louis was governor of Normandy, D'Amboise, as Archbishop of Rouen, was of material assistance in crushing out the brigand age and violence which were rampant at that time in the north of France. Later on, he was with the duke at Asti and Novara, and supported with his patron the charge of malpractices which was again brought against them on their return from Italy. In a short time the Duke of Orleans was Louis XII., and Georges d'Amboise found himself one of the chief supporters of the throne of France. But higher dignities still were to come to D'Am boise from the Italy which had just been somewhat ingloriously left. Amidst the numerous intrigues of the Papal Court, C\u00e6sar Borgia found himself in need of one more dupe, of an instrument by whose means he could influence the powerful Court of France, and whose personal ambition would be served by a closer connection with the politics of Rome ; a Briconnet had already been found,1 another like him was soon forthcoming ; Georges d'Amboise 1 After D'Amboise's death there is yet another French ecclesiastic who is ready to play the same role, the infamous Du Prat, the Chancellor of Louise de Savoie.

An opportunity soon offered itself for the Papal Court to fulfil its promises. The unhappy Jeanne de France had from the first been disliked by her husband, and it only needed the touch of pathos which Scott has supplied in the suggestion of her own unrequited passion, to com plete a picture of distress and misery rarely found in the story of a French princess. Louis XII., when King, was only too glad to add reasons of State to his own personal repugnance, and with singular brutality J to repudiate this faithful and uncomplain ing wife. Jeanne died in 1504 at Bourges, and Anne de Bretagne reigned in her stead. It is not impossible that certain recollections of the young duchess during his campaign in Brittany may have come back to Louis after the death of her first husband had given him the throne ; in any case the care for her own future which the Breton had shown in the marriage settlement at Langeais now had its result. For the second time Anne was a Queen of France, and for the second time the usual businesslike agreement was drawn up as to her own estates and property \u2014 it will be seen that the 1 Jean Bouchet {Panigyrique de la Tremouille) gives a far too flatter ing account of this transaction ; for what actually happened see Pro cedures Politiques du regne de Louis XII. (M. de Maulde), in which is also the Life of the Marechal de Gie\\"], [229, "CHAUMONT 193 strongly-marked characteristics of her earlier years show themselves in a far more decided manner during this second period of her power. Though Anne never really cared for the true interests of France, she was only too glad to join D'Amboise in managing the King, and the bitterness of her disappointment at having no male issue warped her pride and natural tenacity into a fatally misguided policy from which France was only saved by her death. It was in the preliminaries to this royal marriage that Rome began to show her influence with the Court of France. The papal bull necessary for the King's divorce was brought to Chinon by C\u00e6sar Borgia, and the same hand gave Georges d'Amboise his Cardinal's hat. Michelet, describing the statue on the Cardinal's tomb at Rouen, one of the finest monuments of the time in France, calls it a peasant face ; it is certainly no courtier that kneels there in his flowing robes before the carving of his patron saint slaying the dragon, but it is far more than a peasant : a peculiarly square head, with deep, low eyebrows, long upper lip, heavy jaw, and that firm ness of character expressed in every line of bone and muscle which seldom goes with physical beauty, but seldom fails to be impressive. This is no peasant parvenu, no Jean Balue, but a noble from the valley of the Loire, who had but given up the dignities of his own state to please the King whom he had served before the little Dauphin's death had given Orleans a VOL. 1 O"], [230, "OLD TOURALNE 194 throne, the King whose weakness he thoroughly un derstood and vigorously guided, and whose strength, which consisted in a genuine love for the people of France, D'Amboise knew equally well how to direct CARDINAL D'AMBOISE (drawn from the tomb in Rouen Cathedra], carved by Rouland Leroux). into broad schemes of national security and unflinch ing administration of justice.

And if the Cardinal might fairly be reproached with an exaggerated ambition, a great longing for the highest place which the Church had to offer,1 it was an ambition to which even stronger heads than his were to give way \u2014 the patriotism of Wolsey was no more free from the desire for the tiara than were the schemes of the French Cardinal, to whom the Englishman has so often been compared. No other man, say his contemporary critics, was so fitted for the papal throne as Cardinal d'Amboise ; and the help of a countryman in so exalted a position would have been of no slight service to the King of France, who never saw his way clearly through the shifting kaleidoscope of European politics, and came utterly to grief after the Cardinal's death. It is difficult to be severe in judging a king who stands almost alone in his affection for every class of his subjects. Torn in sunder by the disputes of the great barons of Charles VI.'s reign, harassed by the terrible English invasions, with no comprehen sion of the tortuous policy of Louis XL, and no sympathy with the scatterbrained chivalry of his son, the people of France welcomed with a universal 1 There is a medal of this time with the head of the Cardinal on one side and on the other the papal tiara and keys, with the legend \"tulit alter honores.\""], [232, "OLD TOURAINE 196 outburst of gratitude the rest and relief from taxation which this \" Father of his Country \" gave them, a rest which was only to be a brief breathing-space before the renewed restlessness, the extravagant ex penditure of the reign of Francis I. Nor was Louis XII. a King apart, a monarch unseen and unappreciated.1 From his favourite home at Blois he had for long exercised a bene ficent, if somewhat unthinking and indolent, influence over the central populations of the valley of the Loire. The young duke who appears in the high shouldered fur cape with its long squared sleeves, in the round velvet cap that hides the lowness of the forehead and the heavy straight black hair of the portrait in the Gaignieres collection, had grown into a stout, good-humoured, idle King, with full thick lips and heavy cheeks, a King with all the dreami ness of Charles d'Orleans and little of his originality, who could rule respectably and comfortably at home, but must fail hopelessly whenever the quick initiative of foreign expeditions was demanded of him. The young gallants of the Court who had tasted of adventure in the campaigns of Charles VIII. could not rest quiet upon this side of the Alps : the results of C\u00e6sar Borgia's embassy now became evident as well, and probably the schemes of Car dinal d'Amboise in connection with a possible elec tion to the papacy would have been alone sufficient 1 See the panegyric of his reign written by Claude Seyssel."], [233, "CHAUMONT 197 to induce the easy-going King to avenge his ill fortune at Novara and make a fresh attack on Italy. The proceedings of Ludovico il Moro finally decided Louis. The story of the defeat and capture of Sforza has been already told. This first campaign brought much importance to the Cardinal, who, as the representative of the King of France, and surrounded by the Marshal Trivulzio, the Bishop of Lucon, the Seigneur de Grammont, and many other notables, received in solemn state a deputation from the penitent Milanese, who \" with four thousand little children, their heads bared, and clad in humble garments,\" as Jean d'Auton tells us, came in procession to entreat the favour of the Cardinal, who showed them by the mouth of one Michael Ris \" leur deJoyaute damnable, inexcusable trahison et inseparables deTauts,\" and promised them their lives for the present and an examination of their requests for the future ; after which the little children passing before him cried aloud, \" France ! France ! misericorde ! \" A still more picturesque scene followed shortly afterwards at Pisa. For some time this unhappy town had enjoyed \" a hazardous and agonised attempt at liberty,\" while Entragues and the French garrison which came in with Charles VIII.'s army refused to leave the citadel and abandon Pisa to Florence, her bitter enemy ; and now the French envoys, who had been sent with difficult words"], [234, "198 OLD TOURAINE of negotiation concerning the detested Florentine supremacy, were surrounded by \" five or six hun dred \" young girls dressed in white, with two aged dames to lead them, and singing sweetly, ' devant l'image de Notre -Dame commencerent les pucelles a chanter tant piteusement, et de voix si tres lamentables que la n'y eut Francais ni autre a qui du plus profond endroit du c\u0153ur jusqu'aux yeux ne montassent les chaudes larmes.\" With their tears and blandishments they so won the hearts of the rough soldiers that fighting became for the time impossible for mutual admiration ; the influence of women that was to exercise so great a power in France for the next century had begun, and had introduced one more disturbing element into the already confused system of Italian politics. The next campaign was more disastrous for the arms of France, as was indeed only to be expected. The prodigies of valour performed by the Chevalier Bayard at the bridge of the Garigliano, and admir ingly chronicled by the \" Loyal Servitor,\" were not able to avert defeat from La Tremouille at the hands of the capable and politic General Gonsalvo di Cordova. Between C\u00e6sar Borgia and the Catholic King Ferdinand, France had been duped. The Spaniards had been let in by Naples, C\u00e6sar Borgia had conquered the Romagna and taken in even Machia velli, who was to give him immortality. The"], [235, "CHAUMONT 199 tragedies of the Vatican had but produced fresh complications for the French. Alexander VI. was carried a blackened swollen corpse, horribly dead by his own poisons, into St. Peter's, and C\u00e6sar Borgia, almost unconscious and weakened at the very crisis of his fate by a mysteriously similar disorder, was chased out of Italy to die obscurely in a skirmish fighting for John d'Albret in Spain. The tiara had been very near to Georges d'Amboise, and there can unhappily be little doubt that it was his delaying of the French army, for interested motives, within reach of Rome, that hastened the disaster of Garigliano. But a still greater blow to the true interests of France was only just averted at home. The mis guided ambitions of Anne de Bretagne, dangerously strengthened by her Breton pluck and energy, had very nearly succeeded in giving to one man the crowns of France, Spain, Austria, and the Nether lands, in delivering up France to the power that was instinctively and most bitterly opposed to her. Her designs of marrying her daughter Claude to the child who was to become the Emperor Charles V. were most fortunately frustrated by the resolutions of the Estates of Tours. But what little good had been effected by these was soon almost annulled by the blunders of the League of Cambrai. Venice was to be attacked, and Genoa to be humbled for her presumption in turning"], [236, "OLD TOURAINE 200 out the aristocratic party ; money was raised by the disgraceful method of selling the wretched Pisans to their cruel masters in Florence. So ill begun, this third Italian campaign was to continue with steadily increasing ill-success. The new Pope, Julian de la Rovere, who had outwitted Cardinal d'Amboise and firmly established his power in the Vatican and the Romagna, soon turned round and joined Venice against France, and Louis XII. was still further weakened by the death of his old friend and stead fast counsellor, Georges d'Amboise. Though the Cardinal died an immensely wealthy man, he had spent his riches lavishly, and made the best use of his opportunities for the encouragement of art with foreign models and Italian workmen ; but his loss as a statesman was far more severely felt. The good work he had begun in Normandy, \" avec le titre effrayant de reTormateur general,\" he had carried on throughout all the tribunals of France by means of his celebrated \" ordonnances.\" In Italy, with the assistance of his brother Charles, Seigneur de Chaumont, he had invariably upheld the interests of France and guided the uncertain steps of the King through the maze of European politics with a hand that rarely faltered save when his one great fault became conspicuous, his too obvious ambition of the papal power. But it is on his home policy that his fame chiefly rests \u2014 his revision of justice, his measures for averting the famine while the so-called"], [237, "CHAUMONT 201 plague was devastating France, his swift repression of brigandage and violence. His death, which was felt as a relief at the Vatican, was the signal for confusion in the mind of Louis. Austria and England were against him, the Pope had joined Ferdinand and Venice, and Louis felt the necessity of rousing himself to action. A new national infantry was formed by La Palice with a backbone of five thousand Gascons, and the young Gaston de Foix, the last of the house of Armagnac, the direct descendants of Clovis, at its head. The counsels of the veteran Marshal de Gi^ were lost to the King as well at this critical moment. Some years before he had been exiled by a disgraceful process, whose details only serve to throw into stronger light the honour and integrity of a life spent in loyal devotion to his country. Besides all this, Louis was becoming more and more perplexed at the attitude of Margaret of Flanders. At all hazards, her father, Maximilian the Emperor, must be kept on the side of France, so at all hazards a victory must be won. In the terrible day before Ravenna the French advanced between a double row of enemies, while the Spanish cannon \" fired into the French infantry as into a great target, and killed more than two thousand of them before they came to blows.\" The Loyal Servitor and Bayard were fighting with the rest, and some sharp skirmishing followed between"], [238, "202 OLD TOURAINE the cavalry of both sides ; but it was the firm battalions of the newly-organised infantry that won the day for the French after fearful losses upon both sides. Bayard had warned the young Due de Nemours to stay where he was after the battle had been decided, but Gaston saw some Spaniards making for Ravenna, and could not let them go unmolested. Riding out, directly his Gascons had told him of their passage, he attacked them furiously upon a narrow road with a canal on one side and a deep ditch on the other. He was almost alone with his cousin Lautrec, and was soon surrounded. When his charger was hamstrung, \" he leaped down and sword in hand did braver deeds than ever did Roland at Roncevaux,\" and fell with all his wounds in front, and fourteen on his face. Bayard met the Spaniards at the other end of the road, some ten miles on, and not knowing of the death of the brave Gaston de Foix, let them pass safely on their way. The tide of fortune had completely turned against the French, and round the same Novara which had seen so many crises of this unlucky war, La Tre mouille was defeated and Italy was lost. But the quarrel over Milan, Naples, and Sicily was not yet fought out : Francis of Angouleme, the descendant of Valentine Visconti, claimed Milan because he was the heir to France by rights that were impregnable, until they were for ever lost at Pavia. The son of Francis, when he became Dauphin, missed one"], [239, "CHAUMONT 203 more chance of Milan, and the husband of Catherine de Medicis lost all hope of an Italian kingdom, which ended by being fast held by the Spaniards. The crown of the two Sicilies, which was first held by the descendants of the Norman Robert Guiscard, had been claimed by the house of Hohen staufen, and was in 1254 given by the Pope, who somewhat feared such strong neighbours, to the brother of Saint Louis, Charles d'Anjou. The quarrel that inevitably resulted was handed on through Louis XL, to whom Rene d'Anjou bequeathed his rights, to the Kings of France and even, through the house of Lorraine, to the Guises, who actually revived the old title, which had belonged to Anjou, of King of Jeru salem.1 The new desire of national aggrandisement was joined to the fatal spirit of adventure, without losing the old religious ideal that had given nothing but a visionary basis to the policy of France, and uselessly wasted much French blood and treasure ; the Sicilian Vespers were not redeemed by Marignano, and after the reign of Louis XII. the story of the French in Italy 2 closes in the defeat of Pavia and the excesses of the Constable Bourbon. In 1513 died the Queen, Anne de Bretagne, at Blois. Fleurange and the Loyal Servitor describe the distress of Louis at the loss of her, but besides the 1 Creighton's Papacy. 2 \"The story,\" that is, of the French in the period covered by these chapters, but it was not until the days of Napoleon that it was renewed."], [240, "OLD TOURAINE 204 King, and the poor whom she had assisted with her alms, there were not many to whom her death should have been a serious loss.1 Louis seemed more bewildered than ever in his attempts to distinguish the right path in the \" danse Macabre \" of European politics that followed. At last, amid the general quarrelling Henry VIII. of England gave Mary Tudor to be wife of the French King \u2014 a strong young Englishwoman, who killed off Louis within a year. There would be something ludicrous, if it were not pathetic, in the last months of this weak, easy - going King ; he evidently was quite at a loss how to manage the young princess, and brought up his daughter Claude, Louise de Savoie, even old Anne de Beaujeu, to try and help him humour her. \" He had been used to dine at eight in the morn ing, now he dined at noon ; his habit was to go to bed at six, and now he was often up till midnight,\" with the inevitable result of a serious illness which killed him by New Year's Day.

But the Duchesse de Valentinois preferred Anet and the statue of Jean Goujon to Chaumont and the memories of Cardinal d'Amboise, so she too hardly visited the castle at all, and Chaumont for the next two centuries continually changed hands. In 1739 Italy was again predominant, and the chimneys built by M. le Ray were smoking with the furnaces that baked the pottery and medallions of the Italian Nini.

At Amboise we shall meet the young duke growing between the evil angel and the good, his mother and his sister Margaret ; there, too, beside the grave of the greatest of the Italians whom he favoured, we shall be able to appreciate his claims to praise as an art patron ; but at none of the many chateaux of Touraine, where his influence is so conspicuous, can we catch a glimpse of Francis clear enough to serve as guide in judging of his character or of the value of his reign ; not even at Chambord, that grotesque giant of the royal pleasure-houses, the Chambord which Brantome saw even in his time but half- achieved, shall we find more than an indication of his reckless expenditure and unmeaning lavishness in the strange labyrinths of stone upon its roof, or a trace of the only lesson he could draw from the intrigues of a misspent existence in the cynical distich traced by his diamond ring upon the lost window-pane of his cabinet. The delicate perfection of the staircase in the wing at Blois, by which the buildings of Louis XII. 1 \" Le grand garcon qui gatera tout,\" as Louis called him."], [249, "REIGN OF FRANCIS I. 213 were completed in the reign of Francis, remains to show that something better than Chambord was within the compass of French art, and possibly indicates that by the good taste of his wife Claude, who loved her old home in her father's favourite chateau, the strong and true instinct of the national school found more support than in the dilettante passion of Francis for the teaching of Florence and of Rome. Yet so full is this Loire valley of the memory and the praise of Francis that we must stop for a while, before wandering farther along the river's banks, to take some measure of this prince's worth, and to look closer at his gentle, mystical sister, Marguerite d'Angouleme, Queen of Navarre. Upon their mother we have fortunately no need to dwell ; in the most iniquitous trial of the reign, in the most horrible siege of that lawless generation, we shall see traces enough of the meanness of Louise de Savoie and the misgovernment of her despicable favourite the Chancellor Du Prat. The character of Francis does not gain by a close inspection ; and in this he is not unlike one of our own kings, Richard, son of the great Plantagenet, who figured as the perfect Paladin of ancient chivalry in many a poem and romance, who wasted English blood and treasure on visionary and useless expedi tions, who only used his country, for the few months he ever spent in it, as a means of raising fresh"], [250, "OLD TOURAINE 214 supplies, and died at last fighting for an ignoble cause in an almost unknown corner of his French dominions. It is much the same with this Amadis of a later Gaul, who took the Salamander for his device, but came out anything but unscathed from the furnace of his destiny.

And this is obvious from a consideration of the way in which he met the two great influences with which his reign was brought in contact, the policy of the Emperor from without, the rising forces of the Reformation from within. \" The Emperor tries in everything to do the very reverse of what I do,\" he complains to the Venetian ambassador Capello,1 and a peevish sense of opposition, a small personal rivalry, is all that Francis saw in the famous struggle with Charles V. in which he failed, as he was bound to fail, in matching the puerile and unreasoning passion of a fantastic chivalry against the cold personification of an idea which made up the sombre character of Charles V.

Strange ideas of mysticism, of theocracy, mingle in this prematurely aged mind, and show themselves early in the subtlety and skill of the practised politician. Losing the penetrating influence that comes of human sympathy, he found nothing but the dogma of authority left to guide him in the rigid and indifferent system of a policy implacable as fate. Within three years Charles V. had conquered Monte zuma in Mexico, and taken Francis prisoner at Pavia, yet against so redoubtable a foe the French King could only produce a fluctuating policy of ill-planned sieges and cartels of defiance. Accepting bravely, and with a full understanding, the position of opponent to the Emperor, Francis might have joined in one irresistible league the many forces antagonistic to the powers and aims of Spain and Austria, have secured the co-operation of England and the northern provinces of Germany, and offered a compact and invincible resistance to the scattered armies of the Empire ; but this he never realised, 1 Coignet, Fin de la vieille France [de Vieilleville], cap. xix."], [252, "216 OLD TOURALNE scarcely attempted.

The mistakes of Francis beyond the boundaries of his kingdom were not redeemed by any benefits conferred upon the populace within, and to the second of the two influences of his reign which were just mentioned Francis gives no more enlightened comprehension than to the first. If Francis had encouraged the reform at all, it was only with the uncertain favour of a royal patron of research and letters ; the sympathies of his sister with Calvin or with Marot had a deeper strain in them that was foreign to his nature. \" Ne parlons point de celle-la, elie m'aime trop,\" he says to Mont morency, with a selfish satisfaction in her love for him that obscured any appreciation of the doctrines which she favoured.

The Spanish marriage laid France open to the sombre and cruel fanaticism of Philip 1 1., and the ruin was completed by the insatiable ambition, the astounding audacity of the Guises, favoured by the protection of their niece, Marie Stuart, on the throne of France ; the weakness, the irresolution, the lying spirit of Catherine de Medicis abandoned the nation first to one party and then to the other, and ended in never forming a national party at all.1 The reign of Francis opened characteristically with a magnificent expedition. \" Madame,\" he writes to Louise de Savoie, who was left at home as Regent, \" nous sommes dans le plus etrange pays ou jamais fut homme de cette compagnie.\" One more expedi tion to Italy was starting with all the brilliancy of which the chivalry of France was capable.

Yet one of the greatest of these same Churchmen might have been of service to Francis now, for he never learnt the lesson which it took a Richelieu to enforce, that France was stronger at home, and relying on her natural wealth and her unequalled situation, than she could ever be abroad. And now the greatest of Francis' opportunities was to come and go. With all the prestige of his Italian campaign, with the borrowed lustre of his supposed protectorate of art and the Renaissance, Francis might well have posed as the champion of Europe against the encroaching powers of Spain and Austria, might well have carried the election against the silent and almost unknown Charles.

The one chance that presented itself of crushing the Imperialists and even Charles himself was lost, and Lautrec was ignominiously beaten. This last officer was received but coldly by the King on his return, for Francis was sore at the loss of the coveted duchy of Milan ; but Lautrec stoutly answered that the whole fault lay with his Majesty, who had been warned several times that without more money2 Milan would be lost.

Georges d'Amboise performed the ceremony of betrothal. Michelet has pointed out the mistake made by a daughter of Louis XI. in thus concentrating in the bold and reckless person of the young duke such vast feudal posses sions.1 A few years after his marriage we find the duke with Louis XII. before Genoa, and with an important command at Milan ; later on he is with young Gaston de Foix at Ravenna, and is made Constable of France by Francis. At Mari gnano he is in the vanguard of the army, which had already owed so much to his care and guidance in the passes of the Alps, and in 1517 the King himself assists at the magnificent baptismal fetes of the duke's son and heir at Montlieu. But Bourbon had already reached the summit of his fortunes, and a change was at hand.

Misfortunes followed thick and fast. All his three children died, and were followed by their mother to the tomb. This was the moment for Louise de Savoie to appear. She immediately laid claim to all the lands of the Constable that had come to him through Suzanne de Bourbon, as being the nearer relation of the two ; and an even more odious motive for her hatred soon became apparent. Reckless in her desires as she was unprincipled in action, Louise had conceived for the Constable a passion which was repulsed with all the aversion and disdain it merited. This added the most poignant motive to her spite. By the machinations of her creatures, Du Prat, Poyet, and the Advocate-General Lizet, she at length drove the Constable in sheer despair into treason and exile. Some of his accom plices we have already met with in the dungeons of Loches. Bourbon himself, his plots against the throne discovered, fled out of France,1 and threw himself under the protection of the Emperor, who was but too glad to receive so welcome an ally. The sequel is worthy of so terrible a beginning, and the tragedy of his life ended in the sack of Rome. After two such disasters within his kingdom the fortunes of Francis fared no better abroad.

At last the impatient royal prisoner was released, and galloped across the frontier to Bayonne, leav ing his children in his stead as pledge for the extravagant promises which he had only made to break. The country was sadly in need of guiding and of government, but Francis' first thought is to escape the serious tasks of business and the toil of State affairs, and to compensate himself for the imprisonment that had already undermined his strength, by fresh luxury and excitement among the ladies of his Court.

But Francis, blind as ever to the true issues of a consistent policy, and always prone to let his passion for Italy prove a besetting snare, betrothed his second son to Catherine, the last of the house of the famous Cosmo de Medicis.

Already Geneva, in 1536, began to be troubled with insurrections, and the Eidgenossen of the Huguenots were forming with the watchwords of their teacher Calvin. The King himself had openly given up all pretence of championing their cause, and joined the Spanish party of Montmorency and the Dauphin. A strange result of this changed policy was the visit of the Emperor to France \u2014 we shall hear of him at Amboise and elsewhere \u2014 but it ended in nothing better than the disgrace of the Constable when the futility of all attempts at reconciliation became evident after Charles had returned.

Amid the quarrels of his mistresses, the disputes of his old friends, with all his grief for the death of his eldest son, and his annoyance at the attitude of the Dauphin, who between his Italian wife and the cold counsels of Diane de Poitiers seemed completely estranged from the sympathy of his father, Francis feverishly wore out the last days of his existence : some solace, some consolation, indeed, was given him by the presence of his sister Marguerite, who tries tenderly to amuse him at Chambord with her conversation, to write him stories in her Heptameron ; but he cannot rest. He hurries through Touraine from one hunting-seat to another, striving to forget his pain of body and distress of mind in violent exercise, but must needs stop at last for very agony at Rambouillet, and there die. In spite of all his faults and failures Francis has always exercised a strange fascination over his country men. \" If he was not a great King,\" writes one, \" he was at any rate a great man.\" \" Regulus, it is true, was more virtuous,\" says another ; \" let men like Regulus condemn him.\" Brantome and Du Bellay are full of his praises, and they have been echoed by their compatriots ever since.

In the reign of Francis the effect of many great discoveries first began to be felt. The discovery of America had created a revolution in commerce, had cheapened the precious metals, had created capitalists ; the route round the Cape of Good Hope had enlarged the boundaries of trade ; the wars across the Alps had led men's minds to Italy, that old enchantress with \" the fatal gift of beauty \" even in the years of her decay, a: id with an added interest from the stores of classical research just opened to the world of scholarship and thought.

And it is with this intellectual part of the move ment of reform that Marguerite of Navarre is especially associated, though she had been obliged to hide her sympathies from her brother ; and now that he was dead the light seemed to have gone out of her life. Her oldest friends had left her or were dead, and in her contemplative seclusion at Nerac she quietly and sadly lived her last years, conversing with Montluc, Bishop of Valence, with Lefebvre datable, librarian of Blois, writing to Amyot, the professor of the university at Bourges, or exchanging graceful fancies with her poet Marot. \" Hers was a mind,\" says Michelet, \" delicate, swift, subtle, which fluttered over everything, lighted on everything, and scarcely went beneath the surface.\" And Rabelais, too, with a keen appreciation of her character, writes in his dedication \u2014 \" Esprit abstrait ravy et ecstatic, Qui frequentait les cieux son origine.

One more thing, that is but another reflection of the temper of the times, is very noticeable in this autobiography : there is a great contempt for human life, a hideous familiarity with death that shows itself again and again in what that century has left for us to see and pity.

It bears the initials of Thomas Bohier and Catherine Brigonnet his wife, upon the beautifully carved doorway at its base, and is crowned by a huge extinguisher of slate, while the lines of its sides are gracefully relieved by a smaller turret clinging to its walls, whose pointed top breaks the outline of the larger roof. Immediately to the left of this is the great drawbridge leading to a strong circular stone pier rising out of the waters of the Cher ; then begins the main building of the chateau, that fairy-like construction which owed its birth to Catherine Brigonnet. In early times a Roman villa seems to have stood upon this site, too lovely to be left long without an occupant. The vine-lands slope down softly to the river's edge, and the trees and foliage round the water help to make an exquisite natural setting for one of the most beautiful dwellings ever fashioned by the art of man.

Jean Marques had sided with the English against the son of Charles VI., and by his traitorous adher ence to the invaders caused so much annoyance that the town of Tours summoned Du Guesclin to come to the assistance of the province. Close by the castle he defeated the English, razed the fortifications of the place, and cut down its woods \" a l'hauteur de l'infamie,\" as a punishment for the unpatriotic behaviour of their owner. In 1432 a second Jean got letters-patent from Charles VII. for raising the outworks again, and rebuilding the donjon, and in the next year the moats were dug and the corner tower built. Jean died in 1460, heavily in debt, and Pierre, with an equal disregard of the first principles of finance, bought land and built on it until the family was ruined and the estate heavily mortgaged. Such was the state of Chenonceaux when Catherine Brigonnet came to transform it. The feudal castles were gradually decaying, and the power of the Bour geois that rose with the rising of the Renaissance was represented by her husband, Thomas Bohier. The main buildings of the older pile she entirely demolished, except the one tower which still stands in the corner of the raised courtyard before the main door of the chateau.

Mrs. Mark Pattison, whose notes on the architecture of Touraine gracefully supply so much that is want ing in the more serious treatises of Viollet le Due or Petit, considers that the plans of Chenonceaux may be ascribed to the same Pierre le Nepveu dit Trinqueau who is responsible later on for the gigantic courts of Chambord : if so, the earlier building gains immensely from the greater restraint and refinement of the artist's handling, while it loses nothing of that wild spirit of invention which is the characteristic of a transitional period in which men feel their way towards constructive change, \" not daring to touch essential features, but tentatively busy on the transformations and adaptations of minor details.\" The Renaissance had a far earlier origin in France than is usually given to it ; the definite"], [283, "CHENONCEAUX 247 fixing of any limits to a period of change is always dangerous, often impossible.

What was needed was not the foreign arts of Primaticcio,1 but a firm national government at home, which was ensured by peace and signalised by the rise of the master masons and the builders of the great cathedrals. There were many pilgrimages to the Holy Sepulchre before the first Crusade, and so it was because the fifteenth century dreamed of Italy that the sixteenth went there, and found instead of free development the bondage that ensued from fuller knowledge. But of this first pure dream, this earlier time of reawakening and national strength 2 unfettered by Italian schools, Azay-le-Rideau and Chenonceaux remain among the most perfect examples. \" Tourelles break out from the massive walls at points where they cease to suggest the flanking 1 See the article on Chenonceaux, by M.

With many of Thomas Bohicr's relations we have already become acquainted. He was, for instance, a connection of the Chancellor Du Prat, a son-in-law of Cardinal Brigonnet, a nephew of Jacques de Beaune Semblangay, and he held the post of General of the Finances in Normandy ; he was one of the great financiers who were in many ways the precursors of 1 Mrs. Mark Pattison, Renaissance of Art in France, cap. ii.

For some time Semblangay had been buying lands for Bohier all round the embarrassed estates of the Marques family, who, after much struggling to keep their old home, were finally bought out in 1499 with certain legal restrictions and feudal com plications still unsettled. For seven years more Bohier continued to buy up land in all directions, until at last he was able to become the sole pos sessor of Chenonceaux, bidding against the \" grand maitre des arbaletriers de France.\" But the Crown had something to say in the acquisition of this coveted estate, and Bohier, after spending 26,812 livres on the place, was made to pay further sums as compensation for taking up certain royal privileges ; but more and more land on all sides was bought up, and the reconstruction of the chateau was begun, of which Bohier himself was never to see the comple tion. His position at this time gave him immense power and control over the revenues of the kingdom, and his proud motto, \" S'il vient a point me sou viendra,\" seemed almost justified, when in 1 5 2 1 he went with Lautrec as Treasurer -General on the"], [286, "OLD TOUR ALNE 250 Italian expedition. In the affair of the loss of the King's money already explained, Bohier paid the soldiers out of his own pocket, and was made Lieu tenant-General. He died in 1524, at Vigelli, in the same retreat in which Bayard perished, and his uncle Semblangay, at the age of eighty-two, was hanged at Montfaucon to save the tarnished honour of Louise de Savoie. The magnificent preparations of Chenonceaux had a sad ending enough. Perhaps it would have been possible for a scion of a royal house only, or an official in such high position as that of Thomas Bohier, to have done what he did for his chateau ; but whether his immense wealth was all got honestly or not, he seems to have left but little comfort behind him, for Catherine Brigonnet died but two years afterwards, and his son's days were early embittered by the harassing task of trying to square the confused accounts of his father. The rest of Antoine's life was made up of financial quibbles and questionable arrangements, which throw a strange light on the business honesty of the times, and explain much of the after history of Chenonceaux.1 1 De Tocqueville explains very forcibly the distressing position of these \"Surintendants de Finance,\" who from Marigny to Necker were between the devil and the deep sea. \"La produit des taxes si mal reparties avait des limites, et les besoins des princes n'en avaient plus.

He was for given the rest by Francis I., \" en bonne foi et parole de roi,\" and for the present seemed quit of the whole unpleasant business. Chenonceaux had become a Crown domain, and a series of royal visits soon began. Now Francis often came over from his Court at Plessis-lez- Tours, with Eleanor of Austria or the Duchesse d'Etampes, and loitering behind the hunting party rode the young Dauphin talking to the ever-juvenile Diana. The glimpses of gaiety which came ever and again to Chenonceaux during this reign, after the death of Francis grew in good earnest into that splendour and magnificence of which they were but the promise, and which never left it till the death of Catherine de Medicis.

The pretext of the gift consisted in the valuable services rendered to the State by her husband Louis de Br^zd, Grand Seneschal of Normandy, services which it had remained for Henry II. to discover and reward. She was given all rights implied in the domain, and at Paris, at Tours, and at Amboise the deeds of gift were signed and countersigned. But Diana did not yet feel safe. At the very outset of our acquaintance with her we shall find her fair fame tarnished with the intrigues and chicanery of a lawsuit, which had for its sole object the possession of a firm and inalienable right to the lands of Chenonceaux, to oppose to the inevitable objec tions of the envious Queen. Nor does this trait in her character appear fortuitously ; to the very end Diana appears cold and hard. In the great famine of 1557 she gave no alms away to her starving tenants. Throughout her life she grasped at every chance of riches and preferment, and let very little slip. This strange process now began. The inalien ability of Crown property being still a question of some uncertainty, Diana determined to go back to the crisis ofthe unhappy Antoine Bohier's fate, the 28th of May 1535, to say that his calculations had been grossly exaggerated, and to completely annul the contract which had received the formal assent of the"], [289, "CHENONCEAUX 253 last King. But this was not all : the ill-used Bohier was then to be reinstated in a sarcastic mockery of ownership, and the balance of his old debt rigorously demanded ; he would then inevitably be declared bankrupt, his lands put up for auction, all other bidders, even the Seigneur de Rochecorbon, con quered by the invincible favourite, and Diana should at last become the legal owner with incontestable rights. All this was done : the wretched General of Finances was crushed in every court of law, and though a Gentleman of the Royal Chamber, a Privy Councillor, and Lieutenant-General of Touraine, he was obliged to fly to Venice ; the curse of his high office was upon him. Of the twelve men who had held this post since Marigny in 1315, eight had died violent deaths, three had been ruined, Florimond Robertet alone under Charles VIII. and Louis XII. had been unmolested and died quietly. Nor did the history of Bohier's own family contain much that was encouraging: Semblangay had been sacrificed, his wife's uncle, Jean Poucher, had been unjustly hanged, his cousin, Gilles Berthelot, had been exiled, and Azay le-Rideau suffered the same fate as Chenonceaux.1 1 The covetous and grasping Louise de Savoie was peculiarly hostile to the financiers. In the first years of her son's reign she writes : \" Sans y pouvoir donner provision, mon fils et moi feusmes continuelle ment desrobes par les gens de finances;\" and again, in 1518, \"en Novembre le moine rouge, Anthoine Boys (Cardinal Bohier), parent de nostre reverendissime chancelier et des inextricables sacrificateurs de finances, alia de repos en travail hors de ce monde ; et lors fut faict une fricassee d'abbayes, selon la folle ambition de plusieurs papes.\""], [290, "OLD TOURAINE 254 So Antoine Bohier fled, seeing no other alter native, but the parody of justice went on, adhering with a rigorous irony to all its forms. He let all its judgments go against him by default, until Diana had finally secured her Naboth's vineyard at (it is pleasing to notice) a considerably heightened price, until his famous balance had been for the second time forgiven, and he could return bearing with him the mockery of a forced approval and a heavy heart to begin life afresh.

It is a pale, untroubled face, with waving bands of raven hair above a brow of brilliant white, a face that will not easily grow old, for it has never suffered from emotion, that has outshone the painted counte nances of all other beauties at the Court by the use of no other drugs than indifference and cold water.2 1 It is certain that De l'Orme was at Chenonceaux in 1556 at any rate. He was disgraced three years afterwards, and in 1565 appeared his Livre tT Architecture, some time before Du Cerceau's more famous account of the Plus Excellents Bastiments de France. 2 See Brantome (ii. 395), who saw her in her old age, \"aussy belle de face, aussy fraische, aussy aymable comme a l'aage de trcnte ans.\""], [291, "CHENONCEAUX 255 Diana, born in 1499, was the daughter of Saint Vallier, whose plots with the Constable had been punished by imprisonment at Loches.

For fifteen years the heat of the Rhone blood within her veins was tempered by her life in Normandy among the lawsuits and processes of her husband ; her only appearance in the larger world was in con nection with Saint Vallier's release, for the story of her amours with Francis I. was the invention of a scandalous Court and nothing more.1 She remained unheard of till her husband's death, and then came quietly to Court with her two girls to marry, and the reputation of an impregnable widow.

She quietly and surely makes her way into the very depths of the Dauphin's affections, marries her daughters into the powerful families of Lamarck and Guise, and with yet more astounding subtlety of penetration wards off the possible opposi tion of Catherine de Medicis, by actually reconciling her disdainful husband to her presence, encouraging the backward Henry in his duties, and even watch ing over the sickbed of the mother and the cradles of her children. Her liaison with Henry x was not to be reproached with jealousy at any rate, for she had recognised only too keenly the necessities of her own position, and of the politics of the time : the only two friendships which the Dauphin had permitted himself before Diana had appeared were with Montmorency and with his brilliant play fellow, Saint Andre : both were very shortly firm friends of Diana.2 In the last years of Francis, 1 To the very end she persisted in representing it as nothing more than a Platonic friendship. 2 In the Bibl.

Catherine attacked the situation with her characteristic methods.

The Cardinal de Lorraine was at this time filling the role of Georges d'Amboise and Brigonnet, and a fresh conquest of Italy was at tempted by way of diversion, but it failed as usual, and the Cardinal only succeeded in making an enemy of his ancient benefactress, Diana, who was strong in the support of Montmorency the Con stable. Yet another mistress was produced to tempt the heart of royalty to fresh distractions, one Nicole de Versigny, who was to reproduce in later genera tions the intrigues and chicanery of Henry's Court, in the person of that Jeanne de Saint Remy who"], [302, "OLD TOURAINE 266 should give such unpleasant notoriety to a land holder in Touraine, \" the mud volcano \" Cardinal de Rohan, the unwilling hero of the diamond necklace.

But of all this Chenonceaux knew nothing, and before leaving the troubles and the tortures of this mistaken reign we must turn, by way of contrast, to watch the life of the Court in this palace by the Cher, before Diana's light is put out and a new mistress comes to take her dwelling-place. 1 For accounts of the movement by contemporary writers see Pierre de la Place, Etat de la Religion et de la Republique, also D'Aubigne's Martyrologie, and the writings of the Bourgeois de Paris, in MS. in the Bibl. Nat., fonds du Puy, No. 742, from 1515 to 1536, and pub lished by M. Lalaune.
