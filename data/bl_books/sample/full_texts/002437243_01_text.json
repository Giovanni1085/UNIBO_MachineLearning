This book sprang out of certain inquiries into the early life of Martin Luther, which the author was desirous of instituting, and for the due prosecution of which it was necessary to visit the principal Lutheran localities \u2014 those romantic scenes in the stirring drama of the Reformation. A few of these will be found described in the following pages : such as the Luther-village of Mohra, on the border of the Thuringian forest (the home of the Luthers, from time out of mind, even down to the present day); as well as the Luther-city of Eisenach, the capital of Thuringia, where the Reformer was twice rescued from destruction : first, from perishing by hunger, when he was a little mendicant choir-boy, singing in the streets there for \" bread for the love of God ; \" and, secondly, from immolation at the stake, when he was a \" heretic monk,\" pursued by the sacri ficial priests of Rome. Eor the same asylum as Martin found in the Cotta-House at Eisenach, in the obscurity of his youth, the castle of the Wartburg there, afforded him in the perilous pride of his after life ; and the same guardian angel as Ursula Cotta was to a 2"], [14, "FREFACE.

The tools of a literary man, who objects to manu facture his original works out of the matter-of-fact stores of his bookshelves, do not require a very large carpet-bag for exportation. So, with a pint bottle of Stephens' Writing Fluid, and a gross of Gillott's broad-nibbed pens, we were off and ready for work in the forest-land of Thuringia. Protracted residence in the country, however, afforded us an opportunity of studying the manners and social condition of the people among whom we had pitched our tent ; and, as we had paid some little attention to the state of the poorer classes in our own land, we could not help contrasting the misery and squalor whicli we found to prevail on every side in Saxony, with the comparative comfort and decency of folk in the same grade of life in England. Accord in gly, on setting about our task, we discovered that the book which we had originally designed was as suming, literally and involuntarily, a pre-posterous form ; for the Luther matter wliich we, at the outset, had intended should be the first, was becoming the last, subject \u2014 or rather one of minor importance \u2014 in our consideration.

Hence, our scheme had to be entirely remodelled ; a new ground-plan was required for the different kind of structure we were about to rear ; and fresh stories designed, instead of the tales we had originally in tended to tell. We discovered, in fact, that we could avail ourselves only of the foundation of the old build ing, and that merely as the underground portion of the new one. The \" columns,\" therefore, which we had already finished were treated as rubbish, and \" shot \" into that limbo for the still-born babes of the brain \u2014 the waste-paper basket ; while the design was changed from that \" rococo\" mixture of the old and the new, into which the style had unwittingly passed, to the pure and severe Saxon ; or, in other words, our Luther tour-book ultimately merged into one mainly descrip tive of the wretchedness of the life of the people in Saxony at the present time.

It should be borne in mind, however, that the great body of the English people are neither Shakespeares nor Bacons \u2014 that these are simply ab normal varieties, by which it is almost impossible to judge of the type of the ordinary species. Moreover, we should add, that, in order to avoid the error ot drawing conclusions from extreme cases, our opinions, as to the social, moral, and intellectual status of the German folk, have been derived, chiefly, from the more enlightened and refined portion of the middle classes : such as professors, government officials, and professional men in general.

Nor is it possible to make continental people com prehend the social and moral enormities that offend English families directly they set foot on foreign soil. We smile when we read in the diary of Mr. Pepys, the courtier in the reign of King Charles II. , how on such a day the astute old lawyer \" did get his maid Betty to comb him,\" wliich, he naively tells us, \" she had not done for many a week before ; whereby,\" he adds, \" I did become mightily uneasy of late, so that oftentimes, to my great vexation, I would fain have scratched myself before company.\" And the reason of our smiling at such quaint confessions is on account of the utter in congruity between the past and present forms of polite life.

There is an inner life pervading the heart of England, graced with home feelings and affections, which makes our national character, in a measure, a sealed book to foreigners. On the Continent, how ever, all is external existence and outward display ; people live out of doors, and wear their hearts on their sleeves, as Hamlet says ; whilst they are for ever throwing back their coats and tapping at their bosoms \u2014 like vintners do at half-empty wine-casks \u2014 to give you a notion of how much there is in them.

In a word, a new power has been developed among us : a means of diffusing knowledge among every class of the people as vast as the very invention of the alphabet, or even of movable types \u2014 a moral court of judicature, where the public acts of our leading men are daily tried ; ay, and let us add, in all conscience (though we ourselves belong to the fraternity), tried, too, by judges as honourable, fair, and upright, as those men of iron integrity, our legal barons themselves. Consequently, where no such social and political machinery exists as a free and enlightened press, it is but natural that we should find society in the same corrupt state as it was with us a hundred years ago : and such we honestly believe is the condition of Germany at the present time \u2014 of Germany, the in ventor not only of printing, but of the steam press too ; and yet whose journals reniair no bigger, and hardly better-informed, or better printed, than \" last dying speeches and confessions \" in our country."], [21, "CONTENTS.

Linen-drapers and apothecaries, \u2014 those twin child ren of luxury, begotten by the astute love of having one's daughters, as well as one's dinners, richly dressed, \u2014 -have long since disappeared from the thoroughfares during our journey ; and now (for we write this description in Mohra itself), the principal b 2"], [26, "4 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. hotel in the place has no greater delicacy in its larder than black puddings\u2014 or \"red sausages\" as the Germans style them\u2014 and black bread, with a chopin or two of \" einf aches,\" (or literally, infmitesimally small) beer, for the regalement of the traveller. But whereabouts is this Mohra? \u2014 this primeval home, whither crinolines and dinner-pills have not yet made their way \u2014 this land of ox-wagons, rather than locomotives, where the ladies wear truncated black-silk extinguishers, in the place of \" sailors' hats \" and the gentlemen incase their feet in Hohjtan toff ein (wooden slippers), instead of \" patent leathers.\" Where on the earth is this little Arcadian colony to be found? Search the best map of Germany, and even with the strongest magnifying glass you will not discover the name of the locality ; Murray, too, is \" reticent \" (to adopt the pet phrase of modern litterateurs) on the subject ; and even the guide-books, specially descrip tive of the topography of Thuringia, tell you only that, as you walk over from Eisenach to \" Bad Liebenstein'd you can just see, when a little way beyond Etterwinden, the church-steeple to the right bristling above the horizon. What may be the precise latitude and longitude of the \" Bbrfchen \" (literally Thorpkin) bearing the name of Mohra, Heaven and Sir John Herschel only know. Suffice it to learn that it lies on the borders of Saxe- Meiningen, close to Saxe-Weimar, not above an hour or two from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, and, indeed, in the immediate vicinity of Saxe-Everything. For, in these"], [27, "THE LUTHER VILLAGE. 5 parts, kingdoms are as closely packed as parishes in the city of London, and princes swarm as thickly as beadles about St. Paul's on the Anniversary of the Sons of the Clergy. Accordingly, when midway between Marksuhl and Salzungen (as the railway whisks us through the Thuringian forest from Eisenach to Meiningen), the watchful eye may \"sight\" the little village, consisting of about as many houses as there are in a child's box of toys, with the cottages huddled together under the lee of the hills, \u2014 like a flock of sheep in a storm \u2014 and lying far away on the moors (der Moorgrund) from which the townikin, or city cule, or boroughlet, or wick-ling, (whichever you please, dear reader) is said to derive its name.* The village itself is about the same size and shape * There are three ways of reaching Mohra from Eisenach : \u2014 1. By rail from Eisenach to Marksuhl or Salzungen, from either of which towns Mohra is but an hour's walk. To stop at Marksuhl, however, shortens the journey by rail and lessens the expense ; but, on the other hand, the road thence to Mohra is not so good ; neither, if one wish to ride, can conveyances be so readily obtained as at Salzungen. The railw*ay fare to Marksuhl is about 10{d. (second-class), that to Salzungen about Is. 9d. (also second-class), and the time occupied by the journey is twenty minutes to the one place, and forty minutes to the other. 2. By \" extra-post \" from Eisenach vid the Hohe Sonne, Wilhelmsthal, Etterwinden, and Waldfisch. This journey takes about three hours, and the cost of the \"post-wagon\" is three thalers (9s.), besides some fifteen groschens (Is. Gd.) for drink-money to the driver. 3. On foot, by Unkerode, Wolfsburg, Eckhardtshausen and Kupfersuhl. The distance is about nine or ten English miles, but the road is good enough in fine weather, and the journey somewhat interesting to those of a geological turn, as affording the traveller an insight into the character of the old copper-slate mines at the last-named place."], [28, "6 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. as the tongue-like block of buildings dividing the Strand from Holywell Street, and consists of some seventy or eighty detached houses (mostly with large farmyards adjoining them) arranged in two long parallel lines, called respectively the Upper and Under Lanes. It contains about as many distinct families as there are houses, and numbers altogether just upon six times as many inhabitants as families, or not quite 500 men, women, and children; so that the whole population might be comfortably stowed away in a middling-sized garrison, a factory, an emigrant ship, or even the gallery of the Victoria Theatre. Indeed, the little church, whose nave is hardly bigger than one of our large furniture vans, affords ample accom modation for all the church-goers, even though none but the very little children stay away. The people here are mostly Acker-baucrn (literally acre-peasants) and day-labourers (Tage-lohner), and possess altogether, among them, some 4000 acres of land ; for such is the extent of the \" Gemeinde\" i. e. of the entire landed property belonging to the little com munity. Now this would give an average of about half a hundred acres to each of the four-score families located in the village. Some, however, have as many as 150 and even 200 acres, and many, on the other hand, only one;* while, owing to the law of \" Gavelkiud\" * The rent of the land about Mohra is from twelve to thirteen gulden (24s. to 20s.) per acre yearly. To buy the acre outright, however, costs between 200 and 300 gulden (\u00a320 and \u00a330).

Hence the large farms in Mohra are merely an aggregation of petty ones, made up of an infinite variety of small patches, like a beggar's coat ; and what would go far to constitute a compara tively wealthy yeoman in other parts, serves merely to establish a magnified form of Irish cottier in these. It is superfluous, therefore, to add that all the appliances of \" high-farming \" are entirely unknown in Mohra ; indeed, the best idea we can give the reader as to the utter absence of all such implements as reaping machines or threshing machines, even in the largest \" economies \" (as the farms are called) in the village, is to cite the fact that, during our stay at the school master's house there, the daughter of the burgomaster (for even Mohra has its mayor) came over to dance one evening, and after waltzing for an hour or so begged to retire, though it was barely eight, saying she was sorry she was obliged to leave so soon, but barely \u00a3150 a-year. The crops generally grown are wheat and oats, with sufficient flax and vegetables for the wants of the family. The yield of wheat averages twenty-four maas (of 32 lbs. to 34 lbs. each, or about 7 cwt.) of corn to the acre\u2014 which is at the rate of not quite 12j Winchester bushels to the acre ! This fetches, upon an average, two gulden (or 4s.) the maas ; so that altogether an acre of good land yields very nearly \u00a35 worth of wheat and \u00a31 worth of straw, or just upon \u00a36 in all."], [30, "8 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. she had to be up at one in the morning to go threshing in her father's barn. In a town consisting mainly of peasants, of course handicraftsmen and mechanics cannot be expected to flourish. There is only one carpenter among the Mohra population, and even he, from dearth of work at his own trade, has been forced to take to the more lucrative occupation of swineherd. One shoemaker, too, is there in the village ; but, said the pastor of the place to us, \" Neither does he thrive, poor man ! \" Nor are there any builders, for the houses are all of the \"wattle and dab\" style of structure, so that neither masons nor bricklayers are required, where the walls consist only of mud and wicker-work, rather than bricks or stones. On the other hand, not less than eight, or just a tithe of the four-score householders in the little colony, are woodcutters \u2014 a fact whicli is not only sug gestive of the sylvan character of the country round about, but recalls the story of Hans Luther having followed the same occupation in these parts, as well as of Martin's mother having often carried home the bundles on her back, with her little ones, each laden with a faggot on his head, trotting by her side. As we walked out towards Lauterbach early the other morning, we met several of these Mohra wood men trudging along to the woods, some with their huge saws slung quiver-like at their back (the shark like teeth stuck in a narrow wooden groove, or \" sheath,\" as it is called, by way of protection) and with their hatchets over their shoulder; and others with a long bill-hook, that seemed like an attenuated"], [31, "9 TIIE LUTHER VILLAGE. note of interrogation, borne, as if it were a halberd, high in the air.

How often, too, must his axe have flashed, as we saw theirs, amidst the dusk of the tree-stems, and seemed to deal silent strokes, till, after an interval, the woods were heard to ring with each succeeding blow.

The community land of Mohra consists of three portions :\u2014 1. Of a certain tract on the road to Salzungen. 2. Of the Moorgrund (moors) leading to the Bohrigs hof. 3. Of the valley near Kupfersuhl, called Lauterbach. The whole of this is parcelled out into a hundred equal portions, and every spring-time the villagers meet at the burgomaster's house to draw lots for the several parts ; it being so arranged that those who have held one of the fields by Salzungen this year shall have one of the moors by the Ecihrigshof the next, and one of the meadows by Lauterbach the year afterwards. Some of the villagers are entitled to a double share of the common land, in consideration of their house consisting of two tenements thrown into one, so that the hundred parts are thus duly apportioned among the eighty odd householders constituting the entire com munity. The woods themselves, on the other hand, belong to the Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen, and at the beginning of the fall of the year the forest-man comes round and marks such of the trees as are fit for felling, making a long slit in the bark of those that are to be used for firewood, and stamping those whieh are adapted for building with the initials S. M. The bauers requiring wood then have to make known how many cart-loads thev desire, and receive respectively in return a ticket bearing a certain num ber ; and when as many cart-loads of timber have been felled as the number marked upon the ticket, and it consequently comes to the turn of the bauer holding such ticket to be supplied, he has to send a wagon to the wood and fetch the load away. The wood-cutters are all employed by the Government and paid by the forest-man. The cost of a cart-load, sLx feet long by six feet broad, and four feet deep, and consequently containing 144 cubic feet in all, is nine gulden, or 18s. English, when cut into logs for burning.

Well : even the few handicraftsmen numbered among the village popula tion can hardly be said to be handicraftsmen proper, being rather a kind of mongrel type \u2014 half-boor, half artizan; for the smiths and the tailors are, many of them, small farmers ; while the weavers, like the woodcutters, ply their trade only in the winter, and in the summer abandon the shuttle, as the others lay aside the axe, for the sickle and the scythe, the spade and the hoe. Indeed, the two watchmen, whose duty it is alternately to guard the tiny colony by night, and to sound every hour on a horn under the windows of the sleeping peasants, from bedtime till day-break ; and who are allowed a pair of strong shoes every year, in consideration of their continually parading"], [34, "12 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. the streets from night till morning \u2014 even these are the cowherd and swineherd of the little community by day ; one half of tlieir time taking care of the villagers themselves, and the other half minding their cattle and their pigs. Nor are the officials \u2014 the temporal and spiritual authorities of the hamlet \u2014 of a less agrarian cha racter ; for the Herr Pastor has his flock, not only in a figurative, but in a literal sense of the term, and finer sheep cannot be seen for miles around. The schoolmaster, on the other hand, is renowned for breeding the biggest calves in the parish, and culti vates early peas and young potatoes as well as youth ful intellects ; while the burgomaster, or Schultheiss, as he was called till a few years back, is simply the greatest boor in the parish ; and being a kind of petty magistrate as wTell as a small farmer, dispenses a rude form of agrarian justice, and cuts his chaff with equal alacrity. The one policeman, indeed, who constitutes the entire \" executive \" portion of the village Govern ment, is the only official who seems to have a pure and unmixed vocation ; though we doubt much whether he is not occasionally pressed into the rural service, and set to scare the crows off the land at sowing-time, as well as to drive away the beggars at other seasons.* * The wages of a day-labourer in Mohra are about 7d. per day, with his keep ! Ploughmen are paid 4s the acre, and the average work done is about an acre a-day. Wood-cutters get Is. 3c.. the cart-load (Klafter, containing 144 cubic feet), and a man, working from morning till evening, can do from half a klafter to a"], [35, "THE LUTHER VILLAGE. 13 But if there are few pure mechanics and artizans, there are still fewer tradesmen in Mohra: if the klafter, according as the days are long or short. Carpenters, when employed, have Is. id. a-day without tlieir food; and weavers (of whom there are five in the village, though the most of them work as farm-labourers in the summer) are paid from ]fZ. to %2d. the ell, according as the work is coarse or fine. They can do from six to eight ells a-day, and consequently earn, upon an average, about 7s. a-week. The swineherd (for there is only one) gets every year fifty-two maas of rye\u2014 each maas being worth about 2s. Id. English. This amount is made up among the bauers in general, each contributing in proportion to the number of pigs he has to be tended. There are about 400 swine altogether in the village, of whom some forty or fifty are driven out daily into the fields. Some of the bauers have as many as twelve pigs, but the greater number have only six, while the day labourers have generally one or two. The cowherd has a little more than the swineherd \u2014 indeed, he gets sixty-eight maas of rye a-year instead of fifty-two, but then he Las to keep a hoy out of his wage. The number of horned cattle in the village is, in round numbers, 400, for some of the richer bauers have as many as twenty kine and oxen, the majority three or four, and even the day-labourers mostly possess a cow and a calf. Besides the cowherd and the swineherd, the village maintains two shepherds. These are also paid in kind, and, like the cowherd, have each to keep a boy to help them out of what they receive. Tor every four sheep that the shepherds have to tend, they get yearly one half maas of rye, one quarter-maas of barley, one eighth-maas of wheat, and one-sixteenth of a maas of oats; so that, as there are no less than 940 sheep throughout the village, the two shepherds receive between them every year 235 maas of rye (which, at 2s. 6d. the maas, is worth about \u00a329 7s. 6<2.), 11 7i maas of barley (worth about \u00a313 13s. id. at 2s. id. the maas), 58 J maas of wheat (worth \u00a311 15s. Od. at 4s. the maas), and 29 } maas of oats (worth \u00a31 14s. id. at Is. 2i. the maas). Hence the gross money-value of the shepherds' yearly income amounts to rather more than \u00a356 10s. 0d. ; and this sum, equally divided, makes each shepherd's gains come to \u00a328 5s. Od. a-year.

But no ! you might as well look for a shop in Belgrave Square as in the Ober- and Unter-gasse of the Thuringian village !

Neither is there a club-house, a casino, a theatre, a cafe chan tant, a billiard-room, a mechanics' institute, a salon de lecture \u2014 nor even a prison \u2014 to be found from one end of the village to the other. The Gasthaus, or hostelry, indeed, is the only Magazin in the place \u2014 the Wilde Mohr (or \" Savage Blackamoor,\" as the inn is called) doing the solitary bit of trade carried on in the parish ; for there, and there only, are coffee, sugar, candles, tobacco, and salt forty sheep found them by the bauers ; so that as the swineherd and the cowherd get but from \u00a37 to \u00a39 a-year, a shepherd's berth in Mohra is, comparatively, an enviable position. Some of the richer bauers have as many as forty or fifty sheep ; many, how ever, have only from a dozen to twenty ewes and wethers, while the day-labourers even have mostly one or two. A sheep is worth from five to six thalers (15s. to 18s.), and a lamb about half the money. Swine, on the other hand, fetch from sixteen to seventeen thalers the hundredweight, and weigh, when in good condition, generally about 170 lbs., so that a good fat pig is worth, usually, from \u00a33 12s. to \u00a33 15s. The value of a cow is from sixty to eighty thalers, or from \u00a39 to \u00a312 sterling.

Once during the fortnight which we passed in the neighbourhood, we saw an enterprising pedlar go up the Bohrigs-gasse with a string of felt over-shoes and slippers dangling from his hand. But beyond this bold venture on the hawker's part, and the sight of an occasional horse being shod outside one of the smiths' doors, there was not a sign of trade or com merce visible in the whole parish. So that one went along' wondering what on earth the boors did with their money, or whether they really had any at all of the current tissue-paper of the realm in their posses sion ; for, as they generally pay their wages in kind, and grow, not only their own food, but also the shirts and chemises, coats and petticoats of the entire family, it was not at all improbable that even the richest bauers, though they might be worth some thousands in pigs, cows, sheep, and land, had hardly a paper thaler, or a plated groschen to bless them selves with. What the amusements of such a people may be, beyond the annual excitement of the Kir/ues (the harvest festival), the occasional jollification of a Feicr tag (a general holiday), the mild delight of a glass of einf aches Bier at the tavern on the Sunday evening, or the spasmodic pleasure of seeing a pig killed once every half-year, we cannot presume to say. But certainly, so far as we saw, there was not a pack of cards, nor a chess-board, nor a newspaper, and hardly a book, in the place. The grown-up folk"], [38, "16 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. seemed to be in the barn and out in the fields, and the young ones in the school, from daybreak till nightfall ; so that, by the time they had given the pigs their supper and finished their own, and the cattle had been bedded up for the night, they were too ready for rest themselves to believe that there was any better enjoyment of an evening than sleep. Nor have the women and girls any more time for pleasure than the men. A German \" who has seen the world\" is generally horrified at what he calls the laziness of English and American wives and daughters ; and assuredly in Deutschland the female portion of the population work as hard as the cows. Mohra, too, makes no exception to the national rule ; for, Heaven knows, there is not much embroidery work done by the ladies there. On the contrary, the daughters, even of the richest bauers in the village, rise usually at one in the morning throughout the \"fore winter \" (as it is called) to go threshing in the barn, and continue working away with the flail till break fast-time; after which the barn-floor is swept, and the girls proceed to break and swingle flax, till four in the evening, when they have to give the pigs their supper, and bed up the cattle for the night. Then the famdy Abend-mahl (evening meal) is got ready, and by the time this is finished, it is generally six or seven o'clock, which, at that season of the year, is the usual hour for bed. In the \" after-winter,\" . . e. from Christmas till the spring-time, the invariable occupation is spinning \u2014 spinning from six in the morning till ten at night \u2014 the flax that before"], [39, "17 THE LUTHER VILLAGE. Christmas they had been engaged in dressing. At this employment the men take part, even as the girls take their share of the more masculine work with the flail. In the spring, on the other hand, the Madden are busy in the meadows, bleaching the linen after the yarn has been made into cloth by the webster ; they have also then to be out in the fields, scattering the manure over the land, or else planting the potatoes, or hoeing the \" Swedes,\" or picking the stones off the earth. Next, as the summer comes round, they must dig up the \" earth-apples,\" as the Dutch style them, help to make the hay, reap the corn, bind up the shocks, and gather the fruit. Nor is the labour-list ended here : at every season of the year the girls must do all the washing of the household, as well as bake all the bread, chop all the sausage-meat, milk all the cows, besides fetching from the well all the water that is required for the cattle or the family, and carrying each time some ten gallons (100 lbs. weight) of fluid upon their backs in long conical tubs called Butten, that are strapped on to the shoul ders. Indeed, it was while the burgomaster's daughter was engaged in this not-particularly-lad}' like occupation, that we first had the pleasure of meeting that young lady. Such heavy work as this is, of course, to English minds, more fit for sturdy men than weak women ; and it forms by no means a pleasing picture to a person of the least refinement, to see a young girl with her body bent almost double, staggering along under the burden of nearly a hundredweight of fluid.

The people tell you it is thought a disgrace for a man to be seen bearing burdens ; but they do not, on the other hand, consider it in any way unmanly to allow a woman to do so. Accord ingly, it is by no means an unusual sight to meet a market-woman, on the road to one of the large towns on a Saturday, with the Korb on her back, laden to the nape of her neck, whde the husband at her side calmly trudges along, with nothing but a stick in one hand and a pipe in the other ; the poor Frau labouring and panting away to keep up with her hulking and callous spouse. But if the villagers are primitive and unpolished, assuredly the village itself is of the same character. It is, indeed, a kind of mud Switzerland \u2014 a little colony of clay \"chalies,\" with their huge gables and broad eaves turned towards the road ; their doors, with porches as capacious as those of a country church, set at the side rather than the front of the houses ; and their bread and prune ovens, like enor mous mud-heaps under a rude canopy of tiles, jut ting out into the roadway. The w^alls of most of the houses are of a bright gingerbread colour, with the framework of iron-grey timbers showing, like a large trellis, through the \" wattle and dab \" work.

Some of the square compartments of plaster be tween the wooden framework, are ornamented with the most unartistic attempts at pictures of roses, tulips, and prancing horses ; roses like kidneys, tulips like monster brandy -balls, and horses like ram pant weasels. At the side of each house too, stands the farmyard, with its enormous barn, as big as a Lambeth Music Hall (for all the corn here is garnered, rather than stacked), stretching right across one side of the mucky quadrangle ; whilst, at frequent in tervals, along each, or rather either, of the streets, there are wells of all forms and dimensions, from the double bucket dangling over a pulley the size of a railway wheel, down to the old Boman apparatus of a gigantic fishing rod, with a chain and pail at the upper end of it, instead of a hook and line. The thoroughfares, moreover, are littered on either side with one long broken line of ploughs and empty carts, which are left outside of nearly every door, with an utter disregard of both wreather and thieves ; and these, with the exception of a procession or two of geese, filing along, and cackling away, out in the middle of the road, are all that is to be seen in the streets of Mohra.* * House-rent in Mohra is at a merely nominal value, for all the bauers, and even the day-labourers, are the proprietors of the houses in which they reside ; so that, as there are no immigrants to the village, an empty house can hardly find a tenant. The policeman, we were assured, was the only yearly tenant in the place, and he had a good-sized house let to him for twelve gulden (24s.) per annum.

But the main feature of the little village is the spot where the Wirtlishaus\u2014 -the principal (because the only) tavern\u2014 thrusts its little tin flag of a sign, no bigger than a child's pocket-handkerchief, out into the road way. The sage, who stood godfather to the hostelry, and save it its name of zu/n Wilden Mohren, evidently imagined that the wild moors, spoken of as having surrounded the village in former times, were a horde of barbarian black men, rather than part of a vast uncultivated bog ; and hearing that the village itself derived its title from these same moors of old, believed he could not do better than set up the portrait of some pot-valiant blackamoor for the insignia of the first hotel in the place. Accordingly, the tavern sign con sists of a rude painting of the ideal black bandit, on required, and these fetch as much as fifty gulden (\u00a35) the year. Facing the schoolmaster's house, in which we lodged, there was a large Hof unoccupied, the proprietor having another house elsewhere; and this, we were told, might be had, without the out buildings, for thirteen or fourteen gulden (26s. or 28s.) per annum. To build such a house and outhouses would cost from 1000 to 2000 gulden (\u00a3100 to \u00a3200), according to the price of timber ; and we heard of many large Hofs (farmhouses) in the village, which, on the death of the proprietor, had been sold by the members of the family to the eldest son for \u00a3100 ; though, in such cases, said our informant, the property usually goes for less than its real value. The burgomaster's house was valued at about 3000 gulden (\u00a3300), barns, cowhouses, and piggeries in cluded ; and yet, if let, we were told, it would fetch hardly more than fifty gulden per annum (the outhouses being small), and this is not two percent, upon the capital. A day-labourer's house, on the other hand, costs from 500 to 600 gulden (\u00a350 to \u00a360) to build, and lets occasionally from eight to nine gulden (16*. to 18s.) the year."], [43, "TIIE LUTHER VILLAGE. 21 his prancing Arab steed, with a sabre in one hand, and a pot of einf aches Bier in the other ; as if he were bidding the customers (like Queen Eleanor did Fair Bosamond in the good old times of Harry the Second) choose between the steel and the poison. And now for a word or two about the costume of the people in this primitive little Saxon Arcadia. What the Italian Opera is to a large capital like London or Paris, the market-place is generally to a small country-town like Mohra \u2014 the best quarter for studying the fashions, not only as to the character of the head-dresses and cloaks worn by the ladies, but even as to the style of coats and continuations con sidered the mode by the gentlemen. But Mohra unfortunately has neither a weekly market nor a yearly one. Formerly there used to be a fair, once a twelvemonth, held in the small trian gular space, called lobers, or more properly the loh gerbers Ecke ; but now the only trace of such a gather ing is to be found in the name of the spot, recording as it does that, once upon a time, the tanners were wont to assemble there. But why, of all places on the earth, tanners should have come to a village where wood is the prevailing material out of wdiich the shoes are made, and which cannot support even one shoemaker, is somewhat puzzling to conceive. Perhaps, however, the enterprising Lohgerbers came to buy hides, rather than to attempt to sell them to a people who have ropes even for the harness of their ox wagons, and where the only leather used consists of the small straps which the ladies wear \u2014 (you cannot"], [44, "GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. 22 help discovering the secret whenever they stoop,\u2014 for garters. As there is no market-place then to focus the peasants into a picturesque group for us, we must betake ourselves to the church-porch and observe the women there, when the service is over, come streaming out of the nave, one after another, and the men come pouring down the stairs from the gallery ; for the gen tlemen and ladies here, as at the Quakers' meetings with us, are not allowed to occupy the same seats during divine worship. Well : the sermon is ended, and we can hear the pastor within, intoning the \" Kollecte\" at the com munion table. Presently the walls of the little edi fice tremble again with the booming of the organ peal, as the schoolmaster plays the voluntary called the \" Ausgang ; \" and then what a clatter of shoes is heard overhead ! and wdiat a peculiar and motley throng, the minute afterwards, comes filing across the little churchyard, that is half-orchard, half cemetery. The young women, mark, have all tall black silk head-dresses, in shape Uke truncated sugar-loaves, stuck right on the crown of the head, and with the back embroidered with spangles and beads, and with long broad streamers of black ribbon reaching down to the waist. The front of .this Beckel-midze, as it is termed, is arched over either eyebrow, and has a long, narrow tongue, called the Scltnauzc (literally, the snout), dividing the forehead into two semi-circular compart ments, and reaching almost to the bridge of the nose."], [45, "23 THE LUTHER VILLAGE. The fashion, it must be confessed, is more peculiar than pretty, and is too strongly suggestive of the long pendulous excrescence dangling over a turkey cock's beak to be in the least pleasing. The rest of the peasant-girl's costume consists of a small short waisted cloth jacket, with high-shouldered leg-of mutton sleeves, and a linsey-woolsey petticoat, with plaits as thick as the folds of a fan all round the waist, and the skirts cut very short, so as to afford an ample view of the blue-grey stockings, with their showy \" clocks,\" and the neat embroidered shoes that finish the \" full-length.\" Some of the Madden in the neighbourhood are of enormous height. The burgomaster's daughter, though not sixteen years old, stood nearly five feet ten in her shoes ; and we saw one young woman who was only in her seventeenth year, and yet might have looked over the head of some of our Life-Guardsmen. Their features, too, are more regular than those of the German women generally, the cheek-bones being a little less sharp and angular, the nose somewhat less broad and flat, the nostrils less like an inverted \" accent circomflexe,\" and the mouth not merely a long straight gash in the face. The more elderly among the peasant-women wear nearly the same dress as the younger ones, except that the Miitze with them is somewhat dumpier, the peak or \" snout \" of it somewhat longer, and the back of it a shade less elaborately embroidered and bespangled than those of the girls. Indeed, so marked a characteristic is the high cap"], [46, "GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. 24 and short petticoats of the female portion of the pea santry in these parts, that amidst the 500 souls making up the entire population of the village, there wrere only two dames astute enough to wear bonnets ; and these were, in the words of our informant, the Frau Wirthin and the Frau Bastorin \u2014 or, in plain English, the one was the wife of the innkeeper and the other the wife of the minister of the village ; the last-mentioned lady having been represented to us as being especially vorneh/n (stylish), from the fact that she not only carried a Hut (bonnet), but had her dresses made down to her heels also. The fashions for the gentlemen are somewhat of the same ungainly character. Such of the boors as are attached to the more ancient institutions of their country wear for full-dress, on the Sundays and holi days, a kind of postilion's jacket, leather breeches, and high Wellington boots, the latter being made in the same style as those worn by the coachmen at a London funeral. Others, however, who delight to appear in the newest mode, lay aside the ancient postilion's jacket, and sport a kind of green duffle dressing-gown, with leg-of-mutton sleeves, whicli the village \" bloods \" have got to consider more stylish as full-dress within the last fifty years. The same continuations, how ever, are invariably worn on high-days and holidays \u2014 unless, indeed, the undertaker-boots be exchanged for a pair of old-French-Guard-like gaiters ; and these, with cither a huge funnel-shaped hat, as rough as a Shetland pony, or else a woolly fez-cap of sheep-"], [47, "25 THE LUTHER VILLAGE. skin, constitute the approved Sunday toilet among the better class of peasant proprietors. A peculiar social custom among these simple village-folk is the mode in which the girls select what they call their \" Cameraden \" (female companions) and \" keep company \" with the boys whom they have accepted as sweethearts. In the house in wliich we lodged there were two young women \u2014 Augusta and Amelia, the well behaved and hard-working daughters of the village schoolmaster \u2014 the one sixteen years of age, and the other, perhaps, some couple of years her senior. Each of these girls had a different set of \" comrades ;\" nor did the companions of the one sister associate with those of the other. Amelia's comrades, for instance, consisted of the younger girls, who had just left school ; and those of Augusta (the elder sister) of the grown young women of the village ; and when either sister had to receive her comrades and their sweethearts at home, the other was obliged to go out to one of her own comrades' house, and pass the evening there ; for she was never allowed to remain in the society of her sister's companions. During the threshing season, it is usual for each of the maiden's comrades to take it in turn to give a \"re ception \" to the others and their Schatz (sweethearts) every Sunday evening ; but in the after-winter, im mediately the spinning season begins, the company meet at one or other of the girls' houses every even ing, instead of once every week, each bringing her lover and her spinning-wheel with her ; and there"], [48, "26 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. they all sit round the room, spinning (boys and girls alike), singing and courting, without anything to eat or drink, till bed-time. But not only is this separation of society into two classes of companions, according to age, limited to the girls and young women of the village, but the same division holds good among the boys and young men likewise; for Amelia's comrades would not have allowed one of their Gesellschaft to bring a lover among them who was above the approved age for their society ; any more than Augusta's comrades would have admitted into their company a Schatz who was considered too youthful for them to associate with. Indeed, the burgomaster's daughter, who hap pened to be one of Amelia's comrades, had the mis fortune to be engaged to a young boor, the bristly condition of whose whiskers rendered him admissible only to the Gesellschaft of the elder sister Augusta ; and, consequently, the wretched Heinrich had to con sole himself, all through the spinning-season, with the tantalizing pleasure of taking his beloved \" Lisschen\" to her comrade's house, and leaving her and her wheel at the door, and then calling for both again when all the fun was finished. Verdy, they are a curious set, these same bauers and baiierins in Mohra !

Nor can there, on the other hand, be many ingrate natures in a place where the parent's trust is seldom found to be misplaced, and the children never fail to pay cheerfully the proportion agreed upon \u2014 repining only, indeed, when the great law of nature ordains that the impost shall cease."], [50, "CHAPTEB II.

The flourish of the postilion's bugle seemed to have a startling effect on the inhabitants, as he went along blowing a \" tantara \" through throughfares where no sound is ever heard, even in the flush of day, beyond the pit-a-pat of the farm-girl's flail, the clatter of the Holzpantoffeln (wooden slippers) of the boys just loose from school, the cackle of vagrant geese, the lowing of returning cattle, the chopping of sausage-meat, or the squealing of dying swine. The blast, indeed, was as stirring as that of a war trumpet to the peaceful little Agrarian colony ; and the folk began to swarm about the carriage, like bees at the sound of a gong.

But a fanfaronade on the post-horn in the broad daylight set the whole parisii agog : and every old woman's head in the village was thrust out of every \" practicable \" window-pane, and every bauer rushed to every porch. The girls in the barns stopped breaking or swingling the flax, and hastened to the granary door; others left their long back-pails, or Buttcn, at the well ; the smith ceased wielding his hammer, the weaver quitted his loom, and the jobbing butcher the scalded pig ; as they one and all ran forth to see whether a cavalry regiment, or a travelling circus, were passing through the village. \" What goes loose ? \" each inquired of the other, as the vehicle jogged along, and the mob of boys with straw-coloured hair and butcher-blue smocks, and peasants in jackets and grubby leather breeches, flock ing beside the panels and staring in at the carriage windows, increased with each fresh twang of the postilion's trumpet, and crackle of his whip. By the time the extra-post wagon had reached the Wilde Mohr, and the steps of the vehicle had been let down, the crowd of gaping peasantry had arranged itself on either side of the hostelry door ; and through this wondering, if not admiring, throng, we had to"], [52, "30 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. bow our way in answer to the running fire of \" Guten Tag \" wdiich saluted us, as we passed. \"Who are they? Where do they come from? What do they want here ? \" we could hear the people ask the coachman directly our backs were turned. But the driver knew as little of us as they, and therefore was unable to take even the edge off the appetite of their boorish curiosity. The only crumb of comfort he could afford them, indeed, was that he had brought us from Eisenach ; so that when they had seen all our luggage taken down from the vehicle, and had kicked over and smashed, in their scramble to get a peep at the articles we had brought with us, a large jar of distilled water, with which our son had come provided for photographic purposes, they began to disperse, one by one, eager to gossip over the wonder of our visit, and to tell of the queer-looking apparatus which formed part of our luggage, as well of the queer-looking men we ourselves were \u2014 in the barns by day, and over their potatoes by night. Now, no one, howsoever prudent, would have dreamt of sending on a month in advance, to bespeak beds at the inn of a little village like Mohra ; and yet it would seem that the smaller the place, the more necessary the precaution, simply because the accommodation there is naturally more limited. The consequence was, that on entering the Wirths haus (tavern) we found, first, that the number of spare beds in that establishment did not exceed two, and secondly, that these very two were already engaged. Indeed, directly we threw open the door of the little"], [53, "HOW WE FARED THERE. 31 cabin which did duty for the Speise-saal (dining-room) of the tavern, we discovered it to be, not merely occupied, but literally filled, by two gentlemen, the implements of whose business lay scattered all over the little apartment. On top of the puny table stretched a long roll, as big as the show-cloth to a caravan ; and here and there were littered glue-pots and sundry other articles, such as rules and T-squares, which gave one at first the notion that the occupants of the chamber were travelling bookbinders. These worthies politely informed us that was the only private room in the house, and that it, as well as the only two beds in the establishment, had been hired by them till their business in the neighbourhood was completed. We were, however, they added, free to avail ourselves of the apartment for a few hours during our stay. We thanked them, of course, but said that as our business in the neighbourhood was calculated to occupy us several days, rather than hours, it would be useless to intrude upon their privacy. \" Perhaps they would be leaving in a day or two ? \" \" Leaving in a day or two ! \" the elder of the two repeated, with a faint smile and a violent shrug of the shoulders ; \" well, they couldn't say exactly when they should have finished, but certainly not for many months ; indeed, they expected they should be there for a couple of years at least.\" In fine, they were neither more nor less than the land-surveyors who had been engaged by the Ge-"], [54, "32 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. meinde (the community) to make plans of all the diffe rent estates in the parish ; and seeing that there were altogether some four thousand pieces of land in the neighbourhood to be measured and mapped down, there was every probability of their stay being thus protracted. Good God ! how we hated those acre-measurers\u2014 that white-headed old man and red-headed young one (they were father-in-law and son-in-law we afterwards discovered) at that particular moment. They seemed to have despoiled us of our property ; for it is curious how each new comer always fancies that he, and he alone, has a right to the public room in every public hostelry. What was to be done? Were there any apart ments to be obtained in the neighbourhood ? The polite old land-surveyor, \u2014 whose mustachios, by the bye, were so white that you couldn't look at him without being under the impression that you had surprised him in the act of shaving, \u2014 shrugged his shoulders again, till his head seemed to go down like a ship in a trough of the sea, and answered with an equally disheartening shrug of the eyebrows, \" It was difficult to sa}\\ The villagers were a strange people, a very strange people, and had a strong preju dice against receiving strangers into their houses.\" The barbarians ! \u2014 and we had dismissed the post wagon. \"The Bfarrer\" (minister of the parish), suggested the young man with the carmine locks and complexion to match (and he looked almost handsome as he threw"], [55, "HOW WE FARED THERE. 33 out the idea), \" might perhaps accommodate us with one or two beds. He was a very nice amiable man, the Herr Pfarrer was,\" added the fox. \" And the Herr Schoolmaster might make up the remainder for us,\" chimed in the silver-haired father in-law \" (there is nothing like silver hair after all, thought we ; it gives a man such a benevolent, bankerlike look) ; \" the Lehrer, he knew, had made up a few beds for the visitors at the last Kir/nes.\" With what different eyes did we now look upon that blanched old land-surveyor and that florid young one ! they seemed to us like the red and white roses of Thuringia. At least they were gentlemen, and it was lucky for us we had met with men who knew something about the amenities of life, as well as trigonometry. The Herr Pfarrer lived but a few doors from tiie inn. He had the prettiest house in the village. It wanted but the Alps for a background, and a broad lake in the foreground, to have given a person the idea of beings in one of the Cantons of Helvetia. The pigeons roosting under the gable eaves seemed like so many doves resting on the ark. The storm was over, then, thought we ; there was a break in the clouds, and we felt assured of an olive branch, and, most likely, a bed and a good supper for the night. The Pfarrer, when he made his appearance before us, we found to be a tall gaunt man, in a long and ragged plaid dressing-gown, and with a forehead and forelock somewhat like the figure of \" Old Time.\" VOL. i. u"], [56, "34 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. He came to us carrying a kind of wand with a goose's wing at the end of it, for he had been helping his people sweep the chaff from the corn in the barn. He was as unlike a London pet parson as one of the Apostles of old ; simple and bashful even as a child ; unpretentious and kindly-looking as the ancient Sama ritan ; and the very opposite, indeed, of your modern trumpet-blowing Pharisee, who is everlastingly \" pray ing in public places\" that he maybe \" seen of men.\" We communicated to the Pfarrer (in as pathetic a manner as possible) how very awkwardly and un pleasantly we were situate \u2014 without even a bed or a roof for our head that night. He was evidently touched by our narrative, simple soul ! \" But what could he do more than sympathize with us ?\" he asked in reply. \" Your habits are so different from our own. We are unused to your ways, and you to ours.\" He had read a good deal about London, he told us \u2014 about the great big place it was; and about \" Botten Bow,\" and the ladies in men's hats on horseback there ; and about Smithfield, too, where the wives were sold with a halter round their neck. Oh yes ! he knew a deal about it, and was afraid he should only make us as uncomfortable as we should make him. Alas ! had we mistaken our man ? we inwardly inquired. Was the simple shepherd about to turn the stray sheep from his fold\u2014 to thrust us from his door with a paltry excuse\u2014 the mere diplomacy of politesse ? We looked him straight in the face, staring so hard"], [57, "HOW WE FARED THERE. 35 at him, indeed, that the bashful old boy cast his eyes on the ground like a girl, and stammered out, \" How ever, he had two beds that he could manage to spare, and, such as they were, they were quite at our service.\" Thank Heaven ! we were right in our estimate of the man, after all. It was not for the trumpery bed we cared, nor for the paltry supper either (though we were as hungry as hunters certainly), but we were delighted \u2014 for the mere sake of human nature \u2014 that our ideal Good Samaritan had not proved a mere fashionable quack-salver. \" Yes ! he was the fine simple-minded, plain-dealing, kindly and hospitable, dear old boy we had felt satisfied at the moment we set eyes upon him. (It's astonishing what a high opinion you always have of a man directly you are going to get anything out of him.) We trust we are not particularly selfish; but, tired as we were, and with our stomach yearning for a meal, we could have thrown ourselves into the good man's arms, as soon as we heard him speak the blessed words. \" A hundred thousand thanks !\" we breathed. Only a moment ago we were bedless, on the borders of the great Thuringian forest (how terrible it sounds !) ; and now, Hallelujah ! we were certain of a good night's rest ; for wre don't know how it happens, but there is always something overpoweringly somnolent in your true clerical atmosphere ; and, to do our good friend justice, he was amiable rather than lively. Indeed (we trust the worthy soul may never see the words) to speak the truth, the man was about as slow as an old \" fly-waggon \" ; so that we felt assured d 2"], [58, "36 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. there would be no necessity of a hop-pillow in that house. But our party consisted of four, and as yet we had the promise of only two beds \u2014 of two German beds, be it remembered ; and people who have lived on the Bhine, and heard your true-born British wife, who has never (since she was married may-be) been once separated from her dear husband, ask indignantly, on her first insight into the economy of a Dutch \" Sehlaf zimmer,\" \"However she and her good man were to be expected to sleep in a baby's crib like that,\" will readily understand the impossibility of stowing away double the number of bodies in half the proper number of beds, in a land where the natives sleep in \" cribs \" but little bigger than orange-boxes, where sheets and blankets are unknown, and where each individual slumberer has to roll himself up in the superincumbent feather-bed, to prevent being left in a state of Adamhood during the night. But it's strange how selfish misery makes even the best of us. A couple of philanthropists on a raft would not be many days before they tossed up which should eat the other. \" Now,\" said the lady, as she threw herself on the sofa after a hearty meal, \" a child might play with me \" ; and even a pawnbroker may pat an orphan on the head after his bottle of port at a charity dinner. In sooth, it is no slight drawback to human virtue to think that it is only when we ourselves are easy and comfortable, we can afford to give heed to the comforts of our fellows. True ! poverty has its heroes as well as its martyrs ;"], [59, "HOW WE FARED THERE. 37 but martyrdom, in such a state, is the rule, and heroism the exception. Moreover, Rothschild need not take a glass of Johannisberger the less, even though he stuff his pockets with tickets for soup for the poor pariahs. In the natural selfishness of our hearts, then, we had utterly forgotten our friends and fellow travellers ; the Herr von California and young Boese \u2014 the latter, the son of the burgomaster of Eisenach ; and as we saw the poor bedless boys yawning at our elbow, we felt as if we were the wicked uncle who had deserted the two innocent babes in the great wood of Thuringia. However, not to bore the reader with a mass of un interesting detail, suffice it to say that we found, on inquiry at the school-house, that the entire team of us could be accommodated there. Indeed, the Sehlaf zimmer \" (sleeping apartments) at the Seminar were as full of beds as a low lodging-house, and as full of musical instruments, too, as the London hostelry for Italian boys ; for the schoolmaster was, as is usual in Germany, the \" Cantor \" (the manager of the music) at the church also, and the parish supplied him with Claviers gratis. In our bed-room stood a grand piano, in lieu of a wash-stand ; in the passage was an \" upright \" without any keys, instead of a wardrobe ; and below, in the Sfube, was a \" cottage,\" in lieu of a cheffonier. Nevertheless, despite the daily snoring of the morning and evening hymn below, by the united day scholars at this establishment ; and an occasional Brobestunde (hour's practising) of the whole"], [60, "38 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. of the wind-instruments in the parish band, growling away beneath ; and a ball being held on the \" Feier tage\" (holidays) in the school-room directly under our bed, and at whicli the entire body of bauers and baiierins seemed to be dancing in wooden slippers, \u2014 despite these little drawbacks, we say, we managed to make ourselves pretty comfortable as long as we stayed in Mohra. A wise man can live anywhere. It is no longer the fashion for philosophers to prefer a tub to a cottage orne ; still he is but a poor man-of-the-world, who cannot be content with a bare floor and a straw-bed, in aland where Brussels carpets and spring mattrasses are unheard-of luxuries.

The Frau Lehrerin was sorry to say the land-sur veyors had eaten up the burgomaster's last capon only the day before. \"Hang the land-surveyors!\" was the mode in wliich we gave vent to our indignation. \"But surely there's an egg or two to be had in a country place like this,\" we expostulated.

Why, they've got white flesh!\" We were too sharp-set to be argumentative, or else we should have rejoined, \"And so have chickens, and turkeys, and calves, and dairy-fed pigs.\" As it was, however, we merely asked, \"Well, then, what can you let us have?\" The last answer was the same as the first : \u2014 \" Here gives liver-sausage, and red-sausage, and Savoyard sausage, and hard-sausage, and roast-sausage,\" and again she would have run on, for an hour, perhaps,"], [63, "HOW WE EARED THERE. 41 but we interjected that a few \"roast sausages\" (though they are merely fried, after all), with a little Kraut, would do very well \u2014 especially as there was nothing better to be had \u2014 and then, with a potato salad (the dame shook her cap-ribbons once more), or say a cabbage-salad, instead, if you will, we continued, and a few pickled plums, by way of compote, together with a little Harzer-kase (cream cheese with carraway seeds in it), we should be able to get along somehow till morning. \" But wait,\" we suddenly exclaimed ; we had for gotten one thing. We could not eat, though we had been some time in Germany, that mud-coloured, sour, and heavy cold- dumpling, v-hich the Deutschers call bread, and which is generally of about the same consistence and inviting appearance as \"papier-mache, and of about the same specific gravity, too \u2014 ay ! and as easy of digestion as argillaceous ironstone besides. \" Were there any Semmels, or Mileh-brodchen, or indeed any kind or form of white bread to be got in the neighbourhood ? \" Again the good-tempered dame chuckled till her fat sides wabbled like a lump of \" size,\" while she assured us that the land-surveyors had devoured all the \" little breads \" that had been sent over to the Wirths-haus from Salzungen that morning. \" The cormorants ! \" we couldn't help shouting ; and then in our despair we wished there were only a London workhouse in the neighbourhood, where we might apply for a little out-door relief in our destitu tion."], [64, "42 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. \" Oh, for a British pauper loaf of ' Best Seconds !'

However, we didn't sup so very badly, after all. (Wives always want to know what their husbands had for dinner when they \" eat their mutton \" with a friend ; so, we suppose, there must be something naturally interesting in a bill of fare.) The Herr Pfarrer came, and he ate liver-sausage and Saner-kraut till we could hear his waistcoat buttons burst forcibly from the cloth ; the Herr A'on California fastened on to the blood-puddings like a leech ; and we paid our attentions to the roast sausages and cranberries (a curious compound to English palates, but far better than boiled beef and cherries, or roast pork and prunes, to which one is occasionally treated in Ger- many) ; whilst our son laid into the pickled plums and apple-cake, as though he thought such things \" food for the gods.\" What was the young burgomaster's special weakness, we know not ; though, we suspect, he was too much taken up with the schoolmaster's pretty daughters to be able to put his lips to the other dainties. Amelia was evidently spicier than the warm beer to his taste ; and Augusta as flit as butter at least \u2014 if not \" quite the cheese.\" No : we didn't fare so very badly that night in Mohra, we repeat ; for we had, from the tavern, the"], [65, "43 HOW WE FARED THERE. only two bottles of St. Estephe that the cellar of the \" Barbarian Blackamoor \" contained \u2022 and though the wine had been sadly doctored \u2014 (so sadly indeed that, as is usual under the doctor's hands, the spirit had utterly fled) \u2014 nevertheless this was enough, with a chopin or two of einf aches, or the simplest of simple beer, to give an air of theatrical festivity to the evening's entertainment. Then, after a while, the supper-table was got out of the way, and a dance extemporized. The best-looking and most vorneh/ne of the young Baiierins were sent for out of the village ; the Herr Cantor struck up on the jarring clavier a waltz that was about as lively as the \" Old Hundredth,\" and the Herr von California and the young Burgomaster Boese, together with Master Mayhew, proceeded to twirl the Frauleins Amelia, Augusta, and Lisschen among the trunks and bedsteads of our little sleeping apartments, with the same dexterity as Hansom cabmen work their way between the 'busses, carts, and vans blocking up Cheapside on a week-day. Our dancing days, alas ! are over ; and accordingly, while the young ones kept spinning round and round the chamber, like so many teetotums, we sat in one corner and played \" sixty- six\" with the Herr Pfarrer and the land-surveyors, who had also come to join us. \" Let's sing the national song of Thuringia,\" sug gested Heinrich, as the waltzers halted to cool them selves.

(By me 'twould ever blow) sang the young folk. \" I'd got nothing but acorns in my hand \" (acorns"], [68, "46 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. are equivalent to our clubs), observed one of the elder ones at the card-table. \" If you had played your red ten (ten of hearts) instead of the ace of balloons, we should have won the game,\" said the red-headed land-surveyor to the white-headed one ; while the choristers wound up with \" Tai ii'miOc mit'.\" (Don't you think so ?) \" I must go when this is over,\" whispered Elizabeth to Lisschen between the verses ; \" for, do you know, our geese hadn't come home when I left, and I can't tell what's got to them : \" and then the two young ladies proceeded to sing with the rest : \u2014 \" 2Bat i_) ein 9S8flleit. fBctli? i.oUt iii) bei tic sctui.\" (If I a bird could be, I'd quickly come to thee.) And so it went on : now a snatch of lackadaisical poetry, and then a bit of boorish literality, till the end of the play. No sooner was the song finished, than Bichard, the youngest son of the teacher, shouted \" Ca-putf Be becca has broken her thread,\" alluding to a young Baiierin who sat spinning away, beside one of the beds, at the little wheel she had brought with her ; and instantly there was a rush of all the young men in the room to kiss the pretty 3'oung spinster \u2014 such being the forfeit customary in that neighbourhood.

Away went Amelia with young Boese, flying round and round, like the governor to a steam engine ; away went Hein rich and Bebecca too, with Master Mayhew and Miss Lisschen following close at their heels ; while Augusta was standing with California's arm round her waist, preparing to start after the others ; when the Frau- Schulmeisterin burst into the room and told the girl to be off and get a tubful of water at the wrell, before she did that Tyrolienne, for she knew they'd got to wash in the morning, and there wasn't a single thing in soak yet. The waltz finished, Lisschen, the skittish daughter of the Mohra mayor, proposed a game at Wie gefallt dir dein Nachbar ? (How do you like your neighbour ?) Whereupon the Madden arranged themselves in a row along one side of the room, and sufficiently wide apart for a Bursch (young man) to seat himself next to each of them \u2014 which the said Burschen proceeded to do with the greatest alacrity, two or three occa sionally squabbling for the same chair. Then a Master of the Ceremonies was chosen, and when he had armed himself with a hank of thread from one of the spinning-wheels, he went up to the girls, one after another, and demanded to know \"How they liked their neighbour? \" If the answer was \"Not at all,\" he called upon the one objecting to her partner to name the young man whose society she would prefer ; wliich done, the disagreeable youth was com manded to change seats with the more agreeable one. The question was then repeated, Wie gefallt dir dein"], [70, "48 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Nacl/bar ? \" Good,\" the answer mostly ran in such cases ; whereupon the girl was ordered to give the said neighbour a kiss, as a proof that his company was not unpleasant to her. If she hesitated (and even a booress will play the coquette occasionally) she was beaten with the skein of yarn till she obeyed, and kissed her partner in downright good clownish earnest. (N.B. There was no necessity for much ill treatment of the ladies on the occasion above referred to.) After this came another waltz, another song, and another game ; the upshot of the latter being kissing as per last \u2014 indeed, this seemed to be the sole aim and end of all the Mohra pastimes. One of the girls dealt the cards all round to the boys, and then had to say which card should salute her. \" Whom will you have to kiss you, Bebecca ? \" asked California. \" The Bed King, eh ?

For the man had scarcely said \"good day \" to us, before he apprized us ofthe fact \u2014 a piece of ostentation which might have been pardon able, had it proceeded from any sense of his great an cestor's qualities ; but which was far from admirable, seeing that it arose merely from an idea of the worth of the name in the matter of \"drink-money.\" The swine herd, indeed, had found there was a certain market value set upon the name of Luther by visitors to the town ; and, therefore, was particularly alert in com municating the information to strangers, as to his being the ultimate member of the tribe in that village ; in the hope of extracting an extra groschen or two from the reverence of the tourists, and transmuting the coins into corn-brandy -wine \u2014 for the fellow assuredly had a greater love of Schnapps than mar tyrdom. \" So you are the Last of the Luthers,\" said we, eyeing the man with all the veneration of association, and endeavouring to pick out, if possible, some faint trace of a resemblance in the boorish features of the clown, to the sturdy, and yet tender expression of the great German Beformer. But the most bigoted phy siognomist could hardly have fooled himself into any such belief; for the fellow's head had so marked a sheepish character about it, in the receding forehead and long projecting nose, that he certainly had more of the lamb than the lion visible in his countenance. \" So you are the Last of the Luthers,\" we repeated,"], [76, "54 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. in a more melancholy tone, as we thought \" How are the mighty fallen ! \" \" Ya ! \" grinned the Lutheran descendant ; and his mouth stretched under the pleasurable emotion, either of his pride, or some bright pecuniary prospect, so wide across his face, that it looked like that of one of the compressible gutta-percha heads when the forehead and chin are brought into close proximity. \" Ya ! aud I be the swineherd here, too, my gentlemen,\" added the clown, chuckling again, as if the latter idea was quite as consoling to his vanity as the first. \" But to which of the branches of the Luther famdy do you belong, my good man ? \" we enquired ; \" are you connected with the Barchfeld, the Lan gensalz, or the Salzungen trees ?\" \" I've nothing to do with trees at all,\" was the simple answer, \" that's the woodcutter's business ; for I tell you I be only the swineherd here.\" We could not help casting a smile of pity at the man's pastoral innocence concerning all genealogical technicalities, whde we continued, \" But how do you claim kindred with the great Beformer ? Do you spring from his family directly ? or do you belong to any of the collateral branches ? \" \"I tell j'ou I'm the Last of the Luthers here \u2014 that's all I know,\" returned the boor, half-angrily, \" and everybody in the village will say the same ; for I'm always shown as such to everyone as likes to give a small drink-money to see me,\" and here he bowed his head by way of hint to us. \" Why, at the time they set up the monument by the Luther's Beech over by"], [77, "THE LAST OF THE LUTHERS. 55 Altenstein, I was fetched away from here by the parson, and taken over there to stand out in the middle of the crowd with my mother, who was alive then, and the other Last of the Luthers. There were three or four of us there at the time ; and when the pillar was uncovered they sent the hat round for us, and a pretty lot of groschens we got by it.\" Whereupon the swineherd chuckled once more complacently with the sweet recollection of the pfennigs. It was now unmistakably manifest that the clown cared for his lineage, not on account of the honour of the family, but solely for the petty beggar's estate, that the reverence of others had connected with it. So fooling the boor to the top of his bent, we went on saying, \" I suppose, Luther, you expect to make a decent penny when the statue of your great ancestor, Martin, is set up in this vidage next year? \u2014 eh ? \" \" Ya ! indeed I should think I do too,\" he returned indignantly, \" Where's the use of having come from such a stock, if you ain't to get anything by it ? There's no pride about me,\" he added, with a grin, \" for I always takes whatever gentlefolk pleases to give ;\" and here the beggar gave us another suggest ive nod \u2014 a nod that we reckoned up at five groschens at least. \"All I mean to say is this: it's a dis grace to the land, and to the great nation of Germany, that I'm left in the state I am; when it's written down in the church books here, under the record of Johann George Luther's death, that he was a de scendant of Dr. Martin Luther's, and leaves behind him only one son Johann Nicolaus Luther, neighbour"], [78, "56 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. and master-joiner, and that's myself. It's a crying shame, it is, I ain't comfortably provided for. Why don't they build me a good house, and get up a good subscription for me which would allow me enough to live upon without any more work for the rest of my life ? Ya, that would be something like an honour to the name of Luther ; but, as it is, his chddren ask for bread, and they give them nothing but stones.\" The swineherd, we found, upon cross-examination, was so utterly ignorant as to his relationship with the Beformer's family that, at first, we could hardly help looking upon the fellow as an impostor. But the landlord assured us that there was no doubt of his Lutheran descent ; so, having learned that his Christian name was Johann Nicolaus, we after a while made out, by aid of the genealogical works we had brought with us, that he was a descendant of Hans Luther, \" the Little,\" as he was called, who was one of Martin's two uncles ; and that Martin Luther's father was, consequently, the great-grand uncle of this same Johann Nicolaus, some eight generations back. On pointing out the fact to the swineherd himself, he exclaimed, as he scratched his head in wonderment at the pedigree we set before his eyes, \" Yea, well ! That be I, Johann Nicolaus the joiner \u2014 gang gewiss \u2014 I was brought up to that trade. I was the grandson of Johann Nicolaus Luther, the Hussar, too, sure enough. But how it can be as you say, that I come from Hans the Little, and not from Martin Luther's own father, is more than I can tell. All I know is,"], [79, "57 THE LAST OF THE LUTHERS. I've been the last of the Luthers here for some years. But I don't care for your books, for the minister of the village knows that I'm the real Last of the Luthers too. Why, you'd be taking the bread out of a poor fellow's mouth by such rigmaroles. I am the Last of the Luthers though, and the Last of the Luthers I mean to be, till I'm laid in the church yard a-top of the church-hill yonder, please God ! \" and so the boor raved on until a glass of carraway schnapps stopped his mouth. We had some little difficulty in making the swine herd understand that we had no wish to deprive him of his birthright, or the groschens he got by it either ; but he, poor fellow, wras so utterly unskilled in following genealogical intricacies that it was impossible to impress upon him the difference of having sprung from one branch of the family and another. To him there was but one Luther tree, and of that one he persisted in being the last shoot left of all the branches that had once flourished in Mohra. However, it was no time to stop splitting hairs about heirs, direct and collateral, with the pig-driver ; so, returning our books to the carpet-bag whence we had taken them, we bade the \" Last of the Luthers \" bring them, and the rest of the luggage with us up to the schoolmaster's, where we were to lodge during our stay in the vidage. Nor could we help smiling to ourselves at the strange tricks that Fortune plays in the world, as we heard the directions given to this same Last of the"], [80, "58 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Luthers, concerning the care of the luggage on his way from the one place to the other. \" Now, I say, Luther, what in heaven are you up to ? \" our son would cry. \" You're a pretty fellow to carry boxes ! you'd be smashing all my photographic chemicals, if you don't take care\" \u2014 for either the schnapps he had taken, or the boxes he had on his shoulder, seemed more than he could carry. The next minute, as the swineherd lagged behind under the weight of the load, the cry would be, \" Here ! Luther ! Luther ! Come along, old slow coach. There's not much progress about you now, whatever there might have been about your ancestor in the Middle Ages.\" And so it went on, now \" Luther this,\" and then \" Luther that ; \" until the commands seemed like the incongruities of some strange travestie penned by the finger of Old Time himself. Luther ! who, in the olden time, had cast off the heavy burdens of his day, now willing to bear as many as he could hobble along under, for a few groschens. Luther ! who had braved the burning of his body at the stake, now craving only to have his throat burnt with brandy- wine, every quarter of an hour through the day. Luther ! who had destroyed the bull of his Holiness the Pope at Witten burg, now sitting down quietly to attend the boors' swine at Mohra. Could there be a drop of the same blood in two such utterly dissimilar natures ? Or is it circumstances that make men, after all, rather than heritage or organism ? And yet as we walked along, pondering over the"], [81, "59 THE LAST OF THE LUTHERS. mighty change that had come over the spirit of the Luther dream, and with the last of the great Eeformer's family bearing our trunks at our heels, the conceit forced itself on our minds that the voca tions of the great Martin and this same wretched Johann Nicolaus were not so utterly opposed after all : Martin had also played the part of watchman in the darkness ; he had blown his horn, as loud as Johann Nicolaus, to wake the slumberers up as the light drew near. Nor had Martin been less expert at driving the swine of Borne than Johann Nicolaus was in managing the Mohra pigs. How skilfully he had taken Tetzel along the road he had wanted, when he had got the animal fast by the leg ! How the Catholic swine tugged and squeaked under his tether, and how cleverly too he made the papal old boars fly before him ! Yes : under this fanciful view we could see some little kindredship between even the mighty Martin and the crestfallen Johann Nicolaus himself ! \" A plague o' both your houses ! \" cries Mercutio, when worried to petulance with the eternal feuds of the Montagues and the Capulets ; and, assuredly, the Wars of the Boses hardly made more dissension in England than the rival Luther houses \u2014 the York and the Lancaster of Mohra \u2014 have done in the hamlet on the outskirts of Thuringia. The Luther houses (for there are two, each pre tending to be the only genuine one) are the sole \" lions \" to be seen in the village. Both alike claim to"], [82, "60 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. have been the real identical residence of Hans Luther, the miner, and father of the Beformer, previous to the family having gone to reside at Mansfeld, at the foot of the Harz mountains. \" Dr. Martin Luther's Ancestral House \" is the sign painted up outside one of the homesteads. \" The real residence of the old Luther family,\" runs the inscription which is nailed upon the walls of the other. \" Don't believe a word they say, sir. The real Luther family never slept a night under that roof,\" said the proprietress of the one establishment, as she tossed her \" snout-cap \" contemptuously in the direc tion of the rival tenement ; \" why, the very old table as stood in this chamber for hundreds of years is now up at the Wartburg, and there shown as the one that Martin Luther wrote his translation of the blessed Bible upon ; that it be, my gentleman ! \" \" But I thought,\" we mildly insinuated, \" that Martin w7as born at Eisleben, rather than here, and that he never visited Mohra until long after his translation of the Bible had been finished, and he had become known throughout the world as the great German reformer.\" \" That is God's truth, my gentleman,\" the woman repeated, \"and that there is the very linden under which he preached to his grandmother on his first visit to the home of his ancestors,\" continued the good dame, pointing to an exceedingly young lime tree which stood in the centre of the little \" platz \" facing her house."], [83, "THE LAST OF THE LUTHERS. \" That! \" we exclaimed, as we eyed the mere sap ling ; \" why, it seems to be hardly fifty years old ! \" \" That is God's truth, my gentleman,\" she repeated, \" but you see the old tree was cut down, and this here planted in its place. But I will ask the gentleman,\" she went on, \"whether he thinks, that if this here wasn't the real Luther house that such a fine person as the Grand-Duke of Saxe-Weimar would have taken a table from it, and have put it in the Luther Chamber at the Wartburg as the very one at which Martin wrote his translation of the blessed Bible? Would he now, sir ? Is it likely, sir, if this here wasn't the real genuine old Luther house ? \" \" But, according to your own account, my good woman,\" we gently expostulated, \" Martin Luther never had his feet under the legs of the old table you lay such weight upon.\" \" That is only God's truth, my gentleman,\" the dame chattered away ; \" but I ask you again, sir, if it hadn't been a real Luther table, would a gentleman like the Grand-Duke of Saxe-Weimar have ever given his aUowance to such a thing ? \u2014 and he is a real gentle man, I can tell you, sh-, for he gave me a very fair price for the tumble-down old thing as was nothing but lumber here. Why, the last time I was over at Eisenach, my gentleman, I saw it with my own eyes at the Wartburg, polished up so grand you can't tell,\" she ran on, \" and when I heard the mumbly old guide there, who has lost all his teeth (the gentleman knows him, I dare say), and who always speaks as though he had got his mouth full of scalding hot potato-dump-"], [84, "62 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. lings, \u2014 when I heard him tell the folks up at the Wart burg that it was whde sitting at that there table of mine that Martin Luther threw his inkstand at the head of the devil ; and when I saw him show the people the very spots that the ink had made on the walls (they black the place every year, I'm told), I was obliged to stuff a whole wind-bag* into my mouth to keep myself from laughing ; for I knew right well that, though I had often eaten my soup off it, the great Beformer had never had his shoe under it in his life. Still, I ask you, my gentleman, if that table weren't a real Lutheran table, whether the guides would ever have the face to tell the strangers such stories about it as they do ? \" This was a Gordian knot that we prudently declined to untie ; so determining more philosophically to \" cut it\" we wended our way to the opposition real-old original establishment. This we found to be inhabited by the burgomaster of the town \u2014 a tall, simple, good-looking peasant, with long straight hair, hanging like a fringe over his forehead, and habited in a great-coat that reached to his ankles, with his legs encased in a pair of jack boots which extended high above his knees. We told him that the object of our visit was to see the different Lutheran curiosities in the village, and informed him that we had previously visited the rival Lutheran establishment, and wished to learn * A puffy round cake so called, and sold to the visitors at the Castle."], [85, "THE LAST OF THE LUTHERS. 63 from him, as mayor of the place, wliich was really the old Luther house of Mohra. The burgomaster was far too quiet and retiring a man to give vent to his emotions on the subject \u2014 if, indeed, he felt any. All he knew was, that, time out of mind, the house which he lived in had been called the old Luther house \u2014 that Luther after Luther had lived there before him \u2014 that he had the title-deeds in his possession to prove as much \u2014 and that he, indeed, had bought the Hof from Johann George Luther, who, as printed in the books, was the last Luther who owned the place. \" Who shall decide when doctors disagree ?\" Find ing, therefore, that we could obtain no reliable infor mation from the proprietors of the rival houses, we retired to our lodgings and our books, and there dis covered, on consulting the work of the Pfarrer Ortmann, the historian of Mohra, that the house now in the possession of Herr Burgomaster Schmeer was the one formerly inhabited by \" Hans the Little,\" Martin Luther's uncle ; and that the other house, opposite the linden, now belonging to one Ernst Heinrich Ihling, is indubitably the tenement that was occupied by Hans Luther, the miner \u2014 or, in other words, by Martin Luther's father; this being proved beyond question by the old registries of property, kept in the neighbouring town of Salzun- gen. Accurate knowledge on this part of the subject was necessary, in order to prevent one falling into the awkward mistake of going into raptures of reverent"], [86, "64 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. association over the wrong homestead ; and had we trusted to the more convincing, because less obtrusive, manner of the burgomaster, we might have framed any number of pretty fancies, as to how Hans the miner and his children had stacked their faggots, after their day's labour in the w-oods by Lauterbach, in that same burgomaster's Hof; and how Gretha Luther, Martin's mother, had rocked her little ones off to sleep in the big oaken box of a cradle, while she sat spinning by their side \u2014 even as we saw the burgomaster's wife doing in the bare old chamber at the time of our visit. Such misconceptions are sadly distressing to an author's conceit, and therefore we took care, before we trusted ourselves to be carried off into any high-flown reveries at the sight of the old Luther roofs, to be satisfied as to whicli of the tiles were likely to have covered the head of the old miner and his family. Now the reason of our being so anxious to set eyes upon the veritable old Luther house in Mohra, was not from any fatuous sense of Luther-worship (even though we are not above enjoying the delight begotten by the lively associations of reverend places), but to satisfy ourselves as to how much truth there was in the tales about the early poverty of the Eeformer's family. Martin, who had still sufficient of the monk left in his nature to be infatuated with having led a beggar's life at the commencement of his career, was not a little proud of parading, on every possible occasion, the squalor of his early days, and contrasting"], [87, "THE LAST OF THE LUTHERS. 65 them with the high position he had obtained at the latter period of his life. In his \" Table-talk \" he tells us continually, \" I am the son of a boor \u2014 my great-grandfather, my grand father, and my father, were regular boors\" (reehte Bauer n). See Tisch-Beden, p. 240, Frankfort Edit. So far, however, from this having been the fact, his great-grandfather is now well-known to have been the son of Fabian von Luther, the Baron von der Heede, who was ennobled by the Emperor Sigis mund, and who dwelt on the estate which was then called Luter or Luttera, and is now styled Lauter bach, and which is situate about a quarter of an hour's walk from the village of Mohra itself. There is no doubt, again, that the son of this Fabian von Luther, who was the great-grandfather of Martin himself, instead of being a \"regular boor,\" as the Beformer was pleased to style him, adopted the title of \" von Luther,\" as did also Martin's grand uncle, Heinz von Luther, as he was called, who was the commandant at Ziegenhain. These facts are now placed beyond question by the genealogies of Bichter and Keil, both of whom had married into the Beformer's family ; as well as by the more recent and elaborate Luther pedigree edited by Herr Bobbe, of Leipzig. So that when Martin, in the flush of his worldly pride, heated, no doubt, with the glory of the great battle he had but lately won, over the strongest and sternest of earthly foes, wrote exultingly about the miseries of his early life, and the indigence of the Luthers for many generations VOL. I. f"], [88, "66 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. before him, it would seem as if it was done merely to give greater antithetical glory to the victory ; for he adds, with no slight alloy of worldly vanity, \" And now, by means of my pen, I have risen so high, that I would not change lots with the Grand Turk him self. Nay, more, should all the riches of the earth be heaped one upon another, I would not take them in exchange for what I possess.\" But if it be untrue that Martin's great-grandfather was a \" regular boor,\" and was, on the contrary, the immediate descendant of a newly - created baron, might there not still be a faint glimmer of veracity in the speech, that \" his grandfather as well as his father were no better than boors, as regards their rank in life\"? A glance at the Luther houses in Mohra is sufficient to assure us that this part of the story also is simple romance \u2014 the romance, not of the peerage, but of that monkish age whicli delighted to make beggary the noblest vocation in the world. Hans Luther, the father of Martin, had two brothers, one called Heinz Luther and the other \" Hans the Little.\" Now Hans the Little (who was the youngest of the three brothers) was the original possessor of one of the largest and best-built farm houses in the whole village of Mohra \u2014 that which is now occupied (as we before said) by the present mayor of the place ; so that though the word \" boor \" in Germany strictly implies a small peasant-proprietor, it is evident that the owner of such an establishment would be more justly entitled to the name of \" Guts besitzer\" \u2014 a term wliich is the equivalent of the"], [89, "THE LAST OF THE LUTHERS. 67 English word \"yeoman.\" On the other hand, Heinz Luther, who was the eldest of the three brothers, is shown by the Bev. Mr. Ortmann, the historian ofthe little village of wliich we are speaking, to have been the possessor of a large smelting-oven at Langers, in the neighbourhood of the copper-mines of Kupfer suhl, and that at a time when those mines were in tlieir most flourishing condition. AVe were at the trouble (in order that we might avoid erring on the opposite side of the matter) of walking over to this same Langers, so as to make ourselves practically acquainted with the extent of the old smelter's possessions ; and assuredly, from the wide range of the ruins, the huge mound of black slag stdl left on the ground (though the greater portion of it has recently been carried off for the construction of the neighbouring railway) and more over from the circumstance of this being the remains of the only smelting-oven known to have existed in the neighbourhood at the time when the mines were in full work, it would be absurd to suppose that the owmer of such a place did. not belong to the better to-do portion of the community. This old Luther smelting-oven is situate at the end of an extensive valley, which bears the name of Lauterbach, and which, as we have before said, was formerly called Luter, or Lutera, and gave the family name to the nobles originally located there \u2014 nobles who were assuredly the ancestors of the great Be former, for Fabian von Luther, or Luter, was merely the titular equivalent of Btidolph of Hapsburg or F 2"], [90, "GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. 68 William of Normandy on a small scale. At the upper end of the valley, which is some hundreds of acres in extent, and flanked on either side by the most luxu riant woods in the neighbourhood, are still to be made out the ruins of the old \"Bitter-hof\" (knight's man sion) ; and one has but to set eyes upon the extent of the possessions to become instantly convinced that a family owning such an estate must have taken a high rank among the agrarian community of that neigh bourhood in the Middle Ages. The second best house in Mohra is that which the old property-registries of Salzungen prove to have been occupied by Hans Luther, the father of Martin himself. True, that to English eyes, it has now the appearance of an enormous mud-hovel, and would seem to have been possessed by some old Irish cottier, rather than a well-to-do farmer in a large way of business. The walls are composed of nothing but mud, with the rude wattle-work showing through in patches, where the brown plaster has fallen off between the thick lattice of timber. The windows are as small as those to a hackney-carriage, and made up cf as many little bits of different-coloured glass as the patterns in a kaleidoscope, the chambers being more like caves than ordinary living apartments of the present day. Nevertheless, the \" Hof,\" or farm-yard, is extensive enough, and the granaries and out houses sufficiently capacious, to] assure the beholder, that he who possessed such a homestead, at the end of the fifteenth century, must have been far beyond the reach of want \u2014 especially when we come"], [91, "69 TIIE LAST OF TIIE LUTHERS. to learn that many of the Mohra farmers, though holding much smaller \" economies \" than the old Luther house, can count their gulden by thousands, and their heads of sheep, cattle, and swine by the score. Away, then, with the romantic rhodomontade that Martin Luther's ancestors wrere regular boors. This is, indeed, the mere pride of humility, which the quondam monkish beggar-boy delighted to trumpet about himself. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that the early days of the great Beformer were days of the severest squalor and bitterest wretchedness ; and the question consequently becomes : How did it happen that a man, like Martin's father \u2014 striving, prudent, honest, and independent old fellow, as he assuredly was, and but two generations removed from one who had been newly ennobled by the Emperor Sigismund, and one, moreover, who had been dignified with a special coat-of-arms for his honourable services in the field, could lapse from his high estate, and pass from the rank of yeoman in Mohra to that of a comparative beggar ; such as was certainly the lot of Hans Luther and his young family during their first year's resi dence in Mansfeld ? The Pfarrer Ortmann, the historian of Mohra, Avhose brother is still a well-to-do peasant living in the village, shall put the case for us. \" The Luther family,\" he says at page 100 of his work,* \"were * Mohra deh Stammort Di:. Martin Luthers. von Johann Conrad Ortmann, Pfarrer in Steinbach bei Bad Liebenstein."], [92, "70 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. originally well-to-do ; the next of kin, the youngest brother on the one hand (' Hans the Little ' as he was called) had property (Giiter) in Mohra ; and the eldest brother on the other hand (Heinz Luther) had still, in the year 1527, a farm-house (Hof) of his own ; and the Mohra family besides were, even down to 1521, in such good circumstances that Dr. Martin Luther could be lodged and entertained by them, when in after-life he visited his father's relatives in his father's native village. How can it naturally have come to pass, then, that Hans Luther (Martin's father) got to be so poor ? \" Hans Luther,\" the Pfarrer proceeds, \"also had some fortune (Vermbgen) at the commencement of his life. He was a Bauer (literally, a peasant-proprietor) in Mohra, as Dr. Martin Luther himself says ; and consequently must have had some estate (Besitzang). Indeed, it has been before shown, that he was entitled to one-third part of the property of Heine (or Heinz) Luther, Martin's grandfather ; whilst, according to the registry of hereditary estates made out in 1676, it is manifest that Hans Luther really did become possessed of such property. \" Hans Luther, however,\" the Pastor tells us, \" suddenly quits Mohra, where he is comparatively well-to-do, in the year 1483, and goes to live at Eisle ben (where he is utterly unknown), and which is from 70 to 75 English miles away from his native place and friends. \" What could have been the cause then,\" Herr Ortmann inquires, \"which induced Hans Luther to"], [93, "71 THE LAST OF THE LUTHERS. take such a step ? \u2014 to suddenly decamp with his wife and children \u2014 with his wife too, be it remembered, far advanced in a state of pregnancy \u2014 to quit and utterly abandon Mohra, the place of his birth, the home of his childhood, and the site of all his property ? \" Some say,\" continues the writer, \" it was to find out a better means of livelihood for himself and family ; others allege that the mines in Mohra, at which Hans had already worked as a slate-hewer (Sehieferhauer), had come to a stand-still, and failed to yield any longer a sufficient subsistence. But according to other information, it was just in the fifteenth century that the mines in the neighbourhood of Mohra were in the greatest activity.\" The Pastor then cites several old mining records, such as Hei/n's Henneberger Chronicles and Bruck ner's Kirehen- und Schulenstaat, to substantiate this important fact \u2014 showing, among other things, that in the years 1456-1494 several church-bells were cast out of the ore obtained from the Kupfersuhl mines, at which Hans Luther is said to have worked (\" probably in connection with his brother Heinz ' smelting-oven \") before quitting Mohra. \" From this information then,\" he adds, \" it may be plainly perceived that the mines in the neighbour hood of Mohra were in a state of activity, not only in the fifteenth century, but even up to the middle of the sixteenth : so that it is impossible to discover why Hans Luther should have retired from Mohra and gone over to Eisleben to work as a miner, when he had already followed the same occupation in Kup-"], [94, "72 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. fersuhl (half-an-hour's walk from his native village), and could have maintained himself by mining work as readily in his own neighbourhood as in Mansfeld. \" There must, therefore, have been some other cause,\" he says, \" to have forced Hans Luther to quit the vicinity of his native place.\" The usual explanation given in the jog-trot bio graphies of the German Beformer is that founded on the authority of Nicolas Bebhahn, who was the superintendent of Eisenach some two centuries after Luther's time, and according to which Hans Luther and his wife, who at the time was on the eve of her confinement with Martin, are made to visit Eisleben solely for the purpose of being present at the \" year-market\" there. \" Though assuredly,\" as Herr Ortmann urges, \" no one but a dealer or merchant ever dreams of going to a year-market in a town which is from twenty-eight to thirty hours' journey on foot away from his own residence ; and such is the distance of Eisleben from Mohra.\" But Herr Krumhaar, who is the Luther his torian of Mansfeld, and the Pfarrer of Helbra, in that district, gives the most conclusive proof as to the falsity of the latter explanation of the mystery. \" False is it,\" he says in his little work entitled Br. Martin luthers Vaterhaus in Mansfeld, while summing up the several tarradiddles that have been told concerning the early life of the Luther family, \"that Luther's parents quitted Mohra in order to be present at the ' year-market' in Eisleben."], [95, "THE LAST OF THE LUTHERS. 73 This story is given out by Nicolas Bebhahn, who was the Eisenach superintendent at the beginning of the seventeenth century, and afterwards repeated by Seckendorf. This may be soon refuted by the fact that Eisleben at that time had no 'year-market'' that fell in the month of November. Up to the year 1515 (which was thirty-two years after the birth of Martin Luther) the Eisleben year-markets were held (only) on the Monday after ' Cantate' in April, and on ' Lambertus-day' in September.\" \u2014 Luther's Vaterhaus in Mansfeld, p. 76. Again : the same authority tells us, in his History of the County of Mansfeld at the Time of the Reformation, while giving an account of the political circumstances of the country at the be ginning of the sixteenth century, that, \"in 1522 the times of the two Eisleben ' year-markets' were changed, so that the market held at ' Cantate' was to fall on the Sunday after ' Viti, and that of 'Zamperli ' on the Sunday after ' Gallen \u25a0' and were henceforth to be held at those periods only. This notice,\" the author adds, in a parenthesis, \" is important : it teaches us that the popular story concerning Luther's mother having travelled to Eisleben, in order to be present at a ' year-market' in November, 1483, is a mere fable.

It is manifest therefore that, in the words of the"], [96, "74 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Pfarrer Ortmann, \" there must have been some other cause, than such as is ordinarily assigned, to force Hans Luther to cpiit the vicinity of Mohra \u2014 the home of his fathers, the dwelling of all his kindred and friends, where he was possessed of house and land \u2014 and to quit it, too, at a time when his wife was most ill-fitted for so long a journey.\" \" What, then, was this other cause ?\" asks the historian of Mohra. Another chapter must solve the riddle."], [97, "CHAPTEB IV. THE AFFRAY WITH MARTIN LUTHEr's FATHER AND THE HERDSMAN IN THE \" GREAT MEADOW \" AT MOIIRA. Certain it is that, whatever may have been the cause of Hans Luther's sudden departure from Mohra, the circumstances must have been of the most pressing nature to compel the miner to leave with such un seemly haste, and to take his wife with him, too \u2014 even though she was so near her confinement at the time that she \u2014 poor woman ! \u2014 was brought to bed with young Martin the day after her arrival in Eisleben. That a mere longing to make purchases at a year market could have been the motive is absurd \u2014 not only because there were no \" year-markets \" at Eisle ben at that time, but because there were such com mercial gatherings much nearer home, as, for instance, at Salzungen and Eisenach ; at both of whicli towns the year-markets were quite as large, and not a tithe of the distance from tlieir home. Moreover, if Hans, on the other hand, had been stimulated by the desire to better his condition by getting work at the mines of Mansfeld, as the second story runs, surely there was no necessity to flit in such a hurry that the husband was unable to wait"], [98, "76 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. till his wife was more fit to accompany him on so long and trying a journey ? All things considered, then, it must be admitted, at least by every unprejudiced reader, that the hasti ness of Hans' departure from Mohra was equivalent to that of flight ; and men do not fly from tlieir homes except on occasions of greatest urgency. The simple fact, then, would appear to be that Hans Luther (as Martin Michaelis tells us, in his description of the mines and smelting-houses of Kupfersuhl \u2014 a work which was first published in the year 1702) Martin's father, had, in a dispute, stricken a herdsman dead to the earth, by means of a horse-bridle, which he happened to have in his hand at the time ; and was thereupon forced to abscond from the officers of justice as hurriedly as he could. True, the Pfarrer of Helbra attempts to combat this story ; \" false is it,\" he says again in his sum mary of the many untruths that have been put for ward concerning the family of the Beformer, \" that Luther's father had killed a peasant in a quarrel, and on that account had to fly to Mansfeld. Surely the Beformer's Catholic opponents,\" adds Herr Krumhaar, \" would not have remained silent had such been the case. The entire sixteenth century had no knowledge of the fable. Martin Michaelis, the historian of the mines of Kupfersuhl, is the first to tell the tale, and it was not until his work was published, at the begin ning of the eighteenth century, that the world ever heard a word about the matter.\" \u2014 Luther's Vaterhaus in Mansfeld, p. 76."], [99, "77 TnE AFFRAY IN THE MEADOW. But surely it must strike the simplest logician, that if the story was never made known till the year 1702, the Catholic enemies of the Beformer could not possibly, have said a word about it \u2014 being in utter ignorance as to the particulars at the time when the Catholic zeal was at its height, and such enemies having comparatively died out when the narrative was first given to the public. Moreover, Herr Krumhaar's contradiction of the tale is merely a rhetorical denunciation, not a dis proof. Let us, however, hear what the historian of Mohra has to say upon the matter, for that gentle man being the Lutheran minister at Steinbach assu redly cannot be accused of Catholic enmity against the great author of the Reformation in Germany ; and, moreover, being intimately acquainted with all the traditions of the village of Mohra, he may be cited as the man likely to be the best informed on the subject. \" What cause,\" says Herr Ortmann, \" could there possibly have been sufficient to account for the sudden departure of Hans Luther and his family from the vicinity of Mohra ? What but the sad misfortune which befell him in that village ? A misfortune of which the tradition is preserved among the peasants there, even up to the present time.\" Whereupon the Pfarrer proceeds to repeat the oldest written account of the affray. \" Johann Martin Michaelis,\" he says, \" tells the tale in his * Description of the Mining and Smelting"], [100, "78 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Works in Kupfersuhl, in the Year 170.2,' and we read the same story repeated,\" adds the Bev. Mr. Ortmann, \" in Thorn's ' Description of the Castle of the Wartburg,' \u00a7 154. Michaelis writes as follows, \u00a7 83 :\u2014 ' I cannot pass over in silence the fact that the reverend and renowned Dr. Luther's father originally dwelt in the neighbourhood of Mohra, and worked in the pit as a miner, an occupation which generally prevailed at that period among the people in the vicinity. But he was afterwards very unfortunate, for with his own horse bridle he accidentally (ohngefdhr) struck down a herds man dead upon the grass ; whereupon he was forced to retire from the neighbourhood. So, in order to get the same work as he had previously been doing, he betook himself with his wife (though she was on the eve of being confined with Dr. Martin Luther at the time) to Eisleben, in which neighbourhood the couple remained ever afterwards.' (Vide 'Thorn's Wartburg, \u00a7154; Schwabe, Monumente Dr. Luther's, \u00a7 3.) \"This misfortune of Hans Luther's,\" adds the Pfarrer Ort mann, \" lives still in the minds of the Mohra pea santry. The villagers there tell you not only the same tale, but they show you the very spot \u2014 the field in which the tragedy occurred. Should any travelling admirer of Martin Luther pay a visit to Mohra, he may see the meadow whicli was the scene of the catastrophe ; if he will but go along the lower part of the village, by the road called the Boh rigsgasse, and pursue the way towards the Bohrigs hof. For at about 400 or 500 paces from the village,"], [101, "THE AFFRAY IN THE MEADOW. 79 on the right-hand side of the way \u2014 just where the road going from Mohra out to the Bohrigshof makes a bend \u2014 there the field lies.\" Now, one of the special objects of our trip to the little Luther-village was to sift out for ourselves the truth or falsity of the above story. Heaven knows we had no sectarian purposes to serve. Catholics and Protestants may throw their bigot mud one at the other as they please ; that is no reason why we should dirty our hands by taking part in the same wretched squabble. To our mind the one party believes that two and two make four ; while the other is of opinion that three and one amount to the same figure. The great clay of reckoning may, perhaps, show wliich is the better arithmetic ; though we fancy that so long as the sum of a man's life has been duly cast up, and one's account duly balanced before splitting this world, the difference between the two-and-two creed and the three-and-one belief will be found to be literally nought in the eyes of the All- Wise. A literary man's vocation, be it remembered, is merely that of a \" humanist,\" as the Scotch phrase it. In its higher qualities, either of historian or drama tist, it deals specially with the characters of men, and strives to unknit the tangled yarn of human motives, with a view of weaving the several threads of a man's fretful life into one perfect and compre hensive web. Here the author seeks to find a clue, there to pick up an end, so as to be able to unwind the ravelled skein of his hero's actions ; and it was prin-"], [102, "80 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. cipally to get a right hold of this \"yarn,\" about Hans Luther and the herdsman, that led us to go upon our teazing expedition to Mohra. Nor were we many hours in the little village before we found that the Pfarrer Ortmann' s account was strictly correct, and that every boor in the place, not only had heard of the tradition, but had something to avouch in connection with it. Heinrich, the grown-up son of the schoolmaster, was the first to inform us that he had been told there was an old book in the Ge/neinde-schrank (a closet or chest in whicli the parish papers are kept) wherein it was written that Hans Luther had killed a peasant with an ox-chain in one of the fields about Mohra ; and that the miner had been obliged to fly from the neighbourhood for his life, and leave his property to be confiscated to the State. \" Where had he heard this ? Had he himself ever set eyes on the volume ? Who had made the dis covery? \" such were the questions we discharged in a volley at the head of the young man. Herr Kirchner, the Bauer, who was the Beehuungs- Fiihrer (the accountant) of the Gemeinde-Vor stand (heads of the parish), had told him he had found the papers some few years ago, while searching for some other parish document. Accordingly, we made the best of our way to the house of the parish accountant. The homestead he inhabited was so like the rest of the farm tenements in the village, that there was every mark of the boor, and not a sign of the parisii authority about it. At"], [103, "THE AFFRAY IN THE MEADOW. 81 the door geese cackled and hissed at your approach ; and inside, women with their heads covered with cloths, and their eyebrows and clothes all fluffy with tow, were swingling and combing long hanks of flax that looked like the yellow-black hair of some German peasant-girl. In one corner of the room stood the usual narrow slanting bed, arranged on the same sharp incline as the planks down which the luggage is slid on board a steamer ; and covered with so puffy a squab that the resting-place seemed to be made up after the pattern of the mounds arranged for one's last sleep in the church-yard. Against the walls were rudely coloured pictures of Frederick the Great and Napoleon L, together with an assortment of crockery that was so shiny and yellow that the vessels seemed to have been carved out of the commonest hard soap. The agrarian accountant himself we found to be a fine-built specimen of the genus boor, standing upwards of six feet in his wooden shoes, and habited in a postillion's jacket and leather breeches ; while his hair was dressed in the approved Mohra fashion, being arranged like that of a Skye terrier, and allowed to hang in a thick dishevelled fringe right down to the eyebrows. The good-humoured clown told us that in the Gemeinde-schrank were kept all the papers belonging to the parish for hundreds of years ago ; and it was quite true that when he had to go over them some five or six years since, he found what they called an Actum, that is to say, a loose document of very old date (he could not tell the precise period), VOL. I. G'"], [104, "82 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. in which it was stated that one Luther had some one or other \" mause-tod geschlagen \" (killed as dead as a mouse)\u2014 that was a phrase they had in those parts. He could not make out any more of the paper at the time, for he was busy getting up po tatoes just then, and wanted to get through the job. Besides, the writing was so old, that it took him a long time to read even as much as he did. He could not say what the act was about, nor did he know what was the fine attached to it ; \" for you see, sir,\" he went on, \" the parish work comes very awkward sometimes, in the midst of our farm business.

All the Mohra folk had had the tale told them by their grandfathers, and they had had it from their grandfathers before them.\" Bauer Kirchner, the \" Herr Bechnungs-Fiihrer \" (as the villagers delighted to style him), was fifty-six years old he informed us, and his father had been"], [105, "83 THE AFFRAY IN TIIE MEADOW. eighty-three when he died ; his grandfather, too, had lived to be upwards of eighty also, and they all knew the story well. \" There were about six sacks full of old papers in the parisii chest,\" he added, \" and if we wished to look at them, he dare say their new Sehulz (the ancient term for burgomaster) would give us permission to go over them, and in that case he himself would be happy to help us at the work. That is, he would do so,\" he ob served with a grin \u2014 \" if we would fix any other than a Salzungen market-day for the job ; for he had a wagon load of cabbages he wanted to sell there, and Kohl was fetching good prices just then, he heard, for it was about the time for making Sauer-lcraut. But hunting among those old papers,\" said he, \" is uncommon dusty work, I can tell you, sir ; for you see the stuff gets down your throat and tickles it so, you don't know.\" We understood, by the twinkle in the -man's eye, what was meant, and promised him that his throat should be tickled with something that was more agreeable to his taste. \" But I'll tell the gentleman what may save him a deal of trouble,\" suddenly jerked out the boor, as a bright idea came across him. \" Our old Sehulz \u2014 the one that filled the office before the present one \u2014 has been over the papers as often as a ploughman over the same field; and he could tell you, perhaps, all about the old Actum I have mentioned. He lives down in the * Upper Lane,' just by the Tanner's Corner, on the road to Waldfisch. He is one of the most learned men in the whole community,\" he added, \" and could g 2"], [106, "84 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. cure cattle, and tell the weather, and read a letter better and quicker than any man in the parisii ! \" We were too intent upon the object of our visit to neglect to take advantage of the hint thrown out by the parisii accountant, and therefore set out to make the acquaintance of the cleverest fellow in the whole village. It was not difficult to find a man so wed known as the Alte Sehulz (old burgomaster), in so small a place as Mohra. The Lord Mayor of London, at the expiration of his term of office, often retires to very different quarters from those to which he had been accustomed during his official residence at the Mansion House. And certainly the Mohra mayor, iu his ex officio state, bore no marks of the pre-eminent position he had once held in the village. The house, or rather mud-hut (for it was little better), of the quondam burgomaster was as like an Irish hovel as one could well imagine, situate in the heart of Saxony. True, there were no pigs in the room to keep company with the ex-mayor, but the mud floors swarmed with shoeless children, and faces of all ages, even to three and four generations. In one corner sat an old crone swathed in a bundle of faded calico, and with her face as brown and shrivelled as a prune, nursing, and trying to quiet a sickly-look ing infant, who had a complexion the colour of goats' cheese, and was \" ill with its teeth,\" as we were told. And as one gazed at the couple, each as petulant, and almost as helpless, as the other, it seemed like the beginning and end of the circle of life \u2014 the first"], [107, "THE AFFRAY IN THE MEADOW. 85 and second childhood blending insensibly into each other. In the passages were young girls occupied at the eternal dressing of flax, that pursued you wherever you went, and sitting in a cloud of dust that covered their cheeks and arms with short yellow hairs, so that the skin was not unlike that of newly-shorn sheep, rather than country maidens ; while about the close and low chambers sported boys of all ages, with hair the colour of raw silk, and eyebrows and eyelashes to match, and clad in butcher-blue short smocks \u2014 some shuffling about in cumbrous wooden shoes, and others pattering with their bare feet over the earthen floor. Here was the same uncomfortable sloping bed in one corner, with its huge squabby -looking flabby bolster-like coverlet on top ; and in the dusk of the adjoining apartment (though it was hardly bigger than an ordinary larder), two more such puffy scarlet checked sleeping mounds were to be seen. The sole ornaments against the walls consisted of starlings in wooden cages, not much bigger than mouse-traps, and a small picture or two, in brass frames, of Luther preaching under the linden in Mohra and, \"taking leave of his wife previous to setting out for the Diet at Worms.\" Those who have seen conjurors perform the trick of the Inexhaustible Hat could not be more surprised than we Avere as to how all those small and big children, lads and lasses, married sons and daughters, old men and women, could ever be stowed away within that tiny doll's-house of a homestead; for"], [108, "86 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. every minute some fresh face turned up \u2014 even as a shower of flowers is made by M. Bobin to succeed a volley of sweetmeats, and the sweetmeats, again, to be followed by a multitude of toys \u2014 and all packed within the crown of an ordinary beaver. The Alte Sehulz himself was a hale old gaffer of seventy-six (he was as proud and communicative as tc his age as is a miss in her teens), and had hair and eyebrows as white as gossamer; while his face was as ruddy as if perpetually lighted by the glow of a Christmas fire. He had formerly been mayor of Mohra for forty odd years, and certainly none of his faculties \u2014 with the exception of his memory \u2014 seemed to us to be the least impaired by his age ; on the contrary, Time appeared to have treated the old boy as it does old port \u2014 to have taken but little of the spirit out of him, and rather to have improved his \" body \" than deteriorated it. He was chiruppy as the starlings about him ; and as gentle with the young things round him as an old Newfoundland dog with a bevy of kittens worrying at his ears. He could not say what was in the parish chest ; he had been over it often, but \" Ach der tausend !\" he couldn't remember what the papers were about, half as well as he could the day when he first heard tell of the explosion of the powder-waggons in Eisenach, though that was a good sixty years ago. Yes, it must be that, for Johann Nicolaus Luther, the hussar, had just come back to Mohra with a beard as long as a mare's tail, after getting his discharge from the Prussian army. He could not call to mind having"], [109, "87 THE AFFRAY IN TIIE MEADOW. seen any papers in the chest about Hans Luther, though he had a distinct recollection of Kirchner, the Bcchnungs-fiihrer finding some Actum in which it said some Luther or another had killed some one or other. The words might have been as \" dead as a mouse,\" though he couldn't call to mind the exact expression, or whether he ever heard anything at all about it. He was certain, though, that Kirchner did find some such paper some five years ago, or there abouts ; because he knew that it was at the time one of the teamsters at the Bohrigs-hof was seized with the staggers, and he had to leave the \" Gemeinde Versam/nlung \" (parish meeting) suddenly to go and give the horse some stuff; and he remembered that because he had to go over, after getting the animal all right, to a christening feast at the Wirth's in Wald fisch, on that very evening ; and the child couldn't be more than five years old now, he was sure. He knew they were hunting for some papers at that time. \" Tut, tut ! but whose papers were they we were looking for ? Let me see ! \" he said ; \" well, all he could bring to mind was, that it was about some place or other, that there was some process or other going on in con nection with, but the precise particulars he couldn't re call. There were six of the Vorstand there altogether hunting,\" and he recollected \" it was just at sheep shearing time, and everyone of the parish authorities was wishing old Elizabeth Miiller\u2014 yes ! that was the name\u2014 and only to think,\" he said, \" he couldn't get it off the tip of his tongue a few minutes ago. Well : they were all wishing that Elizabeth Muller"], [110, "88 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. and her smelting oven (for sure enough, he cried, that was what the process was about) was at the bottom of the Smith's Pond ; because, as he said before, they had to search for the paper just in the midst of shearing all their sheep. By the bye, that puts me in mind,\" he cried suddenly, \" that I've got an old sheep-book, in my cupboard here, that goes back as far as the year 1600 ; it's been in our family all that time, and there it's written down somewhere or other, I know, that Hans Luther lived in the house just below the school.\" Accordingly, the old sheep-book was got out, but though the Alle Sehulz cleaned up his tin spectacles, and turned over and over the leaves, the memoranda written on the pages served only to revive his recol lection as to the price he had paid for some particular ewe, or certain wethers at some time past. \" Ach the thousand ! did those sheep cost me as much as that? \" he would say nowjand then, as he turned over another page or two, and alighted on some other interesting entry, exclaim, \" Yes ! I re member that was the time my flock had got the flv so bad among them. You see, here it's written down, sir : \u2014 ' Bubbed in plenty of strong oil of vitriol and cured them in a short time.' There ain't a better thing than oil of vitriol for the fly in sheep, I give you my word, my gentleman.\" And then, finally waking out of the pastoral trance into which the memoranda respecting his past muttons had thrown the old man, he added \u2014 \" AVell ! isn't it odd, I can't find that entry anywhere now ; and yet I"], [111, "89 TIIE AFFRAY IN THE MEADOW. know I saw it somewhere or other in this book, and only a few days ago, too, when I was looking for something or other that was very particular, at the time ; but which, for the life of me, I couldn't come across then any more than I can set hand upon what I want at present.\" Our patience wras well-nigh exhausted by this time, so we proceeded to question the Alte Sehulz as to what he had heard concerning the tradition, the truth of which we had come to test. \" Of course,\" he cried, \" everyone in this village knows that Hans Luther killed a man. Some say it was a peasant, and others declare it was a herdsman. Some say, too, he did it with a horse's bridle ; some that he struck the man dead with an ox-chain ; and some, again, will have it he killed him down just by the willow in the great mea dow, while others vow the identical spot was close against the roadway. But be that as it may,\" he went on, \" every Mohra man, woman, and child, knows that Hans Luther killed some one, somehow or other, somewhere about the fields at the end of the village.\" He himself had heard it from his father, and O his father had got it from his, and so it had come down from father to son ever since it had happened. They hadn't got it out of books, for their great grandfathers had told it to their children, long before anv schooling was known among them.\" \" But,\" said we, \" if Hans Luther had really killed a peasant in Mohra, would not his property have been forfeited to the community ? and would not the"], [112, "90 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. papers then be contained among those in the parish chest ? \" \"Certainly they would, or should, be found there,\" was the answer of the Alte Sehulz. \" Now he remembered,\" he told us, \" that there was the old neighbour \" \u2014 he had forgotten what was his name just then \u2014 and he couldn't call to mind what was the precise nature of his offence ; but he knew he had done something or other that rendered his property liable to be confiscated to the State ; and that was the way the \" Gemeinde \" came to be pos sessed of the school-house. The papers about it were all in the chest, he believed, but when the occurrence took place, or what was the exact nature of it, or who was concerned in it, or how it came to pass, was more than he could say just then. \"He remembered ad about it thoroughly,\" he told us, \"only he wasn't able to recall the precise particulars.\" Another old Mohra-man (who was upwards of eighty, whom we saw, told us he remembered having heard the story repeated by his father full seventy years ago, and his father again had had it from his grandfather, who used to declare he had heard it ever since he could remember \u2014 a chain of evidence wliich carried us back to a date at least half a century pre vious to the first publication of the tale by Martin Michaelis, the historian of the mines of Kupfersuhl. The version given by this old man was that the victim of Hans Luther's rage was a Bauer, whom the miner had killed with a horse's bridle. '* Hans Luther had been to his field in the moor-"], [113, "THE AFFRAY IN THE MEADOW. 91 ground,\" he said, \" to turn his horse loose, and found the bauer's cattle upon it \u2014 at least, so he had always heard the story told.\" (Others, however, related that Hans had gone to bring home his horse from the meadow, and had found that the shepherd's dog had bitten and gored the animal.) \" Hereupon a quarrel ensued, and Hans, in his wrath, felled the other to the ground, by means of a heavy thwack with the iron bit of the bridle he carried in his hand. Then, find ing that the blow had kdled his neighbour on the spot, he took fright, and fled away in the night, taking his wife and children with him, so as to be beyond the reach of justice on the morrow.\" Such, then, is the Mohra tradition \u2014 a tradition which not one alone of the villagers has heard from some ancient granddame, but with which every boor in the place is as familiar as he is with the weather pre dictions in the Folks Kalendar. But since the people in those parts have preserved the memory of Martin's father having worked in the neighbouring mines of Kupfersuhl, where the folk delight to show you to this day the mouth of the filled-up shaft belonging to the very pit in whicli the old man wrought \u2014 a shaft that must assuredly have been closed for many years, seeing that it has now a sturdy beech-tree growing out of the debris on top of it, and under the shade of whose spreading branches we and our family ate our dinner on the hot summer's day when the Luther Monument was first set up in Mohra. Since the peasants in Mohra and the vicinity, we say, have"], [114, "92 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. carefully preserved this memory, and no one ventures to doubt the truth of it ; as well as the fact of the Beformer having* preached to his grandmother in the village, on the very spot where his own statue has recently been erected, and the truth of this tradition, again, none presume to question ; why, we ask, should these two memorable events in the Luther history be received on all hands, and the other (equally memo rable, because more impressive) be rejected \u2014 especially when the tales, one and aU, have only the same evi dence to substantiate them ? Besides, supposing the story as to the cause of Hans Luther's sudden depar ture from his native village, and the great poverty of his famdy, during the first years of their residence in Mansfeld, to be false, how is it possible that the Mohra peasantry, of all others in the world, came to have it circulated among them as truth ? for they, knowing more of the old miner and his character while living among them, would naturally have been the very first to refuse to give credence to it, if untrue. Nor can it be argued that the story was begotten by the peasants in their Catholic enmity against the son of their former neighbour, since the Mohra folk were among the very first to throw their caps up for the Reformation ; and one and all crowded about the great Beformer on his visit to the home of his forefathers, as he stood under the linden, with his old grandmother seated at his side, (for the little church of Mohra was not half big enough to hold the throng that flocked around him at the time,) to hear the wonderful son of their old miner-friend"], [115, "THE AFFRAY IN THE MEADOW. 93 preach to them against the abominations and trans gressions of the Bomish Church. How, we ask, could such a tradition ever have got a footing among such a people, had it been merely the scandal invented by the Reformer's bigoted and malicious opponents ? and that in the very place, too, where the older portion of the inhabitants must themselves have known directly (or indirectly through their fathers) the chief actor in the affray ; and con sequently, must have been the best fitted of all the people in the world to tell whether there was an iota of truth in the tale. Nor does the circumstance of the story never having been published till the year 1702 in any way militate against the force of the evidence. Who could have told the tale but some inhabitant of Mohra, or the neighbouring village of Kupfersuhl ; and in those villages in the Medi\u00e6val Ages, when few could even read \u2014 much more write\u2014 what man among the boor community could have published it ? So that it is no wonder that the tale remained dormant till the first historian appeared among them at the beginning of the eighteenth century. Add to this the circumstantial corroboration urged by the still more recent chronicler of the annals of the village (the Pfarrer Ortmann), that there is no other sufficient cause known whereby to account for the hot haste with which Hans Luther withdrew from the home of his fathers ; nor any other feasible mode of explaining how it came to pass that a man like old Hans Luther, who was but three generations removed"], [116, "94 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. from one who was ennobled by the Emperor Sigis mund, and possessed of a large estate in the neigh bourhood, should be steeped to the very lips in the most abject poverty at the earlier part of his residence in Mansfeld ; whereas, during his residence in Mohra, not only had he possessed house and lands sufficient to have made him rank as a small yeoman in England, but he is proven by the old registries of hereditary property in Salzungen, to have inherited, in common with each of his brothers, one-third part of his father's estate \u2014 an estate which, it should be remem bered, was none other than the patrimony of the grandson of the newly-created Baron von der Heede. Sum up all these matters, and a mass of evidence is cumulated, upon which surely no twelve common jurymen in their common senses would hesitate to bring in a verdict of \" Guilty.\" Finally, there is to us the still more weighty cir cumstantial evidence as to character. Hans Luther, even Martin, himself, admits, was a most severe and hasty - tempered man. \u2014 \"My parents treated me harshly,\" said the Beformer in after-life ...\" The}' seriously thought they were doing right ; but they could not distinguish character, which, however, is very necessary in order to know when, or where, or how chastisement should be inflicted \" (Lutheri Opera, W. xxii. p. 17S5). Again, we have it on record, that such was Martin's dread of his father's anger, that he would fly, and hide behind the chim ney-corner, at the old man's approach (see Audin's Life). With so hot-blooded a nature, therefore, such"], [117, "95 THE AFFRAY IN THE MEADOW. a catastrophe, as that to which the tradition refers, appears to us by no means improbable. If the old miner wanted sufficient control over his rage, to be incapable of knowing when, and how, to punish even a child, surely he was not the man to hesitate about dealing a rash blow at the head of a mere herdsman, who had offended him ; for even the tradition says no more than that the death was caused in the heat of passion, and that the old miner struck the man dead \u2014 accidentally \u2014 with the bit of the bridle which happened to be the formidable weapon he carried in his hand at the time. Nor to the ethnological mind was Martin Luther himself utterly deficient in the same passionate ele ment ; for, if a gouty father, or a consumptive mother, in the usual course of nature, beget a podagric, or phthisic, child, surely one with a temper as fiery as a blood-horse may be expected to cast a high-mettled foal. When we read, too, the letters of the great Beformer to the Saxon princes, at the time of the outbreak of the Peasants' War, and learn how savagely he would have had those in authority treat the poor ignorant race from whicli he delighted, in his worldly pride, to boast he had sprung, we discover that Martin himself was a veritable chip of the hard old block ; and that, tender and loving as the hero could be at times \u2014 exquisitely gentle and affectionate as he was in all his home-relations \u2014 nevertheless, the patient German could be as hot-blooded when his soul was a-fire, as the most passionate Italian. Indeed, had it not been for this very heat of soul \u2014 \u25a0"], [118, "96 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. for this inherited fervour of nature, we verily believe that a timid nervous child, like Martin was in his youth, shuddering at the hobgoblins, begotten by the rush of blood, whicli he tells us \" was like that of a mighty wind,\" occasionally passing through his brain \u2014 would never have grown up to be the man who volunteered for the \" forlorn hope,\" and who was the first to lead the little army of martyrs on, in the great medi\u00e6val storming of the mighty Bomish citadel."], [119, "CHAPTER V. A DAY'S SEARCH AMONG THE OLD PAPERS OF THE QUEER LITTLE LUTHER COMMUNITY. From the \"old Sehulz\" to the \"young Sehulz\" (though the juvenile burgomaster was fifty, if a day) was not a very long journey in a village whose entire length was nothing comparable to that of the British Sloane Street, and where the entire range of buildings hardly stretched, in their widest span, beyond the extent of the Metropolitan Maiden Lane. We found his worship, the mayor, at breakfast, seated in a corner of the room, in the Mohra \" Mansion House,\" that served as bed-room and sitting-room, feasting with his one farm-labourer, in the most primitive fellowship, over a mound of reek ing potatoes, which had been thrown on to the middle of the bare table, and which his worship, as well as the mayoress and her daughter, were busily engaged in peeling with their fingers. Lisschen, the Arcadian heiress of the Mohra mayor, had manifestly neither washed her face, nor brushed her hair, previous to sitting down to the morning meal * the flax-filaments still clung to her locks, so that she had VOL. I. H"], [120, "98 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. more the appearance of being tricked out in the fancy costume of a powdered peruke, than the tidy-looking, smooth-tressed, chestnut-haired maiden, such as we had previously known her ; while the lady mayoress, with a fine disregard of state (even in the presence of the farm-labourer), sat in merely her thick woollen petticoat, stays, and chemise ; and his unwashed wor ship himself in nothing but his drawers, and a long, dingy, and dusty great coat \u2014 all hob-a-nobbing in tbe simplest, friendliest, and yet, it must be added, grubbiest and most uncomfortable manner, over the Hibernian repast. To obtain permission from the young mayor to search the contents of the parish-chest for any old Luther document was the work of but a few minutes. His worship, indeed, politely informed us that he would \"clean himself\" as soon as possible after their early meal, and join us at the \" Barbarian Blackamoor,\" where all the parish meetings, as well as the parish archives, were held. The desirable operation of \" cleaning himself,\" so politely promised by his worship, seemed to us (if properly carried out) likely to be so lengthy and arduous an operation, that we agreed with our son, that we had ample time, in the interim, to inspect the \" Great Meadow\" \u2014 where, according to the tradition, old Luther's fatal encounter with the herdsman had taken place. Herr Ortmann's description as to the scene of the affray was so literal, and so precise in its particulars,"], [121, "A DAY'S SEARCH AMONG THE PAPERS. 99 that, though we took a guide with us to point out the spot, we found, on visiting the place, that such a companion was utterly unnecessary. Down the long straggling street of the Bohrigs gasse we wended our way, while every practicable window-pane was slid on one side, and a head thrust out in wonderment as to what errand we were bent upon ; and then reaching the level fields, which sur round the vdlage at the outskirts, like a vast waste, we soon espied the bend in the road, which the Pfarrer had described ; and there, striking off at a right angle into the boggy plain, we stood in the midst of the wild moors, where the tragedy was said to have been enacted \u2014 some four hundred years ago. It was a lovely autumn day, when we first visited this spot ; the grass was all sparkling, like blades of \" frosted silver,\" with the crystal dust of the hoar frost of the early \" fore-winter ; \" and between the white blades peeped the purple flowers of the autumn crocus, with which the fields in Thuringia are always coloured at that season of the year. The morning sun shot its slanting rays over the vast meadow, projecting long, black, caricature shadows of the few stray objects in the field, and lighting up the little town, that stretched across the distance, wiiile it gilded the tiny pagoda-like church-steeple, as if it were some simple halcyon place, to which the hot and savage passions of cities were utterly unknown. The brown dappled cattle were grazing far away behind us_the chiming of their tuneful bells humming hi the distance like the sound of some murmuring H 2"], [122, "100 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. brook, as the herd nibbled the rich grass. Around us stretched the broad level waste, without a hedge or hardly a tree to break the monotony of the wide green plain. Indeed, there was no sign of vege tation, save the stump of one warty old willow, which rose right before us, as if it had been the monument Nature herself had erected to mark the site of the bloodshed. A crowd of strange fancies filled the brain as we stood there in the midst of that broad and desolate plain, looking at those halcyon homesteads in the horizon. Had old Hans Luther not stricken the of fending herdsman down on that spot, he might still have remained a boor in that same peaceful little village, and have brought even Martin up to the same boorish life ; while the boy, perhaps, might have had no higher ambition than that of filling the office of mayor of his native place in after-life. Who would, then, have been left to work out the Beformation? Sum up every incident in the life of the German Reformer as minutely as we will, we shall find each little event \u2014 insignificant as it seems in the history of a mere child \u2014 to be as potent as a miracle in its after-effect upon the history of civilization. Had this savage quarrel never taken place, we repeat, the Luthers would, probably, have remained contented with the same peasant existence in Mohra, as the rest of the family did after them \u2014 sinking, and sinking, till they, who were formerly the nobles of the community, came to be the swineherds of the village."], [123, "A DAY'S SEARCH AMONG THE PAPERS. 101 In these accidental circumstances we must con fess we see the finger of God himself, working out one stupendous end. Either we must regard life as a mere chapter of accidents, succeeding one another without forethought, and put together without the least glimmer of design ; or else we must allow that there is some wise foresight, some provident scheme in the arrangement of the several minute events which are occasionally made the insignificant means to attain some most significant end. And assuredly, in the collocation of circumstances in connection with Martin Luther's early life, there is such a number of for tuitous events brought to bear upon one object that had Laplace himself calculated their probabilities, he would have found the chances in favour of the Befor mation having been a matter of design, to have been literally infinite. Have you ever, reader, dissected a bullock's eye ? Have you ever endeavoured to understand how many \" circumstances \" are there combined to make up the one composite result of the most wondrous faculty of vision ? Have }'ou ever noticed the difference in density ot the fluids with which the eyeball, even of an animal, is filled ? \u2014 a difference that we now know is necessary in order to see achromatically, or, in other words, to be able to perceive objects in their true colours. Have you ever squeezed from out the globu lar tissue of this same eyeball the wonderful little lens suspended in it ? Have you ever observed the exquisitely delicate set of muscles of which the iris of the pupil is composed, and noted how beautifully they"], [124, "102 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. are made instinctively to admit more or less light, ac cording to the requirements of perfect vision ? Have you ever thought how this marvellous eyeball is lubri cated by the lachrymal gland, and how it is fitted to move consentaneously with its fellow by special sets of muscles, working at the will of the visive being ? Have you ever thought how this, the most sensitive of all the animal organs, is protected by the continual blinking of the eyelids in front of it? Have you ever, indeed, summed up the many \" accidents \" that are in this one simple sense \" collocated \" to accom plish but one common end ; and then asked yourself whether such a number of circumstances, not neces sarily connected, could have been brought together fortuitously, or without some definite design on the part of the Artist who invented and fashioned it? For, remember, it is merely by the collocation of a number of distinct events, aU bearing towards one and the same purpose, that we become convinced of any object having beenjy/*e-nied_tated. When the barrels of gunpowder, for instance, were found hidden in the cellars of the Houses of Parlia ment, in the reign of King James, with a train ready laid from them, and extending to a place of security \u2014 who doubted that the collocation of even these two simple circumstances was pre-arranged ? And had the chain of associate events been stiU further extended \u2014 had a bunch of brimstone matches been found at the end of the train ready to fire the powder \u2014 with a tinder-box and flint and steel, too, close at hand, to set light to the matches themselves, \u2014 why,"], [125, "a day's search among the papers. 103 the web of circumstantial evidence would then have been so interwoven (each fresh particular added to the others, serving to increase the probabilities in more than a geometrical ratio) that no rational creature, outside of a lunatic asylum, could have hesitated for a moment to denounce the scheme as aforethought. The same evidence of design as is to be seen in the arrangement of the multitude of distinct detads necessary for perfect vision is, assuredly, to be found in the collocation of the number of minute and insig nificant accidents whicli helped to make a priest of Martin Luther in the teeth of all his father's ambitious desires and projects. Was it not an \" accident \" that led the hasty old miner to slay the offending herdsman in the very moor where we, but a few hours ago, were standing ? Was it not owing to this same disastrous accident that Hans Luther was stripped of all his property in Mohra, and forced to fly to Mansfeld, where he had to live for many years as a comparative beggar ? Was it not accident, again, that made the father resolve to send the lad, after the fever he caught at Magdeburg, to the Currend-school at Eisenach? Was it not an acci dent, too, which led the good dame, Ursula Cotta, there, to take pity on the little scholar, as he sung outside her house, and which thus saved the poor boy from starving in the Thuringian capital ? Was it not an accident, moreover, by which his father was enabled, a few vears afterwards, to possess property enough to pay for his son's education at the University at Erfurt? and an accident, again, which led young"], [126, "104 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS Martin to take the dusty and neglected old Bible down from the shelves of the college library there, and to open the Book at the simple story of Buth, the Moabitess gleaner, and Boaz, her kinsman \u2014 a story which so touched the boy that he must fain come, again and again, secretly to study the forgotten and forbidden volume ? Was it not, moreover, the mere accident of his college friend being stricken dead at his feet by the lightning in the woods near the village of Stottenheim, which led him to make a vow that, if he himself were spared, he would thenceforth devote his life to God ; and, indeed, what was it but the same course of accidents whicli smote his two elder brothers down by the pest, and so softened the old miner's heart towards the children that were S2iared to him, that he was induced to revoke the curse he had called down upon Martin's head, when he heard he had become a monk in Erfurt, and ultimately to give his consent to his boy's becoming a priest ! Surely such a chain of accidental circumstances \u2014 each and all tending to bring about the same pregnant result \u2014 was never yet linked together in the early history of any other being. Think, reader, of the end that was to be accomplished \u2014 of the great work that the beggar-boy of Eisenach was purposed to achieve. Think of the battle he was destined to fight, and of the freedom he was ordained to confer upon the world. Think, too, how the harsh and ambitious old miner, Hans Luther, was sworn against his son's ever becoming a monk, and how determined he was"], [127, "A DAY'S SEARCH AMONG THE PAPERS. 105 to make a magistrate of the lad instead. And then observe by what a long series of isolated incidents of luck or chance (call the Hidden Cause of the events as you wdl) the whole of the father's schemes and dreams were ultimately frustrated ; and how the great Reformer of the effete Catholic Church was raised up where least of all such an Augean stable could have been expected to have been cleansed by such a Hercules. This is no blind fatalistic creed, but merely a belief in the special and occasional intervention of an All wise Providence ; nor do we see how any other faith can be held, unless, indeed, design and supervision in the affairs of the world be utterly ignored. StiU, the main object of our visit to Mohra, viz. to see whether any direct proof of the truth of the Luther tradition could be obtained, had to be accom plished; and in the hope of finding some documentary evidence among the archives of the little community, we made the best of our way back to breakfast at the \"Barbarian Blackamoor. Here we found some two or three of the \" fore-standing \" men of the parisii waiting to accept our invitation to sausage and schnapps there that morning ; and as the news spread through the village that gratuitous \" corn-brandy wine \" and black puddings were being distributed to the heads of the community, all the boorish officials came dropping in, one after the other, to participate in the search and the cheer. Even the one policeman of the little place did not neglect to proffer his assist ance in exchange for the liver-sausage and peppermint,"], [128, "106 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. or the red herring and table-beer, which the landlord had set out so sumptuously upon the long bare table of the tap-room. The mayors of all nations are famous for their love of the good things of the land ; and certainly the Mohra burgomaster, even though his worship had had his fill of potatoes but half an hour before, ate and drank on that occasion as though he were a boa constrictor, and had a quarter of a year's appetite to appease. Gracious heavens ! how many ells of that disgusting liver-sausage, and \" Stangen\" (large quart glasses) of that stomach-achey small beer, and chopins of that red-hot, cayenne-peppery, carraway-schnapps, the parish authorities managed to get rid of on that memorable morning, we stiU tremble to think of. From the \" Sehulz\" to the policeman, they one and ad gorged and guzzled like Samoiedes, while we paid the piper like Britons ; nor did they fad to stare in wonderment at our daintiness because we refused to eat the black-puddings raw, and would insist upon being served with a plate and knife and fork, to enable us to take our morning \" saveloy \" like a Christian. The boorish astonishment, moreover, mounted to amazement when they heard us object to torture our bowels with a draught of that malt vinegar which they were pleased to call \" einfaches Bier;\" or, on the other hand, to scald our throats with a sip of that essential oil of capsicum which they delighted to style \" carraway liqueur.\" At the conclusion of the elegant dejeuner sansfour chetle \u2014 but au\u00e6 doigts instead \u2014 we left the dining-"], [129, "A DAY'S SEARCH AMONG THE PAPERS. 107 saloon (as the little tap-room was called) and mounted the tumble-down staircase to the dancing-hall, imme diately over head \u2014 the said dancing-hall being hardly bigger than the interior of a Manchester omnibus, and so low and dingy that, with its thick pillar in the middle, it seemed as if it were a slice from \" between decks \" of some coasting vessel, with the stem of the mainmast standing in the centre. Here, even in the vidage Assembly Booms, were to be seen the eternal shelving beds, with their red-checked mounds of coverlets (for sitting-rooms, eating-rooms, and, indeed, drawing-rooms in Germany must do duty as sleeping-rooms also) ; whde at one end was a strip of a compartment, about as big as a church pew, which constituted another bed-chamber. Against the wall of this bed-closet stood a small piece of furni ture like an old deal wardrobe, which the Sehulz informed us was the venerable depository of the archives of the parish. It was opened, in state, by his worship the mayor himself, and on the door being thrown back was found to consist of a number of \" pigeon-holes,\" each of which was filled with a coUection of old brown papers\u2014 the colour of coffee \u2014and all covered with mice-dung ; while many of the documents had been half nibbled away by the same hungry little marauders. At the bottom of this cupboard was a row of old manuscript books bearing the date of 1700 and odd, and all relating to some legal process about some property at Kupfersuhl, which, said the mayor, had cost the community a lot of money; but whether the community had been"], [130, "108 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. gainers by it was more than his young worship could tell. Above these, in the cobwebby pigeon-holes, were bundles of dirty old newspapers, that threw up a cloud of dust as they were knocked against the doors previous to examining them. Then there were smoke-dried rolls of old parish accounts, the writing of which was as rusty with age as a country curate's coat, while the paper was as j-ellow and worm-eaten as the swathing-clothes of an Egyptian mummy. Indeed, as we turned over some of the leaves they cracked into flakes as if they had been made of pastry. Then there were old loose Actu/ns, or decrees, from the courts of law, of the previous centuries ; and letters that seemed to have been written in sepia, and in characters that required a profound scholar to decipher. It was no pleasant task to \" rummage \" through that musty, dusty, fusty collection of old parish docu ments, one by one, and leaf by leaf, with the pow dery particles irritating the nostrils and the throat, as if the air were fided with so much pepper. Yet the search was honestly and carefully carried out by all. The Bauer Kirchner was stdl as satisfied as ever that the Actum he had mentioned was there, and was confident that the words of it were that one of the Luthers had killed a man \" as dead as a mouse ;\" for that was a favourite phrase with them in those parts, he assured us, again and again, and we should soon see whether he was right. How long it took, or how much Schnapps it took, to have the dry, dusty work completed, it is idle to detail ; suffice it, that those same \" fore-standing\" men"], [131, "A DA*_'s SEARCH AMONG THE PAPERS. 109 of the parish searched and sipped, and sipped and searched, tdl the \" Barbarian Blackamoor \" was as dry as an old cow ; so that the enterprising landlord had to send for another half-thaler' s-worth of carraway liqueur over to Salzungen on the morrow. Nor did they cease till every page had been examined, and the faces of those same \"fore-standing\" boors were as swarthy with the dust as that of the sign of the \" Barbarian Blackamoor\" himself. The result showed that Herr Kirchner, the Bech nungs-Fiiltrer of the little Luther community, was right, and yet he was wrong. There was such an Actum as he had stated contained among the parisii documents ; still it was not the paper we had expected to find. Indeed, the date of the oldest manuscript treasured in the parish closet did not extend beyond the seventeenth century ; and as any Actum referring to Martin Luther's father must have been dated as far back as the fifteenth century (for it was not till 1483 that the miner and his family quitted the village, at which time, so far as we can make out, Martin's father must have been somewhere about four-and-twenty years of age), consequently there was no direct proof of the tradition to be obtained from the State-paper office of the little Luther community. Nevertheless, the search and the Schnapps were not utterly wasted ; for though, as we have said, nothing was proved by it directly, it put us in the possession of certain indirect evidence as to the probability of the story we had come to sift. For we found that the very same act of bloodshed as Hans Luther"], [132, "110 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. was said to have committed, had been perpetrated by two other members of this same Luther family in after years ; and that they, like Hans, had been forced to fly from their native village, in order to avoid the penalties of such an outrage ; and that their patri mony, like that of Martin's father, had also been impounded to meet the fines imposed by the State. The first of these manslaughters had been perpe trated by one Sebastian Luther, who was a soldier in the army of the Duke of Saxe-Meiningen, in the year 1715, and it was with reference to this offence that the Actum, found in the Mohra parish cupboard, had been drawn up ; for it was that document which the Bauer Kirchner had seen, and which he had imagined, from a hasty glance at the contents, to relate to the tradition which he knew to be current among his neighbours. The original paper was kindly presented to us by the burgomaster of the village immediately it was discovered, and we here append a literal translation of the curious old manuscript. 3 f c c = t fr e o u g fr o u t = t fr e = .<. i n g fr o in, anb fii i g fr . a n b \u25a0\u25a0 in e 1 1 . fr o e n Sir.

Of this same Sebastian Luther little or nothing was known among the Mohra boors, and it was only on consulting the genealogies with which we had come provided, that we were enabled to make out that he was a descendant of Hans the Little, the brother of Martin Luther's father, and some six generations re moved from the old miner's family. The second manslaughter committed by the de scendants of the same family was of so recent a date that it was still fresh in the memory of the villagers. The Bauer Kirchner related the tale to us, for his father had been present when the tragedy was enacted. Some fifty years ago there had been a christening feast held at the village inn. Among the guests were Johann George Luther and the smith of the hamlet. At such parties, especially in the olden time, drunkenness prevailed in a few hours. Now Johann George Luther had lost a whetstone, and the * The perpendicular line between the penultimate and the ultimate sentences of the above letter, extends in the original to the entire length of a sheet of foolscap, and was intended to show how much the writer considered himself inferior to the Highly- Honoured Mr. Chief Officer whom he was addressing."], [134, "112 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. smith, he had heard, had found it ; so Johann George, in the heat of the riot, taxed the blacksmith with having stolen it, and demanded that the village Vulcan should give it up to him. The smith insisted that \" findings were keepings ;\" whereupon the hot-blooded Luther knocked the other off his seat, and the man having a nail in his pocket, the sharp end of it pene trated his stomach as he fell, and inflicted a mortal wound upon him. After this Johann George Luther had to fly from his native village, as his elder had done before him \u2014 his property, like theirs, being con fiscated ; and when he came back to Mohra, in thirty years after the affray, he was without house and home or land, and died a mere pauper in the village of which his forefathers had been the lords. One other little chapter in the history of this strange and wayward Luther family, and we have done. Until w*ithin the last few years a branch of the Luthers flourished iu Kupfersuhl, the little mining village near which old Heinz Luther (Martin's uncle) had his smelting oven, and where Hans Luther himself (Martin's father) is said to have worked. Now, the last of the Luthers here, who was christened after the great Reformer himself, had sunk to be the jobbing butcher of the place, and had taken to inordi nate drinking (Martin, we know, loved wine and song, as well as any man) ; so that his child had been left to wander as a beggar from house to house through the country. The drunken butcher had been upbraided for his neglect of his own flesh and blood, and being still heated with his morning"], [135, "A DAY'S SEARCH AMONG THE PAPERS. 113 Schnapps, he retired a few moments previous to the dinner time, to the barn, at the back of the house in which he was living. His child was sent to him to tell him that the soup was getting cold; and no sooner did the little thing make its appear ance than the drunken maniac drew his butcher's knife across his own throat, first with one hand and then with the other, and fell almost headless on the floor at his offspring's feet. The tombstone of this same Martin Luther is the newest in the little churchyard of Mohra ; for Kup fersuhl itself is too small a hamlet to boast either church or cemetery. We saw the grave-mound with the snow lying thick upon it, and white as a child's pall ; and we heard the little bells that were set up over the painted inscription, recording that Martin Luther, who had died in the year 1861, \" slept at peace beneath it \" \u2014 we heard these bells, we say, jangle in the keen blast of the \" fore-winter,\" and we sighed as we thought of all the bloody strifes connected with that same wondrous, wild Luther family, in that same peaceful little Luther village. i VOL.

Heaven knows we have seen poverty and wretchedness enough in our own land ! \u2014 for years we made the study of it, and the investigation of all its phases, a special vocation ; nor did we fear, in order to work our purpose out, to fraternize with London beggars, and to mingle for many a day and night with London thieves. But we tell you, reader, we never saw such wretchedness, such squalor, such rude housing, such meanness in beggary, such utter want of truth and friendship in the terrible struggle to live, in the darkest dens, nor among the least luckless of the vagrants congregated in the British metropolis, as are to be found even in the families of the middle-class citizens of Saxony. In all the revelations we have made, no one, as yet, has risen up to say that we ever, in our long literary life, penned one line of untruth ; and though the reader may fancy we have some petty motive to serve \u2014 some paltry spite to vent against the Saxon nation \u2014 we tell him beforehand that it is but the most dishonourable of scribes who use their pen now-a-days to libel and vilify others. There is, thank God ! such a chivalrous feeling kindling in the breast of every author of mark in England, that we verily believe the foremost English writers of our own times can rank with"], [139, "\" BELOVED EISENACH.\" 117 English judges, not only in their respect for their vocation, but in the integrity of their works. But the reader will ask, perhaps, why should this harsh view of German life be given to the world ? We answer, why should we have troubled our head about the poor of London, if we had not some sense of human dignity in our heart \u2014 some wish to make the well-to-do think better and kindlier of the ill to-do; and some desire to teach even the wretched themselves how virtue and friendship and the de cencies of life, can be maintained as well by the humblest as by the proudest. So now we tell you, in all frankness, that our single purpose here is to hold such a plain-speaking looking-glass in the face of these starving, cringing, swaggering, German folk, that they shall see themselves in the same despicable guise as an EngUsh gentleman beholds them ; and feel how much they have to achieve \u2014 how much they have to learn \u2014 how much they have to alter, before they can pretend to take rank among the civilized nations of Europe ; or before even their nobles and their professional gentry can aspire to live as com fortably, as decently and as honourably, as even a working engineer with us. Now, reader, you know what we mean. You can, if you understand what it is to have a desire to see aU men as happy as yourself, comprehend why we wish to behold the great mass of the German people rise out of the state of serfdom and misery in which they are steeped to the very lips ; and why, if we say hard things about them, we do so merely to sting"], [140, "118 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. their pride to the quick, so that they may feel some little ambition to struggle out of the mire which encompasses them, and tlieir kindred, on every side. Nor do we write solely about the poverty of the proletarian portion of the nation. We deal rather with that order of the community which is said to constitute the backbone of every land : the middle class, who are neither stultified by the pride and luxuries of the aristocracy on the one hand, nor brutified by the wants and cares of the labouring population on the other. To this middle class we ourselves belong, and if we ever wandered out of it, we did so but to regard the other forms of life with the same eyes as a comparative anatomist loves to lay bare the organism and vital machinery of a zoophyte, or an ape, in the hope of linking together the lower and the higher forms of animal existence. Let us, however, first give you a brief description of the \" superior classes \" of the Saxon nation, so as to fit you, reader, for the better comprehension of the manners and customs of the professional and mer chant tribes of that countiy. The tales current all over the world as to the indi gence of the petty German princes are far from being fabulous : even the Germans delight to teU you how the Prince of Lippe's cavalry consists of two horses and three troopers, and how on \"field-days\" a plank has to be arranged between the couple of chargers, so that these same three gallant troopers may appear duly mounted on those same two hack war-horses,"], [141, "\" BELOVED EISENACH.\" 119 duly caparisoned (with cord bridle and stirrups) for the imposing occasion. How much truth, or how much badinage there may be in the anecdote we cannot certify, never having visited the principaldg (!) which is said to be hardly bigger than the Isle of Dogs. But we do know, from the avouchment of our own eyesight, that the cham bers of the palace at Eeinhardtsbrunn (where the Queen of England was located last autumn) were neither so decent, so tidy, nor so wefl-furnished as those of a model lodging-house in London. We had occasion to visit some members of the household during Her Majesty's residence at the mountain castle of the Duke of Coburg-Gotha, and the rooms we found our friends housed in were assuredly not half so comfortable as those of an English journey man carpenter. Not a strip of carpet was there to cover the rough boards of the floor ; and the furniture, which consisted merely of a wardrobe, a table, and a few chairs, would hardly have found a purchaser in our Broker's Alley. Indeed, every member of the Queen's establishment (male as weU as female), we know for a fact, was utterly horrified at the mere styes of dwellings that the German princes were will ing to feed and sleep in. And when we, in the hospitality of compatriotism, cheerfully consented to show some four-and-twenty of Her Majesty's retinue the sights and curiosities of the town in which we Avere resident, the whole conversation consisted merely of exclamations of surprise as to the squalor of the Use in Germany, as compared with the comfort of"], [142, "120 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. England. Of course facts were mentioned and particulars cited, of which the privacy of friendly intercourse precludes the publication ; suffice it that we, as an Englishman, who from our cradle had known somewhat of the comforts of Use, had to apologize for the comparative dog-hole in which they found us located \u2014 though our lodgings in Eise nach were admitted to be the finest in the town. Nevertheless, we could see the glance that each exchanged with the other, on their entrance into our bare-boarded desolate rooms ; and we knew in an instant how they were wondering within themselves that an Englishman, like ourselves, could consent to put up with fare and shelter which were hardly so good as those of a British mechanic earning his guinea and a half a-week by the sweat of his brow. So much for the amenities of the Duchy of Coburg- Gotha, Of that petty parish principaUty, however, we have but little special knowledge to enable us to speak, other than from the evidence of those who, being attached to the suite of the Queen of Eng land, naturally saw the best modes and fashions of the country. Of the Duchy of Saxe-Weimar, however, having been resident in it \u2014 to our long suffering \u2014 for many a month, we can prate more as suredly. Well : the Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar, as he is called, is a gentleman who has sovereign sway over a territory not much larger in dimensions, and hardly more fertile, than om own Salisbury Plain. An English nobleman's park, or the estate of a wealthy English commoner, would well comprise the"], [143, "\" BELOVED EISENACH.\" 121 full extent of the domains of \" His Serenity \" \u2014 for such is the title given by the German boobies and toadies to the petty autocrat of some hundred acres. In appearance this small mole-hill despot is as about as dignified as a linendraper's shopman in the British metropolis, delighting to wear the turban cap known as the \" pork-pie hat,\" which at the time of our quitting London was popular with every cheesemonger's apprentice ; and mantling his royal person with all the effete elegance of an \" Inverness cloak.\" So that as the German waiters are generally the first to lead the discarded EngUsh fashions in Saxony, it requires a somewhat lengthy residence in the country before you can make out whether the kellners at the principal hotels are, one and all, grand dukes of the farm-yard principality, or the Grand Duke himself one of the expensively-got-up gentry to whom you have lately given some five groschens as \" drink-money \" upon settling your account. To trouble English heads about such royal animal cul\u00e6 as these is beyond the vocation of any man who has brains enough at the back of his fingers to be able to wield a pen. An English author who has won his spurs, and knows that he can claim humble fellow ship \u2014 however slight \u2014 with Shakspere, with Newton, with Locke, with Fielding, with Wordsworth, with Scott \u2014 ay, and even with Dickens and Tennyson (the great minds by which every nation recognizes the British Empire rather than by its political poten tates and nobles) \u2014 feels that he has nothing in common with these petty chiefs of semi-barbarian districts ; and"], [144, "i o 2 J. r* ee. GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. knows that he would derive more worldly wisdom from an hour's communion with one of their over taxed and underfed boors than he could ever expect to hear uttered through the gaping mouths of such state-loving and paltry-minded royal (!) peasant-pro prietors. Now, this Grand-Duke of Saxe-Weimar extorts from out the beggars' wallets of his some few thou sand beggar subjects from twenty to thirty thousand pounds a-year, and with this he must needs maintain no less than a dozen trumpery castles, so that the half-witted folk of the land may think the dignity of a prince lies in his having a different home in every different hundred acres. The consequence is, that a man who might live like an EngUsh gentleman in one household has to keep up the state of a princely German beggar in twelve. How can we make Eng lish gentry believe that a large portion of the revenue of this same petty Saxon potentate is derived from the toll levied from every one of the sight-seers of the Castle of the Wartburg ? How can we convince \"proud Britons,\" as the Germans call iis, that his grand-dukeship pockets, with alacrity, the five gros chens which every weU-to-do tourist has to pay, and even the two and a half groschens demanded of the poor traveUing Handwerksburschen (journey-men artizans) who come to stare at the mit gingerbread trumpery of the Bitter Saal (knight's-haU) and the \" cooked \" antiquarianism of the old Luther Chamber ? For few, in England, will credit that a person who pretends to rank as a prince could resort"], [145, "\" BELOVED EISENACH.\" 123 (for the sake of five or two and a haU groschens per head) to the falsities that we have before exposed ; or consent (no matter wdiat might be the exigences of His Serenity's exchequer) to buy up old tables and old bedsteads at the cost of a few pence, and fudge them off upon his gaping, boorish subjects as the identical Lutheran furniture \u2014 when he knows in his own heart that the great Eeformer's legs and the great Eeformer's body had never been under the one or within the other. But so the German w*orld wrags. German princes see no indignity in keeping German \" hells,\" or in being tricky German showmen, and feel themselves no less than kings in cheating silly sight-seers out of their sixpences for a peep at the furbished frippery of reno vated ruins and tawdry tinsel glories of made-up relics. One of the great lions which the \" BerUn tailors \" flock annuaUy to stare at in these parts, is the pastoral palace at \"Wilhelm's Thai\" (WiUiam's Valley), wliich consists of a block of unadorned mud-buildings, whitewashed with the most primi tive notions of simplicity. To English eyes this so-caUed palace appears like the homestead of some British yeoman in the last stage of bankruptcy. The out-buildings are in such a tumble-down, untidy condition \u2014 and even the royal chambers in such a rickety state of repair \u2014 the grass of the would-be lawns surrounding the big barn-like hovel is so long, so rank, and so miserably tended \u2014 and the slushy, ungraveUed walks so beset with weeds \u2014 that any weU-to-do English gentleman-farmer"], [146, "124 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS would be utterly ashamed to acknowledge himself to be the owner and keeper of the place. Again : the wretched ragged labourers, boys, and women, that are found at work upon the untidy grounds have such a half-starved, mendicant air with them that a slave-owner of the Southern States of America would blush to have such haggard hinds among the coloured population of his estates ; while, on the other hand, the liveried lackeys that are to be met with, loitering about the road- side tavern \u2014 which at first sight strikes the visitor as being part of the palace itself \u2014 are as flashy and bedaubed with metallic lace as a sheriff's footman on Lord Mayor's Day. And yet, when you come to learn that these same theatrically-got-up serving-men are as wretchedly paid as even the ill-fed and tattered royal farm-labourers themselves \u2014 having no more than eleven thalers, or thirty-three shillings, a month, and out of that to pay for tlieir own board \u2014 a simple-minded English gentle man grows sick with the paltry, gaudy, trashy state of His pauper Eoyal Highness, and wonders why a decent-minded person would not believe it to be more to his credit (if he could not afford to pay better wages to the people about him), to strip the silver-lace off their backs, and put the value of it, as food, into his ill-fed retainers' stomachs. Is there a sweep on a May-day, in England, that would consent to play the king upon such mean, miserable terms ? Eemember the salary of this same grand Tom-fool, of Saxony, is that of the London Lord Mayor, or the EngUsh Lord ChanceUor, and"], [147, "\" BELOVED EISENACH.\" 125 then fancy how \" shabby-genteel \" the state of the sovereign must be who has but little better than a couple of thousand a-year to devote to the mainte nance of each of his dozen so-caUed palaces. Palaces ! Heaven save the mark : why, there is not one of them that is so well built, so commodiously fitted, or so comfortably furnished as was our own father's dwell ing \u2014 and he was a simple London attorney, maintain ing a plam and unpretentious English middle-class life; while as for the royal parks and gardens, those of our own brother at Ivew (though he lives but in the same state as is customary with English professional gentlemen) are a perfect Eden in comparison with the weedy, briary, ill-tended, and ill-arranged wilder nesses belonging to his grand dukeship. A German palace, indeed, is, at best, but an English eye-sore. Go where you will, the wattle-and-dab \"Castles ! \" as they are called, (Heaven save the mark !) are merely enormous mud-hovels \u2014 to Saxe Mein ingen, Saxe Weimar, Saxe Coburg-and-Gotha, Saxe Kartoffel-und-Salz, Saxe Holz-Pantoffeln, Saxe Sumps lander, Saxe Lehmliiitten, Saxe Lumperei, Saxe Schweinerie, and indeed, Saxe E very thin g-that-is- Trumperei. A poor-law Union, with us, is a place of comfort, neatness, and cleanliness to one of these Saxon Schlosses ; a model prison, fitted with a thousand-fold more modern conveniences and refine ments ; and a barrack, a noble and elegant building in comparison with it. A Birmingham lucifer match, or steel-pen manufactory covers a greater extent of ground ; a suburban Dissenting chapel is florid in its"], [148, "126 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. architecture alongside of it ; a nurseryman's grounds at Clapham Eise are more tasteful and trim than the gardens attached to it; and a heath, like that of Hampstead, or even the fens of Lincolnshire, as weU kept and laid out as is the \" Park \" (!) which adjoins it. The walls of a metropolitan common lodging house have been more recently wdiitewashed ; and the doors and windows of some deserted old \" haunted house \" more newly painted and glazed. In fine, there is no picturing in Avords, to English minds, the gaunt character of the ugliness and dreariness, as wTell as the squalid and tumble-down look of these foreign palatial barns. One of the infinite descendants of the equally in finite race of \" ould \" Irish kings, who is doomed, at the present day, to carry a hod on his shoulder, rather than a sceptre in his hand, would hardly con sent to live in such a desolate hovel ; the vagabond pro prietor of a traveUing menagerie with us, would think it necessary to have a greater number of comforts in his \" living caravan\" ; and the manager of a pro vincial theatre in England, possessing the smallest and shabbiest stock of supernumeraries, would be ashamed to parade such a mere handful of men, and such a tatterdemalion \" awkward squad \" as 'soldiers ! in any military spectacle. Further : the parish autho rities of the poorest metropolitan church would blush to have a beadle with as little stateliness, and as small a salary, as the Lord Chamberlain of many a German soi-disant \" Serenissimus ! \" Nor would any petty job master, at the sea-side, ever have the courage to send"], [149, "\" BELOVED EISENACH.\" 127 out such dirty shandredan \" open flys,\" with such spavined knackers, as many of the Grand Ducal state-carriages and steeds ; whilst a Jew slop-tailor in the Minories would be conscience-striken at in flicting so many fines and imposts upon his wretched work-people, as these same princely harpies are wont to screw in the shape of taxes, toUs, and penalties, out of their mere handful of German subjects. Indeed gadflies in summer never swarmed in such number about a dung-heap ; nor vermin in fested so profusely the rags of Irish beggars ; such greedy parasitical animalcules were never seen in a magnified drop of dirty water ; no insects at the time of a \" great blight \" ever coArered the land so thickly, or ravaged it so thoroughly, as the horde of petty swaggering bogtrotter potentates in this miser able, under-fed, and OArer-taxed \u2014 ground-doAvn and used-up \u2014 ill-conditioned and AveU-plucked \u2014 luckless, lifeless, spiritless, hopeless, and penniless \u2014 befuddled, beleagered, and benighted old Fatherland, or rather old Great-grandmother-land, of Germany. The bow-Avindow at Avhich we are writing over looks the \" Saturday's Market Place \" of Eisenach, and is within a few yards of the principal gateway of the toAvn. Every vehicle entering or quitting the city passes before our door ; and over and over again we haAre looked in wonderment at the unwashed shandredan \" turn-outs \" of the same pauper potentate of Saxe-Weimar rolling past our casement ; and we pledge our faith that a cheesemonger's chaise-cart, Avith us, is better cleaned, and the harness better"], [150, "128 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. polished, and the animal better fed and groomed than are the royal Saxon equipages. Indeed, Ave never saw one of this same Carl Alexander's vehicles go forth, but the wheels and the panels were as dirty as a German baroness' lace and hands in the morning, and the leathern caparisons as unblacked and as dusty as a vagrant's boots. To teU the plain truth, the German coxcombs Avho affect the \" fastness \" of English \" dog carts,\" English wagonettes, and English broughams, seem to have no notion that tidiness and cleanliness are qualities that every English \" whip \" believes to be the essential requisites of a \" neat tum-out.\" For in Saxony, where water is almost as scarce as money itself, and blacking comparatively unknoAvn, no nobleman or gentleman thinks it necessary that carriages should be Avashed or harness polished ; and the consequence is that not alone the post-carriages, but even the trumpery state equipages of the petty princes appear in the streets, day after day, as thickly covered Avith the dust of years as are the manuscripts in some old and unfrequented record office. Over and over again Ave have seen one of the prin cipal architects of the city drive past our windows in a chaise that a London costermonger Avould have con sidered it a disgrace to be seen in ; with the mended wheels unpainted for months, and one old broken kneed, \"wall-eyed\" pony fastened at the side of the bare uncoloured pole, which was intended for a pair of horses ; while the lining and trappings of the dirty old tumble-down \"turn-out\" were such as never could possibly be seen even among the night-cabs of the"], [151, "\" BELOVED EISENACH.\" 129 English capital. MoreoA^er, the thaler millionaire of the town (the one solitary manufacturer and merchant of the place), who is supposed to live in the grandest possible style, and whom the simple, boorish citizens look upon as a positive Cr\u0153sus in Avealth, and a D'Orsay in the elegance of his tastes, consents to ride in A'ehicles that are as rude as a sea-side fly. Cart horses proper are, of course, utterly unknown in a land where cows are still used as the principal draught animals ; so that eAren the state black horses of the Grand Duke himself continuaUy make their appearance in the street harnessed to the royal lug gage Avaggons, and not unfrequently are to be seen dragging the ducal dung-carts. Indeed, the carriage horses of Saxony are the cart-horses proper of Eng land, while it is merely the future beef of the country that has to drag the heavier loads along the highways. \"Ah!\" said an English lady to us, as she Avas sighing over the heaAry loads that the cattle and the women are made to carry in Germany, \" there are two things here that I thank Heaven I was neArer born to be : and they are a German cow and a German woman; for the German men seem to regard their Avives and their kine as the only beasts of burden in the land.\" The Castle of the Wartburg, again, Avhich is another of the shoAv-places of the country in which we lived, has more historic associations than architec tural beauty connected with it. True, there are some fine odd bits of Byzantine detail about the quaint capitals of its columns ; but, as a Avhole, the edifice is VOL. I.

This Avas the site of the \" Singers' contest,\" which is said to have been held among the German trouba dours of the Middle Ages, and at which the fabled Tannhauser is recorded to have carried off the prize. It Avas at the Wartburg, moreover, that Martin Luther was concealed as Junker George (Squhe George) after the Diet of Worms, Avhen the papal bigots were hunt ing for the \" heretic \" monk through the length and breadth of the land. And it was here, in the little cabin, that noAV goes by the name of the \" Luther chamber\" in the old knights' house, that Martin Avrote his translation of the Bible. So that there are charming associations enough in connection with the castle to give it a natural beauty, and make every gentleman of the least taste regret that the present"], [153, "\" BELOVED EISENACH.\" 131 Grand Duke \u2014 who can see no grace in the world but in tinsel and trumpery \u2014 should ever have had. the power, or the opportunity, of transforming what was a few years back a lovely and reverend ruin, into a mere theatrically-embeUished music-haU, Avhere acres of Dutch metal glitter with aU the colours of an oilman's shop-front; or that he should have lacked the decency not to leave even the interesting Uttle Luther chamber untouched, instead of stocking it with reUcs that are as tricky as those of a Eoman Catholic shrine.

The rest of the smaU fry that make up the ignoble nobles of the Saxe-Weimarish territory are very much of the same kidney as the LilUput \" Serenissimus\" himself. If such be the state, and such the mounte bank grandeur of the lord paramount of the land, any quick-witted person can readily understand how Uttle true dignity is to be found among the \" beggar barons \" of the same country. Indeed, the German nobilit}r, from time immemorial, haATe never ranked very high in the eyes of Europe, nor even in those of their own countrymen. History teaches us that in the Middle Ages the Teutonic lords were no better than titled highwaymen ; eATery schoolboy knows, too, how Rudolph of Hapsburg hanged some scores of the baronial brigands, during his reign in Germany, for their thefts and murders ; so that hardly an old castle ruin is uoav to be seen in any of the princi palities, of Avhich you are not told, on asking the people of the neighbourhood as to the \" antecedents \" of the place, \" Oh ! it Avas oidy some ancient knight's ' mouse-hole' \" (the German word ' mouzing' being the vernacular term for plundering), \" and the barons who lived in it were nothing more than ' raub-thier,' (rob-"], [157, "\" THE BEGGAR BARONS.\" 135 bing animals).\" Nor is it much better at the present day : for if you walk out to some of the suburban vil lages, and inquire of your German companion by the way who lives here or there, he will be almost sure to inform you that yonder little hovel of a homestead belongs to one of their\" Bettel-barons\" (beggar barons) ; and that this petty hostelry, Avhere cheese and beer are dispensed to the viUagers, is the property of one of the richest of the Tons in those parts \u2014 the Lord of Neuenhof being, among other things, simply a small brewer and cheesemonger, and owning the tavern and the dozen mud-cottages that make up the ATillage. Then, again, this Uttle farm, Avith its feAv adjoining acres, that would but constitute a peasant-proprietor in England, and which assuredly a Cumberland hind would object to Uve in, is the so-caUed \"Bitter-gut\" (Knight's estate) of some von Betler or other, yielding the noble knight the stately income of two hundred thalers (\u00a330) every year. To spring from such a stock, or, indeed, in any way to belong to an order of robbers and beggars, assuredly no English gentleman would consider an honour; and to do the more sensible Germans justice, we must confess that the most respectable portion of the citizens not only laugh at, but utterly despise, their trumpery shirtless \" Adds \" \u2014 for your true German noble seldom wears more linen than a \" dicky,\" his elaborate shirt-front being a front, and nothing more.

We are neither red-republicans, nor socialists, in our heart ; nor do we belieATe that the political world is to be set right by the helter- skelter work of revolutions ; and we do opine that if you pulled any country to pieces, and made aU folk in it equal to-morrow, the same petty class distinc- tions, as now prevail in e.*ery civilized land, Avould be found to take root, and flourish again in a A*ery few years. When it is possible to weed pride and envy out of the human heart, then it may be pro- bable that universal egalite and fraternise may have more than a twelvemonth's reign. But admitting that stars and garters are as necessary for the internal peace of a nation, as are the bright beads which the Indian squaw hangs at her back to please and quiet her little papoose ; still, we see no reason Avhy the stellar universe should so encompass every land, that every little trumpery proprietor of a few acres should be made a celestial god of, and raised to the dignity of the heavenly constellations, as were the great mythological heroes of old.

Accord ing to Campanus, avIio Avas one of the apostolic Nuncios in the Middle Ages, the whole country then Avas one A*ast den of titled robbers ; for he says, \" the greater the noble, the greater the thief.\" Again, Poggio Bracciolini, Avho Avas another Papal emissary, writing at about the same period tells us : \u2014 \" Every man in Germany who lives on his own property, in some burg or viUage remote from the towms, is caUed a * noble.' Of this class, a great number are addicted to open plunder.\" Moreover, Dunham, in his \" His tory of the German Empire,\" informs us that \"the medi\u00e6val nobles termed that chivalry which the com mon people called robbery. To live as knights VOL. i. e"], [168, "146 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. meant neither more nor less than to live by rapine. In the estimation of the nobles, simple theft Avas, assuredly, odious,\" he adds; \"but it was so only be cause the property was taken in a cowardly manner.\" In very early times, however, the old Teutonic tribes are said to have been a free and honest people, living in the woods, and ruled by no hereditary despot. Some historians speak of them as consisting of as many different repubUcs as there were separate tribes, and having no one chief to govern the whole, except in the time of war. In those days, the Dux, or Brinceps (the Herzhog or Burst, as the Germans caUed him), was elected or chosen by the united freemen, who were the only persons in the State that took rank as Jlomiaes ; for aU engaged in any branch of industry or commerce Avere classed as res, non persona? (things, not persons), avIio, in legal language, had no peculium, being regarded merely as beasts of burden \u2014 for they could possess no property whatever apart from their lords. Indeed, they were bought and sold Arith the land like cattle, and are even spoken of as having been yoked. \" Let every man know his own team of men, horses, and oxen,\" says an ancient MS. In wills, too, they ay ere bequeathed, as a man now dis poses of his plate and money. Such Avas the state of the great body of the Saxon people previous to the Carlovignian era, that two-thirds at least, or, accord ing to some, three-fourths, of the entire community were merely the goods and chattels of then- masters. True, the principal affairs of the country were regu lated by Plaids (Blacita regni), or, in other words,"], [169, "\" THE BEGGAR BARONS.\" 147 by half-yearly Parliaments or Diets, in which the higher nobles only had the right of voting; the lower ones, and such freemen as Avere entitled to bear arms, being permitted to attend there to applaud the decisions of the others. The nobles themselves, we are told, were far too haughty to do other than hunt and make Avar. They scorned all industrial occupa tions\u2014arts as AveU as commerce \u2014 and looked upon any kind of labour as fit only for beasts. They dwelt in fortified places, buried in vast forests, with a host of slaAres and Avarriors about them, ready to pounce down upon and plunder any traA^elling merchant who might cross their territories, on the Avay to some distant fair. So proud, too, were they of haAdng been free-born, that any of their class marrying with vil leins or hinds were themselves doomed to perpetual bondage. In the reign of Louis le Debonnaire (a.d. 814 840), however, the election of the Dukes began to be discontinued. Originally, the chief dignities through out the German nation were, as Ave haAre said, elective, and titles were inseparable from jurisdiction of some kind or other ; and though the choice generally fell upon the heir or next of kin after the decease of any of the dignitaries, tiU the offices had all the appear ance of being hereditary, each territorial ruler, never theless, had only a life-interest in the fief. But in the ninth century the power of the Dukes had so in creased that they were able to declare their titles to be perpetual; whereupon even the petty princes began to assume the authority of monarchs \u2014 coining l 2"], [170, "148 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. money, having exchequers of their own, swords of state being carried before them, and Uving in preten tious royal pomp. Hence, instead of their offices and estates lapsing, as formerly, to the nation on the death of the previous possessor, it came to pass that every Duke's eldest son got to inherit, as a right, the title and lands of his father ; while his second son became a nominal count, and the others nominal barons. But, in the course of years, so obnoxious had it grown to the beggarly pride of the petty German Dukes, and other self-styled nobles, to hand down to posterity any being less titularly-grand than themselAres, that they ordained, in the fourteenth cen tury, that, while their estate should become the inhe ritance of the eldest son alone, all the co-heirs should alike be at liberty to assume the title of the family ; and thus every one of the sons of a duke, with the exception of the first-born, came to be nominal dukes, Avithout any estates whatever (instead of mere counts and barons, as in the ninth century) ; whilst the younger male children of every count in the country got to be nominal counts, and those of barons nominal barons in the same manner, Avithout even an acre or a \" dog-hole \" to maintain their fancied dignity.* * This is the name of the subterranean dungeons with which every German noble's castle was fitted in the olden time, and into whieh the wretched merchants whom they had seized and plundered were thrown, and allowed to remain, until such time as an exorbitant ransom was paid fur their liberty. The ruins of the robber-castles on the Rhine and in other parts of Germany show how prevalent was the custom of entombing all the pri soners who became subject to the tender mercies of these"], [171, "\" THE BEGGAR BARONS.\" 149 Accordingly, in a few years afterwards, the nation got to swarm Avith the beggarly lack-land sons of dukes, counts, and barons, as thick as rats in a barn, and Avho, though they bore the name of knights, wTere merely a horde of armed vagrants, or titled brigands, that no sooner had received the \"baldric\" than, in the words of Peter of Blois, \" they began to turn their weapons against those whom they had sworn to protect, to pillage and lay wraste the substance of the poor, to plunder the domains of the Church, to rob the merchants, and mercilessly torment the unfor tunate;\" until, as a modern historian teUs us, \"it came to pass that a German knight was but another name for bandit, and a count or duke for that of the baronial or ducal highwaymen.

At the old ducal castle at Baden-Baden, again, one sees the same atrocious palace fittings ; and history tells us that the dukes of this country were wont to bring forth such prisoners as they had made in their pre datory excursions and to command them to kiss the Virgin (baiser la Vierge) as a proof of the truth of what they had spoken ; and immediately the poor creatures approached the wooden image, with the view of embracing it, the platform under their feet gave way, and their bodies were precipitated to the bottom of the well beneath, to be torn to pieces by the \" devil,\" or wheel set with knives, that was kept for ever turning there by a stream at the base of the rock."], [172, "150 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. chiel of the bandits ; Avhile chivalry and nobility were, in Germany, at least, but cloaks for robbery and oppression.\" This state of things continued tiU the towns leagued together to protect themselves against the incursions of the brigand aristocracy ; and at the end of the thirteenth century the system of piUage by the robber and beggar-barons had risen to such a height that the Emperor Rudolph of Hapsburg razed, as we have said, in one year no less than seventy of the Baub-schlosser (robber-palaces), and condemned to death several score of the noble highwaymen. It can hardly be said that the same state of things prevails in Germany at the present day. The open plunder and outrages of the nobles have, of course, in this age of police, utterly ceased. Nevertheless, the petty princes, and paltry kingly dukes, who have not half the possessions, nor a tithe of the refine ment, of a wealthy English commoner, persist in styling themselves Serenissimi, and \" kingly high nesses,\" and in coining their own money, till the country is flooded Avith plated groschens and kreutzers, and greasy paper thalers, that no peasant even will look at two miles away from their own territories \u2014 in having each a Lord Chamberlain, to Avhom they pay hardly the wages of an English coachman, and who, consequently, has the manners of an Irish clod hopper \u2014 in maintaining an army of plough-boys, who are obliged to spread themselves out at parade, like the supernumeraries at a cheap theatre, so as to"], [173, "\"THE BEGGAR BARONS.\" 151 appear anything more formidable than the \"awkward squad \" commanded by the Hauptman von Bombastes Furioso ; and who have merely such a diet of black bread and soup doled out to them as Avould create a rebellion in an English workhouse. Indeed, these Yvetot monarchs, as glorious old Beranger has styled them, still continue to play the grand Tom fools Extraordinary, till the Avhole of enlightened Europe sits agape in wonder as to how any nation of men with brains bigger than walnuts, or spirits prouder than shoeblacks, should be found ready and Avilling to duck their heads in token of respect to the mere tAvopence-halfpenny potentate avIio has enthroned himself upon some German molehill, and is the laughing-stock (like the stuffed dummy set up in a bean-field to frighten smaU birds) of every being who has seen anything more majestic than a beadle at a parish church.

They have, moreover, the same scorn for all indus trial occupations as distinguished their penniless fore fathers ; and, now that they are prevented plundering, have merely then way to make in the world by finvn ing and sycophancy to those even meaner natures who can find pleasure in seeing the human hounds lick the dust from their feet.

The feudal customs and privileges in connection with the baronial class continued even down to the year 1848 \u2014 so far is Germany behind the more enlightened nations of Europe, and so little in advance is it, indeed, of the barbarous tribes of Eussia. Until the year of the revolutions, when every German potentate Avas ready to swear anything and everything the people Avished of him, and to break the oath in the coolest possible manner as soon as the nine-days' fury for national freedom had passed away, all the lords of the soil who ruled over the mud villages in their neighbourhood had power to force the peasants to work for them at certain times of the year. At one season the Baiters Avere compeUed to go out in the Avoods and cut and carry timber for their lord; at others they had to collect the dried leaves from the forest, and to stack them for the use"], [180, "158 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. of his lordship's cattle during the Avinter ; at others, again, their av_ \\*es and children had to wend their way to the fields and clear the stones from the baron's land, or else to help to make the hay or get in the harvest, At such times the laAV empowered the viUage baron or count, as the case might be, to force every one in the hamlet \u2014 men, women, and children \u2014 to do his work for him without the least fee or reward, and those avIio refused he had the right of imprisoning in the Frohnen-feste (literally, the drudgery-cell) for some two, three, or more days, according' to the nature of the offence.* This Frohnen-feste in Eisenach Avas situate in the old Eoman gate caUed the Xicolai Thurm, and in other parts of the country it consisted of a dungeon or dog-hole attached to the baron's mud-hovel of a castle. In '48, hoAvever, such feudal privileges were, luckily, swept away. In some places the village com munity gave a round sum to get rid of the lord's right of \" soccage \" for eA*er ; in others the compensa tion consisted of a yearly gift of corn, fowls, or eggs * In the olden time the feudal lords of Thuringia were in the habit of sending an overseer with the gangs of villagers who had to do the barons' work, and the vassal stood by the others with a whip in his hand, after the fashion of the modern slave drivers in America, to lash the lazy or unwilling among the men, women, or children into extra exertion. Moreover, in the time of Lud wig the Iron, who was one of the landgraves in the 12th cen tury, it was the fashion to yoke the peasants, like oxen, to the barons' ploughs. The romantic incident which led to the abolition of this barbarous practice now forms the subject of one of the Thuringian legends, and will be found narrated hereafter."], [181, "\"THE beggar barons.\" 159 from the different houses ; and it will be seen here after, when we come to speak of the taxes paid by the people of Eisenach, that many iioav have to pay a certain sum annuaUy in lieu of the \" cock and hen \" tax imposed upon their dwehings. The majority of even the weU-to-do German nobles are merely small country farmers, who would hardly be aUowed to rank as yeomen in England ; and, assuredly, the houses in which they live, though they go by the name of \"palaces\" or \"castles\" in the country, are such as no English farmer with even 100 acres to cultivate would consent to pig in. A Saxon village, indeed, even with the Saxon lord's wattle-and dab tumble-doAvn mansion at the end of it, is such a picture of the most abject dirt, misery, and squalor as no Englishman can possibly conceive ; and even though we were at the trouble to pay a special visit to the farms kept by the richest noblemen in the vicinity of Eisenach \u2014 such as those of Mittelshof and Nuenhof, the proprietors of Avhich both ranked as thaler-millionaires in the country \u2014 we found them in such a state of filth, untidiness, and discomfort as could not possibly exist eAren in the poorest Aullages of England. At Nuenhof, indeed, the coavs Avere all suffering from disease ; and no Avonder, for the shed in Avhich some three-score of the poor beasts were staUed Avas utterly deficient in ventilation, and the floor clamp with the animals' excreta that must have been left there for days together. The barons' dwel lings, again, Avere utterly wanting in all those signs of neatness, cleanliness, and comfort which are the"], [182, "160 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. characteristics of an English homestead\u2014 and, indeed, such bare-boarded, half-furnished places as make an English gentleman shudder to contemplate. Nor did the feudal customs of Thuringia prevail only among the lords of the soil. The trades' cor porations, or Zunfts, as they were called, were equally despotic in tlieir privileges, and these continued even down to the end of the year IS 62 ; up to which time every apprentice who did not take off his cap to a master or journeyman in the street AATas subjected to a sound box on the ears, and had his Miilze torn from his head and dashed to the ground. Nor could an apprentice smoke a pipe, or even dance at a baU, until he had served his time. Then a feast Avas held, and the quondam Leh rj tinge was formally admitted to the rights of a journeyman. A certain piece of work, known as the Gesell-sliick (i. e. journeyman's piece), had to be executed, and in some cases brought in to the assembled masters and men upon a neAv German silver plate ; and Avhen the work had been pronounced satisfactory, a long pipe, decorated with ribbons, was presented to the new Gesell, and he was permitted to smoke for the first time. After this a glass of beer Avas placed at his side, Avhen he Avas expected to knock Avith his knuckles on the table before drinking, and to say, \"Mit Gvnst, Meistem und Gesellen\" (With your leave, masters and journeymen). Then the corpora tion-box was opened in his presence, and the silver drinking-cup and trade papers taken out with great ceremony, the united company standing up the while, aU with then- hats on (for caps are not aUowed to be"], [183, "\" THE BEGGAR BARONS.\" 161 Avorn on such occasions), each with a walking- stick in his hand, and with only three buttons of his coat fastened; for if any had appeared with his coat buttoned in two or four places, he Avould have been fined or reprimanded as being unacquainted Avith the Hand werlis-gebrauche (trade usages). Nor, until the end of last year, could any workman set up for himself in any trade until he had executed some appointed Meister-sluck. For this purpose he had to be locked up in a room by himself for three days at the house of the master of the guild, Avhere he Avas exjDected to treat the journeymen, and the master himself, most liberally with cigars, sausage, and beer aU the Avhile \u2014 else there was no hope of the work being passed ; whilst, on the other hand, let him be as sorry a workman as he might, if he only gave plenty to eat, drink, and smoke, the others were sure to help him through with his labour. Noav, in a country where such silly and semi barbarous feudal customs prevailed, even until within a few months of the present time, the reader can readily understand what must be the enlightenment of the nation, what the Uberty of the people, and what the refinement of the nobles, Avho swarm on every side as thick as gadflies about a mixen. 0 \"educated Germany\"! 0 land of Schiller and Gothe ! \u2014 when will your people rank above the hordes of Eussia in freedom, comfort, dignity, and civilization ? VOL. I. M"], [184, "CHAPTEB III. THE CITIZEN LIFE OF EISENACH. AVe once passed a quiet hour or two Avith a slave owner from the Southern States of America ; even as we at one time hob-a-nobbed with Calcraft, the London hangman \u2014 so delightful is it to the moral comparative anatomist of the world to study every form and phase of human life and human character; and the slave owner told us that if the Southerners caught Charles Dickens among them again, they would hang him up to a tree as they would a dog \u2014 and indeed, as they had already hanged many a Methodist parson, for the simple offence of evincing some sympathy with the miseries of the slave population. Now against Charles Dickens we have written hard words for his literary tricks and shortcomings, and yet no Eng lish critic can have a greater respect for his out speakings, and the generous qualities of his genius, than has the writer of these lines. And even as Dickens found it necessary, in the manliness of authorcraft, to say his say against the degradation of American slavery, so do Ave think it requisite, in the honesty of penmanship, to speak om* mind concerning the abjectness of the \" superior classes \" of a race that once claimed kindred with EngUsh folk them-"], [185, "THE CITIZEN LIFE OF EISENACH. 163 selves. The truth, indeed, must out ; for Ave write as Ave have always written \u2014 not Avith a view to degrade mankind, but to make them, so far as it lies in our humble power, kindlier and better towards each other ; to get them to soften down the cursed petty class-distinctions of the world ; to induce them to be lieve that they are Avhat they are, not from any merit of tlieir own, but simply from the inscrutable decrees of the incomprehensible Providence above us : and to cease tossing their noses in the air because God Almighty willed them a sev. more groschens or an ounce or two more brains than their less lucky feUow creatures. In Germany these accursed class-distinctions haA'e infinitely greater sway than in our own country, so that even a serving-maid, if you ask her Avhether she means to be present at the ball at the \" Angel Tavern,\" wiU turn upon her heel as she tells you that she, indeed, never condescends to dance in any society beneath that of the \" Blackamoor \" public-house ! So is it, too, Avitli the petty gentry and tradespeople \u2014 the social swine are styed off at the club called the \" Erholung,\" the civic sheep folded at the \" Klemda \"; nor Avill the one class of stupid animals either feed or herd with the other. The \" Erholung \" is the society of the commoners of Eisenach, and they draw the line (like the penny barber Avho objected to shave the dust man) of their exclusiveness at any form of servitude ; admitting not even a decent shop-girl into their ranks, because they can see no distinction between a maid who is engaged to hand you confectionery over m 2"], [186, "164 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. a counter, and one avIio consents to scrub your floors and empty your slops at so much per quarter. On the other hand, the more aristocratic \" Klemda \" is Avilling to open its doors to the apprentices and \" counter-skippers \" at the several little chandlers' and linendrapers' shops distributed throughout the town ; regarding such shop-boys as embryo merchants, and believing, in the simplicity of their arcadian Uves, that they are fit associates for officers and gentlemen. Nor should we, indeed, draw attention to such paltry social divisions, or condescend to speak of one form of life as being either superior or inferior to that of another, were it not to point out that these same so-called genteel folk haA'e no sense as to what constitutes the real dignities and meannesses of human vocations. We wiU frankly confess to the reader that we have a '.high respect for any one avIio earns his living by his own industry, and comparatively a low esteem for the great multitude of small-trading folk who hve, generaUy speaking, by adding nothing to the wealth of the community, and AA*hose gains are, for the greater part, got by depreciating the goods of those who come to seU to them, and by lying and cringing to those who come to buy of them. For the man avIio lives by mere huckstering and dealing, by cutting down and crying up, so as to get his penny profit out of both the producer and consumer, Ave haA^e little respect, and therefore Uttle care to fraternize Avith the class. We Avould more willingly drink our coffee in company with an enlightened mechanic than we would with the"], [187, "THE CITIZEN LIFE OF EISENACH. 165 proudest \" pushing tradesman \" in the world \u2014 satisfied that we should learn much more from the hard handed and skilful artizan than we could eA'er possibly get out of the brains of the mere haggling, chaffering, forestaller of the world's markets. In England, however, where merchantry is some thing beyond that of mere pedlar's work, and where the wholesale dealers are aUowecl to rank almost with the gentry and professional classes of the community, the extent of the commercial dealings necessarily precludes the despicable faAvning manners and the contemptible cheating tricks of the A*ulgar shop keeper ; so that in a country famed all over the world for the high honour as weh as Arast enterprise and means of its \" merchant princes,\" there is no wonder that such a class should have aU the chivalrous feelings and the refined tastes of true gentlemen, rather than be remarkable for the cleA*er chicanery and vulgar upstart qualities of mere tradesmen ; and that, therefore, they should be aUowed to associate with gentlefolk, and to hold communion with the wisest and least-mercenary portion of EngUsh society, as well as to claim friendship with those, indeed, who give the moral tone to the civilization of the entire world, such as the members of our Parliament, our judges, and our professional and thinking classes in general. But in Saxony, where, as we have said, the barons are little better than beggars, the reader can readily un derstand that the tradesmen are about as high-minded and as dignified in their bearing, and as upright in their dealings as coal and potatoe-shed keepers and"], [188, "166 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. marine-store dealers in London. The principal com mercial emporiums in Eisenach are nothing better than so many village chandlers' shops, where bells jangle behind the doors from six in the morning until ten at night, with the occasional dropping-in of the solitary customers, and where everything is sold \u2014 dried herrings, wire, writing-paper, lucifer-matches, peas and beans, tobacco, cheese, lamp-oil, copperas, soda, schnapps, glue, \" glauber-salz,\" slate pencils, sugar candy \u2014 and indeed the whole of the long catalogue of miscellaneous articles that are usually dispensed in pennyworths (though in the Thuringian capital the orders seldom exceed farthings' worths) to the \" hand-to-mouth \" portion of every petty commu nity. Now, we do not pretend to be particularly punc tiUous, and we are ready to admit that every decent mannered and decent-minded person, no matter what his vocation in life may be, has a perfect right to claim equality with ourselves. Moreover, we can con scientiously say that we never tossed our head in the air, or turned upon our heel, when the hand of a good and honest enlightened English artizan was ex tended to us in friendship ; but, on the contrary, have sat many an hour beside our handicraftsmen in their workshops, wondering, as we delighted to see them fashion the rudest materials into the most elegant and ingenious commodities, whether their form of labour was one jot less worthy of respect than our own. Nevertheless, we AviU frankly confess to the reader that there are some limits to our sense of good fellowship, and that we did not care to see our daughter"], [189, "167 THE CITIZEN LIFE OF EISENACH. dance round the ball-room of the \" Klemda \" with the ignorant boobies of chandlers' shopkeepers, Avho, but a few hours before, had been engaged in serving out three pfenning- worth of coffee or sugar, or haggling over a halfpenny- worth of birdlime or sardines in their dingy, grubby, foul-smelling stores ; nor were we in any way pleased to see a girl of ours waltzing with the fawning young linen-drapers' shopmen belonging to the \" IQemda \" club, and who, despite the quantity of rose hair-oil with which they had polished up their locks (till tlieir matted hair was as thickly clotted Avith grease as the axle-box of a railway-wheel), still smelt insufferably of the perfume of the less fragrant flannel or oil-cloth, or India-rubber goloshes, or mack intosh, or canvas, whicli but an hour or too previously, they had been packing up before closing the shop for the night. But, before introducing the reader to the amenities of the middle class of life in the Eesidenz Stadt, or palatial town of Eisenach, let us give him some sense of the extent, the character, and the appearance of the Thuringian capital itself. In its length and breadth, then, Eisenach is about of the same dimensions as the little suburban hamlet of Hampstead with us. It consists of hardly more than two long straggling principal streets \u2014 the one at right angles to the other ; the first stretching to the full length of the \"back- slum \"-like string of buildings, and the second extending along the ex treme breadth of the town. The style of dwell-"], [190, "168 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. ings is very much similar to those of the tumble down tenements which constitute the Jews' Quarter in Frankfort \u2014 indeed, the principal thoroughfare, the Eue de Eivoli, or Eegent Street, of Eisenach was formerly the Jews' Alley ; and, if the reader is acquainted Avith the character of the Hebrew districts of large crowded capitals, such as our Duke's Place or HolyweU Street, Avhere the old clothes'-men and marine store-dealers delight to congregate, he may form some faint conception of the elegance not only of the Eisenach shops, but of the Eisenach architec ture in the principal quarter of the city. An English friend who paid us a visit here, told us, on our taking him his first Avalk through the toAvn, that it gaA'e him a notion that he was continually parading down a series of London mews, and that he was always wondering when he Avas to eome to the front of the houses and the streets themselves. An English lady, on the other hand, who had been residing in the place for some twelve months preAnous to our taking up our quarters in it, informed us that we should find it was merely one large farmyard, made up of so many Irish cottier-Uke habitations. Indeed, if Ave wrote our pen to a stump Ave could not better the description of that same quick-Avitted and kindly EngUsh gentlewoman : for as you walk down the main thoroughfares in the autumn, the flail is always heard beating away like the pendulum to a big church clock, and the streets for ever resound Arith the squeal ing of fettered pigs driven through the highways. One of the first sounds that salute the ears in the morning"], [191, "TIIE CITIZEN LIFE OF EISENACH. 169 is the \" ranz des vetches\" as the herdsman coUects the coavs and goats that are kept in the yards at the back of almost aU the dweUings ; even as the last noise in the evening is sure to be the cracking of the cow herd's heavy Avhip, as he brings the kine home again to the city, and the creatures go scampering off to their stalls through the street-doors and doAvn the passages of the houses of the innkeepers and bakers, the petty tradesmen, and even the lawyers and doctors, them selves ; whilst at the fall of the year, when the fields have to be strewn Avith manure for the next twelve month's crop, the dung-heaps at the back of each house are emptied and thrown out into the middle of the principal thoroughfares \u2014 the furrier, the tinman, the bookseller, the milliner, the goldsmith, the grocer, the watchmaker, being one and all more intent upon looking after their muck-heaps than either the litera ture, the fashions, or the jeweUery which the astute stranger might fancy to constitute their principal busi ness. At that season of the year, indeed, the high ways reek to nausea with the stench of the filth that lies littered in front of every door, tiU the sleepy ox waggons have time to carry it off in vehicles, which are hardly more capacious than a navigator's wheel barrow ; so that the lady pedestrian has to pick her Avay through it, day after day, with her chess in one hand, and her pocket-handkerchief in the other. Such, too, is the mania for pig-keeping in Eisenach, that we verily believe there was not a hovel in the town that had not its couple of coarse, wild-looking Hungarian porkers styed up in dark boxes no bigger"], [192, "170 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. than a sea-chest, and with no more light or air than the Black Hole at Calcutta. Not a master-cabinet maker but had his pair of hogs stowed among his timber-sheds at the rear of his meubles magasin. The watchmaker, who not only himself repaired the dials of the citizens, but whose wife made the bonnets and head-dresses for their fraus and daughters \u2014 even he could find it either profitable or pleasant to neglect his double business for the feeding of pigs and growing of his own sausages. The palace-glazier, the palace-silversmith, the palace-bootmaker \u2014 in a word, the palace-everything, even down to the palace chimneysweep \u2014 all had a pig-stye at their back doors ; and, so far as we know, the professors, the parsons, the advocates, and even the Lord Cham berlain himself, thought pig-rearing and pig-killing more attractive than either learning, religion, law, or the fascinations of courts. For we verily believe there was but one man in this same town of Eisenach who did not throw his whole soul out of his busi ness, and into \" swineflesh \"\u2014and he was the palace linendraper and money-changer ; but then it should be added that he was an Israelite also, so that it was merely the religious prejudices of the worthy Avhich prevented him from taking part in the national pastime. As we sit at our window writing, another sharp squeal under our casement tells us that a tethered pig is being driven down the most fashionable street of the town \u2014 for our bow-A\\dndoAv looks up the entire length of the little thoroughfare. And now mark, as"], [193, "THE CITIZEN LIFE OF EISENACH. 171 the driver lashes the animal with his whip, and one's ears are split Avith the sharp squeaks, that sound as shrill as if there was a knife-grinder at Avork below, how all the principal boor-citizens come streaming out of tlieir shops, the tanneries, and the taverns, to have a look and a pinch at the back of the lusty-lunged hog. See ! there is tanner-master Fiessinger, Avithout any hat, and in his felt slippers, standing and talking to the peasant owner of the animal. We can almost hear him say, \" Halloo ! cousin, where is he from ? \" and before the big-caped driver has time to reply, the \"thick Pabst,\" as the corpulent chandler's shop keeper facing our window is called, makes his appear ance in an embroidered fez-cap, a pair of Berlin worked slippers, and without any cravat about his neck ; and then as he stands at his little shop door, wrapping up a cornichon of dried apple-chips, he, too, shouts to the driver, \"What costs such a one ? \" Now Ave catch sight of the bald head of the \"palace privileged apothecary,\" whose dispensary stands at the opposite corner of the street (for he, too, must run out from serving some of the neighbouring vil lagers) ; and as he proceeds to arrange the long label about the neck of the bottle of cough mixture he holds in his hand, he cries, \" Good clay, cousin, hoiv heavy is such a porker ? \" Next comes the Avatch maker, Avho has started up from his seat at his shop window, where he generaUy sits cleaning the works of some old time-piece ; and he rushes out habited in a long greasy dressing-goAvn and slippers, to know how old the creature is. Facing this one lives the Herr"], [194, "172 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Advocat Selzer, avIio, hearing the well-known cry, has hurried down from his papers to take part in the examination and inquiries as to the condition and price of the animal ; and he, too, is still in his dressing-gown and night-shift, Avith his wig un brushed and all aAvry, although it be but within an hour of the mid-day meal. Nor is he there for a minute ere the Catholic \" baker-master \" Martin, over the Avay, thrusts his floury head out of the little prac ticable window-pane behind the tray of caterpillar like rolls arranged outside the house ; and he says to the others, as he eyes the animal round about which they are grouped, \" Fine sausages there, neighbour ! \" and then sliding back the pane, comes straightway into the street, to have a pinch at the haunches of the animal like the rest. After this, the so-caUed crazy Schrumpf, the man-milliner, a door or two above, darts into the middle of the crowd, crying, \" Ach wass ! ach mass ! ach wass ! my pig is twice the size of that, and I've only had him fattening these last three Aveeks. Why, that won't be fit to kill till Easter !\" \u2014 and so saying, he huddles his long dress ing-gown tightly round his legs to hide the flannel drawers in which he has made his appearance in the middle of the road. Whereupon a noisy discussion ensues among the worthy citizens out in the centre of the thoroughfare, as to whether that be the proper sort of \" land-swine,\" and whether it will fatten with little food or not, and as to Iioav many \" Centners \" it weighs ; till heads are thrust from almost eA'ery one ofthe upper windows, and figures of tradesmen appear"], [195, "173 THE CITIZEN LIFE OF EISENACH. on the door step of every shop, all in long dirty dress ing-gowns, anft Avith almost as long dirty pipes, to take part in the porcine controversy : one standing out for so many pounds, and another crying, \" What Avill you bet ? \" or, \" It isn't true !\" or \" You're a liar !\" after the accustomed amenities of the place. You have, indeed, but to listen to the boorish wrangles, to Avatch the graphic gestures, and notice the elegant and industrious morning costumes of the tradesmen and the hand-workers, to knoAV Avithout going over your doorstep what they are all saying and doing in the middle of the most fashionable street of Eisenach, at an hour Avhich should be the busiest time of the day. The master-weaver's loom, Avhich Ave can see from our windoAv, from morning to night, flitting backwards and forwards, suddenly stops Avorking ; the neighbouring smith's hammer ceases beating ; the haberdasher comes out with the lace edging that he was about to show to some customer dangling in his hand ; the silversmith sallies forth rubbing aAvay at some spoon that he was busy polish ing ; the helmeted policeman stops on his rounds ; the barber halts, with the little leathern box in wliich he carries his razors, soap, and water, under his arm ; and indeed every one discontinues working, and even the most hastily-pressed loiters on his Avay \u2014 imme diately a pig to sell makes its appearance in the streets of the principal Eesidenz Stadt of Thuringia, But Ave have before said the Thuringian capital is"], [196, "174 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. merely a large farmyard, in which agrarian pursuits prevail to a far greater extent than the ordinary occupations of ciA*ic Use. The reader has aheady seen how, in the viUage of Mohra, the chief magistrate is merely the principal boor of the hamlet ; how justice there alternates with threshing and chaff-cutting ; and how the executive government of the little place (the forestanding men of the community, the two watch- men and one policemen) are far more intent upon look- ing after their pigs and cattle than in guarding and protecting their neighbours. In Eisenach the same jumble of ciA*ic duties and agricultural pursuits holds good, though to a less caricature degree. The mayor of the Thuringian capital, certainly, delights in pig- feeding, and loA*es to grow his own sausages Uke the Eisenachers in general ; but he can hardly be said to throAv his whole soul into the pig-stye \u2014 like the Mohra Schulze. The judge of the assize court too, though he can scarcely, in fairness, be spoken of as a thorough boor, revels between the intervals of his judicial duties (like Cincinnatus of old) in the richness of his manure, rather than the subtleties of jurisprudence ; and is prone, Avhen he lays aside the SAA'ord of justice, to Avield the cabbage-slicer instead, for the due pre paration of his winter stock of Sauerdcraut. Nor is there hardly one pure and unmixed civic occupation pursued in the town ; for the majority of the master tradesmen are petty peasant-proprietors as Well. The master-shoemakers almost all keep coavs in the back yards of their houses. Some of the cabinet-makers"], [197, "175 THE CITIZEN LIFE OF EISENACH. haA'e from twelve to fourteen acres of land in the suburbs, and are more taken Avith ploughing their fields than planing their deals. Many of the bakers are wont to raise the rye they use in the manufacture of their black bread. The Saddler-and-upholsterer keeps a couple of sheep in the wood-house in his \" Hof\" and loves to grow the avooI which he uses to stuff the chairs and sofas of the citizens. Even the confectioner lays his own eggs, through the inter vention of a dozen or two Cochin-Chinas at the back of his shop. The furrier, too, is the principal game purveyor and sportsman of the place, for the mere sake of the hareskins and roebuck-hides that he requires in his trade. The one wealthy distiller in the town has a dairy in connection Avith his business, besides acres in the suburbs, where he grows the potatoes out of which he manufactures his Corn brandy-wine, and his \"fnste Arrac de Goa,\" or \" echle Jamaica Bum.\" Moreover, the so-caUed merchants, who have smaU \" cider-rooms \" attached to their little chandlers'-shops, are in the ' habit of owning \" garden-houses,\" as they are styled, for the growth of the apples which they turn into vinegar or apple wine \u2014 according to the demands of tlieir customers \u2014 for there is really no distinguishing the one fluid from the other. Then the clod-hopping apothecaries give their mind to the congenial occupation of fattening geese, and prefer to rear their oaa*ii feather beds _. to dispensing farthings '-Avorths of hair oil to the servant-maids of the town, and palming off on the peasants a halfpenny-worth of dead-dogs' fat,"], [198, "176 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. as an infallible cure for those in a galloping con sumption.* In fine, Ave verily believe there Avas hardly one person in the petty Haupt-und-Besidenz Stadt of Eisenach, that was not more of a boor than either a tradesman, a lawyer, a professor, or even a gentleman ; for the bookseller, the goldsmith, the optician, and * There were two of these worthies in Eisenach, one styled the \" Palace Apothecary,\" and the other the \" Privileged Palace ditto,\" and it is impossible to say which was the more ignorant boor of the two. In England an oilman's shop-boy would have been more fit to have dispensed drugs ; for they were utterly unacquainted with the commonest principles of their business, and were in the habit of prescribing for the poor people such remedies as would have condemned them to several months' im prisonment as the most impudent quacks in our own country. A favourite recipe with them for the bite of a dog was to cover the wound with some of the hog's-lard they sold for ointment, and to bind it up with a few of the hairs of the animal that had inflicted the wound. Indeed, as we happen to know somewhat of che mistry ourselves, it did not take us long to discover that to trust such mere hinds with the compounding of medicine was an utter disgrace to so-called \" educated \" Germany ; for there was hardly a barber-surgeon in the Thuringian capital who was not a gentle man and a scholar compared with them ; and our own son, though only seventeen years of age, had often to go round to their shops and teach them how to make up the chemicals he required for photographic purposes. A druggist in England is almost inva riably a man of education, and usually a gentleman in manners ; but these fellows were boors in knowledge and boors in the mat ter of politeness too \u2014 having the manners of an English navigator and the education of an English parish apprentice. Nevertheless, they were admitted to the fashionable Xlemda club, though, for ourselves, we should have as soon thought of fraternizing with an English dustman as admitting either the Palace-Apothecary or the Palace-Privileged ditto into the sacred circle of our own family."], [199, "THE CITIZEN LIFE OF EISENACH. 177 the drunken Lord High Chamberlain himself, plunged their minds into the heap of manure, and geese, and pigs, treasured in their back-yards, far more fervently, as we have already said, than they did into either letters, science, arts, or the ceremonies of fashion. So that it Avas impossible to hear them talk for tAvo minutes together Avithout the one asking the other, \"How much do you get for your clung?\" or else, \"What do potatoes cost the sack?\" or, \"How many pounds did your last pig Aveigh ?\" &c. Even at the back of the first-class hotels in Eise nach, a large farmyard usually exists ; so that the traveller who happens to be put into a bed-room that overlooks the \" Hof\" as it is termed, is often unable to sleep after day -break from the cackling of geese, the grunting of swine, and crowing of cocks ; while the disgusting stench that rises from the muck-heap stored in the rear of each of the taverns (for there is not a water-closet in connection with any of them), is sufficient to sicken any but a nightman's stomach. It is the invariable custom indeed, throughout the Thuringian capital, not only A\\*ith the proprietors of every hotel, but with all the citizens of the place, to treasure up the entire excreta of aU living in the house, as though it Avere a mound of untold wealth.

In Thuringia it is customary to manure the land only once every three years, the rotation of crops lasting only that time, and the land being devoted to the growth of potatoes the first year, to that of iye or Avheat the second, and barley or oats the third. Hence, as the dung-heap of each house usually amounts, at the year's end, after having been duly intermixed with the old straAV beds, Avhich the citizens, the Mayor, and the Lord Chamberlain, all delight to sleep upon for the purpose, to some five or six cart-loads, eA'ery householder is in the habit of getting for this the use of half an acre of land for the growth of the potatoes which he and his family, and his equally-beloA'ed pigs, require throughout the twelvemonth. The quantity of potatoes consumed by the people of Eisenach is really incredible, and henee the reason for the uniA*ersal manure-storing throughout the city. Half an acre of potato land yields upon the average from 36 to 40 sacks of 100 and odd pounds each, or between 3600 and 4000 pounds' weight, and this is what each Eisenach family requires eA'ery year for the consumption of their pigs and themselves. In fact, many of the modern Saxons know no other food \u2014 living even harder than the poorest Irish do in our country ; the members of the family eating no less than 2000 lbs. weight of potatoes in the course of the year, which is at the rate of more than 5 lbs. a clay. Nor should the reader imagine that such a habit prevails only in the poorer portion of the community ; for, as a rule, potatoes and salt constitute the supper"], [201, "THE CITIZEN LIFE OF EISENACH. 179 every evening of almost every AveU-to-do family ; Avhile on the Aveek days potato-dumplings, Avith fresh or dried fruit, or potato-soup with the smaUest scrap of fat pork in it, or potato salad, Avith a raw pickled herring, are the principal delicacies served at the tables of the gentry. To a stranger, this mixture of agrarian and civic life is of a most temper-trying character. With a man like ourselves, who happens to be somewhat of a scientific and experimental turn of mind, the sausage-making pursuits of the opticians, and the potato-digging propensities of the cabinet-makers, have made us, over and over again, Avish that the economical divisions of labour had traveUed as far as the heart of Germany. For often, when we haA-e wanted some deUcate piece of apparatus, such as a galvanometer or a specific-gravity balance, from the hands of the only mechanician in the town, we have gone to his shop, after waiting some couple of months for the completion of the work, and found on the very day when Ave were assured it would be ready, the whole of the hands \u2014 master, journeymen, and apprentice \u2014 away from the workshop, and busily en gaged in hacking sausage-meat in the sitting-room. Again, when our son wanted some neAv camera finished, Ave should find the entire body of journeymen and Lehrjungers off to the fields, either hoeing potatoes or digging them up for their master, while the ordinary business of the tradesman was left at a stand-stdl. In fact, at such seasons, no work but that of a pastoral character goes on. The principal milliners, for instance, n 2"], [202, "180 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. gave up bonnet-making in the autumn, and retired from the Magasin to the wash-house to superintend the boiling doAvn of some three hunched pounds' weight of plums ; and there they remained for twelve hours, stirring away one after the other, until the fruit was reduced to a thick pulp (not unlike liquid papier mdclte) ; after which it had to be potted away for use in the winter, instead of butter on the bread. Such a concoction is known by the name of zwet sehgenMuss (literally plum pap or squash), and strongly resembles paste-blacking in appearance, Avhile in taste it is about as agreeable as the sickly medicinal com pound known as \"electuary\" in our apothecaries' shops. A little later in the year, you will find every trade's-person in the town neglecting his ordinary business for the preparation of the year's supply of Sauer-kraut; and then, go where you will \u2014 to the tax collector's, the Steuer Bevisor's, to your lawyer, your doctor, your tailor, your boot-maker, or your banker \u2014 you AviU find that the} are aAvay at the market, buying their 120 (zwei Schock) or 240 (vier Schock) of immense A\\*hite-heart summer cabbages for the manufacture of the beastly national dish.

In fine, such is the farmyard mania among the tradesmen of the Thuringian capital, that even the \" palace confectioner \" keeps a dozen or so of turkeys about the mixen at the back of his shop, and keeps the noisy gobbling birds too, more for pleasure than profit ; for when Ave wanted one of them for our Christmas dinner, no money would induce the palace idiot to part with one of his Trut-huhner, for he told us that such birds Avere regarded as a curiosity in Saxony. The propensity for pig-keeping, hoAvever, is someAvhat more rational, seeing that each German family, in the course of the year, consumes on an average from 250 to 400 pounds' weight of sausages (either in the form of liA*er ditto, red ditto, hard ditto, or Savoyard ditto, as the case may be) ; and to produce this amount of food, two pigs, at least, are required to be kept, so that commerce and handicraft have to be alike sacrificed to the tending of swine, and the shop neglected for the stye ; Avhile the rear of every dwel ling-house, hotel, and government office is coirvertecl into an open stagnant sewer, Avhere the refuse of the people, and their kindred pigs, is allowed to rot and reek for the sake of the equally essential potatoes that, as we have said, are consumed by eA'ery Saxon family by the ton weight per annum ! Another peculiarity of the Saxon citizens is their"], [204, "182 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. love of what are called \" garden-houses.\" This they have in common with the people of Holland, Avhere it is usual to see a corpulent gentleman smoking his pipe in a sentry-box beside some foetid and duck weedy ditch in the outskirts of the town, and with an ostentatious placard stuck up in the few square yards of the garden-grounds, saying, \"my only happiness on earth is here.\" In the same manner aU round about Eisenach, there are little buildings hardly bigger than sedan-chairs, with a patch of garden land in front ot them, about the size of a Turkey carpet ; and thither the townsfolk delight to wend then- way, in the broil ing summer's evenings, laden Avith coffee-cups and cake, so that they may smoke their pipe and drink then infusion of burnt carrots out in the country.

We have no wish to speak of the entire German race as a semi-civilized people, but little acquainted with those polite observances which constitute the decencies of srood societAr in modern times ; for as A'et we have but seen and studied the Ehenish and Saxon com munities. At the tables-d\" hdte of the best hotels, hoAV ever, as well as at the German baths, one is in the habit of associating with tourists from eA'ery part of the German kingdom and principalities \u2014 and with tourists, be it remembered, Avho do not rank as the vulgar or poorer portion of the population ; and we can safely say, though we have lived in such hotels for months together, and eaten our midday meal Avith the hundred different guests that assemble there day after day in the season, we never yet saw the German gentleman or lady, officer or nobleman, who knew how to take their food, or to conduct themselves at dinner Avith more decency or grace than an English publican or stage-coachman."], [207, "ELEGANCIES OF LIFE IN SAXONY. 185 To understand this part of the social problem, the reader must bear in mind that forks are comparatively a modern innovation \u2014 having been known among us for little more than a couple of cen turies ; for one Thomas Corryate tells us, as a great novelty, in a book written by him in 1608, that \"at Venice it Avas then the mode to provide each person at dinner with a fork to hold the meat, besides the ordinary knife and spoon \" \u2014 it being considered \" ill manners there to touch the viands with the fingers ; \" and he adds, quaintly enough, \" I myself have thought it good to imitate the new Italian fashion since I came home to England.\" We must remember, too, that in a sausage-eating country like Germany, such articles as forks are still not likely to be in general use ; for it is by no means unusual to see a lady, after having Avalked out to the suburbs, and halted at some neighbouring \" beer-garden \" for refreshment, draw a small cylinder of sausage from her pocket, and proceed to eat it with the clasp-knife she in variably carries with her, and without either plate or table-cloth, after the fashion of an English navigator, or \" chaw-bacon.\" Among such a people, therefore, it is not in the least astonishing that the use of a fork at dinner is found to be a matter of difficulty ; indeed, we heard indirectly from a young Saxon lady, Avho visited London, during the recent International Exhibition, that it took her at least a fortnight before she could be taught to use her knife and fork together. The common practice among German gentlefolks at dinner"], [208, "186 GERAIAN LIFE AND MANNERS. is to pin the meat down to the plate with the fork held straight up, Avhile the handle is clutched firmly iu the fist, and then to proceed to hack the slice of meat into so many little dice, the knife being held the Avlnle by the blade, rather than the handle, in the same manner as a countryman cuts at his bread and bacon. After this, the knife is thrown doAvn on the table, and the fork removed to the right hand, by which means, the pieces are raised one after the other to the mouth ; whereupon the fork is laid aside, so that the gra\\ry may be duly lapped up with the knife ; and, Avhen this elegant process is finished, bits of bread are thrown into the plate, and the fork once more resumed, in order to mop up every particle of grease remaining on the platter. FinaUy, the prongs of the fork itself are duly cleansed by means of a bit of crust being rubbed into them ; and when this has been eaten, by the noble lady or gentleman, as the case may be, the plate thus wiped out, and the knife and fork thus primitively cleaned, are ready for the enjoyment of the next course. Clean plates, indeed, and clean knives and forks Avith each change of dish, are luxuries which even German princes are yet unacquainted Avith ; so that no matter Avhether the previous dish partaken of may have been fish, or steAV reeking Avith garhc, or a bird flavoured with junipers, or a bit of \" swine's flesh \" eaten with putrid cab bage, and the one to come a pudding Avith sweet sauce, it is all the same to the insensate German palate ; fur no foregone smack of the onions, or the herrings, or the game, or the \"high\" greens is dis-"], [209, "187 ELEGANCIES OF LIFE IN SAXONY. tinguished by them, and the flavour of the \" sand tart \" \u2014 despite the dirty plate and knife \u2014 pronounced to be \" extremely delicate \" (sehr delicat). After attending parade at Weimar \u2014 the capital of the Grand-duchy (Avhere, Ave assure the reader, there was a greater muster of officers and under-officers than private soldiers, drawn up one deep, round three sides of a square in front of the Palace, so as to make the sight of the assembled army appear as formidable as possible) Ave dined at the table d'hote of the Brb-Brinz hotel, Avith the officer whom Ave had, but a few mo ments before, seen at the head of the \"Handful battalion\" (as the Germans call it) displayed on the occasion. And this gentleman, Ave noted, in the course of the repast, took up in his hand the bone of the mutton-cutlet to Avhich he had been helped, after having cut the greater part of the meat from it, and proceeded to scrape the few remaining bits from out the crannies of the tiny rib, by means of his knife, which he held as a clasp one, expressly for the occasion ; and then kept continually sucking at the blade, so as to get the scraps from betAveen his thumb and the steel. Nor would A\\*e cite this individual instance of iU-manners, Avere it not to con vince English ladies and gentlemen that we do not draw our conclusions, as to the indecency of the Germans at table, from any other class than such as are regarded as the elite of German society. In the same manner, we haA'e seen ladies of rank, dining at the principal table d'hote at Bad-Liebenstein, raise their plate to their lips, Avhen they had devoured all the \" Braten \""], [210, "188 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. to Avhich they had been served, and drink off every drop of the gravy left behind; so as to save themselves the trouble of mopping up the remains of the sauce Avith pieces of bread, after the approved mode of the country. And yet this offensive act caUed forth not the least indication of surprise or disgust from the rest of the Germans present at the board. Now, that this is no overdrawn picture of the manners of German gentry at table, every tourist, and eA'ery English family, avIio has resided for the shortest time in any of the Principalities, AviU bear us out. In England, a joke used to be prevalent that at the loAvest eating-houses, where a good dinner was advertised to be supplied to the costermongers and \" roughs \" of the British metropolis, at the lowest pos sible price, that in order to ensure a supply of clean plates at the establishment, \" a Newfoundland clog Avas kept on the premises.\" In Germany, however, clean plates for each fresh dish are considered superfluous articles of luxury ; the ladies and gentlemen, nobles and princes, by means of the bit of crust, before spoken of, supplying the place of the tongue of the canine animal. In fine, so general is the custom among the Germans of regarding a change of plates, or knives and forks during dinner as being in no Avay necessary, that the waiters at the best hotels teU you they never dream of offering such dainties to any but Englishmen and Frenchmen; and the experienced diner at tables d'hote can immediately pick out the guests who have been accustomed to anything like civiliz.d usages, by the alacrity with"], [211, "ELEGANCIES OF LIFE IN SAXONY. 189 which they refuse to use their knife and fork, or plate a second time. It is astounding, too, to observe Iioav German young ladies, when they come to dine at your house, will insist upon withholding their dirty plates from your servant ; eA'en though you haA'e taught the serving-maid (at the cost of no end of trouble) that she must change each \" teller\" after every different course. Of the style of family feeding and the manners at table among the Saxon gentry at home, there is hardly any necessity to speak, since the reader can readily judge Iioav refined these must be after the descriptions above-given. Suffice it to say, that a breakfast, such as we know it in England, is a meal that cannot possibly occur in any household ; seeing that none in Eisenach, from the highest to the lowest, ladies and gentlemen, tradesmen and their families \u2014 even down to the servants \u2014 ever think it necessary either to wash themselves, or brush their hair, or, indeed, to appear in any way but half-dressed for the greater part of the day, after leaA'ing their beds in the morn ing ; one and all remaining in an offensive state of dirt and slovenliness, until either the entire household work is finished, or they have some business to call them out of doors. We have before spoken of the pig-driA*ing in the most fashionable street of the town, and told as to hoAV the attractions \" of the fine little sausage \" brought aU the better-to-do, but unwashed, tradesmen to their doors, in their dressing-gowns and slippers, eA'en a few moments before dinner-time ; and iioav let us add that Ave have been to an advocate"], [212, "190 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. in the afternoon, and found him in his cobbler-like office, habited in the same universal old greasy and tattered robe de chambre, and smoking a long trombone like pipe, as he scribbled at the little rude toilette table of a desk before him. The usual matutinal costume of the young ladies at home, on the other hand, consists of nothing but a petticoat, an old coloured-chintz sleeping-jacket, without even stays or bodice beneath it, and a close fitting calico nightcap, about as elegant in shape and look as that of a sick boy in a parisii infirmary with us ; while over their neck is spread any old duster like rag with wliich they can cover their shoulders ; their feet being thrust into such a pair of burst-out slip-shod shoes, as no decent person in om' oaa'ii country would pick up in the street. Nor must the reader imagine that the above picture of German ladies in their morning attire is in the least over coloured ; or that we paint this universal portrait of the Saxon baronesses and gentlewomen, the young as well as old, as they are to-be found at home in the morn ing \u2014 up to noon-day and even later \u2014 from the out ward appearance of any one eccentric individual. On the contrary, we speak merely of what is the general custom, even with ladies of title, the A\\*iA'es of judges, and the female members of the famiUes of government officers, and those of the professional gentry. Indeed, a German woman, no matter Avhat her station, regards any old thing she can lay her hands on as fit to wear in the house ; and believes that gowns and bodices, not to speak of clean cuffs and coUars, are articles utterly"], [213, "191 ELEGANCIES OF LIFE IN SAXONY. superfluous for her to put on, in the presence of her husband and children ! Nor can it be said that the harsh lines of this sketch are due to national prejudice; for it Avas only some twelve months or so back that there appeared a letter in one of the principal Berlin papers, written by a German, upbraiding his country women for the shameless and dirty state of their persons in their oavii houses in the early part of the clay ; and concluding by contrasting the filthy state of the entire household of a morning in an ordinary Teutonic family, with that of the neat and decent appearance of every member of any respectable Eng lishman's house, Avhen sitting clown to their comfort able morning meal.

With so bright an example, too, is it likely that the daughters and the sons of such a family would venture to appear at the meal in a less trim or orderly condition ? while eA'en the waiting-maid herself, who has had to sweep and dust the room before breakfast, has to conform to the general cleanliness ; and is never aUoAved to enter the parlour unless she has tidied herself after the work, and made herself fit to come into an assembly where nothing but comfort, order, and decency are expected to preA'ail. Such a meal, such a sight, it must require a hundred years of \" progress \" before the boorish Saxons can ever be made to understand the social enjoyment of. Think, now, of a German breakfast in Saxony, by way of contrast. The picture Ave have given of the English repast is that which prevails, not among the titled and wealthier classes, but among the Avell-to-do members of British middle life. Nor is the sketch that of an unusual feast, but such as occurs every morning in every well-regulated homestead. Well, the usual \" early bit,\" as the first meal is significantly called in Germany, consists, among ordi-"], [215, "ELEGANCIES OF LIFE IN SAXONY. 193 nary middle-class folk, of a tin tray of white breadlets placed in the centre of the table, which is utterly destitute of cloth, and has merely a few coffee-cups arranged anyhow at one corner of the board, Avhile the earthen coffee-pot is put to stand on the stove in a corner of the room. Nor is there so much as a knife or plate ; nor, indeed, either a milk -jug or sugar-basin, or even a single chair set to aAvait the coming of the several members of the family, who make theft appearance almost in the same state as they spring out of bed, on hearing that the coffee is seiwed. In they come, one by one, shuffling across the bare boards of the wretched room, some a quarter of an hour after the others, according as they have felt more or less hungry, or drowsy, as the case may be ; for none is expected to wait for the rest, and each helps himself, or herself, to the contents of the coffee-pot and the bread-tray, just as he or she AviU. First, comes the grubby old mother, most likely ; about as graceful in appearance as an Irish basket-Avoman at the London green-markets, and certainly not looking half as tidy as an EngUsh charwoman; for she has slipped on merely an old dark woollen petticoat and thrown a shawl over her head, and pinned it under her chin. Then, as she stands at one corner of the table, she begins, alone, to partake of the sumptuous fare ; for the \" black coffee,\" as it is called, consists of a decoction of the smaUest-possible, cheapest-possible, and filthiest possible Java berries, thickened and blackened with the powder of burnt carrots ; and this Avash is chunk vol. i. o"], [216, "194 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. neat \u2014 without either milk or sugar, we repeat, to palliate it. We have no particular spite against the reader, but Ave do wish he could only taste a mouthful of this same morning-beverage. Our street \"saloupe\" is nectar to it, and, we give him our word, a glass of salts-and-senna pleasant tipple to the blacking-like liquid. We never tried it on our boots, but we are satisfied it would polish much better than it chinks. Again, it might be good for Japan varnish, and serve to lacquer a London brown-paper tea-tray ; and it might make ATery good Indian-ink in its way ; but we pledge our honour that we would as soon think of chinking the secretion of a cuttle-fish, or sipping a cup-full of the unsavoury liquid knoAvn at the gas-works as \" black jack,\" as making our breakfast off a mug-full of that dark-coloured slush, called \" black coffee \" in Germany \u2014 which always has seemed to us to be more fitted for tarring a ship's bottom than solacing a human being's stomach. Well, the elegant old Frau von Fish-fag, or the gracious Grafin von Apple-woman, pours out a cup of the \" black broth,\" and, as she stands alone at the table, dips her long caterpillar-Uke breadlet into the mess ; and then after having soaked the rod, tiU it is as soft and brown as a bit of wet ginger-bread, proceeds, in ac cordance with the most high-and- nobly-born \"fashion \" of Germany, to suck the end of it as a charity-boy does a lolly-pop ; and Avhen she has removed aU the black moistened pap from the rest of the long breadlet, she"], [217, "ELEGANCIES OF LIFE IN SAXONY. 195 goes on to soak the sucked end of the roU as before ; and so continues, soaking and sucking, tiU the elegant meal is finished ; after which she turns her coffee-cup down in her saucer, as a sign that she is \" sat,\" as the ladies here politely phrase it \u2014 and then away \" the gracious Frau von Fish-fag\" shuffles, to teU her daughters once more that the coffee is ready. In a feAv minutes afterwards, the proud young ladies themselves make their appearance at the sumptuous board, each in a white cahco night-cap, as we haA^e said, and without either a bodice or a gown to cover theft* bodies. Thus elegantly attired they proceed, Avhile one rubs her unwashed eyes Avith her unwashed hands, and the other keeps scratching away at her unbrushed hair under her cap, to go through the same refined operation of coffee-drinking, both standing at the table, as their mother had done before them (and, indeed, as our dustmen and cab men do at the early coffee-staUs in the streets of London), and jerking away, every now and then, at the one old wooUen petticoat enveloping their loAver limbs, like the sack of a French journeyman-baker, to keep it from falUng at theft feet. And when the girls have sucked their roUs to the end, the father, maybe, makes his appearance in his dressing-gown and drawers, to go through the same elegant process ; the only one, indeed, of the family who appears dressed for the occasion being the son, and he is washed and tidied \u2014 not because such sifty formality is expected of him at home \u2014 but because he has either to go to his comptoir or to his mihtary duties, or to o 2"], [218, "196 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. be at the forest-men's school, as the case may be, at such an early hour. The female fashion of appearing in night-caps till a late hour in the clay is not confined merely to ladies at home, but prevails even at the fashionable German baths, where decent women think it by no means unseemly to sit thus slovenly attired, in public, outside the doors of the different hotels they inhabit, and that till within an hour or so of dinner time. The 10 o'clock meal, which is equivalent to the English luncheon, or the French dejeuner a la fourchette, has no more ceremony about it, and, indeed, no more refinement in the serving of it, than the \" early bit ;\" since in most houses this meal is not served at aU, but each member of the family is left to go to the cupboard and cut off a shee of black bread, as thick as an octaA'o A'olume, and to smear it with butter, in the same manner as a bricklayer trowels a dab of mortar over a brick. Then, with the sUces in their hands, the ladies shuffle about the house, biting out large semicircular pieces as they sweep or dust the rooms, or proceed with the ironing of their skirts for the next grand ball.

And there he wiU sit, at a table, and in a room, not half so tidy as a public house parlour, and, indeed, not a whit better than a London tap, with his clasp-knife in one hand and the hunk of black rye-bread in the other, amid the reeking tobacco smoke, eating and gossiping aAvay, Avith the master-tradesmen, or lawyers, or doctors, or government clerks, a\\Iio have all left their business on the same errand, only an horn* or so after the com mencement of the clay's work.

Thank God ! we ourselves have learned, like Franklin, to sit down and bend our head in thankfulness over the poorest possible repast \u2014 so long as it be decently and cleanly served \u2014 but, as a person reared among the amenities of life, Ave cannot help having an innate horror of dirt or indecency at table ; and though the matter of the toothsomeness of German dishes may resolve itseft into a question of ethnological taste, still the mode of eating, in aU nations, even clown to the most savage, is held to be somewhat of a sacred cha racter ; and it is for the utter want of this sense of cleanliness at meals that we have an ineffable loathing for the people among whom we are now living. Not a nation exists, however barbarous, that we are ac quainted with, but beUeves it necessary to wash their hands and face before touching food. But these people, in their oavii homes, consider it no disgrace to eat, even tlieir mid-day meal, without having cleansed their skin, or combed their hair; and to take up the food in their unwashed hands, and so to cany it to their unwashed mouths, without the grace of either thank fulness or table-cloth, and in many cases without even plates or dishes. But, as we said before, it is better to let Germans themselves speak upon such matters, and thus to aUoAV the civilized world to dravr* their own conclusions upon the matter, rather than that we, as Englishmen, should sit in judgment upon their shortcomings as regards manners and refinement. As we have said, hospitaUty, in Germany is a"], [222, "200 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. virtue comparatively unknown ; for in a land Avhere there is scarcely any home comfort, and people consent to live in their houses \" unseen of men,\" but little better than pigs \u2014 many of them considering it unne cessary to dress, or even to Avash themselves, through out the day, unless they have occasion to stir abroad \u2014 the reader aauU readily conceive that such things as dinner-parties, and even balls, at home can hardly ever take place. Indeed, during our stay in the country Ave never heard of one such party being given \u2014 the only dances occurring at the club caUed the \" Klemcla,\" and the dinners being confined to an invitation to some table d'hdlc at one or other of the hotels. In a Avord, the Germans have, as a rule, but one mode of receiving friends at theft houses, and that is at what are caUed \" coflee-cftinkings \" \u2014 entertainments which are usually given at three or four in the afternoon, and to which ladies alone are usually ftmted. Indeed, so common is the custom of excluding all gentlemen from these assemblies, that an English lady informed us, that when she first went into these societies, she was under the impression that she Avas associating Avith a company of widows. The absence of the male sex, however, from such assemblies, the stranger, after a few months' residence in the country, ceases to wonder at ; for at the hour at which such parties are usually given, the men are mostly in the taverns chinking their beer and smoking their pipes, and the charms of such enjoyments are, to a true German mind, infinitely preferable to that of female society ;"], [223, "201 ELEGANCIES OF LIFE IN SAXONY. for when we assure the reader that there was but one German in the Avhole town of Eisenach \u2014 and he was a hypochondriac \u2014 who did not pass eA'ery night of his life away from his family, and amid the tobacco fumes of some tavern, or petty club, it AviU not be difficult to understand Iioav Uttle domestic enjoyment is known among such a people. Home, indeed, which is one of the most poetic of words in England, is always spoken of by the tavern-loving Teuton under the literal and prosaic title of \"the house\" \u2014 even as the husband always terms his wife his \"Avoman,\" and the wife, in her turn, denominates her married partner her \" man.\" Noav, as these Kaffee-ochr-Tliee-gcselhehaften (literally, \" coffee or tea companies \") are peculiar to the country which forms the subject of the present book, Ave wiU append a description of the entertainment usual on such occasions, taken from one of the best German authorities on the subject.

But when the company is numerous, then the younger ladies are to be put into an adjoining room with the door open, and the elder ones seated on a sofa.

Then a pause of a quarter of an hour is to ensue, after wliich a smaU portion of cream or \"greis-meal\" (Angl., Embden groats), or starch pudding, or potatoe-meal jelly, is to be sent round on smaU plates or saucers, each accompanied Avith a tea-spoon (because it would be rather diffi cult to carry such shppery food to the mouth with a knife as before) ; Avith this a sauce is to be served, and a basket of macaroons to foUow. The plates or saucers are then to be retained by each lady, and, aster a quarter of an hour's pause, a second tart is to be presented, together with slices of pears, apples, or oranges, whicli have been previously peeled and cut up into a 1_oav1 \u2014 the fruit being handed round to the assembly either by the lady of the house, her daughter, or some young lady officiating on the occa sion.

Then a tray-full of cups of tea, sugar, milk, three kinds of biscuits, shces of black bread-and-butter with red wine, or the bottles full of neat spirits, as before, is to be handed first to the elderly ladies on the sofa, then to the younger ones, and, last of aU, to the gentle men. After the tray has been carried round three times (as at the ladies' parties), the cups are to be taken away. Then comes a pause, during which the company play at whatever may be agreeable \u2014 cards, or music, according to the taste of the guests. In this interval \"Bischof,\" ov\" Cardinal\" \u2014 the latter being a pecuhar kind of German chink made up of wine flavoured Avith fruit and sweetened Avith sugar (and not unlike the messes English children are sometimes in the habit of compounding in theft wine-glasses during dessert) \u2014 is to be offered to the assembly, together Avith some such fruit tart as the season may afford. Next, small plates or saucers of cold rice-meal pudding and fruit-juice are to be served, with a tea spoon, to each person. Later in the evening a second"], [227, "205 ELEGANCIES OF LIFE IN SAXONY. tart, with the aforesaid Bischof (Angl., bishop) or \" Car dinal,\" is to be presented. And, finally, after another pause, pieces of \" marinirter herring \" (described here after), or raw ham, bread and cheese, cold meat or fish, salad, or raw smoked- salmon, or raw sausages, or smoked meat, or raw-herring salad upon bread and butter, or hard-boiled eggs and parsley, or black bread and radishes, are to be offered to the guests as a croAvning relish to the elegant entertainment ! ! ! Such people as have never had the misfortune to be present at one of these refined entertainments cannot possibly have a notion of the amount of trash and mess wliich German young ladies can manage to stoAv away on such occasions ; indeed, the capacity of these damsels' stomachs, when eating at another person's expense, ahvays impresses you with the idea of tlieir being utterly underfed at home ; and we have seen the girls nudge one another as the Lord Chamberlain's daughters helped themselves to a fourth or a fifth slice of cake or tart, and heard them whisper, \" WeU, you knoAV the poor things haA'e only two portions at dinner among six.\" In a word, every stranger who visits the toAvn teUs you that he never, in aU his experience, beheld such a gaunt, squalid, underfed race as are the Saxons of the present clay ; for you have but to look in their lantern-jaws to understand that not one in a hundred of them has a bellyful of substantial food in the course of a tAvelvemonth.

When Ave were a young midshipman in Calcutta, we had four black men to carry us about in our palanquin, to each of whom we paid a couple of shillings a month, and they \" found themselves.\" To English ears the statement sounds hke fiction, but in Germany it creates no wonderment, because every woman Avho is in the habit of acting in the capacity of \" Auftdartcrin\" or attendant, upon famiUes who keep no servants at home, is accustomed to receive no more than 2*. a month ; out of which she is ex pected to pay for her own living and lodging. In deed, one of this class whom we knew \u2014 and there was not a better-conducted girl in the entire city \u2014 complained to us bitterly that the town authorities had taxed her entire earnings (for she was in the habit of knitting in her overtime), at 20 dollars, or 3/.

In fine, as we have said, you have but to look in the countenances of these potato-fed and half-clad German folk to knoAV what long strides the race has yet to take, in order to keep pace with the rest of civilized Europe ; and yet, like half-starved people, they are ahvays eating \u2014 eating trash that yields no satisfaction to the stomach, and which, consequently, sets it craving an hour or two after the miserable, windy food has been crammed into it. At the theatre the curtain has barely faUen upon the first act of the play before the Avhole of the audience are en_ra_red in munching something' or other. Only a night or two ago we were present at the performance of the Fortune- Teller of Geneva, and, before half-an-hour had elapsed, we noticed the daughter of the Judge of the Assizes chewing her bread and sausage, in the most unabashed manner, in the chess-circle ; while the wife of a captain in the infantry (Saxe-Weimar has no cavalry, as we have be fore explained) was cracking her cold, hard-boiled eggs, and washing them clown with a penny glass of beer, as if neither of them had dined heartily for the week past. Indeed, this is the invariable custom of the ladies of Eisenach, as it is with the London cook maids in the gallery of the Victoria. They one and all have some primitive notion that unless the stomach be kept fiUed to the gorge it is impossible to sympathize with the distresses of the heroine of the drama before them; and, accordingly, Uke Miss"], [230, "208 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS.

Nor is this continual eating confined only to the ladies and gentry of the Thuringian capital. When we Avere first resident in the town, we lived in a Garten-haus (a villa in the outskirts) ; and Ave had, at the end of our term, to put up with the annoyance of a new house being built next to om* own. However, as the work progressed, it afforded us so many opportunities of studying the character of this half-barbarian tribe, that we got to be at last reconciled to the inconveniences to which we were at first subjected. To see the wretched soup-and-po tato-fed labourers ladling the earth out of the founda tion \u2014 UteraUy by tea-spoonsful (for a German spade has a handle some two yards long, and the blade is hardly bigger than the boAvl of the spoon which we use for the serving of salt) ; and aster they had been engaged for one hour at this light occupation, to wit ness the poor exhausted creatures sit down on the garden banks, and strive to renew theft worn-out natures with Schnapps, and black bread, and fat, was a scene as new as it must have been curious to any one who had lived among the well-fed work-people of the earth. At six in the morning, the labourers were in the habit of assembling ; at eight, they \" knocked off\" work for breakfast, which consisted of a drink of burnt-carrot coffee, Avithout milk or sugar, and a bite or two of equally black bread ; at ten, they stopped for"], [231, "ELEGANCIES OF LIFE IN SAXONY. 209 half-an-hour, during Avhich they ate and slept ; then they worked on again till twelve, aster which they ate and slept for an hour again. Then they worked on again till three o'clock, when there was another pause and sleep until nearly four; and at six, the entire labour Avas at an end. There is a notion abroad that one Englishman is equal, any day, to master three Frenchmen ; and the history of railway cuttings has shown that in order to make foreign labourers as poAver ful as British navigators, they must be as weU fed ; for Ave happen to knoAv that when the Ehenish Baftway Avas in the course of construction, it Avas found that if the Avork-people of the country were kept upon the same substantial food as the EngUsh earth-AVorkers were in the habit of taking, they could be made capable of performing very nearly the same feats. And Avhen Ave saAv the wretched squad of German excavators doing their work at Liebetraus Garten-haus, and removing the earth by tea-spoonsful, and taking nothing but thin soup or coffee and black bread to sustain them at their labour, Ave longed to be able to introduce some half-dozen English naA^vies into the country; and to let the poor, benighted, underfed people see what effect good living would have in quickening and strengthening the muscles of the working population in Saxony, There is but one explanation for that utter Avant of muscular power, and manly energy, as AveU as bold enterprise, which is the peculiar characteristic of the entire Saxon and Ehenish people. Enlightened Ger- vol. i. p"], [232, "210 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. mans teU you very candidly, that Englishmen are ever foremost in all matters of progress ; and when you ask them why it should be so, they shrug their shoulders in want of an answer to the question. Now, there is no doubt that these Saxon people \u2014 of Avhose fadings and shortcomings we are now writ ing \u2014 belong to the same race as that free and hardy tribe which philosophers acknowledge to have con stituted the \"backbone\" of the EngUsh nation. AVe, however, see in the intermixture of other races, with our OAvn, that Englishmen, regarded even from an ethnological point of A-iew, belong to no one class of people, but are made up of aU the picked tribes of the world. Sages, avIio worry theft brains about such matters, are in the habit of forgetting the influence of the ancient poetic British stock, and the after-fusion of the Welsh tribe with the old Bomans who invaded our land. Then, to add new vigour to the stem, the Saxons came among us, Avith theft noble free institutions, to engraft upon the country that love of liberty and justice Avhich England has never forgotten. Centuries afterwards, the early Scandinavians overran the country, and infused into om* people that spirit of maritime adventure and enterprise Avhich is stiU one of the types of the race. And, finaUy, the chivalrous Normans landed among us\u2014 a race from Avliich the finest of the present English aristocracy are proud to date their extrac tion \u2014 and from Avhich it is impossible to say Iioav much of the modern English character is due to that"], [233, "ELEGANCIES OF LIFE IN SAXONY. 211 romantic element Avhich William of Normandy, and his followers, gave to the people of England, in the clays of yore. Despite aU this commingling of other blood, there is not the least doubt of the influence of the early Saxons upon the destinies of the British Empire. To this clay we, as Englishmen, delight to date some of our grandest laws as far back as the time of Alfred the Great ; and who can say how much of the respect that the old Saxon tribe had for women has influenced Englishmen in that jealous regard and honour of the female sex, Avhich, to this day, remains the distinctiA'e character of our oavii country ? On the Continent, our people stiU wonder and shudder to see the weaker portion of humankind condemned to offices of the most servile character ; Avhile lazy hulking types of so caUed rational and feeling animals stand gaping by, the wives and daughters being left to carry loads which the Almighty has better fitted mankind to bear. In Saxony, too (and this is the great wonder with English scholars, who know the antecedents of the once noble and kindly tribe), women are degraded to the level of cattle ; so that Saxons, who think it such a disgrace to carry a basket on their back, that it has come to be a proverb, that the greatest possible insult which a Woman can inflict upon a man, is to \" give him the corb,\" do not hesitate to allow their partners to bear burdens that they almost sink under, while they, the stronger and lazier animals, smoke tlieir pipe empty handed by tlieir side. Further, Englishmen would hardly believe it pos- t 2"], [234, "212 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. sible that when Ave first came to live in Eisenach, a law stiU existed that any woman found guilty of a misdemeanor, could be condemned to put on linen drawers, and be beaten over her body by the police officers Avith a stick as thick as a man's little finger ; and Ave Avere assured that this barbarous practice Avas repeatedly resorted to. True, AA-fthin the last twelve months the brutal law has been repealed; still, the mere fact of its existence in a so-caUed civilized nation, doAvn to the middle of the nineteenth century, shows Iioav little advanced the modern Saxon people are in refinement beyond the saA'age hordes of Bussia, Even to this day, too, you wiU hear Germans, avIio pretend to rank as gentlemen and citizens, avoAV in public company, Avithout the least tinge of shame upon their cheeks, that they are in the habit of dealing out to their Avives, Avhenever they may happen to offend them, a tiichtige Maul-schelle (literally, \" a heavy ringing blow on the mouth\"). Nor is there any law in the country which makes the beating of a Avife by a husband a punishable offence ; and Avhen Ave have told the poor iU-treated bond-slaves of women, that in England the penalty for such brutality is six months' imprisonment with hard labour, the answer of the Avretched patient creatures Avas \" Lieber gar ! \u2014 a Avoman might be beaten here until she had n# eyes left in her head, before anyone Avould think of inter fering for her protection.\" However, putting aside the ethnological causes as to the difference between different races, Ave revert to the reason Avhy the present Saxon tribe so utterly"], [235, "213 ELEGANCIES OF LIFE IN SAXONY. differs from our oavh, in the matter of energy and enterprise, as Avell as in a sense of respect for the Aveaker portion of humanity. We repeat that the oidy key to the mystery lies not only in the diverse social institutions of the two nations, but in the more important fact that the greater part of the Germans are unacquainted Avith anything like the graces and pleasures of home-life \u2014 passing almost the Avhole of their leisure time in public-houses and \"beer-gardens,\" not only at night, but during a considerable part of the day also ; and thus consuming so large a portion of their in come in drinking and smoking, that barely the half of their earnings is left for the proper housing and feeding of their family. The consequence is, that the very coarsest and least nutritive of food has to be partaken of by the wife and children, so that the head of the household may sot and puff' away the means wliich should be devoted to the due strengthening and comforting of the Uttle community at home. Every one knows the squalor and misery of a drunkard's family in England ; it is proverbial how the offspring of a man avIio spends the greater portion of his time in the public-house are generaUy half starved; and what wretched, weakly, and ignoble members of society, in most cases, the children ulti mately become, as well as how the home is stripped as bare of every article of comfort by sotting parents as the \" casual ward \" at a A\\'orkhouse.

In fine, we doubt whether the home of the most inveterate of English drinkers can exhibit the same wretchedness and utter want of decency and cosiness, as the houses of eAren the better-to-do of the Eisenach burghers !

A BALL AT THE KLEMDA. The main distinction in the regulation of German and English families is the utter subserviency of the mother to the grown daughters in every Teutonic household. The father of the family seems generally to maintain his supremacy ; unless, indeed, he shares his property among his children before his death (as is often the case in Saxony), binding his children over to pay him a certain yearly sum for his maintenance. This peculiar custom is allowed by laAv, and in some cases Ave believe it is found to Avork weU ; but in many others, we have been informed, it gives rise to brutal iU-treatment on the part of the children to the aged parent ; for the sons get to regard the old man in the light merely of an incubus upon their means, and not only to look forward Avith anxiety for his death, but to begrudge him almost eA'ery mouth ful he eats. NeArertheless, it forms no part of our present pur pose to discuss here the working of such an arrange ment between aged parents and their grown children ;"], [240, "218 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. for now our object is merely to show how every German mother, immediately after the confirmation of her daughters, sinks into nothing better than a serving-woman attendant upon them. At that period of life the young ladies, though only just turned fifteen, are considered fit to \"go out\" into society; and accordingly commence frequenting every public ball, visiting the beer-gardens in the afternoon twice or thrice every week, and, indeed, joining in every form of amusement peculiar to the ladies of the Thuringian capital. In eA'en the best of German families, it is the rule to keep but one servant, Avhilst many of the gentlefolks employ only an Aufudirterin, or charwoman, to come in once or twice during the day, and do the more menial offices of the household. The consequence is, that a considerable proportion of the hard work of the house is left to the mother to execute ; for she prefers taking such drudgeries upon herself, rather than that the vornehme, or distinguished, young ladies, should soil their skin, or redden their hands by such homely duties. Accordingly, if you happen to call at the house of any of the middle, or even higher class, families in the city, you are almost sure to find the mother in the act of scrubbing the sitting-rooms, or else cleaning the saucepans ; and in such a state of rags and dirt that she is utterly indistinguishable from the charwoman whom she is helping in the same occupation ; while the young ladies are engaged in attiring themselves in no end of trumpery finery to be off to the \" Fantasie\" or the \" Hohe Sonne,\""], [241, "A BALL AT THE KLEMDA. 219 maybe, to drink their coffee and beer amidst the elite of the town. Nor Avould Ave be the person to rail against so primitive a state of social life, were the tasks in dulged in from any high sense of domestic duty on the part of the mother ; the fact being that the lady of every German house sinks into a mere servant of-aU-Avork solely to enable her daughters to appear more showy away from home, and in the hope of their catching a \" man,\" and getting off her hands sooner than usual. Nay, more : not only does the mother, for this reason, cheerfuUy consent to be come the scuUery-wench of the establishment, but she is Avilling to dress Uke one also ; for reaUy an English cook-maid or house-maid is both tidier and cleaner during the work of the house than a German gentlewoman appears Avhile occupied in the same offices. But the said English cook maids or house-maids are a hundred-fold more neat and a thousand-fold less dowdy in their attire than the generality of German mothers when out for a holiday ; indeed, Ave hardly ever saw the lady of a house in Eisenach, either at home or at a public baU, or while out walking, \" dressed in all her best,\" who did not remind us forcibly of a charwoman in our own country, seen under the same conditions. Nor can Ave give the male reader a better notion as to the distinction in attire between a German Frau and Fraulein when dressed for any grand occasion than by assuring him that the young ladies themselves are as showy as those seen walking"], [242, "220 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. in couples in the Haymarket, and the mother about as elegant as the old hag that is generally to be found at the heels of such flaunty damsels in the night-time. Moreover, in every country, of late years, the ex travagance of woman's attire has increased to a frightful extent, so that simple-minded old-fashioned folk lament the times Avhen their great-grandmother's brocade-silk dress was Avont to descend as an heir loom, generation after generation, through the female members of the same family. For in the olden times it was the fashion for laches, eATen of quaUty, to have but one or two fine chesses ; but then they were reaUy sterling articles, and such as not even the richest could afford to lay aside year after year \u2014 the brocades, \" lute-strings,\" and velvets of former years being rich enough for the skirts to stand up by themselves, and utterly different kinds of manufacture from the thin flimsy silks, stiffened with soap, and the sham velvets, made up Avith cotton backs, of the present da}-. In the primitive town of St. Peter's, Avhich is the capital of Guernsey, one of the first laches there showed us such an ancient dress that had been in her family for three or four generations, and which she was proud to wear still at the state baUs given by the Governor and Bailiff of the island. In these trumpery \" Brummagem \" days, however, Avhen almost every form of life has passed into outside show and falsity, and \" organzine \" silks and \"Manchester\" velvets can be had almost as cheap as the cotton prints of former times, such a rage has sprung up"], [243, "221 A BALL AT THE KLEMDA. for having a multiplicity of new dresses, that the ladies in every nation have got to think it a chsgrace to them to be seen outside their doors in the same attire on two different occasions ; and the consequence is, that in order to enable Avould-be fashionable women to conform to such silly notions, cheaper, and flimsier, and more tricky fabrics haA'e to be invented and manufactured each fresh season \u2014 so that ladies of limited means may appear to compete with the ex travagance of the more affluent. It is said that the Empress Eugenie, to Avhom Europe is indebted chiefly 1'or the setting of the silly, if not Avicked, fashion in this respect, spends as much money upon dress in one Aveek as the decent little Lady, Avhom Ave are lucky enough to haA^e on our oavii throne, does in an entire twelvemonth ; and even in our own country, the mania for external display has so permeated through every class of female society, and the supply of trashy finery kept pace so thoroughly with the demand for it, that ladies with us are continually complaining of their maid-servants' ambition to appear in the same paltry sdks and satins, sham laces, and Persian silk parasols, as themselves. If such be the state of things in our oavii land, Avhere almost eA*ery class receives as many pounds as the Germans do thalers in the course of the year, the reader may be able to form some slight notion as to the trumpery finery with Avhich the young ladies are in the habit of clothing tlieir backs in a country like Saxony, Avhere the means are so smaU, and the money Avasted in amusements forms so large"], [244, "222 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. a proportion of the petty annual gains. We do not exaggerate in the least, when we say that the \" lady \" among our chimney-sweepers on a May-day is not a whit less showy in her costume, and that the flashy frippery she carries on her back is Avorth about the same amount of money as the most expensive ball dresses worn by the dowdy young \" pinks of fashion \" at the Klemda. Indeed, this love of appearing in a new costume at each of the fortnightly balls held at the principal club in Eisenach throughout the winder, has groAvn to such a rage in the Thuringian capital that Ave never saw other than the poorest and most tawdry articles in any of the shops ; and Ave doubt whether an evening dress which cost more than two or three dollars at the utmost (six to nine shillings English), could possibly have found a purchaser in the entire beggarly community. But the reader must not imagine that we are here railing at the people solely on account of their poverty, and their consequent inability to wear more expensive articles. We despise them rather for their love of adorning their backs in an infinity of flaunty, tricky trash, instead of delighting to appear in one really good and sterling dress on each festive occasion. It is the falsity, meanness, and the Avould-be grandeur, that offends our taste ; and as we loathe the swell mobs-man bedizened Avith pinch-beck for jewellery, so that he may pass as some rich fool of a dandy \u2014 as Ave laugh at chimney-SAveepers tricked out in dresses covered with bits of paper tinsel, in tlieir absurd endeavour to appear as lords and laches for one clay in"], [245, "223 A BALL AT THE KLEMDA. the year \u2014 so do Ave contemn and smile in very pity at these same squalid Germans, got up in tlieir thin bright-coloured rags \u2014 theft sham ostrich feathers, made out of unravelled and curled muslin \u2014 tlieir mock gold and silver lace trimmings, hired at a penny the yard\u2014 their showy half-cotton ribbons \u2014 their black cotton-velvet sadors' hats \u2014 their dyed cat-skin furs \u2014 their sham laces, and indeed, their twopenny-half penny tricks of every kind. Nor are we speaking here of any rare exceptional meanness that is to be found among particular individuals, but of such petty practices as prevail among the Avhole of the female members of this same paltry pretentious society. In most nations, now-a-days, the struggle is Iioav to SAArell 200/. a-year into the seeming grandeur of 2000/. In Germany, however, where all are striving how to make a groschen do duty for a louis d'or, this end is attained merely by the ladies Uving at home Uke kitchen wenches, and consenting to eat food hardly better than that Ave give to our pigs and cattle ; Avhile the domestic squalor is cheerfully sub mitted to, so that the daughters may appear, Avhen away from their homes, dressed in a few showy and staring flimsy robes. Nor is the Ust of evils attendant upon such a state of society yet ended. If the mother be left to do the greater portion of the housework, Avhile the girls are flaunting abroad, it follows, as a matter of course, that as the father is either supposed to be attending to his professional duties in the eA'ening (or more likely, drinking and gambling in the beer-house),"], [246, "224 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. that the daughters must be left to Avander about from place to place utterly unprotected, and allowed to meet and talk with gentlemen at the beer-gardens, just as they please. Noav, in the town of Eisenach, there is a celebrated school, or university, for the training of \"forest-men,\" whose duties in after-life are to consist of the super intendence of the plantation and thinning of the forest lands, from which the German nation still derives by far the greater proportion of its fuel. These students are called \" forest practitioners,\" and gene rally consist of the sons of petty German barons, or of others, more or less, well-to-do in the nation. They are mostly young men from eighteen to thirty years of age, and there are some sixty or seventy of them altogether located in the town during the Uni versity terms. These forest-men are the plague of the Eisenach girls' lives, for as many of them are nobles, and almost aU are of a marriageable age, such young ladies as are over-anxious to procure a partner, Avhose rank in life may be a shade better than their own, think it, by no means, unfeminine to faire la cour aster the students, and to sit drinking with them in the beer-gardens and the shooting-booths tiU late at night. \" Aye,\" said an Eisenacher to us, \" haft the old spinsters in the town are due to those ' Forsf-Practi kants,' for the fellows come here and circulate stories as to Iioav rich they are, and the girls, silly fools, Avho believe all they hear, run after them, as though they"], [247, "A BALL AT THE KLEMDA. 225 were mad. The students promise them marriage, of course ; and, when they have finished their studies in the town, go back home, vowing eternal constancy \u2014 and never trouble their heads about the damsels again. The consequence is, that the citizens, when they knoAv that a girl has once been in the habit of consorting with the forest-men, turn their back upon her, and she is therefore left to trick and entrap some other student ; so that she, at last, comes to be privately betrothed eA'ery three years to another gen tleman, as fast as fresh relays of young men resort to the college, until she ends by being too old to get a husband at all.\" Such Ave knew ourselves to be the fate of some dozen or two of the more scheming frauleins in the town. There Avere the Shabbymantle girls, for instance, avIio Avere the daughters of a person holding one of those minor official situations which are hardly recognized as being compatible with a gen tleman, and yet Avhich is supposed by the holder of it to have sufficient dignity connected with it to make him look down upon mere citizenship. These girls Avere the talk of the town. All tlieir friends shrugged their shoulders, and said it Avas a pity that their father and mother aUoAved them to be out clay after day alone with the forest-students \u2014 to go into tho Avoods Avith them Avithout anybody to protect them, and to sit late in the evening with them in the taA'erns. There Avas, hoAvever, this excuse for the poor girls. The father Avas disliked by the citizens for the stinginess, as Avell as the moroseness, of his VOL. I. Q"], [248, "226 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. character. As, therefore, there was but little chance of their marrying among any of the more respectable of the Eisenach burgers, one could, at least, understand, if not excuse, the reason why they should endeavour to thrust themselves upon every strange gentleman who should happen to visit the place. The conduct of the Shabbymantle girls, however, was but that of some score of others, equally scheming, and equally poor and pretentious ; and the fate of such damsels with the forest-men, was usually the fate of those a grade or two beloAV them, who were in the habit of consorting with the soldiers garrisoned in the city. In England, no decent girl is allowed, as a rule, to go abroad without some male, or grown female protector \u2014 parents admitting that the errors of young Avomen are mostly due to the want of proper super vision and care on the part of the father and mother at home. In om- own father's family such was the principle maintained; and, so far as our experience goes, we never knew the daughters of any respectable person avIio Avere allowed to Avalk the streets alone, or, indeed, to be in the company of any gentleman, without some protector being by theft side. It is this wise principle of paternal superintendence which makes the daughters of the middle-class people of England take rank as the most modest and virtuous of young women on the face of the globe. In Germany, hoAvever, no such care is devoted to the young female members of the family. The father, Ave repeat, is mostly out drinking and gambling at the beer-house, and the mother is helping the char-"], [249, "A BALL AT THE KLEMDA. 227 woman scrub the floors, or do the ordinary work of the house at home, Avhile the daughters are away flaunting (Avithout eA'en a brother at their side), and taking their coffee at the \" Fantasie' or the \" Hole Sonne,\" amid a crowd of these same uproarious students. We ourselves have seen the Shabbymantle girls, and other bold, scheming young Avomen, drink ing coffee and lemonade till late at night, in company Avith a gang of such college boys ; and noticed their old father, when he had had enough of the amuse ment, retire from the scene, leaving his daughters there to carouse till long after dark, Avith a table full of young men, to everyone of aaIioiu he Avas an entire stranger. Noav, we do not cite the case of the Shabbymantles as being in airy Avay peculiar. True, they were per haps more bold and forward, and a shade less like German ladies than the other young Avomen avIio were in the habit of running after the students ; but they belonged to that same vulgar, scheming, pretentious, shabby-genteel class of damsels, avIio are always struggling and striving to unite themselves with some person a grade or Iavo above their oavii rank. They appertained, indeed, to that paltry, stuck-up race \u2014 \u25a0 that mongrel \" genteel \" tribe, aaIio consider them selves too grand to associate Avith what they call common people, and Avho are, nevertheless, them selves, of too mean a stamp to be aUoAved to fra ternize with gentlefolks. Hence, they must needs have resort to all kinds of tricks and schemes to push themselves into that society to which they are n _> C_ -v"], [250, "228 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. for ever aspiring, and yet in which, owing to their rude, unrefined manners, they can only be tolerated, but never Avelcome. Thus, the life of the Shabby mantles in Germany is the life of silly \" stuck-up \" scheming people all over the world \u2014 laughed at by the citizen class of Avhich they form part, because they consider it beneath them to associate Avith their fellows, and yet despised by the gentlefolks into Avhose society they are for ever obtruding themselves ; and consequently left to go through life like outcasts \u2014 the parents without any real friends, and the daughters tricked by the A'ery gentlemen Avhom they Avere intent upon entrapping into marriage. With this introduction to the different A'oung ladies _/ o of Eisenach, we will iioav conduct the reader to a ball at the \" Klemda \"- \u2014 the most fashionable entertainment in the toAvn ; so that he may have an insight into the manners and customs of the gentlefolks there assem bled, and thus be able to see how far they differ from our OAvn. Such balls, Ave have before said, occur at least once a month throughout the entire }*ear \u2014 the expenses being included in the three-and-sixpenny quarterly subscription. Nor are such expenses heaA*y, for as everybody has to pay for his own supper \u2014 if he sup at all \u2014 the actual cost of the amusement to the society is limited to the charges of lighting and music ; a few pounds of stearine candles are sufficient for the former, Avhilst, Avhen Ave tell the reader that each of the sixteen musicians employed on the occa-"], [251, "A BALL AT THE KLEMDA 229 sion receives but twelve groschens (1*. 2c/.), for play ing there from seven in the evening until one, and often two, in the morning, he himself AviU be able to estimate the outlay necessary for the costly banquet.* On the day of the appointed ball, the young ladies aa'Uo intend to be present remain at home, dressed in the same elegant and tidy costume as we have before described to be customary in every German household at breakfast time. Indeed, as they rise from their beds, so do they continue tiU the hour comes for dressing \u2014 tlieir face and hands being unwashed, and theft hair uncombed for the whole of that time, their dinners eaten in their night-caps, and with merely a woollen petticoat and a chintz sleeping jacket to cover their bodies. The morning is occupied by the young ladies, thus scantily attired, in the ironing of their ball-skirts and stiffly- starched petticoats ; while the afternoon is given up to the refurbishing of some old second-hand wreath, so as to make it pass for a new one, or else in re-trimming the ball-dress, in which they have formerly appeared, with some neAvly-dyed ribbon, so as to make it appear as if they were able to afford a fresh costume upon each occasion. A gentleman is hardly expected to know, or even * As an example of the average remuneration paid to musi cians in Saxony, we may mention the fact that the band at the Eisenach Theatre consisted of twenty performers, and these were paid collectively the munificent sum of 3 dialers, or 9,s , the night, which, of course, is at the rate of 4| groschens, or h\\d. per man."], [252, "230 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. to observe the petty tricks as regards dress, which are occasionally resorted to among the upstart portion of the female sex ; but the father of a family cannot help hearing of such paltry artifices, and the writer can only say that never tiU he lived in Germany cUd he believe it possible for such mean shifts and eva sions to be practised by the shabby-genteel members of society, as generally prevail among the showy young girls of that beggarly land. Towards the evening, on these baft days, it is cus tomary to see the Avasherwomen carrying home, on the top of a pole, some huge stiff-starched petticoat, or skirt, Avhich, A\\*hen distended to its full dimensions, has aU the appearance of a monster fire baUoon, made out of tissue-paper. These are for the grander young laches, Avho do not themselves do the Avashing and ironing at home. As the evening draws in, the 3roung ladies begin to lay aside their nightcaps, and a. ash themselves, for the first time that day. Then the hair is soaked in fat, so as to make it appear as glossy and tidy as if it had been brushed \u2014 for hairbrushes, so far as Ave could learn, Avere luxuries utterly unknown in the land ; so that, indeed, Avhen any young lady had occa sion to scratch her head in company (a practice by no means unusual Avith German gentlewomen), one could not help seeing the scurf, thus raised, clinging to the pomatum as thickly as if the tresses had been sprinkled with bran. The common custom, with even the most fashionable young Avomen of Eisenach, is to carry a dirty smaU-tooth comb in theft pockets, and Avhenever their hair becomes in any way"], [253, "A BALL AT THE KLEMDA. 231 rough Avhile out in society, to drag forth the elegant article, and to pass it over their locks before your face ; after which, they invariably disgust every English person by running the tip of their finger nails along the teeth, and so cleanse it of the dirt which it has accumulated. Again, we must remind the reader that Ave speak of no exceptional indecency, for we know, from our own daughter, that the young ladies of Eisenach were astonished that she used no grease to give her hair the gloss of cleanliness ; nor could they believe that by mere brushing a young woman's tresses could possibly be kept so silky and so neat. Moreover, to show Iioav universal is the custom of performing the acts of the toilette in public, even in Avhat is caUed the best society, we may cite the fact that eA'ery officer and gentleman before sitting down to a table d'hote thinks it by no means an offence to persons of refinement, to drag a filthy little brush from his pocket, and to arrange his hair almost over the very table at which you are eating ; Avhile in the intervals, between the dances at every ball, you will see these same military gentlefolk scrubbing away Avith something Uke a nail-brush at their head and mous tachios ; and the young ladies as diligently occupied Avith their filthy smaU-tooth combs, separating the tresses that in the heat of the dance have become matted Avith the grease with which they are satu rated. When the young lady's toilette is finished, and the"], [254, "232 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. crowning touch of elegance is given by dusting some powder of ordinary washing-starch over the face, neck, and arms, then a handkerchief is covered Arith the same choice poAvcler, so that the sweet creature may be able to flour herself as white as a plaster cast several times in the course of the evening. At the conclusion of the above elegant operations sand the cunning reader Avill detect hoAV much the Avriter is indebted for the observations of EngUsh ladies upon the matter), the mother proceeds to pack a small berlin-Avool-Avork carpet-bag full of such articles as she believes her daughters may stand in need of during the dances. The articles thus stowed away generally consist of some three or four pocket handkerchiefs, as many small-tooth combs as there are girls, relays of gloves, a small stock of pepper mint drops or lozenges, a packet of pins, and some two or three needles and thread \u2014 the uses of these several articles A\\rill be seen hereafter. At the hour of seven (or a little before) the mother and the daughters proceed to walk through the streets, all with bare heads, and muffled up in dirty old shawls, (there was but one opera cloak in the A\\*hole town), and with the servant carrying a lantern before them ; for, owing to the deficient lighting and paving of the city, it is impossible for the visitors to the ball to avoid the puddles which lie in the road Avithout some such appliance. The serving-maid is also provided Avith a basket, in which she carries an old pair of boots for the young ladies to put on when returning home ;"], [255, "A BALL AT THE KLEMDA. 233 though, why such economy should be necessary Ave could neA'er understand, seeing that each of the girls AAras in the habit of dancing in black boots, or else in servant-like black-stuff shoes and sandals. Upon arriving at the club-house, the party make their way to the garde-robe, as it is called, and proceed to shake out their dresses, &c, in the presence of any gentlemen avIio may happen to be there, preAdous to their entering the ball-room. In deed, it is impossible for an Englishman to give his own country-people a notion of the utter indelicacy of this arrangement in Germany ; for Ave ourselves haA'e seen German ladies sit unabashed as they laced tlieir boots, Avith their foot over one knee, before our very eyes \u2014 and it should be remembered that German men have not the same sense of respect for females as English folk. We have heard, too, at this same garde robe of the most fashionable place of resort in Eisenach, coarse remarks from the \" gentlemen,\" avIio happened to be present while some lady was arranging her dress, that haA'e made our ears tingle for very shame that a woman could be subjected to such indecent insults. Moreover, every man of the world Iciioavs that, at such times, secret offices have to be performed, and yet at this same fashionable club of Eisenach there Avere no means taken to prevent the commingling of the sexes. In sine, it is utterly impossible for an English gentleman to express in print the bestiality (there is no other word for it) that prevailed on such occasions ; or to give English Avomen a notion of the utter in-"], [256, "234 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. delicacy of their own sex, but a few miles removed from them on the other side of the Channel ; as Avell as of the gross want of chivalry on the part of the men avIio can make a joke and a sport out of those private functions in Avhich the commonest person in our land would blush to the roots of his hair to detect a Avoman. The Klemda Club-house itself is a tumble-clown, rotten old building, not unlike the deserted giraffe house on the road to Turnham Green. The ball-room is about the size of an ordinary county- court, and cer tainly not as large as the general run of riding-schools \u2014 the only furniture being a feAv red-calico curtains before the windoAVS, as wrell as a few chairs and benches about as elegant as these at our Highbury Barn. At one end is a small gallery for the musicians, and at the other a larger one, where the servants of the fami lies present are aUowed to wait, and to A\\*itness the dancing until they are wanted. Beneath the one gallery is the card-room, and under the other the supper and wine-room ; while beyond the latter is the beer and smoking-hall for the accommodation of those chandlers and shop-boys present at the baU, who prefer to indulge in the luxuries of sausages, small beer, and tobacco ! The attendant at the cloak-room is aUowed the privilege of selling for a penny apiece small strips of paper, on which the order of the dances for the evening is inscribed. Many of the more penurious of the young ladies, however, are in the habit of tricking the attendant of the dues by writing down"], [257, "A BALL AT TIIE KLEMDA. 235 beforehand the titles of such dances as they know to be usual on those occasions, and affixing the numbers indicative of the order for the evening, by copying them from some one of the lists that have been pur chased by their friends. It is customary with the young ladies who are anxious to be engaged for eArery dance throughout the night to go as early as possible, and many are there at least an hour before the ap pointed time ; so that they may haA*e tlieir lists filled up with partners before the greater portion of the company arrive \u2014 it being the custom of the gentle men who request the honour of the young lady's hand for such and such a dance to inscribe their names on the programme she has ready Avith her, and many of the tom-fools of vons thinking it neces sary to Avrite their names cIoaaui Avith the whole acre of petty titles belonging to them, till the Tanz Ordnung often runs as follows : \u2014 1. Polonnaise. \u2014 Hugo Baron von Stinging-Nettie-leaves. 2. Polka. \u2014 Rudolph Freiherr von-und-zu Kuhaus. 3. Tyrolienne. \u2014 Herr Piegiments-Artz Ereveler. 4. Fbancaise. \u2014 Herr Laden-deiner bei Eischels Farben- fabrik Klcise. and so forth. Upon grand occasions, such as the anniversary of the founding of the Club, and during the Christmas and Easter holidays, the baU is usually commenced by dancing the \" Bolonnaise \" as it is called, and in this almost every person present takes part. The ladies and gentlemen at first walk round the room hand in hand in procession, forming one long line of couples,"], [258, "236 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS and moving along as stiff and stately as was the custom in the days of the old Minuet de la Cour. When the tour of the room has been thus made, some two or three times, to the air of our \" God save the Queen,\" (which the Germans have appropriated to themselves under the title \" Heil dir des Sieges Kranz\") the ladies and gentlemen, folloAving the course indicated by the first couple, separate\u2014 the ladies filing off in one direction, the gentlemen in another. Then they proceed to describe all manner of curious devices and pretty figures \u2014 the long line of the procession, as they AA'alk slowly along, now seeming to undulate like a moA'ing snake, and now to form some ingeniously-arranged maze ; untd, aster some quarter of an hour or twenty minutes of con tinually-changing figures, the measured strains of the music suddenly cease, and some lively polka is substi tuted ; whereupon the several couples set oft' jigging round the room as a sign that the evening's fes tivities have commenced. On the occasion of the Schiller Feast in Eisenach, some three years ago, this same \" Polonnaise \" Avas danced on the Market Place \u2014 almost the whole of the citizens taking part in the ceremony ; upon which occasion the letters of the Poet's name were formed by the long line of persons, in the course of the figures. The dances Avhich usually succeed the Polonnaise at the Klemcla ball are polkas, Avaltzes, Tj-roliennes, and galoppes \u2014 the Mazourka and Schottise being seldom danced in Eisenach. The old English quad rille, however, is danced some two or three times in"], [259, "A BALL AT THE KLEMDA. 237 the course of the evening, for this the Germans believe to be a great novelty recently invented in France, and therefore known by them under the title of the \" Francaise.\"* * It is curious to note that this same quadrille is either directly or indirectly of English or Scottish origin. The term quadrille (or more properly speaking, quad-ree/j evidently means nothing more nor less than a four-handed reel, and the majority of the figures introduced, such as the chaine des dames, I cie, pastorale, &c., are clearly simple modifications of those performed hy the border races of England. At a peasant's merry-making in Cum berland, we remember seeing danced at one of the taverns there many varieties of the reel, which reminded us strongly of those figures which fashion, within the last century, has made popular in the drawing-rooms of gentlefolk ; and an old Newcastle friend of ours, who, unfortuuately, is now no more, and who was one of the liveliest and best of companions, was wont, at such times as Christmas and other holidays, to delight in such reels, and to dance as though the border-music of his country made the blood in his veins like so much quicksilver. We doubt very much, too, as to whether the old English country-dance is not essentially of English origin. True, etymologists insist that our term is but a corruption of the French contre-dame ; but we ourselves see no reason why our French neighbours should not have borrowed the title from us and have corrupted it in their turn. Assuredly such a dance is more national in our land than in France, and the figures, again, partake much of the character of those same reels which constitute the common dance throughout our country. Nor do we see in the amusement anything like French forms about it. Who that has lived in France ever saw anything approximating to the sine genial mirth of the dance we call \"Sir Roger de Coverly?\" Whereas, be present at any country gathering or harvest-home in our own provinces, and you will find that something like this dance is sure to be indulged in. So far as our knowledge goes, the hornpipe would appear to be of Welsh origin\u2014 indeed, the very philology of the term (Welsh Pib-com) teaches us as much ; whilst the reel would seem to be of Scottish extraction ; for though we lived some part of our life"], [260, "238 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Twice at the \" Klemda \" we saw the Lancers attempted to be performed, and a more wretched in Wales, we never saw that form of dance indulged in by the peasants there. The jig, on the other hand, may be taken as the Irish form of the same kind of revelry; whilst the old English country dance is either of Saxon, Danish, or Norman origin, we cannot say which. We incline, however, to the belief that it has come down to us from the old Saxon Glig-men, who were the minstrels of former days, and who were in the habit of encou- raging the people to song and dance whenever they visited their houses. If, however, this same country dance (though the word country is by no means a Saxon one) was introduced into our land by the followers of Hengist and Horsa, it is curious to note that no vestige of that dance is to be found among the Saxons located in Germany at the present day. For though we have attended many a Kirmes during our stay in the fatherland, (and, indeed, delight far more to witness the festive gatherings of the people, wherever we are, than to be present at the would- be fashionable displays of the gentry ; for fashion, more or less, is the same stupid, pretentious tom-foolery in every land,) we never saw any dance but the waltz, or that Polish form of it called the polka, indulged in by the folk on such occasions. In- deed, there is no doubt that the waltz is purely of German origin, the word being coined from the word walzen, to roll; Latin, volverc, to turn, and of which the radical letters are found in the English word k-\u00ab/1ow. And as the young horses of the Andes take naturally, and without training, to that form of ambling to which their dams and sires, when newly introduced into the country, had to be educated ; so would it appear that the German peasants know how to waltz instinctively. Whilst the common people of our own land would require years of training with their feet to teach them to keep pace with such a measure, the bauer boys and girls are enabled to do so almost without tuition, \u2014 and that as elegantly as any of the gentlefolks in the best ball- rooms of England. Indeed, it is not an unfrequent sight to behold two little things who can scarcely toddle start off the moment they hear the welcome \" dance-music \" of their country, and begin whirling each other round as prettily as fairies upon the grass, and as knowingly as if they had drunk in a know-"], [261, "A BALL AT THE KLEMDA. 239 jumble of figures, Avhere the partners went here, there, and everywhere, Ave never witnessed at any dancing academy in our oavii country. True, these same \" Lanzaires,\" as the Germans call them\u2014believing this dance also to be of Parisian origin \u2014 have been introduced but within the last j*ear or tAvo into ledge of the steps with their mothers' milk. The geography of dancing, so far as we know, is a point to which little attention has been given. Tho polka is clearly of Polish origin; the \" Mazourka \" and \" Cracovienne \" are obviously Russian ; the more-animated and rapid \" Bolero,\" accompanied with the crisp clack of the castanets, is manifestly Spanish. The dances of the \" Natch-girls \" in India, with their lascivious posings, are, again, distinct from the dances of any other land ; the waltz belongs to Germany, the jig to Ireland, the reel to Scotland, the hornpipe to Wales ; but as to what are the dances peculiar and indigenous to the people of France, Italy, and the great Scandinavian multi tude located in Denmark and Sweden, we are candid enough to confess our ignorance. We have lived for some time in France \u2014 and lived, as we always do, wherever we are, among the people ; but we never yet saw any dance performed there that we could trace as being of purely French origin. Were, then, our lively French neighbours originally a non-dancing folk ? and had we sober, steady, sedate Englishmen the greatest number of peculiar or original dances of any nation upon the face of the earth? Surely in these days of international everything it might answer the purpose of some public ball speculator to institute a world's dance, where we might see the geography of this form of amusement carried out in the best possible manner \u2022 and com pared with which a ballet at the Italian Opera, with its stupid gymnastic feats of twirling on one toe for several minutes together, like teetotums, and springing into the air after the fashion of the caprioles of goats, would be regarded rather as the feats of acrobats and trapezes than that delightful and elegant pastime which has been well termed the poetry of motion ; and which, in its highest sense, should be the outward and graceful muscular expression of some inward emotion of sudden gladness stirring and animating the frame."], [262, "240 (iER.MAN LIFE AND MANNERS.

A BALL AT THE \" KLEMDA \" (CONTINUED). The most peculiar dance performed at these \" Klemda \" balls is that which passes by the name of the German cotillion, and Avhich consists of a series of games, rather than figures, superadded to the old French measure. This dance is always reserved for the con clusion of the evening's entertainment, when the ladies and gentlemen draAv their chairs from the side of the room, and seat themselves in a large circle towards the centre of the dancing haft ; after Avhich some of the young ladies proceed to tie a knot in one corner of their handkerchief, and then, doubling the knotted end into the form of a boAv, do the like with the other three corners, in which no knot has been made ; so that the several ends being held in the palm of the hand, it shaU be difficult to teU Avhich is the knotted corner, and which the unknotted ones, belonging to the bows left projecting above. Thus prepared, the damsel approaches any gentleman aaIioiii she may please to seek for a partner, and, present ing to him the several bows of the handkerchief, he selects one of them; and while the lady holds the ends stiU firmly clasped in her palm, the gen- VOL. i. B"], [264, "242 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. tleman is thus led, with his finger and thumb grasp ing the bow he has chosen, towards a second partner, to whom the handkerchief ends are in the same manner presented. When he, in his turn, has taken hold of another of the bows, the couple are con ducted by the lady as before to a third cavalier ; and immediately this one has grasped the remaining bow (for the lady keeps one of the unknotted corners for herself) the ends are draAvn from the hand, and the gentleman who has selected the corner with the knot to it is claimed as the lady's partner for the dance. The others are left to try theft luck once more with some other Fraulein, or else to console themselves Avith the brief pleasure of an \" extra tour,\" as it is called, during the pauses of the dance ; for it is the custom in Germany for gentlemen Avho are unable to procure partners for the waltz, or polka, that is about to commence, to wait until some of the couples halt for a few minutes' rest, and then to approach the gentleman to Avhom the coveted lady is engaged, and beg that he may be aUoAved \u2014 if the Fraulein be not too tired \u2014 the honour of dancing an additional round or Iavo with her. Another pastime indulged in during this same cotillion is to lead one of the most admired of the German coquettes out into the middle of the room, and to arrange a table and toilette-glass there, in front of which the saucy, clumsy flirt is seated. Then the gentlemen are brought forth, one by one, and pre sented to her behind her back ; and as she sees their figures reflected in the mirror before her, she either"], [265, "243 A BALL AT THE KLEMDA. shakes her head or bows towards the looking-glass as a sign that such company is either displeasing or acceptable to her. It usually happens, hoAveA'er, that the head is shaken as repeatedly as the gentlemen are successively presented to the damsel at her back ; for the vain young boor of a Fraulein loves to hear the titters and jeers of the people in the room, as the hand of each SAvain after the other is indignantly rejected by her. Indeed, for the mere sake of dis playing their power on such occasions, some of the more bold young laches AviU shake tlieir head at a Avhole roomful of gentlemen successively, as much as to say they considered there was no one present who Avas worthy of being their partner \u2014 even for that brief occasion. A third sprightly variety of the same dance consists in the removal of the toilette-glass, and in placing upon the Uttle table before described a large papier mdche model of a heart, a smaU velvet slipper, made after the fashion of a watchpocket, and a tiny basket ful of artificial flowers. Then the lady being seated in front of these three different articles, a fresh triad of gentlemen are conducted to the table before her, when she presents the slipper to the one whom she thinks is likely to be ruled by his wife \u2014 the monster brown-paper heart to him with whom she desires to dance, and the basket to the one whose hand she wishes to reject Avith scorn ; for in Germany it is the same insult \u2014 in the vernacular \u2014 to give a gentleman \" the corb,\" or basket (since it is supposed to be the special office of women only to carry burdens in that r 2"], [266, "244 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. country), as in our oaa*ii land it is \u2014 vulgarly speaking \u2014 \"to give him the sack.\" *** * It is difficult to understand the origin of this now \" slang'' idiom of the English language. In such phrases, perhaps, we find a remnant of obsolete customs, once general throughout the folk of our country. Could it have been customary, in the olden times, for the women with us to carry loads in sacks, rather than in baskets at their back; and the office, therefore, have come to be considered as great an indignity as the carrying a basket ona man's shoulders throughout Germany ? Or did the idiom arise in the early days of the Reformation, when the monks were held in the greatest contempt ; for in the old Catholic times we know well, from the ancient records, that the cry of the brothers was continually \" saccvm per naccum \" (that is to say, the sack at the back \u2014 the word naccum being a barbarous corruption of the German nach, after or hinderwards). We, however, incline to the belief that the word sack, in the popular phrase above quoted, is merely a dialectic form of the fine old Anglo-Saxon term saca, which means \" sake, cause, reason, or thing.\" This word is found chiefly, at the present day, in our Common Prayer, where \" for Christ's sake,\" i.e. for the reason of Christ's sufferings, is a com mon expression. In German, the equivalent expression is Sache, which the Worterbucher explain as meaning thing, matter, business, affair, case, cause. \"Geben Sie mir mcine Sachen\" \"Give me my things,\" is a common phrase in Germany to this day, when any apprentice or servant wishes to seek another place ; and hence, we are of opinion that the phrase to give a man his things, or in old English, \"to give him the sack \"(German Sache), came at length to be equivalent to giving him notice to quit. It is peculiar, indeed, how many of the modern English slang terms are merely remnants of the ancient Saxon language, the meaning of which has come, in the course of time, to be lost to the people. But a few years ago, a phrase was current among the \" fast men \" of England, which is a curious example of the philological fact we are here enforcing. \" It isn't the cheese,\" one gentleman in the Haymarket would say to anolher ; and then because such an idiom was supposed to be utterly unmeaning, it came to be rendered by such \" gents \" as had passed a few weeks in Paris or Boulogne, as ce nest pets le fromage. This expression, however,"], [267, "A BALL AT THE KLEMDA. 245 The other forms of the German cotillion are hardly Avorth mentioning here, since they consist of rude there is no doubt, was compounded of the old Saxon term Cyse (choice), from the verb ceosan, to choose (French chosir) for Chaucer, in his \" Canterbury Tales,\" has the line \" To cheese, whether she wold him marry or no.\" Hence the modern slang phrase of \" It isn't the cheese,\" meant merely, \" it isn't what I should choose, or what is agreeable to my choice \" \u2014 the old English term having been preserved for years among the vulgar of our land (for Dr. Latham has well said, that the common people of every country are the conservators of the primitive tongue), and at length bubbling up into decent society \u2014 owing to the modern intercommunion of gentlefolks with prize-fighters, sharpers, and beggars \u2014 as a form of fast life, at a time when the use and meaning of the old English word had become utterly lost to us. In the samo manner, Dr. Pusey \u2014 \u25a0 though he is a strange authority to quote as to the origin of English slang terms \u2014 has suggested, with no little shrewdness, that the word \"patter,\" which, in the English argot means merely to talk, was originally introduced into the vulgar tongue, owing to the custom, in former times, of beggars to chant a \" pater-noster \" or Lord's prayer outside the doors of the houses where they were seeking aims. Indeed, it is beyond question that the \"cant \" language of the beggars originally meant the chanted or intoned language (Latin, cantare); for on the Con tinent it is common to this day, in Catholic countries, for mendicants to enter your vor-saal, and begin singing their Latin prayers, in the hope of extorting a few copper coins from your purse by their affected piety. In fine, so far as our expe rience goes, there is not a vulgar idiom extant among us that is not the remains of some form of expression once current among the people ; and, indeed, the Fioth-sprache (red language, as the Germans call it) of every country would appear to be merely a galimait/ry of obsolete phrases, as well as of snips and gatherings from every other land on the face of the earth. The English slang we know, from our own researches, to contain some few Hin dostani words, got from the gypsies ; Italian, obtained from the old"], [268, "246 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. pranks, such as one would expect to find indulged in by boys in the playground of a school, and are cer tainly not such ceremonies as polite ladies or gentle men would dream of introducing into the sphere of any decent ball-room. These boisterous frolics are carried on only at a late period of the evening, Avhen the gentlemen have become flushed with the wine or beer they have drunk during supper ; and it is by no means unusual, even for a gentleman in the army, at such a time, to be so intoxicated as to faU with his lady partner flat on to the floor, Avhile waltzing Avith her round the room. Such AArild antics consist in the half-tipsy caA-ahers clasping each other's hands and rushing round the ladies in a ling, like a troop of wild Indians ; Avhile each tries with all his force to break the chain at some particular point \u2014 the upshot of the clownish foolery being, that whenever the hand links are broken, the gentlemen claim those ladies for Punch-and-Judy show*men ; Latin words, borrowed from the old Catholic prayer-books ; Saxon words, preserved from the time when that tongue alone was spoken in our land, and, in a word, a little bit of every form of speech all over the globe \u2014 as if a very Babel were revived among us. Hence we incline to the belief that the vulgar English phrase to give a person the sack is, as we said before, but an old forgotten English one, signifying the desire of the master to hand over to the servant such things as belonged to him, and therefore being equivalent to a notice to quit on his part ; for we have no knowledge that it was ever customary in our country for women to bear the heavier burdens, as it is in Germany. Consequently, the English idiom to give a person the sack cannot possibly be considered as an equivalent rendering of the German one \"to give a man the basket\" \u2014 so utterly different is the respect for women between the two countries."], [269, "A BALL AT TIIE ICLEMDA. 247 their partners opposite to whom they may have hap pened to have halted at the end of the sport. Such are the principal dances usuaUy indulged in at these same balls at the \" Klemda\" in Eisenach. Of the company, the manners, the refreshments, and the ordinary style of costume, Ave have stiU to speak. The baUs proper last only throughout the winter months of the year, and during the summer-time such balls are changed for what the Germans call \" Tanz- Vergniigcn \" (dancing amusement), rather than a formal party. On such occasions, after coffee or tea has been partaken of in the gardens, Avhere the band plays from about four tiU eight, the company retire to the baU-room, where polkas, Avaltzes, and Tyroli ennes are kept up tiU midnight. At these parties the costumes, both for ladies and gentlemen, are such as it AA'ould be impossible to find in the lowest casino in London \u2014 the gentlemen appearing in any kind of speckled or coloured pantaloons, with the dirtiest possible boots and gloves \u2014 if indeed the latter luxuries be thought in any Avay necessary \u2014 and the ladies being attired in the commonest cotton print dresses, made with Ioav necks (for such is thought to be the high touch of summer fashion in Eisenach), and each wearing some dowdy trumpery wreath on her head. So that an English person, Avhen he first witnesses the entertainment, cannot help believing that he has tumbled, by accident, into some servants' hall, where the A-alets and the footmen are having a hop Avith the ladies'-maids and other serving-Avomen"], [270, "248 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. of some English nobleman's establishment \u2014 though we doubt very much if, in this comparison, Ave do not libel the servants of our own country, since the better class of English domestics would, on such occasions, assuredly look far more elegant, and less tawdry and dowdy, than these same German gentlefolks when \" out \" for their summer's holiday. Upon other and grander occasions, the cotton-print low-necked ball-dress is laid aside for one of \"book muslin,\" or bright-tinted tarlatan ; for your German young ladies have the same propensity for vivid colours as negro girls, and love to throw as much possible sIioav into their dress for the least-possible amount of money. Hence, every young lady appears a mass of green, or pink, or bright yeUo\\A', or light blue, and with their dresses trimmed merely AA'ith braces or Medici girdles, in sarcenet of the strongest possible contrast ; so that damsels in A\\*hite delight to deck themselves out in black ribbons \u2014 those in pink Avith green ones \u2014 bright yeUow Avith red trimmings, and so forth ; for taste in such matters is utterly un knoA\\*n to the young ladies of Eisenach. Add to this a pair of black stuff boots to dance in, and a wreath about as trumpery and as conspicuous as that worn by the ladies of the corps de ballet at the Italian Opera in England, and the reader may perhaps conceive the amount of display and frippery prevalent on such occasions. The gentlemen, Ave must in all justice admit, appear far better dressed than the members of the fair sex at such grand ceremonies.

Nevertheless, there is no attempt at petty finery on their part, and assuredly the commoner classes of men in Germany dress better, and behave themselves better in baU-rooms than the same members of society in our own country. At the balls of the \" Lieder-Tafel,\" indeed, Ave haA'e seen barbers, and bootmakers, and butchers dressed as neatly and unostentatiously, and found them dance as AveU, and behave as politely as eA*en gentlefolks with us ; for, to be candid, the artizan and lower classes of Germany are as far ahead of our people in this respect as the German gentlefolks are behind our gentry in the same quality ; and Ave can assure the reader that Ave never entered the ball-room at the \" Klemda \" but we felt the same melancholy state of depression at the sight of the paltry finery of the young ladies marching up and down the \" Saal,\" as every decent-minded person must have experienced at witnessing the Avretched shoAA'y women parading the platform outside some dancing-booth or circus at a fair. Nor is this all. If the shabby show and taAvdry finery of the girls themselves on such occasions be hateful to CATery person of the least taste and refine ment, assuredly the Avretched doAvdy appearance of the old mothers who accompany them, and sit ranged against the wall \u2014 each in a dingy black stuff goAvn and a bit of black net on her head by Avay of cap (as grubby as that of an English servant-of-all-work in the morning), and with her large carpet-bag-like"], [272, "250 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. reticule lying in her lap \u2014 constitutes a sight as strange as it is pitiable to every English gentleman Avhen he beholds it for the first time.

The basket-Avomen at Covent Garden Market, as they sit grouped to gether waiting for a job, are the only congregation of elderly females to which we can compare them. Such yelloAv, haggard faces \u2014 such teethless mouths \u2014 such goitre necks (for almost every one of the old women has the \" Kropf\" as the Germans caU it, and wears a bit of black net about her throat to hide the pendulous flesh-bag), never did Ave see coUected to gether before in our lives ; for, as we have already said, it is the peculiar characteristic of a German mother to delight to see her daughter dressed to death \u2014 as shoAvily as the ladies in the upper boxes \u2014 \u25a0 AA'hile she herself finds it no disgrace to appear as shabby as the old hag Avho, in England, is generally found attendant upon such damsels.

Another pecuftarity of such baUs at the \"Ivlemda\" is, that never a father of a family is to be seen in the dancing-hall. The mothers are there, Heaven knows, to a surfeit ! each ready to Avait upon the daughters AAdiom they have accompanied; and the sons are there dancing away with tlieir female friends of the town, but the fathers are all at the beer-houses, playing \" sixty-six,\" and drinking their penny glasses of ale.

There, too, were the Frauleins Shabbymantle laying bets with the other young ladies avIio were engaged to waltz Avith the \" Forst-Pratikants,\" as to which should dance the fastest and keep up the longest round the ball-room ; and twirling away at such a speed that theft crinolined petticoats became distended so high"], [274, "252 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. that even the German mothers round the room (and German mothers are not the most modest ladies in the Avorld) had occasion to teU the girls that the officers Avere making unseemly jokes at the nudity of their limbs.

Indeed, we verily believe we ourselves were the only male person with a grey head in the room, and perhaps the only father in the toAvn who thought it Avorth while to lay aside his oavii particular pleasures, so that his daughter might, under clue supervision, partake of that amuse ment in which the young find special delight. _Ss oav, Ave AviU have supposed the Polonnaise to haA'e finished, and then, in the pause between that and the next dance, Heavens ! what a clatter of shrill, ugly A'oices immediately affrights the ear.

Or maybe you will notice the Mrs. Doctorin Kreuzspriinger performing the pantomime of scraping a carrot as she projects the forefinger of one hand, and rubs it with the fore finger of the other, right under the nose of the officer and gentleman with Avhom she may chance to be jesting \u2014 crying the Avhile \" Schabe ! seltabe Rubehcn !\" (scrape ! scrape a carrot !) after the fashion of the boys in the streets of Eisenach.

Each mother has now drawn from the abyss of her carpet-bag a fresh and dry pocket-handkerchief in readiness for their daughters after the exertion of the dance. \" Dear God I\" cries one elegant young creature, as she stands gasping after her long waltzing, \" Give me the handkerchief, mother, for I am sweating fright fully\" (it is impossible for a young lady to say in German that she perspires freely) ; whereupon all the darlings begin literally mopping the moisture off their face, neck, shoulders, and arms ; and, so far from such an office being considered in any way indelicate to be performed in public, j-ou haA'e but to look round the room to see every young lady engaged in the same refined occupation \u2014 each really scrub bing themselves Avith the mouchoir handed to them, and rubbing away \u2014 in at the creases under their chin and round tlieir nose \u2014 as if they thought it a meri torious, rather than a repulsive, act to make their toilette in the presence of gentlemen. Then the old mothers stoAv away the wet handkerchiefs in the depths of their carpet-bag, and haA'ing supphed their dear girls Avith a feAv raspberry drops, and the small tooth comb as before, proceed to shake out the young ladies' skirts and flounces \u2014 which clone, the conversa tion takes a more general turn. Then the Countess A'on Bittererde begins to tell the Lady of HogstoAvn (Frau von Schwein'sdorf) Avhat"], [279, "257 A BALL AT THE KLEMDA. she had for dinner that day, and to assure her Iioav she ate herself so \" sat \" (fuU \u2014 the common expression with ladies in Eisenach) Avith potatoe-dumplings and prunes, that she is really unable to taste a bit of the \" gracious lady's exceUent lard cake Avhich her gracious ladyship is so kind as to offer her.\" The Fraulein von Frisky comes skipping clumsily up to the little pug-nosed Appellations - Gericlft- Eathin Kranky, who immediately tells the girl Iioav beautiful she looks in that daffodil wreath and cherry-coloured dress, Avith the Magenta ribbons ; and no sooner has the dame uttered the words than she commences rubbing each of the articles, and inquiring what they respectively cost the yard \u2014 -not forgetting to inform the young lady, as the other men tions the prices, that \" it isn't true ;\" adding, in all the extreme frankness of primitive life, that they are not Avorth one-half what the Fraulein states she had paid for them, and that it was a \"great SAvindle \" (grosse Schwindcl) to charge so much for such poor stuff. And no sooner has the Fraulein \\'on Frisky taken her depar ture than the Lady Town-Councillor turns to her neighbour and says, in a squeaky Aroice, \" It wonders me how those girls can afford to dress as they do, for with, butter at the price it is \u2014 and I paid as much as six-and-a-half groschens for the pound I bought at the market this clay \u2014 God in Heaven knows I can hardly manage to buy a new cap-ribbon for myself.\" Whereupon the two dames proceed to discuss the market prices of every article ; now one asks the other Avhat she gave for potatoes, or else how much VOL. i. s"], [280, "258 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. she paid for the Scltoclc of cabbages to make Sauer kraut with, or Avhen they intend to kill their pig, and Iioav many pounds it might weigh, and how much beautiful fat (schone Speck) they expected to get from it. Other ladies at the same time commence indulging in petty disparagements concerning the dresses of those present. \" Look at the Frau Boctorin Kreuzspriinger yonder ! \" says one old crone to the other ; \" how grand she thinks herself in that green Persian skirt of hers, but\u2014 Ach ! the thousand ! \" (another fa vourite oath with the laches here) \" it is nothing but that old summer chess that has been dyed \u2014 for she stood just in front of me, so that I had a good look at it \u2014 and it could never have cost more than ten groschens a yard when it was neAv.\" \" Oh, Jesus ! \" cries another of the most fashion able dames, \"look at those Frauleins Giraffe \u2014 how ever they manage to dress as they do is a mystery to the whole town.\" \" Oh, they buy a lot of the left-off dresses from the laches of the Court at Weimar ! \" exclaims a third dame in a black stuff gown. \"The Fraulein A'on Milchsuppe has just been telling me that the elder one bought that pink tarlatan dress and fuchsia wreath she is now wearing from one of the ladies-in-waiting for a thaler and a half.\" In corroboration of the statement it may be mentioned that it is the common practice Avith the ladies of aU classes to seU tlieir old clothes to their servants, so that sening-maids have hardly been in your house a week before they ask you if"], [281, "A BALL AT THE KLEMDA, 259 you have a pair of old boots you can let them buy of you ; and when you teU them it is the custom of ladies England to give, and not to seU, their left-off clothes to their waiting-maids, the astonished girls stare at you as if they ready thought there was some truth in the German saying, wliich describes our country folk as being verriiclde Englander (mad English people). Then the band strikes up once more, and a polka or Tyrolienne, as the case may be, is indulged in while the little officers stand Avith their legs astraddle \u2014 as if to make the most of themselves \u2014 and with an eye-glass at one eye, grouped in front of the supper- room doors, watching the young ladies spin round and round as if they Avere dancing for a wager, and nudging one another and simpering as the petticoats fly up some- Avhat beyond the bounds of decency. Thus the time passes tiU about nine, Avhen a longer pause ensues, so that supper may be partaken of by such as please to pay for it. Noav, the EngUsh reader must not imagine a supper at the ball at the \" Klemda \" to be in any way similar to those elegant and expensive entertainments which are supphed by confectioners at ten shillings or a guinea a-head towards the conclusion of dances in our own country ; for the \" Elemda \" baU-supper consists of nothing but hot beefsteaks or smoking cutlets, or baked goose and potatoes cooked in fat, to be foUowed, maybe, by herring salads, or a dish of raw ham or sausage ; or such other luxuries as the Avretched kitchen of the landlord Avho rents the s 2"], [282, "260 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. little club \" tap \" may be able to provide. HoAvever, to give the reader a more vivid notion of the delicacy of these bah repasts, we here append the bill of fare usual upon such occasions. It is copied from one of the printed lists which are left lying about on the supper-tables ; and thus the reader AviU not only be able to see the kind of dishes generally partaken of, but, as the prices are affixed in English money, to understand also the nature of the costly banquet the visitor has to look forward to. \u00a3 p \u25a0 e t s t - p a v 1 1 ( ii ( c in b a ) . \\'.d.\\ 1 0 1 4 i e 1 9 2 3 1 6 2 0 6 0 Speisen.

The younger ladies are sel dom or never invited to them. True, at the Christ mas or Easter baUs we have seen one or two treated to champagne on such extra grand occasions ; but as an ordinary rule the gentlemen sit there alone, eating their raw herrings and potato salad, and lapping up the sauce with their knives, and afterwards washing down the meal with half a bottle of some of the cheaper and sourer wines ; for a German palate is so accustomed to Ainegar that ordinary Deutschers are Avont to beheA'e that the bottled acetic acid Avhich is sold as Ehenish table-wine has all the flavour of the juice of ripe grapes appertaining to it. During the supping hour it is customary Avith the ladies remaining in the ball-room to order a cup of tea (and such tea !) of the waiting-maid avIio attends on such occasions ; AA'hile some of the younger ones regale themselves with a glass of lemonade. Then a few shces of dry Avhite bread-cake or apple-cake are drawn from out that corpulent carpet-bag-like reticule, where it has been lying all the while, side by side with the filthy small-tooth comb, and in company Avith the wet pocket-handkerchiefs which the young ladies have returned to their mother, after drying tlieir skins with them. And there the ladies sit sipping and munching the sippets of cake until their cups or glasses are empty. Sometimes these cups of tea, or glasses of lemonade, are sent by the gentlemen to the ladies ; though this is so far from being usual, that the act is considered as a mark of special favour on"], [284, "262 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. the part of the young man aaIio may order such costly refreshment for his former partner in the dance. After supper, during the interval in whicli the gen tlemen are indulging in a more extensive and sohd repast in the adjoining room, the young ladies Avalk about, arm in arm, in twos and threes, up and down the \" Saal,\" while the shop-boys who have tossed off their penny glass of beer, in the veritable tap-room Avhich adjoins the grander supping saloon (for in the latter nothing but wine is aUowed to be drunk) these boys stand in a group in the centre of the dancing room, talking A\\ith one another, and utterly unmind ful of the ladies about them. In fine, it is the fashion in Saxony for the men merely to dance with the Avomen ; for no sooner is the waltz or polka finished than the lady is led back as quickly as possible and deposited by the side of her mother \u2014 the gentleman not thinking it worth his Avhile to exchange a word with her afterwards ; while, as for the old mothers themselves, they rarely receive more than a passing nod from any of their male acquaintances. Seldom or never did we see a gentleman speak to any of the elderly ladies for more than a minute together; for the usual lot of the poor wretched things is to sit against the AA'aUs of the room with out exchanging a Avord with a soul, except the equally desolate old crones next to them. And this is their fate every ball night, from seven tiU often tAvo or three in the morning, tlieir only occu pation being, as we have said, to play the waiting-"], [285, "A BALL AT THE KLEMDA. 263 maid to their girls \u2014 to keep them supplied with relays of pocket-handkerchiefs, and to feed them with raspberry drops as fast as required \u2014 while their only refreshment during these long hours is a cup of the Aveakest and nastiest possible tea, and a slice of sweet dough-cake taken from their musty carpet-bags. What wonder, then, that you have but to look round the baU-room toAvards midnight to see eArery one of the heads of the aged dames in black stuff nodding aAvay, as though they were so many plaster casts of cats with movable necks ranged along the board of some ItaUan image- seUer ? Nor do these miserable old women get many thanks for the ungracious offices they consent to perform ; for Ave haA'e heard the daughters address them, and indeed order them, with far less pohteness than an English young lady would dream of exhibiting towards her regular serving- Avoman. Noav one German Fraulein will cry, \" Come, mother, quick ! give me another pair of gloves ! In God's name ! Iioav long you are, when you knoAv I'm waiting for them ; \" and then another AviU exclaim, in anything but a respectful tone, \" Great God ! I've torn my dress ; you must come with me, and sew it up in the garde-robe. Come along, for I'm engaged for the next Francaise ! \" Indeed, ac cording to our experience, the mode in which the daughters spake to tlieir parents was so utterly want ing in all sense of duty that we are satisfied that any decent English girl would have been more shocked than even we were to hear it. But so it is in Saxony. What Ave said at the be-"], [286, "264 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. ginning of the chapter Ave can but enforce at the end of it. The German mother, in the hope of getting her daughters married, as soon after fifteen as possible, begins washing and starching the girls' baU-dresses and petticoats immediately after their confirmation, and drass them about Avith her to every concert or __) *> dance given among her own society ; while she consents to sit there, with her back against the AvaU, taking no more part in the amusements, and being as utterly disregarded by all the gentlemen present, as if she were one of the cook-maids in the Klein da Gallery. And though the mother begins this species of servitude the very moment her girls have left school, with the view of their catching some \"man\" before they are out of their teens, her bond-slavery in this way generally lasts for ten years at least ; for, as a rule, the women marry much later than with us, so that the mothers are mostly wrinkled and shri velled old women by the time their daughters' dancing days commence. Indeed, svdl one-half of the so-called \"young\" ladies who were in the habit of visiting every Klemda ball were playful little kittens of thirty, if they were a clay. \"Who is that middle-aged lady?\" said we, to a German friend, \" avIio is waltzing with the officer, and spinning over the floor, as if she were some child's humming-top just let loose from the string? \" \" Oh ! she is the daughter of the Baron von Bett 1 r,\" was the answer. \" She has danced here for the last fifteen years, to my knoAvledge, and AviU have to Avear many another pair of boots out, before she can"], [287, "265 A BALL AT THE KLEMDA. find a gentleman ready to exchange rings Avith her. She has no money, you see, and then the girls, with us, may dance till they are grey ; but, I suppose it is the same aft over the world, a lady Avith grey hair and an empty pocket must go to church only to pray, and pass the rest of her days in hugging the children of the poor rather than her oavii. Do you see that buxom lady there, in AAdiite muslin, dressed like a young girl? She is one of the pet lambs that has seen forty sheep-shearings at least, and though she has danced with as many 'forest-men' in her time as Avould be sufficient to clear the backwoods of America, she is but just uoav neAvly betrothed to that long thin gentleman with the sandy moustachios Avhom she has got so fast by the arm. And yet, poor thing, they say in the town that he is only a swindler, and has told it openly in the beer-house that he will never marry her unless she can bring him 2000 thalers (300/.). So Avhat is to become of her, I do not knoAV, since she has only 1500 thalers (225/.) to bless any man with. Oh, yes ! we knoAV every groschen the girls have got here ; and it is no use their dancing unless we fancy we can hear the thalers jingle in their pockets as they go.\" Such, Ave believe, in all truth, is a faithful picture of the manners and customs of the best Saxon society, as seen at these balls at the \" Klemcla.\" The fate of poor Matilda TJberreif is the fate of half of the grcschenless damsels who dance there, and faire ta cour after the forest-men and others, from the time Avhen"], [288, "266 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. their frocks are let down to their days of false fronts. Still the persevering mothers continue to dress the poor things as showily as circus-girls ; still they come and sit and sleep against the wall, night after night ; still they provide them with dry pocket-handkerchiefs and feed them with cake and raspberry drops to give them new life, and the appearance of freshness, for the next dance ; and still hardly a man is entrapped for more than a few weeks' attentions by all their patience, perseverance, and assiduity. The aster-supper ceremonies at the \" Klemda \" are briefly told. Then riot, rather than refined revelry, often prevails. Those officers who haA'e indulged in Avine, and the shop-boys who have taken an extra glass of beer, begin to dance the Francaise with aft kinds of antics ; the more sprightly and fast of the ladies keeping pace with them in the imaginary sport, and practising such A'iolent gestures as the male traveller may have seen performed at \" Mabile,\" or in the dancing-gardens of the Quartier Latin in Paris \u2014 but certainly not in any well-conducted baft-room in either France or England. At such times it is the Avont of the gentlemen, while performing the \" grand chain,\" to rush round and round as if they were so many Eed Indians engaged in some maddening war-dance. And we have before stated that it Avas at this period of the evening that we ourselves saw one of the drunken mditary surgeons, while waltzing, fall with his partner prostrate on the floor. Such an offence might be an accidental one, though, in the Avhole course of our experience, Ave never saw the"], [289, "A BALL AT THE KLEMDA. 267 like \u2014 and yet Ave have, in our time, been present at costermongers' baUs as AveU as at \"friendly leads,\" or dances given by London pickpockets ; we have seen the dancing at Cremorne, and at the several Casinos of the British metropolis, and have watched the frolics of the Parisian students and grisettes at the Chateau des Fleurs, and other similar places in the French capital. But we never, in aU our life, eA*en in any baU-room of the vilest possible character, witnessed so disgraceful an outrage to any young Avoman as this. -And yet, what think you became of the \" officer and gentleman \" who Avas guilty of it ? Why, he was picked up, and quietly conducted home by his comrades ; and the next ball, there the fellow Avas, admitted into the same company, and dancing away Avith the Arery same young lady \u2014 as if neither men nor women considered that any indignity had been offered to tlieir society. These baUs, we repeat, ahvays conclude with the German cotillion, the dancing of which continues sometimes for one or two hours ; after A\\*hich it is the fashion for the gentlemen to send the ladies a cup of hot soup or coffee, according to taste. Then the ladies and gentlemen retire ensemble to the dressing room, where the fair, but not in any Avay bashful, creatures proceed to place tlieir ankles across theft knees and unlace their boots under the very eyes of those with whom they have been lately flirting. On extra grand occasions, hoAvever, the dancing is kept up tiU daylight, and then it is the custom for the young ladies to make parties Avith the gentlemen"], [290, "268 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. to go up to the Wartburg to breakfast ; and there they sit drinking beer or coffee, and eating sausage in the common room of the public-house until the sun is high above the horizon. And AA'hen you happen to meet the elegant damsels in the course of the next day, they do not blush to tell you, in the vernacular of their country, that they are suffering from \" katzen jammer \" \u2014 literally \" cat's misery \" (or, as fast gentle- men Avould phrase it in EngUsh, \" blue deA'ds \") \u2014 that being the German term applied by inordinate beer-drinkers to the sensation Avhich succeeds over- indulgence on the preA'ious night.'5 * While these pages are passing through the press, an enter taining little dramatic scene has been enacted in connection with the elegant institution forming the subject of the present chapter, and wliich will serve to give English people a lively sense of the economy of that establishment. It will be readily understood that a club where the refreshment rooms are rented by the cook ofthe society (who receives no wages), and the prices to be charged for the several eatables and drink ables are fixed by the committee at the lowest-possible figures, there can be little chance of the chef de cuisine \u2014 who may be rash enough to plunge into such an enterprise \u2014 obtaining a living out of the speculation ; especially when, as we have said, it is the cus tom of the ladies, on every ball night, to bring their own refresh ments with them in tlieir own carpet-bags (after the fashion of English maid-servants visiting a theatre) ; and when, moreover, even the few gentlemen who do sup on such occasions, seldom go beyond the luxury of a threepenny-halfpenny beefsteak and a halfpenny plate of salad ; unless, indeed \u2014 in a moment of the wildest prodigality \u2014 they rush, maybe, into the German-princely extravagance of a sevenpenny plate of baked roebuck, or a six penny leg of roast goose. True, we repeat, some of the richer or more reckless, of the young officers (emulating the sumptuous ness of Prussian lieutenants, who, on festive occasions, are said to call for a bottle of champagne and eighteen glasses), are gene-"], [291, "269 A BALL AT TIIE KLEMDA. rally in the habit, at the fortnightly balls, of clubbing together to enjoy, among them, a one-and-fourpenny bottle of Moselwinc; or else of getting up a small company, \" with limited liabilities,\" in order to raise the capital necessary for a one-and-ninepenny bottle of Hockheimer. Nevertheless, when such thoughtless dissipation does not extend, on ordinary occasions, beyond a dozen people at the utmost, and the majority of the other male guests at the Klemda balls \u2014 such as the shop-boys and the chandlers-shop keepers \u2014 are wont to restrain their appetites, and their expenses, within the frugal bounds of a penny glass of beer and a penny sausage-sandwich, it will excite but little wonder on the reader's part to hear that the wretched \" chef,\" who had been insanely sanguine enough to believe that he could subsist upon the profits of such costly banquets, should invariably find himself, at the end ofthe first year of his stewardship, on the threshold of either the Court of Bankruptcy or the Workhouse ; according as he had taken credit or paid ready money for the stock of sausages and sauerkraut, wine and beer, he had laid in, but never sold, for the \"entertainment ofthe men and beasts\" belonging to the society. During the time that we resided in the Thuringian capital, the club had precisely the same number of ': Wirths\" as there were years in the term of our stay \u2014 the Klemda landlord being as de cidedly an annual plant as mustard and cress, and as short-lived as grass \u2014 which, in the expressive words ofthe Psalmist, \" in the morning is green and groweth up ; and in the evening is cut down, dried up, and withered.\" What became of the lirst of the ruined \"chefs' we know not ; whether, like the distracted Vatel (when the fish did not arrive in time for the second course of one of the royal banquets he had to prepare), the poor deranged cook slew himself with his own carving-knife ; or whether he retired from public life with his stock of unsold polonies and saveloys, and is now roaming over the earth \u2014 a wretched restless vagabond (like the AVandering Jew* of old) with nothing but his stale sausages to solace him, we cannot undertake to say. All we can vouch for is that, at the expiration of his year of office, he disappeared as suddenly as an ex-Lord Mayor, and was never heard of afterwards. Eivers were dragged, wells inspected, forests searched, and advertisements in serted entreating him to return or to send back the keys of the wine cellar ; but to no avail. His fate is as much a mystery as"], [292, "270 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. that of the young Dauphin who was carried off in the first French Revolution ; though the general belief is that the poor ruined man, in a fit of despondency, poisoned himself \u2014 with some of his own \" cchte Jamaica Rum.\" The second Klemda Wirth (landlord) met with hardly a less melancholy and rapid end ; but he faced his destiny with all the courage of a Stoic or a British-Bank Director. Months before the fatal twelvemonth had expired, the people in the town fore saw that the wretched man's dissolution was fast approaching. The worst symptoms, indeed, had set in after he had been six months in the place : nine dollars' worth of meat had been cooked for a grand festive occasion, and only twenty groschens' worth sold among the company ; so that the rest of the roast had to be hawked round the town the next day, and disposed of among the few meat-eaters at less than half the prime cost. Casks of wine were obtained upon credit, and sold within twenty four hours after delivery, as a means of getting a little ready money (for even the few 3r,d. beefsteaks he disposed of were not paid for immediately) at fifty per cent, under the wholesale price. At this crisis the legal physicians were called in : and then, of course, there was no hope of the fast-failing man ever getting on his legs again. Dr. Kreuzspinne bled him, Herr Katzenbalgen blistered him, and Messrs. Powder and Shot physicked him with no end of processes, till he could not hold his head up any longer. Accordingly, before many weeks had passed, he was declared bankrupt, and the small remaining stock of eatables and drink ables was seized by the hungry officers of justice, the several members of the club struggling with one another at the sale for the possession of the impounded ham and sausages, pickles and preserves. Now, the abrupt termination put to the career of the late land lord of the principal club in Eisenach made so profound an im pression upon the united cooks and waiters of the city that no one, after the immolation of the last victim, could be found will ing to sacrifice himself, on the altar of the Klemda kitchen-fire, for the delectation of the members as before. Hence, the com mittee were obliged to offer to let anyone, who might be bold enough to take the questionable good-will of the confirmed bad business, have possession of the premises free of all rent what ever \u2014 a proposition which, seeing that they had never yet been"], [293, "271 A BALL AT THE KLEMDA. able to get so much as a peppercorn for it out of the empty cruet stands of the previous occupants, would hardly make much dif ference in the prospects of the future tenant. However, one desperate drowning man, ready to clutch at the veriest straw, was caught by the apparently liberal announcement ; but even he soon began to cry out, in the solitude of the supperless supper rooms, \" Peccavi! Peccavi I\" He had hardly been iu the place a week, before he found out that it was utterly impossible to live upon the profits of five three-farthing glasses of sugar-water, a dozen penny glasses of beer, and three halfpenny glasses of Schnapps (the latter supplied to the Lord Chamberlain), which constituted the extent of his daily custom \u2014 and perhaps some half-dozen o\\d. beefsteaks and one bottle of wine on the grand ball nights every fortnight. Accordingly, the poor man petitioned the committee to be allowed to have his fuel and light gratis, saying that, without this, it would be impossible for him to remain in the desolate place any longer. Whereupon, the puddle was all in a storm; a whirlwind raged among the \"wind-bags\" of the club. Some sided with the wretched \" Wirth,\" while others vowed it was impossible to make any other conces sions, and that it would be better to sell up the entire society. Others, again, were for raising the subscriptions rather than razing the whole establishment \u2014 a proposal which created another tempest in the wash-tub ; for then everybody was asking everybody whether they ever heard of such audacity, and whether -2s. Od. a quarter was not enough in all con science to pay for the finest club in the world? and whether, moreover, anyone thought it possible to find six people in all Eisenach who would, or could, give any more ? In the height of this fury, letters were sent to the newspapers, and as these afford much better illustrations of the character of the people in the Thuringian capital than we could possibly give, we here append a translation of one of them, taken from the \" organ of the progress (!) party,\" \u2014 the said organ being as weak and cracked an old hurdy-gurdy as we ever listened to, and the \" pro gress party \" consisting of such wild innovators as were for the abolition of spittoons and the introduction of foot-baths into the land \u2014 the \" progress \" newspaper itself, too, being about half as large and about as elegantly printed as an English playbill, and written in a style closely allied to \" stump-oratory.\" \" We ask every member of the Klemda Club,\" says a cor-"], [294, "272 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. respondent of the \"progress\" paper, \"for the sake of his own interest, to attend the general meeting of that society, to be held on next Tuesday. According to the order of the day, an attempt is to be made to raise the amount of the subscription. This is rendered necessary, it is said, on account of the present landlord, who pays no reut, declining to remain, unless on the con dition that his expenses of lighting and heating are borne by the society; since it is impossible for him, it is alleged, otherwise to exist, and much more to profit in any way by the undertaking. It is a disputed point whether clubs (geschlossene Gesellschaften\u2014liter ally, closed societies) are adapted to the present time; but that the Klemda Society is not fitted to the age in which we live must long have been clear to every member, since it is scarcely capable of existing. Whoever doubts this need only go to the place itself, and there the frightful desolateness of every room will soon convince anyone that a society of more than 200 members which can maintain a landlord only at the greatest sacrifice is unworthy of further support. The committee have done all that lay in their power to make it a pleasant place of resort for the members, but they have not succeeded in drawing the public to it. The only thing that appears advisable is the breaking up of the establishment and selling off the house and grounds, for which some purchaser would be sure to be found. Any increase of the subscription is useless; it is merely subjecting many to annoyance in order to gratify a few.\" \u2014 (Tkuringer Landes -zeitung, Organ der Fortschrittspartei, Sunday, the 20th July.) It is exquisitely comic to find the \" progress \" advocate inform ing the poor benighted Eisenachers that \" it is a disputed point whether clubs are adapted lo the present time!\" (Es lasst sich streiten iiber die Zcitgemdssheit der geschlossenen Gesellschaften), when we in England date the improvement of society from the com mencement of such institutions ; since they assuredly have done more to withdraw gentlefolks from coarse tavern-life than any other social appliance. In Germany, however, where pot-houses and pot-house amenities prevail on every side, it is evident that a society in antagonism with such practices must find it extremely difficult to prolong its existence. In a hundred years hence, perhaps, the Germans mag be fit for such institutions ; but that the Deutschers of the present day are not adapted for a club-life (as opposed to a public-house one) we perfectly agree with the organ of the \" progress \" party in Eisenach."], [295, "CHAPTER IV. THE AMUSEMENTS OF THE THURINGIAN PEOPLE. In the present chapter Ave purpose, not only setting forth Avhat are the principal forms of enjoyment, after the clay's business has come to an end, among the modern Saxons, hut also estimating, as Ave run oA'er the different modes of pleasure, what proportion of the average income of the middle classes is deA'oted to the several items of unnecessary expenditure. Labour and amusement are, of course, the _avo oppo site extremes of the economical scale : the former being the main means of producing wealth, and the latter that of consuming or destroying it. Human necessities involve a certain amount of consumption truly ; but the food and commodities thus dissipated can hardly be said to be annihilated ; since, if it be one of the primeval laAvs of human life that \" he that Avill not Avork, neither shall he eat,\" it is an equally fundamental canon of nature that Avithout food, labour cannot be sustained. Hence the wealth expended in proper nutriment, raiment, and shelter, is by no means lost, either to the individual or the community, but comes back in the form of renewed strength, and that fitness for future exertion, which, indeed, is the work ing man's only capital. The money, hoAvever, devoted VOL. i. t"], [296, "274 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. to mere amusements is utterly squandered ; unless such amusements partake of the character of those recreations, which often serve to re-invigorate ex hausted nature more even than brute rest itself. Many amusements, however, so far from being refreshing to the frame, tend to render it less, rather than better, fitted for the next clay's business of the world; not only by producing the same amount of lassitude as labour itself, when carried to excess, but by making hard work appear even harder, and therefore more naturally distasteful to the workman. Hence, in a country where amusements prevail to an inordinate degree, po\\rerty must likewise prevail among the people to a large extent ; not only because they squander more in unnecessary indulgences, but, because of their squandering more in such a Avay, they become more indisposed to the irksome toil of prolonged muscular exertion, and are therefore prone to earn less than such folk as are more industrious and less voluptuous. Nor is this aU : the wealth expended in substantial food, sensible clothing, and comfortable housing returns, as we have said, Avith profit to the individual, in the shape of increased activity and energy, and the consequent capacity for the produc tion of even a greater amount of wealth than has been consumed. But Avhere an undue proportion of the earnings is lavished on what is unnecessary, it is obvious, there must be a correspondingly-undue pro portion left for the supply of Avhat is necessary for human existence ; and thus the wholesome quality of the food and the housing has to be reduced, to such an"], [297, "AMUSEMENTS OF THE TIIURINGIANS. 275 extent, that the health and strength of the labourer, as Avell as that muscular irritability wliich is the physical cause of industry, get to be gradually lowered ; tiU at length such is the continual lassitude of the frame, that Avorkmen go about their work like slaves, whom nothing but the sharpest goad can rouse to the least exertion \u2014 rather than as freemen haAnng to Uve hy the sweat of their broAV, and labouring for their own benefit. Whether beer-drinking, and smoking, ought to be ranked under the head of amusements, we leave others to say. Certainly, such indulgences cannot be classed among the necessities of life, nor do they belong properly to those creature-comforts Avhich even an ascetic now-a-days admits as being pardonable indul gences. Fanatic teetotaUers, of course, consider every kind of stimulant as a Avicked waste of money. Such opinions, however, are adopted by but few of the calm reasoners of the present day ; nevertheless, all decent-minded persons must allow that the squan dering of a large proportion of the income in such coarse pleasures is no slight evil in a country, where the practice prevails to such an extent as to be the ordinary rule, rather than the extraordinary exception. Germans are in the habit of speaking of the poverty of their nation as if it formed part of the inscrutable decrees of Providence, and was in no Avay connected with the faults of tlieir countrymen, or the short comings of their rulers. There is, hoAvever, one simple explanation to be given concerning the beggarhness t 2"], [298, "276 HERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. of the German folk, individually considered \u2014 and that is the common-sense rule of poA'erty all over the world, which teaches us that those avIio are con tinuaUy expending the greater part of what they earn in sensual indulgence, and consequently earning less than they otherwise AArould, must ever remain steeped to the Arery lips in social degradation. So far as our experience goes (and Ave have endeavoured to test individual observation by the collection of general statistics on the matter), a German spends at least double and treble what an Englishman does upon amusements ; that is to say, a larger proportion of every German's income, as a rule, is deA'oted to unne cessary things, and consequently a smaller proportion left for what we consider essential to the maintenance of home, as weU as for after-use in the different enter prizes of commerce. If a man consents, for the mere momentary gratification of his eye to bloAV some pounds sterling away into the air, at repeated inter vals, in the shape of fireworks, common-senserteaches us that the money so expended is utterly lost and wasted ; whereas, if the same amount of wealth be deA'oted to the fertilization of the soil, the same common-sense tells us that the wealth invested in the labour AviU never disappear, but come back again, year aster year, Avith a considerable sum added to it, as profit for the undertaking. With drinking and smoking, however, and indeed Avith every form of idle amusement, the money devoted to the luxury is not only wholly lost to the community \u2022vanishing as entirely from the nation as if a blight"], [299, "AMUSEMENTS OF THE THURINGIANS. 277 had come over the land \u2014 but the worst of such Avaste ful expenditure is, that the persons indulging in it are generally unfitted for those after-exertions which are the only means of replenishing the pockets. Recrea tion, of course, is a necessary enjoyment ; for not even rest re-invigorates the faculties, when exhausted by prolonged labour, so much as relaxation \u2014 or the in dulgence in those light mental and physical pastimes which make up the decent amusements after work, and which are aptly termed the diversions of a people. When the energies are flagging, too, perhaps even a gentle stimulant may he regarded as a natural restora tive. In England, however, Avhere the people work at least twice as hard, doing certainly double the Avork in the same time, as the men of any other nation, assuredly not half the proportion of the in come is spent in such stimulants as among the German people. Where, however, a large amount is devoted to drink, a smaller amount necessarily re mains for the purchase of Avholesome substantial food ; and an under-fed Avorkman, growing tired over his labour sooner than a weU-fed one, begins to crave for stimulants to put fresh temporary energy into his muscles, oftener than does the strong healthy artisan ; so that thus a continually degenerating and degrading process goes on. Debilitated and emaciated by the want of proper nutritious food, the workman is, in a measure, compelled to resort to such restoratives as will, for the time being, supply him Avith energy enough to set through his day's task ; and is conse quently left without the means of obtaining such"], [300, "278 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. sohd nutriment as can alone enable him to acquire a sufficient stock of permanent strength to perform his labour Avithout having recourse to repeated chams. Now, the Germans, from the date of theft earhest history, have been notorious for theft drinking habits, and to this day the quantity of beer and Schnapps SAvaUowed by them affrights every Enghshman, when he comes to be acquainted with the general custom. True, there is less surface drunkenness than in our own countiy ; for it is an unusual sight to see a tipsy man in the streets of any German city. Certainly, we haA-e, during our residence in the \" fatherland,\" AA'itnessed schoolmasters tumble off their seats because tlieir head had become heavier than their heels ; and clergymen on the Sunday night faU flat on their stomach directly they attempted to rise from tlieir chairs \u2014 and Ave assuredly never saw the same extent of intemperance among [the same classes in our own land. Nevertheless, we repeat that such sights are by no means common, and the rule is apparent sobriety throughout the nation. But we haA'e elsewhere said intoxication is the outward and Ansible sign of occasional, rather than habitual, intemperance. At Avine parties it is always the young gentlemen A\\dio are unused to such excesses, that are the first to disappear under the table ; the old seasoned drinkers, AAdio love to boast that they can take their two bottles of port Avithout being in the least excited bj' the drink, being able to sit the night through, and yet Avalk home as steadily as tight rope dancers. The same rule holds good in Germany."], [301, "AMUSEMENTS OF THE THURINGIANS. 279 There aU the people are accustomed to excessive drinking, and therefore feAv, or none, ever appear drunk. In our countiy, however, Avhere working men drink hard on the Saturday or the Monday after receiving their Avages, intoxication is far more common ; simply because hard drinking is far less general than among the German folk. And when we tell the reader that many a German student delights to brag that he can drink more glasses of beer at one sitting than he is years old, we leave decent people to con ceive what must be the state of things in a nation where youths at universities consider the consumption of two-and-a-half gallons of beer in an evening to be tlieir greatest glory ; and where every father of a family drinks between four and fh'e gallons of the same fluid in the course of the week. The labourers at the hreAvhouses in Eisenach, where they are aUoAved as much as they can swaUow gratis, often drink as many as eighty pint-glasses, or ten gallons of beer during the clay. Indeed, a true German will live upon anything, and sleep and dwell anyhoAv or any where, in order to have money enough to spend in the beer-house or tavern at nights, and to waste upon such pleasures as the customs of the countiy have taught him to delight in. Let us now, therefore, proceed to give the reader a detailed account, not only ofthe ordinary amusements of the German people, but also to sIioav him how large a proportion of their petty incomes is devoted to unne cessary enjoyments ; and then, by letting him see Iioav"], [302, "280 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. little remains for the common necessities of life, teach him why it is that potatoes and black bread, and straw beds and bare floors, are the usual comforts of a German gentleman's home. It must be borne in mind that 300\u2014400 thalers, or 45/. \u2014 60/. per annum, is by no means a small sum of money for a gentle man to receive yearly in the Thuringian capital. It will hereafter be seen, by the official accounts, that the city judge (the Stadt-richter, or deputy-magistrate) gets no more than GO/, per annum. We should add, too, that the statements hereafter given, as to the average expenditure of each lather of a family, or grown male person in middle-class life, have been prepared in company with Germans themselves, and that wheneA'er tAvo different sums have been men tioned as to the amount devoted to this or that particular enjoyment, we have invariably preferred to adopt the lower figure, so that the general expense might be kept as moderate as possible. First and foremost, then, come the items of beer drinking and smoking, which, at the lowest calcula tion, must be taken at five groschens, or sixpence a day, for six days in the Aveek, and this gives us a gross outlay of 52 thalers, or 77 15s. in the course of the year. After this, Ave haA^e the expenses of the Sundays, and these, in almost eA*ery case, amount to 15 groschens, or Is. Gd. throughout the day; for it is the general custom in Eisenach for the citizens to begin dropping into the beer-houses at ten in the morning. Indeed, hardly a groAvn man in the toAvn ever dreams of going to church \u2014 the congregation"], [303, "281 AMUSEMENTS OF THE THURINGIANS. consisting almost entirely of the old women and children. [ After the mid-day dinner, a walls; is usually taken to the suburbs, and a halt made at one of the beer-gardens in the neighbourhood, or else a visit paid to the concert at the \" Fantasie \" (a tavern in the outskirts so called), where, of course, more beer is drunk. Indeed, it Avill be seen, by the extracts hereafter given from the journals of Thuringia, that Sunday is the principal day for amusements, for on the Sabbath not only are all the grand balls held, but the principal concerts given, e.g. : On \u00a9nut nil, t(<c 26tl) Dcto&ec, in cafe of goob li'cotljcr/ <2ciicci*t=music in tlje So.

After this the gentleman returns home to his supper at six or seven ; and immediately this is SAvaUoAvecl he retires to pass the remainder of the evening, drinking, smoking, playing cards or biUiards, either at the \"Felsen Keller\" (Rock-cellar), the \" Eath's Keller\" (ToAvn-councillor's cellar), or the \" Zahn-Liicke \" (Hollow-tooth), or the \" Garkiiche \" (Cook-shop), or the \"Gansens Ei\" (Goose-egg), or the \"Dunst\" (the Fog), or the \" Mohren\" (Blackamoor), or the \" Lowen \" (Lion), or the \" Stadt Graben \" (the Town-ditch), or the \"Engel\" (Angel), or the \"Krone\" (Crown); or, indeed, at any one of the forty different taverns in the town Avhere he has been informed a good glass of beer is to be obtained. The gross sum of money thus expended on the Sundays amounts to 26 thalers, or"], [304, "282 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. 3/. 1 Ss. per annum, over and above the sum which is laid out for beer during the Aveek-days. Next in the list come the holidays, of which there are thirteen entire clays in the course of the .Avelve month ; and such is the general cessation from labour, that not even bread is baked at such times. Of these holidays three occur at Christmas, one day at the NeAv Year, three at Easter, three at Whitsuntide, one on Ascension-day, and tAvo on certain ordained days of so-called penance and fasting (Busse-tage) \u2014 the penance and fasting consisting, like the enjoyments on other holidays, in universal beer-drinking, smoking, and gambling. It is true, that divine service is per formed in the churches, but the pews are empty, Avhile the beer-house tables are crowded on such occasions. The bay window of our lodgings happened to over look the entrance to one of the principal chinches in Eisenach, and (excepting on New Year's Day, when the majority of people seemed to consider that atten dance at Divine Sendee once in the j'ear was a neces sary \"example\" to be set to the younger and poorer portion of the community,) we can avow that we neArer saw more than a dozen groAvn males leaving the church-cloors at the conclusion of the sendee. Those who think church-going a test of the morals of a country (and Sir John Dean Paid, be it remem bered, visited a place of worship three times every Sabbath) may take this fact for what they consider it worth ; but Ave cite it here to sIioav merely that the Avorship of Cambrinus (the German god of beer,"], [305, "AMUSEMENTS OE THE THURINGIANS. 283 whose portrait hangs in almost every tavern) is the chief idolatry of the country. So early on these \" feast days \" do the merry making ceremonies begin, that it is the usual practice for the people at Whitsuntide to go out into the Avoods before it is light and breakfast upon some hill top at sunrise ; nor can you get a servant to remain in the house during the hohday-time. At every one of the lower taverns during the feast-days, baUs are given eArery night \u2014 bafts that the reader may form some notion of, when he is told that the common name for them is one of the most opprobrious description ; and where, indeed, a Londoner who has seen every form of vice and crime in his oavii country is shocked by the sights of such indecorum, as it would be utterly impossible to witness at the lowest \" friendly lead,\" or costermongers' \" hop,\" in the British metro polis. To one or other of such balls evrery Saxon serving-maid insists upon going ; nor is it usual for the girl to return home to her bed tiU early the next morning. Here is an advertisement concerning the opening of a neAv \" dance saloon,\" resorted to principally by the servant-girls and common soldiers of the town. It will be seen that the \" inauguration \" of the Assembly Rooms was fixed for the first Feier-tag, which literally signifies the first consecrated or holy rest-day ; for though we have rendered this word as \"holiday,\" simply because there is no equivalent term in the EngUsh language for the phrase, it must be borne in mind that such Feier-tage are distinct from"], [306, "284 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. ordinary EngUsh holidays ; for in Thuringia not only is aU worldly work legally forbidden upon such occa sions, but divine sendee is performed in each of the churches at least once a day during the time. \"Joe tljc inauguration of out nci.

The latter part of the above advertisement wdl afford the English reader a A'iA'id idea as to the polite nature of the guests congregated together at such dances. We should add, however, in all fairness, that so far from such dances being a type of the more respectable assemblies of the toAArn's-folk, that the public prohibition of nails in the boots of the dancers, by the landladies of the tavern, was con sidered an excellent joke in the city ; and roars of laughter ensued at the theatre Avhen the Ioav come dian, in allusion to the announcement, assured the audience that a blacksmith was kept at the doors for the purpose of extracting the hob-nails from the boots of the ladies and gentlemen, preA'ious to their waltzing. For Aveeks before these holidays occur eA'ery kind of privation is submitted to at home in order to save up for the enjoyment \u2014 the common remark"], [307, "285 AMUSEMENTS OF THE THURINGIANS. being, \" Oh ! Ave must be sparesome now, the feast days are near at hand.\" Among the better-to-do, at the holiday time, it is the practice to club to gether and hire a cart, along Avhich planks are ar ranged, so that some eighteen or twenty persons may be seated in it as in the pleasure A*ans \u2014 popular among our Avorking-classes and school-children \u2014 and these go off for a day's excursion into the countiy. Many of the younger men make up \" walking parties \" into the Thuringian Forest, or to the top of the In selsberg; Avhile those who remain behind wander out to the taverns in the outskirts, at some one of which there is sure to be a concert, and at others a ball. On such occasions Ave are informed that every grown male in middle-class life spends, at least, one thaler the day; and this for thirteen such days makes a gross expenditure of thirteen thalers, or It. Ids. in the course of the year. Another grand feast, held in eArery German toAvn in the course of the twelvemonth, is Avhat is termed the \" bird-shooting,\" at which a large wooden image of an eagle is the target ; and he avIio shoots aAvay the last remaining portion of the bird is proclaimed king of the shooters for the next year, and becomes the winner of a small prize. Any person avIio pleases to pay 20 groschens for the sport, may have the pleasure of shooting at the carved block of Avood, and for this sum he gets either one or tAvo shots, according to the number of subscribers on the occasion. The skill displayed at such times is but poor school-boy work at best, and the rifles used almost as lumber-"], [308, "286 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. ing as blunderbusses. Everyone shoots Avith a rest, and the top of the gun is generaUy fitted with no end of optical apparatus, such as telescopic glasses, and three or four sight-holes along the barrel to ensure a perfect aim ; but notAvithstanding all this parapher nalia, the majority miss the mark \u2014 it taking at least six days' continual firing before every bit of wood is brought to the ground, although the distance is but a hundred yards at best. Indeed, the German riflemen will hardly credit that our volunteers are in the habit of shooting, aye, and hitting the mark, too, at from 600 to 1000 paces; and one gentleman, who professed to have been a celebrated German sports man (!) in his day, obliged us by teUing us that it was not possible to make a gun that would carry a buUet, with anything like certainty, at such a range.* * We append a literal translation of the advertisements which appear in the papers at such times. yrogiamme Of tliiS gear'.

Most of the citizens in Eisenach belong to some skittle-club, the meetings of Avhich are held once in the Aveek at one of the taverns in the neighbourhood \u2014 and among the forty beer-houses in the town there are no less than tAvelve skittle-grounds \u2014 so that the reader can imagine how general the game must be among the people. jNoav each of such games costs one penny (even when no money is played for), and some two or three groschens are often lost or Avon at that peculiar form of the game, which the Germans caU Bred. Moreover, there are, at least, eight billiard-tables distributed throughout the forty taverns. Here, again, each game costs a groschen, and Avhen \" pool \" is played, as it often is, in the evening, the stakes are three-halfpence each player. Further, card-playing at everyone of the beer-houses is so common, that it certainly is the exception with the tavern frequenters not to play their tAvo or three games at \" sixty-six,\" or \" Scat,\" for stakes which range from the tAvelfth to the sixth of a penny English ; nevertheless, smaU as the stakes may seem, many a groschen exchanges hands in the course of the evening. This uni versal gambling, indeed, is another of the eA'ds be gotten by the universal pot-house practices of the Saxon people. A man cannot sit drinking and talking snip-snip aU the evening through ; and there fore, to Avhile aAvay the time in the tavern, cards and every other low art are introduced, so that the"], [311, "289 AMUSEMENTS OF THE THUEINGIANS. beer-drinker may be seduced into sitting longer, and drinking deeper, than he otherwise Avould. After considting with the best-informed Germans as to the amount of money thus wasted by their countrymen in the course of each week, Ave are assured that 10 groschens, or Is. a man, is a very moderate estimate ; but even this sum, smaU as it seems, amounts in the course of the year to 2/. 12_\\, which has to be added to the other unnecessary expenses before men tioned. Eut eA-en as the beer-house habits of the Germans naturally beget habits of card-playing, biUiard and skittle-playing, and, indeed, aU those low forms of gaming, which the louters at public-houses delight to indulge in ; so does the love of gambling thus en gendered give rise, in its turn, to an utter distrust in those forms of industry and enterprise as the means of obtaining wealth, Avhich are the marked characteristics of our own countrymen. In Germany, hoAvever, the people, thus educated night after night in the taverns, have lost all belief in self-rehance, and put such faith in lotteries, as the means of amassing riches, that there is hardly a Avell-to-do man, or merchant, avIio does not spend his five thalers a-year in the purchase of an eighth share in some one or other of the Government Avheels of fortune through out the country ; and so jealous are the petty ruleis of the Erincipahties lest the people under their despotic control should gamble in any lottery but that in Avhich they have some special interest, that there is generally in each community a law restrict- vol. I. u"], [312, "290 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. ing every person from gambUng in any other than the Grand Duke's oavii particular \" heft.\" This was the case in Saxe Weimar. Every person avIio played in any other lottery than that of Leipzig (which belongs to the King of Saxony) Avas hable to a heaAy sine; but in that he AAras welcome to beggar eveiy person belonging to him, because the heartless au thorities happened to be enriched by such means. Nor does the love of gambling thus begotten end here. In the neighbouring capital of Gotha, at the time of the \" bird-shooting,\" a roulette table is aUowed by the brother of our own Prince Albert, from Avhich the Grand Duke Ernst thinks it no disgrace to derive 2000 thalers eA-ery year; and thither the Eisenach citizens and master tradesmen, and, indeed, even the journeymen, were in the habit of wending their way ; but, though Ave heard of many a one who was obliged to walk back, because he had not even the money lest to pay his radway expenses, Ave never kneAV of one silly gambler who had gained even a thaler or tAvo by the trip. Thus much for the money spent in drinking and gambling by the Eisenach burgers. We have pur posely set doAvn the amount of money lost in such transactions at the smallest sum possible, because everyone of our friends told us it Avas difficult to arrive at anything like positive information upon such a matter; and Ave, therefore, have enumerated only such expenses as are known to be incurred by the generality of the better-to-do classes in the tOAA'U."], [313, "CHAPTEE V, THE AMUSEMENTS OF THE TIIURINGIAN PEOPLE (Continued.) We now come to the expenses incurred by the female members of every German household in connection Avith beer-gardens and taverns ; for, though it is not the custom with Saxon laches to visit public-houses at night-time, it is considered to be by no means un ladylike to frequent the same places in the afternoon. Indeed, it is the invariable custom for the wives of officers, daughters of judges, and even for the family of the lord chamberlain and the mayor and deputy mayors to stroU out tAvice or thrice a-week to one or other of the suburban taverns, and there chink theft coffee, or glass of beer, with, it may be, a half-pint of raspberry lemonade as a finish to the entertainment. But even in these boorish practices there is a would be fashion ; for you are told that no lady can be seen at this public-house on a Monday, though on a Tues day or a Thursday it is considered the \"correct tiring \" for a gentleAvoman to appear there.

In the summer time it was thought fashionable for the laches to frequent the beer-house caUed the \"Fantasie\" every Tuesday and Saturday ; and so it went on, there Avas a particular day for each of the gentleAVomen to visit each of the public-houses in the suburbs. These visits usually occur between the hours of three and six, it being the custom to assemble there shortly after dinner, and to remain untd nearly supper time. On such occasions, the ladies generally take their cake or their rolls and sausage Avrapped up in paper in tlieir pocket, and these they eat with their coffee ; it beine. the common custom at such times for the c_> gentleAvomen, both young and old, to throAV a lump of sugar into their mouth, and then to suck the coffee through it ; and, AA'hen this elegant opera tion has been gone through, to dip the sippets of cake, or the bits of rolls they haA'e brought with them, into the cup, and lap up the wet mess untd the AA'hole has disappeared. After this a glass of beer, or raspberry lemonade, is the usual beverage partaken of by the SAveet creatures ; and there they sit knitting and talking scandal in the public-house till, as Ave have said, the hour for their \" man's \" supper draws near. In this manner Ave are comrinced, and moreover confirmed and upheld in our opinion by many of the most respectable citizens of Eisenach, that at least betAveen five and ten groschens are expended by every weU-to-do family in the Aveek. At such times the mother and daughter are present; and"], [315, "AMUSEMENTS OF THE THURINGIANS. 293 saying that the ladies resort only twice in the Aveek to the beer-house, and spend only 2\\d. each on either occasion, the sum-total amounts to the larger sum before mentioned. HoAvever, to be within the mark let us adopt the loAver estimate, and we thus come to the conclusion that at least 8 thalers, 20 groschens (or 11. 6s. English) is squandered every year by every German household in this manner. Remember, Ave are not speaking of individual practices but national customs, and in the estimate we adopt we have again preferred the loAver to the higher calculation. Moreover, every person aboA'e the grade of a Avorking man in Eisenach belongs to one or other of the tAvo clubs in the town, the \" Klemda,\" or the \" Erholung,\" as they are called, the former being the institution of the gentry, so to speak, and the latter of the citizens ; though the one seems to be in the same state of bewilderment as to Avhere gentry ends and citizenship begins, as the other is as to the ultimatum of citizenship, and the beginning of servitude. At the \"Klemda,\" shop-boys and chandler's- shopkeepers are aUoAved to rank among the \" superior classes;\" Avhile at the \" Erholung,\" decent, Avell-conducted girls, who happen to serve in pastry-cooks' shops, are excluded as servants, even though linen-drapers' young men, acting in the same capacity, are admitted as gen tlemen at the more fashionable institution. The subscription to these so-caUed clubs ranges from 3 thalers 15 gros., to 3 thalers 20 gros., or from 10-5. 6c/. to 11*. the year; though we need"], [316, "294 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. hardly inform the EngUsh reader that such in stitutions are as unlike English clubs, in all their appurtenances and comforts, as a Casino is imUke Almack's, or a Music HaU unlike the Italian Opera. However, with such forms of Use it is not our purpose to deal at the present moment, om* object being merely to calculate the amount of money which the Germans give up to such indulgences ; so, taking the subscription to the \" Erholung,\" or lower club, as the ride, we haA'e the yearly expense of 3 thalers 15 gros., or 10s. 6d. deA^oted by each head of a family to the maintenance of the Eisenach clubs in the course of the twelvemonth. Now, at each of these clubs, ft is customary to hold a ball every fortnight throughout the Avinter, for, as we have said before, the gentry are too poor to give such entertainments, as with us, at their own houses ; and at each of these bafts the aA'erage amount of expenditure is, at the very least, fifteen groschens every Iavo weeks, and then multiplying these fort nightly dances by tAventy-six, Ave have a gross expense of 13 thalers, or 1/. 19s. per annum. Previous to any winter baU or summer dancing amusement taking place at either of the clubs of Eisenach, an advertisement is inserted in the Uttle hand-bill of a newspaper.

Indeed, dramatic construction is utterly un knoAvn in Germany, for eAren SchiUer himself has but little of the true faculty of action in his plays, the characters often having to mouth some hundred Unes of A-erse, during Avhich the progressive movement of the story comes to a dead halt. The German genius is essentiaUy of a didactic character, and in aU their plays, as in all their stories, they love to prose, till those Avho look for entertainment and expect, to be interested, rather than lectured to, in such Avorks, are compelled to gape at the very pla titudes to AA'hich they are doomed to listen. German acting, again, is mere dull sing-song declamation, and actors whom Ave heard professors declare to have \" organs \" Avhich pierced the heart, were to any person Avho had seen the leading performers of England and France, but poor elocutionary puppets, lacking entirely that fire of soul and that A'ivid poAver of impersonation Avhich belongs to a true Talma or a Kean. Indeed, the best German performers Avhom Ave listened to were nothing more than ordinary school boys reciting a speech at a distribution of prizes."], [320, "298 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Upon such entertainments the Eisenachers, as a ride, Avasted about 15 gros., or Is. Gd., each man during the season, the common custom being for each person to go thrice during the six weeks ; of course, many of the officers and others were there night after night, and some of these informed us that they had subscribed for 5 thalers' worth of tickets at the commencement of the season. Nevertheless, such an outlay was by no means general ; and, so far as we coidd learn, the estimate we have given above appeared to be a fair average of the money thus spent by the citizens. One class of amusement is pecuftar to Germany. The Choral Societies which have sprung up in Eng land of late years are mere imitations of the singing-clubs which prevail throughout the whole of the Fatherland. In the Thuringian capital alone there were the Sing Verein (literally the \" Singing Union \"), the Lieder Kranz (\" Song Circle \"), Lieder Basel (\"Song Tablet\"), the Manner Cl/or (\"Men's Choir\"), and the Manner Gesangverein (\"Men's Singing Club\"). Each of these five societies con sists of between 100 and 200 members, actft'e as well as passive ; so that, as there are only 1248 houses in Eisenach, the reader will readily understand that in such a town almost every grown male belongs to one or other of the singing-clubs. Such societies are almost invariably held at public-houses, or those joint-stock pot-houses which pass by the name of clubs in Eisenach. The subscription is mostly 1 thaler 5 gros., or Ss. 6d. the year, and for this the"], [321, "AMUSEMENTS OF THE THURINGIANS. 299 members are entitled to admission to the concerts and baUs, whicli occur every six Aveeks throughout the tAvelvemonth. Such entertainments constitute the most agreeable pastimes in every German town, for everyone must admit that this people has the facidty of singing in unison Avith wonderful precision, taste, and exceUence ; and the fine German music is ren dered, on such occasions, eA'en by amateurs, in a most masterly manner. Almost every native is able to read music at sight ; indeed, it is the common practice at the schools to teach the scholars to sing from notes, so that the faculty thus early educated, and contftmaUy exercised in aster life, comes to be one of the most distinctive characters of the people. Wherever you go you are sure to hear some chorus floating in the air ; in your walks in the Avoods the sounds are Avafted from some neighbouring hftl-top ; in the A'alley some party is assembled at one of the little \" garden-houses,\" and a chorus admirably sung echoes among the neighbouring rocks. In the dead of the night you hear the people singing along the streets in a band as they return from the taverns ; or maybe you are aroused from your slumbers by the A'oices of an entire choir serenading the president of the club at midnight, on his birthday. But if the Germans possess the facidty of singing together in exquisite unison, they assuredly lack the power of singing alone with anything like ordinary merit. We were in the habit of attending many of the concerts given by these choral societies, and certainly never had our ears pierced in so disagreeable"], [322, "300 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. a manner as by the wretched execution of the solo performers. Almost everyone thinks it necessary to sing either in his throat or through his nose ; and when Ave first became residents in the town there Avas a great fuss made about the vocal poAver of one of the young laches belonging to the Sing Ver ein. So highly, indeed, was her musical talent appreciated that, on her marriage, an entertainment was given, in which one of the officers enacted the part of a birdseller, and entering the room AAdth a lot of cages over his shoulder, called upon the bridegroom to give back to the citizens of Eisenach the nightingale which he was about to deprive them of. This same nightingale, however, we can assure the reader, was but a sorry lark ; and, beside any girl of ordinary vocal merit in an English draAA'ing-room, Avould haA'e appeared very like a goose. But the Eisenach young ladies are not generaUy instructed in the piano, the custom in Germany being that the gentlemen rather than the ladies should be trained in the study of some instrument. Well, as we have said, there is generaUy a ball and concert in connection with each of these clubs every six Aveeks, and on the anniversary of the founding of the institution an extra-grand entertainment is usually given. At the ordinary dances the gentle men regale themselves with beer and sausages, or may be a so-called beefsteak, about as big as the palm of one's hand, A\\*hile a cup of tea and slice of cake is the usual repast of the ladies. On the \" year's clay,\" hoAvever, the common practice is for"], [323, "301 AMUSEMENTS OF THE THTJ RINGIANS. each of the gentlemen to indulge in a bottle of eighteen-penny Avine and to feast themselves at supper Avith a portion of baked goose or hare, as the season may afford \u2014 an enjoyment for Avhich they are in the habit of stinting themselves, or saving-up, as they call it, for many a Aveek before. HoweA'er, lumping the extraordinary with the ordinary enter tainments, and assuming that only 15 gros., or 1*. 6c/., is spent at each ball eA'ery six weeks, Ave have a gross yearly expense of 4 thalers, or 12*., thus incurred, in addition to the subscription to the club itself. Nor is the long Ust of the sums devoted by the Germans to the matter of amusements yet completed. Indeed, what AA'ith baUs at the \"Erholung\" or the \" Klemda\" \u2014 the balls at the different singing-clubs in the toAvn \u2014 balls at the taverns in the city, or the suburbs \u2014 skittle-clubs, and coffee-drinkings, either at Fischbach or the \" Fantasie \" \u2014 card-playing and bil liard-playing in the beer-houses, at night \u2014 the women as well as the men were in the habit of passing more evenings outside tlieir houses than AAnthin them ; so that a sober, decent Englishman, when he heard the fools complain of the poverty of their people, and knew hoAV much time they gave up to pleasure, and Iioav little to work, could hardly refrain from telling them that the penury Avas of tlieir OAvn begetting ; and that so long as the mass of the people (ladies as weU as gentlemen) had the habits of beggars and vagabonds, so long must they remain beggars and vagabonds in the eyes of all civilized Europe. The cheapness of the amusements before enu-"], [324, "302 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. merated cannot fail to have struck the Enghsh reader. It may appear delightful that people can go out into the countiy and enjoy themselves for twopence-half penny, or sixpence a head ; that the expenses of a bad (supper included) should be limited to eighteenpence ; that a night's entertainment at a theatre can be had for sixpence, or at the utmost ninepence of our money ; that billiards and skittles can be played for a penny a game ; and that even card-playing, for money, is limited to the twelfth, or the sixth of a penny, per point. AU this appears very primitive and very harmless as we read it item by item, but when Ave come to sum up the Avhole of the petty figures, and to bear in mind, as we said before, that the income of a German gentleman is about half that of a journeyman tailor in our own countiy, the eyes begin to open, and the chdlest brain is able to understand why even the better-to-do people in the fatherland are forced to live as hard, and to inhabit hovels almost as comfortless, as our own Irish peasants. HoAvever, to return to our sheep, as the French say. WeU, AA'ith each of these singing-clubs there are still other expenses to be set doAvn. The custom prevads throughout Germany of holding \" choral feasts \" in some one or other of the principal towns, to which the several members of the other societies throughout the country are invited. The railway expenses of the journey are defrayed out of the general funds in con nection with each of the iirrited choirs, and every member attending the general singing feast is biUeted upon some person in the city where the gathering is held, and where he is boarded and lodged gratuitously."], [325, "AMUSEMENTS OF THE TIIURINGIANS. 303 The festivities at these yearly congresses of the several singing clubs generaUy last for six days, and during this time drinking and revelry are carried on to such an extent that one of the most prudent citizens in Eisenach informed us that, as a rule, not less than 14 thalers, or 27. 2*., were spent by each man av!io visited them. Once such a trip had cost him not less than 18 thalers (2/. 14*.), although he had been, he said, extremely sparing; and many he knew had laid out as much as 30 thalers, or 4/. 10i\\ in the course of the Aveek, so that he Avas certain that the siun Ave have named was a Arery moderate amount expended on such occasions.* * We have here enumerated only one such feast as occurring in the course of the year, so as to avoid excess in the above estimate. There are, however, usually two or more of these monstrous assemblies held at some distant towns ; and these the Eisenach members of the class convening the congress feel themselves more or less bound to take part in. This summer, for instance, there has been a great Tourner-fest at Leipzig, where some 20,000 gymnasts came together to tumble in public, the Eisenach Tourn-verein helping to swell the numbers. This cost the Eisenachers who attended it 10 \u2014 15 thalers, or from 30s. to 45s. each. Moreover, during the \" bird-shooting \" this autumn, there is to be a grand Kiinstler-fest (artists'-feast) up at the Wart burg, where a large temporary hall is now being erected, and which it is expected will bring some thousands of strangers to the town. On such occasions the festivities generally continue for three or four days, and often run over an entire week, the average expenses being at least 3 thalers, or 9s., a-day for each person ; though, to be on the safe side, we have excluded such extraordinary gatherings altogether from the foregoing calcula tion. The Germans, however, specially delight in such gigantic fooleries as 30,000 singers or 20,000 Tourners all performing at once. They love to walk in interminably long processions, with banners flying and a band of music (or even half a hundred"], [326, "304 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. There is but one other item to be added to the above, and then we have done. In the course of the season it is usual for a traveUing musician or conjuror, or puppet-show exhibitor, to visit the toAvn ; or else, perhaps, the director of the music at the church gets up a series of \" symphonic concerts,\" to Avhich the majority of the citizens are in the habit of purchasing tickets. But hardly one such entertainment in Eisenach ever pays its expenses ; the most profitable during our time was a performance given by a small troupe of hand-beU ringers from London, who, though they spoke the purest Cockney dialect, Avere advertised as Highlanders, and avIio made their appearance dressed up in kilts to the great delight of the German folk, the entertainment being as strange to them as the cos tume Avas noArel. These worthies dreAV crowded rooms for some two or three nights successively, AA'hereas we heard that the director of the sj-mphonic concerts lost drummers) clattering away at their head, after the manner of little boys playing at soldiers in the streets. Such senseless displays are happily limited in England nowadays to the \" demonstrations \" of the temperance children, called the \" Band of Hope,\" who are continually parading in pairs along the thoroughfares with flags and trumpets to tell the people they are going to drink a simple cup of tea together. In our own countiy such blatant monstrosities as thousands of singers, all roaring like a horde of prairie-bulls at once, are almost unknown beyond the naves of the not-particularly-classic Crystal-Palace Company ; where, once a-year, the united children of the charity schools of the British Metropolis are wont to be brought together in one vast miscellaneous muffin-cap multitude, to squeal the \" Old Hundredth \" as sonorously as if some milliads of hurdy-gurdies or barrel-organs were all grinding away at one and the same time ! ! !"], [327, "305 AMUSEMENTS OF THE THURINGIANS. some ten or twenty thalers by his speculation. The average price of admission to such entertainments ranges from sixpence to a shilling, the latter being considered an extremely high figure. Let us assume, therefore, that every grown male in the toAvn visits only one such entertainment in the year, and pays the loAvest price for his admission, viz. five groschens, and Ave must still add that amount to the total of a German's unnecessary expenses. But by the time Ave have come to the end of our account the reader has, doubtlessly, forgotten the be- ginning.

So far as our experience goes 300 \u2014 400 thalers, or 45/ \u2014 60/. a-year, appears to us to he about the usual income of the middle-class people in the Thuringian capital. Such amusements as those above-cited are indulged in only by the better-to-do middle class families, and Ave repeat that 45/. to 60/. the year is not only a fair sum at Avhich to set such income down, but many of our friends believed the usual amount of middle class earnings to be much lower than we have stated. At the corner of the Carls Platz, in Avhich we lived,"], [329, "AMUSEMENTS OF THE THURINGIANS. 307 was the shop osa Kaufmann, or chandler, doing more than an ordinary run of business ; and here Ave knew, for a fact, from the best authority, that the average takings throughout the year amounted to 1/. a-day. Assuming, then, the profit to be 25 per cent., the gross Aveekly gain of such a person Avould be 1/. 15s. ; for Sunday, at such a business, is the same as Aveek-days in Eisenach. But out of this AA'eekly sum a shop-boy had to be paid and fed, and lighting and rent pro vided, and this would cost at least 15*. a- week alto gether ; so that the clear gains of such a person could not be more than 1/., or say 7 dollars the week, which is at the rate of 364 thalers, or 54/. 12s. the year. True, some other of these chandler's-shopkeepers took more than the one aboA*e mentioned ; the receipts of one at the opposite corner of this same Carls Platz, we were informed, amounted to double as much daily ; while the takings of another man, Avho did the best retail business in the toAvn, Avere said to be but 4/. 10s. per diem. We have cited the first mentioned Kaufmann, however, as being a type of the general body of chandler's-shopkeepers through out the toAvn ; for though he took less than the feAv who had the best businesses, his receipts were more than many avIio had shops in the less-frequented parts of the toAvn. Further, it may be mentioned, that 300 thalers, or 45/. a-year, is the income of a lieutenant in the army, so that in estimating each of the citizens, the tradesmen, the professional men, Government officials and officers in the army, to have as much as 300 or 400 thalers coming in every year, avc are con- x 2"], [330, "308 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. vinced Ave are not very wide of the truth. How, then, stands the account ? On the one side we have an income of 45/. to 60/. the year, and on the other an outlay of not less than 24/. 10s. in wholly un necessary expenditure; the larger proportion being spent in drinking and gambling, Avhile the magnifi cent sum of from 20/. to 35/. is left for keeping house, for feeding and clothing not only the man himself, but the several members of his family. Now, reader, perhaps you AviU comprehend why so little meat can be afforded in each middle-class German family ; you AviU understand Iioav it is that but one pound among the whole is the usual allowance on the Sunday \u2014 potatoes, milk-soups, and barley-soups, and hard-boiled eggs, and Swede turnips being the general fare, even in gentlemen's families, on week days. You can uoav divine the reason why even the judges have hardly a shirt to their back, and many a person rejoicing in the long-winded title of Herr Appellations-Gericht Bath is obliged to resort to the dirty sham of \" dickeys.\" You Avdl iioav be able to see why it is that, though white bread is but two pence the pound, none but the rich can afford to eat it, and then only as cake \u2014 the ordinary staff of life in Germany being a disgusting mass of sour, black rye dough, baked till it is the colour of ginger-bread, and as heavy and toothsome as the compound schoolboys are in the habit of denominating \" stick-jaw.\" You Avill now too be able to conceive the cause why the rooms of gentlefolks should be as bare of every article of elegance or comfort as an ordinary English"], [331, "AMUSEMENTS OF THE THURINGIANS. 309 tap-room ; Avhy the ladies of the town should be seen bringing home tlieir bundles of straw from the market in order to furnish neAv beds for the family; and, in a Avord, AA'hy the people live at home like SAvine \u2014 simply because they indulge like swine when away from iheir families.

IN\" oav, ft AviU be seen from the little cabinet pictures of Saxon life before given, that the people of Thu ringia remain in about the same condition as were the Dutch boors at the time of the tAvo Teniers, and that the manners and customs of even theft nobles, their gentry, and their middle classes are not half as refined as those of our AveU-to-do artizans \u2014 the only class in England, indeed, to Avhich the better-to-do Saxons can be assimilated, being the day-labourers, earth-AVorkers, and naA'igators, who alone with us consent to take their food in the same hoggish Avay as the professional gentry, Government officials, and master tradesmen still delight to do in the Eesidenz Stadt of Eisenach. Nor is it possible to make Germans understand the difference between our country, and our life and theirs. Heinrich Heine, whom Ave had the good fortune to knoAV, was the only foreigner Ave ever met with who had the least sense of the difference ; and he told his countrymen, very truly, that English life was essentially an inner life, and not the same outside, shoAvy, tricky, vulgar thing as that abroad \u2014 made up of parading in the streets in fine clothes by day, and dancing in public ball-rooms, or drinking and smoking in taverns, by night, Avhile the family is left to \" rot and fust \" in a comparative stye at home. But on the contrary, he said, our life is a decent, comfortable, unpretentious, homely existence, Avhere everything is sacrificed to secure the happiness and the orderly and decent"], [334, "312 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. bringing-up of the household, rather than to sIioav parade and swagger out of doors. On the Con tinent, however, everything is the direct reverse of this ; theatrical outside display and tawdry ostentation being the rule on the one hand, and internal squalor and destitution the social laAv on the other. After residing for some couple of years on the banks of the Bhine, Ave took with us, on returning to our country, an honest Ehenish maid-servant, so that our children might have some one with whom they might continue their German ; and AA'hen the young ones stood no longer in need of such a nursery at tendant, we were lucky enough to be able to procure for the girl a situation with an English lady of title. Some few months after she had left us, she came to pay us a visit at the end of a long tour with her new mistress through the midland districts of Eng land, and she then told us that, until she had seen the English country villages \u2014 the English farm-houses, and, indeed, the English peasants' cottages, and the way in which our countiy people lived, she had no notion of the misery of the mass of her own country folk. And so it is : a German in Germany cannot possibly comprehend the squalor, indecency, and bar barism of even middle-class German life, for he has never seen or knoAvn anything better \u2014 poor wretch ! The German fare must be observed with English eyes \u2014 noted by those who have been accustomed to Eng lish comforts, to the cleanliness and tidiness of English houses, and to the decency and refinement of English"], [335, "313 FEEDING THE PIGS. feeding, as Avell as to the politeness of English manners \u25a0in order to be felt in all its full filthy force. The Thuringians, as a rule, eat no more meat than the cottiers of Ireland \u2014 potatoes, vegetable-soups, and dumplings, constituting the chief food for dinner and supper throughout the country. Nor must it be imagined that Ave refer here only to the habits of the poorer classes ; on the contrary, we repeat, what we have before stated, that the families of the middle class folk \u2014 such as tradesmen and master workmen, and, indeed, the wives and children of many of the professional people and Government officials \u2014 live as hard and as scantily as London needlewomen, and the worst-paid portion of journeymen tailors in the British metropolis ; and, Ave should add, neither are they so Avell housed, nor their rooms so decently or comfortably fitted. When we first came to the toAvn, it was a positive nine days' marvel among the citizens, as to the quantity of animal food consumed by our family in the course of the week ; and yet our fare was simple plain English living, Avithout even meat at breakfast or supper. At first it was difficult to understand the astonishment of our neAv neighbours ; we soon, Iioav ever, found that it was the custom even of the better to-do portion of the community to taste beef or mut ton only tAvice or thrice a Aveek (like our paupers and prisoners), and that many a Burgher ate it only on the Sundays ; and that, indeed, Avhenever animal food was partaken of, \"the joint\" consisted of a \"bit,\" not more than a pound in weight, which had"], [336, "314 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. to be duly distributed in pieces of an ounce or two each, among the several members of the family. Even a hare, when it is bought as a great treat, is expected to last the several members of the house hold for three days ! though hares cost each but a shilling of our money. Now, though one seldom sees the table arrange ments of a Saxon family \u2014 such things as dinner parties in the houses of the gentry being utterly unknown in the land \u2014 still, you hear from the different servants avIio come to Uve with you what are the habits of the people in tlieir private household arrangements ; and we know, from what Ave ourselves could not help seeing, that the milliners avIio lived be- Ioav us, and ranked as the best modistes in the place, had only a scrap of meat, no bigger than the palm of one's hand, on the Sunday, and that to satisfy four groAvn women and a servant ; Avhilst on the other side, the toAvn councillor, who lived over our head, AA'ith his wife, fared about as plainly and closely as does a journeymen carpenter, or Avorking turner on the other side of the Channel ; for the Eath and the Eathin Avere accustomed to take their din ners in the dingy dismal \" cooking-room,\" as it is called, in a style far less decent and tidy than is customary among the artizans and mechanics of England. Again, Ave had it from our own domestic, that the family of one of the principal officials in connection with the Government taxes, never ate any animal food, except once a week as a rule \u2014 the week day meals generaUy consisting of all kinds of barley-"], [337, "FEEDING THE PIG.. 315 broths and \" flour food,\" and vegetable soups, or may be of potato -dumpUngs and plums, or coffee and bread-and-butter ; AA'hile the morning repast was merely a dry roU of bread, and a cup of black coffee, Avithout any milk or sugar added to it. Further, it Avas AveU known throughout the toAvn, that the High Chamberlain of the Grand Duke Avas wont to have the mid-day repast for himself, wife, and family sent in from the \" Mohren Tavern \" (his lordship having no servant to dress the meal at home), and that this was made up of only two small French portions of solid food among five people. In fine, when Ave teU the polite reader that the salary of this same grand ducal functionary was but 60/. a-year, he wiU readily understand, not only that no servant could have been maintained out of it, but that no more plentiful fare coidd have been possible on such a pittance \u2014 seeing that the said high chamberlain received merely the wages of a gentleman's coachman in England. Still, it will be remembered that Ave have spoken of the Eisenachers' great love of pig-feeding ; and, there fore, it may be said, if it be true that these people, as a rule, consume more potatoes than beef and mutton, Avhat become of the fat swine that they one and all deUght to rear ? The capacious vat into Avhich every portion of pig meat is thrown, as soon as the animal is slaughtered, to be chopped into sausages, affords a sufficient solu tion of the mystery \u2014 especially when the process of family sausage-making has once been witnessed by the stranger. For the greater mass of the fat of"], [338, "316 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. the hog, when duly pared from the flesh, is boiled down into what is caUed Speck (the said \" speck \" being a dirty-coloured nasty imitation of our lard), and the entire offal hacked up with the pig-meat itself, and then dried into either liver-sausage, hard sausage, red sausage, SaA'oyard sausage, and Heaven knows Iioav many other sausages besides ! True it is, that on the day of the festival on which the pig is slaughtered (and this is a time of special rejoicing among the friends of the citizens at whose house the interesting ceremony occurs) strips of the narroAver layers of fat from the neck of the animal, together with the ears and snout, are boiled and served up Avith peppermint Schnapps, as great delicacies, under the name of \" Kessel-feish \" (pot-meat) for breakfast to those favoured acquaintances who are invited to parti cipate in the boorish banquet. But beyond such parings, hardly one bit of the meat itself ever makes its appearance as a joint of roast or boiled upon the citizens' tables. And no wonder : for the person who has once tasted and eAren looked at a dish of Saxon pork, and found the meat to be as different from English \" dairy fed,\" as is the complexion of a Circassian from that of a Malay, would never dream of trusting him self to sit down to the same dish a second time ; and, indeed, iioav that we have informed the reader as to Iioav the Eisenach sAvine are generally fed and housed (and there are details connected with the process, as weU as the situation of the styes, of which common decency prevents the mention), he Avillnot marvel Iioav flesh Avhich Avith us is, generaUy, as Avhite as chicken-"], [339, "FEEDING THE PIGS. 317 meat, should invariably, in a land where there is but little sense of either cleanliness or decency, be found almost as swarthy as that of hares ; or Iioav the hump of black, baked pig- meat, stripped of every particle of fat, is not a very tempting-looking, nor even a very toothsome dish, to persons of the least refinement. Such is the solution of the gastronomic riddle in Saxony : swine are fed \u2014 not for pork \u2014 but oidy for the production of the filthy fat called \" speck \" and for the supply of the infinite variety of sausages made and consumed in the land. Indeed, as AA*e in England term a young pig a \" porker,\" because it is the usual fate of the daintier class of those animals to be converted into that kind of food with us ; eA'en so do the Saxon folk call a hog in his hobby-de-hoy-hood a \" beautiful little sausage \" (schones Wurstchen) \u2014 such being the invariable des tiny of the animal in that countiy. But the mania for swine-feeding and swine-slaying is not the only passion among this Bucolic com munity \u2014 the pastoral citizens having the same love of cramming and cutting the throats of geese, as of pigs ; so much so, indeed, that there is hardly a wash-house throughout the city that is not devoted to the fattening of such birds at the fall of the year. At the house in which Ave lived the Hof was alive and a-fume with its farm yard appurtenances : at one time, the elegant land lady Avas there collecting the dung that reeked in a mound at one end of it ; at another, the fashionable milliners, who rented the little hole of a shop on the"], [340, "318 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS, ground-floor, were cut in the yard stuffing the sacks of straw, on which they slept, Avith the luxury of the new truss that they had just brought home with them from the market, At other times, again, we should find the wife of the town councillor, the noseless Frau AppeUations-Gericht-Eathin, bringing home a couple of live geese from the market, carry ing the birds by the pinions in either hand; and then the poor creatures would be cooped up in one corner of the joint-stock wash-house for the next month or so ; and we should hear them cackling aAvay, whenever any one went near the place, for the short allowance of grain, or meal, which the miserly old \" lady councillor \" thought fit to dispense to the wretched sentient creatures. Nor Avould the clatter cease, till her ladyship had decided, after the daily pinching of their breast-bones, and weigh ing of their bodies in her hand, that she could not afford to bestow another grain upon them; where upon we should, most probably, the next day, stumble over the elegant Eathin in the Hof Avith a knife in one hand, and the neck of the poor cackling bird in the other, engaged in instructing her decent little serving-maid in the sanguinary and highly lady-like art and mystery of goose- slaughter. For the first few months of our residence in the refined palatial capital of Thuringia, we were asto nished at the cannibal love of goose-flesh eA'inced by the community. Day after clay, and Aveek after Aveek, at Martinmastide, was this the fiwourite dish of the folk, so that every house reeked of its baked"], [341, "319 FEEDING THE PIGS. goose, either at dinner, or supper-time, till educated nostrils got to be nauseated with the not-particularly delicate odour ; for though the fumes ofthe dish may be savoury enough for once in a way, they are rather too strong not to pall after a time upon refined olfac tory nerves. Indeed, go into whatever Gasthaus you might, or even into any private establishment, you Avere sure to sniff' the hot fuming goose-fat at the above season of the year. In the same manner, then, as the pigs are kept for sausages, rather than pork, the geese are killed and eaten by the score at one particular time of the year, not because the citizens have suddenly acquired daintier notions than having a mass of potatoes thrown into the middle of the uncovered table for dinner or for supper ; but because the great mounds cf feather-beds which they sleep under (without either a blanket or a sheet besides to cover them) haA'e to be thought of; \u2014 especially as the feathers of the plucked bird itself would cost almost as much as the entire goose does before it is fattened. It avrs Avhile speaking upon this matter with a lady-resident of the town that she said, with a sigh, \" Oh ! I cannot tell you hoAV much baked goose we are obliged to eat just noAV, for there are the entire coA'erlets of our groAving young family to be made up ; \" Avhich is about the savae thing as if a farmer with us was to say that he and his household must live on mutton for the next month, because his sons wanted a new coat or two to their backs. For though the poor geese in this boorish land are plucked alive twice before being"], [342, "320 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. brought to market, they are ultimately killed and devoured mainly for their third crop of goose-doAvn ; so that no sooner does the Martinmas-feast set in than you find even the Colonel's wife, and the Lord Cham berlain's Avife, and the Grafin This, and the Frau von That, coming back from the market, each with her live goose dangling in her hand ; and you xvill see the elegant dames, a week or two afterwards, seated in the kitchen, beside the maid-servant, AA'ith their head tied up in a cloth, and their dress and face as fluffy as if they had been newly tarred and feathered, engaged in the Arcadian occupation of stripping the dead goose of its highly-prized covering. We Avill however, now proceed to cite a few extracts from a class of books, Avhich are often as good guides even as Murray, to the curiosities of the land in whieh Ave live, A'iz. the cookery-books of the country. In the loAvest form of animal life, the sentient creature is a mere stomach; and the highest form of animal organism very often remains at that point also. More over, cannibahsm, which is regarded as the most savage type of human existence, is mainly a gastro nomic test as to the refinement of the country in which it prevails ; and the Samoiedes are merely judged by ethnologists to be but a feAv degrees above the carnivora, not only from the inordinate capacities of tlieir stomachs, but from the shocking coarseness of their food. Hence the modes of eating and drinking \u2014 the things on which the people of a country feed, as Avell as the manner of their feeding,"], [343, "FEEDING TIIE PIGS. 321 appear to us to be fair enough criteria as to the delicacy and refinement of the race. And Ave shall, therefore, proceed to apply such a standard to the tastes of the Saxon gentry, by making a feAv extracts concerning the favourite dishes of the people, from the principal Saxon cookery-book ; and then leave it to the English reader to decide as to Iioav he Avould like to pass a couple of years upon such fare, or as to how highly he would think of the folk aa*1io Avere continuaUy regaUng themselves with it. The work from Avhich Ave quote is entitled the \" Braktisehes Kochbuch\" (Practical Cookery-book), for \" ordinary and superior kitchens,\" by Henrietta DaA'idis, and published only some half-dozen years ago. It holds, indeed, about the same rank in Saxon- Germany as the Avorks of Airs. Glass and Mrs. Bundall do Avith us, being merely a system of domestic cook ery, intended more especially for the households of Avell-to-do middle-class families. First, under the head of soups, Ave have the follow ing peculiar, and not very nice-sounding receipts : \u2014 Beer soup, made with beer, eggs, and sugar, which are to be all beaten up together, and then boiled for dinner, Avhile the more luxurious are advised to haA*e a feAV raisins, or some milk mixed with it to make it more palatable \u2014 or nasty, we should say. Then A\\re haA'e a soup made from AA'hat boys caU \" hips and haws,\" or the berries of the dog-rose groAving in the hedges, the rind of which is to be boiled in Avater Avith bits of bread, tiU the latter acquire the consist ence of a poultice, Avhen it is to be rubbed through VOL. i. Y"], [344, "322 GERAIAN LIFE AND MANNERS. a sieve, and some sugar, nutmeg, &c, to be added to it; after which, says the book, \"it avUI be found very soothing to the sick and suffering\" \u2014 though Ave should fancy rather as an external than internal application. The same work supplies us with a recipe for \"green-corn soup,\" the unripe grain having first to be boiled into a squash, and then forced through a sieA'e, as per last, till it assumes the appearance of the skimmings of a duck-pond ; when, to make it extra good, a few lumps of Avhite bread and boiled onions are to be mixed with it. Another A'ery choice soup, Ave are informed, may be made from cows' udder! but for the proper preparation of this elegant dish, it is necessary that the \" milk bag \" should be first boded in several Avaters ; and when the boilings have been rejected, and it has become tender and white, the sack is to be cut into small strips, and cooked in butter and flour, untd it is of a fine yelloAV ; after Avhich the epicure can add a little parsley and nutmeg (a nice gastronomic mixture !), and AA'hen the entire mess has been served up in a little weak veal broth, we are as sured that the \"smack\" of it AviU be found to be most delicate, for persons of diseased stomachs. After this comes a mess of soups made from \" green meat,\" such as Avould create a revolution in a poor house, if ever they Avere to be served out to the London paupers \u2014 some of them being soup made out of the icaler in which cabbages have been boiled \u2014 the said green-w*ater being merely thickened with potato flour, and lubricated with lard, while into the"], [345, "FEEDING THE PIGS. 323 resulting toothsome mash, bits of black bread are to be thrown. Other such soups, are to be concocted in a similar Avay from the wafer that has been used fo cook potato dumplings, and this is to be flavoured and treated after the same refined fashion. Then we have milk soups \u2014 and remember, reader, these are not dishes recommended for the breakfast of children, but the delicacies which are to constitute the solid dinners of grown-up men and women ; and avc ourselves knew not one or two, but many of the gentry and trades-folk in Eisenach, whose mid-day meal consisted of nothing else than this same baby pap. These milk soups the Saxon gentry are advised to make up with oats, or indeed such grain as the horses and cattle are fattened upon in England ; Avhile under the same head Ave are favoured Avith the manner of compounding \" butter-milk soup with buck-wheat grain,\" or if this cannot tickle the palate of the enlightened Saxon, he can try the same soup made with oats and dried berries, or else Avith plums and raisins. After this come the fruit soups, and Ave know, in our experience while resident in the Eisenach palatial toAvn, of a smaU revolution Avhich occurred in the household of a family (the mother of whom, an Irish woman by birth, had married with a decently-to-do Hamburg merchant), when the boys, avIio had been accustomed to something like solid EngUsh fare, Avere asked to make theft mid-day meal off cherry-soup and potato dumplings, instead of the substantial viands which had been their usual food. Under this head of fruit soups, by Avay of a substitute for Y 2"], [346, "324 GER.AIAN LIFE AND MANNERS. dinner, Ave have receipts Iioav to compound the strengthening luxuries of \"apple-soup flavoured with aniseed \" or of \"prune soup thickened with oatmeal.\" Noav, Avhen Ave tell the reader once more, that these same soups, whether they be \" beer-soups,\" or \" green meat soups,\" or \" meal-soups,\" or \" fruit-soups,\" or \" butter-milk soups,\" constitute the main mid-day diet, not alone of the working class of Saxony, but of many of the gentry, the tradesmen, and the master handi craftsmen who live upon them clay after clay, knowing but the taste of meat on the Sabbath, he will readily understand the hard life, and the hard times, that the struggling people there must have to endure. It is a faith with us, that the Government of every country is responsible, not alone for the enlighten ment of the people, but for the general welfare of the community ; and though we have no belief in the Utopian creed of the visionary but weU-meaning Lamartine, (the pretty sentimental French poet) or of Louis Blanc (the generous and fiery-spirited socialist,) that the rulers of a nation should turn master-shoe akers , or master-tailors, or master-carpenters, or mas ter whatever-you-please, in order to provide work for the labouring classes, nevertheless we do in our heart believe that the misery and the want of every nation is due more or less to the social ignorance, or the petty despotic greed, of those who have been set in authority over it. In Heaven's name, why should we, who are now writing in a country that claims kindred Avith our"], [347, "325 FEEDING THE PIGS. oavii, and Avhose ancestors every Avise Englishman believes to haA'e been the back-bone of the nation to which he belongs, live to find the very race with Which our countrymen are proud to claim relationship, in such a state of squalor and destitution as has been feebly painted in these pages ? Of the grandeur and the freedom of the old Saxon race, of the enlighten ment, dignity, and justice of the old Saxon laws, no one Avho has glanced over the pages of Sharon Turner, or Alfred Kemble, can have the least doubt ; and yet the English resident in modern Saxony cannot help Avondering how it is that the very same Saxon element, from Avhich Englishmen date aU their manly poAver, and a large amount of their freedom, can be so sunk in comparative barbarism and boorish ness, that there is hardly a man among them iioav-a days who has a sense of the indignity of his felloAvs, or even an aspiration to struggle out of the mire and serfdom in which he and his countrymen are wallow- ing. Granted that the Norman race has bequeathed to us some of the finest aristocracy in the world ; but Avas Newton, Avas Shakespeare, Avas Milton, Avas Watt, Avas Arkwright, was Bacon, Avas Locke, of Norman extrac tion? Their very names are sufficient to assure an etymologist that they could never have sprung from any other than a Saxon type ; and consequently, the maiwel becomes AA-hy should there be no semblance, no trace of the glories and greatness of the old Saxon race in the benighted land of Saxony at the present time."], [348, "326 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Well, such messes as those before-given, we repeat, constitute the chief, if not the only dishes partaken of at dinner\u2014 for, certainly, three days in the week, \u2014 by the majority of respectable families. Occasion aUy, hoAveA-er, another dish, besides the soup, may be added, and this may consist, according to the taste of the parties, either of a dried herring, eaten un cooked, or of a salted one, \" marinirte,\" as it is called ; that is to say, done up in a raAv state with cream, apples, capers, and onions ; and as this constitutes a favourite dish for breakfast, dinner, or supper, we annex the mode of preparing it \u2014 not because we believe the receipt aa-UI be found acceptable to any English palate, but in order to let persons of the least refinement see Iioav coarsely the Thuringian folk arc in the habit of feeding. We quote from the work of Henrietta DaAudis, as before. To prepare a marinirte herring. \u2014 The herring is to be taken out of the brine in Avhich it has been pickled, and then soaked in milk from twelve to twenty-four hours. After A\\*hich time the entrails are to be removed, and the raw fish cut up into strips, and the pieces laid in an earthen pot with layers of shalots, or small onions, capers, cloA*es, pepper-corns, lemon-peel, and a feAv bay leaves \u2014 some add slices of apples. In this state vinegar is to be poured 0A*er the whole. Then the raAv soft roc of the herring is to be rubbed through a sieve, and beaten up -with salad oil or cream into a thick sauce, when it is to be poured upon the pieces of the lish, onions, capers, apples, &c., and afterwards 'the AA'hole turned"], [349, "FEEDING THE PIGS. 327 out into a dish for table and to be eaten in its raAv state. A special chapter of the Saxon cookery-book is deA'oted to what is called \"potato food\" (Kartoffel speisen), and it forms by no means an insignificant portion of the volume ; for the \" earth apples,\" which honest out-speaking old Billy Cobbett used to call the \"accursed root\" (because it had contributed so much to the degradation of the labouring population of Europe), constitute the principal fare of the Saxons, even as they do of the poorer Irish to the present day. In some families, potatoes and salt are eaten for break fast, dinner, and supper, almost every day of the week ; and we have before told Iioav, on our first visit to the burgomaster of Mohra, we found his worship, the mayoress, and family feasting OArer a mound of steaming potatoes, that had been roUed out on the bare breakfast table, and which they were, one and aU, busily engaged in peeling and devouring Avith their fingers. Nor is it at all uncommon, at the present day, to find entire books advertised in the Ger man papers, as being devoted to the all-important subject of the \" Potato Kitchen,\" or, in other words, the thousand-and-one ways of cooking that vegetable. In the work of Henrietta Davidis receipts are given for compounding the foUowing unsavoury-sounding dishes out of potatoes. For example, potatoes and herrings ; sour potatoes ; potatoes Avith apples ; po tatoes with pears ; potatoes Avith dried pears ; potatoes with ripe plums ; potatoes Avith dried plums, &c, &c."], [350, "328 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. As a specimen of the kind of messes that the above mentioned dishes are likely to consist of, we will again favour the reader with the mode of compound ing one of the most favourite. To prepare potatoes with ripe plums. \u2014 One cooks some potatoes, says the book, in a little butter or fat, and a pinch or two of salt, until they are done. Then one adds as many well-washed plums as there are potatoes, so that the latter shall acquire, what the lady terms, an agreeable sour flavour (dass die Kar toffeln eine angcnehme Sciure erhaltcn). Let the whole cook until soft, and then stir the potatoes well up Avith the plums. Next comes a scanty list of \"warm and cold puddings,\" which are to be made of greis - meal, (literally, Embden-groats), rice-meal, potato-meal, black bread, or starch, and each to be eaten with a sauce of mashed fruit ; and concluding with the following elegant compound. To make a rich pudding of craw-fish. \u2014 One and a half pounds of stale white bread, three-quarters of a pint of milk, three ounces of the soft part from the heads of some crawfish, ten fresh eggs, four ounces of powdered sugar, half an ounce of bitter macaroons, or the rind of a lemon, seA*en ounces of finely-chopped kidney-fat, and the tails of as many fish as possible cut into small pieces, are to be mixed in the following manner : The crust is to be cut off the white bread, and the crumb soaked in the milk ; then the soit part of the head of the fish is to be rubbed till smooth, aster which the yolks of the eggs are to be"], [351, "FEEDING THE TIGS. 329 gradually added; and AA'hen this is finished, the sugar, the macaroons, and the kidney-fat, and the chopped pieces of the tails, are to be stirred up with the above. Lastly, the whites of the eggs are to be beaten to a thick froth, and poured OA'er the Avhole, and the pudding is to be baked two-and-a-half horns. When cooked, it is to be served Avith a sauce, made up of the soft part of the craAv-fish, with cream or milk, and yolk of egg \u2014 all boiled together ! ! ! Before quitting this part of the subject, hoAveArer, Ave should, agaft, impress upon the reader that even such simple delicacies as potato-meal, Embden-groats, and starch-puddings are seldom or neA'er partaken of after a substantial dinner, but that they, in most cases, constitute the entire mid-day fare ; it being the rule, we repeat, with the commoner Eisenach citizens to eat meat (with the exception of a bit of sausage, maybe, for supper during the Aveek) only on the Sunday. But a feAv clays ago our son was invited to stay to dinner Avith a middle-class family, when the entire fare consisted of pancakes as thick as buckskin, accompanied with a sauce of wild bilberries. Many of the shopkeepers, moreover, Ave kneAV often partook merely of unsAveetened black coffee and sweetened Avhite bread for their dinner ; Avhile the female mem bers of our family, when pressed to stop and dine with the wife and daughters of one of the principal Govern ment officers of the town, haA'e found the repast to consist merely of prune-soup and potato- dumplings ; and on other occasions of AAdiite-bread pudding and mashed plums."], [352, "330 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. But, to let English folk see what is the usual fare of the burghers in the capital of Thuringia, Ave have thought it better to obtain from one of them a definite statement as to what the dinners of an ordinary middle class family have consisted of for the last seven days. The person aa*1io supplied us Avith such particulars Avas one of the principal master-bakers doing as good a business as any in the town ; and Ave are satisfied, from our own obseiwations, that the week's bill of fare below-given is a fair sample of the character of the mid-day meals generally partaken of by the Eisenach middle-classes ; such as master-tradesmen, chandlers shopkeepers, schoolmasters, and Government officials. Sunday. Three-quarters of a pound of hacked meat, baked Avith plenty of stuffing \u2014 among eight people ! \u2014 Avith cherry-cake, made out of black bread, to follow. Monday. Boded French beans, thickened with fat and flour. Tuesday. The remains of the beans and fat re warmed. Wednesday. \" Dumpling soup,\" i. e. with shreds of a stiff paste boiled in it. Thursday.

DRINKING CUSTOMS AMONG THE MODERN SAXONS. Foraierly the estimate as to the proportion which the rent should bear to the gross income of a well-to do Englishman was that, to be decently housed, it should constitute one-tenth part of the entire earnings. Many belieA*e now-a-days that owing to the general desire which exists among our countrymen for superior house accommodation, the ratio has con siderably increased, and that at present it reaches as high as an eighth, or a sixth of the yearly profits \u2014 people Avith 500/. per annum mostly renting houses from 70/. to 80/. the year. In the Thuringian capital it is difficult to calculate what part of the earnings of the people are deAroted to the matter of rent ; but, from a calculation we instituted, it would appear that, in most cases, it does not form one-fifteenth part of the entire income. Post-office \" secretaries \" or clerks, getting about 300 thalers per annum, usually pay 24 thalers a-year, or 6s. a-month, for their lodgings \u2014 and this is rather less than one-twelfth part of the income. Government clerks, again, avIio receive 12 thalers a month, generally pay 1 thaler for theft"], [356, "334 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. sleeping-room. Among the wealthier classes, how- ever, it is customary for each person, avIio has the means to do so, to purchase the freehold of the house in which he lives, and to let out eA'ery floor of it but the one he himself selects to occupy \u2014 the tenants of such floors, of course, paying more in proportion for their lodgings than the wealthier part of the com- o __) JL munity : even as a clerk with us, avIio earns but a pound or thirty shillings a-week, is generally com- pelled, if married, to gh-'e up a fourth, and sometimes as much as a third, of his gains for the rooms or the little house which he occupies in the suburbs. An artizan again, in England, Avho receives 36.*. Avages every Aveek, mostly stands at about 5s. Aveekly for rent ; so that it Avould appear, from the comparisons Ave have instituted between the different classes of the two countries, that the proportion which an Englishman expends for housing is considerably greater than in Germany. Indeed, it is but natural that it should be so, seeing that Germans care less about haAnng a decent home over tlieir head than \" proud Britons \" (as the Saxons call us) are prone to do. Bent, of course, is less expensive here than in our oavii country. We, for a first-floor, consisting of eleA'en rooms, in one of the largest houses in the town, pay 22/. the year unfurnished, and at the early part of our resi dence in Eisenach Ave gave for a large furnished villa 58/. per annum. But then the Saxon people earning less, must naturally have less to pay, so that Ave can only be guided by the proportionate part of the"], [357, "DRINKING CUSTOMS AMONG THE SAXONS. 335 income set aside for such matters by the people of different countries. The usual price given for a furnished bed-chamber and small sitting-room in Eisenach is about 6s. the month, and about Ss. a month unfurnished ; Avhile the A'alue of large houses in the principal streets, AA'hen sold, ranges from 5000 to 10,000 thalers (750/.-1500/.) House property how ever, is neA*er expected to return more than five per cent, interest on the capital, so that the entire rent of such domiciles, if they could be hired, Avould be from 37/. 10s. to 75/. per annum. The Eisenach houses at best are but large, ill arranged homesteads, built of a net-work of timbers, Avith the interstices filled up either Avith mud and Avicker-Avork, or else Avith unbaked mud-bricks, and the Avails, inside and out, rudely plastered over. In deed, this is the approved mode of building through out the toAvn, for there were but .avo brick edifices \u2014 and they were neAv pubUc institutions \u2014 in the entire toAA'ii; the Grand Duke's palace itself being nothing more than the same elegant \" wattle-and dab \" order of structure. Thus much for the matter of rent ; and iioav to estimate the cost of the drinking expenses of the same people. So far as our experience goes, the proportion that an English artizan, of decent tem perate habits, devotes to such matters, ranges from an eighth to a sixth part of his entire weekly wages ; that is to say, a good workman- earning, on an average 30s. a-Aveek, spends betAveen Ss. 6d. and 5s. upon porter and tobacco in the course of the seven days."], [358, "336 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. We have purposely fixed the amount, here given, at a higher figure than is common among the more respect able artizans of the British metropolis ; judging, hoAveA-er, from the account-books of tlieir household expenses furnished us by the better-to-do of the London workmen Avhile we were prosecuting our in quiries among the poor of the British capital some years ago, we are satisfied that 3s. 6c/. a week would Avell cover the weekly drinking expenses of the more decent portion of our labouring population. But then it is unfair to draw an average from this same more decent section of the class ; so that, all things considered, avc believe that the estimate we haA'e given of from 3s. 6d. to 5s. Avell represents the cost of the Aveekly sum spent in public-houses by the generality of the better-~paiS. workmen of England. It should be borne in mind, then, that the average drinking expenses of the hard-working portion of our nation vary, as a rule, from between an eighth to a sixth part of the entire weekly gains ; and Ave believe that the same calculation Avould hold good even among the commonest earth-Avorkors throughout the country ; for Is. in every 6s. is, so far as our ex perience goes, an extreme amount of money for a working man to expend in beer, and Is. in every 12s. a very moderate sum to be expended upon the same luxury. Of course the exceptional hard-drinkers and reckless sots, avIio prevail in every land, are excluded from the calculation. We are here speaking only of the general practice ; and when it is remembered that out of the sum left, after paying for beer, rent has to"], [359, "DRINKING CUSTOMS AMONG TIIE SAXONS. 337 be discharged, and food and clothing procured \u2014 not only for the man himself, but in most cases for his Avife and family \u2014 it AviU be understood, that, as a general rule, it Avould be impossible for a mechanic to devote more than a sixth of his income to drink, and still maintain the decent home, which those avIio knoAV the workmen as Avell as Ave do, will be ready to acknoAvledge is their general custom. Now, let us look at the other side of the picture. Let us see, on the other hand, Iioav much the Ger mans, on an average, consume out of their yearly incomes in the matter of beer alone. We remem ber talking with an English clergyman who was lamenting the dissipation and degradation of the poorer classes in the district in which it Avas his duty to minister, because he had discovered that there Avas one pubhc-house to every five hundred souls in his parish. Let this ratio, then, be taken as the standard of extreme intemperance throughout the worst parts of our oavii country ; and with such test firmly fixed in the mind, let us proceed to note Iioav the same matter stands in Saxony. Well, the Thuringian capital is by no means re markable in Germany for the hard-drinking habits of its citizens. As a German town, it may be fairly taken as an aA'erage of all others in this respect ; a drunken man is seldom or never seen in the streets, and the public-houses are bound to close \u2014 though few of them do so, by the bye\u2014 at 11 o'clock on every night of the week. This town has a population of not quite 14,000 souls, and for the supply of beer, &c, vol. i. z"], [360, "338 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. to the entire community there are no less than forty taverns within the city bounds, and some half-dozen more situate in the immediate neighbourhood of it \u2014 the landlords of the latter also deriving their profits chiefly from the citizens of Eisenach. How ever, rejecting the suburban \" beer gardens\" from the calculation, Ave find that forty taverns to 14,000 inhabitants is in the proportion of one such hostelry to every 350 souls of the population, which shows a state of things very nearly 50 per cent. Avorse than in the worst parts of our oavii countiy. Still, it may be urged that the number of beer houses after aU afford but a slight criterion as to the quantity of beer consumed by the community, since one large tavern may draw double the amount of beer compared Avith ten smaU ones ; and in order to come at the truth of the matter, we consulted a gentleman in connection with one of the chief breweries of the city, so as to learn from, him exactly the quantity of beer which Avas consumed within the town in the course of the twelvemonth. The facts furnished to us on this occasion were as foUoAvs : \u2014 In the course of each year there are usuaUy 7000 Eimern, of about twenty gallons each (or 140,000 gaUons of beer in aU), brewed at the Eock brewery ; and 4000 such Eimern, or S0,000 gallons, produced at the \" Palace brewery.\" Of these, 500 Eimern are exported, making altogether a total of 10,500 Eimern consumed in Eisenach. Over and above this, there are 12,000 more casks of beer (each of tAventy gaUons capacity) imported into the toAvn ; and thus we have"], [361, "DRINKING CUSTOMS AMONG THE SAXONS. 339 a gross total of 22,500 such Eimern, or 450,000 gallons of beer drunk by the little community of Eisenach in the course of the twelvemonth. This amount divided by the 14,000 inhabitants, gives very nearly thirty-two and a (quarter gallons as the quantity of beer consumed by every man, woman, and child in the toAvn in the course of the twelvemonth. Then excluding one-half of the entire population as females, and half again of the remainder as being too old or too young to attend the beer-houses nightly, Ave haA'e a groAvn population of 3500 individuals, each of Avhom must consume 129 gallons of beer throughout the year, or not quite tAvo and a half gaUons a-Aveek ! This estimate, of course, is for the entire grown male population. The working classes of the countiy, hoAvever, are too badly paid to be able to afford even the luxury of a penny glass of beer after their day's labour. The usual liquor consumed by labouring men during their Avork is Schnapps \u2014 potato spirit ; and of this the custom is for each man to drink a quarter of a pint during the day, the pint costing not quite fourpence of our money. Hoav much may be taken after the hours of labour we are not in a position to state. If, then, Ave exclude from the entire 3500 persons, constituting the able-bodied male population of Eisenach, one-half of the number as appertaining to the working classes (and in the generality of com munities the proletarian tribe amount to not less than three-fourths of the groAvn male population) as being too poor to afford to drink beer in large quantities, we shaft find that each weh-to-do member of the z 2"], [362, "340 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Thuringian capital consumes hardly less than five gallons of malt liquor weekly \u2014 or nearly six pints every clay throughout the }rear ! Now, to prove that this is no exaggerated statement, it may be mentioned that Ave ourselves kneAV a young German student at the Gymnasium, who, though not twenty years old, could drink his twenty pint-glasses of malt liquor at one sitting ; and the gentleman who supplied us Avith the aboA*e information told us that he was acquainted Avith seA'eral persons in the town who were in the habit of drinking on \" highdays and holidays\" not less than twenty-four double glasses of beer, or as much as six gallons in the course of one day ! Moreover, one of our friends, Avho was a clerk in the Post Office, assured us that he himself had consumed thirty-two pint-glasses (which are equal to four gallons English) during one holiday. But iioav comes the rub. Who haA'e to suffer for all this frightful indulgence ? and Iioav can the people of a countiy, where the earnings even of gentry and officers are not equal to the wages of clever handicraftsmen with us, afford to waste so large a portion of the in come which should be deA'oted to the maintenance of the house, in the swinish revelry of tavern society ? Let us first endeavour to give the reader an idea of the entire sum of money devoted by the little beggarly town of Eisenach to this most expensive habit. The gentleman to whom Ave are indebted for the above facts, told us it would be perfectly fair to estimate the price of each pint-glass of beer sold in the town (taking the cost of that which is imported with that which"], [363, "DRINKING CUSTOMS AMONG TIIE SAXONS. 341 is brewed in the city) at one penny farthing English the pint ; for, though the town-breAved beer is sold at a penny the pint, that brought in, from outside the gates is more expensive ; and moreover the land lords knoAV Avell how, by foaming the cheaper com modity Avell up at the top of the glass, to get more than four pints out of the ordinary half-gallon can. Noav, at a penny farthing the pint-glass, the gallon of beer must cost lOd. and 450,000 gallons at this price Avould require no less a sum than 18,750/. to meet the expense of it. This has to be shared among the 3500 people constituting the entire able-bodied population of the town, and thus shows an expen diture of 5/. 7s. and some odd pence by each in dividual, for the mere matter of beer alone, during the year. Or if Ave reject one-half of the able-bodied people as being too poor to frequent the beer-houses of an evening, and as drinking Schnapps as a less ex pensive article than malt liquor, Ave have the sum of 10/. 14s. as the yearly outlay for beer among the heads of the Avell-to-do families in the city of Eisenach ; and this is at the rate of a fraction more than 4s. a-Aveek, devoted to this one form of in dulgence. Even among the well-paid artizans of England, such an average Avaste of money in the matter of beer alone would be considered, by all weU-wishers to tlieir country, as a vice which demanded the greatest energies of the foremost people to check. In Eisenach, however, Avhere the salary of the deputy mayor and the pay of a captain in the army are less"], [364, "342 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. than the wages of an English journeyman tailor in good work, such extravagance causes no considera tion, and no thought as to what must be the condition of the houses even of the better class of the commu nity, Avhere so much is given out to the innkeeper, and so little remains for the support of the Avife and children out of the petty yearly earnings. To comprehend this part of the social problem English people should first have some sense as to what are really the annual gains of the official and professional people in Eisenach. We have before said that the Lord Chamberlain of the Grand Duke re ceives but 60/. a-year for his services, the family living in an attic, and the Lady Chamberlain, OAving to their inability to keep a servant, being forced to scrub the floors of the rooms his Lordship inhabits. And yet, even this hog of a functionary, despite the squalor of his wretched wife and daughters, was in the habit of spending so much money at the taA'erns, that, night aster night, he was either hooted by the boys of the city, as he staggered back intoxicated to his bed ; or else he wras carried home insensible by some friendly citizen to the bosom of his half-starved famdy. And the story ran, in the town, that when his \"lordship\" returned home chunk, he would insist upon his daughters bowing him backwards to his bed, with a lighted candle in their hand, and styling him \" his Excellency ! \" Nor wiU it be readily believed that the fee for the first physicians of the toAvn, if consulted at their oavii houses, is but tlneepence English, and that if they visit any patient"], [365, "343 DRINKING CUSTOMS AMONG THE SAXONS. in the city they are entitled to receive the liberal re- Avard of sixpence \u2014 a journey into the countiy being paid with the handsome sum of three sldlhngs per hour ; and, moreover, that an attorney gets but 2d. for writing a letter for his clients, and Is. for a con- sultation. But it is better to let the official documents of the town itself speak as to the highest salaries given to the GoA'ernment officers. Every year a printed list of the expenses of the city is sent round to the different inhabitants of Eisenach ; and Ave, as Schufz-burger, were in the habit of receiAdng one of these. It is from such an official document that the foUowing statements, as to the salaries given to the chief toAvn-officers, are taken. Per Annum. \u00a3 .. d.

Ils. per annum ; or a fraction more than 9s. each per week. Now, it AviU be seen by the above accounts that the highest salary paid to any of the city functionaries is that given to the mayor, who receives altogether (in consideration of his acting in the capacity of chief magistrate likewise) 150/.; and for this handsome income it should be added, that his worship is ex- pected to belong to no business. Indeed the present burgomaster had to give up the little chandler's shop he kept in Weimar, on being elected for life to the"], [367, "345 DRINKING CUSTOMS AMONG THE SAXONS. office. We should state, moreover, that the \" Third Burgomaster\" receives only (with perquisites) 45/. the year, or not quite 17s. the week, with free lodging for his seiwices ; the said Official's income being, con sequently, less than that of an English gentleman's coachman, Avho has ahvays his rooms \u2014 and rooms Avhich might weU compare with the chambers as signed to the Herr Baths-Assessor into the bargain. Nor wdl it hardly be credited that the Eresident of the Assizes, avIio in this little community is as impor tant an officer as the Lord Chief Justice Avith us, receives not so much as the wages of a working engineer in London, or but 2/ lO.s. Aveekly ! We must come to the conclusion, therefore, that the average earnings of even the p/rofessional classes in the Thuringian capital are not eAren those of earth-labourers in London ; for it wiU be seen by the above statement that the Avhole of the toAvn functionaries taken in a lump, including many of the highest, and but few of the lowest, receive only a fraction more than 9s. each eA'ery week throughout the year ; Avhilst the commonest unskiUed labourer in the British metropolis is Avorth, at least, his 2s. 6d. the day \u2014 the farm servants eAren, in most of the agricultural districts, Avith us getting more, upon an average, than even the city authorities do, on an average, in Eisenach. The object of the above statistics is to give the English public something like a notion, be it re membered, as to the aA'erage gains of the heads of families among the Saxon community; and Ave AviU"], [368, "346 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. iioav proceed to lay before the reader a statement of the wages generally paid to the labouring population of the same nation. A working engineer, who ranks in eA'ery countiy as among the highest of skiUed labourers, is in the habit of being paid three dollars, or 9s. a-week, and out of this he has to keep himself and famdy. With us the usual wages for such handicraftsmen are as many pounds the week as doUars are given to the Saxon mechanic. A good carpenter, in Eisenach, gets Is. 6d. a-day, and an ordinary one a penny less \u2014 and both without board or lodaftior. In the generality of trades, hoAvever, the custom prevails of housing and feeding the workmen, rather than giAdng them wages sufficient to find themselves. A working cabinet-maker receives Ss. a-week for his __) labour, provided he Uves in the house of the master ; but if no such accommodation can be afforded him, he is paid 7s. 6d. a Aveek \u2014 the keep of a workman in almost aU trades being estimated at 4s. 6d. weekly. The London working cabinet-makers get, in \" good shops,\" as much as 11. 16s. weekly Avages ; and Ave are here speaking only of the sums paid to journey men by the best Eisenach tradesmen. A mason receives the same price as a cabinet-maker; a jour neyman tailor, on the other hand, has only 2*. 6d. a-Aveek Avages, to which 4s. 6d. are added if he lives out of the house \u2014 the wages of a good jour neyman tailor in London, hoAvever, are 6d. an hour, or 36s. weekly. A working blacksmith, who is always kept by his master, receives 2s. 6d. a-Aveek like the"], [369, "DRINKING CUSTOMS AMONG THE SAXONS. 347 tailor, and the hours of labour are expected to range from four in the morning till seven at night. A jour neyman tinman, on the other hand, gets Ss. a-week Avith his board and lodging, which, as Ave said before, may be estimated at 4s. 6d. extra. Such, then, are the usual weekly incomes of the skilled workmen of Eisenach ; the rate of pay ranging from 9s. given as wages to the highest handicrafts man, down to 7*. paid to the lowest. With unskilled labourers, however, the rate of pay is but a shade less, since an earth-Avorker generaUy receives (Avhen well paid) Is. a-day, or 6s. a-week, out of which he has to supply aU the necessaries of himself and family. As regards servants' wages, 2/. 14s. the year is considered extremely high pay ; the average sum being but 1/. 16s. And the remuneration to the Avomen attendants aaIio live at their own homes, and come in the course of the day to \" clean up \" and tidy the rooms (like the laundresses at the chambers in the Inns of Court), receive 2s. a-month, out of Avhich they are expected to find themselves Avith food, clothing, and lodging. Further, a washerwoman, avIio is expected to be at her work at three o'clock in the morning in summer, and to stay until the entire Avash is finished \u2014 wdiich. generally occupies her until seven or eight at night \u2014 gets but 6./. for her sixteen hours' labour, besides her keep during the time \u2014 such keep usually consisting of a cup of burnt-carrot- (or bean-) coffee, Avithout milk or sugar, and a farthing roll the first thing in the morning ; a slice of black bread and fat, and a glass of Schnapps, at ten;"], [370, "348 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. at noon, a plateful of beer-soup and bread; at three, another cup of sugarless and milkless coffee, and another farthing roll ; and, lastly, for the poor creature's supper, a bit of black bread and about two ounces of liver sausage, and another glass of Schnapps \u2014 the total allowance of black bread usual on such occasions being two pounds throughout the day. Noav, from this plain unvarnished tale, as to the ordinary earnings of the best paid and the worst paid people of the town in Avhich Ave have been resident the last three years, the unprejudiced reader AviU readdy bear us out that in fixing the aA'erage earnings of the entire community at two-and-a-half dollars, or 7s. 6d. a-Aveek, Ave are rather over-stating than undervaluing the general incomes of the heads of families through out the toAvn ; and to be assured of this, the reader must remember that Ave haA'e before shown that the whole of the town officials, taken one Avith the other (mayors, professors, judges, registrars, servants, &c), get but little more than 9s. a-week. What the trades men are in the habit of making, it is, of course, difficult to say, but when A\\*e add that the principal merchants Avere chandler's-shopkeepers \u2014 that the chief banker Avas merely a smaU money-changer \u2014 that the apothe caries' dealings consisted mostly of a half-penny Avorth of \"breast powder,\" or a farthing's Avorth of \"bitter salts,\" or the same quantity of hair oil or peppermint drops \u2014 and that the palace jeweller thought it worth his Avhile to discontinue his business as a goldsmith, and to turn his little shop into a beer-house instead,"], [371, "DRINKING CUSTOMS AMONG THE SAXONS. 349 Englishmen AviU readily understand Avhat Avas the trade and commerce of the town, and Iioav large the incomes of such tradespeople are likely to be. \" Do j'oii think,\" Ave inquired of a German who Avas likely to be one of the best-informed in the matter, \" that in estimating the income of the people of Eisenach, taking one with the other, rich as AveU as poor, at two-and-a-half dollars the week, avc have named too Ioav a figure ? \" \" Ach du grosser Go/t!\" Avas the man's exclama tion. \" Tavo dollars and a half Avoidd be too much, if you take the entire city aft round, for there is many a one in Eichel's factory that does not get his couple of dollars a-Aveek.\" HoAvever, a feAv minutes' coiiA*ersation Avas sufficient to teach us that the individual in question Avas unused to the striking of averages, and apt, like those Avho knoAV little of statistical calculations, to judge by exceptional cases, rather than by those medium in stances Avhich are more likely to furnish a clue to the general law. We repeat, therefore, that after much patient in vestigation of the subject, that Ave think 7s. 6c/. a-week is a fair calculation as to the average earnings of the entire community located in the Thuringian capital. And now let us revert to the previous question, and see what proportion of this income is expended in the matter of beer alone. It has been before sho\\A'ii that in England the average cost of the beer consumed by the AA-orking classes\u2014 for they are the principal beer-"], [372, "350 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. drinkers Avith us \u2014 amounts to between a sixth and an eighth part of the entire earnings of the labouring community ; and Ave have also represented, by details supplied us by one of the best authorities in connec tion with such a matter, that the amount of beer consumed by the grown people of Eisenach amounts to no less than tAvo-and-a-half gallons for every adult male the week ; and that if we exclude the labouring population who generally indulge in Schnapps, the quantity consumed by each male individual rises to not less than five gaUons ; so that at 19d. the gaUon, the sum expended upon malt liquor fluctuates between 2s. 6d. and 5s. for each individual in the course of the seven days, according as we include in the esti mate either the Avhole adult male community, or exclude the schnapps-drinking labourers from the cal culation. If, then, Ave assume the incomes of the better-to-do classes, avIio constitute the principal beer-drinkers in the city, at three doUars odd, or 10s. a-A\\*eek, we shall find that even, upon this liberal estimate, one half of the earnings is spent in beer alone ; whereas, if we embrace the entire adult male population in the calculation, the result, even then, would be that as much as 2s. 6d. out of 7s. 6d. is lavished upon drink, or, in other words, one-third of the gross gains of the entire people. In order to convince the reader that the above statement approximates somewhat to the truth, we may remind him of the facts, before given, as to the relative number of public-houses to individuals in our"], [373, "351 DRINKING CUSTOMS AMONG THE SAXONS. own country and in Saxony \u2014 the extreme proportion in England being one tavern to every 500 persons, and in the Thuringian capital one to eArery 350 ofthe population, even excluding the haft-dozen beer-houses in the suburbs, the landlords of which, as we said before, derive theft principal support from the town's folk. Eejecting, then, the higher estimate, and adopting only the more moderate one, viz. that one-third of the entire income of the beer-drinkers is expended in this one indulgence, the reader can readily form to himself a notion as to wdiat must be the miserable fare usual in the homes of the people, Avhose average incomes certainly cannot, at the most extraA'agant cal culation, be said, as a rule, to exceed 10s. a-Aveek. Hence we have an explanation of the miserable, un substantial food upon which famiUes have to exist, for thus we get to understand why meat, though it be but 2\\d. a pound, is a luxury that the weU-to-do can afford to enjoy only on the Sunday ; and why potato messes, and milk soups, and green-meat soups, and rotten cabbages, with dried herrings, and barley broth, and burnt-carrot coffee, and black bread, and hard-boded eggs, make up the articles usually par taken of by the citizens, the Government officials, and the professional gentry of the toAvn. In this one little item of sottish extravagance, we have an entire clue to the mystery as to Avhy this Saxon race, which some ethnologists consider to form the better element of our own, should lag so utterly behind English people ; and Avhy they should exhibit"], [374, "352 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. no more enterprise, and display no more industry, and have about as Uttle sense of comfort in tlieir dweUings as drunkards Avith us. If 3s. 4./. are wasted out of 10s. every week, and but 6s. 8c/. therefore be left for the living, housing, and clothing of those at home, Avhat wonder, that most of the families have to sleep on straAV-beds, and to live in uncarpeted and half- furnished rooms, and that the ladies even cannot afford to wear any but the A'eriest beggars' rags in their own houses ; or that one and all should consent to eat their food off bare tables, in order to avoid the expense of washing the table-cloths to coA'er them ? What wonder, too, that scarcely a gentleman in the town can afford a shirt to his back ! since the wash ing of such articles is too expensive to admit of his drinking his usual quantity of beer ; and Ave can vouch that the Herr Appellations-Bath Kranky, who occupied the attic over our head, had not a single shirt in his entire wardrobe, for OA*er and over again have we seen the Bath's entire wash spread upon the grass plot Avhich constituted the joint- stock garden of the seA'eral lodgers, and nothing but \" dickeys \" Avere to be found among it. What wonder, either, that the young children even of post-office clerks, are obliged to be left to crawl about the floor Avithout even a shoe or a stocking to their feet, and Avith nothing but a dirty flannel petticoat to their back ! Or, in fine, that every household of the Eisenach middle-classes exhibits the same squalor as, and that the families of the gentry should live little better than, the Irish peasantry of our own empire !"], [375, "DRINKING CUSTOMS AMONG THE SAXONS. 353 Nor does the sole social evil lie in the large share of the income Avhich is expended in the beer-house, for Avhile the money is going out, but little or none can be coming in ; and decent English soft: can have no sense of the hours that every German Avastes out of each Avorking day \u2014 ay, and that in the better part of the day too. As a rule all Avork is stopped in the towns between tAvelve and tAvo \u2014 the Eost Office being closed during those hours \u2014 the Courts of Justice shut up for the same time, and every one of the Government bureaux, left unoccupied also for one-sixth of the entire work-time. We cannot say whether the telegraph ceases to work during the same period, but we know that we once received a dispatch from Eeinhardtsbrunn in the forenoon which was intended to apprize us that a party of ladies and gentleman were about to pay us a visit from that quarter ; and that the message reached us two hours after the company had arrived in private carriages \u2014 rather than by rail \u2014 the distance being but three hours' journey by post, and the telegraph taking no less than five hours (!) to transmit the twenty words that constituted the intimation ; a feat which an ordinary \"extra-post wagon\" (and that is not the quickest conveyance in the world) Avould have accomplished in half the time. We will now conclude this chapter with a descrip tion of the time spent in beer-houses by the more respectable of the Eisenach community. At ten o'clock in the morning it is the rule with the trades- VOL. i. a a"], [376, "354 GERAIAN LIFE AND MANNERS. men, and others, to drop into the taverns for the enjoyment of the meal which is equivalent to the dejeuner a la fourehette in France, but which, in Germany, generally consists of a piece of sausage and black bread (eaten by means of a clasp-knife without any fork at all), and washed down by a glass of beer. In this manner half an hour of the earlier part of the day is generally consumed \u2014 the principal master cabinet-makers, watchmakers, chandlers'-shopkeepers, and others, conforming to the practice. Then, after the mid-day meal has been partaken of among the members of their several families, it is the custom with the aforesaid citizens to spend another hour in the beer-house, and there to drink, at least, one other glass of beer. At four o'clock all the Government offices close, and tins is the hour for indulging in another repast. Accordingly, the people flock in greater, or less numbers, for a longer or shorter period, to regale themselves Avith a third glass of beer. Then, again, the taverns are once more deserted until seven o'clock; after aaIucIi everyone of the forty taverns becomes filled to overflowing AAith the croAvd of guests boozing within it, and there they remain sitting and smoking till eleven at night. This, so far from being an extraordinary practice, is the rule, be it remembered, Avith every father of a family, and grown man, who can afford the luxury of chinking beer in the town. We took some pains to ascertain Avhat was the average quantity of beer drunk by each of the guests at each of the forty beer-houses in the course of each night in Eisenach, and Ave were assured that three pints to"], [377, "DRINKING CUSTOMS AMONG THE SAXONS. 355 every person was an extremely fair calculation. Now add this to the three other glasses drunk in the course of the day, and the result is the same as before stated \u2014 that five gallons the week is the average amount of malt liquor consumed by each of the frequenters of the taverns in the Thuringian capital. Nor, as Ave said before, is this the only social evil attendant upon such practices. The Legislature of England has very Avisely prohibited the custom of gambling in beer-houses, but in Eisenach the governors of the city see no harm in such indulgences ; and accordingly card-playing for money prevails in almost every tavern until midnight. It is true the stakes played for are less than a farthing, still many a groschen exchanges hands upon such occasions, and the people thus get to expect to make up by games of chance the gains which they would otherwise only look for from honest industry. Indeed, throughout the whole of Eisenach there Avas so deep-rooted a notion of acquiring large sums of money through luck that there was hardly a person avIio did not invest his \" thaler '* odd in every lottery as fast as it came round ; and many of the merchants and mecha nics were in the habit of saving up, in order to be able to make an excursion over to Gotha during the \" bird-shooting\" and to play at the \"roulette table\" sanctioned by the enlightened brother of Brince Albert, in that city ! With such habits and such practices as are above detailed, Enghshmen, who know how much depends upon good housing and good feeding in order to A a 2"], [378, "356 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. insure energy and spirit among the people of every nation, and how much of the virtue of a race depends on the inculcation of temperate habits, together Avith a faith in self-reliance and industry, wiU not fail to see that in a countiy Avhere indiscriminate sotting and gambling are the rule, Avhere the better part of the income is Avasted in the SAvinish indul gence of the head of the family \u2014 bad, unsubstantial food and defective shelter can be the only lot of the family at home ; and that one might as Avell look for muscular energy and industry from the veriest \" toss-pot \" in our oavii as from the generality of the German nation. In a word, your Teutons are a phlegmatic, torpid, lethargic race, and, like all such characters, fly to stimulating drinks in the hope of spurring their dull energies ; and the result is, as Avith the use of stimulants in general, they become ultimately even more phlegmatic, torpid, and lethargic than nature has made them. We have but to deal with another part of this subject, and then A\\*e have done. A popular opinion exists in England, that though the Germans are a beer-drinking race they indulge but little in spirituous liquors ; and Ave remember an enlightened GlasgoAV publisher, Avho Avas connected AA'ith one of the temper ance societies of that city, teUing us, on his return from a tour through Germany, that he had never been so delighted in all his life as he Avas to see seA'eral thousands of Germans assembled under one roof, listening to the grandest music, and each regaling themselves with merely a glass or _avo of beer. AVe"], [379, "357 DRINKING CUSTOMS AMONG THE SAXONS. happened, however, to have passed several years of our life among these same people, and to have acquired a knoAvledge of tlieir habits far better than he pos sibly could obtain, after a fortnight's scamper through the country We asked him if he Avas aware that the statistics of nations proved that every German \u2014 man, woman, and child \u2014 notwithstanding the prevalence of beer-houses, drank three gallons of spirits in the course of the year, Avhilst the average quantity consumed by each individual in England is only three quarts. These statistics are derived from M'Culloch, who teUs us in his \" Geographical Dic tionary \" that the annual consumption of spirits throughout Frussia amounts to betAveen forty and forty-five miUions of English gallons ; AAdiereas the entire quantity of spirits entered for home consump tion in the United Kingdom is, on the aArerage, only from twenty-five to tAventy-six million gaUons ; and this though the population of Great Britain and Ireland is nearly double that of Prussia. Hence, dividing the quantity consumed by the number of people in each country, it folloAvs that every one of the Prussian people consumes not less than four times \u25a0more ardent spirits, in the course of the year, than our own countrymen I (M'Culloch's Geogr. Diet., art. \"Prussia.\") The same authority adds, that the quantity of beer drunk by the German people is equally ex cessive, but that there are no definite returns in connection with the subject. We, however, have had it in our poAver to supply such details concerning"], [380, "358 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. the quantity of beer drunk in the capital of Thuringia, which assuredly may be taken as a type in this respect of every large German toAvn ; and, so far as our observation goes, the drinking of ardent liquors in Eisenach, by the poorer portion of the community, by no means falls short of that of any Frussian town in wliich we have been resident. We have before stated that it Avas the custom of each labourer who was engaged in the building of a new house, next to the first villa we occupied during our residence in the Thuringian capital, to consume not less than a quarter of a pint of raw spirits during his day's work. This (without calculating anything that may be taken after the daily labour is finished) is at the rate of a pint and a half a-Aveek, or nine gallons and three quarters eA'ery year ; so that, supposing such a workman to have a AAnfe and two chddren dependent upon him, this quantity alone, divided by four, Avould give very nearly two and a half gallons per annum for the average consumption of each man, woman, and child belonging to the family. This statement, however, we are satisfied is far under than OA'er the mark ; for the lodging we occu pied on the Carls Platz in Eisenach overlooked the shop to whicli the tanners, the postmen, and the railway servants, as well as many of the citizens, were in the habit of resorting for their drams through out the day ; and Ave could not help seeing them from our bay-window dropping in, not once or twice, but the same faces almost every couple of horns for the same goutte. And had we thought it worth our while"], [381, "DRINKING CUSTOAIS AMONG THE SAXONS. 359 to make a calculation, Ave are satisfied Ave could have noticed the same persons visiting the same counter at least eight times in the day. When, therefore, such excessive drinking is found to prevail among the poorest nation in Europe, avIio can marvel that there is no enterprise to be found among the merchants \u2014 no energy existing among the people ; and that they, one and all, consent to live on food AA*hich would create a reA'olt in an English Avork house, and to dAvell in styes Avhich eA*en the inhabitant of a \" casual ward,\" Avith us, Avould spurn?"], [382, "CHAPTEB III.

English servants may be plagues, but the German ones are a species of vermin far more troublesome than any whicli ever tormented poor Moses in Egypt \u2014 vermin in tlieir love of dirt, vermin in the loathsomeness of tlieir habits, and vermin in the amount of irritation to which they can subject anyone Avith the least notion of cleanliness or decency, and Avho happens to be a shade less thick-skinned than a rhinoceros, or is a degree more civilized than a Cossack. So far as Ave have seen, English maids, in decent English families, are at least clean and tidy, and have some sense of shame before men in the meaner offices they have to perform about a household. Granted, they may occasionally, on their day out, rush into the fascinating extravagance of ringlets, or eA-en presume to have a dress or a bonnet made up after the last fashion, in imitation of their mistress's neAvest robe or chapeau ; but, say the Avorst of them, they are assuredly fit to be seen by one of the opposite sex in the morning. Indeed, the maids at"], [384, "362 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. every \" respectable \" household in England are generally as neat as though they had come out of a band-box at the commencement of the day, so that we can hardly ever remember a girl who has been obliged to be ordered to her room by her mistress to tidy herself before she presumed to make her appear ance at the breakfast-table ; and over and over again, in our walks about Kensington before sunrise, we have seen Avenches hearth-stoning the door-steps of the mansions there, more decently attired and more cleanly-looking than the daughters of Saxon noble men newly dressed for their \" dancing amusement \" of a summer's afternoon, at the Klemda Gardens in Eisenach ; for the self-same cotton print whicli an English serving-girl wears in the morning, the daughters of the nobility, in Saxony, delight to sport at their summer balls of an evening. Nevertheless, a broad line of demarcation must be drawn between the tAvo classes : for, whereas the English serving maid, in the self-same costume as the Saxon ladies of title, is ahvays neat and not gaudy, the others are flashy and tawdry to the last degree \u2014 the cotton ball-dresses of the fashionable Frauleins being cut with low necks, after the manner of the girls at some sailor's brothel in England, and the skins of the dear creatures as greasy and shiny as those of Esquimaux, rather than civilized Europeans. The German serA*ing-maid, on the contrary, is the very incarnation of everything that is loathsome to a person of the least refinement. To begin she is the most dirty and slatternly trollop in appearance"], [385, "SAXON SERVANTS. 363 that could be found in any beggar's hole in London ; an Irish basket-woman is elegant and pleasant-look ing in comparison w-fth her, and an English mudlark clean and sweet beside her. For your true braves Madclien, as the Saxon serving-maid is magniloquently styled, never thinks it necessary to wash herself on a week-day, and goes about wdth the dirt on her face almost as thick as the mould, on the rind of an ancient cheese, or the crust on a bottle of fine old port ; and Avhen she does scour her face (till it shines again, like a copper tea-kettle), on a Sunday, she stiU leaves such a Avater-mark about her neck, that, as Avith some old post in the river, you can tell by the dirt clinging to the base of it exactly hoAv far the water has been in the habit of reaching for ages. So that eA'en when she has \" cleaned herself,\" she looks for all the Avorld like some restored statue with a new head upon an old grimy body, and with the line of juncture at the neck as strongly marked as are the chequers on a draught-board. MoreoArer, she goes about the entire day in a loose cotton sleeping-jacket, of that agreeable hue AA'hich hnendrapers are in the habit of recommending as \"not showing the dirt,\" and in an old linsey-woolsey petticoat \u2014 for gowns are never worn by them, excepting on high-days and holidays \u2014 without either stays or bodice, and with her locks unkempt, and her head as rough as a terrier's ; it being the rule with the SAveet creatures never to take doAvn their back hair but once a week, and then merely to replait it, and mat it together again Avith grease, tiU it shines, with the layer of"], [386, "364 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. clotted fatty matter on the top of ft, as though it were a Avig of patent leather. When Ave were a young man, and lived in lodging houses, we well remember Iioav hateful it Avas to us, after having been used to the decencies of an English gentleman's household, to see the Avretched drudge, avIio had to polish some half-a-dozen stoA'es and black double the number of boots before she could serve one's breakfast of a morning, enter the room Avith the tea-tray, and with the filthy bit of black net stuck at the back of her fuzzy head, and her hands and face as grimy as those of a blacksmith. Hoav often have Ave then sighed for the comforts of that tidy home life, which Ave, in the loA*e of liberty common to all youths on the A'erge of attaining their majority, had abandoned for the charms of unrestrained bache lorhood. And yet that same smutty and over worked Irish drudge, avIio was Avont to bring our breakfast to us, and to spread a table-cloth for us almost as grubby as her own person, was a perfect picture and a fresh-gathered nosegay in comparison Avith the repulsive, draggle-tail, grimy, fusty, and half-dressed menials, who are permitted to shuffle about the houses all clay long, even in the families of the upper classes throughout Saxony. And no wonder that such should lie the state of the servants, Avhen it is the fashion, as Ave have before said, even with the ladies themselves, to appear in the same, not-parti cularly-elegant state of deshabille, (or rather, in the wildest possible extreme of neglige), uj. to a late hour in the afternoon. For, filthy as may be the appearance"], [387, "365 SAXON SERVANTS. of the German servant-girls, they, of course, as with us, take pattern merely from their \"betters;\" and so like is the Saxon mistress to her unwashed, uncombed, and undressed maid in the morning, that over and over again Ave have gone a little before noon to the house of some gentleman in Eisenach, and on the door being opened by the Frau, after the fashion of the country, we have been under the impression that we were speaking to the grubby char-Avoman, instead of the lady at the head of the establishment. When Ave first came to the land, Ave Avere beset with the insane idea that it Avas possible to get the Thu ringian maids to conform to English notions of clean liness and propriety. Our wife purchased a stock of plain collars and Avhite aprons, as Avell as a hair-brush and comb, besides a pound or two of the very strongest yelloAV soap \u2014 (though Ave couldn't help suggesting that sand-paper and chloride of lime Avould be more effectual) \u2014 Avith the vieAV of making the diensl Mddchen a little more pleasant to behold, and agreeable to approach in the morning. But it Avas the old story of attempting to scrub the blackamoor Avhite ; the collars, the slattern positively refused to wear, saying she Avould be hooted in the toAvn if she appeared in such things on a Aveek-day, and urging that no one ever saw even the first lady in Germany Avith one of them round her neck in the house. The aprons she mistook for pocket-handkerchiefs, and would persist in applying them to the same purpose ; whilst the articles of the toilette were equally Avasted upon her; for her face still remained as grubby as a"], [388, "366 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. London dustman's, and her hair as fuzzy as the stuffing to a sofa. Indeed, we soon found out that Ave might as well attempt to train a mad dog to take to the water, as induce these same hydrophobic Saxon wenches to indulge in matutinal ablutions ; and that if Ave persevered in our hydropathic treatment of the incurables, we should be left at last to scorn* the floors, and empty the slops of the house, ourselves. For such is the inveterate aversion of the pigs to Avater, that on a certain occasion, AA'hen one of our maids fell ill with a cold, Ave recommended her to take a foot-bath before going to bed ; whereupon she mildly informed us that she wasn't fool enough to do anything of the kind, as she had once in her life bathed her feet, and didn't get over it for weeks after - Avards. So repulsive, in fine, are these \" brave girls,\" as they are called, to English people, who have been accustomed to be waited on at breakfast by tidy and clean parlour-maids in their oavii countiy, and who have been used to take their \" early meal \" someAA-hat more decently than sAvine at a trough, that Ave could not bear to see them enter our room of a morning, and never Avould alloAv them to cook the least article of food for us, or, in fact, to do any other than the meanest offices about the house ; so that our Avife and daughter had to be the cooks and parlour-maids to the establishment during our stay in the countiy. It AA'as hardly possible even to alloAv them to ansAver the door \u2014 not because of their filthy appearance, for German gentry think nothing of such matters ; but because it was beyond human poAver to train them to"], [389, "SAXON SERA'ANTS. 367 any notion of privacy or propriety, and they would as soon have thought of shoAving a postman, a beg garnian, or a butcher into your wife's bedroom, as they would of ushering a gentlemen into the kitchen, or leaving an English lady to Avait outside on the stairs. Nor could the teaching of persons of their oavii sex educate them to the least sense of shame in those duties Avhich an English housemaid Avould blush to be detected in performing by a man ; for, no matter who might be coming up the stairs at the time, they would march doAvn to the yard to empty the slops, with a certain nameless article of furniture in their hand, as ostentatiously as though they Avere carrying a A^ase of flowers before them. Now it was from the habits of these dirty, untidy, awkward, unceremonious, and shameless Saxon serv ing-girls that Ave learnt more of the filthy, uncivilized state of the higher class of German ladies than if we had been inmates of tlieir own houses for a quarter of a century ; for, of course, we saw in the maids Avhat were the habits of the families in wliich they had previously lived ; and when they were told they must not do such a thing in such a manner, as it Avas offensive to English notions of either decency or politeness, the invariable answer Avas, that at the Frau von This, or the Apjjctlafions-Gericht-Bdthiu That they had ahvays been accustomed to act in the same manner, and that Ave English folk were \" sehr curiose Leute\" (very queer people).

Not one of them kneAV even Iioav to lay a table, or the use of salt-spoons or egg-cups ; or to polish a knife and fork, other than by rubbing them with a bit of old rag in the ashes from the stoves ; or to clean a Avater-bottle, except with potato-parings ; or to Avash a glass by any other means than a piece of old sack-cloth ; or to dry a plate in a plate-rack ; for all the ordi nary appliances of a tidy English household are utterly unknown in Germany \u2014 dusters, glass-cloths, bottle-brushes, dish-clouts, scrubbing-brushes, knife boards\u2014not to speak of housemaids' -boxes \u2014 being as great rarities as blotting-paper, cruet-stands, plate warmers, finger-glasses, or foot-baths, in benighted Thuringia. Nor will this be Avondered at, when we tell the reader that there Avas not so much as a cistern or a water-butt throughout the entire capital \u2014 every drop of liquid required in the house haA'ing to be fetched in long Avooden-pails, like enormous quivers, and left to stand in such pails till AA'hat you had to drink acquired the flavour of soddened and rotting Avood ; not a drain, not a sink, Avas there attached to any dwelling ; not a dust-hole nor a Avater-closet to be found in the land \u2014 all the refuse of the house haA'ing to be thrown into the back-yard, and there treasured in a heap until the manure season came round ; not a"], [391, "369 SAXON SERVANTS. knife-house, nor so much as a back-kitchen or pantry, in connection with any lodging \u2014 all the cutlery, the boots, and the clothes having to be cleaned in the little hole in Avhich the meals were to be cooked ; and, in a word, such a state of general piggery as requires a far greater amount of patience and philo sophy than even Mr. Job himself possessed, to endure. We believe that throughout Eisenach there Avere only tAvo carpeted rooms to be found : the one at the Circle Director's, and the other at the dweUing of the English ladies, who, when avc first came to the place, were residents in the town. For ourselves, as we were birds of passage, and never thought, when avc first set foot in the hole, that our business would have detained us so long there, bare sanded floors, like those of an English tap-room, were our lot ; so that we lived to hate the clay when it came to the time for the girl to scour the boards, Avith a wisp of straw in her hand an da box of sand at her side ; or to dust the room with an old goose-Wing ; for Ave kneAv that our apartments would then be as pleasant to tread upon as a graA'el walk after a shoAver of rain ; and, though om* investigations among the poor had taught us to bless God for the feAv comforts that were vouch safed to us, Ave never set eyes upon those loathsome Saxon drudges \u2014 we never set foot in our bare-boarded Saxon rooms \u2014 we never turned into our blanketless and counterpaneless Saxon bed, but we re-riled our selves bitterly for the fool's-errand that had led us to the countiy, and Ave sighed in our heart even for an English pauper's hfe ; for we kneAV, from om- insight VOL.

Diogenes in a tub was considered in the days of Grecian stoicism to be the perfection of human wisdom ; but though we haA'e learnt some little philosophy from our avocations, no study has yet taught us to find a delight in filth, or to prefer the barbarisms of life to the comfort and decencies (without the follies) of polite society; and AAre have often, during our stay in Saxony, wondered whether the Grand-Duke of Saxe Coburg-Go tha in the course of his travels in the Avilds of Africa, found the conical mud huts of the people there much more cheerless, and much more barren of all those articles of comfort Avhich English folks have learnt to think necessary for the enjoyment of a decent hfe, than we found the rooms in which our OAvn Queen Avas housed at the \"palace\" of Eeinhardtsbrunn. While upon this part of our subject, Ave may as Avell finish the ugly picture we haAre drawn of Ger man domestic hfe, by adding a rough sketch of the ordinary sleeping apartments in which the gentry of the country consent to pass at least one-third of tlieir time. Of the Lilliputian dimensions of the German bedsteads avc have already spoken. A baby's crib, indeed, is the only thing, in our country, to which they can be compared \u2014 the generality of them being but 2 feet 9 inches broad, and 6 feet 6 inches long (inside measurement) ; so that a Avretched"], [393, "SAXON SERVANTS. 371 Englishman, who happens to stand 5 feet 1 1 inches out of his shoes, and to measure 2 feet across the shoulders, might as Avell think of passing a comfort able night in an egg-chest, or orange box, as of sleeping, Avith anything like ease, in a tester hardly broader and longer than a shutter. If he happen to be a Benedict, into the bargain, he must fain live the isolated life of a spicier in a cobweb ; since the endeavour to pack a man and his Avife in a German bed Avould be as vain as striving to thrust the legs of Daniel Lambert into the tights of the \" Living Skeleton.\" But if the German beds are thus scanty in their proportions, the German bedrooms are equally dimi nutive, being usually no larger than an English knife house, and, indeed, hardly bigger than a police-cell ; since they generally consist of a mere slip cut off from the sitting-room, and just long enough and broad enough to allow a person to pass beside the miniature bedstead \u2014 the A\\diole furniture being merely one chair, in addition to the bed itself. Chests of draAvers, indeed, are generally reserved as the chief ornament for the Bud-slube (literally the chest-out room) ; Avhile such things as Avash-stands, or toilette tables, are found only in the best hotels to AA'hich foreigners resort ; since it is the custom Avith the German gentry to Avash themselves (Avhen they may happen to think it necessary to do so) either at the pump or in the kitchen, and for the ladies to \" do tlieir hair\" at the looking-glass in the sitting-room. Neither is there the least strip of carpet beside the r. b 2"], [394, "372 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. bed, such as avc give to servants ; nor, indeed, a foot bath, hair-brush, tooth-brush, or any other appliance of modern decency and civilization, to be found in the place. In one such a \" dog-hole \" of a bed chamber, it is usual for the entire female members of the family to sleep \u2014 but in separate beds ; so that often in a room but 8 by 12 feet, there wiU be three bed steads stowed away, with merely sufficient space to pass between them ; AA'hile the father and the son or sons have another similar cupboard appropriated to their use. This is the usual state of domestic piggery in Deutschland ; for your true German cares not Avhat kind of stye he, or his family, be penned in at home, so long as there be one show-room in the establishment for the reception of visitors. Some times, indeed, it is the custom for groA\\*n-up brothers and sisters to share the same bed-chamber ; and that this is, by no means, an exceptional case, Ave may cite the fact that, over and over again, Avhen we have been in quest of lodgings, the people would tell us that one sleeping chamber would suffice for our son and daughter, though AA*e had previously informed them that they were no longer children. And Avhen wo answered that such Avas not the custom in our country, they would raise their shoulders, and their eyebrows, in astonishment at our squeamishness, and cry Liebe gar ! as if they really looked upon us as the mad English folk, AA'hich the Germans are in the habit of styling the \" proud Britons.\" Now, in England, the journals haA'e lately been"], [395, "SAXON SERVANTS. 373 silled with leading articles and letters denouncing the atrocity of certain JeAv tradesmen, in packing poor milliners' girls in sleeping apartments of such limited dimensions as to contain not more than 300 cubic feet of air for the respiration of the inmates throughout the night ; and a coroner's jury has just returned a verdict that the death of a young seamstress (one Mary Ann Walkley, working and sleeping at Madame Elise's in Eegent Street) was accelerated by such means. In Germany, hoAArever, such an extent of space is a liberal aUovvance \u2014 eAren in the sleeping chambers of gentlefolk. In the family of one of the principal auditors of the gOArernment taxes, the apartment in which the mother and her two daughters passed the night, was not more than 12 feet long, 8 feet broad, and 8 feet high ; and, consequently, contained but 768 cubic feet of atmosphere among three people ; which is at the rate of only 256 cubic feet for each. Moreover, the lodging's which Ave our- 3 OCT selves rented during the latter part of our stay in Eisenach, and in which our son and daughter were respectively obliged to sleep Avith their Avincknvs open, owing to the confined nature of the bedchambers, CT were afterwards let to a schoolmaster ; and in two of those rooms, which were so small that we had con sidered them unfit for sleeping apartments, and used them only as store closets, the pedagogue arranged for no less than nine boys to pass the night. These chambers were respectively 9h x 13-J x 9, and, there fore, had together a cubic capacity of a fraction more"], [396, "374 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. than 2300 feet of air, and this, divided by 9, gives just upon 256 for the number of cubic feet of atmos phere left for each of the wretched lads to respire through the night-time. Nor are these in any way peculiar cases. At one of the principal master-bakers of the town, the mother and six children, many of whom were grown up, slept in a long slip of a room that Avas more like a passage than a regular dormitory. Again, at the Lord High Chamberlain's, the mother and three CT * daughters passed the night in a place that was hardly better than a cupboard, so little light entered there, and so limited were its dimensions ; whilst at one of the post secretaries, the husband and wife, with three children and a baby, all slept in a hole which Avas so small that it was difficult to cram the requisite number of bedsteads into it. Even at the Wartburg, too, the sleeping apartments of the duke and duchess are not nearly as capacious as the attics which we appropriate to our domestics in England. Indeed, the Germans themselves are utterly ashamed of the holes in which they retire to rest ; and this is exemplified by the fact that on a lady being invited to a coffee-drinking at any of their houses, she is never shown to any bedroom to take off her bonnet, but expected to make her toilette in public \u2014 her shawl or cloak being carried off by one of the daughters of the family, and she left to arrange her hair at the glass in the general sitting-room. And O CT O when, on the other hand, any German ladies come to"], [397, "SAXON SERVANTS. 375 visit an English family resident in the city, they are astonished to find themselves conducted to a lady's dressing-room before joining the company, for not only are such customs, but even such apart ments, utterly unknown in the land. What wonder, then, that typhus fever continually rages in Eisenach ? for this is iioav known to be one of the diseases arising from over-crowding and imperfect \\*entilation. Beclet has proved that a man consumes upAvards of 200 cubic feet of air per hour, and, consequently, exhales a correspondingly large amount of \" mephitic gas \" in the same time ; so that in a closed room, the minimum allowance of air Avhich is said to be safe for a person to sleep in, is taken generally at tAvo hours' breathing quantity, or 400 cubic feet \u2014 a space such as is contained within the Avails of an ordinary prison-cell. In fever hospitals, however, the ratio of air to each bed is estimated at not less than 1500 cubic feet; whilst at the model hospital at Bordeaux 2200 cubic feet are allotted to the bed of each patient ; and it is found that when the poisonous emanations of the body are diluted to this extent, the infection of typhus is destroyed, and that patients afflicted Avith this \u2014 the most dangerous and subtle of all fevers \u2014 may be placed in the common ward of a hospital without danger to the others. In Eisenach, however, the air supply of ordinary bed-chambers, as we have shown, seldom reaches 300 cubic feet for each inmate \u2014 the families even of gentlefolks there sleeping as closely packed, and in rooms as bare and foul as at the vilest"], [398, "376 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. penny \" shakedown \" at the east end of the British metropolis. One of the great marvels to us, in connection with the German servants, Avas, that not only had they no sense of your comfort, but scarcely any regard for their own ; since they wrould consent to live, or rather pig, in a manner that an Irish tramp would hardly submit to. Not only had they no idea of sitting doAvn to their meals, but they would dispense Avith all the usual appliances associated with feeding in civilized nations. Not to speak of table-cloths \u2014 for they are luxuries that even gentlefolks in Saxony consider superflous, excepting on feast-days \u2014 they would take tlieir dinners even without plates and dishes, or so much as a knife or a fork, or indeed a chair ; their usual custom being, to stand at the edge of the stove, and to pull the potatoes and meat out with their fingers from the frying-pan, in Avhich they delighted to warm up their food in a black pool of fat. Their coffee, again, at morning and evening, Avas drunk in the same unmannerly fashion, for this also Avas taken standing \u2014 their habit being to hold the cup in tlieir hands as they leant against the wall or the dresser, and to sop and suck a piece of black bread in it, until the AA-hole of the liquid had been lapped up in such a manner. Nor did they seem to want any tidy or cosy servant's room to sit in ; for the brick-paved kitchen, which in a German house is no bigger than an English larder, AA*as all they desired of an eArening; and"], [399, "SAXON SERVANTS. 377 there, by the light of a wretched penny oil lamp, made out of tin, they Avould sit in the long winter's nights, without a sigh for any happier state. More over, the places in wdiich they are willing and accustomed to sleep, are such holes as an English gentleman Avould not dream of housing a dog in ; and one of the girls, after she had left our service, assured us that the bed she had in her next place was in a shed, Avith merely a feAv bricks and a board or two, to keep the straw sack Avhich served her for a mattrass, off the earth. Again, they had not the least notion of orderly arrangement in tlieir work, so that they Avould often Avish to begin scrubbing some floor at eleA'en o'clock at night ; or else would delight to be up at three or four o'clock in the summer-time clattering away with their pails, and banging the doors as though they fancied every rational being should begin the day with the birds. Indeed, it was astonishing to us hoAv small an amount of sleep these Saxon drudges could do with. It Avas the general custom for Avasher- Avomen to begin tlieir day's labour at three in the morning, even in the winter ; and when it Avas the season for laying in the stock of avooc! for the year, and every street Avas littered Avith the logs, so that you had to pick your Avay dow-n the thoroughfare as through a timber-yard, the Avood-cutters would begin chopping and sawing long before the sun was up \u2014 CA-en though it Avas set down in the calendar to rise at 3.45 a.m. \u2014 till, what with the clatter about the house and in the street, and the riot of the chums at"], [400, "378 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. the adjoining barracks, eA'en if it had been possible to get a good night's rest out of a German bed, such things were about as conducive to slumber as if you had been passing the night in the neighbourhood of old Smithfield on a market-day. Nor is it possible to educate the Avretched bond slaves to better ways ; so that if you happen to have a palate that can distinguish between the flavour of \" w&ter-zoetje \" and pickled AA'helks, you are sure, unless the very sharpest eye be kept upon them, to find that they have either been drying the wine glasses with an oily rag (for it is beyond human art to teach them to haA'e different cloths for different pinposes) ; or giving you a fishy or oniony knife at your dessert ; or dropping the tallow-grease into the Avater-tub ; or using the dinner napkin for a pocket handkerchief; or cleaning their nails Avith your forks ; or brushing yom* light summer coat with the blacking brushes ; or using the hat brush to polish your boots, or putting* your best hnen glass-cloths to the same ignominious offices as house-flannels ; or polishing the spoons on the knife-board \u2014 or, in a word, doing a thousand and one things, wliich are no offence to a leather-tongued and insensate German, but Avhich to more refined tastes are as loathsome as the habits of \" skunks.\" To train such beings to wait at table would require far more patience and perseverance than to teach a hippopotamus to dance ; for in Germany such a thing Avas never heard of, except at the first-class hotels used by strangers, as, a domestic remaining in the room during dinner"], [401, "SAXON SERVANTS. 379 time. Nor could you even suffer them to remove the dinner things AAdien the feast was ended ; since the only notion they had of \" taking away \" was of piling everything on the top of one another in their arms \u2014 dirty plates, salt-cellars, napkins, mustard pot, remains of salad, and surplus pudding \u2014 all in one chaotic heap, as though the remains of the entertainment were intended for the mixen rather than the larder. Another peculiar trait distinctive of these elegant young ladies is their loA'e of sitting round the doorstep, like so many Irish girls in St. Giles', of a summer's evening ; so that if you happened to live on the first floor you might shout yourself as hoarse as a costermonger (for there are no such things as bells) to summon }*our domestic ; and maybe, have at last to put your head out of the window and call her up from the knot of soldiers with Avhom she was sure to be giggling, as soon as it AA'as dusk, under the gate way. The dear, innocent English reader will doubtlessly inquire, \" Why have submitted to such conduct ? Why not haAre made them different ? \" Sweet lamb ! we answer, do you come over and make the attempt yourself. We can assure you there is a fine field here open to you, if you are inclined to distinguish your self in civilizing the savages ; though w*e are much mistaken if you are not obliged to act as your OAvn charwoman, before many months of the Quixotism have passed over your head. Talk of making a silk purse out of a sow's ear ! Why, that would be a"], [402, "380 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. comparatively easy bit of textile handiwork to mould ing such clods into anything like proper form. You might as well attempt to train a London dustman into a Beau Brummel, or convert a Billingsgate fish fag into a Mrs. Fry, as tAvist those crooked limbs into anything approximating to the symmetry of the \" human form divine ; \" for, as Ave have before said, you see in such serA'ing-girls merely the caricatures of tlieir mistresses' habits. It must be borne in mind, too, that a German house is not the most pleasant abiding-place on the face of the earth ; that it is not intended, as in Eng land, to be the snug nest to AA-hich the old and young birds loA'e perpetually to return, as the happiest, cosiest spot in all the Avorld \u2014 the home of the united family ; but, on the contrary, it is merely the \"house\" (for this is their usual Avay of speaking of it, even as the lady to whom a German is married delights to call her wedded partner her \" man \" rather than her husband). The house it is truly, and a house merely, as contra distinguished from a home, \u2014 a kennel, a st}-, a lair, a den for the animals merely to sleep and find shelter in ; and a place which eA'ery one of them consequently loves to flee from, rather than fly to, for any pleasure or peaceful enjoyment. Hence, as the \" man \" of every German house betakes himself to his tavern for his eArening's amusement ; in the same manner, we repeat, does the \" AA'oman \" of the establishment hurry off to the beer-gardens several times a-Aveek, immediately the weather will allow her, in order to find some place more agreeable and comfortable to her than her own"], [403, "SAXON SERVANTS. 381 domestic \" flat.\" Even so, too, does the wretched scrub of a serving-girl hanker to get away from the brick paved dog-hole of a kitchen (which is more like an English, wash-house than the tidy places common to servants in our oavii country), and naturally prefer, directly the spring comes round again, and the air is sufficiently tempered to admit of out-door recreations, to sit knitting on the door-step, rather than remain pent up in the stifling sty set apart for her use. Accordingly, the stranger finds, after a feAv months' bitter experience in the Thuringian capital, that he must submit to Avait upon himself the moment it grows dusk ; for no sooner has the sun set than the girl is off, AA'ith the long wooden Butte, as it is called, strapped to her back, to the nearest street-pump to fetch the supply of water for the next clay. This is an occupation which usually takes an hour at least ; not that there is the slightest difficulty in getting the pail filled, but simply because round about these springs the common soldiers of Eisenach delight to group themselves as the clay draws in ; and there the maids remain, flirting the time away, Avhile you, perhaps, are sitting with your tongue out, gasping for a drink of water in the dog-days. We once in the course of our chequered life kneAV the delights of a bachelor's lodging in Albany Street, where those \" AA'onderfully fine men,\" the English Life Guards happened to be quartered at the upper end of it ; and, gracious powers ! the whole of the cooks, housemaids, and nursery-maids in that extensive thoroughfare seemed to have had their"], [404, "382 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. head tinned by the long-legged and short-caped warriors prowling about the neighbourhood. The Avay in which our cold meat and om' cigars then disappeared was astounding ; and it was a curious sight to witness how, as the bugle sounded in the evening, there was sure to be a daddy-long-legs creep ing up from every area in the street, and wiping his moustachios after the feast to wliich the cook had treated the \" gallant defenders of the country \" \u2014 oft1 our pigeon-pie. \" Hah, sir,\" sighed a CamberweU omnibus-driver to us, as he dropped a showfty-dressed woman at the barrack-gates in that district, \" it's stunning, the distance them there females will come arter them there long sticks of sealing-Avax.\" But in the Thuringian capital \u2014 though the private soldiers are hardly \"finer men\" than English drum mer-boys, and have the same military appearance, in their leathern helmets and sad-coloured uniforms as our fire-brigade men \u2014 they are, nevertheless, regarded as soldiers are by the servant-girls of the entire uni verse, in the light of warring \" hangels ;\" and, though the wages of these Saxon drudges range only from 1/. 16s. to 2/. 14s. the year, the fond and not-parti cularly-sweet creatures are ready to lavish tlieir last quarter's salary upon the noble protectors of their land, and to find them in beer and tobacco, as well as to pay for their admission to the Mohren balls, out of tlieir Areiy hard-earned gains. Indeed, in a countiy where public Avomen are prohibited by the police, and a standing army enforced in every petty"], [405, "SAXON SERVANTS. 383 principality by the regulation of the Bundes-rath of Germany \u2014 where the soldiers of the empire, in a word, have to be collected from different duchies \u2014 (even as the cowherds of the region are wont, by the sound of the bugle, to assemble piecemeal the flock they have to take out into the fields) nevertheless, the ungainly and stunted military clod-hoppers in Eisenach were sufficient to drive the AA-hole race of \" brave maids \" there raving mad, and to debauch every housemaid, nurserymaid, and cook in the place ; tiU it Avas almost impossible to introduce a serving maid into your family aa*1io w7as not as degraded as the trulls Avho delight in the embraces of common CT sailors at the east end of London. Nor is the catalogue of English grievances re specting these trollops of Saxon handmaids yet ended. We have before spoken of their slovenly habits about the house; but as it is the custom with German laches to think it necessary to \"clean\" themselves only when they have occasion to leave tlieir homes, so do these drudges stipulate, when they enter your service, for a special costume, in which they are to appear abroad in the streets. Hence it is the fashion with aU the families to keep a wretched washed-out chintz cloak, but a little bit longer than a policeman's cape, for their servant to wrap about them in the cold weather ; or rather, wherewith to screen the basket or the bottle they have usually under their arms. And during our first winter's residence in the countiy, when the snow lay far thicker on the earth than the sugar on a bride-cake, Ave never remember to have"], [406, "384 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. seen more wretched objects than these bare-headed villein girls, shuffling along in tlieir faded pink or blue chintz mantles at break of clay, on their way to the nearest baker's or chandler's shop, for either the rolls or the schnapps, Avanted as soon as their master's or mistress's eyes were open. A Lascar crossing sweeper huddled up in his white sheet, with the ther mometer beloAV freezing-point, is the only thing com parable to them in our land. There is a cant abroad which is extremely consoling to the minds of English clergymen, that the en lightened traveller has only to pass from a Protestant village to a Catholic one on the Continent, in order to discover at a glance the social benefits of the Refor mation, in the greater comforts and better-to-do air of the Lutheran people. But we, aaIio haA*e liA'ed on the banks of the Bhine for many a score of months, where the generality of the folk are wedded to Papal institutions as strongly as the Irish members of our own Parliament; and a\\*1io haA'e lived too in the heart of Saxony, where the Lutheran form of religion is so deeply rooted that the Catholic pastor, avIio came to tend the mere handful of a flock to be found in Eisenach, Avas black-balled at the Klemda AA'hen he Avishecl to become a member of that elegant club \u2014 after such experience Ave can conscientiously aA'er that the Ehenish Catholic population is by many degrees less squalid and less beggarly in their appearance, and their habits, than the common people of Saxony. In fact, such Exeter Hall doctrines are the mere bigotted fustian of these Sir-John-Dean-Paul Pharisaical days ;"], [407, "SAXON SERVANTS. 385 for, granted that a form of religion wliich believes in charity more than faith, may have a tendency to breed beggars, and such a pariah tribe as swarmed in England previous to the destruction of the monas teries, as Avell as a host of lazzaroni, such as are to be found in Borne at the present day \u2014 nevertheless, the social welfare of a people, it is known to those who haAre looked in any way to the principles regulating the wealth of nations, has nothing what ever to do with this or that form of worship ; but depends merely upon matters of political economy which it Avill require a hundred years yet to drum into the dunderheads of the riders of the German nation. Let any gentleman wdth a white-ch'oker about his neck, and a brain sensible to reason with in his skull, pack up his carpet-bag, and be off to Thuringia by the next train ; and Ave warrant, if he be not as fanatic and short-sighted as a believer in the divinity of Miss Johanna Southcote, that he will wonder AA'hen he opens his eyes on the first morning after his arrival in Eisenach \u2014 the centre of Lutheran Saxony \u2014 whether he has not, by mistake, been carried off to the interior of Catholic Ireland ; for assuredly he Avill find the people in Thuringia as dirty and squalid, and as ingrained beggars, as the poorer Irish, \u2014 as deficient in energy and enterprise as are the Spanish folk in the nineteenth century \u2014 and as little self-reliant or high-spirited as any mendicant tribe in the veriest hot-bed of Popedom. Indeed, a German town or viUage is the same grubby, cheerless, desolate picture of misery and des- vol. i. c c"], [408, "386 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. titution wherever you go \u2014 let the form of worship lie whatever it may \u2014 for the creed upheld by the Pope or Martin Luther has no more to do Avith the social condition of the folk than Exeter Hall itself is the grand focus of the civilization of our own countiy. One other characteristic custom has still to be men tioned before the long catalogue of domestic miseries in Saxony is finished. We shall, by-and-by, have to tell the reader how there are certain ancient pagan holidays still celebrated in Thuringia, and far more religiously regarded than any of the appointed festivals of the Church ; for though Christmas day is a comparatively-neglected festi vity, the heathen rejoicings at the time of the new year, and at Easter and Whitsuntide, are continued to such an extent, that then work of all kinds invariably ceases \u2014 eA'en down to the baking of bread \u2014 and that for two or three days together ; and at the vernal holiday-season servants AviU often start off at one or tAvo in the morning for a ramble Avith their SAveethearts or friends into the woods. Now at such times there is a ball, or \" coAv-kickup,\" as it is ele gantly styled by the citizens \u2014 held at eA'ery one of the Ioav taverns in the town, whither eArery seiving maid and eATery common soldier thinks it as sacred a duty to proceed as a Mussulman does to Mecca. We remember comparing notes at a Ehenish table d'hote with the English chaplain at Eotterdam upon this matter ; and he told us that he found it impossible to preA'cnt servant-maids in Holland absenting them selves at such times from the house, for Iavo or three"], [409, "SAXON SERVANTS. 387 nights together. Our experience in Saxony, though it hardly goes to such an extreme, was but a little less annoying to the habits of a quiet English family ; for we verily believe one might as soon have expected a war-horse to ha\\re remained quiet at the sound of a trumpet, as haA-e prevailed upon those girls to keep in doors one minute after the bands at such holiday balls had commenced playing. No threats of immediate dis missal nor bribe of increased wages, would haA'e been potent enough to have withdrawn them from such festivities ; and though the servant girls are supposed, by the police regulations, to be bound to return to their master's house every night before ten, Ave never kneAv one of them avIio did not walk off with the key of the door, and remain out, till almost the Arery hour when you were about to rise in the morning. The same thing too goes on, though in a modified form, almost every Sunday ; for, as the sabbath is the great weekly holiday on the Continent, there is sure to be either Tanz-musik in the \" Mohren \" or in the \" Engel,\" or else a \" concert \" at the \" Stadt Graben \" (literally the tavern by the town ditch) or an \" dt ali an - ische Nacht\" in the shape of a few Chinese lanterns and a little red fire at the \" Felsen Keller \" \u2014 each Sunday evening, as soon as the fine weather sets in ; and thither the Avenches, in their crinolines and flaunting low-necked cotton dresses (for on such occasions gowns at least are worn by them) are in the habit of swarming as thick as bees at the sound of a gong \u2014 Avhilst you and your poor family (if you are prone to prefer a home-life to that of the charms of card-play - c c 2"], [410, "388 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. ing at a tavern on the Sunday) will be left to perform the household duties for yourselves. Again, at the time of the \" year markets,\" which occur quarterly, you are expected to give your girl a certain sum of money over and above her wages, so that she may purchase some boots, under-clothing, or what-not for herself. This, though originally meant as a present, or reward for good conduct, has iioav grown into a right ; so that, when you are hiring a new maid (which, by the bye, you can only do every three months, no matter what may be the conduct of the one you are saddled with in the interim), it is customary for the girls to stipulate for so much wages, and a thaler or two in addition to spend at these same quarterly markets. Indeed, this system of universal present-giving in Germany is one of the most hateful practices in con nection with one of the most hateful countries in which we ever pitched our tent. The people them selves have a saying that in such usages they are merely \" trying with a sausage to get a side of bacon ; \" but, though aft knoAV Iioav mean a traffic the system of present-making has sunk into, all still continue to trade in it ; and, no sooner have you set foot in the hole of a city, than you are deluged Avith embroidered slippers, and worked braces, and beaded pens, and trumpery purses and cigar-cases, in the hope of extorting from you in return some article of jeweUery or dress of ten times the value. In fact, every occasion is taken advantage of to smother you with some paltry bit of bead-Avork, or Berlin avooI-"], [411, "389 SAXON SERVANTS. work, by the ladies. Either they have found out that it is the birthday of yourself, or some member of your family ; or else it is NeAv Year's Day, or the return of your wedding day ; or they have been absent in the country a short time, and could not help bringing you some remembrance of the place. In fact, the pettiest excuses are framed for bribing you into making some liberal present in return ; for, though everybody knoAvs the hollowness of the prac tice, everyone deals and haggles in it ; and that so generally, that the principal article of furniture in a German room is the three-cornered glass-cupboard, in which are set out all the trumpery gilt and painted coffee-cups, bouquets of flowers made out of coffee berries and rice, pinch-beck watches, copper-looking bracelets, pen-holders rendered utterly useless by the profusion of beads with which they are ornamented, patent leather mats, and, indeed, the thousand and one articles of tasteless gimcrackery upon AA'hich German young ladies like to waste their time and their scanty means, in the hope of catching something like a her ring for the very small sprat with which they are in the habit of angling. \" Gracious Heaven ! \" said a friend of ours, \" thai old woman has sent me a box of cigars, which are so bad I can't smoke them ; and the worst of it is, she'll expect me to give each of her children \u2014 and oh, good God ! she has eight young ones \u2014 a new frock at least for the trash.\" \" No : I shall not buy myself a new mantle this spring,\" said a Saxon lady to our wife ; \" because, you"], [412, "390 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. see, there is a friend of mine coming from a long distance to visit me shortly, and I have worked a porte-monnaie for her ; and then most likely, if I do hint I do want such a thing, she will give me a hand some new summer cloak.\" Or here is another characteristic conversation that Ave heard going on between two sisters, as they were engaged in picking gooseberries in their garden. \" There, Maria ! it's no use thy picking all the big berries off the bushes, for thy godmother ; she'll never giAre thee anything out of the way,\" said the elder to the younger girl. \"Well, I don't know, Annchen,\" answered the other Avith a shake of the head, \" but I think she ought to giAre me something handsome this time; for I've taken her a nosegay every week all the summer through, and she's had uoav four and a half pints of the A'ery best of the gooseberries for a present, into the bargain.

Nor does this general bribery prevail only among the genteel classes ; for even the shopkeepers, at certain seasons, resort to the same practices Avith your servants, in order to keep up the \" custom,\" in the double sense of the word. Accordingly, at particular times, the druggist where you are in the habit of getting your pills, potions, and powders, gives your girl a bottle of hair-oil ; the chandler's-shop-keeper makes her a present of an apron, or a small packet of coffee and sugar ; your tobacconist offers her an ounce or tivo of snuff for her aged mother; your butcher treats her to a quarter of a pound of liver sausage ; your baker to a few sweet-cakes \u2014 and so on to the end of the chapter ; till no one in the Avhole country has the least self-reliance or independence left in them ; and all belieAre that the only Avay to advance in life is by currying faA*our with those wdio are the least bit better-off than themselves ; Avhile everyone is ready to lick the dust off your feet, and, indeed, to do anything in the world for you \u2014 no matter Iioav mean and servile \u2014 so long as they fancy they can get anything out of you by it."], [414, "CHAPTEB IV. the saxon servants (continued). Still, the most curious of the customs in connection with Saxon servants remains to be explained. In Saxony, A\\diere the GoA*ernment or police meddle in everything with which they have no moral or political right to interfere, seiwitude, instead of being a social institution, is there placed under the special super intendence of the Bolizei \u2014 eA'ery servant in the country being as much under the police as though he, or she, Avere a coiiA'ict with a ticket-of-leave in England. Such things as verbal characters are utterly unknoAvn in the land. The usual mode is for the maid, Avhen she enters your service, to bring her Dicnst buch, as it is called, with her ; in Avhich are written a few lines of useless recommendation from each of the masters or mistresses with Avhom she had pre viously lived, all duly certified by the official seal of the authorities of the town. This Bicnsf-bueh is then given into your possession, Avhere it remains until such time as you have reason to part Avith the girl ; and then you are expected, if not bound, to Avrite in it the same tarradiddles concerning the maid's good conduct, her honesty and sobriety, as"], [415, "SAXON SERVANTS. 393 her other masters and mistresses haA'e done before you. For, no matter how badly behaved the girl may have been, no one is disposed to deprive the poor drudge of her living by penning the literal truth ; and therefore all go on scribbling white lies systematically, one after the other, and upholding a practice which is as silly as it is useless, and which even the wiseacres at the head of the Government ought long ago to have found out that the girls them selves are continually in the habit of evading. For it is the custom with the servants, Avhenever anything may be Avritten in tlieir book that they are not parti cularly anxious to submit to every eye, to retire to tlieir native place, some miles distant in the country, on the plea of the illness of some relative ; and, after absenting themselves for several months from the town, to return Avithout their Bienst-buch, A.hich they profess to have lost, and thus to start in life again with a bran-neAv A'olume and an utterly-un blemished character. In the nineteenth century Ave Englishmen can but Avonder that such antiquated tomfooleries should con tinue in a land which, to say the least, has had some feAv Avise men belonging to it ; and that the poor wretches who are doomed to the most irksome form of labour in the Avorld should, in this age of enlight ment, be as jealously watched and guarded as though they were criminals ; and be bound to report them selves at stated times to the police authorities \u2014 like the convicts set at liberty before the expiration of their sentence in our oavii country."], [416, "394 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. However, that the English reader may have a thorough notion of the atrocities still upheld by the dunderhead officials of Saxony, we Avill conclude this chapter by laying before him a literal translation of the police regulations prefixed to the \"service-book\" which every maid- and man-servant is expected to have in his or her possession. I, Chief Duties of Servants.* \" The seiwant has to pay attention and sIioav respect * The ahove rules, in the printed matter prefixed to the Ser- vice Book, are entitled \" Extract from the Servants' Order-Book of the 18th June, 1823, and from the Subsequent Laws made the 20th April, 1839,\" though who were the parties ordaining such laws the book does not inform us.

High-minded Germans, however, like to say \" Will es nicht griissen ?\" (Will it not salute) \u2014 a form of speech used by officers and sergeants to private soldiers omitting to touch their caps to them.) \" The work which is given by its master or mistress to the servant to be performed, but which must accord with the strength of the servant, must be executed at any hour of the day or night ; and the servant may not without its master's consent, aA'ail itself of any other person to assist in it. \" The servant has to consider the Avelfare and advantage of its master and mistress, and so far as lies in its poAver to protect them against injury.

Faidts of this character can be punished according to the criminal laAvs of the countiy. \" By pilfering, or withholding drink-money which ought to haA'e been divided among its feUoAv servants ; by purloining the fodder given out to it for the cattle ; all of Avhich offences may be punished Avith tweh'e days' imprisonment. \" If the master suspect the servant of dishonesty, he may have its things and boxes searched, or the master may search them himself; but the latter can only be clone in the presence of the servant.

By any injury to the master, by deeds or words ; such as scandal, or talking openly of the faults or secrets of the master, or speaking of any thing that goes on in the house, or by inducing its feUow-servants to do the like. \" All breaches of duty in this respect, whether bj* Avords or deeds, provided they are not of a very serious character, are punishable with imprisonment for fourteen days ! \" Moderate chastisement, and reprimand, caused hy the improper behaviour of the servant, are not to be"], [419, "397 SAXON SERVANTS. considered as any wrong done to it, and give the servant no right to obtain a summons against its master sot redress ; excepting it should so happen, that in the course of the reprimand the servant has been accused of thieving, or of doing anything else which it could prove to be untrue. \" If the servant has any just cause of complaint against its master, then can it go before a magistrate ; but in no case is absconding permissible. \" A servant avIio absconds from its master can be forced, at its master's desire, to return to its servitude, and must, if the master so Avishes, serve its time out ; but if, on the other hand, it has valid reasons for Avishing to leave, such as are given here under the proper head, it need serve only to the end of the quarter, or if hired by the month, to the month's end.

For avIio, with any idea of decency or manly corn-age, Avould justify the sentence that tells us that \" moderate chastisement \" is not to be considered as any wrong done to a female servant by her master; and that eA*en Avhen the girl is beaten she is to have no right of obtaining a summons against her brutal and cowardly persecutor !

Again, Iioav fair and honourable is the canon Avhich ordains, that if a master unjustly accuses a servant maid of theft, she shall have no claim for compensa tion from him, even though her character for honesty is all the poor drudge has to liAre upon ! We haA'e gh'en the police rules upon this matter in their full integrity, so that none may accuse us of garbled extracts ; and even ft there are some of our sterner mistresses, avIio think senants are treated \" a deal too well \" in our oaaui country, and avIio may therefore see no particular enormity in the greater part of the regulations here cited, Ave would gently remind such houseAvives that \" the proof of the pudding ahvays lies in the eating ; \" and beg of them to contrast the account wre haA'e given of the habits and characters of the domestics in Saxony, Avith"], [433, "411 SAXON SERVANTS. those of our OAvn country. Let them ask themselves, moreoArer, Avhat is the reason of such a difference ? Let them bear in mind that in Eisenach, where the servants are treated, by the petty potato despots, as bond-slaves, or Anlleins, attached for a certain time to the houses of tlieir masters, the poor wretches naturally remain but little better than Anlleins and bond-slaves in habits and manners ; Avhereas, in our own country, where the relations between master and servant are left to conform to the natural action of the law of supply and demand, and the hiring is made a simple contract between individuals \u2014 rather than a thing to be settled by a thick-headed policeman's notion of what is good and right \u2014 masters and mistresses, by preferring to keep only such servants as are capable of conforming to their notions of decency and propriety, have been able to train up such a class of tidy and respectable attendants as are to be found in no other land. For go where you Avill on the face of the earth, there is nothing that impresses you Avith so high a sense of the decency and refinement of English hfe as the comely-looking and neatly-attired domestics common to the better form of middle-class people with us ; and compared wdth whom a Saxon gentleAvoman, Ave say again, is as a char- woman in the elegance of her appearance at home, and as an Irish basket-Avoman in the suaAnty of her manners.* * But these police books are ordained not alone for ser vants ; for every workman in Germany is obliged to be provided with one during his \"wandering\" term, which is a species of"], [434, "412 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. tramping enforced by law. For, though English artizans have long ago found out that this tramping system \u2014 which was origi- nally instituted by our different trade-societies for the purpose of equalizing the labour-markets throughout the country, has tended to make more beggars and idle sots out of honest, hard- working journeymen than any other practice (since it is but natural for sluggish natures to avoid work when they find that they can live by alms) \u2014 though such has been the case in our country, and the heads of the English trade-societies are conse- quently doing all they can to put an end to such a system, never- theless, in Saxony (where you find all the exploded absurdities and barbarisms of your forefathers still upheld, as though they were part of the laws of the Medes and Persians), you discover this system of vagabondage to be in full force up to the present day; and the laws positively compelling men, who have been just trained to live comparatively independent by some form of work, to go out into the highways and by-ways, and subsist on their journey by begging. Indeed, it is impossible to take a walk along any high-road outside a German town without meeting some two or three of these wretched, footsore Wanderburschen, with their scanty stock of clothes done up into a huge sausage- like roll and slung at their side. As you approach, the vaga- bonds according to law, are sure to halt, and touch their caps for a few groschens to help them on their way. In the towns, too, it is customary for them to call at the bakers and butchers and beg a bit of liver-sausage or bread, after the manner of professional English cadgers in the pro- vinces. This, in German slang, is called going fechten (literally, fencing). Now, it is part ofthe laws of the country that each of these wandering journeymen must continue this vagabond and mendicant form of life for three years at least ; and that they should carry during that time a police book, similar to that which the servants are compelled to retain, so that the workmen, like the menials, may be under the continual surveillance of the police \u2014 as though, as we said before, they were so many convicts out on tickets-of-leave, rather than persons living by their own honest labour.

The printed matter at the commencement of this book bears the title of \" Rules for the Wandering Handicraftsmen be longing to the Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar Eisenach,\" and runs as follows : \u2014 \" 1. Every handicraft journeyman born in the Grand Duchy, who, in order to seek for work, wishes to wander in the home provinces or abroad (im Inlande oder Auslande) must get a book from the municipal authorities of the town in which he has served his apprenticeship. \" 2. This Wanderbuch has the rules printed in the first and second leaves, and contains thirty-two leaves altogether, marked with printed numbers, such leaves being severally drawn through with a silken thread, whose ends are stamped with the town-seal, and thus fastened to the end of the book \u2014 so that any defacement of it is sure to be detected. \" 3. On the third leaf are printed the rules for the military service, which wandering journeymen are warned especially to attend to. \" 4. Upon the fourth leaf the municipal authorities arc to set down as follows : \u2014 a The name in full of the journeyman receiving the Wander- buch, and who has to subscribe his name thereto. b The day, month, and year of his birth. c The dwelling-place of his parents. d The description of handiwork he has learnt, together with the date of the commencement and end of his appren- ticeship, and likewise the name and place of abode of his master. e A statement as to the time during wliich he worked with the master at his apprenticeship, or any other master before the Wanderbuch was given out to him. And / The special remarks concerning the character of the jour- neyman as well as concerning the time at which he must return to fulfil his military duties, or concerning the reason why he has happened to come free of such service, &c. \"5. The personal description of the holder ofthe Wanderbuch"], [436, "414 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. is to be entered on the title-page, according to the directions there given, by tbe aforesaid official authority, and to be signed with his name. 14 6. The wandering journeyman is bound to have written down in his Wanderbuch, by the police authorities of the place, the length of time which he has worked at any master's or manufactory, either in the home provinces or abroad, since the giving out of the book to him, as well as the places where he has remained beyond one day \u2014 even without work \u2014 and likewise the account of his conduct while in such places. \" No alteration in the official remarks entered in the book dare be made, either by the possessor himself of the Wanderbuch or indirectly, through his connivance, by any other person, without special permission from the authorities ; unless the party would be found guilty of forgery, and on that account have to undergo the criminal pains and penalties of the prison-house. \" 7. Wandering to Switzerland, France, and Belgium is forbidden to every handicraft-workman who has not received the special permission of the police, under penalty that the transgression of this injunction, contrary to the orders of the police and the enforcement of good discipline, will be punished as soon as discovered by withholding the rights of mastership, as well as can celling the apprenticeship appertaining to the workman who may be guilty of it. (See further on.) \" 8. Those handicraftsmen who remain many years away from the home provinces are bound to give a credible account of their mode of life and place of residence before the expiration of ten years at the latest to their relatives, their guardians, or represen tatives, as well as to the authorities of their native place ; since, according to the laws of the Grand Duchy, the property of any one remaining out of the country beyond ten years, and omitting to announce his place of residence and cause of absence, will le given over, without any certainty of return, to the lawful heirs inquiring for him, immediately after sworn evidence has been given of the want of any information concerning the participator in the estate, and that he has been already publicly summoned to appear. \" Weimar, 2 b.

BEFORE MARRIAGE. Such things as marriages for love are almost utterly unknown in Saxony. True, the father there does not select, with the same sang firoid, the future husband for the girl, as is the wont in Earis, and bring home with him some fine afternoon a young or old gentleman, as the case may be, and introduce him to his daughter with the remark, \" Here, my child, I wish to present you to your future partner for life ; \" Avhile the obedient young lady curtseys, and thanks her father for the present, as if it were a new dress, or a small box of kid gloves, rather than a being Avith whom her fortunes are to be mixed up for the rest of her days. The consequence of such marital arrangements is patent to all the world ; the infidelity of French married women being proverbial in almost every nation. Now, we cannot say that precisely the same barbarous custom prevails in Thuringia ; nevertheless, A'OL. I. E E"], [440, "418 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. matrimony there is assuredly not the result of affec tion between the parties, and the homes are conse quently nothing like the happy united circles, marked by one common interest and feeling, as Avith the better middle-class families of England. The property possessed by girls for miles round the Thuringian capital is knoAvn to almost everyone of the citizens of the toAAm ; and during our residence in Eisenach, we never heard of one love-match occurring in the place. True, the Kantor (director of the church music), avIio was said to be so oA'ercome after the death of his first young Avife that he Avould never be able to hold up his head again, was engaged to be married immediately after the first anniversary of his former partner's funeral, to the daughter of a chancller's-shopkeeper who had \" gone to pieces\" in Hamburg. And this Avould seem to be an exception to the rule. \" But,\" said the gossips of the town, as they talked over the fitness of the betrothal in the httle haber dashers' shops, Avhere the women generally meet to buy Berlin wool and chatter scandal, \" leave Midler Hartung alone for marrying anybody unless he is to get something as good as money with her.\" \" Ay, they do say,\" cried one of the old maids in the shop, \" that he is going to Hamburg Avith his bride, and that her rich uncle has promised to get him a number of pupils in that city.\" \" Aye, and God knows,\" added another, \" he'll Avant a number of them, to keep such a proud penniless minx of a wife as he is about to take to himself.\""], [441, "BEFORE MARRIAGE. 419 As a further illustration of the universality of marriage either for money, or some worldly interest or other, we may mention the fact that, in the course of last year, immediately preceding the introduc tion of Gewerbe-freiheit (literally, \"free trade,\" but more particularly the abolition of the restrictions against free working in Eisenach), it was the com mon talk at the taverns among the different journey men, who then thought of starting in business on their OAvn account, as to which of the young women in the town had money enough to please them. \" Oh ! \" one would say, \" there is the butcher's daughter, the ' Great Globe ' (Welt-kugel) as she is called. She has got 1000 thalers at least.\" \"But, thundering Aveather ! \" said another, \" she Avalks with that soldier who belongs to her own trade.\" \"Well, then, there's Gyps Hanchen,\" (the latter name being short for Johanna, and the former the name of the girl's father ; for it is usual in Eisenach familiarly to describe the young women asBroAA'n's Eeggy,or Jones's Molly, or Eobinson's Sukey, as the case may be,) \"will she suit you?\" asks a third, \"for she's got her 500 thalers to bless you with.\" \" No,\" replies the other, \" she is a nice enough girl to look at, but it will cost me more than that to buy tools and wood, and furnish a place to begin with.\" \" Come noAV,\" cries another of the company, \" Avhat do you say to the Todten graber's (grave-digger's) daughter ? She has got enough to start a working goldsmith in business.\" \" Bfui ! devil ! \" exclaims the worthy C\u0153lebs, \" Heaven forbid ! I could never take a bride from the dead- e E 2"], [442, "420 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. house.\" \"Ha! ha!\" laugh the others. \"Hear Iioav nice he is in his notions. Why, it's only a matter of taste, man! (Gesehmack-sache Avas the phrase used) whether she lives at the \"dead-house or at the con fectioner's.\" Nor must the reader imagine that such sentiments as the aboAre are by any means limited to the lower orders of society. \" Who is that lady flirting so violently with the young officer yonder ? \" we said to a friend at one of the Klemda balls. \" Oh ! she is the Fraulein A'on Kemgros,\" Avas the reply ; \" and she has made love to every gentleman here for the last fifteen years. But, poor thing ! she will haA*e to cast sweet eyes (liebes-augen) for many a year more, before she catches a man, since she has not one pfenning of her oavii to bless any husband with.\" The tAvo principal heiresses of the toAvn were the claim-liters of the distiller and the one wholesale grocer of the place ; and these Avere spoken of as being wealthy beyond all conception, and regarded Avith the same reverence as if they were the gdt mud-idols of some Indian A'illage. For, as the German men informed you the one had no less than 40,000 thalers (6000/. sterling) and the other as much as 60,000 thalers (AA'hich is equivalent to 9000/. of our money), they were in the habit of staring at you to Avatch j'our wonderment, as if they thought you never before could have heard of any young women possessing such an amount of wealth."], [443, "BEFORE MARRIAGE. 421 Moreover, the ansAver to an inquiry as to whether such and such a man was Avell-to-do would often run, \" Oh yes ! he is uncommonly rich ; for he has been married three times, and always took care to have a \u25a0rood round sum with eA-erv one of his Avives.\" Indeed, as a rule in Thuringia no man ever dreams of making a fortune by his own industry or enter prise : the accredited means of acquiring wealth among the Saxons are the lottery and marriage, and as they gamble regularly in the one, so do they speculate uniformly in the other. Almost every unmarried male sets a price upon him self ; and one gentleman, Avith A'ery white teeth and an incipient bald head, was candid enough to inform us that he appraised himself at 7000 thalers, and would not think of walking with the prettiest girl in Creation if she possessed a groschen less than that sum. Indeed, almost eA'ery young person seems to start in hfe with a notion of making his way in the world, not by his own energies or prudence, but simply by getting hold of a girl with money. \" Oh ! I shall go to America or Eussia,\" you will hear them say, \" and then the daughter of some rich merchant or noble man will fall in love with me.\" And the mercenary wretches will cite you case after case, in which some countrymen of theirs has prospered by such means. All the time Ave Avere resident in Eisenach, Ave repeat, Ave never heard of one disinterested match ; but Ave kneAv of many unions Avhere the chief object"], [444, "422 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. was known to be, not the bride herself, but merely the means of taking a larger and a better shop, or of being able to go into some more extensive way of business. Where such is the prevailing fashion, the reader can Avithout much difficulty comprehend what must be the courtship, and how pleasant and loving the inter course of the married couples united principally by such sordid motives. In most cases, hoAvever, the property which a girl possesses in her own right, or is given to her by her parents on marriage, is settled on herself; and that so completely that it generally reverts to the family rather than remains AAdth her husband after her death. The landlord, for instance, of the Bath's keller, at Kreuzberg, married a miller's daughter, who was said to be worth a large sum. We hap pened to see the couple there, some few weeks before their wedding, cuddling (after the true German fashion) in the public beer-room ; and as the girl had somewhat of a prepossessing look, we could not help, some time after, inquiring of some of the Kreuzbergers, who came over to Eisenach on market days, as to whether she was happy, or not, in the choice she had made. \" 0 woe ! 0 woe ! \" was the answer ; \" the poor thing died five weeks after her wedding-dress was worn. So the landlord made a bad speculation there,\" they added ; \" for every pfenning he got with his bride will have to go back to the family, now that she is no more.\""], [445, "423 BEFORE MARRIAGE. Moreover, even AAdien there is little or no money in the family, it is often the custom of the parents of the bride to furnish the rooms of the young couple ; and, when this is done, the goods and chattels, in case of death, are expected to reA'ert to those who gave them. \"Aye, it will be a sad misfortune to the Kantor (the uxorious gentleman before referred to) this death of his young wife,\" ran through the town immediately after the news of the poor girl's decease was circulated, \" for his father-in-law may, if he please, strip his apart ments of every stick of furniture he has in the place.\" In such a state of things it Avill be readily under stood that there can be no such thing as one common interest, or one common feeling, pervading the several homes of Saxony. \" I have been obliged to pay so much for my man out of my money,\" you will hear one wife complain in public company; or it will be, \"My man owes me so much, and I can't get a Heller (the old name for the one-twelfth of a penny) from him ; \" or else, as our landlord was in the habit of saying to us, \" My wife has no business to come to you for the rent : this is my house, and let her look after the tenants hi her OAvn little mud-hovel in the Akkerhof; for that's all she ever brought me when I married her.\" Or, may be, on the other hand, the Frau Shabbyman tie Avill send another servde letter for the few groschens that is her due, urging that \" the money is her own, and that her husband is so stingy that she cannot get a pfenning from him for her girls' dresses for the balls.\""], [446, "424 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Further : not a feAv of the men lived entirely upon their Avives' industry. One Avas a small watchmaker, whose sole occiq.ation seemed to be to loll outside his shop in a dressing-goAAm and slippers, and smoke a long pipe in the middle of the day, and in the evening to betake himself to Fischbach to shoot at a target (for he belonged to the shooters' company of the town) ; while his wife was one of the principal milliners in the city, and therefore, as the people said, there was no necessity for him to work as hard as ordinary men. Another worthy, avIio was wont to saunter about the streets, smoking his cigar and dressed in a straw berry suit, with a deer-stalker's hat, was the husband of the midwife, and he too, we were assured, had no need to do anything. Indeed, were there any use in continuing such offensive details, avc could cite case after case hi which either the husband had derived his whole wealth from his one, two, or three wives at the time of marriage, or else that he Avas louting about, and ftving upon the industry of his \" frau \" for ever after. Let us now, after this brief introduction as to the motives which generally lead young people to come together in Saxony, proceed to describe, as faithfully as possible, what are the Thuringian customs during courtship. From what we have before said, as to the utter want of paternal supervision in Saxe-Weimar, it will be almost supererogatory to state, that young people are left in such matters to do as they please."], [447, "425 BEFORE MARRIAGE. \"What time did your daughter,\" said we, to a painter, \" come home from the ball Ave heard she was at last night ? \" \" Oh God ! \" exclaimed the callous old gentleman, \" I don't knoAV ; I Avas out at the Apple-Avine Eooms, and comfortably in my bed, long before she turned the key in the door.\" Accordingly, young people are left to pick up their mates at the concerts and balls of the town as they choose ; for we have before said, that even at the Edemda dances, we hardly ever saAv the father of a family there avIio thought it worth his AA'hile to forsake his beer-house for the moral supervision of his child ; and Ave have knoAvn fathers, aa*1io, when they heard that their daughters were in the habit of dancing at the Klemda, until their flounces were high above their knees, nevertheless, considered ft by no means Avorth their Avhile to accompany the young women to the ball as a safeguard to tlieir proper conduct. Certainly, it is customary for mothers to be present on such occasions ; but they go there, as we have before explained, rather as the hand maids to the young Avomen, ready to arrange their skirts when they become ruffled, and to hand them dry pocket-handkerchiefs and small -tooth combs whenever their personal appearance may stand in need of them. MoreoA*er, the poor old creatures are often too tired Avith the day's house- Avork, and the washing and ironing necessary for the preparation of the ball-clothes of the girls, to do other than doze and nod as they sit against the wall, after the first feAv dances of the evening. Again,"], [448, "426 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. such is the laxity of modesty among German elderly Avomen, that we doubt very much if these folk would, even with their eyes wide open, be vigilant guardians over the decent behaviour of any girl entrusted to their care. Further, even such poor protectors as these to a girl's virtue are often left at home, and the young women aUoAved to frequent balls and concerts without a single soul to look after them. Courtship, therefore, generaUy consists, in Thuringia, in meetings and secret interviews at some of the suburban beer-gardens round about the town ; for as servants with us are said to \"walk\" or \"keep company\" with their swains preAdous to marriage, this, so far as we could learn, Avas the only custom common in Eisenach, even among Avell-to-do folks, preliminary to the formal proposal for a young lady's hand. Such walks and meetings generally take place in the afternoon, when the father is at his business, or more probably at the beer-house, and the mother is left to the performance of those common household duties which are generally consigned to servants in England; Avhile the daughters go flaunting abroad, dressed in all their best, to keep a rendezvous with some scape-grace of a so-called noble forest-man unknown to theft parents. We neA'er, during our many years' residence in Germany, heard of any gentleman being received at the parents' house while such loA'e-making Avas going on ; and upon talking the matter over with our German friends, we were assured that such a custom was unknown in Thuringia. The girls were alloAved,"], [449, "427 BEFORE MARRIAGE. we were told, to go out at all times of the day, and even night, unprotected, Avithout hardly a question being asked as to whither they were going, previous to their departure ; or where they had been, or why they had remained so late, on their return. From this insight into the liberty that young women are allowed in Saxony, it would be idle to tell men of the world the consequences to which such utter Avant of proper parental control must necessarily lead \u2014 and especially in a country where the young laches have less sense of decency than women in the slips of a theatre with us, thinking it by no means indelicate to sit the night through at a concert Avith their lover's arm about their neck, or to hug and cuddle up to a young man in the public streets, in a manner that the females in the Haymarket would hardly dream of doing before midnight. Indeed, when Ave add, that the common attitude for the damsels frequenting the fashionable ball-room of the Klemda, while pausing between the dances, is to stand Avith their arms folded, and to look straight up into the eyes of their partner, as unabashed at the stedfast stare of the strange gentleman, as if they had been married to him for the last ten years \u2014 modest Englishwomen will readily understand, that such brazen-faced young laches are not likely to be particularly prudish in their behaAnour with gentle men when walking out alone with them in the woods, without an eye to observe, or a tongue to tell of their wanton practices. This secret and unguarded courtship continues"], [450, "428 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. until such time as the gentleman thinks it fit, or necessary, to make a formal proposal to the parents for his marriage AA'ith their daughter. This is seldom, or never clone, in Avriting. The gentleman goes in propria persona to the house of the father or mother, and tells the one or the other what his present income is, as Avell as Avhat his prospects are ; adding, \" that he wishes to be united to the young lady at such and such a time.\" To such a proposal, an immediate \" yea \" or \" nay \" is invariably given, it being con sidered an insult if the parent consulted asks for time to consider the matter ; for in a small town like Eisenach, where not only the means, but the ante cedents of every citizen are known to each other, it is obvious that hesitation implies dissent, and there fore such proposals are then and there assented or objected to. If the parents' consent be obtained, then a special feast is giA*en, equivalent to the Eoman \" Sponsalia \" to make knoAvn the formal betrothal of the couple. To the betrothal-supper, at which fish is a favour ite dish, all the friends and acquaintances of the family are usually invited, and in the course of the entertainment, the bridegroom, as he is then called (for in Germany such public betrothals are almost equivalent to marriage Avith us \u2014 the }'oung lad)* being spoken of as the gentleman's bride from that time forth), having previously ordered to be made two thick plain gold rings (indeed, the rings usual on such occasions are almost as clumsy as"], [451, "429 BEFORE MARRIAGE. curtain-rings with us) inside one of which is engraven his oavu name, and in the other that of the young lady \u2014 proceeds to place the ring Avith his name in scribed upon it on the bride's left forefinger, and that Avith the lady's name upon the forefinger of his own left hand. Sometimes these rings are placed upon the finger of the bride and bridegroom in the presence of the entire assembly invited to be parties to the contract. In Saxony, howeArer, it often occurs that the rings are placed on the fingers of the bride and bridegroom in the presence of the parents only, previous to the guests assembling ; and the betrothed couple then make their appearance at the table with the symbols of their engagement already upon their hands. At the feast the young couple sit together next to their parents, and an amount of public love making and kissing goes on through the evening which any decent English father or mother would hardly be able to countenance. In the course of the entertainment, after supper, when wine, grog, and punch are freely partaken of, the healths of the betrothed are drunk, \" with all the honours,\" \u2014 but speeches are seldom or never made ; and the bride groom in return, proposes a toast, wishing \" hap piness and long life \" to all those present on the occasion. Hard drinking then usually continues up to a late hour \u2014 generally till one or tAvo in the morning \u2014 the ladies sitting at the table till the very moment when the gentlemen retire ; for, as we have before"], [452, "430 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. said, it is considered by no means indehcate for women in Germany to be present with men in their \" cups,\" and Ave have already told the reader how, Avhen an officer made his appearance at one of the \" Klemda \" balls, in such a helpless state of in toxication that while Avaltzing he fell with his partner flat to the ground, this was, neA'ertheless, considered so slight an indignity offered to the ladies present, that he was neither expelled the club, nor did he find any difficulty afterwards in procuring partners Avhen ever he wished to dance. After the above formal ceremony of betrothal has been gone through, adA'ertisements are inserted in the local neAvspapers announcing the fact ; or else, may be, letters are printed and sent to the different friends and acquaintances of the young couple. At the same time, cards are struck off and despatched to friends at a distance, while visits are paid the next day by the \" happy pair \" to such as live in the immediate neigh bourhood. The cards usual upon such occasions are printed in the following fashion \u2014 the titles of the toAvns in the corner being added so as to show to Avhat district the parties respectively belong : \u2014 Anna K Carl I verldbte. Eisenach. Wetzlar."], [453, "BEFORE MARRIAGE. 431 Occasionally, at the time of betrothal, an Ehe-pacht, or marriage-contract, is entered into in writing, in which the property belonging to either party is settled upon them, and proAdsions made in case of the death of either, &c. Such marriage-contracts, however, are by no means usual unless the betrothed pair belong to the wealthier classes. In citizen life it is more common for the father to tell the bridegroom (either immedi ately before or after betrothal) that he wdll give his daughter so many hundred thalers for her marriage outfit, and that after his death so many thousand thalers more will come to her. But no legal settle ments among the middle classes are usually made. The general sum promised is. 100 thalers, or 15/., for the trousseau of the girl; the father, moreover, un dertaking'' to furnish the rooms for the bride and bridegroom. Indeed, the latter practice is so gene rally understood that no engagement is entered into upon the matter ; for, even among the very poor, it is customary for the bride to bring the beds and such furniture as can be spared at the time of marriage ; while, among the middle-class citizens, the father knows well that he is expected to supply all the fur niture necessary for providing the young couple with a home fitting their station in life. Such are the forms usually observed at the time of public betrothal in Saxony. There are, however, many betrothals of a secret nature. These occur sometimes with the sons or daughters of Avhat are called the \" beggar barons \" of the principality ; but"], [454, "432 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. in most cases they prevail Avith the \" Forest Practi tioners \" who come to study at the Forest College in Eisenach, and who enter into such compacts merely as a blind for closer familiarities with the young ladies who are foolish enough to place faith in them. On such occasions rings are exchanged as above described, but no feast is given ; and it often happens that the young \" noble \" has to wait some ten or a dozen weeks before he can raise the money to pay the jeweller of whom the golden tokens have been ordered. Occasionally, too (even with this secret form of betrothal), cards are printed ; \" But,\" said a knowing German friend of ours, \" a hundred cards cost only 1 thaler 10 groschens, and the rings but 3 to 4 thalers each ; and the Forest Practitioners, Avhen they can save up as much, do not care about the money, because after a girl is betrothed she Avill aUow a man to do as he pleases with her.\" In ordinary cases, betrothal is looked upon as almost equivalent to the marriage ceremony, and either party breaking it can be mulct in heavy damages. Of course, legal proceedings for breach of promise are oftener instituted by women than by men, as in our own country ; seeing that the weaker sex are the greater losers by the forfeiture of the engagement. In the course of last year, however, such a suit Avas instituted by a working-man in Eisenach, against a girl avIio had some httle property, but who had broken her engagement to be married to him; and the journej'inan recoA'ered 100 thalers as penalty against the damsel for her Avant of faith in"], [455, "433 BEFORE MARRIAGE. the matter. In the case of the Forest Practitioners, hoAvever, such proceedings are comparatively Avorth less; for as the young men are mostly strangers to the toAA'n, and come there to study for merely two or three years, they knoAV that Avhen they are far aAvay from the city no legal measures can be adopted against them ; and hence rings are exchanged and cards printed Avithout any fear of ulterior proceedings, so that the silly girls, avIio believe in such ceremonies, may be induced to give themselves up body and soul to the young scapegraces. As a German friend of ours truly said, \" If a man mean honourably to a girl, why should the betrothal be secret?

Forest Practitioners ; and how the girls were alloAved to remain there to hob-a-nob with these not-particularly-particular college students, Avithout father or mother to protect them, till nearly midnight. Who can wonder, then, that hot-blooded university youths, seeing the licences that Saxon parents give them Avith their daughters, do not hesitate to fool the VOL. i. ff"], [456, "434 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. young women to the top of theft bent ? or that the more decent and honest of the Eisenach citizens, knowing Iioav the girls have been tampered and played Avith by young men whom they and theft parents thought to entrap into a lucky marriage, do not hesi tate, when the college boy has flung the girl from him like a sucked orange, to cast the young woman aside, and to think her utterly unfit to make a virtuous AA'ife ? Such is the usual fate of the secret betrothals in Eisenach. The Shabby mantle girls were the precise type of the maidens who belong to that class which thinks itself too proud for citizen-company; and who are, consequently, for ever scheming to force themselves into the society of gentlefolks, to whom their servile manners are utterly unfitted \u2014 for ever making the cour after each petty beggar-baron as soon as he entered the forest school, and accordingly left to be betrothed every three years to a fresh bride groom ; until, at last, the name of the young women came to be a b}'e-word, among the more honourable citizen folk, for everything that was opprobrious and unfeminine. We have now dealt with the secret and public betrothals common in Thuringia and we have only to add that such things as runaway matches are utterly unknown in the land. \"But,\" said we to an astute German friend, \" suppose the parents object to the alliance \u2014 what, then, is the conse quence?\" \"Oh! then\" said he, \"the couple do not run away, but they play another game wliich"], [457, "BEFORE MARRIAGE. 435 soon makes the father or mother ready to hush the matter up in the most honourable manner they can.\" As a man of the world, the writer imme diately understood what was meant by the disgrace ful innuendo ; and it told him, moreover, how wofully lax was the paternal supervision of girls in Saxony, and how such things could occur only in a nation where young females were allowed to walk out alone as they pleased, while the father sotted in the beer house and the mother was scrubbing the floors at home. These betrothals last usually from two to three years. Sometimes the marriage takes place within six months after the public affiance of the couple ; but, on the other hand, it is in many cases delayed for ten years, or even longer, until the means of the bridegroom are sufficient to justify his entering into the matrimonial state. Immediately after betrothal the \" outward and visible \" conduct of the young lady towards the young gentleman is entirely changed. Before being affianced, a German girl thinks it extremely indecent to touch the ungloved hand of any young man, nor would she, for her hfe, be seen walking arm-in-arm with a gentleman unless she were known to be engaged to him. Indeed, to such an extent is this carried, that young German ladies who were in the habit of visiting at our house, thought it a great act of grace on their part to shake us by the hand on entering and quitting our roof, and told our daughter that they did so only in con- E F 2"], [458, "436 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. formity Avith English manners and customs ; adding that \" they could not for the life of them ever bring themselves to do the same thin.? to one of their oavii countrymen.\" At the same time, it is by no means unusual Avith the ladies who are acquainted with the manners of Austria to alloAv their hands to be kissed even by a perfect stranger shortly after their intro duction to a gentleman, and that Avithout the least reluctance being shown, or the faintest tinge of a blush suffusing their cheeks at the time. After betrothal, however, tout est change, and the young prude who was ashamed to touch the naked fingers of the gentleman a few days before, thinks it by no means unbecoming of her sex to appear in the public streets hanging on to his arm, and looking up into his eyes Avith an amount of lascivi ousness that could only be witnessed at the Picca dilly Saloon in England ; or else to sit the evening through at some concert or theatrical performance with her lover's arm twined around her neck, and each engaged in such amorous dalliance as even cats would hesitate to perform in public. Upon such matters Germans have no sense of decency whatever. When Ave were living in Coblenz we have seen betrothed couples kissing in front of the shops of jewellers and printsellers, and we have known a gentleman sit in a room Avith his betrothed upon his knee \u2014 both utterly unabashed Avhen strangers entered the apartment. But such indecorous habits are con sidered by no means unfeminine in educated Ger many ; although assuredly the very poorest Irish"], [459, "BEFORE MARRIAGE. 437 girls in our oavii country would \" shame themselves \" \u2014 to use a German phrase \u2014 to be detected in any such public love-making with their sweethearts. The Germans, indeed, as Ave have said elseAvhere, seem to have no sense of such feelings as secret emotions. But why, it may be asked, should people be so ashamed of being in love AAdth one another, that they should retire into solitude to give vent to their affections ? We answer that all deep emotions are necessarily secret ones. Not only does an absorbing passion OA'erpower the mind, so as to unfit it for social converse, but the heart instinctively knows that it cannot expect sympathy from Avhat, in such cases, is truly enough called the \" unfeeling Avorld ; \" since the very profundity of its emotion cannot but appear absurd to those who are engaged in the active business of life. It is thus in profound grief. No person thinks of making his tears public ; and, indeed, he cannot help feeling ashamed that he is susceptible of beinss overAvhelmed by his affliction. Hence, it is the custom for persons in extreme sorrow to shut up their house, and refuse to see all but those who can participate in their miseiy. In states of profound Areneration, again : how secret and silent is the worship that fills the heart ! It is for this reason that the early devotees built their altars in the recesses of forests ; for who has ever entered the reverend solitude of a dense avoocI, or stood alone at night peering far into the starry"], [460, "438 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. mysteries of space, and not experienced a feeling of adoration steal over his entire soul, as if it were congenial to the very stillness of the scene or time ? Indeed, we might run over eA'ery profound emotion of Avhich humanity is susceptible, and show that when ever the heart is deeply touched, the being withdraws from the public gaze, as if conscious that he and the mere money-hunting community haA'e nothing in com mon. Be assured, therefore, that when men publish their grief, or their religious sentiments, or indeed their love, they really feel little of any such emotions. But, if this public love-making in Germany be hateful, as eAddencing no real affection betiveen the couples, it is at the same time positively loathsome, on account of its violation of all the rules of social decency. Love, in its spiritual quality, is beautiful enough, but when it has the least animal taint with it, the exhibition of the passion becomes \u2014 hke the gratifica tion of any inordinate appetite \u2014 grossly offensive for other persons to contemplate. In the intensity of the desire, Nature, to the enamoured pair, throws an exquisite A*eil over the animal character of the passion itself; but still, a decent-minded man, and, much more, a modest-natured woman, would blush to indulge in any amorous display in the presence of others. Surely there is hardly any difference between public women, and those avIio indulge in public love making ; for is it not the publicitg \u2014 the shamelessness of such creatures \u2014 the unblushingness, indeed, with"], [461, "BEFORE MARRIAGE. 439 which they allow themselves to be fondled and caressed before others, that offends our moral sense ? Never theless, this public indulgence in acts, that eA'en in the most degraded forms of savage life are performed in privacy, do not offer any A'iolence to the common notions of propriety in Germany ; though if in the \" upper boxes \" of our theatres such scenes occurred, as are every day carried on betAveen betrothed couples in Deutschland, the police would consider it necessary, for public morals, to remove the offending parties from public view. And yet German parents will permit their daughters to be treated like wantons under tlieir very eyes, Avithout hinting to the girl that it is only brazen-faced vice which can bear to be hugged before others, Avithout a blush crimsoning the cheeks."], [462, "CHAPTEE II.

In the first place, be it recorded, that no man can marry until he is four-and-twenty years of age ; and even then, if he be a workman, he must petition the Town Council for permission so to do, and be able to show that he is engaged by such and such a master, and has every chance of continuing' in his 7 J CT employment. Or if he Avishes to take unto himself a wife from any of the neighbouring villages, he can only do so by obtaining the permission of the toAvn authorities, and paying, moreover, some 30 thalers (4/. 19s.) for the purchase of the lady's freedom of the city.

Tavo thalers (6s.) for tuning the organ, six groschens seven pfennings (7hl.) to the organist, two thalers (6s.) towards the support of the town band, and twelve groschens six pfennings (lS^d) for \"tree money,\" that is to say, for keeping in order the feAv trees growing \"within the Avails.\" These charges sound very much like impositions to an English man ; for AA-hy newly- married couples should be made to bear the expense of the city arboriculture, and to contribute so largely towards the maintenance of the city band, seeing that this band never pla}*s at weddings ; and why they should have to pay so heavily for tuning the church organ, is more than common sense can understand. * Tbe literal translation of the above is as follows: \u2014 (9.) Petition of the Building-Inspector Moder for the recep tion of his betrothed into the community of Eisenach. (10.) Petition of the day-labourer Hermann Kesselring, of this town, to be pardoned from the taxes due to the town on his marrying again. (15.)

Moreover, if the Benedict be not already a citizen of the town, he must, before obtaining the permission of the municipal authorities to marry, take out his Bu/ger-sehein (certificate of citizenship), and for this he must pay 60 thalers, and prove, besides, that he is the owner of at least 500 dollars' worth of property. Up to the year 1848, marriage in Thuringia was a solely clerical affair ; but since the revolution, the chief power of permitting or forbidding unions is vested in the State, so that now the clergyman has no longer the power of refusing to wed any persons who come to him provided Avith the requisite State papers, as Avell as the consent of the parents on either side. Moreover, in the Toavu Council, the power is now vested of prohibiting such marriages as are thought to be impolitic for ethnological reasons. In the first place, people of Aveak minds or of imbecile nature can be prevented by the municipal authorities from entering into the matrimonial state. So, Ave were assured by many, the town officials had the power of forbidding the union of the deaf and dumb; others, on the contrary, as strongly declared that they had no right to withhold a marriage licence from such people. We can only add that the deaf and dumb persons whom we knew in Eisenach were all single, and we ahvays heard that the State com pelled them to remain so. On the other hand, the city laws offered no impediment to the union of the blind, the crippled, or the consumptive \u2014 the only persons, indeed, with whose marriage the State thinks it necessary to interfere, beyond the idiots and others"], [465, "443 MARRIAGE CUSTOMS. above mentioned, being working men, military officers, and common soldiers. But these, \" the powers that be \" still delight to treat as children incapable of thinking and acting for themselves. Time was when the custom prevailed in Ger many for the herald of the Emperor to blow his trumpet in the market-place, and announce to the folk there assembled that his Serene Majesty had been graciously pleased to give his consent to the alliance of Herr Miiller with Fraulein Scliulz. But though such things haA'e long passed away from the land, the equally-absurd practice con tinues of forcing eA'ery working man to remain single (and consequently to beget as many illegiti mate children as he pleases) until he can prove to the town authorities that he can support a family. The same restrictions, too, as are imposed upon the marriage of working men, likewise hold good against \" officers and gentlemen,\" it being impossible for a lieutenant in the army to take a Avife unto himself, unless she is possessed of 6000 thalers (\u00a3900) in hard cash \u2014 an amount of capital which, at the rate of 5 per cent, interest, would give 45/. the year ! for the support of the lady and her family. The chief absurdity, hoAveArer, in connection with this part of the marriage restrictions imposed by the State, re mains to be told. If the bride elect of the officer be a Von, that is to say, a lady of noble family, then money may be entirely dispensed AAdth ; though surely it must be obvious to anyone Avith a brain bigger than a walnut, that in such a case the"], [466, "444 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. sole reason for any money at all being required, viz., that the officer may be enabled to live according to his station, as well after marriage as before, becomes doubly enforced; since the \" gracious lady \" is likely to be a person of more expensive habits, and to require greater state and ceremony than the daugh ter of a simple citizen. It is presumed, hoAveArer, by the obsequious State-functionaries that the daughter of a baron is sure to be possessed of means sufficient for the support of her husband ; but in a hind where it is known that the greater part of the barons are \" beggars,\" as the German folk delight to call them, with hardly the income of a master chim ney-sweeper with us, this remission of the 6000 thalers required in other cases, is a bit of toadyism to the pedlar aristocracy of Saxony that is quite of a piece with the institutions of the land. Of the under, or non-commissioned, officers in the army, only fh-e of the oldest out of every 250 of the sergeants and quartermasters are permitted to enter into the matrimonial state ; Avhilst the common soldiers are utterly forbidden such an indulgence. The consequent state of immorality among the females in the garrison toAvns is far lower even than it is with us, especially as no brothels are aUoAved ; so that every decent Avorking-girl is lest by the State at the mercy of the soldiers, to be debauched by them before she is out of her teens. One other legal restriction concerning marriage, and we have done Avith the political control exercised over the subject. The usual time of mourning for a"], [467, "445 MARRIAGE CUSTOMS. deceased AAdfe in Saxony is twelve months, which is knoAvn by the name of the Trauer-jahr. Sometimes, however, a widower wishes to put an end to his suppo sititious grief before the allotted term, and to become once more a Benedict \u2014 the incorrigible ! Maybe, as AA*e were told, he has a large family or an ex tensive business, and requires some trustworthy female to look after the one or the other (without any regular salary) ; in such a case he has merely to send a petition to the so-called Ministeriu/n at Weimar, and if the jacks-in-office there think the circumstances are such as to justify a termination of the mourning, and to warrant the reArehy of another Avedding, then the happy-miserable wretch Avith the large family, or the large business, receives permission to take unto himself some new nurse or shopwoman in the cheapest possible manner, i. e. by marrying the lady, and so getting rid of her AArages. We noAV come to deal wd_h the ecclesiastical rather than the political restrictions to marriage in Thurin gia; and it will be seen that if the stupid State authorities must and will meddle with matters in AA'hich they haA'e no moral nor social right to inter fere, the Church ordinations, on the other hand, arc so lax that the regulations cannot but appear more fit for the communion of the sexes among unthinking animal life than rational beings. We all knoAV Iioav many years the fight has gone on in our oavu country in order to legalize marriage Avith a deceased Avife's sister. In Germany, hoAveA'er, not"], [468, "446 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. only is such intercourse considered in no way objec tionable, but the Church even permits nieces to marry with their uncles, and nepheAvs Avith tlieir aunts. \" Would you,\" said we to a German friend, \" permit the marriage of a man with his own step mother? or of a girl with her step-father?\" \" Ja wold,\" was the aiiSAA*er, \" and why not ? They are in no AA*ay related one to the other.\" \" Then, perhaps, a man may marry his mother-in-law, if he be so inclined?\" \" Gcwiss, he can,\" was the answer, \"and a girl her own father-in-law or brother-in-law when she has the mind.\" \" Well, then,\" urged we, \" is it forbidden hi your country for a man to Aved Avith his own grandmother?\" The gentleman was somewhat in doubt as to the latter point, though he candidly confessed to us that he did not see any reason why a person should not be allowed to do so, if the lady were only young enough and had sufficient money to make the match agreeable. Nor is the insensibility upon such matters confined solely to the male sex in Thuringia. A young lady, who was the daughter of one of the Govern ment officials, told us, AA'ithout a blush upon her cheeks, that she herself wanted to ha\\re married her mother's own brother, only, unfortunately, he had betrothed himself at an after period to a girl in Weimar. Whereupon we coidd not help asking her Avhy, if there Avas no objection to ladies marrying with theft mother's brother, should not brothers and sisters be permitted to unite themselves ? \" Oh, no ! \" Ave were told, \" that was quite a different"], [469, "447 MARRIAGE CUSTOMS. matter;\" and so astonished were the laches of the toAvn Avhen they heard that English people objected to the marriage of uncles with their nieces, that it was the talk among the female members of the fashionable singing-club for many an evening aster wards, and cases upon cases were cited to the members of our family to prove hoAV common was the custom in Thuringia. We must confess that the marriages of first cousins are by no means palatable to om minds ; for even if we had no moral scruples on the matter, there are certain physiological facts in connection with such unions Avhich we think would induce any decent or sensible person to deprecate them. Of the defects of such interbreeding, the people of Eisenach are, indeed, a notable example. We have before said that in the Thuringiaii capital almost every person is connected by marriage, each being some first or second coushi of the other ; and a more stunted, impotent, and effete race it is hardly possible to see on the face of the earth. Almost every woman, no matter what her station may be, has a goitre on her neck. A very large proportion of the people che, generation after generation, of consumption ; the chddren are to a great extent subject to rickets and soft bones ; girls invariably suffer from chlorosis, or Bleich-sucht, as the Germans call it; hardly a young woman has a tooth in her head ; cripples and cretins abound almost as thickly as in some of the unhealthy Swiss valleys; and lastly, the common soldiers of the army are hardly bigger than the"], [470, "448 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. boys of the Shoeblack Brigade with us \u2014 5 ft.

Such a race may, perhaps, in a great measure, be due to long generations of bad housing and bad feeding, such as Ave have before described ; stiU, the utter Avant of \\dgour and stamina on the part of the men, as Avell as of health and beauty on the part of the Avomen, are assuredly, more or less, referable to their continually intermarrying, and so propagating, and diffusing, the diseases Avhich at first appear in the Aveaker portion of the race ; for the infu sion of neAv blood into a family is knoAvn to be as necessary for the continuance of the organic poA\\*ers in their normal strength and health among human beings as it is among animals themselves. A girl may marry at any age, as soon as possible, indeed, after confirmation ; but, as Ave have before said, no man can enter into the matrimonial state in Thu ringia until he has attained his twenty-fourth year, Avithout a special \" dispensation,\" as it is called, from Weimar ; but if a damsel be possessed of considerable property, it is by no means unusual for the child to have a husband before she is fifteen.

For every person is bound by law to have his chimney swept by the city sweep once every three months, and as there are 1250 houses in the town, and at least three times that number of apartments \u2014 for every house, as we have said before, is let out in floors, and even in half and quarter ditto \u2014 it follows that the city chimney-sweeper would have an income of 1000 thalers per annum at least (including the outskirts), or as much as is allowed to the Chief Judge of the Court of Assizes ; since the average sum which every occupier of a \" flat \" has to pay may be taken at 5 groschens or 15 sgr. for the entire house perann. (We ourselves had to give 7^ groschens every quarter for the cleansing of our flues.) However, as we were saying, during our residence in Eisenach, one of the sons of this same wealthy chimney-sweeper was married\u2014 by the bye, the Saxon \" chum mies \" too are the only persons who wear hats in the town at all VOL.

These banns are published generally thrice in the church ; by paying an extra fee, hoAvever, those parties who are in a particidar hurry can be asked once for all (ein mal fiir alle mal). The marriage can also be performed at the house of the parties \u2014 of course upon an extra douceur being given to the clergyman ; but special licences, such as are known with us, are indulgences not yet introduced into Germany. It is a peculiar custom in Saxony, we have said, that the property of the wife, in case of her death without children, invariably returns to the family. This is part of the laws of the country, and it is in no way usual for the relatives of the deceased wife to forego them. Indeed, so generaUy is this understood, that legal settlements prerious to marriage are by no means customary. As times \u2014 the citizens delighting to sport such articles only on Sundays and holidays. But we are growing as discursive as Lawrence Sterne. Well, we repeat, one of the sons of this same chimney-sweeper became a Benedict, and the clergy man, while publishing the banns previous to the marriage ceremony, described the bride-elect as \" ledig,\" or single; whereat the Hof -und- Stadt- Privilegirte Schornsteinfeger (for Heaven's sake let us give the darkie all his titles, after the true German fashion) was exceedingly irate, and vowed that he would have the lady described as a \" Jungfrau\" or maiden. We know not how the quarrel between the two gentlemen in black ended, or whether the clergyman forced the Pamoneur to take the customary oath previous to a lady being called out as a Jungfrau in church ; or, indeed, whether the master-sweep had to pay the fine generally imposed upon husbands when their brides are so described bv them and their first child is born within six months after marriage."], [473, "451 MARRIAGE CUSTOMS. a rule, the husband brings nothing at the time of matrimony ; he may have a business or a situation, but property is seldom or never expected on his part ; for this, and indeed, the very furniture and beds of the apartments in whicli the couple are to live, he looks to his bride, such being the ordinary induce ments with gentlemen to enter into matrimony in Saxony. The interest of the money belonging to the bride goes to the husband, even during her lifetime, and over this he has as full and entire a control as if the capital belonged to him. But, in case of the lady's death after having given birth to one or more chddren, the money is then divided equally among the husband and the sons and daughters who are left behind. We have before spoken of the individual interests which such an arrangement creates in a household where, according to good old English notions, there should be but one common feeling, and one general purse ; for women bringing such wealth to their hus bands, and knoAving that the State recognizes ft as being exclusively their own, naturally get to consider their property as distinct from the man's, and hence, marriage sinks into something very hke the indecency and selfishness of cohabitation. \" Oh ! \" the under-burgomaster's -wife -will say to you, \" I lent my husband so many groschens last week for his tobacco, and when I shall get it from him again, Heaven only knows.\" In case the girl has no property of her own, then it is customary with the bridegroom to consult his g g 2"], [474, "452 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. future father-in-law as to Avhat sum of money he is to expect from him at the time of marriage. On such occasions it is usual in citizen life for the parents of the young woman to tell the bridegroom that he can expect nothing from them until the property is divided among their children, with the exception may-be of 100 to 300 thalers . 1 ol. \u2014 45/.), by way of outfit \u2014 the latter amount being considered a liberal sum, Avith the ordinary Kauf-leute (chandler's-shopkeepers) or master tradesmen in the town. \" But,\" said we to the friends whom we consulted on such matters, \" Avhat do gentlefolks generally give at such times ?\" \"Give ! \" was echoed with an indignant laugh, \" why, they have nothing to bestoAv.\" But we reminded our friend that the daughter of the President of the Assizes was married whde we were lhdng in Eisenach, and surely she must have had something as her dower. \" Ach gar ! \" was the contemptuous answer ; \" the rich manufacturers\" (those whom we have before described as carrying on their works in the loAvest-possible description of mud-hovels, and as paying the Avorst wages, and haA'ing the least care of tlieir workpeople in the whole city) \u2014 \"the Geizhals gave the girl her outfit because they thought it better to curry favour with the Judge.\" Nevertheless, we persisted, there was the young officer Avith the big eyes, who Avas married to the Colonel's daughter. \"What has a Colonel here to give to his child?\" was the answer; \"Bah! the junior lieutenant thought of getting his captaincy, and that was enough for him.\""], [475, "453 MARRIAGE CUSTOMS. Such, we believe, is a true account of the expec tations and inducements Avith regard to marriage among the different classes in the Thuringian capital. Still, there were some points that Ave ourselves required to have cleared up. So Ave consulted our friends once more as to the solution of certain marital mysteries that needed explanation. \" If,\" said we, \" it is the rule here that, in case of the death of the wife, the property she brought returns to the members of her family, how came it that old Brandt, the dry salter, avIio died so rich the other day, got the greater part of his money by marrying three times \u2014 as the story runs?\" \"That is true,\" Avas the answer, \"but he Avas clever enough to marry three old maids who were sisters, and as fast as one of them died he wedded another of the family, to whom his previous Avife's property had gone, and so he ultimately got it all to himself.\" \" There is one other difficidty we cannot get over ;\" we added, \" and that is, how came it that the Kantor of the Chinch, Avhen he lost his young Avife, Avithin a year of their marriage, was alloAved to retain the furniture and beds with Avhich his father-in-law had stocked his rooms?\" \"Oh! that is very simple,\" ran the reply; \"for though the father-in-law did not take them back at first, he no sooner heard that the man Avas about to be publicly betrothed again immediately the ' mourning year ' was at an end, than he sent and stripped the rooms, and left him only a few necessary articles in the place.\" \"Is it then laAV,\" said we, \"or merely custom"], [476, "454 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. that the Avife should bring the beds and furniture Avith her ? \" \" It is merely customary that she should bring them, and legal that the father has the power of re claiming them as soon as he pleases after the decease of his daughter. But even the custom of the bride bringing such things with her is so invariable, that if the law enforced it, it could not be more strictly observed,\" continued our informants ; \" for the very poorest people in the land would rather leave themselves without a stick in their homes than that their daughter should marry without being able to take, at least, a bed and a few things with her.\" In the olden times it wras usual for the girls in Germany to begin spinning the hnen that was to serve them as an outfit at the time of marriage, almost as soon as they Avent to school, and to continue doing so up to the period of their wedding ; so that large carved and painted chests came to be stocked with all kinds, and no end of under-clothing, as well as with stockings and other knitted articles ; for but a few years ago, OAving to the custom of washing but once or twice a-year in each famdy, a much larger stock of clothes was required than is found necessary at the present day. And such is the force of habit that we heard of many matrons in Eisenach who could count their stockings by the hundred, and theft chemises by the score. Moreover, in the Ehenish provinces, and other parts of Germany, we happen to know that these same marriage chests still continue to be stocked, for the"], [477, "MARRIAGE CUSTOMS. 455 young girls still go on spinning and knitting against their marriage day, as every German girl was wont in the time of yore. In Eisenach, hoAvever, we were assured the young ladies had got to be too lazy and fashionable to pursue such work, and now the mothers are left to do ft for them ; and this is the reason why you hardly ever go to a concert, a theatre, or a beer-garden in Thu ringia Avithout seeing the old women knitting away as mechanically as if they Avere so many stocking looms ; while the young ones are flirting and pre tending to be busy Avith some trumpery \" crochet work\" or \"tatting.\" We now come to the marriage-feasts and ceremonies themselves. On the evening before the marriage, there is a peculiar feast held \u2014 the nuptial eve in Germany, being styled the Bolter-Abend, the literal meaning of which is the \" noisy evening,\" from the verb poltem, to make a noise, or bluster. The Avord Bolter-hammer also means a lumber-chamber, and as it is customary for the toAvn'sfolk to get rid of all their old broken crockery on such occasions, the term Bolter, as applied to this strange ceremony, may have some such significance. Stripped of the symbolical riot Avhich goes on outside the doors, the feast given Avithin is merely the arch\u00e6ological remains of the old Eoman entertainment given on the night before the nuptials ; for it is still the custom in Germany for the bridesmaids to bring the myrtle -wreath, Avhich they have subscribed together to purchase, to the house"], [478, "456 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. of the bride, and to present her with it on that occasion. A feast usually accompanies this ceremony, to Avhich all the friends and relatives are invited. At one of the grander entertainments of this kind, Avhich occurred during our stay in the Thuringian capital, tableaux were enacted, in Avhich the ladies and gentlemen forming part of the company represented the \" four seasons.\" Another part of the festivities consisted in the recitation of certain Arerses eulogistic of the bride, who was one of the foremost members of the Sing Verein, and thought to be a small Jenny Lind in her way. These verses were delivered by one of the officers duly costumed as a bird-catcher, Avith cages dangling from his shoulder ; and advanc ing toAvards the bridegroom he reproached him, in the most sentimental rhymes, for \" carrying off their sweetest rnghtinsrale from the to*wn.\" The feast itself generally consists of fresh-water fish \u2014 sausages, of course \u2014 baked goose and hare stuffed AAnth onions (if such luxuries can be obtained), or else of beefsteaks and baked A'eal AAdth Sauer-kraut or salad \u2014 raw salt herrings and raw ham \u2014 as well as apple or cream-tart or \" sand-cake\"\u2014 together with \" bowls\" of sweetened wine, or of hot egg- punch, or glasses of hot grog, after the usual fashion of the most elegant entertainments hi the Thuringian capital. Minor feasts of the same character are someAvhat similar to the above, Avith the exception of being cur tailed of the more expensive articles, and they are, one and all, prolonged till a late horn- in the morning - \u2014 the ladies remaining with the gentlemen all the"], [479, "457 MARRIAGE CUSTOMS. Avhile, and hob-a-nobbing Avith them, until intoxication is the rule, and decency and sobriety merely the ex ception \u2014 after the fashion of \" cock and hen clubs \" among the lowest class of society in London. While this feast is going on inside the house, a greater riot, if possible, is being kept up in the street outside of it; for soon after midnight it is the custom of the toAvn'sfolk on these Bolter-abends to bring out all the old broken crockery, pots and pans, they can collect, and to throw them one after another at the door. The noise thus made by the smashing of the several articles, is considered to be prophetic as well as symbolical of the disturbances hkely to ensue between the couple in after-life. So general is this practice on the nuptial eve, that the heap of broken crockery often extends half across the street before the morning, and two or three wagons are sometimes required to carry away the fragments. Indeed, on one occasion, when a drunken sadler master, who bore one of the worst characters in the city, was about to be united, the whole of the citizens turned out, each with something to cast (and that not of the cleanhest character) against the door of the bride \u2014 for we should mention that such feasts are always given by the relatives of the girl. Nor did the citizens cease until the portals were broken open, and the thoroughfare completely blocked up Avith the shattered missiles. Other persons, who have a spite against either of the parties about to be wedded, delight in hanging a straw wreath upon the handle of the street-door, or else"], [480, "458 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. in strewing chaff along the way from the bride's house to the church \u2014 for such acts are considered as tokens that the lady is no better than she should be, and that it would have been more honourable for both parties if the wedding had taken place several months before. These straw wreaths are by no means un frequent in a town hke Eisenach; nor is it considered to be a wonder, or even much of a disgrace there, if a daughter is old enough to act as bridesmaid at her own father and mother's wredding ; as was the case, indeed, when the Forest-man, who keeps the tavern at the top of the mountain called the Hohe Sonne (High Sun), Avas recently united to the landlady of that hostelry. On the morning, or the evening, after the \" Poster Abend \" the Avedding itself takes place \u2014 the morning being the fashionable time, and the afternoon the time more usual Avith the citizens, for such cere monies. PreAnous to the hour fixed for the wedding, the space immediately in front of the altar is covered Avi th tall green shrubs, and the floor strewn with fresh flowers, Avhich are arranged into patterns all the way to the principal entrance. At the same time, the richer friends send whatever plate they may happen to possess \u2014 the borrowed silver articles being one and all set out so as to make as great a show as possible on the communion-table itself. Moreover, the one extremely wealthy friend who happens to possess a strip of carpet, as big as a hearthrug, (for we have before said that sanded floors prevail in the houses of"], [481, "459 MARRIAGE CUSTOMS. the gentry, as in English tap-rooms,) generally con tributes such a luxury, and this is laid down on the spot where the bride and bridegroom are to stand, and has very much the appearance of the narrow strip of Kidderminster, which it is customary to spread beside an English servant's bedstead. The costumes usual upon such occasions with the rich are low-necked ball-dresses and dance-wreaths for the bridesmaids \u2014 such ball-chesses being made of muslin, net, or tarlatan, and of the showiest possible colours ; while the bride generally makes her appearance in a flimsy Avhite silk, with a broad strip of white net streaming down from the back of her myrtle wreath. With the middle class, however, it is usual for the bride to be married in black silk, while the brides maids are attired in low-necked ball-chesses made of cotton print. The ceremony itself is of the briefest possible description, the service-proper consisting merely in the clergyman asking each of the parties whether they intend to take the other for his, or her, wedded partner for life ; then the betrothal rings are exchanged, and the religious part of the ceremony ends with the cm-test prayer for the happiness of the couple. The remainder of the rites are more of a moral and social, rather than an ecclesias tical character, consisting merely of an unimpressive speech from the clergyman in Avhich he, in the tritest possible platitudes mixed Avith a strong dash of sidy sentimentahsm, points out to the lady and gentleman the advantages of living happily and comfortably"], [482, "460 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. together, and descants at greater or less length upon the beauty and virtues of the bride, according to the amount of the fee he has received for so doing. For a douceur of twenty groschens, the oration lasts but five minutes, AA-hilst if the gratuity reach to the amount of two thalers, the leaden materials of the discourse are hammered out, so as to spread over very nearly half an hour. In addition to the latter fee, the clergyman is often invited to the wedding break fast ; at which, say the Germans, he generally eats enough to last him for six weeks at least. The marriage rites concluded, the happy couple, and the groomsmen and bridesmaids, as Avell as the rela tiA*es and friends present on the occasion, return in open carriages, festooned with oak garlands, through the toAvn \u2014 the ladies without any other covering than the wreaths on their head \u2014 to the house of the bride's father, where another feast ensues. This usually consists of coffee and cake at first, after which wine and sandwiches and herring salads, &c, are served ; Avhilst towards the evening a \" grand supper \" (though consisting of the coarsest-possible materials to Enghsh minds) is proAdded, and the feast continues Avith the usual accompaniments of drinking and drunkenness as before described. As the clock strikes tAvelve at midnight, the most peculiar part of the entertainment takes place. Then tAvo of the bridesmaids take the Avreath from the bride's head, and the sprig of myrtle from the button hole of the bridegroom ; after which a handkerchief"], [483, "461 MARRIAGE CUSTOMS. is tied over the eyes of the newly-married lady, and when her own myrtle wreath has been placed in her hand, the unmarried girls proceed to dance round her in a circle, Avhile she tries to place the garland upon the head of one of the damsels skipping about her. Whoever may happen to have the wreath placed on her head is, as the behef runs, certain to be married within a year from that date. The same kind of ceremony goes on AAnth the bridegroom, and Avhile the single folk are dancing, the rest of the party sing the folio Aving to the aft of the \" Bridesmaid's Chorus\" in \" Der Freischutz.\" 9_Bii l.in.en Tit ecn Sungfcaucn \u00c6ianj SScit Bcildjcn Matter Seibe, 2Bii- fiiln'cn _>icf; ju Spiel imt> 'Jan.

Wlien the dance and song are finished, a Avhite muslin cap, which has been made by the bridesmaids expressly for the occasion, is placed upon the newly married lady's head as a sign that she is now a dame ; while the gentlemen proceed to cover the head of the bridegroom with an ordinary white cotton nightcap that has a tassel at the crown of it, and which elegant article is commonly known in Germany by a name we cannot mention here. This part of the ceremony being ended, the com pany all seat themselves again, and the drinking"], [484, "462 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. and jesting go on as before. In a few minutes, however, one of the gentlemen disappears quietly under the table and removes a garter from the leg of everyone of the laches present, it being the custom with the damsels on such occasions to wear bright ribbons expressly for this part of the ceremony. The ribbon garters are then handed up above the table and cut into small pieces for each of the gentlemen to wear at his button-hole, hke the decoration of the \" Legion of Honour.\" Nor must English people, who would hardly be lieve that such an obscene custom could exist among civilized folk at the present day, imagine that this part of the bridal festivities prevails only among the coarser grades of people. On the contrary it is practised at the entertainments even of the wealthier classes, and indeed the ancient custom is not omitted at the wedding of royal personages in Germany. In the course of the same entertainment, moreover, three plates are carried round among the company \u2014 on the first of which is placed some salt and a piece of burnt linen. This is intended as another coarse kind of joke, to intimate that the cook has scorched her chemise while dressing the supper, and requests a trifle from the company towards the purchase of a new one ; whereupon eA^eryone of the gentlemen usually contributes a five-groschen piece as the plate is handed to him. The second of these plates is for the Currend scholar who usually attends with his box at such parties, and sings to the guests some well-known"], [485, "463 MARRIAGE CUSTOMS. hymn, such as Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott, in which the whole assembly join. And when the chant is ended, the Currend plate is sent round, while the lad is feasted with cake and wine as the five-groschen pieces drop into it. The third, and last, plate into which the company are expected to place some small silver coin has a few tooth-picks in the middle of it, as a sign that the collection is intended for the waiter. \" Moreover,\" said the simple German friend to whom we are in debted for much information in connection with such matters, \" everybody is expected to bring some present to the house on the wedding-day ; and therefore people like much more now-a-days to go to christen ing parties, for then only the godfathers and god mothers have to give anything, and weddings every body says cost a great deal too much for a citizen to take part in them very often.\" The wedding presents here spoken of generally consist of either jewellery or household articles, such as cups and saucers, clocks, or, indeed, even pots and pans and flat-irons. Another of the coarse jokes prevalent at such times is to present the newly-married lady with the figure of a stork (for this bird in Thuringia is said to be the bearer of little children), the figures being made either out of sugar-stuff, porcelain, or even wood, and the bird being generally represented either Avith a baby dangling from his bill, or else vrith a couple of tiny infants resting on his back, and holding a label in his beak, upon which is written, \" / congratulate"], [486, "464 GERJ1AN LIFE AND MANNERS. you!' Subjoined is an engraving of such a figure, copied from one purchased at the principal confec tioner's in Eisenach. Or maybe the \" funny man \" of the party pur chases at the confectioner's a little model of a Wiekel-kind (a child in swaddling clothes), dressed as the German babies usuady are ; and this he manages to introduce under the napkin of the bride's plate previous to the company sitting down to supper. These marriage feasts usually last one entire day in the city, the bride and bridegroom being present aU the time, and the company seldom or neA'er separating until the next morning. In the Adllages, however, the festivities are prolonged for three days and nights \u2014 drunkenness, riot, and obscene jesting of the rudest-possible kind, prevailing all the time. Indeed, it is only Avhen the married couple, to avoid the expense of the prolonged feasting, think it better to retire for a time into the country, that such satyr like orgies do not occur."], [487, "CHAPTEE III. AFTER MARRIAGE. Now Ave come to look on the other side of the picture. \" Hoav long does the honeymoon generally last in Saxony ? \" we inquired of a communicative German friend. \" The honeymoon ? \" iterated the gentleman. \" Oh, yes ! I do remember that is your name for AAdiat Ave call the Flitter -woche\" (literally, the tinsel-week). \" But,\" said we, \" do you really limit the happiness of newly-married life to one Aveek only?\" \" Ja wohl !\" om- friend ansAvered, \"and I should think a man has plenty of it by that time ; and has been married long enough, too, to repent of his bargain.\" The difference in these tivo terms of the \" honey moon \" and the \" tinsel- week \" speaks Arolumes as to the difference of sentiment and affection between the people of England and Germany \u2014 the one making the happiness last for a month at least, and the other considering it to be at an end in seven days ; our oavu people speaking of the first month after marriage as one of the sweetest times of man's existence, and the other describing eAren the first week as a period VOL.

Assuredly matrimony in Germany is anything but a pleasant or loving state for the women ! \" There are two creatures in Germany whose lot I do not envy,\" we have before said was the remark of an English lady to us, \" the cows and the married Avomen;\" and for our oaa-u part we hardly knoAV Avhich is treated the worst. From the very day of the wedding, the husband never sleeps in the same bed, and hardly ever in the same room as his wife ; and from the end of the very first week after he has sworn to love and protect her, he never passes one evening at home with her, the young wife being left to sit with her servant if she have one, or, if not, utterly alone, in the dingy little room adjoining the kitchen, knitting, or darning, or sewing, until the gentleman staggers home from the beerhouse an hour or two before midnight. \" If a man's wife is a decent woman,\" the German men tell you, \" she will not allow him to stay at home in the evening.\" The majority of the Avives, they say, wish their husbands to go out, \" for they know,\" you are told, \"that by going to a tavern a man is enabled to do better in his business.\" But surely the business done in England is a thou sand-fold that of Germany, and yet avIio would think of an English merchant going to a tavern at night to contract his bargains, or a lawyer or a physician"], [489, "467 AFTER MARRIAGE. frequenting a common taproom every evening with the view of extending his practice ? The wives themselves, however, tell a very different story ; and we hardly eArer spoke with a married dame in Germany who chd not complain bitterly of the way in which women were treated in her own country, saying \" that they were looked upon as little better than beasts of burden by their husbands, and treated as such ; and that marriage-contracts Avere en tered into merely as a means for men to get money and furniture enough to start in hfe.\" Nor do they fail to speak in the most gloAvdng terms, on the other hand, of the respect which they have heard is generally paid to women in England ; or to contrast the lonely and Avretched state of a woman's married life in their own land Avith the comfortable and sociable family evenings that they haA-e read of as being customary in eATery decent English household. \" Heaven forbid,\" said a German young lady to us in Coblenz, after avc and our wife had been introduced to her, \"that I should eAyer marry one of my oavu countrymen ! You English married people, when you go walking together, do so arm-in-arm ; but Avhen a German husband takes his wife out in the holidays he strolls on ahead, without giAdng heed to her, whilst she is left behind Avith the maid-servant to take care of the children. Besides, no English man can understand the coldness, not to say the cruelty, with Avhich German Arives are treated by their husbands at home. True, they see but little of them ; but when they do, the Avords are far oftener h h 2"], [490, "468 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. abuse and oaths than kindly and affectionate ones; for the man, when he leaves the tavern, after drinking five or six glasses of beer, and losing, perhaps, some feAv groschens at cards, is not in the very best of humours to be spoken Avith.\" Nor is the cruelty to which married ladies haA'e to submit of a mere passive description, wife-beating being as common in Saxony as it is exceptional in England, and the men who resort to it being in no way ashamed of the practice ; so that well-to-do, educated people, ranking as gentlemen in the land, AA'ill talk openly in the beerhouse of the Maul-sehellcn (ringing slaps on the mouth) or Karbatschen (cuts with the whip) which they have given their wife the eA*ening before. Nor can }*ou make the low-natured brutes comprehend that such conduct is either cowardly or unmanly. \" Why should you not beat a woman?\" they will coolly ask you. \" You do children, and women are but httle better than they compared with men.\" One of these worthies, avIio was known in the town to thrash his wife and grown-up daughters as though they were dogs, once happened to take offence at the conduct of our own daughter and a young lady friend of hers. The man had come to the house flushed with drink, and the young ladies at our direction had refused to speak with him ; whereupon he complained to us, saying that the}* were gemeine Frauenzimmer (low young women), and that he would advise us to give them a feAv Karbatschen to teach them Iioav to behave themselves in future. However, to the fellow's"], [491, "AFTER MARRIAGE. 469 intense astonishment, Ave proceeded to apply the very treatment he had prescribed for the young laches to his own person ; asking him Iioav he dared to make use of such a phrase . towards a daughter of ours ; and Ave dealt him such a Hoav Avith our clenched fist, straight from our shoulder, and right between his eyes, that the blood spurted from the fellow's nose on to the floor, and he began howling at the sight of it as though he had been a child in a pinafore. Next clay the degraded wretch called upon us to knoAV whether we felt inclined to make him any reparation for our conduct. He said avc had \" boxed \" him as only Englishmen can \" box,\" and that Ave had struck him hard enough to smite a bullock to the ground. We replied that Ave had no doubt we had astonished his weak nerves, in showing him the mode in which Englishmen of any courage treated coAvards like himself, aa*1io were too ready to put in practice against weak women treatment Avhich they thought extremely cruel Avhen applied to themselves. So Ave told the felloAV that if we ever heard him use a disrespectful word to any lady in our house, Ave would give him again another as good a hiding as he had had the night before ; whereupon we bundled him doAvnstairs, and the news shortly after ran round the toAvn that \" the Englander had boxed his drunken landlord.\" Nor were there many who did not rejoice over the act, for the wretch was universally hated wherever he went. \"Can a woman,\" said we, \"claim protection of the State if her husband beat her? \""], [492, "470 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. \" Yes,\" was the characteristic answer, \" if the blood flows, but not othei'Avise.\" The consequence is, that sticks which merely raise Avheals upon the flesh, rather than lacerate the skin, are the most approved Aveapons for the punishment of refractory Avdves \u2014 after the hand of the husband himself. \" For,\" said a German, who Avas rather learned upon such matters, to us, \" the hand is always ready when it is wanted, and a good Ohr-feige\" (box on the ear) \"is not soon forgotten by one's Avife, I can tell you.\" But eA'en wdien the man makes the blood flow, and lie is summoned before the town authorities for his cruelty to his AAdfe, the State inflicts no punishment upon the felloAv ; but the couple are merely asked if they Avill haAre a diA'orce, and if this be objected to, a clergyman is sent to them to talk over their differ ences, and to try to put an end to the dissension betiveen them. Such are the laws in Saxony for the protection of women, and Avith such laws it is not difficult to imagine Avhat must be the character of the hus bands, and what the treatment of the A\\dves in such a country. Moreover, AA'hen it is borne in mind, that until within the last twelvemonth, a pair of linen drawers used to be kept at the police-office, and women beaten, with these on, Avith a thick stick by one of the gens d'armes of the town, who can Avonder that the men in Saxony should treat the Avomen like beasts of burden ; or that the poor"], [493, "AFTER MARRIAGE. 471 Fraus should haA'e to lead the wretched, loveless, comfortless, and companionless liA'es they do \u2014 being looked upon merely in the light of charwomen, Avhose duty it is to scrub the house, and wash and iron the linen \u2014 and left to pass the long evenings in utter solitude, and then thrust into a mere cup board at night to sleep, and, may be, to weep over their blows \u2014 alone ? Again : even Avith the class of married men who are a shade less brutal toAvards tlieir partners than those who delight to beat them, as many do, up and doAvn the street with a stick, in the presence of their neighbours, the cruelty is often only of a less corporal character ; though sometimes quite as sharp and sting ing as the stoutest Avhip. One man, who had the re putation among the women of treating his wife some what better than the majority of Eisenach husbands, told us himself, as if he thought it a good joke, and a point of marital wisdom worthy of being treasured up for imitation by others, hoAv he had served his Frau on the previous evening. He had come home earlier than usual from the tavern called the \" Eock Cellar,\" and found the boards of his sitting-room still clamp from the av eekly scrubbing ; for the woman Avas a milliner, and had to attend to her house duties after the day's needle-Avork Avas over. Whereupon the husband began to rave and storm, demanding to know whether it was fit that there should not be a dry room to receive him on his return to the house, at the end of the clay? The Avife then, in the gentleman's own Avords, immediately commenced"], [494, "472 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. striking up a schones lied (pretty song) ; but so little versed were Ave in such matters at the time, that we were simple enough to say, \" We didn't know that your wife could sing.\" \" What kind of a song was it,\" Ave inquired, \" with A\\diich she endeavoured to soothe you?\" \"Ach teas!

That is the only way for a husband to prevent that most popular of all the Volkslied (national song) of our country being encored for some time to come ; for if you touch theft pocket, the women feel ft much more than if you beat them until they are green,\" such being the German idiom for \" black and blue \" in English. After this insight into the economy of German families, as Avell as the \" cat-and-dog \" life which usually accompanies the marriage state in Saxony, the English reader Avill be not-a-little surprised to hear that second marriages prevail to a far greater extent in that country than in our oavii. One would naturally suppose that, in a land where the husbands almost invariably treat the wives with such coolness and cruelty as Avould indicate that they Avere heartily sick of the contract they had entered into; and AA'here the Avomen suffer so much from the neglect and brutality of their \"men,\" that neither one nor the other party Avould be anxious for a repetition of the slavery, the \" AArailing and gnashing of teeth,\" Avhen they had once been emancipated from it. True, such second marriages do not often occur on the Avomen's side ; among our friends in Eisenach, indeed, Ave kneAV but one or two instances of AviAres avIio had second husbands, and in each of those cases the ladies were possessed of considerable property (for Saxony) in tlieir oavii right. AVhereas, on the other hand, the majority of married men with whom Ave Avere acquainted in the toAvn had been married, not only"], [496, "474 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. tAvice, but in many cases thrice, and in one or two instances as often as four times \u2014 such subsequent marriages being often with the relatives of the dead Avife, and that for the reasons before given. For example : there was the Herr Steuer Eevisor, he had had a couple of wives ; there Avas the Lord Chamber lain and Palace Captain, he, too, had indulged in the same luxury ; there Avas the cashier to the principal brewery, avIio had taken unto himself another Frau ; there Avas the chemist to the principal manufacturer, the colonel of the Grand Duke's one regiment, who had also been twice to the altar; and, indeed, with out boring the reader Avith the dry particulars, avc may add, for the curiosity of the matter, that we found, upon running OA*er the list of our acquaint ances, that far more than half of them had called upon the clergyman for an encore of the marriage ceremony. Of those Avho had been three times mar ried, there Avere, again, seA'eral instances. We haA'e before cited the case of the old drysalter, Avho had married three old maids, eiffc-L llie sister of his preced ing A\\dfe, so that he might retain in his oavu hands the property after the death of each of them. Moreover, the gentleman avIio occupied our lodgings on the Market Place, at the expiration of cur term there, asked our permission to moA*e some of his pictures into the apartments previous to the day of our giving them up. Among the collection Avas the portrait of a delicate-looking girl, in the costume worn about thirty years ago ; and Avhen Ave inquired AA'hether it was the picture of any relative, the un-"], [497, "AFTER MARRIAGE. 475 abashed answer Avas \" That is the portrait of the first of my three wives.\" And here, too, the catalogue might be extended, Avere it worth the reader's while to listen to the ugly details. Then, again, it was well knoAvn in the toAvn that the palace jeweller had had as many as four Avives, even though he was barely forty years of age ; and, upon inquiring as to Iioav it AA'as possible for so young a man to haA'e been married so often, Ave received the following curious and illustrative par ticulars \u2014 \" His first Avife had died of typhus, or Avhat, in Saxony, is called nervous, fever ; the second he worried to death ; the third ran away to escape his ill-treat ment, and died a feAv days before the divorce was about to be obtained; and the fourth, though still alive, it was believed by the citizens would soon be in her graA'e, owing to the same conduct on the brutal fellow's part.\" However, not to trust our \u2014 Individual experi ence in such a matter, \u00ab*f?.*unsulted some persons in the town, Avho were likely to be best informed upon the matter ; for it must be remembered that in a city hke Eisenach, numbering only 13,000 inhabit ants, the antecedents and \" belongings \" of every citizen are knoAvn to the other ; so, after summing up with them the number of people, aa*1io they knew had married twice, thrice, and eA'en a fourth time, and dividing such numbers by the rest of the married population, the following strange statistics were obtained : \u2014"], [498, "476 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. One-fourth of the AA'hole of the husbands in the city had been a second time married. About one-eighth had been three times united ; and per haps one in every sixty-four of the husbands had had as many as four wives ; Avhile many of the men who had been repeatedly re-wedded Avere so young as to lead any man of the world to the conclusion that the women could not possibly have died natural deaths in so many instances. We do not knoAV whether the enlightened social crime of wife-poisoning prevails to any extent in Germany, for, as yet, no such discoveries haA'e been made. Nor, indeed, are they likely to be for years to come, until some such institution as coroner's inquests are established in the land ; for as the law iioav exists a person may die at an early age, eA*en in some unaccountable or accidental manner, and yet no official inquiry ensues ; for immediately the signs of putrefaction are discovered on the body by the doctor appointed for the purpose, then interment of the corpse is enforced by the State.* * As an instance of the wretched state of the Saxon laws, or rather want of laws, upon these matters, we may cite a lament able case that occurred during our residence in the Thuringian capital. One of the citizens, who was in the possession of a few acres of land (like the generality of the well-to-do burghers, who are half tradesmen and half peasant-proprietors), was about to go out to his fields, which lay on the other side of the railway, in the outskirts of the city. He had his labourer with him, and was in the act of crossing the line at the part where the road intersects the rail, when a locomotive that had suddenly eft tbe station struck the pair of them on their back, and, hurling them flat on the rails, passed over their bodies. The head of the"], [499, "AFTER MARRIAGE. 477 But, even if AA'ife-poisoning for the sake of getting other partners and other property does not prevail in Saxony, still A\\*e say the circumstances are so suspi cious as to Iioav a \" number \" of men in one small town come to have three or four wives before they are forty years of age \u2014 and that especially in a country Avhere each fresh wife is expected to bring a fresh addition to the man's property \u2014 that they warrant, and, indeed, demand, some little inquiry into the matter. In the olden time with us, a woman in Lambeth had seA'en husbands ; but the very circumstance of her having been so repeatedly married led to suspicion, and ultimately to the dis- master was cut nearly in two, so he, of course, was killed on the spot ; while the labourer had his legs severed from his body by the engine, and he lingered fora few hours. Some persons in the town said the accident arose from the neglect of the \" signal man,\" who, it was alleged, had omitted to close the bar at such a time ; while others declared the bar was up, and that the men had stooped under it to cross the line. Nevertheless, let the facts have been what they might, no official inquiry was instituted to ascertain whether any one was at fault, or whether it were pos sible to prevent, by other arrangements, a recurrence of such catastrophes in future ; and the poor fellows were buried without a word from the authorities on the subject. Now, when such laxity prevails in matters where the accidental causes of death are comparatively known, the reader can readily understand what must go on in a country where the officials think it by no means necessary to inquire into the unknown or suspicious circumstances attending a young wise's decease. We have ahove shown how a man is allowed not only to go scot-free who is known to have \"worried\" two young wives into premature graves, and though he is still at work playing the same \" game \" with a third, he is permitted to retain the appointment of jeweller to the palace, as though the Court did not care to trouble its head about such trivial affairs."], [500, "478 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. coA'ery of the fact that her former partners had been, one and ad, got rid of by pouring molten lead into their ears AA'hen they were asleep. We therefore repeat, that when persons of a middle age are found to have been married three and four times, the cases are quite as suspicious as that of the \" Wife of Seven Husbands,\" above mentioned ; and that, even supposing the parties are hurried into tlieir graves by no fouler means than ill treatment, such conduct should surely be officially investigated. But we forget ill-treatment of Avives in Saxony is allowed by laAV \u2014 unless, indeed, the blood be caused to Aoav ; and even then the worthies have merely to submit to a brief admonition from a clergyman, rather than six months' labour at a tread mill as in England. The next part of this extremely pretty httle chap ter in the history of the manners and customs of the modern Saxon people, consists of the facts connected AAdth the desertion of Avomen by their husbands ; for it is a common rule among the master-tradesmen, provided they do not live happdy with their wives, to obtain from them, upon some pretext or other, money enough for a voyage to America \u2014 the fellows promis ing that, if they do well in the New Country, they Avill send for them as soon as possible ; but, in nine cases out of ten, not writing a word to their family ever after wards. Examples of this practice Avere by no means uncommon in Eisenach ; indeed, Ave knew several within the limits of our own experience, and, though our Ger-"], [501, "479 AFTER MARRIAGE. man friends assured us that one per cent, of the entire married population was a fair average as to the num ber of Avives Avho had been deserted by their husbands under such circumstances, we are inclined to believe, from the many instances Ave heard of such con duct in the Thuringian capital alone, that the estimate should be increased, at least, five-fold. In some cases, hoAvever, it is usual, when all the man's money has been squandered in America, and he finds he cannot do so Avell there as he did while living upon his Avife's earn ings at home, to send a penitent letter back, saying, \" that he cannot hve without her,\" and begging for funds to return. This was the case with the husband of the principal midwife of Eisenach, and when the gentleman came back he Avalked about the streets \" got up \" like a Broadway buck, smoking his cigar, and never did another stroke of work, unless it Avas to act as one of the spies Avhich the Grand Duke thinks it necessary to support for the better information of the \"Circle Director\" ruling over the neighbourhood. Another man, Avhom we kneAv, was a wagon-master, and he never made his ap pearance until he heard that his Avife had in his absence paid off all the debts he had left behind him ; then, suddenly one morning, a letter arrived saying, \" that he was on his way from Hamburgh to her, with a heart full of love, but, he regretted to add, Avithout any money in his pocket.\" The third case was that of the principal cabinet-maker of the city, who ran away, leaving his wife encumbered Avith five chil dren, and several hundreds of thalers debts on his"], [502, "480 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. account ; and it Avas only Avhen the hard-working dame had been able to establish a good business for herself and children, and had managed by extreme prudence to redeem aft the mortgages upon the house, that she heard her \" man\" had threatened to come back and claim the property as his own, immediatel}* it Avas free of debt ; AA'hereupon the house and business had to be made over to the eldest son to prevent the Avife losing everything ; and then the gentleman, having been did}* informed of Avhat had been done, did not think it worth his Avhile to \" enter an appear ance,\" as the laAvyers saA\\ Such examples might be added to by the score ; suffice it, Avife-desertion is sufficiently common among the trading and Avorking classes of Saxony to show that it is by no means an exceptional form of social atrocity, as Avell as to teach the reader, Avere any further instances needed, Iioav slight and slender is the matrimonial tie in that country. But, in all fairness to the German men, Ave should add that it is not only among them that marriage is looked upon as little better than a prolonged term of cohabitation^ to which, as soon as either party has occasion to do so, he or she is at perfect liberty t ) put an end ; for many of the Avomen themselves are no sooner left by their husbands than they fancy they have a perfect right to marry again, even though they are thoroughly convinced that their partner is still living at the time. \" Don't you know,\" said a woman, avIio was fifty if"], [503, "481 AFTER MARRIAGE. she was a day, to the female members of our family, \" I am betrothed to the body-servant of the Due de Chartres ? \" \" Are you a Avidow then ? \" was the natural inquiry. \" Oh, no ! my husband went away to America thirteen years ago, and I have been betrothed to my next partner for the last nine years.\" \" Then doubtlessly you have reason to believe that your husband died shortly after his arrival in that country ? \" \" Great God, no ! I heard only the other day that he Avas a major in the Federal army, but I suppose I shall never see him again ; and so I am to be married as soon as my bridegroom quits the Duke's service.\" True, the law enjoins that the man or wife must be absent for ten years, and must be advertised for in the pubhc papers before either party have the right to enter into a fresh marriage contract ; but so little does this part of the matrimonial institutions of the country appear to be respected or observed, that not one wife, but several, to our knoAvledge, spoke of re marrying, as if it were not the least social or moral offence, during the hfe of their first husband. Another lady, who was what the Germans expres sively call, \" a straw- widow,\" that is to say, one whose husband had gone across the Atlantic a few years before, and never Avritten to her afterwards, was determined to try her luck also in the New World, and when asked if she was going thither in the hope of finding her late partner, cried, \" Gott bewahre !

But these lax notions as to the sacredness of the marriage-contract are a necessary consequence of the laws concerning divorces in Saxony. In our own country we have acknowledged the principle that such luxuries should not be restricted to the rich, and in the desire to deal Avith all classes fairly, our legislators have lately instituted a Divorce Court Avhere a man can be utterly absolved from all the vows he made at the altar for a comparatively trifling expense. But in the same spirit of justice let this principle of facile divorceability be carried a step lower, and let the poorer people be admitted to the same rights as have lately been extended to the middle classes, and were formerly restricted solely to the higher ones. Let it be possible to put an end to all the matrimonial ties, as well as family duties, for the small charge of a few shillings, and upon the most trivial pretexts \u2014 as has long been the case in the legal courts of Saxony \u2014 and"], [505, "AFTER MARRIAGE. 483 assuredly the disclosures concerning the married life of the people of England will soon come to be as hateful and semi-barbarous as the revelations wliich we have made in the present chapter respecting the matrimonial state, as it at present exists, in the Thuringian capital. HoAvever, let us disregard home matters for the sake of pointing a moral by the example of such in stitutions abroad. The cost of a divorce, in Saxony, Ave have before incidentally stated, does not exceed SOs. (ten thalers), provided both parties are willing that the marriage betAveen them should be annulled. If, howeArer, there be any opposition on either side, the exj.enses of course are considerably increased ; but even then, in a country where laAvyers are allowed to charge only twopence for Avriting a letter, the costs seldom, or never, exceed 10/., and are often much less. The pleas upon which divorces are granted are not a little illustrative of the low and degraded feeling of the country. One person Avhom we kneAV, and a\\*1io, though a clergyman, married his wife merely for the property she possessed, was enabled to obtain the divorce he sought for, when he foimd that she would not give up to him the capital as well as the interest of her property, solely upon the plea that (as the ele gant German phrase runs) \" she stank in her throat,\" or, as we should say, her breath was offensive. Another gentleman was diA'orced from his wife, simply because, as he stated in open court, the lady had freckles on her stomach. On the other hand, drunken- i i 2"], [506, "484 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. ness, bad temper, or even ill-treatment are considered to be insufficient grounds for the granting of divorces, unless both parties are agreeable thereto. If the Avife apply to the State to have her marriage annulled on such grounds, and the husband object to forego his claim over the wife's property, then the authorities have no other poAver but to send, as Ave haAre said, a clergyman to the disputants in the hope of bringing about a reconciliation. If, howrever, this be found impossible, or the cruel treatment to the woman be carried on to an extent that even Germans may think unjustifiable, then a separation from bed and board is granted for one or three years, as the case may be, and reneAved as often as found necessary \u2014 the husband being ordered to allow his wife such a maintenance as befits her station in life, and is compatible with his income. In the course of the last year a prayer for such a divorce was instituted by one of the principal clergy men of the town, who had been married a second time, and whose wife No. 2 had run away from him within a short time after the Flitter-woche had passed. The plea raised by tbe reverend gentleman was the absconding of the woman from her home. But then came a counter-plea that the worthy in holy orders Avas too famdiar with his housekeeper (after the fashion of the Catholic priests of old, the gowns of whose cooks were AA'ont to hang beside the clerical robes in the Pastor's own bed-chamber), and then the matter was hushed up, so that it is impossible to say Iioav it ended."], [507, "485 AFTER MARRIAGE. Nor Avas this the only case of a like kind Avhich occurred Avith the clergy during our time in Eisenach. In the instance before cited, where the Pfarrer ob tained a divorce on the plea of his wife's bad breath, it was said that the lady refused to make over any portion of her property to the gentleman, because he too had a housekeeper whom he treated AAdth more familiarity, if not respect, than herself. In all such divorce questions, however, the main difficulty hes in what shall become of the innocent and helpless children. A friend of ours, avIio hved in Dresden, assured us that he knew no less than six different families of children belonging to one man and Avife, owing to the divorces and re-marriages of the pair. In Eisenach, howeA^er, three or four such dis tinct generations of children are as many as are eArer found belonging to one married man and woman \u2014 the usual rule being, in case of divorce, that the father takes the boys, and the mother the girls, while each party is at liberty to re-marry as soon after as he or she pleases. \" And how do the stepfathers and stepmothers,\" asked we, \" usually treat the large brood of other men's and women's children, which they have often to keep under the same roof?\" \" Oh, like stepfathers and stepmothers all over the world,\" was the German's reply. And thus the English reader sees what is the usual end of marriages and divorces in Thuringia."], [508, "SECTION VI.\u2014 THE BEGINNING AND THE END OF GERMAIN LIFE. CHAPTEE I.

Such is the usual form of announcement that appears in the \"Eisenach Circle Leaf\" (Kreis Blast) immediately any increase in the population occurs in the Thuringian capital. After the httle stranger has been introduced into the famdy, it is customary for the Frau Thilo (the michvife) to call twice in the course of the day for a fortnight to wash and dress the infant in the morning and evening ; and our lady friend (who was Arery communicative upon such matters) assured us that she found this custom A*ery costly also, as she was expected to give the Frau white bread for breakfast, and sausage for supper. This practice continues for a fortnight, after Avhich the ser- A-ices of Madame Thdo are dispensed with, and the mother left to the superintendence of her own infant ; for in two weeks after the birth, the lady is expected to be up and able to take care of it and herself. The advertisements Avhich are usually inserted in the neAvspapers Avhen any addition is made to the population in Germany are so utterly different from the simple announcement of such facts common in our OAvn country \u2014 and, indeed, seem to be prompted by so little delicacy of feeling \u2014 that Ave should fail in"], [511, "489 FROM THE CRADLE. giving the reader a fair estimate of the morals of the country which forms the theme of the present book were Ave to omit citing one or two more of them here.

Immediately after birth, the poor babe is fed, for the first twenty-four hours at least, upon herb-tea and sugar water, for it is not allowed to taste a drop of milk during that time ; nor is it permitted to sleep Avith its mother, or nurse, at night, but is stowed away, generally, in a small clothes-basket, with a pillow for its bed, after the wretched new-born little thing has been wound up in, Hea\\*en knows how many ells of bandages, from the feet right, and tight, up to the neck ; as if it were intended to be embalmed as a mummy, and God Almighty had never designed it to have the free use of its muscles and hmbs. In its SAvaddled state a new-born babe looks as if it Avere one of the young Caryatides with a human head on a shapeless trunk of stone. In the case of the lady first-aboA'e quoted, Ave must admit in all candour that the arms (but they alone) of the infant were left free ; for, as she said, her hus band was a strange man, and would not consent to haA'e the baby imprisoned, as though it were a chrysalis in a cocoon. For such young babes, neither frocks nor flannel petticoats nor \" blankets \" are ever made \u2014 all the clothing of the new-born infant consisting of merely a coarse linen shirt (about as fine as servants' -sheeting with us), the aforesaid bandages, and a little coloured-cotton jacket ; in"], [513, "491 FROM THE CRADLE. wdiich state it is stuffed into a \" Kissen \" (cushion) or \" Steck-beft \" as it is expressively called on the Ehine (literally the bed into wdiich new-born chd dren are stuck), after the manner of a watch into a watch-pocket, and not half so comfortably as a young kangaroo in the pouch of its mother. These SAvaddled infants are called in Germany Wickel-kinder. In the confectioners' shops there is always kept a stock of sugar images of babies so bound hand and foot, till the models look like some miniature casts of the corpses preserved in the mummy-room at the British Museum ; and these are sent anony mously, as a refined joke, to any young lady on the evening of the festivities immediately preceding her marriage. [On the next page is an engraving made from a pho tograph of such an image, and from it the Enghsh reader will have a good idea of the barbarous manner in which infants are swaddled to this day in Saxony.] It is usual, among the richer folk of Eisenach, to hand their infants OArer to be nourished by a wet nurse ; but among the middle classes, who are unable to afford so unnatural a form of luxury, we belieA'e mothers are generally in the habit of suckling their OAvn offspring. The custom of foster-mothers, how ever, prevails even with the wives of the beggarly paid officers of the Saxon army ; though with the very poor people, such as labourers and the like, the children are mostly brought up by hand, owing to the ill-fed condition of the working classes, and"], [514, "492 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. the mothers having mostly (if we, as the father of a family, may be aUoAved the expression) \" nothing to give them.\" Indeed it is curious to note how, in this underfed nation, animals of all kinds are unable to suckle their young but a month or two after birth. We have known dogs and cats Avhose milk failed them long before the litter had cut their teeth; and physio logists will not in any way wonder at the statement, when we add that the only food given to these creatures, fitted Avith flesh-tearing teeth, is black bread, sopped in w'ater, or else sausage-skins ; and that the popular belief among the Saxons is that meat is apt to produce a decline in such animals. The consequence is, that never Avas such a race of domestic animals to be seen on the face of the earth : cats Avith back-bones not unlike a miniature ridge of"], [515, "493 FROM THE CRADLE. the Alps, and dogs as thin and long-legged as French pigs, and as underbred as those in the streets of Con stantinople. Such a sweet and grateful sight as an English baby, in long, free, white robes ; with flesh as fresh and odorous as rose-leaves ; with cheeks like apple blossoms ; Avith rolls of fat about its little neck ; a pretty dimple at eArery joint ; Avith hands and feet of the most exquisite chubby symmetry, and its tiny nads like so many pinky little shells picked up by the sea side \u2014 is never to be seen throughout filthy, barbarous Deutschland. If there is a thing we love upon the earth, it is the sight of such little chddren as can only be met with in England. Our own infants we have danced and nursed by the hour long, finding a delight, far beyond that of books or phdosophy, in the unaffected, joyous laugh of their dawning affec tions, as we tickled them under the neck, or played no end of silly frolics to see the tiny creatures' cheeks crease and dimple into a thousand happy puckers. We have carried them for many a mde through the streets, and found in the look of their heavenly, innocent eyes, the SAveetest reward for the cramp in the arm they have given us. In Germany, however, babies are loathsome, f\u0153tid things \u2014 rank with the sour black pap or goat's milk upon which they have been fed, and offensive to the last degree with the excreta that are kept bound up Avithin their SAvaddling clothes for twelve hours at a time.

We assure English mothers, however, that we describe, in all the literalfty and honesty of authorship, merely the sights we ourselves haA'e seen ; and when we tell them that such scenes were Avitnessed in the house of a person who had passed some few years of her hfe in English families, our lady readers will be the better able to understand how degraded must be the rearing of the chddren among the utterly unen lightened German gentlefolks themselves. To take another A'iew of the case : let us say that we spent the harvest-home Avith the clergyman in the Adllage of Mohra, and that it is impossible to describe, wdthin the bounds of decency, the fifth in which the children of that family were allowed to wallow. Every one of them, we were assured by a German friend, was contaminated with the itch, their heads were encrusted with sores and filth, and their faces blotched all over with patches of scab, so that a person of any refinement would as soon have thought of touching a leper as fondling one of those poor neg lected little things. We should, however, in our asperity remember that such a state of things preA'afted in our OAvn country almost up to the middle of the last century, and that the modern fashion of alloAving infants the free use of their limbs is, comparatively speaking, one of those innovations which superior enlightenment has brought about throughout the length and breadth of our land. Indeed, we have elsewhere said there is but one key Avith which to unlock the mystery of German social degradation, and that is an arch\u00e6ological one."], [519, "FROM THE CRADLE. 497 We have but to read the history of the manners of our oavii country to find the Germans in the same state as Avas common to English folk some tAvo hundred 3rears ago. The eating of black rye-bread, for instance, Avas discontinued with us as the staff of life as far back as the reign of Charles II. The use of sugared condiments with meat was abandoned soon after the introduction of vegetables in the time of Elizabeth. The introduction of newspapers, bigger and more in formed than ordinary play-bills, dates from Queen Anne. The decoration of corpses continued up to almost a hundred years ago. Lighting, paving, draining, and the supply of water by high service to the topmost floor of the different houses, are things almost of the writer's OAvn time. What wonder, then, that a land that is so many miles removed from the English centre of civilization and progress (as even enlightened Germans alloAv our country to be) should be found in the same state as our oavii people, centuries back ? An Englishman, as he travels from his own home, seems, indeed, to be reading page after page in the social history of his own nation, and yet he cannot help marvelling the Avhile at Avhat are the uses of railways, telegraphs, steam-presses, and penny postages in these days, since it takes so many years to make a semi-barbarian race keep pace with a highly-civilized one.

True, the Jews resident in each of the German towns are not compelled to conform to the Christian rites ; but then Jews are never elected to fill public offices ; and unless a person can produce a certificate of his christening, and after-confirmation, he is not only considered in capable of holding any situation of trust, but the clergyman can refuse even to marry him. This is a form of religious tyranny that, thank Heaven ! advanced notions upon such matters have long ago, in England, blown to the winds. Suppose a Government clerk in our own country were forced to give proof of his confirmation before he could enter the Treasury or Somerset House, Avould not the great body of Dissenters among us raise a whirlwind of indignation about the heads of our authorities against such hierarchical tyranny ? And Ave must confess Ave think they Avould do so in perfect justice ; for what moral right has any one man, or body of men, to interfere with the creed of another ? As Avell might Government ordain that the people were to take pills at particular times, as to Avorship the Creator after this or that special form. Surely, my religion is a matter between me and the Almighty alone, and righteous political power should extend only to a man's duties to his neighbour, and in no Avay interfere Avith those more private ties which"], [521, "499 FROAI THE CRADLE. connect every human being with the God above him. In free-thinking Germany, however, there is no notion of free-praying ; and the people bear with an amount of clerical imposts that Avould not be submitted to in our own land. Indeed, this legally-ordained christen ing and confirmation of eA'ery person born and reared in the country appears to us the same unjust tyranny as obtained in our own nation when Ave burnt Hop kins and others, simply because they chose to hold prayer-meetings at their own homes, and refused to take part hi the rites of the Church of England once every month at least. Noav these legally-enforced christenings (for there is a fine of ten groschens for every day that the cere mony is delayed beyond a month after birth) lead to many peculiar customs in the Thuringian capital. It is the rule there, that any young woman or man who is newly confirmed must become sponsor to the chdd of the first poor person who asks him or her to do so. What may be the penalty on refusal Ave know not ; but certain it is that no girl or youth ever thinks of denying the request. The common belief among the poor, however, is that if the young person requested should object to fill the office, the child will either die or grow up sick and weakly ; and as the rich either have faith in, or give way to, the superstition, consent is the usual practice. It is nevertheless by no means necessary that the well-to-do godparent should accom pany the poor child to the altar \u2014 all that is expected being that he or she should pay the expenses conse quent upon the christening, and present the child __. k 2"], [522, "500 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Avith a cotton frock for the ceremony. The christening expenses for a poor child are 20 groschens (2s.), be sides 15 groschens (Is. 6d.) to the nurse who carries the babe ; and the payment of these sums after all constitutes the great charm in the eyes of the poorer classes. Such an institution may be of use as the means of uniting the poor with the rich, but that it has no religious object with it is demonstrated by the fact that godmotherhood in Germany, as with us, is considered chiefly as a social tie, and one which enjoins the giving of certain presents at certain seasons to the godchild, rather than the superintend ence of its moral and religious education. For though in the early days of Christianity there might have been some necessity for sponsorship, as a guarantee that the christened infant should be brought up in the new and more-enlightened faith ; nevertheless, in the present day, the custom has become obsolete, and the promises made at the altar haA'e long ago sunk into mere lip-service ; so that iioav the office is considered to be fulfilled by the gift of a silver spoon and fork, in quittance of the pledges so solemnly undertaken. This same deodand holds good in Germany to the present day \u2014 silver spoons forming the staple presents at the time of the christening. The Germans, Iioav ever, seem to believe that their sponsorial duties do not utterly end here, for it is customary in Saxony to present the young god-child with a neAv suit the first Christmas after its birth. On the day of the ceremony the godfather is ex pected to send the godmother a pair of Avhite kid"], [523, "FROM THE CRADLE. 501 gloves and a bouquet. The christening is usually per formed late in the afternoon, and at the conclusion of it, the parents retire with the sponsors home, to an early eA'ening meal of coffee, cake, sausage, Sauer-kraut, and salad \u2014 a feast being always given on such occa sions, to which a number of friends are iiiA'ited, and drinking and riot generally prevailing till a late hour at night. Indeed, Ave have before sliOAvn that it Avas in the heat of one of these same christening orgies at Mohra, that a descendant of Martin Luther's stabbed a peasant, and had to fly the country for many years afterAvards. Hoav many godfathers or godmothers are permitted or enjoined by laAv, Ave cannot say ; but Ave happen to knoAV that hi one middle-class family in Eisenach the sponsors of the ten children amounted to thirty-six in number \u2014 a fact Avhich will fully explain Avhat a mere trick of trading for presents to the children is this so-called religious ceremony in Saxony. Previous to confirmation the neophyte has to betake himself, or herself, for an hour after school-time tivice every Aveek, at the beginning of his or her course of religious instruction, to the school at Avhich the clergyman attends ; and for an hour every day for the last quarter of the year previous to theft examina tion. This is called the \" Gebet-stunde\" (literally the prayer-lesson), and some have to attend it for two or three years before being confirmed. During the last year of their probation the young people are expected to be of particularly staid and solemn demeanour: they are to indulge in no games nor sports, and, indeed, to"], [524, "502 GERA1AN LIFE AND MANNERS. abstain from all kinds of amusements whatever. Im mediately after the final examination by the clergy man has been passed, and they are thought fit for confirmation, they are directed by the Pfarrer to go round to all their friends, the day before the cere mony, and say to each of them, \" If ever I have done thee any wrong, I humbly crave thy forgiveness.\" It is usual at such times for the friends Ansited to give the j'oung people not only their blessing but a few groschens, or some other present, into the bargain. At the time of confirmation the godfather and godmother are expected to present theft sponse chdd with something either hi gold or sdver. To boys watches are usually giA'en, whilst brooches and cuff-buttons are the ordinary presents made to girls. Moreover, AA-hen any of the godchildren are about to be married, the custom prevails for the sponsors to send them certain articles of plate or furniture \u2014 such as tea or table spoons, or may be a work-table of the more expensive woods. One young lady we heard of having two and a half dozen sdver spoons presented to her by her collective godfathers and godmothers at such a time. Again, Ave were assured that it is customary for the godfather and godmother to send their married goddaughter a silver spoon with her name engraven upon it, at the birth of every child. Noav, in the above customs there is a certain twang of primitive Christian beauty, but at the same time a"], [525, "FROM THE CRADLE. 503 far greater alloy of Avorldly interest to make the practice in any way commendable to people of philosophic minds.

We say imaginary, because, though the animals were duly inspected by the cattle-doctor appointed by the city, and pronounced by him to be in a confirmed stage of hydrophobia, and though the said insane hounds had bitten seA'eral children and no end of other dogs in theft course through the streets, no hydrophobic symptoms were ever manifested by any of the creatures whom the supposed mad animal was said to have wounded. Nevertheless, the crier was sent round with a mandate from the official authorities that all dogs whatever were to be kept within the houses, or to be taken out only under tether of a chain ; and that any person infringing the injunction woidd be subjected to a fine of 3 thalers, or 19s.

And yet the cases of hydro phobia from the bites of rabid dogs are by no means of common occurrence, even in a city where the population is counted by millions, and Avhere the dogs themselves must be a thousand-fold more numerous than the rational animals in the Thurin gian capital.

At length, how ever, after the poor creature had been kept within doors Avithout sniffing the fresh air for nine weeks, there came a manumittimus declaring that all the dogs Avere free to go out into the streets once more ; for the civic superstitious Avasherwomen, Avho have the sway over the Eisenach citizens, seem to have some crude notion in theft pates, that if any symptoms of hydrophobia are to make their appearance, they are sure to exhibit themselves either on the ninth day, the ninth week, the ninth month, or the ninth"], [534, "512 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. year \u2014 though such ideas linger in the minds merely of astrologers, herbalists, and servant-maids Avith us at the present time. The main objection to such laws is, that grown men are treated as if they had no more Avits than chddren, and that a jack-a-napes of an ex-chandler's-shopkeeper who happens to have been raised to the dignity of burgomaster of a city no bigger than a hamlet, has the right so far to interfere with the liberty of the subject. There would appear to be three classes of doctors in Saxony, of which it is impossible to cite the pre cise equivalent in England, and for each of which there is a distinct and special examination before the members are permitted to practise either of the three forms of healing. The first is that appertaining to physicians and surgeons proper; for, as we have before said, no distinction is made in Saxony between sur gery and physic ; and for this class, so far as we could understand, a most rigid examination is re quired, though, as a general rule, it seemed to us that the members of the German medical profession were as far behind the English ones, both in knowledge and gentlemanly bearing, as the German clergymen, who are mostly the sons of peasant-farmers, are diverse from our own curates and rectors. The healing art, indeed, in Saxony appears to be in about the same state as it was with us some hundred years ago.

The second class of medical men in Saxony consists of Avhat are called Wund-artzen (wound-doctors), that is to say, those who are entitled to practise the ex ternal rather than the internal arts of healing. The examination required for such persons is such as is enjoined for military bone-setters, as contra distinguished from army-surgeons or physicians pro per. Such medical gentry can hardly be allied with the enlightened medical men of our OAvn country. In character and manners they ap proximate to the better class of English \"cattle doctors;\" and though they are legally qualified to amputate limbs, when we tell the reader that their fee for cutting oft1 a leg is but fifteen shillings, English folk will readily understand Iioav with such means of keeping pace with the knowledge and enlightenment of Europe, they cannot possibly be said to bear the least semblance to the gentlemen surgeons of our own land. The third class of so-called medical men in Saxony VOL. T. l L"], [536, "514 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. has long ago died out in England. These are \" barber- chirurgeons,\" of Avhose existence the striped poles hung out at our cheap hairdressers' shops are the only signs left among us. In Saxony, however, these barber-surgeons flourish to the present day, and seem to the English mind as if they were the vivified fossds of some antediluAdan order of creation ; for in Eisenach, before a man is legally allowed to mow your chin of its daily bristles, he has to pass an examination before the \" Ministerium\" at Weimar, to prove his capability of taking up arteries, to show his anatomical knoAvledge of the precise locality of the veins he has to puncture, to make known his fitness, indeed, for applying leeches, putting on blisters, cupping and bone-setting, as well as administering to cases of suspended animation, such as hanging, drowning, &c. Further, the barber-surgeon of Ger- many, is allowed to practise even in cases of poison- ing. True, he is permitted by law to give merely milk, whenever any deleterious drug has been swal- lowed, and is bound to call hi a physician hi cases of emergency; still, from the instances aboA*e cited, it will be seen how far the Germans lag behind the knowledge of enlightened Europe ; and when we assure the reader that eA'ery such barber-surgeon has to pay, on an average, from 300 to 400 thalers, i. e. from \u00a345 to \u00a360 sterling, to the State, before he is allowed to practise his simple art, the quick-witted Englishman Avill readily understand Iioav political revenue is enriched at the expense of the enlighten ment and proper treatment of the people."], [537, "515 TO TIIE GRAVE.

Among the Thurin gian peasants, and often, so far as Ave could learn,"], [539, "TO THE GRAVE. 517 among the citizens of the toAvns, it is the mode Avith fathers, and indeed with mothers, when they have arrived at an age which unfits them for the cares of the world, to make over their entire property to their chddren, and as no law of primogeniture exists in Saxony, this is usually carried out by dividing their possessions, AA-hether real or personal, in common among the members of the family. The chAdsion is made under a regular legal form, recognized by the State, and by Avhich a certain yearly sum out of the interest of the capital is reserved to the parents ; such sum being termed Alimentations-geld, or in other Avords \" living money.\" The interest is generally paid by the members of the family on the birthday of the parent, the custom being for the children to bring the amount in neAv, bright, silver thalers. These are placed in a basket covered Avith fresh flowers, and carried to the chvell ing of the parent, AA-here a coffee-drinking of the entire family is held, and large cakes baked to cele brate the occasion. Such is the usual mode of pro ceeding with Avhat are termed \" united families\" \u2014 that is to say, wdth those rare exceptions Avhere the several members remain in peace and concord Avith their parents after such a chAdsion of property has been made among the children. In all fairness, Ave should add that during our stay in the Thuringian capital one or tAvo such cases came under our personal observation. Similar instances, hoAvever, avc regret to say, are like angels' visits\u2014 \"very feAv and far betiveen.\""], [540, "518 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. For the history of humanity it would be well that such a provision led to good results ; but from the best information we could obtain upon the subject, we must confess that the custom seems to be fraught with greater eAnls than benefits. For as a ride (to which we have above quoted a few honourable exceptions), no sooner is such a deed signed, and the entire wealth of the parents made over to the children, than the young folk begin to see there is no hope of reward by good conduct towards theft old father or mother ; and pro ceed to treat them consequently with the greatest pos sible disrespect, if not cruelty. OArer and OArer again have we heard of processes in the Justice-house by fathers against the children, who had so wronged them ; and we haA'e before cited the case of the mother of a Master- Tanner aa-1io had to take legal proceedings against her son (aster she had assigned to him the entire business on his marriage), in order to obtain ten groschens, or a shifting a clay, as the expense of her maintenance ; while the ingrate AA*retch Avent round about the beer-houses exclaiming against the extortion, and scoffing at the idea of haAdng to pay his old mother two thalers ten groschens (or seven shillings weekly), when, as he said, \" God in Heaven knew, it cost him and his wife but a thaler (or three shillings) a-head every Aveek for theft food.\" Indeed, the ill-treatment to which the old peo ple are often subject, after making such a set tlement, forms one of the saddest chapters in the history of human life and human affections. In the wilds of South-western Africa, we are told that a tribe"], [541, "519 TO THE GRAVE. of savages exists on either side of the Swakop Eiver, who are called \" Damaras,\" and who, according to the account given by Mr. Andersson in the narrative of his travels in those parts, \" hold that when people are too old to work, they ought to die directly ; so if the aged persons are obstinate, their children help them into the grave.\" \" A standard joke there,\" we are assured, \"is for a son to pretend that he thinks his old father is dead Avhen he is only asleep or meditating, and to break his back-bone Avith a stone.\" In Saxony, certaml}', such direct barbarities are never practised ; but, so far as our experience goes, the children, when they haA'e got all they can from theft parents, not only regard them as mill-stones round their neck, but treat them as if they had no more feeling than such mill-stones, and do all that cruelty can deAdse \"to help them,\" like the Damaras, \"to theft graAre.\" It is the same, too, AAdth the very poor ; for we have heard young serving-girls, who had to contribute a certain small sum out of tlieir wages towards the support of a bedridden grandmother, say AAdthout a blush, that it would be a good thing when the old Avoman was dead and gone \u2014 for AAdiat use Avas she on the face of the earth ? Indeed, as Ave have before told in the account of the Klemda balls, the mothers of Saxony consent to become the serving-maids of theft girls directly they are old enough to frequent the dances and con- certs in the town ; and the consequence is, all sense of respect is lost \u2014 the children growing up to regard them in no better light than menials, and looking upon them, vdien they become too old and decrepid"], [542, "520 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. for any other service, as incubi, whose removal is to be considered as a matter of rejoicing, rather than their death grieved over as a family bereavement. In fine, at the time of one of the masked balls given during om- stay in Eisenach, a poor old creature of some seventy odd years who had more children, grand children, and great grandchildren than there are Aveeks in the year, happened to fall dangerously ill some few days before the masquerade Avas to take place ; where upon the entire body of relatives, avIio had either made up or hired their dresses for the foolery, raised such a hubbub of disappointment in the town, that wherever you went the wail was \u2014 \" Oh ! if the old woman should die before we haA'e time to Avear the dresses we've paid for.\" And one little ape of a jeAveller, avIio was grandson to the poor old thing, even went to the length of declaring, openly in the taverns, that if his grandmother gave up the ghost before the Sunday upon which he was to appear (appropriately enough) as the \" fool \" in some old German wedding-procession, she should die with his curses about her head \u2014 as it had cost him not less than two thalers for his chess for the masquerade ; AA-hereas, if she chose to breathe her last on the Mon day she might haA*e his blessing instead. Such is a literal account of the state of feeling which binds the two extremes of life together, in the Thuringian capital. It is hard to say as much of any foreign nation, but our bitter experience is, that these same German folk are a mere phlegmatic sentimental race. They tell you, themselves, that they are"], [543, "521 TO THE GRAVE. specially distinguished by theft Natur-sinn, that is to say, by their sense or love of Nature ; but this extends merely to a stupid and an unartistic admiration of whatever is green, and hence tlieir love of decorating chambers with all kinds of boughs and twigs. But of any of the higher orders of beauty, as regards colour or form, not to speak of the dignities, graces, and affections, or even ties of hfe, they seem to us as a body of people, to have no more feeling than so many gold-fish. At the time of death, as that of birth, the ad vertisements which are inserted in the public papers are entirely different from those which are usual with us on such occasions. In the olden time, in England, the ride AA'as to publish inflated accounts of the sufferings and virtues of the deceased, and to con clude with a statement of the amount of money the defunct had left behind them. Thank HeaA'en, such unseemly public parades have long since passed aAvay in our country ! In Germany, however, Ave see our OAA'n people and our own customs reflected, as it were, in a distorting mirror, showing hoAv hideously ugly were our practices, in moral eyes, some centuries back ; as Avell as Iioav woefully this same educated, and would-be poetic, German nation lags far behind the ach*anced races of Europe. If there be a time at which the public ostentation of grief is more hateful than at another, surely it is at that solemn period when some poor soid goes to its last account; and every decent-minded person"], [544, "522 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. knows that at such moments the heart grows naturally dumb with the OA^erpoAvering weight of the blow that has fallen upon it. Indeed, it is a law of human nature, that in all intense emotions the human mind is comparatively silent and secret \u2014 being too deeply absorbed, as it were, Avith the storm that is raging with- in it, to pay the least heed to the petty struggles and vanities of the Avorld that are going on outside of it. Hence, Ave can haA*e no more faith in those Avho are in the habit of weeping, at such times, in the columns of a public newspaper, than Christ himself had in Pharisees, whose wont ft was to make long faces at the corners of streets, so that they might \" be seen of men.\" Consequently, although Ave maybe touched, at the first time of perusal, by the peculiarity of the death-announcements in Saxony, and haA'e our sym- pathies roused by the novelty and force of the phra- seology used upon such occasions, we come at length to sicken over these same strong phrases of osten tatious anguish ; and to wonder why people cannot retire to tlieir closet to Aveep and pray, rather than do so, at so much per line, in the advertising pages of a public journal : as for instance,- \u2014 So tljofc fs'aring in out sorrow we tcbicatc tt. c mourning intelligence licrclui-inabc; fiiomii tljat out inmatbln.l'ctoocb little son Slug it ft, aftec nineteen wees, tong of ficfl'cb (Stantcnlagci) suffering, tlii. bai) to a .ettec aftcrflatc mai calleb amaij.

We have now done with all the customs up to the time of death in Saxony ; and come in due order to treat of the death obsequies themselves. It is usual at the last moments of the poor (and far more customary than among the rich), for the people to send for the clergyman and have the \"holy evening-meal \" as it is called in Thuringia (or the sacrament of Holy Unction as the Cathodes term it), administered to them. This costs but one penny, according to the tariff of the country ; compara tively larger sums, hoAvever, are given, in propor tion to the means of the individuals. There is a simple superstition among the people of the land, that upon the administration of this final sacrament the patient must either die or recover ; and it is plain to the commonest logician that upon the horns of such a dilemma the fate of every person must depend. One simple girl told us that she knew of a person Avhom she had seen with her own eyes at the point of death in the Eisenach Hospital, and aa'Iio reA'ived immediately after the administration of the moribund rites. All Ave can say is \" God bless her for her faith ! \""], [547, "525 TO THE GRAVE. and we are perfectly assured that it Avas this self same faith of the dying man which made him \u2014 as Avhen Christ himself touched the sick \u2014 whole for the time being. Immediately after death the bodies are washed and laid out by the \" Todten Frau \" (death- woman), Avhose perquisite it is to claim every white cloth about the body, at the time of decease. These would ap pear to be the gains of such carrion folk in eA'ery land ; though people who trouble their head about the why and the wherefore of each national custom cannot help wondering Avhy the self-same practices should preA'ail in countries so far removed from one another. The hangman Avith us claims the clothes in which the culprit pays the last penalty of the laAV \u2014 he seizes upon the black silk stockings and black satin dress in which Mrs. Manning goes to the scaffold, Avith the same alacrity as the nurse Avho has smoothed your parent's pillow at the last moment takes the linen from your dead father's or mother's body. Still such hateful priAdleges appear to preArail throughout Europe ; and we can only wonder whence they came. No sooner does a death occur in Saxe Weimar than the information is sent to the \"Leiden Bess Utter\" (official undertaker, there being no private ones to plunder the relatives in Saxony), and he orders the removal of the corpse from the house of the family to the dead-house of the city at eleven o'clock in the night of the day on which the death has occurred. At that horn- two men come to the house, bearing a"], [548, "526 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. long basket and lantern. The basket is half filled Avith hay, and in this the body, wrapped in a sheet, is placed with a pillow beneath the head, and so borne to the Todten-Haus (dead-house) adjoining the cemetery. Those persons who are so disposed may object to the immediate removal of the dead body, and cause it to remain for three days in the home in wliich the death took place. As, however, it costs a greater sum of money to be buried from the house of the family, than it does from the dead-house in con nection with the cemetery, such an expensive practice is indulged in merely by the well-to-do. It is far more usual, therefore, for the body to be borne away to the dead-house on the same evening as the death occurs. A basket of avoocI and twigs, as well as sufficient oil to keep a lamp alight during the nights till the time of interment, is likeAvise sent Avith the corpse ; for it is the custom in this same superstitious land, not only to keep a lamp and a fire burning in the dead-house up to the day of burial, but to place a ring on the thumb of the dead person's hand, so that, if there be the least chance of returning life, the bell may be rung to warn the attendant, who is ever on the watch. In this basket of hay, AA*ith a pilloAv under the head, the corpse remains until within an hour or tAvo of the time appointed for the burial. Day by day the doctor, elected by the toAvn for the purpose, calls at the dead house to satisfy himself that the signs of corporeal decomposition are duly taking place ; and when he has"], [549, "TO THE GRAVE. 527 declared that the body is irrevocably dead, the deco ration of the corpse begins after the fashion of the country. Then the \"Todten Frau\" (death-woman) proceeds to dress the body in the best possible costume to Avhich the person has been accustomed during life. Women at such times are occasionally attired in white dresses, with a Avreath upon their head, and otheis, of the poorer class, have black goAvns and shoes and stock ings ; while the men are laid out in coat, trousers, cravat, boots, and Avhite gloves. In one case, a gilt lyre was placed upon the breast, and a laurel Avreath upon the head, to indicate the musical genius of the deceased. Even after the corpse has been \"gepufzt,\" as it is called, no coffin can be fastened doAA*n till the medical authority has certified that the body is fit for interment. Moreover, ft is the custom for friends at such times to send garlands and flowers for the covering of the body, during the time that the coffin is left open for the inspection of the pubhc, as it generaUy is, for an horn- or two previous to the burial ceremony. On the occasion of a funeral, it is curious to hear the comments of the crowd, as they keep bobbing in and out of the dead-house, concerning the appear ance of the corpse about to be consigned to its last home. \" Oh ! \" says one woman, \" it is wunder-schoue \" (Avonderfully beautiful) : \" she is dressed in a cap with pink ribbons, and has a Avhole coffinful of flower-blossoms, and a bouquet in her hand, I declare.\""], [550, "528 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Then, if it happen to be a man high in the State, you are informed as to how many orders he has on his breast, and so forth. Such is the delight, in this antiquated land, in the contemplation of the decorated corpses, that it is by no means uncommon for the people to commission a photographer to take a literal portrait of tlieir friends as they appear when laid out previous to burial ; and though such portraits cost a considerable sum of money for the Saxon people (from ten to fifteen shil lings), they delight to have the ghastly pictures, treasured in the three-cornered cupboards of their rooms, continually before them. After the public have been admitted to A'iew the decorated corpse at the dead-house, the garlands sent by the friends are taken from the interior of the coffin and placed on the pall outside of it. Then comes the strange question, as to aa*1io is to bear the body to the grave ? If the dead person had happened to belong to any of the \" Zimften \" (that is to say, to any of the trades' corporations attached to the toAvn), it is the peculiar privilege of the members of such Guild to carry the corpse to the ground. If, howeA'er, he were a burgher in connection Avith no particular incorporated trade, then it is cus tomary to employ the tailors for the office ; for these people, say the citizens, are the most decent-looking among the working class. For such duties the price usually paid is fifteen groschens (one-and -sixpence) each bearer. Moreover, previous to the performance of the ceremony, the coffin-bearers are alloAved to"], [551, "TO THE GRAVE. 529 assemble at the house of the dead person, and there to be treated to schnapps and Avhite bread as a means of fitting them for the labour. In the olden time it Avas customary for the Thuringian people to expend large sums of money upon burial ceremonies ; but from the beginning of the present century it has been forbidden (for Saxon Governments must interfere in matters with wKich they haA'e no possible moral or political right to meddle) for any person to give any funereal feast, or indeed for any one class to have a different coffin from another. Another odd custom with these coffin-bearers is, that Avhen young people are carried to the grave by the friends of the family, and they are unAvilling to receive any remuneration for the office, they are each pre sented Avith a lemon, decked with a sprig of rosemary, with the name of the dead person made out in black pins stuck into the rind of the fruit. This custom prevails at the present day mostly with old-fashioned people ; and it is usual for the bearers to cast the funereal citrons into the grave previous to the filling of it up. The symbol of the rosemary is, in a measure patent, but why a lemon should be given at such times, Ave cannot possibly conceive \u2014 especially in a country to which the lime-tree is certainly not indi- genous. The coffins ordained by the State (for the State, you see, must have a finger in everything) are always kept in stock at the dead-house of the cemetery. They are made of the rudest possible materials, and cost, upon an average, from 2 to 3 vol. l. M M"], [552, "530 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. thalers (6s. \u2014 9s.) according to size; and each of the carpenters and cabinet-makers take it in turn to supply the deficiencies as they occur, so that one or tAvo of the different sizes may be always ready. Such jobs are considered as the best Avork that a master wood-worker can meet with, seeing that he can entrust the making of them to his apprentices, and the deal boards out of which the coffins are made cost little or nothing. The expenses of funerals in Saxony are trifling when compared Avith those of om- own country. A poor person can be decently interred for 3 thalers, or 9s., and the richest burial hardly ever costs more than 35 thalers, or 5/. os. English. The cemetery belongs to the Stadt (town), and every inhabitant of the city has the right of being interred there for thirty years free of cost. Such things as fosses communes for the poor are utterly unknown in the land. The dig ging of the grave is the sole expense that falls upon the relatives, and this costs 20 groschens (2s.); Avhilst, if the friends of the dead Avish to buy the ground for perpetuity, the cost is but 10 thalers, or 1/. 19s. of our money, for the fee-simple. Among the poor of Thuringia the practice of sub scribing to the Kranken-und-Sterbe Kasse (literally, the \" Sickness and Death Fund \") commonly preA*ails. The cost of this is 15 pfennings (l^d.) a Aveek for those who wish to insure a thaler a week for tAvelve Aveeks during ftlness, and 20 thalers (3/.) to the famdy of the insured person, at time of death. One-half of the sum given has to be expended hi the cost of"], [553, "531 TO THE GRAVE. burial, and the other either in mourning or as the relatiA'es please. If, however, a person be so poor that his relatives cannot afford to pay for the expense of his being carried to the grave by the members of the Trade Corporations, the coffin is wheeled thither in a barroAv ; Avhilst if the Avretched creature dies in the poor-house, and the friends are so badly off that they cannot afford even the expense of a coffin, the body is sent to the University at Jena, there to be dissected by the medical students. This is a AA-rong against the helplessness of poA'erty which we cannot refrain from denouncing with the strongest possible indignation ; and Ave belieAre the custom prevails in no country in Europe but in this same semi-barbarous Saxony. With us, at feast, Ave admit that if there be father or mother, brother or sister existing to weep over the loss of a poor relative, it is the boimden duty of the State to see such a body decently interred; and it is only Avhen the corpse is unclaimed, and no family-feelings can be outraged, that our authorities believe they have a right, for the due education of medical men, and pre vention of the desecration of graA*es, to hand oA'er such unclaimed boches to the surgeon. In half-civilized Saxony, however, family ties and feelings are utterly ignored as regards the poor, and if the wretched creatures cannot raise 3 thalers to save tlieir relative from the surgeon's knife, they, avIio are the most superstitious and ignorant people, have to suffer pangs after the death of their parent, or the playfeftW of M ji 2"], [554, "532 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. their childhood, to Avhich the rich must be utter strangers. Indeed, we were assured by one of the very poor of Eisenach that such was theft dread lest they or their kindred should be left for dissection after death, that hardly a person, however indigent, abstains from subscribing to the \" Sickness and Death Fund,\" so that they may be spared the indignity of seeing their relatives carried from them in theft last moments, to be cut up at the medical schools of the Saxon universities. It is by no means pleasant to live in a small Ger man town ; for not only are you sure to hear of each death that occurs hi the city, but the town-bell seems to ring out its knell in the afternoon of almost every day of the year. In London, Avhere a death occurs every minute of every clay, the student hardly hears the bell, tolling for the many funerals that are for ever going on about him. In little Eisenach, hoAvever, Avhich is hardly bigger than the smallest metropolitan parish, the booming of the funereal notes seems to float through the air after almost every midday-meal ; and yet the city-bell is tolled only when some \" respectable \" corpse is about to be interred, seeing that it costs, for dead citizens to be honoured in such a manner, a couple of shillings, and for gentle folks to have a longer and louder peal, not less than a thaler. And long before the solemn sounds SAvell over the city, the quickened eye can tell that some poor creature is about to be consigned to its last resting-place by the swarnis of men Avho make"], [555, "TO THE GRAA'E. 533 their appearance in the streets in hats, which are Avorn chiefly on such occasions ; for it is the custom throughout Germany for the people generally, to wear ouly caps, or soft felt \" Garibaldi\" hats, or stiffer \"deer stalkers \" on eArery Aveek-day \u2014 hats being kept merely for Sundays, holidays, and funerals. The consequence is, that as such head-coverings are seldom used, a person requires but one in the course of his life ; and indeed, the self-same hat passes from father to son as though ft were some specially revered heft-loom of the family. At these Saxon funerals, therefore, the stranger is astonished at seeing such an assortment of hats as he never before Avitnessed in the course of his life. They are of all manner of antiquated shapes, and of finely-graduated shades of rustiness. You can almost trace the history of the fashions in such articles of attire, as you look upon the different odd forms of the hats there congregated. Some are as tall and perfectly cylindrical as though they Avere black chimney-pots worn on the head, and many are much bigger at the crown than the rim, looking more like black truncated funnels than chapeau\u00e6 of the present day. Almost all are either too small or too large for the Avearers ; some brims reaching doAvn to the eye broAvs, and others being perched on the very top of the forehead. But such is the mania among the Germans for hat-Avearing only on special occasions, that you have but to look out of your window and see the people- \u2014 one and all \u2014 gentlefolks and journey men \u2014 disfigured by their old-fashioned and rusty looking \" beavers \" to knoAV that something is astir :"], [556, "534 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. either a death, a christening, or a marriage, as the case may be. The services performed at interments are of different kinds, according to the means of the famdy of the deceased. The usual custom is, AA'ith those who can afford to pay the clergyman for his rhetoric, to have a speech pronounced over the grave \u2014 the length of such speech and the compliments paid to the departed, depending solely upon the amount of money wliich the Pfarrer receives. For a fimeral oration about five minutes long, 10 groschens, or Is., is usually given ; and for one a quarter of an horn- in length, 1 thaler 12 groschens, (or 4*. 2d.) is the cost, according to the clerical tariff of the country. But for a speech that extends OA'er thirty minutes at least, and in which the \\drtues of the deceased are painted in the most \\dvid and glowing colours, the Minister of the Gospel expects to receive not less than 2 thalers 25 groschens, or Ss. 6d. English; whereas, if the holy man is to receive nothing for his duties at the grave, he mumbles but the shortest possible prayer over the poor corpse, and then retires with the greatest possible alacrity \u2014 to the beer-house. After the so-called burial service, in winch turgid rhetoric made up of the commonest possible platitudes supplies the place of Biblical consolation and solemn prayer, it is usual for each of the relatives and friends to cast a handful of earth on the coffin \u2014 the grave being generally lined Avith green branches of fir, and the body lowered into it by (what strikes the foreigner"], [557, "TO THE GRAVE 535 as the most hideous part of the ceremony) female attendants.* We have before cited samples of the inflated advertisements which it is usual to insert in the news papers at the time of death in Saxony. Some persons, however, defer advertising until after the funeral has taken place, for then hardly any one omits to express his thanks publicly to all who haA'e taken part in the ceremony \u2014 from the minister to the coffin-bearers \u2014 as well as to those who bring flowers to decorate the coffin \u2014 and eA'en, in some instances, down to the idle crowd of spectators who generally throng to such scenes, when they hear that the burial is likely to be a grand one. We uoav proceed to present our readers with trans lations \u2014 word for word \u2014 of these, to us, peculiar funereal announcements ; for unless they are literally rendered, the English reader wdl have but a faint idea of the phraseology usual on such occasions ; and as they are thus given in an English chess, the Carlylean form of the language will not fail to strike all those aaIio peruse them.

OF THE SCHOOLS IN EISENACH. The schools of Germany are famous throughout Europe, and, we belieA'e, justly so. The genius of the German nation is essentially scholastic ; for that patience which is required for true pedagogic ex cellence the Deutschers possess to a remarkable degree. Indeed, time out of mind, historians have characterized them as \"patient Germans;\" and the superiority of their school-books and philosophic treatises, as well as the devotion of their Avhole life to one particular pursuit \u2014 however abstract or how ever insignificant (whether it be the study of meta physics, or philology, or the collecting of cock chafers) \u2014 is due simply to the assiduity, the plodding, and essentially one-ideaed character of tlieir natures. They are the tortoises, and the more lively nations of the earth, the hares, in the race for intellectual progress; and we have our doubts as to whether the ethnological \" slow-coaches \" do not, after all, as"], [562, "540 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. in the fable, distance tlieir more hasty competitors. True, they lack the originality, the invention, the spirit, the fire of English and Erench minds. They have never had any soul approximating to a Shak speare, a Bacon, a Newton, or even a Watt among them; nor, indeed, anyone comparable in Avit or humour to either Voltaire or Swift, Moliere or Butler (of Hndibras celebrity) ; but, on the other hand, how many wonderful critics have they given to the world \u2014 how many illustrious scholars \u2014 how many profound philologists and mythologists \u2014 Iioav many categorical system-mongers \u2014 how many dreamy metaphysicians \u2014 and how many indefatigable col lectors of insects, or pains-taking students of ani malcidar life. It is true, again, as a set-off to this, that the great achievements of printing and the Reformation we owe alike to Germany \u2014 triumphs that Avere almost coeval, and triumphs of such a kindred nature in their result (though utterly different in the qualities required for their consummation), that each Avithout the other would have been compara tively worthless \u2014 triumphs, too, that have clone more for the advancement of human nature than any other two new forms of thought or labour ever given to mankind. And yet these are the very forms from which Germany herself has reaped the least benefit of all the world \u2014 Germany now Avithout a newspaper press, and Germany iioav Avithout even a creed. Further, this very scholasticism which is the genius of the present Teutonic race (if, indeed, that can be called genius whicli, in its highest excellence,"], [563, "541 THE SCHOOLS IN EISENACH. is but the profundity of plodding), is, in our opinion, the real cause of the non-original, and non-inventive character of the present people. The three greatest men of our own nation \u2014 and, perhaps, the three greatest that the world ever saAv\u2014 owed their erreat ness merely to the overthrow of the schoolmen : Shakespeare, avIio created the romantic drama, in utter subversion of all the unities of time and place belonging to the unnatural drama of the classics ; Bacon, avIio demolished the old Aristotelian logic ; and NeAvton, avIio propounded a new system of celestial philosophy, and so put an end to all the absurd hypotheses of the pundits of old. In Germany, however, the young are trained to such a respect, if not reverence, for the pedagogue, that 3'our real Deutscher Avould sooner think of questioning the truth of Revelation than of doubt ing the rules he has learnt of the schoolmaster or the critics. Hence, he begins life trammelled, like a Wiekel-kind, with all kind of \u00e6sthetical, rhetorical, and philosophical bandages, in the shape of scholastic dogmata ; and, consequently, grows up with his mental functions crippled to such an extent with formulae, that he is unable to run alone for the rest of his days, or to dispense with the intellectual go-cart in Avhich he has always been taught to exercise his reason. Hoav different is a German schoolboy from an English one! A Teutonic youth indulges in none of those athletic games or sports Avhich constitute the pleasures of English lads, Avhen let loose from"], [564, "542 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. school. Cricket, boating, and even running and leaping, or riding, are comparatively unknown to them ; indeed, the peculiarity is, that in connection with none of the public schools of Saxony are there to be found such things as playgrounds, to which the youths can resort for indulgence in those boyish sports, Avhich Ave in England believe are as necessary for developing the activity and energy of the future men, as even the lessons during school are for the cultivation of their intellects. A German schoolboy's pleasures during holiday-time, on the contrary, so far from being diversions, are merely an itinerant extension of his scholastic studies. You will see him on the half-holidays, or in the A'acation time, Avith a gigantic green sandwich-box strapped to his back, on his way to the woods to collect plants, for the completion of his botanical collection; or else he has a long gauze net in his hand for the catching of but terflies, so that he may fill box after box at homeAvith every kind of impaled Sehmetterling ; or a walking stick, Avith a hammer, by Avay of handle, to it, where with to chip bits from the rocks, in order to add to the mineral fragments in his case of geological specimens. Indeed, there is hardly a youth but possesses a miniature museum of some sort or other, consisting either of tray after tray filled with every variety of impaled cockchafers, or else of huge brown-paper books, in which page after page contains some specimen of a compressed vegetable, in the form of a squashed leaf or flower. It is this continued pursuit, indeed, of one subject"], [565, "THE SCHOOLS IN EISENACH. 543 \u2014 that love of the pedantry of schools even among children (to the utter neglect of those sportive diversions whicli, as Ave said before, are requisite for training youths to habits of activity and energy in after-life), that tends greatly to give the German mind that one-ideaed character which, to more dis cursive Englishmen, often seems to have someAvhat the aspect of unconfirmed monomania about it. For no matter how learned a German may be upon one subject, he is as ignorant as the sapient pig Toby upon all matters but that one Avhich he has made his special study. Talk to the profoundest philologue in the country upon art, upon chemistry, upon politics, upon sanitary laws, or indeed upon the commonest affairs of every-day life, and you Avill find that he knows no more about them than the veriest chaw bacon in England; \u2014 Avords, and the affinity of languages from Slang to Sanscrit, he has made the sole pursuit of his life ; but beyond Avoids the Avonderfully-leariied man has positively not an idea in his brain. To such an extent is this division and subdivision of mental work carried out in Germany, that as the little girl, who is doomed to pass her days in making pins' heads, has no knoAvledge of pin pointing, and could not for the life of her make an entire pin, even though she has been some half-score years, may be, at the trade \u2014 so, Ave verily believe, that the pro found Coleopterist (to Avhom we Avere introduced some years ago at Coblenz), and avIio, Ave were assured, had been all his life studying beetles and cockchafers, would have been unable to converse, for five minutes"], [566, "544 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. together, with a man like Ehrenberg, the indefati gable investigator of animalcular life, avIio had thrown his Avhole soul into ditch water. Intellectually considered, the entire German race is but a nation of schoolmasters and scholars, they are always either learning or teaching ; and the Lord defend us from passing a quiet evening with a real live German professor, for he is a bore of the largest possible calibre \u2014 after the fashion of \" great guns \" in general. The profundity of his prosiness is posftiA'ely unfathomable. His skull is as full of soporific sporules as a poppyhead, and he is a spouting engine of forty-ass power at least. We would as soon think of reading \" Paradise Lost \" through at one sitting, or of perusing the collected edition of Mr. Spurgeon's sermons, as allowing that extremely -learned, and not-at-all-lively, old gentleman to pour his molten lead into our ears \u2014 after the fashion of the Avife who thus brought to an untimely end no less than seven Avretched husbands. Gracious Heaven ! Ave once made a voyage from Delft to Rotterdam in a Dutch canal boat ; and though the lonesomeness of that journey still remains imprinted as the dreariest of all spots \" in our memory's waste,\" Ave Avould rather submit to be draped through the entire length of the Avet highways of Holland, at the same tiresome speed, than be forced to traA*el over the ground in the \"fly wagon\" of a German philosopher's train of ideas. A grain of gold they say may be beaten out into almost acres of foil, till at length the opaque metal is rendered transparent as gauze ; and"], [567, "THE SCHOOLS IN EISENACH. 545 even so your true Dutch professor \u2014 Avith the view of making that clear Avhich he fancies must be obscure to ordinary vision \u2014 hammers away at the smallest part of his subject, till his elaboration is about as lively as a coffin-maker's clatter in one's ears, and till the minutest particle of thought is spread out into a whole sheet of the flimsiest possible matter ; and the big boy ends with blowing a huge bubble out of Avhat was merely froth at the outset. Like an actor, too, he can talk of nothing else but his oavu business; and as the English circus-folk abroad neArer see anything of the country or the people in which they live, beyond the petty circle of the ring where they have to perform, in the same manner your veritable Ger man pundit knows and cares nothing of the Avorld about him \u2014 outside of the little sphere of his oavii studies ; the happiness and advancement of his OAvn race, or the liberty and enlightenment of other races on the earth, being as nought to him compared AAdth \" progress \" in the knowledge of words, butterflies, cockchafers, or animalcules \u2014 according as he may have devoted his days to one or other of such studies. For what are men beside insects and infusoria, in the eyes of your profound German phdosopher ? But, we repeat, this love of pedagogy \u2014 this reve rence for mere scholastic forms and book learning (as contradistinguished from Avorldly wisdom), per vades the entire German people, more or less ; so that it is impossible to sit in a beer-house for five minutes' lon_r Avithout finding the conversation turn upon the VOL.

Either you will be informed, for the nine hundred and ninety-ninth time since your residence in the country, that it is the most difficult tongue on the face of the earth ; or else, that it contains so many thousand more words than English \u2014 a couple of statements that are alike untrue ; for not only is the Welsh \" Grammatik \" a hundredfold more complex than the German or even the Greek, but there are nearly double the number ot words in Webster's Dictionary that are to be found in Adelung's Worterbuch . Indeed, it is obvious that a language like English, wliich is made up of at least five others (the Celtic \u2014 the Latin \u2014 the Anglo- Saxon \u2014 the Scandinavian and the Norman) should contain more synonymous terms than a simple un mixed tongue, such as German is ; so that an English author has the poAver of writing in two entirely distinct forms of speech \u2014 Saxon-English or Latin-English \u2014 just as he pleases. \" How Avould you translate into Saxon-English,\" said an Oxford Professor, renowned for the Johnsonian character of his sentences, to Alfred Kemble, the great Saxon scholar, \"the Latin-English phrase 'the impenetrability of matter ' ? \" \" Why, sir, I should sa}1*,\" replied the translator of \" Beowulf,\" \" the un thoroughfareableness of stuff,\" and surely the two expressions are as fundamentally different in the radi cals used as the talk of the Aztecs from that of the Bosjies. Now, that this double mode of expression is not possible in a language whicli is comparatively pure and"], [569, "THE SCHOOLS IN EISENACH. 547 unmixed, like German, an Englishman is unpleasantly reminded, shortly after his residence in Deutschland, by hearing the laches speak in public of their \" sweat ing;\" there being no such synonym as \" perspiration \" to be found in that tongue. Indeed, it is OAving to this Avant of two different terms derived from diverse sources, to express the same idea, that the language of German ladies sounds often so utterly unladylike to English people. For Avhen, owing to the simplicity of the speech, it is impossible to choose between a coarse and a refined Avord for the same 'meaning \u2014 as with \" spit \" and \" expectorate,\" or \" smell \" and \" stink,\" or \" lie \" and \" story \" in English \u2014 it certainly does seem somewhat strong to English minds, at first, to hear a damsel in polite society tell a gentleman \" he's a liar,\" or talk of something \" stinking,\" in the most unblushing manner. Moreover, the very difficulty of the language, of which the Germans are so proud, is by no means a recommendation to our minds : and fine and striking as are many of the compound German words \u2014 as for instance, their term Show-holy (Seheinheilige), for hypocrite \u2014 Bunkelmdnner (men of darkness) for bigots \u2014 Harm-joy (Shadenfreude) for delight in the misfor tunes of others \u2014 Flitterwocke (literally the spangled week), for the Honeymoon \u2014 and Blind-work for delu sion or shoAV; nevertheless, it is but sorry gram matical foppery to be forced to read on in German literature, for Heaven knoAvs how many lines, before you come to the verb, Avhich is necessary to unlock N N 2"], [570, "548 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. the meaning of the whole long-Avinded sentence, and Avhich is, almost invariably, placed at the end \u2014 in affectation of the Latin form of composition.

The construction of the sentence above given, though written just upon a thousand years ago, is, as nearly as possible, that of our own language at the present day. At a later period, hoAvever, as in the Laws of King Edgar, it w\\\\l be found that the modern inverted German form had come into use. e.g. \" We l\u0153rath that evil Cristen man his beam to We order that each Christian man his children to Christendome georuliec wee/tig, and him Batemoster Christianity earnestly accustom, and him the Paternoster and Credon f\u00e6ce.\" and the Creed teach.

Tom Hood used to say that to digest a German dinner, in wliich the order of the courses is more or less reversed, you ought to stand upon your head ; and so with a profound German sentence like the above, an Englishman's brains require to be turned topsy-turvy in order to make head or tail out of it. Let us, however, endeavour to put the pieces of the disjointed puzzle into something like fitness ; and then see whether the German schoolmaster has not himself been so utterly lost in the maze of his own long-winded Avords, and got his thoughts so entangled in the complicated web of the literary mingle mangle, that \u2014 as with the tower of Babel itself \u2014 the ambitious structure is left unfinished, OAAdng to the confusion of the speech during the elaboration of it. \" The poAver of Time \u2014 and of Thought living and moving in the same \u2014 (formed upon the groundwork of a healthy bodily -constitution and physical welfare, and carried to the height of a religiously-moral and gene ral holy education), to ascend to that pure and sacred enjoyment and happiness in which all mankind should participate \u2014 the government of the ideas and the seeking after truth admit of being regulated, only just as little as the educating power and the practical part of the instruction in the mathematics of natural philosophy come to be mistaken.\" But even now that the words are arranged in something like the natural order of the thoughts, it is hardly possible to connect any meaning with the"], [573, "THE SCHOOLS IN EISENACH. 551 incoherent rubbish of such pure scholastic Blatherum skitc. In the first place, who ever heard of thought living and moving (lebenden and webenden) in any time? Then \" the power of time and thought to ascend to pure and sacred enjoyment and happiness \" is surely a choice specimen of Avhat the Germans themselves call Wortschwallerei (literally \" word-multitudinous ness,\" or rhetorical fustian) ; for Iioav can \" Time have power to rise to pure and holy pleasure ? \u2014 as Avell might we talk of Time going up in a balloon ! Besides, the sentence here is unfinished ; there is no verb to the noun : \" the poAver of time and thought to ascend to pure and holy enjoyment,\" says the grandiloquent Director Lorey. \" Well, what of it ? \" says the reader. \" What have you to predicate concerning this wonderful power ? \" inquire such as have some slight sense of reason and grammar in their pates.

For instance, in the first place we are told that the government of the ideas and the seeking after truth \" admit \" (lassen sich), the verb here being in the plural ; and then a line or two asterAvards Ave have \"the educating power and the practical part of the instruction comes to be mistaken\" (verkennen lassf), with the verb now in the singular. Moreover, the logic of the sentence is in precisely the same wild state of confusion as the grammar itself: e.g. \"the government of the ideas, &c, admit of being regulated only just as little as (ebensowenig als wie) the educating power, &c, comes to be misapprehended \" \u2014 whereas it is obvious that the sapient pig meant that the more the edu cating power comes to be misapprehended, the less does the government of the ideas admit of being enforced. With a fine perspicacity of expression, hoAvever, the schoolmaster says the very contrary to what he means \u2014 telling us that just as little as the one comes to be misunderstood, even so little does the other admit of being carried out.

And yet such learned nonsense is an essential form of that language which the scholastic books of Germany delight to tell you is the finest on the face of the earth ! ! We should remember, however, that the greater part of English is but German improved ; that is to say, German stripped of its grammatical foolery and absurd inflectional difficulties ; and hence, possessing all the natural force, without the scholastic trammels, of the modern Teutonic form of speech. We should bear in mind, too, that Enghsh is even something more than this \u2014 that it contains within itself a large __> proportion of the Norman vocabulary, besides many fine radical words that still bear evidence of the intermixture ot the Scandinavian and Celtic dialects with the rest.* What wonder, then, that English * The influence of the fine old Celtic languages, not only upon our tongue, but upon almost all the European forms of speech, is but little known to etymologists. German philologues indeed utterly ignore this source of verbal knowledge ; and yet there is no doubt that from Owen Pugh's Welsh Dictionaiy, together with that of the Gaelic Society, a deeper insight can be obtained into tho structure of the English, the Teutonic, and, indeed, the Latin and French languages, than through the Gothic, the Anglo-Saxon, the Icelandic, or by any other channel. In the knowledge of the origin of prefixes, affixes, and radicals, of course the greater part, if not the whole, of etymological science is contained ; and, as regards the former, Owen Pugh's dictionary enables us to discover that certain initial letters of supposed monosyllabic roots were originally prefixes, which, in the course of years, have become contracted into a single con sonant, e. g. : \u2014 Scribe, \u2014 Welsh, ysgriv, a writing, from criv, a mark, criviaw, to"], [579, "557 THE SCHOOLS IN EISENACH. should be destined, as it assuredly is, to become, ere many centuries are past, the universal language of cut, to grave, which latter term is connected with the Irish reabam, to rive, rip (Lat. rumpo, rupi). Here, then, we have indisputable evidence that scribe (Latin, scribere) is formed on the root of grace, groove, by the addition of the Welsh preposition ys. So again grave is in its turn formed on the radical rive, by the addition of the prefix go (Sax. ge). Shriek (Welsh, ysgrec) is from crccian, to croak, creak, and this too from rltyg, rough, hoarse. Slack (Welsh, yslac), from llac, loose, lax (Latin, laxus), llacian, to be slow or lag. Spike (Welsh, yspig), from pig, a sharp point, a peak, or pike. Slough (Welsh, ysluc) from llwc, a lake or pool. Spear (Welsh, yspar) from ber, a bar. Moreover, there cannot be the least doubt that the following words came originally from those to which they are here annexed, the addition of the initial serving as a prefix to modify the primary sense of the radical : \u2014 Slip from lapse.

Again, as an instance of the fundamental connection of the Celtic languages with the structure of the greater part of modern dialects, we may add that there is no word more common throughout the European tongues than that of devil, which is usually derived, through the Latin diabolus, from the Greek StajSiiXXu. This form of etymology, however, belongs to the old school, which was one of vague conjecture rather than profound research ; and was of about the same philological use as when Webster derived isinglass from the elements ice and glass (adding, \"probably from its resemblance to those two bodies \"), instead of from the German hausenblase, i. e. the bladder of the fish huso, or slurgeon. The ancient Irish, or Erse language, however, is the only one which enables us to resolve the word devil into its elements with the same etymological certainty as we can decom pound the term thunder-storm into the radicals storm and thunder in our own tongue In the Erse, the term diabhail signifies, wheu so decompounded, dia, the god, bhail, of the air; and it will be seen hereafter that the ancient Thuringians regarded the old Saxon god Thor (the Thunderer), in light of the Great Destroyer, or Evil One, of whom they ;t to cast a figure, or Popanz (literally, a bogie), into the ri- l1_ great rejoicing at the end of each winter.

Such schools may be conveniently grouped into three classes\u2014?, e. those appertaining to the State, to the city, or to private individuals. These, howeA'er, require to be severally distinguished according as they are intended for young men, for boys, for girls, or for mere children. The young men's schools are \u2014 first, the forest-school, or rather college, at which the youths, to Avhose care the culture of the Avoods is afterwards to be entrusted, are instructed in all the branches of science directly or indirectly connected Avith enlightened arboriculture, and of Avhich institu tion a more detailed account is given hereafter ; and, secondly, the Seminarists' Schule, as it is termed, or that designed for the completion of the education of such youths as purpose to become the future school masters in the toAvns and villages of the district ; the special course of instruction at the latter institu tion being of three kinds, \u2014 (1.) Bedagogic, Avherein the embryo teacher is impressed with a sense of the business, manner, and character of the schoolmaster proper, as well as of his relations to the pupil, and the tie which should subsist betiveen the pupil and himself; (.-2.) Methodic, in which he is made acquainted with the different modes of instruction, and the ex cellencies or defects of each \u2014 such as the systems of Pestalozzi, Eousseau, and others ; and (3.) Catechetic, or that in which he is instructed as to the best means"], [583, "THE SCHOOLS IN EISENACH. 561 of examining pupils by the mode of question and ansAver as to tlieir proficiency in the matters taught. Before entering either of these schools, the student has to pass a certain examination at some subordi nate public academy, where the course of instruction is designed to prepare him for the due understanding of those higher forms of learning which are to be brought under his cognizance at the more erudite in stitution. For the student at the forest-school, a certificate of qualification from either of the State grammar-) schools is considered to be sufficient ; for the pedagogic aspirant ft is necessary that he should have a voucher as to his having \" passed \" through the several branches of study at the \" Seku/idar Sehule,\" or, literally, the school AA'here the instruction is specially made secondary to that of the Seminarists' institution. Nor are these the only examinations requisite before either class of aspirants are thought competent to follow the A'ocation for which they are intended. For as the \"forest-practitioner\" (so the student at the forest-school is styled) has to prove his fitness for the care and culture of the woods by sub mitting to another such inquiry previous to becoming even a \" forest- assistant,\" and to a third and more stringent catechizing ere he can rise to the dignity of a forester-proper; so the would-be pedagogue must, at the end of his schooling at the Seminarists' insti tution, give proof of his qualification for the office of a public instructor by obtaining a pass from the examiners instituted for the purpose. But even then he is considered fit to practise only as an assistant vol. I. oo"], [584, "562 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. teacher ; and, after two years' probation at this branch of the business, he has to go through a third exami nation in order to obtain his diploma, as it were, to entitle him to pursue the vocation of a regular pre ceptor. It will be seen by consulting the table hereafter given that the course of instruction at the forest-school costs but 11. 19s. per annum, whilst that at the Semi narists'\" Institution is free. In this latter respect \u2014 in the care taken, as Avell as the facilities given, in order to obtain a class of preceptors at once naturady and educationally fitted for the task, by making the office open to any one who is disposed to qualify himself for the discharge of its duties, it must be confessed the Germans are far ahead of our oaa'ii countrymen ; but, as we have before said, it is in this scholastic element that the true genius of Germany lies. It Avill be seen, moreover, by reference to the same table, as to the matters taught at the several schools of the Thurin gian capital, that the students at the Seminarists' Institution are instructed not only in the subjects specially requisite for theft future calling, but have also lessons given to them upon the organ, violin, piano, and in thorough-bass ! The reason of this musical education being superadded to the other is because the schoolmasters of the several villages throughout Germany, are likeAA'ise the Cantors, or directors of the music, at the various village-churches. Hence, by the union of the tAvo offices, an extra good is attained, \u2014 the children at even the smallest and most remote rural schools being taught singing by"], [585, "THE SCHOOLS IN EISENACH. 563 one who is an educated musician. And thus a love of one \"of the most innocent, the most exquisite, and, at the same time, the most inexpensiA'e of Avorldly plea sures, comes to be diffused systematically throughout the country ; so that even those who are denied the means of participating in the more costly of human enjoyments have a source of refined delight opened up to them to Avhich our agricultural labourers, or the Avorking population even of our cities, are utter strangers. The other schools for young men are those for apprentices. These, like the Seminarists' Institution, are, Arery Avisely and munificently, made free. They are of two kinds : the \" free working-man s-school\" (frei Gcwerke-schule) and the \" free Sunday-school,\" which is for Avorking men also. The former is held at the Gymnasium thrice a-week : on Monday and Friday afternoons from one to three, and from six to eight ; and on every Sunday from seven till nine in the morning, and from one tdl three in the afternoon. An examination has to be undergone before entering this institution, as a proof of the proficiency of the pupil, in Avriting and the first rules of arithmetic (the \" four species \" as the Germans call them) ; after AA-hich the young Avorkman is instructed in Mathe matics, Geometry, DraAving, Perspective, and in de signing plans, as well as in the principles of construc tion and projection. Either to this, or to the free Sun day-school, every apprentice was, up to the beginning of 1863, bound by law to go from fourteen to eighteen years of age ; for he could not become a journeyman o o"], [586, "564 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. until he had obtained a good certificate from the teachers. But though the recent introduction of free trade has put an end to the compulsory part of the education, the free workman's-school still numbers as many as eighty pupils, to whom there are four teachers, receiving from 21/. down to 11. 19s. each per annum. At the Free Sunday-school, on the other hand, no such preliminary examination of the pupils either was or is required ; and thither all such apprentices AATere wont to betake themselves as were either unprepared for the scrutiny, or disinclined to avail themselves of the higher education, at the other school for artizans. At the Sunday-school, writing, reading, reckoning, and book-keeping, as Avell as religion, and natural philo sophy are taught from seven till nine every Sunday morning ; and though no examination was formerly required of the pupil on his entry here, eA'ery appren tice Avas bound to pass an examination in such mat ters, before leaA'ing the school or before being entitled either to take rank or receive wages as a \"journey man.\" Since the abolition of this laAv the free Sun day-school has declined rapidly ; for A\\diereas up to February in the present year there were as many as forty-five scholars in the second class alone, the num ber, since that elate, has dwindled down to twelve ; whilst the decrease in the first and third classes has been in nearly the same proportion. In the words of one of the teachers to us, \" the masters and the apprentices mistake Gewerbe-freiheit (liberty in trading) with Ldtr-freiheit (liberty in learning),"], [587, "THE SCHOOLS IN EISENACH. 565 so that master-tradesmen prefer, now that they are permitted to do so, to keep their apprentices in the shop Avorking for them rather than to send them to the school to study for themselves!' At the Sun day-school there are noAV only thirty-two scholars altogether, and to these there are three teachers, each in the receipt of 40 thalers (6/.) per annum. For common labourers or unskilled workmen, there is no free school Avhatever ; nor are they in the habit of attending any scholastic institution, other than the city academies, and that only till they are four teen years of age. Of the schools for boys, on the other hand \u2014 rather than for young men \u2014 there are three different kinds in Eisenach : the State Schools, the City Schools, and private schools. The State Schools are almost equivalent to Avhat avc term Grammar Schools. Of these there are two, called respectively, the Gymnasium, and the Real-gymna sium ; the one being more nominalistic in its cha racter, dealing with Avords and languages rather than things ; and the other principally realistic in its objects, attending more to the study of things than the Avords which stand for them. The Gymnasium proper is formed upon the basis of the old St. George's School, instituted by the Franciscan monks in the thirteenth century, and at which Martin Luther studied Avhile a currend-boy in Eisenach. At the beginning of the last \" year-hundred,\" how ever, the old monastic institution Avas formed into a Gymnasium, or \" Seminarium Theologicum,'' and still further expanded by the late Grand-duke Karl"], [588, "566 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Friedrich, whose name it now bears. The Beal- Gymnasium, on the contrary, is a comparatively-neAv institution, having been founded only as recently as 1848, in accordance with the growing impression that the old classical schools are hardly adapted to the scientific character of the age in which we live. It was, therefore, established with the AneAV of teach ing youths more science and less Latin and Greek than they had previously been in the habit of learning. At the Gymnasium proper the course of instruc tion consists of Latin, Greek, Hebrew, German, and French ; reckoning and ornamental writing ; mathematics, physics, natural history, and geogra phy; religion and biblical history; besides ancient and modern history, elocution, and singing. At the Beat- Gymnasium, on the other hand, the education comprises Latin, German, French, and English ; reckoning and ornamental writing ; mathe matics, natural philosophy, chemistry, natural history, and geography ; religion ; history, ancient and modern ; as Avell as drawing, singing, and gymnastic exercises. Both of these schools bear a high reputation, and Ave find, on reference to the last year's report of the Beal-schule that no less than twenty-five per cent of the scholars there are from distant places, some coming from France, and others from our own country ; and no wonder, since the cost of the education at this institution is but 2/. os. per annum, Avhile that at the Gymnasium proper ranges from 1/. 16s. to 21. 8s. the year; both of them being what are called day-schools, and the scholars having to board and lodge at some house in the toAvn. The"], [589, "567 THE SCHOOLS IN EISENACH. average expense of such board and lodging, however, may be taken at 12 thalers the month, or 144 thalers (21/. 12s.) the year; so that a really good education may be obtained at either of these institutions for even a less sum than is charged at the cheapest \" do-the-boys-hall \" in England.* * It should be borne in mind that, for the price above given, the board and lodging can hardly be expected to approximate to the ordinary English character; and to give our countrymen an idea of what the living is likely to consist of, at the price above named, we will here append the dietary table given in the pros pectus of Fraulein Moder's establishment, which is one of the principal boarding-schools for young ladies in Eisenach : \u2014 \" First Breakfast, at half-past 0 o'clock, consisting of coffee (probably without milk or sugar), or milk, and white bread (tho latter without butter). Second Breakfast, at 9 o'clock. \u2014 One or two slices of black bread and butter, or of black bread and fruit. Dinner, at half-past 1 . o'clock : consisting of soup, vegetables, and either bouilli or roast meat. This is changed at regular inter vals for \"meal-eating\" (Mehl-speisen) \u2014 such as light puddings, dumplings, or milk-soups \u2014 with preserves \u2014 but without any meat or vegetables at such times. .ifternoon Meal, at half-past 4. \u2014 Again black bread and butter, or black bread and fruit. Supper, at 7 o'clock : consisting of tea or soup, with black bread and butter, or light meat-eating (leichten Flcischspeisen). At this school \u2014 which, we repeat, is the principal institution for young ladies in the town, and where there arc some ten or twelve English girls, the charge for education and boarding is 200 thalers (30Z.) per annum, with 10 thalers (11. 10s.) extra if the boarder remain at the school during the four weeks holidays at Midsummer. This, however, is the price for Germans ; whilst the tariff for the English is raised to 000 thalers (or 45?.), but whether iu consideration of a more generous diet, we cannot say. We should add, however, in all fairness, that the institution was very favourably spoken of; and we know, from"], [590, "568 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Judging by the number of scholars, the i? _r./-school appears to be the most popular institution of the two ; for as the original Gymnasium is said to have had, some twenty years ago, more than double its present number of scholars, it will be seen by the before-mentioned table that the new Gymnasium, though not yet fifteen years old, has now upwards of twenty-one per cent, more pupils than its more classical rival. But, thou_.li the number of scholars at the ancient institution have declined, the number of its professors and teachers still remains the same as when there were twice as many boys to teach ; because, it is said, the charter of its foundation expressly enjoins the maintenance of such an educa tional staff; so that thus we have the monstrous anomaly of not less than 13 teachers at the one institution for the instruction of only 108 scholars, and but 8 professors at the other for as many as 131 boys. Such are the State Schools of Eisenach ; those, on the other hand, belonging to the city are of three kinds, though all are incorporated in one and the same institution: (1.) The Sekundar Scltule, as it is called, or literally that whicli, as aa*c have before ex plained, is intended to serve as a secondary establish ment to the Seminarist Institution, or, in other words, to act as a preparatory school to it; (2.) the our own experience, that the mistress was as highly esteemed by her pupils as her system of education was praised by the Pro fessors in the town."], [591, "THE SCHOOLS IN EISENACH. 569 first Citizens'-school ; and (3.) the second Citizens' school. At the secondary school the course of instruction consists of German grammar, composition, and elocu tion ; arithmetic and ornamental writing ; geometry, natural philosophy, and chemistry ; natural history and geography ; religion and biblical history ; ancient and modern history ; besides singing, music (violin and piano), and drawing, the cost for the AAdiole being but six thalers (18s.) per annum. The number of scholars at this institution Avas 108 in the year 1832-63, of whom 60 were Seminar-aspiranfen, or embryo schoolmasters ; while the remaining 4S pupils were youths who were principally intended to act as clerks in. some merchant's office, or as shopmen in some warehouse, and who consequently thought it advisable to protract their studies somewhat beyond the ordinary routine of the citizens' schools. At the first, and even the second Citizens'-school, the education is very nearly the same as at the Sekundar Schule, the difference consisting not so much in the subjects taught as in the advanced character of the studies in such subjects. In neither of these schools, however, are the pupils instructed in instru mental music ; whilst in the second Citizens'-school Natural Philosophy and Chemistry are dispensed with. The main distinction, indeed, between the first and second Citizens'-schools is merely one of price ; at the former institution, the charge being 9s. yearly, and at the latter only from 3s. to -Is. Gd. ; so that the scholars belong in the one case to the richer class of burghers, whereas in the other they are the sons of"], [592, "570 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. the poorer toAvnspeople. Hence Ave can readily under stand Avhy there should be only 280 boys in the first school, and as many as 350 in the second one. The teachers at these schools are of course far greater in number than those employed in the State schools, but they are, on the other hand, of a less distinguished character, being, for the most part, schoolmasters proper, who have received merely the education of ordinary Seminarists ; whereas the pre ceptors at the gymnasium institutions are generally doctors-of-law, aa*1io have taken their degree at the University, and Avho, in some cases, as a mark of their superior attainments, have been allowed to prefix the more honourable title of Professor to their names. Nevertheless, the English reader wdll, on casting his eye down the fourth column of the subjoined table, be astonished to note how small a sum in Germanv is thought not only a sufficient recompense for so many years' study, but a sufficient income to maintain even a Professor as a gentleman. The director at the Gymnasium, it will be seen, receives 1S0/., and the Professors, upon an average, only 75/. a-year; whilst at the Eeal-Gymnasium the director gets 15S/., and the other professors mostly 60/. per annum. At the City schools, hoAvevei', the teachers are paid, mostly, at the rate of 37/. 19s. every year (which is about the wages of an English dustman) ; Avhilst at the first and second Citizens'-school the director, who has to superintend both institutions, as Avell as the secondary school, has a salary of 911. 19s. annually, and the teachers are in the receipt of sums varying from 60/., cIoavii even to 30/. a-year."], [593, "TIIE SCHOOLS IN EISENACH. 571 One would imagine that in a country where a tolerably sound education can be obtained for the small sum of 3s. to 4s. 6d. per annum, such things as \" free schools \" Avould hardly be required ; but such is the poverty of the poor in Eisenach, that even three farthings a-Aveek for the education of their children is found to be too large an outlay for the wretched Avorking-people to bear ; so that as all are bound by law to send their boys and girls to school immediately they are six years old, the authorities, to enable the poorer classes to comply with the injunctions of the State in this respect, have been compelled to found a Free school, where the children of those who have not even a pfenning to spare beyond Avhat is required for keeping body and soul together, may be educated gratuitously. At these free schools the course of instruction is the same as at the second Burghers' school, and there are altogether some 200 scholars (boys and girls included) attending them. It AviU be seen, on reference to the table before mentioned, that the total number of scholars attend ing the several schools of Eisenach is upwards of 2000 ; but many of these are students at the forest schools, and youths at the Seminarist Institution, as well as apprentices studying at one or other of the working-men's school, and Avho are consequently above the ordained scholastic age \u2014 which is legally fixed at from six to fourteen years ; while the little children at the \" Kiuder-gartens,\" on the other hand, are too young to come within it. If, then, we exclude all such from the calculation, as well as the boys and girls attending the clraAving-schcol,"], [594, "572 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. we shall find that the gross number of children in Eisenach, between the ages of six and fourteen, is, as nearly as possible, 1900, and then dividing this by the 200 poor boys and girls in the free schools, Ave arrive at the conclusion that between one-ninth and one-tenth of the population are so poor that they cannot even afford to spare three farthings a-Aveek for tlieir children's education. At this free school there is but one paid teacher, (avIio gets only 22/. 10s.) to the entire 200 scholars; for the elder of the seminarist-studt nts have to give their services to it gratuitously\u2014 a plan by Avhich a double good is effected ; the poor being thus educated at the cheapest possible rate, and the embryo schoolmasters grounded in the practical rudiments of their profession. There still remains one other gratuitous scholastic institution to be mentioned \u2014 an institution open, Avithout cost, to girls as well as boys, i. c. the free Brawing-school. This was sounded, and is still main tained, by funds provided by the late Grand-duchess. None are bound by law to attend this school, never theless many boys and girls are sent thither by their parents on the half-holidays, to take advantage of the benefits it so generously affords. The hours of attend ance are from 10 to 12 in the forenoon for boys, and from 1 to 3 in the afternoon for girls, on every Wed nesday and Friday \u2014 the number of pupils being 35 boys and 25 girls, or 60 altogether, be.Aveen the ages of 9 and 1 5 years ; and the Professor receiving a salary of 300 thalers (45/.) for his services. At this school the pupils are instructed in Avhat is called \"free-hand draAving.\""], [595, "THE SCHOOLS IN EISENACH. 573 There now remains but one other kind of boys' school to be mentioned, and that is the private one maintained by the lews, for the education of tlieir children in their own religion as Avell as in the HebreAv language. This school, hoAvever, may be regarded more as a separate class for special instruction, appended to the City schools, than as a distinct academic establish ment ; for the youths attending it go to the Burgh ers'-school as well \u2014 where they receive the greater part of their education \u2014 and are merely taught by the Jewish preceptor such matters in their over time as none but one of tlieir own persuasion could instruct them in. The boys at this school are all hoarded and lodged in the house of the master ; for they are mostly the children of Israelites, avIio reside at some distance from the toAvn, and avIio are anxious to secure for their sons the advantages of an education at the Eisenach seminaries, in conjunc tion with private instruction in their oavii creed. The charge here is 100 thalers (15/.) the year, AA'hile the number of scholars is but nine ; so that one cannot help Avondcring not only what can possibly be the profit got out of so small a sum, but Iioav anyone can manage to live upon the gains of merely nine big boys, AA*hose keep alone one would imagine to cost more than the amount charged. The JeAvish schoolmaster, however, has several perquisites where with to eke out his income. He is also, strange to say, the JeAvish butcher for the Israelites domiciled in the city, and receives a matter of ten groschens for every ox he slaughters, besides so many pounds of the meat gratis, as Avrell as a groschen for every"], [596, "574 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. pair of foAvls he has to decapitate. Moreover, he is the officiating minister at every circumcision, and has to be present, as assistant to the Rabbi, at every Jewish wedding occurring in any of the toAvns or villages round about ; so that, what with the mar riages and the births \u2014 the circumcisions \u2014 the cutting off the heads of cocks \u2014 and the slaughtering of bul locks, the poorly-paid Jewish preceptor is, after all, a Avell-to-do man. Let us add, too, in all justice, that we never knew a worthier individual ; nor one Avith such a heart \u2014 Avith such a nose. The girls' schools will require but a brief notice at our hand. These are mostly City schools, of which there are three in number. First comes the one absurdly styled \" The Higher Daughters' School \" (die hbhere Toclttcrscli/ile), the said \" higher \" young ladies being, for the most part, the children of pretentious publicans or chandler's-shop keepers, who consider the girls at the ordinary City schools too common for their daughters to associate with. At this school there are seventy pupils and nine teachers, the salary of the director being 67/. 10s. and those ofthe teachers (the majority of whom are men) 41/. 5s. per annum ; whilst the cost of the instruction is but 21. os. a-year. For this sum the pupils are taught German, French, and English ; Arithmetic and Writing ; History and Geo graphy ; Eeligion and Biblical History, as well as singing, music, and needle Avork. Secondly, there are the girls' classes at the first and second burgher-schools, at which the education costs the same as for the boys, viz. 9s. per annum in the first school, and from 3s. to 4s. 6d. a-year in the"], [597, "THE SCHOOLS IN EISENACH. 575 second one. The course of instruction here is very nearly the same as for the boys, Avith the exception that the lessons in Geometry, Natural Philosophy, Natural History, and Chemistry, are dispensed with, and such feminine work as seAving, knitting, and embroidery, substituted for the more masculine acquirements. No instrumental music, however, is taught, but only singing ; for, as we have elsewhere said, it is quite as unusual to meet Avith a German lady avIio is able to play any instrument, as it is to know an educated gentleman who is not master of some two or three. The only other girls' school is the private esta blishment of Fraulein Mocler, of Avhich Ave have before incidentally spoken. Here the instruction consists of the German, French, and English languages, and Literature ; Arithmetic, and Writing ; History and Geography ; Religion and Biblical History ; Drawing, Modelling, and Gymnastics ; besides nature-know ledge (Naturkunde) and the principles of health (Gesundheitslehre) ; music and singing, however, being extra. At this establishment there are twenty and more young ladies, the half of whom are English, and mostly from Manchester. There are no regular teachers, with the exception of Fraulein Moder her self, in connection with the institution ; but the best of the Professors from the principal schools are in the habit of attending there to give so many hours' lessons in the course of the week. The cost of the schooling, Avith board and lodging, we repeat, is 30/. a-year to German ladies, and 40/. a-year to English ones; with 1/. 10s. extra for those avIio stay at the"], [598, "576 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. school during the four weeks' holidays at Midsummer. -Moreover, every young lady is expected to bring with her, on entering the establishment, the folloAving stock of furniture, linen, and other articles : a chest of drawers ; a bedstead, bedding and bed-linen, com plete, Avith a quilted counterpane and \" Staubdecke\" (a holland coverlet to protect the bed from dust in the daytime) ; 1 2 hand-towels ; 1 2 table-napkins ; a case containing a knife, fork, and table-sjioon ; 1 tumbler ; 1 cup with teaspoon ; 1 umbrella ; and 2 black aprons with bibs ! ! ! The only remaining scholastic institutions \u2014 if indeed so pretentious a title can seriously be applied to what are public nurseries rather than seminaries \u2014 are the Kinder-gar tens, so common throughout Germany. Though the German title of these infant schools means literally children's gardens, there never is, so far as avc knoAV, any such pleasant place in con nection with them ; and hardly even a playground such as is peculiar to English academies. For the only open space for the sports of the little things at the Eisenach infant school was a narrow fore-court leading to the \"Children's Protection Institution \" \u2014 as the Kinder-garten belonging to the city is some- Avhat pompously styled. The \" institution \" itself, in deed, consists merely of a ground-floor containing one not-particularly-large room, a small sleeping-chamber where the younger children are put to sleep after their dinners, and a kitchen where the bread is made. In the larger room, which is about the size of a board-room at a workhouse, some 150 children, of"], [599, "THE SCHOOLS IN EISENACH. 577 from four to six years of age, have to pass the entire day, AA'hen the weather does not admit of their games, their exercises, or their singing being carried on in the open air ; for they are brought hither at seven in the morning, and not taken home till the same hour in the evening. The charge for the superintendence of the little ones is positively c-normous \u2014 in the literal sense of the word ; for assuredly it is contrary to all rule in England, that a child should be taken care of for 12 hours every day, and have its dinner supplied to it, as well as bread morning and evening, at the cost of the twelfth ef a farthing per weeks \u2014 or rather more than a penny per quarter. The dinner, Iioav ever, consists of soup furnished by the public soup-kitchen, which is supported by \" chari table donations,\" and the bread is obtained in a like eleemosynary manner. At the City Institution there are two female teachers, who instruct the children in the first rudiments of reading, writing, and reckoning \u2014 the positive schooling being limited to one hour per diem, and the rest of the time de voted to either singing, or marching, or else in play ing round-games, or knitting. Moreover, some of the children who are sent to the school without stockings are supplied with \"hose\" that have been knitted by the elder scholars ; and usually in the course of each day some one or other of the patronesses of the institution visits the place to see that the young ones are properly tended. The other Kindergarten, however, is a more expensive and genteel \" establishment,\" the charge VOL. I. Pp"], [600, "578 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. here being as high as 6./. per week ; but for this sum the children are provided Avith toys also \u2014 the method of instruction and training being nearly the same. No dinner, however, is supplied here, the young ones being taken home for their meals, and the hours of attendance being only from 9 till 12, and from 2 till 4. The \" Garten \" here consists of two small rooms on a first floor, where are generally to be found some 25 little boys and girls, either chanting infantine verses, or building houses out of tiny wooden-bricks ; or else arranging kaleidoscopic patterns out of bits of coloured paper, or making baskets out of perforated cardboard or of coffee berries, cloves, and rice ; and, indeed, doing a hundred and one odd things to keep them at once in order and out of mischief. The children attending at this more expensive establishment are mostly the boys and girls of such citizens as have either no servant, or else merely a maid-of-all-Avork, whose time is too much occupied to attend to the younger branches of the family ; while at the poorer institution they are principally the children of working-people \u2014 either artisans or day labourers \u2014 whose wives are often out at work all day, and even when at home too busy washing or scrubbing to be able to give heed to tlieir own offspring. These public nurseries may be good enough for patching and cobbling a defective social machinery ; but there can be no doubt that the state of society is radically bad Avhich requires some such special"], [601, "THE SCHOOLS IN EISENACH. 579 appliance to carry out those duties to children, which a mother in a rightly-constituted nation shoidd be able and expected to perform herself. Such Kinder gartens are exotics which, Ave are glad to find, do not flourish in the temperate climate of our country. Tltere, at least, the wives of working-men are not yet forced to go out the day long labouring as hard as their husbands for \" dear life,\" and mothers not yet com pelled to hand their children over to the State to be tended and nursed, if not suckled, by the old women authorities \u2014 rather than to be fondled and fostered by the loAdng soul, Avhose A*ery form is sufficient to assure us that such was intended to be her special office. In Germany, however, children are brought up as if they Avere so many chickens hatched by steam, and as a boiler can supply the place of the hen in a Avell-regulated Eccaliobion, so in the fatherland the mother is dispensed with as a useless institution, and children taken in to \" dry nurse \" by the old- grandmother rulers of the country. With this introduction Ave AviU uoav proceed to set before the reader a tabular vieAv of the several edu cational statistics of the Thuringian capital. This has cost us some time to draw out, but the facts and fisrires have been derived from the best sources, so that the information it supplies, as to the extent of the scholastic machinery of this one city, may be of some sendee in enabling the reader to comprehend how great is the love of schools and schoolmen throughout Germany. p p 2"], [602, "580 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS.

At the City Schools, however, the hours in the after noon are only from 1 till 3 ; at Fraulein Moder's they are from 8 till 12 and 2 till 4, and at Fraulein Trabart's Kinder-Garten from 9 till 12 and 2 till i. At the Forest School the attendance is from 7 till 9 and 10 till 12 in the morning, and 2 till 5 in the afternoon ; and at the Seminarist Institution from si till 10, and 1 till 3.

At the Kinder- Bewahr Anstalt (the Children's Protection Institution) the little things are kept all day, from 7 till 7. The Holidays consist of two half -holidays (Wednesday and Saturday afternoon) every week, and generally of four weeks at Midsummer, one week at Christmas, and the same at Easter, Whitsuntide, and Michaelmas. At the Forest-School there are two vacations of a month each ; the one from April to May, the other from September to November. At the Kinder-Garten for the poor people, on the other hand, there are no holidays whatever. The Rewards consist sometimes of books presented to the more deserving pupils.

Examinations. \u2014 There are seldom any \"examens\" to be made on entering the schools, the rule being generally for the new scholar to come provided with a certi ficate from some preparatory establishment. On leaving, however, such examina tions are often required. At the Forest-School, for instance, it is essential that the Forst praetikant should \"pass\" a three-day examen in mathematics and natural philosophy before he can become a forest-helper. So, too, at the Seminarist Insti tution. A State examination must be made before the Seminar-aspirant can occupy the post of assistant-teacher. At the State -Schools, again, it is necessary for the scholar to pass an examination in certain cases ; for without having done this at the Gymnasium or Real-Gymnasium he would not be received at the University or the Forest-School, or allowed to fill any Government situation. By tiie above table we perceive tbat tbere are alto gether 2347 scholars distributed throughout the schools of Eisenach, and 80 teachers and professors, which is at the rate of just upon one schoolmaster to every thirty boys. Now, the population of Eisenach is about 13,000 \u2014 so, dividing the one by the other, we find that tbe gross number of scholars to the people, is in the ratio of 1 to every 5*5, or 18 per cent, of the entire inhabitants \u2014 which is assuredly a very high rate of education. Throughout tbe entire Grand-duchy of Saxe Weimar the proportion of scholars to people is 1 to every l'o of the population, or only about 13 per cent. ; whereas in England the rate given by Mr. Horace Mann in tbe Census of 1851 (we have no other returns at hand) is 1 day scholar to every 8\"3G of our folk, which is not quite 1.2 per cent. While, therefore, only 12 per cent, of our people are at school, as many as 13 per cent, of the Saxe-Weimar folk are being educated, and not less than 18 per cent, of tbe inhabitants of Eisenach. But, despite all this education, we are satisfied, as we said before, that an English mechanic, who can"], [606, "584 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. just manage to read his Sunday newspaper, is a more handy, a more inventive, and a more worldly-wise man than the most learned German professor we ever encountered in the Thuringian capital.* * In Germany every child must be at school from /ix to fourteen years of age. This is part of the law of the country, ami the father who neglects to comply with it, as soon as his son or daughter has entered his or her seventh year, is imme diately summoned before the Vorstand (the committee) of the city schools, and examined as to the reason of his chi'd's absence. If the excuse he sickness or weakness on the part of the little one, permission, maybe, is given for it to remain at home for half-a-year longer ; for the law is not very stringently enforced up to that age. Then, however, a doctor's certificate must be produced, and if that cannot be done, the parent who still neglects to comply with the injunction is im prisoned, at first for four days, and for the second offence from a fortnight to a month ; after which the dereliction is treated as a criminal offence, and the man tried and punished accordinglj*. If it be the desire of the parent to have his son or daughter educated at home, then a certificate must be produced from some teacher -who has passed his examination, in order to show that the child is being privately educated by a duly-qualified person. If, on the other hand, the father dissent from the established religion of the country, and is unwilling to have his children educated in doctrines which he believes to be either false or foolish, then the religious part of the education can be dispensed with. We made some inquiries as to whether parents were ever found to violate such laws ; and we were credibly informed th?t there never was known a case of a father persistently refusing to have his child educated. In the free-school, how ever, it often happens that the children are sent out to beg for two or three days together by their parents, and thus kept away from school for a certain time. Such offences are generally punished with the imprisonment of the father or mother (if she he a widow) of longer or shorter duration, as the case may be. Sometimes*, too, boys stop away from school, of their own accord, for several days together, unknown to their"], [607, "585 THE SCHOOLS IN EISENACH. parents. For such misconduct they are beaten by the school servant with a stick, this being the only offence for which cor poral punishment is inflicted ; and for the second offence they are locked up in the \" Career,\" or prison-cell, and kept there from two to four clays, upon merely bread and water. The legal age for leaving school is stated at fourteen years ; if, however, the pupil be so little advanced in his studies, cither from inordinate indolence or stupidity, then the masters of the school have power to fo''ce him to continue there until his sixteenth year. If, however, such be the law throughout Germany \u2014 that every child must be at school between the age of six and four teen years \u2014 how comes it, the cunning reader will ask, that there can be a greater proportion of children in the course of education in one part of the country than in another \u2014 as, for instance, in Eisenach, where the ratio is as high as 18 per cent., whilst that for all Saxe-Weimar is but a little more than 13 per cent. ? The explanation is, that cither there are more children receiving private instruction at home, or else that the children themselves are more numerous in comparison with the rest of the popula tion\u2014a number of strangers being sent thither to be educated. Hence we see that, though the educational returns for England and Wales show that there is barely 1 '2 per cent, of the population at school in our country, we are, nevertheless, in no position to judge accurately as to whether education is less general in Eng land than in Saxe-Weimar \u2014 until we know whether the ratio of the young to the adult population is the same in both countries, and whether private tuition is carried on to the same extent in both. From our own experience, we should say that governesses and tutors are in England far more general than in Ger many ; for we heard only of one family having such additions to their household in Eisenach, whereas with us the daughters even of professional men are mostly thus educated."], [608, "CHAPTEB II. OF THE MODERN CURREND SCHOOLS IN EISENACH. One of the most pleasant associations (as well as one of the most interesting, on account of its forming so marked an epoch in the history of Martin Luther's early life) connected with the town of Eisenach, is the Cm-rend School, which still exists there, and whose scholars to this day chant then- hymns in tbe streets every Sabbath morning ; while the smaller Currend boys, in their long cloaks, and the big old-fashioned hats which make them look like little old men, still rattle tbeir tin padlocked money-boxes, and intone their cry of \" Coo-o-or-end ! \" in the balls of the different houses of the town, in tbe hope of obtain ing a farthing or two hi return for the chorals they have sung in tbe streets before daylight. Indeed, if tbe ugly, dirty Thuringian capital could be stripped of its Lutheran associations \u2014 if little Martin had never begged his bread in its narrow tumble-down streets \u2014 if Dame Ursula had never taken the starveling boy to live with her in the very house that is still to be found in a bye-corner of the \"Wednesday's market-place,\" \u2014 or, if in after-life, when Luther had fought the battle of Protestantism almost"], [609, "THE currend schools. 587 to the point of death before the world's j.relates and magnates at Worms, he had never been secreted as \" Junker Georg\" in the little room of the \" Bitters haus\" at the Castle of the Wartburg (as if the Thuringian capital bad been destined to be the place that should give shelter to the great Liberator of mankind twice at the most eventful periods of bis life) : if there were no such associations as these in connection with the dingy, old, and now-utterly-in bospitable city, the place would be as forsaken as a German bath in the winter-time ; for the avaricious townsfolk have lapsed into little better than a horde of plundering Arabs, who, though they may give salt and bread to tbe stranger, think it by no means necessary to abstain from robbing him at the very first opportunity. By far the most delightful recollection we have in connection with the city, is that of being waked up before daylight on the day after our arrival there, and hearing these same Currend boys chanting out side om' hotel, one of their Sabbath carols in the dark ness. We had come expressly to the town to make ourselves acquainted with the several places upon which Martin Luther had conferred a glory. We had arrived too late in the evening, and too tired, to be able to find out overnight the \" Cotta-house \" as it is called to this day. We had only seen the Castle of the Wartburg in the dusk of the sunset, capping the steep conical mountain on one side of the city ; and we had gone to bed dreaming of the long-reve renced objects that were to be revealed to our eyes on"], [610, "588 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. the morrow. We had forgotten all we had read of the Currend scholars and their songs in the streets at early dawn, and we were aroused, before daylight, by a sound of a choral in the air that stirred us more deeply than any music we had ever listened to. Music at all times, when the mind is at rest, has somewhat of a celestial character connected with it, to those who will allow themselves to be absorbed by the measure\u2014 especially if the tune be of a plain- tive or sacred character ; for the soul is entranced, as it were, by such strains, and transported far away beyond earthly things and worldly cares. Music on the water, when the air is still, and the shades of nij>*bt begrin to draw tbe curtains of heaven round about the earth, has always charms of the most exquisite kind to any thoughtful or emotional na- ture ; but music in the dead of the night, when the hubbub of trade and commerce and the strife of man's greed, have ceased for a while ; when tbe streets are quiet as a ruin ; when all are wrapped in slumber, and as still as death for tbe time being, and when every house is as silent and dark as a tomb ; when the stars are twinkling through the grey firmament, as though they were so many angel-eyes watching over us \u2014 music, and more par ticularly sacred music, heard while the mind is half asleep and half awake, has something almost super natural and seraphic in its character : so that when this same Currend choral sounded for the first time in our cars, we had to rub our eyes before we could assure uursi Ives we were not listening to the chanting"], [611, "THE CURREND SCHOOLS. 589 of some angelic choir as we lay dozing in our bed. And when we had made out to ourselves that the chanting must be that of the very \" Currend boys \" whom we had come so many miles to listen to ; and remembered too that they were reminding us, as of old, that the Sabbath day had arrived, we blessed the little fellows for turning our thoughts in so sweet and graceful a manner from earth and its daily troubles to Heaven and its eternal peace. Now, many a reader knows that we have no Puritanical notions as to the observance of the Lord's day, and that we believe the Sabbath was designed, not as a day of merely prayer and aus terity, but as a day of rest from labour, as a day of thanksgiving, and as a day, indeed, on which worldly greed is to cease, and innocent home-happiness is to be indulged in. If the reader thinks otherwise, if he believes the great mass of the labouring popu lation are to be pent in close thoroughfares and workshops for six days in the week, and that it is a sin for them to be allowed to breathe the fresh air of the country, after the time of thanksgiving on the seventh ; if he thinks that the rest of rational crea tures should be the same brute repose as Moses en joined for the ox and the ass, rather than the harm less delights of recreation\u2014 then the reader and the writer are as wide asunder as the poles. Did not Christ himself suffer principally for breaking this same Jewish Sabbath \u2014 for walking in the fields on that day, and plucking the ears of corn by the way ? Is it not a matter of history, too, that the first edict"], [612, "590 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. which appeared under the Christian dispensation, ordering all persons to abstain from labour on the Sunday, was not promulgated till 300 years after the birth of tbe Saviour, when the Emperor Con stantine originally issued such a decree ? Moreover, in the JSsew Testament there is no trace of any such Sunday observances having been enforced by the early Christians ; and is it not there recorded that when the Jewish Sabbatarians, and others who had been converted to the new creed, consulted the Aj.os tles as to the keeping of tbe Sabbath, a special council was held at Antioch to settle the point ; and there, in full conclave, the disciples decided that each was free to do as he pleased in the matter, and that Sabbatarianism was no more essential than circum cision to Christianity ? Nevertheless, the writer is ready to admit that he wishes to see no such disrespect of the Sabbath in his own country as is to be found throughout the entire Continent of Em-ope. In France labour never ceases, for the shops, and most of the works are carried on uninterruptedly up to the afternoon on the Sunday \u2014 at least, they were so when we lived in the French capital. In Protestant Germany, again, the shops are closed merely during the brief bom's of divine service, and kept open as long as the tradespeople please afterwards. True, work is for bidden, under fine, on the Sabbath * nevertheless, work invariably goes on in every workshop up to noon, and the apprentices and journeymen are expected by tlieir masters to labom- for them until"], [613, "THE CURREND SCHOOLS. 591 that time. Moreover, gambling and card-playing in the beer-houses on the Sunday evening are by no means interdicted. Tbe Grand Duke, too, comes to open the fan.- of the shooting-feast on the Sabbath ; the clergymen themselves go to dance at the principal balls which are given on the Sunday ; and the un seemly riots and extravagant fooleries of masquerades seldom or never occur at any other time. Still, we think it possible to adopt a medium course of action; and while we admit that rest is necessary, and thanksgiving merely a decent duty for one day in tbe week at least, surely we can acknow ledge at the same time tbat harmless recreation is the most enlightened form of rest which the Creator has instituted \u2014 the repose of tbe ox and tbe ass being as utterly unworthy of rational creatures as the wild revelry and riot of Bacchanals differ from wise relaxa tion ; or even as the long faces of the Bharisees and the praying at the corners of public streets, \" so that they may be seen of men,\" are totally opposed to the true and cheerful spirit of the Christian religion. After this brief confession, let us add that the Sabbath has, to our mind, a sacredness beyond the obsolete Mosaic law \u2014 a sacredness arising from the very necessity for rest and recreation among human and brute nature, as well as for teaching men that there are duties and \"enjoyments in life far above those of commerce and gain ; and for leading the most insen sate minds to think, in the cpiiet and repose of the one weekly holiday, as to how much tlieir struggle and scramble after the world's wealth will avail them"], [614, "592 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. when a few more years have passed over their head. We have a special respect for the Sabbath, moreover, as being the one day in the week when families are knit closer together, and the home affections are allowed to have that play, in the absence of all worldly care, which they never could know were every day alike, and the struggle to live carried on without ceasing, even to the Sunday. And it was this innate love of this same halcyon Sabbath that made us bless those little Currend boys of Eisenach, who taught us, in the sweetest possible manner, before the light of the stars was quenched in the heavens, that the day of rest had come round, and that the chafing of human passions was to cease for a few hours at least. There are at the present time some sixty of these currend boys connected with what is called the \" Second Burgers' School \" of Eisenach. Thirty of these are from fifteen to twenty years old, while tbe ages of the remainder vary between fourteen and ten, and even less. The cm-rend scholars form part of the church choirs, and are educated in singing so as to be able to take part in the services at the two princi pal churches in the town. One half of the boys \u2014 \u25a0 fifteen of the younger and fifteen of the elder boys \u2014 sing hymns and chorals every other Sunday (though formerly it was customary for the youths to do so twice and even thrice in each week) be tween the hours of five and six in the morning \u2014 winter and summer, snow or wind ; heavy rain alone"], [615, "THE CURREND SCHOOLS. 593 staying them \u2014 in front of the principal houses, and in some cases along the streets of the town. One moiety of the older and younger boys, with the currend director at their head, sing in one half of the town one Sunday, and tbe other half on the following Sabbath. These lads are chosen for the office, as well as for forming part of the choir of St. George's and St. Nicolai Churches \u2014 and are selected from the scholars of the different academic institutions in Eisenach on account of their melodious voices, and taught singing for two or three years before they are allowed to join the church choir. The houses outside which the cm-rend boys chant, are said to be generally the same as they were in Martin Luther's time. They consist chiefly of the larger dwellings in which the wealthier burghers of old resided \u2014 and in which many a \"Bath\" or towm-coun cillor lives to tbe present clay \u2014 as well as the majority of the bakers' shops distributed throughout the city. The boys come provided with the scores of the diffe rent parts of the hymn they are to sing in the streets on tbat morning ; and, as soon as it grows light, they make use of these as guides to the general harmony \u2014 the lads, as they halt in front of the appointed houses, and prepare for the next chant, grouping themselves about the director who first strikes the key-note with the tuning fork he holds in his hand, and who then proceeds to regulate the time and modu lation of the choral.

These \" currends,\" from which the institution derives its distinctive name, consist of small circular boxes made of tin, about tbe size of a child's mug, with a slit at top, a padlock in front, and a handle at the back. They are painted brown, and are still of the same form as they were in tbe time of Martin Luther, whose currend-box may be seen preserved to this day in the Luther chamber at the Wartburg. When the whole of the little fellows deputed to collect the donations for the day have come together, they file off in couples, each pair of boys proceeding to solicit alms in the different streets of the quarter in which they have collectively chanted in the morn ing. It is customary for the citizens at whose houses the boys sing regidarly to pay 10 groschens (or Is.) every quarter of a year towards the support of the institution ; so that the youngsters beg only at the dwellings or shops of the non-subscribers through out the locality which forms part of their beat. Upon reaching the houses, the little lads open the doors or enter the open shops, and then, with their money-box held forth in their hand, they cry aloud, as we have before described, with a peculiar drone, and with a prolonged emphasis on the first syllable of tbe word \" Coo-o-or-encl \\ \" while they jingle the coins in their little tin boxes to remind tbe people of the object of their visit. Tlieir usual reward is more or less pfen nings (twelve of which go to an English penny) ac-"], [617, "THE CURREND SCHOOLS. 595 cording to the amount of liberality or small change belonging to the donor at the time. It should be added, however, that it is the common custom with the chand ler's-shopkeepers and beer-sellers of the town to keep all the suspicious small coins of other duchies, wliich they find a difficulty in getting others to receive, expressly to give to the currend-scholars : for they will be glad, the dealers know, to take money which every other person rejects with scorn. The sums thus collected are handed over to the safe custody of the director of the Burger-school, and divided, together with the subscriptions received, among the curr end-boys every quarter of a year. The money serves to find them in clothes or such other articles as they may require ; the only drawback being that those boys who have failed to assemble at tbe appointed time and place, when it was their turn to take part in the Sunday morning chant, have to forfeit one groschen for each day they were absent out of the money coming to them at the quarter's end. \" The ori_rin and foundation of these cm-rend schools,\" says Herr Johann Storch, in bis \" History of Eisenach,\" \"is unknown.\" Dr. Croly, in his \" Life of Luther,\" explains the meaning of the title as follows : \u2014 \" The word currend,\" he says, \" is derived from the Latin currere, to run, and with the addition of schiiler (scholars) is applied to a company of boys attached, in Luther's early days, to almost all large German towns, who walked, or ran, through tbe streets, singing hymns.\" <_ Q 2"], [618, "596 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. But this is the very dotage of classical learning, for on reference to Adelung's JForterbueh, we find the term thus defined : \u2014 \" 1. In some parts of the country the sending' round certain church matters which have to pass between the custos and schoolmasters of one village and another ; also the leaden case or box in which the same church property is kept. 2. In a collective sense, it means poor scholars who sing for alms in the streets, and also the entire institution for such poor scholars.\" To go into the currende, we are told, signifies to become one of such scholars, and therefore a currendaner, or currend scholar, is one who goes to such an institution. (Vol. i. p. 1 0 6 .2 . ) Hence it is manifest that the term currend was ap plied to such schools, not because the scholars \" walked or ran \" through the streets (as Dr. Croly absurdly supposes), but because tbe word was borrowed from the Latin currendum, and originally signified some thing to be carried round or circulated\u2014 like the poor box, by the sacristans among the parishioners ; whilst it afterwards came to stand for, instead of the poor box itself, the alms that were gathered in such a manner ; and lastly for the schools which were mainly supported by donations collected in such currend boxes. Consequently, the Currend-sehule was originally nothing more than a particular kind of charity school, where the choir-boys were taught choral music and allowed to sing outside the burghers' houses on certain days ; after which they were sent round at certain periods of the week with such"], [619, "THE CURREND SCHOOLS. 597 currend-boxes in their hands, to collect from house to house funds for tlieir maintenance \u2014 as, we have shown, is the practice in Eisenach to the present day. These institutions, doubtlessly, were somewhat equivalent to our own charity schools ; for it is known the currend-scholars of old were accustomed to sing in the church-service, the same as charity children with us. There was, however, this simple difference between tbe two institutions : the currendaners them selves had to collect the alms by wliich they were sup ported, whereas, with our charity boys, the collection is made for them. Moreover, at many of our ancient monastic schools and colleges there is generally some institution in connection with them for maintaining certain poor scholars \u2014 such as tbe \" Bishop's boys \" at Westminster, and the \" Sizars \" at Cambridge. Probably tbe institution of the currend-schools in Germany arose from the fact that a number of boys were required to sing in the services at the cathedrals of the larger towns, and that owing to the beauty of many of their voices, they were encouraged by the wealthier town'sfolk to chant hymns outside their houses at certain times and seasons, by the distribution of a small dole to them ; and thus a practice which was perhaps voluntary and only occasional at the out set, came, in the days of the Mendicant Friars, when alms-seeking was considered to be a part of religion, to shape itself into the half-begging and half-self supporting institutions, that the German \" currend schools \" remain to this day. It has been suggested by"], [620, "598 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. others, that the practice of alms-gathering, permitted, or rather enjoined, at such schools originated with the begging friars who wandered from shrine to shrine, living upon what they collected at the houses of tbe rich by tbe way ; or tbat it was connected with the ancient institution of the \"Bacchantes,\" whose custom it was to sing their dithyrambs for alms at people's doors. But it certainly appears less far-fetched to refer the origin of these same schools to the re quirements of the Bomish Church, and assume that they sprang out of the education which was given by tbe Mendicant Friars in exchange for the services of the boy-singers at mass, and with which the practice of singing in the streets for dole came afterwards to be regularly associated. After the Reformation, the currend scholars became the Lutheran choir-singers, and were admitted to the Chapel Royal ; and though it would seem that the original custom was for them to sing twice, or even thrice, in the week in the streets, tbeir chanting has now come to be limited merely to the Sunday morn ings\u2014though the periods of collection continue to be bi-weekly, as in the days of old. In the olden time it was usual for each of the currend boys to be provided with a mantle similar in shape to the Catholic \" Chor-rock,\" but of a thick material ; for we find in the historical account of Eisenach the choir singers were formerly, one and all, clad in a blue cloth cloak (samintlich mit einem blauen Tueh-mantel beldeidet). These mantles, however, were discarded for many years, and it was not until the"], [621, "599 TIIE CURREND SCHOOLS. boys were supplied with cloaks, through the liberality of one of the principal manufacturers of the town of Eisenach, that the \" cm-rend scholars,\" made their appearance in the streets in tlieir ancient garb though the modern mantles are of a hideous under taker-like cut and colour rather than the ordained blue tint. The hats, worn at the same time by the boys, are of the most ludicrously-antique character ; for it is the custom in the school for these articles of attire to descend almost from generation to generation, the new"], [622, "600 GERMAN LTFE AND MANNERS. scholars purchasing them for a few pence from the old ones, as the elder boys leave to become schoolmasters and cantors (church-music directors) in some small village. The consequence is, one sees little boys of eight or ten years of age wearing hats that are big enough for their grandfathers, and which, from the antiquated, funnel-like shape of the article, would appear to have been first worn by some village buck towards the end of the last century. Indeed, though the Eisenach hats, which, as we have before said, the citizens delight to appear in only on Sundays, and funerals, are of the most old-fashioned character, still, odd and droll as they appear in the present day, those of the cm-rend boys immeasurably surpass them in the caricature-like character, which such anti quated articles give to the very young \u2014 Ecce signum ! The annexed illustration is a faithful picture of one of the little choir-boys as he appears in his old-fash ioned man's hat and long black cloak, and with his little tin money-box stretched out as he cries his \" coo o-or-end ! \" for alms at the door of the citizens. The picture is the more interesting from the fact that Martin Luther himself tells us that he was in the habit of doing tbe same in tbe streets of Eisenach, though, perhaps, in a more picturesque costume than the ugly funereal garb of the present day. \"Let no one,\" he said, when he had become a great man, \" speak contemptuously, in my presence of the poor fellows who go singing through the streets and beg ging from door to door a little bread for the love of God \" (Banem propter Deum, \u2014 such having been the"], [623, "THE CURREND SCHOOLS. 601 cry of the Mendicant Friars as they stood, with their sack at their back, at the threshold of the houses in Luther's time). \" It is said,\" he adds, \" and it is true, that the Bope himself bas been a poor mendicant singing-scholar, and you know the Bsahn says ' princes and kings have sung.' I myself, too, was such a screaming beggar-boy. I was once one of those poor mendicant lads seeking my bread at people's houses, particularly at Eisenach \u2014 my own dear Eisenach ! \" For though the Great Reformer was left to starve, when a boy, despite his piteous cry of \" bread for the love of God,\" for many a long week in the bard-hearted Thuringian capital, he never in after life could do other than speak of the wretched town than as his \" own beloved Eisenach,\" because he re membered bow the good Dame Ursula Cotta had nursed and fed him as a child, when all others had turned their back upon bis sufferings ; and bow Frede rick the Wrise had sheltered him at the Wartburg when the malevolent Rapists were seeking to burn him at the stake. No wonder, then, that to so warm hearted and loving a creature as Martin ever was, the recollection of these two acts of kindness should have made Eisenach (ugly, dirty hole as it remains at the present time) one of the greenest spots in memory's waste. In order to understand better the character of this ancient Cm-rend Institution in Eisenach, we obtained permission from Herr Schmidt, the rector of the Second Burgers' School (to whom indeed we are in-"], [624, "602 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. debted for the greater part of the information before given), to accompany the boys on their early morning rounds through the city ; and he was polite enough to give instructions that one of the Currend scholars should come and call us at our hotel immediately the singers were assembled in the market-place ; for as the boys meet as early as five, some such precaution was necessary with a person fresh from the British metropolis. The morning on which the lad came to us was a bleak and dark autumnal one, and as we emerged from the bright breakfast-room of the hotel, kept ready for the travellers by the early trams, the street outside looked black as a cavern. Every one of the oil lamps dangling in the middle of the streets had long since died out, not a star shone overhead, and the inky clouds hung so low that the firmament looked like a dome of lead. As we entered the open square of the Wednesday's market-place, the old tower of the Bath- J/aus, and the modern cupola on the palace roof, stood out in grim colorless dusk against the sombre sky. Not a soul was abroad, and only here and there a win dow shone, like a patch of gold, amid the black fronts of the houses, with the light of the early risers within. These were mostly at the bakers' shops ; or else, where the light was more like a phosphorescence behind the panes, we could tell it proceeded from the almost ex hausted night-lamp of some young mother's, or sick person's, chamber. We walked on for some short distance in the drizzling rain (for the clouds were just beginning to"], [625, "THE CURREND SCHOOLS. 603 sprinkle tbe streets with a slight shower of early No vember sleet) without meeting a soul, till we came to the sentries, wrapped in then* great coats, pacing in front of the palace, as they stamped then- feet on the stones ; and, with the brass on then- leathern helmets, glitter ing dimly in the light of the expiring oil-lamps in front of the palace-gates. Here, the Currend boy who acted as our guide inquired whether the choir had sung in the market-place. \"Ja wohl,\" was the answer ; and accordingly we proceeded down the narrow Carls Strasse. Here the way was darker than ever, and so still that we met no one but a stray railway- guard, in his fur cap and long gaberdine-like coat, looking like some Jew in the olden time \u25a0 or else an early traveller hurrying along with his throat swathed in comforters and with his carpet-bag in his hand. Not a sound was to be heard but the dripping of the eaves, or the splashing of the water-thread from the huge dragon-shaped gurgoils projecting from the roofs far into the roadway. As we neared the open Nicolai Blatz, at the other end of the thoroughfare, our son, who accompanied us, said suddenly, \" Hark ! I hear them now ; \" and then as we stood still for a minute, we could catch something bke the drone of an organ in the distance. Then hastening on again, the sounds grew gradually louder and louder, till as we turned the corner of the Saturday's market-place the choral burst upon us with exquisite distinctness and solemnity, in the utter stillness and darkness of all around us. Here some two or tliree casements were illuminated with the"], [626, "604 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. lights of the neighbouring hotel, while the shops of the early chandler' s-store-keepers, were already opening for the sale of schnapps to the few passers by. The long square tower of the Nicolai gate, and the tall octagonal turret, with its sharp spire, of the church hard by, bad a half-spectral look as they stood out against the grey eastern sky. The black group of Currend boys could hardly be made out across tbe open Blatz, but then- voices wroke up tbe place with the choicest and gravest beauty, echoing and re-echoing against the many queer angles of the houses, and reverberating in the archways and ample fore-courts, till the sound of the hymn had hardly a human character about it \u25a0 for, as we trod the deso late square, the chant came rolling along towards us in fine rich waves of sacred harmony, so that it wanted but little imagination to bebeve that tbe unseen singers, in the darkness, were some angelic choir hovering overhead. On approaching tbe youths, we could only distin guish that some were grown young men, and others mere children (it was still too dark to make out their features), and that almost all had thick comfor ters rolled about then- neck, while many had grey plaid shawls wrapped tightly round their shoulders \u2014 for at that time the black cloaks which the lads now wear had not been distributed to them. AVhen the chant in the Nicolai Blatz was finished, we accompanied the Cm-rend boj's to the bttle \" fore-town,\" as it is called, outside the gate. Here they startled the stillness of the early morn with another such hymn,"], [627, "THE CURREND SCHOOLS. 605 which was sung in front of a Httle baker's shop there, while the baker himself, in his long white apron, came and stood at the door, and taking the white cap from his head, listened uncovered while the sabbath choral resounded through the afr. Hence the group of choir-singers hurried off to the neighbouring Dyers' Quarter, and there they sang beside the bridge that, spans the bttle stream, which in the daytime is blue as blue ink, with the tints of the cloth and yarn continually being washed in it. Next we followed them to the Goldsmiths' Street, where another Sunday morning carol was given outside the houses, which, in the light of the com ing day, we could now tell, by the large ornamented, gateways to them, were such as had been inhabited by the foremost citizens in the olden time. As the boys walked along this street too, they kept singing by the way, pausing now to chant a verse at the door of this dwelling, and another at that. Thus we came back to the Wednesday's market place once more ; and here another and another matin-hymn was chanted, first hi front of the town hall (Bath-haus), then over against the palace, and lastly outside the \" Half-moon Hotel,\" where we were staying. Thence the little band of shivering boy- singers hastened back, across the market-place, to a bye corner of tbe open square, behind the St. George's Church, which is now known by the name of the Luther's Flats,- and here in front of a large house, with a gateway carved with caryatides on either side"], [628, "606 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. of the arch, and a lofty pyramidal roof, they sang Martin Luther's own noble hymn of \u2014 \" gin' fcfic 2Mira ist unset Gott, gin' fitttc 2BeI)P un_ iC-artcii, gr l.ilft une ft* e i aus aller Die ,tf ODie uns jeSt I.at t>etccffcn.\" (Literal translation.) \" Our God's a mighty citadel, A trusty shield and weapon. He'll guard us safe from every ill That to mortal man can happen.\" Now this house, with the caryatides beside the gate way, we happened to know was the \" Cotta-house \" as it is called, and the very same dwelling in front of which Martin Luther himself \u2014 when he was but tbe same age as some of the younger of those Currend boys standing at our elbow \u2014 had sung his Sunday matin-song to Dame Ursula. It was under that same quaint pyramidal roof, indeed, that the good merchant's wife, when she had been stricken with the sweetness of the little fellow's voice, and touched by the story of his sufferings in Eisenach, had given him shelter in the little room wliich we had seen but a day before overlooking the Butchers' Street at the corner. So when we heard these young Cur rend boys making the Blatz ring with the very hymn that Martin Luther himself had lived to write in after-years, when he had become the great Beformer of his country, we never felt words or music touch om- soul so deeply. The years seemed to roll back, and the history of one of the most pregnant acci dents in connection with the life of a youth who was"], [629, "THE CURREND SCHOOLS. 607 a mere beggar-boy at the time, appeared to be so vividly re-enacted to us, tbat we could almost fancy one of tbe youngsters at our side was little Martin himself warbling in the darkness ; and that we could see in the dusk, the good dame smiling in charity from above as she was carried away, like ourselves, by tbe sacred beauty of the song, as well as touched by the sad lot of those poor little fellows who were sing ing there in the darkness and the stinging chilliness of the early winter's morning. With the tears in our eyes we drew om- young son to us, and bade him remember that morning and that place as long as he lived ; and to let it ever be an abiding token to him, that high faith and high corn-age can master every difficulty and every danger in the world. From the Luther's Blatz the group of boy-singers turned off to tbe Smelters' lane, and thus they reached the long straggling thoroughfare that leads to the ancient \" Women's gate \" (Frauen Thor) for merly standing at the end of this quarter. Here they chanted again, in front of several old man sions, with huge portals and many windows \u2022 while some of these houses had quaint Latin inscriptions over their doorway, such as \" Sit Bax intrantibus, SALUS EX EUNDIBUS.\" It was now growing light, and one could see the old Wasch-fraus, as they were fetching water from the street-fountains in the long conical wooden pails strapped to their back, pause to rest their heavy load upon one of the stones placed for the purpose at the"], [630, "608 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. side of the streets, and wait with their head bent in reverence while the singing boys drew themselves up in a semicircle around the director, and carolled forth another matin hymn, from the scores they were now able to read, as they held them in their hand. Here, too, the chant was repeated, in front of many a baker's shop as before ; whilst at other houses, where the children had been newly taken from their bed, and placed half-dressed at the window to bsten to the pretty Sunday-morning song, the little things with thefr long flaxen hair hanging all about their eyes, as if they were so many Skye- terriers, would clap their hands and crow as they listened to the voices in tbe twilight. Those, too, who were up and about in the streets took off their caps to the singers as they went by. By this time it was light enough to make out the character of the choir-bo}7s, whom we had before known only as a vague indistinct group. They had all somewhat of a well-to-do air about them, and cer tainly in no way approximated to the character of the poor beggar-boys who were wont to cry at the house-doors, \" Bread ! for the love of God,\" in the early days of Martin Luther. Some of them, it is true, reminded one strongly of the itinerant German-boy band-players seen in tbe streets of London ; and being clad in thin tweed coats, that were buttoned tight up to the collar, had a wretched, pinched, frost-bitten air with them. Some were fresh-coloured, with dark eyes and locks, while many were by no means bad-looking, or coarse-sea-"], [631, "609 the currend schools. tured lads. Not a few, however, had the true string like German hair, cut \" club-fashion,\" and tucked behind their big red ears, together with the same washed-out complexion and white eyebrows and eye lashes which are distinctive of the Teutonic race. All had good strong shoes to tlieir feet, and not one, even of the younger boys, looked in any way poverty stricken. At some distance up the street last-mentioned, the matin-chanting came to an end, and the boys parted to go home to breakfast. As they proceeded in different knots towards their houses, we walked in their wake, watching the kind of dwellings into which they disappeared, one after another, now that their morning's work was over. Their homes were mostly at the small chandlers'-shops, while some shot into the large portals belonging to tbe old burgers' houses, where every floor is now let out to the better class of citizens ; so that, as far as we could judge by such signs, the Cm-rend boys of tbe present clay have but little of the character of the mendicant choir singers of old. A short while after accompanying the Currend singers on their rounds, we visited the house of the mother of one of the poorer and younger lads, who had been recommended to us by the Bector of the school. The family lived in a small cot outside the old George's gate, which formerly constituted one of the principal entrances to the town. The bricks in the passage from the door were all loose, and the light vol. I. R R"], [632, "610 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. was shining through the cracks in the dark rickety staircase we had to momit. On the first floor we were ushered into a small neat chamber, the boards of wbich had been newly sanded. Tbe furniture was exceedingly scanty \u25a0 there was a small table, like that to a servant's bedroom, whilst in one corner stood a rude German stove, like a series of cast-iron mignionette-boxes arranged upon black flower-pots, and in the opposite angle of the room was ranged a row of large china pipes belonging to the woman's eldest son. There were a few painted religious prints, and a black profile portrait of the woman's late husband, decorating the walls ; while along the window-sills were set pots of china asters and such common flowers as the autumn afforded. One or two bird-cages, made out of white wood and hardly bigger than cigar-boxes, hung from the ceiling, and in these robins and yellow hammers hopped and skipped with a restlessness that gave one a terrible sense of their imprisonment. The woman herself was a spare, under-fed crea ture, in a rusty suit of black ; and we found her knitting as we entered. Her husband, she told us, had been dead ten years ; be had been a corporal in the army, and had died of fever. She had had two sons and one daughter, but the latter had died young. Her eldest boy was twenty years of age ; be was a day-labourer, and gave her something whenever he had work. She lived principally by carrying things up to the tavern on the summit of the Wart burg mountain, and received one penny farthing"], [633, "THE currend schools. 611 for every journey, besides getting something to eat when she reached the top of the steep hill. In sum mer, she often made the ascent three and four times in a day. She was usually employed in carrying pro visions up there on her back, and sometimes she took as many as forty pounds at once. The hill was a very steep one, and \" such a load,\" she said \" tried her dreadfully.\" In the fine weather, when many stran gers come to see the Castle, she sometimes made the journey thrice, and oftener, in the course of the day. She called it a very good day's work, if she got five groschens (sixpence, English) for her labom- ; and out of this she had to keep herself and boy, who was at the Currend school. She had to pay eight thalers, or twenty-four shillings, a-year rent for tbe room she occupied, and did not make a thaler (three shillings) a-week regularly ; indeed, she said her earnings were \" a long way off that \u2022 \" and if it were not that she had her food given to her up at the Wartburg, she did not know how she could live at all. When she took a large order from the Castle-tavern to the shops, they gave her a little coffee, or sugar, or a bit of black bread ; and so she made it out. The Currend school was a great help to her, especially as her boy had to pay nothing for his education, as he was the son of an old soldier. Other lads, however, had to pay one and a-half thalers (four and sixpence) the year, to go into the \" Second Citizens' School:\" but there were schools where the poorest children paid nothing. The money which came to her boy out of the Cur rend box, helped her to buy shoes and clothes for"], [634, "612 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. him. If lads have a good voice they are taken into the choir ; and she considered it a great bless ing that her little son bad been thought fit for it. When she had a bit of meat given to her, they had \" flesh \" for dinner, but she never could afford to buy any. The day before our visit, she had carried up from thirty to forty pounds of beef and veal, to tbe Wartburg, and the butcher had given her a bit of liver sausage, for bringing him the order ; and that with a few potatoes had been their dinner that day. The boy was a good-looking little fellow, with a frank and somewhat intelligent expression. He was not more than ten or eleven years of age _ and when we used to tell him that the great Martin Luther had once been such a poor boy as he, he would look up in our face, his bright blue eyes twinkling the while, and say that he would strive to be one day as great a man as Martin himself.
