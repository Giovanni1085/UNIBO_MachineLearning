General Description, Boundaries Ancient and Modern, Soil, Productions, Geology, Rivers, Towns, Commerce, Population, Revenues, Political Insti- tutions and Land Tenure. THE extent and boundaries of the territory called Orissa, have under- gone many and essential changes at different periods of its history, and remain to this day very ill-defined and imperfectly understood. The cor- responding Puranic division of Utkala Desa or in the vulgar tongue Utkal Khand reached on the north to Tumlock and Midnapore, taking in a portion of Rarha Des in Bengal, and south to the Rasikulia or Rasikoila Nadi which flows into the sea at Ganjam. On the east it was bounded by the ocean and the river Hoogly, and on the west by Sonpur, Bunay, and other dependencies of Sembhelpur and Gon- dwana, Or Desa, or Oresa, the old original seat of the Or or Odra tribe, had anciently less extended limits, the Rasikulia river marking its southern and the Kans Bans which passes near Soro, in latitude about 21\u00b0. 10'. N. its northern extreme ; but in the progress of migration and con- quest, the Uria nation carried their name and language over a vast ex- tent of territory, both on the sea shore and in the hills, including besides Orissa properly so called, a portion of Bengal and of Telingana. Dur ing the sway of the Princes ofthe Ganga Vansa line, for a period of near- A 2"], [8, "2 ON ORISSA PROPER ly four centuries, the boundaries of the Raj of Orissa may be stated as fol lows, with sufficient accuracy for a general description. North, aline drawn from the Tribeni or Tirveni ghat above Hoogly, through Bishenpur to the frontier of Patkum ; east, the river Hoogly and the sea ; south the Goda veri or Ganga Godaveri ; and west, a line carried from Sinhbhum to Sone pur, skirting Gangpur, Sembhelpur and its dependencies, and thence through Bastar to Jayapur, and the Godaveri. Thus in the more prosperous days of the Orissan monarchy, and that too at no very remote period, it comprised within its limits four of our modern zillahs entire, and portions of three others, viz. Midnapore, Cuttack, Ganjam, and Vizagapatam, . with parts of the Jungle Mehals, Hoogly, and Rajamundry, besides a portion of the hills and woodland country of Gondwana. The degree of autho rity exercised by the sovereign power throughout this extensive territory, fluctuated of course greatly at different periods, depending on the per sonal character of the reigning Prince, the circumstances of the times, and the conduct, resources and dispositions ofthe numerous dependant Rajas and feudatories, whose principalities or jurisdictions have at all times formed so remarkable and important a feature in the political geography of Orissa. Occasionally the conquests of the Gajapati Princes extended into the more remote parts of Telingana, and even to the Car natic, but it appears that they never obtained a firm footing in any ac quisitions ; South of the Godaveri and during the last century of their in dependance, their possession even of Rajamendry was much contested and disturbed by the Bahmini sovereigns ofthe Deccan. One of the first ar- rangements of the ministers of Akber on annexing Orissa to the Dewani of the Mogul empire, was to join Hoogly and its ten dependent M . hala, to Bengal. The Mogul Subah of Orissa then comprised the whole coun- try stretching from Tumlook and Midnapore on the north, to the fort of Rajamendry or Raj Mahendri south, divided into the five unequally apporti- oned,* Sircars, called Jellasore, Budruck, Cuttack, Calinga DundpaVf aud * The three first of these were after Akber's re_su subdivided into lesser Sircars, which will be en* merated in another place. t Dundpat implies one of the larger territorial divisions under rhe y.l Uria Raj."], [9, "OR CUTTACK. 3 Rajamundry. The vast range of hilly country bounding the Subah to the westward, from Bishenpur down to the neighbourhood of Karronde, Bas tar and Jayapur, was classed under a separate head in the Revenue ac counts of tbe empire, for reasons which will be subsequently stated, and was allowed for many years after the Mohammedan conquest, to re main entirely under the management of its Native Chiefs, subject either to the condition of Military service or to the payment of a light quit rent. Very early after the settlement ofthe Emperor Akber, if not indeed at the moment of its formation, the Sircar of Rajamendry and that portion of Ka linga Des which lies south of Tikali Raghunat'hpur were dismembered from Orissa, by the successful encroachments of the Mohammedan Kings of Golconda, called the Kutteb Shahis, but of this event, no distinct ac count is given in the history of the country. At the opening of Moham med Tacki Khan's administration, A. D. 1726, who governed as the Naib or Deputy of the Nazim ofthe three provinces, the most authentic Revenue records exhibit the Subah of Orissa as extending from a place called Radha Dewal seven coss beyond the town of Midnapore to Ti .kali* Raghunat'hpur, one of the estates in or near the Mahendra Mali range of hills in Ganjam, a computed distance of 17(3 coss, and on the west from the sea at False Point to the Bermul Pass, reckoned at coss eighty five. Before the close of his government its limits had become much re duced. The Officers of the Nizam of Hyderabad intriguing with the powerful Zemindars (Poligars) of the Ganjam district, contrived to alienate. from the Province the whole ofthe country south ofthe Chilka Lake. On the Bengal side, views of financial convenience induced the Nawab Shuja Uddin Mohammed Khan to annex the mehals included in the old Jellasore Sircar, as far as the Subanrekha, to the territory immedi ately dependent on the Moorshedabad Government, with the exception of Pergunnahs Pattaspur, &c. It was thus bounded, viz. by the Su- * Mr. Grant in his Political Survey ofthe Northern Sircars calls this place \" Teckaly or Jtogo naut'hpore on the sea coast 43 miles N.

D. in lieu of the sums which he had stipulated to pay as Chouth : and it is to this tract, the modern zillah of Cuttack, which may not inaccurately be called Orissa Proper from its comprising the ancient original country of the Uria or Odra nation, and from the circumstance of its retaining amongst the natives of the present day the exclusive appel- lation of Or Desa or Oresa, that the following description is intended chief ly to apply. The Purans and Upapurans are lavish in their praises of Utkal Khand,* the real etymology of which word I apprehend to be, \" The famous portion or country,\" and not, the famous country of Kala, asrenderedby a very high authority. It is declared to be the favorite abode ofthe Devatas, and to boast a population composed, more than half, of Brahmins. The work called the Kapila Sanhita, in which Bharadwaja Muni explains to his inquiring pupils, the origin, history, and claim, to sanctity of all the remarkable Khetrs of Orissaopens with the following panegyric : \" Of all the regions ofthe earth Bharata Khand, is the most distinguished, and of all the countries ofBha rataKhand, Utkala boasts the highest renown. Its whole extent is one unin- terrupted Tirt'h (place of pilgrimage.) Its happy inhabitants live secure of a reception into the world of spirits, and those who even visit it, and bathe in its sacred rivers, obtain remission of their sins though they may weigh like mountains. Who shall describe adequately its sacred streams, its temples, its khetrs, its fragrant flowers and fruits of exquisite flavour, and all the merits and advantages of a sojourn in such a land. What ne cessity indeed can there be for enlarging in the praises of a region, which the Devatas themselves delight to inhabit .\" Tbe Panjias or Annalists of Orissa are fond of relating, that when the famous Sivai Jay Sinh, the Ge- * Some of the Pundits of Cuttack explain it to mean the region famous iu the Caliyuga for its temples and khetrs."], [11, "OR CUTTACK. 5 neral of Akber, marched with an army into the country in 1580, A. D. he was struck with amazement at the sight of its sacred river the Mahanadi, its vast crowds of Brahmins, its lofty temples of stone, and all the won ders of the ancient capital Bhuvaneswar, and exclaimed, \" This country is not a fit subject for conquest, and schemes of human ambition. It belongs wholly to the Gods, and is one entire Tirt'h.\" He accordingly interfered little in its affairs and soon returned to Hindustan, leaving a large share of authority in the hands of its Native Princes. The Hindus of modern times however, freely admit, that the estimation in which Orissa is or was held, is to be ascribed entirely to its temples, places of pilgrimage, and its Brahmanical institutions. At all events, the European observer will soon discover, that notwithstanding its Puranic celebrity, tbe soil of the country is generally poor and unfruitful, all its natural produc tions of an inferior quality, and that its inhabitants rank the lowest, in the scale of moral and intellectual excellence, of any people on this side of India. The modern Orissa or Cuttack, comprises, as is well know7n, an exten sive, little explored region, on the west, consisting chiefly of hills and fo rests, intersected by many fertile plains and vallies ; and a plain level country, extending from the foot of that barrier to the sea, evidently of al luvial formation, the uniform surface of which is not disturbed by a single rocky elevation throughout its whole extent \u2014 nor does a single stone occur between the beds of iron clay lying on the western frontier, and the ocean, if we except the curious spheroidal concretions of calcareous matter or limestone nodules which are found very generally dispersed. The province may be considered as divided both naturally and politically into three re gions, distinguished from each other by their climate, general aspect, pro ductions and the institutions prevailing on them, viz. 1st. The marshy wooodland tract which extends along the sea shore, from the neighbour hood of the black Pagoda to the Subanrekha varying in breadth from five miles to twenty : 2ndly. The plain and open country between this and the"], [12, "6 ON ORISSA PROPER hills, whose breadth on the north is as trifling as ten or fifteen miles, and never exceeds forty or fifty ; and 3rd. The hill country. The first and third are known to the natives as the Eastern and Western Rajwara or Zemindara, that is, the country occupied by the ancient feudal Chieftains, Khandaits, Zemindars or Poligars of Orissa; and the second, as the Mo- gulbundi or Khaliseh, being that from which the indigenous sovereigns and the Mogul conquerors of the country, derived the chief part of their land revenue, and which at present pays a rent to the British Government of Sicca Rupees 1,264,370; whilst the tribute yielded by the other extensive portions is fixed in perpetuity at the low sum of Sicca Rupees 1,20,411.* It will be convenient to describe the soil, productions and geological formation of the country in the order above noticed. The first region has much ofthe character ofthe Sunderbans, in its swamps and marshes, innumerable winding streams swarming with alligators, its dense jungles and noxious atmosphere, but wants entirely that grandeur of forest scenery, which diversifies and gives a romantic character to many parts of the latter. The broadest part of it is divided amongst the Rajas of Kanka and Kujang, and the Khandaits of Herrispur, Merichpur, Bishen- pur, Golra and others of less note. The Killah or Zemindari estate of A\\ likewise comes in for a share. Northward of Kanka the quantity of Jungle diminishes up to the neighbourhood of Balasore, but the whole space is intersected by numberless nullahs which deposit, and creeks which retain, a quantity of fine mud, forming morasses and quicksands highly dangerous to the unwary or uninformed traveller. The surface of the whole is covered with coarse reedy grass, and brushwood, valuable as fuel to the salt manufactures*-. One meets also with much of the Jhao or Tamarix In- dica, interspersed with quantities of a stunted dwarf Palm, called Hin tai * The Jemma of Khurda, which belongs to the R&jw&ra, but is at present under the immediate management of the English Revenue Officers, in consequence ofthe dispossession ofthe Raja is not included in this statement of Land Revenue."], [13, "OR CUTTACK. 7 (Ph\u0153nix Paludosa). Generally, where pure sand appears, more especially to the southward, about the black Pagoda, the surface of it is covered with a thick net work, formed by the interlaced stalks of a creeping convolvulus, with bilobate succulent leaves, which are for half the year loaded with large gay looking flowers of a bright reddish purple. The natives call it Kynsarilata. A delicate succulent plant with small bright green leaves growing thickly together (class Tetrandria, order Monogynia) is also very common, and the summits ofthe sand hills are for the most part crowned with tufts of the Asclepias Gigantea and a stiff thorny gramineous plant known by the name of the Goru Kanta, The prevailing timber is the Sundari (Query, Helitiera Litoralis, or a species of Sterculia ?) Extensive thickets of the thorny bamboo render travelling impracticable in most parts of Ku jang, Herispur, &c. except by water. The whole of the jungles abound with Leopards, Tygers, and wild Buffaloes, and the rivers at the flowing of the tide are perfectly surcharged with large and voracious Alligators of tlie most dangerous kind. The climate seems to be hurtful even to the natives, who are peculiarly subject to two formidable diseases, the Elephantiasis, and a species of dysentery called the Sui, besides the commoner com- plaints of fever and ague, In this wild inhospitable tract howrever the finest salt of all India is ma nufactured, which under the monopoly system, yields annually to the Compa ny a net Revenue falling little short of eighteen lacs of Rupees. The pro duce, distinguished for its whiteness and purity before it has passed into the hands of the Merchants, is of the species called Pangah procured by boiling. The process observed by the Molunghees or manufacturers is rude and simple to the last degree, The sea-water which is brought up by va rious small channels to the neighbourhood of the manufacturing stations or khalaris, is first mixed up and saturated with a quantity of the salt earth or efflorescence, which forms on the surface of the low ground all around, after it has been overflowed by the high tides, and which being scraped off by the Molunghees, is thrown into cylindrical recepta- B"], [14, "ON ORISSA PROPER 8 cles of earth having a vent underneath, and a false bottom made of twigs and straw. The strongly impregnated brine filtering through the grass, &c. is carried, by a channel dug in the ground, to a spot at hand, surrounded with an enclosure of mats, in the centre of which a number of oblong earthern pots, generally about two hundred, are cemented together by mud into the form of a dome, under which is a fire place or oven. The brine is poured into this collection of pots or choolahs, and boiled until a sufficient degree of evaporation has taken place, when the salt is taken out as it forms, with iron ladles, and collected in heaps in the open air. The heaps are afterwards thatched with reeds, chiefly the Nal (Arundo karka) and remain in this state until sold, or removed by the Officers of the Agency. Occasional patches of rice cultivation are to be met with in this portion of the Rajwara producing sufficient grain for local consumption, and the Raja of Kanka exports even a considerable quantity both to Calcutta and Cuttack. The sea all along the coast yields abundance of fine fish, of which upwards of sixty-one edible kinds are enumerated, by the natives. Those most prized by Europeans are the Sole or Banspatti, Tapsiya (Mango Fish,) Phirki (Pomfret,) Gajkarma (Whiting,) Hilsa (Sable Fish,) Khasan ga or Mullet, a fish called the Bijay Ram something resembling Mackarel, and the Sal or Salia. The Chilka Lake produces noble Bhekti or Cockup. The value ofthe excellent Turtle, Oysters,. Crabs, and Prawns, found off False Point, and in other parts, was unknown to the natives prior to their subjection to the British rule, but they are now of course eagerly sought after, to supply the stations of Balasore, Cuttack and Juggunnath. The great season for fishing is in the winter months, from October to February, whilst the wind and the surf are moderate. At this time all along the Northern coast the fishermen go out in parties of from twenty to thirty each, with large nets, which they set up before the commencement of flood tide, with the aid of bamboo poles, in the form of avast triangle, having the base open towards the shore. As the tide retires the fishermen take in and close up the nearest nets, thus driving the fish into the apex of the"], [15, "OR CUTTACK. 9 triangle where there is a net placed wdth a large pouch ready for their re ception. The quantity obtained at a haul in this way is often prodigious. The produce is taken to the neighbouring villages for sale, after reserving a sufficiency for home consumption, and a large quantity travels far into the interior, unprepared in any way, which it of course reaches in the last stage ef putridity, but not on that account a bit the less palatable or acceptable to the nice and scrupulous Hindu. On emerging from the insalubrious and uninteresting tract just describ ed, you arrive at the second and most important division of Cuttack, called the Mogulbandi or Khaliseh land which is divided into 150 Pergunnahs, and 2361 Estates of individuals, recorded in the public account of the Bri tish Government as Zemindars and Proprietors ofthe soil. Though this region be in general highly cultivated, and produces most ofthe grains and vegetables common in Bengal, its soil is certainly for the most part of a poor and unfruitful description. South of tbe Mahanadi it may be cha racterized as generally light and sandy. Beyond that river, and especially in the neighbourhood ofthe hills, it acquires a clayey consistency, and ap pearance, and is often remarkably white. Often too, for miles together it has the surface strewed with a thin sprinkling of gravel or limestone con cretions called by the natives Gengti. This description of soil extends nearly to Midnapore. It is generally speaking hungry and unproductive, particularly near the hills ; and large plains occur, as about Dhamnagher and Badrak, which are wholly unfit for cultivation, growing nothing but low stunted brushwood, chiefly the wild Corunda and tufts of the Bena grass. Rice is the great article of produce, and consequently of food, through out Orissa Proper. In the Pergunnahs north of the Byterini it is almost the sole object of agricultural labor. The grain is in general large and nutritious but coarse, and is considered far inferior to the average produce of Bengal and Behar. The two great rice crops of Cuttack are called the Sared and Beali. Of these the first and principal one is sown in May and June, and reaped from the middle of November to the middle of Ja- B 2"], [16, "ON ORISSA PROPER 10 nuary. The land which grows it rarely yields any second crop. The second in importance called the Beali is sown about the same time on the higher lands, and the produce is obtained from the end of August till the end of September. Afterwards a plentiful crop ofthe Rubbee grains is derived from tbe same fields. There is another less abundant crop called the Sat kia put into the ground in August and September, and reaped in November, and an inferior description of rice which is sown in low marshy spots at the opening ofthe cold weather, and by frequent transplantation and irrigation is rendered fit for cutting, in the following April. The cultivation ofthe latter sort called Dalo, takes place chiefly in the Pergunnahs between Khurdah, the Chilka Lake and the sea. In the Northern Pergunnahs the Sared rice cultivation is occasionally but rarely diversified with a few patches of Sugar-cane, Tobacco, and Pal ma Christi, in spots suited to their production. In the Central and South ern parts however abundant crops of pulse, millet and vegetable oils are raised during the cold weather, the chief of which are enumerated below.* Next to rice, the culture of the Arend or Palma Christi (Ricinus Com mu nis) is perhaps the most abundant. The natives undoubtedly use the oil in their common cookery, mixed with a small quantity of mustard seed oil which latter they prefer for burning as being the most economical. Cotton, Sugar-cane, and Tobacco are every where common South of the Byterini but it must be acknowledged that the produce is of a sorry description. The richer natives will not condescend to use the Desi Tambaku and the cotton formerly required for the manufacture of the finer fabrics was nearly all imported from Berar. Good wheat and a small quantity of bar ley are grown in Pergunnahs Saibir and Asseresser. There is but little * Viz.

The culture ofthe Poppy, Mulberry and Indigo, is unknown in the plains of Orissa. Nor, what will appear strange, w7ere the peasantry acquainted with the method of cultivating the Betlevine, un til taught by the natives of Bengal some generations back. The Piper Be tle now flourishes in the gardens around Puri and in the neighbourhood of a few Brahmin villages, but the produce can be adequate only to the sup ply of a very limited consumption, notwithstanding the assertion of the au thor of the work called the Ayeen Acberi or Institutes of Acber, that \" they have a great variety of the Betle leaf in Orissa \" The spots which are destined for the cultivation of Betle as also of Turmeric, Sugar-cane, &c. require laborious preparation and the application of a large quantity of manure, for which latter purpose the oil cake or Piri made of the refuse of the sesamum, mustard and other seeds ofthe same family is generally used. An occasional sprinkling of rotten straw, cow-dung and ashes is the only manure expended in the fields which yield the other kinds of produce. Orissa has little to boast of in the produce of its gardens though prais ed by Abulfazl for the excellence and abundance of its fruits and flowers. There is no deficiency however of the humbler kinds of pot herbs, and cu curbitaceous plants, with the Hibiscus esculentus, the Solanum Melon gena or egg plant, the sweet Potatoe and Lanka Mirch or Capsicum an nuum.

The Wine palm (Boras sus Flabelliformis), and the Khajur (Ph\u0153nix Sylvestris), abound in parti cular quarters. One rarely meets with the Cocoanut and Supari except in the neighbourhood of Brahmin villages, though they would thrive every where well in Cuttack, more especially the former. In all times Cuttack has been famous for its abundant produce of the fragrant Keora or Ketaca (Pandanus Odoratissimus). It grows every where wild, and is much used, jointly wdth several kinds of Euphorbia and Mimosa, for making hedge rows. The fruit borne in quantities by the female plant has much of the rich and tempting appearance of the Pine Apple, but on trial the inside proves to be hard, stringy, and tasteless. Its pith is used when boiled, as an article of food by the poorest classes, but seems to belittle prized even by them. An intoxicating spirit is distilled however from the strongly scented flowers of the male plant, to which the lower orders have no aversion. The surface of the Mogulbandi is in most parts south of the Kans Bans embellished and diversified with fine shadow7y groves of Mangos, dense thickets of Bamboo, and the most magnificent Banyan trees. The better cultivated gardens are loaded with Jessamines, Sambacks, Marigolds, Bau hinias, the Hibiscus, Rosa Sinensis, Michelia Champaea, &c. About the huts of the natives we generally find in great quantities the Hyperanthera Morunga, Melia azadirachta and Sempervirens, \u00c6schynomene Sesban, and grandiflora, the Bombax Heptaphyllum, Nauclea orientalis, &c. with the usual proportion of plantains. That the inferior quality and limited growth of many of the most valu able products of agriculture in Orissa, are owing in a great degree to some thing unfavorable in the soil and climate, is clearly evinced by the indif."], [19, "OR CUTTACK. 13 ferent success attending the efforts ofthe European Residents in garden ing. Much however must be ascribed to the general poverty, ignorance and want of enterprize of its peasantry and agriculturists. No one can enter the enclosures ofthe Sasans or villages held at a light quit rent by colonies of a particular class of Brahmins, without being instantly struck with the wide difference, which their precincts exhibit, as contrasted with the aspect of ordinary Uria Mouza. The higher description of cultivation which prevails on those lands, the superior value of their produce, and the flourishing groves and gardens which extend all around, evince what may be effected by intelligent industry, secured in the enjoyment of an adequate return and undisputed proprietary possession, even in this little favored soil and climate. It is in such situations only and in the neighbourhood of some ofthe well endowed temples, that the eye of the botanist is gratified by the presence of those graceful trees and plants, which constitute the chief ornament of the Indian Flora, such as the Nagacesara (Mesua Ferrea), the Moulsari (Mimusops Elengi), the Jonesia Asoca, the Ochna Squarrosa, the Sultan Champa or Calophyllum Inophyllum,. the Jarool (Lagerstr \u0153mia Flos Re gina.), and the finer kinds of Ixora, interspersed with Cocoa and Areca nut trees, and plantations of the betle vine, turmeric and ginger. The Sasan Brahmins indeed are the only cultivators or land proprietors of Orissa who manifest any symptoms of a disposition to improve their system of agricul ture, or to raise any plant or produce beyond what the wants of nature ab solutely demand. The Domestic Animals of the Mogulbandi do not rank higher in the scale of excellence than the produce of its soil. The horned cattle, sheep and goats are a miserable diminutive breed. A few fine buffaloes are domesticated on the eastern frontier for the sake of their milk, but they are not at all used as beasts of burthen. There is little game to be met with, excepting grey partridges, hares, snipes, jungle fowl and ducks of various kinds, and that little is difficult to be got at from the nature of the jungle. Few districts in- India perhaps"], [20, "14 ON ORISSA PROPER possess fewer attractions for the sportsman. The mention ofthe wild ani mals will more properly come under the description of the hill portion of the district. The third region to be described is that of the hills which bound the Mogulbandi to the westward from the Chilka Lake to the Subanrekha. A few groups extend into the plains, as at Derpen, Alemgir, Khurdah, Limbai, &c. and in the latitude of about 21\u00b0 20' N. the hills take a direc tion considerably to the eastward for some mil es, then turning north they compress the B lasore Chucklah of the Mogulbandi within very narrow limits. The distance between the high land and the sea is no where more than from sixty to seventy miles. At Balasore a group of fine rocky hills project boldly forth, to within sixteen or eighteen miles of the shores of the bay, which were known to the old navigators as the Nelligreen (Nilgi ri) mountains, and between Ganjam and the Lake a low ridge appears ac tually to run out into the sea, though in reality separated from its waters by a wide sandy beach. The whole of this region, reaching west as far as Sonepur, Gondwana and its dependencies, in breadth probably nearly a hundred miles, and from Sinhbhum adjoining Midnapore, north, to G6m ser in Ganjam south, a distance of certainly not less than two hundred miles, is parcelled out amongst sixteen Khetri or Khandait Zemindars, who have been recognized by the British Government as tributary Rajas. Along the feet of the hills extends a chain of twelve more Khundaitis held by a similar class, some of whom pay a light tribute, but are subject to the British laws and regulations, whilst others have been assessed at the ordinary rate. Their estates or feudal jurisdictions are entered in the revenue accounts, under the Mogul designation of Killah* or castle. The greater killahs within the hills, are subdivided again into a vast number of dependant Gerhs or estates, which are held by hereditary officers, called * The original meaning of Killa was a fort or strong place on a hill or mountain, though in latter times it has become applied to all kinds of places of defence.

The hills visible from the low country between the Brahmani river and Ganjam, are chiefly a granite formation remarkable for its resemblance to sandstone, and for its containing vast quantities* of imperfectly formed garnets disseminated throughout, with veins of steatite considerably indu rated. They occur generally in irregular scattered groups, having peaked and waving summits, which seem to cross each other at all angles ; or ia isolated conical and wedge-shaped hills wholly disconnected at their bases, and are all covered with vegetation to the very top. The greatest height of those seen from the Mogulbandi may be about 2,000 feet. Their ordinary elevation varies from 300 feet to 1200 feet. Ranges occur further in the in terior of greater loftiness and regularity, but 1 believe that an extended, continuous chain of mountains is no where to be met with in the Rajwara of O.issa- The prevailing colour ofthe principal rock is red. As far as my observation goes it never occurs stratified. Its texture often approaches to slaty, and from its generally decomposing and decomposed aspect, the quantity of red spots which it contains, being the ill-formed garnets above noticed, and the frequent veins of red and white steatite intersecting it, it presents altogether a most remarkable appearance. The same rock I ap prehend extends throughout the Northern Circars and far into the heart of the Deccan.

The composition and aspect of the Cuttack iron clay are very remarkable, from the innumerable pores and amygdaloidal cavities which it contains, filled with white and yellow lithomarge, and from the quantities of iron ore pebbles and fragments of quartz imbedded in it. By far the most in teresting circumstance however connected with it is, its complete and inti mate mixture with the granite, which has been traced in several instances, and specimens of which are in my possession, exhibiting the one rock en tirely invested by the other, though it is not easy to pronounce which is the inclosing substance.

The granite, at the place where the specimens were principally collected, appears to burst through an immense bed ofthe laterite, rising abruptly at a considerable angle. Numerous broken frag ments are strewed all around the line of junction, and in some specimens the two rocks are so mixed together as to form a sort of coarse breccia or ra ther conglomerate. South of the Mahanadi, in the country of Khurda a few isolated hills of white and variegated sandstone occur, curiously interspersed among the granitic ones. An indurated white lithomarge is found in company with them from which the natives prepare a white wash to ornament their houses. In the estates of Keonjher, Nilgiri, and Moherbenj, which constitute the northernmost portion ofthe hilly division of the Cuttack province, the half decomposed granite above described passes into fine white granite and gneiss rocks containing micaceous hornblende as a constituent part, ma ny of which, as I am informed, differ little in composition and general ap pearance from specimens collected on the highest accessible summits of the Himalaya mountains. The whole of the region now adverted to, fur nishes a great variety of interesting and valuable mineral productions, and"], [23, "OR CUTTACK. 17 is well worthy of attentive exploration by a Geologist qualified to describe adequately its most striking features and peculiarities. The granitic rocks -are here highly indurated and denuded of vegetation, and present a bold and varied outline with frequent sharp peaks and abrupt craggy faces. They are moreover in many parts curiously intersected by trap veins, which seem to consist chiefly 6i green stone approaching often to Basalt and Horn -blende rock. In company with these rocks, Talc slate, Mica slate, and \u2022Chlorite shist passing into serpentine and pot stone, are found in great abun dance. Several of the Chlorites are scarcely distinguishable from the latter mineral, and are much used under the general denomination of Mugni, for the manufacture of culinary vessels, idols, and sculptured slabs which de- corate the temples and finer edifices of the Uriahs. The granites and gneiss rocks being too hard for the tools of the quarriers in this quarter, and the sliists, with the exception of the Chlorite, not being of a description applicable to any useful purposes, the natives have adopted a very stimma *ry and comprehensive Geological classification. They stile the Mugrii, karma, or useful, and ail other rocks they banish into the class of Akarma, .or useless, concerning the situation and history of which they are as pro .vokingly indifferent as they are ignorant. Besides the substances above .enumerated, a variety of Corundum, or Corund, is found in the Nilgiri hills, .called by the quarriers Sild Dhar, which as the name implies, is used fer sharpening their tools ; also steatite, and Meerschaum in the state of a re jmarkably pure white powder, occur abundantly in Keonjher. The natives k_now no use for the latter substance, except to form the tika or streaks which particular classes draw on theh foreheads. Iron is abundantly diffused throughout the whole ofthe Cuttack hills, in the state chiefly of Pisiform iron ore, earthy red ditto, and Ochry red iron stone. It is smelted principally in the estates of Dhenkan.il, Angol and Moherbenj. Some ofthe rivers of Dhenkanal and Keonjher are said to \u25a0have golden sands, but the report wants confirmation, and 1 have notbeen :.able to ascertain the existence of any metal except iron in this province. C2"], [24, "18 ON ORISSA PROPER The only limestones of the province, are the calcareous nodules which oc cur abundantly in beds and nests, both within the hills and in the open country adjoining them, consisting of a ball of tolerably pure limestone enveloped in a yellowish coating of indurated maid. The hill estates vary much in the proportion of arable land which they contain, but, in most, a considerable quantity of rice is grown, and a few of the rubbee grains. In patches of jungle which have been recently cleared, and on the slopes of some of the minor hills, the Jowar and Bajera and the Mandia or Raggee (Eleusine Corocana) thrive wdth great luxuriance. Mo- herbenj, Beramba, Dhenkanal, and Keonjher, grow a small quantity of In- digo, and on the latter estate the Poppy even is cultivated. Keonjher dur- ing the late expedition against the Coles, was found to be for nearly one hundred miles, an open cultivated country only occasionally interrupted by ridges of hills and patches of jungle. Generally speaking, however, the land fit for tillage bears a very trifling proportion to the vast extent of rocks, hills, beds of torrents, and forests which occupy this re\u00b0ion. The woods ofthe interior produce abundance of fine timber, as the Sal, Piyasal (Buohanania Latifolia), Gamhar (Gmelina Arborea), &c. and, more rarely, the Sisu (Dalbergia Sissoo). . A few teak trees are found in Des- palla, but that valuable timber does not form forests nearer than the banks of the Tel Nadi which flows into the Mahanadi at Sonepur. The Sdl trees of Angol, Dhenkanal, and Moherbenj, are particularly sought af ter from their size.

The trees seldom attain to a large height or luxuriant growth in the decomposed soil covering the Granitic hills, which border the Mogulbandi, or in the woods that stretch along their bases. The jungles in the latter situation abound to a remarkable degree with trees and plants yielding drugs and medicinal articles, or at least fruits esteemed such by the natives, as the Terminalia Chebula, and Belerica (Harira and Bahara,) Vangueria Spinosa (Mayan phal), Strychnos nux vomica (Kuchila), Cassia Fistula (Amaltas), Phyllanthus Emblica (Aonla), Mimosa Khadira (Khayar), Chi- rounjia Sapida, Sapindus Saponaria, Spondias Mangifera, Semecarpus Ana- cardium (Bhila), Karanj or Galedupa Arborea, &c. The following trees like- wise very commonly occur, viz. Asin (Pentaptera tomentosa,) Geringa a species of Pterospermum, Lodh, (query, Phyllanthus Longifolius ?) Patali (Bignonia Suaveolens), besides the steady companions of all Indian sylvan scenery, the Tamarind, Mango, Bamboo, Bur and Peepul (Ficus Indica and Religiosa). The produce of the above is collected by the wild inhabit- ants of the jungles for sale in the Cuttack market, by which traffic chiefly they gain a livelihood. A gigantic climbing Bauhinia forms a very conspicu- ous object in these woods, which I suspect to be the Bauhinia Racemosa described by Dr. Wallich in the 12th volume of the Asiatic Researches. The name given by the natives is Siahri. The leaves are much used for thatch- ing their miserable huts, and the fibres ofthe bark serve to bind down the thatch, and to make mats. The fruit is a huge legume of a wooden consistency, containing from four to six round flat seeds, which have a sweetish pleasant taste not unlike the flavour of almonds, and are eaten with great relish by the hill people. Amongst the underwood one observes, in great quantities, several spe- cies of Mimosas, Euphorbias, and Justicias, the Jatropha Curcas, Capparis trifoliata, a Cassia with a pale yellow flower, the wild Corunda which at most times of the year is loaded with delicate white blossoms, tke Samal u (Vite__ trifoliata,) Asclepias Gigantea, a white Ixora, and a vast number of"], [26, "OX.

It is remarkable that the natives have a name for almost every plant, however humble or devoid of beauty, which may arise perhaps from the circumstance of their consuming the wild berries and fruits, to a very great extent, in aid of their limited means of subsistence. The Calamus Rotang, or ground Cane, is every where common, and seems in many parts to form, a sort of Nucleus, about which the other brushwood _ajid jungle collects in small patches. During the hot months and the rains , the rich and gaudy flowers ofthe Capparis trifoliata,* called by the natives Barun, and the scarlet blossoms ofthe Palas (Butea frondosa,) interspersed with quantities ofthe Gloriosa superba, which grows quite wild, lend an .air of splendour and. gaiety even to these cheerless and uninviting, tracts of jungle. In the cold weather, they receiv-e another brilliant tinge of colour- ing from a parasitical plant the Loranthus Bicolor, of scarlet and yellojv hue, which covers the larger trees in great profusion, and front the young .floral leaves as well as the inflorescence of a sort of creeper, the Combretum Decandrum, which ascends and overhangs the whole woods in large whitish masses, distinguishable by the contrast of their hue from a considerable dis- tance. Amongst the bulbous, mpnandrous, and gramineous plants, which bedeck orclothe the surface of the ground, a species of Pancratium, the wild Jturmeric, and tjie Andropogon aciculatum and muricatum occur most fre- quently. In the pools and marshes, water-lilies of all colours, and also the true Lotus, sacred Bean Lily or Nelumbium speciosum, are found in abun- dance. -The vegetable dies procured from the hills, are chiefly the Bacam or Sap pan wood, the Aal or Achu (Morinda citrifoliaj the culture of which is little attended to in the plains, and the flowers of the Butea frondosa. There. are two species of the Capparis in this district, or perhaps they are only varieties of the Capparis Trifoliata.

The Cocoons ofthe wild silk, are much larger than those of the real worm, and are found generally attached to the leaves of a tree called the Asia (Pentaptera tomentosa.)

By the advice of a scientific byra- gi or religious mendicant, he caused a quantity of some mineral poison (Mohri) to be mixed up in balls of rice such. as are usually given to tame Elephants, which were strewed about in the places chiefly haunted by the wild animals. The bait took effect ; a great humber ofthe Elephants were destroyed by the poison; it'is said that upwards: of eighty dead car- cases were found, the rest decamped in alarm, and have since 1 understand made their appearance in the jungles of another quarter. From the incon- siderable size of the herds which frequented Moherbenj, it seems highly probable that the Elephant is not indigenous to the province, and it is said that the breed had its origin in the escape of some of the tame animals from < their keepers in former ages. 1 am too ignorant of the subject to attempt to speak of the Ornithology ofthe Cuttack province. Of all the feathered tribe that I have seen in the district, I have been most struck with the Dhanesa or Indian Buceros, which is found in large flocks in Khurda, und'is there called the Kuchila-kh. i or Kuchila- eater from the circumstance of its delighting to feed on the fruit"], [28, "22 ON ORISSA PROPER of the Strychnos nux vomica. The bird has a most singular appearance, particularly when flying, with its long neck stretched out horizontally, and the huge protuberance rising from the upper mandible ofthe bill distinctly visible from a great distance. This protuberance or horn, in the Khi'irda spe-. cies, measures often seven inches from base to peak, and about two and a half in height from the upper mandible. The flesh is much prized by the natives, who consider it a sovereign remedy for the rheumatic pains called Bdi, and is often kept prepared in a particular way, with spices, for four or five years. The loud screaming and chattering noise which announce always the presence of the Indian horn bill, well entitle it to its place in tbe Lin- n\u00e6 an order Pica?. The province of Cuttack is watered by innumerable streams, which swell into rivers of magnitude during the rains, but few of them have any current throughout the year. I shall mention only the principal rivers, as it would be tedious and endless to attempt an enumeration of the almost counties* ramifications, which strike off from the larger channels about the centre of the Mogulbandi, and assumes new and independent appellations. The chief stream in name, importance, length of course, and the associations connect ed with it by popular superstition, is the Mahanadi, which is said to rise near Bastar, and after passing Sembelpur and Sonepur, (at which latter place it receives the waters of the Tel Nadi) it enters the Mogulbandi division at the station of Cuttack, where it throws off its principal arm the Cajori inclining to the southward, and another on the north-east face of the town called the Berfipa. Afterwards pursuing an easterly course verging to south, it sends off to the northward another large river called the Ciiittertola, and numerous smaller arms, until at Paradip, it divides into two or three considerable branches, and empties itself by two principal mouths into the sea a little south of False point* having completed a course of more than 500 miles. The breadth of this river at Sembelpur, 1 60 miles distant from Cuttack, is nearly a mile during the rains, and opposite to the town of Cuttack its bed measures fall two miles across. After this, the main channel narrows very considera bly. It deposits universally a coarse sand (intermixed with numerous frag-"], [29, "OR CUTTACK. 23 raents of different coloured quartz and scales of Mica) destructive of coir, se to the fertility of any land on which it may be carried by iri imdation, and its bottom is singularly irregular and uneven. During the rains' the Ala hanadi may be navigated as far nearly as Ryepur distant fully 300 miles from the point of confluence with the sea, though the passage is rendered difficult in the higher parts by rocks. A great portion of the bed however is dry for five or six months ofthe year, and it is fordable from Jariuary to June, even at the toAvn of Cuttack. The principal channel of the Cajori terminates in the Alankar which is deep and^narrow, and pursues a singularly tortuous course until it is lost a midst a variety of smaller ramifications. A bout half way between Cuttack and the sea, the Cajori sends off a large branch which after dividing, doub ling upon itself, and again branching out in indescribable intricacies, enters the sea at last in abroad channel about forty miles north of the Black Pago da, under the name ofthe Deb Nadi. Another large stream leaves the above' opposite to Cuttack, and subsequently divides into three principal rivers\", the Bhargabi, Daya, and Kusbbadra which flow south inclining a little to the East. The latter enters the sea between the Black Pagoda aildPoo ree. The two former uniting again into one stream, discharge their waters into the Chilka lake (as do other branches ofthe Bhargabi) called by various names at different stages of their course, and finally tile Harcharidi. AU these deposit coarse sand like the parent stream. Next to the Mahdnadi, the Brahmani and the Byterini are the most important rivers of the district. The former, soon after entering the M'o gullx.r.di, throws off a branch called the Karsua which equals either in size. All the three, after frequently1 dividing and branching ofi, unite with the Berftoa (before mentioned as an arm of the Mahanadi) at different points of their courses, and flow into the Mahanadi in two or three large .channels forming the Kanka Island or Delta near Point Palmyras. Some of these rivers deposit a portionrof fertilizing mud near the mouth, as well as-mueh coarse sand. i>"], [30, "24 ON ORISSA PROPER To the northward of the above, the Solandi, Kans Bans, Burabalang and the Subanrekha, are all respectable rivers, more especially the two latter. They deposit near their mouths a considerable quantity of fine mud as well as sand. Tne whole of the Mogulbandi between the Chilka lake and the Brahma ni river, is peculiarly subject to inundation from its proximity to the hills, and the astonishing rapidity with which the torrents descend in the rains ; the strange conformation of the channels of some of the principal rivers, which are very broad within the hills, but divide soon after leaving them into a number of narrow streams ; and also from the practice which has existed from very old times of using embankments. As an instance of rapid rise, it deserves to be recorded that, during the heavy rains of 1317, the waters of the Ca jori rose in one night a height of eighteen feet, as ascertained by careful measurement. This immense volume of water, which was then perhaps one and a half mile in breadth by thirty or forty feet depth, over-topped the general level of the town and station by a height of nearly six feet, and was only restrained from overwhelming them, by a solid embankment faced with stone and supported by buttresses, the work of former governments. The defence alluded to, however, called the revetment, has yielded in pla ces within the memory of man, and the consequences were of course most tremendous. The Cuttack rivers are generally swollen to an extreme height about three times during each rainy season, and at such periods the crops and villages in many portions of the district, are exposed to imminent ha zard. To guard against the evil as much as practicable, embankments have been always maintained by government, at a large expense. Such works are indispensibly necessary in the state to which things have been brought, but they obviously only aggravate the evil in the long run, and sometimes occasion direct mischief, by being injudiciously constructed to suit the interests of particular parties, without a due advertence to the general wel fare. The embankments or bunds are solid mounds of earth well sloped and turfed on either side, the principal ones measuring from forty to fifty and sixty feet in breadth, and eight to sixteen in height. The havoc occa-"], [31, "OR CUTTACK. 25 sioned by the bursting of one of these large bunds is generally most seri ous. The torrent rushes through with a frightful roar and velocity, tearing up trees by the roots, prostrating houses, and washing clean away every trace of the labours of the peasantry. The devastations of the flood too are in general more permanently commemorated, by a deposit of coarse sand, which renders the soil in the neighbourhood of the breach unfit for tillage for years afterwards. The Chilka lake forms too material a feature in the geography of Orissa Proper, to be passed over unnoticed in this paper. The general opinion of Europeans, on a casual inspection, has been that it was formed by an irruption ofthe ocean, and it is worthy of remark that the native histories record the oc- currence of such an event, about the beginning ofthe third century of the Chris- tian \u00e6ra, to which they universally ascribe the formation ofthe Chilka. It is separated from the sea for many miles by a long narrow strip of sand, sel- dom more than three hundred yards in breadth, and discharges its waters by an outfall, which has been lately excavated about a mile north of Manikpa- tam, the old one having become nearly choked up with sand. Its form is very irregular, the greatest diameters measuring from N. E. to S. W. thirty- five, and from E. by N. to W. by S. eighteen miles. To the southward, it is divided into numerous narrow channels by large inhabited islands, and for a long way it can scarcely be distinguished from the channel of the Harchandi, which flows into it. The general depth is about four or five feet, greatest depth six feet ; and it is considered to be rapidly filling up from the sand and mud brought into it by the Daya, Bhargabi, and vari ous smaller streams, which empty their waters into that basin. The Per gunnahs Rahang, Seraen, Chowbiskud, Killahs Roreng, Kokla, Khurda, and the Jagir of Kerar Mohammed, encircle or touch its shores for nearly two-thirds of the whole circumference. On the Ganjam side the hill estates of Calicote and Palur occupy the remaining interval.

On the Cuttack side its shores are flat, marshy, and destitute of picturesque beauty, but the opposite banks from Banpiir to Rhamba exhibit scenerj of a very romantic and ' diversified character. The hills of Khurda, Gumser, and Calicote, are seen extending along the whole of the south western face in irregular chains and groups of moder ate elevation, some of which jut into the lake, forming low rocky points or promontories. The Chilka itself, north of Paliir, expands into a majestic sheet of water, interspersed with a few rocky Islands, and enlivened by boats either sailing along before the wind, or forced on by punting with bamboo poles called laggis, or stationary for the purposes of fishing. If the visitor is curious enough to approach these islands, he will be struck with their singular conformation. They consist entirely of huge rounded blocks of a highly indurated porphyritic granite, containing large crystals of felspar, on which the hammer will scarcely make any impression, tossed and piled on each other in the wildest confusion, and exhibiting every symp tom of violent convulsion and disturbance. Some of the masses are ar- ranged in the form of fortresses with huge round bastions, and others pre sent much the appearance of some grand edifice of ancient days, in ruins. A scanty soil which has formed on their summit, by what, process one can not readily conceive, gives nourishment to a few peepul trees, mimosas, euphorbias, and gramineous plants. They are the resort of numerous. aquatic birds, chiefly of the Saras kind, who enjoy exclusive andjundis- turbed possession, except when roused occasionally by the approach of a chance visitor.

Its situation on a tongue of land or peninsula, near the bifurcation of the Mahdnadi, k. commanding both in a political and commercial point of view, though these advantages have been in some degree counterbalanced, by the outtoy in curred in defending it by stone revetments, from the encroachment of the rivers which wash two of its sides. The hilly country of Rajwara seen from its environs furnishes a pleasing and picturesque prospect. The real etymology of the word Cuttack is Katak signifying in Sanscrit a royal residence, or seat of empire. It was one of the five Kataks, or Capitals of Gangeswara Deo, the second prince of the Gang Bans line, and is still distinguished by the natives as Katak Biranasi or Benares, by which name also it is mentioned in Ferishteh 's History of Bengal, and in the Ayin Ac beri. The denomination Biranasi. however, has been in latter times confined mostly to a village, or Patna, which stands near the point of separation ofthe Mahanadi and Cajori rivers, about four miles distant from the town. Authorities vary as to the date of the foundation of Katak Biranasi, but there seems good reason to think that it became a capital city as early as the end of the tenth century, during the reign ofthe Kesari princes. Chow dwar, Jajpur, and Pipley, divided with it at different periods, the honor and advantage of accommodating the Hindu court of Orissa. The only monument of the Gajpati Rajas- which their ancient capi tal exhibits, is the fortress of Barabati, built probably in the 14th cen tury by Raja Anang Bhim Deo.

The Mohammedan or Marhatta governors added a round bastion at the N.

D. 1750. The fort has double walls built of stone, the inner of which enclose a rectangular area measuring 2150 by 1800 feet. The entrance lies through a grand gateway on the east, flanked by two lofty square towers, having the sides inclining inwards, from the base to the sum- mit. A noble ditch faced with masonry surrounds the whole, measuring in the broadest part two hundred and twenty feet across. From the centre of the fort rises a huge square bastion or cavalier supporting a flag staff. This feature, combined with the loftiness ofthe battlements on the river face\\, give to the edifice an imposing, castellated appearance, so much so that the whole when seen from the opposite bank of the Mahanadi, presented to the imagination of Mr. La Motte, who travelled through the province in 1767 A.

The number of inhabitants does not exceed 10,000. Balasore is nevertheless the prin cipal port of the district, and is provided with dry docks on the banks of the river, to which sloops, drawing not more than fourteen feet water, can be floated during the spring tides. It is frequented chiefly by three descrip-"], [36, "30 ON ORISSA PROPER tians of country craft, viz. Maldive vessels, the boats employed in trans porting the Company's salt to the presidency, and a class of sloops built at Contai and Hidgelly called Holas, which come in great numbers during the, cold weather to carry off rice to Calcutta. The importance formerly attached to this station, in the infancy ofthe commerce between the western hemisphere and Bengal, is attested by the re mains ofthe factories of four European nations, English, French, Danish, and Dutch. Traces of a Portuguese establishment are also to be observed, in the ruins of a small Roman Catholic Chapel within the town, having a wooden cross; over the principal doorway. The Dutch seem to have been settled item prior to 1660 A. D. ; at least that date is- discoverable on two curious monumental pyramids of masonry, which rise near the factory. We know that the English formed their first Bengal establishment at Pipley on the Subanrekha in 1640 A. D. and the date 1684 A. D. is to be observed on a tomb in the English burying-ground at the place. The magnitude of the Company's establishment here, may be estimated from the number of large obelisks and obituary columns still standing in the burying-ground, erected to the memory of our predecessors who ended their days in this remote corner. The English bad likewise a fine country house surrounded with gardens, at a place called Balramgerhi near the sea, the remains of which may still be seen, and will always be viewed with interest from its having afforded a temporary shelter to several of the Company's servants, wdien Calcutta was captured by the armies' of Seraj fid Dowlah in 1756 A.

Being very wide, with the temple rising majesti cally at the southern end, it presents by no means an unpicturesque appear ance, but the filth and stench, the swarms of religious mendicants and other nauseous objects, which offend one's senses in every part ofthe town, quite dispel any illusion which the scene might otherwise possess. Fine luxu riant gardens and groves enclose the town on the land side, and produce the best fruit in the province. The stately and beautiful Callophyllum Inophyllum, called by Dr. Ainslie the Alexandrian Laurel, grows here in great abundance, and the Cashew-nut thrives with peculiar luxuriance. The environs exhibit some fine tanks, as the Indra Daman, Chandan, Markandeswar Talao, &c. which are supposed to be very ancient ; and the inquisitive stranger who may be disposed to explore amidst the sand hills situated between the sea and the S. W. face of the town, will find many ancient and curious looking religious edifices, nearly overwhelmed with sand, to excite and reward attention. The climate of Jagannath, is the most agreeable and salubrious probably in all India, during the hot months from March to July. At this season the south-w7est monsoon blows from the sea in a steady and refreshing breeze, which seldom fails until the approach of the rains, and every door and window is thrown open to court its entrance. A visit to Jagannath has in some cases proved as beneficial to the European constitution, as a sea voyage. The Manufactures and Trade of Orissa Proper are very inconsiderable and unimportant. A sufficiency of the coarser cloths is made for the use of the inhabitants, in all parts ofthe district. The Calicoes of Balasore, Soro, E"], [38, "ON ORISSA PROPER 32 Badrak, Janjipur and Hariharpur, were once much prized and sought after under the name of Sannahs, but the demand for the finer fabrics of that description having long since greatly declined, the quantity now ma nufactured is very trifling. At Piply Niur a good sort of quilt is made. The province must certainly, a century or two since, have afforded some encouragement to the resort of European traders, as besides the large es tablishment at Balasore, the English had inferior factories or kothis at tbe town of Cuttack itself, and at Hariharpur, a village between that station and the sea. At present the whole value ofthe exports and imports, which pay duty, is only Sa. Rs. 2,97,285, and the customs and transit duties collect ed at the several small ports and inland chokies from the Subanrekha to the Dhamra river, do not exceed Sa. Rs. 30,000 per annum. The exports liable to duty are as follows .\u2014Piece goods, bees wax, iron, kut'h (the in spissated juice of the khayar or mimosa chadira,) oil, lac, stone plates, sal timber, congni wood, kurbeli, shurbeli and petty articles. A considerable exportation of rice takes place from the several small ports along the coast to Calcutta. The horned cattle and swine of the district also are carried out in large herds for tbe supply ofthe presidency market. The quantity of salt now transported from the district by private individuals, in the course of legal and open traffic, does not perhaps exceed 20,000 maunds annually ; but formerly salt was an important article of export by way ofthe great road leading along the Mahanadi to Sembelpur and Berar, and likewise by that of the Bamangati pass in Moherbanj, more than three lacs of maunds being exported annually. The dried fish and prawns ofthe Chilka lake may be noticed as an article of traffic, between the inhabit ants of the hills, and those of the low country in that quarter. Piece goods, silk, good tobacco, and every thing in the shape of a luxury, are imported from the adjoining districts of Bengal, and a small supply of couris, cocoanuts, coral, and dried fish is obtained from the few Maldive vessels, which resort annually to Balasore and Dhamra, to take on board cargoes of rice and earthen pots."], [39, "OR CUTTACK. 33 Casts, Man ners, Popula tion, &c. The four great tribes into which the Hindu part of the population is divided, are of course the same in Orissa as elsewhere, and have the same origin ascribed to them. The ordinary casts and professions of the pro vince are known by the name of the thirty-six Pathaks \" Chattis Pdt hak,\" the individuals composing which are all either Sudras, or of what is called the \" Sankara Verna,\" that is, a mixed impure race, proceeding from the promiscuous intercourse of some of the four tribes in the first instance, and again from their commerce with the descendants of such a connec tion, or the indiscriminate cohabitation of those descendants amongst one another. Pathak signifies literally a learner, it being the duty ofthe whole of these casts either to perform service to the three higher tribes, or if they cannot gain a livelihood in that way, to I earn the various arts and trades which are useful to Society. Of the Utcala Brahmins, I shall speak more particularly below. The proper, genuine Khetris, are I believe considered to be extinct, and those who represent them are by the learned held to be only Sudras. There are eight classes or families who claim to represent the military and re gal tribe, known by the affixes or titles of Dhir, Dhai, Towang, Mal, Bhanj, Rai', Rawat, and Khandait. The only professions of the pure Vaisya or Byse tribe, in Cuttack, are the two classes of Baniyas called the Gandha Baniya or druggist, and Swerna Baniya or money changer. The following are considered apparently genuine Sudras, viz. The Gowala (Gopa) milkman ; Bhandari (napita) barber ; Gowria (Gourakara) vender of sugar ; the Chasa (Krishakara) or husbandman ; and the Talica or seller of Areca nut. The designation of Or or Odra is applied as it were par excellence to the class of husbandmen, who are commonly called Or Cha sa. Such of that tribe as perform the duties of Paiks in the hills, and of sirdar village watchmen in the plains, are called Or Paik and Or Khandait, The first set ofthe mixed casts or (Sankara Verna) springing from inter marriage of original tribes, chiefly Byse and Sooder, and which with excep- E 2"], [40, "34 ON ORISSA PROPER tion to the two last, rank next below the pure Sudra, is composed as fol lows, viz.

Gaura, Saraswati, Canyacubja or Cannouj, Mait'hila, Utcala, Tailanga, Carnata, Maharashtra, and Dravira. Their duties are said to be Yojana, Adhyayan, and Dan, or sacrificing, reading the Vedas, and giving alms; and their regular means of subsistence Yctjan, Adhydpan andJPra tigraha, or officiating at sacrifices, teaching the Vedas, and receiving cha rity. If they cannot gain an adequate livelihood by the regular modes, they may eat at a feast in the house of a Sudra, or receive charity from one of that class ; also they may cut firewood from the hills and jungles, and sell it. Should these resources fail, they may, after fasting for three days, steal a little rice from the house of a Brahmin or any other, in order that the king hearing of their distress by this means, may assign something for their maintenance. Should all these expedients prove insufficient, they may en gage in the duties of the Cshatriya and Vaisya, but as soon as they have collected a little property, they must repent and return to their original oc cupations. The Brahmins who confine themselves to the six duties and employments above noticed, are of course the most honoured and es teemed. Inferior Brahmins are those called Devalaca, and Grama Ya jaka, who attend the village gods, and perform funeral obsequies for hire. There is another class known commonly in Orissa by the name of Mahas t'han or Mastan Brahmins, who form a very considerable and important class of the rural population. Besides cultivating with their own hands gardens of the kachu (Arum Indicum), cocoanut, and Areca, and the pi per beetle or pan, they very frequently follow the plough, from which cir cumstance they are called Halia Brahmins, and they are found every where in great numbers in the situation of Moqeddems and Serberakars, or hereditary renters of villages. Those who handle the plough glory in their occupation, and affect to despise the Bed or Veda Brahmins, who live upon alms.

People ofthe plaius. ers of malguzari land, in Orissa. Their moral and intellectual Avorth indeed, seems to rise exactly in proportion to their emancipation from those shackles of prejudice and superstitious observances, which narrow the minds, and debase the natures of the higher and orthodox class. I have not been able to trace satisfactorily the origin and history of these Mastan Brahmins, who I am informed resemble exactly the cultivating Brahmins of Tirhoot and Behar, but the point is one w7ell worthy of investigation. The Oorias as a nation are justly described by Abul Fazl to be very effeminate, that is they are extremely deficient in manly spirit, their figures are slight and delicate, and the costume of the males has little to distin guish it from that of the females, except the different manner of wearing the cloth fastened about the loins. They are moreover equally ignorant and stupid. Orissa might be termed the B\u0153otia of India, with reference to the intellectual dullness of its inhabitants, as compared with the people of any other province. A striking proof of the estimation in which their capacity has been ever held, is the fact, that in all ages and under all go vernments since the downfal of the Orissan monarchy, the principal official employments throughout the province have been engrossed by foreign ers \u2014 by Bengalees, north, and Telingas, south of the Chilka Lake\u2014 owing I really believe in a great measure to the difficulty of selecting from its in digenous population, persons properly qualified for trusts of difficulty and importance. The mass of the people are little prone to the commission of crimes of a daring and heinous character, as might be inferred from the fe minine spirit above ascribed to them ; but they are well versed in all the arts of low cunning, dissimulation, and subterfuge, and the love of intrigue forms a prominent feature in their character, however clumsy many of their attempts to mislead or circumvent. Their manners are sufficiently dissolute, a failin0* not to be wandered at considering the obscene character, and im pure symbols, of the demoralizing religion which they profess. In justice however to the bulk of the agricultural population it must be said that the ryots of Cuttack are extremely industrious, though they work with little spirit or intelligence, and altogether the Oorias of the plains, whatever"], [44, "38 ON ORISSA PROPER Population of tlie hill coun tries. their faults, are certainly the most mild, quiet, inoffensive, and easily ma naged people in the Company's provinces. They furnish too a valuable* class of servants known as the Balasore bearers, in whom tbe virtues of fi delity aud honesty (according to their own conception of those qualities) are conspicuous. The inhabitants of the hills, and of the jungles on the sea shore, differ chiefly from the population ofthe Mogalbandi, in that they are more shy, sullen, inhospitable, and uncivilized than the latter. Their chiefs, the Khan daits or ancient Zemindars of Orissa, who claim to represent the regal and military class, are grossly stupid, barbarous, debauched, tyrannical, and slaves of the most grovelling superstition. Whatever the cause of the de gradation ascribed to them in a very curious passage of the Institutes of Menu, if subjection to Brahmins could redeem their lost dignity, they have long since entitled themselves to the recovery of their station amidst the four great classes of the Hindu nation. The passage above alluded to is this, \" The following races of Cshatriyas by their omission of holy rites, and by \" seeing no Brahmins, have gradually sunk amongst men to the lowest of \" the four classes, viz. Paundracas, Odras* and Draviras, Cambojas, Ya \" vanas and Sakas ; Paradas, Pahlavas, Chinas, Ciratas, Deradas, and \" Chasas.\" The Paiks or landed militia of the Rajwara, combine with the most profound barbarism, and the blindest devotion to the will of their chiefs, a ferocity and unquietness of disposition, which have ever rendered them an important and formidable class ofthe population ofthe province. They comprehend all casts and classes, chiefly perhaps the Chasa or culti vating tribe; occasionally individuals ofthe lowest casts are found amongst them, as Kandras, Pans and Bawaris (Sanscritice Berber or Barbarians :) and the fashion has often prevailed of adopting into their order some of the more savage inhabitants of the remote hills, called Kands, as also even Mussulmans and Telingas. It is well known that they are paid by service lands, which they cultivate with their own hands in time of peace, * Oorias."], [45, "OR CUTTACK. 39 subject to the performance of military and rude police duties whenever called upon by their chiefs. Abulfazl states the number of Paiks or zemin dari militia (in the original, Sipah-i-zemindari) liable to be required for the service of the state according to the conditions of the tenure of the zemin dars, at about 1,55,000 for the present districts of Cuttack and Midnapore, which probably formed but a small part of the entire force maintained by those chiefs. The Paiks of this part ofthe country are divided into three ranks distinguished by names taken from their occupations, or the weapons which they use chiefly, viz. 1st. The Pahris, who carry a large shield made of wood covered with hides and strengthened by knobs and circles of iron, and the long straight national sword of Orissa, called the khanda. They are stationed chiefly as guards. 2nd. The Baniia, win? use the matchlock principally now (in lieu of their old missile weapons), but have besides a small shield and sword. It was their duty to take the field principally and go on distant expeditions. 3rdly. The Dhenkiyas who are armed with bows and arrows, and a sword, and perform all sorts of duties. The war dress of the Paiks consists, or did consist, of a cap and vest made of the skin of the tyger or leopard ; a sort of chain armour for the body and thighs ; and a girdle formed ofthe tail of some wild animal. Be sides the terror inspired by these unusual habiliments, they farther height ened the ferocity of their appearance by staining their limbs with yellow clay, and their countenances with vermillion, thus exhibiting altoge ther as savage and fantastic an air, as one can well conceive to invest the national army of any country or people.

Exclusive ofthe regular Ooria population ofthe Brahminical persuasion, there are three remarkable races inhabiting the hilly region (noticed above under the general designation of Pulinda or barbarous mountaineers) which merit a separate description in this place, I mean the Coles, Kands and Sours. They are quite distinct, the two former at least, in language, fea tures, manners, and religion from the Hindus of the plains, and the sup posi tion seems plausible that their ancestors may have been the aborigi nal inhabitants of the country, prior to the arrival of the Brahmin colonists from the north who now possess India. No such tradition or belief how ever exists in the province. These three tribes should perhaps be consi dered merely as branches ofthe same original stock, but as the offsets, if such they are, are found under different names and circumstances in differ ent parts of the province, it will be convenient to mention them separately. The Coles are divided into thirteen different tribes, viz. Kol, Lurka-kol, Chowang, Sarvanti, Dhurowa, Bah6ri, BTiunian or Bhsimiah, Khan dwal,. Santal, Sour, Bhumij, Batholi and Amavat. Their original coun try is said to be Kolant Des, which the natives describe as a hilly tract lying between Moherbanj, Sinhbhum, Jynt, Bonye, Keonjher and Dal bhum. They have however for many years gained possession of parts of Chota Nagpore, Jaspur, Tymar, Patcura and particularly of Sinhbhum ; their encroachments upon Moherbanj have been felt as seri ous ; some tribes (the Bhuniahs) are found settled in the back parts of Nilgiri, and from their restless disposition and constant endeavours to extend their possessions, they have proved troublesome neighbours even to the powerful Keonjher Raja. The Coles are a hardy and athletic race, black and ill favored in their countenances, ignorant and savage to the last degree, but their houses, built entirely of wood, are said to exhibit"], [47, "OR CUTTACK. 41 a considerable degree of neatness and comfort, and they carry on a very ex tensive cultivation. Their arms are the bow and arrow, and a small iron battle-axe called Tangi, in the use of which they display much spirit and dexterity. This people own none of the Hindu divinities, and indeed seem scarcely to have any system of religious belief whatever, but four things are held by them in high veneration, the Sahajna tree (Hyperan thera Morunga,) paddy, oil expressed from the mustard seed, and thedo\u00b0\\ In all their contracts and negociations, the leaf of the former is always in troduced, and they rub each other with ojl which is considered to give so lemnity to she proceeding. They have also a curious method of striking a bargain or concluding a pacification, which will not fail to remind the classical reader ofthe origin ofthe word stipulation. I allude to the cir cumstance of their breaking a straw (stipula) between the disputants, a practice which always follows or precedes the final adjustment of any com pact. The Coles are passionately fond of fermented liquors, and eat all kinds of flesh and grain, as well as various roots which grow spontaneously in their jungles called the Buenjkarba, Charmika, Tanka, Pacbali, Pani Alu, Massia and Mankacliu. The flesh of the hog is particularly prized by them, so much so that every house of the Coles almost is said to hayp the appendage of a piggery. They are governed chiefly by numerous petty sirdars, or heads of villages, called Manki and Munda, but acknow ledge allegiance, and in some cases pay tribute, to the hill zemindars jn whose countries they are settled. The Kands are found in great numbers in all the hill estates south of -the Mahanadi. They form the principal part of the population of Kil- lah Ranpur which has thence been called the Kandreh Dandpat, The natives also have the idea of a district situated between Daspalla, Boad, .and Gumsir, inhabited entirely by this tribe of hill people which they call Kandra. I believe that the yast unexplored tracts of fountain and forest lying at the back of the Ganjam and Vizagapatam hill estates, down <as far as the Godaveri, are peopled chiefly by Kands in a very savage \" ' V 2"], [48, "ON ORISSA PROPER 42 state, who differ little probably from their neighbours the Gonds, though Captain Blunt observes on the authority of the Jaghirdar of Malud and Manickpatam, (vide Journal of his route from Chunar to Vertnagoodum), that the Coands and Goands are to be considered quite distinct races.* The Sours are found chiefly in the jungles of Khlirda, from Banpur to Cuttack, and in the woods of Atgerh, Daljora, &c. which skirt the foot of the hills for some way to the northward ofthe Mahanadi. They are in general a harmless, peaceable race, but so entirely destitute of all moral sense, that they will as readily and unscrupulously deprive a human being of life, as any wild beast of the woods, at the orders of a chief, or for the most trifling remuneration. Thus during the insurrection which prevailed in Khurda, they were the agents employed to carry into execution most ofthe schemes of revenge planned by its instigators, whenever helpless in dividuals were to be the sacrifice, and the quantity of blood shed by the hands of these ignorant savages without motive or remorse, during the above period of anarchy and disorder, is almost incredible. In ordinary times they are considered very useful both by the zemindars and villagers, in clearing the jungles and providing fuel Which are their chief means of gaining a subsistence. They likewise collect the produce ofthe woods, and dispose of large quantities to the druggists and fruit; sellers, in the neigh bouring bazars. They are distinguishable from the other natives ofthe pro vince, by their inferiority of stature, mean appearance, and jet black co lour, as well as by an axe for cutting wood, the symbol of their profession, which they always carry in their hand.

Some are fixed in small villages called Sour Sais; others lead a migra tory sort of life, clearing annually spots in the jungle, where they erect huts of sticks, leaves, and grass, and sow different sorts of grain ofthe Millet kind, as the Jooar, Bajereh, Makye, Mandea, &c. which sprout up with ex traordinary luxuriance in such situations. They will eat almost any kind of food, whether animal or vegetable. A great part of their subsistence is derived from the roots and produce of the jungles. The flowers of the Madh tika (Bassia latifolia), and the Keora,* yield them an intoxicating liquor; in lieu of rice they consume the seed ofthe bamboo, a very heat ing and indigestible food ; the wild yams, arums, and other roots furnish a nutritious, and not unwholesome substitute for bread ; and for a desert they have the wild mangoe, the fruit of the Bela every where abundant, and the seeds of the Bauhinia racemosa, served up on the large ribbed leaf ofthe Ravya (apparently a species of Dillenia), which answers the purpos es of a dish.

As the fable of the existence of such a country in this part of India seems to be a purely gratuitous invention of the Mahommedan writers, and is not supported ei ther by the histories or the current belief of the natives of the province, 1 shall not here stop to inquire into its meaning and origin.

Most of the titles of which the natives are so fond are pure Sanscrit ; more than three-fourths ofthe nouns and roots of verbs may be traced to that language, and its few simple inflec tions are obviously founded on the rules ofthe Vyakaran. The basis of the alphabet is the common Hindi or Nagari character, somewhat disguised however by a peculiarity in the mode of writing it. In the direction of Ben gal, the Ooria language is used tolerably pure, following the line ofthe coast as far as the Hijellee ana Tumlook divisions at least, I have been credibly informed that in the Mysadal Pergunnah, all revenue accounts are written on tai patr or leaves of the palmyra tree in that dialect. On the western side of the Midnapore district, the two languages begin to intermingle, at Ra ni Sarai about twenty miles north of the Subanrekha. A very mixed and impure bhasha is used in the Zemindari of Naraingerh and the hill estates beyond it, which improves a little at Midnapore (itself situated in a Jungle Mehal called Bhanjbhutn) and at that town becomes more decidedly Bengali. The inhabitants of the country on the north of Keerpoy (offici- ally termed the Jungle Mehals) probably speak the language of the Ben- gal province quite correct and unmixed. To the westward the Gond and Ooria languages pass into each other on the e.Ute of Sonepur, the Raja of which country informed me that half his peaple speak one and half the other dialect. Oa the south we find the first traces of the Telin- ga about Ganjam, where a different pronunciation may be observed.

There is no deficiency how ever of translations of the more esteemed writings of the great Hindu au thors, both religious and scientific, and every temple of importance has its legend or Sthan Puran, every almanack maker his Panji, and Bansa- bali, composed in the local tongue. In estimating the amount ofthe Population ofthe Cuttack Province I shall begin with candidly confessing, that we have no means of forming even a tolerable guess at the number of inhabitants in the hill countries. Information on that subject could be procured only from the hill Rajas or Zemindars, and such are their jealousy, contumacy, and untractableness, that we might be sure, even if they condescended to furnish any returns at all, they would be entirely false. The estimate given below for the Mogulbandi, and that portion of the Rajwara which lies between it and the sea, though mostly conjectural, is founded upon data of a nature which warrant some confidence in its accuracy. The total of villages has been tolerably well ascertained from the returns made by the Police Offi cers at different periods. To be enabled to strike an average for the num ber of houses and inhabitants, I have obtained Khaneh Shumari ac counts, on which I can depend, for a few Pergunnahs,both at the northern and southern extremity of the district, and in the central parts. The results deducible are as follows : The eighteen Police Thanas* of the Mogulbandi including the Rajwa ra estates of Aul, Kanka, Kujang, Herispur, Marichpur, and Bishen pur, with the whole ofthe smaller Killajat, contain 11,915 villages (Mou zahs and Patnas) and 243,272 houses, exclusive ofthe towns of Cuttack, Balasore, and Puri.

In the three northern Thanas which comprize the poorest and most unproductive portion of the Mo gulbandi, the average is scarcely nineteen ; in the twelve central ones it is nearly twenty ; and in the three southern ones which contain the Per , gunnahs adj@ining Puri, filled with the large villages of the Sasan Brah mins, it is thirty. Again, in the first mentioned division, the ascertained number of inhabit ants, men, women, and children in 1678 houses is 9576; yielding an average of rather more than five and two-third inmates for each house. In the se cond, 5,758 houses have been found to contain 27,643 souls, or on an aver age nearly four and four-fifths per house. In the southern division, 19,930 houses have been ascertained to hold 1,30,871 inmates, viz. men 33,518, women 33,903, infants 36,450, that is five and a fraction of about one-fifth per house. Adverting to these data which have. been prepared with much care and accuracy, more especially in the Southern division, an average rate of five per house, for the whole district, would not appear too high.

Salt is sold on the part of government at several golahs or store-houses in the interior, in quantities of not less than one maund, at the fixed monopoly price of Sicca Rupees two per maund, increased by charges of transportation, storing, commission, &c. which raise the price according * It Rlionld be observed, that although the Chasas are the proper cultivating caste of Orissa, many ofthe othci classes, tenant land, and pay revenue as ryots.

This system of supply has been established only since the be ginning of 1818. During the last four years, the average of the public sales for consumption within the Mogalbandi, has been 2,00,000 maunds. Mr. Colebrooke considers the quantity of one-fourth of a chittack per diem to be an ample allowance for an inhabitant of Bengal. In Cuttack, an allow ance of half a chittack is insisted upon by the people themselves as the usual average, when salt was cheap ; and the larger individual consump tion of the article in this district, is explained by a reference to the pecu liar diet of the people, the villainous insipidity of which must necessarily require to be relieved by an additional mixture of salt. Abulfazl has ob served of the Oorias, \" After boiling their rice they steep it in cold water and eat it the second day.\" This stale and unpalatable species of food is still universally used under the name of Panbhatta. As the enhanced price of salt under the British government, which certainly amounts to from 400 to 500 per cent, may have somewhat reduced the former consump tion by the poorer classes, that is the mass ofthe community, we shall per haps arrive near the truth by taking a medium between the Cuttack and Bengal allowances. Some deduction too must be made on account of chil- dren under ten years, whose numbers, adopting the average suggested by the Raheng returns, may be estimated at about one-third of the whole po pulation. The calculation of the quantity necessary for the Cuttack peo ple will then stand as follows in round numbers : Eight and a half lacs of adults, at between one-fourth and one-half chittacks per diem, consume annually - Mds. 1,75,000 Four and a half lacs of infants, at rather less than one- fourth do.

There can be no doubt but that a jarib or measurement of the lands of the three sircars Jelasir, Badrak and Cuttack, was made, under the orders and superintend ence of that distinguished minister, with what is termed the Bareh Dasti Padika or rod of twelve spans, and all the Ruqbeh accounts in the offices of the Sudder Canungos and their Gomashtehs, are stated to be founded on that measurement. The subsequent corrections and alterations that have taken place, are said to have been made only by Nezer Anddz'i or guess work. What is curious, the standard ofthe bigah, which was originally uniform, is now found to be different in every part ofthe district, to such an extent indeed, that in some Pergunnahs the bigah is four times the size of that nominal measure in other divisions, and all the intermediate variations frequently occur. By what rule the other great step in the settlement was adjusted, viz the determination ofthe rates of rent to be paid by the hus bandmen for a bigah of each description, I can find no evidence or informa tion whatever. Abul. izl in describing the Emperor's settlement for Hin dustan generally, says, that an average of ten years' collection was struck.* But whether in this province which had then only recently been con quered from its Hindu sovereigns, and rescued from the destructive anar chy of tlie Bengal Afghans, the ancient rates were maintained, or heavier ones imposed, I cannot venture to offer any assertion. My general im pression is that the fixed and regular assessment of the Moguls was hea vier than that of the Hindu Rajas, but the indigenous princes of Orissa seem to have had so many methods of extorting a large revenue from their subjects, by exti a demands, occasional requisitions, and irregular claims * VitTe Ajin Acl eri, part 3. \" For that purpose having formed an aggregate ofthe rates of col lection from the comn.cnceir.ent of the 16th year of the reign to the 24th inclusive, they took a tenth part of that total as the annual rate for ten years to come.\" G 2"], [56, "50 ON ORISSA PROPER under various heads and pretexts, that the burthens of the ryot may be pre sumed to have been pretty much the same under either administration. It is impossible to reconcile with any known or probable standard of collection, or any conceivable state of cultivation in the province, the ac count given in the Ayin Acberi and other works on Indian finance of the old Jamma of Orissa. Abulfazl rates the assessment of the entire Suba at 1,60,733,237 dams, or rupees 40,18,330, and that of the sircars Badrak and Cuttack which comprized the modern district, reaching from the Subanrekha to the Chilka lake, at 1 1,012,050 dams, or rupees 27,53,015, exclusive of the tribute of the hill estates. The Pere Thieffenthaler states the revenues as follows : Selon Manouehi, Selon le Registre, Rupees 57,07,500 14,282,100 Dams, or Rupees 16,57,800 But he justly observes \" En convertissant les Dams en Roupies la somme devient beancoup plus grande.\" It would be 35,70,525 Rupees, and I sus pect that the amount in Dams is intended to represent the recorded reve nues ofthe three Northern sircars, and that below, in rupees, the Jamma of all that remained of Orissa, as a separate province at the date of the entry in the register. The statements of the Revenue of Orissa furnished by Mr. Grant in his Analysis ofthe Finances of Bengal, tally nearly with those above noticed. The substance of his remarks on this point are as follows. During the reign of Shah Jehan, between 1627 and 1658 A. D.

It should be written 15,04,799, as the amount of 6,15,616 was quite a nominal entry. One half of this rated assessment, or about three lacs, was added to the Marhatta Jamma bandi, according to Mr. Grant, on the final dismemberment of the do minions ofthe Khurda Rajas under Raja Bir Kissore Deo. The registered assessments ofthe Moguls, I believe to be much higher than the province ever really paid, but there seems little prospect of this discre pance between the entries and actual collections of the imperial govern ment (which has been noticed in other parts of the country also) receiving a satisfactory explanation. In most revenue accounts, and especially in all the bills of sale of portions of a Talukdari or Moqeddemi authen ticated by the signature of the Sudder Canungo, which are now forth coming, two Jammas are always specified.

The word\" Tankhah'' (not Takeh or Tanka) certainly ordinarily means assignment, and Mr. J.

The excess of regular receipts under the head of land revenue alone, may be stated at from one to two lacs per annum in favor of the British go vernment, which increase may be fairly ascribed to the improved and more enlightened system of management now pursued. The country has un questionably in the main prospered under our administration, though much suffering was long experienced in particular quarters from injudicious mea sures, the errors of which have been perceived and remedied: cultivation has greatly increased in every part : and if the ryot or husbandman has not benefited by the change of government, in proportion to the superior importance of that class ofthe community to which he belongs, and to the benevolent intentions of the legislature, his condition must certainly be considered on the whole better than it was under the native system, whilst the higher classes connected with the soil (now acknowledged as Proprie- tors) have undoubtedly attained to a state of comfort, independence, and comparative opulence, quite unknown at any former period of the history of the country. The Revenue derived from the salt monopoly, exceeds the total amount of the land rents paid to the State, and is entirely the creation of the Bri tish government. The salt sold within the province yields a net return of about 3,00,000, and the quantity annually exported to Calcutta for public sale at the salt office, produces little short of from Rupees 15,00,000 to 16,00,000. Under the heads of customs, tax on spirituous liquors, and tax on pilgrims, a further net revenue of about one lac per annum is obtained by the pre sent government. The value of Cuttack to the Company therefore, after deducting expenses of management, may be fairly assumed at upwards of thirty lacs of Rupees per annum. In surveying attentively the ancient Political Institutions of Orissa as connected with the tenure of land, it is impossible not to be struck with the marked resemblance which many of their features exhibit to the sys tem of European policy called the feudal, at certain stages of its progress. I am strongly inclined to think that the comparison might be extended to"], [63, "DR CUTTACK. 57 India generally, and that a careful enquirer would not fail to discern in every quarter of the country, obvious traces of the former existence of such a system, however irregularly defined, and liable to variation in the details, from local peculiarities. The subject has not hitherto met with that attention which its importance, more especially when viewed in connection with the much disputed question of Zemindari rights, unquestionably me- rits. Some writers indeed have treated with utter contempt and derision, \u25a0the notion of the existence of any analogy whatever between the ancient institutions of India, and the feudal system of Europe. Others, however, of equal or greater authority, have not been able to resist the striking evi- dence of such affinity which presents itself in every province of India, where the Hindu form of government has been little impaired or modi- fied. Thus, Sir J. Malcolm, page 375 of bis valuable report on Malwa, observes, \" The principle of this part of a Raj or Rajput principality, dif- fers little from that feudal system which formerly existed in Europe, and is liable to the same vicissitudes in the relations and powers of the respec- tive parties.\" But every one knows that the Rajput, is only one branch or epithet of the great Regal and Military caste amongst the Hindus, called the Cshetriya (Khetri), and anciently all principalities and kingdoms might in one sense be designated Rajput. Captain MacMurdo in an excel- lent paper on the province of Cutch, in vol.ii. Bombay Transactions, states, \" The government of Cutch is that of a pure aristocracy, in which the -power is vested in a variety of chiefs on their respective territories, which bear a strong resemblance to the feudal baronies. These chiefs have a head who is entitled Rao, to whom they owe the duty of military service with their relations and followers when called upon.\" The chiefs in ques- tion are afterwards described to be Rajputs. Colonel Wilford expressly applies the title of Barons, to the inferior Khetris, in his historical Essays on ancient India. In the essay on Anugangam Ave find the following curious and apposite passage, \" Like Parasurama he (Maha Bali) either destroyed or drove out of his dominions the remnant of the Cshetris or Military tribe, and placed Sadras in their room. These were the Barom H 2"], [64, "ON ORISSA PROPER 58 of the land who often proved troublesome.

I shall have occasion to notice again hereafter, an opinion firmly enter tained by the better informed natives of Cuttack, of the ancient existence of a mighty empire, Avhich comprised within its limits nearly the whole of India, and was ruled by a sovereign residing at Hastinapura and Delhi. A general division is believed to have obtained of the lands of the country, into the domains of the supreme Raja (now called the Khaliseh), and the jurisdictions, or fiefs, of a vast number of great Military Chiefs and feudatory Rajas, ofthe Khetri caste, Avho were dependent on and owed service to the Lord Paramount, but whose degree of subordination of course underwent constant vicissitudes, according to the circumstances of the times, and the personal character ofthe ruling Emperor. The most powerful Lords of this empire Avere the great officers of state called the Gajapati, Aswapati, Chatrapati, and Narapati, who originally held their vast possessions as dependent fiefs subject to the condition of Military service, but aftenvards emancipated themselves from all control, and became independent mo- narchs ruling over numerous inferior Khetris. Supposing the above view of the ancient political condition ofthe coun try at large, to be chimerical and unsupported by sufficient evidence, which however I do not admit to be the case, I proceed to state what may be safely inferred or positively affirmed ofthe native institutions of Orissa, under the government of its indigenous princes, from a consldera-"], [65, "OR CUTTACK. 59 tion of the vestiges of the old system yet actually in existence. I shall af terwards notice the changes impressed on the face of things, by the two great revolutions Avhich the province has experienced in modern times ; first, its subjection to the Mussulman, and afterwards to the British rule. In the preceding part of my paper, I have noticed generally the great territorial divisions both natural and political which exist in this province. The extensive hilly regions and forest tracts, jungle Pergunnahs and Me hals, as they are noAV termed, reaching nearly from Bishenpur to the Goda veri, together Avith the Avoodland country on the sea shore of Orissa Pro per, have been in all ages parcelled out among and occupied by a number of Chieftains of the Military class. These Chiefs may be safely consider ed as de facto proprietors of their possessions under the native governments, that is to say they held them hereditarily, exercised uncontrolled territo rial jurisdiction Avithin their limits, and appropriated the entire revenues, subject to the condition of performing Military service, or other offices and duties, at the court of their superior Raja, the Gajapati, residing mostly at Cuttack, which services have in latter ages been generally commuted fora light tribute or money payment. The more fertile and productive division ofthe province (noAV the Mogulbandi) formed the Kot, Khaliseh, or domain of the prince, from Avhich the Hindu sovereigns of Orissa like their succes sors the Moguls, Marhattas, and English, derived their principal reve nues. There can be no question, I think, but that this other great territo rial division was the landed estate or property ofthe sovereign. I may ob serve, en passant, that such a state of things as abov7e indicated, conforms exactly Avith the declaration contained in a Avell known passage of the digest of Hindu law translated by Mr. Colebrooke : \" By conquest the earth became the property of Parasurama : by gift the property of the sage Casyapa and committed by him to Cshatriyas for the sake of protec tion, became tbeir protective property, successively held by poAverful con querors and not by subjects cultivating the soil.\" So strikingly and uni versally true indeed is the maxim of the property of the soil vesting in the Cshatriyas, that we find them always either asserting a title to owner-"], [66, "60 ON ORISSA PROPER ship in the land, which they occupy hereditarily, or in the actual enjoyment of the proprietary right, even when reduced to the situation of \" cultivat ing subjects' \u2014 Avitness the various castes and classes of Rajput village Ze mindars in every quarter of Hindustan, and the Avestern provinces. The feudal lords of Orissa, for such certainly may the Military Chiefs whom I have above referred to, be termed, are knoAvn and described by several different titles both in history, in official records and in the com mon language of the country, and these are quite indiscriminately applied, Avhence has resulted a corresponding confusion of ideas. They are called .simply Khetris (Cshetriyas,) from their caste ; Khandaits, an Orissa name for a branch (I believe a less pure one) of the same class, signifying lite rally persons entitled to wear the Khanda or national SAVord of Orissa ; Bhunia, Bhuyan or Bhumi derived from Bhu* the earth, and synonimous with Bhupati (Lord of the soil) : Poligar, a Telinga Avord, derived from Pollam, a fief: Sawant, in Persian, Sirdar, meaning Chief and Lord ; Seva \u25a0kan Arni Dar, or servants and vassals holding tracks of country hereditarily, on the condition of service ; and finally Zemindars. Many of them were de scended from the supreme Rajas ofthe country. We have Orme's authority in a remarkable passage of the 8th book of his history for the belief enter- tained by the Poligars south of the Chilka lake of their origin as above in- timated. He says, \" These conquests (made by a Raja of Orissa, some \" centuries before Mahommedanism) were distributed in many portions to his \" relations, officers and menial servants from whom several of the present \" northern Poligars pretend to be lineally descended, and to govern at this \" very time the very districts Avhich Avere then given to their ancestors.\" It is not improbable that many ofthe Orissan Khandaits and Bhfinias first received estates during the 12th century of the Christian \u00e6ra, in Raja Anang * Mr. Elliot, in his observations on the inhabitants of the Garrow hills transmitted to the Asiatic Society, observes, \" The head people ofthe villages are called Booniahs, a name used by tbe head Ra jas of Bengal when the king resided at Gour.\" In the Ayin Acberi, the word Boomi derived froiji Boom, the soil, is continually used as synonimous with Zemindar."], [67, "OR CUTTACK. 61 Bhim Deo's time, wbo is said to have created sixteen \u25a0 Sawants or great Lords, but the tenure of the majority no doubt reaches back to a very re mote antiquity. To describe a little more particularly their duties and offi ces, I may observe, that they Avere posted all round and along the frontiers of the Raj, with the view to defend it from the irruptions of neighbouring powers, or the incursions and devastations of the savage inhabitants of tbe wild regions in the interior, such as the Kands and Coles, Avho to this day give serious annoyance in many parts of the hill estates, and if the belief of their origin and ancient situation be well founded, Avere doubtless in former ages far more numerous and formidable than at present. In this point of view their situations and duties resembled much that of the Lords of the Marches in Europe. Nor is the above the only striking feature of analogy between the feudal lords of India and the Avestern hemisphere. The es tates or jurisdictions of that class in Orissa were always called by the Hindus, Gerhs, and by the Mussulmans, killahs or Castles. A certain part of the lands under the head Officer were parcelled out amongst several mi litary retainers and dependents called Naiks, Dalais, Dalbehras and some times Khandaits, who held of their superior on much the same principle, as he did ofthe supreme Raja, though generally speaking by a more limit ted and imperfect tenure. Under these again, a portion of the lands of each subordinate Gerh, were assigned as service land to the feudal Militia of the country, called Paiks, who folloAving equally the occupations of soldier and cultivator, were obliged at any moment Avhen called on by their leader, to take up arms, and accompany him to the field. In time of war the Khan- daits or nobility of Orissa at the head of their respective contingents of this landed militia, ranged themselves under the standard of theh sovereign, and formed the main part of his Military array. Thus AA7e frequently read of the Gajapati assembling his chiefs to attend on a warlike expedition, and we find that the Sunnuds, granted by the Mogul government (in cases where they exercised the right of investiture), always contained a condition that the Khandait should be ready to attend with his contingent, Avhen sum moned by the Military Officer of his division. The Paiks are of course the local Infantry constantly referred to in the Ayin Acberi. The authos"], [68, "62 ON ORISSA PROPER observes speaking of the imperial army ; \" The Zemindari troops alone are in number upwards of four million and four hundred thousand, as will hereafter be particularized\"\u2014 a fact Avhich shews the extensive prevalence of the Military tenure throughout tlie country even as late as the 16th cen tury. The proportion of landed militia set down for Orissa Proper in the same work, is about one hundred thousand. Besides the general obligation of Military service, the Indian feudatories were bound to do homage, and to perform certain nominal duties or offices resulting from their tenures, when in actual attendance on their liege lords, called by the expressive word Sewa, Seva, or service (in Persian Khidmat), a consideration of which, to compare small things Avith great, reminds one strongly of some of the an cient forms of the Germanic constitution. Thus it Avas the business of one to bear the sword of state; another held the shield; a third carried the umbrella or royal standard ; a fourth presented the Raja's slippers ; a fifth fanned him with the regal chouri, &c. The above services are to this day performed in the presence ofthe Khurda Rajas, by several ofthe hill Ze mindars, as often as they visit Puri, though the distinctive character ofthe office appropriated to each, has become a good deal merged in the simple duty of holding the chouri and pankha, in the presence of the representa tive of their ancient Lords Paramount. The same duties were performed at the Court of Vijayanagar, ruled by the Princes of the Narapati race under the title of Sovereign Lords of the Deccan, by the Chiefs and Rajas who held of them. Colonel Mackenzie's paper on the history of those kings, published in one of the volumes of the Annual Register, has the following passage : \" In this King's reign seve ral considerable Rajas used to attend him in the duties of the following offices, viz. the King of Camboja Desam presented him Avith the Calinji ; the Panda Raja held his bag of beetle-nut; the King of Ginjee carried his chouri; the Raja of Kerala district carried his water goglet ; the Raja of Anga Desam presented him beetle as his servant. The Raja of Mucha coun try's office Avas to dress him ; the Raja of Gool carried the umbrella; all the other offices were executed in like manner by persons of rank. All"], [69, "OR CUTTACK. 63 those on their first visit performed their respective duties to Ramaraja, when he Avas seated on his throne or Sinhasanam. To this day likewise, the feu datories or thakurs of the great Rajput principalities, as Jyepur, Joudpur, and Oudipur, are bound to attend the court of their prince for certain fixed periods in each year, there to do homage, and to perform such services aa the terms of their several tenures prescribe. The estate of the Chief Khetri, or Lord Paramount, comprized the fairest and most fertile portion ofthe monarchy of Orissa. In every part of India it would seem that, even under the Hindus, the domains reserved for the crown constituted, if not the largest, at least the most valuable and pro ductive share ofthe whole territory, and it Avas the uniform policy of the strong government ofthe Mohammedans, constantly to enlarge this share by the gradual subjugation and absorption of the possessions of the lesser chiefs and princes. As it is the above-mentioned estate or concern, with the management of which the Officers ofthe British government are chief ly occupied, and from which nearly all its revenues are derived, it iS of course of particular importance to enquire respecting the systemandthe rights aa -ie>itly prevailing and still existing, in the tract knownby the modern appellation ofthe Mogulbandi or Khaliseh. Whilst the Mogulbandi yields to the state a revenue of between twelve and thirteen lacs, in its real cha- racter of Proprietor, the Rajwara or division occupied by the feudal chiefs, pays a light tribute of only \"\"1, 20,000, the difference between that and the Retail net produce, which is at the lowest calculation in the ratio of one to ten, being enjoyed by the several Zemindars, in virtue of their proprietary rights. In the Khaliseh territory, obvious traces exist to this day of a subdivision. of lands into tracts held by Military retainers, and those of the common Mil0- izari ryots. Tenants ofthe former description are called at present Paiks, and lesser Khandaits, and the estates on which they are found are entered in the revenue accounts as \" Khurdiah Gerjats* but whatever 5 tit. small forts or fortified posts, with lands an. csed."], [70, "64 ON ORISSA PROPER may have been their number anciently, they are now too few and unimport ant to claim a particular notice. The ryoti land, paying a full rent to the sovereign, demands our principal attention. According to the uniform System of India generally, it ATas partitioned into numerous grams, town ships, .or. village. societies. The larger revenue allotments or circles of villages known to the Hindus of Orissa, were denominated Khand and JBisi or Bishe ; words meaning literally a portion or district. Each of these petty districts was under the management and controul of tAvo de scriptions of hereditary officers, vested with police and revenue functions, \\iz. the Khand Adipati and Bishuya or Bissoee, (words signifying chief of 'a division,) Who Avas the principal man; and the Bho'i Mfil of the Ka ran or writer cast, avIio had the more particular charge ofkeepingallthe ac counts and registers connected with the land. In parts ofthe Deccan, the same description of officers still exist, and are called the Des Mukh and Des Tandiah, terms of precisely corresponding import. They seem to have acted jointly in the discharge of some of their functions, and separately and in* dependently in regard to others. One perhaps had the more especial duty of administering the police, the other of collecting the revenue; whilst they both watched generally over the fiscal interests of the state, and acted as umpires and moderators of Punchaits, in investigating and adjusting disputes between inhabitants of different villages, or between the people of a village and their head man. Every respectable village had its chief ancjl accountant, called the Padhan and Bho'i \u2014 but frequently several of the smaller hamlets of Orissa were associated together under one set of offi- cers of this name ; much oftener the same individual performed both func- tions in a village ; and sometimes none of the kind existed, in which case the charge of the village affairs attached more immediately to the division officer. Where the Padhan and Bho'i both existed, they discharged res- pectively much the same duty in regard to theh individual village or vil lages, as the superior officers exercised in regard to their circle of villages. The Padhan looked after the police with the aid of the village watch man, who made his reports to a Sirdar or Sirdars called the Or Khan-"], [71, "<c- - OR CUTTACK. 65 dait* stationed with the Bisoi ; the Bho'i kept the village accounts and fur- iiished information to the Bho'i Mul or chief accountant. All these func- tionaries held their, situations hereditarily, and were in the habits of mortgaging or even selling the Avhole or shares of them, with the sanction :of the ruling power, just as we see the priests and officers in the temple of Jugunnath at this day disposing constantly of their several shewas or services, with the emoluments thereunto annexed. To infer from these circumstances '.any right of property in the soil, would seem equally rash and absurd. It isa ;nicer question whether under the old Hindu system the actual occupants of \"the soil, that is the ryots, were considered to possess any subordinate title of ownership in land. There are no obvious traces of such a right now remaining -in Cuttack, as we read of in Canara and Malabar. I have never yet been able to discover any well authenticated instance ofthe sale or morts-ag-e of land by a Malguzari ryot of the province. The thani or fixed cultivators, hoAvever undoubtedly possessed under the old Rajas the privilege of hereditary occupancy ; their fixed assessment Avas light and easy ; and there was then tio one to dispute the matter with them, excepting the despotic uncontroled sovereign of the country, who, whatever his claims in theory, of course required nothing from the land but an adequate revenue. The changes consequent on the subjection ofthe province to the Mogul government come next to be considered. It is well known that after the defeat of the Afghan usurpers who had gained temporary possession of Orissa,; by the armies of Acber under the command of his General Khan Jehan and others, the celebrated Dewan Tural Mall visited the province A. D. 1580 to superintend the introduction of his settlement of the crown lands,,1 founded on a measurement and valuation called the Taksim Jamma and Tankha Raqmi. The arrangements for the annexation of the Suba of Orissa to the empire, did not, however, receive their final completion until the arrival of Raja Man Sinh the Imperial Lieutenant, who assumed charge pf the government in 999 Amli, t That is, the Khandait of the cultivating as contradistinguished from the Military caste,\" \u25a0 J 3"], [72, "ON ORISSA PROPER 66 Under his administration the heads of the existing branches ofthe Royal family Avere acknowledged as Rajas ; they were invested with the rank and titles conferred by the Mogul Court on officers of distinction ; and extensive portions of country were assigned to them as hereditary fiefs in Zemindari tenure. No regular tribute appears to have been required from them on account of their OAvn lands, but the right of investiture was reserv ed to the ruling power, with the privilege of levying such contributions on the accession of a new Raja, as it might be thought expedient, according to the circumstances of the times, to demand. The reigning prince wap styled the Raja of Khfirda with the rank of a Commander of 3,500 \" Mun sahi Seh Hazar Panjsad,\" and his estate was eomposed ofthe jurisdiction called Killah Khfirda, with the Mehals Rahang, Limbai Pursottem Ches ter, &e. alienated from the Khaliseh. To the two sons of Telinga Mukund Deo (the last independent monarch), were assigned respectively A.ith the title of Raja and rank of five hundred, Sarangher, Pattia, Sailo, Saibir, &c. and Al with Derabissi, and Uthar. A certain number likewise of the great chiefs of Orissa (Zemindars and Sirdars, as they are called in the revenue accounts,) were placed under the orders and controul of each ofthe above Rajas, Avho collected the tribute before due from them, or then for the first time imposed. Zemindar * I may here observe, is the obvious translation \u00a9f the word Bhfinia, Bhyan, or Bhupati, the common title of the ancient feudatories of this province, Avhose offices now received a Persian name, as well as their jurisdictions, the Hindi word Gerh, being exchanged for Killah. The more distant Zemindars were separated from tbe control of the superior Raja, and placed under seven principal Zemindars or Sawants (not distinguished however by the title of Raja,) viz. tbe Zemindars of Keonjhar, Moherbenj, Bishenpur, Futtihabad, Naraingerh, Karrangher, and * Even the powerful Rajas of J oudpur, Bhartpur, &c. were called Zemindars by the Mogul go vernment down to the latest period, and we know from history the nature of their tenures. They were bound to attend in succession on the person of the Emperor at the head of a fixed quota of Troops.

The jurisdiction thus left to the Raja of Khurda, ex tended from the Mahanadi to the borders of Kimedy in Ganjam, compriz ing 129 Killahs, Gerhs, or hill estates, exclusive of these situated within his own Zemindari. The above number tallies exactly with that given in the Ayin Acberi, the author of which observes, \" In Cuttack are one hundred and twenty-nine brick forts (killahs,) subject to the command of Gajapati.\" The other two Rajas had under them altogether fifty-two Zemindaris and seventy-nine killah divisions ; and the seven Zemindars mentioned fifty-six ditto, containing one hundred and one killahs \u2014 all exclusive of their own estates, and the dependent killahs situated within them.

Whilst the ministers of Akber thus wisely left the turbulent feudal chiefs or Khetri Zemindars to the management of those who from their local rank and hereditary influence were best qualified to control them, they consider ed it expedient to adopt also with very little variation the system which they found existing for the administration of the affairs of the Kot , or as they called them the Khaliseh lands, that is the country- annexed to the Im jp.erial Dewanni. The only marked change which they introduced, indeed, J 2"], [80, "ON ORISSA PROPER 74 was that of translating all the uncouth and harsh sounding Uria designati ons \u00abf things and offices, into more familiar Persian terms of corresponding import. The Khands and Bissees now became Pergunnahs ; the Police and Re venue Officers, Chowdris* and Vilaity (Mofussil or Provincial) Canungos, or generally Talsikdars, the heads of villages Mokaddams ; and the villages themselves Mouzas. The larger territorial division of Sircar was perhaps arbitrary, suggested by considerations of financial convenience, or may have been copied from the Uria Dandpat. The term Mehal, or plural Me halat, by which the Revenue lands were designated in contradistinction to Killajat or the Military ditto, comprized in Akber's time, each, several Pergunnahs, and answered nearly to the modern Chakleh, though it is now applied to every petty estate or interest separately engaged for with the Collector. The Revenue Officers of the khaliseh lands, called Chowdris and Vi laity Canungos, or generally Talukdars, certainly acquired no new rights under the Mogul Government. We find them on all occasions acting with the Mokaddams as the fixed hereditary local Officers of the state, discharging some of tbeir functions in relation to their Pergunnahs jointly, others separately and independently,\u2014 exercising in short the same privi leges, and enjoying the same percentage and profits, under the new as under the old system of things. Amongst the chief of their duties were the collection of the Government Revenue assessed on their several divi sions, the Control of Police, the adjustment of disputes relating to the Pergunnah generally, and the enforcement of all the government orders and instructions relative to the assignment and appropriation of lands. Tbeir acknowledged profits were five per cent, on the collections, certain * The author of the Ajin Acberi says, speaking: ofthe Subeh of Bera, \u2014 \" In this country they call the Chowdri, Desmookhee : the Canungoe, Despondiah : the Mokaddam, Putayl and tl_e Putwaree, Kwi*"], [81, "OR CUTTACK. 75 perquisites on fishery, orchards, produce of the jungles, &c. (the Phalkar, Jalkar and Bankar;) taxes on Trade (Muteharfa;) the privilege of granting leases to new settlers in villages where there were no Mokaddams; and the less distinctly avowed, though not less profitable, perquisite of granting free of rent and selling, small portions of the lands called \" Banjar Kha rej Jamma,\" or waste unoccupied and unassessed land, which had either never been subject to rent, or had been deserted for years. The Mokad dams under them exercised privileges of a nearly corresponding nature and degree. They were often separated with their villages entirely from the control of the Talukdars, when their oppression had become intolerable, or they could purchase the favour of the ruling power. We find these persons constantly addressed jointly with the ryots and cultivators, in all the perwannehs and firmans both of the local and Supreme Governments, according to the well-known form, \" Let the Chowdris and Canungos, the Mokaddams, the ryots and cultivators of Pergunnah, so and so, sircar, so and so, know.\" If other evidence were wanting, the names and desig nations of their offices would clearly explain the light in which they were viewed by the Moguls^ Chowdri or Mokaddam signify simply chief or head \u2014 Vilaity Canungo, the local or provincial Officer of account. The Chow dri Talukdar has been always treated under the British Government as a proprietor of land, and the ambiguity of the designation of Chief prevents the error of such a view of his condition being apparent at first sight. The Canungo Talukdar has never been taken notice of in discussions regarding the land tenures of India. His denomination is so clearly indicative of a merely official tenure and occupation, that the most determined advocate of Zemindari rights would hardly perhaps maintain his claim to be called a Proprietor of the soil, though undoubtedly the title of both descriptions of Talukdars stands on precisely the same footing. To control and superin tend these local Officers ofthe old regime, and to maintain the principles of the new settlement inviolate, the offices of Sadder Canungo and Sadder Chowdri were instituted by Akber, or rather his Dewan Tooral Mall. The Sadder Chowdris, Canungos, and their establishments, should be carefully"], [82, "76 ON ORISSA PROPER distinguished from the \"Vilaity or local and country Chowdris and Canun gos, the Officers ofthe former Hindu Government. Whilst the latter were all Urias, the newly created Offices were invariably filled by natives of Ben gal. This circumstance of country and descent, has latterly been almost tbe only distinction between tlie two, as tbe four Sadder Canungos of Cut tack and many of their Gomashtebs contrived in process of time to obtain the management of a great number of Taluks, and became Talukdars, when their utility as checks and controllers must of course in a great measure have ceased. The situation of Sadder Chowdri bas long ago altogether disappeared. Down to the conquest of the Province by the British arms, the functions and situation of the Chowdri and Canungo Talukdars and tbe Mokad dams, remained precisely as 1 have above generally explained them. All Pergunnahs in the Marhatta accounts (with very few exceptions) are found entered as divided into the Taluks of Chowdris and Canungos named after the holder, Taluka Chowdri, Taluka Sudder Canungo, Taluka Canungo Vilaity, &c. and the separated or Mazkuri villages of such Mokaddams as had been entirely emancipated from their control, with certain alienated lands known by names and revenue terms which it is unnecessary here to mention. But on the introduction of the British Government and regulati ons, all parties whose names appeared in the public accounts of the preced ing administration as answerable for or intrusted with the collection of the public dues, were forthwith acknowledged not only as Zemindars, but as proprietors of the land comprized in their Zemindaris. Whatever may be thought ofthe policy of this admission and the advantages that have resulted from it, that it was founded on an erroneous view of the state of things un der the native Government seems to me to be beyond all cpiestion. How did this error, which seems to have been as generally prevalent everywhere else as in Cuttack, originate ? I think its origin and prevalence may be ascribed chiefly to three causes ; 1st. the want of a proper distinction being made between the rights and circumstances of the real ancient Zemindars"], [83, "OR CUTTACK. 77 of the country, and those officers called by the Moguls Talukdars or by whatever other name, who exercised hereditarily the management and col lection of the domains ofthe state ; 2nd. the confused and inaccurate appli cation of the term Zemindar by the natives of the country themselves, long before the accession of the British Government, which was probably a prin cipal cause ofthe want of discrimination above noticed ; 3rd. the failure to distinguish between the inheritance and sale of an office (a practice probably peculiar to the Hindus) and the inheritance and sale of the land with which that office was connected and concerned. On the real and essential difference existing between the two classes in Orissa, properly called Zemindar and Talukdar, I have already said enough. The former were the feudal Chiefs or Barons of the land, holding their estates by a title of property, and accountable to their sovereign only for the performance of such services, military or otherwise, as the condition of their tenure imposed. The latter were the hereditary Officers of Re venue and Police, on the widely extended domains of the superior Raja himself. With regard to the second source of error which is indeed intimately connected with the first, I would observe that we may trace four different senses in which the term Zemindar has been at different and successive periods used and understood in this country. In the days of Akber and his successors down to some period of A urangzeb's reign, it was confined strictly to the old feudal Lords and Chiefs such as I have before described, who were the ancient original Bhiiyans, Bhupatis, or Zemindars. 2nd. At different periods of the Mogul and Mahratta government, Zemindaris were occasionally created in imitation of the Hindu practice, either by separating off a number of villages from adjoining Pergunnahs, or by allotting one or more Pergunnahs ofthe khaliseh land, as fixed assignments, to somedistin guished Chief or able Revenue Officer, Musselman or Hindu, to answer a particular purpose. These creations were apparently common in Bengal, and"], [84, "ON ORISSA PROPER 78 no doubt have contributed greatly to puzzle and entangle the question of Zemindari rights as relating to that province.* There are about five or six instances of the kind in Cuttack subsequent to Raja Man Sinh's time, of which the Zemindari composed of Pergunnah Kurdes, Antrudh, and Kal juri, created as late as 1780-90, A. D. is the most remarkable case. The new tenure thus created would be naturally of rather a mixed and ambi guous nature. It was obviously by no means the policy or general prac tice of the Mogul Government to raise up an hereditary nobility, though they might occasionally adopt proceedings leading to that result, to an swer some special end. If we look to the proper original import ofthe word Zemindar, the tenure in question would have some claims to be con sidered as involving a right of property in the soil ; but if we try the nature of the grant by the contents of the sunnud or deed itself which conferred it, we must unhesitatingly class the Zemindari so created, as nothing higher than a Talukdari, or a mere official trust, of the description called Jhtimam. Instead of military service which the policy of the Musselman government did not require, the khidmat or service enjoined in the Ze mindari sunnuds to which I refer, is that of keeping up a good police and paying a certain fixed revenue. The remuneration to be enjoyed in return is always distinctly indicated, viz. the Nancar, Rassum and Lowazimeh, or percentage and perquisites. The old Talukdars, where Pergunnahs were thus granted, continued sometimes to exist in a dependent capacity ; sometimes were altogether ousted or bought out. 3rd. In latter times as the vigour and regularity of the old system became relaxed, the Chowdri and Canungo Talsikdars came to be known as the Zemindars of their Pergun nahs generally. Their Tal6ks were not, to be sure,, entered in the public accounts as Zemindaris, nor would any single Talukdar call himself a Ze mindar, but they assumed conjointly the distinction of Pergunnah Zemin dars and were so termed often by the ruling power. It is curious and not unimportant to remark that whilst the Talukdars became thus exalted to * They may be in general distinguished hy their Musselman appellations as Rajshahi, Mahm&d \u00a7hahi,. Fattihabad, Fattehpur, &c,"], [85, "OR CUTTACK. 79 the rank of Zemindar, the proper Zemindars mounted a step higher and styled themselves Rajas. Before even the British accession, and certainly ever since that period, every hill and jungle Zemindar of Orissa has been pleased invariably to adopt the style and title of Raja. At the great Man Sinh's settlement we find three Zemindars only acknowledged as such, viz. the three Princes of the Royal family. All the other feudal Chiefs were classed in the rank of Khandaits, Sirdars, and Zemindars. The fourth and last mode of applying the title of Zemindar is as under tbe British govern- ment, when every class and description of persons engaging in chief with the Collector for payment of revenue, obtains, on all occasions, the dignity and benefit resulting from that appellation. We may distinguish no less than seven different grades of persons holding offices and tenures connected with land, who appear in the Collector's accounts as Zemindars, and abso- lute proprietors ofthe soil : 1st, The ancient Zemindars (now Rajas) ofthe killah estates. 2nd. Zemindars of Mogul and Marhatta creation, holding one or more Pergunnahs, as Curdes, Utikan, Shahabad, &c. 3rd. The Chow- dri and Canungo Talukdars. 4th. The independent (Mazk sin) Mokaddams. 5th. Village accountants, called Serberakars, and Karjis who sometimes managed their villages and paid the rents to the Marhatta government. 6th. The head-men (Pursettis) of patnahs, or villages containing merely houses with little or no arable land attached. 7th. The holders and proprietors of petty alienated portions of land called Kheridah, resumed jagirs, service lands (Mouajib), &c. &c. It is of some importance to my argument to consider how far the testi mony, either direct or incidental, of the best writers of the country, supports the view which I have taken of the original essential difference between the Mogul Zemindars, and the great Revenue Officers called Chowdris and Canungos, or more generally Talfikdars ; and of the confusion created in latter times, by the inaccurate and indiscriminate application of the for mer terra. K"], [86, "80 ON ORISSA PROPER On the only occasions when the author of the Ayin Acberi mentions Ze-* ii-indars, the word is used entirely in the sense I contend for, that is, as designating the class of Military Chiefs and feudatories, bound by their tenure to furnish troops, &c. for the service ofthe state. He mentions se veral Rajput Zemindars (sometimes expressly under that denomination, sometimes as Bhumis) commanding bodies of Troops in Berar, in the account of which Subeh also, he observes, that the Chowdri is here called Desmukh, Canungo, Despandia, &c. but does not explain the nature of the duties- of those officers. In treating of the Subeh of Bengal likewise, he states, after recounting the amount ofthe revenue, \" And the Zemindars (wrho are most ly Koits)* furnish also 23,330 . cavalry, 8,01,158 infantry,, 1,70 elephants, 4260 cannon, and 4400 boats.\" In a passage which occurs in part 3rd, des cribing the duties of the Foujdar, the word Zemindar has been erroneously used by the translator Mr. Glad.win. The original runs- thus,. \" When a Bu zerger, (husbandman or ryot,) or an Amil Guzar of the Khaliseh, or a Jagir dar, may prove refractory, he shall endeavour first to bring him back to his duty by fair words ;\" which the translator renders, \" Whenever a Zemindar or a Collector of the RoyaLor Jagir land,\" If the Royal domains, or Khaliseh lauds, were really held, under the Mo gul government, by a number of large proprietors, whether called Zemindar, or by whatever other name, it seems scarcely conceivable, that all mention of, and allusion to, such a class, should have been omitted in the chapter of the Ayin Acberi, (viz. part 3,) which treats expressly of the famous ten year's settlement of the imperial lands, and the arrangements and system of ma nagement therewith connected. No one can peruse that chapter without *The remark that the Bengal Zemindars are most-} Koits or Cayasthas, who are ofthe Sankarva- Tan, or mixed impure breed, inferior even to Sudras, may seem partly at variance with what I have ad vanced, but it should be recollected, that, as I have already stated, the genuine Cshatriyas are consi dered to be extinct, in many parts of the country, and that these who now represent and stand in the place of the regal and military class, are often of very inferior extraction. It will be seen, on reference to the lists of Kings in the work now referred to, that, out of five dynasties of sovereign Princes who ruled over Gaura Desa or Bengal, prior to the Mohammedan conquest, the first only were \"Khetris ; the four last Koits."], [87, "OR CUTTACK. 81 being struck by the fact, that the entire business of settlement and collecti on, is described as lying between the husbandman and tbe officers ofthe go vernment, called the Amil, Tepakchi, and Treasurer, conducted through the intervention of certain local functionaries, who are styled the Shikdar, Kar kun, Mokaddam, and Patwari. It would be superfluous to quote particular passages, in illustration of what is so abundantly clear, from the whole tenor ofthe portiou of the w7ork alluded to. It cannot surely be imagined, that, if a class of so much importance as Zemindars and Proprietors had then ex isted in the Khaliseh land, no reference should ever once be made to their existence and interests, in speaking of the payments of the Ryots to the Officers of Government ; tbe settlements to be made with them ; the mea surements ofthe land ; the accounts ofthe same to be kept, and the parties by' whom, those accounts were to be signed and countersigned. By the Shikdar* and Karkun, in this place, are meant, I apprehend, tlie Chowdri and Canungo Talukdars, like those of Orissa, or persons performing similar functions. Shikdar implies very nearly the same as Talukdar, the one de signation signifying literally, holder or manager of a division ; the other, holder of an allotment or dependency. The Chowdri, is, twice only, that I can discover, mentioned by that appellation express, throughout the Ayin Acberi ; first, in the account ofthe Subeh of Berar, and second, in the part about Syerghal, which is defined to mean either money, pensions, or land bestowed as milk and madadmash. The passage is this, \" Various illicit practices having been discovered, the Syerghal of the Afghans and Chow dris of the Khaliseh, were annexed to the Exchequer.\" The same indirect and incidental evidence may be drawn from Perish^ teh, whose history extends down to the death of Acber in A. D. J 605. In the cases where he mentions Zemindars, it is almost invariably as, Zemiuda ran o Rayyan Deccan, Zemindars and Princes of tlie Deccan ; Zemindaran * In Bengal, Shikdar has become an hereditary title or appellation like Chowdri, Bakshee, M^j tnuadar, Sec. K2"], [88, "ON ORISSA PROPER 82 Kohestan, of the hills, &c. and they are represented as powerful chiefs possessing forts, armies, and political influence, such as to this day are tbe attributes of Khetri and Rajput Chiefs. It is curious enough, that, in near ly every instance where his translator Dow has introduced the word Ze mindar, and more especially in those few interesting passages of Ferishteh, which touch upon the internal arrangements and institutions ofthe empire, the term bas been gratuitously foisted in, and is not to be found in theori. ginal. As a guide to future enquirers, I shall point out some of these errors which have attracted my notice. Dow states of Sultan Balin, ** Wherever the King inarched, there was an order for the Sfibehs, Zemindars, Fouj dars, &c. to meet him.\" This is, merely the translator's explanation of the sense of the passage. The original is, \u2022' Sultan Balin made it a rule, that, whenever he returned from his army, the head-officers and respectable men, came to meet him and offer presents.\" When the same Prince goes to Sunargaon, in pursuit of the rebel Togral, Dow makes the Zemindar of that place join him with his troops ; the original says only, \" Dhoj Rai the Zabit or local governor.\" In the accounts of the reigns of Feroze 2nd and Alla-ud-deen, the word Amra, used by Ferishteh, is twice erroneously translated Zemindar. In the description of the latter reign, a still more important inaccuracy occurs, in the account of the King's mea sures, for improving both the condition of his ryots, and the revenues of the Royal Exchequer. Zemindars aud farmers are not once mentioned by Ferishteh, but it is observed, that, as the Chowdris and Mokaddams were very oppressive in their behaviour towards the ryots (zeberdest), they were set aside, and their dues (ivajeh) resumed, so that they who had be fore worn fine clothes, rode on horses and affected all the state of Amras were now reduced to the lowest ebb of poverty. In the history of Moham med Third's reign, the term Zemindar is again gratuitously introduced hy Dow, as follows, \" Nizam Bam, a Zemindar, possessed of some lands in Oude, collected a mob of the discontented farmers and rebelled.\" The original text, which is obscure in my copy, calls him an Amir of some kind but never once makes use of tlie word Zemindar, Again, in pages 51 and"], [89, "OR CUTTACK. 83 52, (vol. ii.) during Feroze Third's reign, Zemindars of Gorukpore and Kut ter are mentioned by Dow, where Ferishteh distinctly calls them Mokaddams. Zemindars as well as Mokaddams of Atava, are, it is true, in one part spo ken of by the Persian historian, but he elsewhere also alludes to Rais and Rajas of the same district. On the deposition of Abu Bekker, the translator observes, that the Zemindars, in various, parts of the empire, fell upon hia followers and massacred them. The original says, \" the ryots and others murdered them.\" Whilst the designation so often repeated, has been thus constantly introduced intoDow's translation, in a manner quite unwarranted either by the sense or language ofthe text, it is strangely omitted, sometimes, in parts where it does occur in the original. Thus, Ferishteh, speaking of the warlike operations ofthe Emperor Mohammed Third, and the vigour of his government during the early part of his reign, says, \" He conquered the en tire Carnatic, from sea to sea, taking possession of part ofthe country and obliging the Rajas of the other portion to pay tribute, and, from dread of his prowess, the Rais and Zemindars throughout the empire became submis sive and obedient, and waited on the court to discharge their several duties and offices.\" Dow renders tbe passage simply as follows, \" He soon after reduced the Carnatic, to the extremities of the Deccan, and from sea to sea, obliging all the Rajas to pay him tribute, by which means he again fill ed the treasury with money.\" The last of Col. Dow 's mistakes, which I shall notice, is one that has led the ingenious author of the essay on Asiatic Mo narchies, to imagine a support to one (though not a material) part of his argument, which does not in reality exist. The translator says of the fa mous Ferid, alias Sher Shah, \"When he arrived at his Jagir (in the Subeh of Jonpur,) he actually put his resolution in practice, by rendering justice to the poor, and reducing to order such ofthe Zemindars as opposed his au thority ;\" now the original states simply, \"The Mokaddams of several vil lages being turbulent and refractory, he undertook to reduce them to order.\" The word Zemindar never once occurs any where in or near the passage. The only inference which I would draw from the above, is, that, in those"], [90, "ON ORISSA PROPER 84 times of the Mogul government, when the financial system of the empire existed in full vigour, the misapplication ofthe term Zemindar to the Chow dris and Canungos of the Khaliseh lands, or to any inferior class, had not become general in Hindustan. That the designations, and, perhaps too, the offices and rights ofthe two classes, were in latter times much con founded together, is abundantly clear. It cannot, of course, be expected, when we consider the vague, mutilated, and imperfect state of all Indian histories and revenue accounts, that the origin and progress of this confu sion should admit of being explained with such precision as to remove all doubt, or difference of opinion. The first symptoms of it are perhaps to be observed during Aurangzeb's reign.* After his death, and especially from the time of Mohammed Shah, and the early period of the eighteenth century, we meet with frequent instances, in Finnans and Perwannehs, of the word Zemindar being either added after Chowdri and Canungo, or substituted in lieu of those terms. In proof of this statement, I need only refer generally, to the numerous documents ofthe kind which are yet forth coming, and may be consulted by those who feel interested in the discussi on. It will be observed, that they always purport to address, and convey orders to, the whole body of persons connected, in any way, with the land in a Pergunnah or Chakleh, belonging to the Khaliseh Sher if eh \u2014 the Amil\u00ab, Mutasaddis, Chowdris, Canungos, Mokaddams, ryots, and cultivators. lt is superfluous to add, after what has been above stated, that the proper * The famous grant ofthe Zemindaris &c. ofthe 24-Pergunnahs to the Company by Jaffer Ali Khan in 1764 A. D. furnishes an apt and curious illustration of the extraordinary confusion w'lich prevailed latterly, in regard to the designation of the head classes of middle-men connected with the land. I, shall therefore give a translation of it from the original, on the records of the Persian Office, '\u2022 Let the Zerfiindars, Chowdris, Canungos, Talukdars, Mikaddatns, Ryots and Inhabitants oftUe Chakleh of Hooglev, &c iu Bengal, know, that since the office (or service) of the Zemindari, and Chowdralii and Talukdaii as below, has been assigned to the English Company, they must be allowed 'o enter upon the frill exercise aud enjoyment of all the duties and privileges of the same, and the Ryois with.ii the limits of their Zemindari must experience no annoyance.

I must not omit to notice the famous Firman of the Emperor Aurangzeb Alemgir, addressed to Rashik Das, which has been translated and printed with former discus sions regarding the Zemindari tenure. In this the \" Amils, Chow7dris, Ca nungos, Mokaddams, and Patwaris,\" are frequently mentioned in every part and, in owe instance, the expression is varied by writing \" Amins, Amils, Ze mindars and others.\" If the date and translation ofthe document are strict ly correct, it may be considered to evince an earlier application of the term Zemindar, to the officers of the Khaliseh land, than I should be on other grounds disposed to admit. The second cause of error, respecting Zemindari and Tai fikdari rights, which has occurred to me, is the failure to discriminate between the sale of lands and of the offices connected with them. In Cuttack, the offices of Talukdar and Mokaddam, were, in conformity with the universal Hindu practice, strictly hereditary ; the rent or revenue of the lands payable to the state had been fixed and settled with reference to the capability ofthe soil, and the established rules for the division ofthe crop ; and certain perqui sites and emoluments were allotted to all parties concerned in the busi ness of collection and management, which (together with illicit gains) ren dered those situations, though less valuable than at present, still objects of solicitude and ambition to the class who alone were likely to hold them, under the native administration. Such being the case, it was a frequent practice of the Mogul government, to oblige the Talsikdars or Mazkuri Mokaddams, when they had embezzled the revenues, or otherwise fallen into arrears, to dispose of a portion of what they held, when the price obtained was invariably paid into the local treasury in discharge of balances. The custom may be considered to indicate a recognition of property, on the part"], [92, "ON ORISSA PROPER 86 of those classes of functionaries in their offices, (though the sales in ques tion, termed Bye Sultani, in general bore little the character of voluntary and unconstrained transfers,) but certainly cannot be held to establish any title of property in the soil itself. In most cases, the thing sold is carefully defined to be the whole or a share of the Talukdari and Chowdrahi, of the Talukdari and Wilaity Canungoship, or ofthe Mokaddami of a Taluk or village. Occasionally there is some ambiguity, where a single village only is disposed of, but I am persuaded that no person could rise from the perusal of a number of such deeds of sale of the old times, without being satisfied, that they transfer nothing more than a hereditary official tenure in a village or villages, or portion of a Taluk, the profits attaching to which are defined in the margin or endorsement, as well as the fixed revenue as sessed, called the Tankhah Raqmi and Jamma Kemal. I observe, that, in the very first of the cases brought forward in the appendix to Sir J. Shore's Minute, on tbe permanent settlement, as an instance ofthe sale oi lands in Bengal, the thing disposed of is distinctly stated to be, two-sixteenths of the Chowdrahi* of Kismat Pergunnah Fattehjanjpur, sold by Kamal Chowdri to Hari Sircar. In like manner, I apprehend that the sense of the wrords Malik ant. Milkiat, which occur generally in the Cuttack deeds of sale, as in those of a similar nature in Bengal and elsewhere, must, in any consistent and intelligible view of the case, be held to apply only to the office and per quisites of the seller, implying that he enjoyed them hereditarily, by a tenure independent of the will of any local superior, in contradistinction to an office held by a mere Gomashteh, or ephemeral agent at the pleasure cf another. Indeed, the Milkiat, or right of property asserted, is most com monly and distinctly stated to refer to the Chowdrahi, f Canungoi, and Mokaddammi. If such were not the case, it would follow that the same * Situation of Chowdri. t Or Anglice Chowdriship, Canungoship, and office of Mokaddas. \u00bb"], [93, "OR CUTTACK. 87 land might have two different kinds of absolute proprietors, for Mokad dams, who had the right of selling their Mokaddammi, existed (in Cuttack at least) on the Taluk of every Chowdri and Canungo, who might similarly dispose of his Talukdari or apart of it. Tbe difficulty vanishes when we view them, as, what they unquestionably were, offices connected with the land, of different degrees of authority and importance, each having its distinct duties and perquisites. In the Southern Pergunnahs, formerly under the Khurda Rajas, where the heads of villages and accountants retain their old Hindi appellation of Padhan and Bho'i, we find them constantly selling shares of their Padhanee and Bhoi Giri, or offices of chief and accountant, with a proportionate allotment of the service lands and Rassum attached ; and these transfers, the real nature of which it is impossible to mistake, serve to throw a strong light on the character of similar transactions in other parts, where the use of terms of doubtful import, bas invested the subject with a degree of ambiguity which probably will never be altogether dispelled. Actual sales of land, or rather ground, were not however unknown un der the native administration of Cuttack, and wherever it was clearly in tended to sell such,- so many bigas are plainly stated in the Qobalehs to be the subject of transfer, without any periphrasis as to the Zemindari, Ta lukdari, or Mokaddammi right in them. Such sales however were confined to a particular description of land called Arazi Banjar Kharij Jamma, or ground, waste, unoccupied, and unassessed, in the disposal of which the Talfikdars and Mokaddams were allowed by prescription to exercise con siderable privileges. If only two or three bigas were sold for the building of a house, patna, &c. or disposed of as rent free, the individual Talukdar or Mokaddam executed the deed, with tbe sanction of the ruling power, implied by tbe necessary attestation of the Sadder Canungo, or his agent : if a larger quantity as a batti, or so, was to be assigned away, the deed of transfer was executed jointly by the Chowdris, Canungos, and Mokaddam, or Mokaddams. This mode of transfer gave rise to a curious tenure in the L"], [94, "88 ON ORISSA PROPER district of Cuttack, called Kharideh or purchased, and Milk Kbaridah, which often comprized much valuable land, owing to good land being frau dulently alienated, instead of the Banjar which the deeds set forth, and they formed a constant subject or scrutiny and resumption on the part of the Officers of the native government. The purchasers of such property often again transferred it to others, and the privilege of sale likewise seems to have been conceded to those who enjoyed rent free lands, under grants ofthe government as, milk, ayma and madadmasli. A full discussion and investigation of these matters would however lead so far, that I am obliged to content myself with the above general reference to the principal consi- derations which strike me, as necessary to explain the land tenure in Orissa Proper.

THE learned Natives of Cuttack maintain, that, in latter ages, upon the i decline of that great monarchy of upper India, whose history seems des tined to remain for ever buried in the darkness of fable and uncertain tra dition, four principal thrones or races of Hindoo Princes ruled over the country, viz. the Narapati, the Aswapati, the Chatter or Chatrapati, and the Gajapati. By the first they understand the Ram Rajas or Sovereigns of Teligana and the Carnatic, who opposed the earlier Mussehnan invaders of the Deccan, under Sultan Ala-ud-din ; the second throne they place in the Marhatta country, and intend to designate by the epithet, no doubt, the old and powerful Rajas of Deogir or Tagara, of whom frequent men tion is made in Ferishteh ; by the third* they mean apparently the cele brated line of Rajput Princes whose descendants are found at Ambher and Jyepur ; the fourth is the title given to the Monarchs who ruled over Orissa, from the earliest times of which any authentic records are preserv ed. The origin of these thrones or sovereignties, they trace back to the four great feudal vassals of an empire, which they firmly believe to have extended over the whole of Hindustan, from the commencement at least of the Caii yuga ; and they explain their titles by reference to the no minal offices held, or services performed by them, when in attendance on the Lord Paramount or supreme Raja at the Court of Hastina (Hastiua pura) and Delhi. Thus the Narapatif is supposed by some to have been the commander of the armies : the Aswapati, the lord or master of the horse ; the Chatrapati, the bearer of the imperial umbrella or standard of * 1 should myself be inclined to place the Chatrapati Rajas in the Marhatta country, as Sri Cha trapati was one of the titles adopted by the Peshwahs, and it seems reasonable to suppose that they may have borrowed it from an ancient local dynasty so designated. t The titles i.iply respecuvely, \"Lord of Men ;\" \"Lord of horses;\" \" Lord ofthe Umbrella,\" and \" Lord of Elephants,\" or as we should say, \" Master of, &c.\""], [99, "OR CUTTACK. 93 state ; and the Gajapati, the master of elephants. Others have it that the epithets were derived from the designations of ihe four gates ofthe palace, at which the chiefs in question took their stations, when present at the capital. The recollections preserved of these races of Princes are by no means confined to Orissa. In the Canara Raja Padhati translated by Dr. Bucha nan, the fabulous monarchs are first described as usual beginning with Yu dhisht'hira, and the author then states, \"After this Narapati, Gajapati, and Aswapati, three thrones were established.\" He then details the Princes of the Narapati line, who ruled over that portion of the Deccan. They are now probably forgotten in upper India, but seem to have been perfectly well known and familiarly spoken of, even at Delhi, only two centuries ago. There is a highly curious passage in the Ayin Acberi, where treating of the game of cards with which the Emperor Acber recreated his royal mind, the writer observes, \"This is a well-known game. At first the pack consisted of twelve kings with eleven cards dependent upon each in the following order. First, Aswaput, the king ofthe horses. He is painted on horse back like the king of Delhi, with the Chutter, Alum, and other ensigns of royalty. Second, Gujput, the king of elephants, is mounted on an ele phant like the king of Orissa. Third, Nurput, the king of men. Like the king of Vijayapur, (Quere, Vijayanagara?) he is seated on athrone and has different kinds of soldiers attending him on foot,\" &c. &c. It is of the fourth and probably least important race of Hindu monarchs of the middle ages, the Gajapatis* of Orissa, that I propose to offer an ac count in this part of my paper ; but to render the chapter complete, I shall add a sketch of the history of the province down to the date of the British conquest, A. D. 1803. The earlier native histories of the country are of the legendary or fabulous * Derived from Ga ja, an elephant, and pati (pot ens,) a master or potentate."], [100, "94 ON ORISSA PROPER class, copied from the Puranas, but embellished or disfigured by a plenti ful admixture of local traditions. Their later annals assume an air of authen ticity about the date of the accession ofthe family called the Kesari Vansa, 473 A.D. prior to which the accounts are so replete with obvious false hoods, contradiction, inconsistency, and anachronism, as to be equally un intelligible and unworthy of notice. The memory of a few great names and events, only, has been preserved up to tbe fourth and fifth centuries of the Christian \u00e6ra, and to adapt these to their favorite system of chronolo gy, the brahmins, who will never admit want of information on any subject, have been obliged to give an expansion to the reigns of their traditionary Rajas, in some cases of five or six hundred years, and in all, far beyond the natural or possible term of the human life.* As, however, it will not be uninteresting to those curious in researches into Hindu antiquity, to learn what traditions the natives of this district have preserved regarding their history in the earlier ages, I shall begin my sketch of the contents of their annals from the remotest period to which they profess to go back. The sources from wdiich my information has been chiefly derived are, 1st. A work in Sanscrit called the Vansavali, belonging to a learned brahmin of Puri, said to have been originally composed by some of his ancestors three or four centuries back, and continued down in the family to the pre sent date. 2d The chapter of the Mandala Panji or Records preserved in the temple of Jagannath, called the Raj Charitra or \" Annals of the * Mr. Mill's observation on Hindu history does not hold good with regard to Orissa ; \" Whilst we receive accounts, the most precise and confident regarding the times of remote antiquity, not a name of a prince in after ages is presented in Hindu records. A great prince, named Vicramaditya, is said to have extended widely his conquests and dominion and to have reigned at Magud'ha 396 years after Chandrabija. From that time even fiction is silent. We hear no more ofthe Hindus and their transactions till the era of Mohammedan conquest; when the Persians alone become our instruc tors.\" The writings called classical indeed conduct us no further than the period indicated in the above passage, but the detail which I propose to give will show (whatever may be thought of the va lue or authenticitj of my materials) that the Hindus of this province do possess accounls, which carry an appearance of truth, and which they themselves believe, of their more modem kings and their actions."], [101, "OR CUTTACK. 95 Kings\" in the Uria language, which records are stated to have been com menced upon more than six centuries back, and to have been since regularly kept up. 3d. Another Vansavali or Genealogy written in Sanscrit on leaves of the Palmyra tree, procured from a brahmin living in the family ofthe Raja of Puttia Sarengerb, one ofthe branches ofthe royal house of Orissa. Less certain and trust-worthy guides than tbe above, are to be met with in the numerous Genealogies, or Bansabali Pothis, as they are vulgarly term ed, possessed by nearly every Panjia or Almanac maker in the province. They in general abound with errors and inconsistencies, but occasionally a few facts or illustrations may be gleaned from them. Conformably with the notion, above stated, of the existence of a great empire at Delhi, to which all other Rajas stood in a vassal and feuda- tory relation, the annals of Orissa commence with the death of Krishna, the opening of the Caii yuga or evil age, 300J B. C. and the reigns of Jo- jishtee Deo, or Yudhisht'hira, Parikshita and Janamejaya. Twelve years after the setting in of the Caii yuga, in the month of Cheyte, when the moon was in the lunar mansion or Nakshatra called Purv Asdrh, at the moment of the rising of the seven Rishis, or constellation, called the Great Bear, Parikshita the son of Abhimanyu and grandson of Arjun, is said to have ascended the imperial throne of India. He reigned 757 years, and his son Janamejaya 512 years. There is an ancient temple at Agrahat in killah D&ljura about eight miles north of the town of Cuttack, which the brahmins of the place say was visited by this Raja Janamejaya during his progress over India, with all the feudatory Rajas of the country in his train ; and they point out the spot where he performed the sacrifice for the destruction of serpents, to revenge the death of his father. The circumstance merits notice from its tallying with a somewhat similar tra dition, recorded in an inscription at Bednore, communicated to the Asia- tic Society by the late Colonel Mackenzie, (vide Researches, vol. ix.) and what is further curious connected with the place, is, that the ground Al"], [102, "96 ON ORISSA PROPER around is strewed with numerous small stone pillars, shaped like temples in miniature about three feet long, exactly resembling those found in Khurda at an acknowledged seat of Jain worship, which the brahmins of Agrahat say amounted formerly to several hundreds, and were set up by Raja Jana mejaya to commemorate the great sacrifice there performed ; or according to other accounts, to stand as substitutes for those Rajas or Vassal Lords of India, who were not in attendance at the ceremony. After these celebrated heroes of Indian antiquity, we have a list of other Princes, whose names I have no where else met, viz. eight Rajas who reign for the moderate space of 1636 years. Many of them are obviously merely Rajas of the province, but in relating the succession of reigns, no dis tinction is drawn between those personages who were local or dependant princes, and those whom it is intended to represent as the monarchs of a large part of India. Goutama Deo, the second in succession from Jana mejaya is said to have added the country from the Mahendra Mali hills in Ganjam, as far as the Godaveri, to his dominions. Mahendra Deo, his son, founds Raj Mahendri or Rajamundry. Shewak Deo, a very religious Prince is assiduous in his devotion at the temple of Jagannath. In the reign of Bajranath Deo, the Yavanas are said to invade the country in great numbers from Babul Des, explained to mean Iran and Cabul, but they are finally driven back. Then follows an incomprehensible story, involving some strange anachronism, about Imarut or Himarut khan, who comes from Delhi with a large army and fights the Raja. His successor, Sarsankh Deo, a warlike prince, is attacked by another Khan, whose name is variously written, and always so incorrectly spelt, that it is impossible to unravel it. The Raja defeats the invader and emboldened by bis success, advances upon Delhi, and reduces a great part of the country. In the reign of Hans or Hangsha Deo, the Yavanas again invade the country in great force from Cashmir, and many bloody battles ensue. Respecting these Yavanas, who are.so often mentioned in the legendary"], [103, "OR CUTTACK. 97 portion of Orissan history, I should observe that the word in all the orio-inal Uria accounts is written Jaban, and the natives whom I have employed to translate both these and the Sanscrit Vansavalis, always render it Mogul. Who they really were, if they ever entered the country at all, may be plau sibly guessed in some instances from their being said to come from Babul Des and Cashmir, by which the Hindus understand generally Persia, Aff ghanistan, and part of Tartary. Nothing however can exceed the loose ness and confusion of my authorities, in speaking of countries and nations beyond their own immediate frontier. They often bring the Yavanas* from Delhi, by which appellation they seem to point to some great monarchy or monarchies lying to the northward and westward, of which they have pre served an indistinct notion, rather than to the particular city so named. Dr. Buchanan has remarked a similar degree of confusion on this same point in the historical recollections ofthe brahmins of the southern countries of In dia. He observes, vol. iii. page 113, chapter xv. \"Who were these Yava nas ? The word properly signifies an European, but as the Hindus speak with great confusion concerning the northern and western nations, it is often confounded with the Mlechchas and Turks, Arabs or Tartars, and all these terms are frequently applied to the Mussulman.\" Next in the series of kings, comes Raja Bhoja, who is made to reign 127 years, that is from about B, C. 180 to B. C. 53. He was, according to the Orissan Chronicles, a brave, liberal, j ust and merciful prince. He conquered the whole of India and took tribute from all the Rajas of it. His Court was adorned by the presence of 750 eminent poets, the chief of whom was Gali dasa, author of the 752 Ashloks called the Cbanak or Chataka, and Maha Wataka. Raja Bhoja invented boats, the weavers' loom, and wheeled car riages, or at least in his time the use of them first became common. In this reign the Yavanas from Sindhu Des invaded the country in great force \u2022 The section before quoted from the 10th chapter ofthe Institutes of Menu, distinctly classes Yavanas as one of the degraded races of Cshatriyas or Hindus, M2"], [104, "98 ON ORISSA PROPER but Bhoja discomfited and destroyed them, and afterwards captured many of their possessions and cities. Sri Bickerinajit or Vicramaditya, (whom some call brother, and others son of Bhoj Raja, whilst other accounts state no connection,) succeeded to the throne and reigned 135 years. He was master of all sciences and a great magician. Having subjected the Ashta Vetala or eight demons to* his control, he could perform many miraculous feats, such as travelling one hundred jojuns or 400 cos per day, extinguishing fire, and stopping the\" current of water by the force of his incantations. So great was the fame of his wisdom, that he was on one occasion taken up to the heaven of Indra ta settle a fierce dispute which had arisen amongst the Deotas respecting the relative merits of two of the heavenly Choristers, named Rembba and Ur-* Vasi. His decision in the important matter submitted to his arbitration, ob-< tained great applause, and the gods dismissed him with a present of the famous magic throne called the Sinhasana. On returning to the \" Martya loka,\" or region of mortals, much edified by what he had seen above, he bev came sole and undisputed Maha Raja ofthe whole face ofthe earth, and re ceived the title of Raja Adhiraj or Supreme Raja of Rajas. Through fear> of his power, the Yavanas all left the country. At last came Salivahana from the Deccan, who attacked and conquered Vicramaditya, put him to death, and assumed the reins of empire. From that period the \u00e6ra called the Sacabda prevailed, and was introduced into all the Panjis. I cannot pass over the above most important event in Indian history; marked by the introduction of a new epoch into all the southern countries, without specifying precisely how my different authorities express them selves regarding it, though unfortunately they throw no new light on the question of who this mysterious personage Salivahana really was? and whence he came? The extract from the Mandala Panji says, \"After ma \" ny years Saca Deo Brahma Raja of Pratishthanapura came with a large \"army, attacked the Maha Raja Vicramaditya, and having conquered"], [105, "OR CUTTACK. 99 \" and destroyed hira, fixed the seat of his empire at Delhi.\" The author of the Vansavali states, \"With the assistance (or at the instigation) of the \"Yavanas, a person named Nri Nikas Salivahana Saca Hara* fought many \" battles with the Raja, and deposed him from the throne of Delhi. From \" that period begins the \u00e6ra called the Sacabda.\" It will be curious, and not altogether unprofitable, to compare these rela- tions with a passage in Major Wilford's distinguished Essay on Vicrama- ditya and Salivahana. He says, page 123, \" In the seventh section ofthe \" Vrihat-catha, we read, that there was a king of Pataliputrapura, called \"Vicramaditya, who hearing ofthe growing power of Nrisinha, king ofthe \" consecrated city or Pratishtdna called to his assistance the Gajapati,f \"(lord of the Elephants or king of Thibet,) and tbe Aswapati, (lord of \" Horses or Horsemen, or the king of Persia.) The confederates took the \" field but were defeated by Nrisinha Nripa or Salivahana with an incredi *' ble slaughter. Vicramaditya fled with the utmost precipitation,\" &c. In another part it is observed that Vicramaditya \" obliged Cataca (Cattaca) to submit ;\" probably brought it into a dependant and tributary relation to his government, which may account for his being classed amongst the ancient Sovereigns ofthe province. From the commencement of the Caii yuga to the fall of Vicramaditya, Thirteen Rajas are made to reign for the monstrous term of years 3173, viz. Years.

D. 318, relation is given of an extraordinary and incom prehensible occurrence, of which 1 am quite unable to offer any explanation. It has obviously been strangely distorted by popular tradition, though in all probability possessing a foundation in fact. The following is an outline of the story alluded to. A Yavana, or fo- reigner, named Rakta Bahu, (the Red-Armed,) having assembled a large army with the intention of invading Orissa, embarked his troops on vessels with numerous horses and elephants, and having made the coast, anchored at a distance from the khetr of Jagannath, hoping to take Puri by sur- prise. The dung, straw, &c. ofthe horses and elephants, happening however to float ashore in quantities, attracted the notice of some of the people of the town. They immediately reported the unusual appearance to the Raja, who guessed that some powerful enemy was coming to attack him. Seized with a panic he took the image of Sri Jeo or Jagannath out of the tem- ple, lodged it in a covered cart with all its jewels and utensils, and fled away to Sonepur Gopalli, the most remote town on his western frontier. The Yavanas landed, and not finding the prince, plundered the town and temple and committed great excesses every where. The Raja's alarms increased on receiving intelligence of the proceedings of the invaders : he now buried the image under the ground, planted a ber tree over it, and himself fled farther into the jungles. The Yavanas, unable to understand how he had escaped them, began to institute enquiries on the subject, when some of the low people of the coast informed them of the way in which their approach had been discovered. Enraged with the ocean for disclosing his secret, Rakta Bahu drew out his armies to chasti e its waters. The sea, on observing sucb formidable preparations, retrea.ed for nearly a cos\u2014 the infatuated Yavanas rushed on \u2014 when the tide sud-"], [108, "102 ON ORISSA PROPER denly returning with tremendous noise and fury, swallowed up a great portion ofthe army arid inundated the whole country to a frightful extent. The flood reached inland as far as the Baronai Pahar of Khurda, taking with it im mense quantities of sand. It was at this time that the Chilka lake was formed by the irruption ofthe waters ofthe ocean. The Raja died shortly afterwards in the jungles. His son Indra Deo succeeded to the title, but was captured and murdered by the invaders. A Yavana dynasty then ruled over Orissa for the space of 146 years. Thus \u25a0were completed years 396 of the Sacabda. Possibly the tradition which I have described above, may have some connectien with the fierce religious disputes which raged between the worshippers of Brahma and Buddha about the period in which the invasi on of foreigners and the flight of Jagannath is placed, and which as is well known terminated in the expulsion of the latter from the continent of India. A real irruption ofthe ocean may have occurred in the same age, and this; natural calamity, the ever active invention of the Brahmin Chroniclers chose to ascribe to the authors of the bloody wars, revolutions, and other moral evils, which afflicted the country at the time. But it were vain to speculate farther on the origin of an account which is perhaps altogether the work of imagination, and the unravelling of which at all events would require the exercise of much more learning and ingenuity than I can bring to the task. We come now to the accession of the Rajas called the Kesari Pat or Vansa, A. D. 473, from which period I should be disposed to date the commencement of the real history of the province, but before entering upon the account of their reigns I should observe that there is nothing in the preceding relation to explain what is meant by the \" eradicated race of Utcala,\"* alluded to in the inscription- on the pillar at Buddal, which Major W ilford refers to the expulsion of a martial race of Princes from * Vide Asiatic Researches, vol. i."], [109, "OR CUTTACK. 103 Orissa by the Carna Emperors of Behar, prior to the accession ofthe Guja patis; but it would obviously be easy enough to imagine a space for the occurrence of such a revolution, in some of those chasms of upwards of a century's duration, which intervene between many of the early reigns. No information whatever is afforded as to the origin and pedigree of the Princes called the Kesari Vansa or Kesari Bans. The founder of the new dynasty was Jajati (Yayati) Kesari, a warlike and energetic prince, but who he was or whence he came we are not apprized. He soon cleared bis do minions of the Yavanas who then retired to their own country. His Court Was held at Jajepur where he built a palace (Nour) and castle, called Chou dwar, or the mansion with four gates. The most important event of bis. time was the recovery of the image and the restoration of the worship of Jagannath. Directed by certain omens and supernatural appearances, he proceeded to the Purushottem Khetr to institute enquiries regarding the idol and the temple, when the brahmins ofthe place informed him that a tradi tion existed amongst them of Sri Jeo (Jagannath) having been carried off, up wards of a century and a half before, to Sonepur Gopalli, on the invasion of a person called Rakta Bahu, where the form had ever since remained con cealed from mortal eyes. This intelligence induced the Raja to make a visit to the jungles of Sonepur. Miraculously guided, he discovered after $ome search the place where Sri Jeo had been buried, cuts down the ber or banyan tree which overshadowed the sacred spot, and finds the image or images encased in a stone vault, much decayed and disfigured. His next care was to search out ihe Dytapatis and Shewaks, or officiating priests, descended from those who formerly fled from Puri, and having discovered several of them in the Rattenpur country, he consulted with them bow the worship of Jagannath should be revived in all its ancient splendour. The formation of a new image being considered an indispensible preliminary, the priests proceeded into the woods to look for a proper daru or piece of tim ber, and having found one with all the requisite qualities indicated by the H"], [110, "104 ON ORISSA PROPER shastras, they brought it to the Raja, who, filled with pious zeal, clothed both it and the old images in rich robes, and conducted them in great state to Puri. A new temple was then erected on the site of the old one, which was found to be much dilapidated and overwhelmed with sand. The four images were afterwards duly prepared and set up on their sinhasan or throne with much pomp and solemnity on the 5th of Kakara (Cancer j the thirteenth year of the Raja's reign, amidst the shouts and rejoicings of the multitude. At the same time the necessary officers were appointed, feasts and festivals established, sasans founded, and the whole country around Puri assigned as endowments for the maintenance of the temple. On this memorable occasion the Raja received by general acclamation the title of the second lndradyumna. Towards the close of his reign, Raja Yayati Kesari began the buildings at Bhuvaneswar, and died A. D. 520. - The reigns assigned to his two successors, Suraj Kesari and Ananta Kesari, are probably of too long duration, being altogether ninety-seven years, and are distinguished by nothing remarkable, excepting that the lat ter prince began the building of the great temple at Bhuvaneswar. He was succeeded A. D. 617 by Lalat Indra Kesari, a personage of high repute in the legends of the Bhuvaneswar temple, in consequence of his hav ing built or completed the great pagoda at that place sacred to Mahadeo under the title of the Ling Raj Bhuvaneswara, in the year of Salivahana 580 and A. D. 657. He also founded there a large and populous city containing seven suis and forty-two streets which became the capital of the Raj, An uninteresting series of thirty-two reigns of the Kesari Princes fol lows, extending through a period of 455 years, ofthe history of which little is given excepting the characters of the Rajas and some absurd stories"], [111, "OR CUTTACK. 105 connected with the temples of Jagannath and Bhuvaneswara. A few particulars worth noticing however maybe gleaned from the accounts, such as that the rate at which the ryots were taxed by the sovereign was five kahans of cowris per batti, or about one anna per biga. One of the Rajas named Bariya Kesari, in a time of emergency, raised the demand for revenue as high as one kalian of cowris per biga, or four times the former amount, but his successor Suraj Kesari reduced it to the old rate. Raja Nirfipa Kesari, a'martial and ambitious prince, wdio was always fight ing with bis neighbours, is said to have first planted a city on the site of the modern Cuttack, about A. D. 989. The reign of Markat Kesari was distinguished for the construction of a stone revetment, or embankment faced with that material, (probably the ancient one of which the remains are yet to be seen), to protect tbe new capital from inundation A. D. 1006} and Madhava Kesari has the credit of building a fortress of vast dimensions at Sarangher. Different stories are related of the extinction of the Kesari family. The Raj Charitra says, that the last of the line died childless, when at the sug gestion of the deity, another family were brought from the Carnatic by Basudeb Banpati and placed on the throne. The Vynsavali ascribes the change of dynasty to a dispute between the Raja and this same Basudeb Banpati, a brahmin and powerful officer of the court, who having been driv en with indignity from the royal presence, went to the Carnatic and insti gated a person named Churang or Chor Ganga to invade Orissa. He conquered Cuttack, on Friday, the 13th of Assin, A. S. 1054 or A. D. 1131, and thus acquired the sovereignty of the country. Both accounts agree in giving the above as the date of the accession of Raja Churang Deo. This personage, whatever his real origin, is fabled to have been the off spring of tbe goddess Ganga Sana or the lesser Ganges (Godaveri) by a form of Mahadeo. With him began the race of princes called the Ganga yansa, or Gangbans line, who ruled the country for about four centuries, a VI"], [112, "106 ON ORISSA PROPER period fertile in great names and events of importance, and which forms unquestionably the most brilliant and interesting portion of Orissan his tory, if such terms may be applied to the annals of a hitherto unknown dynasty, governing one only of the many provinces which now constitute the British empire in India. Churang, or Sarang Deo, held the reins of government for twenty years', and conformably with bis supernatural origin is believed to have been a skil ful magician, lt is said of him that he established the records of the Jagan nath Temple called the Mandala Panji, and was a great worshipper o\u00a3 certain forms of Devi to the neglect of all the other gods and goddesses* The memory of his reign and of his singular name, which is certainly not an Uria one, is preserved in a Sai or quarter of the town of Puri, with a tank called the Churang Sai. Tradition also ascribes to him the building of forts and palaces both at Sarangher and Cuttack Choudwar. His son Gangeswara Deo succeeded A. D. ] 151. His dominions reach ed from the Ganges to the Godaveri. He had five kutuks or Royal metro polises, viz. Jajpur, Choudwar, Amravati, Chatta or Chatna and Bira nassi, the modern Cuttack. The account which places Amravati, a town near the Kistna in the heart of the Deccan, amongst the capital cities of this Raja, is one of the commoner genealogies to which I attach no great degree of credit. It is not improbable, however, that the place may have formed part of a principality held by Churang Deo when invited to ascend the throne of Orissa, which thereby became annexed, temporarily to the lat ter Raj ; and claims and political relations arising out of the possession of it, may have been one cause of the frequent expeditions south of the Goda veri and the interference in the affairs of Telingana and the Carnatic, which we shall find to be henceforwards exercised by the Ganga Vansa Rajas. As a specimen of the morals ofthe Court of Orissa in this age it should be mentioned, that Raja Gangeswara Deo committed incest with his own"], [113, "OR CUTTACK. 107 daughter, to expiate which offence he dug a superb tank by the advice of the brahmins, called the Kousala Ganj, which is still pointed out between Khurda and Pipley. After two short and unimportant reigns, Raja Anang Bhim Deo, one of the most illustrious of the Princes of the Ganga Vansa line, ascended tbe Gajapati Sinhasan or throne ofthe Gajapatis, A. D. 1174. He resid ed during the early part of his reign in the Nour or palace called Chou dwar at Jajepur, but was induced by some omen to build a magnificent palace on the site of Fort Barabatti, adjoining the town of Cuttack, where he afterwards held his Court chiefly. The construction of the present castle of that name should in all probability be referred to this period, though a later date is generally assigned to it. Raja Anang Bhim Deo may be called the Firoz Shah of the age and country, from the number and varie ty of public works executed by his orders for the benefit or ornament of his dominions: Having unfortunately incurred the guilt of killing a brah min, motives of superstition prompted him to construct numerous temples as an expiation for his offence, whilst the suggestions of a noble and princely spirit urged him to a large expenditure on works of more direct public utility, aa tanks, wells, and bridges. He is said to have built sixty stone dewals or pagodas, ten bridges, forty wells, one hundred and fifty two ghats, and to have founded four hundred and fifty sasans or villages, con taining colonies of brahmins, besides excavating a crore of tanks. He pi ore especially filled the whole khetr of Jagannath with sacred edifices, and the great temple was erected by his orders under the superintendence of Parama hans Bajpoi, at an expence of about thirty or forty lacs. The date of its completion was A. D. 1 196. He at the same time enlarged considerably the establishment, added fifteen brahmin and fifteen sudra Shewaks or officiating priests, and gave fresh splendour to the worship of the deity of the place, by tbe institution of numerous bbogs and jatras (feasts and festivals.) The most remarkable feature of Raja Anang Bhim Deo's reign, however,"], [114, "ON ORISSA PROPER 108 is the measurement undertaken by him ofthe whole of the land comprized within his dominions, and the arrangements connected with that procedure. We are informed that under the superintendence ofthe principal ministers Damodar Bar Panda and Isan Patnaik, the whole country from the Ganges (Hoogley) to the Godaveri, and from the sea to the frontier of Sonepur, was measured out with the rods called Nal and Padkeh.

Connected with and illustrative of the above proceeding, a highly curi ous speech ofthe Raja's is given in the annals ofthe Puri temple, of which I shall here present an abstract translation. Having been warned in a dream by Parameswara (Sri Jagannath,) that it was proper he should offer his devotions at Puri, the Raja proceeded to that place in the 12th year of his reign. After performing the usual worship with great pomp and solemnity, he collected about him the prin?8_ of his family, vassal lords, and chief officers of state, and held the following discourse : \"H_ar, Oh Chiefs and Princes, the arrangements which I have established for the ma- The amount ofthe estimate in square yards or miles, must depend on the size ofthe biga, which is not indicated.

It is known to you that the Rajas of the Kesari line ruled from the Kans Bans river on the north, to the Ras sikoilah south, and from the sea on the east to the Dandpat of Bhfm nagar* west, from which tract of country they derived a revenue of fifteen lacs of marhs of gold. By the grace of Sri Jagannath, the Princes of the Ganga Vansa have, after subduing the khetris and bhuniyas (Zemindars), added to the Raj the following extent of country, viz. on the north that lying between the Kans Bans and the Data's Borbi river, South the coun try from the Rassikoilah down to the Dandpat of Rajmandri, and west to the confines of Boad (Bodh) Sonepur, from which an increase of revenue of twenty lacs has been obtained ; my total gross revenues therefore are thirty-five lacs of marhs of gold. Out of this amount I have assigned stated sums for the payment of the Savvants, (Commanders,) Mahawats, and Rawats, (chiefs of horses and elephants), priests, brahmins, and the worship of the deity. For the maintenance of the Paiks, Shewaks, (vassals ~or officers) and other servants of the state, lands have been duly set apart. Oh Princes and Chiefs, respect my arrangements, and beware that you never resume the above grants and allowances, lest you become liable to the penalty denounced in the shastras against those who take back what bas been given. Above all in the management ofthe country under your charge, be just and merciful to the ryots, and collect revenue from them according to the fixed and established rate. As I have by my own good fortune and exertions accumulated a large treasure, viz. forty lacs of marhs of gold taken from the countries ofthe conquered bhuniyas, and jewels to the value of seven lacs eighty- eight thousand marhs, it is now my inten- tion to devote a portion to the service of Jagannath, by building a new tem- ple oue hundred cubits high, and bestowing a quantity of ornaments and utensils.

An officer named Parama hans Bajpoi was therefore directed to take the work in band forthwith, and twelve lacs and fifty thousand marhs of gold with jewels to the value of 2,50,000 were set apart for the purpose. The marh of gold is stated to be equivalent to five mashas weight, a va luation which would raise the amount of the revenues of Orissa accord ing to the above statement, far beyond what we can believe them ever to have stood at, even allowing, as offered in explanation, that the gold of that age was very impure, and that the statement includes the gross rents of the whole of the lands of the country, both the royal domains and those now held by the hill Zemindars and Poligars. It appears unaccountable too, why the sum total of the revenues should be stated in gold, when we know that cowris always formed the principal currency of the district. As 1 am unable to furnish any satisfactory elucidation of these points, I must leave the statement as it stands, content with having presented a faith ful translation, On the above occasion, likewise, a new coin and seal were struck by the Raja's orders, with the titles which are used to this day by the Khurda Rajas, who claim to represent the majesty of this once powerful race.

It is said that the Raja could muster 3,00,000 Paiks, but his army ordi narily consisted of 50,000 foot and 10,000 horse, with 2,500 elephants, at the head of which he was actively employed in chastising the turbulent and maintaining his authority, throughout the widely extended range of his dominions. His son Ra jeswara Deo reigned thirty-five years and was succeeded A. D. 1236 by Raja Narsinh Deo, surnamed Langora, a prince of great celebrity in the annals of Orissa, as well as in its legends and romances. His great personal strength, and skill in athletic exercises, seem to have invested him with a sort of supernatural character in the eyes of bis subjects, and popu lar tradition has exaggerated some peculiarity in his figure or dress, into the fable of his being provided with a tail, whence is derived the epithet Lan gora. He is said to have been of a very martial turn, and to have waged a long war to the southward. It was this Raja who built the famous temple of the sun at Kanfirak, called by the Europeans the Black Pagoda \" thereby, observes the Author ofthe Ayin Acberi, erecting for himself a lasting monument of fame.\" The work was executed chiefly under the superintendence of the minister Shi bai Santra, and is stated to have been completed in the year cf the Sacdbda 1200, answering to J 277 A.

The Chronicles of the country contain no mention of such an event. I have not Major Stewart's authorities at hand to refer to, but strongly suspect that he has been led into an error by mistaking some word resembling Ja jipur, for Jajipur in Orissa. He expresses himself thus, \"In the year \"641 (A. D. 1243) the Raja of Jagepur (Orissa) hating given some cause \"of offence, Toghan khan marched to Ketasun on tbe frontier of Jagepur \" where he found the army ofthe Raja bad thrown up intrenchments to op \" pose him.\" In a battle which ensued, the invaders were defeated, and the Hindus elated with their victory pursued them and ventured even to lay siege to Gour, but assistance arriving they retired. Now, in the first place, Jajipur was never a separate principality as here described, and there is no such place in Orissa as Ketasun. Ferishteh is altogether silent on the subject in his history of Bengal, but in his general history he ascribes the siege of Gour, in the very year in question, to a party of Mogul Tartars who bad invaded Bengal by way of Chitta, Thibet, &c. Dow's mistake of a similar nature is scarcely worth noticing. He makes Sultan Balin pursue the rebel Toghral into Jajnagar (A. D. 1239), which he calls Orissa, whereas it is evident from the mention of Sunargaon, as lying on tbe road, that Jajna gar is some place beyond the Ganges. After Raja Langora Narsinh Deo, five other princes named Narsinh (Nara Sinha) and six with the title of Bhann, whom some describe as a se parate family called Suraj-bansi (Surya Vansa), ruled over Orissa, until A. D. 1451. Their reigns are for the most part undistinguished by events of importance, but they have left some public works which coupled with other monuments of the Ganga Vansa Rajas, give a favorable impression of the public spirit and munificence of that race. Amongst these the fine bridge at -the entrance of Puri called the Athara Naleh, said to have been built A. D. 1300, by Raja Kabir Narsinh Deo, is the most worthy of notice.

The last of the Rajas surnamed Bhanu, being childless, be adopted as his son and successor a youth, named Kapila or Kapil Santra, of the Su- raj-bansi tribe of Rajputs. The boy became afterwards a prince of high renown under the title of Kapil Indra Deo, and the Native Chroniclers have not failed therefore to embellish the history of his early life, with flattering fictions and stories of supernatural occurrences, prophetic of his future rise and greatness. It is said, that when a child, be gained his livelihood by tending the cows of a brahmin. One day his master found him fast asleep on the ground at mid-day, and a huge snake standing erect near him, with its hood spread out and held in such a manner, as to shelter him from the fierce rays of the meridian sun. This indication satisfied the brah- min that he was destined to become something great. Shortly after, tbe Raja, whilst passing one day to the temple, took notice of him, enquired his name, and being struck with his answers and appearance, finding moreover that he was by caste and descent a rawat or leader of the Suraj-bansi Rajputs, he attached bim to the royal household, where he speedily became a favorite.

D. 1451, under the title of Kapil Indra Deo. His reign is described to have been one continued series of wars, sieges, and expeditions. He visited in person every quarter of bis widely extended dominions, but was occupied chiefly to tbe southward, and resided a good deal at Kimedy and Rajamandry. He also visited the city of Vijianagara (Bidyanagar) and founded there several Sasans, more especially one called Damoderpur Sasan. The Raja afterwards pursued his conquests as far down as Rama's bridge, which the natives call Set Band Rameswara. The subjugation of a fort called Kondajoi or Kondjuri, perhaps Condapilly, and his proceed ings there, are much spoken of. He is said to have deposed one Raja, and set up another called Narsinh Rai. Amongst his conquests, places called Maligunda and Malka (Malanca) are likewise mentioned. The particulars of the Raja's wars and expeditions in that distant quarter are, however, so loosely and indistinctly narrated, that it is impossible to make any thing satisfactory out of the account. He died near Condapilly, on the banks of the Kistna, after a busy and distinguished reign of twenty seven years. The period of his administration was farther remarkable for the occurrence of two dreadful famines which swept off vast numbers ofthe human race. The price of paddy again rose during them to 125 kahans per bharan. The ehasms and omissions above noticed in the native annals of Orissa, are curiously enough supplied in part by Ferishteh's history of the Bah mini Sovereigns of Kalberga. Up to this period the Musselman kings of the Deccan, engaged in perpetual contests with the ousted Rais of Te lingana and the Carnatic, had possessed neither leisure nor inclination to in terfere with the affairs of Orissa. The two powers seem first to have come in contact during Kapil Indra Deo's reign ; and if the Musselman accounts are correct, disputes between them originated in the aggressions of the Raja of Orissa."], [121, "OR CUTTACK. 115 Ferishteh relates, that in the time of Humayun Shah Bahmini, about A. D. 1457, the Telingahs prevailed on the Rajas of Orissa and Uria to afford them assistance against the Mohammedans, who sent a large army to their aid, with many war elephants. The confederates completely defeated the armies of Islam, and pursued them from the field of battle for many miles. Under Nizam Shah, son of tlie above, the Rai of Orissa in conjunction with the powerful Zemindars or Khetris (Poligars) of Telingana, again in vaded the territories ofthe Deckany sovereigns by w7ay of Rajamandry and plundered as far as Kolas.* The Rai of Orissa is said to have advanced in great state and splendour, \" ba shouket tamami,\" with the declared in tention of conquering the whole of Telingana from the Mussulmans, and compelling them to pay tribute. When he had arrived however within ten miles ofthe Mohammedan capital Ahmedabad (Beder), the ministers taking courage sent him a message of defiance saying that \" their king had long in \" tended to subjugate Orissa and Jehannagar and render it tributary, but \" the idea ofthe distance of that country had hitherto deterred him from the \" undertaking : however as the Raja had now come so far to throw himself \"into the jaws of destruction, much trouble would be saved to the victorious \" armies of Islam.\" This bravado was followed up by a spirited sally of Patan horse, which cooled a little the ardour of the Hindus, and induced them to fall back. They were finally glad to purchase a secure retreat to their own frontier, by paying down a sum of five lacs of tankas. Ferishteh goes on to state, that in the year 1471 A. D. the Rai of Uria called Himber, complained to King Mohammed Shah that he had been driv en from his possessions by an usurper who was supported from Orissa, and offered on condition of obtaining effectual assistance for the recovery of his rights, to become tributary to the Musselman government, and to cede cer tain forts. It is not easy to satisfy one's self what is meant by this word * The boldness and enterprize of the Orissan monarchs in those days, may surprize us when we con sider the situation of Kolas in the heart of central India, bey oudKalberga and .Beder."], [122, "116 ON ORISSA PROPER ifria, which Ferishteh uses sometimes as tbe name of a person, and some times as that of a district, but from the whole context there seems reason to think that the author intends to designate by the term, the country be tween Raj amand ry and Condapilly, &c. held probably at that time as a fief or dependency of the Orissan monarchy. The Bahmini king, who had always wished to obtain a footing on the Godaveri, agreed to Himber's proposal, marched an army into Uria, defeat-* ed the usurper Mangal Rai, and restored the principality to his ally, taking for his own share the forts of Rajamandry and Condapilly. After sometime Rai Uria seems to have repented of his connection with the Mohammedans, and to have become desirous of returning to his old allegiance. One of those destructive famines noticed in my accounts of Raja Kapil Indra Deo's reign, having spread general ruin and consterna tion throughout the Deccan, the conjuncture appeared to him favorable for making an effort to throw off the Musselman yoke, and he accordingly dispatched a message to the Rai of Orissa (which is fully detailed by Ferish teh) saying that \" if he wished to recover his hereditary dominions in Telin gana, now was the time.\" The Raja, on receiving this invitation, collected together an army of 10,000 foot and 8,000 horse, and summoning all his tri butary chiefs to attend him, proceeded into Telingana without delay. Mo hammed Shah hastened to oppose the combined forces of Orissa and Uria, and soon compelled the Rais to retreat across the lake of Rajamandry. He then, says Ferishteb, resolved to punish the idolater for his insolence and aggres sion, and taking with him a chosen body of 20,000 men, made a dash into Orissa, and penetrated as far as the capital, plundering and laying waste the country on all sides. The Raja unable to withstand the fury ofthe storm which he had so rashly raised, fled before the invaders, and was soon oblig ed to sue humbly for peace, which was granted only on condition of his pay ing down a large sum of gold and silver, and surrendering twenty-five cele brated elephants which be valued next his life.

This inroad, which supposing the chronology of the two histories to be correct, must have happened (if at all) towards the close of Raja Kapil In dra Deo's reign, is not noticed in the meagre imperfect sketch of the events of that period, given in the Orissan annals. They make their Raja return however from the Deccan to Pursottem Chatter, about the date in question, when he consults the god as to which of his seven sons, all distinguished for their princely qualities and accomplishments, he should appoint his suc cessor in the Raj. He was instructed to elect Pursottem Rai, though the youngest and born of a concubine. The choice was justified by his superior merit, and as the will of Sri Jeo at all events could not be disputed, the Raja named Pursottem Rai his successor, and took the favored youth with him on his last expedition to the banks of the Kistna, where he died as be fore stated A. D. 1478. The Raja elect, having been acknowledged by the army on the Kistna as their sovereign, under the title of Pursottem Deo, returned with what speed he could to Cuttack, where bis presence was necessary to counteract the in trigues and opposition of his six brothers, all indignant at their supercession. Their enmity and machinations long disturbed the peace of his Court, but he at last succeeded in expelling them, and they then retired to various quarters, where they built forts and established principalities for them selves. The reign of Raja Pursottem Deo is rendered memorable by the most striking exploit recorded in the annals of Orissa, viz. the expedition to and conquest of Conjeveram. The circumstances of that transaction de serve to be rescued from oblivion, as well for the curious picture which they afford of the manners and opinions of the age and nation, as from their connection with an historical incident of some importance. The"], [124, "ON ORISSA PROPER 118 fullest account of the expedition is to be found in the poem before noticed, called the Kanjikaveri Pot'hi, though as tbe author has had recourse to tbe embellishment of a regular epic machinery, the narrative is encumbered by fictitious characters and incidents. It is also much dwelt upon in all the Native histories, which agree in the main points of the relation, with some discrepancies as to the details. The story runs nearly as follows : \" In the country of Dakhin Kanouj Kernat Sasan, there lived a powerful Raja who had avast fortress and pa lace built of a fine black stone, called Kanjinagar or Kanjikaveri (Con jeveram) and a daughter so beauteous and accomplished, that she was surnamed Pudmavati or Padmini.* The fame of her charms having reached to the ears of Maharaja Pursottem Deo, he became anxious to es pouse her, and sent a messenger accordingly to the Chief of Conjeveram to solicit the hand of his fair daughter. That Raja was well pleased with the prospect of having for his son-in-law so great and powerful a prince as the Gajapati of Orissa, but considered it advisable to make some en quiries regarding the customs and manners of that Court, before consent ing to the alliance. He soon found that the Maharajas were in the habit of performing the duties of a sweeper (Chandal) before the image of Ja gannath, on its being brought forth from the temple annually at the Rat'h Jatra. Now the Kanjinagar Raja was a devoted and exclusive worshipper of Sri Ganesh (Ganesa), and had very little respect for Sri Jeo, the divinity of Orissa; and conceiving the above humiliation to be quite unworthy of, and indeed utterly disgraceful to a Khetri of such high rank, he declined the alliance in consequence. The Gajapati monarch became very wroth at the refusal, and swore, that to revenge the slight cast on him, he would obtain the damsel by force and marry her to a real sweeper. He accord ingly marched with a large army to attack Conjeveram, but was defeated * This was the name of a Princess, whose amours with Khosru Perviz, are celebrated in several In dian and Persian Romances, and is in Sanscrit indeed the general name of a particular class of beauties."], [125, "OR CUTTACK. 119 obliged to retire. Overwhelmed with shame and confusion, be now threw, himself at the feet of Sri Jeo, and earnestly supplicated his inter- ference to avenge the insult offered to the deity himself in the person of his faithful worshipper. The god promised assistance, says the author of the poem, directed him to assemble another army, and assured him that he w7ould this time take the command of the expedition against Conjeve- ram in person. When the Raja had arrived, during the progress of his march, at the site of the village now called Manikpatam, he began to grow anxious for some visible indication of the presence of the deity. In the midst of his cogitations on the subject, a milkmaid or gwalin named Manika, came up and displayed a ring which she said had been entrusted to her, to present to the monarch of Orissa, by two handsome Cavaliers, mounted the one on a black, and the other on a white horse, who had just passed on to the southward. She also related some particulars of a con- versation* with them which satisfied the Raja that the promise of assistance would be fulfilled, and that these horsemen were no other than the bro- thers Sri Jeo (Krishna) and Baldeo (Baladeva.) Full of joy and gratitude, he directed the village to be in future called, after his fair informant, Ma- nikpatana, and marched onwards to the Deccan secure of success. On the other hand the chief of Conjeveram, alarmed at the second advance of the Gajapati in great force, appealed for aid to his protecting deity Ganesh, who candidly told him that he had little chance against Jagannath, but would do his best. The siege was now opened and many obstinate and bloody battles were fought under the w7alls of the fort. The gods Sri Jeo and Ganesh, espousing warmly the cause of their respective votaries, perform many miracles and mix personally in the engagements, much in the style of the Homeric deities before the walls of Troy ; but the latter as always worsted. In reality, after a long struggle, Conjeveram fell before rtbe armies of Orissa.

She is said to have conceived and brought forth a son by Maha deo, shortly after which she disappeared. All the circumstances were explain ed to the husband in a dream, who acknowledged gratefully the honor con ferred on him, and declared the child thus mysteriously born his successor in the Raj. Pursottem Deo died after a reign of twenty-five years, and was succeed ed by Pertab Janamuni, the son of Padmavati, under the title of Pertab Rudra Deo, A. D. 1503. The wisdom and learning of this prince soon be came the theme and admiration of the whole country. He had studied deeply all the shasters, was very fond of disputing and conversing on points of theology, and introduced many curious Constructions of his own, and doctrines which were altogether new. He was withal devout, and built \u2022many temples. His skill in the arts of war and civil government, were eminent; in short he was equally celebrated as an able, learned, warlike and religious prince. A very curious anecdote is related of his conduct, which seems to shew that the followers of Buddha continued to form a sect of importance in this part of India until the beginning of the sixteenth century.* It is said that a serious robbery happened in the Raja's palace, and that he being anxious to discover the perpetrators, assembled together all the.wise men, both of the Bauddhist and Brahminical persuasion, to ob tain their assistance in prosecuting an investigation. The brahmins could -tell nothing, but the followers of Buddha, through their knowledge of the occult art, were enabled to point out both the offender and the place where the stolen property was concealed. The Raja was induced by this inci dent to form so high an opinion of the learning and skill of the Bauddhists, that he became for some time a warm supporter of that sect. His Rani * As this is contrary to received opinions, to the inferences warranted by the works of Midhavi cliArya in the 13th century and the statement of AhulfazI in the 16th, it seems likely that the original authorities have confounded, as is very commonly the c .se, the Bauddhas and Jains, and that the latter are here intended.\u2014 Note by the Secretary^ P 2"], [128, "122 ON ORISSA PROPER on the other hand espoused zealously the cause of the brahmins. It was at last determined to make another formal trial of their relative skill as men of science, or rather magicians. Accordingly a snake was secretly put into an earthen jar, the mouth of which being covered up, the vessel was produced in a great assembly at the palace. Both parties were then asked what the jar contained. The brahmins answered, \" it contains only earth,\" and sure enough when opened it was found to contain nothing but earth. This specimen of skill entirely changed the Raja's opinions, and he now became as violent against the Bauddhists as he had been before prejudiced in their favour \u2014 so much so that he not only withdrew his pro tection and countenance, but violently expelled the whole sect from his dominions, and destroyed all their books except the pot'his called the Amer Singh and Bir Singh (Amara Sinha and Vira Sinha). lt is added that about this time Chytunya or Chytan Mahaprabhu came from Naddia in Bengal to visit the temple of Jagannath, and that he performed miracles before the Raja. The key to the whole story is probably to be found in the visit of this celebrated Vyshnavite reformer or sectary, who doubtless had some share in creating the hostile disposition of Raja Pertab Rudra Deo, towards the followers of the heretical Budha. Another of those famines which have so often afflicted India, qccurred early in this century in Orissa. The Raja who could find leisure for schemes of conquest and ambition amidst his religious enquiries and controversies, marched with his army down to Setu Band Rameswara, reduced several forts, and took the famous city of Vijayanagara. The Mohammedans of the Deccan also gave abundant occupation to bis arms on the southern frontier of the Raj, and whilst he was occupied in repelling or provoking their attacks, the Afghans from Bengal made an inroad into the province in great force. They advanced as far as Cuttack, and pitched their camp in the neighbourhood of the city, when tbe Governor Anant Singhar finding himself unable to oppose any effectual resistance, took refuge in the strong fortress of Sarangerh, south of the Katjuri. After satiating themselves"], [129, "OR CUTTACK. 123 with the plunder of the capital, they proceeded towards PGri where they committed dreadful devastations ; but the grand object of their search, the Idol or Deo of Orissa, had been removed out of their reach, the priests having taken the precaution, so soon as they heard ofthe approach ofthe invaders, to carry off Sri Jeo and the other images in boats across the Chilka in order to conceal them amongst the hills. Raja Pertab Rudra Deo on receiving intelligence of these disastrous occurrences, hastened back from the Deccan, and performing a journey of months in a few days, he came up with the invading army before they had left the khetr, gave them battle, and destroyed a great number of the Mlecchas (Foreigners and Barbarians). He was however himself so much crippled by the contest, that he was happy to conclude a peace nearly on the enemy's terms, when they retired and left the province to itself. This Prince died A. D. 1524, having reigned twenty-one years. With the three above remarkable reigns, terminate all the glories of the Ganga Vansa dynasty, and the royal house of Orissa. The race itself became ex tinct soon after the demise of Raja Pertab Rudra Deo, and the indepen dence ofthe country was not destined long to survive. Pressed at both extremities by the vigour and enterprize of the Mohammedan governments of Bengal and Telingana, now in the full maturity of their strength, the downfall of the Orissan monarchy was further hastened by intestine com motions, disunion amongst the chiefs, and a series of bloody and destructive contests for the supreme dignity. Pertab Rudra Deo left thirty-two sons. The eldest of these reigned about five years, when he was murdered by the powerful minister Govind Bidyadhar. Another son succeeded, who was murdered at the expiration of a year. The minister then barbarously put to death the whole ofthe remaining thirty princes of the royal house, by the hands of his own son Madhu Srichander, and having destroyed several other persons of emi nence, he thus literally waded up to his neck in blood to the throne, which"], [130, "ON ORISSA PROPER 124 he ascended A. D. 1533 under the title of Raja Govind Deo. Two re markable personages became first generally known during his administrati on, Mukund Harichandan, the Telinga, who received the government of the town of Cuttack, and Danaye or Danardan Bidyadhar, who, was ap pointed Prime Minister. The former afterwards became Raja of the coun try, and was the last of its independent sovereigns ; the latter, though not himself a king, was the parent of kings \u2014 in other words, he was the ances tor of the third and titular branch of the Gajapatis of Orissa, known in af ter ages as the Rajas of Khurda. The presence of the Raja being required in the Deccan, he resided (or eight months at Malgunda or Maligonda with his minister. We may in fer from Ferishteh, that the possession of Rajamundry and other places near the Godaveri was about this period much disputed between the Uria princes and the Musselman kings of the Deccan, both the Bahminis, and that branch of their successors who ruled at Golconda under the title of Kutteb Shahis. Ferishteh's account of the latter monarchs contains a passage relating to Orissa which I may here quote. He says, \" Hindu *' writers observe that there are three countries adjoining each other, the \" climates of which resemble each other greatly, and possess much the same \" peculiarities, viz. Teling, Beng, and Oorek (Orixa). Teling, is that pos \" sessed by the Kutteb Shahi sovereigns. Beng, is Bengala. Oorek lies be *' tween them.

These occurrences obliged the Raja to return with a large part of his army, and a pitched battle took place be tween the parties, when the insurgents were defeated and pursued as far as the Ganges. Raja Govind Deo died on the banks of that river at the Das Aswamedb ghat, in the seventh year of his rule. Pertab Chakra Deo was then placed on the throne by the minister Danaye Bidiadhur, who, after seeing bis authority properly established, returned to the Deccan to look after matters in that quarter. Though a weak, oppressive, and tyrannical prince, who carried his excesses so far even as to distress brahmins, he was maintained in the government for about eight years by the influence and support of his minister, and then died sud ] denly in the temple itself. There being no heir left ofthe Rajas of Orissa, a chief named Narsingh Jenna, distinguished for his bravery and conduct, stept into the vacant seat of government. Jealous of the influence of Danaye Bidiadhur, he procured his attendance from the Deccan, and then with the assistance of his rival Mukund Harichandan, threw him into chains and imprisonment at Cuttack. In the mean time Raghu Bhanj Chotra, having recovered from his former defeat, entered Orissa again at the head of a large force to assert his claims to the Raj. He was opposed by Mukund Harichandan, who took him prisoner after many bloody battles. Narsingh Jenna was deposed at the end ofthe year, it does not appear by whom, and the reins of government then passed into the hands ofthe most undoubtedly powerful officer in the province, Mukund Harichandan, the Telinga, who ascended the throne ofthe Gajapatis, A. D. 1550, under the well known title of Telinga Mukund Deo."], [132, "126 ON ORISSA PROPER All the native accounts concur in describing their last independent Raja as a man of courage and abilities. He has been honored with a notice in the work of the Jesuit Tieffentbaler, who extends our knowledge of his character by informing us that \"the last king of the Orissans was called Mukund, who was very polite to strangers and had four hundred women.\" The early part of his reign was employed chiefly in constructing monu- ments of public utility or superstition, as temples, tanks, and brahmini- cal sasans. Amongst other works of the kind, he founded a ghat and temple at the sacred spot called Tribeni, on the Hoogly, north ofthe town of that name which formed the extreme verge of his dominions, and whilst so occupied, frequent communications are said to have passed between bim and the king of Delhi, or rather the officers of the emperor. Soliman Gurzani, the Afghan king or governor of Bengal, having assembled an army to invade Orissa, the Raja built a strong fortress in some command- ing situation, and for this time opposed his endeavours successfully. At last however came Kala Pahar General ofthe Bengal forces, the destined conqueror of Orissa, with his wonder-working kettle drum, at the sound of which the ears and feet of the idols would drop off for many coss all around. The Hindus say of this dreaded enemy of their images and su- perstition, that he was originally a brahmin, but lost caste through a con- trivance of the princess of Gaura, who was smitten with the manly beauty of bis person. He then married her, turned Musselman, and became a relentless persecutor ofthe adherents of the faith from which he had apos- tatized. Many dire omens preceded and announced bis arrival in the province; amongst others a large stone fell from the summit of tbe great tower of the temple at Puri, and when he entered the precincts of the khetr, a general darkness overspread the four corners of the land. In short, Kalapahar. invaded Orissa on the part of the king or governor of Bengal with an army of Afghan Cavalry, defeated and killed the Raja or drove him from the country, and finally overthrew the independent sove reignty of Orissa, A. D. 1558. Two titular princes were set up after the expulsion of Mukund Deo, who both fell into the bands of tbe conquerors"], [133, "OR CUTTACK. 127 and were put to death by them. An anarchy of twenty-one years duration then ensued, during which the Afghan Mohammedans possessed the whole of tbe open country, and there was no Raja. The several accounts which have been handed down of Kalapahar's in vasion of Orissa, differ widely in the details, though the main facts are well known and established. The story told by the Musselman writers is that, Mukund Deo, apprehending the designs of the king or governor of Ben gal, encamped with a large part of his army on the Ganges, but Kalapahar turning his position got a-head of him into Orissa, and began to plunder tbe country and attack the temples of the Hindus with relentless fury, before any force could be brought to check him. A battle at length took place at Jajipur in which the Raja lost his life. The Afghan chief then went onto Sambhelpur where be was killed by some of the Bhuyans. Others say that on his passing the great temple ofthe Ling Raj at Bhuvaneswara, a swarm of bees issued from the throne of the idol and stung him to death. The Puri Vynsavali makes the Raja to have been busy in Khurda when the Afghan army suddenly advanced upon Cuttack, defeated the Gover nor Gopi Sawant Sinhar, and plundered the palace and treasury, alarmed at which news, Mukund Deo fled out of the province not daring to op- pose so powerful a force, and died shortly after in the king of Delhi's do- minions. The relation in Gladwin's Bengal of the Raja building fort Ba- yabati, when he heard of Kalapahar's approach, and going to sleep for many months according to custom, until roused by the alarming sound of the magic kettle drum, is a third version of the story which carries with it its own refutation. All the native writers however agree in speaking with horror of the cruel excesses committed by their Afghan conqueror, and the wide destruction of images and temples occasioned by his unrelenting per secution of the Hindu faitfy, T fye adventures of the great idol form a curious episode in the history of"], [134, "128 ON ORISSA PROPER this important period. According to the Mandala Panji, when the priests at Puri saw the turn which matters were taking, they again for the third time in their annals, hurried away the helpless god in a covered cart, and buried him in a pit at Parikud, on the Chilka Lake. Kdlapahar was not however to be defrauded of so rich a prize, and having traced out the place of concealment, he dug up Sri Jeo and carried him off on an elephant, as far as the Ganges, after breaking in pieces every image in the Khetr. He then collected a large pile of wood, and setting fire to it, threw the idol on the burning heap, but immediately all his limbs dropped off and he perished tniserably. A bystander observed, \" this is a punishment for the indignity offered to the Deo of Orissa,\" and snatching the image from the flames, threw it into the river. The whole proceeding had been watched by Besar Mainti, a faithful votary of Jagannath, who followed the half burnt image as it floated down the stream, and at last when unperceived, managed to extract from it the sacred part (Brahm or spirit in the original), and brought it back secretly to Orissa, where it was carefully deposited in charge of the Khandait of Kujang. It appears from Ferishteh, that the Afghans under Daood Khan, the son of Soloman Karsani (or Gurzani), were allowed to retain possession of Orissa for some time after the overthrow ofthe native government ; but hav ing drawn down upon themselves the vengeance ofthe Emperor Akber by their turbulence and violent proceedings, they were several times attacked, first by Monaim Khan and afterwards by Khan Jehan, who wrested their new acquisition from them about 1578 A. D. and annexed it to the rent roll of the empire. Ferishteh in this place calls the province Orissa, and Katak, Benares. The Uria historians go on to relate, that, at the expiration ofthe twen ty-one years of anarchy and interregnum, the ministers and principal men of the country beginning to recover from their depression and alarm, as sembled together to consult about the affairs of the nation, and chose as"], [135, "OR CUTTACK. 129 tbeir chief a person named Ranai Raotra, son of the before mentioned mi nister Danaye Bidyadhar, whom they raised to the rank and dignity of Maharaja of Orissa, A. D. 1580, under the title of Ramchander Deo. With him begins the third and titular race of Sovereigns called the Bhoi Vansa, or Zemindari race. The election was confirmed by Sewai Jye Sinh, the general of the Emperor Akber, who came into the province about the time, with his army, to look after the Imperial interests. The sight of Bhuvanes wara, its numerous temples, the crowds of brahmins, and the sacred character of every thing in Utcala Desa, is said to have impressed him with feelings of so much reverence and admjration for the country, that he determined to interfere very little in its affairs, and retired shortly afterwards, leaving a large share of authority in the hands of its Native Princes. The town of Midnapore was at this time made the northern boundary of Orissa. Raja Ramchander Deo's first care was to recover the sacred relics be longing to the old image of Jagannath, which duty being accomplished with the assistance of their preserver Besar Majnti, the Dar u Mttrat, or image made of tbe wood ofthe Nim tree, was fabricated according to the rules of the shaster, and again set up in the temple, on a propitious day, >vith much pomp and solemnity. The worship of Sri Jeo was now fully restored, all she feasts and endowments of the temple put on their old footing, and a number of sasans were founded in honor ofthe memorable event. It was disturbed again however almost immediately afterwards, by an invasion of Musselmans from Golconda, whose king or Adipati, as the Hindu writers call him, seems to have given the Raja a severe defeat. In 1582 A. D. the celebrated Dewan of the empire, Raja Toder, or as the U'rias call him Toral Mall, visited the province, to superintend the in troduction of his settlement called the Taksim Jamma and Tankha Raq mi. He proceeded no further with it, apparently, than the three Sircars pf Jelasore, Badrak, and Cuttack. All the account which is preserved 93"], [136, "130 ON ORISSA PROPER of that important and memorable transaction, is, that from the time of Toral Mall's visit to the province, the measurement by the Bareb Dasti Padika or rod of twelve spans, was introduced. He is said to have treated the Raja with much respect, and to have admired greatly the temple and image of Jagannath, but bis proceedings must have been fatal to tbe power and au thority of the Gajapati prince, as he seems to have annexed nearly the whole of his domains to the imperial rent roll. The Mogul arrangements for the management of the new Suba of Orissa, did not receive their final completion until A. D. 1592 or 999 Amli, when Raja Man Sinh, the imperial Lieutenant in Bengal, came to as sume charge of the administration. His expedition was prompted, partly by the view to expel the Afghans, who under Kattali Khan had again taken possession of a large part of the province, and committed every where the most frightful ravages and excesses, and partly to settle disputes which had arisen between Ramchander Deo the titular Raja, and the two sons of Telinga Mukund Deo, of whom the eldest was named Ramchander Rai, and the second Chaki or Chakowri Bhowerber. The fate of Kat tali Khan and his Afghans, may be read in Major Stewart's history of Bengal. With respect to the native princes, Raja Man Sinh finding that disputes ran high for possession ofthe Raj, and that both parties bad pow erful supporters amongst the Khandaits or Military Zemindars, it was judged expedient to make a division amongst them of tbe remnant left to the royal house of Orissa ofthe territories of their ancestors. According ly Khurda, with Pursottem Chetter, and certain Mehals, were assigned in Zemindari tenure, free of all tribute, to Ramchander Deo, with tbe title of Maha Raja, and the Musselman dignity of the commandership of three thousand five hundred. He was also allowed to exercise the chiefship or sovereignty over, and to collect tribute from, 129 of the killahs or juris dictions of the Khetris of Orissa, including all the present Cuttack tribu tary Mehals south of the Mahanadi, and the Estates of Gumser, Moherry, &c. reaching as far as the borders of Kimedy in Ganjam. Killah Al, with"], [137, "OR CUTTACK. 131 its dependencies, was assigned as a Zemindari to- Ramchander, the eldest son of Telinga Mukund Deo, and Sarengerh on the same tenure to the se cond son Chakouri Bhowerber. Both were acknowledged as Rajas, and bad the controul of a number of the Killahjat estates in different parts of the district. These arrangements have been already adverted to more in detail, in that portion of my paper which is designed to furnish some ac count of the land tenures and political institutions of Orissa. The title of sovereignty has been always acknowledged by the general Voice and feeling of the country, to vest in the Rajas of Khurda, though disputed formerly by the other branches of the royal house who have now sunk into entire insignificance. The former received by far the largest and most valuable portion ofthe country, in Man Sinh's allotment, and the ces sion of Puri alone was a sufficient acknowledgment of their superior claims. Down to the present moment, the Rajas of Khurda are the sole fountain of honour in this district, and all deeds whatever drawn out in the Uria language, bear the date of the Ank or accession of the reigning prince of that bouse, and are prefaced with a recital of his titles, which run precisely in the style adopted many centuries ago by the great Raja Anang Bhim Deo. Ramchander Deo enjoyed his station and dignities for twenty-nine years. He was an able and respectable prince, and his memory seems to be much venerated by the natives of the province. From his time, the field embraced by the Orissan annals, becomes greatly narrowed, though they still afford a vast deal of curious local information.

To ay nothing of other fruitful sources of jealousy and animosity, this interference j lone was sufficient to produce many bloody encounters between the two nations, in which success Was often doubtful. On the whole however, the native Princes suffered the most severely, and gradually sank before the superior energy and civili zation ofthe Moguls. The Rajas had at first established their residence at Pipley; afterwards they retired to Rathipur; and finally built their fort and palace in a naturally difficult part of Khurda, where they were found settled in 1803. During these contests in and about Puri, the images so much venerated by the one party and abhorred by the other, were twice or thrice carried away across the Chilka Lake, and concealed amidst tbe hills, until the times appeared favorable for again setting them upon their thrones in the temple. This religious warfare was at last set at rest by the institution of the tax on pilgrims, which if we may credit the author of the work trans lated by Glad win, under the title of History of Bengal, yielded to the Mogul government a revenue of nine lacs. Under such circumstances, reli gious antipathies however strong on the part ofthe ruling power, must have yielded gradually to considerations of self-interest. The Afghans did not disappear from the field as disturbers of the peace of Cuttack, until 1611 A. D. when having again risen under Osman Khan the son of Kattali, they were defeated with great slaughter on the Subanre kha by Shujat Khan from Bengal, and compelled finally to submit. They then settled peaceably in many ofthe principal villages of the district, and their descendants at this day form no inconsiderable Musselman popula tion, under the general denomination of Pathans, On the side of Rajwara, the Rajas had to maintain many fierce contests with the Khetri chiefs or zemindars subordinate to them, who became tur bulent and unruly in proportion as the power and consequence ofthe chief of their class declined. Frequently, no doubt, a spirit of aggrandizement urged the Rajas to become the aggressors. Of the operation of either one"], [140, "ON ORISSA PROPER 134 or both causes of hostility, we may trace abundant proofs, in the dismem berment of many ofthe old Khandaitis recorded in the accounts of Raja Man Sinh's settlement, which became afterwards annexed to Khtirda. Tbe state of the country is represented in no favorable light during the administration of the famous Jaffer Khan Nasiri, whose arrangements more over could not have tended much to improve it. In Gladwin's history of Bengal it is mentioned that Jaffer Khan whilst Dewan, represented to the Court of Delhi, \" the advantages that would accrue to the crown by trans ferring the Jagirs of the Mansabdars of Bengal to Orissa, where the lands are of less value, and the collections made with greater expense and difficul ty.\" It is added that, the Emperor approving the scheme, assignments were granted upon Orissa, the cultivation of which province had of late been very much neglected, in lieu of the Bengal Jagirs. The administration of Mohammed Taki Khan, the Naib, (1725 to 1735, A. D.) on the part of Shujaa ad Din Mohammed, JNazim of the three provinces, is marked by a great reduction of the limits of the province of Orissa. In his time the remainder of the old Jelasore Sircar* lying be tween Tumlook, Midnapore, and the Subanreka, with the exception of a few small pergunnahs near the latter river, was annexed to Bengal, and the Nizam's government obtained possession either by force or intrigue of the entire country included between the estates called Tikallyf Raghunath pur, and the Chilka lake, thus greatly reducing the revenues and authority of the Rajas of Khurda, whose controul had before extended on the hill side, from G mnser to within forty miles of Cicacole.

But tbe greatest of all their calamities was now impending over the un fortunate Orissans. After some alarming demonstrations in the year pre ceding, the Berar Marhattas suddenly made their appearance in the pro vince, in Phalgun 1150 Anili, in large force under Bhaskar Pundit, Ali Shah, and other sirdars, with the professed object of demanding the Chout. There being no force in the province adequate to oppose them, they swept the whole country up to the walls of fort Barabatti, plundering what ever they could lay their hands on without mercy, \u2014 and the same scenes were repeated the year following, by a still larger army under Ragoji Bhonsla himself, and the famous adventurer Habib Uliah. Aliverdi Khan made astonishing efforts to relieve the province, as well as to protect the adjoining districts from these destructive inroads, but the people of Midnapore and Cuttack enjoyed little respite from the Marhatta incur sions and depredations until 1157, when a temporary arrangement was patched up between the Nazim and the Bhonsla, by which the former agreed to pay twenty-four lacs (including arrears) as the Chout of the three provinces. The conditions of the treaty being very indifferently ob served on the part of the Bengal government, a fresh army invaded Orissa in 1160, under the command of Raja Janoji Bhonsla and Mir Habib Ul* lab, who in the same year, in their camp at Choudwar, near the Mahanadi, R"], [142, "136 ON ORISSA PROPER projected and arranged a partition of the province between themselves, for the maintenance of their respective armies. Its resources on this occa sion were estimated at only ten lacs. The northern portion from Pattas pur to Barrunwa, yielding six lacs, was assigned for the support of the Afghan troops, and the southern from Barrunwa to MalGd, rated at four lacs, was to be held by the Marhattas. On the treacherous mur der of Habfb Uliah Khan shortly afterwards in his camp at Garpedda, near Balasore, Raja Janoji became master of the whole province from Pergunnah Pattaspur to the Thaneh of Maliid. His arrangement was, to allot the whole of the lands yielding revenue, as Mnkaseh, for the support of his army, one Mehal being made over to the management of each sir dar. Things remained in this miserable state till 1163, when a fresh treaty was entered into, between the Marhattas and Aliverdi Khan, at the insti gation of the whole body of the Zemindars of Midnapore and neighbour ing districts, who, worn out by the repeated incursions of the Berar Mar hattas, offered to pay any sum, in addition to the Tashkhis Mokerreri or fixed revenue of Bengal, which might be agreed to as a composition for the Chout Sir Des Mukhi. Masalih ad Din was in consequence dis patched by the Court of Moorshedabad to Nagpore, with full powers to treat, and the following arrangements were determined on, \"The Chout of the three Subas was now settled at 12,00,000 annually. The Suba of Orissa from Pergunnah Pattaspur to Malud4o be managed by a Subadar appointed from Bengal, who should yearly pay the surplus revenue of that province, estimated at four lacs, to an agent of the Bhonsla stationed at Cuttack. The remaining eight lacs were to be made good from Moorshe dabad, Patna, &c. by Hundis or Bills of Exchange. The Marhatta armies forthwith to evacuate the province.\" On the conclusion ofthe treaty, Raja Janoji quitted Orissa, Mohammed Masalih ad Din received the appoint ment of Naib Subadar, and Sheo Bhat Santra, an eminent Gosain mer- chant, was named the agent for the Court of Berar to receive the four lacs from Cuttack, and to look after the annual remittance of the balance of the Chout from Moorshedabad."], [143, "OR CUTTACK. 137 Masalih ad Din laboured honestly and zealously to discharge the obli gations into which he had entered, and paid the four lacs for two years to the Nagpore agent, but at the end of that period he solicited permission to relinquish the government, stating forcibly his inability any longer to fulfil his engagements, owing to the declining resources of the country, and still more to the turbulent and unmanageable character of the Khandaits, or Military Zemindars of Orissa, who could be kept in no sort of subjecti on without the constant employment of a very large army in the field, the expense of maintaining which, engrossed the whole revenues. His state ments so fully convinced his master of the impolicy of any longer retaining Cuttack, burthened with the condition of paying four lacs annually from its revenues, that a proposal was tendered to the Raja of Nagpore, to undertake the management of the country through officers of his own appointment, in lieu ofthe stipulated payment, which being agreed to, the Suba of Cuttack, fell from that date under the sole undisputed government of the Berar Marhattas, A. D. 1755-6. v The administration of the Marhattas in Cuttack, was, as in every other part of their foreign conquests, fatal to the welfare of the people and the prosperity of the country, and exhibits a picture of misrule, anarchy, weak ness, rapacity, and violence combined, which makes one wonder bow society can have been kept together under so calamitous a tyranny. All the head offices of the district, as those of Subadar, Dewan, and the Kil ladarship of fort Barabatti, were openly bought and sold at Nagpore. lt frequently happened that appointments were given to two or three per sons at the same time, and still oftener the individuals in charge refused to retire under various pretexts. The different claimants, assembling their followers, would fight the most obstinate battles, and lay waste the coun try with their dissensions, before the right to succeed was settled.

Notwithstanding that large military bodies were posted all over the district, the Marhattas were quite unable to retain the Khandaits and their paiks in any sort of order. Those of the sea shore and the hills, not only laid the whole of the pergunnahs bordering upon them under regular contribution, but frequently the Paiks of several small killahs, combining together, advanced into the heart of the district, and committed the most ruinous depredations up to the very walls of Cuttack. Every year regularly after the Dassera, the Marhatta armies took the field under the Subadar in person, and advanced into some part of the Raj wara, to chastise some insolence, or to enforce the demand for tribute. When successful, the most sanguinary punishments and destructive ravages were inflicted, \u2014 but they were frequently defeated, and their weakness exposed, by the Paiks of killahs which now scarcely retain a name. Be sides, the continued marches and countermarches of a licentious disor derly Marhatta soldiery, in every direction across the province, Avere in themselves evils of no trifling magnitude. Matters improved a little to wards the close of the Marhatta period, during the long administration of Raja Ram Pundit ; but if the ryots were in a small degree better protected by his measures, he reduced, to the lowest stage of poverty and degrada tion, a powerful and important class, the hereditary Talukdars (now Ze mindars) ofthe Mogulbandi, who were ejected by him, very generally, from the management of their Taluks, and left with scarcely even the means of subsistence. As it would be impossible to render interesting to the general reader, the never varying detail of oppression, mismanagement, and suffering dis played by the Marhatta annals, I shall content myself, in my account of this fourth stage of Orissan history, with a brief enumeration of the successive Subadars who obtained authority, as far as any can be made out amidst"], [145, "OR CUTTACK. 139 the perpetual conflicts for power which disturbed the peace of the country, and with noticing a few events of general importance which mark that period. Tbe first and most energetic of the Marhatta Subadars, was Sheo Bhat Santia, who exercised a disputed and precarious authority for a period of about eight years from 1163 to 1171, and may be said to have been in full possession of the powers of government for about half that period. He made a settlement of the revenues ofthe province, nominally at 18,00,000 of Arcot Rupees, of which 14,00,000 were entered as regular land revenue (Bando basti Mulk,) and the remaining 4,00,000 as imposts under various heads. During his administration, a farther dismemberment took place of the territo ries ofthe Maharajas of Khurda. In 1167 Amli, Narain Deo, the famous Zemindar of Kimedy,* a descendant of the royal family of Orissa, who had before asserted his preferable title to the Khurda Raj, invaded that dis trict by way of Banpur, with the avowed intention of taking possession of it, and drove the reigning prince Bir Kisbore Deo before him. Unable to resist his powerful rival, the latter was thrown upon the dangerous ex pedient of claiming the assistance of the Marhattas, which was granted on condition of the payment of a large sum, to defray all expenses, in return. The aid of the Subadar proved effectual in clearing Khurda of the preten der's army, but the Raja being unable to discharge the money bargained for, he was obliged to mortgage or surrender temporarily for its liquidation, the best portion of his dominions, viz. the Mehals, Limbai, Rabeng, Pur sottem Chatter, &c. \u2014 in short, the whole country lying between the Dya river, the lake and the sea, with the tribute of the fourteen Rajas or Khandaits ofthe hills, still subject to fiis controul. The Marhattas were al lowed to appoint their own Amils, and having thus gained a footing in the * Mr. Grant in his Political Essay in the Northern Sircars says of this person: \"Kimedy, fifty miles N. E. by N. from the town of Cicacole, is the capital of another tributary but more accessible dependent principality vested in a Raja of the royal family of Orissa who actually bears the titular designation of that ancient house under the proper name of Gnjipati Deo, through the refractory imprudence of Na rain Deo, father of the present occupant, in opposing the Company's authority.'."], [146, "140 ON ORISSA PROPER tracts in question, they never afterwards relinquished possession. The be nefit of the acquisition seems doubtful, as the usurpation of Raheng, &c. involved them in a state of unceasing hostility with the Khurda Rajas, and the claim to levy the tribute of Rajwara brought them yearly into disputes and battles with the hill chiefs, in which, to say nothing of the ex penditure of blood and treasure, they were nearly as often worsted as they were successful. At the end of 1171 Amli, Sheo Bhat was violently expelled from bis go . vernment, by a powerful faction countenanced by the Court of Nagpore. Chimna Sahu and Udi Pura Gosain then exercised the powers of govern ment for a short time, until Bhawani Kaliia Pundit arrived in the province, with the senned or appointment of Subadar. The Ex-Subadar was not however of a character to relinquish his authority, without an obstinate struggle. He formed a powerful party amongst the Paiks of the eastern Rajwara, and for a length of time, disturbed the administration of his suc cessor by frequent contests and inroads. The Paiks of other killahs es poused the opposite side. Troops were poured in from all quarters to quell these ryots, and the frequent marches and countermarches of the armies of the government are credibly enough stated to have involved more serious evils to she whole of the fine Pergunnahs Hariharpur, Khandi, Jhanker, Deogaon, __c. than the disturbances they were sent to repress. Amidst all these troubles the excesses of the Kujeng, Kanka, and Rynto Paiks were ever conspipuous. The ferment excited amongst the Military Zemindars of Orissa and their adherents by these events, did not subside until many years afterwards. It does not appear how the career of their author and instigator finally terminated. Mr. La Motte gives the following brief com parative sketch of the character ofthe administrations of the rival Gover nors : \" Sheo Bhut plundered only his neighbours, but Bhawani Pundit committed depredations on his subjects and all parties alike,\" Bhawani Pundit was recalled about 1175 Amli, and Sambha Ji G^nps^"], [147, "OR CUTTACK. 141 appointed his successor. The settlement made by him is remembered, with bitterness, for its severity and harshness. He imposed many new cesses on the ryots, and exercised unusual rigour in scrutinizing and re suming lands held in Jagir, or free of rent, as the ayma, milk, kharidgi, mouajib, dagrai, &c. Those holders who were permitted to remain in pos session, were obliged to contribute to the necessities of the state, and were made over for a given number of years in Tenkhah or assignment to differ ent detachments of troops. After two years, a Mahajan, named Baba Ji Naik, received the appoint ment of Subadar, but his powers were disputed by the party in possession, and it was not till 1178 Amli, that he became firmly fixed in his seat. The district of Cuttack suffered grievously from the memorable famine, which desolated the lower provinces in 1769-70. Rice was not to be had for two sers per rupee, and many thousands of souls perished. To add to the ge neral distress, an alarming mutiny broke out amongst the troops, which was not quelled for many months. On the accession of Sabaji Bhonsla to the Mesned of Nagpore, Ma dhaji Hari was sent into Cuttack as governor. He threw his predecessor into confinement, and was occupied with arrangements for increasing the revenue of the country, when the accession of Madhaji Bhonsla occasioned a fresh change of administration. Baba Ji Naik once more received the senned of Subadari in 1182, and stepped from a jail to the highest rank in the province. After much intrigue and opposition however, the order for his appointment was recalled, and Madha Ji was allowed to remain in of fice. In 1183 another dreadful scarcity of grain was experienced in Cut tack. Rice was hardly to be purchased in the bazar of Cuttack at ten pans the katki ser. In the mofussil, paddy rose as high as twelve pans per glin \u2014 Kulti to 12-2 and Mandova 1-4. Its destructive effects are most strikingly evinced, by the recorded fact, that a remission of seven lacs was granted in the revenues of that year:"], [148, "ON ORISSA PROPER 142 Raja Ram Pundit, who had for many years filled the office of Deputy to the local \u00b0-overnor, and had taken a leading part in all tlie arrangements for the management of the interior, succeeded to the office of Subadar, about 1185 or 1186. His personal qualities and abilities were respectable, and, coupled with his extensive local knowledge, lent a character of digni ty and stability to bis administration, with which no preceding one had been invested. The chief measure ascribed to him, is that of setting aside all the hereditary Chowdris and (Vilaity) Canungos, in other w7ords the Talukdars of the Mogulbandi, and collecting the revenues through officers of his own appointing, either from the ryots direct, or through the agency ofthe head men of villages, where such existed. He was also the first go vernor who imposed a tribute on the Maharajas of Khurda. Raja Bir Kisbore Deo, after a long reign of forty-one years, fell into a state of furious insanity, and committed such frightful excesses, even to the extent of murdering four of his own children, th it a general outcry was raised against him throughout the country. The Marhattas did not neglect so favorable an opportunity of interfering. They secured the Raja's person, threw him into confinement in fort Barabatti, and refused to acknowledge his grand son Dirb Sinh Deo as successor, until they had obliged him to agree to the payment of a yearly tribute of Sa. Rs. 10,000. The expense of collecting this, must have been far greater than its value, for the Raja would never pay until compelled by the presence of a military force, and so low had the character and efficiency of the Marhatta Infantry sunk, that the Paiks of Khurda often presumed to measure their strength with them, even in these last days ofthe power of the Rajas of Orissa. Chimna Ji Bapu's visit to Cuttack, with a large army in 1781, A. D. is described as intended to enforce the claims of the Berar government against Bengal for arrears of Chout. Having can tooned his force at Kak kar, opposite to Cuttack, he sent on Raja Ram Pundit with Bissembher Pundit Vakil to Calcutta, who is said to have negotiated a treaty with Mr. Hastings, by which the English government agreed to the payment of \u00a77,00,000 Rs. on condition of all farther claims being relinquished."], [149, "OR CUTTACK. 143 On the retirement of Raja Ram Pundit in 1200 Amli, his son Sadasheo -Rao was appointed JNazim, and after him Chimna Bala. Affairs however fcvere managed chiefly by Inkaji Sukdeo, the Pher Nanis, and Bala JiKun- war, the commander of fort Barabatti, and principal military officer. In this state things were found in 1803, when the province was conquered by the English armies. The dominion ofthe Khurda Rajas was not finally extinguished till 1804, when a most unprovoked rising against the newly established English government, drew down upon Raja Mukund Deo the vengeance ofthe British power. He w7as driven from his fort, seized, sent a prisoner to Midnapore, and his remaining territory of Khurda was brought under the management of the British collectors. Since that period the proud but insignificant representatives of the Maharajas of Orissa, have been officially acknowledged only as private landholders ; but the liberal policy of government has conferred on them a sufficient pension, and an office of authority connected with the temple, in the enjoyment of which they pass their days in tranquil and, honorable retirement, within the sacred limits of Jagannath PGri. PART III. Religion, Antiquities, Temples, and Civil Architecture. UTCALA DESA which is believed or fabled to be itself so holy a region throughout its entire extent, contains four places of pilgrimage of peculiar sanctity called the Hara Khetr, the Vishnu or Pursottem Khetr, the Ar ka or Padma Khetr, and the Vijayi or Parvati Khetr, within the limits of which will be found nearly all that is curious and interesting in the Religi ous Antiquities ofthe province. s"], [150, "144 ON ORISSA PROPER mioImmct; The Hara khetr, sacred to Mahadeo under the titles of the Linga Raja Bhuvaneswara, and thence called by the vulgar Bhobaneser, contains seve ral very ancient and remarkable monuments of the native princes of the country, and their system of religious belief. At Balwanta, on the new road, sixteen miles from Cuttack, the attention of the traveller is attracted by a lofty massive tower of stone, rising from amidst the thickets which skirt the adjoining frontier of Khurda. A path leads through the woods towards this object of curiosity, and conducts, at the end of about six miles, to a gently swelling rocky elevation or Tangi formed of beds of the iron clay, on reaching which you find yourself, with astonishment, in the centre of a ruined city, consisting entirely of deserted and dismantled towers and temples sacred to the worship of Mahadeo, under the innumerable titles, which absurd legends or the fancy of his vo taries have assigned to that deity. From amidst the whole, the great Pagoda of the Ling Raj., or Lord of the Lingam, lifts its singular form, emi nently conspicuous both for size, loftiness, and the superior style of its ar chitecture. Bhobaneser was the site of a capital city sounded by Raja Lalat Indra Kesari the third of the princes bearing that surname, who reigned from A. D. 617 to A. D. 660. If! we are to judge of its extent and populous ness, during the period that it formed the seat of government of the Rajas of the Kesari Vansa, from the almost countless multitude of temples which are crowded within tbe sacred limits of the Panj Kosi, we might pro nounce it to have been, in the days of its splendour, one of the greatest ci ties which India ever saw.

The style, size, and decoration of these . singular buildings, add greatly to the wonder and interest of the scene. .

The exterior , surface of the buildings is in general adorned with the richest and most : elaborate sculptured ornament, and the ruined courts which surround j them, are strewed with a vast variety of curious relics, as bulls, lingams and j ; _\u25a0 - ' 1 pther symbols appropriate to the worship of Mahadeo, representations of S 2"], [154, "146 ON ORISSA PROPER Ganes-i, Hanuman, and various forms of Siva and Parvati, Durga, or Ka li, Carticeya the god of war with his peacock, the female or energy of tho same called Caumari, and the Narasinha and Batnan Avatars. The more finished temples have frequently large well polished slabs of the grey chlo rite slate, or pot stone, let into three of their sides, on which are sculptured, in alto relievo, nearly as large as life, some of the above personages, executed with no mean degree of skill and symmetry. Carved in the coarser stone of which the walls are constructed, one observes figures of Apsarasas or dancing nymphs in groups or solitary ; forms of Mahadeo and Parvati sit ting or standing together, generally in the most obscene attitudes ; repre sentations of warriors, horses, and elephants, engaged in combat or arranged in state processions : monsters resembling lions, with grim grotesque coun tenances, in various attitudes ; and groups of a peaceful character exhibit ing a Muni, or philosopher, imparting instruction to his pupils. The archi trave of the door-way of every temple in Orissa is ornamented with the nine figures in a sitting posture, called the Nava Graha or nine planets, of which seven represent the divinities presiding over the days of the week, and the two remaining ones the brahminical ascending and descending nodes* Rahu and Ketu. The forms and character of all the principal temples at Bhobuneser, and indeed throughout the province, being exactly similar, a more particular account of the plan and distribution of the great Pagoda will answer the purpose of a general description. The edifices which compose it, stand within a square area, enclosed by a substantial wall of stone, measuring six hundred feet on a side; which has its principal gateway guarded by two monstrous griffins, or winged lions, in a sitting posture, on the eastern face. About the centre, the great tower, Bara Dewal, or sanctuary, in which the images are always lodged, rises majestically to a height of one hundred and eighty feet. It is composed of a cluster of stone ribs, alternately flat and semicircular, eight principal and eight inferior ones, springing from a square ground plan, which towards the summit curve inwards, without,"], [155, "OR CUTTACK. 147 however, meeting. They bear, as it were on their shoulders, a cylindrical neck, and this, with the aid of brackets in the form of eight immense griffins or lions, supports the ornamented crest or head piece, shaped some what like a turban, which forms so distinguishing a feature in the temple architecture of Orissa. It consists of a huge solid circular slab, called the Amla Sila, from some fancied resemblance to the fruit ofthe Amlika (Phyl lanthus Euiblica), on which rests another circular ornament, in the form of a large inverted earthen dish, and thence indeed called the \" Dihi Bandhi.\" Sometimes the two ornaments are repeated. On the summit stands, either an urn, or the Chakra of Vishnu, according to circumstances, surmounted by an iron spike, to which pendants are attached on occasions of ceremony. The best illustration that can be given, of the shape and appearance of the generality of these towers, is to compare them to a medicine phial or com fit bottle with the stopper inserted, though the comparison does not d\u00b0 justice to the picturesque effect of the grand and massive building which I am now describing. From each face of the sanctuary, at different degrees of elevation, a huge monster projects to a distance of several feet, which has the body of a lion, but a most grotesque and unnatural countenance, resembling nothing in the catalogue of terrestrial animals. The figure on the eastern face is by far the largest, and it bas between its feet, an elephant of comparatively dimunitive size, on which it is trampling. This, it may be observed, is the common mode of representing the lion of Hindu my thology, one ofthe epithets of which is, Gaja Machida, or the destroyer of the elephant. The entrance to the tower lies through a large square ves tibule or antichamber, crowned with a pyramidal roof, and surmounted by the crest or series of ornaments above described, which joins on to the eastern face of the sanctuary, and rises to about three-fourths of its height. It is called the Jagamohana, or that which delights the world, because it is from thence that the idol is generally seen and worshipped by pilgrims. These two buildings form the essential and most sacred part of the tem ples of Orissa. Farther in advance of the Jagamohana, and connected with it by a sort of colonnade, is another square edifice of precisely the same"], [156, "148 ON ORISSA PROPER form, but smaller dimensions, which is called the Bhag Mandap, or apart ment in which the idol's food is served up, and afterwards distributed amongst the officiating priests, &c. The Court of the Ling Raj contains many other towers and temples apart from those already enumerated, in which a variety ofthe inferior deities, or less esteemed forms of the greater ones, are worshipped, and which add, by their style and number, to the ge neral grandeur of its appearance, but do not need a separate description. The whole are adorned with a profusion of sculptured work, consisting of elaborately wrought cornices, headings, arabesque and reticulated orna ments, and clusters of pilasters, with figures of men, animals, serpents and flowers intervening, arranged in such an infinite variety of devices, that the eye is absolutely bewildered in endeavouring to trace out any particular pattern or design. Amongst the ornaments on the great flat central ribs of the Bara Dewal, there is one peculiarly remarkable from its resemblance to some armorial, bearing or heraldic device. Mr. Erskine, 1 observe, has given the figure of a strikingly similar ornament in his account of the cave temples of Elephanta, vide Bombay Transactions, vol. i. page 217, and plate vi. The brahmins explain it to be a compound of the Gada, Padma, Sankh, and Chakra, or Mace, lotus, conch-shell and discus of Vishnu, and it would seem therefore rather out of place, in the conspicuous posi tion which it occupies on the walls ofthe Ling Raj ; but, it may be observed generally, of these edifices, that the sculptors have by no means confined themselves, in their choice of ornaments, to emblems peculiar to the deity of the place. The temple of the Ling Raj at Bhobaneser is both the finest monument of antiquity which the province contains, and likewise indisputably the most ancient. It took forty-three years to build, and local tradition a* well as the histories of the country, concur in fixing the date of its comple tion, as A. D. 657.

Nearly all but the great temple, have been long since completely deserted ; and the esta blishment kept up there, is on a very small and inadequate scale, under the patronage of the Khurda Rajas, whose ancestors granted all the lands and '\u2022.endowments, by which the brahmins attached to it now subsist. It is oc- casionally visited by the Bengalee pilgrims on their way to Jagannath, and every year, at the Sheo Ratri, a considerable collection of Desi, or country pilgrims, are gathered together under its walls, to hold a mela or fair. The ruins of two extensive palaces, belonging to the Rajas ofthe Kesa ri line, are shewn at or near Bhobaneser. There is likewise a very superb tank, lying north ofthe temple, called the Bindu Sagar, which forms a con spicuous object in the scenery ofthe place, and another, faced with stone, on the east, remarkable for its being bordered all round with rows of small antique looking temples, about thirty on a side, just large enough to contain the human figure in a sitting posture, in which sixty female as cetics, who had devoted themselves to the worship of Devi, are said to have lived \"and died many ages back. Amongst the curiosities ofthe environs, the attention of the visitor is generally directed to a huge figure of the lingam, forty feet in height, at the temple of Bhaskaresar Mahadeo. It is formed of a single shaft of sandstone, situated partly in a subterranean vault, and part rising into the centre of a great tower, of the usual form, which is said to have been built round this impure and degrading object of worship, after it had been set up and consecrated. About five miles west of Bhobaneser, near the village* of Jagmara, in the Char Sudhi Khandaiti of Khurda, and still within the limits ofthe khetr, a group of small hills occur, four in number, from one hundred and fifty to two hundred feet in height, which present many objects of interest and curio sity. These hills cabed severally the Udaya Giri, Dewal Giri, Nil Giri and Khand Giri, (by which latter name the spot is now generally design.it-"], [158, "150 ON ORISSA. PROPER ed,) are composed of a silicious sandstone of various colour and texture, and are all curiously perforated with small caves, disposed in two or three irregular stories. Each of the caves is large enough to contain from one to two human beings in a sitting posture. Some of them appear to be na tural cavities, slightly improved by the band of man; others have obviously been excavated altogether artificially ; and the whole are grotesquely carved and embellished. In one part, a projecting mass of rock has been cut into the form of a tiger's head, with the jaws widely distended, through whjch a passage lies into a small hole at the back secured by a wooden door, \u2014 the residence of a pious ascetic of the Vyshnavite sect. The ridiculous legend which the natives relate to explain the origin of these isolated hills, is, that they formerly constituted a part of the Himalaya, at which time they wero inhabited by numerous Rishis, who dug the caves now found in them. They were taken up bodily, ascetics and all, by Mahabir Hanuman, with other masses of rock, to build the bridge of Rama, but, by some accident, were al lowed to drop in their passage through the air, vihen they alighted in their present position. I am almost tempted to add, as a curious coincidence, that they are the only real sandstone hills found in this part of the country ; but the geology ofthe district has not been sufficiently explored, to warrant my advancing such an assertion positively. The summit of the highest rock, is crowned by a neat stone temple of modern construction, sacred to the worship of Parasnath ; all around, and in the neighbourhood of which, are strewed a quantity of images of the Nirvanas, or naked figures worshipped by the Jain sect, executed chiefly in the grey chlorite slate rock. At the back of these temples, a highly remark able terrace is shewn, called the Deo Sabha, or assembly of the gods, which is covered with numberless antique-looking stone pillars or temples in mi niature, some standing, others lying on the ground, about two or three feet long, having, on each of the four sides, a figure ofthe naked Jain deity rudely sculptured Ihe place is still frequented by the Jain or Parwar merchants of Cuttack, who assemble here in numbers, once every year, to hold a fes tival of their religion."], [159, "INSCRIPTION ON THE KHUNDIC.IREE ROCK RHONDA y/ur^U/^y^ /2H^A /0\u00a3jT/ic//ts"], [160, ""], [161, "OR CUTTACK. 151 A short way up the Ldaya Giri hill, the Nour or palace of the famous Ra ja Lalat Indra Kesari, is pointed out as the chief curiosity of the place. It consists of a sort of open court formed by a perpendicular face of sandstone rock, about forty feet in height, with shoulders ofthe same projecting on ei ther side. Rows of small chambers have been excavated in each face, ar ranged in two stories, and divided by a projecting terrace. Both the exte rior surface and the inner walls of the chambers are decorated with cornices, pilasters, figures, and various devices, very rudely sculptured, and the whole exhibits a faint and humble resemblance, in miniature, to the celebrated ca vern temples in the south-west of India. The rude and miserable apart ments of the palace, are now occupied by byragis and mendicants of differ ent sects, who state that the place bad its origin in the time of Buddha, and that it was last inhabited by the Rani of the famous Raja Lalat Indra Kesari, a favourer ofthe Buddhist religion. Many odd fables are related of the scrapes into which she was led by her heretical notions, and of the way in which her conversion to tlie orthodox system of worship was at last effected. Farther up the same hill, on the overhanging brow of a large cavern, one meets with an ancient inscription cut out ofthe sandstone rock, in the ve ry identical character which occurs on the pillars at Delhi, and which as yet has been only very partially decyphered. Having been enabled to ob tain an exact facsimile of this interesting monument by the assistance of Colonel Mackenzie, whom I conducted to the spot in 1820, I shall an nex the same to the Appendix of this paper. There are I think two eminently remarkable circumstances connected with the character used in the above inscription. The first is the close resemblance of some of the letters to these of the Greek alphabet, and the second the occur rence of it on sundry ancient monuments situated in widely distant quar ters of India.

With regard to the second, any reader who will take the trouble of comparing the Khandgiri inscription with that on Firoz Shah's Lat at Delhi, on the column at Allahabad, on the Lat of Bhim Sen, in Sarun, a part of the Elephanta, and a part of tho Ellora inscriptions, will find that the characters are identically the same. A portion ofthe Ellore and Salsette inscription written in the above cha racter, has been decyphered by the learning and ingenuity of Major Wil ford, aided by the discovery of a key to the unravelling of ancient inscrip tions in the possession of a learned brahmin, vide the eleventh article of vol. v.

The solution attempted by the Pere Trieffenthaler, does not seem to me to merit any attention.* The natives ofthe district can give no explanation what ever on the subject. The brahmins refer the inscription with shuddering and disgust, to the Budh Ka Amel, or time when the Buddhist doctrines prevailed, and are reluctant even to speak on the subject. I have in vain also applied to the Jains ofthe district for an explanation. I cannot how ever divest myself of the notion that the character has. some connection with the ancient Pracrit, and considering that it occurs in a spot for many ages consecrated to the worship of Parasnath, which the brahmins are pleas ed to confound with the Buddhist religion, and that the figure or. character. - * He savs, speaking ofPiroz Slial.'s pillar; Apres avoir beaucoap et leng temps cherch\u00a3 j&itrouvfe la signification de ces caracieres.

The present edifice was completed A D. 1198 at a cost of from forty to fifty lacs of Rupees, under the superintendence of Param Hans Bajpoi, the minister of Raja Anang Bhim Deo, who was unquestionably the most illustrious of all the Gajapati princes of Orissa, and it seems unaccountable that in an age when the architects obviously possessed some taste and skill, and were in most cases particularly lavish in their use of sculptured ornament, so little pains should have been taken with the decoration and finishing of this sa- cred and stupendous edifice.

The material used for the construction of the tem ple is chiefly the coarse granite, resembling sandstone, found abundantly in the southern part of Cuttack. The following is a sketch of the plan of it. The edifices composing and connected with the temple which are very numerous, stand in a square area enclosed by a lofty stone wall, mea suring about six hundred and fifty feet on a side. A broad flight of twenty-two steps leads from the Sinh Darwazeh or principal gate of en trance, on the east, to a terrace twenty feet in height, enclosed by a second wall four hundred and forty-five feet square, on which occurs first the apart ment called the Bhog Mandap. In a line, and connected with it by a sort of low portico (the Mukt Mandap), is the great antichamber of the tem ple called the Jagmohan, which adjoins and opens into the tower or sanc tuary. The tower itself rises to a height of about one hundred and eighty feet from the terrace, or two hundred from the ground. The ground plan is a square measuring thirty feet on a side. Most of the other principal deities of the Hindoo Pantheon have temples at this place situated be tween the two enclosures. The eastern gate is flanked and guarded by co lossal figures of lions, or more properly griffins, in a sitting posture, and by smaller images ofthe mythological porters Jaya and Vijaya resting on their clubs, sculptured on the side posts. In front stands a column of dark coloured basalt, with a base of the mineral resembling pot-stone, remarka ble for its light and elegant appearance and the beauty of its proportions, which supports a figure of the monkey-god Hanuman. One might guess that this is the work of artists of a different class and \u00e6ra from those who raised the temple of Jagannath, and the fact is really so, it having been brought from the famous, but now deserted, temple ofthe sun at Kanarak, about sixty years ago, by a brahmachari inhabitant of Puri, of great wealth and influence. Some ingenious speculations have been hazarded upon the origin and meaning of the worship of Jagannath and the causes ofthe peculiar sanc tity of the place, but amidst the conflicting and contradictory legends and"], [165, "OR CUTTACK. 155 traditions which prevail, it seems scarcely possible to arrive at any satisfac tory conclusion on the subject. The accounts given in the writings ofthe Hindus, more especially the Kapila Sanhita and the Khetr Mahatmya of the temple, are simply as follows, divested ofthe loads of declamation and repetition which embarrass the perusal of them. From the beginning of all things until the expiration of the first half of the age of Brahma, Parames.-. wara, Sri Bhagwan, or Jagannath, in other words Vishnu, dwelt on the Ni lachal in Utkala Desa, in the form of Nil Madhava. The fame of this form of the deity having reached the Court of lndradyumna, Maharaja of Avanti or Oujein, an eminently devout and pious prince in the Satya Yuga, he con ceived a desire to perform worship at the sacred shrine, and accordingly set out on a journey to Orissa with a large army, after having first dispatched a brahmin to make inquiry. Just as he reached the spot on the expiration of a three months' journey, it was reported to him that the image of Nil Ma dhava had disappeared from the face of the earth. The Raja was over whelmed with disappointment at this intelligence, and fell into a state of the deepest melancholy and affliction until comforted in a dream by the deity, who informed him that although he had abandoned his former shape, he would soon reappear again, (or that a fresh Avatar would take place), in a still more sacred form, that of the Daru Brahm which would remain to all ages. Shortly after, the Maharaja was apprized that a Daru,* or log of wood of the Nim tree (Melia Azadirachta) was to be seen floating to the shores of Pursottem Chetr from the quarter of the Sitadwip island, adorn ed with the Sankha, Gada, Padma, Chakr, or several emblems of Vish nu, viz. the conch shell, mace, lotus and discus, and bearing a most divine and beautiful appearance. Transported with joy the pious prince ran to the sea shore, embraced the sacred log, which he was satisfied from the above symptoms must be a real form of Vishnu, and proceeded to de posit it with great ceremony in a consecrated enclosure. He then through * Some accounts say that tbe Maharaja had first to perform a hundred thousand Aswa Med'h Jag\\a> or sacrifices oi' tie hoise before favored with a view of this choice form of the deity, but as usual witli every Hindu tabie there is prodigious discrepancy in the several versioas of it."], [166, "156 ON ORISSA PROPER the advice of Narad Muni, who had accompanied him, obtained the aid of Visvakerma, the architect of the gods, to arrange the image in its proper form. At the first blow ofthe sacred axe ofthe Hindu Vulcan, the log split of itself into the four-fold image or Chatur Murti. A little colouring only was necessary to complete them, and they then became recognized as Sri Krish na or Jagannath distinguished by its black hue, Baldeo, a form of Siva, of a white colour, Subhadra, the sister of these brothers of the colour of saft-on, and a round staff or pillar with the cbakra impressed on each end called Sudersan. The Raja's next care was to erect a temple and to esta blish the worship on a suitable scale of splendour. On the great day when all was ready for consecrating the temple, Brahma himself, and the whole company of the deities of Indra's court, came down from heaven on their several appropriate vehicles to offer up worship at the shrine of the lord oi the universe, which, say the Urias, has since that period, and especially in the Kali yuga, maintained a rank and celebrity such as even Kasi, Bindra ban, or Se.tu Band Rameswar, cannot boast off The Hindus of Orissa endeavour, though with vastly little foundation, to ascribe to the worship of Jagannath a more spiritual character than is ge- nerally claimed for their superstition elsewhere. They refer to the com- mon title of the divinity ofthe place, which implies the Brahma or Divine spirit that pervades and sustains the universe, and are fond of quoting a passage in the legendary account of the temple which runs thus, \" Hear now the truth of the Daru Avatar,\" (the appearance of the deity in the form of the Nim tree log,) \" What part ofthe universe is there which the divine spirit does not pervade? In every place it exults and sports in a different form. In the heaven of Brahma it is Brahma; at Kylas it is Ma- hadeo ; in the upper world it is Indra ; on the face ofthe earth it is to be found in all the most renowned Khe frs, at Baddrika as Badrinath ; at Brindaban and Dwaraka as Krishen; at Ayodhya (Oude) in another shape ; but in the Khetr of Pursottem it appears in its true and most sacred form.\" The brahmins also have a practice of dressing up the figure of Sri Jeo"], [167, "OR CUTTACK. 157 (lit. tbe holy spirit) in a eostnme appropriate to the occasion, to represent the principal deities, on the occurrence of the yearly festivals held in ho nor of each, which are termed the different Bhues, or Phases, ofthe Tha kur. Thus at the Ram Navami, the great image assumes the dress and character of Rama ; at the Janam Ashtami, that of Krishen; at the Kjili Puja, that of Kali ; when the Narsinha Avatar is celebrated, that of Nar sinh ; when the Banian Avatar, that of tlie mighty dwarf. This would seem to evince some symptoms of a belief that in offering up worship to Jagannath, his votaries do not confine their adoration to any particular dei ty, but adore the whole host ofthe Hindu heaven, or rather the spirit which animates them, whilst at other Khetrs the divinity of the place alone is wor shipped. Mr. Paterson's hypothesis refers the wrorship now under consi deration to the adoration of the mystical syllable, A, U, M, coalescing into Om, and is certainly the most ingenious and plausible that has been suggested, but goes far beyond the knowledge or comprehension of the most learned or intellectual ofthe present day. All the explanation which the more intelligent brahmins can or will afford on the subject, is, that they worship at Jagannath, Bhagwan or the supreme spirit itself, and not any subordinate deity ; that the images are shapeless, because the Vedas have declared that the deity has no particular form ; and that they have received their present grotesque and hideous countenances, with the view to terrify men into being good. The same fancy which has invested the Khetr of Ja gannath with superior sanctity, is the cause, of course, ofthe unusual virtue ascribed to the Mahaprasad, or food cooked for the deity, and consecrat ed by being placed before the images. The Khetr Mahatmya says, that Ma ha Lukshmf herself prepares and tastes it. He who eats it is absolved from the four cardinal sins ofthe Hindu faith, viz. killing a cow, killing a brahmin, drinking spirits, and committing adultery with the female of a Guru or spi ritual pastor. So great is its virtue that it cannot be polluted by tbe touch ofthe very lowest caste, and the leavings even of a dog are to be carefully taken up and made use of. The most tremendous and inexpiable of all crimes, is to handle and eat the Mahaprasad, without a proper feeling of reverence."], [168, "ON ORISSA PROPER 158 Without going into any profound speculation as to the origin, nature, and meaning of the worship of Jagannath, there is one cause sufficiently ob vious why all sects should here unite in harmony in the performance of tbeir religious ceremonies, viz. that the temple instead of being consecrated ex clusively to some form of the deity Vishnu alone, is in fact occupied, in joint tenancy, by forms of three ofthe most revered divinities of the Hindu faith. Balbhadra or Baldeo, (Balarama,) the elder brother, wbo is treated with the greatest respect, though not so popular as his black relation, is clearly identified with Mahadeo, both by his white colour, and the figure of the serpent Shesha or Ananta* which forms a hood over the back part of his head ; and Subhadra is esteemed a form of Devi or Kali, the female energy of the above. The precedence is always given to the elder brother ; he has a rath or chariot of equal size with that of Jagannath, and altogether the veneration paid to him is quite sufficient to conciliate the votaries of Siva, who are the only violent or bigoted sectaries. All other deities too are allowed to occupy niches or temples within the precincts of the great Pagoda, and are treated with so much respect, that the most obstinate sec tary could not with any decency or consistency refuse to join in the gene ral worship of the place. The legend above quoted by me regarding the establishment of the wor ship of Jagannath, does not provide for or explain the sacred deposit which popular belief, sanctioned by the brahmins, places in the belly of the image. Some conjecture it to be a bone of Krishna, but how it came there is not explained. As the image has been often remade ofthe wood ofthe Nim tree, it seems not improbable that it may be a relic of the old original idol which is thus religiously preserved. With regard to the Raja Indradyum na, he is mentioned by Wilford as famous in the fabulous legends relat ing to the Sweta Dwipa or White Islands ofthe west. The memory of his visit to Puri has been perpetuated, independently of the temple legends, by * Both these words in Wilson's Sancrit Dictionary are explained lo mean a strpent and a nam. of Baladcya."], [169, "OR CUTTACK. 159 a- superb tank which bears his name. Either the author of the Ayin Acberi, or his translator, has confounded things together, in calling him Raja Indra Dummun of Nilkurpurbut (Nilgiri Parvat) instead of stating that he visited the sand hills at Puri called by that name in the Hindu writings. The assertion also of Abulfazl that the image of Jagannath is made of sandal wood, is founded apparently on some confusion between the material appropriated to that purpose, and a bar of timber used for clos ing tbe entrance of the temple during tlie Chandan Jatra, thence called the .Chand an Daru or sandal wood. The principal ceremonies of the temple of Jagannath, its festivals, the rules for the collection of the tax, and general system of management, have been described with sufficient accuracy and detail by Hamilton. The monstrous idols of the place may be seen daily, with few exceptions, seat ed on their Sinhasan, or throne, within the sanctuary, but they are pub licly exposed to view on two occasions only in the year, the Asnan and the Rath Jatras. At the Asnan or festival ofthe bath, Jagannath and his \"brother, after undergoing certain ablutions, assume what is called the Ga nesh Bhues or form of the elephant-headed god, to represent which the images are dressed up with an appropriate mask. Thus arrayed, they are placed on a high terrace overlooking the outer wall of the temple, surround ed by crowds of priests who fan them to drive away the flies, whilst the multitude below gaze in stupid admiration. At the Rath Jatra, tlie images, as is well knovVn, are indulged with an air ing on their cars and a visit to tbe god's country house, a mile and a half distant, na-ned the Goondicha Nour, after the Rani of Maharaja Indra dyumna who founded the worship. The display which takes place on this occasion has been often .before described, but some brief notice of it will naturally be expected in a paper treating professedly of Cuttack. On the appointed day, after various prayers and ceremonies have been v"], [170, "160 ON ORISSA PROPER gone through within the temple, the four images are brought from their throne to the outside of the Lion gate\u2014 not with decency and reverence,. seated on a litter or vehicle adapted to such an occasion \u2014 but a common cord being fastened round their necks, certain priests to whom the duty appertains, drag them down the steps and through the mud, whilst others keep the figures erect and help their movements by shoving them from be- hind, in the most indifferent and unceremonious manner, as if they thought tbe whole business a good jske. In this way the monstrous idols rocking and pitching along through the crowd, until they reach the cars which they are made to ascend by a similar process up an inclined plat- form reaching from the stage ofthe machine to the ground. On the other hand, a powerful sentiment of religious enthusiasm pervades the admiring multitude of pilgrims assembled without, when the beloved images first make their appearance through the gate. They welcome them with the loudest shouts of joyful recognition and stunning cries of Jye Jagannath, victory to Jagannath; and when the monster Jagannath himself, the most hideous of all the figures, is dragged forth the last in order, the air is rent with plaudits and acclamations. These celebrated idols are nothing more than wooden busts about six feet in height, fashioned into a rude resem- blance ofthe human head resting on a sort of pedestal. They are painted white, yellow, and black respectively, with frightfully grim and distorted countenances, and are decorated with a head dress of different colored cloths shaped something like a helmet. The two brothers have arms pro jecting horizontally forward from the ears. The sister is entirely devoid of even that approximation to the human form.

Tlie Devi or Subhadra Rath called Padma Dhaj is forty feet high, the platform thirty, one square and fourteen wheels of six and a half feet diameter."], [171, "OR CUTTACK. 161 house of the British Government, the splendour and gorgeous effect of which compensate in a great measure for other deficiencies of decoration. After the images have been safely lodged in their vehicles, a box is brought forth containing the golden or gilded (eet, hands, and ears of the great idol, which are fixed on the proper parts with due ceremony, and a scarlet tears is carefully arranged round the lowerpart ofthe body or pedestal. Thus equipped and decorated, it is worshipped in much pomp and state by tbe Raja of Khurda, who performs before it the ceremony of the Chandalo, or sweeping, with a richly ornamented broom. At about this period of the festival, bands of villagers enter the crowd dancing and shouting, with mu- sic playing before and behind, each carrying in his band a branch of a tree. They are the inhabitants of the neighbouring Pergunnahs, Rahefig, Lim- bai, &c. called Kalabetiahs, whose peculiar duty and privilege it is, con- jointly with the inhabitants of Puri, to drag the Raths. On reaching the cars, they take their station close to them, and soon as the pro|>er signal has been given, they set tbe example to the multitudes assembled, by seiz- ing on the cables, when all advance forwards a few yards, hauling along generally two ofthe Raths at a time. Ihe joy and shouts ofthe crowd on their first movement, the creaking sound of the wheels as these ponderous machines roll along, the clatter of hundreds of harsh sounding instru- ments, and the general appearance of so immense a moving mass of human beings, produce, it must be acknowledged, an impressive, astounding, and somewhat picturesque effect, whilst the novelty of the scene lasts, though the contemplation of it cannot fail of exeiting the strongest sensations of pain and disgust in the mind of every Christian spectator. At each pause, the Dytahs or Charioteers of the god advance forwards to a projecting part of the stage, with wands in their hands, and throwing themselves into a variety of wild and frantic postures, address some fable or series of jokes to tbe multitude, who grunt a sort of response at the proper intervals. Of ten their speeches and actions are grossly and indescribably indecent. The address generally closes with some peculiarly piquant allusion, when U 2"], [172, "ON ORISSA PROPER 162 the gratified mob raise a loud shout as their final response, and all rush. forward with the cables. The progress made varies greatly according to the state of the roads, the care used in keeping the Raths iij a proper di rection, the zeal and number of the pilgrims, and the will ofthe priests or as they say of the god, the former having some, method of choking the wheels, and thereby preventing the movement ofthe cars, notwithstanding the utmost efforts of the credulous multitude to advance forwards. Gene rally from two to three days are consumed in reaching the Gondicha Nour, where the images are taken out. Before even this period has elapsed, the curiosity and enthusiasm ofthe pilgrims have nearly quite evaporated, they steal off in numbers, and leave Sri Jeo to get back to the temple as he may. Without indeed the aid of the villagers before described, and of the population of Puri who hold their ground free of rent on condition of per forming this service to the deity, the Raths would now-a-days infallibly stick always at the Gondicha Nour. Even the god's own proper servants will not labor zealously and effectually without the interposition of autho rity, and I imagine the ceremony would soon cease to be conducted on its present scale and footing, if the institution were left entirely to its fate and, to its own resources, by the officers of tlie British Government. That excess of fanaticism which formerly prompted the pilgrims to court death by throwing themselves in crowds under the wheels ofthe car of Ja gannath, has happily long ceased to actuate the worshippers of the present day. During four years that I have witnessed the ceremony, three cases only of this revolting species of immolation have occurred, one of which I may observe is doubtful and should probably be ascribed to accident ; in the other two instances the victims had long been suffering from some excruciating complaints, and chose this method of ridding themselves of the burthen of life, in preference to other modes of suicide so prevalent with the lower orders under similar circumstances.

The latest returns show tbe whole number of victims who destroy themselves annually in the above revolting manner, to average at from twenty to thirty for the entire district of Cuttack. The Arka or Padam Khetr is distinguished by its containing the remains of the celebrated temple ofthe sun, called in our charts the black Pagoda which is situated amidst the sand bills ofthe sea shore, near the site of the old village of Kanarak, eighteen miles north of Jagannath Puri. The Jag mohan or antichamber is the only part of the building which exists in to lerably good preservation. The great tower has been shattered and thrown down by some extraordinary force, either of an earthquake or light ning, and in its fall seems to have injured that side of the adjoining edifice wdiich looks towards it. A small section however still remains standing, about one hundred and twenty feet in height, which viewed from a dis tance gives to tbe ruin a singular appearance, something resembling that of a ship under sail. The whole of the outer enclosures of the temple have long since disappeared, and nothing is left of the edifice called the Bbog Mandap but a heap of ruin, completely buried under a sand hill. The black Pagoda even in its present imperfect and dilapidated con dition, presents a highly curious and beautiful specimen of the ancient Hindu temple architecture, and as it has long been completely deserted, we may here study at leisure and without interruption, some ofthe most _triking peculiarities of that style. The deity of the place is called by the vulgar Sooruj Deo (Surya), and at full length, Chunder Sooruj Birinji INaiayari. The origin of the wor ship of a divinity so little honored in India generally speaking, is ascribed to Samba, the son of Krishna, who having been afflicted with leprosy and banished from his father's Court at Dwarka, as a punishment for acciden-"], [175, "OR CUi TACK. 165 tally looking in upon the nymphs of the palace whilst sporting naked in the water, was cured at this spot by the Sun, to whose service he in grati tude raised a temple. The present edifice it is well known was built by Raja Langora Narsinh Deo, A. D. 1241, under the superintendence of his minister Shibai Sautra. I cannot discover any authority for the asser tion ofthe author ofthe Ayin Acberi, that the entire revenue of twelve years was expended on the work, but doubtless the cost was very serious com pared with the state of the Raja's treasury. The natives of the neighbour ing villages have a strange fable to account for its desertion. They relate that a Kumbha Pat har or loadstone, of immense size, was formerly lodged on the summit ofthe great tower, which had the effect of drawing ashore all vessels passing near the coast. The inconvenience of this was so much felt, that about two centuries since, in the Mogul time, the crew of a ship landed at a distance and stealing down the coast, attacked the temple, scaled the tower, and carried off the loadstone. The priests alarmed at this violation of the sanctity of the place, removed the image of the god with all his paraphernalia to Puri, where they have ever since remained, and from that date the temple became deserted and went rapidly to ruin. As above intimated, the origin of its dilapidation may obviously be ascrib ed either to an earthquake or to lightning, but many causes have concur red to accelerate the progress of destruction, when once a beginning had been made. To say nothing of the effects of weather on a deserted build ing, and of the vegetation that always takes root under such circumstances, it is clear that much injury has been done by the inhabitants of the neigh bourhood, in forcing out the iron clamps which held the stones together, for the sake of the metal ; and it is well known that the officers of the Marhatta government actually beat down a part of the walls, to procure materials for building some insignificant temples at Puri. Abulfazl's quaint, but lively and picturesque, description of the tem ple of the Sun, is of rourse familiar to those who have perused the Ayin Ac \u25a0beri with attention. Although however it affords a good general idea of"], [176, "166 ON ORISSA PROPER the character of the building, it is strangely inaccurate in respect to mea surements, no less than in the description of the emblems and ornaments which embellish it. Without noticing its several errors in detail, I shall first insert the description above alluded to, and then offer an account ofthe place as it appears to the visitor in the nineteenth century. The author of the Ayin Acberi observes, (vide Gladwin's translation,) \" Near to Jagannath is the temple ofthe sun, in the erecting of which, was \" expended the whole revenue of Orissa for twelve years. No one can \" behold this immense edifice without being struck with amazement. The \" wall which surrounds the whole is one hundred and fifty cubits high \" and nineteen cubits thick. There are three entrances to it. At the east * ern gate there are two very fine figures of elephants, each with a man \"upon his trunk. To the west are two surprizing figures of horsemen \" completely armed, and over the northern gate are carved two lions who \" having killed two elephants, are sitting upon them. In the front of the gate \" is a pillar of black stone of an octagonal form fifty cubits high. There \" are nine flights of steps, after ascending which, you come into an exten \" sive enclosure where you discover a large dome constructed of stone up^ \" on which are carved the sun and stars and round them is a border where \"are represented a variety of human figures, expressing the different pas sions of the mind, some kneeling, others prostrated with their faces up \" on the earth, together with minstrels, and a number of strange and won \" derful animals, such as never existed but in imagination. This is said \"to be a work of 730 years antiquity. Raja Nursingh Deo finished this \" building, thereby erecting for himself a lasting monument of fame. There \" are twenty-eight other temples belonging to this pagoda, six before the \" northern gate, and twenty-two without the enclosure, and they are all \"reported to have performed miracles.\" The wall which formed the outer enclosure may have measured about 250 yards on a side ; within this was a second enclosure having three en hances called the Asm or horse, the Hast i or eLephant, and the Sinha or"], [177, ". CtefaemM' ay~%zasz?i<?z<zrf\u00a3"], [178, ""], [179, "OR CUTTACK. 167 Lion gate, from the colossal figures of those animals, which surmounted the several side posts. The horses and elephants on the north and south, have long since been precipitated from their bases, but the lions, or rather griffins, still retain the attitude and position assigned to them by Abulfazl, except that they are standing, instead of sitting, on the bodies of elephants, and have one paw lifted in the act of striking. Fronting the Sinh gate, stood the beautiful polygonal column, formed of a single shaft of black basalt, which now adorns the entrance ofthe Puri temple. It supported, at that time, the appropriate emblem of Aruna, the charioteer of the sun, \u25a0 which has since given place to Hanuman, and measures about thirty-three feet in height, instead of fifty cubits. The accompanying drawing will give a better idea, than the most elaborate description, of its chaste appear ance and elegant proportions. Khambahs or columns of a similar descrip tion, though far inferior in point of style and execution, are frequently met with in front of the more ancient temples of Orissa. They are well known to the Hindu antiquary, under the name of \" Jaya Stambhas or Pil lars of Victory,\" though what their precise use or object is, has not been explained. From the eastern gate of the inner enclosure, a flight of ruined steps leads to the only tolerably perfect part of the building now remaining, called the Jagmohan, or Antichamber of the Sanctuary. No one, certainly, can be hold the massive beams of iron and the prodigious blocks of stone used in the construction of this edifice, without being struck with amazement. The ground plan is a square, measuring sixty feet on a side, or, if we take in the four projecting door-ways, it should rather be called a cross. The walls rise to a height of sixty feet, and have in some parts the unusual thickness of twenty feet. They support a noble and curiously constructed pyramidal roof, the stones composing which overhang each other, in the manner of inverted stairs, until they approach near enough towards the summit to support iron beams laid across, on which rests a prodigious v"], [180, "168 ON ORISSA PROPER mass of solid masonry, forming the bead-piece or crowning ornament. The slope measures about seventy-two feet, and perpendicular height, sixty- three or sixty-four. The total altitude of the building, from the floor to the summit, is about one hundred feet or a little more. The outside ofthe roof is divided into three tiers of steps, formed by slabs projecting curiously from the body ofthe building, which are all bordered with a very fine pat- tern of elephants, birds, and various figures executed with considerable skill and spirit. Each of the terraces between the tiers, is decorated with statues, placed at intervals, nearly as large as life. On the two lower ones, are figures of nymphs and heavenly choristers, dancing and playing upon sundry instruments, but with countenances expressing very little passion or feeling of any kind. The third story has the usual mythological animals, more nearly resembling lions than any thing else, which suppoit on their shoulders the outer rim of the huge turban-shaped ornament on the top; besides these, there is a four-headed statue over each of the door- ways, the crowns and sceptres of which, mark them as intended to represent the ma jesty of Brahma. Each face of the Jagmohan has a fine Rectangular door- way,. with a porch projecting considerably beyond and lined with superb slabs of the grey indu rated chlorite, many of which measure fifteen feet high by a breadth of six or eight feet. The architrave of the door- way, as well as the roof of the pas sage leading to the interior, and an enormous mass of masonry resting upon it, are supported by nine iron beams, nearly a foot square hy twelve or eighteen long, which are laid across the side ways in the most rude and inartificial manner. The whole fabric is held together by clamps of the same metal, and there is no appearance of any cement having been made use of. If the style ofthe black Pagoda hetrays, in the rude and clumsy expedi ents apparent in its construction, a primitive state of some of the arts, and a deficiency of architectural skill, at the period of its erection, one cannot hut wonder at the ease w7ith which the architects seem to have wielded"], [181, ""], [182, ""], [183, "OR CUTTACK. 169 and managed the cumbersome masses of iron and stone, used for the work, in an age when so little aid was to be derived from any mechanical inven tions ; and it must be allowed that there is an air of elegance, combined with massiveness, in the whole structure, which entitles it to no small share of admiration. There is much, however, about this remarkable building, which it is difficult either to describe or comprehend. The interior is sill ed, to a height of several feet, with large blocks of stone, which seem to have fallen from above, and what purpose they answered, in their former situa tion, is a matter of great doubt and discussion. Amongst the heap are to be seen, two iron beams, measuring twenty-one feet in length by about eight inches square, absolutely crushed beneath a superincumbent mass of stone, many of the blocks composing which, measure fifteen and sixteen feet in length, by about six feet of depth and two or three of thickness. It seems pro bable that they formed part of an inner or false roof, but neither is it easy to assign any precise place for such a ceiling, nor can one divine the motive or object of elevating such prodigious blocks of stone to a great height in the building, when lighter materials would have been so much better adapt ed to the work. The exterior of the side walls, as of the roof, is loaded with a profusion of the richest sculptured ornaments. A remarkably handsonie cornice or bor der occupies the upper part, all round, for a depth of several feet. Below this, the surface is divided by another fine cornice, into two tiers of compart ments, parted off into niches by clusters of pilasters, in each of which are placed figures of men and animals, resting on pedestals with a sort of ca nopy overhead. The human figures are generally male and female, in the most lewd and obscene attitudes, frequently in the very act of sexual inter course. Amongst the animals, the commonest representation is that of a lion rampant, treading on an elephant or a prostrate human figure. Ge nerally speaking, the style and execution of the larger figures, are rude and coarse, whilst the smaller ones display often much beauty and grace, but V2"], [184, "ON ORISSA PROPER 170 it should be observed that the whole have suffered materially, from the cor rosion or decomposition of the stone, of which the building is chiefly com posed, viz. the coarse red granite ofthe province, which is singularly liable to decay, from exposure to the weather. The skill and labor of the best artists, seem to have been reserved for the finely polished slabs of chlorite, which line and decorate the outer faces of the door- ways. The whole of the sculpture on these figures, comprizing men and animals, foliage, and arabesque patterns, is executed with a de- gree of taste, propriety, and freedom, which would stand a comparison with some of our best specimens of Gothic architectural ornament. The work- manship remains, too, as perfect, as if it bad just come from under the chis- sel of the sculptor, owing to the extreme hardness and durability ofthe stone. A triangular niche, over each door-way, was once filled with a figure .out in alto relievo, emblematic ofthe deity of the place, being that of a youth in a sitting posture, holding in each hand a stalk ofthe true Lotus or Ne- lumbium speciosum, the expanded flowers of which are turned towards him. Each architrave has, as usual, the Nava Graha, or nine brahminical planets, very finely sculptured in alto relievo. Five of them are well pro- portioned figures of men, with mdd and pleasing countenances, crowned with high pointed caps and seated cross-legged on the Padma (Nelumbium speciosum), engaged in religious meditation \u2014 one hand bears a vessel of water, and the fingers of the other are counting over the beads of a rosary, which hangs suspended. The form of the planet which presides over Thursday, (Vrihaspati or Jupiter,) is distinguished from the others by a flowing majestic beard. Friday, or Venus, is a youthful female, with a plump well rounded figure. Ketn, the descending node, is a triton whose body ends in the tail of a fish or dragon ; and Rahu, or the ascending node, a monster, all head and shoulders, with a grinning grotesque countenance, frizly hair dressed like a full blown wig, and one immense canine tooth pro jecting from the upper jaw ; in one hand he holds a hatchet, and in the other # fragment oi the moon. These are doubtless the \" sun and stars\" ment. -"], [185, "OR CUTTACK. 171 Birjai khelr oned by the author of the Ayin Acberi. Why they occupy, so uniformly, a position over the door- way of every temple in Orissa, sacred to whatever deity, I have never been able to learn. The walls ofthe interior are, as usual with Hindu temples, entirely plain and devoid of ornament, but each ofthe projecting steps in the square py ramidal roof, has been curiously rounded, and formed into a sort of cornice, which gives a slight finish to that part of the building. From the fragment remaining of the great tower, it would seem to have heen covered with rich and varied sculptured ornament, in 'the style of the Bhubaneswer temple. Like all edifices ofthe kind, too, it had evidently an inner false roof, of pyramidal shape, formed of the inverted stairs used by the old architects of the province, as a substitute for the arch. The Birjai or Parbati khetr, comprizes the country which stretches for five cos around the village of Jajipur (Yajyapura) on the banks ofthe By- tarini, as a centre. The sanctity of the place is, as usual, founded on a va- riety of fanciful notions and wild traditions, which it would be tedious to detail at any length. In the first place, its name, the \" City of Sacrifice,\" is derived from the circumstance of Brahma having performed here, in ancient days, the great sacrifice called the Das Aswamed'h, at the ghat so called, to which all the gods and goddesses were invited. Amongst others, Gangaji was prevailed on to attend, and has since flowed through the district in the sacred form of the Bytarini, which, descending to the infernal regions by an opening near Jajipur, becomes there the Styx of the Hindu Tartarus. At this same sacrifice, a particularly holy form of Durga, or Parvati, sprung up from tbe altar on which the burnt-offering was laid, and adopted the title of Biryh, whence the name ofthe khetr; from her, again, issued the eight Chandis, or representatives ofthe Sacti of Mahadeva; and their ap- pearance was followed by that ofthe eight Sambhus, or lords of the Linga* who with their dependent lingas amounting in all to no less than a core,"], [186, "ON ORISSA PROPER 172 are stationed at different points, over the whole khetr, to guard it from the intrusion of Asurs, Rakshases, and other malignant demons. The titles of the female energies above noticed are KothVasini, Siddheswari, Nibakhi, Uttareswari, Bhagavati, Kotavi, and Bhimaki ; those of the males Trilocha na, Someswara, Trilokeswara, Pranaveswara, Isaneswara, Akandeswara, Agniswara, and Siddhiswara, which the learned reader may compare with the epithets of the same divinities who protect and sanctify the Bishen Khetr. Besides the aforementioned claims to veneration, Jajipur is farther es teemed, from its being supposed to rest on the navel of the tremendous giant or demon, called the Gaya Asur, who was overthrown by Vishnu. Such was his bulk, that, when stretched on the ground, his head rested at Gaya, his navel (nabhi) at this place, and his feet ata spot near Rajamendri. There is a very sacred well or pit within the enclosure of one of the Jaji pur temples, called the Gaya JN&bhi or Bamphi, which is fabled to reach to the navel of the monster, and into it the Hindu pilgrims throw the Pinda, or cake of rice and sweetmeats, which is offered, at particular conjunctions, as an expiation for the sins of their ancestors. The priests and inhabitants of Jajipur insist, that in 1821, a sudden rise of water took place in the well, which forced up the accumulated mass of sour rice cakes that had been there fermenting for months or years, and deluged the whole area of the temple with the filth. The occurrence was regarded both as a miracle, and as the forerunner of some great calamity. The numerous stone temples on both sides of the Bytarini, executed mostly in a very respectable style of architecture, bespeak the ancient im portance of the place ; and history informs us that it was formerly one of the capitals ofthe Orissan monarchy. The Rajas of the Kesari dynasty held here their Court occasionally, as well as those of the Ganga Vansa line, and the remains of their Nour, or palace, at present an undefinable heap of ruin, are still shewn. The Musselman writers seem sometimes to men tion Jajipur as a separate principality, in the time ofthe Ganga Bans Ra-"], [187, "OR CUTTACK. 173 jas, but I can discover no ground whatever for such a territorial division. Mohammed Taki Khan, the Deputy of Shujaa Khan Nazir of Bengal, held his Court at Jajipur, and built a fine palace and mosque on the banks ofthe Bytarini, early in the last century, out ofthe materials of some dilapidated Hindu temple, the sculptured ornaments of which may be still observed \u00ab many parts of the walls. His palace, again, has been in great part des- troyed by the officers of the present government, to obtain materials for the . < construction of public works in the neighbourhood. \"The environs of Jajipur, present much to interest the curious, in its tem ples, khambas or columns in various styles, and fine remains of statuary. On one of the pillars, an inscription has been discovered, which is said to be of the same character exactly as that on the brow of the Khandigiri cavern of Khurda. The most eminently curious objects ofthe place how ever, are, the images of certain Hindu goddesses, carved in stone, which I shall now more particularly describe. At the back of a high terrace supporting the cenotaph of Syyed Bokha ri, a Musselman saint, three colossal statues of the Hindu divinities, are shown. They lie with their heels uppermost, on a heap of rubbish, in pre cisely the same position apparently that they assumed, when tumbled from their thrones above, by the Musselman conquerors of the province, who des troyed a celebrated temple at the spot, and further desecrated it, by erect ing on its ruins, a shrine and mosque of their own worship. The images are cut in alto relievo, out of enormous blocks of the indurated Mugni, or chlorite slate rock, and measure about ten feet in length. They represent Kali, Varahi the female energy of Vishnu, in the Varaha or Boar Avatar, and lndrani the lady of Indra, and though the subjects are gro tesque, the execution is distinguished by a degree of freedom, skill and pro priety, quite unusual in the works of Hindu sculptors. The first is a dis gusting, but faithful, representation of a ghastly figure, nearly a skeleton, with many of tlie muscles and arteries exposed to view, invested with the"], [188, "174 ON ORISSA PROPER Eildges, distinguishing marks and attributes of the goddess Kali. She is seated on a car, or vahana, supported by a kneeling diminutive figure of Maha~ deva. The second has a boar's bead, and a huge pot belly, like that of Ga nesa, and rests on a buffalo. The third is a well proportioned femalefigure, seated on an elephant, the animal consecrated by the Hindu Mythology to Indra, the lord of the Deotas. On the banks of the river, one meets with a sort of raised gallery, filled with mythological sculptures, amongst which, seven large colossal figures of the female divinities called the Matris, are particularly remarkable. They are said to have been recovered, lately, out ofthe sand of the river \u2014 where they were tossed by the Moguls on their shrines being destroyed \u2014 by a mahajan of Cuttack, who built the edifice in which they are now deposited. They differ little in style and dimensions, from those above described, but appear to be cut out of blocks of basalt, or greenstone, instead of chlorite 12 3 4 shist. They are styled respectively Kali, lndrani, Caumarf, Rudrani, 5 G 7 Varahini, Vaishnavi, and Yama Matri. The figure of Kali is sculp- tured in a very spirited manner ; she is represented with an axe in one hand, and a cup full of blood in the other, dancing in an infuriated attitude, after the destruction ofthe giant Rakta Vija, and trampling unconsciously on her husband Mahadeo, who, as the fable runs, had thrown himself at her feet, to solicit her to desist from those violent movements, which were shak- ing the whole world. That of Jam Matri, the \" mother of Yama,\" is also a very striking and remarkable piece of sculpture. Her form is that of a hi- deous decrepid old woman, seated on a pedestal, quite naked, with a coun- tenance alike expressive of extreme age, and that sourness of disposition which has rendered her proverbial as a scold. There are likewise fine re presentations in this mythological gallery, of the Narasinha Avatar, and the Giant Ravana, with his hundred heads and arms. Under the head of Civil Architecture I shall, in conclusion mention the Bridges of Orissa, which are certainly the most creditable, though not the"], [189, ""], [190, ""], [191, "OR CUTTACK. 177 most magnificent, monuments remaining of its indigenous princes.* Many of these works are to be found in different parts of the province, still in ex cellent state of preservation. The principal bridges which I have seen, are, that between Simleah and Soro, of fourteen nalehs or channels : the Athareh or eighteen naleh bridge, at Puri ; the Char naleh, in the same neighbour hood ; the bridge at Delang, and another over the Dya, between Khurda and Pipley. They are generally termed indifferently by foreigners, Mogul and Marhatta bridges, but the latter race during their unsettled and disturbed government in Cuttack, certainly never constructed works of so useful and durable a character, and besides the fact that the history of some of the principal ones is well known, it is quite obvious from a consideration of their style and architectural ornaments, that they are of pure Hindu origin, and belong to an age ignorant of the use of the arch. A short description of the Athareh naleh bridge at Puri, will serve, to illustrate sufficiently this part of the subject. It was built of a ferruginous colored stone, probably the iron clay, early in the fourteenth century, by Raja Kabir Narsinh Deo, the successor of Langora Narsinh Deo who completed the black Pagoda. The Hindus, being ignorant how to turn an arch, substituted in lieu of it the method, often adverted to above, of laying horizontal tiers of stones on the piers, the one projecting slightly beyond the other in the manner of invert ed stairs, until they approach near enough at top, to sustain a key stone or cross beam ; a feature so remarkable in Hindu architecture, that it seems strange it should not have been hitherto particularly noticed, in any des cription ofthe antiquities of the country. The bridge has eighteen nalehs or passages for the water, each roofed in the way described. Its total length is 290 feet, and height of the central passage eighteen feet, and its breadth fourteen ditto ; of the smallest ones, at each extremity, thirteen and seven respectively ; and the thickness of the piers, which have been judiciously * Mr. J. Grant in bis Historical Analysis calls them, I know not why the \" wretched edifices of rustic bridges.\" W"], [192, "ON ORISSA PROPER OR CUTTACK. 178 rounded on the side opposed to the current, eight and six feet; the height ofthe parapet, which is a modern addition, is six feet. Of the other native buildings of the province little need be said. The stone rivetment at Cuttack, a work of magnitude and indispensible utility, is probably of Mogul origin, built in imitation of a more ancient one, the remains of which are still to be seen. Fort Barabati has been described in speaking of the modern capital. The ruins extant of the old palaces of the Rajas, at Cuttack, Choudwar, Jajpur, and Bhubaneswer, are mere shapeless masses of stone and mounds of earth, which it would be fruitless to attempt any detailed account of. The ancient fortress of Sarengerh, on the south bank of the Kajuri, opposite to Cuttack, is remarkable for the great distance to which its works may be traced, but no portion of it remains habitable, and a modern killah, of the Musselman time, occupies the site of the citadel and palace of the first ofthe Ganga Vansa Rajas."], [193, ""], [194, ""], [195, ""], [196, ""]]
