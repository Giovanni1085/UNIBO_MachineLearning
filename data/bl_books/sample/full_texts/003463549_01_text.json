LONDON: RIVINGTON, PERCIVAL &\u2022 CO."], [7, "PREFACE In this little handbook my object is to facilitate the work of learning as well as of teaching French History and Literature. It is an abstract such as should be made by students for themselves; but these abstracts take a very long time to write; and those who know and sympathise with the work required of the youth of our day will appreciate, it is hoped, the effort here made to save precious time by an analysis ready to hand. Special periods, as a rule, are now wisely, in fact needfully, set for study. Unfortunately, as Messrs. Acland and Ransome say in the preface to their ex cellent handbook of English History, the 'before and after' is thus apt to be neglected. The many interest ing details of isolated periods should not exclude a knowledge of the general outlines ; and if such outlines are insisted upon and intelligently taught, the interest in private reading of history or literature for its own sake will be increased. The aim of these Tables is to iii"], [8, "PREFACE IV supply continuity in the different periods, and to give, in the period set for special study, the central facts round which the thousand details may be grouped. To the Synoptic Tables of Literature, Recapitulatory Tables have been added at the end of the XVIth, XVIIth, XVIIIth, and XIXth centuries. In these centuries the literary productions, that are necessarily grouped in the Synoptic Tables under their authors' names, are so numerous as to make it impossible to see at a glance the real development of literature, year by year. By means of these Recapitulatory Tables the relative dates of the. great masterpieces are shown, and the tabulation of their real sequence gives a clear in sight into their mutual action and reaction. At the same time, I have endeavoured to help the student to connect an author not only with his own literary contemporaries and his own age in civil life, but also with the contemporary events in the History of France and Europe generally. This has been done by the aid of a few Essays on the chief Characters and Epochs, and a short list of Synchronisms placed at the foot of each Table. These will, I hope, tend to show the reciprocal influence of events upon the individual, and of the individual upon them ; they will add those side-lights that are necessary to the intelligent appre-"], [9, "PREFACE V ciation of the particular author's works, and of his place in the history of the world. I have tried to place clearly before the eyes, in short Tables, the chief facts and figures of French History and Literature. In itself, the selection or omission of events or authors is always a hard task ; but this difficulty has been materially increased, in the Tables of Literature, by the division of authors and works into three classes, according to their relative importance. In each Table the most conspicuous characters stand out prominently in black type; the stars of second magnitude are represented in ordinary print, and the minor stars in italics. It is hoped that the many imperfections of detail may meet with in dulgence from those whose opinions may at times differ from mine, on the score of the difficulty of the task, the soundness of the general principle, and the prac tical utility of the book. There remains to me the pleasant task of thanking a few friends, particularly the indefatigable M. Georges Petilleau, to whose kindness I owe a good many dates of contemporary writers which the ordinary authorities failed to give, and also a few of my pupils, from whose intelligent criticisms I have often derived great assistance."], [10, "PREFACE VI If, in spite of much conscientious effort and care, inaccuracies have found their way into the mass of figures and names contained in this little handbook, I shall be very grateful to any pupil or teacher who may kindly point them out to me, and thus add to the practical value of a book that is intended to be to them a real help.

In both these assemblies the Em peror held an inquiry into the state of the kingdom. Besides the General Assemblies, in each county, assizes were held, in which justice was rendered by means of the dchevins (scabini), or royal j udges. The ' Capitulaires ' were bills submitted to the examination and discussion of the Nobility in the general assemblies, and definitely proclaimed by the Emperor. There are sixty-five of these extant, which illustrate the wisdom of his legis lation. Charlemagne, a close ally of the Popes, protected the Church, founded numerous abbeys, instituted canons, reformed the monasteries, created ' la dime ' (the tithe), and extended ecclesiastical jurisdiction. The bishops, consulted upon every occasion, became important. Under Charlemagne the first literary awakening took place. He founded even in his palace the first First literary academy : the ' Ecole Palatine,' directed by awakening. Alcuin (735-804), he honoured by attending in person, and strove, though inadequately, he admitted, to wield the pen as well as he did the sword. He established numerous schools where arithmetic, gram mar, theology and the higher classics were taught.

Under the reign of Louis xi. royal power grew, and in the history of France, until 1715, the growth of the royal power is synonymous with the growth of France.

Negotiations had barely begun, when news came that Liege had revolted against Charles at the instigation of Louis.

In his distress, Louis, after winning over the fiery Duke's councillors, and Philip de Com mynes in particular, signed a confirmation of the treaty of Conflans, gave Champagne to his brother instead of Normandy, and was humiliated into marching with Charles against Liege and witnessing its fall (1468). On recovering his freedom, Louis gave Guyenne instead of Champagne to his brother, thus separating him from the Duke of Burgundy and embroiling him with England.

Henry iv. is a progressive statesman of the noblest type. He had availed himself of his high position, as one of the founders of French national unity, to do all that lies within the sphere of a ruler to facilitate the downfall of the old system and to en courage the formation of the new. In France he had striven, and had striven successfully, against the feudal tyranny of the great Nobles, whose one aim, generation after generation, was to establish themselves in their provincial governments, made perpetual and hereditary, with a nominal allegiance to the King, not more onerous than that by which the princes of the Empire were bound to the Austrian Policy of the French Nobles from fourteenth to seventeenth century. sovereign ; they would have assimilated the conditions of France to that of Germany; they did not scruple unpatriotically to call in the assistance of the Spanish government, which was only too eager to help.

There would have been left no power in Europe capable of resisting the Catholic reaction inaugurated by the Spanish mon archy and maintained by the Austrian Empire; and the Thirty Years' War would have had a result widely different from that equilibrium of States and of Religions which it is the great glory of Richelieu, as the organ of the French monarchy, to have obtained. Uniformly from the fourteenth to the eighteenth century had the policy of the French Nobility been self-seeking, anti national and retrograde ; almost as uniformly from the fourteenth century to the seventeenth had the policy of the French monarchy been centralising, anti-feudal and coincident with the common interests of the French nation and of Europe.

Old Sully from his retreat said the King had been ' conime inspire de Dieu ' in choosing him as his minister. Richelieu soon acquired in the council and over the King's mind great ascendency, owing to his firmness of character, his strength of will, his indefatigable activity and the loftiness and inflexible rigidity of his views. Louis XIII., weak and melancholy, cold-hearted, of sound but narrow judgment, understood though he never liked Richelieu, and sacrificed to his iron will mother, wife, friends and courtiers : from every personal interview with the King, after a difference of opinion, the Red Cardinal rose more powerful than before : but ' les quatre pieds carres du cabinet du roi ' gave him, as he said, more trouble than all the cabinets of Europe.

During the eighteen years of his ministry, Richelieu pursued three aims for the greatness of the French His three monarchy and of France: (1) the eradica aims- tion of feudalism; (2) The ruin of the Protestants as a political party; and (3) abroad, the reduction of the abnormal and threatening power of the Austro-Spanish monarchy.

By the Edict of Nantes, the Protestant p Protestant- WOrsllip was licensed in 3500 ' places ism and de surete ' or castles. The Condes, the Chatillons, the Rohans, the Colignys and countless others, illustrate the aristocratic character of French Protestantism. Had the French reformers carried the day, local aristocratic or feudal government would have taken the place of centralised middle-class government. On the other hand, those among the great feudal families of France who sided with the old religion took advantage of the confusion of the time to assert the federative feudal principle. Richelieu had to face the same obstacles as Henry IV., whose strong hand, honeyed words and ready purse had, together with Sully's wise and far-seeing administrative reforms, kept the Nobility within bounds. Now, as then, the aim of the ' noblesse ' was first and foremost to restore feu dalism in France by making their own governments in the provinces perpetual and hereditary; for this object they endeavoured to place the French throne at the mercy of the Spanish monarchy, and they used Protestantism as a weapon. Hence the grand solidarity of Richelieu's three aims directed against the three obstacles to royal power. At the death of Henry iv. (1610), the great Princes of the kingdom advanced formidable claims to par tition the government of the kingdom among them selves.

These traitorous and contemptible Nobles, always ready to barter away their country's freedom to the Spaniard, were to be crushed with an iron heel, if France was to be governed with a strong hand. Richelieu's course was wise, merciful and inflexibly severe. He struck the chief traitors and these alone. When he enforced his laws against duelling, it was a Montmorency whom he chose for his example ; when he wished to strike with terror the crew of peculators, it was a marshal of Marillac whom he sent to the scaffold. Forty-seven sentences of death for political offences were pronounced under his dicta torship; among those who suffered were five dukes, four counts, a marshal of France and the King's special favourite and grand equerry Cinq-Mars. Of these forty-seven sentences twenty -six only were actually carried out. That each of these twenty-six men was guilty of high treason ten times over, treason im palliated by a single worthy motive, was not and could not be denied. But Richelieu's name was cursed by the aristocracy of France, and perhaps for that very reason blessed by every patriot writer of later generations."], [159, "RICHELIEU 147 Richelieu did not content himself with decimating and awing into submission the French Nobility. He undermined and overthrew their political power. He found the soil of France covered with innumerable feudal castles. The men who held these castles held them nominally for the King's service ; but they used them as centres of disorder and rebellion. Richelieu, pur posely grouping together Protestantism and Feudalism, ordered all castles to be dismantled ' that were not necessary for the protection of the French frontier.' He struck a yet more telling blow at the privileged Nobility who monopolised all the high military and civil appointments, by the suppression of Richeiieu's some high military posts (for instance that 'Intendant\u00b0-' of ' connetable ' and ' grand-amiral '), and particularly by the institution of his ' Intendants militaires.' The position of the feudal lords to whom the French King had intrusted the government of the provinces was as important as that of the Viceroy of Ireland before the Union; and this position the Nobles perpetually endeavoured to make hereditary in their families. In each province Richelieu placed an Intendant, with powers much resembling those of the present Prefect of a Department, powers directly derived from the King's council. These Intendants were invariably men of the middle class ; their salary was moderate, their social position by no means high ; but they were always men of energy and ability, and gradually the whole work of assessing the taxation and of internal administration was transferred into their hands, thus"], [160, "GROWTH OF THE FRENCH MONARCHY 148 bringing to a successful end the work of centralisation round the monarchy begun by Charlemagne Avith his missi dominici and by St. Louis Avith his appeals from feudal to royal courts, and dealing the coup de grace to feudal home-rule.

Intoxicated by his success and his insatiate ambition, Louis xiv. rushed into wars with the whole of Europe now threatened by a power similar to that of Charles v. ; and these wars plunged France into an abyss of misery which, worse than the defeats that cast over the great monarch's last days a gloom of huniiliation and shame, caused the people to curse and cover with insults his royal remains, and finally culminated in the over throw of the monarchy in 1792."], [168, "156 THE STATES-GENERAL\u2014 THE 'PARLEMENT' A very similar tale is the wonderful story of Napoleon 1. : the Peace of Amiens (1802) Avas his Nimeguen : had he rested satisfied Avith his achieve ments, his heirs Avould probably noAV be sitting on the throne of France.

Awed by the royal presence the Parlement generally jaelded ; if not, the King's Swiss body-guards arrested on the spot and conveyed to the Bastille a few of the recalcitrant members, and the registration of the edict was humbly voted. Only during Louis XIV.'s minority does the 'Parlement' come into political notice.

The Queen Regent, Anne of Austria, tried the old method and arrested Charton, Blancmesnil and Broussel, three Councillors.

But time and Mazarin ultimately won the day. The magistracy, disgusted at the overbearing behaviour of the Princes at home and at their unpatriotic appeals to Spain, made their peace with the throne (1649), and when, a year after the end of the struggle the Nobles continued to oppose Mazarin (1650-1653), the young King, Louis xiv., then only seventeen years of age, heard that the Parlement refused their sanction to a royal edict, he only had to enter the hall, riding-whip in hand, and to remind them of the troubles caused by their resistance some years before; and these grey -haired men bowed their heads in submission. Never once in history was the resistance of the Parlement worth recording. As to the States-General, they were summoned by the kings but seldom, as from the time of Charles vn.

These resemblances, however, lie only on the surface. A deeper examination Avill shoAv that no two events of the same kind can be more opposite in their essential character than the French and English Revolu tions. While the object of one was to destroy, that of the other was to restore. In the Petition of Rights, the English Parliament protested against certain of the King's Acts, which Avere the acknowledged prerogative of the French Monarch, such as the levying of taxes by his OAvn authority, imprisoning his subjects and confiscating their property arbitrarily and Avithout legal trial, billeting soldiers and mariners upon householders, etc. Against these abuses the English Parliament appealed to the rights and liberties which they had inherited according to the laws and statutes of the realm, such as the Great Charter, statutes of EdAvard 1., EdAvard in., and others. Such was the beginning of the English Revolution. But Avhat Avas the course of the first French National Assembly? After a long and splendid career in arts and arms, the most polished nation in Europe considered it necessary to assume the position of man just emerged from his primeval forests, and, like the original communities imagined by Rousseau and other speculative politicians, to settle the elemen tary conditions of its civil state. Everything that had gone before Avas sAvept aAvay, and a constitution was built up on paper from first principles as deduced from the supposed natural ' Rights of Man.' A prac tical statesman Avould refrain from enunciating these"], [180, "CAUSES AND RESULTS OF THE 168 elementary principles, Avhich, in fact, are little more than truisms, though it may be said that they had a peculiar significance in France, as showing the hatred towards the privileged classes, and indicating the level ling system Avhich Avas to folloAv. Another striking difference is, that Avhile in England the quarrel was in great part founded on religious disputes, and fanaticism Avas a principal agent, in France religion was discarded altogether. As the Avhole method and character of the two revolutions was diametrically opposed, so also was the conduct of the two Kings. Charles i. had violated the Constitution by not calling a Parliament during a space of twelve years ; Louis xvi., though bound by no laAV but his oavu will, assembled the States-General, Avhich had not been summoned for nearly two centuries ; during the abey ance of the English Parliament, the Star Chamber had proceeded in the most absolute and illegal manner, Avhile the French King, instead of increasing, consider ably mitigated the arbitrary powers (lettres de cachet, etc.) Avhich Avere at his disposal; Charles began a civil Avar and took up arms against his subjects ; Louis could not be persuaded to shed the blood of his people, even in the most urgent cases of self-defence. In judging the French Revolution from its effects, which, however, may still be said to be in progress, we must on the whole pronounce Beneficial effects. it to have been beneficial. It delivered France from"], [181, "FRENCH REVOLUTION AND THE EMPIRE 169 an arbitrary and unbounded royal prerogative, from an intolerant Church and an iniquitously privileged Nobility, and it welded the previously ill-cemented provinces into one compact and powerful body; in short, into the present French nation. It Avill hardly be disputed that France of the present day is an incomparably greater and more poAverful State than it ever was under the ancient dynasty. But notAvith standing the vast effects of the French Revolution on the material condition of Europe, its moral influence does not appear to have been permanent. In the latter respect it is far behind the Reformation. In England the French Revolution ultimately pro duced an entire alteration in the character of Pitt's policy, and a split betAveen Burke and Fox Avhich vir tually annihilated for the time the Whig party and ren dered Pitt absolutely pre-eminent. The groAving excesses of the French Revolutionaries produced in England the effect of retarding for forty years all thoughts of reform; as early as March 1790 a proposition for the relief of Dissenters and for the abolition of the Test and Corporation Acts, Avhich had only been lost by a small majority the preceding year, was thrown out by overwhelming numbers, and the Reform Bill proposed by Flood, though Pitt had several times himself brought the subject forward, met Avith a similar fate, and was only to be passed in 1832.

Authority in France was divided, and, in spite of the efforts of the Directory, the administrative disorder was complete. ' Agir est le fait d'un seul,' said Bonaparte ; he therefore established throughout France unity of authority. For the former division into provinces, the Convention had substituted a division into proportionate depart ments.

Under the Merovingians, ' France ' consisted of 4 Kingdoms : Avistrasia, Neustria, Burgundy and Aquitaine. Under Charlemagne and his son, ' France ' was divided into 80 counties, which gradually developed into nearly independent states. In 987, at Hugh Capet's accession, there were 61 fiefs, nominally depen dent upon the crown. From Louis vi. le Gros (1108-1137), the provinces of France may be divided into two masses : the royal domain, and the provinces outside the royal domain. Under the last Carlovlngians, the royal domain consisted only in the territories of Laon, Rheims and Compiegne. Hugh Capet added his own Duchy of France (County of Paris and Orleans). This kingdom comprised only 5 departments of present France (viz., Seine, Seine-et-Oise, Seine-et- Marne, Oise and Loiret). The other provinces were successively united as follows : \u2014 1082.

The divine service already contained the germs of the drama : high mass, which comprises both action and dialogue, is in itself a dramatic perform ance ; so, in singing the Passion, the words of the Gospel are divided among three priests, which produces a more striking effect, and partially suggested the Mysteries. Before the Xllth Century no dramatic literature, as is now understood, existed in France. During that period the French dramatic instinct was at first satisfied by a multitude of miniature representations of the scenes dear to the heart of the Colosseum-going Eoman, No dramatic literature before the Xllth Century. which, as a consequence of the spread of Christianity, gradually developed into religious spectacles coupled with comic pieces, dancing and pantomimes, con ducted by travelling actors ; even in the latter, however, the religious element made itself apparent, causing the actors to assume a religious garb in their performances, and, under it, to commit abuses which led to their prohibition by Charlemagne in 789. These exhibitions were conducted in the Churches, with all the grotesque accompaniments of singing and dancing, even by the Clergy themselves, and by no stretch of the imagination do they deserve the title of drama. From the XVIth 260"], [273, "TRAGEDY AND COMEDY 261 Century, however, to the present day the evolution of French drama may be traced from the earliest form of Mysteries and Miracle-Plays, through the successively religious, satirical, classical and romantic stages of the Renaissance period to the hour when Corneille and Moliere, in their respective spheres of Tragedy and Comedy, raised it at a bound to the zenith of its perfection. The Clergy at certain epochs, particularly at Christ mas and Easter, added to the service the representation of the facts of Biblical history : these short liturgical dramas in Latin and in prose were soon extended : the ' farcitures ' or ' epitres farcies,' as they were called from the mingling of the Latin with the vernacular, (' lingua rustica ' or ' langue vulgaire,') were soon repre sented outside the Churches, in the Church-squares, the cemeteries and crossways. One of these still exists, ' les Vierges sages et les Vierges folles,' which belongs to the XIth Century. Gradually the text became longer, verse replaced prose, and the popular language, the ' langue vulgaire,' was substituted for Latin. It was in the XII th Century that this progress was ac complished : the ' Representation d'Adam ' XllthtoXIVth Centuries. Miracle-plays. or ' Drame a\" Adam,' by reason of its length, of its use of the vernacular, and of its representation outside the Church, is a secular drama, and the most ancient work of French dramatic literature. Of the dramas of the XHIth Century two only have survived, Le ' Jeu de Saint Nicolas' by Jean Bodel, and the ' Miracle de Saint Theophile,' by Ruteb\u0153uf."], [274, "ORIGIN OF THE FRENCH DRAMA 262 To the XlVth Century belong the forty Miracle plays of ' Nostre-Dame,' relating to some wonderful deed performed by the Virgin Mary. These were acted by lay actors, and the drama now seems entirely secularised: for the Clergy were often represented in a contemptible character, and the boldness of certain pictures, as well as the licence of speech, point to the same conclusion. The Mysteries merely place before the audience in the form of a dialogue, in rhymed verse of eight m steries syllables, an historical event taken from 1400-1548. t^ Scriptures or the lives of the Saints. They were of a prodigious length (' La Passion ' had 70,000 lines), taking sometimes twenty days for the performance, and employing often as many as four or six hundred persons from all classes of society. A relic of those ancient plays is to be found at the present day in the Passion-plays that are performed every ten years at Ober-Ammergau. These countless mysteries have been divided into three cycles, according to their subject: the cycle of the Old Testament, that of the New Testament, and the cycle of the Saints. A few others belong to profane history or chivalry : the ' Mystere de Grisdidis,' the ' Mystire du Siege d'Orleans,' and 'Mystere de la Destruction de Troie.' But the favourite theme seems to have been the grand and inexhaustible subject of the Passion of Our Lord. It gave its name to the most ancient permanent company of actors giving regular representations in a real theatre. The ' Confrerie de la Passion ' is found established at"], [275, "TRAGEDY AND COMEDY 263 Saint Maur-les-fosses in 1398, but it is not known how long it had already been in existence. In 1402 letters patent from Charles vi. gave the Brotherhood legal existence, and conferred upon it the exclusive right of performing miracle-plays. This they did on Sundays and holidays, and any grand occasion, such as the reception of a sovereign or of a royal ambassador ; and they did so with such success that the time of Vespers had to be advanced in order to give the faithful time to reach their beloved theatre. To this Brotherhood is due the erection of the first theatre in France. The performances, however, did not cease entirely in the Churches ; for, in some parts of France, they were held inside the Church as late as the end of the XVIth Century. In 1548 a decree of the Parlement forbade the performance of any mystery upon a holy subject. This was the death-warrant of the ' Confrerie.' The whole population from noble to peasant used to flock to these performances in France, as they did in England and in Germany at the same period.1 The nobles, magistrates and royal officers were seated upon the stage,2 and the people on the floor of the house, the men on the right and the women on the left, as in Church. The religious element also appears in the construction of the first theatres built for the per- 1 See Synoptic Table 3 (Synchronisms). 2 This was the case until Voltaire succeeded in ridding the stage of these aristocratic and troublesome spectators, whose presence greatly inconvenienced the actors.

Too much dramatic excellence cannot be expected from these Mysteries, which nevertheless contain a few striking and pathetic passages. The people, for whom they were performed, saw in them a truthful image of their own belief, of the Paradise enjoyed by their first parents, and of the Paradise they hoped hereafter to enjoy themselves : the tawdry accompaniment of flute, harp and lute was to them the same angelic melody which was to charm their ears after death ; the voice of the priest ringing in their ears the explanation of what their eyes saw \u2014 the dark mystery of human life, of the fall and the redemption, of vengeance and forgiveness, \u2014was to them an oracle, a true exposition of the hidden book, which their faith, intensified by the scenes that they saw re-enacted before their very eyes, would not permit them to doubt. The success of the religious drama gave rise to com petition : with the growth of civilisation and the development of the state, dramatic repre sensations were extended from purely re ligious subjects to mystical and allegorical, moral and sometimes historical themes, on Moraiities, Farces and 'soties,- the one hand, in the Moralities, and to political and social satire, on the other, in the Farces and ' Soties.' There had been, two centuries before, two comic"], [277, "TRAGEDY AND COMEDY 265 plays, ' Le Jeu de la FeuillSe,' and ' Le Jeu de Robin et de Marion,' by Adam de la Halle (XHIth Century) ; but they are different from any contemporary form of French Comedy : the former is a comedy of the Aristophanic type, the latter is a comic opera. , The moralities began to flourish in the XVth Century ; they were allegorical comic pieces with a moral purpose. In these, as in the Miracle- r r Moralities. plays and Mysteries, God, angels and devils were represented ; but they were accompanied by allegorical figures and monsters suggested by the wildest imagination : among these abstract characters may be mentioned not only ' The Wise ' and ' the Foolish Map ' Fasting,' ' Prayer,' ' Almsgiving,' but also ' Hope of long life,' ' Despair of pardon' and still more singular impersonations : ' The Clay of the earth,' 'Abel's blood,' ' The Flight of time! etc. The Moralities became the monopoly of the guild of the Clerks of the Law-Courts (' Parlement ') called the Kingdom of La Basoche, that had received 0 La Basoche. from King Philip le Bel in 1303 extensive rights and privileges: they had their king and their chancellor; they exercised real jurisdiction over their own members, and even had the right of coining money. This guild existed down to the French Revolution, and the Basochians took a considerable part in the storming of the Bastille (14th July 1789). The Moralities were not long popular; for they be longed to the genre ennuyeux. The 'Enfants sans Souci' formed another guild,"], [278, "266 ORIGIN OF THE FRENCH DRAMA recruited among the poorer and more lazy Government clerks ; thev too had their dignitaries ' le 'Soties.'

The Sotie is practically a lampoon put upon the stage : it attacks all classes of society. In the Sotie, called ' Vieux monde?

Whilst the Moralities and Soties contain a moral or lesson of some kind, the farces were merely intended to amuse: they were a sort of revival of , . the fabliau put into dialogue and parts. Farces. Among these lively and witty plays, one masterpiece stands out in bold relief, the ' Farce de Maistre Pierre Pathelin ' (1459). Sainte-Beuve aptly describes it as ' a flash of human genius, that harbingered, two centuries in advance, the coming of Moliere.' The"], [279, "TRAGEDY AND COMEDY 267 farces seem to have been performed by both these comic guilds. During the confusion that prevailed in France during the reign of Charles vi., satire had free scope in the hands of the Basochiens and Enfants sans The s and Souci, in Paris, as well as in those of the the crown. countless similar guilds that were founded all over France. A censorship was set up under Charles vn., but not to much purpose. But the stern Louis xi. was not to be trifled with : politics had to be eschewed : thous'h he allowed the inoffensive farce of Pathelin, no sotie was played till good King Louis xil, who loved truth even at his own expense, re-established the privi lege of the guilds. In fact, during his quarrel with Pope Julius 11., he used the sotie to influence the popular mind and to further his policy : in Pierre Gringoire's 'sotie du Prince des Sots' (1512), Mere Sotte wore the garb of the Church. But, at his death, with Francis 1., court scandals began, and satirists had to be gagged : despite Clement Marot's entreaties to the king, severe repression ultimately crushed these political satires. The French theatre was thus not wanting in variety of matter ; the field of dramatic art was ripe for develop ment, only requiring some predominating influence to unite its scattered atoms, to combine and elevate its chaos of conflicting elements \u2014 the grotesque and the pathetic, the cynical and the religious, fervour and satire, faith and scepticism, \u2014 a chaos only equalled by the confused state of that society to which it owed its birth."], [280, "268 PREDECESSORS AND CONTEMPORARIES That influence was found in the Renaissance, which, on the ruins of the medi\u00e6val stage, raised that dramatic structure whose foundations have survived to the pre sent day. But, whereas the Renaissance with its classic breath swept away the drama of medi\u00e6val France and substituted Tragedy proper, based upon the models of ancient Greece and Rome, no such break occurs in the history of Comedy. The first comedy of classical mould, the 'Eugene' of Jodelle (1532-1573) is in reality nothing but a farce, and between the comedies of Moliere and the best pieces of the Middle Ages, the only difference is their literary value; and Moliere freely dipped into French medi\u00e6val Comedy as well as into the classical models of antiquity and the Italian comic authors, to produce those masterpieces that excite the wonder and admiration of mankind. PREDECESSORS AND CONTEMPORARIES OF CORNEILLE. In the history of Literature, it is seldom that sharp lines of division are to be found between successive stages of progress. The French drama of the XVIth Century, however, offers one of those rare exceptions. Jodelle (1532-1573), a member of the Pleiade of Ronsard, had replaced the Mysteries and ' Soties' by tragedies and comedies imitated jodeiu. from the Greek; Garnier (1534-1590) had impressed on French tragedy a character of simplicity and sus-"], [281, "OF CORNEILLE 269 tained gravity which it has retained ever since, and had shown a boldness and vigour of style which earned for him among later generations the title of the ances tor of Corneille. Instead of servilely following the Greeks, he showed independence, ennobled the charac ters, passions and style, and raised the standard of the drama; among the tragedies that preceded the days of Rotrou and Corneille, his plays, though exaggerated and bombastic, occupy the first place. Gamier was followed by Montchrestien and Th6o phile de Viaud. The former wrote six tragedies, in cluding one on the favourite subject of Mont. Sophonisbe. The chief work of Theophile *\u00a3*\u00a3 is ' Pyrame et Thisbe,' which offers a deviaud. good instance of the affected style of the time. Speak ing of the dagger with which Pyrame has slain himself, Thisbe cries : ' Ah ! voila le poignard qui du sang de son maitre S'est souilliS lachement ! il en rougit, le traitre ! ' All the tragedies produced hitherto maintained the classical chorus, which may be regarded as a reminis cence of the old miracle-plays. At the opening of the XVIIth Century a further change had come over the French drama: instead of being confined to a select and refined liter- Aiexandre ary audience, it now appealed to the people, Hardy' and felt it had the public for a judge. The ardour for the stage was enormous, and poets liberally answered the demand. Aiexandre Hardy (1560-1631) alone"], [282, "27o PREDECESSORS AND CONTEMPORARIES wrote over 600 plays (tragedies and comedies) of which forty-one have come down to us. But he may be de scribed as a manufacturer of plays rather than a poet : one week was enough for him to invent, write and bring out a tragedy with his own company at his own theatre of the ' hotel d'Argent ' in the Marais. The chief interest of his plays is in the plot, as in the case of our dramatic authors before Marlowe ; however, he knew exactly how to seize on an interesting situation, and had the instinct of effect : ' Tragic verse,' he said, ' should have a masculine vigour, be continuously sus tained, without puns or rhyming prose, and without making mountains out of molehills.' Hardy's theory was in advance of his practice ; he knew what was good but lacked power to carry it out. At all events, he threw all his weight against the finical influence of the ' Preci euses,' and had the good sense to prefer Spanish stage tricks to Italian affectation. The names of ninety-six dramatic poets of this period have come down to posterity : they witnessed the first successes of the great Corneille. Among these should be mentioned Scudery, Mairet and Rotrou. The noble and bril- Scudery. _. . nant but vam cavalry officer, Georges de Scudery (1601-1667) wrote with wonderful fertility, and in 1636, supported by the all-powerful Cardinal Richelieu, raised the standard of war against ' le Cid' of Corneille, to whom he fancied himself far superior, Though very popular at the time, his works show all the marks of the bad taste prevalent at that period, and Boileau justly said :"], [283, "OF CORNEILLE 271 ' Bienheureux Scudery, dont la fertile plume Peut tous les niois sans peine enfanter un volume, Tes Merits, il est vrai, sans art et languissants, Semblent etre formes en depit du bon sens ; Mais ils trouvent pourtant, quoi qu'on en puisse dire, Un marchand pour les vendre et des sots pour les lire.' The reputation of Mairet (1604-1686) rests upon his tragedy, 'Sophonisbe' (1629), which shows less bad taste than most contemporary writings. ' Sophonisbe ' is, however, most remarkable ' The Three . Unities.' as the first regular French Tragedy, i.e. composed 'selon les regies,' the rules of the Three Unities wrongly attributed to Aristotle in his Poetics, but recognised at the time by the Italian Poets.1 Mairet, however, was never a member of the Academy founded by Richelieu in 1635. He proved one of the keenest adversaries of Corneille's ' Cid.' But Corneille did not disdain imitating very closely a passage of Mairet's 'Sophonisbe' in the celebrated imprecations of Camille against Rome, in his tragedy of ' Horace.' Jean Rotrou (1609-1650) was with L'Estoile, Bois robert, Colletet and Corneille, one of the five collaborators of Cardinal Richelieu, in the ' Theatre des Cinq Auteurs.' Though three years junior to Corneille, the latter called him 'his father.' Rotrou was doubtless in the field before him, and first sought to give firmness and pre cision to a language that was not yet definitely formed ; but Corneille was in reality Rotrou's master; for 'Le Cid' was played in 1636, and all the plays of Rotrou 1 See Essay on the Three Unities, end (p. 285)."], [284, "PIERRE CORNEILLE 272 that are worthy of being quoted were produced at least ten years later: 'Saint Genest' in 1646, ' Venceslas ' in 1647, and 'Cosroes' in 1649. Rotrou was the only contemporary dramatic author who took the part of Corneille in the famous ' querelle du Cid' (1636); as early as the production of Corneille's comedy ' La Veuve ' (1633), he wrote:\u2014 ' Juge de ton nitrite a qui rien n'est Par la confession de ton propre rival.' Thus was the way prepared for Corneille : love of the drama was part of French Life; attempts had been made in all styles ; it now remained to fix once for all the form, style, and language of Tragedy : this was the work of Corneille. Mairet's ' Sophonisbe ' may be com pared to Marlowe's ' Tamerlane.' After Marlowe came Shakespeare ; after Mairet, Corneille. PIERRE CORNEILLE ( i 606-1684) Pierre Corneille, ' le Grand Corneille,' said Voltaire, ' ainsi nomine\" pour le distinguer non seulement de son frere, mais du reste des hit/mains' has been called the creator of the great century which Pierre Corneille. he inaugurated. Born at Rouen in 1606, and brought up at the College of the Jesuits, he intended at first to enter at the bar. He began his dramatic career with some"], [285, "PIERRE CORNEILLE 273 inferior pieces in the style and in the bad taste pre valent at the time: these were 'Melite' (1629), a comedy, and ' Clitandre,' a tragedy which was a failure : he therefore returned to comedy and wrote ' La Veuve,' and several other comedies which met with indifferent success. He was then engaged by Cardinal Richelieu to assist the four other poets, Golletet, L'Estoihe, Bois robert and Rotrou, in working out plots composed by Richelieu. Corneille, however, proved too independent for this kind of work : ' II manque d'esprit de suite,' said the Cardinal, and Corneille, very fortunately, left the ' Societe des Cinq Auteurs.' His next production was 'M^dee' (1635), a tragedy which gave promise of the great works that were soon to follow :\u2014 ' Dans un si grand revers que vous reste-t-il ? \u2014 Moi Moi ! dis-je, et c'est assez ! ' is Medee's proud answer. But in the next year (1636) appeared 'Le Cid,' a tragedy taken from the Spanish of Guillem de Castro, in which both hero and heroine, Rodrigue and Chimene, sacrifice love to duty. The play aroused enormous enthusiasm : the year was called ' l'ann\u00a3e du Cid,' and ' beau comme le Cid ' became an epithet for anything indescribably beautiful. This suc^ cess excited, however, the jealousy of the dramatic poets who had been eclipsed, with Georges de Scudery at their head; they were encouraged by Richelieu, who directed Chapelain, the President of the Academy, which he had just founded (1635), to censure the T"], [286, "PIERRE CORNEILLE 274 piece: this he did in a half-hearted manner, and Richelieu, finding public opinion in ' la querelle du Cid ' too strong for him, was finally compelled to grant the poet a pension. 1 En vain contre le Cid un ministre se ligue ; Tout Paris pour Chimene a les yeux de Kodrigue,' said Boileau; and 'Le Cid' became the standard pattern of language, style and form for all tragedies to come, until the days of Victor Hugo and Romanti cism ; and the traditional form of five acts, violated only in Racine's 'Esther' (which has only three), has been preserved to the present day. Thus did Corneille win the title of father of French Tragedy. Four years after this great success, Corneille produced Horace, a tragedy on the subject of the battle between the Horatii and the Curiatii, a piece whose key-note is patriotism, and four months later ' Cinna ou la Clemence d'Auguste,' a glorification of monarchy. In 1643 ap peared the last great work of Corneille, 'Polyeucte,' founded on the martyrdom of a convert to Christianity and the triumph of religion. From this date the poet's genius began to decline : he wrote many plays, some of which had a measure of success at the time, while others were but coldly re ceived. Exceptions must be made however in the case of 'PompeV (1643), and 'Le Menteur' (1644), which is the first comedy of character. Before this, poets had been obliged to seek their models abroad, chiefly in Italy and in the writings of the ancients. 'Le"], [287, "PIERRE CORNEILLE 275 Menteur ' was a revelation in Comedy (as ' Le Cid ' had been in Tragedy), and particularly to Moliere, then twenty-two years of age, who acknowledged in after years his debt to Corneille, by saying that, had it not been for 'Le Menteur,' he would never have written his best-known comedies. In 1647 Corneille was admitted to the Academy ; but none of his works after this date are worthy of note. ' J'ai vu l'Ag^silas Helas!' was Boileau's epigram in 1666 ; and on the production of ' Attila ' : ' Apres l'Agesilas, Helas ! Mais apr\u00a3s 1' Attila, Hola! Corneille died in Paris at seventy-eight years of age, in 1684. The latter part of his life was embittered by poverty ; and he had the mortification of seeing himself superseded by Racine, his junior by thirty-three years, whose genius was revealed by 'Andromaque' in 1667, and whose reputation was established by the rapid succession of masterpieces that filled the ten ensuing years. Corneille has been reproached, and not unjustly, with having produced inferior plays (which, strangely enough, he himself liked as well as his best), and with having fallen occasionally into the bombastic style so fashion able among the followers of the Spaniard Gongora in"], [288, "PIERRE CORNEILLE 276 the first half of the century, when the only choice open to writers seemed to lie between Spanish pomposity and Italian affectation. The personages of Corneille want the mask and buskin of the old Greek drama; they are as .much above little human weaknesses as Oedipus ' Heroisme sur humain' of his and Clytenmaestra. They are ever guided by the maxims of duty, which they have ever on their lips ; for all of them, as for Chimene, it may be said ' le trouble de leur c\u0153ur ne peut rien sur leur ame.' In ' Horace,' for instance, Camille, the most human and winning of Corneille's creations, is great souled enough to send her lover to a combat in which either his death or that of her brothers is assured ; Sabine, the typical Roman matron, offers her own life to reconcile her father's house with her husband's ; Curiace is a gentle but equally heroic lover; Horace himself, the typical Roman, shows a courage which 'tient un pew du barbare,' and he prefers the death of his sister to hearing her pour curses on his city. These are not human beings, they are not even Romans, as has been well said, so much as ' personnifications varies de l'h^roisme.' But the old Horace is the acme, nay, the incarnation, of this heroic stoicism, this complete sub jugation to the sense of duty of all the softer feelings and passions. In his grim satisfaction at the choice of his sons as Rome's champions, in his stern acquiescence in the glorious death of two of them, and in his fierce feeling of humiliation at the remaining one's disgraceful flight which bursts forth in the famous ' Qu'il mourut ! ',"], [289, "PLERRE CORNEILLE 277 finally, in his defence of his daughter's barbarous murderer, \u2014 in all these cases cannot be seen a single weakness, a single trait that shows a deviation from the strict path of duty he has marked out for himself. In the other tragedies the same characteristics are to be found. Don Diegue is a fainter prototype of the old Horace. Rodrigue and his beloved Chimene are martyrs to their filial piety, as Horace is to his patriotism and Polyeucte to his religious belief. All are heroic, even the villains. Even Felix, the most worldly-wise and selfish, and therefore the most human of his characters, comes forward at the end with a highly heroic de termination to embrace the religion of the martyred Polyeucte. As for his female characters, ' Corneille connaissait peu les femmes.' That magnificent ' litotes ' of Chimene, ' Va, je ne te hais point ! ' is an almost unique example of the principles of reason and duty yielding to the influence of the tender passion. But Chimene herself, the 'adorable furie' \u00c6milie, the chaste and faithful Pauline, are all ready to sacrifice their love, or if need be their lover, at the altar of duty. ' Leur amour est subtil, combine, alambique, et sort plus de la tete que du c\u0153ur,' says Sainte-Beuve, and this is a just criticism. Love, which forms the chief motif in Racine, is only used by Corneille to enhance the triumph of duty over every other human feeling. The heroes are no ardent lovers ready to give up everything for their mistress's love.

One does not see in his plays, as in those of the ' myriad-minded ' Shakespeare, a gallery of eternally human and eternally true types. Corneille's merit lies in the perfection of his style, and the noble and sustained dignity of his characters, which make his works, in the words of La Harpe, ' une ecole de grandeur d'ame.' His characters are so pure and lofty, their aims so noble, their standard so high, their will so mighty, and their language so spirited ; they are, hi a word, such true heroes and heroines ; the lessons that Corneille teaches are so sublime ; such glory is shed upon honour, chivalry, manliness, self-sacrifice and duty, upon everything great and good and generous in man, that all honour and praise are due to Corneille, not only from the French, as the father of French tragedy and the founder of French comedy, but from all hero-worshippers, as a father of heroes and ideal men, firm in the storm of angry passions as Horace's ideal, and calm in their resolve as the Sage in Lucretius. ' Si fractus illabatur orbis, Impavidum ferient ruin\u00e6,' said Horace ; ' Le trouble de mon c\u0153ur ne petit rien sur mon ame,' says Corneille.

JEAN RACINE (1639- 1 699) Jean Racine was born at La Ferte-Milon on the 21st of December 1639. He studied Latin at the College of Beauvais, and Greek under Claude Lancelot of Port- Royal, where, in the space of one year, he read through the whole of Euripides, and where he received a reli gious education which left its mark upon his whole life. An ode called ' La Nymphe de la Seine,' in honour of Louis xiv.'s marriage (1660), was Racine's first pro duction, and delighted the King so much that a present of 100 louis was made to the poet, and soon afterwards a pension of 600 livres a year was settled on him for life. Theology and jurisprudence were quite unsuited to his taste ; but of the two he preferred theology, which he studied for some time in deference to the wishes of"], [292, "JEAN RACINE 280 an uncle. In a letter to La Fontaine he says, ' I pass my time with my uncle, St. Thomas, Vergil and Ariosto.' In 1664 he returned to Paris, where he made the acquaintance of Moliere and Boileau. He showed Moliere a tragedy that he had taken from his favourite Greek novel, ' Theogenes and Chariclea.' The great actor and author thought the play bad, but encouraged the young author by giving him a hundred livres, and suggesting the plot of 'La Theba'ide ou les Freres Ennemis,' which was acted by Moliere's company at the Palais-Royal (1664), and met with some success. Next year Racine wrote 'Aiexandre,' a play which elicited from jealous Corneille the remark that 'Racine had great talent for poetry, but none for tragedy.' ' Andromaque ' (1667), which was called ' Racine's Cid,' was a masterpiece, and inaugurated a series of masterpieces. These were 'Les Plaideurs' (1668), a satirical comedy, and Racine's only contribution to Comedy, ' Britannicus ' (1669), which Voltaire called ' la piece des connaisseurs,' ' Berenice' (1670), ' Bajazet ' (1672), 'Mithridate' (1673), 'Iphigenie en Aulide' (1674), and ' Phedre ' (1677). ' Britannicus ' was not at first a success, owing chiefly to the adverse criticisms of Corneille, who had grown jealous of his rival, and complained that Racine's characters were casts (' refontes ') of those of his own plays, \u2014 a childish piece of criticism, but one perhaps excusable owing to Corneille's advanced years. Disheartened by the injustice and bitterness of his"], [293, "JEAN RACINE 281 critics and the coterie of the Due de Nevers, who had the face to compare Pradon to him as a tragedian, and tormented by religious scruples on account of his con nection with the stage, then loudly condemned by the Church, Racine ceased to write plays, in spite of the friendly encouragement of Boileau, who addressed to him an Epistle ' Sur lUtilite\" des Ennemis,' one of the great critic's best epistles. But after a space of twelve years, during which Racine had married and been appointed historiographer to the King, with Boileau as his colleague, he wrote at the request of Mme de Maintenon a religious play, ' Esther ' (1689), for the officers' daughters of the School of St. Cyr, who acted the play before Louis xiv. The success of 'Esther' induced Racine to write 'Athalie.' This play was produced in 1691 ; but, contrary to the poet's reasonable and well-founded expectation, it failed to gain the approval which was accorded to it by a later and more discerning generation. ' Le tendre Racine ' bowed his head under this fresh injustice, which he felt as a punishment for his return to the stage. He de voted himself to his children and to his religious duties. His last days were saddened by the loss of royal favour, in consequence of his having laid before Mme de Main tenon a too truthful memoir on the pitiable condition of France, ruined by the wars of the ' Roi-Soleil.' Voltaire called ' Athalie ' ' le chef-d'\u0153uvre de l'esprit humain,' and ' Britannicus ' ' la piece des connaisseurs.' All Racine's tragedies might equally well be called ' pieces de connaisseurs'; for they are all composed with profound"], [294, "JEAN RACINE 282 and delicate art, and with a scholarly interpretation of history. Of all his works, Racine preferred ' Pheclre,' in which, he says in his preface, he made the exaltation of virtue and the punishment of crime his chief object. 'Corneille,' according to La Bruyere, 'cannot be equalled in those passages where he excels ; he is then inimitable.

' Racine, on the other hand, is always at his best, both in the plot and his management of the various scenes of his plays, which are regular, natural and judicious, and in his versification, which is elegant and harmonious.' The great difference between Corneille and Racine lies in the fact that, whereas the former makes us accept his characters and his ideas, the latter enters into our own feelings. ' Cor neille depicts men as they should be, Racine such as they actually exist. The one elevates, astonishes, over powers and instructs us, the other pleases us and appeals to our sensibility. Corneille is more moral, Racine more natural. It would seem as if the former imitated Sophocles, the latter Euripides.' Voltaire considered Racine the most perfect of French poets. In fact he was so enthusiastic about him that, when asked why he did not write a * Com mentaire' on Racine such as he had composed on Corneille, he replied, ' It is done already : one has but"], [295, "Jean raCine 283 to write at the foot of each page, Beautiful, pathetic harmonious, sublime.'

Critics (and especially young critics) should beware of dealing severely with such names as those of Corneille and Racine. The French are well aware of the weak points of their great men ; but reputations that have endured for over two centuries in their own native land surely rest upon firm foundations, and should be carefully handled by foreigners. What should we say to a Southerner who summed up his criticism of our Shake speare by the three words, ' Coarse, revolting, bar barous ' ? No better model of adverse criticism can be given than the following words of a great critic of the present century, Sainte-Beuve ; their moderation will be noticed, especially if it be remembered that Sainte- Beuve was one of the Romantic School that revolted at the beginning of this century, under the leadership of Victor Hugo, against the ' Classical ' style and method, i.e. against the style and method of Corneille and Racine.

The French conception of the classical treatment of Tragedy is founded on the idea of the necessity of observing the three so-called Unities of Aristotle. It will therefore be necessary to examine what these three unities are, whether the French poets have in reality overcome the difficulty of observing them without the sacrifice of freedom and probability, and finally, whether the merit of this_ observance is as great as has been supposed, or does not rather entail the sacrifice of still more essential beauties. These three unities are those of Action, Time, and Place. It is amusing to see Aristotle quoted in support of these unities, since the unity of Action is the only one which he treats with any detail ; on the unity of Time he only throws out a vague hint, and of the unity of Place he says not a syllable ; so much for the support of Aristotle, on whom the French father their ideas."], [298, "286 THE 'THREE UNITIES' IN TRAGEDY With respect to the Unity of Action it is generally allowed to be essential; but its interpretation is very wide. The French have adopted the rule in x its narrowest possible sense. Aristotle says Action. in his Poetics, ' In the case of bodies and animals, to be beautiful, they must be of a certain size, but of a size easily taken in by the eye; so with the plots of tragedies, they should be of a certain length, yet easily grasped by the memory.' Judging by this remark we may conclude that Aristotle meant by the unity of action such a unity as is displayed in ' Hamlet,' where we see a variety in one theme, viz. the fixed resolve of Hamlet to convict the king of his crime and take vengeance on him. This one idea runs through the whole play; it is the idea on which his mind preys so persistently that his reason totters on the verge of insanity. Yet whilst this unity is admitted by the greatest German and English critics, no play could be more opposed to French ideas respecting the unities. The unities of time, place and action are all violated: the action of the play extends over several months; the scene changes continually, and such episodes as that of Ophelia are introduced, having no union with the main idea of revenge, though in reality nothing could serve more admirably to delineate the change of character wrought by this fixed idea. There is much to be urged against the French conception of the unity of Action ; but what can be said for the other two unities of time and place ? It may be noticed that the Unity of Time, though"], [299, "THE 'THREE UNITIES' IN TRAGEDY 287 generally observed, was by no means always observed by the Greek Tragedians, though the French critics of the XVIIth and XVIIIth centuries, with superficial know ledge, pretended that such was the case. In the ' Trachini\u00e6 ' of Sophocles, during the course of the play, the voyage from Eub\u0153a is thrice performed ; and other instances may be cited from the ' Agamemnon,' the ' Supplices,' and the ' Eumenides.' As regards the Unity of Place, any one with a slight acquaintance with the construction and arrangement of the Greek theatre would know that ex- tensive changes of scene were very difficult, but that such changes as were possible they availed themselves of, as in their use of the ' eccyclema.' The scene is changed in ' Ajax,' and also in the ' Eumenides,' in which the action takes place alternately at Delphi and at Athens. But Greek was probably unknown to any of the tragic writers of France before Racine. They imitated Seneca ; and it is only because Seneca himself imitated the Greeks, that Jodelle, Garnier, Hardy can be said to have followed Greek models: and Seneca generally observed the Unities. The argument urged in support of these two unities was that their violation would dispel the illusion ; but this arises from an error in the theory of art. The actions are not presented to the spectators as realities : all know the Horatii have long been dead; all know they did not speak modern French. Surely if the imagination can be transported back more than 2000 years, and to such a totally different scene, sufficient"], [300, "288 THE 'THREE UNITIES' IN TRAGEDY imagination is possessed to conceive the lapse of a few days, weeks or years, and a change of scene as taking place between two scenes or acts. Voltaire tries to derive the three unities from the unity of action, but his reasoning is extremely shallow. He says : ' The unity of place is essential, because no one action can go on in several places at once.' This is true, but totally irrelevant, while his remark on the Unity of Time, that ' if a poet represents a conspiracy and extends the action to four teen days, he must account for all that takes place during that time,' could only be made with a total miscon ception of dramatic art. Is the poet to show his characters eating, sleeping, and performing acts which in no way help on the action of the play ? Clearly not ; his duty is to seize those salient features and incidents which do conduce to the progress of the action. When it is considered that in the majority of French Tragedies the subject is classical, and that the actors were dressed in the costume of the period, with powdered wigs, and that they performed on a stage on which distinguished members of the audience were seated, \u2014 to say that a change of scene would destroy the illusion is supremely ridiculous. Moreover, by limiting the action to the space of a few hours, or at most a day, French authors are much limited in their choice of subjects, and the sub ject itself loses much of its interest. Consider such a play as ' Macbeth ' treated in the French style. We should have only the last scene presented to us, and this would then have to be spun out. At the same time we should lose the great lesson shown in the"], [301, "THE ' THREE UNITIES' IN TRAGEDY 289 gradual corruption of a mind by evil insinuations. Voltaire in his prefaces speaks more than once of the difficulty of procuring materials for his tragedies suffi cient to fill five long acts. This is not surprising; a large number of important events cannot happen within a few minutes of each other ; yet if this is so, how is an audience to be interested ? This leads to one of the gravest defects in form of French tragedies, namely, the long declamatory passages, when all action is com pletely at a standstill, such passages moreover having not the slightest resemblance to real life. It will be worth while also to notice a few violations of the observance of the unity of place. In the ' Cid ' the scene of action manifestly changes several times ; this led in part to the opposition directed against it by Richelieu and the critics ; yet the unanimous judgment of the audience was in favour of this play. But the most extraordinary absurdities, in the attempt to pre serve the Unity of Place, were committed. So strong was the respect of Richelieu himself and his collabor ators for this Unity, that in the Tuileries Gardens a despairing lover, bent on putting an end to his existence, does not feel justified in leaving the Gardens to throw himself into the Seine fifty yards away; he has to drown himself in the pond in order to obey ' Aristotle.' In Voltaire's ' Semiramis ' a similar instance occurs : the Cabinet, in which the scene of Act in. is laid, to use Voltaire's own words, ' gives way to a grand saloon,' the queen, be it observed, remaining present the whole time. The mausoleum, which at first stood in the open place cr"], [302, "THE 'THREE UNITIES' IN TRAGEDY 290 before the palace, has contrived to get into this hall close to the throne. In the next act it is found in its old place. What a collection of absurdities! Surely it would have been better to let the persons go to the different places instead of bringing the places to the persons. In ' Brutus ' there is another example of the scene running about. The scene, indeed, in other plays does not change, but the improbability is greatly in creased thereby. As to the form of verse adopted for tragedy, nothing could have been more unfortunate; the Alexandrine, with its couplets and hemistichs of equal length, is a very uniform and monotonous form of verse, and far better adapted for the expression of antithetical maxims than for the musical delineation of passion, with its unequal, abrupt, and erratic course of thought. The origin of the rule of the Three Unities, so tersely summed up in Boileau's two lines, is obscure ; but the responsibility seems to lie with Cardinal Richelieu. The rule was in vogue with the comedy-writers of Italy in the early part of the six teenth century, Machiavelli and Cardinal Da Bibbiena. It is said that Chapelain suggested it to the Cardinal author, who was fascinated with the idea and imposed it upon his collaborators. It is not astonishing that the conception of a grand unity in drama should have found favour with the minister whose one aim in his home policy had ever been the unity of France. He crushed the Protestants as a political party, because they formed ' a state within the state ' ; and he crushed the Nobility"], [303, "THE ' THREE UNITIES' IN TRAGEDY 291 who wished to establish themselves as feudal potentates in their dominions, as independent from the Crown as their German brethren across the Rhine ; these two obstacles to the unity of France were obstacles to her greatness. The ' Three Unities,' therefore, pleased Riche lieu, who decided that Mairet should set the example ; so 'Sophonisbe,' the first tragedy 'selon les regies,' was produced (1629), and all the tragedies of Richelieu and his collaborators were written on the same pattern. The comedians consented with much regret to offer this learned simplicity to a public accustomed to change of scene and variety of scenery connected with the diversity of incidents and adventures. But the strong minded Cardinal persisted : he not only put these rules of Unity into practice, but he made them absolute rules for the drama, and had them propounded as such by the dramatic theorist, the Abbe d'Aubignac, who gratui tously placed them under the shield and authority of Aristotle. Cardinal Richelieu, whom Chapelain inspired with the design of imposing upon the French stage the Unities of time and place, decided that Mairet should set the example ; and from this time the Three Unities came to be recognised as essential in French drama; and Corneille, Racine, and Voltaire all bowed their heads under the yoke, though they bitterly complained of its weight. Two tragedies only, Corneille's ' \u0152dipe a Colone ' and Racine's ' Athalie ' succeeded in bringing together with any show of probability, in the space of the same few hours and in the same spot, the different"], [304, "MOI.LERE 292 characters of the same action with all its subsidiary incidents. French Tragedy remained cramped by these absurd rules until the revolt of the Romanticists. It is against these artificial trammels that Victor Hugo and his followers of the Cenacle rose up in arms at the beginning of this century. In the preface to his 'Cromwell,' the Voltaire of the nineteenth century hurled his manifesto against the Classicists. Following on the steps of Shake speare and Goethe, he boldly recognised only the Unity of Action or Interest of ' l'ensemble ' (das Fassliche), and in his verse threw to the winds the rules of Malherbe concerning the c\u00e6sura and ' en jambement' or overlapping of the sentence into the following line. The war was declared at the first representation of ' Hernani ' (1830), and a fierce struggle raged for some months, and not a few enthusiastic heads were broken. But Victor Hugo won the day. Like most reformers, he undoubtedly went too far ; yet it must be admitted that he has conferred upon the tragic stage of France an inestimable boon.1 MOLIERE (1622-1673) Jean-Baptiste Poquelin (such was Moliere's real name) was born in Paris in January 1622. His father was 1 See the Essay on Romanticism, p. 349."], [305, "MOLIERE 293 upholsterer and valet to the King, and in easy circum stances.

He first acquired a and PIays liking for the theatre through his grandfather, who was an ardent playgoer. As he grew up he became dis contented, and longed for a liberal education, Avhich his father granted him, much against his will. He was sent to the Jesuit College de Clermont in Paris, where he had as a fellow-pupil the Prince de Conti, and on leaving school he attended for some time the lectures of the sensualist philosopher Gassendi.1 He was charmed by the freedom of thought permitted in speculative science, and, in particular, conceived a great admiration for Lucretius, the Roman poet-philosopher, whom he undertook to translate. Of his translation only a single passage remains, intercalated in the second act of 'Le Misanthrope.' About 1641 he commenced the study of law, and appears to have been even called to the bar at Orleans. At the age of twenty, Poquelin probably entered on his service as royal valet de chambre. Corneille's tragedy the 'Cid,' published in 1636, had electrified France ; acting and actors, from being looked down upon, became popular, and private theatricals came into fashion. Poquelin renounced his father's trade at twenty-one, and now his dramatic career began. About 1645 he was led to associate 1 The spiritualist philosopher \"Descartes apostrophised him in the following terms : ' Oh ! chair !

He became the head of ' l'lllustre Theatre,' and assumed the name of Moliere with or without the ' de! It was Corneille's ' Menteur' (1644) that finally interested him in Comedy. He had a great desire to succeed as a writer of tragedies; but, though he wrote several, they are now all forgotten. Owing to the troubled state of Paris during the Fronde (1648-1652) under the Queen Regent (1648-1661), and his lack of success in the capital, he went Moliere in x the Provinces to the provinces with his company, and at Lyons between 1653 and 1655 produced ' L'Etourdi,' his first piece, and a successful one. ' Le Depit Amoureux ' quickly followed. Very little reliable information is found concerning this period of the great dramatist's career; he seems, however, to have combined acting with diligent study: he read Plautus, Terence, Rabelais, the old French comedies and farces, and the Italian and Spanish comedies. At all events, after touring in the provinces for twelve years, he returned to Paris, where, upon the powerful Moiiere in recommendation of his old school-fellow the pans, 1658. Prince de Conti, he obtained leave to act before King Louis xiv. This was the beginning of his greatness : he now had a permanent company and a theatre ; for spectators he had the Court and Paris ; for patron, the King. His company now took the"], [307, "MOLIERE 295 title of ' Troupe de Monsieur,' i.e. of the King's brother. Parisian society offered to the ' Contemplateur,' as his friend Boileau called him, many subjects for ridicule, and the first he attacked was the preciosite or ' euphuism ' of the blue-stockings, who had exaggerated the pedantic affectation of the Hotel de Rambouillet. Les Pr^cieuses Ridicules (1659) marked a new de parture in Moliere' s work; he ceased to pick out fragments of Menander, and in order to depict men studied those who lived under his own eyes. This fine satire was instantly perceived and relished. ' Courage, Moliere ! ' cried an old man on its first representation, ' voild la veritable comidie ! ' Manage, the famous grammarian and etymologist, is reported to have quoted on the same occasion to Chapelain, the fashionable poet and president of the French Academy, the words of Saint-Remi to Clovis : ' Henceforth we must burn what we have adored, and adore what we have burnt.' He now became the chief contributor to the gaieties of the brilliant Court of ' Le Roi-Soleil,' who, when he took into his own hands the reins of government after the death of Mazarin (1661), showed the poet something more than a disdainful and frivolous protection; he displayed towards him an intelligent affection and sympathy, in which no break occurred until the poet's death in 1673. In 1662, at the age of forty, Moliere married, to his misfortune, a young girl of sixteen, Armande Bejart, a young sister of Madeleine Bejart, one of the actresses of"], [308, "MOLIERE 296 his company ; the frivolous Armande now acted under the name of Mademoiselle Moliere, and is the prototype of the poet's Cdimene. His married life was very un happy, and he was obliged after some time to separate from his wife, whom he dearly loved despite her faults. ' Le Tartuffe ' was Moliere's favourite play ; but he experienced great difficulty in getting permission to perform it, the Clergy taking umbrage at the religious hypocrisy satirised in the chief character. In 1666 he finished 'Le Misanthrope,' which has since been recognised as his masterpiece. He was now at the height of his fame. In 1665 Louis xiv. had bestowed a pension of 7000 livres on his company, which now called itself the ' Troupe du Roi ' ; and he continued acting and producing plays in rapid succession, among which are ' L'Avare,' ' Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme,' ' Les Femmes Savantes' (on the same subject as his ' Pr6cieuses Ridicules '), and the ' Malade Imaginaire,' which he was acting when he died, 1673. Owing to the hostility of the Clergy, his wife had the greatest difficulty in obtaining for him a decent burial. He was never admitted to the Academy, because he refused to sever himself from his theatre and the company of actors of which he was the father and the mainstay, but the Academicians of the XVIIIth century endeavoured to atone for the folly of their predecessors, and a bust of Moliere was placed in their hall with the motto : 'Rien ne manque a sa gloire, il manquait a la notre.' Seven years after his death, his company, uniting"], [309, "MOLLERE 297 with that of the Marais and that of the Hotel de Bourgogne, formed that which retains at the present day the title of ' La Troupe du Theatre Frangais.'

BOILEAU-DESPREAUX (1636-1711) Nicolas Boileau was the third son of a clerk in the High Court of Justice in Paris called the ' Parlement? and was intended for the law ; but he turned from its subtleties and chicaneries to the Church, only to experience a similar disillusion. At the age of sixteen, however, he lost his father, and the small competence that he inherited left him free to indulge his literary taste. He assumed the name of Despreaux, associated himself with the great writers of the day, and composed in 1660 his first satire, to which in 1666 he had added six others. Boileau was an ardent imitator of Horace ; and so, like him, he followed his satires by a number of Epistles (1669-1674), in which he shows much greater ease in his style, while his"], [312, "BOLLE A U-DESPREA UX 300 subject and aim are much the same as those of his satires. Between 1669 and 1674 his 'Art Poetique' appeared, which, however, is little more than a verse translation of Horace's ' Ars Poetica ', mutatis mutandis. In 1674 he published the first four cantos of 'Le Lutrin,' a mock-heroic poem written to show that any trivial subject could be helped out by the imagination and made the subject of a poem. He was early presented at Court, where he succeeded in eaininss and retaining all his life the favour of Louis XIV., who assigned him a pension, and appointed him, together with his friend Racine, royal historio grapher. But Boileau was no courtier, and preferred to live in the quiet retirement of his little house at Auteuil, then outside Paris, where he enjoyed the delightful society of the Jansenist philosophers Arnauld and Nicole, of the ' bonhomme ' Lafontaine, of the quiet ' Contemplateur ' Moliere, and especially of the gentle Racine, who, with his children, was his constant guest. Nevertheless, before the King and Mme de Maintenon, in a Court under the influence of the Jesuits, he bluntly said in defence of the Jansenists words that frightened Racine. The last years of the poet were sad : he had lost all his dear friends, \u2014 Moliere in 1673, Lafontaine in 1695, and Racine in 1699 ; he was deaf and nearly blind when he died in the house of his Jansenist confessor in 1711.

His Work. It must not be forgotten that, though this ' Golden Age ' of French literature produced unrivalled masterpieces, it produced also a countless number of worthless works in prose and verse, which a modern reader is surprised at finding in the same century. But still more astonishing is the bad taste which prevailed at the time, and placed such works as those of Scudery, Mairet, Chapelain, Pradon, Quinault on the same level as those of Corneille, Racine and Moliere. Indeed, the partisans of the ' Modernes ' in the famous ' Querelle des Anciens et des Modernes,' did not hesitate to follow their bold leader, Ch. Perrault, the author of charming fairy tales, in his professed preference for Quinault and others not only to Corneille, Racine and Moliere, but to Homer and Pindar ! Italian affectation or Spanish pomposity were the order of the day ; ' pr^ciosite,' or ' euphuism,' that had done so much to ' devulgariser la langue,' had fallen into the other extreme, and had put into fashion in comprehensible nonsense and sublimated affectation. It was the lot of Boileau to show the golden mean, and to teach the public to sift the tares from the wheat; and, strange to say, in nearly every case his judgment on contemporary writers has been endorsed by pos terity; one can only regret that either contempt or ignorance of old French poetry led him to disparage it in his works. He was the Malherbe of the age of"], [314, "BOLLE A U-DESPREA UX 302 ' Le Roi-Soleil,' and the continuer of the work of the great reformer, or rather founder, of the modern French tongue. It was by satires and epigrams that Boileau taught his literary lessons. Chapelain, President of the French Academy, who was thought by some the His Weapons. \u201e \u201e , .. , , .\u201e first poet of the day, had written an epic on ' La Pucelle ' (the Maid of Orleans). Boileau boldly wrote : ' Maudit soit l'auteur dur dont l'apre et rude verve Son cerveau tenaillant, rima inalgre Minerve, Et de son lourd marteau martelant le bon sens, A fait de mediants vers douze fois douze cents.' The cleverness of this witty parody and criticism can be seen by the extract from La Pucelle quoted in the footnote.1 ' I repeat in verse,' he said, to justify him self, ' what everybody says in prose : I am the secretary of the public' And as such the public joyfully accepted him.

They represent the spirit of exactness and precision which Descartes and Pascal had shown in philosophy, science and mathematics, and which they applied to literature and art. In satire, both attacked the same faults, particularly the small literary men of the day ; but Pope was full of venom, and took a savage delight in attacking all whom he conceived to have injured him ; whereas Boileau never attacked the private life of those whom he pilloried, though he did once say : ' J'appelle un chat un chat et Rollet un fripon.' He displayed no violent and ungovernable outbursts of hate such as may be found in the ' Dunciad.' Pope's best work, ' The Rape of the Lock,' was probably imitated from ' Le Lutrin,' an episode in which may be regarded as the original of Swift's ' Battle of the Books.'"], [316, "BO I LE A U-DESPREA UX 304 Boileau is, above all, the author of the ' Art Poetique.' He was the first who understood that for a work to be good, it must be subjected to certain fixed His Teaching. , , , , \u2022 . laws ; these he drew up and put into verse ; hence his surname of ' Legislateur du Parnasse.' What were these principles ? First of all, Boileau is the ' poete du bon sens ' : ' Aimez done la raison : que toujours vos Merits Empruntent d'elle seule et leur lustre et leur prix And again, ' Au depens du bon sens gardez de plaisanter, Jamais de la nature il ne faut s'ecarter.' Boileau preached simplicity and ' Realism ' in the highest meaning of the word. Truth and Nature should ever be followed : ' Rien n'est beau que le vrai ; le vrai seul est aimable.' In his IXth Epistle, which treats this theme almost exclusively, he says : 'Le faux est toujours fade, ennuyeux, languissant : Mais la nature est vraie . . . ' ' La simplicity plait sans etude et sans art.' For style, Boileau's words are on every French master's lips: 1 II faut que chaque chose y soit mise en son lieu, Que le debut, la fin repondent au milieu, Que d'un art delicat les pieces assorties N'y forment qu'un seul tout de diverses parties.'

' La rime est une esclave et ne doit qu'obeir.' In other words, ' tout ce qui n'est pas clair n'est pas francais.' In propounding these theories, Boileau merely em bodied the practical teachings of his illustrious con temporaries. Did not Moliere write 'lorsque vous peignez des hommes, il faut peindre d'apres nature ' ? and Lafontaine : ' Et maintenant il ne faut pas Quitter la nature d'un seul pas ' ; and Racine : ' le gout de Paris s'est trouv6 d'accord avec le gout d'Athenes ' ? In a similar way, Boileau put into two terse hues the famous theory of the Three Unities prevalent at the time : ' Qu'en un lieu, qu'en un jour, un seul fait accompli Tienne jusqu'a la fin le theatre rempli.' But above all, Boileau is the critic ' du bon gout ' : anything low, anything unrefined, was pitilessly scouted : Scarron's travesty of Vergil was in his eyes a monstrous sacrilege, which he bluntly denounced in the presence of the King and of Scarron's widow, the morganatic wife of the King, the famous Mme de Maintenon. He even went so far as to charge his friend Moliere with vulgar buffoonery : ' Moliere,' he says, ' . . . -a fait souvent grimacer ses figures, Quitte pour le bouffon l'agr^able et le fin Et sans honte k T&ence allie Tabarin.

It is most probable that Racine acquired from him that hypercritical taste which led him to his perfection of style. It may be interesting to note, however, that in matters of private life Boileau was less successful : when Moliere's affection of the lungs was undermining his health, Boileau urged the actor-manager and poet to avoid the strain of performing himself, but in vain ; and Moliere died, a victim to his art. Again, when Racine, heart-broken at the unjust criticism of his ' Phedre,' gave up writing for the stage in 1677, Boileau's efforts to turn him were fruitless. La Bruyere, one of Boileau's contemporaries, said of him : ' II passe Juvenal, atteint Horace, semble cr\u00a3er les Apprecia- pensees d'autrui, et se rendre propre tout ce tions. qu'il manie ; . . . ses vers fort harmonieux, faits de g^nie, quoique travailles avec art, pleins de traits et de poesie, seront lus encore quand la langue aura vieilli, en seront les derniers debris.

Voltaire tersely sums up his work by the words : ' Boileau a tres bien fait ce qu'il voulait faire et tres bien dit ce qu'il voulait dire.' As a man of strict common sense, Boileau exercised an influence for good, not only in literature, but even in science: for he was one of the most prominent opponents of the bigoted and Jesuitical Churchmen who tried to continue the policy of their Italian brethren towards Galileo ; in 1674, he took up arms against the excommunication of the ideas of Descartes, Gassendi and of Harvey, who had just discovered the circulation of the blood, and was entirely successful in the struggle.

It begins to search for the elementary principles of society, as they may be discovered by the light of Reason and the law of Nature, and to test the grounds of religious belief: for this is the age of Fontenelle, Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and of the Encyclo pedia, the age that culminated in the French Revolu tion, with its motto ' Liberte, JEgalite, Fraternity,' and its worship of Reason as a divinity.

In 1685 the Edict of Nantes had been revoked, and Protestants exposed to persecution. But on the throne sat a monarch surrounded by a halo of military and literary glory unparalleled in the annals of France ; and the Church was represented by great, earnest, and noble characters, such as Bossuet, Fenelon, Massillon, Bourdaloue and Flechier. At his death (1715) a lamentable reaction of immorality and atheism set in, personified by the Duke of Orleans, now Regent of France for the infant Kino- Louis xv. His Court, and afterwards that of Louis xv., were an abomination, and the higher Clergy were often open profligates : the glories of the Church had departed, and it indeed sank in an inverse ratio to the growing enlightenment of the age. It exhibited the most cruel spirit of persecution. In February 1762 a Protestant pastor Rochette was hanged in Toulouse for having exercised his ministry in Languedoc. Soon after, Calas was, in spite of Voltaire, broken on the wheel on the false accusation of having killed his son in order to prevent his turning Catholic, and his family were subjected to torture. Both the monarchy and religion fell into disrepute, and the ground was ready to receive the seed stealthily but surely sown by the hand of the great writers."], [323, "THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 311 The severity exercised by the Censorship against men of letters and the propagation of new ideas was as great in the XVIIIth century as during the absolute rule of le Roi-Soleil ; it will be remembered that it was only through Boileau's earnest intervention that Descartes' 'Discours de la Methode' was saved from being burnt by the hang man. All new ideas were looked upon as dangerous, even the most certain and demonstrable conclusions of science. Cardinal Polignac, a fashionable Latin poet of that day, had, in his ' Anti- Lucretius,' denounced Newton's discovery of universal gravitation as a dangerous reminiscence of Democritus and Epicurus. Voltaire's ' Lettres Philosophiques' were burnt by the hangman, and so was Rousseau's ' \u00a3mile ' ; Voltaire was twice imprisoned in the Bastille, and exiled ; Diderot was imprisoned for his 'Lettre sur les Aveugles,' and Jean- Jacques Rousseau only escaped a like fate by flight. In 1757, after the publication of the 'Esprit des Lois' (1748), at the zenith of Voltaire and Rousseau's popularity, a Royal Declaration inflicted the penalty of death upon whoever should write or print anything hostile to the established religion or government. This danger surrounded the persecuted writers with the halo of martyrdom; it made them conceal their attacks under the witty and attractive form that charac terises the period, whilst it gave the zest of forbidden fruit to works that had to be published abroad and secretly imported.

It is in England that the origin of the French philosophical movement is to be sought : it was from England that Montesquieu brought home his politics, Condillac his sensualism and Jean-Jacques Rousseau his philosophy. Montesquieu, Voltaire, and Jean-Jacques came over to England, and were amazed at the toleration and freedom enjoyed in religious as well as political matters; they found Bolingbroke's views and the Scotch school of sceptic philosophy established ; they found the sugges tions of their own common sense and their theories of reform realised and practised in a civilised and powerful country.

' En Angleterre, liberte et egalite,' wrote Montesquieu, and this became the motto of the French Revolution. From France these doctrines spread abroad. Not only did the greatest sovereigns in Europe admire and correspond with Voltaire and Diderot, Universal but French philosophers were attracted to 'ilflue\"ct,!fI 1 1 French Philo royal courts abroad. Inspired by Voltaire, soPhy. D'Aranda in Spain, and Pombal in Portugal, expelled the Jesuits. Pombal caused the works of Voltaire and Diderot to be translated into the Portuguese language. Did not the Corsicans and the Poles ask Jean-Jacques Rousseau to give them a constitution ? Thus, through the medium of England, the spirit of the Reformation, degenerating into scepticism, made itself felt, thanks to the genius of Voltaire and his school, among the most bigoted nations of Europe. The influence of women and of their salons is a most remarkable feature of this century : it was owing to these fashionable salons, as it had been in The Salons. the early part of the Golden Age, that the writers exercised their influence upon society. The ' Court of Sceaux,' over which the Duchesse du Maine reigned, represents the craving for light amusement and frivolity that made itself felt in the last years of Louis xiv.'s reign. The salon of the Marquise de Saint-Lambert represents the revival of the spirit of"], [326, "GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF 314 'preciosity From 1690 to 1730 she fought for morality and refinement; d'Argenson, Marivaux, Fontenelle, Mile de Launay, Mme de Caylus, belonged to her circle, where philosophy and politics were barely men tioned. The salon of the wealthy Mme Geoffrin is the salon of the Encyclopedia and of the philosophers : her guests received pensions; and it is said that the Encyclopedia cost her a hundred thousand crowns. It is, however, the salon of Mme du Deffand that best personifies the spirit of the age : no heart, perpetual scoffing, and incurable ennui. Her infatuation at sixty eight years of age for Horace Walpole is well known. Voltaire, Montesquieu and d'Alembert frequented her drawing-room. Mile de Lespinasse, who had helped Mme du Deffand, started in 1764 a salon of her own, which represented another feature of the century : she belongs to the romantic and sentimental period whose spokesman is Rousseau. The atheistic meetings of Baron d'Holbach, and finally the political salons of Necker on the eve of the Revolution, are the last links between these polished societies and the countless swarms of clubs and revolu tionary societies of those tragic times, the most famous of which are the Jacobins and the Cordeliers.

These highly popular letters, of a frivolous and slightly licentious, but observant and philosophical nature, were published in Holland. They ' Lettres Persanes,' 1721. satirised society during the early days of the Regency of the Duke of Orleans (1715-1723), and introduced into literature that political satire which became so powerful a weapon in the hands of Voltaire. In 1728 he entered the French Academy, and now tra velled in Hungary, Italy, Switzerland, the Netherlands and England, gathering materials for the work he was meditating, and studying the manners and institutions of these different countries. His 'Considerations sur les causes de la grandeur des Romains et de leur decadence ' is the first work in which the philosophy of history ' Considera tions.' is applied, without borrowing from theology. Bossuet was his model ; but, according to Bossuet, all the events of history are explained by the will of God, whilst with Montesquieu the power of ideas, the action and reaction of causes and effects, are sufficient to explain the great events recorded in history. 'Ce n'est pas la fortune qui domine le monde,' he said. In his track were soon to follow the aged Rollin and Voltaire. But Montesquieu is the father of modern historical research. He was nearly sixty years of age when he published"], [329, "MONTESQUIEU 317 his wonderful ' Esprit des Lois ' (1748), at which he had been working for twenty years. Twenty- .

Apart from its literary value as a prose work of pure and energetic style that reminds one of Tacitus, ' V Esprit des Lois ' still holds a high place in the world of political theory. In his book he establishes the relation of Law to government, to liberty, to climate and geography to manners, commerce, population, and finally to religion. His plan included two ideas, the first to a certain extent attempted by Machiavelli, the second entirely new : he aimed at constructing a comparative theory of legislation and institutions adapted to the political needs of different forms of government, and a comparative theory of politics and laws based on a wide observation of the actual systems of different countries and ages. He shows that the mainspring or essential principle of the democratic or republican government is ' virtue,' i.e. patriotism and love of equality; of the monarchical government, honour; of the despotic government, fear.

And he was seldom without some fierce polemic on hand, in which his adversaries had to writhe for the amusement of the public, under the scourge of his envenomed wit and sarcasm. During this time, his tragedy 'Brutus' was acted, but with no marked success ; it showed too much Shakespearian freedom. He drew upon himself fresh persecution by his verses on the death of Mile Lecouvreur ; on the ground that the burial rites had been refused to the celebrated actress, he protested against superstition in France by a loud eulogium of English freedom. He had to publish clandestinely his admirable ' Histoire de Charles XII, roi de Suede' (Rouen and ' Histoire de Charles XII.,' 1731. Amsterdam, 1731). Soon after he put upon the stage ' Eriphyle ' (March 1732), imitated from ' Hamlet,' which was a failure; nothing daunted, five months after, he produced his great Christian tragedy ' Zaire ' (August 1732), the success of which crowned ' Zaire,' 1732- his reputation as a dramatic author.

These Letters were condemned to be burnt by the hangman, and the publisher was sent to the Bastille (1734). Voltaire was however left unmolested in Paris, where he wrote plays, and, amongst other Epistles, the delightfully graceful poem ' Des Vous et des Tu,' and a violent invective against the old Jean-Baptiste Rousseau, ' de la Calomnie!

In 1746 he had at last been elected a member of the French Academy.

The vanity of the 1 Crebillon (1674-1762), in his plays carried terror to a degree not far removed from the horrible and hideous.

For a few months both were charmed with one another. But the ' Marcus Aurelius ' of Potsdam had other literary stars around him, with whom Voltaire of course fell out, and the King did not always take his part: Maupertuis, the French President of Frederic's Academy of Sciences, was turned into ridicule in Voltaire's ' Diatribe du Dr. Akakia ' ; and this pamphlet was condemned to be burnt by the hangman's hand ; Voltaire wrote home to Mme Denis \u2014 and published \u2014 that he was growing sick of his trade of ' blanchisseur et teinturier,' of ' washing the King's dirty linen.'\u2014' On presse l'orange et on jette l'ecorce,' retorted Frederic. They quarrelled. In 1753 Voltaire obtained leave of absence, never intending to return, and started for France. At Frankfort, how ever, he was arrested on the charge of having purloined some of the King's ' poeshie ' ; he was roughly searched, detained for over a month, and submitted to daily in dignities, which he found it hard to forgive. During his stay in Prussia Voltaire had found time to finish his greatest historical work, ' Le Siecle de Louis XIV.'(Berlin,l752), to produce several Sii.cle de Louis plays, and to write articles for Diderot's XIV- I752' Encyclopedie (1751-1772), besides innumerable shorter Essays and Poems.

'La Guerre de Geneve,' in five cantos, is a bitter onslaught on Jean-Jacques.

On his return from exile he throws himself at the feet of Mme de Pompadour and even of Mme du Barri, degrades his fine genius by representing the vicious and profligate Louis xv. under the character of Trajan in the ' Temple de la Gloire' written for Versailles, and meanly stands in the King's way to court a smile or a word of ap proval, \u2014 which he never obtained.

Though treated with contumely by Frederic the Great, he forgot his grievances, pocketed the insult, and wrote to congratulate him on his victory at Rossbach.

In his childhood he spent his time reading an enormous number of novels, and poring over Plutarch's ' Lives ' : these novels fired his powerful imagination, but gave him utterly false notions of life, which experience and reflection never eradicated. Afterwards he learnt a little Latin, and read the best French authors. He was twenty -nine when he first went to Paris, with no other resources than those which he hoped to obtain from Rousseau, a new system for noting music with figures. pans, 1741- Reaumur and the old savant Fontenelle befriended him, but the Academy of Sciences rejected"], [351, "JEA N-JA CQUES RO US SEA U 339 the system as useless. A secretaryship abroad was obtained for him ; but he soon threw it up and returned in 1745 to Paris, where he earned a scanty living by copying music. He now made the acquaintance of Buff on, Grimm, and Diderot, who asked him for articles on music for the Encyclopedia, and became one of the guests of the ' Maitre d'hotel de la Philosophie,' the rich German atheist, Baron d'Holbach. Marmontel, another guest of the philosophical M\u00e6cenas, said of Rousseau at this time : ' Nobody better observed the dreary maxim to live with your friends as if they were one day to become your enemies. Yet, as his sensitive and irritable self-love was well known, he was treated with the same attentions as would have been bestowed on a pretty but vain and capricious woman, whom one might desire to please.' One day that he was bringing an article to Diderot, then imprisoned at Vincennes for his 'Lettres sur les Aveugles,' Rousseau saw by chance in the ' Mercure' newspaper the announcement of a competition opened by the Academy of Dijon on the question ' si le ritablissement des sciences et des lettres a contribue\" d corrompre ou cl epurer les m\u0153urs! He thought of supporting the cause of culture, but Diderot pointed out to him that the reverse would yield a far more striking essay, and accordingly Jean- ._ His Jacques with brilliant sophistry declared himself for Nature against Culture, against politeness and decorum, ' mere masks that conceal every character,' against sciences and letters, 'that are the"], [352, "JEAN-JACQUES ROUSSEAU 340 poisonous fruits of corruption.' ' What would Fabricius have said,' he exclaims in a celebrated passage, ' if he had seen the luxury of the Romans, whom he had saved of yore, and whom he had known so poor and so strong?' In 1750 the Academy of Dijon gave the prize to Rousseau's paradox ; and this success wedded Rousseau to a systematic hostility against society and civilisation, which he made responsible for all the vices and infirmities of man in general, and for his own shortcomings and cowardice in particular. He was thus close upon forty when fortune or rather fame thus smiled upon him for the first time : he had frittered away the exceptional chances that had been providentially put in his path, and the sharp lessons of life had embittered without enlightening him. He now wantonly refused a good position as a cashier, and insisted upon continuing to earn obscurely a scanty livelihood by copying music as before ; he persisted in this determination, despite the shrill outcry of the coarse hotel-servant to whom he had linked his life, and of her termagant mother, and despite the remon strances of his friends, which the misanthrope inter preted as part of a conspiracy of the whole world against himself. There is a remarkable uniformity in Rousseau's 1755. 'De works. Four years later, in another essay, iin<jgaiit6.'

'The first man who, having enclosed a piece of land, undertook to say, \"this belongs to one,\" and found people simple enough to believe him, was the true founder of civil society. What crimes, wars, mur ders and horrors would mankind have been spared, if a man had rooted up the stakes or filled in the ditch, and cried to his fellow-creatures : \" Do not listen to this impostor ; you are lost if you forget that the fruits of the earth are common property, and that land belongs to no man.\" ' Opposing for the second time Nature to Civilisation, Rousseau maintained that the latter made man wretched and guilty, whilst the primitive man, ' the savage,' was good, free and happy, and advocated the return to a chimerical ' state of nature.' Voltaire, in thanking him for a copy of it, said: 'Really, the reading of your work makes one anxious to go on all-fours! It did represent a weariness of wigged and powdered civilisation, that led many to glorify natural man as something greater than the same animal per verted by culture. Glorification of ' the noble savage ' now came into literature as one form of the reaction against the despotism of conventionality. Rousseau rejected the positive idea of duty, and made sensibility the rule of conduct. 'The heart is good,' he said; 'listen to it: suffer yourselves to be led by sensibility and you will never stray, or your strayings wffl be of a creditable sort.' A stream of sentiment, unwholesome at its source, and becoming yet more sickly as it flowed, now poured into literature."], [354, "JEAN-JACQUES ROUSSEAU 342 Jean-Jacques completed his condemnation of society and civilisation by his 'Lettre a d'Alembert sur les i758.

Vol taire from this time affected \u2014 and with a good show of reason \u2014 to consider him as a madman, and soon their literary polemic, hitherto courteous, became bitter and virulent. A fashionable literary lady, Mme d'Epinay, had in 1756 settled Rousseau and his wretched manage in a lovely spot by the forest of Montniorency, Nouveiie and here Rousseau wrote his 'Julie ou la Heloise.' t \u2022 i p 1?

' It will,' he says himself, ' be disliked by religious people, libertines and philo sophers, and will shock women, both bad and good.' As in the other works of Rousseau, the words are fine, the moral bad. The superiority and originality of Rousseau blaze forth in his descriptions of nature and landscape, in which he carries truth and poetry to a perfection hitherto unknown. Without ceasing to write in prose, Rousseau is the greatest poet of the XVIIIth century. A disgraceful adventure brought to a close his friend ship with Mme d'Epinay; he had already quarrelled with Grimm and Diderot, whose materialism had always"], [355, "JEA N-JA CQ UES RO US SE A U 343 been distasteful to him. Now more than ever the hypochondriac fancied himself to be the victim of general persecution. He however accepted, though with very bad grace, the hospitality of Marshal de Luxembourg. In 1762 he published the two works that finally mark his place in the century as a politician and a philo sopher, and in literature as a writer. The r ' 1762. work of Montesquieu and Voltaire had 'Lecontrat 1 \u25a0 -1 \u2022 -11 i Social.' been negative, their theories practically de structive : Jean-Jacques now put forward theories for the reconstruction of the social edifice. 'Le Contrat Social' (Amsterdam 1762) is nothing but an eloquent and sentimental elaboration of the principles of the Dutch Declaration of Independence and of the English Bill of Rights (1689), into an ideal of the social contract. Rousseau's 'Social Contract,' from the popularity and dogmatism of its author rather than from any actual political importance, became one of the most successful and fatal of social impostures. ' Man is born free, and everywhere he is in fetters ' : such is the principle from which he starts ; he tries to combine individual liberty with civil life and govern ment, by means of a national sovereignty. Like Locke in his ' Treatise on Government,' and Hobbes in his 'Leviathan,' he maintains that the sovereign power resides inalienably with the people; every citizen sur renders his individual rights as freely as in Hobbes's covenant ; but whilst Locke allows this sovereign power to be delegated to an executive government, Rousseau"], [356, "JEAN-JACQUES ROUSSEAU 344 maintains that the will of the nation must be consulted in all matters, and, when obtained, is ' inalienable, indi visible, and infallible.' The impossibility of obtaining this ' volonte generale ' forced him to the conclusion that the modern state is too large, and he held up as models the ancient city states.

It must be added, in justice to Jean- Jacques, that he said that ' the most just revolution would be bought too dearly by the blood of a single citizen.' But this but proves the childish inexperience of his unpractical, visionary mind : the passions that he was stirring up were not to be stayed by words such as these. When the constitutional reform movement of 1789 had broken down, and power had passed into the hands of untrained dreamers and a club of homicidal maniacs, it was inevitable that the wildest propositions should find the most ready acceptance. Thus it came about that the gospel according to Rousseau, while putting no restraint upon the criminals of the time, continued to supply them with specious texts and sonorous maxims. In 'Emile ou de l'Education' (Amsterdam, the Hague, Paris 1762), one long paradox, Rousseau lays down his views upon the proper education , of the young. He sketches the plan he oudei-Educa would follow from earliest childhood: he would educate a child in the country, far from the corrupt morals of the towns. His early education should be purely negative, i.e. he should not be taught to follow virtue, but how to avoid vice. Up to twelve years of age, and even later, he should never be allowed to read books, for they only ' teach people to talk of what they do not understand.'

When he reaches the age of fifteen he has his first instruction about God. Emile is brought by his tutor at dawn before the finest peaks of the Alps, and there, in the famous ' Profession de foi du Vicaire Savoyard,' God is revealed to him : Emile is told that his God is the God of Nature, and that there is no need for a revelation. ' No toils, no poverty, absolve a father from the duty of being himself the educator of his children,' are words found in the ' Emile ' ; Jean-Jacques, however, sent his own five children to the Foundlings' Hospital. Within the framework of this most artificial system, Rousseau develops in turns, with equal eloquence, the wildest paradoxes and the most useful and judicious suggestions : to him is due the modern method of teaching children by practical object-lessons. It is strange to notice that the previous works of Rousseau, subversive as they were, raised no storm in official quarters.

At the same time, however, he cannot let the opportunity pass of abusing his enemies and making an apology for his own sins. It is the record of a wretched, disreputable existence, the key-note of which was a morbid sensibility that bordered on, if it did not actually reach, insanity. The magic of his style and his burning eloquence, artistic and emotional, pompous and full of imagery, were irresistible. In style Rousseau is the Rousseau's master and precursor of Bernardin de Saint- Pierre, of Byron, Goethe, Chateaubriand, Lamartine,"], [360, "JEAN-JACQUES ROUSSEAU 348 George Sand, etc. Politically the influence of Jean- Jacques may be said to have been broader and deeper than that of the Platonic Montesquieu or of the kalei doscopic Voltaire : Rousseau sowed the wind ; he stirred up the masses ; over and above the melancholy and bitterness which are seen in all his books, the pre vailing trait is sensibility : ' Je n'avais rien concu ; j'avais tout senti.' It was this savage sensibility that produced the hysterical side of the French Revolu tion, which is perhaps the most repugnant of all to the modern observer ; and it was he who gave the tone to the bloodthirsty demagogues of the Convention and of the Reign of Terror, in whom are to be seen the same maudlin sentimentality as well as the same infatuation for the institutions and manners of re publican Rome. If the movement of 1792 rendered the movement of 1789 abortive, the fault primarily lies with the Swiss lackey of genius, whose flashy rhetoric wrought more harm than even his melancholy brain could have conceived. A portrait of this strange medley of contradictions is given by a lady, Mme de Beaumont, His character. who knew the man : \u2014 'II s'est elev6 un homme plein du langage de la philo sophie, sans etre veritablement philosophe : esprit doue d'une multitude de connaissances qui ne l'ont pas eclairs ; caractere livr6 aux paradoxes d'opinions et de conduite, affiant la simplicite des m\u0153urs avec le faste des pensees, le zele des maximes antiques avec la fureur d'etablir des nouveautes, l'obscurite de la retraite avec le desir d'etre connu de tout"], [361, "ROMANTICISM ( VICTOR HUGO) 349 le monde. On l'a vu invectiver contre les sciences qu'il cultivait, preconiser l'excellence de l'Evangile dont il detrui sait les dogmes, peindre la beaute des vertus qu'il eteignait trop souvent dans 1'ame de ses lecteurs.' La Harpe ably sums up his character by calling him 'the most subtle of sophists, the most rhetorical of writers, and the most shameless of cynics.' ROMANTICISM (VICTOR HUGO) (1820-1843) The Revolution of 1789 had been a just and inevitable revolt against the social and political regime of a cruel despotism. The Romantic movement (1820 to 1843) is a revolt against the conventional despotism of clas sical tradition in literature, whose rules were practised by Corneille and Racine, and stated in Boileau's ' Art Po\u00a3tique ' (1674). Romanticism is, as Victor Hugo says, nothing but 'liberalism in literature.' The Revolu tion endowed France with social and political liberty ; Romanticism strove to endow her with liberty in art : in a word, Romanticism in France completed the movement of Emancipation of 1789. In the history of German literature Romanticism was, at the end of Voltaire's age, a systematic return to the national and religious forms and ideas 0 Its origin. of medi\u00e6val poetry and art, whose origin is to be found in the Romances of Chivalry. The"], [362, "ROMANTICISM (VICTOR HUGO) 350 object of its leaders, Tieck and the brothers Frederic and William Schlegel, was, however, mainly to eman cipate German literature from its servile imitation of the French that hampered its national genius. Mme de Stael, in her well-known book ' de l'Alle- magne,' revealed the existence, name and aspirations of this movement, and the name of roman tique came most appropriately to designate writers who wished to abandon the Greek and Latin models and subjects, and shake off the laws established by the French literature of the Classical period in submis sion to the authority, more or less well understood, of antiquity. At the same time Mme de Stael dis seminated in France the knowledge of German litera ture, and the dramatic works of Lessing, Goethe and Schiller. Besides, Shakespeare had been intro duced into France by Voltaire, who had imitated him freely in 'Zaire,' 'La Mort de Ce'sar,' 'Brutus,' etc., though he had carefully observed the traditional rules of classical tragedy. Ducis (1733 1816) had put upon the French stage 'Romeo and Juliet', ' Macbeth', ' Hamlet', etc., and a complete prose translation of Shakespeare had appeared between 1776 and 1782. It is not necessary, however, to look abroad for the origin of the Romantic movement. The gradual rise of the ' Tiers Etat,' or middle class, in the XVIIIth century had led writers to think that between the powdered and wigged tragedy of Corneille and Racine and the middle-class comedy of"], [363, "ROMANTICISM (VICTOR HUGO) 351 Moliere there was room for an intermediate genus. La Chauss^e (1692-1754) produced his ' Com^die larmoy ante' or ' trag^die bourgeoise,' which may be considered as the origin of the 'drame.' Diderot, by his efforts more than actually by his plays, which are but poor, is the father of the modern drama that has developed so powerfully in this century in the hands of Victor Hugo, Sardou, etc. Sedaine's 'Philosophe sans le savoir ' is the best example of this new dramatic genus : it is a homely middle-class tragedy, and it paved the way for the romantic ' drama.' According to the orthodox Classical School, Tragedy was bound down by the rules formulated in Boileau's 'Art Poetique.' The Three Unities of Action, 1 Tenets of Time and Place,1 had to be observed ; the classical hence there would be but little action on the stage. The style was to be the style noble ; the king did not 'walk'; it could only be said of him : ' Le roi porte ici ses pas.' Besides, the heroes and heroines of Classical Tragedy were all kings and queens, princes and princesses, who displayed the same costumes, fashions and manners as the courtiers of Louis xiv. The XVIIIth and XIXth centuries de manded something more human and less aristocratic. Rousseau's denunciation of Letters and Arts, and of civilisation generally, found an echo two generations later, when the young Victor Hugo raised the standard of literary revolt. The new doctrines were less the assertion of new rules than the negation of all the 1 See p. 285."], [364, "352 ROMANTICISM (VICTOR HUGO) rules and traditions of the past; they were the con- tradiction and counterpart of the tenets Tenets of the . , . . Romantic of the Classicists. Whilst the Classicists, with Boileau 'le polte du bon sens' con sidered Reason as supreme,1 and clearness and precision as essential qualities, the Romanticists upheld the claims of imagination and fancy, and aimed at high colouring, contrast and effect. The Classicists sought the models of their art and the source of their inspira tion in the masterpieces of antiquity ; the Romanticists seek inspiration in modern foreign literature, in Goethe, Schiller, Byron, and swear by Shakespeare as the Classical Age swore by Aristotle; for Pagan mythology they substitute the Christian Arts of the Middle Ages; the rule of the Three Unities they throw to the winds; they bring the action upon the stage, and flood it with duels, suicides and murders, thus introducing the sensational melodrama upon the tragic stage; they surround their characters with exact local colouring, and represent with minute historical fidelity the costumes and scenery of the time of the play. War against the established rules was carried to small details, and even to the technique of versification. The Romanticists broke up the struc ture of the stately Alexandrine by a free c\u00e6sura and the ' overflow ' (enjambement), destroying the good work of Malherbe, destroying the only rhythm of French tragic verse, which in Victor Hugo nearly sounds like mere prose. 1 See Essay on Boileau, p. 299."], [365, "ROMANTICISM ( VICTOR HUGO) 353 It must be remembered, however, that, though the battle was fought in the field of Tragedy, the Romantic movement applied to the Avhole range of literature. Chateaubriand is considered as the initiator of the Romantic movement, but Victor Hugo, the Voltaire of the XIXth century, was its champion. Round the brilliant young author of the ' Odes et Ballades ' gathered an enthusiastic band of young men of genius, Lamartine, Sainte-Beuve, Emile and Antony Deschamps, Alfred de Musset, Theophile Gautier, etc. \u2014 ' le C^nacle,' as they called themselves ; their mouthpiece was a paper 'La Muse Francaise.' They now set themselves to bring about a revolt against the Classical School. Liberty soon degenerates into licence. Victor Hugo and the Cenacle, like most reformers, went too far. They were met with such opposition from Exaggera te French Academy and the established tl0n- authorities, that their just desire for reform in some of the ' rules ' was kindled into a hatred of all rules, and these young firebrands heaped abuse on the classi cal masterpieces to which they owed their own power and purity of style : Boileau was called ' perruque ' (old fogey), the great classics ' idiots,' the Academicians 'fossils'; they indulged in theories, the ultimate de ductions of which produced the Realist and Decadent Schools of the end of this century : ' All that is Nature is Art,' they said; 'le beau c'est le laid! The school of Zola has developed these principles, and French litera- 2a"], [366, "ROMANTICISM ( VICTOR HUGO) 354 ture has been deluged with such horrors as would have made the young Romanticists' long hair stand on end. Hiarh colouring, the love of effect, contrast and anti thesis, resulted quite naturally in the present ' De cadent ' School, which goes so far as to place, in verse, sound before not only common sense but meaning ! However, the pendulum seems to have oscillated to its furthest, and to be falling back to a normal and stable equilibrium : a wholesome reaction has set in, and the ground is clear for the great authors of the present day. Victor Hugo launched the manifesto of his party in the brilliant preface of Cromwell (1827). Though The Mani- drama was ill adapted for the stage, festo, 1827. an(j never acted, Victor Hugo saw signs of encouragement : he had, in order to advance his ideas, endeavoured to introduce Shakespeare into France: in 1827 Macready and his company acted Shakespeare in Paris, and were applauded, flattered and lionised by the Parisians, who a few years before had hissed another Shakespearian company off the boards. The war began in earnest on the first night of ' Hernani ' (25th Feb. 1830). Victor Hugo had appealed The war, to and invited the young students of art l83\u00b0- anrl letters in Paris \u25a0 tbev flopVerl tr> rVie and letters in Paris : they flocked to the theatre early in the afternoon, dressed in the most extravagant costumes, in order to show their disregard for tradition. Instead of periwigs, they wore their own hair, which often reached below their shoulders like a mane ; they wore velvet coats and trousers of most"], [367, "ROMANTICISM ( VICTOR HUGO) 355 brilliant colours. Th^ophile Gautier was a particularly conspicuous object of horror for the Classicists : he was dressed in a scarlet coat specially designed for the occasion, pale green trousers and a grey overcoat lined in green satin ; his hair fell in long curls over his shoulders, as he is represented in the etching that precedes some of his works. At the first infringement of the classical rules, a storm of hisses broke out, followed and covered by the noisy applause of the poet's well-wishers. Every line of the piece was fought through to the end. Every evening the same battle ensued, amid the jeers and hisses of the Classicists, and the enthusiastic counter applause of the young Romanticists, who ridiculed and insulted their foes, and went so far as to stop the carpers' mouths with their hands; and free fights ensued. Nevertheless, Victor Hugo won the day. Though his drama is, even more than his other works, marred by his excessive love of contrast, his generous efforts undoubtedly rendered an inestimable service to France by shaking off the trammels of the artificial Three Unities and the exaggerated pomposity of the stilted style. Henri de Bornier has led the way, and it is to be hoped that Tragedy, which since the days of the Golden Age had declined under the constraint of the Classical rules, will again develop in a freer atmosphere, and that the tragic buskin will make for itself a path as bright as that of the sock."], [368, "PRINCIPAL RULES 356 PRINCIPAL RULES OF FRENCH VERSIFICATION French Verse is scanned by the number of syllables (also, though somewhat loosely, called ' feet '), not, as in English, by the number of accents ; the e mute reckons as a syllable, unless elided before a vowel or placed at the end of the line ; thus, 1 2 345 6 789 10 11 12 Qui veut voyager loin menage sa monture. 12 3 4 5 6 1 8 9 10 11 12 Le chagrin rnonte~en croupe et galope avec lui.

(Art Poit. i. 105-6.) This rule, however, has been broken by the Romanti cists, 1830 (see p. 352) under the leadership of Victor Hugo, on the plea that the c\u00e6sura was a source of monotonj-\". Malherbe also forbade the hiatus or the meeting of a vowel at the end of one word with another at the beginning of the next : ' Moi aussi,' ' ici . ...

' La hauteur ' is not a hiatus, for the h being aspirate, reckons as a con sonant ; as the h mute does not reckon at all, an e mute is elided before it, and another vowel may not precede it : ' Moi horreur ' would be a hiatus. ' Gardez qu'une voyelle a courir trop hatee Ne soit d'une voyelle en son chemin heurtee.' (Boileau.) In French there are two kinds of rhymes : the feminine rhyme comprises words that end in e mute (whatever their gender may be) like mur mure, proie, armees, ils coururent : all other words are masculine rhymes, like arme\\ sou, etc. A peculiarity of French rhyme is that these two rhymes must alternate : no two different feminine rhymes or different masculine rhymes may follow in juxtaposition.

Mur, ville, Et port, Asile De mort, Mer grise Oii brise La brise Tout dort. Dans la plaine . . . etc. (V. Hugo.) Some short pieces have been written all in one rhyme ; but these are the exception. The Romanticists introduced the ' enjambement,' or overflow of one line to the next, as well as the weak c\u00e6sura ; the Symbolists or Decadents of the present day do away with the c\u00e6sura altogether, disregard the e mutes, allow the hiatus, take no account of the number of the syllables, and occasionally adopt asson ance instead of rhyme : their poetry is therefore like harmonious prose minus sense, which, however, is to these young enthusiasts a minor consideration."], [371, "359 INDEX TO FRENCH LITERATURE A Basselin, table 6.
