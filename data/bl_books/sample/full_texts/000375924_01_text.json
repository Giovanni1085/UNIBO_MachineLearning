No publications are more entertaining or useful than local delineations and descriptions, drawn with fidelity and taste: they enable persons to form a just idea of remarkable places, to which fortune or situation denies them access; and without such aids, occasional specta tors, who have not leisure to trace every beauty for themselves, must inevitably lose half the pleasure and satisfaction to be derived from their excursions ; and at best carry with them an evanescent impression, and an imperfect remembrance of what they have seen. Few places possess more attractions than Blenheim ; and yet few places have received less justice from the poet or historian. Wheatley and Gilpin, who had every requi site qualification to do it justice, have only mentioned it in a cursory manner ; and Lyttelton and Mansfield lived too near the era of the first Duke of Marlborough's ex ploits to describe the place, farther than might serve as a vehicle for the praise of the hero.

He has been the more anxious to do this, because it is probable the work may never receive any farther im provement from his hands ; and because, should his name deserve to descend to posterity, on account of more important, though not more pleasing literary la bours, it will infallibly be associated with Woodstock, and with Blenheim in particular !"], [17, "CONTENTS.

To seize the grand outline with the mind's eye, to adapt the design to the predominant features in the landscape, to unfold the beauties of nature by the masterly touches of art, is the. sublime province of the ornamental composer of rural scenery. That this science has been cultivated with the greatest success in this country, even jealousy and national rivalry will not pretend to deny. Foreign writers, distinguished for their taste, have allowed us a pre-eminence in landscape and ornamental garden ing, and that the English were the first who emanci pated themselves from the trammels of prejudice and formality, and, recurring to nature, which had long been banished from the seats of the great, invited her to her deserted abodes, and gave her a new and more imposing aspect. Kent saw the incongruity of artificial design, when at variance with nature. The straight walk, the 13"], [22, "4 PRELIMINARY ESSAY of his own countrymen, who, indulging too much in the visions of theory, have denied him the merit of practical excellence. Because Brown could execute better than he could describe, and worked by self taught rules, he has been attacked with unbecoming asperity ; and some of his most capital performances have been ascribed to chance, or to a dereliction of his own principles. But who can reduce the infinite variety of situa tions that ask for improvement to any systematic principles ? The powerful genius of a place will im periously set rules at defiance ; and, in fact, art can only be the handmaid of nature, whose beauties, pre senting a boundless variety, are alike indignant of confinement and control.* The attempt at system is only an eSbrt to bring us back to what has justly been exploded. \" I have no magical skill in planting roses,\" says Gray ; and were this skill easily attainable, the landscape gar dener ought to reject it. Nature disdains the fetters of art. The best principles can never be universally applicable to all situations. The painter may invent or reject at pleasure, and adhere to the rules of his art : the embellisher of landscape is more confined in * Repton's sliding plates, which exhibit a place in its original state, and according to his intended improvements, are a novel and excellent invention. They shew by contrast what embellishments the situation is susceptible of, and in general indicate a very correct taste in the de signer.

His invention may cover incidental defects ; but it cannot always command the excellencies he might wish. Besides, a flat surface and an extended natural scene, are very different materials to work on, and will have very different effects when viewed by the eye of natural taste,* the only just criterion of rural embellishment. The chef d'\u0153uvre of Brown was the improvements at Blenheim. t He had the noblest field to display his talents on, and he did not labour in vain. But though he traced the outline with effect, the correct taste of the noble possessor of this magnificent place, at that period, enabled him to give it many additional touches, and to improve its drapery. He hafe, how ever, preserved the unity of the design, and only heightened the colouring. Who, that now visits these picturesque scenes, can deny but that planta tions have been applied to all the principal purposes which M. De Girardin, perhaps copying from his beloved Ermenonville, conceives ought to be their grand objects : * By natural taste, is meant that quick perception of the beauties and deformities of nature, which enables a person at once to decide. No faculty is more rare : it requires the union of a poetic imagination with a correct judgment. t It has been said, and probably on good authority, that when Van brugh, the architect of Blenheim, was requested to give a design also for the intended Gardens, he declined the task, by observing, \" for that you must go to a landscape painter.\" This does honour to his taste, and shews how far he outstripped his contemporaries, who, vitiated by bad models, would in geneval have been unable to discover that landscape painting and gardening are naturally allied in their object, though the materials are very different with which they work."], [24, "6 PRELIMINARY ESSAY \" To form the perspective or side scenes of the fore-ground, that may best connect the distances, with the principal points of view.\" \" To raise such elevations or scenes, as may give relief even to an absolute flat.\" \" To hide all disagreeable objects.\" \" To give more extent to those that are pleasing, by concealing their terminations behind a mass of wood ; by which means the imagination continues them beyond the point where they are seen.\" \" To give an agreeable outline to all surfaces, whether of land or water.\" These are the ideas of a master ; and we here see them realized. They who think justly, in matters not under the influence of the passions, will generally come to the same conclusions : hence often coinci dence without intention. But while Brown has been too indiscriminately condemned by some, he has also been too lavishly praised by others, where he is least defensible. His formal clumps must in many cases be given up by his most zealous partizans, or receive a degree of connection by intermediate planting, as has been done at Blenheim, in order to preserve the uniformity of the scene. His unvarying circular belts too, where they are not broken into masses, as we see them here, and when they serve to exclude the prospect of the surrounding country, are real defects in pictu resque beauty. No kind of property is less the ob ject of envy, or more grateful to the eye, than to take possession of a country in an extensive view : it"], [25, "ON LANDSCAPE GARDENING. 7 contributes to the general beauty, and is equally en joyed by all, Avithout offence to any. That display of nature is certainly most magnificent which is bounded only by the horizon : where scenes, under the imme diate view, present the most captivating charms, and where the distance harmonizes with the fore-ground. Such is the prevailing character of Blenheim. But let us not degrade it into a mere object to please the eye of taste, however refined. It presents views to interest the heart. To the picturesque landscape which charms the sight, it superadds the moral land scape that delights the mind. In its wide extent, it exhibits accommodations for age, remunerated for services in youth \u2014 it is peopled with happy labourers \u2014 it is stocked with cattle \u2014 it waves with corn.* \u2014 * Sonnet, on seeing some hundred additional acres in Blenheim Park converted into tillage : \u2014 Oft o'er this scene, with raptur'd eye, the Muse Has lov'd to stray, while Fancy's magic glass In fairy tints has painted ancient views, And shewn, in long array, Fame's fav'rites pass : Th' illustrious line of names renown'd of old, Imagination wakes\u2014 and startles to behold ! \u2014 Here rural beauty fixed her pristine reign, And lur'd our monarchs to her native seat ; Here ev'ry spot\u2014 the shade, the slope, the plain, Is sacred ground, and worn by hallow 'd feet.

These not only enliven its most brilliant scenes, but give them a charm to the heart of sensibility, which no inanimate or unproductive embellishments can possibly convey. The splendid seat may indicate the fortune of the possessor, but it is the state of the cot tages in the vicinity that marks the character of the man. Every lodge within the limits of a nobleman's or gentleman's domain, multiplies the means of su perintendence at a very small expense, and is equally beneficial to himself and to the community.

It stands in the fairest part of one of the finest counties in England, within half a mile of the borough of New Woodstock ; distant about eight miles from the University of Oxford, and sixty -three from London.

Blenheim was built at the public expense in the reign of Queen Anne, by whom, with the concur rence of Parliament, which voted half a million t for its completion, it was conferred, together with the Honour of Woodstock, on the most illustrious John, Duke of Marlborough, as a testimony of royal favour and national gratitude for his trauscendent services, * Blenheim Palace ; Ditchley, the present residence of the Earl of Normanton, but the property of Lord Viscount Dillon; Heythrop, the seat of the Earl of Shrewsbury, now occupied during the hunting season by the Duke of Beaufort ; and Cornbury Park,1 adjoining to Wychwood Forest, the delightful seat of Lord Churchill \u2014 form a chain of parks, within a moderate distance, each possessing its peculiar and appropri ate beauties ; though the first stands unrivalled for grandeur and extent, for natural charms, and for elegant embellishment. t Though Parliament was apparently so liberal, immense sums have been expended by the family on this noble structure and its accompa niments, to bring it to its present state. The Triumphal Gate, the Pil lar, and the Grand Bridge, were wholly built at their private expense. The improvements of the park and gardens, and the expansion of the water, within the last fifty years, have cost little less than \u00a3200,000. 1 Cornbury Park may be considered as classic ground, being the well-known residence of Edward, Earl of Clarendon, by whom the house was greatly improved, and received the still existing inscription running along the principal front, \" Deus nobis h\u00e6c otia fecit,\" iu com pliment to Charles II. The Chapel, with fine carved work by Grinlin Gibbons, is one of the most beautiful in the kingdom. The house has recently been modernized, under the direction of Mr. Hakewill ; and, with its accompaniments, now forms a very appropriate and desirable abode for any nobleman."], [29, "DESCRIPTION OF BLENHEIM. 11 and the many signal victories he had gained over the French and Bavarians, particularly that near the vil lage of Blenheim, on the banks of the Danube, from which this noble palace receives its name. This victory being achieved on the second day of August, 1704, it was enacted, \" That on the same day of every year, for ever, the inheritors of his Grace's honours and titles should render at Windsor to her Majesty, her heirs, and successors, one stand ard or colours, with three fleurs-de-lis painted there on, as an acquittance for all manner of rents, suits, and services due to the Crown.\" The terms of this tenure are punctually observed ; and in consequence, a long series of flags are exhibited at Windsor Castle. The architect of Blenheim was Sir John Vanbrugh, who, though he has been censured, with some shew of reason, for the general heaviness of his designs, and his deviation from the purer models of Greece and Rome, must at least stand acquitted in this in stance, when it is considered, that strength and du rability were principal objects to be regarded, in a pile intended to remain a monument of British valour and British generosity, till the latest periods of time \u2014 Till time's remotest stage design'd to prove A Churchill's valour, and a nation's love.* Accordingly, we find both the plan and the execu- * The verses interspersed, where not otherwise acknowledged, are generally taken from \" Blenheim,\" a poem, by the author of this De scription, first published in 1787."], [30, "12 DESCRIPTION OF BLENHEIM. tion excellently adapted to answer those momentous purposes ; and while the more modern and fanciful fabrics are only the boast of an age, Blenheim seems calculated to stand uninjured by the lapse of years, and to excite the admiration of foreigners, as well as of natives, in proportion as it is better known. But Vanbrugh does not stand in need of the poor compliment of an apology for his design, \u2014 he de serves very considerable applause for his judgment, in a circumstance which has principally exposed him to the censure of pretended critics : he has rendered this structure characteristic and expressive of its des tination. Its massy grandeur, its spacious portals, and its lofty towers, recal the ideas of defence and security ; with these we naturally associate the hero for whom it was erected, and thus find it emblematic of his talents and pursuits.* * When this Description was first published, the strictures on Van brugh's architecture had been so long and so often bandied about, by unreflecting prejudice, that the author was fearful to bestow even an adequate eulogium on this noble pile. He has not the vanity to think that he has been able to give a turn to the public opinion in this respect ; but he certainly has the pleasure to find, that several writers, of indis putable taste, since that period, have stepped forward in vindication of his general sentiments, and have even fur exceeded his moderate com mendation. But the age of Blenheim has exceeded a century; and the reign of error, or of prejudice, is seldom of longer duration! It has been justly observed, however, that from the great extent of the wings, the centre appears too low, or wanting relief; and no one will attempt to defend the punning statues of lions tearing cocks. These last might be removed without the least injury to the pile, whose real beauties, though not wholly reducible to the strict orders of architec ture, must ever irresistibly please the most fastidious taste, when viewed in connection with the design of its erection."], [31, "13 DESCRIPTION OF BLENHEIM.

On the Woodstock side only a few small rising clumps appear, which assist to conceal the boundary from other points of view, and to break the line of the buildings ; a few trees, fancifully disposed, skirt the slope, and others of a larger growth range with the stream on its very edge, and afford some pretty glades into the water, between their trunks and boughs ; but their heads scarcely rising above the level of the walk, they serve rather to vary than to conceal. In front of the Home Lodge, which stands on the left, appears that elegant structure, the China Gallery, which will be separately described in the sequel. As we advance, the prospects diversify ; the fine rural scenes in the northern part of the Park become more and more conspicuous ; and to the north-west, the eye takes in an ample field of cheerful objects, over a wide extent of champaign and woodland coun try, to the extremity of Wychwood Forest, which is finely contrasted with the deep umbrage that over hangs the lake, and intercepts the view. This road, which is only lateral and circuitous, to avoid the stiff ness of a direct approach, at last falls into another, denominated the mall; which, beginning at the noble entrance on the south of Woodstock, called Hensing ton Gate, is lined by double rows of stately trees, and forms a beautiful and spacious vista to the Palace."], [37, "E A \u00a7 T TIE \"W of B LETS M E II mi .

Here Painting shews the wonders of her art, Gains on the sense, and captivates the heart ; From mimic pencils new creations rise, Start into life, and wear its native dyes ; Bold as the form Prometheus taught to move, When heaven's dread lightning he withdrew from Jove, Here Brussels' looms their boasted skill display, And tapestry armies stand in long array. The vivid tints with war's dread horrors burn : Here, Grief and Shame \u2014 there, Rage and Fury turn ; The lengthen'd march \u2014 the ramparts rise to sight, And all the kindling glories of the fight. Hail, ye great artists, whose enchanting skill Can mould the passions, and control the will : Not to the eye your labours are address'd, \u2014 They boast an influence o'er the ductile breast ; For while, entranc'd, each happy touch we view,. The moral sense becomes reform'd by you : Beauty and order, harmony and ease, Unite to polish, as they tend to please ! I.\u2014 HALL.

The ceiling, which is the height of the building, or sixty-seven feet, is painted by Sir James Thornhill, and allegorically represents Victory, with proper accompaniments, crowning John Duke of Marlborough, as she points to a plan of the battle of Blenheim. The Duke is depicted in a blue Roman dress. Over the noble marble door-case that communicates with the Saloon, is a bust of the same hero, with this inscription : ECCE VIRUM STABILES CUI GENS AUGUSTA PENATES CUI FRACTAS TANDEM GALLIA DEBET OPES.

Below, on a black marble slab, stands a fine antique Diana and Dog, universally ad mired ; and exactly opposite, on a similar slab, is a beautiful Vase, with figures in relievo, from the an tique, supposed to represent the nuptial ceremonies of the Romans. Over the grand staircase is a large picture, by Hudson, of Charles Duke of Marlborough and Fa mily ; and beyond the arcades, on the other side of the hall, the first Duke and Family are delineated by the pencil of Closterman. On the right side of the Hall, and connected with a magnificent gilt vane in the external centre, which gives apparent elevation to this part of the building, is a wind-dial. On the opposite side, in shape and size corresponding to the dial, is an elegant new clock, by Des Granges, recently placed there by the present Duke of Marlborough. Both are useful and pleasing appendages. From the Hall, we enter a long gallery, on the right of which, near the entrance, is the Waiting Room, formerly the Billiard Room and small Library, and, of course, not now open to the public.

It is impossible to conceive any thing more superb than the solid columns of veined marble, which sup port a rich entablature, the Doric pilasters of the same, the surrounding basement of black marble, and the stuccoed compartments of the lofty vaulted ceil ing, which open a fine field for the pencil of the first master in the pictorial art. This noble room was originally intended as a gal lery for paintings ; but has since been furnished with the grand Sunderland collection of books, comprising upwards, of seventeen thousand volumes, in various languages, arts, and sciences ; all arranged in elegant cases, with gilt wire latticed doors, on the east side through its whole extent, and along the two ends. Few private collections are equal to this in value, the whole being reckoned worth thirty thousand pounds ; yet this is not the only library in the palace, nor does it contain more than its proportion of rare and curious books, though it is the only one open to public inspection. The Spencer family, indeed, in all its branches, is distinguished for its literary taste, and the magnificence and extent of its literary treasures. At the upper end of the library stands a highly finished white marble statue of Queen Anne, in her coronation robes, by Rysbrach ; on the pedestal is this inscription : \u2014"], [63, "41 THE LIBRARY.

At the lower end, is a bust of Alexander the Great ; a fine specimen of Grecian sculpture, in good preservation, dug out of the ruins of Herculaneum ; and supported by an elegant modern therm, designed by Sir William Chambers.

Indeed every apartment has its appropriate beauties, both internal and external : the eye of taste will recognize many which the brevity of our plan prevented us from noting ; to the more cursory ob server this Description will prove an useful monitor. One striking ornament, however, we have neglected to remark : the Mahogany Doors throughout this whole suite are splendidly finished, and are worthy of the apartments to which they conduct. When open, they form a magnificent vista from the Library to the Grand Cabinet. XIV.\u2014 CHAPEL.

The style of painting, and the degree of light, are both peculiarly happy : the large compartments of sober gray are finely relieved by the surrounding white ; and the shade of foliage that partially darkens the windows, diffuses an air of com posed solemnity, unmixed with gloom, unaccompa nied wth melancholy. The chief ornament, however, is a stately Monu ment, in various marble, to the memory of the first Duke and Duchess, by Rysbrach. They are repre sented with their two sons, who died young,* as supported by Fame and History : these are colossal figures, and being most prominent, are the most striking in the group.

This apartment adjoins the Theatre, near the en trance of the Gardens, and is ornamented with a su perb collection of paintings, by Titian ; a magnificent present from Victor Amadeus, King of Sardinia, to John, Duke of Marlborough. These capital performances of this celebrated mas ter, after long lying hidden from public view, are now liberally displayed, chiefly for the sake of amateurs in the pictorial art. They consist of the following series, and are painted on leather : \u2014 I. Mars and Venus. II. Cupid and Psyche. III. Apollo and Daphne. IV. Pluto and Proserpine. V. Hercules and Dejanira. VI. Vulcan and Ceres. VII. Bacchus and Ariadne. VIII. Jupiter, Juno, and lo. IX. Neptune and Amphitrite. These figures, which far exceed the size of nature, though they are little encumbered with drapery, cover"], [67, "CHINA GALLERY. 45 three sides of the room, and form almost a school of themselves. It has been remarked, however, tbat Titian is not happy in expressing female beauty, though he had goddesses to delineate. Indeed, his taste in design is by no means equal to the spirit of his execution and the beauty of his colouring, in which he is almost unrivalled. CHINA GALLERY.* This elegant fabric, erected purposely for the re ception of the superb collection of porcelain now de posited here, stands close to the Home Lodge, and is separated from the Park by iron palisades. It was fitted up in the year 1796 ; and presents an additional attraction to the visitors of Blenheim, who delight in the antique, rich, and curious speci mens of the porcelain, dels, and japan manufacture. But it is not the connoisseur only who will be gra tified by this display ; \u2014 no eye of taste can fail to re ceive satisfaction from the sight of this splendid col lection ; nor will the arrangement pass unregarded by the most superficial observer. The gallery, whose external figure represents a cross, is divided into five compartments. * This choice collection was formed by Mr. Spalding, a valetudinary of moderate fortune, during his travels for several years on the Conti nent, as well as his attendance on sales in this country, and presented by him, on certain conditions, as an appendant to Blenheim."], [68, "46 CHINA GALLERY. The two rooms at each end are fitted up in an octagonal form, and lighted from the top, with the porcelain regularly arranged on slight pilasters, or fancifully suspended by brass hooks, against the walls. The centre room, which occupies the trans verse of the cross, is circular, and has a light in the form of a dome in the middle, and a smaller one on each side. This apartment is particularly magnificent. Round the walls are ten panels and twelve pilasters, filled with choice specimens ; and at a proper distance in the area, are eight pilasters and six open stands, with a pyramidal pagoda in the centre, supporting many pieces of singular value or beauty. The whole gallery may be seen at the first entry ; and, from the reflected light, the distribution of parts, and the splendour of the materials, which are here displayed to the greatest advantage, it may not in aptly be compared to the fanciful descriptions of en chanted palaces, in poesy and romance. This assemblage of ancient porcelain consists of an immense quantity of both useful and ornamental arti cles, in every species of that elegant manufacture, from the earliest ages till the art is said to have been lost. Some specimens exhibit its infant state, which, according to the Abbe Raynal, in his History of the Indies, may be reasonably supposed to be three thou sand years ago. The remote antiquity of these may be inferred, from the rudeness of the designs, and the imperfect crackled appearance of the baking. It is long before art cau be brought to any degree of"], [69, "47 CHINA GALLERY. perfection. To glaze and bake in the high style of many pieces in this collection, must have required reiterated attempts, and the experience of years \u2014 perhaps of ages. Among other varieties, are many of the choicest pieces of the old blue and white, and pale japan brown edge, so much esteemed by the curious. Like wise a numerous assortment of those very scarce and valuable sorts, the antique bleu celeste, and deep purple. It is impossible, however, to enter into a minute description of articles so various and extensive ; but we cannot refrain from particularizing a few, and enumerating the principal sources from which they were drawn, by the ingenious and indefatigable col lector. Among many other pieces deserving attention, are a pair of small bottles, once the property of Queen Anne \u2014 A large japan tea-pot, a present from Louis XIV. to the Duke of Richelieu \u2014 Two smaller ones from the collection of the Duke of Orleans, father to Egalite \u2014 Some pieces from the late Princess Amelia's cabinet \u2014 Many from the Portland Museum, and from the celebrated collection of the Duke d'Aumont, at Paris \u2014 A singular pieee from the Duke of Argyle's curiosities, in a former reign \u2014 Several articles from the late Duchess of Kingston's \u2014 from Selima, Coun tess of Huntingdon's \u2014 from M. Calonne's \u2014 and M. Beaumarchais' collections. Five ornamental pieces, presented by a Nabob to a Governor of Bengal, in the reign of William III. possess uncommon beauty."], [70, "48 CHINA GALLERY. A large white tea-pot, once in the possession of Oli ver Cromwell, will be deemed a curiosity j and it is not uninteresting to observe the different forms of the tea-pots in general in this gallery, the metamor phoses they have undergone, and their variations from the present prevailing shape. \u2014 Two pieces of jasper china, somewhat resembling shells, are remarkably beautiful and rare, as are several of that scarce sort, called honeycomb. It should also be observed, that some specimens are unique in their kind. A collateral room, adjoining the entrance to the gallery, is filled with scarce and elegant specimens of Roman and old earthenware, too numerous to men tion. A dels jar of the latter kind was evidently fabricated long before the Dutch threw off the Spa nish yoke, as appears from the dress of the figures \u2014 But one of the most singular curiosities, is a small piece representing a fish, which was brought from Athens, and is supposed to be coeval with that cele brated republic. In this apartment, likewise, is a small select col lection of the finest old black and gold wooden japan ; \u2014 and a numerous and beautiful assortment of old copper enamels of the black and white kind, and also in various colours, on subjects both sacred and pro fane, some of them not unworthy of the pencil of Raphael. These slight notices may suffice to shew the value and extent of this collection. The curious, and real amateurs, will satisfy themselves as to its peculiar merits_"], [71, "49 GARDENS.

The gardens, or pleasure grounds, occupy an area of two hundred acres, and upwards. On part of the north, and the east side, they are surrounded by a sunk fence, which, without breaking the grandeur of the scene, serves to separate the parts that compose it.

Nature. indeed, seems to have placed this fine chain, which describes the figure of a bow on the west and south of the river, as the only regular termination of the pleasure grounds, and the line of demarcation be tween them and the park. The lofty umbrageous trees, which cover its side and brow, form a noble back-ground, and give an unity and finish to the scene. The features of the vale, likewise, through which the river winds, from the cascade as far as the new bridge, entirely correspond with the rest of the picture : art might heighten them, but nature could not have been more propitious ; they invite embel lishment from the facility with which it might be ap plied. Or may it not be an effect of the justest taste, to render the transition from the more ornamental style of the garden to the first shades of the ruder majesty of the park, so very imperceptible, that the eye, at a small distance, cannot determine where the one commences and the other ends ? Li animate na ture, the close alliance between the last order of one class and the first of another, has been ever consi dered as an instance of beauteous design and harmo nious connection ; and why may not the same hold good in inanimate objects ? The just gradation of tints, and the easy blending of colours, are indisputa bly requisite to the composition of a perfect whole !"], [73, "51 FLOWER GARDEN. FLOWER GARDEN. The usual entrance into the pleasure-grounds is a little to the left of the eastern gate of Blenheim, the usual approach. The East Front first salutes the view, \u2014 a chaste and elegant piece of architecture, with a large projecting bow in the centre. Immedi ately before it lies the Flower Garden, which occu pies about an acre of a cheerful lawn of a moderate breadth, but extending a considerable way into the park ; at first fringed with little clumps of ever greens, encircled and interspersed with flowers and deciduous shrubs, then broken by a few scattered trees, which, rising on different sides of the sunk fence, effectually conceal it ; and afterwards lined by stately trees, that throw a finely chequered shade on the verdant sward below, and ranging in irregular pomp, preclude stiffness from mingling with beauty. The Flower Garden, though obviously a very de lightful and inviting appendage, being so contiguous and accessible, is only a recent creation in this spot. On the side next the green-house is a spacious and elegant alcove, commanding the whole of this elysian scene, in which a succession of hardy flowers and shrubs, arranged in twenty oval beds, tastefully dis posed, and including at least two hundred different kinds of roses, fill up the seasons with their varied charms, and offer incense to Flora. From a seat at the extremity of these parterres, fronting the north, is a pleasing view of the Triumphal Gate in one e 2"], [74, "52 TEMPLE OF HEALTH. direction, and of the Pillar, which crowns a swelling lawn, in another. The last is particularly attractive. See waving woods their aged arms display, And quivering sunbeams shed a partial day : Long vistas shooting from the wondering eyes, And bloom perennial pour unnumber'd dyes ! See flower-crown'd Flora spread her lucid train, And give to Beauty all the smiling plain ; While sylvan Pan, amid the shady trees, Joins in the concert with the swelling breeze. A walk of pebbly gravel, of the most beautiful texture and regularity, (which, however, prevails in the pleasure-grounds, and blends utility wth orna ment,) winding to the east, between rising planta tions and clumps of trees and shrubs in various shape, at intervals is opened to highly embellished lawn ; and soon taking an easy bend to the south, conducts to the TEMPLE OF HEALTH, Charged with the following elegant and loyal in scription, on a highly-polished marble tablet : \u2014 DEO MAXIMO CONSERVATORI, ET PROVIDENTIJE DIVIN.E * On RECUPERATAM GEORGII TERTII, REGIS OPTIMI, PIENTISSIMI SALUTEM, HOC MARMOR GEORGIUS DUX MARLBURIENSIS KXPLETO DESIDERIO, VOTIQUE COMPOS, IN ALKJUOO GRATI ANIMI TESTIMONIUM, L/ETUS, LUBENSQUE DEDICA\\IT.

It emerges from a small thicket, which backs it and determines its site, and without imposing the idea of solitude, renders it sufficiently sequestered. Before we reach this temple, the Triumphal Arch and Woodstock Tower are seen in pleasing perspec tive. From hence, the scene gradually changes. \u2014 Instead of embellished lawn, we become embosomed in trees of venerable majesty. The park and gardens seem to unite, or, rather, their distinction is lost. \u2014 The trimness of the walk, and the occasional sight of evergreens, alone discriminate the latter. The parts unite, And strehgth of shade contends with strength oflight. 4 Open grove, at an agreeable distance, on each side, continues for a considerable space. The whole is a delightful home-walk, sheltered, by the winding of its direction, from every blast : possessing sufficient variety in every part, with an aspect continually im- proving. From this pleasing route, however, we are drawn aside to the sequestered spot now occupied by THE AVIARY. It stands on a spot formerly called the Duchess's Flower Garden. This edifice, designed by Mr. Hake will, is stocked with gold and silver pheasants, curi ous doves, and other birds."], [76, "54 THE AVIARY. In front of the Aviary, on the site of an old neg lected wilderness, the quiet resort of every noxious reptile, a new plantation and garden are now forming. Leaving the Aviary, we pass by a gravel walk into a wood, newly planted and encircled by an arbor etum, which, together with the wood itself, contains every description of forest trees, natives of the coldest climates in Europe, Asia, and America, and suffi ciently hardy to bear our severest winters. These trees are partly intermixed with the plantation, but principally planted in groves upon grass plots. Soon after we enter the wood, we pass in review a long grass walk, twenty feet wide, which forms a vista, looking on the river and woods above it ; then proceed along the gravel walk, bounded on one side by the plantation, and on the other by the groves of exotics recently planted, till we come to a spring, bounded by a lawn, dotted over with magnolias, ailanthus, arbor jud\u00e6, and many other beautiful and sweet-smelling shrubs, the best calculated for this sheltered spot. This spring is formed into a piece of water, and filled with beautiful hardy aquatics. This walk would naturally lead us back to the Aviary, but we may extend it by turning to the right, which conducts us, amongst stately oaks, to the length of half a mile ; and we may still return by the Aviary on to the lawn in front of the house. Near the walk which we quitted to visit the Aviary is the palladian gate, or entrance into the"], [77, "KITCHEN GARDENS. 55 KITCHEN GARDENS, Where the eye darts over a cheerful landscape to the south. On this side, the walls of the kitchen gardens, which are fourteen feet high, are concealed by irre gular plantations of laurels and other shrubs, thinly scattered with forest trees. From the gate, we trace their vast extent clothed with the choicest fruit trees ; we behold an area of eight acres, while four more re main unseen, furnished with every article of culinary use, or of elegance in the dessert, and replete with every requisite appendage for bringing it to perfec tion. The hot-houses are constructed on an excellent principle, and produce the finest pines and grapes. \u2014 Art here amply supplies the want of a warmer sky. The Conservatory occupies an angle fronting the south. Falling into the Home-walk at this place, the de viation from which has been previously mentioned, we soon enter the Sheep-walk, which is half a mile in length, and through its whole extent abounding with rural imagery. Frequently covered with a flock of more than a thousand sheep, all of the most beau tiful and valuable, and some of the most curious breeds ; this space, though possessing features of characteristic negligence, is not less rich, nor less ani mated than the most favourite spots in the garden."], [78, "56 THE NEW BRIDGE. It was formerly open to the park, but is now sepa rated from it by a sunk fence and iron palisades, which extend to the new bridge, and thus give greater seclusion to the spot. The open grove winds away to the right, and on this hand we catch a glimpse of the south front of the Palace, which is thrown into various perspective as we advance. In other directions we enjoy a pic turesque view of Beckley Hill, just peeping over the intervening heights ; of Wytham's lofty woods rising to the summit of Botley, where the trees range in solitary state ; and through the long perspective of a rich champaign, in which Ensham Tower forms a very conspicuous object, when illumined with a morn ing sun, the distant White Horse Hills are seen to elevate themselves into a back-ground. Nor. are re mote pictures alone attractive at this hour : the deep shade that darkens the neighbouring village of Bla don, is finely contrasted with the level beams that glance on the water below. At every changing sea son of the day, indeed, some new beauty is developed, or the scenes are thrown into a different perspective, by the aid of light and shade. The evening sun is not less propitious than the morning, for giving a brilliant effect to objects in this delightful perambu lation. Proceeding ; \u2014 in one place, the New Bridge, as it is called, appears broken and ruinous by the bend of a tree that overhangs the bank ; in another it shews its arches entire, and even the lower visible reach of"], [79, "57 GARDENS. water is seen sparkling through its balustrades ; far ther the centre arch alone is perceptible ; and some times the whole is lost. Such is the effect of group ing and combining 1 The lawn is sprinkled with beautiful groups of trees ; the majestic oak, with pendent inclination to the stream, is the frequent or nament of the slope. About the middle of this walk, the top of Hand borough spire,* though nearly three miles off, ap pears emerging from the bosom of the deep wood beyond the lake. Near this spot, we may pause to contemplate the beauties which the changing scene displays. Nothing can be more picturesque than Bladon, when gilded with an evening sun : the battlemented tower, and here and there the end of a building, glow with the crimson of his beams ; or the window, partially shaded by intervening trees, reflects them like living fire. Claude would have caught the tints with rap ture ; he would have combined the objects into a picture ; and on its effect, he might have rested the immortality of his fame. * It is almost unnecessary to remark, that from the growth or decay of trees, objects, in a few years, will either be disclosed or concealed, or changes in picturesque scenery take place, for which either the na tural or artificial painter cannot always provide. Accuracy in delinea tions and descriptions ought always to be attempted ; but the reason assigned will prevent the most careful from attaining it."], [80, "58 THE CASCADE. CASCADE AND ITS ACCOMPANIMENTS. A little farther on is the first opening of the cascade*, and for some space it forms a principal attraction. \u2014 The water seems to burst from the deep wood that bounds the head ; its course is totally hid by the bend, by the figure of the banks, and the effect of plantation. Every step we descend towards the cas cade the embellishments thicken, the scene becomes more illustrious. Groups of acacia, cedar, poplar, chesnut, and beech, decorate the declivity down to the river ; and beyond it, at a proportionate distance, the back-ground, as far as the commencement of the new garden, is adorned with a profusion of haw thorns, surmounted by noble pendent trees, which, stretching round as far as the eye can reach, termi nate in the near horizon. But before we sink into the vale, it will not be unpleasing to take a retrospective view of the land scape we are leaving behind. The lofty spire of Kidlington church seems to belong to the park ; the distant hills formerly observed, are cast into different perspective ; and a new and wider range is displayed, farther than the natural vision can distinguish objects. The obelisk of the Fountain soon peeps between a little woody island and the cascade ; and the grand River, which, a few paces before, was invisible, bursts at once on the eye in a broad sheet, without apparent continuity or connection. Before we reach"], [81, "59 GARDENS. the termination of the sheep-walk, we lose the cascade on the left ; to it, however, we at last descend, be tween clumps and groups of the most luxuriant and delicate trees of various climes, intermixed with flow ers and shrubs of the utmost fragrance and beauty. The ground, which at first is highest on the left, soon assumes a determined superiority on the right. It is thrown into masses with a masterly hand ; it has re ceived every embellishment that refined taste can confer on natural beauty ; and we enjoy the touch of art, without waking the idea that revolts at its flaunt ing display. Here various trees compose a chequer'd scene, Glowing in gay diversities of green ; There the full stream, through intermingling glades, Shines a broad lake, or falls in loud cascades. In the vicinity of the cascade, whose sides are finely shaded, the water is quite lost above. Even from the bridge that fronts it at fifty feet distance, we only see the fall, without tracing the supply. The charming reach below appears in its most varied fea tures from this bridge, which connects the gardens : and when the full stream devolves from the rocky hairier, and bounds from one point to another in foamy pride with deafening roar, nothing can be more grateful to a contemplative mind than such a scene, and such a situation."], [82, "60 NEW GARDEN. Down the steep fall devolve the foaming tides, Unfading verdure clothes th' aspiring sides. Emblem of life ! where waves on waves arise, While Hope looks up, and views serener skies, Where still the troublous sea incessant roars, And still Hope flatters, as we eye the shores. NEW GARDEN. The New Garden, which we now enter, though of no very great extent, contains many beauties peculiar to itself, many views of magnificent and appropriate scenery. Following the course of the river on the left, we soon reach Newfound Well, a mineral spring of the chalybeate kind, said to possess very active virtues, before they were weakened by the expansion of the lake, whose waters are now supposed to mix with it. In the front of a dark clump rises a pedestal supporting an urn, and from an aperture in the for mer gushes the spring ; and being received into an antique basin, charged with numerous fancy figures, in alto relievo, much injured, flows out near the top by the mouths of two lions, and quickly mixes with the river. Again we have a view of the New Bridge, and of a serpentine reach of water, embracing the island, and gliding on with glassy smoothness. THE FOUNTAIN Next attracts our notice. There river-gods reclin'd, at ease explore A scene more lovely than their native shore ; Confess Hcsperia boasts no charms that vie With the blight landscapes which around them lie."], [83, "61 THE FOUNTAIN. It is situated at the bottom of the hill, and forms an object not unworthy of its place and destination. In the centre of an elegant capacious basin, where marble dolphins seem to sport, stands the base, formed of a species of porous stone, permeable by the water, and thrown together in rude pomp, with a cavern from east to west, from which appear to issue a lion and a sea-horse, the attributes of Europe and Africa, finely designed. On the four extremities of the rock, which support the obelisk, are four river-gods, sculptured in white marble, with a delicacy and expression not to be sur passed. These are intended to represent the Danube, the Nile, the La Plata, and the Ganges, the four principal rivers of the different quarters of the globe. The Danube rests his right leg on an oar* \u2014 The Nile veils his head with classical propriety \u2014 The American River-God lifts up his left hand and eyes in surprise, as if first made known to the rest of the world \u2014 The Asiatic River-God, with a placid look, stretches out his hand to a serpent crawling, and to a shell. This last seems to be a different design from the original, where the Ganges is represented as re cumbent, crowned with sedge, and a rudder between his legs, with the palm-tree behind. The following arms appear on one side of the base of the obelisk : \u2014 under a coronet in a border of lions * In the Vatican at Rome is an ancient sculpture of the Tiber in the same attitude.

On the opposite side, in a border of saltiers, under a coronet, two wolves, with lambs in their mouths.

This fine piece of sculpture, the last work of Ber nini, and a copy from the magnificent fountain in the Piazza Navona at Rome, was a present from the Spanish ambassador at the Papal court, to the first Duke of Marlborough. It has only been recently erected ; and during the many years it lay neglected, was much damaged, and part of its characteristic ap pendages and adjuncts lost. Still, however, it bears a close resemblance to the noble original ; proves an ornament to the gardens, and the admiration of spec tators."], [85, "63 GARDENS. From the Fountain, the path meanders up hill. \u2014 The left is open to the charming vale through which the river glides : the right is occasionally shaded by groups of trees. Almost every step presents a new scene : the transitions are sudden, but never harsh ; even the strong contrast between the elegant sculp ture we have just left, and the wild rock-seats that occupy the brow, gives an additional impression to each. Above these is a noble view into the park : the High Lodge, with its antique battlements amidst an amphitheatre of venerable trees, is a striking ob ject in the landscape. From this spot we wind to the right, and fresh beauties again arrest the atten tion. To paint every change of scenery that presents itself in the space of an hundred yards would be im possible ; the impression can only be conveyed by the eye ; \u2014 the happiest description would fail. At one point we have a glimpse of the river ; at another, perhaps it is lost ; the turrets of the Palace just emerge ; an expanse of water, with a forest line of wood, draws the view ; and, at a few paces distance, the Palace, the river, the two principal bridges, and the fine terrace on the west of the gardens, all burst with irresistible beauty and attraction. At this spot, the sublime predominates in a very high degree; and frigid indeed must that taste be, which will not feel and confess the energy of the scene. When the rising sun throws its horizontal rays on the gilded orbs of Blenheim, the tops of the trees catch his ra- diance, and the withdrawing shade lightly floats on"], [86, "64 GARDENS. the surface of the lake ; nature does not furnish a picture of more brilliancy than this. A little farther, and the intervening groups allow only glimpses ; \u2014 again, the prospect opens, the park displays its sylvan honours on the north, and on the east the Chiltern hills bound the sight. At the ut most extent of vision is Winchendon, formerly the seat of the Duke of Wharton, now the property of the Marlborough family. There is something grand in the idea : the vast space between is swallowed up ; and fancy combining the distant domains in the same landscape, gives a sanction and a solution to the magnificence around. On the right, as we turn down towards the Iron Bridge, stands l'Arrotino, or, as it is usually called, the Listening Slave, a fine cast in bronze from the antique, by Benzi. Descending to the river, from distant views the transition becomes instantaneous to near ones. The water is seen flowing round to the cascade : the bank on the right is abrupt and rocky, chiefly planted with sumach ; on the left, it is adorned with the fairest rising plantations, which are yearly rendering the spot more characteristically ro mantic. all around LTmbrageous grots, and caves of cool recess, And murmuring waters down the slope dispers'd, Or held, by fringed banks, in crystal lakes, Compose a rural seat of various view. Milton."], [87, "65 GARDENS. At a short distance from the Listening Slave is another fine cast, also by Benzi, of the Roman Wrestlers. The Duke, who is known to possess more botani cal taste and skill than any other nobleman in the kingdom, is now laying out a very large piece of ground, which, when finished, will be the finest bota nical and flower garden in England. Aided by the noble proprietor, we are enabled to give the following account of this charming, picturesque spot, the whole embellishments of which are executed not only under the inspection of his Grace, but by his constant di rection and co-operation. Here we cannot avoid regretting that at present strangers can only become acquainted with the beau ties of this garden, by description. When finished, it doubtless will be opened for occasional visitors. \u2014 Its being at present closed from public view should be attributed to the proper cause \u2014 the impossibility of carrying on improvements of this extensive nature amidst the continued interruption of those who are constantly arriving at Blenheim. At the east end of the Palace is a room of thirty feet in length, recently fitted up by the present Duke. The sides and the ceiling are of Waterloo blue puck ered drapery, ornamented at intervals by black ro settes, and a large rosette of the same material in the centre of the ceiling, from which all the ribs of the drapery diverge. This room looks immediately on F"], [88, "66 GARDENS. the Arcade Flower Garden and a Pavilion of an oc tao*on form, lately erected, entirely composed of vari ous coloured woods, with their natural bark. This is supported by columns of yew, with a covered co lonnade around it. Another apartment, intended as a withdrawing room, is now building, which will be annexed to the one already described. It will be forty-two feet long, and will also look on the New Flower Garden. Its walls will be painted to repre sent the Tiger Hunt in India. Immediately ou leav ing these apartments, we pass the New Holland or Botany Bay Garden, which consists of Mimosas, Metrosideros, Pittosporums, and the most curious and beautiful plants from New Holland and Norfolk Island. The Chinese Garden is near this, where all the most curious of the Camellia Tribe, and other valuable Chinese plants, are planted out in the natu ral ground, and, during the winter months, covered by a moss-house. The walk then leads to a view of Handborough steeple, the lake, and the forest and wood on the opposite side, and, at one point, catches a beautiful vista to the High Lodge. From this garden, which is about eight acres, we pass on to a Terrace Garden, ornamented with clumps of the choicest and most shewy American and other hardy exotic plants, which appear to hang on the slopes. \u2014 This charming terrace commands a view of nearly the whole extent of the lake, the wood beyond it, and the column. Hence we proceed to the Aquatic or"], [89, "67 GARDENS. Rock Garden, where all descriptions of aquatic plants are cultivated in a piece of water, surrounded by rock work. We then enter the Dahlia Garden, where all the varieties of these plants, amounting to about two hundred sorts, are planted together, round a clump of about half an acre. This walk leads to the Rose Garden, where more than one thousand sorts of roses, standard and dwarf, are planted. Here we have a view of the Fountain and Cascade. After passing a grotto, and from the beautiful banks of the lake viewing the American clumps and borders, we proceed onwards through this \" paradise of sweets,\" until we complete a walk of nearly two miles and a half, during which we meet with several rustic and other curious and appropriate seats, and a temple, dedicated to Diana, of beautiful and stately structure, designed by Sir William Chambers. In the front are four pillars with Ionic capitals ; and on the pedi ment is this dedication : \u2014 APTEM1AI. ArPIAI-IAAI.

RIVER.* The River, which covers the whole extent of a spa cious valley, bending in the happiest style, and afford ing the most profuse variety of picturesque features in the sublime, the beautiful, and the tranquil, when viewed with its accompaniments, is indisputably the most superb piece of artificial water in this kingdom. * If the words river and lake are sometimes applied to the same thing, it is hoped the reader will not impute this to ignorance or error : the water at Blenheim partakes of the nature of both ; it is a river, because it has a progressive motion ; it is also a lake, because it spreads far be yond its original channel. Thus uniting the distinguishing beauties and characteristics of each, it rises to the pre-eminence of sublimity in kind. It is proper, however, to remark, that it generally receives the name of the Lake from its commencement to the grand bridge, and of the Great Water down to the cascade.\u2014 The whole is stocked with abundance of fine fish, such as pike, perch, carp, tench, &c. Pikes have sometimes been caught here weighing nearly 301bs. These may be truly called, \" the tyrants of the watery plain.\" In a certain part, a very few years ago, 150 brace of fine carp and tench were drawn up in one net by the fisherman."], [92, "70 RIVER It is chiefly supplied by the Glyme,* which still, in a great measure, retains its original direction, its chan nel being expanded rather than altered : so favour able has nature been to the operations of art !

In other points of view, a thick grove, and beauti ful groups of Lombardy poplars, and other trees that love the streams, by concealing the source, promote the same desirable effect. The banks at first are low: on one side they soon become bold and winding ; on the other, they have little elevation, but are happily varied.

From the bridge, a most capital expanse of water again catches the eye ; an expanse unrivalled by the finest English river,t unmixed with the sea ; and which, washing the remote banks, varies with their direction, makes a long diversion up a vale that forms a right angle with its bed, and affords the representa tion of a collateral stream : then rolling a seemingly enlarged volume, it winds round, and washes the foot of the declivity, on which part of the gardens lies ; and on the other side it is bounded by a considerable hill, feathered down with a noble wood to the water's edge, and frequently reflected on its surface. * This is part of the ancient causeway leading to the old Manor House, which stood about one hundred yards farther north. The Lom bardy poplars planted here begin to acquire too determined an ascen dancy over their congeners; and are too much spread over the surface.

Several pleasure vessels of various construc tion, riding at anchor, swans sailing in conscious pride, and other aquatic fowl, indigenous as well as foreign, exercising their native propensities, unite to enliven the watery scene. When tranquil, the re flected and inverted images in the stream present a picture, which fancy contemplates with mild delight ; when agitated with winds, its rippling bosom and wavy dash are lively emblems of the sea, to which it then bears some resemblance. At the point where it appears embayed, it passes under a light iron bridge, simple and unadorned, and characteristic of its destination ; and making a pretty sudden bend, it tumbles down a barrier of massy rocks, with a force equal to its copiousness ; and with a fall of eighteen feet perpendicular, and twenty seven with the angle it forms.

But though in this reach the river admits an oval woody islet, its channel becomes now more contracted than before ; and its style partakes rather of the beautiful than the sublime. Reaching the New Bridge, a very elegant modern structure, it inclines with the course of the vale, and touching near Bladon, makes a determined bend to the right. The banks on both sides at this point are swelling lawn, with little clumps, connected by single trees, disposed without the least shew of intention, but uniting to produce the happiest effect. From hence the river takes a variety of charming turns, chiefly with a strong inclination to the right, doubling, as it were, on itself, and circumscribing the extremity of the hill which accompanies it the greatest part of its course. In one place a fine sheet of water spreads before the eye, and invites progress by its apparent continuity ; in another, the trees seem to embay it, and we advance a considerable way, be fore we can detect the deception. From the first determined sweep near Bladon, a o-ravel walk on the left follows the direction of the river. This walk is bounded on one side by a belt of thick plantation ; on the other, a few scattered trees range with the stream. Beyond the river, we are charmed with all the diversity of pleasing scenery : a small grove first presents itself, close to the verge of"], [98, "74 RIVER the tide ; a few irregular trees next succeed ; some times a clump planted at the termination of a reach, by advancing to the belt on the opposite shore, ap pears to land-lock the stream ; then again we are delighted with open lawn and diversified landscape.

The united rivers forming a woody island immediately after their junction, meander through a continuation of meads, and dispense beauty and fertility, as they flow to join the classic Isis. The effect occasioned by two rivers hastening to meet each other, and then bending almost at right angles with their former course, is as pleasing as it is singular and romantic. No awkward termination is here to be traced, no disgusting display of art to heighten the scene ; Taste unfolds the beauties of Nature with a delicate touch, and Art is only the handmaid to her charms.

While scenes less captivating force attention by a bold dis play, these, like modesty, shun the public eye, and are only visited by the discerning few.

PARK.* The Park is one continued galaxy of charming prospects, and agreeably diversified scenes. It is chiefly extra-parochial ; and contains about two thousand seven hundred acres, round which are the most enchanting rides, chiefly shaded towards the boundary with a deep belt of various trees, evergreens, and deciduous shrubs, whose mingled foliage exhibits the different gradations of tints, from the most faint to the most obfuscated green ; while plantations of corresponding figure and growth on the park side, sometimes range with the former, and sometimes breaking into * That vast space which lies without the River has received the ap propriate appellation of the Great Park ; the portion which is, in a great measure, surrounded by it, of the Little Park. \u2014 (See the Plan._\\ The following meteorological phenomenon deserves to be recorded.

In consequence of this, many trees, and an immense number of branches, were brought to the ground. In Blenheim Park, to which, and a small surrounding space, this phenomenon was confined, nearly one thousand loads of wood were destroyed. The very rooks had their wings frozen, and fell from their perches. Nothing could be more beautiful than the trees in their bril liant coats of mail.

In different places also we meet with venerable oaks, that have seen some centuries pass over their heads, and yet flourish in a green old age. It would be easy to point out some of extraordinary dimensions and beauty, which are perfectly sound ; while the fantastic forms and umbrageous tops of others, with their hearts quite decayed, read many a moral and impressive lesson, which the mind of sensibility may easily apply. Often is the heart of man corroded with care, or broken by neglect, while the forced smile of joy, called up by honest pride, plays on the face ; and externals indicate nothing but happiness, and vigour within. The generous spirit, like the majestic king of the forest, towers unbending to the last ; and, perhaps, when the irresistible storms, by which it has been long buffetted, occasion its fall, the unavailing tear of regret may be shed too late, and the hand that might have been a stay, be extended in vain ! The usual ride round the park, for occasional vi sitors, includes a circumference of rather more than three miles, describing a wide circle round the Palace and Gardens, which are casually and advantageously seen through glades in the progress, and exhibiting many magnificent pictures over the park and country round. This Ride has ever been considered as the first of natural charms that Blenheim supplies, and as the coup d'\u0153il and compendium of all the rest ; and as it may be taken in a carriage or on horseback, it is neither accompanied with fatigue nor delay."], [103, "79 THE PARK. In this delightful tour, we pass from scenes the most adorned, to open grove,* and even to the wild majesty of a native forest, with no abrupt or un pleasing transition. Glades, lawns, gentle hills, re tiring vales, wood and water, so sweetly blend and harmonize in the landscape, that the eye every where finds novelty and interest, and acknowledges the ef fect of contrast and design, without revolting at its display. But to enumerate every beauty conspicuous in this tour, would be to delineate all that is charm ing in natural objects ; and in some instances would occasion a repetition of circumstances already re marked. A detail must not, therefore, be expected. Let it, however, be observed, that at Blenheim the ferme ornee is combined with the magnificent park. In one quarter, the eye is delighted with the sight of waving corn ; in another, with green paddocks that invite the scythe : here a building, dedicated to agri cultural purposes, or raised for the accommodation of the necessary officers, just peeps through the deep shade of surrounding trees ; there the team rattles down the slope abrupt. On one side appears a herd of deer; on another, a flock of sheep: and sometimes animals, native and foreign, graze in social peace. \u2014 All is a picture of rural life in its most agreeable co- lours, in its happiest avocations : it presents cheerful * It is said that the trees to the eastward of Blenheim, which now form an open grove, were originally planted in battalia ; and of this there are still many evident traces : but the axe has long since judi ciously broken their ranks, and restored them to taste and nature."], [104, "80 THE PARK. activity, or tranquil repose \u2014 Arcadian scenes divested of fable, and real wealth without glitter. Among the many captivating views which every spectator of taste will recognize in the tour of the Park, those from the High Lodge and the Obelisk may be particularized. The High Lodge was once the residence of the witty, but immoral Wilmot, Earl of Rochester, and the place where he died. Let those who have copied his profligacy, reflect on his remorse, and resolve to imitate his repentance ! Here dying Wilmot caught religion's flame, And breath'd contrition for a life of shame ; Condemn'd his wit, revok'd his follies past, And fix'd his anchor on the skies at last. From hence, the prospect is not only very exten sive, but is also one of the most attractive that can be conceived ; it includes, among a variety of other capital and picturesque objects, a distant view of the University of Oxford in one direction, and of a richly wooded country, in which Wychwood Forest bounds the landscape, in another. Enchanting site ! hence every rural sweet, And every natural charm delight to meet. Hence to the eye the landscape opens wide ; The dancing spirits roll a quicker tide.

He saw, He attacked, nor stopped, but to conquer the Enemy. He forced the Bavarians, sustained by the French, in their strong Intrenchments at Schellenberg. He passed the Danube. A second Royal Army, composed of the best Troops of France, was sent to reinforce the first. That of the Confederates was divided. With one part of it the Siege of Ingolstadt was carried on : with the other, the Duke gave Battle to the united strength of France and Bavaria.

These have long been re moved or demolished ; but correct drawings of the whole, by Lewington, of Woodstock, (who saved copies,) are in the possession of the Antiquary So ciety.t The two largest apartments are very accu rately and beautifully represented in an elegantly ex ecuted engraving by that ingenious self-taught artist, Fowler.

While the field was inclosing, the writer of this saw a very beautiful border of one of the tesselated areas unco vered.

Some of the intrench- ments cast up on this occasion are still visible on the brow of the hill above Queen Pool; and the parterres and knots of the ancient gardens are distinctly to be traced on the lawn in front of Churchill's Pillar. Some venerable and majestic remains of the Manor House were to be seen till after the building of Blen heim,* when every trace of the ancient edifice was removed, and two sycamore trees were planted to mark its site.

His brother, the illustrious Alfred, who mounted the throne in 872, not only occasionally resided at Wood stock, but, according to a MS. in the Cottonian Li brary, spent so much of the little space here, in which he was disengaged from his numerous wars, that he translated TBoethius de Consolatione Philo sophies ; and about the same time he is supposed to have founded the University of Oxford, or rather to have restored it.

Camden, in his Britannia, says, that King Ethel red, father of Edward the Confessor, \" Apud Wood stock olim ordinum conventum habuit, et leges tulit;\" that is, held a convention of the states at Woodstock, and passed laws. And from the censual roll, or sur vey made in the eighteenth year of William the Con queror, commonly called Doomsday Book, it appears that Woodstock was then a borough, and that the demesnes were afforested. Rous, the historian, tells us, that this was the first park in England : in point of natural beauty and elegant embellishments, it still maintains priority ! Dugdale seems to be of Rous's opinion ; and William of Malmesbury, and others, inform us, that King Henry I. furnished it with fo reign wild beasts, which he procured from other princes, or bought up at a great expense. Certain it is, that this monarch at least beautified the palace, and surrounded the park with a wall, which in many places still remains ; whether he built them from the ground, is by no means so clear.* At the mention of Woodstock, the name of Henry II. naturally occurs : for who has not heard of Henry * Not only the park, but the town of Woodstock, was made by Henry I.

This celebrated beauty was daugh ter of Walter Lord Clifford. At the early age of fifteen she possessed sufficient charms to captivate a warrior king, who seduced her from her friends, and erected a bower for her reception, and a labyrinth by which her romantic retreat might communicate with the palace, and prevent any surprisal from the vin dictive jealousy of his Queen. This precaution, however, is said to have proved ineffectual, and that the lovely frail one at length fell a victim to the resentment of the injured and impla cable Eleanor. Ill-fated fair! by Henry led astray, And taught to tread Seduction's thorny way ; Lur'd from parental arms, ere prudence' call Fix'd Virtue's wish, or pietur'd Vice's fall ; Immur'd by Love in solitary bowers, And doom'd to wither like the desert flowers ! The manner of her discovery, and the nature of her death, are variously related, and much disputed ; and authentic history does not furnish us with a clue to unravel them. It is probable, however, that she fell the victim of disease, and that the legend of her being poisoned by Eleanor has no foundation in truth. Rosamond was buried in the choir of Godstow Nun nery, near Oxford, where a magnificent tomb was erected to her memory,* surrounded with tapers con- * See notices of Rosamond's Tomb in the Gentleman's Magazine for November, 1791, p. 985 ; and of the foundation of Godstow, in the"], [123, "THE PARK. 97 tinually burning, till the beginning of King Richard's reign, when Hugh, Bishop of Lincoln, in his primary visitation, coming to Godstow, and being offended at the extraordinary veneration he saw paid to a wo man of her unfortunate description, burst into a fit of zeal, and ordered her remains to be removed, and deposited in a less sacred place. His injunction was complied with, and the nuns interred her in their chapter-house, covering her grave with a flat stone, on which was inscribed no more than Tomba Rosa mundi. What is now shewn for Rosamond's tomb, and some miserable verses recorded as her epitaph, are only inventions to amuse the credulous, and baits for the ignorant : at the dissolution of the hionastery more important objects were obliterated, more extra ordinary events consigned to oblivion. Curiosity will be eager to be gratified with an ac count of her bower, her labyrinth, and her bath ; cir cumstances so universally known by report, and so intimately connected with the scenes described. Of the bower, there is neither authentic history, nor drawing extant* \u2014 of the labyrinth, some traces of same work, for August, 1787, p. 676. It stands in a low meadow be tween Wolvercot and Wytham, surrounded by different branches of the Isis. What is called the Chapel, now serves for cattle to take shelter in. A few of the bounding walls, and some ancient arches, are the only other remains of this once celebrated nunnery ; and some of these have very lately been demolished for the sake of the materials ! * In Antony a Wood's Study, W. 276, there is, however, a descrip tion of Rosamond's Bower, and Woodstock Park, supposed to be writ ten by Mr. Aubrey.

The spring that must have supplied her bath re tains her name ; and truly is \" Health to the sick, and solace to the swain.\" It is situated in a small dell in the side of the hill, a little to the westward of the grand bridge, and a few paces from the edge of the lake. It gushes from an artificial aperture, in the stones which line the cavity on the north to a considerable elevation, with a fall of nearly two feet, and a copiousness and equability in every season, that few springs exceed. Scarcely has it smoothed its ruffled wave, before it is received into a capacious bath, about five feet deep and twenty square, lined at the bottom and on the sides with free-stone, and fenced with iron palisades. The water of the bath is so pellucid and tranquil, that it reflects objects like a mirror ; and for this purpose poets and lovers have assigned it to beauty, which seems to be indigenous here. The facing over the fall is formed of a dusky co loured stone ; the layers terminate abruptly on the sides with the resemblance of a ruin ; and the whole has the air of antiquity. To increase this appearance, it bears many marks of the universal passion \u2014 the"], [125, "99 THE PARK. love of fame. This has prompted numbers to carve the initials of their names, and the year of their ex ploit, with characteristic rudeness, and with a seem ing zeal for their preservation. In one part we see names which now, perhaps, have no other memorial; in another, recent efforts to impress a remembrance, by obliterating what former engravers have left as monuments of their existence. Thus it is in life : in the most important transactions, in the greatest per formances ! In a solitude like this, where the subject and the scene are apt to inspire pensive thoughts, such traces are not unpleasing : they tend to promote one general effect, to which every circumstance here contributes \u2014 the love of contemplation. The hawthorn, mixed with woodbines and other shrubs, overhangs the spring, and forms a deep irregular shade ; the gad ding ivy, and its congenerous plants, clasp the stones that line the precipice, and fill up the fissures and interstices with their roots. Behind rises a grove, which is rapidly thickening its gloom, and assisting to render the spot more sequestered. The birds earol around ; the nightingale, perhaps, pours forth her plaintive notes ; and the dashing of the water unites with the reverberations of the neighbouring echo, to cherish a soothing melancholy. When this mood has been indulged till relief becomes desirable, we may turn to the palace. The aspect on this hand is more cheerful ; <d open.

The nuptials of the Lady Ermengard, daughter of Richard Viscount Beaumont, cousin to Henry, with William, King of Scotland, were also celebrated here with the utmost magnificence, for four successive , days.

Here Henry III. in 1238, narrowly escaped assas sination, by a person named Ribbaud, who suffered for his meditated treason ; here John Hastings, Earl of Pembroke, was slain, at a Christmas festivity, in the reign of Richard II. ; and here an attempt was made on the life of Henry VIII. by Wm. Morisco. Chaucer, the father of English poetry, spent some of his happiest hours at this place ; it even contends for the honour of his birth, and unquestionably he has made it classic ground. The park was the scene of his favourite wanderings ; and many of the rural descriptions in his poems are borrowed from thence. In his poem of the Cuckoo and the Nightingale, we may trace his morning walk from his own house down the vale, through which the Glyme used to wind within its narrow banks, before it was expanded by art. In his Dream, too, he describes the Bower as a white castle, with its sylvan accompaniments of maples. If we make allowance for the rust of age, and the obsolete modes of diction that now obscure his works, no one has ever equalled him in the vari ous walks of poetry he adopted. * The author of this Description has for several years been making collections for a History of Woodstock.

Several writers of reputation mention a huge folio volume of his works, in manuscript, chained to a reading desk in his liouse, and which is said to have been extant in the beginning of the last century, or the end of the preceding : that it once existed, we have no doubt ; but the precise time when it disap peared, and what has become of it, are totally un known.

With regard to the former celebrity of this place, we cannot forbear adding, that the Princess Elizabeth was confined in the Manor House by her cruel sister, Queen Mary, under the care of Sir H. Beddingfield : and that her life was once in the most imminent danger, from a fire that broke out under the room where she slept : but whether this fire was kindled intentionally, or merely through accident, remains among the number of undeveloped mysteries with which the path of antiquity is strewed.

This man, it seems, was a roy alist, and anxious to impress the commissioners with an idea of supernatural agency against their proceed ings ; and, perhaps, their own consciences aided the imposture. A circumstance of this kind would have been deemed unworthy regard, had it not been to intro duce a remark on the triumph of true philosophy, and the decline of superstition. A learned professor in the University, in the reign of Charles II. fills several pages of his book, on the Natural History of Oxfordshire, with a detail of the pranks of this ima ginary demon, among other reveries as ridiculous, * It appears that Lieutenant-General Fleetwood obtained a grant of the Manor House and its appurtenances, which he sold for one thousand pounds.

Three miles from Blenheim, near the village of Northleigh, at a short distance from the river Even lode, and about half a mile to the right of the turn pike road from Woodstock to Witney, is a ROMAN VILLA. In the year 1813, the Rev. W. Brown, rector of an adjoining parish, accidentally observed several fragments of Roman bricks and tiles, which induced him to cause researches to be made on the spot where they were found. The foundations of an extensive building were soon traced, but the examination was deferred till the year 1815, when a large room and several passages were discovered, ornamented with tesselated pavements, evidently of Roman construc tion. On this being communicated to the Duke of Marlborough, to whom the land belonged, his Grace gave orders for continuing the work, and caused a house to be built on the spot for the residence of a person to prevent the depredations of the antiquary,"], [134, "108 ROMAN VILLA. who might probably prefer seeing a part of these relics of the Romans in his own collection, to a view of them on their original site. The building appears to have been a Roman villa, originally forming a quadrangle of about two hundred feet square, and which had for ages past been entirely buried in the earth. A plan of this villa is published by Mr. Hake will, describing the form, dimensions, &c. of the dif ferent apartments discovered up to December, 1810. The principal room is covered over to prevent its re ceiving injury by exposure to the weather, as is also a large warm bath in excellent preservation ; the flues round it remain, and also the pillars of the hypocaust, and even part of the pipe which conveyed away the water. Other baths have been found in different parts of the building. The room, No. 1, in Mr. Hakewill's plan, richly merits the attention of the curious. It has a tesselated pavement, with a hypo caust under it, which clearly points out the mode of warming the apartments of the Romans. Its dimen sions are thirty-three feet by twenty. In another covered room near this a quantity of wheat, turned black by age, is preserved, which was found in one of the apartments. Several broken articles of earth enware have been discovered, and one small urn, very little damaged. The manner of laying the tesselated pavement is clearly perceptible : it differs totally from our method of paving, and is well calculated to pre serve the rooms from the dampness of the earth.

The Ro mans left Britain entirely in the year 448 : therefore the remains of this building must be at least 1380 years old, and probably of much higher antiquity, as the Romans were in possession of the greater part of this country nearly four hundred years. A few abridged extracts from the ancient customs of the Manor of Woodstock, taken in the reign of Edward VI. will still farther gratify curiosity, from their intimate connection with the subject of this manual. To the Manor and Honour of Woodstock belong seven demesne towns or villages, Hordley, Wootton, Combe, Stonesfield, Handborough, Bladon, and Old Woodstock, the tenants of which are discharged from tolls in all fairs and markets, and possess other pecu liar privileges. There are three several kinds of land in this Manor, demesne or bury land, free land, and customary land, the latter of which descends to the youngest son or daughter, as heir.

The customary tenants of Handborough, Combe, and Bladon, were bound to cut and make all the grass growing in Woodstock park, for which every township was to have sixpence in money, or two gallons of ale. The customary tenants of Hordley, by tenure, were to sweep and make clean all the chambers in the Manor House, as often as the King visited it, for which they were to receive two castes of bread, and two gallons of ale ; and the owner of the Manor place of Combe in like manner was to clean all jakes and privies within and about the King's Manor of Woodstock. The Lord of Staunton Harcourt, by tenure, was to find four browsers in Woodstock park, at any time when the snow should fall and lie for the space of two days, in order to furnish provisions for the deer ; and every browser was allowed to carry to his lodg ing, as long as the snow lasted, a billet of wood, every night, the length of his axe-helm, and to be borne on his axe's edge. The King's bailiff of the hundred of Wootton was to give warning of the browsers being wanted, by blowing a horn at the Manor gate of Staunton Harcourt, on which he was to be served with a caste of bread, a gallon of ale, and a piece of cheese ; and the said Lord of Staun-"], [137, "111 MANOR OF WOODSTOCK. ton Harcourt, as a compensation, was to have one buck in summer, and one doe in winter, out of Woodstock park.

The customary tenants of the demesne towns were bound to carry the hay growing on the meads in Woodstock park to the King's barn, for the support of the deer in winter, for which they were to have sevenpence a day ; and to be allowed, on going home, to carry off as much hay as would lie in the bed of their carts."], [138, "112 WOODSTOCK. WOODSTOCK. The ancient borough of Woodstock, which gives the title of Viscount to the Duke of Portland, is situated on an eminence, near the banks of the Glyme, and enjoys every local advantage that can contribute either to health or pleasure. The amenity of the situation, indeed, can only be exceeded by the purity of the air, which is so great, that valetudina rians have frequently been recommended to breathe it.

The Duke of Marlborough is High Steward of this borough. The parish or chapelry of New Woodstock, in cluding the adjacent hamlet of Hensington, both ap pendant to Bladon, contains about two hundred and fifty houses or separate tenements, and upwards of fifteen hundred inhabitants. Within these few years, the town has been much . improved ; and in many essential respects, it is im- possible to find a more desirable residence, especially for persons retiring from the bustle of business with moderate fortunes, or for those who wish to live on a limited income, in a comfortable, unostentatious man- ner. The beauty and facility of the promenades offer advantages superior to the command of a carriage in most other places ; as the whole town is so compact, that the most remote part of it is within five minutes walk of Blenheim Park. The situation is one of the most central in the kingdom, the roads are good, the means of conveyance numerous, and rent, rates, and taxes, under all circumstances, peculiarly reasonable. The seat of Pryse Pryse, Esq. and the Rectory, both commanding beautiful views over the lake and i2"], [142, "116 WOODSTOCK. the northern part of the park, are universally ad mired for their situation. Among the ornaments, however, of this place, whether viewed in a moral or an architectural light, may be reckoned the elegant Alms Houses, near the entrance of the borough from Oxford, erected and liberally endowed, in 1797. by Caroline, Duchess of Marlborough, for six poor widows. Power, riches, and grandeur, are little to be en vied, except when they are exerted to promote the less fortunate meritorious, and to relieve the dis tressed. It is the exercise of those qualities alone that can render them amiable in the eyes of others, or a real pleasure to their possessors. May this example of beneficence serve as an incentive to others ! * * For wishing to preserve the following Sonnet, as an humble tribute of justice, truth, and gratitude, the author trusts he shall find an apo logist in every liberal mind. Flattery to the living never disgraced his pen ; nor will it be supposed that a few wild flowers strewed on the grave are grateful to the dead, though they may serve to evince the affectionate recollection of the feeling heart. The Duchess of Marlbo rough has long been beyond the reach of praise or blame ; but till the last pulse of life her memory will be cherished by me, and her good deeds ought to be recorded to posterity, from which the impartial meed is certain.

Queen Elizabeth, in particular, was a great benefactress ; she bestowed on the Mayor and Commonalty four shops, and thirteen cottages, for merly belonging to the dissolved chantry of our Lady, founded in Woodstock chapel by King John in 1210; and also confirmed the grant of Henry VI. of a cer tain marsh, called The Pool, or Le Pool, now con verted into fertile meadows, which let for about four guineas per acre. The Town Hall is a stately modern stone edifice, standing in the most favourable situation for effect ; and was built at the sole expense of the late High Steward. The Market House, which has recently undergone a complete repair, is likewise eligibly situated, and sufficiently adapted for its destination. The markets are well supplied with provisions ; and a considerable share of business, especially in the corn trade, is The widow weeps \u2014 the orphan droops unseen, And fortune's favourites stand with cold averted mien.

A Friday's market, the grant of Elizabeth, is too much neglected, both for the real benefit of deal ers and of the inhabitants. From causes of this kind, towns frequently date their decay ; for markets, which naturally excite competition, soon encourage combination by disuse. It is every where the duty of magistrates to guard against this. The Church, or Chapel, more properly speaking, has a modern front, and a handsome new tower, with a ring of eight well-toned bells, and a set of melodi ous chimes, which go every four hours, and play a different tune for every day in the week. It contains an organ, and is well pewed, and well attended. It is of ancient foundation, has long been paro chial, and is presented to, with the rectory of Bladon, of which it was originally considered as an occasional chapel of ease, probably served by the chantry priest ; though, from the change of times and circumstances, and the loss, alienation, or neglect of endowments, it is now become very onerous and expensive to the rector of the mother church. Notwithstanding the ancient celebrity of the place, there are few monuments deserving notice, if we ex cept that to the memory of Dr. King, Dean of Raphoe, and his son, Captain James King, the friend and coadjutor of Captain Cook, in his last voyage, part of the history of which was written at Wood stock : nor are the inscriptions remarkable for ele gance, with the exception of that on the small tablet,"], [145, "119 WOODSTOCK. which records a former rector, Dr. Thomas King, Chancellor of Lincoln, which is equally simple and beautiful.

The master must be a person in holy orders. The School-room, which is large and lofty, received a complete repair in 1811 ; and every thing has been done on the part of the Corporation, which the funds allowed, to render this useful establishment a real benefit to the place. The inns furnish the best entertainment and ac commodation to travellers of every description. \u2014 These are the Bear, Marlborough Arms, Angel, &c."], [146, "120 WOODSTOCK. Lying on the great Irish Road, the inns are full of business, at all seasons of the year ; though more particularly during the spring, summer, and autumn, when Blenheim presents its diversified and ever vary ing attractions to visitors, whether on purpose or in cidentally. As a proof of the facility of its commu nication with most parts of the kingdom, especially with the metropolis, more than a dozen stage and mail coaches pass and repass daily to and from Lon don, besides a Woodstock coach, called the Blenheim, which starts at eight every morning, and returns at five in the afternoon, through Wycombe. Waggons and vans are likewise frequent ; also a Woodstock waggon thrice a week. The principal manufactures are polished steel and gloves, and in both branches the peculiar excellence of their fabrics has gained them distinguished pre eminence. In one respect, they have left the fable of Midas no longer an object of wonder : at their touch, the old nails of a horse-shoe are converted into arti cles of infinitely greater price, according to their weight, than the purest gold. A chain made here, weighing only two ounces, was sold in France for \u00a3170 sterling. The manufacture of polished steel was introduced here by a Mr. Metcalfe, about the beginning of the last century ; but is now much de clined, on account of the cheapness of the Birming ham and Sheffield wares, though in elegance still unrivalled ; and, with more prosperous times, will, it is to be hoped, revive again. The glove trade, how-"], [147, "WOODSTOCK. 121 ever, is tolerably flourishing, and employs many hands. Upwards of five hundred dozen pairs are made weekly in the town, and the neighbouring vil lages. The delicacy of the leather, and the neatness of the workmanship, distinguish the Woodstock gloves and fancy articles from all other. About thirty years ago, in pulling down an old building near the church, several pieces of ancient coin were found, and, among them, two of the Em peror Vespasian, with this inscription round the head, in characters very legible and neat : Vespasianus Rom. Imp. Aug. On the reverse, Jud\u00e6a capta. Indeed, Roman coins are still casually found here. \u2014 That nation indubitably had several stations in this vicinity, and probably one at this place ; * Alecti Castra, or Alchester on the Akeman, was less than ten miles distant ; and the tesselated pavements near Stonesfield, and at Northleigh, as well as the Camp on Callow Hill, are unquestionable vestiges of that once potent people.

Yet who would prefer exploring the earth for urns, rusty coins, and half obliterated castrametations, to the contemplation of recent art and blooming nature, arrayed in their gayest dress, and captivating with their brightest charms ?

The Cherwell, the Glyme, and the Evenlode, each produces its appropriate aquatics. In Blenheim park, too, and its immediate environs, the general stores of Flora are extremely extensive and various.
