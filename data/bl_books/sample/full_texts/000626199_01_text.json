It was a pretty villa, all buried in roses and creepers, where Count Valiery at an early age had retired to forget, but never to for give, a heartless woman's desertion. After many years of persuasion on the part of his friends, he consented to be united to a very charming girl, whose beauty, added to her many qualities of heart and mind, made him a contented, if not a happy, man. The quiet rural life he led suited him admirably, inasmuch as he disliked all the pomp and vanity of the world. Most carefully educated, and even sedu lously prepared for a diplomatic career (which i:"], [14, "ANTHEA. 2 was brought to an early close through his disappointment in love), his tastes were de cidedly of the classical order, and to be left to the peaceful enjoyment of his books was to him the only bliss on earth. He took the warmest interest in the revo lutionary movement, but fearing that Greece was not ready to shake off the yoke of either Christian or Mussulman, he would not give a public support to the Salamos,* Kalvos, f * \" Count Salamos,\" then a rising poet, born at Zante 1798, author of the hymn of \" Liberty,\" the Marseillaise of the Greek, set to music by Mangari.

Salamos was a great friend of Tricoupis, who helped and influenced him in no small degree in his works. t \" Kalvos \" was a great scholar and original poet, native of Zante, and a great friend of Foscolo, whom he followed to London, where he was twice married to English ladies. \" Kalvos \" wrote several odes on patriotism.

In those days it was the custom of good families to place their sons with friends, to develop their tastes, and encourage them in pursuits suited to their abilities. Count Valiery had an old friend in Thes saly. Both had been at the same school, and later on at the University of Padua, where they were linked in a great friendship. It was, therefore, in no way strange that one day a letter was handed to the Comte, an nouncing the arrival of his friend's son by the next ship. \" You are a clever man,\" wrote Kupiot; Katinaki, \" knowing the world well ; and, besides, I hear you are trying farming near Corfu.

But she dared not broach the subject to her husband. She, however, found out indirectly that the youth was of an old Thessalian family, whose lands had been confiscated. The Turks, fearing that the wealth of the Kati nakis might be too great a power, had even incarcerated for seventeen years the grand father of the boy who was expected ; but, notwithstanding his long confinement, the old man, by dint of work and perseverance, re covered some of the family property.

Not having had a sister, the contact with women at first had made Aristides feel shy ; but this soon wore off, and he began to anticipate with pleasure their company in riding, boating, or scrambling in the woods. The May-night festivities were as eagerly looked forward to by him as by the young girls. The whole night was on these occasions devoted to the culling of flowers, to be woven into garlands, which were then thrown into the lake or river with some name attached to each.

Strange to say, Anthea's wreath always followed that of Aristides ; the teasing that followed becoming a family joke, at which the modern Romeo used to blush as only youths of eighteen can. She, a mere child of four teen, enjoyed the fun, adding unconsciously to the fire. But the day soon came when she awoke from child's dreamland. Aristides received orders from his father to go to a German \" Landwirth,\" to acquire more practical know ledge, and when, after the three years of happy bliss, he came to bid farewell to the family, his heart was heavy, and he only then realised how much he loved the little maiden.

It was one of those perfect days, with the sky of that red dish-violet hue which is only seen in Greece.

Animated by the gay surroundings, under the genial quasi-tropical sun, the youth lost self-control, and he who never meant to open his heart, especially to a mere child, though his eyes spoke the intense love he had vainly tried to conceal, was now, however, drawn to the foolish act of swearing to Anthea an ever lasting devotion, pleading his cause with those words that only sanguine youths can utter. \u2022 Poor little Anthea was taken by surprise ; but what girl is too young to feel when real love pours its mellow sounds into her too willing ear ?

His idea of a home was as modest as his impetuous desire to secure Anthea was great, and when he saw the small girl, moulded into a far lovelier woman than his imagination could have conceived, his youthful love gave way to the stronger passion of manhood.

Aristides, noticing the troubled expression on his wife's countenance, and suspecting the motive of Ali Pacha's admiration, felt, too, that the future was fraught with danger not to be overlooked ; for even husbands and fathers were impotent to stem the cruel tide of Turkish wantonness.

The horrid Luki Nouma had, by sneaking, according to his manner, learned everything that happened in the house, and it was he who, indirectly, had secured a buyer. Most reluctantly did Aristides leave his family, after giving earnest directions to his wife, children, and servants to keep the Turks at a distance. And, embracing his dearly beloved ones, with a heavy heart he rode off, leaving his wife bathed in tears, with the new baby in her arms.

Unable to leave the children, and fearing also that this might be a per fidious snare of Ali Pacha's to get her from home, she dared not herself venture from the house, but sent a trusted servant to find her husband.

A week had elapsed since the sad news reached Anthea, when, to her horror, her faithful old housekeeper was found poisoned. Fearing to take another, the young widow determined to attend herself to her own household.

With a purse scantily furnished, Anthea, piously desiring to have her husband's remains suitably interred at Zagora, still lingered on.

A wild knock at the door arrested her chain of thoughts, and four men, armed to the teeth, confronted her, ordering her imme diate presence before Ali Pacha. \" Although disparaging remarks are said to have been passed by you on the negli gence of us Turks in not finding the mur derers of your husband, yet his Excellency, feeling lenient towards a poor widow, has sent his carriage for you and the children, as he wishes to be most kind to you.\""], [57, "ANTHEA. 45 \" How dare you insult a widow by breath ing into her ear the name of Ali Pacha and of his harem ?

Maddened by despair, Anthea took the only thing at hand \u2014 -the irons from the grate \u2014 to defend herself; and Joan of Arc could not have fought more heroically than she did.

If man or woman asked them why they were running, they would jump, yell, or pretend to scratch them ; then turn somersaults, and look so wild, that, frightened at their antics, people ran out of their way.

It was a heavy dull day, and with the great weight she carried she could hardly pro ceed ; but the hateful thought that she \u2014 proud of being purely Greek by birth and marriage \u2014 should enter a Mussulman's harem served to renew all her energy.

The rain by this time descended in tor rents, penetrating even through their clothes. Lightning was throwing its evanescent flame over the forest, terrifying the children, who could not help crying piteously with fear. During one of the flashes they fortunately espied some trunks of old trees, covered with ivy and evergreens. \" Let us hide here,\" said Dimos, in a faint"], [65, "ANTHEA. 53 voice.

Their bread was soon devoured, and Tony's head quickly dropped in heavy sleep on his mother's knee. The atmosphere, charged with electricity, made the evening still more oppressive ; nevertheless, Anthea could not take rest.

The Turks were approaching the hiding place, and the last ray of hope was fading away as the miscreants drew nearer faster and faster. A fearful peal of thunder now awoke the baby, who began to yell frightfully. Poor Anthea knew that if she could not stop the child's crying all hope was over. She put her to her breast ; but, alas ! the shock she had sustained and the blood she had lost had exhausted the source of nature's sustenance.

But it was useless. The thud of horses' feet echoed on the drum of her ears, whilst scared by the yells of the baby. Ancl then (the devil must have possessed the poor mother) Anthea, whose every look beamed with pure love for her family, grudged the very life of this innocent child, whom she regarded as the murderess of her other darlings.

She again prayed, in her despair, that her child might be granted rest ; but louder and o o ' louder grew its cries, and nearer and nearer drew her pursuers.

The nearer her pursuers advanced, the more she felt in her mind that she had quieted one child to save two others. Any thing was preferable to being subjected to Ali Pacha's disgraceful tyranny. She felt she was destined to avenge her murdered husband, and to baffle the man whose yoke was so loathsome, but whom no individual dare thwart, and from whose bar barous clutches none could escape.

A little sigh, and then something gently moved on her knee, reminding her that Tony had slept peacefully. Having carried the baby so far, she no longer felt its weight, and, indeed, forgot it for a time. She tried to remember where she was, and how she came there.

She did not dare say anything of this dreadful calamity to either of the boys, but went on meditating what was next to be done. It really was only when the sun had quite unveiled himself to man's gaze behind the grey clouds, and his rays played fully on the dear little face, that the mother knew what its whiteness revealed.

Yes, she must now try to live mechanically, and stifle all feelings of love, and only do her duty by her children. As Matthew Henry says, \" Duties are ours; events are God's.\" She must trust to Him. She felt that God, in His infinite mercy, would forgive her, as she was beside herself at the time with fear ; but she could never in this world forgive herself.

How peaceful it all seemed ! Nature had donned the garb of rest. It was despairingly quiet ! Even the habitual rustle of leaves had ceased, and before them lay, grandly ex panded, a large wild moorland, with rugged rocks in the distance. Anthea gave an inquiring, but not admir ing, gaze on the magnificently wild panorama. What was a picturesque view to her ? If she could but see a human habitation or a little water !

Dimos's mischievous tricks of olden days now proved useful, for he advised climbing in from the top, and showed his mother how it could be done.

Here it was that next day, before the lark had tried her voice in her first tuneful trill, a rugged shepherd-boy found them. His astonishment at the invasion knew no bounds. He was a simple country boy, whose notions of life were very restricted, and whose fear of all strangers was probably quite as great as that of meeting wild beasts.

The Klephts were divided into two parties, if one may say so \u2014 the tame Klephts, the Armatoli, who never pillaged or were accused of brigandage ; and the wild Klephts, who at times have been known to transgress their orders through indigence, and even rob the monks, but never a church, as they belonged to the Orthodox faith. All the Klephts -were very chivalrous to women, and were never known to dishonour even a Turkish woman. One of their many chiefs \u2014 Captain Tashes \u2014 is supposed to have saved thousands of girls whom the Albanians had carried off.

After that Marco Botzaris went for some years to France, before going to Corfu, and later on joining Kolokotronis. He was an ardent patriot, and gifted with all the talent and qualities of a hero. The siege of Artis, 1821, was the greatest among his many feats of arms. Marco Botzaris was a terror to the Turks for many years.

It is said that the grandfather slew seven hundred Turks ere he was him self killed. Kolokotronis was, as a child, taken prisoner with his mother, and saw several members of his family hung, mutilated, and exposed to all manner of indignities ere, at fifteen years of age, he headed the army.

He was a tall bent man, with a clear blue penetrating eye. Although his look was stern and cold, he was known to have performed many generous deeds.

Among his many feats of arms was his defence of Tripo litza, 1821, a town of thirty thousand inhabitants, which he defended with a few hundred men. He beat thousands of Turks who were under Drama Ali. His power grew daily, and he was so feared by the Bavarians that they had him called before a court-martial for treason against the throne ; but although King Otho was not of age then he would not sign the death-warrant of the liberator of Greece, so he died a natural death at peace with all his enemies. f Niko Tsaras was a Thessalian by birth.

In this mad flight they did not see the frightened family perched in the trees, or most likely they would have turned back ; for wild boars, unless wounded and at bay, are afraid to meet human beings, and if the latter keep quiet, as a rule they pass them unperceived.

When anchored, and able to grope his way, Athana sius to his dismay had lost sight of his treasure. He was ashamed to own it, and obeying a wild impulse he followed his first inspiration. Spiro would not leave the boat \" The captain remains on board,'' he gravely said to his mate. \" When you have found your golden treasure, and if this lull in the wind continues, we can go on. I give you two hours in which to bring your bags of gold here.\""], [249, "ANTHEA. 237 When within reach of the goal it seems a pity to give in ; so Athanasius called out, \" All right,\" ancl went on. The yielding sand abounded with stones, and to pick his way in the darkness was troublesome. He also felt discouraged at being alone in his search. o o It is so much pleasanter to have company when involved in uncertainty. Honour and glory we don't willingly share, but it is so delightful and tempting to put blame on other people, or get others to divide with us our troubles and dangers. Athanasius' wandering o o on the soft beach might have been pleasant, but stumbling over stones fanned his warm temper, and some elegant language followed when he measured his length on the beach. \" Bother it, if I go on ; \" but remembering ' o o the everlasting jeers he would have to en counter from Spiro and others, he walked more cautiously, feeling his way to avoid the obstacles, and tried to keep from falling."], [250, "ANTHEA. 238 \" Stern fate and black sky won't improve my temper,\" he reflected. \" What a fool I was to have been tempted to go after this phantom treasure ! I daresay Spiro is right, and it is mere fancy ; \" but on he walked in sheer bravado, fearing the ridicule of the chattering tongues of busybodies. Presently his foot touched something soft. Thinking it was a heap of sea-weed, and delighted to fling something in the air to counteract his rising temper, he was just going to pull up the fancied weeds when he stumbled and very nearly fell ; and to save himself, he put a hand out, which touched something soft and damp, but less sticky and more bulky than the sea-weed he expected to find. On such dark, wild nights, only cats and owls could possibly see. Athanasius had to grope his way. He bent down and, kneeling, gradually felt with his hands the body of a child,"], [251, "ANTHEA. 239 then another, then a woman, as he guessed from the clothes, and,- lastly, a baby. Cold perspiration was on his brow, and in fearful trepidation he continued his examina tion. It made him shudder to feel those damp, icy faces. The hands were quite stiff. He tried to lift one of the bodies, and the water trickling from the clothes ran in a small stream. He lifted the woman, but her weight was great. \" I must whistle for Spiro to help me,\" he murmured ; but the latter having found an old oil-skin had rolled himself up comfortably, and with head back, and mouth open, was enjoying a different tune, and one that musicians don't like to own they ever practise. Night is both dark and deaf, and can keep a secret. \u25a0 After whistling in vain a little while, Athanasius felt the need of immediate action, so taking one of the children in his arms, he went back, continuing his whistling all the way,"], [252, "ANTHEA. 240 until he succeeded in reaching Spiro, who was enjoying his rest, rocked by the boisterous waves. When nearing the caique, he shouted out \u2014 \" Are you deaf or heartless, Spiro ? Here is a dead family on the shore, and you don't lift a finger of that lazy body of yours.\" This appeal had the desired effect on Spiro. Up he jumped, and rubbing his eyes exclaimed, \" Dead bodies ! \" Never giving a thought to the conse quences of so sad a find, out of the boat he leaped, and wading to his knees he ran to meet Athanasius. \" Who ? What ? Where ? \" and many other questions he uttered, as by the faint light of a few scattered stars he tried to examine the ivory features of a small child of four. He quickly pulled off his coat, and tenderly wrapping the child in it, ran back to the just vacated boat, while Athanasius, who"], [253, "ANTHEA. 241 had hastily told him of the sad family group he had found, was again retracing his steps to bring another child, until Spiro could give him a helping hand with the woman. Spiro pulled off the wet clothes, and rubbed the small boy, and enveloping him in a sheepskin, tried to force some \" raki \" (Greek wine) betweeen his clenched teeth. If it would only grow light,\" thought Spiro. But the silver-beaming moon was hiding from mortal sight, and had it not been for the phosphorescent sea, which looked a vast sheet of silent fire, the little bay would have been like a huge coal-mine. Spiro gave the child another vigorous rubbing that must have put life into the \" Colossus of Rhodes ; \" moistening the lips again, he left the result to time and fate. He soon found his walk resembled that of a drunkard or of a tottering baby, as every Q"], [254, "ANTHEA. 242 now and then he had to recover his balance so as not to flatten his nose, and make a Chinese salutation to the golden sands and the troublesome stones. At last Spiro reached his mate, and looked up to the leaden sky, hoping to see that the moon would change her mind and turn her face on them. The moon being o feminine is allowed to have wavering inten tions, and one might truly say, \" Varium et mutabile semper Luna.\" So they looked up imploringly, and grate fully saw the silver ball of heaven unclouding herself, and shedding feeble silver rays, as she emerged from her very inky surroundings. Soft glimmers sufficed for the men to see Anthea's white face encircled with entangled o hair, and the long eyelashes shadowing terribly sunken eyes. Not a pulsation could be felt, nor was a tremor visible. On one arm reclined a"], [255, "ANTHEA. 243 bundle, of which swaddling clothes were the prominent feature. There was hardly any thing visible of the baby. On the woman's knee lay the handsomely carved head of a boy, covered with thickly curling brown hair. They were, indeed, not only a statuesque group in appearance, but were also marble-cold. \" Dead,\" said Spiro ; \" still we must do our best. I will carry the boy, if you will in the meanwhile wring the poor woman's skirts, for with all that water she will be too heavy to carry.

The good - natured sailors were horror stricken and bewildered, for the more they looked at the sad group the more they were embarrassed as to what might be necessary to be done. They set sail homewards, and while in turns one was busy with the tackling, the other was engaged in trying to restore the poor unfortunate creatures.

As morn crept on the fading stars shone feebler, and gradually vanished from the sky, while attended by bright rolling clouds, the glorious sun made his welcome appearance. But his early rays could hardly dissipate the cold night air, which had so suddenly broken upon them after the intense heat of many weeks. The little caique was kept within view of the coast, though the wind being contrary a great deal of tacking took place before they reached the village, which, enveloped in a kind of haze, was dimly peeping through the white vapours. It was indeed a poor village at its best, showing, when the mist lifted, only a few cottages and houses sprinkled here and there, on the different tiers of hills. The only striking edifice was the picturesque little"], [258, "ANTHEA. 246 cream-coloured church, with its moss-green stone wall and large bell hanging over the entrance into the yard. Poverty and monotony were the predomi nant features of the place. Early as was the hour, some stragglers perceived the caique approaching, and were drawn by curiosity to see what haul the two men were bringing. Judge of their surprise when Spiro, acting as spokesman, told them what they had found. The exclamations of astonishment were numerous, and even a dog, who had strayed after them, began to bark ancl wag his tail at such an unaccustomed event. The next step was to take the forlorn creatures to some place where they could be properly cared for. Papa Macarius, who for years had been"], [259, "ANTHEA. 247 the universal benefactor for miles round, was still asleep, or they would have taken them to his house. Very little eagerness was shown among the men ; they were afraid of frightening their wives with the sight of the many inani mate bodies. \" What are you hesitating about ? \" said Athanasius. \" I found them, and to my house they shall go. If it had been a sack of gold I should have taken it there, and since Providence has sent me a new family I will do my best.\" \" You are mad, Athanasius, to take that burden on your shoulders. You have already seven children to provide for, besides your mother and wife. Let us share the burden and each take a child.\" But, as the reader knows, Athanasius was obstinate, and would not give in. To separate them he thought would"], [260, "248 ANTHEA. be unkind, feeling confident they would come round from their semi-consciousness, and would then wish to be together. So to his cottage they were taken. The little village was soon astir, and the commotion was almost without parallel, especially when real signs of life began to be apparent. Spiro and Athanasius, and their respective wives, had their hands full, restoring the in animate forms, and their delight knew no * o bounds, when the sufferers, under the com bined influence of the many remedies used, began slowly to show symptoms of returning animation. Athanasius' cottage was small and poor, bearing graphic witness to the struggle he had to live. Food was scarce \u2014 the whole village suffering, in fact, from a chronic dearth of provisions. The people were at this time in daily hope and expectation of"], [261, "ANTHEA. 249 a ship which rich merchants in England had promised to send out for their relief. But, when unsuccessful with his nets, Athanasius with his large family always had gaunt - visaged want in close attend- ance. With characteristic hospitality he now, however, turned out his own children to make room for Anthea and her family. Curious gazers, as was to be expected in such a place, soon gathered round to watch the new comers, whom indeed they would have stifled by their inquisitive crowding, had not Athanasius, made angry by the intrusion, driven them out. \" Why stand gaping here ?

One very solid - looking female, who stood with arms akimbo, and who loved to hear her tongue rattle, was busy draw ing imaginary scenes. She was the person of the village who always knew every thing, and never needed questioning, her store of news flowing unrestrained from the unfailing fountain of her own imagina tion. \" I don't want to go and see the woman,\" she said ; \" I know all her troubles as well as if she had herself told them me.

The general interest in their trouble did not, of course, subside.

Twice now within a month the multitude of gazers had been gratified. In their quiet little village this was of no small importance, and the excitement hourly increased.

It had the effect of making Captain Christophos eagerly desire to see the widow, and offer her his assistance. He was an im portant personage, and with stately step he proceeded towards Athanasius' cottage.
