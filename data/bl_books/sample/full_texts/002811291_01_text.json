Black for the ready courtesy with which they acceded to my request for its republication. My aim has been to give such a sketch of the general course of Roman history as might enable the reader to follow the main lines of movement, and grasp the characteristic features of the dif ferent periods. The lion's share of the space, some three-fifths of the whole, has been devoted to the period which extends from the tribunate of the elder Gracchus to the fall of Nero (133 b.c-69 a.d.), as being the period which it is most necessary for a student of Roman history to understand, and the one which is most fully illustrated by the extant ancient literature. It is also the period which probably, on these grounds, is most generally studied. I have given throughout such references to the original authorities as were necessary to indicate"], [10, "PREFACE IV the evidence on which the statements in the text are based. The references to modern books and dissertations may possibly be found useful, both by students who wish to make a more thorough study of the subject, and by teachers. Of the debt of gratitude which I owe to a long list of scholars, English, French, and German, the footnotes are ample proof. I cannot, however, deny myself the pleasure of paying a special tribute of homage to the great master, in whose footsteps all students of Roman history are glad to tread. Fifty years have passed since Professor Mommsen wrote his monograph ' de collegiis et sodaliciis Romanorum,' and during that time there is no period of Roman history on which he has not set his mark, from the days of the kings to those of Theodoric, and no department of Roman anti quities in the study of which some work of his has not made an epoch. My friend Mr. Warde-Fowler's admirable sketch of C\u00e6sar did not appear until my own chapter on the dictator was in print. I am glad, however, to find that, on the nature and extent of the .work which C\u00e6sar accomplished, we are in close agree ment. Henry Pelham.

Both have essentially the same tale to tell, and we may assume that they give us what was in their time \u2014 that is, towards the close of the first century B.C. \u2014 the generally accepted tradition as to the early history of Rome. This tradition carried the narrative back far beyond the point at which Romulus built his city on the Palatine Mount. In remote times, so ran the story, the Sikels, from whom the island of Sicily after- wards took its name, dwelt on the hills by the Tiber. The Sikels were driven out by the Aborigines, who de scended from their mountain homes in the Apennines, and made themselves masters of all the lowland from the Tiber to the Liris. With this highland folk were A"], [20, "2 HISTORY OF ROME [Book i. united, as time went on, visitors from Greece, Pelasgi from Thessaly, Evander with his followers from Arcadia, and the comrades of the restless hero, Heracles. Later still, in the reign of King Latinus, from whom his people took the name 'Latini,' the fates brought to the shores of Italy and the fields of Lavinium the great \u00c6neas him- self, with his Trojan band. The visitors were made wel- come, and on the death of Latinus, \u00c6neas ruled in his stead over the united Trojans and Latins. From \u00c6neas the sceptre passed to his son Ascanius, the founder of Alba, and of the long dynasty of the .Alban kings. In the reign of the last of these kings, Numitor, the twins Romulus and Remus were born of an earthly mother, the Vestal Rhea Silvia, daughter of king Numitor, and of a divine father, the god Mars. Then followed the familiar tale of the exposure of the children, and of their miraculous deliverance, of their life among the herdsmen, of their recognition as the grandsons of Numitor, and of the foundation of Rome on the Pala- tine. From this point onwards the tradition described how, under Romulus and his successors, the historical city and state of Rome took shape. The gradual expansion of the city bounds, until all the seven hills were included within one great ring-wall, the develop ment of a constitution, and the steady advance of Roman supremacy over the lowlands of Latium were all duly narrated, until, with the expulsion of the second Tarquin, this first chapter of Roman history reached its close. Such, in brief outline, was the accepted tradition of the beginnings of Rome in the time of Augustus. What"], [21, "Ch. i.] THE TRADITIONS 3 is its value as an historical narrative ? In the first place it clearly cannot claim the authority of a contemporary written account, for the earliest references in literature to the history of Rome are found in Greek writers of the fifth century B.C.,1 and no higher antiquity can be assigned even to the few native Roman records, which may have been older than the burning of Rome by- the Gauls.2 Moreover, if the beginnings of this written tradition cannot be carried back further than the fifth century B.C., it is equally certain that it was not until long after the fifth century that it assumed the shape in which we now have it. It was only gradually that out of a number of conflicting versions one finally fought its way to general acceptance, that the undated fragments of tradition were fitted together, the gaps filled up, and the chronology settled. It seems probable, indeed, that something like an authorised version was already established by the time of the Punic wars, and that the main incidents and the order of events were given in much the same way by the oldest Roman chronicler, Q. Fabius Pictor,3 in the 1 According to Dionysius, i. 72, the landing of \u00c6neas in Italy aud the foundation of Rome were mentioned by the compiler of the chronicle of the priestesses of Hera at Argos. The compiler is generally assumed to have been Hellanicus. See Midler, Fragm. Hist Gr., i. 27 ; Schwegler, R. Gesch., i. 3. 2 Dionysius mentious two inscriptions, extant in his day, which were believed to date from the latter part of the regal period, that, namely, which recorded the foundation in the reign of Servius Tullius, of the temple of Diana on the Aventine, and that which preserved the terms of the treaty made with Gabii by the second Tarquin. 3 The version given by Fabius was apparently given in much the same form by the chronicler L. Cincius Alimentus, and by the poets N\u00e6vius and Ennius, all of whom were contemporary with the second"], [22, "4 HISTORY OF ROME [Book i. third century B.C., and by Livy in the first. What changes and additions were made in the interval cannot be accurately determined, though we know that it was by the elder Cato and by Varro that the chronology was finally settled,1 and though we may suspect that it is to the labours of the lawyers and antiquarians of the first century B.C. that we owe much of what Livy and Dionysius tell us of the constitutional and religious institutions of primitive Rome. It must be remembered, then, in reading Livy or Dionysius that we are dealing not with a simple tradi tion handed down whole and intact from the period of which it tells, but with a highly composite production gradually wrought into shape by a long series of writers, Greek and Roman, no part of which existed in a written form at all until the middle of the fifth century B.C., or some three centuries after the supposed date of the foundation of the city. And when to this is added the consideration that these writers were not assisted in the arrangement of their matter by any scientific system of chronology, or any exact canons of historical criticism, it becomes sufficiently clear that the narrative which their combined efforts have pro duced is many degrees removed from authentic history. It is, indeed, a patchwork in which materials of the most diverse kinds have been ingeniously stitched together. In very many parts the handiwork of Greek writers is plainly traceable. From the time when Punic war. Peter, Hist. Rom. Reliqui\u00e6; Schwegler, R. <?., i. 78, 399. 1 Mommsen, Rom. Chronologic, 134, 599."], [23, "Ch. i.] THE TRADITIONS 5 Rome came into direct contact first with the Greeks of South Italy and then with those of Sicily, the history of the rising Italian republic increasingly attracted the attention of Greek scholars,1 who made it their business to provide the new community, which had become a power in the civilised world of the Mediterranean, with a suitable pedigree. In thus endeavouring to find ancestors for the Romans among their own people, they seized eagerly on anything in the nature, traditions, usages, and monuments which could serve to show, as Dionysius puts it, that the Romans were ' an ancient people and a Greek one.' 2 In the Aborigines they recognised their own Pelasgi, and pointed in proof of the theory to the rude stone walls long known in Greece as Pelasgic.3 The name of the Palatine Mount was derived from Pallantium in Arcadia, and the god Faunus became the Greek Evander, who brought to the banks of the Tiber the arts of civilised life. The altar and worship of the Italian Hercules in the low ground near the river were made to prove that Rome had not been unvisited by the Greek Heracles. Odysseus and Circe had already been brought as far on their travels as the bold headland which marks the southern limit of the Latin plain,4 and from thence to the Tiber was a short and easy stage. But among all the roving heroes of Greek tradition none were more famous as founders of cities than those whom the fall of Troy scattered over the face of the 1 For some account of these see Schwegler, R. G., i. 359. The most important of them was the Sicilian Timasus of Tauromenium (350-256 B.C.). 5 Dionysius, ii. 30. 3 Dionysius, i. 14. 4 The headland called ' Circeii."], [24, "6 HISTORY OF ROME [Book i. Mediterranean, and of these the most famous was the Trojan \u00c6neas, the son of Anchises and Aphrodite. At the time when Greeks began to interest themselves in Rome, his name and his reputation were widely spread. The course of his wanderings was traced by the cities he had founded, or by the temples raised in his honour, and in that of his goddess mother, while in more than one place a grave of \u00c6neas was pointed out to the traveller.1 When or by whom Rome was added to the list of the cities which honoured him as their founder we cannot say ; we only know that the tradition existed at least as early as 400 B.C., and that by the time of the first Punic war it had been officially accepted by the Roman state.2 It is noticeable, how ever, that between the earliest form in which it appears and that in which it finally obtained currency there is a considerable difference. In the story as originally told the connection between Rome and \u00c6neas was close and direct, the foundation of the city being ascribed either to \u00c6neas himself or to one of his sons.3 But in the version given by Q. Fabius Pictor, and probably in that of the Sicilian Greek, Tim\u00e6us (circa 300 B.C.), this direct connection has disappeared. \u00c6neas founds Lavinium, his son Ascanius founds Alba, and between the foundation of Alba and that of Rome by Romulus and Remus, an interval of some 400 years 1 Dionysius i. 48-54 for a detailed criticism of the story of \u00c6neas. See Schwegler, R. G., i. 279, 399 ; Klausen, \u00c6neas u. die Penaten. 2 The ancestral connection of Rome with Troy was given by the senate as a reason for assisting the Acarnanians, who alone of all Greeks had taken no part in the Trojan war. Justinus, 28, 1 (241 B.C.). 3 Dionysius, i. 72, 73."], [25, "Ch. I.] THE TRADITIONS 7 is interposed. The cause of the difference is clear. It lay in the twofold necessity of reconciling the Greek story with native tradition, and the accepted date of the fall of Troy, as fixed by Greek chronologers, with the date assigned by Roman reckoning to the foundation of the city. It was impossible to set aside the established belief in the ancient ties which connected Rome both with Lavinium and with Alba, and between the year of the burning of Troy and the year of the building of Rome there was an interval of more than four centuries, a gap which was rudely bridged over in the uncritical fashion of the time by the interpolation of a fictitious dynasty of Alban kings. In the rest of the story, from the foundation of Rome to the expulsion of the Tarquins, the influence of Greek imagination is less strongly marked, since from this point onwards the comparative richness and precision of the native traditions left less scope for Greek in genuity of combination and fertility of invention. Yet even in the account of the rule of the kings the hand of the Greek improver can be occasionally traced. To Greek influence we may ascribe the shape given to the stories of the 'asylum' and of the deification of Romulus, and it must have been Greeks who suggested that King Numa had been a pupil of Pythagoras, or that the Tarquins came originally from Corinth. But though, as the tale proceeds, the amount of native tradition which it contains increases, this native tradition is in itself a curious medley, in which frag ments of genuine tradition are found side by side with the stories by which the people explained to themselves"], [26, "HISTORY OF ROME [Book I. 8 the origin of their ancient monuments, or their ancient institutions and usages, and with the crude, uncritical guesses of early chroniclers and antiquarians. To dis entangle these various elements is a difficult matter, nor can the attempt be made here. But a few instances may be given to illustrate the method of doing it, and the kind of results which can be obtained. When we have set aside all that is clearly of foreign importation or of late date, the inventions and additions of Greek writers, or the chronological apparatus of Cato and Varro, we are face to face with a collection of tales, handed down from mouth to mouth among the people them selves. In such tales experience has taught us that it is not so much the contents of the tale, the names and personality of the actors, or the incidents related, as the motives which suggested it, the peg on which it was hung, that are historically valuable. Thus - the story which connects Rome with Lavinium and with Alba implies an ancient belief among the Romans in their kinship with their Latin neighbours, and that they, with all Latins, recognised a common centre in the sacred mount which dominated the Latin plain. Similarly, behind the tales told of the growth of Rome lies the belief that Rome had not been 'built in a day,' but had been slowly formed by the fusion of separate settlements into a single city and state; and though the names of the kings, the years of their reigns, and the acts that they did give us little that is of value, existence of an underlying belief that, as Tacitus puts it, 'in the beginning kings ruled in Rome,' 1 is a fact of 1 Tac, Ann. i. 1."], [27, "Ch. i.] THE TRADITIONS 9 importance. These ancient beliefs raise a presumption which we have, then, to confirm or reject by the test of positive evidence : the evidence of language, of monuments, or of fossil institutions and usages which are found surviving in later and better-known times. In other instances the motif of the story is of a different kind, and historically less valuable. In some cases the starting-point can be discovered in an ancient usage or ceremony, the origin of which the story ex plains; in others the tale is attached to an ancient monument or a remarkable natural object; in others again it has no better basis than an apparent similarity in names, or a rude etymological guess at their mean ing. Explanatory myths of this kind are of frequent occurrence in the early tradition of Rome. As in stances we may quote the rape of the Sabine women, the building of the temple of Jupiter Stator, the story of Tarpeia, and of the priestly families of the Potitii and Pinarii. In these cases the myth is chiefly valu able in so far as its own antiquity as a tale proves the antiquity of the usage, institution, or monument to which it owes its existence. And here the modern critic has to avoid an error into which his ancient predecessors not unfrequently fell. Dionysius, for in stance, points, in corroboration of the story that \u00c6neas founded Lavinium, or that Romulus and Remus were suckled by a she-wolf, to monuments still extant in his day at Lavinium and in Rome. But these monu ments, like the hut of Romulus on the Palatine, are the offspring and not the parents of the myth, and were erected to commemorate traditions already well"], [28, "10 HISTORY OF ROME [Book I. established. They do not corroborate the story, but indicate that at the date of their erection the story was generally believed. Lastly, the colouring and setting of these tales is often instructive. It is significant, for instance, that it is the Etruscan who figures as the dreaded enemy alike of Rome and of her Latin kinsmen, and that it is the Sabine highlanders, whose forays are repelled, and whose women are carried off. Such, then, in brief, is the nature of the narrative which lies before us in the pages of Livy and Dionysius as the version of the earliest history of Rome current in the Augustan age, and current also, in much the same shape, when Fabius Pictor wrote his chronicles, in the third century B.C. As a written tradition no part of it can be traced further back than the middle of the fifth century, and it has, therefore, no claim to the authority of a contemporary record. In it materials of very various sorts and kinds, and brought from very different quarters, are found side by side. Intermingled with fragments of genuinely old and native tradition we find pieces of world-wide folk-lore, such as the tale of the children cruelly exposed and miraculously saved, stories, some drawn from the inexhaustible stores of Greek legend, or invented by the scarcely less inexhaustible imagination of Greek chroniclers, others representing the naive attempts of the soberer Roman mind to find an origin for the most ancient of their usages, institu tions, and monuments. All these various materials were gradually combined and arranged by the efforts of successive generations ; but the orderly and consecutive narrative, with its apparatus of names and dates, which"], [29, "Ch. I.] THE TRADITIONS 11 was thus produced, had even less claim to be considered history than the mass of disconnected tales of which it was composed. It follows, then, that neither the narrative as a whole nor the separate incidents can be regarded as historical. On the other hand, both the ancient and genuinely Roman beliefs which underlie the story, and the colouring and setting of the tale, frequently afford a clue to the truth, which a study of the independent evidence supplied by the undoubted relics of antiquity to be found in the language, the institutions, the monu ments of later Rome enables us to follow out with success."], [30, "12 CHAPTER II. THE ORIGIN OF THE CITY AND COMMONWEALTH. There is fortunately no room for doubt as to the site of Rome, or as to the district which was the scene of her early history. Along the western coast of Italy from Civita Vecchia (Centum Cell\u00e6) in the north to Tarracina in the south stretches the famous lowland known for centuries as the Campagna. It is bounded to the north by the more hilly country of Northern Etruria, on the east by the mountain range of the Apennines, on the south by the Yolscian highlands. This strij) of lowland, nearly one hundred miles long, and nowhere much more than thirty miles wide, is in not an un broken level. Its undulating surface is furrowed by watercourses, rent by volcanic fissures, and dotted over with abruptly rising hillocks. Viewed from the top of Soracte at its north-eastern extremity, or from the more famous Alban Mount, which rises out of the plain to the southward, its appearance has been compared to that of a stormy sea suddenly petrified. Of the streams which flow through it, two only, the Tiber, and its tributary the ' headlong Aius,' have ever been important enough to deserve the name of rivers. It is with the river Tiber, the waterway which con nects the Umbrian and Sabine highlands with the sea, and with this lowland country that the beginnings of Rome"], [31, "Ch. 2.] ORIGIN OF CITY AND COMMONWEALTH 1.3 are inseparably associated. It was on the low hills which rise from the left bank of the Tiber, some fifteen miles above its mouth, that Rome was built, and it was possibly from the river that it took its name.1 It was among the communities of the lowland that Rome found her natural allies against the Etruscan to the north, or against the highland tribes to the east and south. The establishment of her ascendency over the lowland marks the first stage in the growth of her empire, and centuries later, when barbarians ruled to the north and east and south, this lowland remained Roman, and was ruled from Rome by Roman bishops. It has been already said that the traditional account of the beginnings of Rome implies a fixed belief that both the city of Rome and the Roman commonwealth were gradually formed by the union of separate com munities. Romulus built his city the ' square Rome ' \" on the Palatine Mount. With the Palatine were united before the end of his reign the Capitoline and the Quirinal. Tullus Hostilius added the C\u0153lian, Ancus Martius the Aventine, while Servius Tullius included the Esquiline and Viminal, and enclosed the whole area with a ring wall. The growth of the people followed the same lines. To the followers of Romulus on the Pala tine were added successively the Sabine settlers on the Quirinal, Albans transplanted by Tullus, Latins by Ancus, and lastly the Etruscan comrades of Cceles Vibenna. The first point in this tradition, the fusion of a cluster of separate settlements into a single city, has 1 Serv. on \u00c6n., viii. 63, states that the Tiber was anciently called ' Rumon ' ; for the connection between ' Runion ' and ' Roma,' see Corssen, Vokalismus u.

In the time of Tacitus the boundaries of the ' ancient Palatine town,' as Yarro calls it,1 could still be traced,2 and the memory of them was preserved by the annual race of the Luperci on February 15. Of the wall which once fenced round this ' City of Romulus ' enough remains even now to show its direction and the method of its construction. It enclosed the whole crest of the Palatine, and belongs to an earlier period than that at which the Servian wall was built. On the Esquiline, Varro mentions an ' ancient city ' and an earthen ram part3 on the Capitol, on the Quirinal, and on the C\u0153lian remains have been discovered, indicating that each of these hills was also at one time the seat of a separate settlement, surrounded by its own rude wall.4 Nor are we entirely without evidence of the gradual fusion of these distinct settlements into a single city. The festival of the Septimontium commemorated the union of the Palatine with the Esquiline Mount.5 The union of these ' Mounts ' with the Quirinal ' Hill ' left its marks on the institutions and ceremonies of the State, as for example in the double worship of Mars,6 1 Varro, L.

But though we may safely believe that it was in this fashion that the city of Rome was formed, we cannot be equally confident as to dates ; all that can be said is that the oldest tombs yet discovered on the Esquiline appear to belong to the early part of the eighth century B.C., when Greek traders were begin ning to move westward, and that the Servian wall may be assigned approximately to the close of the seventh century.2 But is tradition right in representing this fusion of Rome a distinct settlements as a fusion also of communities of different race 1 Much of what it says on this point may be at once dismissed as fabulous. The tales of \u00c6neas and his Trojans, of Evander and his Arcadians, of the followers of Heracles, and of the still earlier Aborigines have no claim to a place in history ; 3 we cannot accept the story to which the Romans clung with proud humility of the asylum opened by Romulus, or believe that the ancestors of the Romans were a mixed concourse of outlaws and refugees,4 nor, while admitting the probability of the tradition that in remote times the ' Sikels ' had dwelt on the seven hills, can we allow them any part or lot in the historic Roman people.5 1 Varro, L.

These ' Latini,' as they were called, possibly from the plain land in which they dwelt, had probably, as their tradi tions affirmed, descended at some early period from the highlands of the Apennines, where their kinsmen, the Umbrians and Sabines, still dwelt. Driving out the earlier population, they planted their rudely fortified settlements wherever a piece of rising ground afforded protection against human foes, and against the malaria. The communities thus founded formed the peoples (populi) of the Latin name. The ties of kinship, and jDrobably also the common necessity of self-defence against Etruscan, Sabine, or Volscian foes, bound them together. They had their federal council, their federal leaders, and a common federal sanctuary on the sacred Alban Mount. The affinity between Rome and these Latin peoples is implied in the Roman traditions them selves. King Faunus, who rules the Aborigines on the Palatine, is Latin ; ' Latini ' is the name assumed by the united Aborigines and Trojans ; the immediate pro genitors of Rome are the Latin Lavinium and the Latin Alba. The evidence of the language, the religion, the institutions and civilisation of early Rome points to the same conclusion. The speech of the Romans is from the first Latin;1 the oldest gods of Rome \u2014 Saturn, Janus, Jupiter, Juno, Diana, etc. \u2014 are all Latin; 'rex,' 'pr\u00e6tor,' 'dictator,' 'curia,' are Latin titles and 1 The theory that Latin was a ' mongrel speech ' is now discarded.

Ch. 2.] ORIGIN OF CITY AND COMMONWEALTH 17 institutions.1 Geographically, too, the low hills by the Tiber form a part of the strip of coast-land from which the Latini took their name, and the primitive settle ments, with their earthen ramparts and wooden pali sades planted upon them, are only typical of the mode of settlement which the conditions of life dictated throughout Latium.2 But tradition insists on the admixture of at least two non-Latin elements, a Sabine and an Etruscan. The question as regards the latter will be more fully discussed hereafter ; it is enough to say here that there is no satisfactory evidence that any one of the communities which combined to form Rome was Etruscan, or that there was any important Etruscan strain in the Roman blood.3 With the Sabines it is other wise. That union of the Palatine and Quirinal settlements, which constituted so decisive a stage in the growth of Rome, is represented as having been in reality a union of the original Latins with a band of Sabine invaders, who had seized and held not only the Quirinal Hill, but the northern and nearest peak of the Capitoline Mount. The tradition was evidently deeply rooted. The name of the Quirinal Hill itself was said to be derived from 1 The title 'rex' occurs on inscriptions at Lanuvium, Tusculum, Bovill\u00e6; Henzen, Bullettino dell.

B"], [36, "18 HISTORY OF ROME [Book I. the Sabine town of Cures.1 The ancient worships con nected with it were said to be Sabine.2 One of the three old tribes, the Tities, was believed to represent the Sabine element ; s the second and the fourth kings were both of Sabine descent. We may follow the great majority of modern writers in accepting the substanee of the tradition, the fusion of a body of Sabine invaders with the original Latins, as historical, but 'with certain qualifications.4 A Sabine invasion, if it took place at all, must, at any rate, have taken place far back in the pre historic age ; it must have been on a small scale ; and the Sabine invaders must have amalgamated easily and completely with the Latin settlers ; for the structure of the early Roman State, while it bears evident marks of a fusion of communities, shows no traces of a mix ture of race ; nor is it easy to point to any provably Sabine element in the language, religion, or civilisation of primitive Rome.6 That there was ever a Sabine conquest of Rome is a theory which can hardly be 1 Varro, L. L., v. 51. 2 Varro, L. L., v. 74 ; Schwegler, i. 248 sq. ; but Mommsen (R. (?., i. 53) points out that most of these so-called Sabine deities are at least equally Latin. 3 Varro, L. L.. v. 55 ; Livy, i. 13. 4 Mommsen, R. G., i. 43. Schwegler (R. G., i. 478) accepts the tradition of a Sabine settlement on the Quirinal, and considers that in the united state the Sabine element predominated. Volquardsen (Rhein. Mus., xxxiii. 559) believes in a complete Sabine conquest ; and so does Ziiller (Lutium u. Rom, Leipsic, 1878), who, however, places it alter the expulsion of the Tarquins. Gilbert (Topogr., i. cap. 5) accepts the Sabine settlement, but holds rightly that in the union the Latin element decisively predominated. ' See Mommsen, i. 43. The Sabine words in Latin, if not common to both dialects, were probably introduced later, or are Sabinised Latin (Mommsen, Unterital. Dialekten, 347). Schwegler's attempt to distinguish S.ibine features in the Roman character is ingenious but unsatisfactory."], [37, "Ch. 2.] ORIGIN OF CITY AND COMMONWEALTH 19 maintained in the face of the predominantly Latin character of both people and institutions. On the other hand, the probability of a Sabine raid and a Sabine settlement, on the Quirinal Hill, in very early times may be admitted. The incursions of the highland Apennine tribes into the lowlands fill a large place in early Italian history. The Latins were said to have originally de scended from the mountain glens near Reate.1 The in vasions of Campania and of Magna Gr\u00e6cia by Sabellian tribes are matter of history, and the Sabines themselves are represented as a restless highland people, ever seek ing new homes in richer lands.2 In very early days they appear on the borders of Latium, in close proximity to Rome, and Sabine forays are familiar and frequent occurrences in the old legends. Leaving behind us the dark period of the making of The early Rome, we pass on to consider what can be known of wealth. its constitution and history in the earliest days of its existence as a single united community. The ' populus Romanus ' was, we are told, divided The people. into three tribes, Ramnes, Tities, and Luceres,3 and into thirty 'curi\u00e6.' The three tribes probably repre sented a primitive clan division, older than the Roman state itself. They survived in later times only as 1 Cato ap. Dionysium, ii. 48, 49. 2 Ibid. For the institution of the ' ver sacrum ' see Schwegler, R. G., i. 240 ; Nissen, Templum, iv. 3 The tradition connecting the Ramnes with Romulus and the Tities with Tatius is as old as Ennius (Varro, L. L., v. 55). Mommsen (i. 41)explains Ramnes as =Romani, but this etymology is rejected by Schwegler and by Corssen. As regards the Luceres there is little to add to Livy's statement (i. 13), 'nominis et originis causa incertaest.' See, on the whole question, Schwegler, i. 505, and Volquardsen, Rhein, Mus., xxxiii. 538."], [38, "20 HISTORY OF ROME [Book I. divisions of the corps of ' knights ' (' equitum centuri\u00e6 '), the representatives of the ancient cavalry of Rome, and even in the accounts of the earliest constitution they have ceased to serve as a political division of the people.1 Of far greater importance was the division into 'curi\u00e6.' In Cicero's time there were still curies, curial festivals, and curiate assemblies, and modern authors are un questionably right in regarding the curia as the key stone of the political system. It was a primitive association held together by participation in com mon ' sacra,' and possessing common festivals, common priests, and a common chapel, hall, and hearth. The members of a curia were very probably neighbours and kinsmen, but the curia seems to represent a stage in political development midway between that in which clanship is the sole bond of union, and that in which such claims as those of territorial contiguity and owner ship of land have obtained recognition. As separate associations the curi\u00e6 are probably older than the Roman state, but,2 however this may be, it is certain that of this state, when formed, they constituted the only effective political subdivisions. The members of the thirty curi\u00e6 were the populus Romanus, and the earliest known condition of Roman citizenship was the 'communio sacrorum,' partnership in the curial 'sacra.' Below the curia there was no further political division, 1 They are traditionally connected only with the senate of 300 patres, with the primitive legion of 3000, with the vestal virgins, and with the augurs (Varro, L. L., v. 81, 89, 91 ; Livy, x. 6 ; Festus, 344; Mommsen, i. 41, 74, 75 ; Genz, Patricische Rom, 90). It is possible that the curi\u00e6 were originally connected with separate localities ; cf. such names as Foriensis, Yeliensis (Fest 174 \u2022 Gilbert, i. 213)."], [39, "Ch. 2.] ORIGIN OF CITY AND COMMONWEALTH 21 for we cannot believe that the curia was ever formally subdivided into a fixed number of gentes and families.1 Nor can we assent to the view which would represent the curi\u00e6 as containing only the 'patrician gentes.' The primitive Roman people of the thirty curi\u00e6 included all the freemen of the community, simple as well as gentle.2 At their head was the 'rex,' the ruler of the united The king. people. The Roman ' king ' was not simply either the hereditary and patriarchal chief of a clan, the priestly head of a community bound together by common sacra, or the elected magistrate of a state, but a mixture of all three.3 In later times, when no 'patrician magistrates' were forthcoming to hold the elections for their succes sors, a procedure was adopted which was believed to represent the manner in which the early kings had been appointed.4 In this procedure the ancient privi leges of the old ' gentes ' and their elders, the import ance of maintaining unbroken the continuity of the 'sacra,' on the transmission and observance of which the welfare of the community depended, and, thirdly, the rights of the freemen were all recognised. On the death of a king the auspicia, and with them the supreme authority, reverted to the council of elders, the 'patres,' 1 Niebuhr's supposition of ten gentes in each curia has nothing in its favour but the confused statement of Dionysius as to the purely military W/ca5es (Dionysius, ii. 7 ; cf. Miiller, Philologns, xxxiv. 96). 2 The view taken here on the vexed question of the purely patrician character of the curi\u00e6 is that of Mommsen (Rom. Forschnngen, vol. i.). 3 Rubino, Genz, and Lange insist on the hereditary patriarchal character of the kingship, Ihne on its priestly side, Schwegler on its elective. Mommsen comes nearest to the view taken in the text, but fails to bring out the nature of the compromise on which the kingship rested. 4 Cic. de Legg., iii. 3 ; Livy, iv. 7."], [40, "22 HISTORY OF ROME [Book I. as representing the 'gentes.' By the 'patres' an 'interrex' was appointed, who in turn nominated a second ; by him, or even by a third or fourth interrex, a new king was selected in consultation with the 'patres.' The king-designate was then proposed to the freemen assembled by their curi\u00e6 for their acceptance, and finally their formal acceptance was ratified by the 'patres,' as a security that the 'sacra' of which they were the guardians have been respected.1 Thus the king was in the first instance selected by the representa tives of the old gentes, and they ratified his apj:>oint ment. In form he was nominated directly by a pre decessor from whose hands he received the auspicia. But it was necessary also that the choice of the patres and the nomination of the interrex should be confirmed by a solemn vote of the community. It is useless to attempt a precise definition of the prerogatives of the king when once installed in office. Tradition ascribes to him a position and powers closely resembling those of the heroic kings of Greece. He rules for life, and he is the sole ruler, unfettered by written statutes. He is the supreme judge, settling 1 ' Patres auctores facti,' Livy, i. 22 ; ' patres fuere auctores,' Ibid., i. 32. In 336 B.C. (Livy, viii. 12) the Publilian law directed that this sanction should be given beforehand, 'ante inituni suffragium,' and thus reduced it to a meaningless form (Livy, i. 11). It is wrongly identified by Schwegler with the 'lex curiata de imperio,' which in Cicero's day followed and did not precede election. According to Cicero (De Rep., ii. 13, 21), the proceedings included, in addition to the ' creation ' by the comitia curiata and the sanction of the patres, the introduction by the king himself of a lex curiata conferring the imperium and auspicia ; but this theory, though generally accepted, is probably an inference from the practice of a later time, when the ' creatio ' had beeii transferred to the ' comitia centuriata.'"], [41, "Ch. 2.] ORIGIN OF CITY AND COMMONWEALTH 23 all disputes, and punishing wrongdoers even with death. All other officials are appointed by him. He imposes taxes, distributes lands, and erects buildings. Senate and assembly meet only when he convenes them, and meet for little else than to receive communications from him. In war he is absolute leader,1 and, finally, he is also the religious head of the community. It is his business to consult the gods on its behalf, to offer the solemn sacri fices, and to announce the days of the public festivals. Hard by his house was the common hearth of the state, where the Vestal Virgins cherished the sacred fire. By the side of the king stood the senate, or council The senate. of elders. In the descriptions left us of the primitive senate, as in those of the ' rex,' we can discover traces of a transition from an earlier state of things when Rome was only an assemblage of clans or village com munities, allied indeed, but each still ruled by its own chiefs and headmen, to one in which these groups have been fused into a single state under a common ruler. On the one hand the senate appears as a council of chiefs, with inalienable prerogatives of its own, and claiming to be the ultimate depository of the supreme authority and of the ' sacra ' connected with it. The senators are the ' patres ' ; they are taken from the leading ' gentes ' ; they hold their seats for life ; to them the ' auspicia ' revert on the death of a king ; they appoint the interrex from their own body, are consulted in the choice of the new king,2 and their 1 For the references, see Schwegler, i. 646 sq. 2 If the analogy of the ' rex sacrorum ' is to be trusted, the ' king ' could only be chosen from the ranks of the ' patricii.' \u2014 Cic. pro Domo, 14 ; Gaius, i. 122."], [42, "The assembly. 24 HISTORY OF ROME [Book i. sanction is necessary to ratify the vote of the assembled freemen. On the other hand, they are no longer supreme. They cannot appoint a king but with the consent of the community, and their relation to the king when appointed is one of subordination. Vacancies in their ranks are filled up by him, and they can but give him advice and counsel when he chooses to consult them. The popular assembly of united Rome in its earliest days was that in which the freemen met and voted by their curi\u00e6 (comitia curiata1). The assembly met in the comitium at the north-east end of the forum,2 at the summons and under the presidency of the king, or, failing him, of the ' interrex.' By the 'rex' or ' interrex ' the question was put, and the voting took place ' curia tim.' The vote of each curia was decided by the majority of individual votes, and a majority of the votes of the curi\u00e6 determined the final result. But the occasions on which the assembly could exercise its power must have been few. Their right to elect magis trates was apparently limited to the acceptance or rejection of the king proposed by the interrex. Of the passing of laws, in the latter sense of the term, there is no trace in the kingly period. Dionysius's statement 3 that they voted on questions of war and peace is im probable in itself and unsupported by tradition. They are indeed represented, in one instance, as deciding a capital case, but it is by the express permission of the king and not of right.4 Assemblies of the people were also, and probably more frequently, convened for other 1 Cic. dc Rej)., ii. 13 ; Dionysius, ii. 14, etc. 2 Varro, L.

Not only did they meet to hear from the king the announcement of the high days and holidays for each month, and to witness such solemn religious rites as the inauguration of a priest, but their presence (and sometimes their vote) was further required to authorise and attest certain acts, which in a later age assumed a more private character. The disposal of property by will,1 and the solemn renunciation of family or gentile ' sacra,' 2 could only take place in the presence of the assembled freemen, while for adoption 3 (adrogatio) not only their presence but their formal consent was necessary. Such in outline was the political structure of the Roman state at the earliest period known to us. It is clear that it belongs to a comparatively advanced stage in the development of society, and that a long previous history lies behind it. Traces of an older and more primitive order of things still linger in the three ancient shadowy tribes, in the curi\u00e6 and gentes, in many of the features noticeable in the senate ; but they are traces of an order that has passed away. The supremacy of the state is established over the groups out of whose fusion it has grown, and such of these groups as still retain a distinct existence are merely private corpora tions. Private differences are settled and wrongdoers punished by the state tribunals, and even within the close limits of the family the authority of the head is limited by the claims of the state upon the services of the sons and dependants. i Gaius, ii. 101. 2 Gell., xv. 27. 3 Gell., v. 19, 'Comitia pr\u00e6beutur, qu\u00e6 curiata appellantur.'

The names, dates, and achievements of the first four kings are all too unsubstantial to form the basis of a sober narrative ; 1 a few points only can be considered as fairly well established. If we except the long eventless reign ascribed to King Numa, tradition represents the first kings as incessantly at war with their immediate neighbours. The details of these wars are no doubt mythical ; but the implied condition of continual struggle, and the narrow range within which the struggle is confined, may be accepted as true. The picture drawn is that of a small community with a few square miles of territory, living in constant feud with its nearest neighbours, within a radius of some twelve miles round Rome. Nor, in spite of the repeated victories with which tradition credits Romulus, Ancus, and Tullus, does there seem to have been any real extension of Roman territory except towards the sea. 1 By far the most complete criticism of the traditional accounts of the first four kings will be found in Schwegler's Rom. Geschichte, vol. i. ; compare also Ihne's Early Rome, and Sir G. C. Lewis's Credibility of Early Roman History."], [45, "Ch. 3.] ROME UNDER THE KINGS 27 Fiden\u00e6 remains Etruscan ; the Sabines continue masters up to the Anio ; Pr\u00e6neste, Gabii, and Tusculum are still untouched ; and on this side it is doubtful if Roman territory extended to a greater distance than the sixth milestone from Rome.1 But along the course of the Tiber below the city there was a decided advance. The fortification of the Janiculum, the building of the 'pons sublicius,' the foundation of Ostia, and the acquisition of the salt marshes near the sea may all be safely ascribed to this early period. Closely con nected, too, with the control of the Tiber from Rome to the sea was the subjugation of the petty Latin communities lying south of the river ; and the tradi tion of the conquest and destruction of Politorium, Tellen\u00e6, and Ficana is confirmed by the absence in historical times of any Latin communities in this district. With the reign of the fifth king Tarquinius Priscus The Tar quins. a marked change takes place. The traditional accounts of the last three kings not only wear a more historical air than those of the first four, but they describe some thing like a transformation of the Roman city and state. Under the rule of these latter kings the separate settlements were for the first time enclosed with a ram part of colossal size and extent.2 The low grounds were drained, and a forum and circus elaborately laid out ; on 1 The ' fossa Cluilia,' five miles from Rome (Livy, ii. 39), is regarded \u2022by Schwegler (i. 585) and by Mommsen (i. 45) as marking the Roman frontier towards Latium.

Entering Italy, as they probably did, from the north or north east, they seem to have first of all made themselves masters of the rich valley of the Po and of the Umbrians who dwelt there. Then crossing the Apennines, they overran Etruria proper as far south as the banks of the Tiber, here too reducing to subjection the Umbrian owners of the soil. In Etruria they made themselves dreaded, like the Northmen of a later time, by sea as well as by land. Their pirate galleys swept the Tyr rhenian sea, while roving bands of Etruscan warriors established themselves at one place after another in the districts south of the Tiber, built their strongholds, and ruled as conquerors over the subject peoples. In the latter half of the seventh century B.C., at the period to which the erection of the Servian wall may be assigned, their power was at its height. It extended far beyond Etruria proper. The Kelts had not yet seriously threatened their supremacy in the valley of the Po, \u2014 and they were still masters of the rich Cam panian plain, \u2014 from which the Samnite Highlanders were to oust them some two centuries later. It is, on the face of it, improbable that a power which had extended its sway from the Alps to the Tiber, and from the Liris to Surrentum, should have left untouched the intervening stretch of country between the Tiber and the Liris.

Dionysius, i. 64) of Ardea, whose close ally was the ruthless Mezentius, lord of C\u00e6re, to whom the Latins had been forced to pay a tribute of wine.2 Cato declared the Yolsci to have been once subject to Etruscan rule,3 and Etruscan remains found at Velitr\u00e6,4 as well as the second name of the Yolscian Auxur, Tarracina (the city of Tarchon), tend to confirm his statement. Nearer still to Rome was Tusculum, with its significant name, and at Alba we hear of a prince Tapx^rios,5 lawless and cruel like Mezentius, who consults the ' oracle of Tethys in Tyrrhenia.' Thus we find the Etruscan power encircling Rome on all sides, and in Rome itself a tradition of the rule of princes of Etruscan origin. The Tarquinii come from South Etruria ; their name can hardly be anything else than the Latin equivalent of the Etruscan Tarchon, and is therefore possibly a title (= ' lord ' or ' prince ') rather than a proper name.'0 Even Servius Tullius was identi fied by Tuscan chroniclers with an Etruscan ' Mastarna.'7 1 Dionysius, i. 29. 2 Livy, i. 2 ; Dionysius, i. 64, 65 ; Plut., 0.

Lugd., App. to Nipperdey's edition"], [49, "Ch. 3.] ROME UNDER THE KINGS 31 There are two other features in the story of the last three kings of Rome which point the same way. The Etruscans are not represented in tradition as moving in great masses, and their advance is not the migration of a whole people. We hear rather, as in the case of the Northmen, of roving bands of warriors led by powerful chiefs who carve out principalities for themselves with their own good swords, and rule as conquerors over alien and subject populations,1 and it is a raid and a conquest of this kind, not an immigration, that the tradition suggests. Here, as elsewhere, the Etruscans were not the people but the rulers. Nor is this all. That Etruria had, under the sway of Etruscan lords, forged ahead of the country south of the Tiber in wealth and civilisation is a fact which the evidence of remains has placed beyond doubt. It is therefore signifi cant that the rule of the Tarquins in Rome is marked by an outward splendour which stands in strong con trast to the primitive simplicity of the native kings. The great cloaca, the Servian wall, the Capitoline temple, were monuments which challenged comparison with those of the emperors themselves, and they can hardly have been built by any but builders from Etruria, under the magnificent patronage of Etruscan lords. Nor do the traces of Greek influence upon Rome during this period2 conflict with the theory of an Etruscan supremacy ; on the contrary, it is at least of the Annals of Tacitus, 'Tusce Mastarna ei nomen erat.'

They are represented as favouring new men at the expense of the old patrician families, and as re-organising the Roman army on a new footing, a policy natural enough in military princes of alien birth, and rendered possible by the additions which conquest had made to the original community. From among the leading families of the conquered Latin states a hundred new members were admitted to the senate, and the gentes to which they belonged thenceforth ranked as patrician, and became known as 'gentes minores.'2 The changes in the army begun, it is said, by the elder Tarquin and completed by Servius Tullius were more important. The basis of the primitive military system had been the three tribes, each of which furnished 1000 men to the legion and 100 to the cavalry.3 Tarquinius Priscus, we are i Schwegler, i. 791, 792.

His famous distri bution of all landholders (assidui) into tribes, classes, and centuries,3 though subsequently adopted with modi fications as the basis of the political system, was at first exclusively military in its nature and objects.4 It amounted, in fact, to the formation of an enlarged army on a new footing. In this force, excepting in the case of the centuries of the horsemen, no regard was paid either to the old clan divisions or to the semi-religious semi-political curi\u00e6. In its ranks were included all landholders within the Roman terri tory, whether members or not of any of the old divisions, and the organisation of this new army of ' assidui ' was not less independent of the old system with its clannish and religious traditions and forms. The unit was the ' centuria,' or company of 100 men ; the centuri\u00e6 were grouped in ' classes,' and drawn up in the order of the 1 Livy, i. 36 ; Dionysius, iii. 71. 2 The six centuries of horsemen were thenceforward known as 'primi secundique Ramnes' (Fest., 344; cf.

These centuries formed the first class. Behind them stood the centuries of the second and third classes, less com pletely armed, but making up together with those of the first class the heavy-armed infantry.2 In the rear were the centuries of the fourth and fifth classes, recruited from the poorer landholders, and serving only as light-armed troops. The entire available body of landholders was divided into two equal portions, a reserve corps of ' seniores ' and a corps of ' juniores ' for active service. Each of these corps consisted of 85 centuries, or 8500 men, i.e. of two legions of about 4200 men each, the normal strength of a consular legion under the early republic.3 It is noticeable also that the heavy-armed centuries of the three first classes in each of these legions represented a total of 3000 men, a number which agrees exactly with the number of heavy-armed troops in the legion as described by Polybius. Attached to the legions, but not included in them, were the companies of sappers and trumpeters.

He is described as a splendid and monare y' despotic monarch. His sway extended over Latium as far south as Circeii. Aristodemus, tyrant of Cum\u00e6, was his ally, and kinsmen of his own were princes at Collatia, at Gabii, and at Tusculum. The Volscian highlanders were chastised, and Signia, with its massive walls, was built to hold them in check. In Rome itself the Capitoline temple and the great cloaca bore witness to his power. But his rule pressed heavily upon the Romans, and at the last, on the news of the foul wrong done by his son Sextus to a noble Roman matron, Lucretia, the indignant people rose in revolt. Tarquin, 1 Livy, i. 43. Dionysius (iv. 18) and Cicero (De Repi., ii, 22) ascribe the whole eighteen to Servius.

Freed from the tyrant, they chose for themselves two yearly magistrates who should exercise the supreme authority, and thus the republic of Rome was founded. Three times the banished Tarquin strove desperately to recover the throne he had lost. First of all the men of Veii and Tarquinii marched to his aid, but were defeated in a pitched battle on the Roman frontier. A year later Lars Porsena, prince of Clusium, at the head of all the powers of Etruria, appeared before the gates of Rome, and closely besieged the city, until, moved by the valour of his foe, he granted honourable terms of peace and withdrew.1 Once again, by Lake Regillus, the Romans fought victoriously for their liberty against Tarquin's son-in law Mamilius, prince of Tusculum, and chief of the Latin name. Mamilius was slain; Tarquin in despair found a refuge at Cum\u00e6, and there soon afterwards died. So, in brief, ran the story of the flight of the kings, as it was told by the chroniclers whom Livy followed.

BOOK If. THE EARLY REPUBLIC\u2014 509-275 B.C. CHAPTER I. THE FOUNDATION OF THE REPUBLIC AND THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE ORDERS. Much of what has been said as to the nature and value of the traditional account of the beginnings of Rome and of the monarchy applies to that we possess of the early republic. It is true that there is, at first sight, a considerable difference. In passing from the first to the second book of Livy we are conscious of passing from poetry to prose. The narrative assumes at once the shape of a chronicle, in which events are set down in order, year by year, as they occurred, and in which the actors are men, and not gods or demi-gods. But this appearance of historical sobriety and consecutive ness is, at least for the period before the sack of Rome by the Gauls (390 B.C.), somewhat delusive. For, in the first place, the dearth of contemporary documents relating to this period must have been almost as com plete as in the case of the preceding one. We may, indeed, grant that when Fabius Pictor, or Tim\u00e6us 89"], [58, "40 HISTORY OF ROME [Bk. H. before him, -wrote, there existed in Rome written records, such as the annals of the pontiffs, or the consular 'fasti,' purporting to carry back the chronicle of events and the list of magistrates to the first year of the republic. But these records, at any rate in their earlier portions, were in no sense contemporary authori ties. They were compiled, probably in the fourth century B.C., out of a mass of confused tradition, which the compilers have only imperfectly succeeded in reduc ing to order. Moreover, what we know of the nature of these official records makes it certain that a great part of what Livy or Dionysius tells us about the early republic cannot have been directly or indirectly derived from them. It is evident that not only were they often altogether silent where Livy and Dionysius have much to say, but their notices of events were of the most concise and meagre kind. If they furnished the bare outlines of the story, the wealth of episode, with which these outlines have been filled in, must have come from elsewhere, and mainly, no doubt, from popular tradition. The early struggle for existence which the infant republic waged with her neighbours had left behind it an ample legacy of border legends, tales of feuds and forays, of valiant chiefs and heroic deeds, which were told and retold among the people, and cherished with especial care by the great patrician houses. Nor was the great domestic conflict between patricians and plebeians without its own stories of patricians who loved the people or oppressed them, of resolute tribunes, of secessions and reconciliations. To piece together these stray stories, and to fit them into"], [59, "Ch. i.] THE FOUNDATION OF THE REPUBLIC 41 the rude framework supplied by the official records, was a work of time, and by each writer who took part in the work something was added with the view of removing inconsistencies, supplying omissions, or simply of giving life and colour to the narrative. And this tendency to retouch and even to recast the old material became gradually stronger. The chroniclers of the first century B.C. possessed an amount of literary skill, which at once encouraged and made possible a freer handling of the traditions. L. Calpurnius Piso, tribune in 149 B.C. and consul in 133 B.C., prided himself on reducing the old legends to the level of common-sense, and importing into them valuable moral lessons for his own generation. By C\u00e6lius Antipater the methods of rhetoric were first applied to history, a disastrous pre cedent enough. He inserted speeches, enlivened his pages with chance tales, and aimed, as Cicero tells us, at not merely narrating facts, but also at beautifying them. His successors carried still further the practice of dressing up the rather bald chronicles of earlier writers with all the ornaments of rhetoric. The old traditions were altered almost beyond the possibility of recognition by exaggerations, interpolations, and additions. Fresh incidents were inserted, new motives suggested, and speeches composed in order to infuse the required life and freshness into these dry bones of history. At the same time the political bias of the writers and the political ideas of their day were allowed, in some cases perhaps half unconsciously, to affect their representations of past events. Annalists of the Gracchan age imported into the early struggles of"], [60, "42 HISTORY OF ROME [Bk. II. patricians and plebeians the economic controversies of their own day, and painted the first tribunes in the colours of the two Gracchi or of Saturninus. In the next generation they dexterously forced the venerable records of the early republic to pronounce in favour of the ascendency of the senate, as established by Sulla. To political bias was added family pride, for the grati fication of which the archives of the great houses, the funeral panegyrics, or the imagination of the writer himself supplied an ample store of doubtful material. Pedigrees were invented, imaginary consulships and fictitious triumphs inserted, family traditions and family honours were formally incorporated with the history of the state. But, in spite of all this, a history of the first two centuries of the republic is possible in a sense in which a history of the regal period, and still more of the mythical period which preceded it, is im possible. To the Roman even of the time of the Punic wars the pre-republican period was a sort of ante diluvian age, separated from all that followed by a gap which no tradition completely bridged over, and of which only fossil relics, ancient monuments, or ancient institutions remained to excite the wonder and curiosity of later generations. But the early republic was con nected with the republic of Cicero by a close and un broken chain of continuity. Proofs of the reality of its conflicts with Yolscians and \u00c6quians, Etruscans and Gauls abroad, or between patrician and plebeian at home, were everywhere forthcoming, and the descendants of the chief actors, Valerii, Claudii, and Fabii, still sat in the senate-house or led the legions. Above all, in"], [61, "Ch. i.] THE FOUNDATION OF THE REPUBLIC 43 the constitution itself, in the ancient magistracies, in the senate or assembly, and in the venerable statutes which guarded the liberties of the citizen, or protected the privileges of the plebs, evidence survived by which tradition could be tested, and a reconstruction of the old political fabric made possible. We do not know \u2014 it is not likely that we shall ever know \u2014 how the resolu tion which ended the rule of kings in Rome was effected, nor in what way or by whom the republican govern ment was established. But the substitution of two annually elected chief magistrates for the single king is a fact which is proved by all that followed. The incidents of the struggle between the orders, the personality of the actors, in many cases even the order of the events, are doubtful and uncertain ; but if we had nothing to go upon but the position and powers of the tribunes of the plebs in the days of the Gracchi or of Cicero, we should still have indubitable evidence that such a struggle must have taken place. The same is the case with the long border wars between Rome and her neighbours. The details are historically worthless, but the reality of the wars, the gradual advance of Rome, and her final supremacy are beyond the possi bility of doubt. The establishment of the republic took place, accord- Theestab ing to Roman chronology, in the 245th year from the jj^\u2122* foundation of the city, or 120 years before the sack of Republic.

But the date (509 B.C.) thus assigned to the 'year one' of the republic was evidently conjectural, and it is very"], [62, "HISTORY OF ROME [Bk. II. 44 possible that the change from kings to consuls was only gradually made. However this may be, as to the form of government finally established, possibly towards the close of the sixth century B.C., there is no room for doubt. The supreme executive authority, hitherto wielded by the single king for life, was now transferred to two annually appointed magistrates, who jointly exercised for the year the powers (imperium) of the king, and who were styled ' pr\u00e6tores ' (leaders = Greek o-rpaTtjyot), or possibly 'pr\u00e6tores consules' (= 'joint leaders ').J There was not, however, any diminution of the kingly prerogative, nor, strictly speaking, any division of authority between the two pr\u00e6tor-consuls. They inherited the ' regal imperium ' - in all its pleni- tude, and each consul could singly exercise all the pre- rogatives attached to it. It was in the dual character of the new magistracy, and in the fact that it was held only for a year, that, to use Livy's phrase, the ' begin- nings of liberty' consisted.3 It is characteristic of Rome that this change was made with the least possible disturbance of existing forms. Not only was the title of king retained, though merely as that of a priestly officer (rex sacrorum), but the consuls were always 1 That the consuls were originally styled ' pr\u00e6tores ' is expressly asserted by Varro ap. Nonium, p. 23, aud Livy, iii. 55 ; comp. Cicero, de Legg., iii. 3, 8. The same title was borne by the chief magistrates in many of the Latin communities. When additional pr\u00e6tores (pr\u00e6tor urbauus-peregrinus) were appointed, the two originally pr\u00e6tores seem to have been distinguished as 'niaximi.' Hence Polybius's equivalent for 'consuls' is either ar par-ijy o\u00a3 iJTrarot.

Moreover, though they were rather elected or ' designated ' by a new assembly, by the army of landholders voting by their classes and centuries (comitia centuriata), yet it was still by a vote of the thirty curies (lex curiata) that the supreme authority was formally conferred upon them, and this vote of the curies had still to be ratified by the council of patres (patrum auctoritas). In the position and powers of the senate no formal change was made, although it is probable that before long plebeians were admitted to seats, and though its importance was gradually increased by the substitution of an annual magistracy for the lifelong rule of a single king. Even the ancient assembly of the people by their curies, though cast into the shade by the new centuriate assembly, to which the designation of the consuls and the passing of laws now passed, continued to meet, and, as has been said, to confer the imperium under the old forms upon the magistrates designated by the centuries.

Patricians and plebeians were equally citizens of Rome, sprung of the same race and speaking the same tongue. The former were the members of those ancient 'gentes' which had possibly been once the leading families in the small communities which pre ceded the united state, and which claimed by hereditary right a privileged position in the community. Only patricians could sit in the council of patres, and hence, probably, the name given to their order.1 To their representatives the supreme authority reverted on the death of the king ; the due transmission of the auspicia and the public worship of the state gods were their special care ; and to them alone were known the tradi tional usages and forms which regulated the life of the people from day to day. To the ' plebs ' (the multitude, ir\\.TJ0os) belonged all who were not members of some patrician gens, whether independent freemen or attached as ' clients ' 2 to one of the great houses. The plebeian was a citizen, with civil rights and a vote in the assembly, but he was excluded by ancient custom from all share in the higher honours of the state, and inter marriage with a patrician was not recognised as a properly legal union. 1 Cf.

The plebs had indeed gained something. Not only is it probable that the strictness of the old tie of clientship had somewhat relaxed, and that the number of the ' clientes ' was smaller, and their dependence on patri cian patrons less complete, but the ranks of the plebs had, under the later kings, been swelled by the admis sion of conquered Latins, and the landholders among these had with others been enrolled in the Servian tribes, classes, and centuries. The establishment of the republic invested this military levy of landholders with political rights as an assembly, for by their votes the consuls were chosen and laws passed, and it was the plebeian landholders who formed the main strength of the plebs in the struggle that followed. But these gains were greater in appearance than in reality. The plebeian landholders commanded only a minority of votes in the comitia centuriata. In their choice of magistrates they were limited to the patrician candi dates nominated by patrician presiding magistrates, and their choice required confirmation not only by the older and smaller assembly of the curi\u00e6, in which the patricians and their clients predominated, but also by the patrician patres. They could only vote on laws proposed by patrician consuls, and here again the sub sequent sanction of the patres was necessary.

But these political disabilities did not constitute the main grievance of the plebs in the early years of the republic. What they fought for was protection for their lives and liberties, and the object of attack was the despotic authority of the patrician magistrates. The consuls wielded the full ' imperium ' of the kings. Against this ' consular authority ' the plebeian, though a citizen, had no protection or appeal, and matters were only worse when for the two consuls was substituted in some emergency a single, all-powerful, irresponsible dictator. In Rome, as in Greece, the first efforts of the people were directed against the arbitrary powers of the executive magistrate. The history of this struggle between the orders opens with a concession made to the plebs by one of the consuls themselves, a concession possibly due to a desire to secure the allegiance of the plebeian landholders, who formed the backbone of the army. In the very first year of the republic, according to the received chronology, P. Valerius Poplicola carried in the comitia centuriata his famous law of appeal.1 It enacted that no magistrate, saving only a dictator, should execute a capital sentence upon any Roman citizen, unless the sentence had been confirmed on appeal by the assembly of the centuries. But, though the 'right of appeal' granted by this law was justly regarded in later times as the greatest safeguard of a Roman's liberties, it was by no means at first so effective a protection as it after wards became. For not only was the operation of the 1 Livy, ii. 8, lex Valeria de provocatione ; Cic. de Rep. ii, 31 j cf Livy, iii. 20."], [67, "Ch. i.] STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE ORDERS 49 law limited to the bounds of the city, so that the consul in the field or on the march was left as absolute as before, but no security was provided for its observance even within the city by consuls resolved to disregard it. It was by their own efforts that the plebeians first The first obtained any real protection against magisterial des- and jh'\u00b0n potism. The traditional accounts of the first secession tribunate. are confused and contradictory,1 but its causes and results are tolerably clear. The seceders were the plebeian legionaries recently returned from a victorious campaign. Indignant at the delay of the promised reforms, they ignored the order given them to march afresh against Volsci and \u00c6qui, and instead entrenched themselves on a hill across the Anio, some three miles from Rome, and known afterwards as the Mons Sacer. The frightened patricians came to terms, and a solemn agreement (lex sacrata) 2 was concluded between the orders, by which it was provided that henceforth the plebeians should have annual magistrates of their own (tribuni plebis), members of their own order, who should be authorised to protect them against the consuls,3 and a curse was invoked upon the man who should injure or impede the tribune in the performance of his duties.4 The number of tribunes was at first two, then five, and before 449 B.C. it had been raised to 305 a.u.c ten. The fact that the institution of the tribunate of the plebs was the one result of the first secession is 1 Schwegler, ii. 226 sq. 2 Schwegler, ii. 251, note ; Livy, i. 33. 3 Cic. de Rep., ii. 34, ' contra consulare imperium creati.' 4 Livy, iii. 55. D"], [68, "Lex Publilia. 50 HISTORY OF ROME [Book n. strong evidence that the object of the seceders was not economic or agrarian reform but protection against the consuls. The tribunate gave them this protection in a form which has no parallel in history. The tribune was not, and, strictly speaking, never became a magis trate of the Roman people. His one proper prerogative was that of granting protection to the oppressed plebeian against a patrician officer. This prerogative (jus auxilii) was secured to the tribunes, not by the ordinary constitution, but by a special compact between the orders, and was protected by the ancient oath (vetus jusjurandum),1 which invoked a curse upon the violator of a tribune. This exceptional and anomalous right the tribunes could only exercise in person, within the limits of the 'pom\u0153rium,' and against individual acts of magisterial oppression.2 It was only gradually that it expanded into the later wide power of inter ference with the whole machinery of government, and was supplemented by the legislative and judicial powers which rendered the tribunate of the last century B.C. so formidable, and the 'tribunicia potestas' so essential an element in the authority of the emperors. But from the first the tribunes were for the plebs not only protectors but leaders, under whom they organised themselves in opposition to the patricians. It was the tribunes who convened assemblies of the plebs (concilia plebis), and carried resolutions on questions of interest to the order. This incipient plebeian organisation was 1 Festus, 318 ; .\\ppian, B. C, i. 138. 2 Gell., xiii. 12, ' ut injuria qu\u00e6 coram fieret arceretur.'"], [69, "283 A.U.C. Agrarian agitation The decemvirate. Ch. i.] STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE ORDERS 51 materially advanced by the Publilian law of 471 B.C.,1 which appears to have formally recognised as lawful the plebeian 'concilia,' and established also the tribune's right 'cum plebe agere,' i.e. to propose and carry resolutions in them. These assemblies were 'tributa,' or, in other words, the voting in them took place not by curies or centuries but by tribes. In them, lastly, after the Publilian law, if not before, the tribunes were annually elected.2 Thus the foundations were laid of that plebeian organisation, with its plebeian magis trates, assembly (concilium plebis), and resolutions (plebiscita), which was in after days to become the strongest force in the state. For the time, however, the plebs used the right granted them of free meeting and discussion, and of freely choosing their own leaders for purposes of im mediate importance to themselves. Tradition is possibly right in dating from this period the commencement of the long-continued quarrel as to the disposal of the 'common lands' ('agri publici') of the state. The extent of these was rapidly increasing as Roman dominion extended, but the new lands had been reserved for the enjoyment of patricians alone. Against this monopoly the plebs protested, and demanded that a fair share of these lands should be assigned in small holdings to the plebeians, who had helped to win them. But this agrarian agitation, though destined subse- 1 Livy, ii. 56, 60 ; Dionysius, ix. 41 ; Schwegler, ii. 541 ; Soltau, 493. - For theories as to the original mode of appointing tribunes, see Mommsen, Fonch., i. 185."], [70, "294 A.17.C. 52 HISTORY OF ROME [Book ii. quently to play an important part in the history, was for the time far less fruitful in results than the attack which was now renewed against the consular authority. The proposal of C. Terentillus Arsa (460 B.C.) to appoint a plebeian commission to draw up laws re stricting the powers of the consuls1 was resolutely opposed by the patricians, but after ten years of bitter party strife a compromise was effected. A commission of ten patricians was appointed, who should frame and publish a code of law binding equally on both the orders. These decemviri were to be the sole and supreme magistrates for the year, and the law of appeal was suspended in their favour.2 The code which they promulgated, the famous xii. Tables, owed little of its importance to any novelties or improvements contained in its provisions. For the most part it seems merely to have reaffirmed existing usages and laws. But it substituted a public, written code, binding on all citizens of Rome, for an unwritten usage, the knowledge of which was confined to a few patricians, and which had been administered by this minority in their own interests. With the publication of the code the proper work of the decemvirs was finished ; nevertheless for the next year a fresh decemvirate was elected, and it is conceivable that the intention was permanently to substitute government by an irresponsible patrician ' council of ten ' for the old constitution. However this may have been, the tyranny of the decemvirs them selves was fatal to the continuance of their power. We 1 Livy, iii. 9. 2 Livy, iii. 32."], [71, "Ch. i.] STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE ORDERS 53 are told of a second secession of the plebs, this time to the Janiculum, and of negotiations with the senate, the result of which was the enforced abdication of the decemvirs. The plebs joyfully chose for themselves tribunes, and in the comitia centuriata two consuls were created. But this restoration of the old rigime was vaierio accompanied by legislation which made it an important crisis in the history of the struggle between the orders. With the fall of the decemvirate this struggle enters upon a new phase. The tribunes appear as at once more powerful and more strictly constitutional magis trates ; the plebeian ' concilia ' take their place by the side of the older assemblies ; and, finally, this improved machinery is used not simply in self-defence against patrician oppression, but to obtain complete political equality. This change was no doubt due in part to circumstances outside legislation, above all, to the ex pansion of the Roman state, which swelled the numbers and added to the social importance of the plebs as com pared with the dwindling forces of the close corporation of patrician gentes. But the legislation ascribed to the consuls of 449 B.C. involved more than a restoration of the old form of government. One of their laws was plainly intended to prevent the recurrence of an irresponsible tyranny, such as that of the decemvirs. It reaffirmed the right of appeal granted by the Valerian law.1 But it is to the others that the chief interest attaches. The first of them enacted that whereas it had been a subject of dispute whether a resolution 1 Livy, iii. 55, ' ne quis ullum magistratum sine provocatione crearet. '"], [72, "54 HISTORY OF ROME [Book n. carried by the plebs in their own assembly could bind patricians, for the future, ' What the plebs enacted by their tribes should bind the people.' 1 That these words of Livy do not accurately state the purport of the law is generally agreed. It is utterly improbable that in 449 B.C. plebiscita should have been given, at once and without conditions, the force of law ; but what the con- ditions imposed were it is impossible to say, though it is probable that among them was the requirement that the plebiscite should be ratified by the authority of the patres. In any case, however, the measure provided that, under certain circumstances, the hitherto informal resolutions of the informal concilium of the plebs might pass into law. It thus paved the way for the establish- ment of a plebeian machinery of legislation, and for the recognition of the plebeian magistrates and plebeian assemblies as part of the constitution of the state. In the same spirit, by another Yalerio-Horatian statute, the inviolability of the tribunes, which had hitherto been secured only by the oath of the plebs to maintain it, was now guaranteed by law,2 and the tribunes thus placed in this respect on a level with the magistrates of the state. Finally, by a plebiscite, the first passed under the new conditions, the permanency of the tribunate was secured.3 The plebeian organisation was no longer merely tolerated, it was recognised as an integral part of the constitution. Its efficiency was amply proved by the events that followed. Only a 1 Livy, iii. 55, 'quod tributim plebs iussisset populum teneret.' 2 Ib., 'religione inviolatos lege etiam fecerunt.' 3 Ib., 'qui plebem sine tribunis reliquisset . . . tergo ac capite puniretur.'"], [73, ",c. Ch. I.] STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE ORDERS 55 few years after the Valerio-Horatian legislation came Lex the lex Canuleia, itself a plebiscite (445 B.C.), by which 3^^ mixed marriages between patricians and plebeians were declared lawful, and the social exclusiveness of the patriciate broken down. In the same year with this measure, and, like it, in the interests primarily of the wealthier plebeians, a vigorous attack commenced on the patrician monopoly of the consulate, and round this stronghold of patrician ascendency the conflict raged until the passing of the Licinian laws in 367 B.C. Lege The original proposal of Canuleius in 445 B.C. that the g^uf people should be allowed to elect a plebeian consul was 387 *-v-c evaded by a compromise. The senate resolved that for the next year, in the stead of consuls, six military tribunes with consular powers should be elected,1 and that the new office should be open to patricians and plebeians alike. The consulship was thus for the time saved from pollution, as the patricians phrased it, but the growing strength of the plebs is shown by the fact that in fifty years out of the seventy-eight, between 444 sio-ss a.u and 366 B.C., they succeeded in obtaining the election of consular tribunes rather than of consuls. A good omen for their ultimate success was a victory they won in connection with the inferior office of the qu\u00e6storship. Down to the time of the decemvirate the qu\u00e6stors had been nominated by the consuls, but in 447 B.C. their 307 a.u.c appointment was transferred to the plebeian 'comitia tributa,' 2 and in 421 B.C. the first plebeian was elected to 1 On the question of the identity of these ' comitia tributa ' with the concilium plebis, see Appendix. 2 Livy, iv. 7 ; cf, Mommsen, Staatsrecltt, ii. 165."], [74, "333 A.u.c. 319 A.u.c. 377 a.u.c. 56 HISTORY OF ROME [Book n. the office.1 Despite, however, these discouragements, the patricians fought on. Each year they strove to secure the creation of consuls rather than consular tribunes, and, failing this, strained every nerve to secure for their own order at least a majority among the latter. Even the institution of the censorship (435 B.C.), though rendered desirable by the increasing importance and complexity of the census, was, it is probable, due in part to their desire to discount beforehand the threatened loss of the consulship by diminishing its powers.2 Other causes, too, helped to protract the struggle. Between the wealthier plebeians, who were ambitious of high office, and the poorer, whose minds were set rather on allotments of land, there was a division of interest of which the patricians were not slow to take advantage, and to this circumstance must be added the pressure of war. The death-struggle with Yeii and the sack of Rome by the Gauls absorbed for the time all the energies of the community. In 377 B.C., however, two of the tribunes, C. Licinius Stolo and L. Sextius, came forward with proposals which united all sections of the plebs in their support. Their proposals were as follows:3 \u2014 (1) that consuls and not consular tribunes be elected; (2) that one consul at least should be a plebeian ; (3) that the priestly college, which had the charge of the Sibylline books, should consist of ten members instead of two, and that of these half should be plebeians ; (4) that no single citizen should hold in 1 Livy, iv. 43 ; Mommsen, Staatsrecht, ii. 497. 2 Mommsen, ib. 304. s Livy, vi. 35, 42 ; Appian, B, C, i. 8."], [75, "Ch. i.] STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE ORDERS 57 occupation more than 500 acres of the common lands, or pasture upon them more than 100 head of cattle and 500 sheep ; (5) that all landowners should employ a certain amount of free as well as slave labour on their estates ; (6) that interest already paid on debts should be deducted from the principal, and the remainder paid off in three years. The three last proposals were obviously intended to meet the demands of the poorer plebeians, and to secure their support for the first half of the scheme. Ten years of bitter conflict 387 a.u.c followed, but at last, in 367 B.C., the Licinian rogations became law, and one of their authors, L. Sextius, was created the first plebeian consul. For the moment it was some consolation to the patricians that they not only succeeded in detaching from the consulship the administration of civil law, which was intrusted to a separate officer, 'pr\u00e6tor urbanus,' to be elected by the comitia of the centuries, with an understanding apparently that he should be a patrician, but also obtained the institution of two additional \u00e6diles ('\u00e6diles curules '), who were in like manner to be members of their own order.1 With the opening of the consulship, however, the issue of the long contest was virtually decided, and the next eighty years witnessed a rapid succession of plebeian victories.

In 356 B.C. the first plebeian was made dictator, in 350 B.C. the censorship, and in 337 B.C. the pr\u00e6torship were filled for the first time by plebeians, and lastly, in 300 B.C., by the lex Ogulnia, even the sacred colleges of the pontiffs and augurs, the old strongholds of patrician supremacy, were thrown open to the plebs.1 A no less important victory was that which formally secured the independence of the people in assembly. From the first the acts both of the people in the comitia of centuries and of the plebs in their concilium had re quired ratification by the patres, and this check on the people's freedom of action was rightly regarded by the patricians as one of the main supports of their ascend ency.2 But in 339 B.C. a plebeian dictator, Q. Publilius Philo, carried a law enacting that in the case of measures proposed in the comitia centuriata, the auctoritas patrum should be given beforehand.3 A lex M\u00e6nia, of uncer tain date, extended the rule to elections in the same assembly. By another law of Publilius, followed some fifty years later by the famous lepX Hortensia, the plebeian ' concilium ' was also emancipated from the control of the patres.4 Thenceforward the ' auctoritas patrum ' became a meaningless form of words hurried over, as a matter of course, before the voting began.0 1 Livy, vii. 17, 22 ; viii. 15 ; ix. 6. 2 Cic. de Rep., ii. 32 ; pro Plancis, iii. 8.

So far as the law could do it, the sovereignty of the people in election and legislation was secured. With the passing of the Lex Hortensia the long struggle between the orders came to an end. The ancient patrician ' gentes ' remained, but the exclusive privileges of the patriciate as a ruling order were gone. For the great offices of state, and for seats in the senate, the plebeians were by law equally eligible with patricians. The assemblies, whether of people or plebs, were inde pendent of patrician control. In private life intermar riages between patricians and plebeians were recognised as lawful, and entailed no disabilities on the children. Finally, great as continued to be the prestige attaching to patrician birth, and prominent as was the part played in the subsequent history by individual patri cians and by some of the patrician houses, the plebs were now in numbers and even in wealth the prepon derant section of the people. Whatever struggles might arise in the future, a second struggle between patricians and plebeians was an impossibility. Such being the case, it might have been expected that the separate organisation, to which the victory of the plebs was largely due, would, now that the reason for its existence was gone, have disappeared.

Nor was the promise of a genuine democracy offered by the opening of the magistracies and by the Hortensian law, fulfilled.

THE CONQUEST OF ITALY. The period occupied by the struggle between the orders is also that during which Rome slowly advanced to supremacy in Italy, for it was only twelve years after the passing of the Lex Hortensia that the repulse of King Pyrrhus left her the mistress of the peninsula. The steps by which this supremacy was won have now to be traced. Under the rule of her Etruscan princes Rome had spread her sway over the lowlands of Latium, and her arms were a terror to the warlike Highlanders of the Sabine and Volscian hills. But with their fall this miniature empire fell also, and at first it seemed as if the infant republic, torn by internal dissensions, must succumb to the foes who threatened it from so many sides at once. It was only after one hundred and fifty years of almost constant war that Rome succeeded in rolling back the tide of invasion and in establishing her supremacy over the neighbouring lowlands and over the hill country which bordered them to the east and south. The close of this first stage in her external growth is conveniently marked by the first collision with the Sabellian peoples beyond the Liris in 343 B.C.1 1 Livy, vii. 29."], [80, "411-85 A.U.C 347 A.u.c. League with the Latius and Herni- cans. 261 A.u.c. 62 HISTORY OF ROME [Book n. In marked contrast with the slowness of her advance up to this point is the fact that only seventy-five years more were needed for the virtual subjugation of all the rest of the peninsula (343-269 A.u.c). The expulsion of the Tarquins from Rome, followed as it seems to have been by the emancipation from Etruscan supremacy of all the country between the Tiber and the Liris, entirely altered the aspect of affairs. North of the Tiber the powerful Etruscan city of Veii, after a vain attempt to restore the Tarquins, relapsed into an attitude of sullen hostility towards Rome, which, down to the outbreak of the final struggle in 407 B.C., found vent in constant and harassing border forays. The Sabines recommenced their raids across the Anio ; from their hills to the south-east the \u00c6qui pressed forward as far as the eastern spurs of the Alban range, and ravaged the plain country between that range and the Sabine mountains ; the Volsci overran the coast-lands as far as Antium, established themselves at Velitr\u00e6, and even ravaged the fields within a few miles of Rome. But the good fortune of Rome did not leave her to face these foes single-handed, and it is a significant fact that the history of the Roman advance begins, not with a brilliant victory, but with a useful and timely alliance. According to Livy, it was in 493 B.C., only a few years after the defeat of the prince of Tusculum at Lake Regillus, that a treaty was con cluded between Rome and the Latin communities of the Campagna.1 The alliance was in every respect i Livy, ii. 33 ; Cic. pro Balbo, 23."], [81, "Ch. 2.] THE CONQUEST OF ITALY 63 natural, and may very probably have been only the renewal of an ancient friendship. The Latins were the near neighbours and kinsmen of the Romans, and both Romans and Latins were just freed from Etruscan rule to find themselves as lowlanders and dwellers in towns face to face with a common foe in the ruder hill tribes on their borders. The exact terms of the treaty cannot, any more than the precise circumstances under which it was concluded, be stated with certainty, but two points seem clear. There was at first a genuine equality in the relations between the allies ; Romans and Latins, though combining for defence and offence, did so without sacrificing their separate freedom of action, even in the matter of waging wars independently of each other.1 But, secondly, Rome enjoyed from the first one inestimable advantage. The Latins lay between her and the most active of her foes, the \u00c6qui and Volsci, and served to protect her territories at the expense of their own. Behind this barrier Rome grew strong, and the close of the \u00c6quian and Volscian wars left the Latins her dependants rather than her allies. Beyond the limits of the Campagna Rome found a second ally, hardly less useful than the Latins, in the tribe of the Hernici (' the men of the rocks '), in the valley of the Trerus, who had equal reason with the Romans and Latins to dread the Yolsci and \u00c6qui, while their posi tion midway between the two latter peoples made them valuable auxiliaries to the lowlanders of the Campagna. The treaty with the Hernici is said to have been 1 Livy, viii. 2."], [82, "265 A.u.c. 414 A.u.c. 280 A.u.c 305 A.u.c. 305-04 A.U.C Capture of Veii. 358 A.U.C 308 A.u.c. 64 HISTORY OF ROME [Book n. concluded in 486 B.C.,1 and the confederacy of the three peoples \u2014 Romans, Latins, and Hernicans \u2014 lasted down to the great Latin war in 340 B.C. Confused and untrust worthy as are the chronicles of the early wars of Rome, it is clear that, notwithstanding the acquisition of these allies, Rome made but little way against her foes during the first fifty years of the existence of the republic. In 474 B.C., it is true, an end was put for a time to the harassing border feud with Veii by a forty years' peace, an advantage probably due not so much to Roman valour as to the increasing dangers from other quarters which were threatening the Etruscan states.2 But this partial success stands alone, and down to 449 B.C. the raids of Sabines, \u00c6qui, and Volsci continue without intermission, and are occasionally carried up to the very walls of Rome. Very different is the impression left by the annals of the next sixty years (449-390 B.C.). During this period there is an unmistakable development of Roman power on all sides. In southern Etruria the capture of Veii (396 B.C.) virtually gave Rome the mastery as far as the Ciminian forest. Sutrium and Nepete, 'the gates of Etruria,' became her allies, and guarded her interests against any attack from the Etruscan communities to the north, while along the Tiber valley her suzerainty was acknowledged as far as Capena and Falerii.

After 418 B.C. they disappear 336 a.u.c from Mount Algidus, and in the same year the com- munications of Rome and Latium with the Hernici in the Trerus valley were secured by the capture and colonisation of Labicum. Successive invasions, too, broke the strength of the Volsci, and in 393 B.C. a Latin 361 a.u.c colony was founded as far south as Circeii. In part, no doubt, these Roman successes were due to the improved condition of affairs in Rome itself, consequent upon the great reforms carried between 450 and 442 B.C. ; 304-12 a.u but it is equally certain that now, as often afterwards, fortune befriended Rome by weakening, or by diverting the attention of, her opponents. In particular, her Decline of rapid advance in southern Etruria was facilitated by p0\u2122esrra\" the heavy blows inflicted upon the Etruscans during the fifth century B.C., by Kelts, Greeks, and Samnites. By the close of this century the Kelts had expelled them from the rich plains of what was afterwards known as Cisalpine Gaul, and were even threatening to advance across the Apennines into Etruria proper. The Sicilian Greeks, headed by the tyrants of Syracuse, wrested from them their mastery of the seas, and finally, on the capture of Capua by the Samnites in 423 B.C., 331 a.u.c they lost their possessions in the fertile Campanian plain. These conquests of the Samnites were part of a great southward movement of the highland Sabellian peoples, the immediate effects of which upon the fortunes of Rome were not confined to the weakening of the Etruscan power.

We may conjecture, also, that the growing feebleness exhibited by Volsci and \u00c6qui was in some measure caused by the pressure upon their rear of the Sabellian clans which at this time established themselves near the Fucine Lake and along the course of the Liris. But in 390 B.C., only six years after the great victory over her ancient rival Veii, the Roman advance was for a moment checked by a disaster which threatened to alter the course of history in Italy, and which left a last ing impress on the Roman mind. In 391 B.C. a Keltic horde left their newly won lands on the Adriatic, and, crossing the Apennines into Etruria, laid siege to the Etruscan city of Clusium (Chiusi). Thence, provoked, it is said, by the conduct of the Roman ambassadors, who, forgetting their sacred character, had fought in the ranks of Clusium and slain a Keltic chief, the barbarians marched upon Rome. On July 18, 390 B.C., only a few miles from Rome, was fought the disastrous battle of the Allia. The defeat of the Romans was complete, and Rome lay at the mercy of her foe. But in characteristic fashion the Kelts halted three days to enjoy the fruits of victory, and time was thus given to put the Capitol at least in a state of defence. The arrival of the barbarians was followed by the sack of the city, but the Capitol remained impregnable. For seven months they besieged it, and then in as sudden a fashion as they had come they disappeared.

More probably the news that their lands across the Apennines were threatened by the Veneti, coupled with the unaccustomed tedium of a long siege and the difficulty of obtaining supplies, inclined the Kelts to accept readily a heavy ransom as the price of their withdrawal. But, whatever the reason, it is certain that they retreated, and, though during the next fifty years marauding bands appeared at intervals in the neighbour hood of Rome, and even once penetrated as far south as Campania (361-360 B.C.), the Kelts never obtained any 393-394a.u.c. footing in Italy outside the plains in the north which they had made their own. Nor, in spite of the defeat on the Allia and the Annexation sack of the city, was Rome weakened except for the Etruria \"\" moment by the Keltic attack. The storm passed away j as rapidly as it had come on. The city was hastily rebuilt, and Rome dismayed the enemies who hastened to take advantage of her misfortunes by her un diminished vigour. Her conquests in southern Etruria were successfully defended against repeated attacks from the Etruscans to the north. The creation in 387 B.C. 367 a.u.c of four new tribes (Stellatina, Sabatina, Tromentina, Arniensis) marked the final annexation of the territory of Veii and of the lands lying along the Tiber valley. A few years later Latin colonies were established at Sutrium and Nepete for the more effectual defence of the frontier, and finally, in 353 B.C., the subjugation of 401 a.u.c South Etruria was completed by the submission of C\u00e6re (Cervetri) and its partial incorporation with the"], [88, "68 HISTORY OF ROME [Book II. Roman state as a ' municipium sine suffragio ' \u2014 the first, it is said, of its kind.1 Next to the settlement of southern Etruria the most important of the successes gained by Rome between 390 and 343 B.C. were those won against her old foes the \u00c6qui and Volsci, and her old allies the Latins and Hernicans. The \u00c6qui, indeed, already weakened by their long feud with Rome, and hard pressed by the Sabellian tribes in their rear, were easily dealt with, and after the campaign of 389 B.C. we have no further men tion of an \u00c6quian war until the last \u00c6quian rising in 304 B.C. The Volsci, who in 389 B.C. had advanced to Lanuvium, were met and utterly defeated by M. Furius Camillus, the conqueror of Veii, and this victory was followed up by the gradual subjugation to Rome of all the lowland country lying between the hills and the sea as far south as Tarracina. Latin colonies were established at Satricum (385 B.C.), at Setia (379 B.C.), and at Antium and Tarracina some time before 348 B.C. In 358 B.C. two fresh Roman tribes (Pomptina and Publilia) were formed in the same district.2 Successes against \u00c6qui and Volsci. 364-41lA.u.c 365 a.u.c 450 a.u.c 360,375a.u.c 406,396a.u.c Rome had now nothing more to fear from the foes who, a century ago, had threatened her very existence. The lowland country \u2014 of which she was the natural centre, from the Ciminian forest to Tarracina \u2014 was quiet, and within its limits Rome was by far the strongest power. But she had now to reckon with the old and faithful allies, to whose loyal aid her present Re-organisa tion of the Latin league. 1 For the status of C\u00e6re, and the ' C\u00e6rite franchise,' see Marquardt, Staatsverw., i. 28 sq. ; Madvig, R.

The Latins and Hernicans had suffered severely in the \u00c6quian and Volscian wars ; it is probable that not a few of the smaller communities included in the league had either been destroyed or been absorbed by larger states, and the independence of all alike was threatened by the growing power of Rome. The sack of Rome by the Kelts gave them an opportunity of reasserting their independence, and we are consequently told that this disaster was immedi ately followed by the temporary dissolution of the con federacy, and this again a few years later by a series of actual conflicts between Rome and her former allies. Between 383 B.C. and 358 B.C. we hear of wars with 37i-396a.u.c. Tibur, Pr\u00e6neste, Tusculum, Lanuvium, Circeii, and the Hernici. But in all Rome was successful. In 382 B.C. 372a.u.c. Tusculum was fully incorporated with the Roman state by the bestowal of the full franchise ; 1 in 358 B.C., 396 a.u.c. according to both Livy and Polybius, the old alliance was formally renewed with Latins and Hernicans. We cannot, however, be wrong in assuming that the posi tion of the allies under the new league was far inferior to that accorded them by the treaty of Spurius Cassius.2 Henceforth they were the subjects rather than the equals of Rome, a position which it is evident that they accepted much against their will, and from which they were yet to make one last effort to escape. We have now reached the close of the first stage in Rome's advance towards supremacy in Italy. By 343 411 a.u.c B.C. she was already mistress both of the low country 1 Livy, vi. 26. - Mommsen, R.

Her own terri tory had largely increased. Across the Tiber the lands of Veii, Capena, and C\u00e6re were nearly all Roman, while in Latium she had carried her frontiers to Tusculum on the Alban range, and to the southernmost limits of the Pomptine district. And this territory was protected by a circle of dependent allies and colonies' reaching northward to Sutrium and Nepete, and southward to Sora on the upper Liris, and to Circeii on the coast. Already, too, she was beginning to be recognised as a power outside the limits of the Latin lowlands. The fame of the capture of Rome by the Kelts had reached Athens, and her subsequent victories over marauding Keltic bands had given her prestige in South Italy as a bulwark against northern barbarians. In 354 B.C. she had formed her first connec tions beyond the Liris by a treaty with the Samnites, and in 348 B.C. followed a far more important treaty with the great maritime state of Carthage.1 Rome had won her supremacy from the Ciminian forest to the Liris as the champion of the comparatively civilised communities of the lowlands against the rude highland tribes which threatened to overrun them, and so, when her legions first crossed the Liris, it was in answer to an appeal from a lowland city against in vaders from the hills. While she was engaged in clear ing Latium of Volsci and \u00c6qui, the Sabellian tribes of 1 Livy, vii. 27.

Foremost among these tribes were the Samnites, a portion of whom had cap tured the Etruscan city of Capua in 423 B.C., the Greek 33i,334a.u.c. Cum\u00e6 in 420 B.C., and had since then ruled as masters over the fertile Campanian territory. But in their new homes the conquerors soon lost all sense of relationship and sympathy with their highland brethren. They dwelt in cities, amassed wealth, and inherited the civilisation of the Greeks and Etruscans whom they had dispossessed ; l above all, they had before long to defend themselves in their turn against the attacks of their ruder kinsmen from the hills, and it was for aid against these that the Samnites of Campania appealed to the rising state which had already made herself known as the bulwark of the lowlands north of the Liris, and which, with her Latin and Hernican allies, had scarcely less interest than the Campanian cities themselves in checking the raids of the highland Samnite tribes. The Campanian appeal was listened to.

After two campaigns the war was ended in 341 B.C. by a treaty, and the Samnites withdrew from the lowlands, leaving Rome the recognised suzerain of the Campanian cities which had sought her aid.1 There is no doubt that the check thus given by Rome to the advance of the hitherto invincible Sabellian highlanders not only made her the natural head and champion of the low countries, south as well as north of the Liris, but also considerably added to her prestige. Carthage sent her congratulations, and the city of Falerii voluntarily enrolled herself among the allies of Rome. Of even greater service, however, was the fact that for fifteen years the Samnites remained quiet, for this inactivity, whatever its cause, enabled Rome triumphantly to surmount a danger which threatened for the moment to wreck her whole position. This danger was nothing less than a desperate effort on the part of nearly all her allies and dependants south of the Tiber to throw off the yoke of her supremacy. The way was led by her ancient confederates the Latins, whose smouldering discontent broke into open flame directly the fear of a Samnite attack was removed. From the Latin Campagna and the Sabine hills the revolt spread westward and southward to Antium and Tarracina, and even to the towns of the Campanian plain, where the mass of the inhabitants at once re pudiated the alliance formed with Rome by the ruling class. The struggle was sharp but short. In two 1 For the difficulties in the traditional accounts of this war, see Mommsen, R. G., i. 355, note; Schwegler-Clason, if.

The revolt crushed, Rome set herself deliberately to the task of re-establishing, on a new Settlement and firmer basis, her supremacy over the lowlands, and ofLatlum; in doing so laid the foundations of that marvellous organisation which was destined to spread rapidly over Italy, and to withstand the attacks even of Hannibal. The old historic Latin league ceased to exist, though its memory was still preserved by the yearly Latin festival on the Alban Mount. Most, if not all, of the common land of the league became Roman territory ; 2 five, at least, of the old Latin cities were compelled to accept the Roman franchise,3 and enter the pale of the Roman state. The rest, with the Latin colonies, were ranked as Latin allies of Rome, but on terms which secured their complete dependence upon the sovereign city. The policy of isolation, which became so cardinal a principle of Roman rule, was now first systematically applied. No rights of ' connubium ' or ' commercium ' were any longer to exist between these communities. Their federal councils were prohibited, and all federal action independent of Rome forbidden.4 In future they were to have nothing in common but the common connection with Rome, a connection based in each case on a separate treaty between the individual 1 At the foot of Mount Vesuvius, Livy, viii. 9; at Trifanum, id., viii. 11. 2 Livy, viii. 11. 3 Livy, viii. 14 ; Lanuvium, Aricia, Nomentum, Pedum, Tusculum. 4 Livy, loc. cit, ' ceteris Latinis populis connubia commei'ciaque et concilia inter se adeiuerunt.'"], [94, "aud of Campania, 416-426A.U.C 424 A.U.C. 74 HISTORY OF ROME [Book II. Latin community and Rome. The Latin allied state retained its internal independence, and the old rights of intermarriage and commerce with Rome, but it lost all freedom of action in external affairs. It could wage no wars, conclude no treaties, and was bound, so the phrase ran, to have always the same foes and friends as Rome herself. In Campania, and the coast-lands connecting Campania with Rome, a policy of annexa tion was considered safer than that of alliance. Of the two frontier posts of the Volsci, Antium and Velitr\u00e6, the former was constituted a Roman colony, its long galleys burnt, and their prows set up in the Forum at Rome, while the walls of Velitr\u00e6 were razed to the ground, its leading men banished beyond the Tiber, and their lands given to Roman settlers. Further south on the route to Campania, Fundi and Formi\u00e6 were, after the precedent set in the case of C\u00e6re, declared Roman, and granted the civil rights of Roman citizen ship; while, lastly, in Campania itself the same status was given to Capua, Cum\u00e6, and the smaller communi ties dependent upon them.1 During the ten years from 338 B.C. to 328 B.C. the work of settlement was steadily continued. Tarracina, like Antium, was made a Roman colony. Privernum, the last Volscian town to offer resistance to Rome, was subdued in 330 B.C., part of its territory allotted to Roman citizens, and the state itself forced to accept the Roman franchise. Lastly, to strengthen the lines of defence against the Sabellian 1 For the controversy as to the precise status of Capua and the 'equites Campani' (Livy, viii. 14), see Beloch, Hal, Bund, 122 sq. ; Id., Campanien, 317; Zumpt, Comment.

The settlement of the lowlands was accomplished. From the Ciminian forest to the southern extremity of the Campanian plain, the lands lying between the sea and the hills were now, with few exceptions, Roman territory, while along the frontiers from Sutrium and Nepete in the north to Cales in the south stretched the protecting line of the Latin allied states and colonies. As a single powerful and compact state, with an outer circle of closely dependent allies, Rome now stood in sharp contrast with the disunited and degenerate cities of northern Etruria, the loosely organised tribes of the Apennines, and the decaying and disorderly Greek towns of the south. The strength of this system was now to be tried by second a struggle with the one Italian people who were still e ready and able to contest with Rome the supremacy of the peninsula. The passive attitude of the Samnites between 342 B.C. and 327 B.C. was no doubt largely due 412-427a.c.c. to the dangers which had suddenly threatened them in South Italy. But the death of Alexander of Epirus in 332 1 B.C. removed their only formidable opponent there, 422a.u.c. and left them free to turn their attention to the necessity of checking the steady advance of Rome. In 327 B.C., the 427 a.u.c. year after the ominous foundation of a Roman colony at Fregell\u00e6, a pretext for renewing the struggle was offered them.

The Samnites sent a force to defend it, and Rome replied by a declaration of war. The two opponents were not at first sight unequally matched, and had the Sabellian tribes held firmly together the issue of the struggle might have been different. As it was, however, the Lucanians to the south actually sided with Rome from the first, while the northern clans, Marsi, Vestini, P\u00e6ligni, Frentani, after a feeble and luke warm resistance, subsided into a neutrality which was exchanged in 304 B.C. for a formal alliance with Rome. An even greater advantage to Rome from the outset was the enmity existing between the Samnites and the Apulians, the latter of whom at once joined Rome, and thus gave her a position in the rear of her enemy, and in a country eminently well-fitted for maintaining a large military force. These weaknesses on the Samnite side were amply illustrated by the events of the war. The first seven or eight years were marked by one serious disaster to the Roman arms, the defeat at the Caudine Forks (321 B.C.); but, when in 318 B.C. the Samnites asked for and obtained a two-years' truce, Rome had succeeded not only in inflicting several severe blows upon her enemies, but in isolating them from out side help. The Lucanians to the south were her allies. To the east, in the rear of Samnium, Apulia acknow ledged the suzerainty of Rome, and Luceria, captured in 320 B.C., had been established as a base of Roman operations. Finally, to the north the Romans had easily overcome the feeble resistance of the Vestini and Frentani, and secured through their territories a safe passage for their legions to Apulia. On the renewal of"], [97, "Ch. 2.] THE CONQUEST OF ITALY 77 hostilities in 316 B.C., the Samnites, bent on escaping 438 a.u.c. from the net which was being slowly drawn round them, made a series of desperate efforts to break through the lines of defence which protected Latium and Campania. Sora and Fregell\u00e6 on the upper Liris were captured by a sudden attack ; the Ausones in the low country near the mouth of the same river were encouraged to revolt by the appearance of the Samnite army ; and in Campania another force, attracted by rumours of dis turbance, all but defeated the Roman consuls under the very walls of Capua. But these efforts were un availing. Sora and Fregell\u00e6 were recovered as quickly as they had been lost, and the frontier there was strengthened by the establishment of a colony at Interamna. The Ausones were punished by the con fiscation of their territory, and Roman supremacy further secured by the two colonies of Suessa and Pontia (312 B.C.). The construction of the famous Via 442 a.u.c. Appia,1 the work of the censor Appius Claudius C\u00e6cus, opened a safe and direct route to Campania, while the capture of Nola deprived the Samnites of their last important stronghold in the Campanian lowlands. The failure of these attempts broke the courage even of the Samnites. Their hopes were indeed raised for a moment by the news that Etruria had risen against Rome (310 B.C.), but their daring scheme of effecting a 444 a.u.c. union with the Etruscans was frustrated by the energy of the Roman generals. Five years later (305 B.C.) the 449 a.u.c Romans revenged a Samnite raid into Campania by an invasion of Samnium itself.

Already, two years before the peace, a rash revolt of the Hernici2 had given Rome a pretext for finally annexing she territory of her ancient allies. The tribal confederacy was broken up, and all the Hernican communities, with the exception of three which had not joined the revolt, were incorporated with the Roman state as municipia, with the civil rights of the Roman franchise. Between the Hernican valley and the frontiers of the nearest Sabellian tribes lay what remained of the once formid able people of the \u00c6qui. In their case, too, a revolt (304 B.C.) was followed by the annexation of their terri tory, which was marked in this case by the formation there (301 B.C.) of two Roman tribes (Aniensis and Teren tina).3 Not content with thus carrying the borders of their own territory up to the very frontiers of the Sabel lian country, Rome succeeded in finally detaching from the Sabellian confederacy all the tribes lying 4 between the north-east frontier of Latium and the Adriatic Sea. Henceforward the Marsi, P\u00e6ligni, Vestini, Marrucini, and Frentani were enrolled among the allies of Rome, and not only swelled her forces in the field, but inter posed a useful barrier between her enemies to the north in Etruria and Umbria, and those to the south in 1 Livy, ix. 29. 2 Livy, ix. 45. 3 Livy, ix. 45. 4 Livy, x. 9."], [99, "Ch. 2.] THE CONQUEST OF ITALY 79 Samnium, while they connected her directly with the friendly Apulians. Lastly, as a security for the fidelity at least of the nearest of these allies, colonies were planted in the Marsian territories at Carseoli and at Alba Fucentia. A significant indication of the widen ing range of Rome's influence in Italy, and of the new responsibilities rapidly pressing upon her, is the fact that when in 302 B.C. the Spartan Cleonymus landed in 452 a.u.c. the territory of the Sallentini, far away in the south east, he was met and repulsed by a Roman force.1 Six years after the conclusion of the treaty which Third ended the Second Samnite War (298 B.C.), news arrived War that the Samnites were harassing the Lucanians. Rome *M\"-C' at once interfered to protect her allies. Samnium was invaded in force, the country ravaged, and one strong hold after another captured. Unable any longer to hold their own in a position where they were hedged round by enemies, the Samnite leaders turned as a last hope to the communities of northern Etruria, to the free tribes of Umbria, and to the once dreaded Kelts. With a splendid daring they formed the scheme of uniting all these peoples with themselves in a last desperate effort to break the power of Rome. For some forty years after the final annexation of Romans in southern Etruria (351 B.C.) matters had remained un- 40'3 A\u2122\"a' changed in that quarter. Sutrium and Nepete still guarded the Roman frontier ; the natural boundary of the Ciminian forest was still intact ; and up the valley of the Tiber Rome had not advanced beyond Falerii, a 1 Livy, x. 2."], [100, "443 a.u.c 403 a.u.c. 445-446A.U.C 80 HISTORY OF ROME [Book II. few miles short of the most southerly Umbrian town Ocriculum. But in 311 B.C., on the expiry, apparently, of the long truce with Rome, concluded in 351 B.C., the northern Etruscans, alarmed, no doubt, by the rapid advances which Rome was making further south, rose in arms and attacked Sutrium. The attack, however, recoiled disastrously upon the heads of the assailants. A Roman force promptly relieved Sutrium, and its leader, Q. Fabius Rullianus, without awaiting orders from home, boldly plunged into the wilds of the Ciminian forest, and, crossing them safely, swept with fire and sword over the rich lands to the north. Then, turning southward, he met and utterly defeated the forces which the Etruscans had hastily raised in the hopes of intercepting him at the Vadimonian Lake.1 This decisive victory ended the war. The Etruscan cities, disunited among themselves, and enervated by long years of peace, abandoned the struggle for the time, paid a heavy indemnity, and concluded a truce with Rome (309-308). In the same year the prompti tude of Fabius easily averted a threatened attack by the Umbrians, but Rome proceeded, nevertheless, to fortify herself in her invariable fashion against future dangers on this side by an alliance with Ocriculum, which was followed ten years later by a colony at Nequinum,2 and an alliance with the Picentes, whose position in the rear of Umbria rendered them as valu able to Rome as the Apulians had proved further south. 1 Livy, ix. 39.

Their appeal, backed by the presence of their troops, was successful. The Etruscans found courage to face the Roman legions once more ; a few of the Umbrians joined them ; but the most valuable allies to the Samnites were the Kelts, who had for some time threatened a raid across the Apennines, and who now marched eagerly into Umbria and joined the coalition. The news that the Kelts were in motion produced a startling effect at Rome, and every nerve was strained to meet this new danger. While two armies were left in southern Etruria as reserves, the two consuls, Fabius and Decius, both tried soldiers, marched northwards up the valley of the Tiber and into Umbria, at the head of four Roman legions and a still larger force of Italian allies. At Sentinum, on the further side of the Apennines, they encountered the united forces of the Kelts and Sam nites, the Etruscans and Umbrians having, it is said, been withdrawn for the defence of their own homes. The battle that followed was desperate, and the Romans lost one of their consuls, Decius, and more than 8000 men.1 But the Roman victory was decisive. The Kelts were annihilated, and the fear of a second Keltic attack on Rome removed. All danger from the coali tion was over.

II. rising in Umbria, never formidable, died away, and the Samnites were left single-handed to bear the whole weight of the wrath of Rome. During four years more, however, they desperately defended their highland homes, and twice at least, in 293 B.C. and 292 B.C., they managed to place in the field a force sufficient to meet the Roman legions on equal terms. At last, in 290 B.C., the consul M. Curius Dentatus finally exhausted their power of resistance. Peace was concluded, and it is significant of the respect inspired at Rome by their indomitable courage that they were allowed to become the allies of Rome, on equal terms, and without any sacrifice of independence.1 Between the close of the Third Samnite War and the landing of Pyrrhus in 281 B.C., we find Rome engaged, as her wont was, in quietly extending and consolidating her power. In southern Italy she strengthened her hold on Apulia by planting on the borders of Apulia and Lucania the strong colony of Venusia.2 In central Italy the annexation of the Sabine country (290 B.C.) carried her frontiers eastward to the borders of her Picentine allies on the Adriatic.3 Further east, in the territory of the Picentes themselves, she established colonies on the Adriatic coast at Hadria and Castrum (285-283 B.C.).4 By these measures her control of central Italy from sea to sea was secured, and an effectual barrier interposed between her possible enemies in the north and those in the south.

Ten years after their defeat at Sentinum (285-284 B.C.) a Keltic force descended 470 a.u.c. into Etruria, besieged Arretium, and defeated the relieving force despatched by Rome. In 283 B.C. the 471 a.u.c. consul L. Cornelius Dolabella was sent to avenge the insult. He completely routed the Senones. .Their lands were annexed by Rome, and a colony established at Sena on the coast. This success, followed as it was by the decisive defeat of the neighbouring tribe of the Boii, who had invaded Etruria and penetrated as far south as the Vadimonian Lake, awed the Kelts into quiet, and for more than forty years there was com parative tranquillity in northern Italy.1 In the south, however, the claims of Rome to war with supremacy were now to be disputed by a new and \u00ab*b . formidable foe. At the close of the Third Samnite 473-479 a.u.c War the Greek cities on the southern coast of Italy found themselves once more harassed by the Sabellian tribes on their borders, whose energies, no longer absorbed by the long struggles in central Italy, now found an attractive opening southward. Naturally enough the Greeks, like the Capuans sixty years before, appealed for aid to Rome (283-282 B.C.), and like the 47i-472a.u.c Capuans they offered in return to recognise the suze rainty of the great Latin republic. In reply a Roman force under C. Fabricius marched into South Italy, easily routed the marauding bands of Lucanians, 1 Livy, Epit, xii. ; Polybius, ii. 20."], [104, "453 A.u.c. 473-474A.U.C. 84 HISTORY OF ROME [Bk. II. Bruttians, and Samnites, and established Roman garri sons in Locri, Croton, Rhegium, and Thurii. At Tarentum, the most powerful and flourishing of the Greek seaports, this sudden and rapid advance of Rome excited the greatest anxiety. Tarentum was already allied by treaty (301 B.C.) with Rome, and she had now to decide whether this treaty should be exchanged for one which would place her, like the other Greek communities, under the protectorate of Rome, or whether she should find some ally able and willing to assist in making a last stand for independence. The former course, in Tarentum, as before at Capua, was the one favoured by the aristocratic party ; the latter was eagerly supported by the mass of the people and their leaders. While matters were still in suspense, the appearance, contrary to the treaty, of a Roman squadron off. the harbour decided the controversy. The Tarentines, indignant at the insult, attacked the hostile fleet, killed the admiral, and sunk most of the ships. Still Rome, relying, probably, on her partisans in the city, tried negotiation, and an alliance appeared likely after all, when suddenly the help for which the Tarentine democrats had been looking appeared, and war with Rome was resolved upon (281-280 B.C.).1 King Pyrrhus, whose timely appearance seemed for the moment to have saved the independence of Taren tum, was the most brilliant of the military adventurers whom the disturbed times following the death of Alexander the Great had brought into prominence. 1 Livy, Epit, xii. ; Plut., Pyrrh., 13."], [105, "Ch. 2.] THE CONQUEST OF ITALY 85 High-spirited, generous, and ambitious, he had formed the scheme of rivalling Alexander's achievements in the east by winning for himself an empire in the west. He aspired not only to unite under his rule the Greek communities of Italy and Sicily, but to overthrow the great Ph\u0153nician state of Carthage \u2014 the natural enemy of Greeks in the west, as Persia had been in the east. Of Rome it is clear that he knew little or nothing ; the task of ridding the Greek seaports of their barbarian foes he no doubt regarded as an easy one; and the splendid force he brought with him was intended rather for the conquest of the West than for the preliminary work of chastising a few Italian tribes, or securing the submission of the unwarlike Italian Greeks. Pyrrhus' first measure was to place Tarentum under a strict military discipline ; this done he advanced into Lucania to meet the Roman consul L\u00e6vinus. The battle which followed, on the banks of the Liris, ended in the com- plete defeat of the Roman troops, largely owing to the panic caused by the elephants which Pyrrhus had brought with him (280 B.C.).1 The Greek cities expelled 474 a.u.o. their Roman garrisons and joined him, while numerous bands of Samnites, Lucanians, and Bruttians flocked to his standard. But, to the disappointment of his Greek and Italian allies, Pyrrhus showed no anxiety to follow up the advantage he had gained. His heart was set on Sicily and Africa, and his immediate object was to effect such an arrangement with Rome as would at once fulfil the pledges he had given to the Greeks by i Plin., N.

But, though his favourite minister, Cineas, employed all his skill to win the ear of the senate, and, though Pyrrhus himself lent weight to his envoy's words by advancing as near Rome as Anagnia (279 B.C.), nothing could shake the re solution of the senate, and Cineas brought back the reply that the Romans could not treat with Pyrrhus so long as he remained in arms upon Italian soil. Disappointed in his hopes of peace, Pyrrhus in the next year (278 B.C.) turned his forces against the Roman strongholds in Apulia.1 Once more, at Asculum, he routed the legions, but only to find that the indomitable resolution of the enemy was strengthened by defeat. Weary of a struggle which threatened indefinitely to postpone the fulfilment of his dreams of empire, Pyrrhus resolved to quit Italy, and, leaving garrisons in the Greek towns, crossed into Sicily. Here his success at first was such as promised the speedy realisation of his hopes. The Sicilian Greeks hailed him as a deliverer ; the Cartha ginians were driven back to the extreme west of the island, and Eryx and Panormus fell into his hands. But at this point fortune deserted him. His efforts to take Lilyb\u00e6um were fruitless ; the Carthaginians re covered their courage, while the unstable Greeks, easily daunted by the first threatenings of failure, and impatient of the burdens of war, broke out into open murmurs against him. Soured and disappointed, Pyrrhus returned to Italy (276 B.C.) to find the Roman legions steadily moving southwards, and his Italian 1 Plut., Pyrrh., 21."], [107, "Ch. 2.] THE CONQUEST OF ITALY 87 allies disgusted by his desertion of their cause. One of the consuls for the year (275 B.C.), M. Curius Dentatus, 479 a.u.c. the conqueror of Samnium, was encamped at Bene ventum awaiting the arrival of his colleague. Here Pyrrhus attacked him, and the closing battle of the war was fought. It ended in the complete victory of the Romans. Pyrrhus, unable any longer to face his opponents in the field, and disappointed of all assist ance from his allies, retreated in disgust to Tarentum, and thence crossed into Greece.1 A few years later (272 B.C.) Tarentum was sur- 432 a.u.c rendered to Rome by its Epirot garrison ; it was granted a treaty of alliance, but its walls were razed and its fleet handed over to Rome. In 270 B.C. Rhegium also 434 a.u.c entered the ranks of Roman allies, and, finally, in 269 485 a.u.c. B.C. a single campaign crushed the last efforts at resistance in Samnium. Rome was now at leisure to consolidate the position she had won. Between 273 48i,49iA.u.c B.C. and 263 B.C. three new colonies were founded in Samnium and Lucania \u2014 P\u00e6stum in 273 B.C., Bene- 481 a.u.c ventum in 268 B.C., \u00c6sernia in 263 B.C. In central 4S6,491a.u.c Italy the area of Roman territory was increased by the full enfranchisement (268 B.C.) of the Sabines,2 and of 4S0 a.u.c their neighbours to the east, the Picentes. To guard the Adriatic coast colonies were established at Ariminum (268 B.C.), at Firmum, and at Castrum Novum (264 4S6 a.u.c.

Rome was now the undisputed mistress of Italy. The limits of her supremacy to the north were repre sented roughly by a line drawn across the peninsula from the mouth of the Arno on the west to that of the \u00c6sis on the east.1 Beyond this line lay the Ligurians and the Kelts ; all south of it was now united as ' Italy ' under the rule of Rome. But the rule of Rome over Italy, like her wider rule over the Mediterranean coasts, was not an absolute dominion over conquered subjects. It was in form at least a confederacy under Roman protection and guid ance ; and the Italians, like the provincials, were not the subjects, but the 'allies and friends' of the Roman people.2 Marvellous as are the perseverance and skill with which Rome built up, consolidated, and directed this confederacy, it is yet clear that both her success in forming it and its stability when formed were due in part to other causes than Roman valour and policy. The disunion which in former times had so often weakened the Italians in their struggles with Rome still told in her favour, and rendered the danger of a combined revolt against her authority remote in the extreme. In some cases, and especially in the city states of Etruria, Campania, and Magna Gr\u00e6cia, where the antagonism of the two political parties, aristocrats and democrats, was keen, Rome found natural and (Hal.

Among the more back ward peoples of central Italy, the looseness of their political organisation not only lessened their power of resistance, but enabled Rome either to detach tribe after tribe from the confederacy, or to attack and crush them singly. Elsewhere she was aided by ancient feuds, such as those between Samnites and Apulians, or Tarentines and Iapygians, or by the imminent dread of a foe \u2014 Kelt, or Samnite, or Lucanian \u2014 whom Roman aid alone could repel. And, while combination against her was thus rendered difficult, if not impossible, by internal dissensions, feuds, differences of interest, of race, of language, and habits, Rome herself, from her position in the centre of Italy, was so placed as to be able to strike promptly on the first signs of concerted opposition. All these advantages Rome utilised to the utmost. We have no means of deciding how far she applied elsewhere the principle upon which she acted in northern Etruria and Campania, of attaching the aristocratic party in a community to Roman interests, by the grant of special privileges ; but it is certain that she endeavoured by every means in her power to per petuate, and even to increase, the disunion which she had found so useful among her allies. In every possible way she strove to isolate them from each other, while binding them closely to herself. The old federal groups were in most cases broken up, and each of the members united with Rome by a special treaty of alliance.

In many cases, too, no freedom of trade or intermarriage was allowed between the allies themselves, a policy afterwards pursued in the provinces. Nor were all these numerous allied communities placed on the same footing as regarded their relations with Rome herself. To begin with, a sharp distinction was drawn between the 'Latini' and the general mass of Italian allies. The ' Latins ' of this period had little more than the name in common with the old thirty Latin peoples of the days of Spurius Cassius. With a few exceptions, such as Tibur and Pr\u00e6neste, the latter had either dis appeared or had been incorporated with the Roman state, and the Latins of 268 B.C. were almost ex clusively the 'Latin colonies,' that is to say, communi ties founded by Rome, composed of men of Roman blood, and whose only claim to the title ' Latin ' lay in the fact that Rome granted to them some portion of the rights and privileges formerly enjoyed by the old Latin cities under the Cassian treaty.1 Though nominally allies, they were, in fact, offshoots of Rome herself, bound to her by community of race, language, and interest, and planted as Roman garrisons among alien and conquered peoples. The Roman citizen who joined a Latin colony lost his citizenship \u2014 to have allowed him to retain it would no doubt have been 1 For the ' coloni\u00e6 Latin\u00e6 ' founded before the first Punic war, see Beloch, 136 sq."], [111, "Ch. 2.] THE CONQUEST OF ITALY 91 regarded as enlarging too rapidly the limits of the citizen body ; but he received in exchange the status of a favoured ally. The Latin colony did not, indeed, enjoy the equality and independence originally possessed by the old Latin cities. It had no freedom of action outside its own territory, could not make war or peace, and was bound to have the same friends and foes as Rome. But its members had the right of com mercium, and, down to 268 B.C.,1 of connubium also with 486 a.u.c Roman citizens. Provided they left sons and property to represent them at home, they were free to migrate to Rome and acquire the Roman franchise. In war time they not only shared in the booty, but claimed a portion of any land confiscated by Rome and declared ' public' These privileges, coupled with their close natural affinities with Rome, successfully secured the fidelity of the Latin colonies, which became not only the most efficient props of Roman supremacy, but powerful agents in the work of Romanising Italy. Below the privileged Latins stood the Italian allies ; The Italian and here again we know generally that there were a considerable differences of status, determined in each case by the terms of their respective treaties with Rome. We are told that the Greek cities of Neapolis and Heraclea were among the most favoured;2 the Bruttii, on the other hand, seem, even before the Hannibalic war, to have been less generously treated. 1 The year of the foundation of Ariminum, the first Latin colony with the restricted rights; Cic. pro C\u0153c, 35; Mommsen, R.

II. 92 But beyond this the absence of all detailed information does not enable us to go. Rome, however, did not rely only on this policy of isolation. Her allies were attached as closely to herself as they were clearly separated from each other, and from the first she took every security for the mainten ance of her own paramount authority. Within its own borders, each ally was left to manage its own affairs as an independent state.1 The badges which marked sub jection to Rome in the provinces \u2014 the resident magis trate and the tribute \u2014 were unknown in Italy. But in all points affecting the relations of one ally with another, in all questions of the general interests of Italy and of foreign policy, the decision rested solely with Rome. The place of a federal constitution, of a federal council, of federal officers, was filled by the Roman senate, assembly, and magistrates. The main tenance of peace and order in Italy, the defence of the coasts and frontiers, the making of war or peace with foreign powers, were matters the settlement of which Rome kept entirely in her own hands. Each allied state, in time of war, was called upon for a certain contingent of men, but though its contingent usually formed a distinct corps under officers of its own, its numerical strength was fixed by Rome, it was brigaded with the Roman legions, and was under the orders of the Roman consul.2 1 For the relation of the ' socii Italici ' to Rome, see Mommsen, R. G., i. 422 ; Beloch, Hal. Bund, cap. x. 2 Beloch, 203.

Her territory, as distinct from that of the allied states, covered some thing like one-third of the peninsula south of the \u00c6sis. Along the west coast it stretched from C\u00e6re to the southern borders of Campania. Inland, it included the former territories of the \u00c6qui and Hernici, the Sabine country, and even extended eastward into Picenum, while beyond these limits were outlying districts, such as the lands of the Senonian Kelts, with the Roman colony of Sena, and others elsewhere in Italy, which had been confiscated by Rome and given over to Roman settlers. Since the first important annexation of territory after the capture of Veii (396 B.C.), twelve 358 a.u.c new tribes had been formed,1 and the number of male citizens registered at the census had risen from 152,000 to 290,000.2 Within this enlarged Roman state were colonies and now included numerous communities with local in- mumciPia- stitutions and government. At their head stood the Roman colonies ('coloni\u00e6 civium Romanorum'), founded to guard especially the coasts of Latium and Campania.3 Next to these eldest children of Rome i Four in South Etruria (387), two in the Pomptine territory (358), two in Latium (332), two in the territory of the southern Volsci and the Ager Falernus (318), two in the \u00c6quian and Hernican territory (299).

II. came those communities which had been invested with the full Roman franchise, such, for instance, as the old Latin towns of .Aricia, Lanuvium, Tusculum, Nomen tum, and Pedum. Lowest in the scale were those which had not been considered ripe for the full franchise, but had, like C\u00e6re, received instead the 'civitas sine suflragio,' the civil without the political rights.1 Their members, though Roman citizens, were not enrolled in the tribes, and in time of war served not in the ranks of the Roman legions, but in separate contingents. In addition to these organised town communities, there were also the groups of Roman settlers on the public lands, and the dwellers in the village communities of the enfranchised highland dis tricts in central Italy. The administrative needs of this enlarged Rome were obviously such as could not be adequately satisfied by the system which had done well enough for a small city state with a few square miles of territory. The old centralisation of all government in Rome itself had become an impossibility, and the Roman statesmen did their best to meet the altered requirements of the time. The urban communities within the Roman pale, colonies and municipia, were allowed a large measure of local self-government. In all we find local assemblies, senates, and magistrates, to whose hands the ordinary routine of local administration was confided, and, in spite of differences in detail, e.g. in the titles and numbers of the magistrates, the same type of constitu- 1 To both these classes the term ' municipia' was applied."], [115, "Prefects. Ch. 2.] THE CONQUEST OF ITALY 95 tion prevailed throughout.1 But these local authorities were carefully subordinated to the higher powers in Rome. The local constitution could be modified or revoked by the Roman senate and assembly, and the local magistrates, no less than the ordinary members of the community, were subject to the paramount authority of the Roman consuls, pr\u00e6tors, and censors. In particular, care was taken to keep the administra tion of justice well under central control. The Roman citizen in a colony or municipium enjoyed, of course, the right of appeal to the Roman people in a capital case. We may also assume that from the first some limit was placed to the jurisdiction of the local magis trate, and that cases falling outside it came before the central authorities. But an additional safeguard for the equitable and uniform administration of Roman law in communities, to many of which the Roman code was new and unfamiliar, was provided by the institu tion of prefects ('pr\u00e6fecti juri dicundo'),2 who were sent out annually, as representatives of the Roman pr\u00e6tor, to administer justice in the colonies and muni cipia. To prefects was, moreover, assigned the charge of those districts within the Roman pale where no urban communities, and consequently no organised local government, existed. In these two institutions, that of municipal government and that of prefectures, i For details, see Beloch, Hal. Bund, caps, v., vi., vii.

A word must lastly be said of the changes which the altered position and increased responsibilities of Rome had effected in her military system.1 For the most part these changes tended gradually to weaken the old and intimate connection between the Roman army in the field and the Roman people at home, and thus prepared the way for that complete breach between the two which in the end proved fatal to the republic. It is true that service in the legion was still the first duty and the highest privilege of the fully qualified citizen. Every 'assiduus' was still liable to active military service between the ages of seventeen and forty-five, and ' proletarii ' and freedmen were still called out only in great emergencies,2 and then but rarely enrolled in the legions. But this service was gradually altering in character. Though new legions were still raised each year for the summer campaigns, this was by no means always accompanied, as formerly, by the dis bandment of those already on foot, and this increase in the length of time during which the citizen was kept with the standards had, as early as the siege of Veii, necessitated a further deviation from the old theory of military service \u2014 the introduction of pay.3 Hardly less important than these changes were those which had taken place in the organisation of the legion itself. In 1 Mommsen, R. G., i. 438 ; Madvig, Vers. R. Reichs, ii. 467 sq. ; Livy, viii. 8 ; Polybius, vi. 17-42. 2 E.g., before the battle of Sentinum (296), Livy, x. 21. 3 Livy, iv, 59."], [117, "Ch. 2.] THE CONQUEST OF ITALY 97 the early days of the republic the same divisions served for the soldier in the legion and the voter in the assembly. The Roman army in the field, and the Roman people in the comitia on the Campus, were alike grouped according to their wealth, in classes and cen- turi\u00e6. But by the time of the Latin war the arrange- ment of the legion had been altered. In the new manipular system, with its three lines, no regard was paid to civic distinctions, but only to length of service and military efficiency, while at the same time the more open order of fighting which it involved demanded of each soldier greater skill, and therefore a more thorough training in arms than the old phalanx. One other change resulted from the new military neces- The pro- sities of the time, which was as fruitful of results as co the incipient separation between the citizen and the soldier. The citizen soldiers of early Rome were com- manded in the field by the men whom they had chosen to be their chief magistrates at home, and still, except when a dictator was appointed, the chief command of the legions rested with the consuls of the year. But, as Rome's military operations increased in area and in distance from Rome, a larger staff became necessary, and the inconvenience of summoning home a consul in the field from an unfinished campaign became intoler able. The remedy found, that of prolonging for a further period the imperium of the consul, was first applied in 327 B.C. in the case of Q. Publilius Philo,1 427 a.u.c and between 327 and 264 B.C. instances of this 'proro- 427-490 gatio imperii ' became increasingly common.

ROME AND THE MEDITERRANEAN STATES\u2014 265-146 B.C. INTRODUCTION. We have now reached the period during which the Latin community on the banks of the Tiber, already the mistress of Italy, established her suzerainty over the countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea. For the history of this period we are no longer dependent on tradition. The events of the struggle with Carthage, the wars with Macedon, and with Antiochus, the rela tions of Rome with the states of Western Asia, were recorded by contemporary historians, Greek and Roman, and in contemporary official documents. Of these con temporary authorities indeed, only a few fragments are now extant. We cannot read the very words of Fabius Pictor, of L. Cincius Alimentus, the prisoner of Hannibal, or of Hannibal's companion and historiographer, the Greek Silenus, or handle the original text of the treaties with Carthage or Antiochus. But the important fact remains, that it is on these records that our two chief extant authorities, Polybius and Livy, based their"], [120, "100 HISTORY OF ROME [Bk. in. narratives, while of the last thirty years of the period, Polybius himself writes with the authority of a contem porary. The chief interest of the history naturally centres in the great wars which for a hundred years absorbed the energies of Rome. In the internal affairs of the state there is at first sight nothing of striking importance to record. The strain and stress of foreign war left little energy or leisure for political debate, or reforming zeal. The great controversy which had divided men in the previous period was closed ; those which were to divide them in the next had not yet taken definite shape. Yet beneath this outward political calm changes were silently at work of the utmost moment for the future of the state. The Rome which emerged victorious from the conflicts of a century was still, as regarded the form of her political system, a Latin city state, \u2014 in fact, she was an imperial power ruling wide and distant provinces, and with a citizen body scattered over the coasts of the Mediterranean. Nor could the disproportion between the primitive machinery of the old republican constitu tion and the administrative necessities of an empire which stretched from the pillars of Hercules to the river Halys, long escape notice. To these administra tive difficulties were added others, created directly or indirectly by the rapid expansion of Rome during this period ; for this expansion brought with it a revolution in the conditions, habits, and beliefs of Roman society which undermined the very foundations on which the republican system rested. The statesmen of the Grac chan, and still more of the Ciceronian age, had conse-"], [121, "Int.] ROME AND MEDITERRANEAN STATES 101 quently to face the fact that the ancient constitution was almost as ill-suited to the temper and tone of the Eoman people as it was inadequate to the task of governing the civilised world. In the following chapters we shall then, first of all, trace the growth of Eoman dominion outside Italy, and, secondly, consider its effects upon the Eoman state itself."], [122, "489-608 A.V.C. 102 CHAPTEE I. ROME AND CARTHAGE\u2014 THE CONQUEST OF THE WEST. Though marked out by her geographical position as the natural centre of the Mediterranean, Italy had hitherto played no active part in Mediterranean politics, but, now that she was for the first time united, it was felt throughout the Mediterranean world that a new power had arisen, and Eome, as the head and representative of Italy, found herself irresistibly drawn into the vortex of Mediterranean affairs. With those of the eastern Mediterranean, indeed, she was not imme diately called upon to concern herself. Her repulse of Pyrrhus, and the news that the Greek cities of South Italy had acknowledged her suzerainty, had, it is true, suddenly revealed to the Eastern world the existence of a powerful Italian state. Egypt sought her alliance, and Greek scholars began to interest themselves keenly in the history, constitution, and character of the Latin republic which had so suddenly become famous. But this was all, and not until fifty years after the retreat of Pyrrhus did Eome seriously turn her attention east ward. Westward of Italy the case was different. The western coasts of the peninsula were the most fertile, populous, and wealthy; it was westward rather than east ward that the natural openings for Italian commerce were"], [123, "Ch. I.] ROME AND CARTHAGE 103 to be found. But it was precisely on this side that Eome had serious ground for anxiety. The great Ph\u0153nician republic of Carthage was now at the height of her power. To a commercial and maritime supremacy, as great as that of Tyre and Sidon had ever been, she had added a dominion by land, of a kind to which they had never aspired. Not content with her wide and fertile territories in northern Africa, she had planted her feet firmly in Sardinia and Sicily, in close proximity to the shores of Italy, while her fleets swept the seas and jealously guarded for her benefit alone the hidden treasures of the West. In the east of Sicily, Syracuse still upheld the cause of Greek independence against the hereditary foe of the Greek race ; but Syracuse stood alone, and her resources were comparatively small. What Eome had to fear was the establishment, and that at no distant date, of an absolute Cartha- ginian domination over the Western seas \u2014 a domina- tion which would not only be fatal to Italian commerce but would be a standing menace to the safety of the Italian coasts. Eome had indeed long been connected with Carthage by treaty, and the older purely com- mercial treaties had quite recently been replaced by a close alliance formed in face of the common danger to which both had been exposed by the adventurous schemes of Pyrrhus. But this danger was past, and it is probable that others besides Pyrrhus foresaw that on the old battleground of Greeks and Ph\u0153nicians a struggle must soon be fought out between the Ph\u0153ni cian mistress of the Italian seas and the Latin rulers of the Italian peninsula."], [124, "HISTORY OF ROME [Bk. in. 104 First Punic War. 265-241 B.c. 489-513A.U.C. 482 a.u.c. 489 A.u.c. 490 a.u.c It was above all things essential for Eome that the Carthaginians should advance no farther eastward. But already in 272 B.C. Tarentum had almost fallen into their grasp, and seven years later Eome was threatened with a danger at least as serious, the establishment of Carthaginian rule in the east of Sicily, and within sight of the Italian coast. In 265 B.C. a body of Campanian mercenaries, who had seized Messana, found themselves hard pressed by Hiero, king of Syracuse. One party among them appealed for aid to Carthage. The Carthaginians readily responded, and a Cartha ginian garrison occupied the citadel of Messana. But at Messana, as once at Tarentum, there were others who turned to Eome, and, as Italians themselves, implored the aid of the great Italian republic, offering in return to place Messana under the suzerainty of Eome. The request was a perplexing one. Both Hiero and the Carthaginians were allies of Eome, and Messana, if rescued from the latter, belonged of right to Hiero and not to Eome. Apart, too, from treaty obligations, the Eoman senate naturally hesitated be fore acceding to an appeal which would precipitate a collision with Carthage, and commit Eome to a new and hazardous career of enterprise beyond the sea. Finally, however, all other considerations gave way before the paramount importance of checking the advance of Carthage. The Eoman assembly voted that assistance should be sent to the Mamertines, and in 264 B.C. the Eoman legions for the first time crossed the sea. Messana was occupied, and, after sustaining a defeat, the Carthaginians and Syracusans were forced"], [125, "Ch. i.] ROME AND CARTHAGE 105 to raise the siege and withdraw. The opening years of the war which was thus begun gave little promise of the length of the struggle, and it seemed likely at the outset that Eome's immediate object, the expulsion of the Carthaginians from Sicily, would be soon attained. The accession to the Eoman side of King Hiero (263 491 a.k.c. B.C.) not only confirmed the position which Eome had already assumed in Italy of the champion of the western Greeks against barbarians, but provided her in eastern Sicily with a convenient base of operation* and commodious winter quarters, and in Hiero himself with a loyal and effective ally. In the next year (262 492 a.u.c B.C.) followed the capture of Agrigentum, and in 261 B.C. 493 a.u.c the Eoman senate resolved on supplementing these successes on land by the formation of a fleet which The first should not only enable them to attack the maritime strongholds which defied the assaults of their legions, and protect their own coasts, but even to carry the war into Africa itself. In the spring of 260 B.C. the first regular 494 a.u.c Eoman fleet, consisting of one hundred quinqueremes and twenty triremes set sail;1 and the brilliant naval victory off Myl\u00e6, won by the consul C. Duilius in the same year, seemed to promise the Eomans as much success by sea as they had won by land. But the promise was not fulfilled ; and in 256 B.C. the senate, 498 a.u.c impatient of the slow progress made in Sicily, deter- mined on boldly invading Africa.

The passage to Africa was opened by the defeat of the Carthaginian fleet off Ecnomus ; the two consuls, L. Manlius Vulso and M. Atilius Regulus, landed in safety and rapidly overran the country. But these successes led the senate, at the close of the summer, into commit ting the serious blunder of recalling one of the consuls, Manlius, with a large portion of the troops. It was one of many instances in which the rules and traditions of the old republican system proved themselves incon sistent with the new requirements of an extended war fare. The consul came back to hold the elections ; his soldiers returned, as the custom had been, to their homes after a summer's campaign ; but the efficiency of the expedition was fatally impaired. The rashness and over-confidence of Eegulus aggravated the effects of the senate's action. Emboldened by further successes, and notwithstanding his diminished forces, he met the Car thaginian proposals for peace by terms so harsh that the latter, though the Eomans were almost at their gates, their soldiers disheartened, and the nomad tribes swarming on their frontiers, indignantly broke off the negotiations and prepared to resist to the last. At this crisis, so the story runs, the arrival of Xanthippus, a Spartan soldier of fortune, changed the face of affairs, as that of Gylippus had formerly done at Syracuse. His superior military skill remedied the blunders of the Carthaginian generals ; confidence was restored ; and in 255 B.C. he triumphantly routed the Eoman forces a few"], [127, "Ch. I.] ROME AND CARTHAGE 107 miles outside the city. Eegulus was taken prisoner,1 and only a miserable remnant of two thousand men escaped to the Eoman camp on the coast. Here they were rescued by a Eoman fleet, but their ill-fortune pursued them. On its way home the fleet was wrecked, and all but 80 vessels out of a total of 364 were lost. Still, though abandoning the idea of invading Africa, the Eomans were unwilling to renounce all thoughts of facing their enemy on the sea. But fresh disasters followed. The hopes raised (254 B.C.) by the capture soo a.u.c of Panormus were dashed to the ground the next year (253 B.C.) by the total destruction in a storm of the 501 a.u.c victorious fleet on its way home from Panormus to Eome. Four years later a second fleet, despatched under P. Claudius to assist in the blockade of Lilyb\u00e6um, was completely defeated off Drepana, while, to make matters worse, Claudius' colleague L. Junius, who had been hastily sent out with reinforcements, was wrecked near the dangerous promontory of Pachynus. Disheartened by these repeated disasters, the Senate resolved to trust only to the legions, and by sheer force of perseverance slowly to force the enemy out of the few positions to wdiich he still clung in Sicily. But, though for five years (248-243 B.C.) no fresh naval opera- 506-511 tions were attempted, no compensating success by land followed. Hamilcar Barca, the new Carthaginian com mander, not only ravaged with his fleet the coasts of Italy, but from his impregnable position at Ercte inces santly harassed the Eoman troops in the west of the 1 For criticisms of the story of Regulus, see Mommsen, i. 523 ; lime, ii. 69 ; Rauke, Weltgeschichte, ii. 185."], [128, "512 a.u.c.

Convinced once more of the impossibility of driving the Carthaginians out of Sicily as long as their navy swept the seas, the Eomans determined on a final effort. The treasury was empty; but by the liberal contributions of private citizens a fleet was equipped, and C. Lutatius Catulus, consul for 242 B.C., started for Sicily early in the summer of that year with 200 quinqueremes. From Drepana, whither he had gone to aid in the blockade, he sailed out to meet a Carthaginian fleet, despatched from Africa against him; and a battle took place at the \u00c6gates islands, some twenty miles from the Sicilian coast, in which Catulus completely defeated his enemy. The end of the long struggle had come at last. The Carthaginian government, despairing of being able to send further aid to their troops in Sicily, authorised Hamilcar to treat for peace. His proposals were accepted by Catu lus, and the terms agreed upon betw-een them were confirmed in all essential points by the commissioners sent out from Eome. The Carthaginians agreed to evacuate Sicily and the adjoining islands, to restore all prisoners, and to pay an indemnity of 2300 talents. In its duration and its severity the First Punic War is justly ranked by Polybius above all other wars of his own and preceding times, though neither in the military talent displayed nor in the importance of its results can it be compared with the war that followed. It was dis tinguished by no military achievement comparable with Hannibal's invasion of Italy, and with the single excep tion of Hamilcar it produced no general of the calibre of Hannibal or Scipio. It was in fact a struggle in"], [129, "Gh. i.] ROME AND CARTHAGE 109 which both Eome and Carthage were serving an apprenticeship to a warfare the conditions of which were unfamiliar to both. The Eoman legions were foes very unlike any against which the Carthaginian leaders had ever led their motley array of mercenaries, while Eome was called upon for the first time to fight a war across the sea, and to fight with ships against the greatest naval power of the age. The novelty of these conditions accounts for much of the vacillating and uncertain action observable on both sides, and their effect in this direction was increased by the evident doubts felt by both antagonists as to the lengths to which the quarrel should be pushed. It is possible that Hamilcar had already made up his mind that Eome must be attacked and crushed in Italy, but his government attempted nothing more than raids upon the coast. There are indications also that some in the Eoman senate saw no end to the struggle but in the destruction of Carthage ; yet an invasion of Africa was only once seriously attempted, and then only a half hearted support was given to the expedition. But these peculiarities in the war served to bring out in the clearest relief the strength and the weakness of the two contending states. The chief dangers for Carthage lay obviously in the jealousy exhibited at home of her officers abroad, in the difficulty of controlling her mer cenary troops, and in the ever-present possibility of dis affection among her subjects in Libya, \u2014 dangers which even the genius of Hannibal failed finally to surmount. Eome, on the other hand, was strong in the public spirit of her citizens, the fidelity of her allies, the valour and"], [130, "110 HISTORY OF ROME [Bk. in. discipline of her legions. What she needed was a system which should make a better use of her splendid materials than one under which her plans were shaped from day to day by a divided senate, and executed by officers who were changed every year, and by soldiers most of whom returned home at the close of each summer's campaign. The interval between the First and Second Punic Wars was employed by both Eome and Carthage in strengthening their respective positions. Of the islands lying off the coast of Italy, the most important, Sicily, had fallen to Eome as the prize of the recent war. The eastern end of the island was still left under the rule of King Hiero as the ally of Eome, but the larger western portion became directly subject to Eome, and a tempo rary arrangement seems to have been made for its government, either by one of the two pr\u00e6tors, or possibly by a qu\u00e6stor.1 Sardinia and Corsica had not been surrendered to Eome by the treaty of 241 B.C., but three years later (238 B.C.), on the invitation of the Car thaginian mercenaries stationed in the islands, a Eoman force occupied them ; Carthage protested, but, on the Eomans threatening war, she gave way, and Sardinia and Corsica were formally ceded to Eome, though it was some seven or eight years before all resistance on the part of the natives themselves was crushed. In 227 B.C., however, the senate considered matters ripe for the establishment of a separate and settled government, not only in Sardinia and Corsica, but also in Sicily.

Of at least equal importance for the security of the penin sula was the subjugation of the Keltic tribes in the valley of the Po. These, headed by the Boii and In- Subjugation subres, and assisted by levies from the Kelts to the and insubres westward, had in 225 B.C. alarmed the whole of Italy 529 lux.

Thus hemmed in the Kelts fought desperately, but were completely defeated and the flower of their tribesmen slain. The Eomans followed up their success by invading the Keltic territory. The Boii were easily reduced to submission. The Insubres, north of the Po, resisted more obstinately, but by 222 B.C. the war was over, and all the tribes in 532a.u.c the rich Po valley acknowledged the supremacy of Eome. The conquered Kelts were not enrolled among the Italian allies of Eome, but were treated as subjects beyond the frontier. Three colonies were founded to hold them in check \u2014 Placentia and Cremona in the territory of the Insubres, Mutina in that of the Boii ; and the great northern road (Via Flaminia) was com- The via Fia- . minia. pleted as far as the Keltic border at Arimmum. 1 Livy, Epit. xx."], [132, "HISTORY OF ROME [Bk. in. 112 Chastise. ment of the Illyrian pirates.

On the Adriatic coast, where there was no Carthage to be feared, and no important adjacent islands to be annexed, the immediate interests of Eome were limited to rendering the sea safe for Italian trade. It was with this object that, in 229 B.C., the first Eoman expedition crossed the Adriatic, and inflicted severe chastisement on the Illyrian pirates of the opposite coast.1 But the results of the expeditiou did not end here, for it was the means of establishing for the first time direct politi cal relations between Eome and the states of Greece proper, to many of which the suppression of piracy in the Adriatic was of as much importance as to Eome herself. Alliances were concluded with Corcyra, Epid amnus, and Apollonia ; and embassies explaining the reasons which had brought Eoman troops into Greece were sent to the \u00c6tolians, the Ach\u00e6ans, and even to Athens and Corinth. Everywhere they were well re ceived, and the admission of the Eomans to the Isthmian games2 (228 B.C.) formally acknowledged them as the natural allies of the free Greek states against both bar barian tribes and foreign despots, a relationship which was destined to prove as useful to Eome in the East as it had already proved itself to be in the West. While Eome was thus fortifying herself on all sides, Carthage had acquired a possession which promised to compensate her for the loss of Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica. The genius of her greatest citizen and soldier, Hamilcar Barca, had appreciated the enormous value of the Spanish peninsula, and conceived the scheme of founding there a Carthaginian dominion which should 1 Polyb., ii. 8 sq. = Polyb., ii. 12."], [133, "Gli. i.] ROME AND CARTHAGE 113 not only add to the wealth of Carthage, but supply her with troops, and with a base of operations for that war of revenge with Eome on which his heart was set. The conquest of southern and eastern Spain, begun by Ham- ilcar (236-228 B.C.), and carried on by his kinsman Has- 518-526 A.U.C drubal (228-221 B.C.), was completed by his son Hannibal, 526-533 who, with all his father's genius, inherited also his father's hatred of Eome, and by 219 B.C. the authority of 535 a.u.c Carthage had been extended as far as the Ebro. Eome had not watched this rapid advance without anxiety, but, probably owing to her troubles with the Kelts, she had contented herself with stipulating (226 B.C.) that Car- 528 a.u.c thage should not carry her arms beyond the Ebro, so as to threaten Eome's ancient ally, the Greek colony Mas silia, and with securing the independence of the two nominally Greek communities, Empori\u00e6 and Saguntum,1 on the east coast. But these precautions were of no avail against the resolute determination of Hannibal, with whom the conquest of Spain was only preliminary to an attack upon Italy, and who could not afford to leave behind him in Spain a state allied to Eome. In 219 B.C., there- 535 a.u.c. fore, disregarding the protests of a Eoman embassy, he attacked and took Saguntum, an act which, as he had foreseen, rendered a rupture with Eome inevitable, while it set his own hands free for a further advance.

II"], [134, "536 A.u.c. Hannibal invades Italy. 114 HISTORY OF ROME [Book in. would have given them a convenient point of support ; and to this hope they clung even after Saguntum was lost. In 218 B.C., the first year of the war, one consul, P. Cornelius Scipio, was despatched to Spain, and the other, T. Sempronius Gracchus, to Sicily, and thence to .Africa. But Hannibal's secrecy and promptitude baffled all their calculations. Leaving New Carthage early in 218 B.C., in the space of five months he crossed the Pyrenees, reached the Ehone just as Scipio arrived at Massilia on his way to Spain, passed the Alps in spite of endless difficulties and hardships, and startled Italy by descending into the plains of Cisalpine Gaul. In two battles on the Ticinus and the Trebia he defeated the forces hastily collected to bar his progress south wards ; the Keltic tribes rallied to his standard ; and at the beginning of the next year he prepared to realise the dream of his life and carry fire and sword into Italy itself. His own force numbered 26,000 men ; the total available strength of Eome and her allies was estimated at over 700,000.1 But Hannibal's hope lay in the possi bility that by the rapidity of his movements he might be able to strike a decisive blow before Eome could mobilise her levies, or get her somewhat cumbrous military machinery into w-orking order. From a first success he expected no less a result than the break up of the Roman confederacy, and the isolation of Rome herself, while it would also increase the readiness of his own government to render him effective support. i Polybius (ii. 24 sq.) enumerates the forces of Rome and her allies at the time of the Keltic invasion of 225.

Except, however, in South Italy, his brilliant victories and dashing marches brought him no allies, and it was his inability to shake the loyalty of northern and central Italy and of the Latin colonies everywhere, even more than the indomitable perseverance of Rome and the supineness of Carthage, which caused his ultimate failure. In the spring of 217 B.C. Hannibal crossed the Apen- Battle at the nines and marched southwards through the lowlands of Lake. eastern Etruria, the route taken before him by the Keltic hordes. In April he annihilated Flaminius and his army at the Trasimene Lake,1 and pushed on to Spoletium, only a few days' march from Eome. But Eome was not yet his goal ; from Spoletium, which had closed its gates against him, he moved rapidly eastward, ravaging the territories of Eoman allies as he -went, till he reached the Adriatic and the fertile lands of northern Apulia, where supplies and especially remounts for his Numidian cavalry 2 were plentiful, communication with Carthage easy, and where, moreover, he was well placed for testing the fidelity of the most recent and the least trustworthy of the Italian allies of Eome. A second victory here, on the scale of that at the Trasimene Lake, might be the signal for a general revolt against Eoman rule. It was not, however, until the summer of the next year that his opportunity came. The patient 1 For the date see Ovid, Fast., vi. 765 ; Weissenborn on Livy, xxii. 5 ; Mommsen, R. <?., i. 594. 2 Livy, xxiv. 20. 2 Livy, xxiv. 20."], [136, "116 HISTORY OF ROME [Book in.

The result realised for the moment Hannibal's highest hopes. The Eoman army was annihilated at Cann\u00e6 ; and South Italy, with the exception of the Latin colonies and the Greek cities on the coast, came over to his side. Nor did the Eoman misfortunes end here. Philip of Macedon concluded an alliance with Hannibal 539 a.u.c (215 B.C.), and threatened an invasion of Italy. In the very next year Syracuse, no longer ruled by the faithful Hiero, revolted, and a Carthaginian force landed in 542a.u.c Sicily; lastly, in 212 B.C., came the loss of the Greek cities on the south coast. But the truth of Polybius's remark that the Eomans are most to be feared when their danger is greatest w-as never better illustrated than by their conduct in the face of these accumulated disasters. Patiently and undauntedly they set themselves to regain the ground they had lost. Philip of Macedon was first of all forced to retire from the allied city of Apollonia 540 a.u.c. which he had attacked (214 B.C.), and then effectually diverted from all thoughts of an attack on Italy by the formation of a coalition against him in Greece itself (211 siege and re- B.C.) ; Syracuse was recaptured in 212 B.C., after a length y syracuse. siege, and Eoman authority re-established in Sicily.

I.] THE SECOND PUNIC WAR 117 The imminent danger of this town, which he had named as the successor of Rome in the headship of Italy, re called Hannibal from the south, where he was besieging a Roman garrison in the citadel of Tarentum. Failing to break through the lines which enclosed it, he resolved, as a last hope of diverting the Roman legions from the devoted city, to advance on Rome itself. But his march, deeply as it impressed the imagination of his contemporaries by its audacity and promptitude, was without result. Silently and rapidly he moved along the course of the Latin Way, through the heart of the territory of Rome, to within three miles of the city, and even rode up with his advanced guard to the Colline gate. Yet no ally joined him ; no Roman force was recalled to face him ; no proposals for peace reached his camp ; and, overcome, it is said, by the unmoved con fidence of his foe, he withdrew, as silently and rapidly as he had advanced, to his headquarters in the south. The fall of Capua followed inevitably (211 B.C.),1 and the Recovery of Capua. Roman senate saw with relief the seat of war removed to 543 a.u.c Lucania and Bruttium, and a prospect opening of some relief from the exhausting exertions of the last five years. Their hopes were quickly dashed to the ground. The faithful Massiliots sent word that Hasdrubal, beaten Defeat of Hasdrubal at in Spain, was marching to join Hannibal in Itaty. The thenverjie anxiety at Rome was intense, and every nerve was strained to prevent the junction of the two brothers. Equally great was the relief when the news arrived that 1 Livy, xxvi. 16, 33, gives the sentence passed on Capua : ' Ager omnis et tecta publica P.

The senate hesitated. Many were jealous of Scipio's fame, and resented his scarcely con cealed intention of appealing to the people, should the senate decline his proposals. Others, like the veteran Q. Fabius, thought the attempt hazardous, with exhausted resources, and while Hannibal was still on Italian soil. But Scipio gained the day.

Ih 551 a.u.c. 203 B.C. he twice defeated the Carthaginian forces, and"], [139, "Ch. i.] THE SECOND PUNIC WAR 119 a large party at Carthage were anxious to accept his offer of negotiations. But the advocates of resistance triumphed. Hannibal was recalled from Italy, and with him his brother Mago, who had made a last desper ate attempt to create a diversion in Italy by landing in Liguria. Mago died on the voyage, but Hannibal returned to fight his last battle against Eome at Zama, Battle of where Scipio, who had been continued in command as proconsul for 202 B.C. by a special vote of the people, won 552 a.u.c. a complete victory. The war was over. The Eoman assembly gladly voted that the Carthaginian request for peace should be granted, and intrusted the settle ment of the terms to its favourite Scipio and a com mission of ten senators. Carthage was allowed to retain her own territory in Africa intact ; but she under took to wage no wars outside Africa, and none inside without the consent of Eome. She surrendered all her ships but ten triremes, her elephants, and all prisoners of war. Finally she agreed to pay an indemnity of 10,000 talents in fifty years. Masinissa was rewarded by an increase of territory, and was enrolled among the 'allies and friends' of the Eoman people.1 The battle of Zama decided the fate of the West. The west underRoman The power of Carthage was broken, and her supremacy rule. passed by the right of conquest to Eome. Henceforth Eome had no rival to fear westward of Italy, and it rested with herself to settle within what limits her supremacy should be confined, and what form it should take. The answer to both these questions was largely determined for her by circumstances. For the next iLivy, xxx. 43; Polyb., xv. 18."], [140, "629 a.u.c.

But within this area considerable advance was made in the organisation and consolidation of her rule. The rate of progress was indeed unequal. In the case of Sicily and Spain, the immediate establishment of a Eoman government was imperatively necessary, if these possessions were not either to fall a prey to internal anarchy, or be re covered for Carthage by some second Hamilcar. Ac cordingly, we find that in Sicily the former dominions of Hiero were at once united with the western half of the island as a single province, under the rule of a Eoman pr\u00e6tor (201 B.C.),1 and that in Spain, after nine years of a provisional government (206-197 B.C.), two pro vinces were in 197 B.C.2 definitely established, and each, like Sicily, assigned to one of the pr\u00e6tors for the year, two additional pr\u00e6tors being elected for the purpose. But here the resemblance between the two cases ends. From 201 B.C. down to the outbreak of the Slave War in 136 B.C. there was unbroken peace in Sicily, and its part in the history is limited to its important functions in supplying Eome with corn and in provisioning and cloth ing the Eoman legions.3 It became every year a more 1 Livy, xxvi. 40.

The governors of the two Spains had very different work to do from that which fell to the lot of the Sicilian pr\u00e6tors. Although the coast towns readily acquiesced in Eoman rule, the rest- less and warlike tribes of the interior were in a constant state of ferment, which from time to time broke out into open revolt. In Sicily the ordinary pr\u00e6torian authority, with at most a few cohorts, was sufficient, but the condition of Spain required that year after year the pr\u00e6tor should be armed with the consular authority, and backed by a standing force of four legions, while more than once the presence of the consuls themselves was found necessary. Still, in spite of all difficulties, the work of pacification proceeded. To the elder Cato (consul 195 B.C.), and to Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus 559 a.u.c (pr\u00e6tor and propr\u00e6tor 180-179 B.C.), father of the two 574-575 A.U.O. tribunes, is mainly due the credit of quieting the Celti- berian tribes of central Spain, and the government of Gracchus was followed by thirty years of comparative tranquillity. The insurrection headed by Viriathus in 149 B.C. was largely caused by the exactions of the Eoman 605 a.u.c magistrates themselves, while its obstinate continuance down to the capture of Numantia in 133 B.C., was almost 621 a.u.c as much the result of the incapacity of the Eoman com manders. But the re-settlement of the country by Scipio Africanus the younger in that year left all Spain, with the exception of the highland Assures and Cantabri in the north-west, finally and tranquilly subject to Eome. Meanwhile the disturbed state of the interior had not"], [142, "Africa- Third Punic War. 153-146 B.C. =608 A.u.c, 559 A.U.C 571 A.u.c. 122 HISTORY OF ROME [Book m. prevented the spread of Eoman civilisation on the sea board. Eoman traders and speculators flocked to the seaport towns and spread inland. The mines became centres of Eoman industry; the Eoman legionaries quartered in Spain year after year married Spanish wives, and when their service was over gladly settled down in Spain, in preference to returning to Italy. The first Eoman communities established outside Italy were both planted in Spain, and both owed their existence to the Eoman legions.1 Spain even in 133 B.C. gave promise of becoming in time ' more Eoman than Eome itself.' In Africa there was no question at first of the intro duction of Roman government by the formation of a province. Carthage, bound hand and foot by the treaty of 201 B.C., was placed under the jealous watch of the loyal prince of Numidia, who himself willingly acknowledged the suzerainty of Rome. But it was impossible for this arrangement to be permanent. Every symptom of re viving prosperity at Carthage was regarded at Rome with feverish anxiety, and neither the expulsion of Han nibal in 195 B.C. nor his death in 183 B.C. did much to check the growing conviction that Rome would never be secure while her rival existed. It was therefore with grim satisfaction that many in the Roman senate watched the increasing irritation of the Carthaginians under the harassing raids and encroachments of their favoured neighbour Masinissa, and waited for the moment when Carthage should, by some breach of the conditions imposed upon her, supply Rome with a pre- i Italics (206), Appian, Tier., 38 ; Carteia (171), Livy, xliii. 3."], [143, "Gh. i.] THE THIRD PUNIC WAR 123 text for interference. At last in 151 B.C. came the news 603 a.u.c that Carthage, in defiance of treaty obligations, was actually at war with Masinissa. The anti-Carthaginian party in the senate, headed by M. Porcius Cato, eagerly seized the opportunity, in spite of the protests of Scipio Nasica and others, war was declared, and nothing short of the destruction of their city itself was de manded from the despairing Carthaginians. This de mand, as the senate no doubt foresaw, was refused, and in 149 B.C. the siege of Carthage began. During the next two years little progress was made, but in 147 P. 607 a.u.c Cornelius Scipio \u00c6milianus, son of L. \u00c6milius Paulus, conqueror of Macedonia, and grandson by adoption of the conqueror of Hannibal, was, at the age of thirty seven, and though only a candidate for the \u00e6dileship, elected consul, and given the command in Africa. In the next year (146 B.C.) Carthage was taken and razed to eos a.u.c the ground. Its territory became the Roman province of Africa, while Numidia, now ruled by the three sons of Masinissa, remained as an allied state under Roman suzerainty, and served to protect the new province against the raids of the desert tribes. Within little more than a century from the commencement of the First Punic War, the whole of the former dominions of Carthage had been brought under the direct rule of Roman magistrates, and were regularly organised as Roman provinces. In Italy itself the Hannibalic war was inevitably Italy. followed by important changes, and these changes were naturally enough in the direction of an increased Roman predominance.

Cispadane Gaul, studded with colonies, and flooded with Roman settlers, was rapidly Romanised. Beyond the Po in Polybius's time, about sixty years after the Hannibalic war, Roman civilisation was already widely spread. In the extreme north-east the Latin colony of Aquileia, the last of its kind, was founded in 181 B.C., to hold in check the Alpine tribes, while in the north-west the Ligurians, though not finally subdued until a later time, were held in check by the colony of Luna (180 B.C.), and by the exten sive settlements of Roman citizens and Latins made on Ligurian territory in 173 B.C.1 In southern Italy the effects of the war were not less marked. The depres sion of the Greek cities on the coast, begun by the raids of the Sabellian tribes, was completed by the re peated blows inflicted upon them during the Hannibalic struggle. Some of them lost territory;2 all suffered from a decline of population and loss of trade ; and their place was taken by such new Roman settlements as Brundusium and Puteoli.3 In the interior the southern Sabellian tribes suffered scarcely less severely. The Bruttii were struck off the list of Roman allies, and nearly all their territory was confiscated.4 To the Apulians and Lucanians no such hard measure was 1 Livy, xlii. 4. 2 E.g., Tarentum, Livy, xliv. 16.

It was indeed in central Italy, the home of the Latins and their nearest kinsmen, and in the new Latin and Roman settlements throughout the peninsula, that progress and activity were henceforth concentrated, and even within this area the Eoman, and not the strictly Latin, element tended to preponderate.

ROME AND THE EAST \u2014 200-133 B.C. Ever since the repulse of Pyrrhus from Italy, Eome had been slowly drifting into closer contact with the Eastern states. With one of the three great powers which had divided between them the empire of Alex ander, with Egypt, she had formed an alliance in 273 B.C., and the alliance had been cemented by the growth of commercial intercourse between the two countries.1 In 228 B.C. her chastisement of the Illyrian pirates had led naturally enough to the establishment of friendly relations with some of the states of Greece proper. Fur ther than this, Eome for the time showed no desire to go. The connections already formed were sufficient to open the eastern ports to her trade, and the engross ing struggle with Carthage left her neither leisure nor strength for active interference in the incessant feuds and rivalries which had made up Eastern politics since the falling asunder of Alexander's empire. In 214 B.C. the alliance between Philip and Hannibal, and the former's threatened attack on Italy, forced her into war with Macedon ; but even then she contented herself with head ing a coalition of the Greek states against him, which 1 Egypt had supplied corn to Italy during the Second Punic War (Polyb., ix. 44)."], [147, "Ch. 2.] ROME AND THE EAST 127 effectually frustrated his designs against herself ; and at the first opportunity (205 B.C.) she ended the war by a 549 a.u.c peace which left the position unchanged. Yet the war had important consequences ; it not only drew closer the ties which bound Eome to the Greek states, but inspired the senate with a genuine dread of Philip's restless ambition, and with a bitter resentment against him for his union with Hannibal. The events of the next four years served to deepen both these feelings. In 205 B.C. 549 a.u.c Philip entered into a compact with Antiochus of Syria for the partition between them of the dominions of Egypt,1 now left by the death of Ptolemy Philopator to the rule of a boy king. Antiochus was to take C\u0153le- Syria and Ph\u0153nicia, while Philip claimed for his share the districts subject to Egypt on the coasts of the -\u00c6gean and the Greek islands. Philip no doubt hoped to be able to secure these unlawful acquisitions before the close of the Second Punic War should set Eome free to interfere with his plans. But the obstinate resistance offered by Attalus of Pergamum and the Ehodians up set his calculations. In 201 B.C. Eome made peace with 553 a.u.c. Carthage, and the senate had leisure to listen to the urgent appeal for assistance which reached her from her Eastern allies. With Antiochus, indeed, the senate was not yet prepared to quarrel ; and though Egypt was assured of the continued friendship of Eome, Antiochus was allowed to work his will in C\u0153le-Syria.2 With Philip it is clear that the senate had no thoughts of a peaceful settlement. Their animosity against him had been deepened by the assistance he had recently rendered 1 Polyb., iii. 2, xv. 20 ; Livy, xxxi. 14. 2Livy, xxxiii. 19."], [148, "554 a.u.c.

Always an unsafe and turbulent neigh- bour, he would, if allowed to become supreme in the \u00c6gean, prove as dangerous to her interests in the East as Carthage had been in the West; nor, lastly, could Eome, in honour, look quietly on at the ill-treat- ment of states which, as Greeks and as allies of her own, had a double claim on her protection. To cripple, or at least to stay the growth of Philip's power was in the eyes of the senate a necessity ; but it w7as only by representing a Macedonian invasion of Italy as immi nent that they persuaded the assembly, which was longing for peace, to pass a declaration of war J (200 B.C.), an ostensible pretext for which was found in the invasion by Macedonian troops of the territory of Eome's ally, Athens. The war commenced in the summer of 200 B.C. ; and, though the landing of the Eoman legions in Epirus was not followed, as had been hoped, by any general rising against Philip, yet the latter had soon to discover that his allies, if they were not enthusiastic for Eome, were still less inclined actively to assist himself. Neither by force nor diplomacy could he make any progress south of B\u0153otia. The fleets of Pergamum and Ehodes, now the zealous allies of Eome, protected Attica and watched the eastern coasts. The Ach\u00e6ans and Nabis of Sparta were obstinately neutral, while nearer home in the north the Epirots and \u00c6tolians threatened Thessaly and Macedonia. His own resources both in men and in money had been severely strained by his constant wars,2 and the only ally who could have given him 1 Livy, xxxi. 6, 7. 2 Livy, xxxiii. 3."], [149, "Ch. 2.] ROME AND THE EAST 129 effective assistance, Antiochus, was fully occupied with the conquest of C\u0153le-Syria. It is no wonder then that, in spite of his dashing generalship and high courage, he made but a brief stand. T. Quinctius Flamininus (consul 198 B.C.), in his first year of command, defeated 556 a.u.c him on the Aous, drove him back to the pass of Tempe, and in the next year utterly routed him at Cynosce- phal\u00e6. Almost at the same moment the Ach\u00e6ans, who had now joined Rome, took Corinth, and the Rhodians defeated his troops in Caria.1 Further resistance was impossible ; Philip submitted, and early the next year a Roman commission reached Greece with instructions to arrange terms of peace. These were such as effectu- ally secured Rome's main object in the war, the removal of all danger to herself and her allies from Macedonian aggression.2 Philip was left in possession of his king- dom, but was degraded to the rank of a second-rate power, deprived of all possessions in Greece, Thrace, and Asia Minor, and forbidden, as Carthage had been in 201 B.C., to wage war without the consent of Rome, 553 a.u.c whose ally and friend he now became. Macedon thus weakened could no longer be formidable, but might yet be useful, not only as a barrier against Thracians and Kelts,3 but as a check upon anti-Roman intrigues in Greece. The second point in the settlement now effected by The libera Rome was the liberation of the Greeks. The ' freedom (jreece, of Greece ' was proclaimed at the Isthmian games amid an outburst of enthusiasm,4 which reached its height 1 Livy, xxxiii. 17. 2 Polyb., xviii. 44-47; Livy, xxxiii. 30-34. a Polyb., xviii. 37. 4 Livy, xxxiii. 32, 33.

Flamininus with drew his troops from the 'three fetters of Greece' \u2014 Chalcis, Demetrias, and Corinth.1 There is no reason to doubt that, in acting thus, not only Flamininus him self, but the senate and people at home, were influenced, partly at any rate, by feelings of genuine sympathy with the Greeks and reverence for their past. It is equally clear that no other course was open to them. For Rome to have annexed Greece, as she had annexed Sicily and Spain, would have been a flagrant violation of the pledges she had repeatedly given both before and during the war ; the attempt would have excited the fiercest opposition, and would probably have thrown the Asiatic as well as the European Greeks into the arms of Antiochus. But a friendly and independent Greece would be at once a check on Macedon, a barrier against aggression from the East, and a promising field for Roman commerce. Nor while liberating the Greeks did Rome abstain from such arrangements as seemed necessary to secure the predominance of her own influ ence. In the Peloponnese, for instance, the Ach\u00e6ans were rewarded by considerable accessions of territory ; and it is possible that the Greek states, as allies of Eome, were expected to refrain from war upon each other without her consent. The failure of the policy, after all, was due to the impracticability of the Greeks, and the intensity of their civic and tribal feuds.

Egypt, returned from the conquest of C\u0153le Syria (198 562-565a.u.c B.C.) to learn first of all that Philip was hard pressed 556 a.u.c. by the Eomans, and shortly afterwards that he had been decisively beaten at Cynoscephal\u00e6. It was already too late to assist his former ally, but Antiochus resolved at any rate to lose no time in securing for himself the possessions of the Ptolemies in Asia Minor and in eastern Thrace, which Philip had claimed, and which Eome now pronounced free and independent. In 197- 196 B.C. he overran Asia Minor and crossed into Thrace.2 557-558 A.U.C But Antiochus was pleasure-loving, irresolute, and above all no general, and it was not until 192 B.C. that the562A.u.c urgent entreaties of the \u00c6tolians, and the withdrawal of the Eoman troops from Greece, nerved him to the decisive step of crossing the \u00c6gean ; and even then the force he took with him was so small as to show that he completely failed to appreciate the nature of the task before him.3 At Eome the prospect of a conflict with Antiochus excited great anxiety, and it was not until every resource of diplomacy had been exhausted that war was declared.4 At a distance, indeed, Antiochus, the great king, the lord of all the forces of Asia, seemed an infinitely more formidable opponent than their better- 1 For the conflicting views of moderns on the action of Rome, see Mommsen, R.

War, however, was un avoidable, unless Eome was to desert her Greek allies, and allow Antiochus to advance unopposed to the coasts of the Adriatic. And the war had no sooner commenced than the real weakness which lay behind the magnificent pretensions of the ' king of kings ' was revealed. Had Antiochus acted with energy wdien in 192 B.C. he landed in Greece, he might have won the day before the Eoman legions appeared. As it was, in spite of the warnings of Hannibal,1 who was now in his camp, and of the \u00c6tolians, he frittered away valuable time be tween his pleasures at Chalcis and useless attacks on petty Thessalian towns. In 191 B.C. Glabrio landed at the head of an imposing force ; and a single battle at Thermopyl\u00e6 broke the courage of Antiochus, who hastily recrossed the sea to Ephesus, leaving his \u00c6tolian allies to their fate. But Eome could not pause here. The safety of her faithful allies, the Pergamenes and Ehodians, and of the Greek cities in Asia Minor, as well as the necessity of chastising Antiochus, demanded an invasion of Asia. A Eoman fleet had already (191 B.C.) crossed the \u00c6gean, and in concert with the fleets of Pergamum and Ehodes worsted the navy of Antiochus. In 190 B.C. the new consul, L. Scipio, accompanied by his famous brother, the conqueror of Hannibal, led the Eoman legions for the first time intp Asia. At Magnesia, near Mount Sipylus in Lydia, he met and defeated the motley and ill-disciplined hosts of the 1 Livy xxxvi. 11."], [153, "Ch. 2.] ROME AND THE EAST 133 great king.1 For the first time the West, under Eoman leadership, successfully encountered the forces of the East, and the struggle began which lasted far on into the days of the emperors. The terms of the peace settlement which followed the victory at Magnesia tell their own story clearly enough. There was no question, any more than in Greece, of annexation ; the main object in view was that of securing the predominance of Eoman interests and influence throughout the peninsula of Asia Minor, and removing to a safe distance the only Eastern power which could be considered dangerous.2 The line of the Halys and the Taurus range, the natural boundaries of the peninsula eastward, was established as the boundary between Antiochus and the kingdoms, cities, and peoples now enrolled as the allies and friends of Eome. This line Antiochus was forbidden to cross ; nor was he to send ships of war farther west than Cape Sarpe don in Cilicia. Immediately to the west of this frontier lay the small states of Bithynia and Paphlagonia and the immigrant Keltic Galat\u00e6, and these frontier states, now the allies of Eome, served as a second line of defence against attacks from the east. The area lying between these ' buffer states ' and the \u00c6gean was organised by Eome in such a way as should at once re ward the fidelity of her allies and secure both her own paramount authority and her safety from foreign attack. Pergamum and Ehodes were so strengthened \u2014 the former by the gift of the Chersonese, Lycaonia, Phrygia, Mysia, and Lydia, the latter by that of Lycia and Caria 1 Livy (xxxvii. 40) describes the composition of Antiochus's army. 2 Livy, xxxvii. 55, xxxviii. 38 ; Polyb., xxi. 17."], [154, "HISTORY OF ROME [Book in. 134 554-565 A.U.C.

Lastly, the Greek cities on the coast, except those already tributary to Pergamum, were declared free, and established as independent allies of Eome. In a space of little over eleven years (200-189 B.C.) Eome had broken the power of Alexander's successors and established throughout the eastern Mediterranean a Eoman protectorate. It remained to be seen whether this protectorate could be maintained, or whether Eome would be driven to that policy of annexation which she had adopted from the first in Sicily and Spain. It was in the western half of the protectorate in European Greece that the first steps in the direction of annexation were taken. The enthusiasm provoked by the liberation of the Greeks had died away, and its place had been taken by feelings of dissatisfied ambi tion or sullen resentment. Internecine feuds and eco nomic distress had brought many parts of Greece to the verge of anarchy, and, above all, the very foundations of the settlement effected in 197 B.C. were threatened by the reviving power and aspirations of Macedon. Loyally as Philip had aided Eome in the war with Antiochus, the peace of Magnesia brought him nothing but fresh humiliation. He was forced to abandon all hopes of recovering Thessaly, and he had the mortifi cation to see the hated king of Pergamum installed almost on his borders as master of the Thracian Cher sonese. Eesistance at the time was unavailing, but from"], [155, "Ch. 2.] ROME AND THE EAST 135 189 B.C. until his death (179 B.C.) he laboured patiently 565-575 and quietly to increase the internal resources of his own A'uc' kingdom,1 and to foment, by dexterous intrigue, feel ings of hostility to Eome among his Greek and bar barian neighbours. His successor, Perseus, his son by a left-handed alliance, continued his father's work. He made friends among the Illyrian and Thracian princes, connected himself by marriage with Antiochus IV. of Syria and with Prusias of Bithynia, and, among the Greek peoples, strove, not without success, to revive the memories of the past glories of Greece under the Macedonian leadership of the great Alexander.2 The senate could no longer hesitate. They were well aware of the restlessness and discontent in Greece ; and after hearing from Eumenes of Pergamum, and from their own officers, all details of Perseus's intrigues and pre parations they declared war.3 The struggle, in spite of PersBus's courage and the incapacity at the outset of the Roman commanders, was short and decisive. The sympathy of the Greeks with Perseus, which had been encouraged by the hitherto passive attitude assumed by Rome, instantly evaporated on the news that the Roman legions were on their way to Greece. No assistance came from Prusias or Antiochus, and Perseus's only allies were the Thracian king Cotys and the Illyrian Genthius. The victory gained by L. \u00c6milius Paullus at Pydna (168 B.C.) ended the war.4 Perseus became the 586 a.u.c prisoner of Rome, and as such died in Italy a few years 1 Livy, xxxix. 24 sq. 3 Livy, xlii. 19, 36. 2 Livy, xlii. 5. 4 Livy, xliv. 36-41 ; Plut., \u00c6mil., 15 sq."], [156, "605-608 A.U.C Macedonia a Roman pro vince. 608 A.U.C.

Perseus's repeated proposals for peace during the war had been rejected ; and his defeat was followed by the final extinction of the kingdom of Philip and Alexander.2 Yet Macedonia, though it ceased to exist as a single state, was not definitely consti tuted a Roman province.3 On the contrary, the mistake was made of introducing some of the main principles of the provincial system \u2014 taxation, disarmament, and the isolation of the separate communities \u2014 without the addition of the element most essential for the main tenance of order \u2014 that of a resident Roman governor. The four petty republics now created were each auto nomous, and each separated from the rest by the pro hibition of commercium and connubium, but no central controlling authority was substituted for that of the Macedonian king. The inevitable result was confusion and disorder, resulting finally (149-146 B.C.) in the attempt of a pretender, Andriseus, who claimed to be a son of Perseus, to resuscitate the ancient monarchy.4 On his defeat in 146 B.C. the senate hesitated no longer, and Macedonia became a Roman province, with a Roman magistrate at its head.6 The results of the protectorate in Greece, if less dangerous to Roman supremacy, were quite as unfav- 1 Diod., xxxi. 9; Livy, xlv. 42; Polyb., xxxvii. 16. 2 Livy, xlv. 9. 3 Livy, xlv. 17, 29 ; Plut , \u00c6mil, 28 ; Mommsen, R.

But from 189 B.C. to the defeat of Perseus in 167 B.C., no formal change of importance in the status of the Greek states was made by Rome. The senate, though forced year after year to listen to the mutual recriminations and complaints of rival communities and factions, contented itself as a rule with intervening just enough to remind the Greeks that their freedom was limited by the paramount autho- rity of Rome, and to prevent any single state or con- federacy from raising itself too far above the level of general weakness which it was the interest of Rome to maintain. After the victory at Pydna, however, the sympathy shown for Perseus, exaggerated as it seems to have been by the interested representations of the Romanising factions in the various states, was made the pretext for a more emphatic assertion of Roman ascendency. All Greeks suspected of Macedonian lean- ings were removed to Italy, as hostages for the loyalty of their several communities,1 and the real motive for the step was made clear by the exceptionally severe treatment of the Ach\u00e6ans, whose loyalty was not really doubtful, but whose growing power in the Pelo- ponnese and growing independence of language had awakened alarm at Rome. A thousand of their leading men, among them the historian Polybius, were carried off to Italy. In \u00c6tolia the Romans connived at the massacre by their so-called friends of 500 of the opposite party. Acarnania was weakened by the loss of Leucas, while Athens was rewarded for her unam bitious loyalty by the gift of Delos and Samos. iLivy, xlv. 31."], [158, "HISTORY OF ROME [Book in. 138 Settlement of Greece. 146 b.c 608 a.u.c 578 a.u.c.

Thebes and Chalcis were destroyed, and the walls of all towns which had shared in the last desperate outbreak were razed to the ground. All the existing confederacies were dissolved ; no ' commercium ' was allowed be- tween one community and another. Everywhere an aristocratic type of constitution, according to the in- variable Eoman practice, was established, and the pay- ment of a tribute imposed. Into Greece, as into Macedonia in 167 B.C., the now familiar features of the provincial system were introduced \u2014 disarmament, isolation, and taxation.

Eumenes and his two successors \u2014 his brother and son, Attalus ii. and Attalus ill. \u2014 contrived indeed by studious humility and dexterous flattery to retain their thrones, but Pergamum ceased to be a powerful state, and its weakness, added to that of Ehodes, increased the pre valent disorder in Asia Minor. During the same period we have other indications of a temporary activity on the part of Eome. The frontier of the protectorate was pushed forward to the confines of Armenia and to the upper Euphrates by alliances with the kings of Pontus and Cappadocia beyond the Halys. In Syria, on the death of Antiochus Epiphanes (164 B.C.), Eome inter vened to place a minor, Antiochus Eupator, on the throne, under Eoman guardianship. In 168 B.C. Egypt formally acknowledged the suzerainty of Eome, and in 163 B.C. the senate, in the exercise of this new autho rity, restored Ptolemy Philometor to his throne, but at the same time weakened his position by handing over Cyrene and Cyprus to his brother Euergetes. This display of energy, however, was short-lived. From the death of Eumenes in 159 B.C. down to 133 B.C.

To the next period also belongs the conversion, on the death of Attalus ill. of the kingdom of Pergamum into the Eoman province of Asia. Both the western and eastern Mediterranean now acknowledged the suzerainty of Eome, but her relations with the two were from the first different. The West fell to her as the prize of victory over Carthage, and, the Carthaginian power broken, there was no hindrance to the immediate establishment in Sicily, Sardinia, Spain, and finally in Africa, of direct Eoman rule. To the majority, moreover, of her western subjects she brought a civilisation as well as a government of a higher type than any before known to them. And so in the West she not only formed provinces but created a new and wider Eoman world. To the East, on the contrary, she came as the liberator of the Greeks ; and it was only slowly that in this part of the empire her provincial system made way.

THE ROMAN STATE AND PEOPLE DURING THE PERIOD OF THE GREAT AVARS. At the close of a century first of deadly struggle and then of rapid and dazzling success, Eome found her self the supreme power in the civilised world. ' By all men,' says Polybius, writing at the end of this period, ' it was taken for granted that nothing remained but to obey the commands of the Eomans.' We have now to consider how this period of conflict and conquest had affected the victorious state. Outwardly, the constitution underwent but little change. It continued to be in form a moderate demo cracy. The sovereignty of the people finally established by the Hortensian law remained untouched in theory. It was by the people in assembly that the magistrates of the year were elected,1 and that laws were passed ; 2 only by ' order of the people ' could capital punishment be inflicted upon a Eoman citizen.

Throughout this period the actually sove reign authority in Eome was that of the senate, and behind the senate stood an order of nobles (nobiles), who claimed and enjoyed privileges as wide as those which immemorial custom had formerly conceded to the patriciate. The ascendency of the senate, which thus arrested the march of democracy in Eome, was not, to any appreciable extent, the result of legislation. The ascend. It was the direct outcome of the practical necessities of J^J^ the the time, and when these no longer existed, it was at once and successfully challenged in the name and on the behalf of the constitutional rights of the people.

Juven tius Thalna (167 B.C.), in submitting the question of war with Ehodes to the assembly without having previously consulted the senate,2 were condemned as dangerous and unprecedented. In the second place, there was an increasing tendency on the part of the magistrates to refer to the assembly only in those cases where the authority of the people was constitu tionally necessary. In other cases, and even in some where a reference to the people had been previously customary, it was the senate alone that was consulted, and it was by a simple decree of the senate that the point was settled. Thus the prolongation of a magis trate's command (prorogatio imperii), though at the time of the Samnite wars it was held to require an order of the people, was during the Punic wars and afterwards effected as a rule by decree of the senate alone.3 Though a treaty could only be ratified or war declared by the people,4 it was in the senate that the terms of peace were settled, and that audience was given to foreign ambassadors.

The control of the supplies, the most powerful weapon that a popular assembly can wield, was wielded at Eome, not by the people, but by the senate. To quote Polybius, 'the senate was master alike of all the income and of all the expenditure of the state.'4 Lastly, in the various departments of domestic administration, it was to the senate rather than to the people that questions of difficulty or importance were referred.5 This monopoly of government by the senate, to the exclusion of the people, was accompanied by a change in the relations of the senate with the magistrates. The latter from being its superiors became its subor dinates, seeking its advice on all occasions, and yielding to the advice when given the obedience due to a com mand. It became the first duty of a magistrate to be the loyal minister of the senate, and to be always amenable to its authority.6 Senatorial decrees gradu ally acquired something of the binding force of statutes. Many of them were acted upon year after year by suc- 1 Polyb. vi. 13 ; Livy, xliii. 6. 2 Livy, xxiv. 11 : ' de republica belloque gerendo et quantum copiarum et ubi qu\u00e6que essent consules ad senatum rettulerunt.' 3 Compare the decree as to Macedonia, Livy, xlv. 17, 18. 4 Polyb. vi. 13 ; Cic. in Vatinium, xiii. 36. 6 E.g. the prevalence of foreign worships, Livy, xxv. 1.

In one most important point it succeeded completely. Although the magistrate's original pre rogative of creating senators was not taken away, he was gradually so restricted in its exercise as to leave him no freedom of choice.3 It is clear from the accounts we possess of the manner in which the vacancies in the senate were filled up in 216 B.C., that there was then a well understood order of preference, which the magis trate was expected to follow. Those who had held any curale magistracy, if not already senators, had the first claim; next after them came those who had been tribunes of the plebs, \u00e6diles of the plebs, or qu\u00e6stors ; finally those private citizens who had won distinction in war.4 But in that year, thanks to the losses at Cann\u00e6, the number of vacancies was exceptionally large. Ordinarily, we may be certain that the magistrate had no need to 1 E.g. those which regulated the organisation and administration of provinces. 2 E.g. the law of appeal was held to be suspended by the decree ' darent operam consules ne quid respublica detrimenti caperet ' (Sail. Cat., 29). 3 Festus, p. 246, describes the kings and consuls as freely selecting senators 'ut reges sibi legebant, sublegebantque quos in consilio publico haberent ita . . . consules . . . coujunctissimos sibi . . . legebant.' 4 Livy, xxiii. 23."], [169, "Ch. 3.] THE ASCENDENCY OF THE SENATE 147 travel beyond the list of those who, as having held a magistracy since the last revision of the senate, had by law or custom a preferential claim to a seat.1 The senate thus ceased to be a body of advisers freely chosen by the magistrate from all ranks of the community. In stead, it was regularly recruited according to estab lished rules, and the magistrate had practically no choice but formally to admit into the senate the persons entitled to a seat. But it was not only the magistrates' discretion in choosing senators that was restricted. It seems clear that, in some way or other, during this period his power of expulsion was limited also, and that a senator, once admitted, retained his seat for , life unless he were found guilty of some gross and scandalous conduct. One other point must also be noticed. The senate was, under this system, not only recruited without reference to the discretion of the magistrate, but it was recruited only from the official class, from those who had held a magistracy. The result was that the lay element disappeared. The senate of the latter years of this period consisted entirely of magistrates and ex-magistrates. It became an essentially bureaucratic and official body. Nothing its pro more clearly proves the subordinate relation in which the senate originally stood to the magistrate than its rules of procedure. They were evidently based on 1 Livy (xxii. 49) speaks of those ' qui eos magistrate gessissent, unde in senatum legi deberent,'and these magistracies were evidently the curule offices. At what period the tribunate of the plebs first entitled its holder to a seat in the senate at the next revision is uncer tain.

But in the time of the Gracchi it was clearly customary for a seat in the senate to follow as soon as possible after the qu\u00e6storship."], [170, "148 HISTORY OF ROME [Book in. the assumption that the senate could only advise the magistrate when consulted by him, that he might accept or reject its advice as he chose, and that its expression of opinion only acquired authoritative force when adopted and acted upon by him. But this as- sumption, in the period with which we are dealing, had ceased to correspond with the facts of the case, and it appears that some attempt was made to bring the forms and rules of senatorial procedure into closer con- formity with the actual state of affairs. It was pro- bably, to take a few instances, during this period that it became etiquette for a magistrate, when laying a matter before the house, to abstain from anticipating the decision of the senate by making any proposal of his o-wn,1 and that the anomalous permission was conceded to a senator, when asked for his opinion, of travelling beyond the question, an evasive mode of enabling him to introduce any business in which he was interested.2 Equally significant is the fact that, whereas in earlier times the magistrate was said to act ' in accordance with the opinion ' of the senate, he was now said to act ' in accordance with the decree,' or with the authority, of the senate.' 3 But, as will be seen later on, these changes did not go far enough to remove an inconsistency which mattered little while the senate was strong, and the magistrates weak, but which had serious consequences when the case was reversed. 1 The usual formula was ' quid de ea fieri placet.'

Cic, Phil., x. 17. 2 For this privilege, ' egredi relationem,' see Tac, Ann., ii. 38 ; Gell. iv. 10 ; Cic. ad Fam., x. 28. 3 Mommsen, Staatsrecht, iii. 994."], [171, "Ch. 3.] THE ASCENDENCY OF THE SENATE 149 The causes of the ascendency which the senate thus Causes of the acquired at the cost both of the popular assembly and ofthesenate. the executive magistracy are not difficult to discover. Natfre In the first place, the two assemblies, through which Assembly. the Eoman people exercised their sovereign prero- gatives of election and legislation, the ' comitia ' of the ' populus ' by its centuries, and the ' concilium ' of the plebs by its tribes, were hampered in their action by one serious defect. Neither could act unless set in motion by a magistrate. They could only meet when convened by a magistrate, and though there were many days on which a magistrate could not convene an assembly,1 there were not, as at Athens, any fixed days on which he was obliged to do so. Moreover, when once assembled they could only act in response to the question (rogatio) addressed to them by the presiding consul, pr\u00e6tor, or tribune.2 There wrere, of course, certain cases in which the magistrate was bound to convene an assembly and to ask the people to express their will. But there were a vast number of cases in which this procedure was not constitutionally necessary, and in these it rested with the magistrate to consult the people or not as he chose. A large field was thus left to his discretion, and in the exercise of his discretion he was guided by circumstances. As it happened, throughout this period circumstances were 1 E.g. ' dies fasti' and ' nefasti,' and days set apart as holidays or for thanksgiving. In Cicero's time the number of days on which ' comitia ' could be held (dies comitiales) was not large. 2 Gell. x. 20 : ' caput ipsum et origo et quasi frons ' ' rogatio \" est . . nam ni populus aut plebs rogetur, nullum plebis aut populi jussum fieri potest.'"], [172, "Changes in the Magis. tvacy. 150 HISTORY OF ROME [Book in. all unfavourable to a frequent consultation of the people. The assembly, whether of the 'populus' or plebs, could only meet in the city, or just outside the walls in the Campus Martius. But the voters were a large body, many of them resident at a great distance from Eome ; or away on service with the legions ; to get them together was inconvenient and difficult ; nor when as sembled were they specially qualified to decide the intricate questions of military and foreign policy which occupied the attention of Eoman statesmen at the time. By comparison with the assembly the senate appeared to great advantage. It could be easily and quickly summoned. It included within its ranks the most experienced soldiers and statesmen of the day. The fact that its members owed their seats ultimately to their having been elected by the people to a magis tracy, gave it some sort of title to speak with authority in the people's name. Finally, in the senate-house, the careful and deliberate discussion which the forms of the assembly precluded were always possible. But these were not the only considerations which led the magistrates of this period to turn to the senate rather than to the people for counsel and direction. The habitual deference which they paid to the senate was largely due to changes which had taken place in the magistracy itself, and in the nature and amount of the work which it had to do. Nothing is more characteristic of the Eoman constitution than the width and completeness of the ' power of command ' (imperium) with which the Eoman people invested their chief magistrates. The magistrate 'with the"], [173, "Ch. 3.] THE ASCENDENCY OF THE SENATE 151 imperium ' was in theory and for the time all-power- ful. Senate and assembly met only when he convened them, and considered only what he laid before them. He was equally capable of administering justice at home and of leading the legions abroad. While hold- ing the imperium he was irresponsible and irremovable. But this plenary authority, though exercised to the full by the first consuls, and at a later time by the C\u00e6sars, was exercised in a much more restricted fashion by the magistrates of the period of the great wars. It had been, as we have seen, the object of attack during the early days of the struggle between the orders. The Valerian law of appeal had taken away from the consuls the power of inflicting capital punishment upon Eoman citizens within the city, and by the institution of the tribunate, their action inside the city bounds was rendered liable at any moment to interference. In 435 B.C. the important duties con- 319 a.u.c. nected with the census were separated from the im- perium and transferred to two censores. By the Hortensian law (287 B.C.) the plebeian tribunes finally 467 a.u.c obtained a rival and independent power of initiating legislation, and to this was added afterwards that of convening and consulting the senate.1 But it was not only by these attacks from without that the position of the magistrates with the imperium was weakened. As Eome expanded, and the business of administration increased, it was found necessary to increase their 1 Varro (Ap. Gell., xiv. 8) implies that the tribunes obtained this right before the ' plebiscitum Atinium.' Unfortunately the date of this plebiscite is unknown. Mommsen would assign it to the Gracchan period (133-102 B.C.)."], [174, "HISTORY OF ROME [Book in. 152 390 A.u.c. 527 A.U.C 557 A.U.C number. The original 'college' of two pr\u00e6tor-consuls was gradually enlarged. In 364 B.C. a third pr\u00e6tor, the pr\u00e6tor urbanus, was added, and the civil jurisdic tion between citizens intrusted to him.1 A hundred and twenty years later, a fourth was appointed to take charge of cases in which the 'aliens,' now becoming numerous, were concerned.2 The annexation of terri tories beyond the sea involved a further enlargement. In 227 B.C. two pr\u00e6tors were first elected to administer the newly-formed provinces of Sicily and Sardinia; in 197 B.C. two more were found necessary for the govern ment of Hither and Further Spain.3 Thus, throughout the last fifty years of this period, there were no less than eight magistrates invested with the imperium, to whom must be added a variable but steadily increasing number of proconsuls and propr\u00e6tors. The eight actual ' magistratus cum imperio ' elected each year formed a college, each member of which was capable indi vidually of exercising any or all of the powers belong ing to the imperium. The endless confusion which the existence of so many parallel authorities was likely to produce was partially guarded against by certain rules of precedence. To the two original members of the college, now known as ' consuls,' a certain priority was granted over the remaining six, to whom the old title ' pr\u00e6tores ' was confined. The consuls were said to have the ' majus imperium,' \u2014 a convenient term of which the C\u00e6sars made dexterous use, \u2014 and in any conflict of authority the lesser imperium of the 1 Livy, vi. 42 : ' qui jus inter cives diceret.' 2 Livy, Epit., 19 : ' pr\u00e6tor peregrinus.' 3 Livy, Epit., 20 ; ib. xxxii. 27."], [175, "The Nobility. Ch. 3.] THE NOBILITY 153 pr\u00e6tors gave way to theirs.1 So, too, a collision between equals, between consul and consul, pr\u00e6tor and pr\u00e6tor, was provided for by the rule that ' he who prohibits is stronger than he who commands.' 2 It is obvious, how ever, that these rules did not go very far towards securing either the exact division of labour, or the harmonious and well-directed co-operation, which was necessary for the right conduct of the ever-increasing business of Eoman government. For this purpose some central regulative authority was needed, and nowhere but in the senate could such an authority be found. As early, at the latest, as the commencement of the second Punic war, it was the senate which, at the beginning of the year, determined what the depart ments to be filled should be, and decided which should be consular and which pr\u00e6torian.3 The individual magistrates, as a rule, readily conceded to the senate a control which relieved them of a heavy responsibility, and gave unity and cohesion to the action of the state, and the occasions were rare on which, during this period, a magistrate ventured to dispute its authority. But though the ascendency of the senate was mainly due to the fact that without it the government of the state could scarcely have been carried on, it was strengthened 1 Cic ad Att., ix. 9: 'pr\u00e6tores . . . conleg\u00e6 consulum, quorum est majus imperium ; Gell. xiii. 15 : ' imperium minus pr\u00e6tor, majus habet consul.' 2 Cic. de Legg., 3. 3 At the first meeting of the senate each year the new consuls formally referred to it the question of the provinces; e.g. Livy, xxvi. 1."], [176, "154 HISTORY OF ROME [Book in. and confirmed by the close and intimate connection which existed between the senate and the nobility. This ' nobility ' was in its nature and origin widely different from the old ' patriciate. ' l Though every patri cian was of course ' noble,' the majority of the families which in this period styled themselves noble were not patrician but plebeian, and the typical nobles of the time of the elder Cato, of the Gracchi, or of Cicero, the Metelli, Livii, or Licinii were plebeians. The title 'nobilis' was apparently conceded by custom to those plebeian families one or more of whose members had, after the opening of the magistracies, been elected to a curule office, and which in consequence were entitled to place in their halls, and to display at their funeral processions the ' imagines ' 2 of these distinguished ancestors. The man who, by his election to a curule office thus en nobled his descendants, was said to be the ' founder of his family,' 3 though himself only a new man.4 Legally, therefore, this ' nobility ' was within the reach of any citizen who obtained even the curule \u00e6dileship. Nor did it carry with it any rights or privileges whatever. It is certain, moreover, that during the first sixty or seventy years of this period it was generally accessible in practice as well as in theory, and that almost every year some fresh plebeian family was ennobled. It was, for instance, from the time of the Punic w-ars that the Caccilii Metelli, the Aurelii Cott\u00e6, the Flaminii, the 1 Mommsen, Rom.

Office brought wealth and prestige, and both wealth and prestige were freely employed to exclude ' new men ' and to secure for the ' noble families ' a monopoly of office. The ennobled plebeians not unly united with the patricians to form a distinct order, but outdid them in pride and arrogance. As early as 217 B.C. it was openly said 537 a.u.c that the only true plebeians were the ' new men,' and that the plebeian nobles had begun to despise the plebs ever since they themselves ceased to be despised by the patricians.2 By the close of this period (133 B.C.) C21 a.u.c. it was already rare for any one not of a noble family to attain high office, while the cadets of the noble houses looked forward to an official career as their birthright.3 Thus both the magistracies and the senate to which they gave admission, though open in theory to all freeborn citizens, were in fact monopolised by a single class. And in return the whole wealth and influen.ce of the nobility went to support the senate, whose ascendency they regarded as essential to the maintenance of their own usurped position as the governing class, and which was identified with them selves in its sympathies and interests. The establishment of senatorial ascendency was not The Provin- cial System 1 See the calculations of Willems, Le Senat Romain, i. 274-399. and the pro- 2 Livy, xxii. 34 : ' Non finem belli ante habituros, quam consulem consulate. vere plebeium id est hominem novum fecissent, nam plebeios nobiles jam eisdem {i.e. as the patricians) initiatos esse sacris, et contemnere plebem ex quo contemni a patribus desierunt, c\u00e6pisse. 3 The consulship in particular was regarded as reserved only for nobles.

During the same time, the foundations were laid of the provincial system, and with this of the new and dangerous powers of the proconsuls. In dealing with her new dependencies beyond the sea, Eome did not adhere to the principles which she had followed in Italy. The transmarine communities, with few exceptions, were indeed, like those in Italy, dignified with the honourable title of ' allies ' (socii) and in the case of some of them the alliance was, as in Italy, a real one, based upon an actual treaty with Eome, and implying some sort of equality. But these ' treaty states ' l were a small minority, and as Eome grew stronger it was but rarely that she condescended to admit any community to this privileged position. The vast majority of these new allies were allies only in name, and the ' alliance ' was little better than a fiction which imperfectly concealed their actual sub jection. Between them and the genuine allies of Eome, in or out of Italy,2 lay all the difference involved in the fact that they were disarmed, were taxed, and, above all, were grouped as provinces under the immediate control of a resident Eoman magistrate.3 1 ' Civitates f\u0153derat\u00e6 ' : of the sixty-eight communities which in Cicero's time formed the province of Sicily, three were ' f\u0153derat\u00e6.'

The ' lex provinci\u00e6. The creation of a province, that is, of a separate and permanent magisterial department of administra tion, was a step which, as virtually implying annexa tion, Eome was often slow in taking.1 But whenever carried out, the ' reduction into the form of a province 2 of a group of communities ' was effected in much the same way. The main lines on which the new province was to be organised were usually laid down by decree of the senate, and the work of organisation then in trusted to a commission of senators.'3 The result of their labours was embodied in what was called the ' lex provinci\u00e6.' 4 This was in fact a provincial con stitution, by which the extent of the new department, the number and status of the communities included within it, their rights and obligations, the mode and amount of the taxation, as well as a variety of details connected with the administration of justice and with local government were determined. Its provisions were binding not only upon the communities of the Roman magistrate which marked the 'formation of a province.' Thus Macedonia was disarmed and taxed in 167 B.C., but no province was created there till 146. ' Provincia' meant properly the ' department ' or ' sphere of command ' assigned to a Roman magistrate. 1 This was conspicuously the case in the East.

A Eoman province, as a glance at the lists in Pliny's Natural History 3 will show, was an aggregate of separate communities (civitates), and in fixing the number of these, and the extent of their territories, Eome evidently respected, where possible, the already existing political divisions. It is true that federations which might prove dangerous were dissolved, or reduced to harmless religious associations ; that some 1 Cicero charges Verres with violating the provincial constitution of Sicily (lex Rupilia) which all governors before him had respected.

The Sicilian constitution, for instance, was thus revised after the great slave war by P. Rupilius (consul 132 B.C.). On the other hand, the constitution given to Bithynia by Pompey (65 B.C.) was still in force when the younger Pliny was there as governor (111 A.D.).

All alike were required, as indeed the Italian allies had been, to have the same friends and foes as the Eoman people, to contract no independent alliances, and not to violate the Eoman peace by waging independent wars.2 The further step of prohibiting intermarriage and ' commerce,' between the separate communities of a province, seems to have been only taken by Eome in the earlier days of her empire, when her confidence in her strength was not yet fully established.3 1 The 'regiones' enumerated by Pliny (JV. H., iii. 18) along the sea board of Hither Spain all bear the names of tribes, and appear to represent the original divisions of the Roman province. In parts of Macedonia, and in Gallia Narbonensis, the old tribes remained intact as ' civitates,' though, as happened also in Spain, the tribal name was superseded by that of the central town, the 'caput gentis,' such as Vienna Allobrogum (Strabo, 186). In other cases two or more towns arose within the tribal canton and obtained recognition as independent ' civitates. ' 2 Strabo, 189, notes the beneficial effect in Gaul of the stoppage by Rome of the incessant tribal wars. * The prohibition of ' connubium ' and ' commercium ' was en forced in Sicily (Cic, Verr., iii. 40), and in Macedonia (Livy, xlv. 29)."], [182, "HISTORY OF ROME [Book in. 160 Local self- government. Under these limitations each ' civitas ' was re cognised as a self-governing community, though the degree of self-government allowed varied widely. There was, in the first place, a wide difference between the 'free states' and the rest. The former, whether treaty states, like Gades, or states to which Eome had voluntarily granted 'freedom,' as for instance Cen turip\u00e6 in Sicily,1 were, strictly speaking, outside the province. They were not subject to the authority of the resident governor, they paid no taxes, and they enjoyed complete local independence, subject only to the recognition of Eoman suzerainty.2 The autonomy of the ordinary provincial community was of a much more restricted kind. They paid taxes, and were con sequently often styled ' stipendiari\u00e6,' or in Sicily ' decuman\u00e6.' They were further directly under the control of the Eoman governor. It would also seem that, in many cases, it was left to the governor to decide what amount of local self-government could be con ceded to them, and that he had the right to supervise the local officials, to examine the accounts, and to modify or even cancel the local constitution.3 But the cases 1 Cicero describes Centurip\u00e6 as ' sine f\u0153dere immunis ac libera ' (Verr., iii. 13). 2 They could be called upon to aid Rome in war with men, ships, and supplies. See for further details Marquardt, i. 347, 399. No Roman troops could be quartered on a free state. 3 Cicero (Ad AU., vi. 2) describes himself as allowing the com munities of his province ' suis legibus et judiciis uti,' and as having inspected the local accounts for the previous ten years. Apamea, on the contrary, protested against such an inspection by Pliny, on the ground that it was privileged ' suo arbitrio rempublicam administrare ' (Epp. ad Traj., 47). Cicero declares that, in allowing ' autonomy,' he was following the policy of his predecessor Sc\u00e6vola(93 B.C.)

In Sicily, with the exception of certain communities, the existing system of tithes was retained unaltered ; a and the same was the case at first in the province of Asia.2 In the other provinces in Spain, Africa, and Macedonia, Eome merely fixed the amount of the tribute 3 to be paid annually, and left the local authorities to raise it as best they could in their own way. Nor, if the case of Macedonia was not exceptional, was the amount de- manded excessive.4 It would indeed have been better had the Eepublican statesmen gone further, and anti cipated the emperors by placing the taxation of the provinces on a sound basis, and bringing it directly under the control of the central authorities. The provincial taxpayer would probably have paid less, and the Eoman treasury would certainly have received more.5 On the whole, however, little fault can be found 1 Compare the regulations in Sicily mentioned by Cicero (Verr., ii. 13). 2 Cic, Verr., iii. 6.

The misfortune was that she took no sufficient precautions to secure their observance, and in the auto cratic power wielded by the governor in charge of a province lies the explanation of her failure. The governor of a Eoman province was no doubt in theory bound to respect the constitution of the pro vince, as well as all other rules laid down for his guidance by senate or people ; and he was, like any other magistrate, expected to ask and to follow the advice of the senate on important matters. In fact, however, his position was such that these checks were of little use. He held the 'imperium,' but the restrictions imposed upon its exercise in Eome ceased to operate across the sea. He shared his authority with no colleague ; no law of appeal limited his power of life and death over the subject pro vincials ; he was beyond the reach of the tribune's veto, and often at a safe distance from the senate. The supplies voted him from home,1 and the taxes paid by the provincials were at his free disposal.2 If he needed more he had ample authority to requisition what he wanted from within the province s \u2014 while his i To each governor was voted by decree of the senate an equipment (ornatio) for his province.

Even in matters of frontier policy a wide discretion was allowed him, and he could be warlike or pacific as his tastes and ambitions directed.

It must often have happened that a man went out to a province, as Cicero did, with no more knowledge of provincial administration than he might have picked up years before as a qu\u00e6stor, while to which province he went was a point decided by mutual arrangement, or the chances of lot ; nor did the brief term 3 for which he held his command, while it quickened the anxiety of the worser sort to reap the governor and his staff, were the curse of the provinces, and repeated efforts were made to check them by law, but in vain. 1 Of Verres' staff (cohors pr\u00e6toria) Cicero says, ' plus mali dedit Sicili\u00e6 quum centum cohortes fugitivorum.' 2 Cic. pro Plancio, 28 ; ad Q.fr., i. 1, 3. 3 The normal term was one year, though towards the close of the republic there was a tendency to extend it.

That an authority so wide, exercised at such a distance from home, and amid innumerable tempta- tions to abuse 1 should have been frequently abused was inevitable. Yet for the abuse of his powers by a governor no really effective penalty was provided. It is true that the establishment in 149 B.C. by the Lex Calpurnia of a special court to try cases of magisterial extortion in the provinces 2 gave the provincial for the first time a recognised means of obtaining redress. But the remedy did not fully meet the case. The new court ' for the recovery of monies ' sat in Eome, and to bring documents and witnesses to Eome from Spain or Asia was a costly matter. It was, until 122 B.C., com- posed of senators,3 that is, of men who either had been or were looking forward to being themselves governors of provinces, and who as Eomans and nobles were more in sympathy with the accused than with his accusers. No proceedings, moreover, could be taken against a governor until his term of office was over, when the injuries inflicted were often already irre parable, or the evidence difficult to collect. But extortion, whether it took the shape of illegal requisitions, of systematic blackmailing,4 or straight- 1 A vivid picture of these temptations is drawn by Cicero (A d Q. fr., i. 1) in his letter to Quintus Cicero, then governor of Asia, ' pro vincia corruptrix,' as Cicero calls it. 5 This law established the first 'qu\u00e6stio perpetua de pecuniis repetundis.'

A far more serious defect in the system was that it rendered a comprehensive and consistent imperial policy impossible. Under it the provinces were not so much departments of one empire, as separate principalities, ruled by autocrats absolutely independent of each other, and virtually independent of the home government. Even within the limits of the single province one governor might undo what his predecessor had done. Neither a settled frontier policy, nor a proper adjustment of taxation, nor even a proper estimate and control of imperial expenditure were possible. But this independence of the provincial governors was, in addition, a source of danger to the Eepublican constitution. While the prevalent confusion and misgovernment brought discredit upon the authority of the senate and people of Eome,1 their authority itself and that of the magistrates of the state was seriously weakened. To this result a change which was made towards the end of this period largely con tributed. At the outset the government of a province was intrusted to one of the 'magistrates with the imperium ' for the year, and, unless special circum- avoid having Roman troops quartered upon them (Cic ad *itt., v. 21), or the 'vectigal \u00e6dilicium, i.e. the requisitioning of beasts for the \u00e6dile's games in Rome (Cic ad Q.fr., i. 1, 9 ; Livy, xl. 44). 1 Compare the words of Tacitus as to the acquiescence of the pro vinces in the rule of Augustus, Ann. i. 2 : ' suspecto senatus populique imperio ob certamina potentium et avaritiam magistratuum, invalido legumauxilio.'"], [188, "608 A.u.c. 427 a.u.c 166 HISTORY OF ROME [Book hi. stances called for the presence of a consul,1 to one of the pr\u00e6tors. But as the number of provinces, and also the amount of business devolving upon the consuls and pr\u00e6tors at home, increased, this arrangement broke down.2 After 146 B.C. the pr\u00e6tors were never employed abroad, and the consuls only in case of war. The place of both in the regular government of the provinces was taken by ' pro-magistrates,' 3 by men in vested with the imperium 'pro-consule' or 'pro pr\u00e6tore.' It is true that, as early as 327 B.C.,4 Eome had been obliged to depart from the old principle that the ' imperium ' could only be exercised by a magis trate duly appointed by the people. But the departure was at first slight. The appointment of a ' pro-magis trate ' was an exceptional thing, \u2014 it required an ex press vote of the people, \u2014 and the pro-magistrates were, in fact as well as in name, the deputies and subordinates of the actual magistrates. It was during the Second Punic War that they were first commonly employed,5 and at the same time it became customary 1 Sardinia was intrusted to a consul in 177 B.C., 'propter belli magnitudinem ' (Livy, xli. 8) ; for another instance, see Livy, xxxiii. 45. 2 In 167 B.C. a pr\u00e6tor was prevented from taking his province by press of judicial business in Rome (Livy, xlv. 16), The establishment of the ' qu\u00e6stio de repetundis ' (149 B.C.) permanently reduced the number of pr\u00e6tors available for foreign service to three, since neither the pr.-urbanus nor the pr.-peregrinus could leave Italy. Meanwhile the number of provinces had risen to six. 3 For this convenient term see Mommsen, Staatsrecht, i. 520. ' Pro magistratu ' was used as equivalent to pro-consule, pro-pr\u00e6tore, in legal phraseology, e.g. in the Lex Rubria and Lex Acilia de pecuniis repetundis. 4 See above, p. 97. 5 In the year 214 B.C. there were at least seven (Livy, xxiv. 10).

Their real importance, however, dates from the time when to them was intrusted year after year the care of the provinces beyond the sea. The effect of this change was in the first place to deprive the people of any direct voice in the appoint ment of the men who were to govern their dependencies, an infringement of their constitutional rights against which the popular leaders of the following period effec tively protested.1 In the next place, the old relations between the magistrates and the pro-magistrates were inverted. The ' pro-magistracies ' lost their occasional subordinate character. They became regular offices, filled up year after year. The pro-consul or pro-pr\u00e6tor, though still technically inferior in rank to the consul or pr\u00e6tor, was to all intents and purposes independent of him.2 Nor was this all. The position of the real magistrates in Eome, of the responsible heads of the executive, could not compare in attractiveness with that of their supposed deputies abroad. The routine duties and restricted authority of the former contrasted unfavourably with the wide powers and splendid opportunities for acquiring wTealth and fame open to the latter. By the close of this period even the consulship was by many valued chiefly as a stepping-stone to the pro-consulship, and the way was preparing for the time 1 E.g. in the case of Marius and the command in Numidia ; Pompey in 67, 66, and 55, and C\u00e6sar in 59 received their commands directly from the people. 2 Mommsen, Staatsrecht, ii. 219.

The opening of the world to Eome, and of Eome to the world, produced a change also in every de partment of Eoman life, and every class of Eoman society. The subjugation of the Mediterranean coun tries by placing at the disposal of Eome, not only the great natural resources of Africa or Spain, but the accumulated treasures of Greece and Asia Minor, caused a sudden and rapid rise in the standard of wealth, and a marked change both in the sources from which that wealth was derived, and in the manner in which it was distributed. The Eoman State itself no longer drew its revenues only from the public lands in Italy or from the ' tribute ' imposed upon its own citizens. In every province it was the owner of wide domains. The territory of Carthage in Africa, the mines of Spain, the crown lands of the Macedonian kings,1 were all now the property of the Eoman people. To them also belonged the tithes of Sicily, the yearly tribute of the five other provinces, and the proceeds of the customs duties throughout the empire. And though, thanks to a wasteful system of finance, these new sources of revenue did not greatly enrich the Eoman treasury, they enabled the government to dispense for the future with all direct taxation of Eoman citizens. After 167 B.C. the ' tributum ' was 1 See the list of properties owned by the Roman state in the pro vinces, Cicero, Agr., I. ii. 5."], [191, "Ch. 3.] THE ROMAN PEOPLE 169 never again levied in Italy, until Italy became in fact a province.1 But the wealth drawn from the provinces by the state was, after all, trifling in amount compared with that which flowed into the pockets of individual citizens. Of the booty taken in war, by far the greater part was usually appropriated by the successful general and his soldiers.2 Nor was it only the great campaigns against Philip or Antiochus that were profitable ; a rich harvest was yielded even by the ' little wars ' with Spanish, Illyrian, or Keltic tribes, and the gold orna ments of the latter were as welcome as the ' royal trea sures ' of King Antiochus, and the statues and bronzes of Greek cities.3 The spoils of peace were richer than those of war, and were more easily won. To every class the provinces offered a field for money-making. The nobles who, in one capacity or another, as gover nors, legates, or qu\u00e6stors, served in the provinces ; the contractors (publicani) who collected the customs 1 The ' tributum ' was an occasional tax levied to meet the cost of war. When the state of the treasury rendered it possible, it was remitted or even repaid, e.g. in 293 B.C. (Livy, x. 46), and in 187 B.C. (Livy, xxxix. 7). That it was not levied after 167 B.C. is stated by Cicero, de Off., ii. 22 ; Pliny, If. H., xxxiii. 56. Its re-introduction, though in a different form, into Italy was the Work of Diocletian. Marquardt, Staalsverw., ii. 158, 171, 217. 3 This was an abuse, and Cato protested vigorously against this diversion of what was due to the state into private pockets. See the fragment of his speech, 'De pr\u00e6da militibus dividenda,' ap. Gell., ii. 18. In another speech Cato takes credit to himself for not divid ing the spoils of war among his friends (Fronto, Ep. ad Ant., i. 2). A glaring instance was the misappropriation of the ' money of King Antiochus,' Livy, xxxviii. 54. 3 Livy, xxxiv. 4 : 'jam in Gr\u00e6ciam Asiamque transcendimus, regias etiam attrectamus gazas, signaab Syracusis illata.'

Even the population of the capital at home got their share of the spoil in the frequent dis tributions of corn and money, and in the splendid spectacles provided for their benefit.1 It is true that Horace contrasts the age of Cato with his own as an age of simplicity and frugality.2 None the less is it certain that a conspicuous feature in that period was the introduction into Eoman life of a sumptuousness and splendour unknown before. The speeches of Cato were filled with passionate protests against the new craving for wealth which had seized upon his contemporaries, and against the luxury and extravagance which the possession of wealth encour aged.3 It is significant that in 215 B.C. the long series of Eoman sumptuary laws was opened by a plebiscite, the lex Oppia,4 which was directed against the grow ing love of Eoman ladies for gold jewellery, fine dresses, and carriages; and still more significant is the fact that in 195 B.C. the Oppian law was, in spite of Cato's 1 Plut. , Cato, 8, rim 'Pa/xaluiii ijfj.011 Cipjxriixtvov aKaipi**^ iwl traopeT pla, Kal Sianofids.

In the Eoman house holds, on the Eoman estates, in every branch of Eoman business, the slave became ubiquitous and indis pensable. But the effects of this influx of wealth did not end here. It gradually altered the whole structure of Eoman society, by destroying the equality and homo geneity which had once been its chief characteristic. The Eoman community, at the time when Pyrrhus landed in Italy, was still in the main a community of farmers, tilling their own small farms. Differences, of course, there were between patrician and plebeian, rich and poor, and the Licinian laws prove that the desire of ' adding field to field ' 4 had been growing, as Eoman conquest offered fresh facilities for its gratification. But, on the whole, there was a remarkable equality of conditions and a uniformity in the mode of living. 1 Livy, xxxiv. 8. 2 Macrob., Sat., ii. 13: 'primade c\u00e6nis lex pr\u00e6scribebat numerum convivarum.

Not only the soldier in the ranks of the legions, but even the consuls who led them, were taken from, the plough.1 This state of things could not long survive the acquisition of empire beyond the seas. While, on the one hand, the harassing demands of military service in Spain or Asia,2 the importation of foreign corn and foreign slaves, and the unequal competition with capitalists grown rich abroad, rendered farming in Italy, at least on the old lines, increasingly laborious and unprofitable,3 the provinces offered an irresistibly attractive field for money-making on a scale unknown before. The result was not only that land ceased to be the sole or even the main source of wealth, but that the community began to be divided more sharply by differences in wealth, and in the manner in which the wealth was acquired and spent. From the govern ment of the provinces the nobles returned no longer to live in honourable poverty on their farms, but to build themselves villas, which they filled with the spoils of Greece or Asia, to surround themselves with troops of slaves and dependants, and to live rather as princes than as citizens of a republic. Immediately below them a second ' order ' was beginning to assume a definite shape. It was composed of the state con- 1 Cic, pro Rose.

For the similar case of M. Atilius Regulus (cons. 256 B.C.), see Val. Max., iv. 4, 6. But in Cato's time a patrician who, like L.

Ch. 3.] THE ROMAN PEOPLE 173 tractors (publicani) and the men of business (nego- tiatores). These men, it is true, had not yet acquired the influence which they afterwards enjoyed,1 nor were they yet known as the 'equestrian order.'2 But already the wide area for their operations opened to them by the expansion of Eome had greatly increased their wealth. They were already difficult to control,3 and the lex Claudia ( 2 1 8 B.C. ) 4 is a proof that the rivalry between them and the nobles, which in the next period inflicted such injury upon the state, was beginning to show itself. Below these ' two orders,' as they came to be called, a third class was rapidly rising into im- portance, that of the ' plebs of the city,' the popidace of Eome. Its numbers were augmented by the artisans and traders who found employment in supplying the wants of the growing city, by the impoverished farmers and peasants who were attracted to Eome by the prospect of cheap bread and games, lastly, by the slaves who, year by year, were enrolled in its ranks as freedmen.5 It was a misfortune for Eome that this ' plebs urbana,' though not the most numerous, and i The law of C. Gracchus (122 B.C.), which gave to the ' publicani ' the collection of the tithes of Asia, enormously increased their wealth and influence. 2 Plin., N.

Of the voters in the thirty-five tribes who legally constituted the Eoman people, large numbers resided at such a distan'ce from Eome as to render their attendance at the ' comitia,' and the exercise of their political rights difficult, if not impossible. In ordinary cases, consequently, it was the voters resident in or near the city who represented the sovereign people, who elected the magistrates and passed the laws. The results of this state of things were disastrous in more ways than one. To win the support of the city plebs became a necessity, and the means employed to win it poisoned the political life of Eome. The new wealth derived from the provinces was freely spent in bribery of every kind,1 and the populace of Eome was encouraged to claim as the price of its support a share in the spoils of the empire, and to regard all political questions from a purely selfish point of view. Nor was this all. The absurdity and injustice of a system under which the sovereign authority of the Eoman people was wielded by a corrupt minority could not long escape notice, and the attempts subsequently made to secure for the assembly a larger share in the government of the empire served only to place it in a clearer light.

In no other community have established custom and ancient usage played a more important part, and in scarcely any community have they been subjected to a more sudden and serious assault than that to which they were exposed in Eome by the sudden breaking down of the barriers which had so long isolated Eome from all but occasional contact with the civilisation of the Mediterranean countries. Among the new influences which now swept like a flood over Eoman society, the most powerful and lasting was that exercised by the Greek civilisation, which ruled supreme throughout the Eastern Mediterranean.1 With this Hellenism Eome was brought face to face first of all in Magna Gr\u00e6cia, and it is noticeable that the names with which the history of Eoman literature opens are nearly all associated with the Gr\u00e6cised districts of South Italy.2 But during the fifty years which followed the battle of Zama,3 a close and con stant intercourse was established both with the ancient states of Greece itself, and with the scarcely less ancient Greek communities of Asia Minor. To Greeks of all classes the Italian republic, which had so sud denly become the greatest power in the Mediterranean, which had overthrown the Ph\u0153nician, and broken the power of Macedon and Syria, became an object of keen 1 See besides Mommsen, R.

On the side of Eome, along with the political sympathy felt for civilised city states, enjoying institu tions not unlike her own, and with a similar interest in keeping at a distance both despots and barbarians, there was also undoubtedly a genuine admiration and enthusiasm for the literature, the language, the art, and even the political life of Greece. At the outset, especially, the results were good. The Hellenism which fascinated Eome in the days of the Scipios was comparatively pure. It came chiefly from the least degenerate seats of Greek civilisation, from Achaia, or Athens, or Ehodes, and its prominent representatives were such men as the philosopher Pan\u00e6tius or the statesman-historian Polybius. Among the Eomans ' Philhellenism ' had not yet degenerated into a fashion. It was still a real passion, which was strongest in the best minds of the day,1 and its effects were seen most clearly, not in a mere affectation of Greek manners and habits, but in a quickened in tellectual activity, in wider sympathies and a more humane life. It created a Eoman literature which, even when its theme was the struggles and victories of Eome, borrowed its form, and occasionally its lan guage, from Greece.2 The study of Greek and of the great Greek authors became a regular part of Eoman 1 As, for instance, in the younger Scipio Africanus, the friend of Polybius, in the two Gracchi, and their mother Cornelia, in L. \u00c6milius Paullus, the conqueror of Macedonia. 2 E.g. in the poems of Ennius.

As once before in Athens, so now in Eome, the ' new learning ' was a disturbing and unsettling force. The Eoman citizen was not only confronted with new doctrines in politics and religion and new rules of conduct ; he was invited to criticise and discuss, he was initiated in the subtleties of Greek dialectic,4 and the daring speculations of Greek philosophy. The habits of mind thus formed, and formed too at a time when new opportunities of wealth and distinction were opening on all sides, inevitably weakened the hold of the ' ancient usage.' Above all, it created something of a revolt against the strict Eoman discipline and the old Eoman traditions of self-effacement, and of 1 Even Cato learnt Greek in his old age, aud the epitaph on N\u00e6vius complains that after his death ' the Romans forgot to speak the Latin tongue ' (Teuffel, 1. c., p. 100).

The desire, characteristic of Greek democracy, for liberty 'to live as one likes,'1 began to show itself in Eome. The great nobles who had conquered kings, or governed wide provinces with regal authority and splendour, could not contentedly fall back into the ranks of Eoman citizens. The new craving for individual distinction exhibited itself in the eagerness with which triumphs were claimed even for victories which had never been wron,2 in the adop tion of high-sounding titles,3 in the largesses heaped upon the people, and in the troops of slaves and dependants with which the nobles filled their halls. The wealthy contractor or financier returned from the provinces -with as little inclination to conform to the simple life of his home-keeping forefathers. Among the lower classes, in Eome at any rate, contact with foreign slaves and freedmen, with foreign worships and foreign vices, produced a love of novelty which no legislation could check. Especially significant were the symptoms of revolt against the old order which now appeared among the women. In a speech delivered against the proposed repeal of the lex Oppia (195 B.C.)

In the next period, indeed, this controversy receded into the background before a struggle in which the supremacy of senate and assembly alike was threatened by foes from without, the legions and the proconsuls.

It was obvious, however, that if this custom were weakened, and the magistrates chose to act independently, the senate was powerless. It might indeed anathematise 2 the refrac tory official, or hamper him if it could by setting in motion against him a colleague or the tribunes, but it could do no more, and these measures, though as a rule effective in the case of magistrates stationed in Eome, failed just where the senate's control was most needed and most difficult to maintain, in its relations with the generals and governors of provinces abroad. The vir tual independence of the proconsul was before 146 B.C. already exciting the jealousy of the senate and endan gering its supremacy.3 Nor again had the senate any legal hold over the assembly.

The right of the people to govern was still valid ; and though it had long lain dormant, any year might see a magistrate in office re solved on recalling the people to a larger share in the conduct of affairs by consulting them rather than the senate, and an assembly bent on the exercise of its lawful prerogatives. And from 167 B.C. at least, onwards, there were in creasing indications that both the acquiescence of the people and the loyalty of the magistrates were failing. The absorbing excitement of the great wars had died away ; the economic and social disturbance and distress which they produced were creating a growing feeling of discontent ; and at the same time the senate pro voked inquiries into its title to govern by its failure any longer to govern well. In the East there was in creasing confusion ; in the West, Viriathus had, single handed, defied the power which had crushed Carthage.

The Hannibalic war had laid waste their fields and thinned their numbers, nor when peace returned to Italy did it bring with it any revival of prosperity. The heavy burden of military service still pressed ruinously upon them,3 and in addition they were called upon to compete with the foreign corn im ported from beyond the sea,4 and with the foreign slave labour purchased by the capital of wealthier men. 1 See generally Mommsen, R.

The small holders went off to follow the eagles or swell the proletariate of the cities, and their holdings were left to run waste or merged in the vineyards, oliveyards, and above all in the great cattle-farms of the rich, while their own place was taken by slaves. The evil was not equally serious in all parts of Italy. It was least felt in the central highlands, in Campania, and in the newly-settled fertile valley of the Po. It was worst in Etruria and in southern Italy ; but everywhere it was serious enough to demand the earnest attention of Eoman statesmen. Of its existence the government had received plenty of warning in the declining numbers of able-bodied males returned at the census,1 in the increasing difficulties of recruiting for the legions,2 in servile outbreaks in Etruria and Apulia.3 And between 200 B.C. and 160 B.C. a good deal was 554-594 attempted by way of remedy. In addition to the foun dation of twenty colonies,4 there were frequent allot ments of land to veteran soldiers, especially in Apulia and Samnium.5 In 180 B.C. 40,000 Ligurians were 574 a.u.c. removed from their homes and settled on vacant lands 1 Beloch, Ital.

The colonies planted in Cisalpine Gaul and in Picenum flourished, but of the others the majority slowly dwindled away, and two required recolonising only eight years after their foundation.3 The veterans who received land were unfitted to make good farmers ; and large numbers, on the first opportunity, gladly re turned as volunteers to a soldier's life. Moreover, after 160 B.C. even these efforts ceased, and with the single exception of the colony of Auximum in Picenum (157 B.C.) nothing was done to check the spread of the evil, until in 133 B.C. Tiberius Gracchus, on his election to the tribunate, set his hand to the work. The new tribune was by 'no means the conventional demagogue. Though a plebeian, he came of a family which had ranked as noble for several generations. His father had been both consul and censor. His mother, Cornelia, was the daughter of Scipio Africanus the elder, and the most accomplished woman of her time. His sister was the wife of the younger Scipio, and he himself married a lady of the great Claudian house. Among his friends were P. Mucius Sc\u00e6vola (consul 133 B.C.) the greatest jurist of his time, and P. Licinius Crassus, an orator, and, like Sc\u00e6vola, learned in the law. Gracchus himself had been carefully educated by his mother. He was a scholar, an eloquent speaker, and had already won a reputation as a soldier and adminis- 1 Livy, xl. 38. - Livy, Epit., xlvi. 3 Sipontum and Buxentum in 186 (Livy, xxxix. 23)."], [209, "The ' public lands.'

His noble birth and connections, his abilities and accomplishments, his high character, all justified the expectation that he would be able to carry through the delicate task of reform which public opinion sum moned him to undertake. The lines on which any attempt to increase the num bers of small landowners in Italy would have to be made were sufficiently clearly marked. To confiscate private land for the purpose was out of the question, to purchase it would have been ruinously expensive. But the Eoman state owned vast domains in Italy. These ' public lands ' were the property of the Eoman people, and intended for their benefit. In fact, however, the greater portion of them was either held in occupation by wealthy men or leased out, chiefly for grazing, to large cattle farmers. To abolish this monopoly of the public lands by a rich minority, and to use them for the advantage of the community was a course for which there was ample precedent. At the very outset of Eome's career of conquest, tribune after tribune had asserted the principle that the right method of dealing with the lands won by conquest was to parcel them out into allotments, and assign them to the poorer citizens.1 The method encouraged agriculture, increased the number of landowners, and helped the poor. But the wealthier citizens had always preferred another and a very different method from that of allotment. In the 1 Livy, iv. 48 : 'ut ager ex hostibus captus viritim divideretur ' ; and ibid. iv. 51. The technical phrases were 'agrum dividere,' 'agrum dare, assignare.'

There was no parcelling out, or assign ing of the land.3 The state remained the owner ; while the squatter was only the possessor. He had no lease, but if he could show that he had ' squatted ' with the permission of the state, he was guaranteed against disturbance.4 This method was probably intended as a means of ' settling up ' lands which were unfit for allotment. But its character gradually altered. It became popular with the rich ; to please them it was applied to other than waste lands ; the occupations increased in size, and the occupiers in many cases, instead of tilling the land, used it for grazing, or even for pleasure-grounds. This monopoly of the state lands by a few wealthy occupiers was rendered more irri tating by the fact that even from the open pastures belonging to the state the poor citizen was gradually excluded by the rich graziers. To meet these evils the Licinian law had forbidden any one person to occupy more than 500 acres, or to turn out on the public 1 Appian, B.

But the Licinian law had not been properly enforced, and of the wide tracts of land acquired by Eome after the Samnite wars, and again after the second Punic war, the greater part had either passed into the occupation of rich nobles, or had been leased for grazing to wealthy companies of cattle and sheep farmers.1 The remedy proposed by Gracchus 2 amounted in The pro effect to the resumption by the state of as much of the Tiberius ' common land ' as was not held in occupation by author- Gracchus ised persons and conformably to the provisions of the Licinian law. Unauthorised occupiers were to be evicted ; in other cases the occupation was reduced to a maximum size of 1000 acres.3 The land thus rescued for the community from the monopoly of a few was to be distributed in allotments,4 and a commission of three men was created for the double purpose of decid ing what land should be taken, and of carrying out the work of allotment.5 It was a scheme which could quote 1 The extensive grazing-grounds (saltus publici) in Samnium and Apulia were mostly leased to 'pecuarii.' 2 Plut., T.

Of the causes which led to its ultimate failure something -will be said later on ; for the present we must turn to the constitutional conflict which it pro voked. The senate from the first identified itself with the interests of the wealthy occupiers, and Tiberius found himself forced into a struggle with the senate, which had been no part of his original plan. He fell back on the legislative sovereignty of the people ; he resuscitated the half-forgotten powers of interference vested in the tribunate in order to paralyse the action of the senatorial magistrates, and finally lost his life in an attempt to make good one of the weak points in the tribune's position by securing his own re-election for a second year. But the conflict did not end with his death. It was renewed on a wider scale, and with a more deliberate aim, by his brother Gaius, who on his election to the tribunate (123 B.C.) at once came forward as the avowed enemy of the senate. The latter sud denly found its control of the administration threatened at a variety of points. On the invitation of the popular tribune the assembly proceeded to restrict the senate's freedom of action in assigning the provinces.1 It regu lated the taxation of the province of Asia 2 and altered the conditions of military service.3 In home affairs it inflicted two serious blows on the senate's authority by declaring the summary punishment of Eoman citizens i Lex Sempronia de provinces consularibus ; Cic. pro Domo, 9 ; de Prov.

The Latins and Italians had opposed an agrarian scheme which took from them land Which they had come to regard as rightfully theirs, and gave them no share in the benefit of the allotments.3 Gaius not only removed this latter grievance,4 but ardently supported and himself brought forward the first proposals made in Eome for their enfranchisement.5 The indifference of the city populace, to whom the prospect of small hold ings in a remote district of Italy was not a tempting one, was overcome by the establishment of regular monthly doles of corn at a low price.6 Finally, the men of business \u2014 the publicani, merchants, and money lenders \u2014 were conciliated by the privilege granted to them of collecting the tithes of the new province of Asia, and placed in direct rivalry with the senate by the i Pint., C.

The controversy in future turned, not on the right of the poor citizens to the state lands, but on the expediency of purchasing other lands for distribution at the cost of the treasury.1 But though the agrarian reform failed, the political con flict it had provoked continued, and the lines on which it was waged were in the main those laid down by Gaius Gracchus. The sovereignty of the people continued to be the watchword of the popular party, and a free use of the plebeian machinery perfected during the old struggle betwreen the orders, of the tribunate of the plebs and the ' concilium plebis,' remained the most effective means of securing their aims. At the same time the careers of both Tiberius and Gaius had illus trated the weak points in this machinery \u2014 the uncer tain temper and varying composition of the assembly, the limited tenure of office enjoyed by the tribunes,2 the possibility of disunion within their own body, and lastly, the difficulty of keeping together the divergent interests which Gaius had for a moment united in hostility to the senate.

The course of affairs in the client state of Numidia since Micipsa's death in 118 B.C. had been such as to discredit a stronger government than that of the senate.1 In open defiance of Eoman authority, and relying on the influence of his own well-spent gold, Jugurtha had murdered both his legitimate rivals, Hiempsal and Adherbal, and made himself master of Numidia. The declaration of war wrung from the senate (112 B.C.) by popular indignation had been fol lowed by the corruption of a consul2 (111 B.C.) and the crushing defeat of the proconsul Albinus.3 On the news of this crowning disgrace the storm burst, and on the proposal of the tribunes a commission of inquiry was appointed into the conduct of the war.4 But the popular leaders did not stop here. C\u00e6cilius Metellus, who as consul (109 B.C.) had succeeded to the com mand in Numidia, was an able soldier but a rigid aristo crat ; and they now resolved to improve their success by intrusting the command instead to a genuine son of the people. Their choice fell on Gaius Marius, an experienced officer and administrator, but a man of humble birth, from the old Volscian town of Arpinum, wholly illiterate, and who, though no politician, was by temperament and training a hater of the polished and effeminate nobles who filled the senate.5 He was 1 Sallust, Jug. , 5 sq. ; Livy, Epit. , lxii. lxiv. 2 Calpurnius Bestia ; Sail., Jug., 28. 3 Ib., 38, 39. * Ib., 40. 5 Ib., 63 ; Plut., Marius, 2, 3.

The Cimbri and Teutones were at the gates of Italy ; they had four times defeated the senatorial generals, and Marius was called upon to save Eome from a second invasion of the barbarians.3 After two years of suspense the victory at Aqu\u00e6 Sexti\u00e6 (102 B.C.), followed by that on 652 a.u.c the Eaudine plain (101 B.C.), put an end to the danger 653 a.u.c by the annihilation of the invading hordes ; and Marius, now consul for the fifth time, returned to Eome in triumph. There the popular party welcomed him as a leader, and as one who would bring to their aid the imperium of the consul and all the prestige of a suc cessful general. Once more, however, they were des tined to a brief success, followed by disastrous defeat. Marius became for the sixth time consul ; 4 of the two popular leaders Glaucia became pr\u00e6tor and Saturninus tribune.

Their recklessness and violence had alienated all classes in Eome ; and their period of office w-as drawing to a close.

The popular party had been worsted once more in their struggle with the senate, but none the less their alliance with Marius, and the position in which their votes placed him, marked an epoch in the history of the revolution. The six consulships of Marius repre sented not merely a party victory but a protest against the system of divided and rapidly-changing commands, which was, no doubt, the system favoured by the senate, but was also an integral element of the repub lican constitution ; and in assailing it the populares weakened the republic even more than they irritated the senate.

The consequences were already foreshadowed by the special provisions made by Saturninus for Marius's veterans, and in the active part taken by the latter in the passing of his laws. Indirectly, too, Marius, though no politician, played an important part in this new de parture. His military reforms 1 at once democratised the army and attached it more closely to its leader for the time being. He swept away the last traces of civil distinctions cf rank or wealth within the legion, ad mitted to its ranks all classes, and substituted volun tary enlistment under a popular general for the old fashioned compulsory levy. The efficiency of the legion was increased at the cost of a complete severance of the ties which bound it to the civil community -and to the civil authorities. The defeat of Saturninus was followed by several years of quiet ; nor was the next important crisis pro voked directly by any efforts of the discredited popular party. It was due partly to the rivalry which had been growing more bitter each year between the senate and the commercial class ; and secondly, to the long impending question of the enfranchisement of the Italian allies. The publicani, negotiatores, and others, who constituted what was now becoming known as the equestrian order, had made unscrupulous use of their 1 Sallust, Jug., 86 : ' ipse interea milites scribere, non more majorum neque ex classibus, sed uti cujusque cupido erat, capite censos plerosque.'

The threat of prosecution before a hostile jury was held over the head of every governor, legate, and qu\u00e6stor who ventured to interfere with their operations. The average official preferred to con nive at their exactions ; the bolder ones paid with fines and even exile for their courage. In 93 B.C. the neces sity for a reform was proved beyond a doubt by the scandalous condemnation of F. Eutilius Eufus, : osten sibly on a charge of extortion, in reality as the reward of his efforts to check the extortions of the Eoman publicani in Asia. The need of reform was clear, but it was not so easy to carry a reform which would certainly be opposed by the whole strength of the equestrian order, and which, as involving the repeal of a Sempronian law, would arouse the resentment of the popular party. The diffi culties of the Italian question were more serious. That the Italian allies were discontented was notorious. After nearly two centuries of close alliance, of common dangers and victories, they now eagerly coveted as a boon that complete amalgamation with Eome which they had at first resented as a dishonour. But, unfortunately, Eome had grown more selfishly exclusive in proportion as the value set upon Eoman citizenship increased. The politic liberality with which the franchise had once been granted had disappeared. The allies found their burdens increasing and their ancient privileges diminish ing, while the resentment with which they viewed their 1 Livy, Epit., lxx. ; Veil.

On each occasion they had crowded to Eome, full of eager expectation, only to be harshly ejected from the city by the consul's orders.2 The justice of their claims could hardly be denied, the danger of con tinuing to ignore them was obvious, yet the difficulties in the way of granting them were formidable in the extreme. The temper of senate and people alike was still jealously exclusive ; and from a higher than a merely selfish point of view there was much to be said against the revolution involved in so sudden and enor mous an enlargement of the citizen body. Marcus Livius Drusus, who as tribune gallantly took Marcus up the task of reform, is claimed by Cicero 3 as a D'rvu'sus, 91 member of that party of the centre to which he BC- r J 663 A.U.C belonged himself.

His proposal to reform the law courts excited the equestrian order and their friends in the senate to fury.

His laws were carried, but the senate pronounced them null and void.2 Drusus was de nounced in the senate-house as a traitor, and on his way home was struck down by the hand of an unknown assassin. The knights retained their monopoly of the courts, but this and all other domestic controversies were silenced for the time by the news which followed hard upon the murder of Drusus that the Italians were in open revolt against Eome. His assassination was the signal for an outbreak which had been secretly pre pared for some time before. Throughout the high lands of central and southern Italy the flower of the Italian peoples rose as one man.3 Etruria and Umbria held aloof ; the isolated Latin colonies stood firm ; but the Sabellian clans north and south, the Latinised 1 For the provisions of the 'leges Livi\u00e6,' see App., B.

No time was lost in proclaiming their plans for the future. A new Italian state was to be formed. The P\u00e6lignian town of Corfinium was selected as its capital and re christened with the proud name of Italica. All Italians were to be citizens of this new metropolis, and here were to be the place of assembly and the senate-house. A senate of 500 members and a magistracy resembling that of Eome completed a constitution which adhered closely to the very political traditions which its authors had most reason to abjure. Now, as always in the face of serious danger, the action of Eome was prompt and resolute. Both consuls took the field ; ' with each were five legates, among them the veteran Marius and his destined rival L. Cornelius Sulla, and even freedmen were pressed into service with the legions. But the first year's campaign opened disastrously. In central Italy the northern Sabellians, and in the south the Samnites, defeated the forces opposed to them. And though before the end of the year Marius and Sulla in the north, and the consul C\u00e6sar himself in Campania, succeeded in in flicting .severe blows on the enemy, and on the Marsi especially, it is not surprising that, with an empty treasury, with the insurgents' strength still unbroken, and with rumours of disaffection in the loyal districts, opinion in Eome should have turned in the direction of the more liberal policy which had been so often scornfully rejected, and in favour of some compromise i App., B.

Towards the close of the year 90 B.C. the consul C\u00e6sar carried the 'lex Julia,'1 by which the Eoman franchise was offered to all communities which had not as yet revolted ; early in the next year (89 B.C.) the Julian law was supplemented by the ' lex Plautia Papiria,' introduced by two of the tribunes, which enacted that any citizen of an allied community then domiciled in Italy might obtain the franchise by giving in his name to a pr\u00e6tor in Eome within sixty days. A third law (lex Cal purnia), apparently passed at the same time, empowered Eoman magistrates in the field to bestow the franchise there and then upon all who wel-e willing to receive it. This sudden opening of the closed gates of Eoman citizenship was completely successful, and its effects were at once visible in the diminished vigour of the insurgents. By the end of 89 B.C. the Samnites and Lucanians were left alone in - their obstinate hostility to Eome, and neither, thanks to Sulla's brilliant cam paign in Samnium, had for the moment any strength left for active aggression. The enfranchisement of Italy was an accomplished fact, though the exact status of the new citizens was not settled until a few years later. Politically, Italy ceased to be a confederacy under Eoman leadership, and the Italian allies of Eome entered as municipalities within the pale of the Eoman state.

It emphasised the absurdity of a system which treated the nobles and plebs of the city of Eome as the representatives of the Eoman people, and which con demned the great mass of that people to a virtual exclusion from politics. Between the new citizens in the country towns and districts, and those in Eome, a coolness sprang up. The contempt with which the latter regarded the ' municipales ' and ' rustici ' was repaid by a growing indifference on the other side to the traditions and institutions of a narrow polity in which they had only a nominal place, and by a grow ing mistrust of Eoman politicians and politics. When the crisis came even Cicero's influence failed to excite among them any enthusiasm for the republican cause. Meanwhile the termination of the Social War brought with it no peace in Eome. The old quarrels were renewed with increased bitterness, while the newly enfranchised Italians themselves resented as bitterly the restriction,1 which robbed them of their due share of political influence by allowing them to vote only in a specified number of tribes. The senate itself was distracted by violent personal rivalries, and all these feuds, animosities, and grievances were aggravated by the widespread economic distress and ruin which affected all classes.2 Lastly, war with Mithradates had i Veil.

Cornelius Sulla.1 It was in an atmosphere thus charged with the elements of disturbance that P. Sulpicius Eufus as tribune 2 brought forward his laws. He proposed \u2014 (1) that the command of the Mithradatic war should be given to Marius, (2) that the new citizens should be distributed through all the tribes, (3) that the freedmen should no longer be confined to the four city tribes, (4) that any senator owing more than 2000 denarii should lose his seat, (5) that those exiled on suspicion of complicity with the Italian revolt should be recalled. Whatever may have been Sulpicius's intentions, these proposals inevitably provoked a storm. The old voters bitterly resented the swamping of the existing constituency ; the senate rallied its forces to oppose the alteration in the franchise of the freedmen and the proposed purging of its own ranks ; and lastly, both the senate and Sulla himself, now one of the consuls, prepared to resist the transference of the Asiatic command to Marius. Both sides were ominously ready for violent measures. The consuls, in order to prevent legislation, proclaimed a public holiday.3 Sulpicius replied by arming his followers 1 It had been already declared a consular province for 87, and early in 88 seems to have been assigned to Sulla by decree of the senate. 2 Cf.

The pro clamation was withdrawn and the laws carried, but Sulpicius's triumph was short-lived. From Nola in Campania, where lay the legions commanded by him in the Social War, Sulla advanced on Eome, and for the first time a Eoman consul entered the city at the head of the legions of the republic. Eesistance was hopeless. Marius and Sulpicius fled,1 and Sulla, sum moning the assembly of the centuries, proposed the measures he considered necessary for the public security, the most important being a provision that the sanction of the senate should be necessary before any proposal was introduced to the assembly.2 Then, after waiting in Eome long enough to hold the con sular elections, he left for Greece early in 87 B.C. 667 a.u.c. Sulla had conquered, but his victory cost the Marius and republic dear. He had first taught political partisans mna' to look for final success, not to a majority of votes in the forum or campus, but to the swords of the soldiery ; and he had shown that the legions, composed as they now were, could be trusted to regard nothing but the commands of a favourite leader. The lesson was well learnt. Shortly after his departure, Cinna as consul revived the proposals of Sulpicius ; 3 his colleague Octavius at the head of an armed force fell upon the policy. Cf. Cicero ad Q. F., ii. 4, 4: 'dies comitiales e.xeniit omnes . . .

When the senate declared him deposed from his consulship, he replied by invoking- the aid of the soldiers in Campania on behalf of the violated rights of the people and the injured dignity of the consul ship, and, like Sulla, found them ready to follow where he led. The neighbouring Italian communities, which had lost many citizens in the recent massacre, sent their new champion men and money ; 2 while from Africa, whither he had escaped after Sulla's entry into Eome, came Marius with 1000 Numidian horsemen. He landed in Etruria, where his old veterans flocked to his standard, and at the head of some 6000 men joined Cinna before the gates of Eome. The senate had prepared for a desperate defence, but fortune was adverse, and after a brief resistance they gave way. Cinna was acknowledged as consul, the sentence of outlawry passed on Marius was revoked, and Cinna and Marius entered Eome with their troops. Marius's thirst for revenge was gratified by a frightful massacre, and he lived long enough to be nominated consul for the seventh time. But he held his consulship only a few weeks. Early in 86 B.C. he died, and for the next three years Cinna ruled Eome. Constitutional govern ment was virtually suspended. For 85 B.c and 84 B.C.

The attention of Cinna and his friends was in truth en grossed by the ever-present dread of Sulla's return from Asia. The consul of 86 B.C., Valerius Flaccus, sent out 668 a.u.c to supersede him, was murdered by his own soldiers at Nicomedia.5 In 85 B.C.Sulla, though disowned by 669 a.u.c his government, concluded a peace with Mithradates.6 In 84 B.C., after settling affairs in Asia and crushing Flaccus's successor Fimbria, he crossed into Greece, The return and in the spring of 83 B.C. landed at Brundusium g3 Buc a' with 40,000 soldiers and a large following of emigre 67lADX nobles.

The decisive battle was fought under the walls of the city, and ended in the complete defeat of the Marians and Italians.1 For a period of nearly ten years Eome and Italy had been distracted by civil war. Constitutional govern ment, whether by senate or assembly, had been in abeyance, while the opposing parties fought out their quarrels with the sword, under the leadership of generals at the head of legions ready and willing to follow them against their fellow-citizens and against established authorities of the state.

The re- establishment on a legal basis of the ascendency which custom had so long accorded to the senate was his main object. With this purpose he had already, when consul in 88 B.C., made the ' senatus auctoritas ' 666 a.u.c legally necessary for proposals to the assembly. He now as dictator 2 followed this up by crippling the power of the magistracy, which had been the most effective weapon in the hands of the senate's opponents. The legislative freedom of the tribunes was already ham- pered by the necessity of obtaining the senate's sanc- tion ; in addition, Sulla restricted their wide powers of interference (intercessio) to their original purpose of protecting individual plebeians,3 and discredited the office by prohibiting a tribune from holding any sub- sequent magistracy in the state.4 The control of the courts (qu\u0153stiones perpetu\u0153) was taken from the eques trian order and restored to the senate.5 To prevent the people from suddenly installing and keeping in 1 See especially Cicero's oration pro Tullio.

Lastly, he replaced the pontifical and augural colleges in the hands of the senatorial nobles, by enacting that vacancies in them should, as before the lex Domitia (104 B.C.), be filled up by co-optation.5 This policy of deliberately alter- ing the constitution, so as to make it pronounce in favour of his own party, was open to two grave objections. It was not to be expected that the new legal safeguards would protect the senate any more efficiently than the established custom and tradition 1 App., B. C, i. 100; cf. Livy, vii. 42 (342 B.C.) : 'ne quis eundem magistratum infra decem annos caperet.' - The custom had gradually established itself. Cf. Livy, xxxii. 7.

The qu\u00e6storship henceforward carried with it the right to be called up to the senate. By increasing the number of qu\u00e6stors, Sulla provided for the supply of ordinary vacancies in the senate and restricted the censors' freedom of choice in filling them up.

Still less was Sulla successful in fortifying the republican system against the dangers which menaced it from without. He accepted as an accomplished fact the enfranchisement of the Italians, but he made no provision to guard against the consequent reduction of the comitia to an absurdity, and with them of the civic government which rested upon them,1 or to organise an effective administrative system for the Italian communities.2 Of all men, too, Sulla had the best reason to appreciate the dangers to be feared from the growing independ ence of governors and generals in the provinces, and from the transformation of the old civic militia into a group of professional armies, devoted only to a suc cessful leader, and with the weakest possible sense of allegiance to the state. He had himself, as proconsul of Asia, contemptuously and successfully defied the home government, and he, more than any other Eoman general, had taught his soldiers to look only to their 1 He did propose to deprive several communities which had joined Cinna of the franchise, but the deprivation was not carried into effect ; Cic. pro Domo, 30, and pro C\u00e6eina, 33, 35. The inadequacy of the comitia, as representative of the real ' populus Romanus,' was increased by the unequal manner in which the new citizens had been distributed among the old thirty-five tribes. Though each tribe had one vote and no more, in some cases the tribe represented only a small thinly populated district of the Campagna, with the addition of one or two outlying Italian communities, in others it included large and populous territories.

The desire to play the Sulla, to do what Sulla had done, was at least attributed to M. \u00c6milius Lepidus, to Pompey, and to C\u00e6sar, and Sulla's example gave a new and dangerous turn to the personal ambition of powerful 1 Sail., Cat., ii. : ' L. Sulla exercitum, quo sibi fidum faceret, contra morem majorum luxuriose nimisque liberaliser habuerat.' 2 There was a ' le.x Cornelia de provinciis ordinandis,' but only two of its provisions are known : \u2014 (1) that a magistrate sent out with the imperium should retain it till he re-entered the city (Cic ad Fam., i. 9. 25), a provision which increased rather than diminished his free- dom of action ; (2) that an outgoing governor should leave his pro- vince within thirty days after his successor's arrival (Cic. ad Fam., iii. 6. 4). A 'lex Cornelia de majestate' contained, it is true, a definition of treason evidently framed in the light of recent experience. The magistrate was forbidden ' exire de provincia, educere exercitum, bellum sua sponte gerere, in regnum injussu populi ac senatus accedere,' Cic. in Pis., 21. Sulla also added one more to the long list of laws dealing with extortion in the provinces. But the danger lay, not in the want of laws, but in the want of security for their observance by an ab- solutely autocratic proconsul. I cannot agree with those who would include among Sulla's laws one retaining consuls and pr\u00e6tors in Rome for their year of office and then sending them out to a province. This was becoming the common practice before 81. After 81 it was invari- able for pr\u00e6tors, as needed for judicial work, and invariable but for two exceptions in the case of consuls ; nowhere, however, is there a hint that there had been any legislation on the subject, and there are indi- cations that it was convenience and not law which maintained the arrangement.

In 73 B.C. Spartacus,1 a Thracian slave, escaped with seventy others from a gladiators' training-school at Capua. In an incredibly short time he found himself at the head of a numerous force of runaway slaves, outlaws, brigands, and impoverished peasants. By the end of 73 B.C. he had 70,000 men under his command, had twice defeated the Eoman trodps, and was master of southern Italy. In 72 B.C. he advanced on Eome, but, though he again routed the legions led against him by the consuls in person, he abandoned his scheme and established himself in the now desolate country near Thurii, already the natural home of brigandage. At length, in 71 B.C., the pr\u00e6tor Crassus, who had been sent against him with no less than six legions, ended the war. Spartacus was defeated and slain in Apulia. In Eome itself the various classes and parties hostile to the Sullan system had, ever since Sulla's death in 78 B.C., been incessantly agitating for the repeal of his most obnoxious laws, and needed only a leader in order successfully to attack a government discredited by failure at home and abroad. With the return of Pompey from Spain their opportunity came. Pompey, who understood politics as little as Marius, was anxious to obtain, what the senate was more than likely to refuse to give him, and what he was not 1 App., i. 116 ; Livy, Epit, xcv. ; Plut., Crass., 8 sq."], [241, "Ch. 2.] THE FIRST CONSULSHIP OF POMPEY 219 legally entitled to, a triumph, the consulship for the next year (70 B.C.), and as the natural consequence of 684 a.u.c this an important command in the East. The opposi tion wanted his name and support, and a bargain was soon struck. Pompey, and with him Marcus Crassus, the conqueror of Spartacus, were elected consuls, almost in presence of their troops, which lay encamped outside the gates in readiness to assist at the triumph and ovation granted to their respective leaders. Pompey lost no time in performing his part of the agreement. The tribunes regained their prerogatives.1 The ' per petual courts ' were taken out of the hands of the senatorial judices, who had outdone the equestrian order in scandalous corruption,2 and finally the censors, the first since 86 B.C., purged the senate of the more worthless and disreputable of Sulla's partisans.3 The victory was complete ; but its chief significance for the future lay in the clearness with which it showed that the final decision in matters political lay with neither of the two great parties in Eome, but with the holder of the military authority. The tribunes of the plebs were no longer, as the Gracchi had been, political 1 The exact provisions of Pompey's law are nowhere given ; Livy, Epit, xcvii. : ' tribuniciam potestatem restituerunt.'

The most prominent and active of them, Gabinius, Manilius, Clodius, and the younger Curio, were little more than the lieutenants of this or that great military leader, using their recovered powers to thwart his opponents in the senate, or to carry measures on his behalf through the assembly. The change was fatal to the dignity of politics in the city. In propor tion as the mass of the Eoman community in Italy, and able aspirants to power, like C\u00e6sar, became con scious of the unreality of the old constitutional contro versies, they became indifferent to the questions which agitated the forum and the curia, and contemptuously ready to alter or disregard the constitution itself, when it stood in the way of interests nearer to their hearts. Of this growing indifference to the traditional politics of the republic, against which Cicero struggled in vain, Pompey is an excellent example. He was absolutely without interest in them, except in so far as they led up to important military commands, and, though he was never revolutionary in intention, his own career, in its quiet defiance of all the established rules of the constitution, did almost more than the direct attacks of others to render the republic impossible. When his consulship ended, Pompey impatiently awaited at the hands of the politicians he had be friended the further gift of a foreign command. He declined an ordinary province, and from the end of 70 B.C. to 67 B.C. he remained at Eome in a somewhat affectedly dignified seclusion.1 But, as before in the case of Marius, a crisis abroad now opened the way 1 Velleius ii. 31 ; Plut.

The ravages of the Cilician pirates, encouraged, in the first instance, by the inactivity which had marked Eoman policy in the East after 167 B.C., and by the absence of any effective Eoman navy in the Mediterranean, had now risen to an intolerable height, and the spasmodic efforts made since 81 B.C. had done little to check them. The trade of the Mediterranean was paralysed, and even the coasts of Italy were not safe from their raids.1 Aulus Gabinius, a tribune, and a follower of Pompey, now proposed (67 B.C.) to the people to intrust 6S7a.u.c. Pompey with the sole command against the pirates.2 His command was to last for three years. He was to have supreme authority over all Eoman magistrates in the provinces throughout the Mediterranean and over the coasts for fifty miles inland. Fifteen legati, all of pr\u00e6torian rank, were assigned to him, with two hun dred ships, and as many troops as he thought desirable. These powers were still further enlarged in the next year by the Manilian law (66 B.C.), which transferred 688 a.u.c. from Lucullus and Glabrio to Pompey the conduct of the Mithradatic war in Asia, and with it the entire control of Eoman policy and interests in the East.3 The unrepublican character of the position thus granted to Pompey, and the dangers of the precedent i See the brilliant sketch by Mommsen, R.

Pompey left Eome in 67 B.C., and did not return to Italy till towards the end of 62 B.C. The interval was marked in Eome by the rise to political importance of C\u00e6sar and Cicero, and by Catiline's attempt at revolu tion. When in 70 B.C. the removal of the restrictions placed upon the tribunate restored to the popular party their old weapons of attack, C\u00e6sar was already a marked man. In addition to his patrician birth, and his reputation for daring and ability, he possessed, as the nephew of Marius and the son-in-law of Cinna, a strong hereditary claim to the leadership of the popular and Marian party. He had already taken part in the agitation for the restoration of the tribunate ; he had supported the Manilian law; and, when Pompey's withdrawal left the field clear for other competitors, he stepped at once into the front rank on the popular side.1 He took upon himself, as their nearest repre sentative, the task of clearing the memory and aveng ing the wrongs of the great popular leaders, Marius, Cinna, and Saturninus.

He en deavoured to bring to justice, not only the ringleaders in Sulla's bloody work of proscription, but even the murderers of Saturninus, and vehemently pleaded the cause of the children of the proscribed. While thus carrying on in genuine Eoman fashion the feud of his family, he attracted the sympathies of the Italians by his efforts to procure the Eoman franchise for the Latin communities beyond the Po, and won the affec tions of the populace in Eome and its immediate neigh bourhood by the splendour of the games which he gave as curule \u00e6dile (65 B.C.), and by his lavish expenditure 689 a.u.c upon the improvement of the Appian Way. But it is characteristic of C\u00e6sar and of his time that these measures were with him only means to the further end of creating for himself a position such as that which Pompey had already won ; and this ulterior aim he pursued with a skill and with an audacious indifference to constitutional forms and usages unsurpassed even by Sulla. His coalition with Crassus, soon after Pompey's departure, secured him an ally whose colossal wealth and wide financial connections were of in estimable value, and whose vanity and inferiority of intellect rendered him a willing tool.

A ' municipal' himself, his chosen friends and his warmest supporters were found among the well-to-do classes in the Italian towns.1 Unpopular with the Eoman aristo- cracy, who despised him as a ' peregrinus,' 2 and with the Eoman populace, he was the trusted leader of the Italian middle class, 'the true Eoman people,' as he proudly styles them.

He represented their antipathy 705 a.u.c alike to socialistic schemes and to aristocratic exclusive- ness, and their old-fashioned simplicity of life in con- trast with the cosmopolitan luxury of the capital.5 By birth, too, he belonged to the equestrian order, the fore- most representatives of which were indeed still the publicani and negotiatores, but which, since the en franchisement of Italy, included also the substantial burgesses of the Italian towns and the smaller ' squires ' i Cic. ad AU., i. 491 : 'locupletes . . . noster exercitus.' 2 Cic. pro Sulla, 7 ; Sail, Cat, 31 : 'inquilinus urbis Rom\u00e6.' 3 See the De Petitione Consulatus, passim. 4 De Domo, 28 ; pro Plancio, 97. 5 Cic. pro Quinctio, 31 ; pro Cluentio, 46, 153. 1'"], [248, "226 HISTORY OF ROME [Book iv. of the country districts. With them, too, Cicero was at one in their dread of democratic excesses and their social and political jealousy of the 'nobiles.'1 Lastly, as a lawyer and a scholar he was passionately attached to the ancient constitution. His political ideal was the natural outcome of these circumstances of his position. He advocated the maintenance of the old constitution, but not as it was understood by the extreme politi cians of the right and left. The senate was to be the supreme directing council,2 but the senate of Cicero's dreams was not an oligarchic assemblage of nobles, but a body freely open to all citizens, and representing the worth of the community.3 The magistrates, while de ferring to the senate's authority, were to be at once vigorous and public-spirited ; and the assembly itself which elected the magistrates and passed the laws was to consist, not of the ' mob of the forum,' but of the true Eoman people throughout Italy.4 For the realisa tion of this ideal he looked, above all things, to the establishment of cordial relations between the senate and nobles in Eome and the great middle class of Italy represented by the equestrian order, between the capital and the country towns and districts. This was the 'concordia ordinum,' the 'consensus Itali\u00e6' for which he laboured.5 He failed because his ideal was impracticable.

He defeated the insidious proposals of Eullus for C\u00e6sar's aggrandisement, and assisted in quashing the prosecution of Eabirius. But with the consular elections in the autumn of 63 B.C. a fresh danger arose from a different quarter. The ' conspiracy x of Catiline ' was not the work of the popular party, and still less was it an unselfish attempt at reform ; L. Sergius Catilina himself was a patrician, who had held high office, and possessed considerable ability and courage ; but he was bankrupt in character and in purse, and two successive defeats in the consular elections had rendered him desperate.

The danger to be feared from his intrigues lay in the state of Italy, which made a revolt against society and the established government only too likely if once a leader presented himself, and it was such a revolt that Catiline endea voured to organise. Bankrupt nobles like himself, Sullan veterans and the starving peasants whom they had dis possessed of their holdings, outlaws of every descrip tion, the slave population of Eome, and the wilder herdsmen-slaves of the Apulian pastures, were all enlisted under his banner, and attempts were even made to excite disaffection among the newly-conquered peoples of southern Gaul and the warlike tribes who still cherished the memory of Sertorius in Spain. In Etruria, the seat and centre of agrarian distress and discontent, a rising actually took place, headed by a Sullan centurion, but the spread of the revolt was checked by Cicero's vigorous measures. Catiline fled from Eome, and died fighting with desperate courage at the head of his motley force of old soldiers, peasants, and slaves. His accomplices in Eome were arrested, and, after an unavailing protest from C\u00e6sar, the senate authorised the consuls summarily to put them to death. The Catilinarian outbreak had been a blow to C\u00e6sar, whose schemes it interrupted. To Cicero, however, it brought not only popularity and honour, but, as he believed, the realisation of his political ideal.

But Pompey was now on his way home after successes Return of more brilliant and dazzling than had fallen to the lot fr\u00b0\u2122P2gia of any Eoman general since the great wars. In a marvellously short space of time he had freed the Mediterranean from the Cilician pirates, and established Eoman authority in Cilicia itself. He had crushed Mithridates, added Syria to the list of Eoman provinces, and led the Eoman legions to the Upper Euphrates and the Caspian. Once more, as in 70 B.C., the political future seemed to depend on the attitude which the successful general would assume ; Pompey himself looked simply to the attainment by the help of one political party or another of his immediate aims, which at present were the ratification of his arrangements in Asia and a grant of land for his troops. It was the impracticable jealousy of his personal rivals in the senate, aided by the versatility of C\u00e6sar, who presented himself not as his rival but as his ally, which drove Pompey once coalition of more, in spite of Cicero's efforts, into the camp of what c\u00b0\u2122^and was still nominally the popular party.

The wealth and influence of Crassus were enlisted in the same cause, but what he was to receive in exchange is not clear. Cicero was under no illusions as to the significance of this coalition. It scattered to the winds his dreams of a stable and conservative republic. Pompey, whom he had hoped to enlist as the champion of constitutional government, had been driven into the arms of C\u00e6sar. The union between the senate and the equestrian order had been dissolved, and the support of the publicani lost by an untimely quarrel over the price to be paid for collecting the taxes of Asia, and, to crown all, both his own personal safety and the authority of the senate were threatened by the openly avowed intentions of Catiline's friends to bring the consul of 63 B.C. to account for his unconstitutional execution of Catiline's accomplices. His fears were fully justified by the results. The year 59 B.C. saw the republic power less in the hands of three citizens. C\u00e6sar as consul procured the ratification of Pompey's acts in Asia, conciliated the publicani by granting them the relief refused by the senate, and carried an agrarian law of the new type, which provided for the purchase of lands for allotment at the cost of the treasury, and for the assignment of the rich ' ager Campanus.' 1 But C\u00e6sar aimed at more than the carrying of an agrarian law in the teeth of the senate or any party victory in the forum. An important military command was essential 1 For the ' lex Julia agraria ' and the ' lex Campana,' see Dio Cass., xxxviii. 1 ; App., B.

An obedient tribune was found, and by the lex Vatinia he was given for five years the command of Cisalpine Gaul and Illyricum, to which was added by a decree of the senate Transalpine Gaul also.1 It was a command which not only opened to him a great military career, but enabled him, as the master of the valley of the Po, to keep an effective watch on the course of affairs in Italy. Early the next year the attack upon himself which Banishment o j 1 1 1 rppftll of Cicero had foreseen was made. P.

Cicero, finding himself deserted even by Pompey, left Eome in a panic, and by a second Clodian law he was declared to be outlawed.2 With C\u00e6sar away in his province, and Cicero banished, Clodius was for the time master in Eome. But, absolute as he was in the streets, and recklessly as he parodied the policy of the Gracchi by violent attacks on the senate, his tribunate merely illustrated the anarchy which now inevitably followed the withdrawal of a strong controlling hand.

Pompey, bewildered and alarmed by Clodius's violence, at last bestirred himself. Cicero's recall was decreed by the senate, and early in August 57 B.C., in the comitia centuriata, to which his Italian supporters flocked in crowds, a law was passed revoking the sentence of outlawry passed upon him. Intoxicated by the acclamations which greeted him, and encouraged by Pompey's support, and by the salu tary effects of Clodius's excesses, Cicero's hopes rose high, and a return to the days of 63 B.C. seemed not impossible.1 With indefatigable energy he strove to reconstruct a solid constitutional party, but only to fail once more. Pompey was irritated by the hostility of a powerful party in the senate, who thwarted his desires for a fresh command, and even encouraged Clodius in insulting the conqueror of the East. C\u00e6sar became alarmed at the reports which reached him that the repeal of his agrarian law was threatened, and that the feeling against the coalition was growing in strength; above all, he was anxious for a renewal of his five years' command. He acted at once, and in the celebrated conference at Luca (56 B.C.) the alliance of the three self-constituted rulers of Eome was renewed. Cicero succumbed to the inevitable, and withdrew in despair from public life. Pompey and Crassus became consuls for 55 B.C.

Conscious of its own helplessness, the senate, with the eager assent of all respectable citizens, dissuaded Pompey from leaving Italy. His provinces were left to his legates, and he himself remained at home to maintain order by the weight of his influence. It was a confession that the republic could not stand alone. But Pompey's mere presence proved insufficient. The anarchy and confusion grew worse, and even strict constitutionalists like Cicero talked of the necessity of investing Pompey with some extraordinary powers for the preservation of order.2 At last, in 52 B.C., he was pompeysoie elected sole consul ; and not only so, but his provincial IT^A' command was prolonged for five years more, and fresh 702 a.u.c troops were assigned him.3 The role of ' saviour of 1 Livy, Epit, cv.; Dio Cass., xxxix. 31.

It was known that the latter, whose command expired in March 49 B.C., but who in the ordinary course of things would not have been replaced by his successor until January 48 B.C., was anxious to be allowed to stand for his second consulship in the autumn of 49 B.C. without coming in person to Eome.1 His opponents in the senate were equally bent on bringing his command to an end at the legal time, and so obliging him to disband his troops and stand for the consulship as a private person, or, if he kept his command, on preventing his standing for the consulship. Through 51 B.C. and 50 B.C. the discussions in the senate and the negotiations with C\u00e6sar continued, but with no result. On 1st January 49 B.C. C\u00e6sar made a last offer of compromise. The senate replied by requiring him on pain of outlawry to disband his legions. Two tribunes who supported him were ejected from the senate-house, and the magistrates with Pompey were authorised to take measures to protect the republic.

The external history of Eome during the period covered by the two preceding chapters forms an instructive commentary on the course of domestic politics. The inadequacy of the old machinery to administer successfully the affairs of an empire was amply proved by the repeated disasters for which the incapacity or inexperience of the Eoman generals was mainly responsible, by the insurrections which the exactions of Eoman officials provoked, and by the financial exhaustion which maladministration produced even in such wealthy provinces as Sicily and Asia. On the other hand, the policy which the popular leaders favoured as a ready means of thwarting the senate, that of concentrating a wide executive authority in the hands of a single man specially designated by vote of the people, was justified by the brilliant achievements of Marius, Pompey, and C\u00e6sar. At the same time, the position which such men were thus enabled to attain was fraught with danger, not only to senatorial ascendency, and to the system of divided autho rity, and changing magistrates bound up with it, but"], [259, "Ch. 3.] THE STATE OF THE EMPIRE 237 equally so to the supremacy of the popular assembly which had made, but could not unmake, its powerful favourites. The circumstance that one of the two great parties in the state was thus always ready, for its own purposes, to set aside the rules and restrictions of the old system, and to give the freest possible hand to the men of its choice, helps to explain the fact that it was during this period of domestic conflict, and even of civil war, that the high-water mark of Eoman advance was reached. ' With the nations outside ' who confronted her during the next four centuries, with the Germans on the north, and with Parthia on the east, Eome was brought face to face by the conquests of C\u00e6sar in Gaul and of Pompey in Asia. Between Eome and the Germans at the opening of Rome and this period lay the Keltic tribes, extending as they did cisalpine in an almost unbroken line from the Atlantic to the 6aul- Danube. Over the Kelts nearest at hand, in the plains of North Italy, Eoman supremacy was already estab lished, and in this district, apart from petty wars provoked by the raids of the highland Alpine tribes, or by the eagerness of Eoman nobles to earn a triumph,1 there is nothing to record but a steady progress in civilisation and prosperity, which made Cisalpine Gaul in the time of Cicero the most populous and thriving part of the Italian peninsula.2 South of the Po, not only a Eoman civilisation, but even a Eoman 1 Cic. in Pison., 26, of L.

But the Keltic tribes in this region were being rapidly Eomanised. The old cantonal organisation with its open villages was breaking down. Old tribal centres, such as Mediolanium,1 were becoming large towns, and rapidly superseding the tribes as the political divisions of the country. How great the advance had been was shown by the fact that, when in 89 B.C. the Eoman franchise was granted to the 665 a.u.c. Cispadone communities, the Transpadanes received Latin rights, and only twenty years later were fully enfranchised.2 It was apparently by Sulla, in 81 B.C., 673 a.u.c that the whole of Cisalpine Gaul was formed into a province with a proconsul of its own.3 The reasons for the step are probably to be found in the increasing administrative needs of a populous region, and still more in its military importance as a frontier district. But the policy of the step was doubtful. The proconsul of Cisalpine Gaul, wielding the autocratic authority of a provincial governor, and backed not only by his legions, but by the great resources in men 4 and money which his province possessed, was, as C\u00e6sar showed, a dangerous neighbour.

Among the oldest and most faithful of the allies of Eome was the Phoc\u00e6an colony of Massilia. Whatever truth there may be in the tradition which dated the alliance from the time of Tarquinius Priscus, it is certain that from the close of the first Punic war onwards it was close and intimate.1 For not only had Eome and Massilia a common interest in checking the raids of Ligurian free- booters and pirates, but from the moment when Eome acquired an interest in Spain, and still more after the formation of the two Spanish provinces (197 B.C.), Massilia became of the first importance to Eome from her position on the route to Spain. Eoman governors on their way to or from their province found a welcome there,2 and the powerful aid of Eome was several times invoked by the Massiliots against their Ligurian neighbours.3 It was, however, not until 125 B.C. that Eome intervened decisively and effectually in Trans- alpine affairs. By that time the Ligurian tribes on the Italian side of the Alps had been thoroughly subdued. Eoman roads had been carried through the Ligurian highlands. Eoman settlements had been planted on Ligurian territory, and Eoman supremacy extended to the very frontiers of southern Gaul.

The main portion of it lay eastward of the Ehone, and extended from the sea- coast along the left bank of that river to the northernmost limits of the territory of the Allobroges and the lake of Geneva, while to the east it was separated from Cisalpine Gaul by the still unsubdued tribes of the Maritime and Cottian Alps. Beyond the Ehone it included the coast-land as far as the Pyrenees, and stretched inland to the foot of the Cevennes, and to the southern borders of the Arverni.

Papirius Carbo (113 B.C.).2 But although this victory appeared to lay Italy open to attack on its most defenceless side, where the colony of Aquileia alone guarded the entrance to the rich plains of the Po,3 no advantage was taken of it. When the Germans reappeared, four years later, in 109 B.C., it was on the northern frontier of the territory of the Allobroges where they a second time defeated a Eoman consul, M.

It was arranged that while the Cimbri retraced their steps and endeavoured to force their way into Italy from the side of Illyricum, the Teutones and Helvetii should take the more direct route through Southern Gaul. The duty of repelling the Cimbri was assigned to Q. Lutatius Catulus, who had been elected consul with Marius for 102 B.C. Marius himself, who had spent the two years 104 and 103 B.C. in quieting the Keltic tribes within the province,4 and in preparing for war,5 awaited the advance of the Teutones at Aqu\u00e6 Sexti\u00e6, the defences of which he had enlarged and strengthened, 1 C\u00e6pio was deprived of his command, and his property confiscated ; Livy, Epit, lxvii. 2 Sail., Jug., 114: 'consul absens est factus et ei decreta provincia Gallia.' 3 Livy, Epit, lxvii. 4 The Volc\u00e6 Tectosages ; Plut. , Suit, 4.

From this time down to the moment when C\u00e6sar assumed the command, the situation in Transalpine Gaul underwent but little change. The peace of the Eoman province was indeed repeatedly disturbed by risings among the Keltic tribes.4 But in spite of these, and of the distress and discontent caused by Eoman misgovernment, Cicero's speech in defence of Fonteius, governor of the province 75-73 B.C., proves that south ern Gaul was already becoming Eomanised, and that a strong tide of immigration from Italy had set in.

The wisdom of the step was quickly proved. In the spring of 58 B.C., the news reached Eome that the Helvetii were again in motion, but on this occasion it was not merely a raid by a single clan that was in prospect. The whole Helvetian people had deliberately resolved to leave their land and find a new home in Gaul. The resolution was taken in 61 B.C., and two years were devoted to completing the arrange ments for what was intended to be a final abandonment of their native country. Their strongholds, villages, and crops were destroyed ; provisions sufficient for three months were collected, and their neighbours to the north and east, the Eauraci, Tulingi, Latobriges, and Boii, persuaded to join them. Finally, the 28th of March, 58 B.C., was fixed as the day on which the whole body should assemble on the right bank of the Ehone, near Geneva, whence an easy and open route would lead them through the territory of the Allobroges.3 1 Cic. pro Fonteio, 5: ' referta Gallia negotiatorum est, plena civium Romanorum ; nemo Gallorum sine cive Romano quicquam negotii geiit ; nummus in Gallia nullus sine civium Romanorum tabulis commoretur \u2014 ex tanto negotiatorum, colonorum, publicanorum, aratorum, pecuariorum numero.' 2 Suet., C\u00e6sar, 22 ; Oros., vi. 7. 3 C\u00e6sar, B.

In front of him, across the river, lay the Helvetii and their allies, numbering all told 368,000 persons.2 C\u00e6sar instantly destroyed the bridge not far from Geneva by which the motley host had hoped to cross, and then carried a line of entrenchments 3 along the left bank of the Ehone, from the lake of Geneva to the foot of the mountains which enclose the Pas d'Ecluse. These precautions were effective, and the Helvetii were forced to attempt the difficult and toil some route leading through the passes of the Jura into the territory of the Sequani,4 whence they hoped to make their way to the pleasant lands of Aquitaine, which the Tigurini had reached fifty years before.5 On learning their intention, C\u00e6sar left Labienus to guard the de-fences on the Ehone, and hurried to Italy to collect fresh troops.6 At the head of five legions he recrossed the Alps,7 and marched rapidly through the i Plut., C\u00e6sar, 17.

The battle which followed resulted in the complete defeat of the Helvetii.5 The survivors, after a vain attempt to make their way to the Ehone through the territory of the Lingones, surrendered at discretion.

Ariovistus was formally 695 a.u.c enrolled among the ' friends ' of the Eoman people, and the title of ' king ' which he had assumed was recog nised by the senate.5 The plight of the \u00c6dui was bad enough, but that of Ariovistus's allies, the Sequani, was even worse, for 120,000 Germans were established in their territory, and Ariovistus had recently ordered them to make room for 24,000 more. At a council of chiefs, the \u00c6duan Divitiacus, whose unswerving loyalty to Eome had won him the full confidence of C\u00e6sar, urged upon him that not only was Eome bound in honour to rescue her faithful allies from their 1 C\u00e6sar, B.

Envoys were at once sent to Ariovistus, but brought back only messages of haughty defiance, while at the same time the news arrived that fresh swarms of Suevi were about to cross the Ehine and join their countrymen in Gaul. In order to crush Ariovistus before these reinforcements reached him, C\u00e6sar started at once ; he occupied and garrisoned Vesontium (Besancon), the chief stronghold of the Sequani, which Ariovistus was said to be intend ing to attack. Seven days later a series of forced marches brought him by a circuitous route within reach of Ariovistus, who was apparently encamped on the further side of the Vosges mountains in the plain country between that range and the Ehine.1 After ten days spent partly in fruitless negotiation and partly in vain attempts on C\u00e6sar's part to force an engage ment, a decisive battle was fought.

Though C\u00e6sar returned to Cisalpine Gaul, his troops remained in the territory of the Sequani,1 and this military occupation was naturally interpreted as implying an intention on the part of Eome to extend her suzerainty beyond the limits of the ' province.' By the Belg\u00e6 especially, the most warlike of the Gaulish peoples, the presence of six Eoman legions so near their frontiers was regarded as menacing their own independence.2 A council of chiefs, summoned to consider the situation, declared enthusiastically for instant war, and contingents from the various tribes were promised, amounting in all to nearly 300,000 men.3 But the prospect of a stubborn resistance which these formidable preparations held out was by no means fulfilled. When C\u00e6sar, in the spring of 57 B.C., reached the Belgic frontier, at the head of an imposing force,4 he was at once met by an offer of friend ship from the Eemi, the most southerly of the Belgic tribes. The alliance, which was eagerly accepted, opened the route to the river Aisne, on the further banks of which C\u00e6sar entrenched himself, with the friendly territory of his new allies in the rear.5 The Belgic host advanced with great firmness against him, but after being twice repulsed, once in an attack on a stronghold of the Eemi, and once in an attempt to cut off C\u00e6sar's communications with the rear, their resolution failed.

Tribe after tribe submitted on the mere appearance of his troops in their territory, and in spite of the desperate stand made by the Nervii, the end of the summer saw the suzerainty of Eome recognised throughout Belgic Gaul. An un mistakable proof of the Eoman advance was the fact that the legions this time wintered, not in the country of the Sequani, but in the very heart of northern Gaul, in the region of the Upper Loire.2 On starting for Italy in the autumn of 57 B.C. C\u00e6sar had received through P. Crassus the submission of the tribes along the Atlantic seaboard from the Loire to the Seine. During the winter, however, the news reached him that these tribes, probably encouraged by his absence, were in open revolt, headed by the Veneti,3 a sea-faring folk at the mouth of the Loire, and had imprisoned the Eoman envoy sent to collect provisions. In the spring of 56 B.C., as soon as the passes were open, C\u00e6sar returned to Gaul. Troops were hastily des patched to prevent the revolt from spreading to other districts : Labienus was commissioned to maintain order among the Belg\u00e6, while Crassus was sent to check any attempt on the part of the tribes south of the Loire to assist the insurgents. To a third force of three legions was intrusted the task of preventing any junction between the more northerly of the revolted tribes,4 and the chief offenders, the Veneti.

Crassus had achieved even more important results by the reduction of the whole of Aquitaine, with the exception only of a few tribes in the extreme south-west.4 A successful expedition, led by C\u00e6sar himself, against the Morini and Menapii on the north coast, completed the work of the year. The suzerainty of Eome was now established, in name at least, over nearly the whole of Gaul, but C\u00e6sar had already reason to know how readily, on any favourable opportunity, the tribes would throw off an allegiance extorted from them by superior force.

In a single battle fought near the confluence of the Ehine and the Meuse they were defeated and cut to pieces.2 The Ehine was now established as the frontier not only of Gaul, but of the empire of the Eoman people.3 Of a permanent advance beyond it there was as yet no thought; but for the safety of the frontier it was essential to impress the German tribes on the further bank of the river with a wholesome fear of the power of Eome, and to show that even in their own homes they were not beyond the reach of her arm. These considerations, and the entreaties of the one trans- Ehenane tribe friendly to Eome, the semi-civilised Ubii, determined C\u00e6sar to enter Germany, and for the first time in history the legions crossed the Ehine by a bridge specially constructed for the purpose.4 The German tribes, and even the invincible Suevi, retreated hastily to the shelter of their impenetrable forests ; and C\u00e6sar, after ravaging the territory of the Sugambri, and relieving the Ubii for the time from the assaults of the Suevi, re-crossed the Ehine.5 i C\u00e6sar, B.

The Kelts across the sea, in the island of Britain, had throughout actively aided their kinsmen on the mainland in their resistance to Eome, and it was time that they, as well as the Germans, should learn that Eome could tolerate no disturbance of the peace within what were now the limits of her empire. It is clear, too, that C\u00e6sar was curious to learn something of the almost un known land whose cliffs were visible from the Gallic shore.1 Although, therefore, the summer was draw ing to a close, an expedition to Britain was resolved upon. A fleet was hastily collected, of which the vessels employed against the Veneti in the previous year formed a part. On this fleet C\u00e6sar placed two legions, which he considered a sufficient force for what was intended to be rather a military reconnaissance than a serious invasion. Sailing from the Portus Itius, near Boulogne, he landed, in spite of the resistance of the natives, on the low shore, near Pevensey,2 where he erected a camp. But the lateness of the season, and the damage inflicted upon his fleet by a high tide, decided him to postpone further operations in the island until the next year, and on ' the day after the equinox ' he recrossed the Channel. During the winter preparations were made for an 700 a.u.c expedition on a larger scale, and late in the spring of 54 B.C., after a delay caused by symptoms of disaffection 1 C\u00e6sar, B.G., iv. 20. 2 Ibid., iv. 23; Desjardins, i. 348 sqq. ; Ridgeway in Journal of Philology, vol. xix. p. 200.

For though he advanced to the Thames,2 and crossed it, and though he broke the power of his most formidable opponent Cassivellaunus, and received the formal submission of several tribes in the south-eastern regions, he returned at the close of the summer without having done more than prove for the benefit of his successors that an invasion of the island was feasible.3 It is probable, however, that C\u00e6sar would not have remained satisfied with these meagre results, but for the ominous symptoms of disturbance and discontent which were showing themselves in Gaul. The at tempted rising of the Treveri in 54 B.C. was followed by a series of insurrections in almost every part of the country. The first to raise the standard of revolt were the tribes in the north-eastern districts, who, finding that C\u00e6sar had been compelled by the scarcity of corn to distribute his legions for the winter over an unusually wide area, determined to make a simultaneous attack upon the isolated camps.4 The Eburones,6 who struck the first blow, decoyed from its camp, and treacherously cut to pieces, the legion stationed in their territory ; the Nervii attacked Q.

The Nervii were defeated ; the Treveri, who had vainly endeavoured to persuade the Germans to come to their aid, were routed by Labienus ; while the Armorican tribes dispersed on hearing the news of the Eoman successes. In spite, however, of this severe check, the insurrectionary movement was by no means crushed. C\u00e6sar remained in Gaul throughout the winter, and early in 53 B.C. he learnt 701 a.u.c. that not only were the north-eastern tribes again taking up arms, but that, south of the Seine, the Senones and Carnutes had thrown off their allegiance.1 With characteristic promptitude he resolved to strike at once before the insurgents could complete their preparations. From his headquarters at Samarobriva (Amiens) he marched rapidly against the Nervii, who, taken com pletely by surprise, at once submitted. Moving southward he held a 'durbar' at Paris,2 in the im mediate neighbourhood of the Senones and Carnutes. The chiefs of the latter abstained from attending, but on C\u00e6sar's advancing against them, in force, their courage failed, and they laid down their arms. The rest of the summer was devoted to the pacification of the districts along the Ehine,3 where the Menapii, Eburones, and Treveri still held out.

The new revolt broke out, not in north-eastern Gaul, but among the tribes of the central and southern districts. The leaders in the movement were the Arverni, and with them were soon united most of the clans dwelling between the Seine and the Garonne.1 The insurgents were thus able at once to threaten the Eoman province of southern Gaul, and to intercept communication between that province and the legions in the north. For the first time, moreover, the insurgent tribes were united under the leadership of a single able and resolute man, the young Arvernian chief Vercingetorix. C\u00e6sar, who had recrossed the Alps on the first news of the out break, found himself as his enemies had calculated, with no other troops at his disposal but such as he had brought from Italy or could raise in the province. The hope, however, which the Gauls entertained of prevent ing a junction between the legions and their general was disappointed. Hastily posting garrisons to check the threatened invasion of the province by Lucterius, chief of the Cadurci,2 and with only a small force of cavalry, he crossed the Cevenries in spite of the deep snow, descended as if from the clouds into the territory of the Arverni, pushed on to the Ehone, and then turning northward effected a junction with his legions in the country of the Lingones, before the insurgents had recovered from their first surprise.3 Once at the head 1 C\u00e6sar, B.

Sending Labienus with four legions to hold the Senones in check, and secure him against a rising in his rear, he resolved to march at once upon the chief Arvernian stronghold Gergovia,2 whither Vercingetorix followed him. But his hopes of thus putting a speedy end to the war were disappointed by the unexpected revolt of his old and faithful allies the \u00c6dui. Fearing that their example might be followed by a general rising of the tribes,3 which had as yet remained quiet, he reluctantly raised the siege of Gergovia, and marching northwards again rejoined Labienus and his legions in the country of the Senones. But his retreat, and the news of the defection of the \u00c6dui gave the signal for the rising which he had feared. A council of chiefs from all parts of Gaul was held at the \u00c6duan capital Bibracte,4 and Vercingetorix, who was elected commander-in-chief, explained the plan of campaign which he proposed to adopt. While he, with the niain body, maintained a harassing guerilla war fare against C\u00e6sar and his legions, the Eoman province to the south was to be invaded at three separate points 1 C\u00e6sar, B.

On his way Vercingetorix attacked him in force, but was repulsed and forced to retreat to the impregnable fortress of Alesia.2 Thither C\u00e6sar followed him, and while Vercingetorix with his infantry held the town, emissaries were sent in all directions inviting the Gauls to rise in a body and crush the invaders. In response to the appeal, a force consisting of 250,000 infantry and 8000 cavalry, drawn from every part of Gaul, assembled in the territory of the \u00c6dui, and marched to Alesia.3 The struggle which followed was more desperate than any in which C\u00e6sar had as yet been engaged. While the newly-arrived levies endeavoured to carry the Eoman lines of entrenchment from the rear, Vercingetorix, issuing from Alesia, assaulted them in front. Twice the legions repulsed the enemy with great slaughter, only to find themselves attacked a third time with even greater fury than before. But their courage and dis cipline finally triumphed.

Vercingetorix himself became a prisoner, and was reserved to grace his conqueror's triumph in Eome, and die by the hands of a Eoman executioner. His followers, with the exception of the \u00c6dui and Arverni, whom C\u00e6sar kept as hostages, were distributed as part of the spoils of war to the victorious legions. The final effort made by the Gauls to recover their Pacification liberty had failed. The capture of Alesia had destroyed \u00b0 their confidence in the impregnability of their strong holds, the best of their warriors were dead or captured, and with Vercingetorix they had lost the one leader capable of enforcing even a temporary union among their tribes.

Late in that year, after review ing his faithful legions in the territory of the Treveri, he left for Italy.2 The result of C\u00e6sar's campaigns had been to bring the whole of Gaul within the Eoman sphere of influence. The tribes were all enrolled as the allies of Eome, and bound to respect the majesty of the Eoman people. It is also probable that C\u00e6sar required from them both hostages and the payment of a tribute. But the establishment of a regular provincial system was delayed by the outbreak (49 B.C.) of the great Civil War, and was in fact the work, not of C\u00e6sar, but of Augustus. To the east of Italy, in the regions stretching north ward from Epirus and Macedonia to the Danube, the advance of Eome had been slow and irregular. Nor had the frequent wars with Keltic, Illyrian, and Thracian tribes, which the defence of the frontier, or the ambition of Eoman generals provoked, resulted in any large and permanent extension of Eoman rule.3 1 C\u00e6sar, B.

As it was, however, throughout the whole of the period we are considering no great advance was made in this direction. Wars indeed were frequent, and triumphs scarcely less so : we read of expeditions against the tribes which lay immediately outside the ' gate of Italy,' Aquileia,1 and against those further south, along the Adriatic seaboard.2 But though Istria is said to have been conquered,3 and though the frontiers of the so called province of Illyria or Illyricum were possibly pushed as far north as Salona,4 no real conquest of the districts afterwards known as Upper and Lower Illyricum was effected. Very much the same was the case with the country lying between the province of Macedonia and the Danube. From 114 B.C. down to Maeedoi 92 B.C. raids by Keltic or Thracian tribes upon the province, and retaliatory expeditions led by the governors of Macedonia, follow each other in rapid succession.6 The defeat of C.

But the defeat of Antonius (consul 63 B.C.) by the Dardani in 62, and the description given by Cicero of the state of affairs on the Macedonian frontier six years later,4 sufficiently prove that the situation had not materially changed.

The revenues derived from it became at once the mainstay of the Eoman treasury, and a source of profit to the Eoman publicani who collected them, while Eoman officials and Eoman men of business found there an inexhaustible field for money-making in every form. But the results of this first annexation of Asiatic territory did not end here. The creation of a Eoman province of Asia brought home to the Eastern world the fact that the 'lordship of Asia,' which had anciently belonged to the half-mythical kings of Phrygia, which had since then been held in turn by Cyrus and Darius, by Alexander of Macedon, and by Antiochus, had passed to Eome, and that the place of the Great King, the king of kings, was now filled by an Italian republic. At the time, indeed, there seemed little probability Jiat this claim of a Western state to rule in Asia would be seriously disputed. Of the three powers which had once contended for supremacy in the near East, Macedon was a Eoman province, the Ptolemies in Egypt were the obsequious allies of Eome, while the Seleucid monarchy with diminished territories was distracted by dynastic feuds, and menaced by foreign invasion.

Yet, within little more than forty years after the annexation of the Pergamene kingdom, that sovereignty was all but overthrown by the ruler of a hitherto obscure principality beyond the Halys ; and this danger past, Eome found herself face to face on the Euphrates with a new and powerful Oriental kingdom, whose pretensions were as lofty as her own, and whose rulers had assumed the titles and claimed to be the heirs of Cyrus. The kingdom of Pontus x took its rise, like its neighbours to the west and south, Bithynia and Cappadocia, during the troublous times which followed the death of Alexander the Great. Its founder, Mithridates the First (281 B.C.) claimed descent from one of the seven Persian nobles who conspired against the Pseudo-Smerdis, or, according to a later version, from the royal house of the Ach\u00e6menid\u00e6 itself.2 More than a century later, in the reign of the fifth king, Mithridates Euergetes (156-120 B.C.), Pontus was enrolled among the allies of Eome, and both during the third Punic war and on the occasion of Aristoni cus's rebellion (133-129 B.C.) had loyally assisted her powerful patron.

The object which he set before himself was, if not at first the expulsion of the Eomans from Asia, at least the creation of a powerful Asiatic monarchy, which should set bounds to European aggression, and reclaim Asia for the Asiatics. For such a task he was pre-eminently well qualified. His personal beauty, his marvellous bodily powers, his prowess as soldier and huntsman,3 fascinated the warlike tribes, Thracian, Scythian, or Colchian, whom he enlisted under his banner. To the native populations of Asia Minor he appealed as the lineal descendant of the great Persian monarchs who had formerly claimed all Asia for their own,4 while to the Greek cities he was recommended as the son of a father whose services to them had won him the title of ' the Benefactor,' and as a prince who, though Persian by descent, was Greek by education, who everywhere proclaimed himself their protector, and who posed as the successor, not only of Cyrus and Darius, but of Alexander. In the use which he made of these advantages Mithridates was, it is true, unscrupulous, treacherous, and cruel, but he showed also that, both as a statesman and a general, he had few equals among his contemporaries. 1 Reinach, 55. 2 Strabo, xii. 3, 1. 3 App., Mithr., 112. 4 Hdt. , i. 4 : ti]v yap 'Aoirjii . . . oUriieCuTaL ol Tlepaai."], [292, "HISTORY OF ROME [Book iv. 270 662 A.u.c 664 A.u.c. Fortune, too, favoured him ; for during the first four teen years of his reign the attention of the Eoman senate was too much engrossed by affairs in the West, by the Jugurthine war and the Cimbric invasion, to be able to pay any close attention to the East. Mithridates thus succeeded, almost unobserved, in carrying out the first part of his great scheme. By 95 B.C. his authority was recognised along the coasts of the Euxine, from the mouths of the Danube to Colchis and Lesser Armenia, alike by the Greek cities and by the barbarian tribes men. Once master of the Euxine and of its inexhaust ible resources in men and supplies, he turned his attention to strengthening his position in Asia Minor, and it was his action here that first provoked Eoman intervention. In 92 B.C., L. Cornelius Sulla, the future dictator, was sent to Cappadocia, with orders to re store King Ariobarzanes, whom Mithridates had deposed in favour of his own son Ariarathes.1 Mithridates acquiesced, but only for the time ; and when, in 90 B.C., the Social War broke out in Italy, he seized his opportunity, and not only once more expelled Ario barzanes, but put a creature of his own on the throne of Bithynia, in the place of Eome's ally Nicomedes. Again Eome intervened, and again Mithridates allowed the exiled kings to be restored, and professed unalter able respect for the authority of Eome. Meanwhile, he laboured ceaselessly and secretly to consolidate and extend the great coalition which he hoped to lead against Eome.2 The Greek cities of the Euxine, and 1 Livy, Epit, lxx. ; Plutarch, Sulla, 5 ; App., Mithr., 10. 2 App., Mithr., 15."], [293, "665 A.U.C.

In Pontus itself he had colleted and equipped an army of 250,000 infantry and 40,000 cavalry, as well as a fleet of 400 vessels.1 Nothing more was needed but a pretext for war, and this was supplied by the incredible rashness and folly of the Eoman officials in Asia. Indeed, no better proof of the weakness of the re publican system could be given than the fact that by the unauthorised action of a few representatives abroad, the Eoman government found itself, without any previous warning, suddenly engaged in a serious war against an opponent more formidable than any whom it had encountered since the fall of Carthage, and this in the midst of a serious domestic crisis. It was at the in stigation of M'.

His success, however, had been largely due to the domestic troubles which occupied the attention of the Eoman government, to the incapacity of the Eoman generals opposed to him, and to the absence of any sufficient body of Eoman troops in Asia Minor. All this was changed when, early in 87 B.C., Sulla, in conformity with a decree of the senate, 667 a.u.c assumed the command, and appeared in Greece at the Sulla takes 1 * the com head of five legions. His arrival was the signal for a mand. hasty repudiation of their newly-formed alliance with Mithridates by the states of the Peloponnese, an example which, as Mithridates found to his cost, the Greeks of Asia Minor were ready enough to follow. It was against Athens, which Archelaus and his ally Aristion occupied in force, that Sulla directed his first attack.

In Asia Minor his cruelties and exactions had already made him unpopular, and the growing disaffection was increased by the news of Sulla's victory at Ch\u00e6ronea. The savage measures by which he endeavoured to intimidate his new subjects, his treacherous murder of the Galatian chiefs, and his brutal treatment of the Chians, alienated barbarians and Greeks alike. The Galatians expelled the satrap sent to govern them, and several of the Greek cities, following the lead of Ephesus, openly declared for Eome.2 The defeat at Orchomenos was a fresh blow to his hopes, and he at once empowered Archelaus to open negotiations with Sulla.3 Nor was Sulla without strong reasons for desiring peace. The counter revolution in Eome which followed his departure for Greece 4 had placed his bitterest opponents at the head of affairs. He had been declared an outlaw, and his command transferred to L.

The terms which he now proposed to Archelaus amounted, in effect, to the restoration of the status quo as it existed before the war. Mithridates was to abandon Cappadocia, Bithynia, Asia, and Paphlagonia, to hand over to Eome seventy fully equipped ships of war, and to pay an indemnity of 2000 talents.1 In reply, Mithridates asked 2 to be allowed to retain Paphlagonia and to keep his ships. Sulla, however, was firm, and the course of events during the early part of the year 85 B.C. increased the anxiety 669 a.u.c of both parties for a peaceful settlement. Sulla had spent the winter of 86-85 in Thessaly,3 and had appar ently devoted the spring to chastising the various tribes, Keltic, Illyrian, and Thracian, who for the last four or five years had incessantly harassed the pro- vince of Macedonia.4 Meanwhile his destined successor Murder of Flaccus had, shortly after reaching Asia, been murdered Fimbl.ia -in by Fimbria at Nicomedia;5 the latter assumed com- Asia mand of the troops, and though a man of the worst possible character, showed himself no mean general.

Advancing through Thrace to the Hellespont, where Lucullus joined him with the long expected fleet, he crossed to Asia.1 At Dardanus, in the Troad,2 he met Mithridates, and peace was con cluded on the terms originally proposed. Mithridates retired to Pontus, Nicomedes and Ariobarzanes were restored for the third time to the thrones of Bithynia and Cappadocia, and finally Fimbria, deserted by his legions, who went over to Sulla, fell by his own hand.3 In calm defiance of the sentence of outlawry passed upon him, Sulla had won two pitched battles, had concluded an important treaty with a foreign power, and now proceeded with unshaken confidence to settle the affairs of the province of Asia which he had re covered. The measures he took, if partially justified by the savage massacre of 88 B.C., were at any rate not calculated to restore peace and prosperity to a country harassed by war and impoverished by the exactions of Mithridates.

It is true that he did not omit to reward the fidelity of such communities as had remained loyal by a grant of 'freedom,' and in some cases of an extension of territory.4 But these favours counted for little by comparison with the financial ruin which his demands brought about in the province which he claimed to have reorganised.5 In order to meet them, the com munities of Asia were forced to borrow at exorbitant rates from Eoman money-lenders ; with the result that fourteen years later their debt had increased to six times 1 App., Mithr., 61 : irture erCiv cpbpovs iaeiiiyKew aiirUa . . . ko.1 tt)x toD irb\\ep.ou Sairaii-qv.

There, too, Sulla's course was marked by robbery, devastation, and distress,4 the traces of which were plainly visible forty years later.5 Even more characteristic of Sulla's cynical indifference to all but the object immediately in view, was his omission to guard against a recurrence of the danger which he had for the moment repelled. The province of Asia was left as defenceless, the restored kings of Bithynia and Cappadocia as helpless, as before, while Mithridates himself was free to recruit his strength, and plan fresh schemes of conquest. It is probable, indeed, that neither side accepted the settlement made at Dardanus as final. In 83, 82, and 81, L.

On the other hand, Mithridates retained his hold over at least a part of Cappadocia, and continued his preparations for a renewal of hostilities with Eome. The death of Sulla in 78 B.C., the success of Sertorius 076 a.u.c in Spain, and the outbreak of a serious frontier war in Macedonia2 (77 B.C.) emboldened Mithridates to take677Au.c more overt steps for recovering his lost position. With all his old activity he sought allies in every direction against the common enemy. Once more he summoned to his aid the warlike tribes to the north of the Euxine.3 His son-in-law Tigranes, now the ruler not only of ib-menia but of Syria, was persuaded to invade Cappadocia.4 The friendship of the Cilician pirates was assured by the efforts which Eome was at last making to crush them.5 Finally, he solicited and obtained an alliance with Sertorius in the far West, thus uniting, as Cicero said, 'the Atlantic with the Euxine '\u00b0 in his great coalition.

Both the two consuls of the year were sent from Eome to repulse him,3 a most unusual measure at the time, one of them, M. Aurelius Cotta, being specially charged with the defence of Bithynia. But Cotta was no general ; he was easily defeated by Mithridates, and forced to take refuge within the walls of Chalcedon, leaving Bithynia at the mercy of the enemy, Mithri- dates next advanced against Cyzicus \u2014 the capture of which would have supplied him with an admirable base of operations by sea and land against the western and most wealthy districts of the province of Asia 4 \u2014 while a second force invaded and overran Phrygia.

The winter drew on, Cyzicus still held out, and the vast army of Mithridates began rapidly to melt away under the effects of hunger and disease. At last, towards the close of 74 B.C., the king raised the siege, 6so a.u.c and with a part of his fleet and army retreated by sea to Nicomedia and thence to Pontus.2 Lucullus entered Cyzicus in triumph, having, as he had predicted, de- feated the enemy without fighting a battle. A naval victory off Lemnos completed the ruin of the Pontic armament, and finally cleared Asia and Bithynia of the invaders. But Lucullus had no intention of leav- invasion of ing Mithridates, as Sulla had left him, in undisturbed L\u00b0\"JiSUg' possession of his hereditary kingdom, to prepare at his leisure for a third outbreak. In the autumn of 73 esi a.u.c B.C. he led his legions into Pontus, and laid siege to Amisus and Themiscyra.3 Learning, however, that Mithridates had collected a considerable force at Cabira, in the valley of the Lycus, he resolved, if possible, to attack and crush him before his more distant allies, and above all, his son-in-law Tigranes, could come to his assistance.

Here, just as provisions were beginning to fail him, fortune came to his aid. A Eoman foraging party repulsed with loss the cavalry sent by the king to intercept them. The repulse was magnified by rumour into a serious defeat, and, with characteristic indifference to the fate of his followers, Mithridates prepared for flight. The discovery of his intention created a general panic, in the midst of which the Eomans attacked and took the camp with all the royal treasure. Mithridates, however, escaped in the confusion to Comana, and thence made his way to Tigranes.1 But though the king had escaped, his kingdom became the prize of the victor. During 71 B.C. Lucullus rapidly made himself master not only of Pontus, but of Lesser Armenia, and received the submission of Mithridates's own son Machares, king of the Bosporani.2 This accomplished, he returned to the province of Asia, where he seems to have spent the greater part of the next year (70 B.C.). His policy there was a welcome contrast to that of Sulla. He had already given proof of his Hellenic sympathies by restoring its freedom to Amisus,3 and he now set himself to mitigate the evils caused by Sulla's exactions.

Where land had been mortgaged, the creditor was to receive only one fourth of the yearly revenue, and leave the rest to the debtor. A portion of the indemnity imposed by Sulla was still in arrear, and for the gradual payment of this Lucullus provided by taxation.2 The success of his measures, which enraged the Eoman ' negotiatores ' as much as they gratified the provincials, was shown by the fact that, within four years, the burden of debt was removed,3 and that some of his arrangements were still in force in 45 B.C.4 Towards the close of 70 B.C., or early in 69 B.C., 684, 635 the young Appius Claudius, Lucullus's brother-in-law, invasion of returned from the dangerous mission on which he had Armenia been sent to Tigranes.

The refusal was probably expected, and Lucullus at once resolved upon the bold step of invading Armenia.

After the defeat of Antiochus at Magnesia (189 B.C.), it became independent, and grew in strength until, towards the close of the second century B.C., its growth was checked, and the existence of the kingdom endangered, by the advance of the Parthians, who, after wresting Media and Mesopotamia from the Seleucids, invaded Armenia, defeated the Armenian king Arta- vasdes, and annexed a considerable slice of his kingdom. 659 a.u.c ln 95 b.c, when his son Tigranes ascended the throne, Tigranes and fortunes of Armenia were at their lowest ebb. But his empire, jjjg next twenty -five years witnessed one of those rapid revolutions characteristic of Eastern history. The new king, though inferior in ability to Mithridates, was to the full as ambitious, and circumstances favoured his ambition.

Syria in the south fell an easy prey to his troops (83 B.C.), while to the westward he penetrated 671 a.u.c into the lowlands of Cilicia and into Cappadocia (78 B.C.).1 When the young Eoman patrician Appius 676 a.u.c Claudius met him at Antioch (70 B.C.), he was the 684 a.u.c ruler of an empire which extended from the Caucasus to the frontiers of Jud\u00e6a, and from the Taurus to the eastern limits of Media. Vassal kings waited upon him at table, or ran as footmen before him when he rode.2 Under his banner were enrolled Greek hoplites from Asia Minor, Median archers, Albanians from the shores of the Caspian, and nomad Arabs from the desert.3 As a monument of his wealth and greatness, he had built himself a great city, 'the city of Tigranes,' and, after the fashion of the old Assyrian kings, had transplanted thither a motley population drawn from the various subject provinces.4 But though as great a lord as Antiochus had been, he was scarcely better fitted to resist the shock of a Eoman attack.

In the spring of 69 B.C.,1 Lucullus left Asia, rejoined his troops in Pontus, and led them through Cappadocia, across the Euphrates into Armenia. His march was unopposed for his kindly attitude, and the strict dis cipline which he enforced upon his legions conciliated the natives. Tigranes, intoxicated by a sense of over whelming strength, refused even to believe in the rumours that the Eomans whom he was preparing to drive out of Asia were actually invading his own territory. Even when convinced of the truth of the report, he merely sent a detachment of troops with orders to bring Lucullus before him alive.2 The defeat of this force did indeed for a moment shake his con fidence, but the sight of the vast host which rallied to his standard in obedience to his call,3 revived his courage and confirmed his resolution in spite of the prudent advice of Mithridates to crush the invaders in a single battle. On the news of his approach, Lucullus, who was besieging Tigranocerta, and who with better reason was no less anxious to force on an engagement, left Murena to continue the siege, and with a force ' too large,' as Tigranes said, ' for an embassy, and too small i App., Mithr., 84; Plut., Luc, 23. 2 Plut., Luc, 25. 3 The total numbers, as stated by the ancient authorities, vary con siderably.

A general panic and rout followed, in which it is said that 100,000 of the enemy's infantry, and nearly all his cavalry, were slain, while of Eomans only five were killed and a hundred wounded.3 The victory was followed by the fall of Tigranocerta, which was surrendered to the Eomans by the Greek mercenaries, who formed part of the garrison.4 The half-finished city, which Tigranes had destined to be a lasting memorial of his greatness, was destroyed, and in the time of Strabo was only a small village.5 Late in the spring of 68 B.C.,6 Lucullus, who had 6s6 a.u.c. spent the winter in the south of Armenia, marched Advance r upon Artax northward across the Taurus in the hope of striking a ata ; second final blow at Tigranes, who, assistedEy Mithridates, had Tigranes. succeeded in getting together a second army, and was preparing for the defence of his hereditary kingdom.

The way now lay open to Artaxata, but the short highland summer was over, and the approach of winter, added to the unwillingness of his troops to risk a further advance, compelled Lucullus reluctantly to turn southwards.2 He re-crossed the Taurus into the warmer regions south of the Tigris, where the capture of the important city of Nisibis 3 partially compensated him for his failure to reach the 'Armenian Carthage.'4 Up to this time his career of success had been almost unbroken.

Lucullus had always disdained to attach his soldiers to himself, as Sulla had done, by allowing them unbounded licence, nor had he the art, which C\u00e6sar possessed, of winning their affections. Wearied out with a seemingly endless war, they now flatly refused to follow Lucullus, not only against the Parthians, but even against Tigranes, who, during the winter (68-67 B.C.), had once more got 6S6-687 together an army. It was only when the news arrived that Mithridates, taking advantage of Lucullus's forced inactivity, had re-entered Pontus and defeated Lucul- lus's legate, M. Fabius, that they consented to march. Lucullus led them at once through Cappadocia into Pontus, where he found that Mithridates had gained a second victory over C. Triarius (67 B.C.). On his 687 a.u.c approach Mithridates retired eastward to Lesser Ar- menia; but when Lucullus attempted to follow him, his soldiers, headed by the two old legions of Fimbria, optenly mutinied, encouraged by the news that the senate at home had superseded Lucullus in the com- mand and granted their discharge to his soldiers. Throughout the summer and autumn of 67 B.C. Lucullus was forced to remain passive, while Mithridates openly reinstated himself as king in Pontus, and Tigranes ravaged Cappadocia at his will. At the end of that year the Manilian law transferred the command of the war to Pompey, and in 66 B.C. Lucullus finally left oss a.u.c Asia for Eome.

A pirate squadron had boldly sailed into the roadstead of Ostia, and burnt the vessels lying there ; a pirate band had landed on the Latin coast, and carried off two Eoman pr\u00e6tors as they travelled along the Appian Way. Worse than all, the corn-supplies from the provinces were intercepted, and Eome itself was threatened with famine. Against an enemy so well organised and ubiquitous, the isolated efforts of the ordinary propr\u00e6 tor or proconsul were unavailing, and it was with the approval of every one outside the high official circles that Aulus Gabinius, tribune of the plebs (67 B.C.), carried a law intrusting the supreme command of the high seas to the popular favourite, who had crushed Sertorius and restored to the tribunes the powers taken from them by Sulla. The commission thus given to Pompey was wider than any before intrusted to a single Eoman. His ' province ' embraced the entire Mediterranean Sea, and the coasts for fifty miles inland. He had under him twenty-five legates of pr\u00e6torian rank and authority, 120,000 legionaries, 4000 cavalry, and a fleet of 270 ships. He was authorised, in addi tion, to levy such contributions of men and supplies as he thought fit ; and orders were sent to all governors of provinces, and to all allied kings, princes, and cities, 1 Pint., Pomp., 24 ; Dio Cass., xxxvi. 22 ; App., Mithr., 92."], [313, "Ch. 3.] POMPEY IN THE EAST 291 requiring them to render him loyal assistance. The success of this new and startling experiment was complete. Forty days sufficed to clear the western Mediterranean of the pirate vessels; and then sail ing eastwards, Pompey, while his legates swept the Levant, attacked the headquarters of the pirate power in Cilicia. Their ships were captured or destroyed, their strongholds razed to the ground, their arsenals and dockyards destroyed. It was while thus engaged in Cilicia that Pompey received the news that the grateful people had conferred upon their idol a fresh command, which opened even more dazzling prospects to his ambition than that which he already held. By the Manilian law (66 B.C.) he received in addition to 688 a.u.c the control of the high seas, not merely the charge of the war against Mithridates, but a wide command-in chief over the entire Eoman East.

Pompey, however, did not follow him ; and intrusting to the Eoman fleet in the Euxine the duty of w-atching his movements and intercepting his sup plies, he turned southwards to regions where more attractive work awaited him than a toilsome and difficult pursuit of a fugitive king. Tigranes was still the nominal ruler of all the territories lying between the Caucasus and the frontiers of Egypt ; but he was in no condition to make a stand against the generalissimo of Eome. Disheartened by the desertion of his son and by his previous defeats, he abandoned all thought of resistance ; and when Pompey, in the autumn of 66 B.C. entered Armenia, he went to his camp, and there in person tendered his submission. He was graciously allowed to retain his hereditary kingdom, but at the expense of surrendering all that he had acquired beyond its borders, in Asia Minor and in Syria. Pompey was unable at once to take advantage of this bloodless victory over the king of kings. The submission of Tigranes, and the encampment of a large Eoman force in their immediate neighbourhood, alarmed the independent tribes of the Caucasus ; and during 1 The '(city of Nicopolis was founded by Pompey on the site of his victory."], [315, "Ch. 3.] POMPEY IN THE EAST 293 the winter (66-65 B.C.) the Albanians attacked his quarters in the valley of the river Cyrus (Kur). The summer of 65 B.C. was consequently devoted to the 689 a.u.c chastisement of these warlike peoples : first of all the Iberians, and then the Albanians, were reduced to sub mission ; and Eoman troops for the first time pene trated northward into Colchis, to the fabled home of Medea, and eastward to the regions bordering on the mysterious Caspian Sea. From the Caucasus Pompey returned to spend the Annexation winter (65-64 B.C.) in Pontus, and in the summer of of Sym; 64' B.C. he was at length free to enter on behalf of the 690 a.u.c Eoman people into the rich inheritance ceded by Tigranes, and to complete the circle of his triumphs by establishing the authority of Eome on the southern ocean, as he had already established it on the Atlantic seaboard and on the shores of the Caspian.1 Entering Syria, he at once annexed it, and thus finally brought to a close the kingdom of the Seleucid\u00e6; and then advancing southward, he besieged and took Jerusalem. The Jewish prince Aristobulus was sent a prisoner 1;o Eome, and his brother Hyrcanus placed on the throne as a friend and ally of the Eoman people.2 Further south still lay the kingdom of Aretas, king of the Nabat\u00e6ans.

A revolt of the Jews obliged him to retrace Death of his steps northward ; and while in Palestine, the news reached him that Mithridates, deserted by his troops, 1 Plut., Pomp., 38. 2 Ibid., 39; Dio, xxxvii. 15; App., Syria, 48."], [316, "691 A.U.C The results of Pompey's campaigns. 294 HISTORY OF ROME [Book iv and closely besieged in the citadel of Panticap\u00e6um by his own son Pharnaces, had put an end to his life (63 B.C.). The death of Mithridates removed for the time all fear of any open resistance to Eome in Western Asia. Pompey returned first of all to Pontus, where he received the submission of Pharnaces, and thence by slow degrees through Greece to Italy. From a military point of view, Pompey's achieve ments in the East cannot bear comparison with those of C\u00e6sar in the West. But they impressed the public imagination far more deeply, and their historical results were at least as important. It is true that an air of Oriental exaggeration pervades the accounts which have come down to us of his triumphal return.1 He was welcomed as the conqueror not only of Mithridates but of the kings and peoples of the East, and as the man who had extended the rule of Eome to the Euphrates and to the frontiers of Egypt. On a tablet, carried aloft in his triumphal procession, he claimed to have taken 800 vessels of war, to have founded twenty-nine cities, and conquered seven kings, \u2014 claims to which the long train of captive princes which followed his car, and the splendid trophies in gold and silver which were paraded before the eyes of the Eoman populace, lent a powerful support. And exaggeration apart, he had in fact achieved great things, and his name must be as closely identified with the rule of Eome in the East, as that of his future rival, C\u00e6sar, was destined to be with the rule of Eome in the West. On this side the Euphrates no power was left i App. Mithr., 114-118."], [317, "Ch. 3.] POMPEY IN THE EAST 295 capable of disputing with Eome the sovereignty over Western Asia. There were still kings, but there was no longer ' a king of kings,' for even the claim of the Parthian monarch to this title was explicitly rejected by Pompey.1 The re-establishment of Eoman suzerainty in the near East was, moreover, accompanied by impor tant extensions of Eoman territory. Bithynia, which had been bequeathed to Eome in 74 B.C., was, together 680 a.u.c with the Western half of the kingdom of Pontus, formed into a province, and the constitution now framed for it by Pompey was still in force in the reign of Trajan.2 Cilicia was placed permanently under a Eoman governor, and the bounds of this province were extended to in clude Pamphylia and Isauria. Further still to the east the fertile region lying between the sea and the Syrian desert was incorporated with the empire as the province of Syria. Outside these provinces the area covered by the Eoman protectorate was still left in the hands of native rulers, of whom, within Asia Minor itself, the two most important were Ariobarzanes, king of Cappa docia, and the Keltic chief, Deiotarus of Galatia, whose services to Eome in the recent wrars were rewarded by extensive grants of territory in the north-east. These two great native states were to be the chief props of Eoman ascendency in the central and eastern districts of the peninsula.3 It is, moreover, to Pompey's credit that he recognised the fact that the natural allies of Eome in the East 1 Plut., Pomp., 38. 2 Strabo, p. 541; Plin. , Epp. ad Traj. , 112; Marquardt, Staatsveno., i. 191. 3 App., Mithr., 114; Mommsen, R. G., iii. 141 sqq."], [318, "296 HISTORY OF ROME [Book iv. were the city communities rather than the native chiefs and tribesmen, and that in binding these closely to Eome, and in increasing their number, lay the best security for the permanence of Eoman rule. It is possible, indeed, that personal vanity quickened his sense of the value of this policy, and that the most recent conqueror of the East was not unwilling to appear as a founder of cities after the manner of Alexander and the Seleucid kings. But the policy was a sound one, and did as much to attach the Greek communities to Eome as Sulla's shortsighted harshness had done to alienate them from her. Even the Greek names given to the new cities are significant of the intentions with which they were founded. Pompeiopolis, Nicopolis, Magnopolis are as characteristic of Eoman policy in the East as the Latin names of the new towns in Spain and Gaul are of Eoman policy in the West.1 Not the least important result of Pompey's work was that Eome was now brought directly face to face with the Oriental kingdom, which, throughout the history of the empire, divided with her the allegiance of the eastern world. It was not, indeed, possible as yet for a Eoman historian to write of the king of Parthia as the rival on equal terms of the Eoman C\u00e6sar.2 Pompey treated writh contempt the claim of King Phraates to be styled ' king of kings ' ; he refused the latter's request that the Euphrates should be recognised as the boundary between Eome and Parthia,3 and even assigned to Eome's now 1 App., Mithr., 115; Mommsen, R.

It is possible that he contemplated bringing the fertile district of Mesopo tamia within the area of Eoman protectorate. But the fact remained that, with the collapse of Tigranes' power and the annexation of Syria, the responsibility devolved upon Eome of protecting the Greek East against the advance of purely Oriental power. What this responsibility might mean was shown The defeat of clearly enough only eight years later, when M. Lucinius Crassus was defeated and slain in Mesopotamia 1 (53 701 a.u.c B.C.). Under the terms agreed upon in the conference at Luca, Crassus succeeded to Aulus Gabinius in the governorship of Syria. It was his ambition to perform exploits which should raise him to the same high level of fame as the two great colleagues in the coalition, C\u00e6sar and Pompey, and to reconquer for the West and for Eome the vast regions stretching from the Euphrates to the Indus, once ruled over by Alexander. A pre text for invading Parthia had been supplied by the Parthian king, who had declared war upon Eome's ally, the king of Armenia. At the moment, too, Parthia was distracted by civil war, and the aid of the Eomans had been invoked by the weaker party. With a force of seven legions Crassus crossed the Euphrates and plunged into the sandy wastes beyond it. A toil some desert march exhausted his troops, aud the Arab sheikh who guided them proved faithless. Suddenly the enemy they were seeking appeared. On all sides the Parthian squadron encircled the invading force. 1 Plut., Crassus, 17 sqq. ; Dio Cass., xl. 12 sqq."], [320, "298 HISTORY OF ROME [Book iv. For a moment some relief was given by the young Publius Crassus, who at the head of the Keltic cavalry he had brought from the far West, charged the Par thians and forced them to retreat. But it was only for the moment : Crassus, cut off from the main body, and surrounded by overwhelming numbers, fell by the hand of his shield-bearer. Of the 6000 men who followed him 500 were made prisoners, and the rest slain. Through out the rest of the day the Parthian lancers and archers wrought havoc in the dense ranks of the helpless legions ; at nightfall they withdrew, and the Eomans, leaving their wounded behind, made their way north wards to Carrh\u00e6, and thence to Sinnaka, hoping to find shelter from the pursuing cavalry in the mountains of Armenia. The Parthians followed, and, at the request of the Parthian leader, Crassus consented to a personal interview for the arrangement of terms of peace. The interview ended as might have been expected. The Eoman officers who accompanied Crassus suspected treachery, attempted resistance, and were instantly cut down, together with their general himself. Of the troops left behind in camp some were made prisoners, and the rest dispersed ; of the splendid force which had crossed the Euphrates, scarcely a fourth part returned. Ten thousand Eoman soldiers were carried away into captivity, and the eagles of the legions passed into the keeping of the Parthian king. The defeat and death of Crassus were not followed, as might have been expected, by a Parthian invasion of Syria or Asia Minor. But they opened the eyes of Eoman statesmen to the formidable strength of this"], [321, "Ch. 3.] STATE OF THE EMPIRE 299 new rival, and thenceforward Eoman policy in the East aimed either, as under C\u00e6sar, at crippling the power of Parthia, or, as under Augustus, at establishing a definite and defensible frontier along the line of the Euphrates. The campaigns of Pompey and C\u00e6sar had extended state of the the sovereignty of Eome up to the natural geographical limits formed by the Atlantic and the Ehine in the west and north, and by the Euphrates in the east. On the south, the belt of fertile land stretching along the African coast westward from the mouth of the Nile was, by the close of the revolutionary period, either depen dent upon Eome or directly subject to her rule. Egypt was a vassal state, while the former dominions of the Ptolemies in the Cyrenaica had been annexed by Eome and formed into a province (74 B.C.).1 Westward of the eso a.u.c Cyrenaica lay the old province of Africa, and westward again the kings of Numidia and Mauretania were the sworn allies and friends of the Eoman people. But though the empire of Eome had been extended over the whole civilised Mediterranean world, and though its boundaries everywhere touched the confines of the surrounding barbarism, there had been no correspond ing advance in internal stability. The defects in the administrative system which were noticed in an earlier chapter 2 had become more conspicuous than ever. The controlling authority of the senate had been fatally weakened by the attacks of the popular party. Political dissensions had led to civil war, and civil war had more 1 App., B. C, i.

In Spain, in Africa, and in Asia, the pro vincials had seen rival representatives of Eoman authority in open conflict with each other, and their own resources squandered in the quarrels of their rulers. Even when this was not the case, the absence of any central authority strong enough to control the pro consuls, and to enforce a stable imperial policy, produced chronic confusion and misgovernment. In addition to the havoc wrought by civil war, by foreign invasion, or by the scourge of piracy, the provinces had to suffer from the inexperience, and incapacity, or from the avarice and ambition, of the men whom the chances of lot, or of political party-strife in Eome, sent out to govern them, and who ruled each in his own province as an independent autocrat. The pictures which Cicero has drawn for us of Sicily under Verres, of Asia during the Mithridatic wars,1 or of Macedonia under Piso,2 cannot probably be taken as typical of the normal condition of a province, under a governor of average capacity and honesty. But the state of Cilicia as he found it in 51 B.C. was a disgrace to civilised government. He describes in vivid colours the bankruptcy of the communities, the peculations of the native magistrates, the exactions of Eoman money-lenders, and the blackmail regularly levied under one pretext or another by the Eoman governors.3 Parts, at least, of Achaia were, as we learn from Cicero's correspondent Servius Sulpicius, in no i Cic, pro Lege Manilla. 2 Ibid, de Proii.

The danger to the republican government, however, lay not in the prospect of a pro vincial outbreak, but in the justification which its own maladministration afforded for the ambitious schemes and independent authority of powerful individuals. It is well enough for Sulla to carry a law declaring it to be treasonable for a provincial governor to leave his province, to lead an army across the frontiers, to make war on his own authority, or to enter a kingdom without orders from the people and senate.3 But Sulla had done these things himself with impunity. The wide powers given to Pompey in 67-66 B.C. were a confession of the necessity which existed for a change in the old system, and Cicero himself recognised that, in the conflict which broke out in 49 B.C., the question at issue was not whether personal rule in some form was necessary, but by which of two powerful rivals it should be exercised.4 1 Cic ad Fam., iv. 5. 2 Ibid, pro L.

The latter's decision was soon taken. He resolved to secure the West, and remove all danger of attack upon that side before following Pompey across the Adriatic. Two of his officers occupied with ease Sardinia and Sicily, and to one of them, Curio, was intrusted the more difficult task of securing Africa.1 C\u00e6sar himself, after a brief stay in Eome, set out for Spain by way of Massilia, sending orders to his legate there, C. Fabius, to concentrate the six legions sta tioned in Gaul, and at once force the passes of the Pyrenees. After a short delay, caused by the refusal of the Massiliots to supply him with ships, or to admit him within their gates, he pressed on to Spain, with an escort of 900 horse ; on June 23rd he joined his legions, who were already within striking distance of the enemy. The Pompeian forces, under Afranius and Petreius, were massed at Ilerda (Lerida), on the Sicoris, with the view of barring the passage across the Ebro, while Varro, with two legions, held the southern province of Further Spain.2 The opposing armies were of fairly equal strength, and both were encamped upon the right bank of the Sicoris. But the Pompeians had all the advantages of position : they had a friendly province in their rear ; they held the town of Ilerda, which was well stocked with provisions, and with it a stone bridge, which gave them easy and sure communication with the country on the left bank of the river.

C\u00e6sar's first move was an attempt to equalise matters by seizing a position midway between the Pompeian camp and Ilerda, and thus cut the enemy off both from the town and the bridge.1 But the attempt failed, and a flood which swept away his two bridges increased the difficulties of his situation. His supplies ran short, and he was hemmed in by impassable rivers to the right and left, with a strongly entrenched hostile force in front. The exultant Pompeians regarded the war as already over, when by a brilliant man\u0153uvre C\u00e6sar changed the aspect of affairs. A convoy of provisions from Gaul had reached the left bank of the Sicoris some miles above his camp. Hastily constructing light coracles, such as he had learnt the value of in Britain,2 he sent them by night up the right bank in carts. At a distance of twenty -two miles from the camp the soldiers crossed in the boats and fortified a post on the other side; a bridge was built, and the convoy brought in safety to its destination.

But C\u00e6sar's rapidity of movement upset their calculations. They reached the rocky ground near the Ebro only to find the way closed by C\u00e6sar's infantry, while his cavalry hung upon their rear.

In addition to nine legions he had concentrated in Epirus a motley force of auxiliaries, whose barbaric appearance probably shocked others besides Cicero.2 Vast stores had been collected at Dyrrhachium, and a numerous fleet under the command of C\u00e6sar's ancient enemy, M.

The shock to their confidence was all the greater when the news of C\u00e6sar's success in Spain was rapidly followed by the still more startling intelligence that he had actually effected a landing unopposed on the Epirot coast, that Oricum first of all, and then Apollonia, had opened their gates to him, and that he was advancing on Dyrrhachium.3 For the moment it seemed as if he would repeat in Epirus and Macedonia the brilliant march by which he had won Italy in the spring of 49 B.C. But Pompey arrived from Macedonia in time to arrest the enemy's advance at the river Apsus, and C\u00e6sar, who had only half his army with him, was obliged to await the arrival of the rest of his troops, under M.

Once more, however, C\u00e6sar was too quick for the leisurely pace of his dignified opponent. He not only succeeded in joining Antony, but, by a sudden dash, seized and occupied the neck of land by which alone Dyrrhachium could be approached, and thus cut off Pompey from his headquarters and his supplies. The latter, however, with forces numerically superior, and with absolute command of the sea, seems to have thought with Philip I. of Spain that time and he were a match even for C\u00e6sar, and entrenching himself at Petra, a short distance south of Dyr rhachium, remained obstinately on the defensive. To this policy of masterly inactivity C\u00e6sar replied by an attempt, which nearly succeeded, to blockade Pompey where he stood. But the extent of ground over which C\u00e6sar had to carry his lines of circumvallation was too great. Just when Pompey was beginning to feel the pressure of scarcity, a weak point in the lines was discovered. Through this he forced his way, inflicting such heavy loss on the enemy that C\u00e6sar, by his own confession, was within an ace of complete and ruinous defeat.1 With Pompey's escape from Petra the last stage of the conflict begins. C\u00e6sar's object now was to draw his enemy away from his natural base of operations on the coast, and transfer the seat of war to the interior. Pompey was expecting reinforcements from the East by way of Macedonia, and C\u00e6sar hoped by marching 1 C\u00e6s., B. C, iii. 42 sqq.

From Apollonia he marched into Thessaly, recalled the two legions previously despatched to hold Pompey's reinforcements in check, and encamped with his entire force near Pharsalus. Pompey followed him, and taking up the fresh troops from the East on his way, encamped at Larissa, in the heart of the Thessalian plain, some miles north of Pharsalus. Eeluctant as ever to risk a decisive engagement, he would have halted there, but the nobles in his camp would hear of no delay,1 and, against his better judgment, he advanced to Pharsalus. Even now, when the two armies were face to face, some days elapsed before a blow was struck. Pompey's position was too strong to be attacked, and he could not be induced to leave it. At last, on August 9, C\u00e6sar, who had resolved by a feigned retreat to decoy the enemy from their vantage ground, noticed that the Pompeians were drawn up in line at a greater distance than usual from the hill on which their camp was placed. He at once abandoned all thoughts of a retreat, and, in spite of his inferiority in numbers, prepared for an instant attack.2 Per ceiving that his chief danger lay in the possibility that, while his centre was engaged, Pompey's numerous cavalry would turn his right wing and take him in the rear, he intrusted that part of his line to the famous tenth legion, and supported it by his cavalry and a 1 C\u00e6s. , B.

Next to these troops C\u00e6sar stationed himself, 'facing that portion of the enemy's line where Pompey himself was in command. The centre he intrusted to Domitius Calvinus, the left to Antony.1 His own infautry numbered in all about 22,000 men, that of the enemy over 45,000. The dis parity in cavalry between the two forces was still greater, and the Pompeians confidently awaited the moment when C\u00e6sar's legions, exhausted by their charge, should be encircled and swept away by the horsemen of the East. When the battle began it seemed as if Pompey's con fidence in the result would be justified. His infantry received without flinching the charge of the C\u00e6sarians, while his cavalry, supported by the archers and slingers, advanced on the left, drove back the cavalry opposed to them, and began the flanking movement which was to decide the fortune of the day. But at this moment the aspect of affairs was suddenly changed by the valour of the six cohorts stationed by C\u00e6sar on his right wing. This reserved body of picked troops charged and routed the Pompeian horsemen, who fled in disorder ; then driving before them the archers and slingers, they fell with fury upon the left flank of the infantry. At the same moment C\u00e6sar ordered the whole of his reserve to advance, and this last movement was decisive. The Pompeian legions, exhausted by 1 C\u00e6s., B.

The victorious C\u00e6sarians, pressing forward, in spite of the mid-day heat, stormed and took the Pompeian camp, and without waiting to seize on the rich spoil it con tained, started in pursuit of the main body of the fugitives. Early the next morning, what remained of Pompey's army, some 24,000 men, surrendered at discretion. So ended the first of the three historic battles, Pharsalus, Philippi, and Actium, which decided the fate of the Eoman world. All three were fought in the debateable land of the Greco-Macedonian peninsula ; all three were in some degree a trial of strength be tween East and West ; and in all, Western discipline and courage triumphed over the less trustworthy levies of the East. Nor must it be forgotten that the success of C\u00e6sar at Pharsalus, like that of his great nephew at Actium, was gained in defence of Eome and Italy, against a would-be invader w-ho, though Eoman, relied chiefly on the resources of the kingdoms of the East. It was consequently with the C\u00e6sars, and not with their opponents, that the growing sentiment of Italian patriotism was allied. Pompey himself had not perished on the scene of his Flight and first defeat. When his camp was stormed he escaped pompey. on horseback to Larissa, and thence to the coast.

From the Thessalian coast he crossed the \u00c6g\u00e6an, over which eighteen years before he had sailed in triumph, to Mitylene, and thence to Cilicia and Cyprus, only to find that the power of his name was gone, and that the East would no longer rise at his call. From Cyprus he went to Egypt, hoping to find an ally in the boy-king Ptolemy, and there, as he landed at Pelusium, he was treacher ously murdered.2 The victory at Pharsalus, followed as it was by the death of his great rival, might have been expected to secure for C\u00e6sar undisputed supremacy, and set him free to reorganise the government of the state. But although the wiser men of the vanquished party, headed by Cicero, accepted defeat,3 C\u00e6sar's own rashness, in the first place, and then the irreconcilable animosity of some of the Pompeian leaders, involved him in a series of fresh conflicts. Hurrying in pursuit of Pompey, he reached Alexandria (October 48 B.C.) with a small force \u2014 only to hear of his death.

It was not until June 47 B.C. that he left for Syria, and 707 a.u.c. was there met by the news that Pharnaces, the son and Defeat of heir of Mithridates the Great, taking advantage of the masterless condition of Asia to renew on a smaller scale his father's ambitious schemes, had defeated Domitius Calvinus, and recovered his hereditary king dom of Pontus.1 Leaving Syria in the charge of Sextus C\u00e6sar, he sailed to Cilicia. In the ' durbar ' held at Tarsus, he hastily arranged the affairs of the province, and then marched through Cappadocia to Pontus \u2014 where a single battle decided the fate of Pharnaces, who was completely defeated at Zela.2 Towards the The African end of 47 B.C.

His civil wars were over, and he was at leisure, not merely to restore order at home, but to frame schemes, worthy of the wide authority he wielded, for the con solidation of the empire. In especial he was anxious to secure it against attack from without, and it was no doubt with this view, as well as from a desire to avenge the defeat of Crassus, and recover the lost standards, that he planned an expedition against Parthia.2 But his dazzling successes, and still more the avowed, though humane, absolution of his government, were intoler able to the Eoman nobles, who could see in his rule only the degradation of their order, and in the ruler nothing but a tyrant of the Greek type.3 On the fated Ides of March 44 B.C. he was attacked in the senate-house and murdered, leaving his task but half accomplished, and the Eoman world a prey to renewed anarchy and civil war. 1 B.

In allotting lands to his veterans, C\u00e6sar carefully avoided any dis turbance of existing owners and occupiers,4 and the mode in which he dealt with the economic crisis pro duced by the war seems to have satisfied all reason able men.5 It had been a common charge against C\u00e6sar in former days that he paid excessive court to 1 Cicero vividly expresses the revulsion of feeling produced by C\u00e6sar's energy, humanity, and moderation on his first appearance in Italy.

His strong hand carried out the scheme so often proposed by the popular leaders since the days of Gaius Gracchus, the colonisation of Carthage and Corinth. Allotments of land on a large scale were made in Italy ; decaying towns were reinforced by fresh drafts of settlers ; on the large estates and cattle farms the owners were required to find employment for a certain amount of free labour ; and a slight and temporary stimulus was given to Italian industry by the re-imposition of harbour dues upon foreign goods.4 To these measures must be added his schemes for the draining of the Fucine Lake and the Pomptine Marshes, for a new road across the Apennines, and for turning the course of the Tiber.5 2 Ibid., 41 ; Dio, xliii. 21, 4 Sueton., 42, 43. i Sueton., 42. a Sueton., 40 ; Dio, xliii. 25. 6 Plut., C\u00e6s., 58 ; Sueton., 44 ; Dio, xliii. 51."], [342, "318 HISTORY OF ROME [Book v. It is true that these vigorous efforts to revive the agra rian prosperity of Italy were made along the old lines laid down eighty years before by the Gracchi, and that their final success was no greater than that of preceding efforts in the same direction ; but they are a proof of the spirit in which C\u00e6sar understood the responsibilities of absolute power, and their failure was due to causes which no legislation could remove. The reform of the calendar x completes a record of administrative reform which entitles C\u00e6sar to the praise of having governed well, whatever may be thought of the validity of his title to govern at all.

Some centralisation of the executive author ity was indispensable, and this part of his work C\u00e6sar thoroughly performed. From the moment -when he seized the moneys in the treasury on his first entry into Eome,2 down to the day of his death, he recognised no other authority but his throughout the empire. He alone directed the policy of Eoman foreign affairs ; the legions were led, and the provinces governed, not by independent magistrates, but by his * legates ' ; 3 and 1 See Mommsen, R.

It was otherwise with the more difficult question of the form under which this new executive authority should be exercised, and the relation it should hold to the republican constitution. We must be con tent to remain in ignorance of the precise shape which C\u00e6sar intended ultimately to give to the new system. The theory that he contemplated a revival of the old Eoman kingship 2 is supported by little more than the popular gossip of the day, and the form under which he actually wielded his authority can hardly have been regarded by so sagacious a statesman as more than a provisional arrangement. This form was that of the dictatorship ; and in favour of the choice it might have been urged that the dictatorship was the office natur ally marked out by republican tradition as the one best suited to carry the state safely through a serious crisis, that the powers it conveyed were wide, that it was as dictator that Sulla had reorganised the state, and that a dictatorship had been spoken of as the readiest means of legalising Pompey's protectorate of the republic in 1 Sueton., 40 ; Dio, xliii. 44.

The choice, nevertheless, was a bad one. It was associated with those very Sullan traditions from which C\u00e6sar was most anxious to sever himself; it implied necessarily the suspension for the time of all constitutional government ; and, lastly, the dictatorship as held by C\u00e6sar could not even plead that it con formed to the old rules and traditions of the office. There was, indeed, a precedent in Sulla's case for a dictator 'reipublic\u00e6 constituend\u00e6 causa,' but C\u00e6sar was not only appointed in an unusual manner, but appointed for an unprecedentedly long period,1 and the ' perpetual dictatorship ' granted him after his crowning victory at Munda (45) was a contradiction in terms and a repudiation of constitutional government which ex cited the bitterest animosity.2 The dictatorship served well enough for the time to give some appearance of legality to C\u00e6sar's autocratic authority, but it was not \u2014 even, it is probable, in his own eyes \u2014 a satisfactory solution of the problem. A second question, hardly less important than the establishment and legislation of a strong central ex ecutive authority over the army and the provinces, was that of the position to be assigned to the old con stitution by the side of this new power. So far as C\u00e6sar himself was concerned, the answer was for the time sufficiently clear. The old constitution was not formally abrogated. The senate met and deliberated ; 1 C\u00e6sar's first dictatorship in 49 was simply ' comitiorum haben dorum causa,' and lasted only eleven days. He was appointed dictator again for one year in 48, for ten years in 46, and for life in 45. - Cicero (Phil., i. 2) praises Antony, ' quum dictatoris nomen . . . propter perpetu\u00e6 dictatur\u00e6 recentem memoriam funditus ex re publica sustulisset.'"], [345, "Ch. i.] THE RULE OF C\u00c6SAR 321 the assembly passed laws and elected magistrates; there were still consuls, pr\u00e6tors, \u00e6diles, qu\u00e6stors, and tribunes ; and C\u00e6sar himself, like his successors, pro fessed to hold his authority by the will of the people. But senate, assembly, and magistrates were all alike subordinated to the paramount authority of the dicta tor ; and this subordination was, in appearance at least, more direct and complete under the rule of C\u00e6sar than under that of Augustus. C\u00e6sar was by nature as impatient as Augustus was tolerant of established forms ; and, dazzled by the splendour of his career of victory, and by his ubiquitous energy and versatility, the Eoman public, high and low, prostrated themselves before him and heaped honours upon him with a reckless profusion which made the existence of any authority by the side of his ow-n an absurdity.1 Hence, under C\u00e6sar, the old constitution wras repeatedly dis regarded, or suspended in a way which contrasted un favourably with the more respectful attitude assumed by Augustus. For .months together Eome was left without any regular magistrates, and was governed like a subject town by C\u00e6sar's prefects.2 At another time a tribune was seen exercising authority outside the city bounds and invested with the ' imperium ' of a pr\u00e6tor.3 At the elections, candidates appeared before the people backed by a written recommendation from the dictator, which was equivalent to a command.4 1 For the long list of these, see Appian, ii. 106 ; Dio, xliii. 43-45 ; Plut., 57 ; Sueton., 76.

Finally, the senate itself was transformed out of all likeness to its former self by the raising of its numbers to 900, and by the admission of old soldiers, sons of freedmen, and even 'semi-barbarous Gauls.'1 But, though C\u00e6sar's high-handed conduct in this respect was not imitated by his immediate successors, yet the main lines of their policy were laid down by him. These were (1) the municipalisation of the old repub lican constitution, and (2) its subordination to the paramount authority of the master of the legions and the provinces. In the first case he only carried further a change already in progress. Of late years the senate had been rapidly losing its hold over the empire at large. Even the ordinary proconsuls were virtually independent potentates, ruling their provinces as they chose, and disposing absolutely of legions which recog nised no authority but theirs. The consuls and pr\u00e6tors of each year had since 81 been stationed in Eome, and immersed in purely municipal business ; and, lastly, since the enfranchisement of Italy, the comitia, though still recognised as the ultimate source of all authority, had become little more than assemblies of the city populace, and their claim to represent the true Eoman people was indignantly questioned, even by republicans like Cicero. The concentration in C\u00e6sar's hands of all authority outside Eome completely and finally severed all real connection between the old institutions of the republic of Eome and the government of the Eoman Empire. And though Augustus and Tiberius elevated the senate to a place beside themselves in this govern ment, its share of the work was a subordinate one, and 1 Sueton., 41, 76; Dio, xliii. 47."], [347, "'06 A.u.c. Ch. i.] THE RULE OF C\u00c6SAR 323 it never again directed the policy of the state ; while, from the time of C\u00e6sar onwards, the old magistracies are merely municipal offices, with a steadily diminishing authority, even in the city, and the comitia retain no other prerogative of imperial importance but that of formally confirming the ruler of the empire in the possession of an authority which is already his. But the institutions of the republic not merely became, wdiat they had originally been, the local institutions of the city of Eome ; they were also subordinated even within these narrow limits to the paramount authority of the man who held in his hands the army and the provinces. And here C\u00e6sar's policy was closely fol lowed by his successors. Autocratic abroad, at home he was the chief magistrate of the commonwealth ; and this position was marked, in his case as in that of those who followed him, by a combination in his person of various powers, and by a general right of precedence, which left no limits to his authority but such as he chose to impose upon himself. During the greater part of his reign he was consul as well as dictator.1 In 48, after his victory at Pharsalus, he was given the ' tribunicia potestas ' for life,2 and after his second success at Thapsus the ' pr\u00e6fectura morum ' for three years.3 As chief magistrate he convenes and presides in the senate, nominates candidates, conducts elections, carries laws in the assembly, and administers justice in court.4 Finally, as a reminder that the chief magis trate of Eome was also the autocratic ruler of the 1 Watson, op. cit, App. x. ; Zumpt, Stud.

Within the frontiers he anticipated Augustus in lightening the financial burdens of the provincials, and in establishing a stricter control over the pro vincial governors, while he went beyond him in his desire to consolidate the empire by extending the Eoman franchise and admitting provincials to a share in the government. He completed the Eomanisation of Italy by his enfranchisement of the Transpadane Gauls, and by establishing throughout the peninsula a uniform system of municipal government, which, under his successors, was gradually extended to the provinces. 1 App., ii. 106; Dio, xliii. 43."], [349, "CHAPTEE II.

The tragedy of the Ides of March was fol lowed, not by a republican restoration, but by a war of succession, a conflict in which even Cicero's eloquence went for little by comparison with the swords of the legionaries. Of the rival claimants to the place which C\u00e6sar had filled, the most conspicuous at the moment of C\u00e6sar's death was Marcus Antonius, once C\u00e6sar's master of the horse, and his lieutenant in Italy, now sole consul, and as such the official head of the state. A brilliant soldier, an effective speaker, and the close friend of the great dictator, he was, as Cicero recog nised, a far more formidable person than either M. \u00c6milius LepidUs or Sextus Pompeius. The former, though a great noble, and governor of the two im portant provinces of Hither Spain and Narbonese Gaul, possessed neither ability nor resolution enough to win for himself the prize to which he aspired. The latter, though he had succeeded in collecting a force, and making good a position in Further Spain,1 was as yet an outlaw, bearing indeed a great name, but a man of whom little was known, and from whom little was feared. Moreover, with both Lepidus and Sextus Pompeius Antony had established friendly relations. He had given his daughter in marriage to Lepidus's son, and promised to secure for the father the office of ' pontifex maximus,' left vacant by C\u00e6sar's death.2 The bribe offered to Sextus was the repeal of the sen tence of outlawry and the restoration of his father's property.3 i Dio, xlv. 10. 2 Hid., xliv. 53. 3 Ibid., xlv. 10."], [351, "Ch. 2.] THE STRUGGLE FOR POWER 327 Matters thus arranged with the only rivals whom he saw any reason to fear, Antony proceeded, in his own reckless fashion, to play the part of C\u00e6sar in Eome. C\u00e6sar's papers had been intrusted to his care by the dictator's widow Calpurnia, and of these he made unscrupulous use ; laws were carried, provinces as signed, exiles recalled, property granted or confiscated ; and for everything Antony professed that he found authority in the 'Acts of C\u00e6sar.'1 The one thing wanting to establish his position, a military command, he proposed to secure by transferring to himself the province of Cisalpine Gaul, with the legions at present in Macedonia.2 But he had now to reckon with an opponent in- ocbmns. finitely more dangerous than Lepidus or Sextus. Gaius Octavius was at Apollonia when his great uncle was murdered. On hearing that C\u00e6sar had made him his heir he crossed to Italy (April 44 B.C.), and travelled 710 a.u.c to Eome to claim his inheritance.3 He was only in his nineteenth year, and, as yet, had little to rely upon but his relationship with C\u00e6sar. But from the first he displayed all the astuteness, self-control, and tena city of purpose which made him ultimately far more than a match for his reckless and headstrong rival.

At the same time he raised a force from among C\u00e6sar's veterans in Campania.1 He was now at the head of a considerable body of troops, but what use he would make of them was still uncertain, and as yet he held no command from senate or people.2 In December, however, Antony arrived in Cisalpine Gaul, shut up D.

The battle ended in his complete defeat. The last of the republican leaders fell by the hand of a friend. His troops, to the number of some 14,000 men, surrendered at discretion ; of his officers, some, like Horace, escaped by flight, others were captured, or avoided capture by suicide.

In carrying out the allotments of land to the veterans, a work which he commenced early in 41 B.C., Octavius provoked a crisis which, for a few months, threatened entirely to ruin his position. Antony's brother Lucius, encouraged and directed by the former's ambitious and unscrupulous wife Fulvia, after failing to get himself associated with Octavius in the business of allotment, came forward as the patron of all those who had been evicted or were threatened with eviction from their lands.1 Supported by these malcontents, by such of the soldiery as bribes or their own attachment to his brother Marcus could detach from Octavius's side, and by a few senators, he formed a formidable party, seized one or two strong places, and prepared to supersede Octavius in the government of Italy. The outbreak of actual hostilities was delayed by fruitless negotiations, but, probably towards the end of the summer, Lucius marched upon Eome, and entered it.

Nevertheless, in July 40 B.C., Octavius 714 a.u.c crossed into Gaul and secured it, while Africa was offered to Lepidus in exchange for his nominal rule of Italy, an offer which Octavius hoped would bind both that province and Lepidus to his own side.

His arguments, backed as they were by Orodes's fiery son Pacorus, prevailed, and the Parthian forces crossed the Euphrates.

The two rivals, who parted from each other after the peace of Misenum in 39 B.C., were destined to meet but once again before the final conflict at Actium. The interval was spent by each in a manner thoroughly characteristic of their different characters. Octavius was engaged without intermis sion in patiently consolidating his power in the West, in restoring prosperity and confidence, and in obliterat ing by good government the memories of the bloodshed and robbery which had stained the commencement of his rule.

The truce which had been patched up between Octavius and Sextus Pompeius (39 B.C.) was but a hollow one.1 It was impossible for the former to leave Sicily longer than he could help in the hands of a rival, and the latter had every reason to suspect that Octavius would only respect the treaty of Misenum while it suited his convenience to do so. The inevit able rupture between them was provoked (38 B.C.) by the treachery of Sextus's freedman and admiral Menas,2 who surrendered Sardinia to Octavius, to gether with the fleet and troops under his command. Octavius had no scruple in profiting by this act of perfidy. Menas wras rewarded with the rank of a Eoman knight, and received a post in the service of his new master. War followed at once ; but though Octavius can have expected no other result, he found to his cost that Sextus's well-equipped fleet and skil ful admirals were far more than a match for his own clumsily handled vessels. In the first sea-fight, off Cum\u00e6, neither side could claim any decided advantage ; but in the second, off the Scyll\u00e6an promontory, the Pompeians, assisted by a storm, completely defeated their enemy.

The legions, which he had deserted, were now harassed on all sides by the light troops of Sextus. Their supplies began to run short, and they were helpless before the attacks of an enemy who obstinately refused to come to close quarters.1 As a last resource, their leader Cornificius resolved to force his way across the island, to effect if possible a junction with Agrippa, who, after defeating Sextus's admiral Demochares off Myl\u00e6, had captured both Myl\u00e6 and Tyndaris. The attempt succeeded, and from this moment the fortune of war changed. Sextus, now fully engaged with Agrippa and Cornificius, was unable to prevent Octavius from again landing in Sicily. At the same time Lepidus at last arrived in the island, and the two joined Cornificius and Agrippa at Myl\u00e6.

His life was spared, but he was deposed from office, and sent a prisoner to Circeii, where he resided until his death in 12 B.C.2 The adventurous career of Sextus Pompeius came to an end in the year following his defeat. He had escaped to Lesbos, intending to seek the protection of Antony. Encouraged, however, by rumours that the latter had met with disaster beyond the Euphrates, he was already forming plans for making himself master of Asia Minor, when he was arrested and put to death by Antony's legates.3 If he achieved nothing else, he at least proved the value of that maritime supremacy, the advantages of which his father had thrown away after his defeat at Pharsalus. For seven years, with a fleet commanded by Greek freedmen, and manned by runaway slaves, he had held his own, and the son of the conqueror of the pirates made a name for himself as the last and the most formidable of the corsair chiefs in the Mediterranean.4 > Sueton., Aug., 16 ; Veil., ii. 80; App., B. ft, v. 123. 2 Sueton., Aug., 16 ; Dio, xlix. 12 ; Livy, Epit, cxxix. 3 Dio, xlix. 17, 18 ; Veil., ii. 79 ; Livy, Epit, cxxxi. 4 Comp.

In Italy itself there was no individual or party able or willing to challenge the supremacy of the conqueror of Sextus. Already men spoke as if the age of civil war was over, and a period of peace and prosperity about to begin.3 But everything depended on the use which Octavius would make of his success.

His return to Eome in November was followed, not by proscriptions and con fiscations, but by vigorous measures for securing the public safety and restoring confidence.

Its formal restoration must, he declared, be postponed until Antony's return ; meanwhile he encouraged the ordinary magistrates to resume their duties. It is true that during his own absences from Italy in 35 and 34 B.C. the maintenance of order was 719, 720 intrusted, as it had been in 36 B.C., to M\u00e6cenas, who ns'A.c was neither a magistrate nor even a senator.1 But the \u00e6dileship of Marcus Agrippa in 33 B.C., with its splen- 721 a.u.c did achievements for the well-being of Eome, was a testimony at once to the good intentions of the new authorities and to their respect for republican tradition.2 At the same time public opinion already pointed clearly to the personal supremacy of Octavius as essential to the welfare of the state. The honours showered upon him on his return from Sicily in 36 B.C., and in par ticular the grant of the tribunician power, at once raised him above the level of a republican magistrate.3 He was already, over one-half of the empire, ' master of all,'4 and with him were already associated the able ministers Agrippa and M\u00e6cenas, whose names were to be inseparably connected with his.

In the summer of 35 B.C. Octavius marched against them.1 The Iapydes were easily quieted, but the Pannonians, a warlike race, who could put 100,000 men in the field,2 offered a more obstinate resistance. The capture, how ever, of their great stronghold Siscia (Sissek), on the Save, broke their spirits for the time, and with the occupation of Siscia by a Eoman garrison the way was prepared for a final establishment of Eoman authority along the lines of the Save and the Drave. Further than this Octavius could not go. In the summer of 33 B.C. the menacing attitude of Antony obliged him to abandon all other schemes and prepare for the final conflict with his colleague and rival. While in the western half of the empire men were already congratulating themselves on the restoration of peace, under the auspices of a second C\u00e6sar, the con dition of the East was worse than ever. Antony had indeed shown no reluctance to play the king ; but his policy, when it ceased to be regulated by his own caprices, was dictated by the overmastering ambition of Cleopatra.

Sosius, had completed the work which Ventidius had begun, by taking Jeru salem and deposing the Parthian nominee Antigonus, while P. Canidius Crassus had temporarily re-established the suzerainty of Eome over the tribes of the Caucasus. In Parthia itself there was a new king, Phraates iv., whose cruelties x had alienated many of the Parthian nobles, and driven one of them, Mon\u00e6ses, to seek a refuge within the Eoman province of Syria. Elated by the favourable turn of events, Antony resolved to in vade Parthia ; but again the enchantments of Cleopatra, whom he had summoned to join him, held him spell bound in the luxurious city of Antioch.2 Here he spent the winter and spring (37-36 B.C.), at one moment 717-718 gratifying his vanity by putting down and setting up kings and princes, at another shocking Eoman feeling by robbing the Eoman people to enrich his Greek mis tress.

Antony hurried to the rescue of his legions, but arrived only to find that Oppius and his troops had been overwhelmed by numbers and cut to pieces. Eeturning to Gazaca, he resumed the siege. Gazaca, how-ever, held out obstinately, while the Parthian and Median forces harassed him by constant attacks and cut off his sup plies. The summer, too, was over, and the approach of winter made it impossible either to advance further or to remain where he was. The inevitable retreat was com menced in October.

Late as the season was, he hurried southwards, through the bleak Armenian highlands, to Syria. The invasion of Parthia had come to nothing, the ' grand army ' was a wreck,1 and though amid the dangers and difficulties of the retreat he had proved himself once more a courageous and skilful soldier, the issue of the campaign inflicted a fatal blow on his prestige.

Artavasdes was induced, under pretence of a friendly conference, to enter the Eoman camp, and was at once imprisoned and deposed, while his son Artaxes, whom the Armenian troops had placed on his father's throne, found resistance hopeless, and fled to Parthia.3 Antony returned to Alexandria, taking with him Artavasdes and his family, and there commemorated in due form his inglorious conquest of Armenia. i Veil., ii. 82. !

His proceedings in Egypt during the next few months (34-33 B.C.) gave convincing proof, not only of the complete ascendency which Cleopatra had gained over him, but of her intention to use that ascendency to wrest the sovereignty of the East from Eome. The Eoman world was startled by the announcement that Cleopatra had been proclaimed ' queen of kings,' 1 that to her and her sons had been assigned the Eoman provinces of Syria, Cilicia, Cyprus, Africa, and the Cyrenaica; and that C\u00e6sarion, her natural son by C\u00e6sar, was openly put forward as the true heir of the great Julius, in opposition to Octavius.2 It was even rumoured that Cleopatra would not be content with the lordship of Asia, which she claimed as the heiress of the Ptolemies, but that she aspired to be enthroned as queen on the Capitol at Eome.3 It was in any case clear that Antony must henceforth be regarded, not as a Eoman triumvir, but as the obsequious servant of a foreign potentate. That a struggle with Antony was inevitable Octavius had for some time foreseen, but that it should come in a form which enlisted Italian sympathy on his own side, as the defender of Eome against oriental aggression, was more than he could have hoped for.

Meanwhile at Eome the tide of indignation against him rose rapidly ; his will, in which Cleopatra's sons were named as his heirs, was discovered and pub lished,3 and the discovery was followed by the news that he had divorced, evidently at the bidding of Cleo patra, his injured wife Octavia. While the indignation was at its height, Octavius struck the decisive blow. Early in 32 B.C. the senate by decree deprived Antony of his command, and declared war upon Cleopatra.4 Once more Octavius had reason to be thankful for his rival's want of promptitude. Antony was, in 32 B.C., far better prepared for war than his opponent. He was in Greece, within striking distance of Italy ; he had a large army, a numerous and well-equipped fleet, and above all, the money, which Octavius could with difficulty raise by fresh demands upon the hardly-tried population of Italy, was showered upon Antony by the lavish hand of Cleopatra.5 Had Antony invaded Italy in 32 B.C. the issue of the war might have been different.

Sending Agrippa forward with a fast-sailing squadron, to occupy Antony's attention by harassing his garrisons on the Peloponnesian coast, and intercepting his sup plies from Egypt and Asia,1 Octavius himself crossed from Brundusium to the Epirot coast, hoping to shut up Antony's fleet in the land-locked gulf where it had lain through the winter, and thus prevent the threatened invasion of Italy. The plan was completely successful. The entrance to the narrow strait which gives access to the Ambraciot gulf is commanded by two promontories. The southern one, crowned by the ancient temple of Actian Apollo, was occupied by the Antonian troops, while close by, and just within the straits, their fleet was moored in the Bay of Prevesa.2 Octavius on his arrival at once stationed his own vessels so as to close the mouth of the straits, while his legions were posted on the northern promontory, and protected by intrench ments from any attack on the landward side. Antony arrived from Patr\u00e6 only to find his fleet imprisoned within the straits, while his enemy was unassailable by land, and in complete command of the open sea.

Antony, however, refused to move, and instead wasted time in useless attempts to invest Octavius's position. Towards the close of the summer Agrippa arrived with his fleet off the mouth of the strait, and a second time his officers implored Antony to retreat, while there was still time, from a. position which was fast becoming untenable. But though his supplies were failing, and though sickness and desertion were thinning his ranks,1 Antony could not bring him self to take a step, which not only was opposed by Cleopatra, but would involve the sacrifice of his fleet, and possibly the withdrawal of his Asiatic allies, whose courage was visibly sinking, and some of whom, notably the astute Greek adventurer Amyntas, had already deserted his cause. He resolved instead to adopt the only alternative open to him, and force a passage to open sea through the blockading fleet. As many of his troops as possible and all his treasure were placed on shipboard,2 and on September 2, 31 B.C.,3 the fleet advanced in close order to the mouth of the strait. In front were the huge unwieldy galleys, which, with then six or even ten banks of oars, their lofty sides, and deck-towers crowded with soldiers, resembled floating castles rather than ships.4 In the rear was the fast sailing Egyptian squadron attached to the service of Cleopatra herself.

The wind freshened, and Antony, to obtain more sea room for his crowded ships, was forced to leave the shelter of the straits and advance into open water. He was instantly attacked in the front and on the flanks. The Antonian vessels fought like ' hoplites in a square,' while Agrippa's light galleys darted hither and thither, now charging at full speed and then as quickly retreat ing out of reach of the fire from the deck towers and of the deadly grappling irons. Suddenly, while the fight was at its hottest, the Egyptian squadron, headed by Cleopatra's own galley, was seen to hoist sail and make for the open sea, followed closely by Antony himself, a piece of selfish treachery and cowardice which, it was afterwards said, had been previously agreed upon be tween the two lovers. Still the Antonian fleet fought on, until, towards the close of the afternoon, the fire balls, with which Octavius supplied his ships, decided the issue of the battle.2 One after another the great ships of this earlier armada took fire, and the rising wind spread the flames with a rapidity which no efforts could check.

Above all, 723'724 r ' A.n.c. it was necessary to recover for himself and for Rome the provinces and vassal states beyond the \u00c6g\u00e6an which Cleopatra had audaciously claimed for her own, and to effect such a settlement of Eastern affairs as would at least secure order until he had leisure to undertake in earnest the work of reorganisation. Of any open resistance to the conqueror of Antony there was little fear, and Octavius's skilful diplomacy made submission easy. The Eoman provinces were at once ' recovered ' for the Eoman state,3 and the Greek cities discovered to their relief that the new general of the Eepublic had some other policy than that of plunder.

Even Artaxes II., son of the Artavasdes whom Antony had treacherously seized and carried off to Egypt, though the ally and almost the vassal of Parthia, was for the present left undisturbed in Greater Armenia.2 Nor, fortunately for Octavius, was Parthia herself in a con dition to necessitate active measures against her. Phraates IV. had in 33 B.C. been expelled by a rival claimant and kinsman Teridates ; and though when Octavius reached Syria in 30 B.C. he was again on the throne, he was in no position to do more than solicit the friendship and alliances of Eome. Octavius, post poning to a future occasion the reclamation of the standards lost at Carrh\u00e6, granted his request, but at the same time conceded to his rival Tiridates an asylum in the province of Syria, where his presence would serve as a wholesome check on any anti-Eoman schemes which Phraates might form.3 1 Plutarch (Ant., 61) gives a list of those who either accompanied Antony to Europe, or sent troops to his aid. 2 Dio, li. 16; Tac, Ann., ii. 3. 8 Dio, li. 18 ; Justinus, 42."], [385, "Ch. 2.] THE CAPTURE OF ALEXANDRIA 361 To the conciliatory policy which Octavius adopted in octavius in the East there was one necessary exception. It was Esyrt impossible to leave Cleopatra in possession even of the semblance of power, and the kingdom of Egypt could not be simply ' mediatised ' like a second-rate native state in Asia Minor. Indeed, Cleopatra had no sooner reached Alexandria in safety, and been there joined by Antony,1 than she gave ample proof that she was still dangerous. Treasures were collected, ships built, the kings and princes of the East were again invited to enrol themselves under the heiress of Alexander, and vague schemes were formed of landings in Gaul or Spain, or of a new empire to be founded in the remote East.2 Even when her newly-built ships were burnt, and her efforts to rally the East around her failed, she did not despair. Determined to save herself and her kingdom, and confident in her powers, she opened negotiations with Octavius (31-30 B.C.). But she had now to deal 723-724 with a nature as crafty and as tenacious of its purpose as her own. Octavius, who was busy in Asia, accepted her gifts, and amused her with empty promises of safety until his work there was done. But in the spring of 30 B.C.3 he advanced from Syria and seized Pelusium, 724 a.u.c while from the west Cornelius Gallus, at the head of some of Antony's old legions, marched upon Alexandria.

Octavius was politic and perhaps chivalrous enough to pay due honour to the remains of his former col league, and of the daughter of a line of kings, whose hold on the reverence of the Egyptian people was still strong. Antony and Cleopatra were buried together in the mausoleum of the Ptolemies. The two boy-kings, who were to have divided between them the empire of the East, were sent to Eome, and found a shelter with Antony's injured wife Octavia.2 For Octavia's own daughters by Antony a more splendid destiny was in store.

Lands -were allotted to the veterans, but the soldiers of Antony shared with his own in the distribution, and the lands taken for allotment were obtained, not as in 43 B.C. by confiscation, but by purchase.4 Antony's Eoman partisans were allowed to return home in peace, i ft /.

Arrears of taxation were cancelled,2 and a munificent largess distributed among the plebs of Eome.3 As a proof of returning confidence, it was noticed that the rate of interest in the capital fell from 12 to 4 per cent.4 Octavius was now as unquestionably supreme as Julius had ever been, and he had already shown that in the use of his power he intended to follow the example, not of Sulla, but of Julius. But he had still to solve the problem which the latter had been forced to leave untouched, that of investing an authority won by the sword with a constitutional character, and of harmonis ing it with the institutions and traditions of the old republic. That such an authority was necessary the experience of a century had conclusively shown ; that as things stood Octavius alone could wield it, was equally clear. But it was also essential that, after twenty years of irregular and provisional rule, the state should have a government not only strong, but legitimate.

On the other hand, a literal restoration of the republic meant renewed anarchy. To the delicate task of re conciling personal rule with at least the forms of repub licanism Octavius now set himself, and no man was ever better fitted for the task. By birth and temperament, in habits of mind and life, he had far more in common with the average Italian than his great uncle, whose daring- genius and dazzling patrician descent from gods and heroes removed him to an infinite distance above the level of ordinary men. But Octavius belonged by birth to that municipal aristocracy1 of which Cicero had been the representative and the panegyrist.2 With this Italian bourgeoisie, which, far more than the nobles or plebs of the capital, represented all that was most healthy and vigorous in the Eoman people, Octavius was naturally in touch. He shared their thrifty habits, their simplicity of life, their respect for respectability, and even the vein of homely superstition, which in him, as in Louis xi. of France, contrasted curiously with great political acuteness and resolute tenacity of purpose.3 To them also his political ideal of a united and imperial Italy was infinitely more attractive than either the self ish narrowness of the nobles, who had ridiculed Cicero as a ' foreigner,' or the spirit of cosmopolitan comprehen siveness which animated Julius. Nor would the more splendid qualities of the great dictator have served Octavius better in the work he had to do than his own 1 His grandfather was a burgher of Velitr\u00e6 ; ' municipalibus magis teriis contentus,' Suet., Aug., 2. 2 gee above, p. 225. 2 See above, p. 225. 3 Suet., Aug., 90-92. 4 Suet., .Aug., 66."], [391, "The settle ment of Jan. 27 B.C. 727 A.u.c. 72(3 A.u.c '27 A.u.c.

To these qualifications he added, as all authorities agree, the art of choosing his friends and ministers well, and retaining them firmly. Both the constitutional settlement which he effected, ' and the mode in which he carried it out, were charac- ! teristic of the man.1 The political drama was skilfully ' arranged, and the chief actor played his difficult part with a success which deserved and has won the applause of the world. The drama opened with a series of measures all calculated to convince Eoman society that a restoration of the old days was seriously intended. The overgrown senate was purged of its unworthy members, and restored to its 'ancient shape and dignity.' 2 The temples and shrines of the gods throughout the city were restored, foreign rites were prohibited,3 and, after an interval of forty years, the solemn purification of the people was duly performed in the Campus Martius.4 In the course of his sixth consulship (28 B.C.), Octavius issued the famous edict5 in which he cancelled the irregular enactments made under the triumvirate, and fixed January 1, 27 B.C., as the day on which he would lay down his extraordinary 1 Mommsen, Staatsr., ii. 707 sqq. ; Herzog., Gesch. u.

He was given the consular imperium for ten years, with the government of certain specified provinces.3 He was, moreover, declared commander-in-chief of all the forces of the state, and granted the exclusive right of levying troops, of making war and peace, and of concluding treaties.4 This authority abroad, an authority wider than that given to Pompey in 67-66 B.C., he was to exercise as consul ; and he would consequently be also the chief magistrate of the state at home, with precedence over all other magistrates in Eome or in the provinces. Finally, in recognition of his pre-eminent services, he was authorised by decree of the senate to assume the cognomen of Augustus.5 Such in its original form was the famous settlement on which in theory the rule of the Eoman C\u00e6sars was based.

The affair was so described by Augustus himself,1 and by the courtly writers of the time.2 The 13th of January 27 B.C., the day on which the settlement was completed, was marked in the calendar as the day on which the re public was restored ; 3 and on coins Augustus was honoured as ' the champion of the freedom of the Eoman people.' 4 But, for the general public, the essence of the matter lay in the recognition by law of the supremacy of C\u00e6sar, and in the establishment not of a republic, but of a personal government. Such was the. view taken by the municipalities of Italy and the provinces, and by Greek provincial writers. To them Augustus was not so much the first citizen of a free commonwealth, as the ' guardian of the Eoman empire, and the governor of the whole world.'5 B\u00b0th versions were, in fact, correct. The republic was in a sense restored ; the old constitutional machinery was set going again ; senate, assembly, and magistrates resumed their old functions.6 Nor was the position assigned to Augustus technically inconsistent with republican law and custom.

Its unreality, and the ambiguities it involved, were increased by the modification which it underwent only four years later. On June 27th, 23 B.C.,1 Augustus laid down the consulship which he had held year by year since 31 B.C. The imperium granted to him for ten years in 27 B.C. he still retained ; but he now held it only ' pro-consule,' like the ordinary governor of a province,2 and it therefore ceased to be valid within the city.3 His renunciation of the consulship entailed also the loss both of the precedence (majus imperium) 1 C. /.

It struck, in short, at the very root of that administrative unity which was essential to the good government of the empire, and threatened to reintroduce the dual control, which had -worked such evil before, of consuls and senate at home, and of powerful proconsuls abroad. In Eome and Italy the liveliest anxiety was excited by the prospect that C\u00e6sar would no longer visibly reign over them, and they pressed upon his acceptance one extraordi nary office after another. All alike were refused as unconstitutional ; 2 but what Augustus lost by resigning the consulship was made good to him by a series of enactments which determined the form of the 'prin cipate' for three centuries to come. In the first place, he was exempted from the disability which attached to the tenure of the ' imperium ' by one who was neither consul nor pr\u00e6tor \u2014 that is to say, he was allowed to retain and to exercise his imperium even in Eome.3 Secondly, his imperium was declared to rank as equal with that of the consuls, and consequently as superior to that of all other holders of imperium at home or abroad.4 Thirdly, he was granted equal rights with the consuls of convening the senate and introducing 1 He would only possess, like Pompey in 67 B.C., ' imperium \u00e6quum in omnibus provinciis cum proconsulibus' ; Veil, ii. 31. 2 He was offered a dictatorship, a life consulship, a ' cura legum et morum.'

Twelve lictors were assigned to him, and an official seat between those of the consuls themselves.4 The proconsular authority was thus for the first time admitted within the walls of Eome, and placed side by side with that of the consuls ; and for the first time the imperium was wielded in the city, as it had long been wielded in the provinces and camps by some one else than the elected magistrates of the year. But Eome could not as yet be openly governed by a proconsul, and Augustus was characteristically anxious to find a title for his authority which should savour less of military autocracy. This he found in the ' tribunician power,' which he had held since 36 B.C. ; and which, from its essentially urban and democratic traditions, was well suited to serve in Eome as ' a term to express his high position.'5 From the year 23 B.C. dates its first appearance after his name in official inscriptions ; G and the numbers appended, to indicate for how many years it had been held, are reckoned from that year.7 It was on this power, as he tells us, that he relied for carry - 1 In 23 B.C. and 22 B.C. ; Dio, liii. 32 and liv. 3 ; Wilm., Exempla, 917 (lex de imperio Vespasiani). 2 This is proved by the practice of Augustus aud Tiberius; Tac, Ann., i. 81. 3 Wilm., Exempla, 917. 4 In 19 B.C. ; Dio, liv. 10. 5 Tac, Ann., iii. 56: ' Summi fastigii vocabulum repperit . . ac tamen appellatione aliqua cetera imperia pr\u00e6mineret.' 6 See the coins with the legend, ' C\u00e6sar Aug. tribun. potest.'

At home, though not consul, he possessed a rank and authority equal to theirs, and took precedence, as they did, of all other magistrates, from the pr\u00e6tors downwards. Abroad, a wide department was committed to his care. His ' pro vincia' included the government of the great frontier provinces, the command of the troops, the control of foreign policy ; while over the governors of the other provinces he enjoyed the same precedence 3 (majus im perium) which he enjoyed in Eome over all magistrates below the consuls. He was distinguished, in addition, by special marks of honour \u2014 the cognomen of Augustus, the laurels in front of his house, the ' civic crown ' above his door.4 The arrangement undoubtedly satisfied the require ments of the moment.

But it was an arrangement avowedly of an exceptional and temporary character. The powers voted to Augustus were, like those voted to Pompey in 67 B.C., voted only to him, and, with the exception of the tribunician power, voted only for a limited time.1 No provision was made for the continuance of the arrangement, after his death, in favour of any other person. And though in fact the powers first granted to Augustus were granted in turn to each of the long line of Eoman C\u00e6sars, the temporary and provisional char acter impressed upon the ' principate ' at its birth clung to it throughout. When the ' princeps' for the time being died or was deposed, it was always in theory an open question whether any other citizen should be invested with the powers he had held. Who the man should be, or how he should be chosen, were questions which it was left to circumstances to answer, and even the powers to be assigned to him were, strictly speaking, determined solely by the discretion of the senate and people in each case. It is true that necessity required that some one must always be selected to fill the posi tion first given to Augustus;2 that accidents, such as kinship by blood or adoption to the last emperor, mili tary ability, popularity with the soldiers or the senate, determined the selection ; 3 and that usage decided that the powers conferred upon the selected person should i Originally for ten years (Dio, liii. 13), it was afterwards renewed for successive periods of five, five, ten, and ten years (ib., liii. 16). s Vit Hadr.,6: ' esse respublica sine imperatore non potest ; Vit.

Under it Augustus was intrusted with a special department of administration, all outside of this remaining under the control of those whom he himself calls his ' colleagues.' 4 Within this department he was as absolute as a provincial governor in his pro vince. Its limits were fixed, and could be altered, in the ordinary way, by decree of the senate or vote of the assembly.

Augustus had been invested also with a 'majus imperium' over all officials of state other than the consuls ; and this was gradually interpreted as giving him and his successors a direct control even over those departments which technically lay outside their jurisdiction. The original independence of pr\u00e6tors in Eome, and of proconsuls abroad, was rapidly lost, and they became as completely subordinate to C\u00e6sar as his own legates ; 3 even the consuls, though in law his equals, found the equality impossible to maintain, when the strength lay all on one side.4 For a period of forty years Augustus himself pre sided over the working of the system which he had established. To gain a clear idea of what he accom plished during that time, it will be convenient to follow as far as possible the chronological order of events. Eoughly speaking, it may be said that from 27 B.C. 1 The number of provinces governed by C\u00e6sar had reached twenty-five. 2 These had all been transferred to C\u00e6sar by the end of the reign of Claudius, and most of them in the lifetime of Augustus. 3 See Diet Antiq., s.v.

From October 19 B.C. until some time early in 16 B.C. he was busily engaged at Eome in the work of domestic reform, and to this period belongs the great series of the Julian laws. By the close of the ten years' term, for which his imperium had originally been voted to him, he had at least laid the foundations of that new and better order of things at home and abroad, the commencement of which was commemo rated by the celebration of the S\u00e6cular games in June 17 B.C.1 During the remainder of his principate, though many important reforms were made, the ques tions which came most prominently forward were those of the relations of the empire to the northern barbarians, and of the designation of a successor to Augustus himself. To the existing number of provinces Augustus added thirteen, eight of which were created by him while re organising the provinces between 27 and 19 B.C. With the annexation of Egypt, the north coast of Africa from the mouths of the Nile to the eastern frontiers of Mauretania became Eoman territory.

It was, however, by Augustus that the regular provincial system was first introduced, and to him without doubt was due the creation of the ' three Gauls,' as they were commonly called, Aquitania, Lugdunensis, and Belgica.2 In the eastern half of the empire the only important addition to Eoman territory was made in 25 B.C., when, on the death of Amyntas, the dominions granted to him by Antony in 37 B.C., and secured to him by Augustus in 30 B.C., were annexed, and the two provinces of Galatia and Pamphylia established.3 The work accomplished by Augustus during the first The ten years of his principate was not however limited to c\u2122\"s the creation of these new provinces. Of still greater importance were the reforms he effected in the system of provincial administration. Among these the first place must be given to the establishment of an effective, central, controlling authority. Under the republic the provinces had been so many isolated 2)rincipalities, each governed at discretion by its own proconsul, who, though nominally subject to the authority of consuls, senate, and people at home, was in reality an autocrat.

Hither Spain, the wEole of Gaul, Syria, and Egypt had been assigned to Augustus. To these were added, before 19 B.C., Lusitania in the west, and in the east Cilicia, Galatia, and Pamphylia. The group of frontier provinces formed after 16 B.C., M\u0153sia, Pannonia, Noricum, and E\u00e6tia, were also assigned to C\u00e6sar. Over the whole of this immense area, which included the most warlike, populous, and wealthy ter ritories of the empire, Augustus wras absolute master, as absolute as Cicero in Cilicia or Verres in Sicily. Within what was really one great province the admini stration was conducted by men who were nothing more than his subordinate officers, appointed only by him, responsible to him alone, and holding office at his good pleasure. Highest in rank among them were the ' legati ' \u2014 senators of consular or pr\u00e6torian rank \u2014 to whom was intrusted the charge of the more important provinces. Below the ' legati ' in dignity stood the ' procuratores,' the agents or stewards of C\u00e6sar, men, at the highest, of only equestrian rank, to some of whom was given the government of a minor province,1 to others the management of the provincial finances and of the property of C\u00e6sar. We meet also, as under Cicero in Cilicia, with ' pr\u00e6fecti,' pre-eminent among whom was the prefect, who now ruled in C\u00e6sar's name, and in the room of her former kings, over the wealthy pro vince of Egypt.2 The importance of this change, which concentrated three-fourths of the empire under the sole and direct control of C\u00e6sar and his personal servants, can scarcely be over-estimated.

It was conspicuously free from the graver defects of the republican method of administration. The men sent by C\u00e6sar to govern his provinces did not owe their appointments to the chances of lot, but were freely selected by their chief. Efficiency 'was rewarded by promotion, and under Augustus, as well as under Tiberius, a capable admini strator was sure of continuous employment. Thus pro vincial administration became a career to which men devoted years of their lives, and these trained experts contrasted favourably with the amateur governors of republican days. Nor did C\u00e6sar's officials enjoy the dangerously irresponsible and absolute authority pos sessed by the republican proconsul. The legate of C\u00e6sar had soldiers under him, but they were the sol diers of C\u00e6sar, by whom they were enrolled and dis charged, and from whom they received their pay during service, and their rewards on leaving it. The legate might have the conduct of a war, but it was waged under the auspices of C\u00e6sar ; it was C\u00e6sar whom the soldiers saluted as imperator after a victory, and to C\u00e6sar belonged the triumph.1 In the ordinary business of government the legate was subject to the directions 1 It was treasonable for a legate to levy troops or wage a war : ' in jussu principis,' Dig., xlviii. 4, 3 ; Tac, Ann., vi. 3 : 'quid illi cum militibus quos neque dicta neque pr\u0153mia nisi ab imperatore accipere par esset,'"], [406, "The ' public provinces.' 382 HISTORY OF ROME [Book v. of his superior, whose mandates and rescripts carried infinitely more weight than decrees of the senate had ever done. From his decisions there lay that appeal to C\u00e6sar, as the higher power, which gradually became as dear to the provincials as the old appeal to the people had been to the Eoman citizen. Nor was the legate the sole authority within his province. The management of the finances, which had formerly been vested in the proconsul, was now intrusted to a ' pro curator,' who, unlike the qu\u00e6stor of former times, was not a mere subordinate, but an independent official, directly responsible to C\u00e6sar himself, and in conse quence a real check upon the legate. In the provinces which were not his own, the re forming energy of Augustus had less free scope ; and in these ' public provinces ' the evils and abuses of the old system still lingered. But though the same careful selection of the officials, and the strict personal super vision over them were not possible here, yet a con siderable improvement was effected.1 The proconsuls of the public provinces were still selected by lot from among the ' consulares ' and ' pr\u00e6torii,' of at least five years' standing, they still took out with them a qu\u00e6stor and legate, and their term of office was limited to a single year.2 Technically, too, they were responsible as before, not to C\u00e6sar, but to the consuls and senate.3 1 Suet., Aug., 47: ' provincias validiores ipse suscepit . . . cetera proconsulibus sortito permisit.'

The majority of the ' public provinces ' were situate in the peaceful central districts of the empire, where few troops were needed, and questions of frontier policy did not arise.1 In any case the supreme military authority, and the exclusive control of foreign affairs, now belonged to the 'princeps.' In financial matters, too, the procon sul's powers were restricted. The right of making requisitions within his province, the most fruitful source of oppression under the republic, was taken away ; and of the revenues drawn from the province, all those appropriated to C\u00e6sar were managed not by himself or his qu\u00e6stor, but by C\u00e6sar's procurators. It would seem, too, that the discretionary power for merly enjoyed by proconsuls in granting freedom or immunity to provincial communities, and in enfranchis ing individual provincials, was, if not taken aw-ay from them, yet rarely if ever exercised. Above all, the ' majus imperium ' granted to Augustus over pro consuls was interpreted by both parties in such a way as to give the former a real control even over the public provinces. We read of instances in which appeals from such provinces are heard by him, and not by the consuls and senate, and of instructions issued by him to proconsuls, as well as to his own legates; while in the course of his journeys between 27-19 B.C. he visited and arranged the affairs of public provinces such as Sicily or Bithynia, as well as those of Gaul or i Tac, Hist, iv. 48 : ' provinci\u00e6 inermes.'"], [408, "HISTORY OF ROME [Book v. 384 Financial reforms.

The division of authority in the provinces was real enough to hamper and delay reform, but it can scarcely be said to have ever seriously impaired the supremacy of C\u00e6sar. Twenty years of civil war following upon a century and a half of extravagance, mismanagement, and pecula tion had producedcompletefinancial exhaustion through out the greater part of the empire. The change from this state of things to the widely diffused prosperity, of which Pliny's Natural History gives perhaps the best picture, was not wholly due to the reforms which Augustus introduced into the financial system. We must take into account the cessation of the desolating wars which had left scarcely a single province untouched, the re-establishment of settled government, the suppression of brigandage by land and piracy by sea, and the improvements effected in the means of communication. Yet the financial system, of which he at least laid down the main lines, played an important part. Under the republic there was no possibility of estimating either the income or the expenditure of the empire as a whole, and neither over income or expenditure was there any central con trol. It was Augustus who first attempted to lay a sound foundation for an imperial system of finance, by obtaining an estimate of the resources of the state. He compiled a statistical survey, which included great part, if not all, of the empire ; and brought together a"], [409, "Ch. 3.] THE PROVINCES 385 vast mass of information as to the number and status of the communities in each province.1 The imperial census, which was so prominent an institution in the second century A.D., with its elabo rate returns of land and owners, was but a develop ment of the census taken by Augustus's orders in his own provinces.2 It seems probable, too, that on the basis of this census he established the two great im perial taxes which replaced the miscellaneous imports levied under the republic, the land-tax, and the tax on personal property. Over the revenue raised and over its expenditure Augustus had complete control within the limits of his own provinces ; and even out side these limits, over the revenues accruing to the old state treasury, and over their expenditure, both in Eome and in the provinces, he exercised an authority which, if less direct,3 was not less real. From him dates consequently the first approach to anything like a comprehensive imperial budget. He published year by year the accounts of the empire,4 and he left behind him after his death a complete statement of the financial condition of the empire.5 In other ways, also, he brought relief to the provincials. The multifarious requisitions, legal and illegal, which Eoman officials had been accustomed to levy were abolished, and fixed 1 On the survey and census of Augustus, see generally Marquardt, Staatsverio., ii. 198-599; Hirschfeld, Untersuchungen, pp. 1-52. 2 E.g. in Gaul, Livy, Epit, cxxxiv. ; Dio, liii. 22; Tac, Ann., i. 31 ; in Syria, Luke ii. 1 ; in Lusitania, Wilmanns, 1608. 3 It seems to have been exercised through a decree of the senate. 4 Suet., Calig., 16 : 'rationes imperii ab Augusto proponi solitas.' 6 Tac, Ann., i. 1 ; Suet., Aug., 101. 2 B"], [410, "C\u00e6sar-wor ship and the provincial councils. 386 HISTORY OF ROME [Bookv. allowances substituted.1 The resources of the pro vinces were developed by a liberal expenditure on public works, while provincial commerce and industry were freed from the crippling restrictions which the republic had imposed upon them. Finally, whereas hitherto the burden of taxation had fallen mainly on the provincials, Augustus, while maintaining the immunity of Italian soil from tribute, forced Eoman citizens to bear a share, if not a large one, of the cost of governing and protecting the empire.2 The aim which Julius is said to have placed before himself of welding the diverse communities and races of the empire into a single state, with equal laws and rights, was not the aim of Augustus. While improving the government of the provinces, he held fast to the political ascendency of Eome and Italy, and to the dis tinction between the Eoman state and its dependent allies. With the policy of assimilation, initiated by Julius, and revived by the Flavian emperors, he had little sympathy.3 But if the bond of union created by the spread of Eoman citizenship, Eoman law, and Eoman municipal institutions was the work of his successors, it was otherwise with the powerful tie of allegiance to the central authority of C\u00e6sar. The public homage which a province had previously paid to its own governor for the time was now transferred to the joint names of Eome and Augustus. The altars of Eome and Augustus, established in all parts of the empire, were ' Suet., Aug., 36. 2 Especially by means of the legacy duty, established in 6 a.d. ; Suet., Aug., 49; Dio, lv. 25. 3 Suet., Aug., 40 : ' civitatem Romanam parcissime dedit.'"], [411, "Ch. 3.] DOMESTIC REFORMS 387 visible symbols at once of imperial unity and of the supremacy of C\u00e6sar ; the sacrifices and games performed in connection with them constituted an imperial festival common to all provincials. With the altar was asso ciated the provincial council, the mouthpiece of provin cial opinion, and the priesthood of Augustus became the great prize to which provincial ambition aspired.1 The whole group of institutions, altar, festival, council, and priesthood, form a significant contrast to the professions of a limited and temporary authority, and of deference to a restored republic which accompanied the settlement of 27 B.C. In October 19 B.C. Augustus returned to Eome from Domestic the East. The reorganisation of the provinces and of 735 A \u201e',, the provincial administration was practically completed, and he now turned his attention to Eome and Italy. But though the legislation of the next two years (18-17 730-737 B.C.) was regarded by himself and by the public as in- augurating a new and better age for the Eoman people,2 it can only be fairly judged if taken in connection with his general domestic policy. The formal restoration of the republic nine years before -was of little use by itself. The old constitutional machinery needed both repair and alteration before it could be adapted to the new situation. The fabric of Eoman society, shattered by half a century of revolution and civil war, had to be reconstituted, 1 For details as to the provincial councils, see Marquardt, Staats verui., i. 366 ; Mommsen, R.

Tli Assembly 388 HISTORY OF ROME [Book v. and finally, alike in the city and in Italy, an efficient system of administration had to be created. In the performance of these difficult tasks Augustus fol lowed steadily the policy which had guided his actions in 27 B.C. The political, social, and administrative order, which he established, was outwardly based on a restoration of what had existed before. In reality it was a new order, created by himself, subject to his con trol, and stamped ineffaceably with the impress of his own name. Not the least delicate of the problems with which he had to deal was that of adjusting the relations between his own authority and the ancient prerogatives of the assembly, senate, and magistrates. To abolish them was impossible, and it was as impossible to restore them to their former supremacy and vigour. Under the policy laid down by Augustus these venerable institutions were preserved as stately and picturesque survivals, but their sphere of action was carefully limited, and, even within the limits marked out for them, they acted, with rare exceptions, only on his impulse, and under his direction. It was a policy which saved the dignity of the republic, and gratified the amour propre of the Eoman nobility and populace without seriously impairing the supremacy of C\u00e6sar. At the same time it was a policy which scarcely any one but Augustus could have carried out, and which overtaxed the patience of his successors. The ancient assemblies of the ' populus ' and ' plebs ' had long ceased to represent effectively the Eoman people, and that the disorderly city populace, of which they were ordinarily composed, should exercise any real"], [413, "The Magis. tracies. Ch. 3.] DOMESTIC REFORMS 389 sovereignty was out of the question. It is true that Augustus ' restored their ancient rights,' J and while he lived they continued to elect the magistrates of the year, and occasionally to pass laws.2 The corruption and disorder which accompanied their proceedings were checked,3 and the political clubs which were the chief source of both, were suppressed.4 But their power was gone, never to return. As electors they did little more than accept the candidates put forward by Augustus,5 in legislation they simply approved the measures intro duced by him or at his suggestion. The consultation of the people had, by the end of his reign, become merely a troublesome formality, of little interest except for the students of Eoman antiquities. The sovereignty of the people, as the ultimate source of all authority, was never denied ; it was, indeed, the foundation on which, in theory, the authority of C\u00e6sar rested,6 but it was in reality only a convenient fiction, and in the history of the empire the Eoman ' comitia ' play no part. Next in importance to the maxim of the sovereignty of the people was that of the supremacy of the magis trates, consuls, and pr\u00e6tors to whom, year by year, the people intrusted the ' imperium.' It was true that for more than half a century these magistrates had ceased to exercise their authority outside Italy. But though 1 Suet., Aug., 40 : 'comitiorum pristinum jus reduxit.' 2 Such as the Leges Juli\u00e6, proposed by Augustus himself, the Lex Papia Popp\u00e6a carried by the consuls of 9 A.D., or the Lex \u00c6lia Sentia, 4 a.d. 3 For the Lex Julia ' de ambitu,' Suet., Aug. , 34, 40 ; Dio, lxiv. 16, lv. 5 ; Paulius Sent., v. 30. 4 Suet, Aug., 32 ; Dio, lxiv. 2. 5 Dio, lxiii. 21 : 01) ptvroi tirpaTTerb ti 6 fii) Kal Zkuvov ijpeo-Ke. 6 Gaius, i. 5 : ' cum ipse imperator per legeni imperium accipiat.'"], [414, "390 HISTORY OF ROME [Booky. they no longer led the legions or governed provinces, they were still the chief executive officers of the state, to whom all other officials were at least in theory sub ordinate, and above them there was no authority but that of the people from whom their powers were derived. But there was now in the state an authority the equal of theirs in rank, derived like theirs directly from the people, and backed by overwhelming force. Augustus was indeed careful to respect the dignity of his sup posed colleagues, but a real partnership in the govern ment of the empire was out of the question. Even during his lifetime their relation to him became that of subordinates rather than equals. Though still elected by the people, it was the approval of C\u00e6sar rather than of the voters that was essential to success. His nomi nation, and still more his personal recommendation of a candidate, were decisive.1 The change by which these magistracies became merely places of preferment at C\u00e6sar's disposal was gradual, but it may be said that, even by the end of Augustus's reign, the creation of consuls and pr\u00e6tors might be described in the words used by Ulpian two centuries later, as a matter lying wholly within the discretion of the princeps.2 Once elected, consuls and pr\u00e6tors alike were necessarily over shadowed by the dominant authority of C\u00e6sar.

Even the paramount authority over the 'public pro vinces,' which belonged of right to the consuls, had in practice to give way to the ' majus imperium ' enjoyed by the princeps.1 In Eome and Italy their position was not much better. The consuls could still be described as responsible for the safety of the commonwealth,2 but the responsibility became nominal when one depart ment after another of the home administration was transferred to C\u00e6sar. Within the lifetime of Augustus the care of the corn and water supply of Eome, the maintenance of public order in the city and the public roads in Italy, the protection of the coasts, had passed into the hands of C\u00e6sar and his officials.3 Even within the limited area left open to them, they had to face the dangerous rivalry of a co-ordinate imperial authority. C\u00e6sar was equally competent with the consuls to con voke the assembly, to hold elections and propose legisla tion, to convene the senate, and consult it, and as able as the pr\u00e6tors to expound and administer the civil law. Under these circumstances independence was impossible. The old republican magistracies, though they continued to be attractive posts, conferring social distinction, and leading on to legateships and proconsulships abroad, gradually became in all but the name subordinate offices, with purely departmental duties under the control and supervision of C\u00e6sar.4 1 See above. 2 Tac, *4nn., iv. 19; ' cujus vigiliis niteretur respublica.'

Composition of the senate. Augustus had inaugurated his work of constitutional restoration by a purification of the senate. Its un wieldy numbers wrere reduced, and unworthy members expelled ; decency and order were restored in its pro ceedings.1 But it was no part of Augustus's policy to replace the senate in the position of ascendency which it had formerly occupied. Its dignity was respected, the privileges and distinctions enjoyed by its members were maintained and enlarged, while the declining importance of the ' comitia ' and of the old magistracies increased its prestige. But its control of the policy of the state was gone for ever. The part assigned to it by Augustus was indeed dignified and useful, but it was a subordinate and not a leading part. With the important question of the composition of the senate Augustus dealt in a manner which enabled him, without too rudely wounding the pride of the old nobility, to bring the senate in this respect into harmony with the new system. In the first place, admission to the senate henceforward depended on his favour. Election to the qu\u00e6storship continued to entitle a man to a seat in the senate, but over the elections to the qu\u00e6storship Augustus's rights of nomination and commendation gave him full control. The -direct admission of persons not so qualified was an ancient magisterial prerogative, which, during the last century of the republic, had fallen into disuse.

If we except the three occasions on which he carried out a wholesale revision of the senatorial register,2 he seems to have abstained from the use of this method, which under the name of ' adlectio ' became so popular with his successors. The means he employed were more in direct but not less effective. From him apparently dates the rule, written or unwritten, that candidates for the qu\u00e6storship must be persons entitled to wear the ' latus clavus,' the broad purple stripe distinctive of the senator.3 This right Augustus granted to all sons of senators,4 but he could at his discretion confer it upon any one he pleased, and thus indirectly open the door of the senate-house to those whom he delighted to honour.5 Augustus, moreover, could not only admit, he could also expel, and that not only at the periodic ' lectiones,' but on the occasion of his yearly revision of the senatorial roll.6 Such powers clearly placed the composition of the senate at his mercy, and in his use of them a definite aim is plainly visible.

Under the later republic the senate had been closely identified with the nobles, from whose ranks the great majority of the senators were drawn. But the nobility not only of a patrician Cornelius or Julius, but of a Sempronius Gracchus or a C\u00e6cilius Metellus, was not derived from the seat in the senate, to which almost as a matter of course he attained. Noble they were born, and noble they remained. This nobility Augustus proposed to replace by one based entirely upon the senate. Hitherto most nobles had become senators, in future only senators were to be noble. The change was gradually made. The re publican nobility was left as it stood. But outside the narrowing circle of the old families a new aristocracy was slowly formed. The starting-point was the per mission to wear the broad stripe. This privilege was granted to all sons of senators as a right, to others by special grant of the emperor. The recipients ranked thenceforward as members of the senatorial order, sharing many of the privileges, and bound by many of the obligations attaching to actual senators.2 On 1 Mommsen, Staatsr., iii. 466. 2 They were allowed to be present at meetings of the senate (Suet., Aug., 38) ; in the legion they were distinguished from other officers as ' tribuni laticlavii ' ; they shared the exemption granted to actual senators from municipal burdens, and were prohibited like them from intermarriage with freedwomen.

But even a senator's son, if through poverty 3 or disinclination he abstained from taking his seat, forfeited his rank.4 This new senatorial nobility was thus in a sense hereditary, but its transmission from father to son depended on the approval of C\u00e6sar ; it could by him be given to those who had no claim to it by birth, and he could, by expulsion from the senate, take it away. The senate had never, in law, possessed any other prerogative but that of advising the magistrates when consulted. This function it continued to discharge. But its advice was no longer asked as a matter of course, nor when given was it equivalent to a com mand. It was still consulted, as formerly, by the regular magistrates on matters affecting their own departments. But the great questions of policy, which the republican consuls had habitually referred to the senate, were beyond the province of their successors under the empire, and even less important matters were not 1 The minimum age for the qu\u00e6storship was fixed by Augustus at twenty-five; Dio, lxii. 20.

Dio (lxiv. 26) mentions a case in which Augustus compelled such persons to enter the senate. 3 A property qualification of 1,000,000 sesterces was necessary for candidates for the qu\u00e6storship, i.e. for the senate. According to Dio (lxiv. 17) it was instituted by Augustus in 18 B.C. Cf.

For these purposes both Augustus and the C\u00e6sars who followed him made frequent use of the senate. To govern by decree of the senate rather than by edict gave a constitutional appearance to their rule, and lightened their personal responsibility. But between a decree of the senate passed on the proposal of C\u00e6sar, and an edict issued on C\u00e6sar's sole authority, there was little more than a formal difference. Of the senate it may be said, as was said of the comitia, that nothing was done which C\u00e6sar did not approve. In outward splendour and dignity the senatorial order gained rather than lost,5 and the wealth and 1 The reluctance of the senate and magistrates to decide, or even discuss, questions on their own authority is evident in the reign of Tiberius ; Tac, Ann., ii. 35, iii. 32. 2 Ibid. , i. 74 : ' quo loco censebis, C\u00e6sar, si primus, habebo quod sequar.' 3 Ibid., i. 13, iii. 70. 4 Compare the list of matters on which Tiberius consulted the senate ; Suet., Tib., 30. 5 Mommsen, Staatsr., iii. 886."], [421, "Ch. 3.] DOMESTIC REFORMS 397 influence of its members made them not unfrequently formidable rivals to the emperor.1 As an institution the senate itself commanded the respect of the empire, and the warm loyalty of men who, like Tacitus, saw in it the one surviving representative of the free re public. But the position which it had enjoyed during the period of the great wars, and which Cicero claimed for it as its right, it never regained. The religious and social reforms of Augustus exhibit Religious the same spirit of compromise between the old and the ref0rms. new which appears in his treatment of the republican institutions. Just as he had refused to follow Julius in opening the doors of the senate-house to provincials, or in largely extending the Eoman franchise, so he upheld the ascendency of the old gods of Eome against alien deities,2 of the old Eoman dress and manners against foreign fashions, and carefully maintained the distinctive pre-eminence of the freeborn Eoman citizens, the imperial race, over provincials, freedmen, and slaves. But the Eome which he restored was not the narrow city state which had refused to enfranchise the Italians, and which despised Cicero as a foreigner. It was the wider Eome, co-extensive with the limits of Italy, whose faith and manners he re-established, and whose patriotic pride he endeavoured to stimulate. And with this revived faith in the old gods and loyalty to the old manners and traditions was dexterously 1 Cf.

On his scheme of reform, as on the altars in the province, the names of Eome and Augustus were jointly inscribed. The ideal which he presented to a community wearied with civil war, and sick of the faction fights and corruption which made up politics in the city, was that of a united and imperial Italy, proud of its great past, faithful to the gods and to the virtues by which ' the Latin name and the strength of Italy had grown great,' 1 and performing its mission of ruling the world under the guidance of a man who by descent was on one side Italian to the core, and on the other traced his ancestry back to the founders of Eome and to the gods of the city, and who by divine favour and help had saved Eome and Italy alike from a foreign foe. The lesson was taught in a hundred different ways. The gods whose ruined temples he rebuilt,2 and whose ancient festivals he revived,3 were for the most part the older deities whose worship was common to all Italians. Such were Jupiter, Juno, Mars, the Dea Dia, the Penates and Lares.4 But side by side with the temples of the old national gods rose others which 1 Horace, Od. , iv. 15, 12 : ' veteres revocavit artes per quas Latinum nomen et Ital\u00e6 crevere vires.

The temple of the 'deified Julius' in the old forum, and that of Mars the Avenger 1 in the new forum of Augustus, commemorated the ser vices of the great dictator and the vengeance which had overtaken his murderers. More impressive than either was the temple built on the Palatine Hill,2 on the site of the city of Eomulus, and dedicated to the god Apollo, who, from his shrine at Actium, had helped to win the day for Eome. To these memorial temples must be added the numerous public prayers, thanks givings, and festivals in which the safety of Augustus was prayed for, and his victories, his services,3 even the chief anniversaries of his life, were commemorated. From this close association with the gods to his enrol ment among their number was not a long step. Officially, indeed, Augustus was not added to the list of gods wor shipped by the Eoman people until after his death. Yet during his life he was clearly in the eyes of the people, and not only in the language of courtly poets, ' a present deity.' 4 In the country towns of Italy there were temples of Augustus and priests of Augustus.'6 In 1 Mon.

The measures by which Augustus endeavoured to re form the morals of the time were as much dictated by political considerations as his reform of religion. In order to preserve the purity and vigour of the ruling race,2 he endeavoured to bring back society to the simpler and purer life which had once been the glory of Eome, and which still flourished in the country districts of Italy. At the same time, while reforming society, he strove to bring its arrangements into harmony with the new order of things and with his own policy. Side by side with such measures as the Lex Julia de adulteriis,3 with the regulations enforcing decency at public shows and games, and restricting extravagance in dress or at the table,4 we find provisions of a different character. 1 Ovid, Ep., ii. 8, 9 ; Hor., Od., iv. 5, 31 ; Dio, li. 19 ; for this worship in the vici of Rome, Ovid, Fasti, v. 145 : ' vicinumina trina colunt.'

To some extent, also, it merely followed the lines of class division already recognised in the clays of Cicero ; but in stamping these with the sanction of law it prepared the way for that rigid caste-system which in the third and fourth centuries paralysed the energies of the empire. The highest place in this social hierarchy was occupied by the sena- me senate. torial order, which replaced the old nobility, and which became gradually known as the ' amplissimus ordo.' Immediately below it stood the order of knights, The Knights. an order which had existed in name under the re public.

Of this corps of knights Augustus formed a second ' order,' even more closely dependent upon himself than the senatorial. Admission to it was granted only by him.5 By him or by his officers the roll of the order was revised, the unworthy expelled, and the meritorious occasionally promoted to senatorial dignity.6 As at the head of the roll of senators his own name was placed,7 so the first place in the order of knights was filled by the younger members of his house.8 The titular knighthood of Cicero's days had been hereditary, like the titular nobility, and the i Mommsen (Staatsr., iii. 476-569) has for the first time clearly explained Augustus's policy with regard to the ' equites.' 2 From the time of Augustus, all ' equites Romani ' are ' equites equo publico,' i.e. members of the corps.

But the son of a Eoman knight, under the arrangements of Augustus, had no such claim. The rank was strictly personal, and no one had any title to it unless himself admitted to the corps by the emperor. To this second order was assigned a career which in time became as definite and well understood as that assigned to the order above it. For the latter were reserved the old republican magistracies from the qu\u00e6storship upwards, the governorships of the public provinces, and of the more important of these belonging to C\u00e6sar. It was on the other hand from among the knights that Augustus recruited his own service. Though the highest posts in that service, the legateships, were filled by senators, and the lowest by freedmen or slaves, yet to knights were given the governorships of Egypt, E\u00e6tia, and Noricum ; the prefectures of the pr\u00e6torian guard, of the city police, and of the corn-supply. They com manded the naval squadrons at Misenum and Eavenna, and in some cases took charge, as procurators, of the revenues of C\u00e6sar's provinces. Of the future develop ment of this order of knights this is not the place to speak ; but to Augustus it rendered valuable service by attaching to him the middle class of Italy, from whom its members were chiefly drawn, and to whom it offered a rank and career which at once gratified their ambition and bound them closely to C\u00e6sar as their patron. Below the two orders of senate and knights stood the ' plebs,' a term which had long ceased to denote merely"], [428, "404 HISTORY OF ROME [Bookv. the non-patrician element in the community, and was used to designate the common people, the ' tenniores ' or ' humiliores,' as they were already frequently styled.1 Politically, however, the term had a narrower applica tion still. It denoted par excellence the populace of the city of Eome, the ' plebs urbana ' 2 which had, in the latter days of the republic, posed as the representative of the ' populus Eomanus.' It was this plebs which had, as a rule, exercised the prerogatives of the people, had elected magistrates and passed laws, and it was for its benefit that games were exhibited, corn distributed, and money lavished in bribery. At the same time it was in danger of ceasing to be Eoman except in name, owing to the admixture of alien blood. Augustus, true to his policy of maintaining the ascendency and purity of the imperial race, attempted, though without much success, to check this evil. He placed a variety of restrictions on the emancipation of slaves, and slaves of bad character, even if freed, were debarred from Eoman citizenship,3 it is even possible that all freedmen were deprived of the right to vote, not, as things stood, a very serious penalty.4 In a similar spirit he strove to awaken self respect by enforcing the wearing of the toga,5 and main taining decency and order at the public shows and games.

The eager, stirring, municipal life, which in the Italian towns was an effective substi tute for politics, was impossible in Eome, which, like London, had neither municipal life or organisation. The ' plebs Eomana ' was indeed only the city populace, and the annual magistrates whom it elected were in their duties not much more than local officials, but both alike still claimed to be the ruling autho rities, not merely of the city of Eome, but of the Eoman State : Eome could not yet be treated as one, if the first, of the municipalities of the empire. Nor on the other hand could Augustus safely deprive the plebs of its pleasures and emoluments. The distributions of corn, the largesses of money, were continued, the games were more numerous and more splendid than ever.1 Yet he did something to provide the Eoman plebs with more wholesome interests. It is possible that his re construction of the city wards (vici) with their annually elected headmen (magistri) was meant as a step towards a system of municipal government, and though in this direction there was no further advance, yet the ward, with its common worship, chapel and festivals, remained a centre of corporate life, and the position of ' magister vici ' an object of plebeian ambition.2 Of far more 1 Mon.

That Augustus was not unfavourable to them is also implied by their existence among the recipients of the imperial doles of corn, the ' plebs frumentaria,' a body under constant supervision by imperial officials.4 Lastly, this plebs was bound by special ties to the 7 B.C. ; comp.

Of its rapid growth we shall speak elsewhere,1 but no change made by Augustus was more significant of the revolution which had really taken place, than that which placed Eome, as if it were a small provincial district, under the control of a prefect.2 Lower in rank and importance than the prefect of the city was the ' pr\u00e6 fectus vigilum.' 3 In 22 B.C. Augustus had created a body of slave-firemen, whom he placed at the disposal of the \u00e6diles, for the extinction of fires.4 In 7 B.C. this duty and the firemen with it were trans ferred to the magistri vicorum.5 Finally, in 6 A.D., Augustus was compelled to appoint a prefect of his own, who was not merely the chief of a fire brigade, but had also a police jurisdiction over incendiaries, burglars, and other nocturnal disturbers of the peace.6 Both the city prefect and the prefectus vigilum had, moreover, what no republican magistrate had ever possessed in the city, a regular and numerous force of police.7 The establishment of an efficient local administration was not the only service which Augustus rendered to the city of Eome. The magnificent buildings erected, and the improvements made by himself and his friends, altered the whole aspect of the city.

The security of the ' sacred land ' 4 was rendered still more complete by the conquest and annexation of the districts lying on the further side of the Alps, E\u00e6tia and Noricum,5 and by the final subjugation of Pannonia.6 To the peninsula itself Augustus gave not only the quiet for which it craved after twenty years of turmoil, but means and opportunities for developing its natural resources.

But Augustus, when founding colonies and allotting lands after the crowning victory at Actium, avoided the errors of which he himself, as triumvir, had been guilty.

Under his auspices the work begun by the great ' Local Government Act ' of C\u00e6sar, the ' Lex Julia municipalis,' was completed.4 The account of Italy given by Pliny is confessedly based on Augustus's description of all Italy,5 and it proves that, with a few exceptions, the municipal system prevailed through out the peninsula, even in the more backward districts i Hirschfeld (Untersuch., p. 109), following Suetonius (Aug., 37) in cludes the ' cura viarum ' among the new offices instituted by Augustus.

What modifications Augustus may have introduced into the municipal constitutions is uncertain, but one municipal institution which dates from his time is so characteristic of his policy as to require a brief notice. There is much that is obscure The connected with the origin and position of the Augus- A\"sustales tales,1 but that they were instituted by Augustus can not be doubted ; nor that the object of the institution was to find an outlet for the social ambitions of the freedmen, and to connect them with himself and his rule. True to his policy of defining clearly the line between the free-born citizen and the emancipated slave or alien, he declared freedmen to be ineligible for municipal office, or for a seat in the municipal council.2 As a compensation, he created for their benefit a magis tracy and a council, in which nothing was real but the cost and the outward show.3 The ' sexviri Augustales ' were freedmen,4 appointed each year by the local senate of their town.5 Their office was, in a sense, purely honorary, for its holders had no magisterial duties or authority, but the honour had to be paid for by a con tribution to the municipal chest, and by the exhibition of games. Out of these annual ' sexviri Augustales ' grew an ' ordo ' Augustalium,6 a freedman-aristocracy, which ranked immediately below the genuine municipal 1 Mommsen, Staatsr., iii. 453 sqq. 2 Ibid., p. 453, note 1. 3 Ib'id., p. 454. 4 For the exceptions, mostly in North Italy, see Mommsen, I.e. 454, note 2. 5 C.

The concentration in his hands of the control both of the foreign policy and of the military forces of the state, rendered possible what, under the republic, had scarcely been attempted, the establishment of definite frontiers, of a system of frontier defence, and of a frontier policy. Under each of these heads Augustus left very much to be done by his successors, and the frontier defences in particular were due in the main to the emperors of the second and third centuries. Yet in many important points Augustus laid down the lines on which they worked. The frontier problem varied in kind and difficulty in the different quarters of the empire. On the west the Atlantic Ocean supplied a natural boundary, nor by Augustus was any attempt 1 Wilm , 1750: ' dedit ordini [decurijonum sing. HS.

In the south, the coastland from the mouth of the Nile to the Pillars of Hercules was either under Eoman rule, or at least acknowledged Eoman suzerainty, and behind the coastland, the inter minable expanse of the African deserts removed all temptation to a further advance.1 The only danger here arose from the incursions of the uomad tribes, G\u00e6tulians and others, and more than once during the reign of Augustus we find the Eoman forces engaged in frontier wars with these troublesome neighbours.2 But the elaborate system of frontier defence, with its permanent camps, frontier stations, and connecting roads, of which such splendid remains are still extant, belongs to a later period. In the east Eome was confronted, not by a disorderly The eastern mass of barbarous tribes, but by a single powerful state, whose ruler styled himself ' King of Kings,' and claimed to be the lord of Asia, a state which had once at least all but wrested from Eome her eastern provinces. The annexation of Syria in 62 B.C. had brought Parthia and 692 a.u.c Eome face to face. The disaster at Carrh\u00e6 (53 B.C.) 701 a.u.c had created a genuine fear of this new power, which the Parthian invasion of Asia Minor in 40 B.C. and the 714 a.u.c failure of Antony's expedition in 36 B.C. had deepened 71s a.u.c and confirmed.

But Augustus, as the guardian of the Eoman peace, must have realised the importance of arriving at some definite settlement of the future relations between the two powers which divided the allegiance of the East between them. The invasion of Parthia was an enter prise for which he had little taste, and which, even if successful, must have been both costly and hazardous. Nor was the frontier line very clearly defined. It is true that the province of Syria possessed natural boun daries to the eastward in the desert and the Euphrates, but north of this it was otherwise. Between the most easterly of the Eoman provinces in Asia Minor, Bithynia, Galatia and Cilicia, and the Euphrates lay the three native states of Pontus, Cappadocia, and Commagene, whose fidelity to Eome was tolerably secure, but whose value as a bulwark against invasion was more doubtful. Their annexation was unquestionably a necessary step if the Euphrates line was to be effectively defended ; but it was one which Augustus left for his successors to take. Beyond the Upper Euphrates lay Armenia, a dis trict which seemed marked out by nature as a debatable land. Its annexation could not be urged as a matter of 1 Comp.

It was the restoration of Eoman influence in Armenia and nothing more that prompted the expedition of Tiberius in 20 B.C.2 and of Gaius 734 a.u.c C\u00e6sar in 4 B.C.,3 and in this respect Augustus's policy 750 a.u.c was followed by all the emperors of the first century. Like Afghanistan between England and Eussia, Armenia remained planted between the two great empires of the world, inclining now to Eome and now to Parthia.4 On the eastern frontier, as on the southern, the organi sation of an efficient system of frontier defence was not among the achievements of Augustus. But here, as on the north, he seems to have recognised the necessity of placing over the heads of the provincial governors a trusted officer, invested with the command of the East. This important command, intrusted to Agrippa for ten __ years (23-13 B.C.),5 was analogous to those established a.v.c. 1 Mon.

On the north the considerations in favour of a for ward policy were stronger.1 The conquest of Gaul, and the increasing weakness of the Celtic and Illyrian tribes which still lay between the civilised Mediterranean lands and the great rivers, had imposed upon Eome the duty of protecting the former against the northern bar barians. In this direction the traditional policy2 to which Augustus had adhered in the East was impos sible, for with the single exception of the kingdom of Noricum,3 there were no states capable of filling the place of ' buffer ' between Eome and her foes.

In the case of the Danube l the question seems to have been at once answered in the affirmative, but with the Ehine it was otherwise. The Elbe offered an alternative fron tier-line, which, if adopted, would have* removed the danger of a German invasion further from Italy and southern Gaul, and which Julius himself is said to have preferred.2 Nor can we doubt that the object of the campaigns carried on beyond the Ehine by Augustus's two stepsons, Drusus and Tiberius (13 B.C.-6 a.d.), had 741-700 for their object the extension of Eoman rule up to that river. For a time, too, this forward policy seemed to be justified by success. Drusus reached the Elbe in 9 B.C.,3 and after his death in that year Tiberius car- 745 a.u.c. ried on his work. By 9 a.d. considerable progress had 763 a.u.c been made 4 towards the creation of a Eoman province of Germany beyond the Ehine. Eoman troops were regularly stationed there.

He withdrew behind the Ehine, and in his last testament solemnly warned his successors against attempting to advance beyond it.2 Of the final adoption of the Ehine frontier, and of the system of defence organised both on the Ehine and the Danube by his successors, we shall speak in a later chapter. In the north, however, as in the east, Augustus followed the policy of centralising the administration. Throughout nearly the whole of his reign the command of the Ehine land was united with the governor-generalship of the ' three Gauls,' 3 and for a time at least the Danubian provinces were simi larly united under one authority.4 The military reforms of Augustus are inseparable from his frontier policy. At the close of the repub lican period the Eoman army was at once a source of political danger to the home government and an in tolerable burden upon the provincials. In theory it was still a militia called out year by year for the defence of the state ; in fact, it had become a standing army, (Ann., i. 56), a 'castellum' on the Lippe(i'&., ii. 7); ' pontes longi ' (ib., i. 63) ; 'fossa Drusiana' (ib., ii. 3). 1 Dio, lvi. 56, 18 sqq.

The old regu- lations, under which every Eoman citizen took his turn of service in the legion, and when the campaign was over returned home to resume his ordinary business, had become obsolete. Large numbers never served at all, nor for those who did was any definite period of service fixed. When discharged the veteran had no legal claim to pension or reward ; his sole hope lay in the ability of his leader to procure from senate and people by political agitation a grant of money or land, in return for which he was expected to support by his vote, or even by his sword, his leader's political schemes. Nor was this army subject to any single control ; it was, in fact, not so much an army as a group of armies, raised, led, and maintained by independent and often hostile generals; faithful to these rather than to the state, but faithful even to them only while booty -was plenti- ful. In the intervals of active service the soldiers lived at free quarters in the provinces at the expense of the provincials. During the stormy period of the civil wars the total number of troops arrayed under the banners of rival leaders increased rapidly, and at the close of that period there were no less than fifty legions on foot.1 Augustus's first act was to reduce this un wieldy force by one-half, the discharged soldiers being either granted lands or sent home with a gratuity in money.2 The remainder, consisting of about twenty- 1 Mommsen, ad Mon.

Only by his orders could fresh levies be raised.2 Each recruit took an oath of allegiance to C\u00e6sar, according to a form drawn up by Augustus himself ; 3 from Augustus he received his pay while serv ing with the eagles, his formal discharge when his time was up, and his reward in land or money. The condi tions of service, moreover, were fixed. The old liability to military service resting on all Eoman citizens was not abolished, nor could any one but a Eoman citizen serve in the legions. But it was only rarely that a forced levy was necessary.4 The establishment of peace diminished both the demand for fresh troops and the losses by war ; the spread of the Eoman franchise en larged the area from which recruits could be drawn, and the fresh drafts required to keep the legions effec tive were, as a rule, obtained by voluntary enlistment.

Auxiliary troops drawn from the provinces, or from vassal states, or even from warlike frontier tribes, had been largely used in the latter days of the republic, and still more during the civil wars. But from Augustus dates their institution as a regular supplement to the legions.1 They were drawn from the more warlike provinces, and the martial spirit of Gauls, Spaniards, and Galatians was thus afforded an outlet, which com pensated them for the dull days of peace that had come with Eoman rule, and at the same time bound them by the tie of military loyalty to Eome and to C\u00e6sar. These auxiliary cohorts and squadrons bore the name of the tribe or district from which, at least in the early days of the empire, they were recruited, and retained in some cases their native equipments and mode of fighting.2 But while their national or tribal pride was thus gratified, long service with the legions, usually under Eoman officers, far away from their native land, helped to make them soldiers of Eome, while, when his twenty five years of service were over, the auxiliary received, on his discharge, the full citizenship of Eome for him self and his descendants.3 The distribution of this force clearly indicated the chief purpose which it served.

There were, besides, three in Spain and two in Dalmatia. Augustus had used the powers intrusted to him well. The question Hehad reformed the administration both in the provinces succession. and at home ; he had at least marked out the frontiers of the empire, and organised an imperial army for their defence. Within these bounds the ' Eoman peace ' was securely established, and the echoes of distant border wars scarcely reached the ears of the quiet populations of the central provinces. But his powers, though con- tinued to him during his life, by successive renewals,2 would expire with his death, and it was urgently neces- sary to provide beforehand that there should be some one able and ready to fill his place. He could not transmit his authority by any act of his own, nor on his death would the senate and people be legally obliged to grant such powers to any one at all. What he could do, was to make clear to every one who it was that he wished should succeed him, and to give him opportunities of gaining the necessary experience and prestige.

On the death of Agrippa (12 B.C.) both were promoted to high commands in Illyricum and in Germany.4 But Drusus died in 9 B.C., and though three years later Tiberius was invested with the tribunician power (6 B.C.), and intrusted with a mission to Armenia,5 Augustus's special favour was be stowed on the two young sons born to Agrippa by his own daughter Julia, whom he had adopted in 17 B.C.6 In spite of the fact that Julia had, after Agrippa's death, been married to Tiberius, the latter found him self thrown into the shade by the two young C\u00e6sars.7 1 From 28-12 B.C. ; Dio, liv. 12 : &\\\\a re ef tirov ir-n eavrif ical rr\\v i\u00a3ovcrlav ttjc SijpLapxiKr/v (18 B.C.).

Of his unpopu larity there seems no doubt, and it is not difficult to explain. Its causes are to be found partly in his per sonal temperament, partly in the circumstances of his position. Unfortunately for himself, he inherited to the full the hereditary pride which had made the great Claudian house proverbially unpopular with nobles and commons alike.1 Towards those who stood nearest to him, towards his mother Livia, his brother Drusus, and his first wife Agrippina,2 he was capable of intense and enduring affection ; but towards the rest of the world he showed himself cold, reserved, and taciturn, with some thing more than a tinge of cynical melancholy.3 These traits in his character had been developed and confirmed by the dangers, sorrows, and disappointments which clouded the first forty-six years of his life. The hard ships of his childhood,4 the forced separation from Agrippina,5 his ill-starred marriage with Julia, the death of his brother Drusus, and the gloomy years of seclusion from 6 B.C. to 2 A.D., when he saw himself thrust aside in favour of the two young C\u00e6sars, had all left their marks upon him.6 1 Tac, Ann., i. 4: ' maturum annis, spectatum bello, sed vetere atque insita Claudi\u00e6 famili\u00e6 superbia.' 2 Suet., Tib., vii. 8; Tac, Ann., v. 3 : ' inveteratum erga matreni obsequium.' 3 Our chief ancient authorities for Tiberius's character and policy are Tacitus, Suetonius, and Dio ; for modern literature see Schiller, Gesch. d.

For the serious business of government he had both a liking and a rare capacity ; but to govern, under the condition of respecting fictions in which no one believed, of pampering the tastes of a populace whom he despised, and of conciliating a nobility whom he disliked and suspected, was a task which was for him ' a wretched and oppressive slavery,' l and for which he was, of all men, the most unfitted. The plebs of Eome resented his contemptuous indifference to their pleasures, his parsimony in the matter of games,2 and, though far less deeply, the withdrawal from them of the right to play at electing the magistrates of the year.3 The nobles both feared and disliked the dour and stern C\u00e6sar, whose exclusiveness offended, and whose somewhat cynical courtesies frightened them. Nor out side Eome, in Italy and the provinces, though respected as a just and vigorous ruler, did he win, or even care to win, popularity. Augustus was personally known in every province ; Tiberius's longest journey was to Capri.4 His severe economy was an unwelcome contrast to the splendid liberality of Augustus. He exhibited no games ; he gave but few largesses, and he was no munificent builder of temples, aqueducts, and bridges.5 1 Suet., Tib., 24 : ' miseram et onerosam servitutem.' 2 Ibid., 34; Tac, Ann., i. 54 : ' civile rebatur (Aug. ) misceri volup tatibus volgi, alia Tiberio morum via.' 3 Tac, Ann., i. 15. 4 Suet., 38, 39. 5 H,id. , 46 : ' pecuni\u00e6 parcus ac tenax ' ; 47 : ' neque opera ulla mag nifica fecit ; neque spectacula omnino edidit ' ; ibid., 48. 2E"], [458, "HISTORY OF ROME [BookY. 434 The situation, too, was difficult : Tiberius did not enjoy the unbounded personal prestige which strength ened Augustus's hands in 27 B.C.

The latter event specially deepened, if it did not first arouse, 'that suspicious mistrust of the old nobility, the irreconcilable foes of Julius, the secret rivals occasionally even of Augustus, which ultimately drove him into a violent onslaught upon them.4 Yet even Tacitus can praise his conduct of the government during the first nine years of his reign.5 From that period onwards everything conspired to intensify the defects in his character.

For the remaining six years of his life, the lonely old man, soured and disappointed, lived unat tended, except by dependants, in the island of Capri. Such was one side of the picture, and it is the one which the genius of Tacitus has fixed in the memory of posterity. He drew his materials, for the most part, from writers bitterly hostile to Tiberius, who exagger ated his faults, misinterpreted his jnotives, and recklessly adopted any story, however baseless, which agreed with their view of his character.1 They belonged, as a rule, to the senatorial order, or to the literary and philosophic circles with whom republicanism was the fashion, or, like the younger Agrippina, had personal and family wrongs to avenge,2 and they painted Tiberius as nothing but a treacherous and cruel tyrant. The ver sion of his conduct which they had set in circulation Tacitus accepted, not, it is true, without doubts and re servations, but with far too ready a faith, and devoted himself rather to heightening its effect by all the devices of rhetoric, than to weighing the evidence on which it rested. It must be remembered, also, that it was in Eome, and in his relations with Eoman society, that Tiberius was seen at his worst. Yet beyond these narrow limits neither Tacitus nor his authorities cared studiis'; cf. ibid., iv. 17, 40.

They judged of the emperor and of the imperial government from this point of view. Of the manner in which the empire was ruled, of the condition of the provinces, they tell us little, and probably did not care to know much. But a critical study even of their narrative, and still more of the com paratively impartial evidence supplied by provincial writers, and by inscriptions, enables us to form a more correct judgment. Tiberius was not a lovable man ; he was morose and suspicious ; and suspicion, as it increased its hold upon him, made him in his later years a terror to all who could be suspected of treason. He was hated in Eome, and not without cause. Yet there is no doubt that he was a capable and vigorous ruler, and that the empire fared well under his care. He enforced justice in the government of the provinces ; he maintained the integrity of the frontiers and the discipline of the legions ; he husbanded the finances, and left a full trea sury behind him. In the details of administration, and on questions of social and economic reform, he displayed judgment and common sense. Utterly unlike as he was to Augustus, yet, as the ruler of a great empire, he justi fied the latter's choice of a successor, and his deliberate opinion that the virtues of his adopted son outweighed his vices.1 A very different verdict must be passed on the three remaining emperors of the Julian line.

He was young ; 3 he was the son of Germanicus, the grandson of Drusus, and, through his mother Agrippina, the great-grandson of Augustus himself, a relationship on which he laid especial stress.4 The legions in particular welcomed the son of their favourite general, who had himself been brought up in their midst.5 At first, too, Gaius's own conduct served to justify the general hope of a return to the liberal and genial government of Augustus. The senate was gratified by his declared intention of respect ing its prerogatives and those of the magistrates,6 though it probably laughed in secret at his idea of re storing to the people the elective duties which Tiberius had taken from them.7 Equally popular were his remis sions of taxation, his release of political prisoners, his removal of the ban placed on the writings of Cremutius Cordus, and, above all, the revival of the public largesses and games. But Gaius had sat but a few months in the seat of Augustus before the difference between the ' young Augustus,' as he was called, and his great name sake became clear to every one.

If he posed at first as a liberal and popular ruler, it was from a desire to insult the memory of Tiberius and glorify himself rather than from any serious considerations of policy. But this mood soon passed, and his conduct during the rest of his brief reign was that of a madman intoxicated with a delirious sense of omnipotence, and with no other aim in the use of his power than the gratification of the fancy of the moment. He wasted the savings accumulated by Tiberius in countless ex cesses, and when they were gone he plundered the rich,2 and alike in Italy and in Gaul men were hurried to execution whose only crime was their wealth. While claiming divine honours for himself, he heaped insults on the senate and magistrates, and preferred the society of grooms and jockeys. Abroad, the contrast with the firm rule of Tiberius was shown by his mock invasions of Germany and Britain,3 by his reckless liberality to -worthless native princes at the expense of the dignity and safety of the empire, and by the insult wantonly offered to the religious feelings of the Jews.

His grandmother Livia heartily despised him, and Augustus despaired of ever making him a present- able figure in the eyes of the Eoman public.5 Through- out the reign of his uncle Tiberius he lived in seclusion.

No doubt the mixture of good sense and folly which Suetonius notices1 is as apparent in him as in James I. His blind belief in unworthy favourites frequently misled him ; his pedantic anti quarianism, and fussiness, were constantly exciting ridicule, and occasionally marred the effect of his most statesmanlike acts ; it must be allowed, too, that his nervous timidity was apt to make him suspicious and cruel. Yet when all is said and done, the fact remains that the rule of Claudius left a deep and abiding mark on the history of the empire. To his reign belongs the annexation of Mauretania, of South Britain, of Thrace, and Jud\u00e6a.2 It was he who anticipated the Flavian and Antonine emperors, in the policy of freely extend ing the franchise.3 The Eomanisation of the frontier lands along the Ehine and Danube received its first powerful impulse from him.4 In Eome and Italy his name was commemorated by solid and useful works, which contrasted equally with the parsimony of Tiberius and the senseless extravagance of Gaius, the two great aqueducts, Aqua Claudie and Anio Norus, the harbour at Ostia, the draining of the Fucine lake, and the continua- tion to the Adriatic coast of the Via Valeria.5 It was under Claudius, too, that a most important advance was i Suet., Claud., 15. _ 2 See below. 3 As in the case of the \u00c6dui ; Tac, Ann., xi. 23. 4 Especially in Noricum ; Plin., N.

The power and influence wielded by his three famous freedmen, Narcissus, his secretary, Pallas, the comptroller of accounts, and Polybius, his director of studies,5 were an offence and a scandal in the eyes of Eoman society ; but the way was thus prepared for the establishment of a central imperial ministry in Eome, in which before long even Eoman knights were eager to fill a place. If we add to these achievements, his reforms in the civil law, his assiduity in the administration of justice,6 and the numerous proofs which exist of the attention he paid to the details of administration,7 we must acknowledge that many greater and better men have been worse rulers, and that in spite of Seneca's sarcasms, it was not without reason that Claudius alone, of the C\u00e6sars between Augustus i Hirschfeld, Untersuch., 286 sqq. 3 Frontinus, de Aqu\u0153d., 116, 118. 2 Suet., Claud., 24. 4 Suet., Claud., 12. 5 Pbid. , 28 : for the offices of the freedmen ' ab epistulis ' and ' a rationibus,' see Hirschfeld, Untersuch., 31 sqq. ; Liebenam, Lauf bahn d.

He was thus descended, through his mother, from Augustus himself, and through his father from Augustus's sister Octavia,2 a pedigree which, added to the respect felt for the memory of his grandfather Ger manicus, stood him in good stead with the Eoman public. His accession, on the death of Claudius in 54 a.d., was, indeed, mainly due to the indomitable and unscrupulous perseverance of his mother, who, after the fall of Messalina, had gradually acquired so complete an ascendency over Claudius, that, in spite of their rela tionship, he married her.3 Before Claudius died Nero was already looked upon as his successor, to the exclu sion of Claudius's own son Britannicus ; and on the an nouncement of his death he was at once, and without opposition, saluted as emperor.4 Nero ruled for fifteen years, and his reign, with its brilliant opening and tragic close, its fantastic revels and frightful disasters, left a deep impression on the imagination of men.

In pagan literature he became a type of the ' v si pis,' which justly provokes the anger of the gods ; to the Christians he was a persecutor, drunk with the blood of the saints, the very incarnation of the power of evil. Yet, in spite of all, the name of the last of the race of Augustus was always invested with something of romantic interest, not unmingled with regret. His memory was long cherished by the Eoman populace as that of an open-handed patron, and in Greece the recollections of his magnificence, his liberality, and his enthusiasm for art were still fresh when Pausanias visited the country.1 Into the details of Nero's rule it is not necessary to enter. The first five years, before ' the wild beast had tasted blood,' and while his course was guided by the philosopher Seneca and his trusted ally Afranius Burrus, prefect of the pr\u00e6torian guard, were prosperous and uneventful. But from 59 onwards there was a rapid change for the worse. The murder of his mother Agrippina (59 A.D.) was fol low-ed by the death of Burrus (62 A.D.) and the retire ment of Seneca, and their place was taken by Tigellinus and Popp\u00e6a, to make room for whom Nero's innocent wife Octavia was sacrificed. The forebodings of evil, excited by the earthquake at Pompeii, and the reverses which befell the Eoman legions in Armenia, were con firmed by the great fire which broke out in September 64 B.C., and which was universally regarded as a proof of the displeasure of the gods. Nor was the belief that the reckless C\u00e6sar was doomed, or the discontent with 1 Suet., Nero, 57."], [469, "Ch. 4.] NERO 445 his rule weakened by the spectacle of the famous ' golden house,' which he built for himself, and to defray the cost of which both Italy and the provinces were ruth lessly pillaged. In 65 the failure of Piso's conspiracy directed the fierce fury of the emperor against the nobles, while a pestilence decimated the populace of Eome. But the end was not far off. The anxiety to be rid of an emperor who disgraced the name of Augustus had spread from Eome to the provinces. In the midst of a triumphal progress through Greece which scandalised Eome and the West almost as much as his vices and crimes, Nero was startled by rumours of disaffection in the western provinces. He reached Italy (March 68 A.D.) only to learn first that Gaul, Spain, Africa, and the legions on the Ehine were in revolt against him, and then that Galba was marching upon Eome. Deserted by every one, by senate, people, and even the pr\u00e6torian guards, he sought shelter in the villa of his freedman Phaon, outside the city. There he heard of the pro clamation of Galba as emperor, and of the sentence of death passed upon himself, and there, on June 9, 68 A.D., he anticipated the vengeance of his enemies by suicide.

Outwardly, the concordat established by Augustus, between the old republican constitution and the autho rity of C\u00e6sar, had been maintained under his suc cessors ; and Nero himself had openly accepted its fundamental principle, that C\u00e6sar was only a citizen charged with particular departments of administration, and bound as such to recognise the independent authority of his colleagues, the regular magistrates.1 But the unreality of this partition of power was not to be concealed by such professions of respect for the ' maxims of Augustus ' ; 2 and the tendency to make the temporary, exceptional, and limited authority given to Augustus permanent, regular, and absolute, was irresist ible. Augustus's powers had been granted to him for a certain number of years, and the grant was periodically renewed. But his successors received their powers for life. Strictly speaking, there was no necessity that any successor to Augustus should be selected, or that when selected he should receive the same prerogatives. Except, however, for a brief interval after the death of Gaius, and again after the fall of Nero, the first question was not even raised, and from the accession of Gaius onwards, a customary list of powers and privileges was 1 Tac, Ann., xiii. 4: ' teneret antiqua munia senatus, consulum tribunalibus Italia et public\u00e6 provinci\u00e6 adsisterent ... se mandatis exercitibus consulturum.' 2 Suet. , Nero, 10 : ' ex Augusti pr\u00e6scripto se imperaturum pro fessus.'"], [471, "The extension of C\u00e6sar's power.

It may be said, indeed, that the principate was never so near becoming a legiti mate monarchy, as on the eve of the catastrophe which overthrew Nero. If it ceased to be possible to treat the principate as a temporary and exceptional addition to the constitution, which might be dispensed with or retained at the dis cretion of senate and people, it was even more difficult to keep up the fiction that a clear line could be drawn between the authority of the princeps and that of the regular magistrates. The department originally assigned to Augustus had, during his long rule, been so widened and extended as to reduce all others to insignificance, and under his successors during this period it continued to grow, though at a less rapid rate. Abroad the number of C\u00e6sar's provinces had, by 68 A.D., risen to twenty-five. On the south he was master of Egypt, Numidia, and Mauretania ; in the west, two-thirds of Spain, three-fourths of Gaul, and South Britain were subject to him; along the northern frontier his authority stretched in an unbroken line from the German Ocean to the Euxine; while in the east it covered the eastern half of the peninsula of Asia Minor, 1 Dio, lix. 3; Journ.

In Eome itself he was responsible for the corn-supply, for the water-supply, and for the police. It is easy to realise that an authority recognised as supreme over so vast an area must have been virtually supreme everywhere. Under the shadow of C\u00e6sar no independent authority could flourish. The assemblies of the Eoman people, or plebs, lost even the little reality they retained under Augustus. After the change made by Tiberius,1 they ceased even in form to elect the annual magistrates from the pr\u00e6tol-ship downwards, and in the case of the con sulship, they merely accepted the candidates nominated by C\u00e6sar. Assemblies, it is true, were still held to con fer his authority upon each new emperor, but otherwise they ceased, with one or two exceptions, to exercise their ancient prerogative of legislation.3 It was still the fashion to speak of the consulship as the ' supreme power,' 4 but Tiberius could truly say that ' something greater and higher was expected of the princeps.5 The consuls still gave their name to the year : from the juris diction of the consuls sitting with the senate there was l Tac, Ann., i. 15 : ' turn primum e campo comitia ad patres trans lata sunt ' ; Mommsen, Staatsr., ii. 860, iii. 347.

Yet when Caligula made his horse a consul, he only expressed, in a coarse and exaggerated form, the actually dependent position of the ancient chief magistracy of state. The consuls were avowedly C\u00e6sar's nominees ; 2 they held office at the most for six months,3 and their exclusive dignity was impaired by the growing frequency with which the emperors be stowed the consular rank and insignia upon favourites of their own. As presidents of the senate, they ventured but rarely to introduce business without C\u00e6sar's previous knowledge and approval, and even the criminal juris diction which they enjoyed, jointly with the senate, became more and more dependent on C\u00e6sar's sufferance. The relations which existed between the emperors of The Senate. this period and the senate afford equally clear proof of the unreality of the compromise effected by Augustus. Tiberius, during the greater part of his reign, showed an unmistakable desire to make the senate of real use in the work of government. Not only did he habitually bring before the senate matters of importance within his own department, consulting it even on questions so entirely within his own prerogative, such as the griev ances of the soldiers, or negotiations with foreign powers ; but he encouraged it to deal independently with those matters which nominally belonged to its own pro vince, with the administration of the ' public provinces ' or with the condition of Italy.4 But the task was a i Dig., xlix. 2. 2 Seneca de Ira, iii. 31 ; Plin., Paneg., 77 : 'ipsum (sc.

The senate ac cepted C\u00e6sar's proposals submissively, and when left to act by itself, it either did nothing, or as Tiberius com plained, ' cast all its cares upon him.' 1 During the gloomy years which followed his retirement to Capri, it merely awaited in trembling anxiety the despatches which announced the emperor's pleasure. Under Tiberius's successors things were much the same. Before the wild outbursts of Gaius or Nero it cowered in terror.2 In quieter times its nervous readiness to do what C\u00e6sar proposed was only equalled by its reluctance to do any thing else. But powerless as the magistrates and senate were by comparison with C\u00e6sar, it was not yet possible for the latter frankly to treat them as subordinates, or to ignore them. And the reason lay not so much in the pres tige which still attached to these ancient institutions, as in their close connection with the old nobility, with whom, and not with the senate as such, the early C\u00e6sars lived at feud.3 The old noblesse were the natural enemies of the new regime, which had raised the Julii and Claudii so far above the rest of their order ; they resented their diminished importance, and while afraid openly to oppose C\u00e6sar, they no less disliked obeying him. Nor could the more powerful and ambitious among them forget that legally the position of princeps 1 Tac, Ann., iii. 35. 3 Suet., Gaius, 26 ; Dio, lix. 24. 3 G.

While the nobles intrigued and conspired, C\u00e6sar replied by a stringent law of treason, and by the hateful system of informers. It was a feud which harassed and ham pered in turn Tiberius, Gaius, Claudius, and Nero, and which has left an ineffaceable mark on the records of their reigns. The task of the emperors, from Vespasian onwards, was as much facilitated by the virtual extinc tion of this noblesse, as that of our Tudor sovereigns by the decimation of the English nobility in the Wars of the Eoses. The senatorial nobility of their day was easily satisfied by a show of courtesy, while readily accepting a purely subordinate place. The undeniable fact that even during this period Monarchical C\u00e6sar was master gradually but inevitably told upon his position and upon his government. The former ap proached more and more nearly to that of a sovereign, the latter needed, and to some extent secured, a regular and recognised organisation. Augustus had endeavoured to enforce by example and precept the view that he was only a citizen among citizens,2 and Tiberius set his face against the extravagant homage offered to him.3 But the tendency to place C\u00e6sar, and even C\u00e6sar's house, on a higher level than that of private citizens, and to surround him with many of the outward accessories of i Tac, Ann., i. 13. a Suet., Aug., 53, 56. 3 Ibid., Tib., 26, 27."], [476, "The ' house of C\u00e6sar. 452 HISTORY OF ROME [Book v. royalty, was too strong to be resisted.

Yet, apart from the fact that to the provincials and to the half-servile plebs of Eome and Italy the omnipotent C\u00e6sar was already more than human, C\u00e6sar-worship in its official and recognised forms was gradually elevating C\u00e6sar to a position very near that of the gods of the state. The deification of Julius and Augustus cast something of a special glory over their descendants, while the public and widespread worship of the ' genius ' or ' numen ' of Augustus consecrated the rule, if not the person, of C\u00e6sar throughout the empire. The emperors from Tiberius to Nero were at least the sons and grandsons of gods, and ruled by something like a divine right. These emperors, moreover, were all, in one way or another, of the race of Augustus, and the house of the C\u00e6sars thus acquired the prestige of a royal house. In direct violation of republican usage, and even of the theory of the principate, the incipient royalty of C\u00e6sar was shared by the members of his family.

The transformation of C\u00e6sar's personal servants into officials of state was, even more than the transformation of his personal friends into courtiers, a political neces sity.1 The more important of the offices in C\u00e6sar's service, such as the prefecture of the corn-supply, the prefecture of Egypt, the provincial procuratorships, in evitably ranked from the first as virtually public posts, and were filled almost invariably by Eoman knights. But, before the time of Vitellius, the domestic offices in his household and about his person were filled, as in private households, by freedmen and slaves.2 The influ ence wielded by the imperial freedmen, especially under Claudius and Nero, was naturally a sore point with the Eoman aristocracy.3 It was bad enough that a lowr born prefect of the pr\u00e6torian guard should be a greater man than the consuls and pr\u00e6tors,4 but the wealth and power of a Pallas or a Polybius were a worse scandal 1 For what follows, see Friedlander, Sittengesch., i. 63 ; Hirschfeld, Untersuchungen, passim. 2 Tac, Hist, i. 58 : ' ministeria principatus a libertis agi solita.' 3 Tacitus, Ann., iv. 7, says of Tiberius, 'modesta servitia, pauci liberti.'

The truth, however, is that neither the weakness of Claudius, nor Nero's dislike of affairs, nor even their own ability, had so much to do with the prominence of these freedmen as the vast importance of the outwardly humble posts they held. A great part of the business, which a modern sovereign transacts through his mini sters, was performed for the early C\u00e6sars by their freedmen. Through the hands of the freedman ' ab epistulis ' l passed the official correspondence from Eome, Italy, and the provinces, while the freedman 'a rationibus ' had the management of the vast revenues which accrued to C\u00e6sar from all parts of the empire.2 It was inevitable that posts of such importance should in time cease to be merely domestic household offices, and that the finance of two-thirds of the empire could not long be treated as if it were a matter only of C\u00e6sar's private property. Vitellius first took the important step of filling these posts with Eoman knights, but before his time Claudius had done something to place the financial department at least on a better footing. There is good reason for ascribing to him the formation in Eome, and under the care of the freedman, 'a rationibus,' of a central imperial treasury (fiscus), to which C\u00e6sar's revenue officers (procurators) throughout the empire had to render accounts.3 It was Claudius also who first gave something of a magisterial character i Hirschfeld, Untersuch., 30 and 192 sqq. ; Liebenam, Laufbahn der Procuratoren (Jena, 1888). 2 With these may be ranked the freedman ' a libellis, through whose hands passed all petitions addressed to C\u00e6sar. 3 Momiiipsen, Staatsr., ii. 933; Hirschfeld, I.e. 30; Liebenam, I.e. 141."], [480, "Condition of the empire.

The frontiers of the empire remained, for the most part, as Augustus had left them. The expeditions of Germanicus3 beyond the Ehine involved a temporary departure from the policy adopted after the defeat of Varus (9 A.D.), but the departure was due rather to the exigencies of the moment, than to any change of view on the part of Tiberius. Over and above the desir ability of gratifying the martial ardour of Germanicus, and of finding occupation for the mutinous legions, the recovery of the standards lost by Varus, and the inflic tion of a severe blow upon the growing power of Arminius, were of importance alike for the prestige of the new emperor, and for the safety of the frontier. These objects Germanicus accomplished, and was then recalled by Tiberius. Thenceforward the Ehine was definitely accepted as the military frontier. Eome did not, indeed, abandon all claim to suzerainty beyond the river. The Frisii, in particular, were treated as a sub ject tribe, liable to taxation and conscription, and their occasional attempts to shake off the Eoman yoke 4 were 1 Tac, Ann., xii. 60. 2 Suet., Claud., 24. 3 Tac, Ann., Bks. i. and ii. ; Mommsen, R.

Nor was it until the reign of Claudius that the scattered military stations beyond the Ehine were abandoned.1 But from 17 a.d. down to the time of Domitian, the frontier line of defence ran along the left bank of the great river ; nor was any important change made in the arrangements adopted for its defence. The army of the Ehine was divided into two corps, the armies of Lower and of Upper Ger many,2 as they were somewhat boastfully styled, each consisting of four legions, and of an uncertain number of auxiliary cavalry, and infantry. The headquarters of the former were at Vetera,3 those of the latter at Mogontiacum (Mainz). Each army was commanded by a legate, and with the command of the troops the legates united the administrative control of the frontier districts, the so-called provinces of Lower and Upper Germany, although for revenue purposes these districts were included in the province of Gallia Belgica. The defence of the frontier was further strengthened by a military road which ran along the left bank of the Ehine, and connected the military stations with each other ; a flotilla of galleys was maintained on the river itself, and along the right bank a strip of territory was cleared of its inhabitants, and probably of the forests which might have sheltered a hostile tribe.

At the accession of Tiberius it already marked the extreme northward limit of Eoman suze rainty, and among the tribes beyond it none were, like the Frisii, vassals of Eome. But it was not yet the military frontier, and even in 69 A.D. no system of fron tier defence, such as existed on the Ehine, had been organised, mainly, no doubt, because the Eoman govern ment, during this period, was more concerned with the pacification of the tribes on their own side of the river, than with the prevention of incursions from beyond it.1 It is true that by the annexation of Thrace Clau dius completed the chain of frontier provinces from the German Ocean to the Euxine, and it is possible that the two legions which formed the garrison of M\u0153sia had their camps on the Danube. But along the upper part of the river there is no evidence of a regular mili tary occupation before the time of Vespasian.2 In Noricum there were no legions, and the legions in Pannonia were stationed, not on the Danube, but along the lines of the Drave and the Save. The defence of the Danube was the work of the emperors of the second century. On the eastern side of the empire, the political situa tion was certainly improved by the annexation of the three native states of Pontus, Cappadocia, and Comma gene,3 and the consequent extension of Eoman territory, 1 According to Tacitus, Ann., iv. 5, besides the two legions in M\u0153sia, there were two in Pannonia and two in Dalmatia. 2 The legions were at the time of the mutiny in Pannonia (14 a.d.) stationed on the line of the Save and the Drave, Pactovio (Pettau) being probably an important military station ; Mommsen, R.

Not only, however, were no adequate measures taken for the defence of this new territory, but, partly no doubt in consequence of this omission, the difficulty of maintaining the necessary Eoman ascendency in the debateable land of Armenia increased rather than diminished, and at the commencement of Nero's reign it reached an acute stage. The occupation of Armenia by the Parthian king Volog\u00e6ses, provoked a war,1 in which, as had so often happened before, Armenia was recovered only to be lost again, and the compromise effected in 66 A.D., though accepted as satisfactory by both Eome and Parthia, left matters very much as they stood before. The crown of Armenia was given, not to a prince sent out from Eome, but to Tiridates, a brother of the Parthian king, who, however, came to Eome, and there, in the Forum, was formally invested with his authority by the Eoman emperor, Nero. On the southern frontier two changes of importance were made during this period. In 37 A.D. the command of the troops and of the frontier districts was taken from the proconsul of -Africa and intrusted to an imperial legate.2 Under Claudius the native kingdom of Mauretania was gene was annexed in 17 A.D.

To the same emperor, Claudius, whose annexation of Thrace and of Mauretania completed the Eoman occu pation of the frontier territories lying along the Danube in the north and -the African deserts in the south, belongs also the credit of the one important advance made during this period beyond the bounds of the empire as fixed by Augustus. For nearly a hundred years after the expedition of C\u00e6sar no further attempt was made to conquer Britain, and we can only guess at the reasons which led Claudius in 43 A.D. to send a well equipped force of four legions across the Channel.2 The fact that the son of a British chief, on being worsted in a tribal quarrel, sought Eoman protection, afforded a pretext, but scarcely a sufficient reason, for the expedition. It is known, however, that the chiefs of southern Britain had ever since 55 B.C. maintained some intercourse with Eome, and the commercial inter course with the Continent was probably closer still. i In 41 a.d. ; Dio Cass., lx. 9 ; Plin., N.

That commercial considerations were not without influence in the matter may be inferred from the promptitude with which this new opening was seized upon, from the large numbers of Eoman settlers who poured into the island,1 and from the rapidity with which mining operations in particular were commenced.2 Whatever the reasons, however, which led to the ex pedition of 43 A.D., it marks the commencement of the Eoman occupation in Britain, and the importance attached to it at the time is sufficiently indicated by the presence of Claudius himself in the island. But the ' conquest of Britain,' of which Claudius boasted as one of the chief glories of his reign, was, as regards the greater part of the island, a mere phrase. It is pro bable enough that the imperial government regarded the whole island as within the Eoman ' sphere of influ ence,' but even when Aulus Plantius Silvanus, the first legate, returned home (47 a.d.), the most northerly points occupied by Eoman troops seem to have been Colchester in the east, and Gloucester (Glevum) in the west.

In the eastern half of the island Colchester (Camalodunum) became a colony before the end of the reign of Claudius, and further north, Lincoln (Lindum) was occupied by a legion. The formidable insurrection in the east headed by Boadicea, queen of the Iceni, was followed by the subjugation of the latter, and probably by the creation of a camp at Venta Icenorum. At the close of Nero's reign (68 A.D.) Chester and Lincoln still marked the extreme northerly points held by Eoman troops. But it seems likely that much of the country lying immediately behind these outposts was not as yet brought under the ordinary provincial organisation, and only the part of the island south of a line drawn from Colchester westward can be safely regarded as having assumed the 'form of a province.' Within the frontiers the administration of the pro vinces was conducted, in the main, on the lines laid down by Augustus. Instances of misgovernment are mentioned, but almost without exception, in the ' public provinces,' and the superiority of C\u00e6sar's administra tion over that of the proconsuls was shown not only by the transference to him, early in Tiberius's reign, of Achaia and Macedonia,1 but by the case of Sardinia, which in 6 A.D. was placed under the care of Augustus, and in 67 a.d. was restored to the consuls and senate in a prosperous condition.2 Of discontent in the pro vinces with Eoman rule the traces are few.

The rebellion, headed by Julius Sacrovir, in north-eastern Gaul,1 was almost entirely confined to the less civilised tribes near the Ehine frontier, who had to bear the burden of the German wars, to whom the orderly methods of Eoman government, the census, and the regular taxation were irritating novelties, and who re sented still more keenly the omnivorous activity of Eoman traders and usurers. Elsewhere, too, the estab lishment of civilised government among a barbarous or half-civilised people produced, naturally enough, friction and disturbance.2 But against these isolated instances must be set the abundant evidence which exists of a widespread prosperity. The Natural His tory of the elder Pliny bears witness to a rapid develop ment of commerce, to the advancing civilisation of the new, and to the revived prosperity of many of the old provinces, \u2014 above all, to a marked rise in the general standard of wealth. Spain and Gaul 3 were fast be coming Eoman in language and manners, and beginning to contribute honoured names to the ranks of Latin oratory and literature. From Cordova came the two Senecas, and the poet Lucan. Autun (Augustodunum), and still more Lyons (Lugdunum), were rising into fame as schools of rhetoric.

The Eomanisation of the western provinces received a powerful impulse from Claudius, who not only weakened what remained of national feeling by the suppression of Druidism,1 but initiated the policy, afterwards pur sued by the Flavii and Antonines, of freely granting the Eoman franchise,2 and of raising to the rank of Eoman towns the more advanced provincial communities.3 In the eastern half of the empire, in the ' provinces beyond the sea,' there is nothing corresponding to the rapid advance made by Gaul and Spain. Here, and especially in Asia Minor, the dominant civilisation was not Latin, but Greek, and the extension of Greek civi lisation over the central and eastern regions of the peninsula belongs to the second and third centuries rather than to the first. In Asia Minor again the re forming energy of the C\u00e6sars had less scope. Through out great part of this period there still existed im portant native states, under native rulers, and even within the limits of Eoman territory there were still free towns, within whose bounds the Eoman governor had in theory no jurisdiction, holy cities governed or misgoverned by priestly dynasts, and half-civilised tribes ruled by their own chieftains.

But it was found in tolerable when, on the extinction of the old line, the principate became in fact, as well as in theory, a prize open to all comers. For the integrity, tranquillity, and good government of the empire it was essential that the position and authority of the princeps should be placed on a more regular footing, that the rule of C\u00e6sar, which was acknowledged to be indispensable, should be declared legitimate and recognised as permanent. The necessity of in some way legalising C\u00e6sarism pressed with especial force upon Vespasian himself. He succeeded to power at a moment when public confi dence had been rudely shaken by insurrection and civil war, and his low birth provoked contemptuous compari sons, not only with the Julii andClaudii, but with Galba, Otho, and Vitellius. Galba was after all a patrician ; 1 Otho came of an old and honourable Etruscan house, and both his father and grandfather had been senators ; even Vitellius was at least the son of a senator, and the grandson of a Eoman knight.2 But Vespasian was not even of equestrian rank. His grandfather, a native of the little Sabine town of Eeate, had been a centurion, and then a collector of small debts. His father, after being a collector of customs duties in Asia, ended his life as a money-lender among the Helvetii.3 Verginius Eufus is said to have considered his birth a disqualifi cation for the position of emperor, but compared with 1 The Sulpician gens was patrician ; Suet., Galba, ii. 3. 2 Ibid., Otho, 1 ; Vitellius, 1. 3 Ibid., Vesp., 1."], [493, "Ch.

Yet with the exception of Nerva, not one belonged by descent to the old governing class, and with the exception of Vespasian's two sons, Titus and Domitian, and of Commodus, none had any dynastic claim to the throne. Trajan and Hadrian were Spaniards, Marcus Aurelius was of Spanish descent, while the family of his predecessor, Antoninus Pius, came from Nemausus (Nimes) in Transalpine Gaul. For emperors so circumstanced, nothing was more Attempt natural than the endeavour to make of the principate a 5? lesallse r r C\u00e6sansm. permanent office, with a regular law of succession, and inherent prerogatives. There was, indeed, no open or formal break with the Augustan traditions, but the drift of their policy is unmistakable. Vespasian himself, the shrewd, thrifty, homely Sabine, who made no secret of his birth, and treated with equal contempt the sneers of Eoman society and the clumsy compliments of courtly pedigree-makers,1 was as conscious of the great ness of his position, and as firmly resolved to maintain and transmit it, as any of the C\u00e6sars.2 From him The dates the final transformation of the family names of the early C\u00e6sars into an official titulature, borne by all emperors in turn, and which, as such, not only ex pressed the continuity of the office, but distinguished the emperor from all private citizens, and placed him on a level with the Parthian ' king of kings.'

Yet the attempt was made, not without some measure of success, to establish at least the fiction of hereditary descent. Vespasian was fortunate in the possession of two grown sons;2 Nerva, Trajan, and Hadrian, in default of any natural heirs, had recourse to adoption. Moreover, the son, whether real or adopted, was marked out as the in tended heir in a somewhat novel manner. The old family surname ' C\u00e6sar ' now became the distinctive title of the heir-apparent, and it was conferred upon him by a formal and public act.3 His head appeared on the coins, and his name was coupled with that of the em peror in the public prayers.4 To the same desire to invest C\u00e6sarism with an hereditary character we may attribute the prominence given to the recitation, on inscriptions, of an official imperial pedigree, the apparent continuity of which concealed the actual breaks in the line. Just as Vespasian appropriated the names which belonged of right to the Julian emperors, so Severus not only adopted the name of Pertinax, but styled 1 For the style and titles of the Parthian kings, see Gardner, The Parthian Coinage (London, 1877). 2 Vespasian frankly designated Titus as his successor; Dio, lxvi. 12 : epe ph v'ios diadetjerat ?) ovdels dWos. 3 In the senate-house, Dio, lxvi. 1 ; Ixviii. 4 : ev ra crvvedplip Kaicrapa aniSet^e (Nerva-Trajan) ; so Antoninus Pius received the name from Hadrian. 4 E.g. in Ada Fr.

Of the nine emperors of this period, all but two, Domitian and Commodus, were deified, and thus a line of deified ancestors was formed, which linked each new C\u00e6sar with the past. The official list of the ' Divi,' the public worship of the ' Divi,' and the comme moration of their birthdays, were symbols of the con tinuity and legitimacy of C\u00e6sarism.2 These attempts to disguise the fact that the authority of each C\u00e6sar was a purely personal authority, which he had not inherited, which he could not transmit, and which expired with him, were powerfully aided by the practical necessities of administration. The maxim that the ' king never dies ' was never explicitly laid down by Eoman lawyers ; but the permanence and con tinuity of C\u00e6sar's authority were assumed as a work ing hypothesis alike by the officials who administered, and by the jurists who formulated and interpreted the law.

In the second, even the professed respect for it shown, for example, by Nero on his accession, became superfluous, as the reasons of policy which prompted it, the desire to con ciliate republican feeling, and to avoid wounding the pride of the old republican noblesse, ceased to exist. Though in certain circles of Eoman society it was still the fashion to affect a Platonic admiration for the re public,1 republicanism was extinct as a political force ; and though the senate could still be offended by dis courtesy, or goaded into hostility by persecution,2 the applause of the new men, the municipals or provincials who filled the senate-house, was easily purchased by a few compliments, while their acquiescence in the supre macy of C\u00e6sar was complete and unquestioning. The ' dual control ' set up by the Augustan system was always inconsistent with efficient government, and though not formally abolished, was systematically ignored in practice. On the one hand, the restricted sphere of administration which, at the close of the first period, had been left to the old magistracies, was still further narrowed. The administrative and judicial supremacy of consuls and pr\u00e6tors in Eome and Italy was destroyed by the ever-widening authority of C\u00e6sar's prefect of the city,3 and of the prefect of the pr\u00e6torian 1 An admiration quite compatible, as in the cases of Tacitus and the younger Pliny, with loyal service to C\u00e6sar. 2 As, for instance, in the latter part of Domitian's reign. 3 Under Domitian, the city prefect already exercised jurisdiction outside Rome.

It may be taken for granted that, of the judicial business from Eome and Italy, which formerly came before consuls and pr\u00e6tors, the greater part now went to one or other of these two great officers. A further movement in the same direction is indicated by the appearance under Trajan of imperial commissioners intended to supervise the local government of Italian towns,1 and by the creation under Hadrian and M. Aurelius of the 'consulares' and 'juridici.'2 By the close of the century such jurisdiction as remained to the consuls and pr\u00e6tors was of a strictly departmental and subordinate kind. Even the criminal jurisdiction of the consuls sitting with the senate, though still exer cised, was exercised more and more rarely, and, as a rule, only at the suggestion, or by the permission, of the emperor.3 Not less significant as a symptom of the de cline of these magistracies was the growing importance attached to the obligation of exhibiting games,4 a duty which survived all the more important functions.

Apart from C\u00e6sar, it rarely ventured to act, and though most of the em perors of this period attended its meetings when in Eome, laid business before it, and used its decrees as an instrument of legislation, the proceedings, as a rule, consisted only of the imperial speech, and the ' acclama- 1 For these 'curatores,' see Marquardt, Staatsverw. , i. 487. 2 Marquardt, Staatsverw., i. 72 ; Vit.

In proportion as the importance of the old magis tracies and of the senate, regarded as C\u00e6sar's colleagues in the work of government, declined, their importance as constituting an imperial aristocracy increased. The development of the senatorial order into an imperial peerage received a powerful impulse from Vespasian. The precedent set by him of freely admitting to the senate men not qualified by election to the qu\u00e6stor ship was followed by his successors.2 The number of men thus ennobled directly by C\u00e6sar, and the popu larity of this short and easy road to senatorial honours, steadily increased. One result was to swamp the element in the senate which had given the early C\u00e6sars most trouble. The old Eoman families gradually dis appeared, and their place was filled by new men of a different stamp, with different traditions, and often of low birth.3 Their claims to promotion were various : in some cases wealth and local influence, in others fame as an orator, sophist, or lawyer ; in others again, good work done as an official in C\u00e6sar's service.4 The 1 Plin., Epp., vii. 14 ; Mommsen, Staatsr., iii. 951. 2 For the use of the method of ' adlectio,' see Diet Antiq., s.v.

Pertinax himself was ' libertini filius,' and was a procurator in Dacia at the time of his promotion to senatorial rank. 4 Instauces in point are Herodes Atticus, Fronto, Polemo, and Favorinus. Among those thus promoted, the inscriptions mention municipal magistrates (Wilm. 1151), a pr\u00e6fectus vigilum (C. I.

At the same its connection with the tenure of the old magistracies and with the senate became looser. It was no longer necessary, either for entrance into the senate or for promotion to a higher grade, to have held a magistracy. In many cases a man was placed on admission among the ' pr\u00e6torii,' and thus at once qualified for the consulship ; and though in this period the highest rank, that of ' consu laris,' was not given except to those who had been actually consuls, the consulship was now held only for two months, so that there must have been many ' con sulares' whose tenure of office in Eome was limited to this brief period, and who had never been pr\u00e6tors, \u00e6diles, qu\u00e6stors, or tribunes. To such men the rank of ' consularis ' was of far greater importance than the consulship. There are indications also that the posses sion of senatorial dignity no longer implied that its holder sat and voted in the curia, or even resided in Eome. The provincial who had risen almost at a bound to consular rank had few ties with Eome, and probably little liking for the business of the senate house. He preferred to return home, to air his new dignity among his neighbours, and transmit it to his children. Trajan, indeed, enacted that all senators of foreign birth should invest one-third of their property in Italian land ; l but Marcus Aurelius reduced the pro portion to one-fourth.2 In the latter part of this period the senator of consular rank is a distinguished and not i Plin., Epp., vi. 19. 2 Vit.

One more change in the machinery of government remains to be noticed, the complete organisation of C\u00e6sar's own administrative service. Throughout the first century, but especially under Claudius, this service had steadily grown in numbers and importance, as the business which fell to C\u00e6sar increased in amount. It was however, from the emperors of the second century that it received its elaborate organisation, and its offi cial recognition as a state service, and among these emperors the credit for the work belongs mainly to Hadrian.2 Under him the most important of the household offices were taken out of the hands of freed men, and intrusted to Eoman knights.3 These offices thenceforward ranked as ' procuratorships,' and were in corporated with the regular civil service of the empire.4 Within this service a regular system of promotion was established, leading up from the lower to the higher 1 Philostratus ( Vit Sophist.) supplies many instances of provincial families of consular rank (76-05 v-irdriKov) ; C.

The inscriptions of the latter part of the second century indicate an increase in the number, not only of procu rators, but of the subordinate officials attached to them, and of the separate ' bureaux,' each with its staff of clerks and assistants.4 It was no doubt in the depart ment of finance that the organisation was most com plete, but it is noticeable in all the various departments of government. In the administration of justice, espe cially, important changes were made. The amount and variety of the judicial business falling to C\u00e6sar obliged even the most industrious of emperors to delegate a portion of it to others.

On the other hand, however, the practice of delegating jurisdiction to others became more regular and systematic. Such a delegated jurisdiction was already exercised at the beginning of this period in Eome and over great part of Italy, by the imperial pre fect of the city. In the course of the second century occurred the curious change by which the prefect of the pr\u00e6torian guard was transformed into a high judicial officer.1 At first occasionally used by the emperors as their representative, the prefect was, by the beginning of the third century, formally invested with both criminal and civil jurisdiction. He was occasionally in this period, and more regularly in the next, a trained lawyer, and he was assisted by a deputy prefect and by a council of expert advisers.2 The concentration of the supreme judicial authority in C\u00e6sar's hands as the ' fountain of justice ' gave a new importance, not only to the judicial officers, to whom he delegated jurisdiction, but to the assessors whom he consulted.3 Under the early emperors the practice had prevailed of inviting persons, usually senators, in whom the emperor placed confidence, to assist him with their counsel. It would seem, however, that it was in Hadrian's reign that the ' imperial council ' was first put upon a permanent footing. He admitted to it not only his personal friends, but professional lawyers,4 and after his reign 1 Mommsen, Staatsr., ii. 907, 1025. - The jurist Papinian was advocatus fisci under M.

This council, consisting partly of high imperial officials and prominent senators, partly of jurists, rapidly became, in fact, the emperor's privy council. In the fourth and fifth centuries it was known as the ' sacred consistory,' and both the name and the institution were borrowed by the Popes of Eome from the Eoman C\u00e6sars. Such is one aspect of the work accomplished by the succession of able and vigorous men who sat in the seat of Augustus during this period : \u2014 the legalisation of C\u00e6sarism as a permanent institution, the practical abolition of the dual control shared by C\u00e6sar with the regular magistrates, and the organisation under C\u00e6sar of an elaborate administrative machinery, controlled exclusively by him, and deriving its authority from him alone, as the fountain at once of power and of justice. In one important point\" they failed. While they suc ceeded in defining and establishing the position of C\u00e6sar, they left the question who the C\u00e6sar for the time should be dangerously open, and the omission to fix a law of succession again and again imperilled the uuity of the empire in the stormy times of the third century.

Their task was no doubt made easier by the gradual disappearance of distinctions of language and manners, by the assimilating influence of commercial and social intercourse, and by the extinction of national jealousies and aspirations. But it is equally certain that the ten dency of imperial policy was in the same direction. The federal theory of the empire involved the main tenance of a clear distinction between the dominant Eoman community and its alien allies. But the em perors of this period were as liberal as Augustus had been sparing in granting Eoman and Latin rights, and in thus gradually assimilating the political status of all the free-born inhabitants of the empire. The enfran chisement by Galba, Otho, and Vitellius of several cantons in the ' three Gauls ' was probably due rather to a desire to reward their own adherents, or to gain fresh ones, than to any more statesmanlike motive. 1 But the liberal policy enunciated by Claudius was consis tently followed by Vespasian aud his successors. Ves pasian, besides admitting provincials to the senate, granted Latin rights to all the non-Eoman communities of Spain,2 and the inscriptions record the names of some forty ' Flavian towns ' in the peninsula.3 It is probable that Hadrian completed the work by fully enfranchising his native country.4 Of similar wholesale grants of the franchise we have no more instances until we reach t Tac, Hist, i. 8, 51, 78. 2 Plin., N.

But apart from the sneer which Tacitus allows himself at the freedom with which the franchise was granted in his own time,1 the large number of towns which owed their rank as Eoman municipia or colonies to the emperors of the second century proves that Vespasian's successors continued his policy. They are to be found chiefly, no doubt, in the frontier provinces of the north, in Pannonia, M\u0153sia, and Thrace, and in Trajan's own creation, the province of Dacia,2 but they occur also in Africa, and in the East.3 To these municipia and colonies must be added, if we are to form a just idea of the rapid extension of the Eoman citizen-body, the allotments of lands in the pro vinces to veterans,4 the new openings for Eoman settlers afforded by the inclusion of the agri decumates within the empire,5 and by the annexation of Dacia ; finally, the liberality with which the franchise was bestowed on individual provincials must be taken into account.

These urban communities, moreover, exhibit a strong tendency to uniformity, both in their internal arrangements and in their relations to the central authority. In the case of the Eoman towns, this uniformity is unmistakable. In Italy, it is true, many of the older towns retained distinctive features, dating from the days of their independence. Yet these were, as a rule, limited to the titles borne by their magistrates, or to small points of local usage ; in the main, the statement of a writer in the second century that the ' distinctive rights of the municipalities have been obliterated ' holds good.1 In the Eoman towns in the provinces, even these superficial variations are rarely traceable. The vast majority had been founded or incorporated by the C\u00e6sars, and their constitutions were all framed upon the same lines.2 Among the non-Eoman towns \u2014 the ' allied communities ' \u2014 the case is much the same. The Latin towns, once the most favoured allies, were under the empire not so much allies as Eoman towns with in ferior rights, and the grant of the 'Latin rights' was a stepping-stone to the acquisition of the full franchise ; the Latin town received on incorporation, a constitution 1 Aul.

Here and there, among the communities of Gaul, traces of Keltic institutions and usages survived.2 The Greek communities of the eastern provinces re tained their own institutions and laws, and the necessity of respecting local law and custom is insisted upon by both Eoman emperors and Eoman lawyers.3 But alike imperial in the Greek East and in the Latin West the tendency J^mcipal to uniformity was strengthened by the steady and con tinuous action of the authority of C\u00e6sar. The interests of the empire were so intimately bound up with the prosperity of the municipalities, that the supervision of the latter became one of the first duties of the imperial government, and how close and constant this supervision became is shown by the letters of the younger Pliny from Bithynia, and by the numerous imperial rescripts quoted in the Digest. The first duty of the proconsul, or legate, was to see that the condition of the commu nities under his care was such as to enable them to discharge their duties to the empire. In serious cases a special commissioner was sent, and even the free towns were not exempt from inspection.

But at the same time it tended to weaken municipal patriotism and energy, and to produce an excessive dependence on the central power. The restless energy, the unceasing vigilance, and profuse liberality of Hadrian, were not without their dangers, and among the symptoms of weakness apparent, amidst the pro sperity of the age of the Antonines, the flagging vigour of the municipalities was one of the most serious.

The visions of world-wide empire, in which the generation of Horace indulged, had passed away, and the prayer of Tacitus, ' May the nations continue, if not to love us, at least to hate each other,' l contrasts significantly with the exuberant confidence of the Augustan age. The frontier lines which Augustus had marked out as fixing the limit of Eoman aggression were now to be the defences of Eome against barbarian invasion. The pressure which, in the third century, drove one bar barian tribe after another into Eoman territory, was making itself felt even in the time of Vespasian, and was the justification both for Trajan's annexation of Dacia, and for Hadrian's elaborate fortifications. The contributions to this work of frontier defence made by Vespasian himself were not unimportant, though he waged no frontier war, and bore no triumphal surname. It was he who moved forward the legionary camps to the banks of the Danube, and reorganised the flotilla on the river.2 On the eastern frontier he took an important step towards its better organisation. Cappadocia was placed under the command of a legate of consular rank, to whom naturally fell the defence of the Upper Euphrates, from Melitene northwards.3 i Tac, Germania, 33 ; cf. his remarks on the camps by the Rhine, Hist, iv. 23. 2 The camps of the 13th legion at Vindobona, and of the 15th (Apol linaris) at Carnuntum, date from Vespasian ; Schiller, Gesch. d.

Under Domitian the need for strengthening the defences along the Upper Ehine and Danube was even more clearly perceived. We hear of raids by Dacians and Sarmat\u00e6, and of expeditions sent to chastise them.1 For the protection of the numerous settlers who had made homes for themselves beyond the Ehine in the ' agri decumates,' a new frontier line was drawn, so as to include this territory within the limits of the empire.2 It is probable, too, that the necessities of frontier defence were one reason for the subdivision of M\u0153sia into two provinces, a policy followed by Trajan in the case of Pannonia. The reign of Trajan 3 presents a marked contrast to the cautious defensive policy of the Flavian emperors. His brilliant campaigns threw into the shade the com paratively uneventful annals of his predecessors, and recalled the heroic days of C\u00e6sar and Pompey. But on the policy which dictated them it is difficult to pro nounce a positive judgment. That Trajan -was a soldier, and a. soldier with a dash of Chauvinism in his nature, is clear ; but the author of the rescripts to Pliny, and the organiser of the ' alimentary foundations ' in Italy, must have been a statesman also.

Powerful in itself, it was also dangerous as a centre round which the more loosely-compacted barbarous tribes in the neighbourhood might rally.1 The raids of the Dacians and their allies were increasing in boldness and frequency. Finally, the country was reputed rich in mineral wealth, and the prospect of gain may, as in the case of Britain, have helped to form Trajan's decision. The conquest of Dacia was effected in two campaigns,2 and the memory of what was one of the last of Eoman conquests was preserved by the stately column erected by Trajan in his new forum at Eome.3 The country was declared a province, and to ensure that it should serve as an effective outpost of Eoman rule against bar barism, settlers from the provinces of the west, and from Asia Minor, were planted there in large numbers, and every encouragement was given to the growth of towns and town life. Eoads were made, the mines were worked, and this newest of the frontier provinces rapidly overtook the others in civilisation and prosperity.4 Very different, alike in the causes which provoked Trajan m the them and in their results, were Trajan's campaigns in the East.

Vic tories, however brilliant, were in these regions only a prelude to fresh wars, and Trajan's successor, while re taining Dacia, abandoned the lands won beyond the Euphrates. Trajan's dazzling exploits in the East resulted in only one permanent addition to Eoman territory, the province of Arabia-Petr\u00e6a.1 Hadrian 2 was, like his kinsman and fellow-country man Trajan, a soldier by training, but like Augustus, whom in many respects he took as his model, he was more statesman than soldier, and preferred diplomacy to arms.

It was, however, probably by Hadrian that the great frontier barrier was constructed, or at least completed, which connected the Ehine above Mainz with the Danube at Eelheim.2 An even more stately monument of his energy was the Eoman wall carried across the north of Britain from the Tyne to the Solway Firth.3 In the latter case, and partially in the case of the German limes, the barrier was a solidly built wall, guarded by a series of camps, and in the intervals between the camps by smaller stations and guard towers. It is possible that to Hadrian may also belong the forts erected along the Danube, the repair of which is mentioned in the reign of Commodus. In Africa he created for the third legion (in.

Encouraged by the fact that a portion of the army of the Danube had been withdrawn for a Parthian war, they broke into Pannonia, and for the first time for more than two hundred years the sacred soil of Italy was trodden by barbarian invaders.

From this war, too, dates the policy, which had in the end such disastrous results, of transplanting barbarians to the Eoman side of the frontier. Whole tribes were granted lands in the frontier provinces, in one case even in Italy, at Eavenna, and were enrolled as soldiers of Eome.1 The Marcomannic war was not the only warning of Revolt of impending trouble. The pretenders to the imperial elites purple, the so-called ' tyrants ' of the third and fourth centuries, found a prototype in Avidius Cassius, who, after successfully concluding the Parthian war (166-167 a.d.), made an unsuccessful attempt to win for himself the title and powers of emperor.2 On the whole, how-ever, despite the increasing pres- General sure upon the frontiers, and the increased strain on therperiod\u00b0 the finances which the defence of the frontiers involved, the period from 69 a.d. to 193 a.d. deserves much of the praise which has been lavished upon it.

Even philosophy ceased to be irreconcilable ; it kept aloof from political specu lation, and devoted itself to teaching men how to live.2 The foremost writers and teachers of the time were not only favoured with the patronage and friendship of C\u00e6sar, but for the most part they wrere paid servants of the government, holding chairs endowed by the emperor, and with special privileges accorded to them by his edicts.3 Many of them were enrolled by his favour in the ranks of the new imperial nobility, and honoured with the consulship.4 A somewhat similar change is 1 E.g. under Domitian ; Suet., Dom., 10. 2 Zeller, Phil. d.

Even during the first half of this period the foremost jurists were, as in republican days, men of good birth and position, with whom the study and exposition of the law was a pursuit rather than a profession.1 But the lawyers of the latter part of the second, like those of the third century, were men of humbler origin, trained in C\u00e6sar's service, who rose to sit on his council, or to fill the post of pr\u00e6torian prefect in virtue of their professional skill. Alike in the literature and in the society of this period, two other characteristics deserve notice as being of historical importance. The affectation of what was archaic, at which Quintilian sneered in the field of literature, was widespread.2 The artificial republicanism of the younger Pliny and Tacitus, and of their fellows who drank to the memory of Brutus and Cassius while drawing C\u00e6sar's pay, was closely akin to the literary purism which preferred Cato and Ennius to Cicero and Virgil.3 In imitation of Cato, Hadrian wore a beard, and he is said to have quoted Cato in justification of his foreign policy.4 The fashion reappears in the field of art, though here, as was inevitable, it was to Greek and not to Eoman models that men returned.5 In the same spirit we find some of the Italian towns laying official stress on their ancient traditions. Capena re vived its ancient title of ' urbs f\u0153derata,' and Bovill\u00e6 its ancient tie with the extinct Alba Longa.6 Nor was this return to the past followed by any renewed creative 1 E.g.

The policy of Augustus had aimed at the ascendency not only of the Latin race but of Latin civilisation ; and Greek culture, though liberally treated and allowed its own way in the provinces properly belonging to it, held only a subordinate place. Under the Flavian emperors, partly perhaps in reaction against Nero's phil-Hellenism,1 Latinism was still dominant, and even under Trajan the two foremost names in literature are Italian. But this state of things could not long continue, as the bar riers which separated Italy and the ruling race from the rest of the empire were broken down. The idea of a cosmopolitan civilisation common to the whole empire replaced the narrower theory. The Greek scholars in the time of Cicero were pensioners in the houses of Eoman nobles ; under Hadrian they were senators and consuls. Even professors of Eastern mysticism, from Eastern Asia Minor or Syria, were admitted to the imperial presence, and had their train of followers.2 This cosmopolitanism accurately reflected the poli tical change which had passed over the empire and the imperial unity under the rule of C\u00e6sar which the emperors of this period strove to bring about. But its result was a civilisation, widely diffused indeed, and which was outwardly brilliant and attractive, but which had no unity and no progressive energy.

Of the two forces which for a time supplied the splendid administrative machinery, elaborated by the C\u00e6sars of this period with motive power, neither owed much to the composite civilisation of which Hadrian's villa at Tibur was a typical product. The free use of barbarians for imperial defence prolonged the existence of the empire. Christianity infused new life into its various populations. The latter force was indeed as yet far from being accepted as an ally by the imperial government, and the Christian communities lay under the ban of the law, though the law was only occasionally and fitfully enforced. But their numbers were rapidly increasing. In Asia Minor, in Bithynia, Galatia, and Cappadocia, they formed a large and important element in the population, while the Christian community in Eome was numerous and influential.1 The period which witnessed the silent and steady diffusion of the Christian communities over the empire witnessed also the catastrophe which severed the Jews and Judaism from their own country. The capture of Jerusalem by Titus was scarcely more of a blow than the transformation of the holy city by Hadrian into the Eoman colony of \u00c6lia Capitolina, the erection of heathen altars where the temple of Jehovah had stood, and the exclusion of the Jews themselves from the city.2 1 Schiller, Gesch. d.

But between the death of Severus in 211 A.D. and the accession of Diocletian in 284 a.d. no fewer than twenty-three emperors sat in the seat of Augustus, and of these all but three died violent deaths at the hands of a mutinous soldiery, or by the orders of a successful rival.

It was, however, during the reign of Gallienus (260-268 a.d.) that the evil reached its height. The central authority was para lysed ; the barbarians were pouring in from the north ; the Parthians were threatening to overrun the eastern provinces ; and the legions on the frontiers were left to repel the enemies of Eome as best they could. A hundred ties bound them closely to the districts in which they were stationed -. their permanent camps had grown into the likeness of towns, they had families and farms; the unarmed provincials looked to them as their natural protectors, and were attached to them by bonds of intermarriage and by long intercourse. Now that they found themselves left to repel by their own efforts the invaders from without, they reasonably enough claimed the right to ignore the central authority which was powerless to aid them, and to choose for themselves ' imperatores ' whom they knew and trusted. The first of these provincial empires was that estab lished by Postumus in Gaul (259-272 A.D.), and long maintained by his successors Victorinus and Tetricus.2 Their authority was acknowledged, not only in Gaul and by the troops on the Ehine, but by the legions of Britain and Spain ; and under Postumus, at any rate, the existence of the Gallic empire was justified by the repulse of the barbarians, and by the restora tion of peace and security to the provinces of Gaul. 1 Gibbon, i. chap. v. ; Schiller, Gesch. d.

Although any serious loss of territory had been avoided, the storms of the third century had told with fatal effect upon the general condition of the empire. The ' Eoman peace ' had vanished ; not only the frontier territories, but the central districts of Greece, Asia Minor, and even Italy itself, had suffered from the ravages of war, and the fortification of Eome by Aure lian was a significant testimony to the altered condition of affairs.1 War, plague, and famine had thinned the population and crippled the resources of the provinces.

The old established culture and civilisation of the Mediter ranean world rapidly declined, and the mixture of barbaric rudeness with Oriental pomp and luxury -which marked the court even of the better emperors, such as Aurelian,2 was typical of the general deterioration. 1 Zosimus i. 49 ; Vit.

It at least reduced the too familiar risk of a disputed succession by establishing in the two C\u00e6sars the natural successors to the higher position of Augusti ; and finally, it satisfied the jealous pride of the rival armies of the empire by giving them what they had so constantly claimed, ' imperatores ' of their own. The distribution of power between Diocletian and his colleagues followed those lines of division which the feuds of the previous century had only too clearly marked out. The armies of the Ehine, the Danube, and of Syria fell to the lot respectively of Constantius, Galerius, and Diocletian, the central districts of Italy, and Africa, to Maximian.2 A second point in the new system was the complete and final emancipation of the imperial authority from all constitutional limitation and control.

The divided powers, the parallel jurisdictions, the defined prerogatives of the Augustan system all vanished. There was but one legal authority throughout the empire, that of the emperor himself ; and that authority was absolute. This avowed despotism Diocle tian, following in the steps of Aurelian, hedged round with all the pomp and majesty of Oriental monarchy. The final adoption of the title ' dominus,' so often rejected by the earlier emperors, the diadem on the head, the robes of silk and gold, the replacement of the republican salutation of a fellow-citizen by the adoring prostration even of the highest in rank before their lord and master, were all significant marks of the new regime.1 In the hands of this absolute ruler was Levelling placed the entire control of an elaborate administrative D\u00b00'cietian. machinery.

At the head of the former, at least under the completed organisation of Constantine, were the four prefects;3 next below them the 'vicarii,' who had charge of the 'dioceses'; below these again the gover- nors of the separate provinces (' pr\u00e6sides,' ' correctores,' ' consulares '),4 under each of whom was a host of niinor officials.

But his death, which deprived the weaker valens. Valens of a trusted counsellor and ally, was followed by 4\"37S A'I>' a crisis on the Danube, more serious than any which had occurred there since the defeat of Decius. In 376 A.D. the Goths, hard pressed by their new foes from the Revolt of eastward, the Huns, sought and obtained the protection e \u00b0 s of the Eoman empire.1 They were transported across the Danube, and settled in M\u0153sia, but, indignant at the treatment they received, they rose in arms against their protestors. In 378 a.d., at Hadrianople, Valens was defeated and killed ; the victorious Goths spread with fire and sword over Illyricum; and advanced eastward to the very walls of Constantinople. Once more, how ever, the danger passed away. The skill and tact of Theo- Theodosius, who had been proclaimed emperor of the East by Gratian, conciliated the Goths ; they were granted an allowance, and in large numbers entered the service of the Eoman emperor. The remaining years of Theodosius's reign (382-395 A.D.) were mainly engrossed by the duty, which now devolved upon the emperor of the East, of upholding the increasingly feeble authority of his colleague in the West against the attacks of pre tenders. Maximus, the murderer of Gratian (383 a.d.), was at first recognised by Theodosius as C\u00e6sar, and left in undisturbed command of Gaul, Spain, and Britain ; but when in 386 A.D. he proceeded to oust Valentinian II. i Schiller, ii. 376 sqq. ; Gibbon, iii. ch. xxvi. ; Hodgkin, i. 102 sqq. ; Amm.

But, though no province had yet been lost, as Dacia had been lost in the century before,, and though the frontier lines of the Ehine and the Danube were still guarded by Eoman forts and troops, there were signs in plenty that a catastrophe was at hand.

To meet the increased expenditure necessary to maintain the legions, to pay the hosts of officials, and to keep up the luxurious splendour of the imperial courts, not only were the taxes raised in amount, but the most oppressive and inquisitorial methods were adopted in order to secure for the imperial treasury every penny that could be wrung from the wretched taxpayer.

Among the graver symptoms of economic ruin were the decrease of popula tion, which seriously diminished not only the number of taxpayers, but the supply of soldiers for the legions ;2 the spread of infanticide ; the increase of waste lands whose owners and cultivators had fled to escape the tax collector; the declining prosperity of the towns; and the constantly recurring riots and insurrections, both among starving peasants, as in Gaul,3 and in populous cities like Antioch.4 The distress was aggra vated by the civil wars, by the rapacity of tyrants, such as Maxentius and Maximus, but above all by the raids of the barbarians, who seized every opportunity afforded by the dissensions or incapacity of the emperors to cross the frontiers and harry the lands of the provincials. Constantine, Julian, and Valen tinian I. had each to give a temporary breathing space to Gaul by repelling the Franks and Alemanni. Britain was harassed by Picts and Scots from the 1 Eumenius, Paneg.

In the East, in addition to the constant border feud with Persia, we hear of ravages by the Isaurian mountaineers, and by a new enemy, the Saracens.1 Even more ominous of coming clanger was the extent to which the European half of the empire was becoming barbarised. The policy which had been inaugurated by Augustus himself of settling barbarians within the frontiers had been taken up on a larger scale and in a more systematic way by the Illyrian emperors of the third century, and was continued by their successors in the fourth. In Gaul, in the provinces south of the Danube, even in Macedonia and Italy, large barbarian settlements had been made, Theodosius in particular distinguishing himself by his liberality in this respect. Nor did the barbarians admitted during the fourth cen tury merely swell the class of half-servile colons On the contrary, they not only constituted to an increasing extent the strength of the imperial forces, but won their way in ever-growing numbers to posts of dignity and importance in the imperial service.

The names of Arbogast, Stilicho, and Eufinus are sufficient proof of the place held by barbarians near the emperor's person and in the control of the provinces and legions of Eome ; and the relations of Arbogast to his nominee for the purple, Eugenius, were an anticipation of those which existed between Eicimer and the emperors of the latter half of the fifth century. It was by barbarians already settled within the empire that the first of the series of attacks which finally separated the Western provinces from the empire and set up a barbaric ruler in Italy were made,1 and it was in men of barbarian birth that Eome found her ablest and most successful defenders, and the emperors both of East and West their most capable and powerful ministers. The Visigoths whom Alaric led into Italy had been settled south of the Danube as the allies of the empire since the accession of Theodosius. The greater part of them were Christians at least in name, and Alaric himself had stood high in the favour of Theodosius. The causes which set them in motion are tolerably clear. Like the Germans of the days of C\u00e6sar, they wanted land for their own, and to this land-hunger was evidently added in Alaric's own case 1 Accounts of the leading ancient authorities for the period 395 476 will be found prefixed to the several chapters in Hodglcin's Italy and her Invaders, vols. i. ii.

The jealousy which existed between the rulers of the Western and Eastern empires furthered his plans. In the name of Arcadius, the emperor of the East, or at least with the connivance of Arcadius's minister Eufinus, he occupied Illyricum, and from thence rav aged Greece, which, according to the existing division of provinces, belonged to the Western empire. Thence in 396 A.D. he retreated before Stilicho to Illyricum, with the command of which he was now formally invested by Arcadius, and which gave him the best possible starting-point for an attack on Italy.1 In 400 Alaric t A.D. he led his people, with their wives and families, 40sJ^'D their wagons and treasure, to seek lands for themselves south of the Alps. But in this first invasion he pene- trated no farther than the plains of Lombard}', and after the desperate battle of Pollentia (402 a.d.2) he slowly withdrew from Italy, his retreat being hastened by the promises of gold freely made to him by the imperial government. Not until the autumn of 408 a.d. did Alaric again cross the Alps. Stilicho was dead ; the bar- barian troops in Honorius's service had been provoked into joining Alaric by the insane anti-Teutonic policy of Honorius and his ministers, and Alaric marched un opposed to Eome : this time, however, the payment of a heavy ransom saved the city.

Ravenna, but though Alaric's demands were moderate, Honorius would grant neither lands for his people nor the honourable post in the imperial service which he asked for himself. Once more Alaric sat down before Rome, and this time the panic-stricken citizens dis covered a fresh mode of escape. Attalus, a Greek, the prefect of the city, was declared Augustus, and Alaric accepted the post of commander-in-chief. But the incapacity of Attalus was too much for the patience of his barbarian minister and patron, who after a few months' reign formally deposed him and renewed his offers to Honorius. Again, however, they were declined, and Alaric marched to the siege and sack of Rome (410 A.D.).1 But his death followed hard on his capture of Rome, and two years later (412 A. D.) his successor Ataulf led the Visigoths to find in Gaul the lands which Alaric had sought in Italy. It is characteristic of the anarchical condition of the West that Ataulf and his Goths should have fought for Honorius in Gaul against the tyrants,2 and in Spain against the Vandals, Suevi, and Alani ; and it was with the consent of Honorius that in 419 A.D. Wallia, who had followed Ataulf as king of the Visigoths, finally settled with his people in south western Gaul and founded the Visigothic monarchy.3 It was about the same period that the accomplished fact of the division of Spain between the three barbarian 1 For the treatment of Rome by Alaric, see Hodgkin, i. 370, with Gibbon, iv. 101, and Ranke, Weltgesch., iv. 246.

A portion of the host led by Radagaisus2 actually invaded Italy, but were cut to pieces by Stilicho near Florence (405 A.D.) ; the rest pressed on through Gaul, crossed the Pyrenees, and entered the as yet untouched province of Spain. Honorius died in 423 A.D. His authority had sur vived the dangers to which it had been exposed alike from the rivalry of tyrants and barbaric- invasion, and with the single exception of Britain,3 no province had yet formally broken loose from the empire. But over a great part of the West this authority was now little more than nominal ; throughout the major part of Gaul and in Spain the barbarians had settled, and barbarian states were growing up which, though they still recog nised the paramount supremacy of the emperor, were in all essentials independent of his control. The question for the future was whether this relationship between the declining imperial authority and the vigorous young states which had planted the seeds of a fresh life in the provinces would be maintained. The long reign of Valentinian III. (423-455 A.D.) is marked by two events of first-rate importance : the 1 Jung, Die Romanisclwn I.andschaften, 73 sqq. 2 For the connection between this movement and those of Alaric and of the Vandals, see Hodgkin, i. 282, 304 ; Gibbon, iv. 46. 3 The Roman troops were withdrawn from Britain by Constantine in 409 a.d. ; Jung, 305."], [544, "Vandal conquest of Africa. 429 A.D. 518 HISTORY OF ROME [Book vn. conquest of Africa by the Vandals,1 and the invasion of Gaul and Italy by Attila. The Vandal settlement in Africa was closely akin in its origin and results to those of the Visigoths and of the Vandals themselves in Gaul and Spain. Here as there the occasion was given by the jealous quarrels of powerful imperial ministers. The feud between Boniface, count of Africa, and \u00c6tius, the 'master-general' or 'count of Italy,' opened the way to Africa for the Vandal king Gaiseric (Genseric), as that between Stilicho and Eufinus had before set Alaric in motion westward, and as the quarrel between the tyrant Constantine and the ministers of Honorius had opened the way for the Vandals, Sueves, and Alans into Spain. In this case too, as in the others, the hunger for more land and treasure was the impelling motive with the barbarian invader, and in Africa, as in Gaul and Spain, the in vaders' acquisitions were confirmed by the imperial authority which they still professed to recognise. It was in 429 A.D. that Gaiseric, king of the Vandals, crossed with his warriors, their families and goods, to the pro vince of Africa, a province hitherto almost as untouched as Spain by the ravages of war. Thanks to the quarrels of Boniface and \u00c6tius, their task was an easy one. The defenceless province was easily and quickly over run. In 435 A.D. 2 a formal treaty secured them in the possession of a large portion of the rich lands which were the granary of Eome, in exchange for a 1 Hodgkin, ii. 233-290; Gibbon, iv. 176-188, 256; Jung, 183.

Eleven years later (451 A.D.) Attila invaded Gaul, Attiiaand but this Hunnish movement was in a variety of ways 45lAl5 different from those of the Visigoths and Vandals. Nearly a century had passed since the Huns first appeared in Europe, and drove the Goths to seek shelter within the Eoman lines. Attila was now the ruler of a great empire in central and northern Europe,1 for in addition to his own Huns, the German tribes along the Ehine and Danube, and far away to the north, owned him as king. He confronted the Eoman power as an equal ; and, in marked contrast to the Gothic and Vandal chieftains, he treated with the emperors of East and West as an independent sovereign. His advance on Gaul and Italy threatened, not the estab lishment of yet one more barbaric chieftain on Eoman soil, but the subjugation of the civilised and Christian West to the rule of a heathen and semi-barbarous conqueror. But Eome now reaped the advantages of the policy which Honorius had perhaps involuntarily followed. The Visigoths in Gaul, Christian and already half Eomanised, rallied to the aid of the empire against a common foe.

(453 a.d.) the western branch of the house of Theodosius came to an end, and the next twenty years witnessed the accession and deposition of nine emperors. The three months' rule of Maximus is memorable only for the invasion of Italy and the sack of Eome by the Vandals under Gaiseric. From 456-472 A.d. the actual ruler of Italy was Eicimer, the Sueve. Of the four emperors whom he placed on the throne, Majorian (457 461 a.d.) alone played any imperial part outside Italy.1 Eicimer died in 472 A.D., and two years later a Pan nonian, Orestes, aspired to take the place which Eicimer had occupied. Julius Nepos was deposed, and Orestes filled the vacancy by proclaiming as Augustus his own son Eomulus. But Orestes's tenure of power was brief. The barbarian mercenaries in Italy determined to secure for themselves a position there such as that which their kinsfolk had won in Gaul and Spain and Africa. On their demand for a third of the lands of Italy being re fused by Orestes,2 they instantly rose in revolt, and'on the defeat and death of Orestes they proclaimed their leader, Odoacer the Eugian,3 their king. Eomulus Augustulus laid down his imperial dignity, and the court at Constantinople was informed that there was no longer an emperor of the West.4 The installation of a barbarian chief as ruler in Italy i Majorian was the last Roman emperor who appeared in person in Spain and Gaul. 2 Hodgkin, i. 531. 3 The nationality of Odoacer is a disputed point ; Hodgkin, i. 52S ; Ranke, iv.

In Spain, Gaul, and Africa barbarian chieftains were already established as kings. In Italy, for the last twenty years, the real power had been wielded by a barbarian officer. Odoacer, when he decided to dis pense with the nominal authority of an emperor of the West, placed Italy on the same level of independence with the neighbouring provinces. But the old ties with Eome were not severed. The new ruler of Italy formally recognised the supremacy of the one Eoman emperor at Constantinople, and was invested in return with the rank of ' patrician,' which had been held before him by \u00c6tius and Eicimer. In Italy too, as in Spain and Gaul, the laws, the administrative system, and the language remained Eoman.1 But the emanci pation of Italy and the western provinces from direct imperial control, which is signalised by Odoacer's accession, has rightly been regarded as marking the opening of a new epoch. It made possible in the West the development of a Eomano-German civilisation; it facilitated the growth of new and distinct states and nationalities ; finally, it gave a new impulse to the in fluence of the Christian Church, and laid the foundations of the power of the bishops of Eome. i Gibbon, iv. 302 ; Jung, 66 sqq. ; Bryce, Holy Roman Empire, 24-33."], [548, ""], [549, "523 INDEX Aborigines, the, traditions of, 1, 15 ; identified with the Pelasgi, 5 Acarnania, treatment of, by Rome, 137 Ach\u00e6ans, the, join Rome against Phili p, 129 ; rewarded, 130 ; treatment of, by Rome, 137-8 ; Rome at war with, 138 ; allied with Mithridates, 273 Achaia, held by Brutus and Cassius, 332 ; under the C\u00e6sars, 462 Actium, battle of, 311, 355 sqq. \u00c6diles curules instituted, 57 \u00c6dui, the, allied with Rome, 241 ; attacked by Ariovistus, 251 ; appeal to Rome, 251 ; revolt of, 261-2 \u00c6milianus, P.
