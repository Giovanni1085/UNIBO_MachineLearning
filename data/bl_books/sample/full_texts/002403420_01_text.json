Speak, Satire ! for there's none can tell, like thee, Of England's boasted generosity ; How Justice, hoodwink'd, trembles 'neath her scales When people's clamour over right prevails ; How patriotism in the bosom sinks When manly courage from its duty shrinks ; How Place will warp and Party seal the soul, And bend and bind all to their base control ; How righteous judgment hardens into self, How kindly feeling's withered up by pelf, How, when Humility for power will crave, Her cry of honesty's the greatest knave. Go back a few short years that all may see In the deep treasures of thy memory, The wildest passion gather in the storm, And Place and Party pander to Reform. \" Retrench,\" \" retrench,\" the placeless member cries ; \" Retrench,\" the Placeman louder still replies, 'Tis for retrenchment, only, that we rule, Nor wish our cry the country to befool. And both as loud for a commission call, By its decision each will stand or fall, Each to the other bows obsequiously, More servile still to their constituency."], [12, "6 Now round the Council-board they gravely sit, Sir Placeless feels how nice the place would fit, Sees in the distance, ripening, a pear, That, falling's worth five thousand pounds a year. The wily Placeman knows his vantage ground, Knows that retrenchment's but a hollow sound. Enlarges on their duty to the State, And that the Country is most fortunate In having servants free from love of gain, Disinterested, high-soul' d gentlemen ; Who use no patronage to serve their ends, Who give no places to their sons or friends, Who, from the purest love their Country serve, From justice, truth, and honour, never swerve : \" The nation cries that her expenditure Is greater than she longer can endure, And this Commission now is left to say Which item shall be left, which pruned away ; Nor dare she think that we would wrong her, when We're all such noble, high-soul' d gentlemen. Still 'twill be difficult, as we shall see, To use the pruning knife with equity. We know the higher the remuneration So much the better will men serve the nation. I'm not now speaking of the common herd, Who work far better with a less reward, But of the high-soid'd Senator, and they Who rule the Army and the Admiralty, Whose salaries and our own we will secure, Although the duty done be sinecure ; Although the wisdom exercised to rule May often be detected in the fool, Shall we, examinators, jury, judge, Be like unto the Soldier \u2014 -England's drudge ?

I saw that Soldier marching to the strife, Of self regardless, reckless he of life ; Strike down the foe, and rescue from his hand The weeping daughter of his own dear land ; Take vengeance for the mutilated babe, And mothers massacred by Nana Sahib. In seven-and-twenty fights he dauntless stood Where Delhi's walls are washed by Jumna's flood; For seven successive days in Delhi's streets \u2014 Though blood and death at every step he meets \u2014 He bears that flag triumphantly along, And quells the spirit of the sable throng. Then, over Lucknow proudly sees it fly, And joins his comrades' shout of victory."], [14, "8 I saw him stricken with the red-hot sun, And through his veins the burning fever run ; Weak as a child the stalwart Soldier lies, Far from his home and all its sympathies ; Far from the pillow of his Mother's breast, And Sister's voice to soothe him to his rest ; Far from the Comrade, whom the toil and strife Had bound in friendship dear to him as life.

For disgraceful conduct in having (to secure his political influence with the advanced Liberals) defrauded the Army of its extra pay for length of service, amounting to twenty-seven (27) pounds per man ; also of pension, for length of service, amounting to one hundred and forty-six pounds per man, or,"], [33, "27 which is equivalent thereto, making the term of service eight years longer. 3rd Charge. For duplicity, in having professed a kindly and generous feeling towards the Army ; yet offering as a free gift for good conduct, the pay and pension of which it had been deprived ; he well knowing that it would be morally impossible for any Soldier to fulfil the conditions under which the offer was made. 4th Charge. For canting hypocrisy, in having (influenced by sentimen tal demagogues) professed a deep anxiety for the Army's moral good, at the same time evincing a total disregard for all reli gious truths, by establishing regulations by which a Commander is compelled to certify to a man's good conduct, though he be a bad, immoral, worthless man, and a worse soldier. And by the same regulations enabling one man, who has never seen a shot fired, to receive two hundred and three pounds more than another, who, though a more thoughtless man, is in possession of ten medals. Pres. Prisoner John Bull, are you Guilty or Not Guilty of the crimes laid to your charge ? Pris. Not Guilty. Pres. Mr Rank and File, you may bring in the first Witness. Rank and File. Before bringing in witnesses to prove The charges preferred against the Prisoner, I will briefly review before the Court His antecedents. In years gone by He was a frank and nohle gentleman, And, though not wealthy then as he is now, He kept from no man what was just and right. As honest weight and measure to the price, So, also, did he mete the Soldier's hire. And when worn out, his hand would kindly smooth The downward pathway to the edge of life."], [34, "28 Proud was he of his courage, and would boast That sleeping glory had revived again ; That honour's sabre flashed so bright and true As to redeem from Europe's bitter taunts, Of one long century, the fame of Britain ; That e'en the days of Marlbro' were eclipsed By Crawford, who out-Sparta'd Sparta, To join in Talavera's bloody field, And then take outpost duty through the night. And he would point to Albuhera's hill, The siege of Badajoz and St Sebastian, The hill-fights into France \u2014 Orthes\u2014 - Toulouse, And to the crowning fight of Waterloo. And when our soldiers thence victorious came Does he [Pointing to the Prisoner, forget the madness of his joy ; The peoples' gath'rings and shoutings in the streets ; What welcomings ; what shakings of the hands ; What runnings to kill the fatted calf, And the disputings who should be taken home, There to rejoice and to make merry ? And then the unction of his own \" God bless you,\" As on the soldier's head he laid his hand, And looked down on his tender innocents. And she, his pride, his elder budding rose, He fondly nestled, sheltering on his breast, As fancy pictured, knocking at the door, The hosts of France, so lately at Boulogne, Whose footprints leave each beauteous tender flower To wilt and wither in its soiled leaves. So grateful was he then and generous, He gave to every man who conquered there The first of silver medals ever granted, And forty pounds, or its equivalent. Then came on twenty years of idleness, A time that Wisdom called the Devil's Own,"], [35, "29 In which he sows his seed and gathers in Rich crops of sorrows, wailings, and oppressions. Long did the prisoner resist his wiles, Until, in evil hour, he bent the knee, Where the new creed of Commerce is enshrined, The creed is this : Where things are cheapest buy, where dearest sell ; There's gold in sweat, one drop on profits tell ; Grind labour down, there's gold in children's pain ; Crimp from old age ; Gain, gain, have faith in gain. Look on his garments' hem, 'tis written there ; Look on his frontlet, it is written there ; Look on his breast-plate for his Mammon's Priest \u2014 There's deeply 'graved\u2014 get money and be blest. By Adam Smith this creed was first compiled, Since preached by Hume, the Quaker, and great Richard. Fit emanation from Satanic mind To be adopted by a Reverend ! 'Tis said, or sung, at morning, noon, and eve ; And men of Commerce loudly cry, Amen. All rulers and the Senate cry, Amen. Philosophers, mighty in intellect, Expound the creed with subtlest argument And justify the means unto the end, Till, on the altar of Economy, There's offered up a sacrifice to Mammon, The pittance taken from the pay of him, Who fought and bled and nobly conquered. And the sweet smelling savour's human tears, And sighs and sorrows wrung from trembling years. There's little doubt but that this hellish creed Has been the Prisoner's stumbling block, The rock of his offence. To gloss it o'er, He summoned to the hall of Exeter The sickly sentiment of this great realm ;"], [36, "30 And, with Cupidity on his right hand ; And Virtue, in regimentals, on his left, He framed the Code of Mock-Morality : Cupidity dictating every clause, While Virtue wrote, nor knew she was deceived, Or that she framed Good Conduct Regulations Exalting infamy to laugh at Heaven. [Enter 1st Witness, John Horsman, Pensioner.] Pres. (To the witness wlio takes the book.) The evidence you shall give before this Court shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. [Witness kisses the book. Rank and File. How long were you in the service, what Regiment, and what is your pension ? * Horsman. I was in the 10th twenty one years, and have one shilling a day pension. Rank and File. Had you any extra pay for length of service ? Horsman. I had one penny aster ten, and twopence after fourteen, years' service. Rank and File. Do you know why that was given? Horsman. As a reward for skilled labour, and as there were many limited service men it was to induce them to remain. Rank and File. Was there such a necessity for men ? Horsman. One skilled man is worth two recruits, and the Prisoner was afraid Napoleon would come over from Boulogne. Rank and File. Do you find your shilling a day enough to keep you ? Horsman. At first it helped to keep me comfortably enough ; but since I have been past work I am tried a good deal at times. It doesn't seem to go so far as it used to ; I don't know how it is, but the schoolmaster's son tells us that a shilling is not worth now so much as a shilling was formerly. I pay threepence for a bed now and I used to only pay twopence."], [37, "31 Rank and File. Then, if that is the case, you are not getting the value that the Prisoner intended and promised to the Soldier. Horsman. I do not know how it is, but this I do know, my shilling won't go so far. Rank and File. Had you served longer than twenty-one years, would you have received a higher pension ? Horsman. Any man who liked to serve longer, and was able, got a halfpenny a day for every year ; but few men were able. Twenty-one years' soldiering is living three years for two. Marchings, camps, bivouacs, and Indian climate bring on rheumatic pains ; the joints get stiff; the pack gets heavier ; younger men pass you in the double ; and there is a gradual failing (yet unseen to others) in the physical powers, that really few men are fit for active soldiering. Besides, has the Soldier, after twenty-one years' absence, no home that his heart yearns for ? [Exit. [Enter Thos. Atkins, Pensioner, who is sworn.] Rank and File. What is your service, corps, and pen sion ? Atkins. I served twenty-one years in the Rifles, and have eightpence a day pension. Rank and File. State your services. Atkins. I first served through the Scinde war with Sir C. Napier ; helped to win the Punjab ; was in every engagement in the Crimea ; helped to reconquer India from the mutineers ; was twenty- seven times engaged before Delhi, and fought for seven successive days afterwards in the streets, and was at the taking of Lucknow. I have six medals and six clasps, and was three times wounded. Rank and File. You know the witness who has just left the Court ; how is it that with your distinguished services you do not get so good a pension ? Atkins. The prisoner Bull altered the regulations during"], [38, "32 the long peace, and to get Horsman's pension I must have served eight years longer for it. Rank and File. And why did you not serve ? Atkins. The question scarcely needs an answer. Would it be possible for one man in one hundred to go through my campaigns and be able to serve eight years after his twenty one years' service ? Rank and File. Why did you not take advantage of the Good Conduct Regulations ? Atkins. An angel might, and some men do, apparently, comply with its conditions ; but I could not. Rank and File. You would certainly have a good character written on the face of your discharge ? Atkins. I am sorry to say I had not. A sentimental Colonel commanded when I was discharged, who wrote on my parchment certificate, Appears ten times in the Defaulters' Book. I had a good one from my Captain, who knew me well. Rank and File. What were your offences ? Atkins. 0, always the same, getting a little merry \u2014 four times was after I came home from. India, just before I was discharged. Rank and File. Had you any extra pay for length of service or for distinguished conduct ? Atkins. No. Rank and File. Are there any limited service men now ? Atkins. All are now limited to ten years, but may re engage for nineteen years. Rank and File. Would extra pay as formerly be an induce ment to men to re-engage, and would it be an advantage to the country in a military point of view ? Atkins. It would be a great inducement, and one skilled man, with practised hand and eye to use his rifle, is worth ten recruits, and the Prisoner will find that out some day ; in fact, he is now obliged to reduce the standard to get men enough. [Exit."], [39, "33 [Enter William Shiftt, Pensioner, who is sworn.] Rank and File. What corps, service, and pension ? Shifty. I served twenty-one years in the 19th and have one shilling a-day. Rank and File. You know the last witness, Thomas Atkins ; how is it that you with the same service get fourpence a day more pension ? Shifty. I get it as a reward for good conduct. Rank and File. Gallant conduct in the field, I suppose ? Shifty. O dear no \u2014 we don't get extra pay and pension for that ; we are taught to believe that any fool can be brave, and fight. Rank and File. What then ? Shifty. For keeping out of the Defaulters' Book, and it takes the sharpest fellows in the Service to do that. Rank and File. And very good moral men too ? Shifty. Not at all \u2014 wo may break all the Commandments, except murder, so long as we keep out of the Book. Rank and File. Did you ever see a shot fired ? Shifty. No, I was always on home duty or in the Medi terranean. I was mess waiter for fifteen years, so I could always get my sprees over after hours. Rank and File. What will you receive in pay and pension more than Thomas Atkins, who has seen so much honourable service, supposing you both live twenty-four years after you are discharged ? Shifty. About two hundred and three pounds. Rank and File. And this for merely keeping clear of the Defaulters' Book ? Shifty. Yes. Rank and File. And do you think you deserve it ? Shifty. In honest truth, no, although my betters tried for twenty-one years to make me believe so. Rank and File. Did you ever know a duty man get the shilling at twenty-one years ? c"], [40, "34 Shifty. Yes, one ; and several bandsmen and working men, who are not so strictly watched. [Enter John Hawk, Eecruiting Sergeant \u2014 Sworn.] Rank and File. As a recruiting sergeant do you consider that the present low rate of pension affects the recruiting ? Hawk. Yes, most injuriously. Formerly a comfortably-to do pensioner was the best of advertisements, whereas now the young fellows point at the pensioners and gibingly say \u2014 \" And be turned off like him when we are old.\" [Exit. [Enter LordBROADLANDS, Chamberlain-in-Chief to thePrisoner \u2014 Sworn.] Rank and File. Your Lordship Is the Prisoner's Chamberlain-in-Chief, Also his Mentor and paid Remembrancer ? Lord Broad. I am. Rank and File. Be pleased to state the facts within your Bearing upon the charges. [knowledge, Lord Broad. I knew the Prisoner well ere he took up With such bad company ; and tried, but vain, To ward their fell contaminations ; But being of a jovial temperament, He issued invitations to his feast, When they, as herds of rude Republicans, Shouldered themselves into the upper seats, And then, with subtle speech, and taunts, and threats, So undermined his better inclinations As to induce him to adopt their creed, And, ultimately, take the high priest's office. Most strenuously, too, I did oppose That base economy which mocks at justice ; Which then I designated as rank robbery. Deprive the Soldier of his extra pay ! Reduce the Army's pension by a third ! The Soldier's England's diplomatic seal,"], [41, "35 Rank Lord That stamps her treaties, forces on her trade, And holds it with the vigour of his sword. He made the proud Celestials tremble And open up their Commerce to us ; He gave those princely jewels to the crown, The great Five Rivers and the land of Scinde ; 'Twas he reset the Ganges' golden stream To Britain's shore. Had this been lost One half the revenue had been lost too, And lost the prestige of the British name. There's not a servant in the Prisoner's household, From myself downwards, who is so devoted, Or so ill-paid : it is the one dark spot That dims the lustre of the Pris'ner's scutcheon, Made blacker by its foul inscription, Cheap Soldiers' blood. And so debased is Mr Bull become, I've seen his deep eye sparkle with delight, His round red face glow with a brighter smile, As at his festive board he'd give the health Of those brave men ; and ere the cheer had ceased Show to the Chancellor of his Exchequer The groat abstracted from the veteran's pension. and File. Had you not influence Sufficient to outweigh the sordid counsel Of his Chancellor ; you, who for fifty years, Midst changing scenes, and times, and party strifes. Have held your cushion at his council board, And had his private ear ? Broad. Most faithful have I been in my advice, As one by one I've seen his virtues sink ; Each manly passion, love of glory, fame, And with them, his own self-respect, go down Deep in the stagnant pool of Love of Gain ; His heart, now hardened as its icy top, Grows dense and denser with the frost of age,"], [42, "36 Sealing within its core all latent good, And baring all external influences. Had not the wickedness of Israel's king Provoked God's special message of rebuke, I feel persuaded that he would have sent His prophet to the Prisoner. The guilty king Had the excuse \u2014 if sin can plead excuse \u2014 Of lusty manhood and of love. He [Pointing to the Prisoner. had none, For his dry bones are passionless and cold, And nought is done without deliberation ; Without the question asked : Will this thing pay ? Will it, when done, replenish the exchequer, Though we should rob the poorest poor to do it ? David repented of his sin ; but he Exults and glories in his infamy. [Exit. [Enter the Bight Hon. W. Happystone, Chancellor of the Prisoner's Exchequer \u2014 Sworn.] Rank and File. I beg to acquaint the Court that this is a most unwilling witness, one who has subscribed to the Trader's creed ; I shall, therefore, have to subject him to a catechetical examination. (To the Witness.) You are Chancellor of the Prisoner's exchequer? Happystone. I am. Rank and File. He implicitly follows your advice in finan cial matters ? Happystone. He does. Rank and File. Are you aware that the Soldier's pension, for length of service, has been reduced ? Happystone. Yes. Rank and File. And why ? Happystone. It is the progress of the age to pay as little for, and to get as much out of, anything as we can."], [43, "37 Rank and File. Has your own salary or pension been reduced ? Happystone. Certainly not, nor any of the upper servants in Mr Bull's household. Rank and File. State to the Court the amount of the Prisoner's Capital sunk in Railways and other internal traffic, what is annually paid in wages, and his annual Foreign Commerce. Happystone. There are four hundred millions sunk in Rail ways and other internal traffic, one hundred and fifty millions paid in wages, and the Foreign Commerce is three hundred millions. Rank and File. Is that more than it was sixty years ago, when the Shilling-a-day was first granted to the Soldier ? Happystone. Itris about four times greater. Rank and File. Then it is the progress of the age, that, ac cording to the increase of the Prisoner's riches, so is to be the reduction of his servants' wages ? Happystone. The lower servants certainly. Rank and File. Supposing the oldrate of pension restored, what amount would it take annually ? Happystone. About one-tenth of a penny of the Income- tax. Rank and File. Are you aware that under certain condi tions a man may obtain a shilling at twenty-one years ? Happystone. Yes ; and more do obtain it than was ever expected. Rank and File. You infer that the good-conduct code was clogged with such conditions that it was intended the men should not be able to fulfil them. Happystone. Yes, this we knew ; and we knew also that by making the extra pension depend on the fulfilment of those conditions, that we should save both pay and pension, which to Mr Bull is a consideration. We also knew that no man was fit for active duty after twenty-one years' service ; so we made it imperative that if he asked for his discharge then \u2014 and we"], [44, "38 would not give it to him otherwise \u2014 that he should only get eightpence. Rank and File. The good-conduct pay, and the extra pension to good-conduct men, you pay out of the extra pay for length of service and the pension stopped from the Army in the aggregate ? Happystone. Certainly, but there is a very large surplus. Rank and File. To what purpose has this been applied ? Happystone. To pay for extras for the poor convicts, and to make them comfortable. Rank and File. In a public discussion on the Prisoner's affairs, you stated, a short time ago, that an income of two hundred pounds now would not go so far as it did formerly ; how do you arrive at this conclusion ? Happystone. By the price of labour ; a man who used to get only seven shillings a-week is now getting ten. Rank and File. Then the Pensioner who formerly got one shilling a day, or seven shillings a week, should now get ten to be in the same position ? Happystone. Most certainly. Rank and File. Then, taking into consideration the differ ence in the value of money, the present pension, instead of being reduced one-third, is reduced more than one-half, when compared with the old, the Soldier getting not more than fivepence-halfpenny per day. Happystone. That is about the sum, though I think some thing over-estimated \u2014 it is nearer fivepence. [Exit. (The Court adjourns for half-an-hour.

Enter Members, Prisoner, Guard, &c] [Enter Adjutant Drill\u2014 Sworn.] Rank and File. As you have had a large experience In administering the moral code, Be pleased to state to the Court, its workings, History, and influences. Adj. Drill. The Code was framed as an experiment ; However, so the Army were advised. But as it took full one-and-twenty years To prove its working, the experiment Fell to be the system : nor did it want The eye of Wisdom to perceive the juggle. The offer of two cuckoos in the bush For one already held within the hand ! The larger sum, like fabled bird of old, Is ever flitting in the Soldier's view ; And when she's grasped (and many clutch her wing) A sword suspended \u2014 this for ever feared \u2014 Falls and severs the possession. Then off This bird of hope will flit again ; Again she's caught, again the sword will fall, Until at last she flies away for ever. When Wisdom framed this Code of Equity She must have decked herself with cap and bell, For can it be conceived, two thousand Judges, In a community of two hundred thousand, Will mete out justice with an even hand When it depends upon caprice and whim ? Two hundred of these judges daily sit, And try offences similar, exact ; And yet so varied are they in their judgments, The punishments awarded so opposed, That, for the same offence, a young Sub's fiat Will carry with it loss of pay and pension, While the Commander would admonish only."], [47, "41 j 7 The crying evil of the Code is this, It educates the Soldier to believe That cunning is a virtue, nobler far Than that of daring Courage. Now, Courage Of all the Soldier's virtues stands the chief; Yet in the rear rank is she rudely thrust, Shut out, derided, mocked, and held in scorn By those who buy up mock-morality ; Because she's rough-hewn, open to the view, Stands forth with bearing that is bold, is frank, And proudly asks men to investigate And prove ere she'll accept the meed of praise So highly prized \u2014 the highest, chiefest prize \u2014 The praise of valiant men. Again, the unlettered man is called upon, Whose education tells him not to think, Who's not to know if his old shoe be done, Or whether it will stand another patch ; Whose daily wants are rigidly supplied ; Whose life is ever ready in his hand \u2014 To ponder midst temptations and reflect. Reflect ! while from to-morrow's bloody strife He flings up pension as he yields his life. Rank and File. Then, Mr Adjutant, You do not look on the Defaulters' Book As a correct record by which to judge The Soldier's character ? Adj. Drill. 'Tis but a damning record, dark, unnatural Perpetuation of a loathing slander ; The mint and cummin of the devil's tithe, Paraded as the chiefest of his dues. The blast of character and fair repute ; The blight of shame ; the canker worm of truth Vindictive, persecuting, unforgiving, Wrong-doing, monstrous, most implacable ; Want's register \u2014 the withered hag ! that she"], [48, "42 May'know her sons, and dog their steps through life, And as they reel beneath her icy clutch May whisper, taunting, in their aged ear, I am your country's gratitude. Could hell devise a test more villanous For moral worth \u2014 a test by implication, When all within may be rank rottenness, Debaucheries, impurities, and blasphemies, Lyings, and murmurings, and discontent. These not in secret, but in open day, Bold, unblushing, boastful said and done. Weeds are they, watered by the devil's pence, To crop upon the Soldier's arm* in flowers And cover in the man's defilements. Rank and File. What record would you keep, then, of offences ? Adj. Drill. The same; But only as an aid to discipline, Which, as a parent over wayward sons, Should hold a tempered rod ; else she's a tyrant Only to be hated. In barb'rous countries Punishment is commuted by a fine. It is for this enlightened land alone To bind them indissolubly together With a Satanic cruelty refined, That even at his three score years and ten The Soldier's made to feel his youthful slips; The thoughtless act, the hasty word, or some Neglected duty ; so trifling as to be Unnoticed by the Great Remembrancer ; So trifling, that a maiden need not blush To do one half of them. No wonder, then, As mem'ry 's dimmed with the eclipse of age, * Perhaps it is necessary to inform the non-military reader that the Soldier wears a mark on his arm for each penny of good-conduct pay which he receives."], [49, "43 That flashing thoughts should tinge the pallid cheek, And flush the brow, and kindle up the eye, As the curled lip will utter forth its curse : 'Tis said, and all again is vacancy ; And when a total darkness comes upon her, And all the man sleeps in unconsciousness, When life is wavering on this nether shore, The lip's last effort is to breathe a curse, To shake the dust from off the spirit's wing. Should such things be ? for they have many virtues. I've lived with them in close companionship; I've trained the young ; the wayward have restrained ; Watched over, guided, warned and counsel'd all ; Shared in their sorrows, mingled in their mirth, And had their inmost hearts laid bare before me ; So that I know the riches of their nature. There is in them a mine of patriotism, Unflinching courage and untamed endurance, Loyalty, obedience, and devotion. They snuff the battle as a conqueror, Hoping in life, but if in death they reek not. They cheer the battle-eve with songs of love Of England's hearths : her liberty and glory. And they are capable of friendship, true And lasting, showing there's nobleness within them. Not that they all alike possess these gifts, As they're bestowed on no two men the same ; And if bestowed, not always to be seen By him who knows them not as comrades. Their faults I shall not name, for they are human And shall not human nature, then, forgive ? Will not their fiery natures sometimes stray ?

Who bears in his right hand a He Shall never reach nobility Though he possess the subtlest tongue That Senate heard or Senate stung ; Or loudest on the platform brayed Against the plough or for the spade."], [54, "48 Who stirs the passions of the poor Shall find them rapping his own door, And open with a giant hand Ere they will delve a rood of land. Read, mark, and learn for thine own self The ills that follow love of pelf ; From thence oppressions take their wing, From thence what callous thoughts will spring Injustice with an air of ruth Precedence claims of Holy Truth ; And acts the hypocrite that she May preach of generosity. From out the love of gain there flows A disregard for human woes ; The finer feelings deadened lie Till gratitude's an infamy, Except those gibing votes and cheers That's thundered in the soldiers' ears. Are riches still your chiefest cares ? O weight them not with human tears, Nor let one dewy lid proclaim The Veteran's woe, your greatest shame. March 1864.
