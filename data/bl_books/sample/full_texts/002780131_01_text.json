The aim and object of this work, written and published for an evident purpose, patent through its pages, are, viz.\u2014 The excision of influentially concealed wrong, the exposure of social degeneracy and error, the uprooting of legalised greed and delinquency, the elimination and vanquishment of leech-like and parasitical adherences from the Body Politic \u2014 our midst, and the timely and needed creation of a broachless and incorruptible basis whereon and wherefrom to entrace and raise a superstructure of universal and deep-rooted liberty, purity, and justice. Needless prejudice may urge, bigotry may sneer, but impartiality and foresight the reverse, and within the measure and purpose of unbiased and well-directed effort, and the folds of a not remote suture.
