CAEN. Caen, 5 Mai, 16S9.\u2014 \" Ce pays est tres-beau, et Caen la plus jolie ville, la plus avenante, la plus gaie, la mieux situee, les plus belles rues, les plus beaux batiments, les plus belles eglises, des prairies, des promenades, et entin, la source de tous nos plus beaux esprits.\" \u2014 \"Lettres a sa fllle,\" Madame de Sevigny.

It is indeed very fair to behold. The outline, viewed from a short distance, is most prepossessing. At one point (the Moulin du Eoi) we are told \" upwards of 16 spires or towers rise from the dense accumulation of roofs.\" Also, after quitting the Railway Station, in the direction of Bayeux, an exquisite prospect greets the admiring eye, with, as fore-"], [13, "Normandy. 3 ground, a campagna of rich green, the Prairie de Caen, beyond which rises a magnificent panorama of churches, towers and white buildings, backed by a contour, in wavy line, of hills. Caen is the place, par excellence, for the arch\u00e6ologist and the architect to revel in. At the same time, wherever you are located, it affords a most desirable facility for gaining prompt access to the open country. What Madame de Sevigny wrote two centuries ago holds good now. Caen is cheerful in itself, enjoys an immunity from fog, the houses of white stone, the spacious boulevards and squares, where Flora holds her own, enhance the enjoy ment of a sojourn. Shady walks abound by canal or river, and under fine avenues of lime, elm and plane trees, such as the Cours Circulaires, Cours Sadi Carnot (planted 1676); the Grand Cour (1691) is a splendid avenue, extending about a mile. In the Jardin des Plantes hours may be passed delight fully, affording from the high ground a wide view of the town and neighbourhood. Not to dwell upon the usual attractions of these botanical recreation grounds, one modest little flower charmed us by its abundance ; under a clump of trees the ground was carpeted with a small species of Cyclamen, having the flesh coloured tints of the C. heder\u0153 folium, and, like it, with some specimens quite white ; a pendant to the attractive Wood Anemone, A. nemorosa, the Fiore Stella of the Italians, which, in spring, covers many a copse with its elegant white flowers. \" Dyed in winter's snow and rime, Constant to their early time, White the leaf-strewn ground again And make each wood a garden glen Clare.

Saint Etienne, or Abbaye aux Hommes, dedicated to St. Stephen. \u2014 Founded about 1064 ; commenced about 1066 by Lanfranc, four years before he became Archbishop of Canterbury ; consecrated 1077, and ten years later its founder was there interred. But little remains of the original edifice or records in stone; the reprisals of religious intoler ance and political malignity (as in so many cases) have wreaked their vengeance within the Sanctuary, neither party respecting the grave of the founder, whose exceptional ability had made him such a prominent character in the world's history, for, in 1562, the monument erected to his memory by William Rufus was destroyed, the greater part of the nave was overthrown, the Conqueror's grave broken open and the bones dispersed, and the sepulchre was again disturbed during the Revolution.

The interior, with its noble circular arches and fine gallery, presents a coup d'\u0153il of severe grandeur. Between 1609 and 1626 the nave was restored with much care and reverence for its original construction, in all the details, by a worthy prior, Jean de Baillebache. Infinite variety in the carving of the choir stalls merits attention. The sacristy, a chapel in the choir (13th century) contains pictures attributed to great masters, but of little value, a very old copy of the Conqueror's portrait, and opposite it, figurez-vous, an electric switch and globes. What a source of serene rest it is to leave the busy outside throng and to enter a roomy, lofty temple, raised by pious impulse and deft craftsmen for the service of God ; to study the disposition of space, the spring of the arch, the general plan, the cunning detail, the light, softened by rich vitreous colours. It gladdens the heart to witness the rapt reverence and attention, usual in Continental churches ; it gladdens the heart also, when there are but a few detached beings at Orisons and solemn silence reigns supreme : \" Cet orgue qui se tait, ce silence pieux, L'invisible union de la terre et des deux.\" M. de Fontaine. Pictures in churches are often far from pleasing, especially the legend of the \" Stations of the Cross,\" the number of which has grown from seven in the 15th century to fourteen. As Mrs. Jameson remarks: \u2014 \"The reader has had too much of this wretched phase of a beautiful subject,\" and again, \" there are no objects which the eye shuns more instinctively than this never-failing series in the nave of a Roman Catholic Church.\" With this exception, the oil paintings in St. Etienne are telling and tender, not as works of art, but as \" object lessons.\" To take an average selection"], [16, "Normandy. 6 out of ten good examples, depicting scenes in the life of our Saviour: \u2014 The Mother of Christ finding Him in the Temple \" sitting in the midst of the Doctors, both hearing them and asking them questions \" ; The raising of the son of the widovv of Nain ; Jesus Christ and the woman of Samaria at the well; Jesus known to the two disciples by the breaking of bread ; all treated in such a simple natural way that, if carefully pointed out to any intelligent child, the facts would become riveted in the memory.

Before wending our way to the twin abbey and what lies between, let us deviate in an opposite direction and visit an Institution which afforded us more pleasure than any thing else in Caen, L'Hopital du Bon Sauveur. More than thirty years ago, on the top of the Arc de Triomphe, Paris, in company with my late beloved wife, a kindly disposed stranger directed our attention to distant objects ; then, pointing to a building comparatively near, said, \"An exposition is open there and well worth seeing.\" The cue was taken,"], [17, "Normandy. 7 but it is not the easiest thing in the world to \"start fair\" when all the avenues and streets radiate from your centre of vision : go to the left of a corner house instead of to the right and each step increases your angle of divergence ; however, the supposed distance having been accomplished, we observed a palatial building, standing back from the road, with statuary within a row of windows ; a ring at the bell of the porte-cochh-e was answered by a very tall, handsome young man in bright livery, behind his comely shoulders a large court and the mansion of his Grace the Duke of Brunswick ; explanations and apologies followed and then we beat a retreat, flags lowered. Well, the quiet-looking entrance in the Rue Caponniere to the Bon Sauveur had the appearance, simply, of the closed porte-cochire of a continental nobleman's town residence, hence inquiries were made before venturing to utilise the knocker ; having been admitted, after expressing our wishes, we were taken across the main court into a scrupulously clean waiting room or parlour, in which hung a choice engraving of \" La Madonna della Sedia-\" \"Cleanliness is next to Godliness\" \u2014 and every thing here and elsewhere, as regards the Sisterhood aud organisation, attests both these divine qualities. En attendant. In A.D. 1731 this Institution \u2014 a town within a town, with a superficial area of 42 acres (17 hectometres), now consisting of 2000 souls \u2014 was founded by Anne Leroi, in the Rue du Four, Faubourg de Vaucelles, and known as the \" Little Convent.\" In the course of six years the Sisterhood moved to the Rue d'Ange de Sainte Paix. In 1789 the society was suppressed by one of those revolutionary decrees of terrible memory. Out of the twenty- three Religieuses, thus dispersed, seven perished in the then existing horrible state of misrule and misery. In 1804, the times being more peaceful, the S\u0153urs re -assembled, the order was enabled to purchase, as part of their present position, the site of a Capuchin Monastery, of"], [18, "Norma ndy. 8 which the Chapel (1635\u2014 enlarged 1870), cloisters and a cistern remain, the fifteen acres, which had belonged to the Friars, offering a favourable opportunity for their project, and wealthy families, recovering their possessions, helped liberally from extended resources. So, in the course of a few years, the influence of the Sisters increased, and they were able to formulate a definite, extensive and we'll conceived form of action (A.D. 1818). Imagine, in the centre of distributed operations, a goodly balm-yielding tree for suffering humanity, sending out in different directions six vigorous branches. 1. An Asylum* for the Insane of the Department of Calvados, male and female, with superior accommodation and accessories for patients with sufficient means at disposal. 2. An Infirmary and Dispensary for cases of sickness and accident, with supply of nurses for patients at home as well as within the wards. 3. An Educational and Industrial School with workshops for various crafts, for the youthful Deaf and Dumb of both sexes, lip language being successfully taught by the patient, painstaking S\u0153urs. It is also a free retreat for those of them who desire to remain after their education is finished. 4. A Girls' School for gratuitous instruction to children whose artisan parents are in needy circumstances. George Bryan (Beau) Brummel, once British Consul at Caen, when broken down, fortune forsaken, demented, was placed here by friends, a.d. 1838, and remained, in comfortable quarters, an inmate of the Asylum until his death, 30th March, 1810. He was usually cheerful and ate well, and probably these were, compara- tively, happy days in his singular life, as, in return for the soothing loving-kindness he received, the noble unremitting attention to the ills of the body, and anticipation of the humours of a wandering mind, his conduct gained from his nurse the appellation of \" Un bon enfant\"; a strange summing up of the \"Beau's\" character to English ears."], [19, "Normandy. 9 5. Another School for young girls of position, where, upon an annual payment to the Hospital funds, they receive a thoroughly good secular and religious education. 6. A Home for life, or any part of it, for ladies of rank, at their own cost, who desire the peaceful retirement, shelter and security thus afforded. But now a rather elderly sister of inviting aspect, with black dress, which covers the hair above, looped up train and silver crucifix, makes us a sign to follow her and we joined a party of French visitors. The good, kind sister was so anxious that we should lose nothing of her explanations, that she insisted upon having my sister constantly by her side, frequently taking her hand and caressingly cautioning her when steps or any difficulty appeared.

Midst such cheering, sweet, beautiful flowers and foliage it is difficult to conceive the suffering that touches your very elbow. The unfortunate inmates are wisely shielded from public curiousity, but the extensive gardens appropriated to mental patients, who can afford to pay for their reception, are in admirable order and replete with all that is choice in tree, shrub and flower. Amongst other special grounds a nice garden is assigned also to the young girls being educated, on terms of payment.

An Oratoire, dedicated to the memory of the \" Abbe Pierre Jamet,\" contains a full length figure, in ecclesiastical vestments, exquisitely chiselled, of one who promoted, from the horrible days of the last decade of the preceding century to his death, in 1845, the weal of the order, zealously and without abatement. Cemetery. \" Now the labourer's task is o'er Now the battle day is past.\" Here rest in peace the worthy ashes of the departed S\u0153ttrs. The vows are terminable or renewable in three years, but they are too earnest in this work of love to leave it willingly, many of whom have devoted their fortunes and others their full rentes to benefit this charity. Poultry yards, farm buildings and stables next occu pied our attention. Several carriages and horses are provided that the Sisters and upper class patients may have due airings and rambles. Here as fine a lot of cows as one could wish to see were walking home, most sedately, from the pasture land \" with the quiet that distinguishes well bred cattle,\" each to her particular stall. We were shown the ample arrangements, conveniences and drying rooms of the big laundry department ; the linen is dried by cold air passing through louvre-boaided windows. Walking along a corridor 1 counted forty chests of soap, each containing about a cwt. A most commodious kitchen with handy contrivances followed. In one corner a Cafetiere, like the boiler of a rather small locomotive, supplied with a gauge, stood on end; the employed inmates, who have done their work satisfactorily, receive an extra cup of coffee with a little something in it, which they highly appreciate.

To each Sister is seemingly assigned a special sphere of surveillance or duty, and love keeps the whole machinery in smooth working order ; thus, the key having been obtained from another rcligieuse, we were taken into the cider cellar, where two immense casks, equal in size, occupied the space. Upon the ends, if turned up, children might \" trip it,\" or execute a measure \" on the light fantastic toe,\" minding not to tip over, as a fall of, to say at a guess, 15 feet might be hazardous. Termination of Visit. \u2014 \" N'oublies pas nos pauvres, S. v. p,\" and, with regret, we bade adieu to our most courteous and attentive guide and the amiable Sisters in and about the Bureau.

Close by (Rue de Caumont) is the Eglise St. Etienne le Vieux, a misnomer, being pointed Gothic of the 15th century, now used as a municipal storehouse and about to become a museum, containing, already, classified fragments of architecture from the 11th to the 16th century in great number, a study of the architectural decoration of Normandy. There are many fine points about this church, especially an elegant octagonal tower ; a statue, placed outside the building, of William the Conqueror, was destroyed in troublous times. Onward through the Place Malh^rbe, called after the distinguished native, Francois de Malherbe (1555-1628), into the Rue St. Pierre, on your left in passing Rue Froide is seen to perfection the beautiful apse (1546) of the Eglise St. Sauveur."], [25, "Normandy. 15 Cour de la Monnaie.\u2014 I After a few paces, on the same side, enter the Cour de la Monnaie, announced by a white oval plate over a narrow doorway, and pass on until you reach the Hotel de la Monnaie, an enchanting, elegant structure (16th century), specially two turrets ; one round, on a corbel, projecting from a circular tower ; the other, also on a corbel, square, or nearly so, in shape, more ornamental, is decorated (above arched windows) with medallions, the circular head being sur mounted by a graceful little lantern, terminated by a statue, in proportion ; between two windows, flanked by these turrets, a slab commemorates the a 2)uval &e /iDon&ralnpille, ne a Caen en 1507, mort en 1578. 31 consacra une immense fortune, bonorablcmcnt acquise par le Commerce avec les oeuj .fliionoes, a soutenir contre I'etranger Ic \u00a9ouvcrneinent 5c son pass : a soulager ses compatriotes, Cans les temps Oifltciles ; a encourager Dans son ville natale ['Industrie, les lettres ct les arts. attributes of Etienne Duval was constructed. de Mondrainville, by whom it Old Houses. \u2014 Still on the left side, adjoining the Cafe du Grand Balcon, are two exceptionally grand specimens of 15th century street architecture, 54 and 52 Rue St. Pierre, with elaborate wood carving, in varied form, on the premier and two upper stages.

After the battle of Agincourt, Henry V., en maitre, sequestrated the quarries to raise royal edifices in Normandy and Brittany, so the much to be pitied inhabitants had no other resource save to use the more perishable and quickly adapted material. (See Musgrave's \" Ramble through Normandy,\" ch. xiii.) L'Eglise de Saint Pierre is reached after this luxe de richesses. Normandy, so noted for its cathedrals and churches, may boast of St. Pierre, Caen, as one of its most brilliant productions. Well might Pugin make tours with his pupils, to instruct them by means of these chef cl'\u0153uvres of the Department of Calvados. The tower and spire are early 14th century, nave and choir 14th and 15th centuries, apse and adjoining chapels 16th century. This church points heavenward to the height of 242 feet. But why attempt to speak of its tower, its lancet windows, framed by delicate reeded mouldings, of those wondrous columns, at once so seemingly attenuated, yet so strong, surmounted by an open faced slender parapet, inclosing eight clustering bell-turrets, with tall shafts, between which the light freely passes, imparting such a fairy-like, classical and airy effect ? From the centre a beautiful octagonal spire rises 90 feet high, a clear space from standpoint to apex, through which the light pierces abundantly to within 25 feet or thereabouts of the top by means, on all sides, of itoiles a jour \u2014 one might call them, from the increased number of divisions, compound epuatrefoils. The masonry of this excellent work is said not to exceed five inches in thickness. The stones of St. Pierre appeal to the eye and sense of elegance far more eloquently than can be conveyed by any words. The same majestic grandeur pervades the interior of the nave, roof and choir"], [27, "Normandy. 17 As Beatrice Harraden asks, \" When you go into a beautiful cathedral and look around, do you not wonder at the patient and loving labour of those men of old, who knew how to rear a noble building to the honour of God, giving the best of their work, the best of their energy and the best of their lives?\" The apse is esteemed as being in the most advanced artistic style of the French revival period ; in it there is a splendid representation of the angel appearing to Peter in prison, when sleeping between the soldiers \u2014 otherwise the church contains but little coloured glass. Old engravings represent the foundations of the apse as abutting the water, which is certainly there, covered over, as in several other places at Caen. Again and again this fascinating and magnificent edifice commands admiration and attention : a most prominent object, you cannot get away from it, and would not if you could ; on arriving, the first to arrest the eye, departing, the last on which it fondly lingers. In the Place St. Pierre a doorway leads to the Hotel de Valois d'Ecoville (built in 1538 by Nicolas de Valois, Lord of Ecoville), now serving as Bourse and Tribunal de Commerce, in which the fine windows, sculptures, &c, were almost hidden by scaffolding. On the lower part, between columns supporting further sculpture and window, are statues of David holding the head of Goliah, and Judith that of Holofernes. Le Chateau. \u2014 Above La Place St. Pierre the castle, founded by William the Conqueror, dominates the town. The fortifications were increased by Henry I. of England ; reconstruction took place under Louis XII., Francois I., and more recently. It is now used as a barracks, and not open to the public; therefore by Mont Poissonnerie and Rue des Chanoines, L'Eglise de la Trinite, or Abbaye aux Dames, is reached. L'Abbaye aux Dames is altogether less severe and massive and more ornate than L'Abbaye aux Hommes, for,"], [28, "Normandy. 18 though founded by Matilda about the same time, it was finished at a later date. Contrary to the prevailing^ custom as regards continental churches, L'Eglise de la Trinite admits only from 12 to 2 p.m., except on Sundays, when it is open all day. The abbey was restored after 1854; except the columns, all the nave is of the 12th century. West facade. The central doorway has been completely restored, but the bas-relief of \" The Trinity \" is modern ; the flanking towers were formerly surmounted by pyramids, similar to those of Saint Etienne, removed, it is said, by Du Guesclin for stategic reasons. These towers, partly re-built, are nearly a reproduction of their original con struction. The interior displays grand Norman characteristics in a conspicuous manner, but the effect is marred by a partition separating the choir and transept (reserved for the sisters of the Hotel-Dieu) from the west end ; therefore, to see more of this celebrated ecclesiastical structure, permission must be obtained at the entrance to the hospital. Here we were received most courteously by a reliyiev.se with the kindest, sweetest face possible to imagine, and hoped for her guidance, but were delegated to the care of a subordinate. You are shown a handsome chapel of the 13th century, and, under the choir, a very fine crypt (the roof being supported by thirty-six columns) which contains the bones of former abbesses. Matilda's tomb, restored in 1819, is placed in the middle of the choir, to which visitors are not admitted, but are allowed to see it from the adjoining chapel, a curtain being held aside for that purpose. The Hotel-Dieu, founded by Henry I. of England, was taken down in this century and its operations transferred to buildings in the above abbey, which were reconstructed 1704 to 1726.

By the \"irony of fate,\" when Bayeux was taken, a.d. 1106, its cathedral was burnt by his son, Henry I. The architecture is of very varied periods ; to avoid detail, the central nave of the interior has all the character of the finest Norman work, perfectly restored at a recent date,* with exquisite ornamental mouldings of the well defined forms of that period, showing the restorer's hand only in its fresh appearance and freedom from gap or injury: a treat to behold! The sublimity of the sine Norman arches is aggrandised by a trefoiled arcade and very lofty clerestory. This nave alone is worth time and trouble to visit. The arches are pointed of the choir, which contains palatial oak stalls in great number. The stained glass is bound to command inspection : it needs no word to draw attention to the superb rose and other windows.

A dame opposite thus intimated their disappearance to the conveyer. \" Ces anglais sont descendus, je ne sais pas pourquoi ! \" In no case was it the words, but the way in which they were said. \"Le ton fait la musique:\" the tone was discordant and the music jarred. Yet this feeling, especially in Calvados, is small wonder ; it is a vestige of the old mistrust, a relic of past feuds, extending over cen turies, and felt especially on this coast line, for \u2014 though their \" Guillaume \" and his followers scored high in our lands once for all, and by their presence made it very inconvenient and disagreeable to the old island chiefs for some generations \u2014 in \" La Belle France,\" in vary many localities, at various times, the English, with all the horrors of war, left fearful signs of devastation. One solitary instance : record tells us that Caen (taken byr Edward III. in 1346), a town of riches and noble citizens, was given over to plunder, and the English fleet returned home laden with its spoils (Froissart). Your shrewd Norman will surely find the \"sunny side\" of the hedge in business, but he is good and true at the core and recognises the like in others. Providentially this dislike is against les anglais, and individuals may always exempt them selves and receive an instant, kindly response to the merest pleasant word, attention or thought regarding the comfort or due respect that one nationality, one member of the human family, owes to another, when the \" perfide Albion \" ex pression falls from the face as though by magic.

Villers-sur-Mer. Being geologically inclined, we visited this seaside resort, one of a series of attractive bathing stations, beginning with Trouville, distant about four miles. In this clayey series there was no lack of fossils, such as species of Triyonia, Gryph\u0153a, Ammonite, Cidaris spines, Ostrea, Gervillia, but we were not rewarded with a lucky find, more than two or three hours being required for diligent and extended search ; someone was needed to give one \" the tip.\" To a fisherman and to a collector of shells the very word fossilcs was incom prehensible ; these vestiges of former ages were simply \u2014 pierres. There are interesting places in the locality : Dives, Houlgate, Beuzeval, Luc-sur-Mer and Lion-sur-Mer. A young lady produced good specimens of Rhynchonella and Terebratula, &c, just picked up at the latter place. What comes hither over the brow of that rising ground ? An escape from a French zoo ? They might belong to a flock of ostriches, judging by the peculiar feathers of the wing, drooping over the upper joint of the tibia. Nearer and nearer \u2014 whatever do we see ? French lady cyclists, on foot and in costume ! I hope, for the credit of a nation so renowned for exalted taste, that this is not a fair sample. When mounted they sit badly, as do so many of our country men, who prefer \" scorching \" pace to both health and appearance. Thank goodness, our lady cyclists know the value of the latter, if, following the prevailing fashion, they"], [37, "Normandy. 27 sometimes neglect the former; when on \"bike\" they hold themselves, usually, in an easy, upright position, work with the feet in a graceful manner, retain the modest demeanour of the sex, and (apart from the madcaps permeating every society) are very attentive to the safety of those on foot and to avoid casualties.

The Church (13th or 14th century), without transept or apse, has a choice rose window in the west front, above a rich porch on detached shafts. In each turret, at all the four angles of the building, is a flight of steps. The whole Abbey enclosure is now used as a farm, and the sacred edifice, alas ! is filled with farm produce, farm implements and the usual accompaniments of feathered farm life. Ouisterham. This port is reached quickly by rail-tram from the sluice, between the basin and the canal from Caen to the sea. Fine trees extend the whole distance on both sides of the water. It chanced to be the time of a Regatta, under the auspices of the Anti-Catholic party, whose leaders, finding"], [38, "28 Normandy. that the \" Circle-Catholique \" has a stronghold upon the people by its care of the poor, have introduced at their flourishes, such as this and balloon ascents, a system of collecting \"pottr les pauvrcs.\" The Church at Ouisterham deserves special attention, being very interesting and singular. The facade of the lofty tower bears the impress of four different orders, and the interior is impressively and severely grand. Le Grand Hotel de la Place Royale, Caen, has all the advantages a most agreeable situation can afford. Immediately in front, the large open space encloses the central music stand with surrounding trees, shrubs and well laid out parterres of La Place de la Republique (formerly Place Royale), acknowledged as the finest in the town. In it is a statue, in sitting posture, of the composer Auber, offert a la ville Caen par \" La Sociiti des beaux Arts.\" The hotel furnishes a liberal table for lunch and dinner, with free use of cider, vin ordinaire and eau de scltz. Charges moderate, service throughout marked by kind, attentive consideration ; society excellent, the effect of its well-merited reputation. It is conducted more after the good old Norman system than is customary on beaten tracks. The Temple of Cloacina is of French construction, leaving something to be desired for English votaries to the shrine of that goddess. Before quitting, with regret, these cheerful quarters, let us pass through the Place on the opposite side by a gateway of the Hotel de Ville into La Cour du Musee.

Orchards, not to be numbered, laden with the little red cider apple ; no wonder the product is so freely given at table d'hote. Malheureusement ! cider and I are not good friends ; my fault, no doubt, from some resemblance to a certain tenant farmer : The old lord had died, and his successor, thinking he would show how things were done elsewhere, introduced claret at the first rent-audit dinner. Observing, with pleasure, that one of his occupiers imbibed it freely, he said to him, \" You seem to take to the claret, Mr. So-and-So; how do you like it ? \" \" It tastes very well, my lord, but I don't seem to get no forrader.\" Gentlemen who patronise establishments where alcoholic beverage is not permitted at table, know the inconvenience of being deprived of a wash-doini suitable to their individual tastes, causing those who indulge in a little warm comfort, to or after a meal, to alter the shaving hour from early in the morning to later in the day. Apropos of this little ruse for obtaining hot water, a worthy Cure' objecting to take a special distillation with hot water on the ground of being a total abstainer, his medical attendant said, \" Unless you do, you'll not live long.\" \" How am I to manage it ? \" ejaculated the Curi, \" I should neither like my people nor my housekeeper to know it.\" \" Ring for shaving water ! \" Some time after, the doctor enquired after his patient.

The party in our compartment consisted of a venerable Cure, with marked bonhomie, a gentleman, his youthful son, and a passenger engaged in commerce. We fraternised at once, and the hours passed gleefully, for, if to their eyes \" heterodox,\" conversation, anecdote and mirth passed about, \" Ma foi, oui, And a pinch from the Cure's box.\" The \" Commercial \" told of the difficulty to obtain anything at some of the out-of-the-way places, and how he had been obliged, on one occasion, to return to a certain central town because he could not secure even a bed for the night. The Cure supplemented it by saying he had been tutor to the sons of a gentleman connected with railroad prospecting. After a long day with his charts and instruments, being very hungry and tired, he prevailed, with much ado, upon an old woman to make him some soupe, and what do you think"], [41, "Normandy. 31 that soupe contained? \"Rabbit\" was suggested! \"Mais non ! try again.\" \" Par ma foi, I should never be able to guess.\" \" Do you give it up ? \" \" Ah, oui ! \" (with a shake of the head). \"Eh bien, Done! une paire de lunettes.\" This was told with infinite humour, and the mention of a pair of spectacles evoked a \" side-splitter,\" in which the < 'uA's rotundity took part, and the snuff-box went again \" on circuit.\" As we neared our destination, our companions gradually disappeared, and, leaving the station, we ascended the plateau on which Avranches is placed byr a zig-zag road, after the manner of Switzerland, to locate ourselves in the comfortable and convenient Grand Hotel de France, there to make the acquaintance of the genial landlord and his capable consort. Monsieur Pineau never passed you as you sipped your coffee under the verandah without a sprightly word, ofttimes pre senting a beautiful rose to ladies, and now and then tempting fruit \u2014 peach, pear or plum \u2014 with a fine eye for the ripest, and a quiet indication as to your selection.

This superb situation, besides its glorious panorama from the old walls, has three special points of view, each guarded by a light iron fence, commanding not only, in fine perspec tive, the gigantic cone of Mont St. Michel, but the rarest views in the north of Fiance ; one by skirting the town walls (or by the public walk in the opposite direction through a former Bishopric Garden); the second from the beautiful"], [42, "Normandy. 32 Jardin des Plantes, in which one lingers with supreme delight. If the day be fine, look well round upon the magnificent and extensive horizon presented to view ; the long stretch of sand and water ; Mont St. Michel and its twin sister Tombelene ; the semi-circular coast line with Granville to the north ; to the South, Pontorson, at the mouth of the Couesnon ; further on Mont Dol : Cancale perched up, and its bay at its feet. Take in the inland view, the straight road, scattered villages, verdurous pasturage, broken by wooded lines, but not spoilt by exuberance of timber. Having feasted the eye with this perfect panorama, pass through an arch, the remains of an ecclesiastical construction, brought up here from its original site, its precarious tenure on the sands. Then walk round the garden and survey the superior floral attractions ; every plant seems to expand here with an exuberance and delightful growth beyond descrip tion: the agcratum (apparently the same species as grown elsewhere in the locality) is imposing and far above the usual height, with a luxuriance in keeping with its gay and thriving neighbours. The Parterres are well exposed to light and air, and yet protected by trees at a. respectful distance. The third view is from the edge of the bare, flat, large summit of the plateau, below which the town clusters. Make the most of the chance ; stereotype the outlines on your memory, the glimmering play of light and shadow. Then turn round and face the abandoned, forlorn spot, where pious feet were wont to tread; over which a dark cloud hangs and a chilly wind blows. Again and again our steps involuntarily turn to the Jardin des Plantes to drink in its ozone and inhale its perfumes, but one visit here suffices : that highly exhiliarating ; this wofully depressing; yet it marks the ground on which Avranches Cathedral stood in olden times, \" the finest Basilica possessed by France,\" (?) \" built in the eleventh century, destroyed at the Revolution,\" says Blackie; \"fell to pieces in 1790,\" says another\u2014 a very"], [43, "Normandy. 33 suspicious date ; much church property \" fell to pieces \" about that period in France. Now, in the centre of the Place, a few of its broken pieces and an epitaph mark the grave of a past power, like the monument of heroic actions, where only a long series of brave names round the obelisk and base record the event of a great decisive battle. Since we cannot accept certain Roman Catholic dogmas, some may say \" Better as it is,\" but where is there an unblemished cult ? A multitude of expounders of Canonical faith, a host of Sisters of Charity even now soar very near heaven, attaining that altitude because innate, abiding love of God and of fellow-man in their hearts lightens the weight of their creeds. We must remember it is a perpetual war of Church against Materialism \u2014 Religion against Infidelity. Onlyr look round and see the effect of pious deeds, pious training. Well is it for France that this section is a power; terrible indeed would it be otherwise. Would yrou picture to yourself how this desolate spot once appeared, when dominated, as it should be, by the noble structure destroyed last century ? Go to the Musdc, there you will find a model and also a painting of the Cathedral, inscribed \u2014 Avranches en 1649, peint par Papillon, donne par Mr. le Sauvage.

Upon the recommendation of a very ignorant and incompetent person as to the insecurity of one of these towers, the churchwardens took upon them selves to have it removed. This was accomplished with much difficulty, it had been so well constructed. A genera tion later the Bishop of the diocese, visiting the parish, said to the then warden of the church's temporal interests, who accompanied him round, \" How came the churchwardens to commit such an atrocity ? receiving in reply this intellectual comment, \" 'Cos they was flats.\" It is not to be supposed hereby that a spiritual dearth exists in Avranches ; in more than one spot busy masons toiled, and a really large, handsome church, in a prominent situation, approaches completion. Our nation has also the advantage of an English Church service. Within an enclosed space in a remote corner, yet once under the very walls of the cathedral, at the foot of a pillar, a granite slab, which originally formed the outer step of its north door, marks the spot where our first Plantagenet king (a.d. 1172), during a consecutive period of three days, did penance in penitential garb, with woollen frock, bare feet, and shoulders uncovered to receive the scourge of ecclesias tical discipline, receiving at length Papal absolution upon his assurance, intemperate language notwithstanding, that the murder of Thomas a Becket was without his knowledge or sanction.

On the eve of this expedition, joined by a very agreeable gentleman and lady, we chartered a conveyance to start at 10 a.m. (9 o'clock would have been better), to reach the celebrated mount in about 2i hours. It rained nearly the whole of the distance, so, with covered top, front and sides, nothing could be seen except the road behind us ; yet so interesting and lively was the conversation, so pleasantly passed the time, that we were all surprised when suddenly the carriage stopped with \" Messieurs et Mesdames nous y sommes arrives.\" The rain had providentially ceased, and, all at once, before our astonished vision stood that superb, isolated cone of granite ; at its base a town, rising from a surrounding of medi\u00e6val ramparts with ten towers, dominated by a castle which has served the purpose of abbey, fortress and states prison, crowned by a strongly built church. Lightning, fire, sword and earthquake have in turn thrown down, burnt, devastated and shaken it from summit to base. As lately as 1509 the electric fluid struck the spire, and for the tenth time did great damage to the church ; yet how grandly it rears its proud head, the centre of attraction for a large amphitheatre of coast. * \" Henri II. est le plus illustre des roiifrancais qui ont regne en Augletene, un des plus illustres de l'histoire britannique tout entifcre. \u2014 Histoire litteraire dela France (M. de Pastoret)."], [46, "36 Normandy.

Its course was formerly past the north of Mont St. Michel, but became changed by shifting sands to the south. From north of the mount the Couesnon passed between it and the islet of Tombelene. In 1419 the English fortified themselves in the latter, the river preventing their ejectment by the defenders of Mont Saint Michel. Thus, not through starved-out garrison, scaled bulwarks, or negociation, but by the caprice of a stream, whose fickle, faithless disposition of particles had imperilled Duke William's army, this frequent \" bone of contention\" ultimately passed from Brittany to Normandy. The interior of this stronghold is reached through three portes, access not being, as might be supposed, at the end of the causeway, constructed from the mainland, but by a wooden bridge to the left hand, leading to the first porte, erected to protect the Barbacanc (1426), a strong porte of defence, which covers the approach to the porte du Roi ; to the latter, formerly, a fosse with drawbridge and portcullis guarded the entrance.

A private room having been required, Madame Poulard said, \" Mais, voyez vous, Madame, c'est absolument impossible, il y a tant de monde ! \" All that could be obtained was a separate table. Madame Poulard, observing that the Princess ate little, rallied her upon want of appetite, encouraging Her Royal Highness to eat more by a caressing little pat. When informed of the high rank of her visitor, the hostess expressed regret for the liberty she had taken, through lack of knowledge. If personally offered, from the highly gracious yet dignified tone of our Royal Family, and the natural courteous bearing of Madame Poulard, I feel assured the apology would be rendered and received in a most charming manner.

The Basilica, or Church, was built in the form of a Latin cross. At its base is an artificial platform, supported all round upon solid walls, columns, arches and vaulted halls of immense strength. In spite of many casualties, a notable portion of the original structure remains. Very important works are being carried on by the Government to remove blemishes, and in an endeavour to reproduce the characteristic details of its primitive architecture. The views from the platform are magnificent and extensive : over the middle of the court thus formed and on the topmost pinnacle of the church the protecting figure, St. Michael, was placed (or replaced) in this month of August, 1897.* In spite of scaffolding and obstructions, a perfect delectation awaits the enthusiast within. The nave is distinguished by its majestic severity.

In November of the first date 300 harshly-treated priests were liberated by Vendeans, and at the latter period (1863) this prison was finally suppressed.

When the Peers adjudged the Duchy of Brittany to Charles de Blois, the war commenced, simply to know who should carry the day in Brittany, France or England, for, whilst France supported Charles, Brittany, in Montfort's behalf, opened her arms to the English, but she gave, en revanche, Du Guesclin to France.

As a nine-year-old he floored a man, and for lads of his own age he could send half-a-score rolling one over another. \u00c6tat. seventeen he took the palm at a grand wrestling match, and having fallen as he threw his man, he handed over the prize to his competitor. In 1338 a magnificent tournament took place at Rennes en l'honneur des Dames, to celebrate the marriage of Jeanne de Bretagne and Charles, Comte de Blois. Challenges were sent to the flower of chivalry in France and England ; amid the applause of chevaliers and the waving scarfs of the ladies, Bertrand Du Guesclin, still under age, carried off the prize \u2014 a silver swan, the size of nature. * This scene is represented above his monument. Du Guesclin wished to be buried by the side of his first wife, the beautiful and spiritual Tiphane Raguenel, but Charles V. commanded his body to lie midst kings at St. Derjis ; his heart alone remains in the urn in the north transept of St. Sauveur, Dinan, where you find also delineated his armorial bearings -a double-headed black eagle\u2014 under this a heart, and below a square or shield with a bar from A dexter to I sinister. The style of inscription is quaint, \" Cy : gist : le cueur : de missire : Bertran : Du Gueaqui en : son vivat : conestable : de Frace : qui : trepassa : le: xiii\u00ab jour : de : Juliet: l'an : mil iii<= iiiixx dont: son: corps: repos avecques : ceulx : des: Roys a Sainct-Denys : en France.

In 1357 Rennes was closely besieged by Lancaster and Montfort ; ruse was met by ruse ; to tempt the nearly starved out garrison from their interior quarters the Duke caused 2,000 pigs to be distributed near the ramparts, but he was outwitted, the screams of a living sow, suspended on a drawbridge, attracted the fraternity of \" unclean animals \" to her vicinity. Adroitly the drawbridge was lowered, the animal released; sharp for sty she \"cut her stick,\" followed, with a chorus of grunts, through the opened gate, by the whole herd of swine. After this dodge the inhabitants had, as they deserved, a good feed : yet a famished population could not hold out indefinitely upon this unexpected relief. Again, in sore straights, it was decided that somebody must pass through the enemy's quarters to seek help from Charles de Blois. A Bourgeois undertook this dangerous task on condition the city would take care of his numerous, starving family. A feigned sortie was made, citizens following, and soon effected a retreat, but the chosen individual fell into the hands of the besiegers, and desired to be conducted to the Duke of Lancaster. With the semblance of innocence, or frightened stupidity, he beguiled the Duke into the belief that the inhabitants, reduced to extremities, expected a convoy of provisions, on the morrow, escorted by 4,000 Germans, led by Charles de Blois. The Duke at once sent a large number of his troops to the spot from whence the pretended help was expected. During the commotion our \" innocent \""], [67, "Brittany. 57 escaped, and at break of day he met, opportunely, Du Guesclin, who swept at once, like a- cyclone, over the reduced English camp, upsetting, burning tents and slaughtering as though he had 20,000 men at his back; he then made straight for and possessed himself of the commissariat supplies, and carried them off to Rennes ; there he assembled the waggoners, paid them handsomely, binding them to two things : to deliver a message to the Duke of Lancaster, and, on pain of death, to convey no more provisions to the English. These waggoners faithfully delivered their in structions \" Bertrand salutes your grace, and swears he will see you as soon as possible ; meanwhile, he and his people have plenty to eat, and, should you wish for wines, and also wood, from the city, he will send you some to soothe your heart.\" Instead of being affronted, the message aroused Lan caster's admiration ; he wished to make the acquaintance of such a man, and sent a herald to invite him to dinner. Du Guesclin accepted, and, with four companions, was richly entertained. Conversation turned upon the quarrel between Charles de Blois and Jean de Montfort; alluding to the immense loss of life it would cause to Brittany, Lancaster said, \" Charles' claims are doubtful, Messire Bertrand ; join our side,\" offering him personal friend ship, high military position and territorial possessions. Frowning and like a roused lion, Bertrand declared him self incapable of treason. All at once, after spiced wine and plenty of it, an English cavalier provoked a quarrel with Du Guesclin, and a duel was arranged for the morrow, in presence of Lancaster's army and the town's inhabitants. The cry of \" perh'de Albion \" was raised in Rennes. In vain Bertrand's good aunt prayed him not to trust the English, ending with, \" At least, embrace me, my dear nephew.\" \" Dame, go home, kiss your husband ; I shall soon be back ; meanwhile, take care to have ready a good dinner, cooked to a turn.\" He duly returned to dinner ; the other one, poor fellow, did not require that meal"], [68, "Brittany. 58 Du Guesclin, prisoner to the Black Prince (of Wales). At Bordeaux, after the Battle of Navarrete, in Spain, 1366, Bertrand, for the second time, a victim to intractable foreign troops, was taken prisoner and handed over to the Black Prince. One day le Sire d'Albret (Breton) adroitly apprised the Prince that it was suggested that he dare not permit Du Guesclin to be ransomed, lest he should give the Prince too much trouble. Piqued, and changing colour, His Highness ordered the captive to be brought before him at once. In the interview that followed, exhibiting such nobility of character, we must divide our admiration between the two heroes.

P. : \" Go to, Messire Bertrand, you're joking ; I will let you off for a quarter of the sum.\" As Bertrand would not lessen it by a florin, the Prince was obliged to accept that amount. B. P. : \"' So be it ; you are free ; I simply doubt if you can find such a sum of money.\" B. D. G. : \"I shall find it, your highness, in replacing Henri de Transtamarre on the Spanish throne, for that I swear to you to accomplish : he will lend me half, and my very redoubted master, the King of France, the remainder.\" B. P. (exclaimed \u2014 enchanted) : \" What wonderful man is this, whom I see before me ? \" According to some historians the Princess of Wales travelled from Angouleme to Bordeaux to see Du Guesclin, and to present him, in a casket, ten thousand doubloons, which he accepted. Chandos and Coventry offered him three times that amount; without refusing them, Bertrand declared he would first apply to his friends in France and Brittany. They failed him not, he soon cried quits to the Black Prince, and redeemed his promise to re-establish Henry of Castille on the blood-stained throne of Don Pedro, a.d. 1369. Du Guesclin and Brittany.

At length Charles V. determined to conquer Brittany at any price ; then the"], [70, "60 Brittany. Connitable hesitated to shed the blood of those who had grown up with him on his native soil ; his eyes recognised his friends in their ranks; he solicited the King to make terms with the Duke in vain, so Bertrand sent his sword of office to Charles, who, too wise to accept the resignation, made him take it again and turn his attention to harassing the English in Guyenne. Taking, as he felt it to be, a final leave, the old leader said : \" Sire, I am well satisfied that you send me to Gascoyne, for I cannot deny that I have ever been for you a most faithful servant, and my heart would have been content to remain in arms where already placed. It is the country where God gave me life, where my blood relations and friends are: something of this must linger in the memory, yet I should have done my duty, but this can be undertaken by another without my help. However, I must tell you, sire, that by transferring me from Brittany, you remove from my power many ways of serving you. My eagle,\" referring to his blazonry, \" my eagle will soar no more, having lost its wings.\" Such a remarkable man required more than a passing comment. If too prolix, je vous en dcmande pardon.

The much worn stone of the west front is adorned by a winged lion and ox; symbols of St. Mark and St. Matthew. The immense and ponderous Binitier here also is curious ; it is supported by four struggling, strongly-built figures, pressed round the circumference at equal distances \u2014 hands grasping, legs and feet strained to the utmost to keep it up, bodies all decapitated. What a pity ! If the countenances were in keeping with the overtaxed forms they would have been something worth looking at. From this point in the North Transept is to be found the Sarcophagus of the Conniiable, already described. Behind the Apse of Saint Sauveur there is a pleasant garden, prettily arranged with paths ; at the end, to the left, the top of the Tour Ste- Catherine is reached on the level by walking along the line of ramparts, from thence a very fine view indeed greets and gladdens the eye ; no wonder Olivier Du Guesclin was tempted beyond the walls. Just below you a succession of terraces, as at Luxemburg, but not laid out in the same attractive style. This spot is a loadstone to visitors. Tour de l'Horloge, late 15th century, towering in height, built of granite and surmounted by a spire. A sonorous sound from the clock tower, noting the passage of time, recalls the portrait of a noble and fascinating lady who, in a queen-like fashion, carried a head marked by an enchanting gradation of tints : pupils of the eye black, eyebrows auburn with golden brown lashes and, for finishing touch, bright hair in a lighter shade. Eorn in the school of adversity, her mind was well trained and stored. As jeune fille she read Greek and Latin, and was accounted the most accomplished princess of Europe.

In 1507 the Duchesse Anne offered the bell of the Tour de l'Horloge, upon which the hours are still struck, to her \" good town of Dinan,\" and the leading inhabitants gave it her name. The clockwork was replaced some thirty years ago.* Castle or Chateau de la Duchesse Anne. A remarkable and well preserved specimen of 14th century military defences in Brittany ; protected by towers and surrounded by a deep mote, it was considered im pregnable. At once a fortress and a palace, Anne loved to make frequent stays in this Chateau, constructed by her great-grandfather Jean (IV.) de Montfort. After 1777 it became a prison, and remains so, with this difference : instead of war, or, in the days of terror priests \" rifractaircs\" it is now used for simple, district law offenders.

The Chapel, with its columns and arches of granite, be tokens the solidity of construction ; in a small piece opening from it, Anne could participate in the service without being seen : there the visitor can sit down for a moment in the seat of the Duchess. The granite steps, leading upwards, bear very slight traces of wear. The Governor's apartments are not shown. In the chapel used by the prisoners, a partition divides men and women. The men's dormitory is kept in a satis factory manner. Passing round the outer walls, near the top, the conductor points out parts covered by thin stone, easily removed or broken, from whence hot lead was poured down upon besiegers, also where a subterranean passage commenced between this Castle and that of Lehon. St. Malo and St. Michael may be seen on a clear day in the magnificent views from the top platform. With the chateau we will now take leave of its. mistress. The Duchess Anne, being the richest and most powerful heiress on the continent, had no lack of suitors, and any prince who could obtain with her the dowry of Bretagne would ensure a balance of power in Europe. The Duke of Orleans, the King of Rome, the Sire d'Albret and the Vicomte de Rohan sought her in wedlock, virtue and merit making her no less desirable than possessions. The Sire d'Albret, in revenge for the persistent refusal of her hand by Anne, who detested him, traitorously assisted Charles VIII. of France. Brittany was inundated by soldiers of all nationalities ; ravaged by pretended defenders ; torn to pieces by her own children. The Duchess was besieged in Rennes by French troops, whilst their King proposed marriage. The Barons saw no other way out of the difficulty, for, with armed forces, Charles VIII. demanded her hand and crown. Charles was brave and good (\" si brave qu'il"], [74, "Brittany. 64 bouleversa l'Europe comme un enfant \"), but, except for the tire and dignity of his eyes, disproportioned, with an un healthy complexion, ugly features, and lacking in esprit. Anne resisted -to the last moment with all her energy. Bishops, barons, friends and servants combined to enforce upon her the duties required by her position ; they drew a picture of the desperate war that had exhausted the treasure and blood of her country, the famine and epidemics thus engendered ; that Bretagne had but the alternative of ex termination or union with France. More still was needed : so the Duke of Orleans, the most favoured of her suitors, came, and, at her feet, renounced all personal pretensions, praying her to accept his brother. Finally, without army, courtiers or attendants, the King of France himself offered the regal crown, which the Duchess accepted with averted head \u2014 a noble sacrifice for the welfare of Bretagne. True to her motto, \" Malo mori quam f\u0153dari,\" she, figuratively, died sooner than sully her name by giving cause for further disasters to her beloved land ; in keeping also with the hereditary device of her Duchy, a figure of the ermine \u2014 - \" emblem of purity and of honour without stain,\"* \u2014 she attracted all eyes by her beauty and modest demeanour when crowned at St. Denis.

By l'eglise St. Malo, in the vicinity of these interesting habitations, antique furniture dealers abound. Suspicious as to genuine or made-up articles, a lady suggested that before purchasing \" il faut en etre connaisseur.\" Carved cradles put in a strong appearance : a speciality of Bretagne and still used, more or less, though many, I suspect, thus find a market. Another lady, with whom we had the pleasure of social intercourse, a good judge of form and points, gained the hearts of all the women in a certain locality by praising their little pigs : they could not make enough of her, they spoke all round of milady, so kind and good, who admired the diminutive cochons, and one cottager said: \" You must come in and look at the baby,\" which was gladly accepted as giving an opportunity of seeing an infant in one of these curiously carved cradles. The effect of praising a mother's cherub may be considered \" a known quantity,\" but to penetrate the affections on the backs of small grunters is a departure from ordinary experience.

On the death of his parents he became possessed, early in life, of a large fortune, and married Mademoiselle de la Motte-Piquet, settling down. at the Chateau de la Garaye, which became a pleasure retreat and favourite rendezvous for the wealthy young gentry of the neighbourhood. After having been thrown from her horse, which might have proved fatal to the Countess, followed by a great family sorrow, this pair, quitting the gaieties of society, determined, without reserve, to consecrate their lives to the suffering poor. As a preparation, the Count studied medicine in Paris ; the lady also acquired a knowledge of both medicine and surgery, and became an excellent oculist. Re-entering their Chateau they transformed it into a hospital, the Count, assisted, at his own expense, by four surgeons, and the Countess, with the aid of several religieuses, managed the infirmary, distributing relief and dressing wounds. Not content with this, the Count endowed a free school at Taden, where this worthy pair sleep in the tomb as they were united in their useful, christian life ; he founded a Hospital for Incurables and a Dispensary for the poor at Dinan, and wrote works of repute on therapeutics and chemistry.* The Hospital was destroyed at the Revolution ; happily the benevolent founders were spared such a sad sight, having died a.d. 1755 and 1757. This spot, with its near buildings, alike dedicated to the enlarged requirements of suffering humanity, seems to be sanctified ground by the action of those who graced its walls, devoting their wealth, their energies, their knowledge in a ' Becueil alphabetique de pronostics dangereux et mortels sur les diff'erentes maladies de l'homnie, pour servir a M.M. les Kecteurs et autres \" (Paris, 1736). \" Chymie hydraulique pour extraire les sels essentiels de vegetaux, animaux et mineraux avec l'eau pure \" (Paris, 1746).

Be it as it may, by treaty (1169) between the Kings of the two countries its demolition was ordered ; to what extent carried out (if at all), and afterwards reconstructed by the successors of Louis le Pieux, it is difficult to determine. An act is cited to the effect that Raoul de Coetquen held the Castle in 1402 for Duke Jean V ; again, 1642, the King ceded it to the Abbey monks, at a ground rent of ten pounds (tournois), under certain conditions, one being to preserve the eight towers.

Nominoe made Dol the metropolitan see of Brittany, where he was crowned about a.d. 850. \" Singular power of will ! strange courage ! incredible success of a prince so bold as to dare to undertake and accomplish this religious revolu tion, only a few years after the submissive and timorous reign of Louis le Debonnaire, that king, excommunicated and dethroned by the Church, holding up a suppliant hand to the bishops, who scarcely dared turn a pitying eye towards the sen of Charlemagne.\" A consequent anathema fell upon Nominoe, without discouraging him ; he called together his soldiers and carried the war into the country of their late sovereign.* * As usual, when dealing of old with Home, a reconciliation took place at the expense of the sinner : even in the joy of his triumph \u2014 \" Nominoe fit sa paix avec l'eglise ; il rendit aux monasteres les richesses dont il les avait depouilles, il rebfttit les eglises renversees dans toutes ces luttes.\" \u2014 Jules Janin."], [82, "Brittany. 72 One day King Nominoe, when enjoying a right royal chase, saw, rising before him like a vision, six wan, sickly looking, emaciated phantoms, clothed in goatskin. In fact, six monks, who had withdrawn themselves to the foot of the large hill (Lehon) to pray, fast and mortify the flesh ; perhaps the exercise of their severe discipline proved un peu de trop, so, prostrating themselves at the feet of the King, they begged him to assist them by a grant of a fertile district of land, by which, with manual labour, they might obtain food. The King listened attentively and answered, seriously, \" Have you any relics of saints ? For, if I give you land, I should desire to count upon the assistance of your saints in all my perils and in all my affairs.\" The poor monks had no such possessions. \" Then,\" said the King, \" I will give you money, but no land. If, after a time, out of pity for your trials and misery, God should grant you the body of some saint, whose protec tion would raise you up a suitable monastery and defend me in case of need, then come to me in all confidence ; you will find me ready to load with honours, goods and lands, a church placed under such blissful patronage.\" The Monks secure a Saint. In continuation, this authetic history becomes invaded by a touch of the marvellous. The favour of the King was something : how to turn it to account? The monks naturally desired some of the less perishable article ; long time, in sadness, they beat their brains, then fasted three days, and, eventually, one of them hit upon a plan, freighted a pinnace and made tracks for Sark. Why that small island ? \"Once upon a time\" \u2014 a noble Breton, Count Loiescon. possessed three of the Channel Islands, but he was a leper, and like Naarnan was cured of his leprosy by a holy man \u2014 Saint (or perhaps then simply Pere) Magloire."], [83, "Brittany. 73 Out of gratitude the Count gave his benefactor half the island with its excellent fishing and superior wild-fowl sport. Straightway not a fish, not a bird could be found in the retained portion ; all had gone over to Magloire. Like a wise man, Loiescon consulted his \"better half,\" who advised an exchange of territory. This arranged, every bird, every fish changed quarters ; whether those \" denizens of air \" and water thought it would bring a blessing and an easier death if caught by pious hands, who can tell ? The natural order was re-established when the Count ceded the whole island to Magloire, who there established a grand monastery, where he resided for the remainder of his life, and in which his bones rested.* As these islands belonged to Brittany, the monk excited no distrust when he came to offer his devout homage to this tomb. He cleverly held out a bribe to the \" Custos sacri Corporis.\" This plan bore no immediate results ; so, some months later, a more important expedition was devised under the leadership of an astute, erudite, eloquent monk, well up in forms of speech \u2014 Condan. When, on arrival, the strange cenobites entered the church, the monks chanted mass and the deacon pronounced the words, \" Beware of false prophets which eome to yrou in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.\" Condan took these words personally, imagined his design known, and anticipated vengeance; thus agitated, he and his companions remained long prostrate, offering mixed prayers, tears and sobs before the altar. The service finished, the monks of Sark exercised the usual monastic hospitality, invited them to partake of their larder capabilities, and treated them handsomely. After six days, occupied in devotional exercises and honour to St. Magloire, Condan announced his departure on the morrow, demanding * Sark \u2014 \"There are traces of a monastery founded in the 6th century by St. Magliore, the site of which was given by Queen Elizabeth in 1565 to the Cartaret family.\" \u2014 National Gazetteer (Virtue & Co)."], [84, "Brittany. 74 permission to pass the last night with his companions in prayer at the tomb, in the company of its guardians, and under their surveillance. Until about midnight their attitude and conduct were irreproachable, but, when all outside slept, Condan approached the tomb and supplicated the Saint to show his will by some certain sign, who by-the-bye, is said tb'have expressed his approbation of a change of home and duties by making his appendages (Chasse) extremely easy to lift from the former resting place. Thus the pious fraud was perpetrated ; the \" ravening wolves \" and corrupted guardians accompanied the precious acquisition. The crossing was rough, and, for some time, the dangerous proximity of their pursuers raised a vision of cold steel, or surmise of \" He that takes what isn't issen, When he's cotched, he'll go to prison.\" Eventually the wet and exhausted monks landed in Brittany ; once dried, yet frightfully hungry, they concerted and fresco dinner in a small village nigh at hand, depositing the sanctified body ori one of two branches of a large apple tree in the garden of its owner. The stolen saint was evidently tired of the monotonous dash of the waves round his island rock, and the thud and echo thus produced in his sea caves, for he first baffled his pursuers and now put a premium upon duplicity by regaling those who sat at table with most delicious sweet apples from the bough on which he rested, whilst the twin branch retained its original acerbity and nauseousness baffling description. Eventually Saint Magloire reached his new abode, a little wooden church on the banks of the Ranee, to which the monks carried the body in triumph, cheered by the greetings and joy of the inhabitants. Nominoe kept his word by an endowment of rich domains ; a wealthy, powerful, far-famed abbey rose to view, aud the locality of the wild savage hunting ground soon became \" a smiling, fertile, flowery elysium.\""], [85, "Brittany. 75 The Abbey Church. \"Le Chateau et l'abbaye de Lehon, vieux debris des splendeurs passe.\"\u2014 J. Janin. \"Church now roofless.\"\u2014 Guide Book, 1882. A visitor, half-a-century ago, writes: \u2014 \". . . . The interior, a simple nave, presents everywhere a picture of devastation. The windows are broken ; the arches of the roof all but destroyed : the floor has disappeared under a heap of rubbish, overgrown by briar and bramble \" (trans lation). All this corresponds with a sketch before me. The Abbey Church originated in a humble priory of the order of St. Benedict, where dwelt five or six almost unknown monks, and was founded, according to tradition, in the Seventh Century : although the Chateau remains a mass of \" vieux debris \" \u2014 the Abbey Church is now wonderfully restored, through the indomitable energy and perseverance of Monsieur l'Abbe Foucrc-Mace, Rector of Lehon. After thirteen years of difficult, anxious labour, the scaffolding disappeared from under the arch roof of white stone, brought from neighbouring quarries, and on the 8th of July, 1897, the edifice was consecrated with parading, processions, bands and banners; judging from the bright face and vivid description of an intelligent cottage lassie, that day will live long in the villagers' memory. As you enter at the west end, by a noble, circular archway, the' interior effect and success of the restoration are very apparent. Amongst old memorials the bdniticr merits special attention, and, in pointed arch recesses, the monument of a Chdtclaine, Twelfth Century, also one of a Prelate, the latter having been discovered in clearing away the earth and rubbish, and, further on, figures in dark oak, released from outrageous colouring and coats of plaster ; that of our Saviour, crucified, is of great value, the body being anatomically perfect and head remarkably fine."], [86, "76 Brittany. Eight framed panels, dating from the beginning of the Seventeenth Century, now occupy their original place in the choir, minus the stalls ; two other panels are in their old position at the west end. The new pulpit carved, as is the altar, in white granite, is a pleasing feature \u2014 a reproduction, I believe, of the original. In front, three panels in bas-relief, St. Magloire, Noel Mars and Charles de Blois are from the chisel of M. Jean Hubert. The windows are an extensive treat for the student, having nothing in common with what one is accustomed to find in church decoration. They are pictures on glass, dedicated entirely to the history, true and legendary, of Lehon and its Abbey during a period of nine centuries ; all most artistically worked out from the cartons of M. Fritel, Parisian artist, in the famed Atelier of M. Vermont- Pomery, of Rheims, who personally directs the smallest details in the shades of colour of his transparent mediums ; composition, attitude and facial expression attesting to the execution of clever designs. Beginning on the north side, three windows are each divided into two Bays or compartments ; so far, means have been found to utilize only the lower portions. About A.D. 919, as a contemporary writer, Flodoard, states, \" it was impossible to find protection against the Norman pirates, who, like swarms of locusts, covered the face of the land,\" consequently, bodies of holy Bretons were removed from all parts of Brittany, A caravan, with many such remains, left the Castle of Lehon, where, for safety, these relics and other insignia, had been deposited, borne and escorted by priests and monks, who wandered beyond the frontiers, seeking places of greater security, St. Magloire among the rest. The Monastery, at that time, enjoyed the favour of princes, was very flourishing and rich, but when the pirates arrived at Lehon they discovered the absence of the numerous"], [87, "Brittany. 77 monks, the precious treasures, and especially the costly cMsse of St. Magloire : infuriated, they sacked the neighbourhood, pillaged the royal Abbey, and consigned it to the flames.

After crossing the old bridge the road becomes very steep, and the tired mules, being utterly unable to hold their footing, were dragged back ; a catastrophe was imminent. The peasants, seeing the danger, with vigorous arms stopped the carriage, removed the mules, took gaily their place, others pushed behind with equal will, and thus the carriage reached the summit. The Duchess thanked them with emotion, and said : \" Henceforth, in remembrance of your good deed and devotedness to me, this street shall bear my name. Let it be called ' La rue Anne.' \" This, and not an ignorant corruption, Rue-aux-Anes, is now its proper appellation. 2nd Bay : \" La Quintaine \" (Quintain).

I owe you naught more, so ends my spell.\" After this bit of sauce, a suggestion of honour and respect to the pere supirieur follows. Memory recalls instances, after the interesting marriage ceremony, when a venerable English vicar occasionally secured the first kiss ; so after this engaging ceremonial at Lehon the prominent clerical and lay representatives became in touch.

Two Ecoincons, much like inverted cornucopias, form the angles of the large rose, with a small circular illustration at each base. This magnificent work of modern art may be called the Magloire window, being entirely devoted to his life and influence. Legend, with an alchemist's wand, is apt to transmute (apparently) the baser metal into gold ; yet there is something in it that deals with the higher feelings of our nature, something elevating, the very opposite of cold materialism, though, perhaps, \"in all things too superstitious.\" I have spoken rather disrespectfully of the manner in which St. Magloire's services were attained ; far be it from me, however, to disparage the life of a good man.

In 1375 Jean IV. (de Montfort), having failed again to recover his dukedom, was interdicted by the con ditions of a truce even to reside in Bretagne ; then Charles V. forbade each and all Bretons to receive \" the false traitor Montfort, pretended Duke of Brittany,\" so the latter, tabooed by France and forsaken by Brittany, wandered about for three years in England and Flanders. Scene 1. \u2014 After the death of the Black Prince and Edward III. (1376-1377), the Duke of Lancaster recom menced war in Brittany, twice besieging St. Malo with cannon, at that time a novel mode of warfare to the Malouins, and stigmatised as implements \" lent by the devil.\" St. Malo, under the command of Du Guesclin, was ably defended by the nobles and \" Ce nid d'intrepides Corsaires,\" who success fully resisted the enemy. December 8th, 1378 \u2014 By a decree of the peers of France, that tribunal declared Jean de Montfort guilty of high treason, and also annexed the Duchy of Brittany to that of France, sacrificing the alliance of twenty years to Jeanne, now the widow of Charles de Blois. This, and subsequent actions, produced a strong revulsion of feeling in Brittany ; so with a remembrance of the happy days of in dependence, the popularity of Charles V. and the French vanished like smoke. The nobles formed a great national league for the salvation of their country and Montfort was recalled. Arrived in London, the envoys of Bretagne, at the feet of Jean IV., prayed him to return ; the exiled Prince was so astonished that he doubted his very eyes and ears and demanded further proof of the will of his people. A second embassy conveyed, in writing, the wishes and support of nearly all the nobles in the land. After swearing (23rd July, 1379) to King Richard a more intimate alliance than ever against the French king, \" il se decida a reprendre le chemin du trone.\" England took Montfort's part in the"], [97, "Brittany. 87 struggle, and the English are still more acceptable to the Breton than to the Norman.

Nobles, burgesses and peasants rushed to the sandy shore to meet their deliverer, to see who should first kiss the hand that brought back independence to Brittany. Seigneurs of the highest rank, habited in silk and gilded armour, plunged into the waves and knelt, full of emotion, ' up to the chin ' in water. Landing, the Duke seemed to pass from one sea to another, so much the waving crowd pressed and swayed against him ; shouts of applause pierced the sky and awoke the echoes of the strand ; men and women, young and old, prostrated themselves . . . . ; they stretched out their hands to him, they threw him flowers, they covered with kisses and tears the trace of his steps. Four peasants, overcome with agitation, embraced his knees in the name of the parishes, begging him to receive them in his favour and to forget the past.\" \u2014 -(Translation, Pitre-Chevalier.) Borne on the arms of his people the Duke arrived at Dinan, then, crowning triumph of all, he was met, to do him homage, by his longtime mortal enemy, Jeanne, widow of Charles de Blois, and it redounds to her glory, that, putting aside her old, bitter antagonism, for the love of country she warmly espoused the cause and pressed the hand of her husband's conqueror. It was now the question of remaining a distinct people \u2014 a nationality \u2014 free Bretagne. Thus ended that deplorable, bitter and costly family quarrel.

On land the clouds of dust were blinding and the sky threatening. So we left early crossing to Dinard in the little steamer, from thence by rail to Dinan ; at the hotel we found our chairs tilted up at the allotted and comfortable table d'hote space, free from a courant d'air, and opposite the central vase of flowers, arranged as by the hand and taste of Flora herself. On the eve of quitting so charming a spot we must refer to one agreeable surprise. We had been led to expect a difficulty in understanding the people of Bretagne, told that it required a Welshman to comprehend their lingo, and, from names of families and places, it is easy to perceive an under lying tongue. Owing to radical changes manifold, the dialect, like the \"Walloon (which is not taught in the schools of its geographical area), has given place to the language of the country, international converse and communication. In outlying districts we might have found speech difficult, to wit, \" Un jargon grossier qui ne parait pas se pre ter a la mesure des vers,\" as says an old writer, but I suspect the activity of the schoolmaster of to-day has revolutionised the whole matter. With man, \u2022The remaining Dukes of Brittany were :\u2014 Jean V. (le sage), son of Jean IV. ; died 1442 ; Francois Ipr, son of Jean V. ; no male issue ; died 1451 ; Pierre II. , brother of Francois Iir ; no legitimate children; died 1457 ; Arthur III., brother of Jean V. ; reigned 16 months ; Francois II., nephew of Arthur III. and grandson of Jean IV., the last Duke of Brittany and father of the Duchess Anne. The French were at their old game, they ceased not \"from troubling\" and \"the weary\" knew no \"rest,\" for Louis XI., who ascended the throne in 14G1, declared \"Mes deux cousins de Bourgogne et de Bretagne tomberont les premiers.\" So Francois II. died of grief at Coiron. near Nantes, A.D. 1488."], [99, "Brittany. 89 woman or child, from first to last of our visit, no embarrass ment occurred in question or reply, no jaryon assailed our ears. After all, who would incur the requisite trouble and expense of learning a language, now that a royal road has been discovered, into which you may pass the turnstile by tendering a facsimile of the recruiting sergeant's ready money, and (to use conventional terms) \" pick up \" a new language, or \" rub up \" one rusty or forgotten ? Read, with delight, this hit upon a fragrant avenue, imparting to an unweildy tongue, by inhalation, a flowing, ready, foreign glibness. \" Put a shilling in the slot, marked with the requisite language, and pull out a drawer containing a sixpenny grammar and a sixpenny box of the concentrated essence of accent : read the first, inhale the second, and the mastery of the foreign language is completed.\" \u2014 Daily Telegraph, Sept. 1st, 1897. Diuan to Caen. \u2014 It was a day to water the gardens of this \" Eden of Brittany,\" as Souvestre calls Dinan. It rained when we were dressing ; it rained when we went to bed, and it rained all day, without intermission. We had to change carriages three times, and on each occasion the downpour seemed to intensify its spitefulness. It must be borne in mind that no underground arch, no over head covering leads from one platform to another. You have to run over the rails and clamber up as near to heaven as the elevated compartment of one of these railway carriages, will lift you, with umbrellas and packages to boot. The designers must have had a dovecote in mind \u2014 a place for a creature with wings \u2014 when working out their ideas. Certes, given fellow passengers, you receive the most ready help and kindest attention possible, both when mounting and descending.

Kenelm Chillingley held that big, strong people need much food, and are prone to melancholy ; the waiter's frontis piece, apart from his huge body, looked as if he had enacted Eugene Aram, and, with an equally depressing mug, the circum ference of his mistress would be difficult to match. Two prief.ts came in and ate their food, opposite each other, without exchange of words, beyond a greeting. There was a single exception in the briskness of a rather pleasant waitress. After nine pluvious hours we reached our hotel to receive a greeting of welcome from our friends, ere we had time to alight from the conveyance. CONCLUSION. The adage that appearances are deceptive holds good in both Normandy and Brittany. The habits of the people are simple and unostentatious, so that many a well-lined purse is hidden under a modest blouse, \" And things are not what they seem.\" One day in Brittany, when needing refreshment, a restaurant tempted us by its good, double frontage : we tried to peep inside, but the customary muslin blinds' baffled our intention ; entering, we elevated our eyebrows at the sight of a sanded floor, bare tables, backless chairs with rush bottoms and the proprietor's reception in his shirt sleeves As our wishes seemed above his measure, being in his rio-ht mmd, he called his wife. A small table was first covered with a spotless white cloth and serviettes of like nature followed.

We were no less surprised by the superior quality of comestibles and potables, so delicately served, than by the extreme moderation of the cost. Both Normans and Bretons are said to be fond of money, and will, no doubt, receive your cash with pleasure if attended with a due and reasonable amount of courtesy ; minus this qualification they will care very little for either man or money. One is apt to forget being on the Continent from a startling resemblance of form and feature to well-known individuals in our own land, and scarcely to realise that the utterance is in another tongue. The quiet bearing, measured speech and absence of gesticulation seem to recall dukedoms of Normandy and Brittany ere the one and the other became absorbed by the darker featured, more impulsive Frank. This decided cousinship \u2014 may its traces long continue \u2014 should serve as a powerful loadstone on both sides of the Channel. We missed in our tour one marked character of the precincts and environs of Paris life, the innocent brewer of a mild beverage : to Anglicise the liquid, the \" Spanish juice wine (?) \" of our childhood. Le Marchand de Coco, who with his little bell, invites you, at the cost of a sou, to quaff your fill of his fresh, cold drink. \" A la fraiche ! a la glace ! qui veut boire ?
