' HAVE YOU SEEN BUT A BRIGHT LILY GROW V ' It was so calm that scarce the feathery weed, Sown by some eagle on the topmost stone, Swayed in the air.' She has pushed her large hat off her broAV to let the refreshing evening breezes fan her fair young face, beautiful Avith the inno cence of youth, and the promise of riper charms. She is a blonde \u2014 so far Saxon in type \u2014 but with full pouting ruddy lips, eyes that though blue as heaven's oavii sky can gaze with a passionate tenderness all their own, a skin of pearly A\\rhiteness, and fair curling hair which, hanging down in VOL.

She is standing, watering pot in hand, in a tiny garden, the back of Avhich opens on to a road not a hundred yards from the Brunnen at Homburg, and is consequently some distance from the town. Passing backwards and fonvards along this road, from Avhich she is only half -hidden by a feAV bushes of irregular groAvth, there are many passengers, not a few of Avhom stop on their way to gaze on the young Flora, Avho, re gardless of the observation she occasions, is pursuing her avocation, singing to herself the while in soft Ioav tones. The great world may tramp for aye outside her gar den hedge \u2014 men may pause at its very gate and devour her Avith passionate eyes \u2014 she heeds them not : her inner life has as yet been disturbed by no love knowledge save that taught by books and dreams; her only consciousness is of purity, virtue, and truth."], [13, "HAVE YOU SEEN BUT A BRIGHT LILY GROW? 3 Yet she alone, perchance, of all the men and Avomen among Avhom she dwells, wears the immaculate Avhite robe ; but, vile though many of them are Avith whom she holds daily converse, Avho shall be vile enough to wrest the spotless garment from the shoulders of a child ? She perceives on a sudden a broken lily, emblem, like herself, of innocence, and Avith a little cry of regret, she bends over it, and seeks, by means of a stick pushed firmly into the earth, to prop it up, and bind it Avith a ribbon Avhich she takes from among her flowing hair. Alas ! alas ! her efforts are futile, the lily bends and droops, the life- cord is snapped, there is nothing to be done but to let it adorn her mother's draAv ing-room for aAvhile, fill the air for a few days with its rich odour, and then cast it discarded and forgotten to wither and die.

While she dreams there, pensively wiping the while the mould-stained petals of her type-floAver with her handkerchief, a man, who has lin gered longer than the other passers-by, is watching her Avith a riveted and eager gaze. So ardent is it that had she raised her eyes from her floAver and noted him, she must have been startled \u2014 perhaps frightened. Who shall say as yet what phase of feeling the first love-glance shall produce, Avhether AAnth joy or sorrow the aAvakening to womanhood shall come? He who Avatched her was one Avho had set a mark on his generation, and accord ing to the nomenclature of the Avorld, was among its great men \u2014 great not in know ledge or goodness perchance \u2014 but how are these, in Society's opinion, comparable with riches, birth, and power?"], [15, "HAVE YOU SEEN BUT A BRIGHT LILY GROAV ? 5 A Russian noble who could not count his roubles, Prince Lavradskoff was omni potent. Added to this he was bon viveur, a courtly, princely gentleman who won his Avay with Avomen till he was almost nau seated by his own success, and had studied the theory of enjoyment till it had becoaie his very religion, and he had no other. Self was his god, and the Avhole human race he regarded as a set of mere machines placed on the earth to pander at Avill to his pas sions or his whims. He Avas a man about fifty, of a singularly impressive appearance, tall, rather inclined to embonpoint, but for all that robust and vigorous in frame. His countenance Avas of such death-like pallor as to amount almost to lividness, enhanced, too, as it was by a raven-black imperial and moustache, while the hair that hung in heavy clusters about his forehead AA'as grizzly almost to whiteness. The eyes \u2014 ah! the eyes as they peered through the"], [16, "6 INNOCENCE AT PLAA foliage at the crouching beauty within the garden \u2014 they refused to hide the inner life of the man, but told unasked the tale of how long since passion had gained in him an easy victory over principle. Such was Prince Lavradskoff, society's darling, with- out being a fop, the best-dressed man in Europe ; he who at will could wear the largest number of decorations, having even eclipsed on more than one State occasion those claiming near kinship with royalty. The only omission, perhaps, in the noble Russian's gifts from the gods was that of pedigree; his race was princely, but not Imperial. To the Czar he must tender a submission which Prince Lavradskoff failed to feel for any authority, either human or divine, 'humbling himself,' as he would have expressed it, never, except before the ' mighty power of beauty.' With him as with most men of his species, Lavradskoff's life was not the"], [17, "HAVE YOU SEEN BUT A BRIGHT LILY GROAV? t ceaseless current of rare enjoyment he would have had people to believe. There were days, weeks, sometimes even long months when as ' pleasure's palled victim,' he would wander to and fro on the earth in search of a new excitement by which his blase senses might be kept even at summer heat. Failing other issues, play was al ways left to quicken the slumbering pulse and dispel the weariness that sheer satiety had produced. Hence his presence at Hom burg now. He had tried Paris, Vienna, London, vainly during the last six months ; nowhere could he find that for which he sought, and the nature of which he could scarcely define ; nor perhaps did he care to, so long as it was fresh and fair and diffi cult, this latter attribute doubtless embrac ing the greatest charm. To fill the va cuum for a time, he would join the motley crowd at the Kursaal, and watch his roubles come or go beneath the croupier's rake.

He is on his way to the tables now, Avhen the picture of a child sorroAving over a broken lily holds him spell-bound. The pearl is found. Lavradskoff has not Avan dered over Europe vainly, since his steps have at last led him here at this particular moment. ' Who is she ? \u2014 of Avhat parents ? Are her friends noble?' are the questions he asks himself rapidly, as, after looking at the young beauty in a sort of dream for some seconds, reason asserts itself, and the practical man \u2014 for Prince Lavradskoff, like all sensualists, is practical from the very selfishness that is in him \u2014 begins to beat about in his mind for means to effect an introduction.

Her pink-tipped fingers have arranged the lily lovingly, she has risen from her gracefully negligent posture, and, lily in hand, pauses before two or three of her floral favourites, which she fancies want her tender care. A few steps lead her from the garden to the villa in AA'hich she lives. She stops once more when she has half mounted them, and turns round to see Avhat effect her Avatering has had on the poor drooping plants.

But no, there she is again ; she gathers a beauteous,' full blown rose, in the very zenith of perfection, to place beside the lily in her vase.

Having gathered her rose, she stood for a second to strip the stem of its thorns. One of them pricked her sharply and clung pertinaciously to her finger ; she turned round Avith a piteous look on her SAveet face as if pleading for help; for the first time she became cognizant ofthe fact that she Avas Avatched. Prince Lavradskoff's eyes spoke the volumes his tongue dared not utter as yet; but their gaze, as it reached the girl, seemed to open a fresh vista, as when the sun bursts from betAveen two parting clouds and reveals suddenly a new and Avondrous scene. Dazzled almost to blindness, she forgot her thorn, even her rose ; for it fell, scatter ing its luxuriant petals at her feet. She turned and fled."], [22, "12 INNOCENCE AT TLAY. This time he might linger in vain ; she would come back no more. But Prince Lavradskoff Avas a man Avho, above all things, avoided the ridiculous. To be seen Avaiting about at a gate in pursuit of a pretty girl Avas a phase of love-making that was quite below his usual standard. So he passed on toAvards the Kursaal meditatingly ; a strange light shone in his dark eyes, and almost a smile wreathed itself about his pale thin lips. Was it joy over prospective success that he Avas anticipating ? or Avas he gloating over the many difficulties Avith Avhich he imagined this new adventure Avould be fraught ? Who shall say ? But, arrived at the Kursaal steps, he conversed Avith an amiability and freedom Avith tAvo or three acquaintances he met there Avhich the stern impassible prince was seldom knoAvn to bestoAv on men. Familiarity he ever estimated the very worst vice. And the girl Avent back to her lily, and"], [23, "HAVE YOU SEEN BUT A BRIGHT LILY GROW? 13 looked at it Avith her large blue eyes, dreaming. The earth-stains still marked its petals, in spite of all her care ; and as she noted them, half-grieving, half-thinking of the gleam of light which had shone across the gate, the analogy was strongly apparent, though she failed to note its existence. ' Poor lily !' she murmured, Availing. Ay, poor lily ! Then she sat down and thought, while the bright colour, which had on a sudden spread itself over her face in the garden, still mantled it noAv as the sensation she had received there remained unobliterated from her mind. The room she Avas dreaming in was a pretty one. Books and floAvers and work gave evidences of cultivation and taste, yet the house seemed singularly silent and still. 'Who' \u2014 as Prince Lavradskoff had Avon dered \u2014 ' Avere the legitimate guardians of this young half-fledged beauty?' If they"], [24, "14 INNOCENCE AT PLAY. had any existence, the amount of notice they bestowed on her Avas evidently limited ; for, tired of her solitude, or afraid of her thoughts in the drawing-room, she crossed the little vestibule and opened the door of another room. There supper Avas laid out tastefully and artistically for some five or six guests, but no one had arrived. She Avalked round the room several times, re arranging the floAvers on the table, as though Avandering in a sort of dream, putting va rious bits of china in different positions, and finally she Avent in search of her bruised lily, and gave it a prominent position among the floral gems Avith Avhich the supper table Avas decked. Then she passed up-stairs \u2014 always alone ! The rooms, like those on the ground -floor, had no inmates, though signs \u2022of habitation Avere too palpably manifest, in the shape of untidiness and litter. She looked out of a back AvindoAV into the gar -den. What did she expect to see there?"], [25, "HAVE YOU SEEN BUT A BRIGHT LILY GROW ? 15 Perhaps she did not ask herself. The shades of evening Avere lengthening, and through the gloom she could perceive naught. She only heard the tramp of many feet along the road, as men hurried on; for no one lingered noAV beside the garden gate or looked across the hedge. She turned from the Avindow Avith a sigh.

Given the anxious faces, the intoxicating madness of success, the lurid-eyed despair of utter ruin ; Lavradskoff watched it all as he leaned against a pillar, without himself approaching the table. How came it that he, a noted gambler, regarded the scene with wondering glances, as though he AA'ere a mere neophyte afraid to risk his neck beneath the yoke of play ? Perchance for the first time he was contemplating the spectacle, scarcely from a moral, but per haps from a philosophical, point of view. Strange paradox for Cupid to have aAvak ened the god of Reason ! Yet so it was, he"], [29, "19 THE DEMON OF PLAY. had bid Play go slumber for aAvhile, as having for the instant lost its zest and poAver, and with his OAvn sudden indiffer ence anent the chances of the green table, Lavradskoff became for the first time in terested in noting how good or eA'il fortune affected those AA'ho were enslaved votaries at the shrine of Chance. One woman Prince Lavradskoff made his especial study, not for her beauty or her youth, for she possessed neither ; besides to have found one houri in an evening's Avalk were surely all even he could ask of fate ! No ; this neAv attraction was middle-aged, shrivelled, almost mummy like in appearance, as if all the sap and nutriment required to keep the vital ener gies fresh and vigorous were exhausted by some overAvhelming and never-ceasing ex citement ; for this little Avoman Avas a speci men of a thorough gambler, and had but one passion, one aim, one object in exist ence \u2014 Play.

On more than one occasion he had even ex changed words Avith the lady; yet for all that, never till that particular evening did it occur to him to regard Avith any interest the fluctuation of her gambling: chances. They were against her, as ex emplified by the puckered brow, the half open mouth, the stony staring eyes.

' Ah, Madame, allow me, I am generally fortunate.' And speaking in French, he advanced toAvards the table as Madame Dahl's companion. ' 0 Prince, hoAv good of you ! You will play for me, will you not ? My luck to day is quite at zero.' He took the money she gave him, and being celebrated for a certain martingale of his OAvn, staked a portion of it. On this occasion, hoAvever, either the fickle goddess did not smile on the partnership, or the bark was scarcely freighted to endure on the stormy billoAvs of Play ; for little by little Madame Dahl's last resources dAvindled away.

Her extended palm had almost clutched them, when the last expiring gleam of honour flickered through the darkness in Avhich her mind was wrapped. ' If I lose, I cannot repay,' she said feebly and half regretfully. ' What does that matter ? It is my venture,' said the Prince. ' Messieurs, faites vos jeux !' cried the croaking voice of the croupier. A rouleau belonging to Prince Lavrads koff was placed on red. ' Dix-sept, rouge, couleur gagne !' He deducted the original sum he had placed on the table, passed the balance to Madame Dahl, and, lifting his hat Avith a smile, said politely \u2014 'Madame is under no obligation. Will Madame play?'

Only the Prince was deriving more tempor ary amusement than had been awakened for some time from the incessancy of this little Avoman's vagaries.

' That especial human being will not be Madame Dahl,' laughed the other, who, either from Avant of knoAvledge or Avant of belief, did not deal so severely with the Russian as his friend. ' Fronti nulla fides,' was the pointed ansAver.

It has come, as most things in life do come, in an unexpected form \u2014 in the opposition and frustration of his most ardent desires. He, who had believed himself till now to be omnipotent with women, has been foiled by a child ; and even as he sits moodily raging there, Annika is locked into her room upstairs, and, prone on the bare boards, she is sobbing her heart out in a first strong gush of woman's tears."], [62, "52 INNOCENCE AT PLAY.

What he had dared to whisper she scarcely knew, but that he had wounded her sensibility to the quick she could never forget. The warm glad love which he had hoped would spring spontaneously from the depths of her young heart to meet his more passionate cravings, was still. In its place came forth to meet him the cold, instinctive self-respect which is more or less strongly developed in most good women, and of which Annika had been endowed with a more than usual share, producing, as it did now, that wild outpouring of mad hate against Lavradskoff for his daring, and against herself for being so base a thing as to be counted worthy to be his victim."], [64, "54 INNOCENCE AT PLAY.

On Madame Dahl's impervious nature it, however, made no impression. Had she guessed its meaning, would she have felt any repugnance ? Who shall say ? She had lived a careless, a haphazard life among people whose standard of mo rality was of the lowest, without exactly having herself committed any flagrant faults.

' Only tell me how and I am sure I will help you with all my heart,' Another bow and another ghastly smile from princely lips. ' To-night at the Kursaal I will have the honour of resuming this conversation with Madame.'

She sought her out as soon as she had finished giving orders to Victoire, and when the girl, with swollen eyes and pale cheeks, unlocked the door, she was met with a shout of derisive laughter from her step-mother. It was obvious she would obtain no sympathy; but she threw herself, nevertheless, into the woman's arms and cried as though her heart would break.

To let him slip out of their clutches were a madness; to listen to Annika's talk about hating him past permission in folly, and only to be treated as a girlish whim.

We shall have some fine lady adopting you for a pet monkey one of these days.' 'If she has plenty of money I'm game,' said Felix complacently.

No time like the present for beginning. He dashed off tAvo or three articles glibly. Though they savoured some what of a penny a line, what matter ?

By the area rails stood a shri velled stripling, smoking to keep out the cold \u2014 the messenger from the office. Armstrong handed him a roll of papers on which the ink was scarcely dry; then, closing the window Avith a slam, he went back to his arm-chair, and for a minute or two sat and pondered. He had succeeded by a power of will in concentrating his ideas for the last two hours on dry subjects, deal ing hard blows with plain truth ; now surely he had gained the right to dream for a while, and even as a dream did the events of the"], [158, "148 INNOCENCE AT PLAY. last few days seem to him as he passed them in review before his mind.

But Vie Armstrong was a man, and, as Bruton had observed, of an impressionable nature. He had been thAvarted by adverse circumstances, roughly handled by an indignant loAv-bred father, and had that evening seen Annika Dahl. What was it in the Swedish beauty which had moved him? Did he already wish to banish Polly from his thoughts, and ask this neAv siren to share his joys and griefs? With indignation he repudiated the suggestion. ' Marry Annika Dahl !' and he laughed quietly to himself as the idea presented it self. Why he should not dream of marry ing her he did not stop to ask, but with a smile still on his face he proceeded to jerk"], [160, "150 INNOCENCE AT PLAY. his papers into a drawer with a degree of impatience that was worthy of Polly her self. As the chimes of a neighbouring clock struck four a.m. he passed into the inner room to bed. The Avorld is already thoroughly aired when Vie Armstrong emerges once more from the fusty ill-ventilated hole in which he has learned contentedly to sleep off fatigue. The bank -holiday makers are swarming along the streets in their Sunday apparel, not a few of them already giving eAudence of the state of jocund mirth in which London may be expected to revel ere the day has waned. As Mr. Armstrong looks out of the window while he waits for the slow-footed landlady to bring his tea and its accompaniment of rusty bacon, it seems as though he had some idea of joining in ' the people's fete.'

It is clear that he is going west and has serious thoughts of spending his money. But the shops on such a day are all closed; thus there Avill be small inducement to frit ter away his remaining coins. Cabs ! it is not often Mr. Armstrong treats himself to so luxurious a mode of progression ; but on this particular day he has a hansom before he has proceeded far along the Strand, and drives off at a brisk pace.

Vie Armstrong passes through a long garden which lies in front ofthe house, and knocks sharply at the door. It is opened immediately, and he is admitted without a Avord. It is a sort of toy abode. Everything is pretty and in miniature. All the furniture and ornaments look as if they Avere put there to be played with, not used \u2014 at all events not by stalwart men, to Avhich class Mr. Armstrong belongs. In the tiny drawing room a fire is burning briskly, but the Ve netian blinds shut out the dim winter's day light. On a crimson sofa, almost unobserv able save for the white dress she wears, lies a female form. She half rises Avith a httle cry as the door opens. ' Victor darling, I am so glad you have come !

'Naturally, but what else?' ' Well, we looked at each other and tried to read each other's thoughts and feelings.' ' How odd ! And Avith what success ? Tell me exactly Avhat you found hidden away in all the strangers you saw there. It will help to amuse me \u2014 give me some thing to think of when you are not here.'

How idealistic and unlike his real habits and surroundings he hoped her pictures were, God and himself only knew. ' I spoke but little to Madame Regnier,' he answered her lightly; 'later on, when I become better acquainted with her, you shall have a summary of her characteristics.

For that day, however, the spirit of un rest had descended on the little dwelling; and though Victor stayed till the early evening had almost passed into night, yet she he called Zara did not recover the tone of gladness with Avhich she had welcomed him, but looked at him every now and then Avith those deep longing eyes of hers as though searching in his mind for secrets of Avhich she was beginning to fear there Avere not a few carefully guarded from her."], [168, "158 INNOCENCE AT PLAY.

' And do you yourself feel no capability for loving ?' he asked, in a dismayed tone.

' Of common sense, a capability for taking a practical vieAv of life, and of course a good share of selfishness.'

' They often deceive,' she replied quietly; 'it is always a mistake to have too much faith, either for man or Avoman.' ' 0, mademoiselle, so young, so fair, and yet so sceptical;' and there Avas a tone of real sorrow in Armstrong's Avords which reached even the deepest recesses of that heart Avhich Annika professed not to possess. Still she did not flinch from the resolve she had made. ' Were it not Avell to change the subject of our talk, since it seems impossible we shall agree ?' she said.
