It is the purpose of this story of the State of New York to indicate in outline rather than in detail the stages of growth through which the Commonwealth, from a purely mercantile venture in a newly-discovered world, advanced to its present imperial position in a sisterhood of sovereign States. Against the background of historic facts is thrown this record of a hypothetical Knickerbocker family, the members of which never attained to the eminence of power, wealth, or official station, but remained through all the stages of national de velopment ever the same simple folk \u2014 active workers in their humble sphere but, with thousands like them, factors in the advancing career of a mighty State. Fragmentary as such sketches must necessarily be, the author trusts that they may serve to emphasize, in a novel way, certain historic happenings in the various epochs that mark the con tinual progress of the Empire State from its day of small things. If these, in turn, shall awaken in American readers a deeper interest in the more comprehensive histories of their nation, or of the States that stand as its component parts, the purpose of the author will have been fully served. We need, as a people, to know more of ourselves. The story of American progress is builded upon matters of even greater importance than its records of wars, of politics, and of men of renown. Between the lines of every history should be read the unwritten but not less notable story of the people. The family and descendants of Teunis Jansen, the honest burgher of the Winckel Street, may have had no existence in fact, but they can stand as types of those living, laboring folk, the people, whose daily duties, activities, cares and needs, are a part at once of the story and the success of the great State of New York."], [12, ""], [13, "TABLE OF CONTENTS CHAPTER I.

The land, my son ! \" And good Captain Jan Evert sen van Gloockens, of the Dutch galiot Gilded Beaver, laid a broad hand upon the shoulder of the lad who, leaning far over the high taffrail, was peering through the scattering haze of a September morning in the year 1657, toward the long, low coast-line just coming into sight. What the lad saw, over the quarter, was a distant rim of shore, looking very flat and level as it lay low down in the western horizon ; ahead, to the southwest, a misty mass that might be hills or might be cloud-banks was just dimly coming into view,"], [18, "THE INFANT COLONY. 12 while, between, an open stretch of water flashed and sparkled under the September sun. \" Nassauw Island, from Secktaw-hackey 'round to Rechqua-aike and Conitjen,\" said the skipper, in eluding the low coast-line in a comprehensive sweep of the hand; \"the Staten hills and Scheyichbi,\" he continued, in guide-book style, pointing to the cloud-bank in the south ; \" the Hoofden and the gateway to the Monados,\" he said, indicating the broad sweep of sparkling water ; \" and by that gateway, my son,\" he concluded, \"shall we and the Gilded Beaver sail upward to your long-wished-for haven of Nieuw Amsterdam.\" Translated into our modern geographical terms the good captain's talk, part Indian, part Dutch, in its names of places, would mean to us : \" Long Island shore from Fire Island Inlet around to Rockaway and Coney Island ; the Navesink hills, Staten Island, and the New Jersey shore ; the Nar rows and the gateway to Manhattan Island ; and by that gateway shall we sail upward to your long wished-for haven of New York.\" For so have names changed in two hundred years, although the low shore-line and the misty hills still appear the same, and are the first landmarks that greet the visitor from across the seas to-day, as he stands watchful and curious upon the deck of some great ocean steamer, even as they greeted young"], [19, "THE INFANT COLONY. 13 Teunis Jansen, from Amersfoort, as he stood, watchful and curious, on the unsteady deck of the Gilded Beaver two hundred and thirty years ago.

Nearly fifty years before, on a September day in"], [20, "THE INFANT COLONY. 14 the year 1609, an earlier Teunis Jansen \u2014 this lad's grandfather \u2014 had sailed this very course as one of the mixed crew of Dutch and English sailors who, under the command of Captain Henry Hudson, the English navigator, had seen from the deck of another Dutch galiot \u2014 the Half Moon \u2014 the same low-lying shore-line, the same misty hills, the same gleaming gateway to a new world. Fifty years had passed since Captain Henry Hudson, sailing up the beautiful river, had found himself in a land which he reported to be \" the finest kind for tillage and as beautiful as the foot of man ever trod upon \" ; and, within that time, many changes and a constantly increasing tide of emigration had come to the new lands of which Captain Hudson had taken possession in the name of the States General of Holland and the Dutch East India Company. Originally discovered by the Spaniards of Chris topher Columbus' day (as recent investigation clearly indicates), the land had been neglected and forgotten by its first discoverers, these same wealth devouring Spaniards, who, seeking gold and spices, cared only to follow the advice of the geographer of their king \u2014 Peter Martyr the Italian : \" To the South, to the South, for the great and exceedine riches of the Equinoctial ; they that seek gold must not go to the cold and frozen North.\""], [21, "THE LNFANT COLONY. 15 But, though this northern land might be ignored and forgotten by its earlier discoverers, the evi dence of Spanish exploration and possible occupa tion exists to-day in several actual and peculiar relics. One of the most striking of these is the simple headstone not long since unearthed near the town of Pompey, in Onondaga County, Central New York. For on this stone has been deciph ered, after much patient study, this nearly oblit erated inscription in abbreviated old Spanish : \" In the year of our Lord, 1520, in the sixth month, died here in the hope of immortality, our comrade Leo, of the city of Leon, in Spain.\" And, even more enduring than this crumbling headstone, the very language of those barbaric owners of the soil, who learned to know and hate the Spanish power, in the North as in the South, retained for centuries the stamp of Spanish contact. Many a place and tribe through Lower New York, accepted as Indian names by the first colonists, have been found by scholars to be based upon Spanish words. Indeed, even the metropolis of the Western World itself to-day retains in the name of the island upon which it is built \u2014 a name that it has proudly used for fully three hundred years \u2014 the evidence and the moral of the greatest evil which, from the very earliest days, the white man laid upon the red ; for it was called Manhattan,"], [22, "16 THE LNFANT COLONY. Manhates, Monatoes, Monados.* And monadoes is a Spanish word signifying \" the peace of drunken men.\" But, for all practical purposes, the Teunis Jansen of 1609, and his captain and companions on the Half Moon, first opened to European knowledge and commerce the river which they called Mauri tius, the French, Rio de Montaigne, but which for many a year has borne the name of its dauntless explorer, Hudson the navigator. It was then, too, that, by the favorable report of the country borne back to Holland, was laid the foundations for the great and marvelous future of the Empire State of New York. But young Teunis Jansen as he leaned over the taffrail of the Gilded Beaver thought little of this possible future. He was thinking of the past, and was recalling all that his grandfather had told him, as the old man would sit, smoking his big pipe crammed with Indian leaf, in the ingle-nook of the quaint little house at Amersfoort near the shores of the Zuyder Zee. For many, a time, had the old man told the lad the story of those early days : how he had come again and again to the Manhattans after Captain Hudson's discovery; how he had trafficked with the Indians for furs and \" pelts \" *As Monados, the name of Manhattan Island appears on the earliest maps of American discovery."], [23, "THE INFANT COLONY. 17 and made . merry in the log warehouse on the island ; how Captain Adriaen Block's vessel the Tiger had burned to the water's edge just off the Copake rocks ; * how, through the long winter of 1613 the shipwrecked sailors had lived in the four small houses,! half cabins, half wigwams, they had raised for shelter, and how, during their winter's exile, they had built a clumsy craft, the Unrest, on which they sailed away in the spring. And Teunis remembered, as well, all his father's stories. For his father, too, had been sailor and fur-trader in the New Netherlands. The lad had heard, many a time, of his father's rough and roving life on sea and shore ; of the trading stations of the great West India Company at Manhattan and Esopus and Fort Orange, away up the broad river ; at the Fresh River \\ and on the South River, \u00a7 a hundred miles southward from the Manhattans. He remembered his father's story how in the year 1632 Zwanendael on the South River had fallen before the assault of the savage red-man and he re called, alas, all too well, how news at last had come to Amersfoort that his own father, volunteering for the Heer Governor Kieft's bloody and unwarranted assault on the Indians at Pavonia in 1643, had *Where Castle Garden now stands. tAbout on the spot which is now No. 39 Broadway.

All these stories had long stirred the lad's am bition and made it his greatest desire to follow in the footsteps of his father and his grandfather, and come over to the New Netherlands to traffic and settle, and, perhaps, to make his fortune in trade. For, after all, this was the basis upon which the State of New York was founded \u2014 the eagerness for profitable trading. The desire for gain has always ruled mankind. It has peopled wildernesses, founded States, and produced nations. Patriotism, indeed, is largely business glorified into a principle. Even more than the yearnings for religious freedom, an ambition for profitable trade was the impelling cause that has resulted in the America of to-day. It was this that sent Hudson over the sea ; it was this that led Champlain into the wildernesses of the Adirondacks and brought these two men almost face to face, as, all unconsciously, on the same Sep tember days, they were pushing, the one to the South and the other to the North, in search of an impossible passage to a still more impossible Cathay. It was this, too, that sent factor and fur-trader into hitherto untrodden paths in advance alike of soldier and of priest, of conversion and of conquest."], [25, "THE INFANT COLONY. 19 \" The soldier,\" says Mr. Parkman, \" might be a roving knight, the priest a martyr and a saint ; but both alike were subserving the interests of that commerce which formed the only solid basis of the colony.\" When, in the year 1493, the Pope Alexander the Sixth, with a generosity that was as cheap as it was colossal, gave all America to Spain, the seeds of dissension in New World colonization were planted. Neither papal bull nor Spanish swords could keep the trader and the gain-desiring settler from their coveted trading-ground, and the grant by which France, basing her title on the questionable dis coveries of Verazzano, claimed all North America from the Atlantic to New Mexico, and from the Gulf to the Arctic Circle, was as valid, or rather, as worthless, as was the unfounded claim of Spain or the equally questionable ones of England and of Holland. It was these conflicting claims to the property of those other and earlier possessors \u2014 the red Indians of America \u2014 that led to interminable discussions and demands between the new settlers and their home governments; and these discussions seem to have raged more hotly in the New York colony than anywhere else. The people of Northern Europe, as they increased in wealth, developed a taste for luxuries. And not"], [26, "20 THE INFANT COLONY. the least of these luxuries was the fashion of wear ing costly robes and cloaks made from the skins of bear and bison, beaver and fox. The discovery of these fur-bearing animals in large numbers in the newly found land to the west* created a demand that others were quick to supply. It was seized upon by hundreds of enterprising men as an oppor tunity for profit, and thus at once was established what Mr. Parkman denominates \"the hardy, adven turous, lawless, fascinating fur trade.\" The trading post and the store-house were the first signs of the white man's civilization upon the banks of the Hudson and the shores of the greater and lesser lakes. Such was the log house built on Manhattan Island, very near to the present Bowling Green, in 1615; such, the trading-post, half fort, half store house,\" thirty-six feet long by twenty-six wide,\" on an island just below the site of the city of Albany and such, too, were the insecure bark lodges near Ticon deroga and on the shore of Oneida Lake and the equally temporary hut within sound of the roar of Niagara. Thus at various points, widely separated but held for the same general purpose of trade in furs, did the hermit trapper \u2014 shrewd, unscrupulous, brave and venturesome, \u2014 open the first chapter in the story of the Empire State. *In the years 1565-66 over six thousand buffalo skins were exported by French traders who secured them secretly from the fndian hunters of the Alleghany slope."], [27, "THE LNFANT COLO AY. 21 And how noble a domain for commerce and for settlement did the boundaries of this same Empire State inclose ! \" The history of a country,\" says Mr. Bancroft, \" is, in many of its features, deter mined by its geographical situation. The region which Hudson discovered possessed near the sea an unrivalled harbor; a river that admits the tide far into the interior ; on the north the chain of great lakes, which have their springs in the heart of the continent ; within its limits the sources of rivers that flow to the Gulf of Mexico and St. Lawrence, and to the bays of Chesapeake and Delaware ; of which, long before Europeans anchored off Sandy Hook, the warriors of the Five Nations availed themselves in their excursions to Quebec, to the Ohio and the Susquehanna. With just sufficient difficulties to irritate, and not enough to dishearten, New York united richest lands with the highest adaptation to foreign and domestic commerce.\" And yet the early settlers of New York in their efforts to obtain a home encountered obstacles that were calculated to both irritate and dishearten. Not in the limitations of a stubborn soil nor in the surprises of a barbaric foe were these encountered. Both these obstacles were courageously met and successfully overcome. The colonist's chief barriers to success were, rather, their own selfish over-lords. It was in spite of, the niggardly methods, the petty"], [28, "THE INFANT COLONY. 22 jealousies, and the continual strifes of their own patrons and protectors that the people of New York rose superior to circumstances and, triumph ing over the tyrannies of Companies and Patroons, of Dutch sluggishness and of British greed, became finally the real founders and upbuilders of a great and growing State. The foundations of the State were laid by com merce. But the builders of this foundation were the close-fisted members of the firm of Self and Monopoly. It is well for those who, at the present day, so inveigh against the great and grasping monopolies of our time, to remember that in this, as in other matters, the world's advance in righteousness may be seen. Not the most soul-less corporation of this last quarter of the nineteenth century is to be compared for selfishness, arrogance, short-sight edness, tyranny and greed to the companies that in the early days of American colonization sought to monopolize and \"corner\" the possibilities of a continent. And by no means the least culpable of these were the corporate bodies which, under the special per mission of the States General of Holland, secured the privilege of trade and settlement in the limits of what was then known as the New Netherlands. This was a vast section without absolute bounda-"], [29, "THE INFANT COLONY. 23 ries or prescribed limits save as such limits should be the indefinite frontier lines of the French occupa tion of Canada on the north, and the English col ony of Virginia on the south. This section was claimed by the States General of Holland \"in right of discovery \" and extended westward \" as far as the Dutch might be supposed ever to explore.\" The Dutch East India Company in whose service Henry Hudson was employed when he discovered the river that bears his name, was a wealthy and powerful commercial corporation of Holland. It monopolized the trade of the East, and, aiming to circumvent and get the better of Holland's bitterest enemy, Spain, this company expended vast sums in the search for a nearer and northerly passage to the China seas. Thus, among other places, were the New Netherlands discovered in September, 1609. Hudson's reports brought other Dutch ves sels on purposes of private trade into the \" River of the Mountains \" as the beautiful stream was called. Hongers, Pelgrom and Van Tweenhuysen, three Amsterdam merchants, were the earliest commer cial adventurers in this region, and on January 1st, 161 5, an association of speculative Amsterdam mer chants, under the style of the \"New Netherlands Company,\" secured from the government of Hol land the exclusive right for three years of trading in the region known as the New Netherlands."], [30, "24 THE INFANT COLONY. Individual speculation was forced to retire, and thus was the first monopoly established. The profits on this three years' trading contract were enormous, but upon its expiration, in 16 18, mercantile jealousy interferred and a renewal was refused. The Dutch West India Company was then formed. It was granted the exclusive trade upon the American and Asiatic coasts of the Atlantic, and was invested with enormous powers beyond those, so it is asserted, ever granted to any private corpo ration. And thus was monopoly perpetuated. For forty years the Dutch West India Company, its directors and servants, held autocratic power over its possessions known as the New Netherlands. The governors it sent out were merely officers in a commercial corporation caring for little except the privileges and the profits of their masters, the Com pany, and caring still less for the condition or the success of those of the colonists who were not, as were they, servants of the great monopoly. After a few years of this dog-in-the-manger policy of trade and government the failing revenues of its New Netherland possessions, when compared with those of its South American possessions, compelled the Company to seek for new methods to retrieve its losses. Wisdom should have suggested the policy of liberal offers to new settlers, but the aris tocratic notions that held sway even in republican"], [31, "THE INFANT COLONY. 25 Holland could not endure concessions to the peo ple. Instead, the Company sought to create what has been termed \"a monopoly within a monopoly.\" They disposed of great tracts of land, or \" manors,\" to certain of the Company's own officers or to wealthy Holland merchants who, under the title of patroons became, in reality, feudal lords over the lands thus ceded to them. The only redeeming feature of this additional monopoly was that the patroons were forced to acquire their lands from the Indians \"by purchase.\" This policy, wisely proposed, was wisely adhered to. It remains, therefore, to the honor of the Dutch settlers of New York that where far too many of the colonizers in America acquired their lands from the Indian owners through fraud or open seizure they, from the first, honestly paid for what they openly purchased. But, under the guardianship of monopolies men become either serfs or protestants. The State of New York grew because of the increasing indepen dence of its people and not because of any liberality on the part of its founders or of public benefits from the hands of its early governors. These, as has been said, were simply servants of the monopoly they represented, earnest in its service and loyal to their own interests, but regarding the people as vas sals to be curbed or inflictions to be ignored."], [32, "26 THE LNFANT COLONY. Mey and Tienpont, earliest of the representatives of the Company, were merely traders and factors caring only for the cargoes they could send to Holland. Minuit was a self-willed and self-seeking adventurer, Van Twiller, a drunken and indolent fool, Kieft a conceited and tyrannical bankrupt, Stuyvesant a despotic and passionate autocrat. And the change from Dutch to English rule brought little or no relief so far as the personal characteristics of the governors were concerned. They were favorites of the Duke or the King, re warded with colonial office for loyal personal ser vice and could not so lower their dignity as to consult the wishes or entertain the complaints of the \" people.\" And these \"people\" \u2014 who were they?

In this however they and their companions were to make for themselves a home and build their hopes and their endeavors into the great State of which, even more than the autocratic West India Company, the people themselves laid the firm foundation. But these all came slowly. It was not until 1624, fifteen years after Hudson's voyage, that the first real colonists came. Up to that date the New Netherlands had been used simply as a barter ground for the fur-traders. These colonists of 1624 were Belgian Protes tants, known as Walloons. Thirty families of these thrifty folk came over in the ship New Netherland, under charge of Captain Cornells Jacobsen Mey, afterward first Director-General of the colony. Eight men were landed at Manhattan; four couples were sent to the South River ; two families and six men to the Connecticut River region, and the rest were carried north to the Fort Orange, or Albany settlement. This, as has been said, was the first real colonization of New Netherland. That same year, 1624, other vessels came from Holland and, in the year following, the Dutch West India Company, rejoicing in a profit on their"], [37, "THE INFANT\" COLONY. 31 first year's business of nearly twenty-eight thousand guilders, determined to enlarge the settlement that was slowly growing around their chief warehouse on Manhattan Island. They accordingly offered certain special so-called \" inducements \" to emi grants, and before the close of the year four vessels brought settlers to the new colony \u2014 \"forty five persons in all with household furniture, farm ing utensils, and one hundred and three head of cattle.\" By June, 1626, the population of the Manhattan settlement (which did not receive the name of New Amsterdam until 1633) had grown to two hundred persons. There were some thirty dwellings grouped about the \"block house with red cedar palisades\" \u2014 called by courtesy \" the fort\" \u2014 which stood near the water's edge. That same year of 1626, the first stone building was erected. This was the Com pany's warehouse. In 1628 the island had outstripped the other set tlements in the province and boasted a population of two hundred and seventy persons, and the colo nists began to build houses of brick and stone. In 1630 the monopoly of the \"patroon\" system was authorized by the Company, and these owners of new tracts began to send over colonists to occupy their lands. So, year by year, was New Netherland gradually"], [38, "THE INFANT COLONY. 32 peopled, until in 1650, just forty years after Hud son's voyage, the province in its scattered trading settlements at Manhattan Island, Fort Orange, now Albany, the Fresh River, now Hartford in Connec ticut, Pavonia, now Jersey City, Zwanendael on the South, or Delaware River, not far from the pres ent site of Philadelphia, and Breuckelen, on Long Island, showed a census of nearly three thousand colonists. During the time of Stuyvesant, the last of the Dutch directors, or governors, these figures grew to a total of eight thousand persons within the confines of the New Netherlands, of whom over one thousand were resident on the island of Manhattan. And it was to these eight thousand colonists that young Teunis Jansen, whom we left gazing over the rail of the Gilded Beaver, was to join him self. For he was sailing up the Lower Bay toward the clustering houses of New Amsterdam in the beautiful month of September, 1657, the tenth year in the administration of the Heer Petrus Stuyve sant, Director-General of New Netherland for their High Mightinesses the States-General of Holland and the Honorable Lords Directors of the Dutch West India Company."], [39, "33 CHAPTER II.

The Gilded Beaver lay at her moorings in m i d stream, in the East River, just off the Long Dock. Teunis Jansen and the other passengers had come ashore in the Beaver's row boat and, upon the deck of the galiot, the good Captain Jan Evertsen van Gloockens was superintending the discharge of his cargo, which certain clumsy, flat-bottomed scows were taking ashore for delivery to the haven-master and the consignees.

And there on the Long Dock ready to meet and greet him stood Anthony Yerrenton, his father's former comrade and crony in the fur-trading days \u2014 one of those cosmopolitan fellows, as much Dutch as English, and as much French and Indian as both, whom the American fur-trade, more than any other calling, specially produced.

Here he was at last, in a new land \u2014 a land which his grandfather had helped discover, his father to develop, and to which now he, with all his young life of endeavor and deter mination before him, had come, to find and found a home and \" grow up with the country.\" The arrival of a ship from the mother-country was sufficiently rare to be esteemed a sensation, but the Dutch were a people to take sensations seri ously and with all their interest in the Gilded Beaver, its passengers and its cargo, the group of watchers and welcomers that thronged the Long Dock made but little show of excitement. Friends greeted friends with the kiss of welcome that passed between men as well as women ; the numerous wine-shops near by found a sudden increase of pat ronage, but in all this there was little of the volu bility exhibited by Anthony Yerrenton. The old fur-trader, usually cool and sedate, had been aroused to enthusiasm by the sight of this lad from across the sea and he waxed elo quent over the beauties of the little town he loved so much. As they passed along he proudly pointed out for Teunis the signs of growth and increasing pros perity about the little city."], [43, "DUTCH NEW YORK. 37 \" Why, lad,\" he said, \" when your father and I used to come down here in our boats with our loads of furs from 'Sopus and Fort Orange, say twenty years ago \u2014 in Governor Van Twiller's time \u2014 there was ne'er a street in the whole town. The houses lay in clusters like, and snug up to the walls of the fort. De Perel Straat \u2014 this one we are on \u2014 was only a wagon-way along the river side. Look at it now! Forty-three houses, not counting the wine shops \u2014 and far too many of them, say I. All good houses, too \u2014 the best in town almost. Well, we have Governor Kieft to thank for starting this street, and there's little else we can thank him for \u2014 a greedy, violent and mischievous man, lad, whose folly caused your poor father's death ; he came near wrecking the colony too, and, faith, he would have done it if the Company had not listened for once to the appeals of the people. But see what we've done in spite of it all. Here are now some seventeen streets all told \u2014 Te Marckvelt, De Heere Straat, De Waal, Te Water, De Perel Straat, Aghter De Perel Straat, De Brouwer Straat, De Winckel Straat, De Bever Graft, Te Marckvelt Steegie, De Smee Straat, De Smits V'ly De Hoogh Straat, De Heere Graft, De Prince Graft, De Prince Straat, and De Brugh Straat, where I live. And look you, now; I bought my place on De Brugh Straat, scarce a dozen years back (barely"], [44, "38 DUTCH NEW YORK. five morgens and a half* in size is it), for just twenty-four guilders t and only yesterday Hendrick Kip offered me an hundred and twenty-five guild ers for the lot alone ! There's a profit for you, lad. But he don't get it. Why, we'll have De Brugh Straat paved within the year and my values will run even higher. O, yes ; we have commenced the paving. There's De Hoogh Straat yonder. Paved last year as finely and as fairly as any street in old Amsterdam. And if all goes well with us here, you shall see ! We will have all the streets most in use paved just as stoutly ere two years have gone. The pavement upon which good Heer Yerrenton was discoursing so eloquently, as he rattled off the queer Dutch names of the streets of old New York, would seem poor enough in these days of patent methods and of Belgian blocks. It was simply native cobble-stones with a gutter laid in the middle of the roadway and with no sidewalk what ever. But it was as grand as asphalt or granite in the eyes of Anthony Yerrenton. And, notwithstanding all its drawbacks, the city had made excellent progress for its years. First re garded by the Dutch West India Company as only a convenient storage station for furs and peltries it *The lot was 30 feet front by no feet deep. + $9.60 equal to about $50 to-day."], [45, "DUTCH NEW YORK. 39 had, since the year 1626, when the Heer Director Kieft bought the island from the Indians for twenty four dollars ( sixty guilders ) grown into quite a prosperous town despite the blunderings and the despotisms of its proprietors and its rulers. And as with the city so also with the colony. It prospered or languished according as trade fluctu ated or the stupidity of rulers affected it. But neither depression in trade nor inefficiency of gov ernors could retard the growth of a colony whose people were beginning to think for themselves, and were growing even more hardy, self-reliant and progressively assertive. From the first, the attitude of the people of New York had been one of assertion. Though the Dutch have ever made a boast of their spirit of liberty and toleration the story of their colonies shows their colonial rulers to have ever been lagging in the wake of the people's desires rather than leading the van. Every Dutch governor from Minuit to Stuyvesant, when he was not serving, first, his own interests and then those of his masters the Directors of the Dutch West India Company was engaged in the attempt to smother the aspirations of the people. The spirit of liberty and human progress cannot be smothered. There is a sense of independence created by the severance of home-ties and the"], [46, "DUTCH NEW YORK. 40 absence of home-restraints that appears in the emi grant from across the seas, even as it does in the adventurous Yankee lad \"seeking his own for tune.\" It is one of the secrets of the American character, and though sometimes it shows unpleas antly in the adopted citizen it is one which, intelli gently fostered, will lead to a grand national future. Personal prosperity is always the death of socialism. The colonists of the New Netherlands, upon the Hollander's native basis of opposition to tyranny (by which, according to Mr. Carlyle, they succeeded in \" breaking the vertebral column \" of Spain for ever), engrafted the stronger love of liberty that the free air of a vast New World unconsciously gave to them. However much it may be asserted that the theory of resistance to tyrants was of New Eng land origin, it is certain that, more than any other American colony, the province of New York made the first protest against the encroachments of aris tocracy and monopoly. Further than this, it may be said, as Mr. Berthold Fernow has recently ex pressed it, that \" the great Indian problem, which has been and still is a question of paramount im portance to the United States Government, was solved by the Dutch of New Netherland without great difficulty. . . . The historians who charge the Dutch with pusillanimity and cowardice in their dealings with the Indians forget that to their policy"], [47, "DUTCH NEW YORK. 41 we owe to-day the existence of the United States.\" After all, truthfulness in trade and honesty in commerce may make business principles principle indeed. It was this lesson of sterling honesty and shrewd common sense that young Teunis Jansen learned from the hospitable friend who bade him make the already crowded little house on De Brugh Straat his home until such time as he should have \" lost his sea legs \" and looked about him for something to do. The little home on De Brugh Straat was a type of the New Netherland home. It was a low story and a half structure, standing gable-end to the street, with front of wood and stone, and ends of small, alternate black and yellow Dutch bricks. Its tiled roof was surmounted with a weathercock and the big brass knocker, shaped like a dog's head, hung on the upper half of the ample Dutch door. The goode vrouw Yerrenton was scrupulously neat, and, the house within, was her undisputed province. The floor was scrubbed and sanded ; the wide fireplace in the kitchen was the general rallying-point, and the table was plentifully supplied with the simple food of the days of simple tastes. Teunis was given a \" slaap-banck,\" or sleeping-bench, in one of the dormered rooms under the eaves and soon grew to be regarded as one of the family \u2014"], [48, "42 DUTCH NEW YORK. and by none more so than buxom Grietje, otherwise Margaret Yerrenton. The young emigrant had come to the New Neth erlands at a critical period of its history. Already the Dutch power was on the wane. The English, always aggressive colonists in whatever part of the world they have planted the flag of Britain, were especially so in North America. Basing their claims to this New Netherland territory on a title not so valid as the Dutch \u2014 if that can be esteemed valid which is based simply upon discovery and occupation \u2014 the English authorities claimed owner ship and dominion over all the New Netherland limits. Not even the defensive policy of a stern and vigorous governor, like Stuyvesant, could make headway against the inevitable. Connecticut had practically fallen into English hands, so too had Westchester, the South River and New Jersey patents were fast slipping from Dutch control, while the greater part of Long Island acknowl edged England's authority. The commercial spirit seldom resorts to armed resistance. Communities absorbed in trade may protest, but they rarely fight. A change of rulers is preferable to business disturbance. Colonial his tory is full of evidence of this, from the days of Rome to those of England."], [49, "APPROACHING NEW AMSTERDAM IN 1656."], [50, ""], [51, "DUTCH NEW YORK. 45 Recklessly neglected by the selfish monopoly that was its master but not its protector, and desirous, as success seemed possible, of a more unfettered effort toward commercial progress, the New Neth erland colony gradually lost whatever of fealty or respect it had originally held toward the home gov ernment. With its people more interested in their profits from trade than in an unsubstantial and un remunerative patriotism the feeling which the colony displayed of indifference as to its rulers finally developed into an absolute preference for a stronger even if an alien set of masters. What young Teunis Jansen first discovered, when his attention was turned from an intimacy with per sonal characteristics and surroundings to an inter est in the colony's political life, was this growing disposition to accept and even to welcome a change of allegiance from Holland to England. Young fellows of nineteen, as a rule, are inter ested in political questions even if they do not study into or altogether comprehend them. Teunis Jan sen was quick to appreciate and ready to side with the popular tone in New Amsterdam. He learned from the Heer Yerrenton all the varying phases of the colonies troubles and struggles, as, over his frequent pipes, the old trader stated the facts and drew his inferences. \" This Heer Director lords it over us like a"], [52, "46 DUTCH NEW YORK. Muscovy duke,\" grumbled the old man one day, as he smarted over some fresh disregard by Stuyvesan of the people's desires ; \" he is, even as the Heer Van Dincklagen once said of him, very like a gray wolf \u2014 the longer he lives the worse he bites. What think you to-day, Teunis ? Some of the peo ple from the out-ward came to him to-day complain ing because he had forbidden the farm-hands at the bouweries to ride the goose at the Shrovetide feast. They had asked me to speak for them as one who knew and did not fear the tempers of the Heer Director. But he quickly shut me up. \" I wonder at your fathering such unseemly doing, Heer Yer renton,' he said to me. ' A godly member of the Kerck like you should know that it is both unprofit able and unnecessary to celebrate such pagan and popish feasts!' ' But, Heer Director,' I put in here, 'it is but the people's sport ; it is, as you do know, tolerated in Holland and even winked at here by some of our magistrates \u2014 ' ' Ach, so ! ' broke in milord as if he would have taken off my head, ' tolerated, say you ; winked at, say you ? Then would I have you know, Heer Yerrenton, that I, as the Director for their High Mightinesses will enact such ordinances as will tend to the glory of God without asking the consent of you or your vexing people or your city magistrates. I understand my quality and authority and the nature of my"], [53, "DUTCH NEW YORK. 47 commission and I need neither advice nor inter- cession. It was such little tyrannies as this that tried the temper of the people of the colony \u2014 a mixed pop ulation at the best \u2014 who were already growing restless under the restraints of a purely business autocracy, and were becoming each year more and more desirous of freedom. Men will carelessly ignore or as carelessly accept matters of national policy or importance which touch the abstract rather than the personal in their lives. But an interference with individual possessions or desires speedily arouses the combative faculty. A stop page of their Shrovetide pranks awoke more anger among the people of New Amsterdam than did the information that King Louis of France claimed all North America as his own, or that England had supplanted Holland as the \" Mistress of the seas.\" And, indeed, it was just such petty troubles as this one, over which good Anthony Yerrenton grew so heated, that proved an influence toward the final result \u2014 the downfall of Holland in America. Teunis Jansen was a good house carpenter and even before the winter was over he found no lack of employment. At the Heer Yerrenton's sugges tion he announced himself before the next summer as a master-builder, and paid over to the Director's \" fiscal \" twenty of his small stock of guilders (about"], [54, "48 DUTCH NEW YORK. eio-ht dollars) for what was called the \" small burgher right.\" \" Not that I favor the system, my lad,\" said his old friend; \"in truth, 'tis but another of the Heer Stuyvesant's 'ristocrat antics ; but it may help you get a footing in trade, which is what I wish for you, and it gives you certain privileges which may be of profit. I, myself, though sorely against my judg ment, paid out fifty good guilders for the ' great burgher right ' \u2014 the which doth give me exempt ion from watches, expeditions and arrest and doth make me eligible for selection as schepen, burgo master or councillor. Not that I think much of the affair. I do, indeed, grudge the fifty guilders this burgher right hath cost me. It smacketh too much of barons and manors for a free woodsman such as I. But it may advantage you, my lad.\" Teunis Jansen was possessed of enough of the roving disposition of his ancestors to lead him into the desire for a taste of this same free woodsman's life that the old trapper and trader had referred to. And so, in that very summer of 1658, he joined himself to a party of traders and penetrated into the Indian country beyond the Couxsachraga wilderness and the still farther North. He slept in hazardous security in the 'long house' of the fierce but politic Iroquois, he saw much of savage customs, of wild wood life and the questionable"], [55, "DUTCH NEW YORK. 49 methods of Indian traffic and then returned to New Amsterdam quite ready to settle down and \" stick to his trade.\" But one thing, in particular, he had noted in this spell of wandering and was quite ready to believe Anthony Yerrenton's prophecies of evil concerning it. That was, the unwise sale of arms and liquor to the Indians. \" Time was, lad,\" said the old trader, in the se curity of his chimney corner, \" when it was a crime justly punishable for colonist or trader to sell either guns or rum to the red-skins. We who were first among them saw the danger of this both to the red-skins and ourselves. But the curse of gain is on us all, and for the sake of easy and profitable traffic our people now are ready to give the red skins what may prove our death-warrant if we look not to ourselves. I have no wish for another sea son of '55.\" * And he spoke no idle words ; for the very next year, in 1659, the Indians ravaged the river settle ments and brought death into many a settler's home. And the main cause of the trouble was, so the his torians assure us, the indiscriminate sale of liquor and fire-arms to the Indians. The old records plainly declare that the colonists \" did court and begin \" this latest trouble. * It was in 1655 that the Indians waged a bitter war of retaliation against the Dutch."], [56, "DUTCH NEW YORK. 50 The Indian, never able to resist the fascination of the white man's fire-water and gunpowder, would sacrifice anything in the way of barter to obtain them, and the Indian's appetite and the colonist's greed thus proved disastrous alike to savage and to settler. The colonists of America early learned, though they did not heed, the danger of playing with edge tools. The Dutch West India Company had not made a success with its American possessions. Consider ing these as a source, simply, for revenue from the fur trade, the Company had foolishly ignored all the other possibilities of product and profit that the land afforded ; it had studiously disregarded the interests of the people it had settled there and the measures by which the colonists might have been made a means of strength rather than of loss ; and it had from the first held back when it should have fostered, and tyrannized when it should have been just and generous. English aggression crept slowly on. Acre by acre the patroonships vanished and the Company's territory was curtailed. The Dutch claim to all the South River country was denied ; Long Island and Connecticut were absorbed, and even the right to Manhattan itself was challenged. \" Maryland,\" declared Lord Baltimore's secretary, Calvert, \" ex tends even to the limits of New England.\" \" And"], [57, "DUTCH NEW YORK. 51 New England, so they claim, doth extend to Mary , land,\" said the startled Dutch envoy ; \" where then remains New Netherland ? \" \" That,\" replied Cal vert coolly, \" I do not know.\" At last the end came. In the year 1664 a sort of buccaneering expedition \u2014 illegal because Eng land and Holland were not at war \u2014 was sent from \"I WOULD RATHER BE CARRIED OUT DEAD\"! SAID STUYVESANT. England by the Duke of York to enforce his claims in America. The river and bay were blockaded and Colonel Richard Nicolls, the commander of the expedition, sent to Stuyvesant a summons to \" sur render the towns situate on the island commonly known as Manhattoes with all the forts thereunto belonging.\""], [58, "DUTCH AEW YORK. 52 There was no alternative. The crude little for tress against which the growing town was crowded was in no condition to withstand attack. The peo ple, weary with the neglect of their interest by the wealthy company that should have helped and the home government that should have protected them would oppose no change that might prove of ben efit to them. Resistance might only add to their burdens, and men, women and children alike com bined in petitions to the governor to surrender to the English. \" I would rather be carried out dead,\" burst out the brave but stubborn Stuyvesant. But one man could not stand against the combination of friend and foe The flag of Holland came down from the ramparts of Fort Amsterdam and New Netherland became an English province. That very year, 1664, Teunis Jansen, now a pros perous young burgher of twenty-five, was married to the buxom Grietje Yerrenton, the daughter of his father's old and trusty comrade. And, of so much more importance are our own private concerns than are the changes of dynasties or the fall of states, that the quiet wedding in the little Dutch parlor on De Brugh Straat made more of a stir in the Yerrenton household than did the fall of Fort Amsterdam and the close of Dutch dominion in America."], [59, "53 CHAPTER III THE BEGINNINGS OF ENGLISH RULE. AMES STU ART, Duke of York and Albany, Lord High Admiral of England, bro- ther to King Charles the Sec ond and heir to the crown, was as shrewd and un- scrupulous, as he was despotic and perverse. His father-in-law, Edward Hyde, Earl of Claren don and Lord Chancellor of the Kingdom, was equally selfish and even more shrewd and unscrup ulous. Actuated solely by a selfish desire to increase the power of his princely son-in-law and of his daughter, the duchess, and thus to magnify the importance of the newly-created house of Clarendon, the Chan cellor had planned this identical piratical expedition"], [60, "THE BEGINNINGS OF ENGLLSH RULE. 54 that had destroyed Holland's power in America and created a topic for conversation at Teunis Jansen's wedding. Clarendon foresaw that Duke James would, in all probability, some day become King of England. He also recognized the fact that a patent, or decree, from King Charles giving the disputed New Nether land territory to the Duke would in time revert to the crown. This, the wily politician saw, would create a central and direct royal authority in America; and this in time might draw all the other English possessions within its influence and juris diction, and thereby check the growing disposition to self-rule that was, so this aristocratic king-wor shiper believed, growing altogether too pronounced among the English colonists in America. So the family pride of a tuft-hunting English peer and the grasping avarice of a craven English prince successfully schemed to dispossess the ac knowledged rulers of a growing commercial colony across the broad Atlantic, without question as to the allegiance, or the desires of the people who alone were building up the colony. And thus was attempted, says Dr. Stevens, \" that policy of per sonal rule which, begun under the Catholic Stuart, culminated under the Protestant Hanoverian, a century later, in the oppression which aroused the American Revolution.\""], [61, "THE BEGLNNLNGS OF ENGLISH RULE. 55 The people of the province, more thoughtful of each day's duties or necessities than of the causes of the political move that changed them from Dutch to English allegiance, accepted the transfer without protest. Indeed, as we have seen, a certain public senti ment, in a measure, contributed to this transfer. And, after it was accomplished, the people, in a negative way, welcomed the change of rulers in the hope of a better condition of trade under the vigor ous methods of England. Colonel Nicolls, representing the conquerors, was the sworn partisan of the Duke of York, but he was wise enough to be \" both prudent and concili atory \" toward the conquered. Acting under his suggestion the leading Dutch citizens gave up their original intention of returning to Holland and (including even the obstinate Heer Director Stuyve sant himself) took the oath of allegiance to the Eng lish king. They, it would seem, were shrewd enough to see that loyalty to England, in America, was bet ter for their pockets than hostility to England, in Holland, \u2014 especially when the removal meant an abandonment of promising business interests. The province speedily became English in name and in titles if not in population and in customs. New Amsterdam became New York, Fort Orange Albany, Esopus Kingston, and a code of laws was"], [62, "56 THE BEGINAPNGS OF EATGLLSH RULE. established which granted to the province, in name if not in fact, religious freedom, trial by jury, equal taxation and unhampered possession of property both in lands and slaves. The old-time offices of schepen and burgomaster were abolished and, in their stead, appeared the English form of civic gov ernment, with its mayor, aldermen and sheriff. Old Anthony Yerrenton, English though he was, grumbled more at this last change than did even his own Dutch neighbors. \" A plague on all their foolery! \" he said to Teunis one day when the news came that Captain Thomas Willett was named by Colonel Nicolls as the first \" mayor \" of New York. \" Why not leave well enough alone ? Tom Willett is an honest and able fellow, which is more than one can say of some other of those Plymouth Colony men that have come over here \u2014 jankers* and malcontents most of 'em. Willett, too, hath a better knowledge of our Dutch ways and speech than have most Eng lishmen, but the old ways were best. It all doth smack too much of the palace and the court to suit a rough old woodsman like me.\" Protest however was useless. Both Nicolls and his master, the Duke, were determined not to be troubled in New York by the democratic spirit that * \" Janker \" is an old Dutch verb, meaning to growl or to scold. It was applied by the Dutchmen of New Netherland to their rivals of the Massachusetts colonies, ajid is said to be the original of the word \" Yankee.\""], [63, "THE BEGINNINGS OF ENGLISH RULE. 57 was so apparent in Massachusetts. They would not yield to the wishes of \" men misled by the spirit of independency \" as Colonel Nicolls declared, and the new order of things went into effect notwith standing the protests of the people. But the high-handed method by which England acquired possession of a new province was quickly resented by Holland. That thrifty but inconsist ent republic, when it had once lost what it really did not care to keep, straightway discovered how much, apparently, it did need its meagre foothold on American soil. In a great rage it protested, blustered, demanded and threatened and finally forced England, in 1665, into a declaration of war. For over two years the fleets of England and Holland fought out, in European waters, the con test for the possession of a strip of distant country, three thousand miles across the western sea. The maritime power of the Dutch Republic was well nigh invincible. Success followed success and the war which was closed by the treaty of Breda, in 1667, was in reality a vindication of Holland's naval supremacy. But it was also an assertion of her mercantile shrewdness, quite as well. For, by the terms of the treaty of Breda, Holland, singularly enough, al though gaining its ends gave up the very territory"], [64, "58 THE BEGINNINGS OF ENGLISH RULE. in defence of which it fought. The English re ceived the province of New Netherlands in ex change for the islands of Poleron and Surinam in the East Indian seas, and for Nova Scotia in the north. This was a shrewd bargain for Holland. The spices and highly-valued products of the East Indian islands and the great fish-harvest of Nova Scotia far outweighed in profit the limited fur supply of the New Netherland province. But the states of Holland thus ratified by treaty the very act of piracy which drove them into war. The province of New York, the cause of all this strife and diplomacy, experienced none of the blows of the actual conflict, but it felt what was of even deeper weight \u2014 the woes of complete negligence. \" A fico for all this fighting and trimming,\" grumbled old Anthony Yerrenton as he dandled a chubby little grandson in Teunis Jansen's home ; \" a fico for it all, say I. Of what use is it to us here whether De Ruyter whip or the Duke bears the broom so long as we are dying of doing naught. If we are worth the fighting for we are worth the fostering, and none of this doth England do. Allard Anthony, the sheriff, you know, lad, did tell me but yesterday at the Stadt Huys that the Heer Governor Nicolls declareth that he hath spent every dollar of his own for the needs of the province, and that if the French Mounseers should take it into their"], [65, "THE BEGINNINGS OF ENGLLSH RULE. 59 heads to pounce down upon us from Canada he hath neither men nor means to resist them.\" \" That is true, father,\" responded Teunis ; \" Ser geant Manning of the Fort's garrison told me that his soldiers were sick of a service which promised them little and brought them naught. He says that since they came out of England not one of them hath been in a pair of sheets, or upon any sort of bed but canvas and straw.\" \" Our wharves are rotting and our trade is dead,\" went on old Anthony, simply nodding in approval of his son-in-law's parenthesis ; \" the city streets and palisades are falling to ruin for lack of care, and Cornelis Steenwyck tells me, only this very morning, that the French Mounseers fell upon his last galiot, the Faith, barely off Montauk, and now he hath not a vessel left. And if he had of what profit would it be when our English masters take no heed of our straits and send no battle ships to protect our ports ? \" But as Holland's treaty-demands showed, neither that country nor England regarded the New York province as really worth the fighting for. In 1668 one of the English commissioners, Samuel Mav erick, wrote to the Duke of York, \" Long Island is very poor and inconsiderable, and besides the city of New York, there are but two Dutch towns of any importance, Esopus and Albany.\""], [66, "6o THE BEGINNINGS OF ENGLLSH RULE. Affairs, however, were soon to change for the better. The famous political alliance which the three Protestant governments of England, Holland and Sweden formed (known as the Triple Alliance) brought the opposing interests of Dutch and Eng lish in the New York province into closer and more friendly relations. Business took a fresh start, building operations increased, commerce be tween the colonies grew and the town and province alike felt the impetus of prosperity. Governor Nicolls, wearied with the strain which his govern ment had brought upon him, returned to England in 1668, and Governor Lovelace who succeeded him, though lacking the energy of Nicolls, was selfishly desirous of increasing the importance of his government, and the measures which he adopted had the double effect of serving his own interest and awaking the business energies of the little city. Matters went along with comparative smoothness for several years. The merchants of New York \u2014 few and scant of purse, to be sure, but as eager for gain as their modern successors \u2014 met every Fri day at noon (commencing on March 24, 1670) upon the bridge that spanned the narrow ditch in Broad Street, to discuss and arrange their various financial concerns. And thus was laid the foundation of the New York Exchange. For this very body of slow-going Dutch and English shopkeepers, who"], [67, "THE FIRST NEW YORK EXCHANGE."], [68, ""], [69, "THE BEGLNNLNGS OF ENGLLSH RULE. 63 spent their Friday mornings in the open-air closing their transactions and dodging the flying sleds of the boyish coasters, grew at last into that powerful association of merchants which for years has guided or manipulated the monetary transactions of half the world. The outlying towns, too, grew slowly but surely. In the North Albany was developing from a border trading post into a compact and well-ordered town; the little palisaded settlement of Schenectady was obtaining a firm footing in the valley of the Mo hawk ; Esopus, or Kingston, further down the Hud son, was a growing midway station between New York and Albany, while the Long Island towns some dozen in number from Brooklyn and Bush wick eastward to the Hamptons, though always more inclined to affiliate with the Connecticut and Massachusetts colonies, were still part of the pro vince of New York and seemed, some of them, almost as thriving commercially as they do to-day. But in 1672 came another change. The \"Triple Alliance \" was broken ; England and Holland once again were foes ; and one fine August morning in the year 1673 Teunis Jansen rushed into his father in-law's house on the Bridge Street with the start ling information that a Dutch fleet of twenty-seven ships was anchored off Staten Island and there was likely to be a row."], [70, "64 THE BEGLNNLNGS OF ENGLLSH RULE. \" A black murrain on kings and princes,\" broke out democratic old Anthony, flinging down his pipe upon his goode vrouw's well-sanded floor and springing to his feet, \" are we never to be in comfort in this badgered town? Here's the Heer Governor off a-junketing in Connecticut, and no one but that chicken-hearted Manning in command at the Fort. We all be Dutch again, lad, before to-morrow's sun.\" And the old man was right. Captain John Man ning in command at the fort had neither the pluck nor the desire to defend an almost defenceless town against the attack of sixteen hundred hardy Dutch fighters. When, therefore, he heard that certain of the compatriots of the invaders among the burgh ers of the town had gone out in a body to meet and welcome the six hundred men who had just been landed from the fleet he pulled down the English flag from the fort and surrendered his post without a blow. So New York became Dutch again. The old order of things was restored, and Captain Anthony Colve became Governor-General of the captured province. But, as usual, New York was a shuttlecock for European kings and statesmen rather than the property of its own people. The States General of Holland felt that they could not long keep"], [71, "THE BEGLNNLNGS OF ENGLLSH RULE. 65 peaceable possession of a country so hemmed in by English-speaking . folk and before a year had passed, in July, 1674, news came to the little city by the sea that it had been given up by Holland and that it was once again a province of England. \" Well, well,\" commented old Anthony Yerrenton as he heard the news, \" it matters little to us who may be our masters, since masters I suppose we must have. I told Cornelis Steenwyck when he and the other Dutch merchants sent over their petition and remonstrance to the States General that they would have only their labor for their pains. If this land is to be English why, then, English it will be and it is far wiser for us to strengthen our own homes than weaken 'em by courting an impossibility. We're the Duke's peo ple still and it is better for us to strive for the English shillings rather than sigh for the Dutch guilders.\" Again the old man was right. The Duke of York, learning wisdom from experience, obtained from his brother, the king, a new patent of posses sion that gave him greater powers than before, but he modified his autocratic possibilities by conces sions to the \" people \" whom, as a class, he hated and yet was shrewd enough to favor.

The next day the official transfer of the province from Dutch to English rulers was made at the Stadt Huys, or City Hall, on the Strand, or water-side (now Pearl Street), and the New Netherlands became again, and for all future time, New York. The power of Holland in America had come to an end. Sixty years of misrule had but served to display the weakness and negligence of a merely mercantile autocracy. Regardful only of personal profit it had deliberately neglected those ways of wisdom and of statesmanship which might have made the province of the New Netherlands a self supporting- colony, a foothold for Dutch sovereignty in America, and thus perhaps materially have changed the future history of the American people. For all their failures and for all their losses in these new lands across the sea, the Dutch West India Company and the States General of Holland had only themselves to thank, for theirs had been a record of selfishness, of negligence, of procrastina tion and of greed. But the people whom their brief era of occupancy had drawn to America were of the true Dutch stock.

The spirit that grew into that demand for per sonal liberty made fact by the American Revolu tion could scarcely have gained force or form had Holland been less tolerant or the New Netherlands less conservative. Beneath the corner-stone of the American Republic lies the strong supporting soil of Dutch liberty, Dutch toleration and Dutch integrity. A trooper by education and experience Major Edmund Andros brought to the performance of his official duties that uncompromising military spirit that demands all and is tolerant of no opposition. The leading Dutch burghers who, rightfully, desired to be assured of religious freedom and exemption from bearing arms against their home-land of Hol land were declared mutinous and seditious and placed under arrest.

The thrifty Duke of York was in need of money and although he insisted that such conces sions to the people were worse than useless and \" hazardous to the peace of the government,\" he finally made the concession as a matter of bargain and sale, agreeing that if the people of the province Would raise sufficient money to pay off the public debt he would \" condescend \" to their desires. The right of representation thus grudgingly sold to the very people to whom it, in justice, belonged was among the earliest steps in the advance toward popular sovereignty in America.

Teunis Jansen, now growing into middle life, was one of those who most ardently desired and most joyfully welcomed this earliest recognition in America of the \" people \" by their kingly masters. \" It means a great deal, does it not, father ? \" he said to old Anthony Yerrenton as, together, they discussed the \" Charter of Liberties \" that the assembly had passed. \" ' No aid, tax, custom, loan, benevolence, or imposition whatever,' they declare, ' shall be levied within this province under any pre tence, but by the consent of the governor, council and representatives of the people in general assem bly.' Does not that mean a better day for the province and the people ? \" \" It does indeed, my son,\" said wise old Anthony,"], [78, "72 THE BEGINNINGS OF ENGLLSH RULE. \"it does indeed \u2014 if it be allowed. But mark my word, Duke James is not the man to allow it. This Charter of Liberties, even though he may seem to concede it now, will never be permitted to stand.\" And so it proved. For when, in 1685, the Duke James became, by the death of his brother Charles, King James of England, one of his first acts was to contemptuously repudiate the people's Charter on the ground that it allowed too much liberty, and thereupon he proceeded at once to consolidate and strengthen his power in America by uniting 'all the Northeastern colonies from Maine to New York into the single department of the Domin ion of New England. A more impolitic measure could not have been attempted. The antagonisms between Dutchman and \" Yankee \" were yet all too pronounced to make union possible. Bickerings and cross-petitions, charges and counter-charges were frequent, and the \" Dominion of New Eng land,\" as we shall see, speedily resolved itself into its original conditions. The revenge of the people for this royal repudi ation of a solemn charter of rights was to come, however, and sooner than they could anticipate.

But the aristocracy of the province were luke warm in their allegiance. The little clique of \" first families \" that sought to arrogate the authority to themselves and ape the manners of the English court in the little stockaded towns of a Western wilderness hesitated to desert a king*; whose favor they had so long coveted. When once assured that the change of rulers was absolute, they sought to themselves assume the leadership to the exclu sion of the people. But the people had already caught the inspiration of resistance.

No man has been more maligned or misunder stood than Jacob Leisler. Historians have delib erately misjudged him, drawing their conclusions from the biased reports of the few aristocrats who hated or the English officials who despised him. Jacob Leisler was one of the earliest of American patriots. His brief and stormy career as provin cial governor of New York was marked by mis takes of judgment, but his mistakes were more than overbalanced by his foresight and statesman ship. He acted as one of the people for the people. He summoned a popular convention, arranged the first mayoralty election by the people, attempted the first step toward colonial union by endeavoring to interest the several provinces in a continental congress and sought to cripple the chief adversary of the English in America, France, by the masterly stroke of an invasion of Canada. That he failed is due to the jealousy, the timidity and the short sightedness of his fellow-colonists. But he builded"], [81, "THE BEGINNINGS OF ENGLISH RULE. 75 wiser than he knew, for though he died a martyr to colonial jealousy and English injustice his bold and patriotic measures awoke the people to a knowledge of their real power and prepared them for that spirit of resistance to tyranny which made them a century later a free republic* Leisler was hanged for usurpation and treason May 15, 1 69 1, by the officers of the very king whom he had sought to strengthen and maintain, and at the instigation of the aristocratic clique who feared and hated him.

New York again become a separate and independent province, and the rule of the people was for a time postponed. But in the midst of the Leislerian troubles, the affairs of the province were for a while forgotten in the little house on Pearl Street.

To the foresight and efforts of an honest Dutchman of the Mohawk Valley was due the settlement of what has been termed \"the most momentous and far-reaching question ever brought to issue on this continent,\" namely : whose, of the white conquerors, should be the ownership of the North American Continent? This question was settled by the peaceful but diplomatic policy of the Heer Arendt Van Curler. Appreciating the value of the Indian's friendship in maintaining the security of a growing State, he concluded a treaty of peace with the dominant native power \u2014 the Iroquois of Central New York. By a simple act of faith well-kept he shat tered the warlike measures and the intricate diplomacies alike of French governor and Jesuit priest and made his Indian allies so loyal to \"the covenant of Corlaer \" that suc ceeding Dutch and English rulers found but little trouble in keeping a band of ferocious foemen true to the pledges made to this earliest of New York statesmen. The title \" Corlaer \" was given by the Indians to all future governors of New York.

The close of the Leislerian troubles found Teu nis an honest and hard-working citizen of very moderate means but with a small and substantial house on the Winckel Street, not far away from the one from which he had taken his wife. His eldest son, also a Teunis Jansen, was already well on toward manhood and had started a little home of his own on one of the new streets near the \" clover pasture \" \u2014 now Pine Street. A second son, with something of the roving disposition of his grand father, had never returned from the expedition which Governor Leisler had hoped to see en a;ao*e in the successful invasion of Canada. His mother mourned the wandering spirit of her absent boy, but his father had heard of him as being a successful trapper and trader among the friendly Indians, and knew that the time would come when the lad would drop into more settled ways and per haps found a home for himself in the attractive lands about the distant Mohawk. The schooling that the boys and girls obtained in those far-off days was limited but sturdy. The sons and daughters of Teunis Jansen were skilled in the elements only and were none of them"], [85, "GOING TO SCHOOL IN 1700."], [86, ""], [87, "UNDER THE ROYAL GOVERNORS. 81 over-proficient in those. But in that era of begin nings literary attainments were not so needful as were muscle for labor and wit for trade. So the children and grandchildren of Teunis Jansen were furnished with just sufficient \" book-learning \" to enable them to reckon in Dutch and Enolish money, to write a fairly intelligible letter and to have their catechism at their tongues' ends. The girls, however, were experts in all housewifely duties and the boys were familiar with one or the other of the \" handicraft trades \" at which very early in life they must learn to \" turn their hands.\" There was already a cosmopolitan air about the little city at the mouth of the Hudson \u2014 a flavor of fusing nationalities which was to a certain extent prophetic of the character of the future metropolis. The Dutch traditions and the cus toms of the original settlers clung tenaciously to the daily life of the town ; the Dutch element still led in point of numbers ; but a large share of the inhabitants was composed of other nationalities. The river settlements were even more distinctively Dutch, but the Long Island towns were strongly English and in the trading posts and border set tlements at the north was noticeable a strong in fusion of French blood from across the Canadian border. It was this very Canadian border that, for at"], [88, "82 UNDER THE ROYAL GOVERNORS. least one half the eighteenth century, was to be the source of excitement to the New York colony, the problem of royal governors and the ever pres ent excuse for slowness in tax returns which the dilatory colonist invariably fell back upon. From the day when the \"corsairs\" and explorers of France claimed all North America for their Lord the King, France and England had been in open dispute as to the extent and limit of the Canadian frontiers. Only the loyalty of the real owners of the soil \u2014 the freedom-loving Iroquois of Central New York \u2014 to their treaties of friend ship with the Dutch settlers of New York and with their English successors kept the arms of France at bay. The Iroquois were the real bul wark of English occupation. Frontenac, most restless and most picturesque of all the French governors of Canada was as shrewd as he was fearless, and his plans for the invasion and conquest of the English possessions were skill fully laid and often fatally near to successful execu tion. The massacre at Schenectady during the disturbed days of Leisler's times was one of these sudden incursions. Frontenac, through all his long career as governor of Canada, was the bug bear of the New York colonists and he, indeed, was ever alert and aggressive and impatient of any delay that kept him from his plans of conquest."], [89, "83 UNDER THE ROYAL GOVERNORS. For nearly twenty years after the death of Leis ler the governors sent by the English King to direct the affairs of New York were of the worst possible stamp. Their very greed and incompe tency however only served to strengthen the grow ing desire of the people toward self-government. Sloughter and Ingolsby, Fletcher and Bellomont, Nanfan, Cornbury and Lovelace \u2014 not one of these during his brief and profitless lease of authority seems to have been possessed of any desire beyond self or to have known any interest save his own. The \"general assembly\" which King James had abolished was again submitted to by King William, but its powers and authority were limited. The \" Governor's Council \" was selected by royal ap pointment and had little in sympathy with the peo ple, whom it seldom represented. Assembly and council, governors and people were in continual op position and, frequently, in outspoken antagonism. It was during this time that sorrow came to the household of Teunis Jansen. One of his grand sons \" went wrong.\" A bright young fellow and a lover of the sea, young Abram Jansen shipped for a sailor and made numerous voyages with one Captain William Kidd, a New York sea-captain who had a pleasant house on Liberty Street and who for years had sailed a packet ship between New York and London. Captain Kidd had taken a fancy"], [90, "84 UNDER THE ROYAL GOVERNORS. to young Abram Jansen and given him a berth on his packet. But suddenly, one August day in 1698, dark rumors came to New York. Captain Kidd though sent aboard to stamp out piracy had himself turned pirate. He had raised the black flag and, using the very ship which the Gov ernment had given him, he \" swept the seas with \u2022little regard to the laws of property,\" and \"made his name a terror to honest merchantmen.\" Abram Jansen followed his captain's lead and was killed in a desperate sea-fight in East Indian waters. Kidd himself was at last captured, tried for piracy, found guilty and executed, May 10, 1701,* and the presumed connection with his illegal traffic which was charged against leading citizens of New York even including its governor, Bellomont, was for years a scandal and a stain on the good name of the colony. But nowhere did the stain fall deeper or more grievously than upon the little houses on the Winckel Street and in the Clover Pasture where grandparents and parents mourned the lapse of their dearly-loved sailor lad into wicked and fatal ways. With the coming of Governor Robert Hunter in June, 1 710, brighter days seemed to dawn on the slowly growing colony. Trade and colonization both increased under his intelligent direction of affairs. In 1711, three thousand German refugees, * Recent investigations throw much doubt on the criminality of this celebrated sea-rover. \"To-day,\" says Mr. Fernow, \" that which was meted out to Kidd might hardly be called jus tice ; for it seems questionable if he bad ever been guilty of piracy.\""], [91, "UNDER THE ROYAL GOVERNORS. 85 flying from the anguish and starvation of the \" Thirty Years War,\" emigrated in a body to New York and locating first on the lands of the Livinsf ston Manor on the Hudson finally procured lands of the Indians in the Mohawk Valley and helped to build up that fertile and beautiful section. Pala tine Bridge and German Flats still carry in their present names the memory of these war-worried refugees from the disturbed \" Palatinate.\" The development and growth of a people must be by slow stages so long as the development is hampered and the growth hindered by the arro gance, the interference or the indifference of a pa rent government far away. The British governors were but the representatives of their government three thousand miles across a stormy and treacher ous ocean. Commerce grew slowly and trade was impeded by the indisposition of the home govern ment to allow its colonies to attend to their own business in their own way. But as desire grew so did determination, and it was but a sign of the sturdy and strengthening progress of the popular will to find the New York Assembly declaring in 171 1 that it was its \"inherent right\" as the rep resentatives of the colony \" to act not from the grant of the crown, but from the free choice of the people, who ought not, nor justly can be divested of their property without their consent.\" This"], [92, "86 UNDER THE ROYAL GOVERNORS. determination grew with each new year, and though it was sternly repressed by the powers across the sea as tending too much \" to independency of the crown \" neither king nor governor, council nor \" Lords of Trade \" could long hold in check the actions of a people feeling their way toward liberty. The fifteen royal governors who ruled the pro vince during the three quarters of a century that intervened between the year 1 700 and the Revolu tion spent a large portion of their time in combat ing this very \" spirit of independency \" that their masters in England denounced. They did little for the real interests of the colony, and their names are almost as entirely forgotten as are their doings and their acts.

Father and son, Teunis Jansen and Teunis the younger, were a part of this slowly advancing march of the people. The lad who in 1657 had, with so many hopes and so much wondering, first viewed from the deck of the Gilded Beaver the little town with its fort, its church and its few straggling houses, had grown into its life and its ambitions with the other unknown and silent workers who like him had helped on the growth of the struggling town and the far-reaching border province. After all it is the quiet majority of whom little is known beyond their own home circles, who render the prominence and power of the minority possible, and when in 171 7 Teunis, the emigrant of 1657, now an old man of eighty, died in his little house in the Winckel Street few outside his limited circle of acquaintances and fellow workers noted his departure or recognized the value of such humble workers as was he upon the real foundations of a mighty nation. His son Teunis died in 1744. The \"Clover Pastures\" had become a part of the city's slowly extending streets and he, too, like his father though only a"], [94, "88 UNDER THE.

Another Teunis took up his father's work and joined like him in the advancing march of public opinion that was compelling governors and councils to recognize and combat the cause of popular liberty. Gradually the settlements were encroaching upon the wilderness. Agriculture and commerce were reclaiming more and more of the forest lands and building up the traffic of sea and river and dusty highway. The colony increased in population to nearly one hundred thousand in 1756. Its outly ing possessions in Connecticut and Massachusetts and far-off Pemaquid in Maine had long since been given up to the sister colonies to whom they more naturally belonged, but its trading posts were growing into towns and around its frontier forts and block houses new settlements were constantly springing up. Wars and rumors of wars still disturbed its peace and often paralyzed its industries. In 171 1 Leisler's bold plan of weakening the French power in America by an English invasion of Canada was advocated by Peter Schuyler and agreed to by the home government.

Misman agement, shipwreck and timidity drove back the Boston forces and the rank and file of the little New York army returned to their homes with no result reached save the opening of the northern frontiers to the old story of surprise and massacre. Little actual war, however, occurred during the first half of the eighteenth century and, save for the ever-constant terror of French and Indian incursion there need have been no bar to a healthy growth of the colony had the royal governors been governors in fact.

The border settlements were in continual danger. Block houses and rude forts sprung up for frontier defences from Albany and Lake Champlain westward as far as Oswego, while even within sound of the ceaseless thunders of Niagara the strife for possession increased the natural jealousies of race divisions. And still, in spite of wars and rumors of wars, life in the slowly-growing Dutch-English colony went on quietly enough. There were marryings and givings in marriage, there were christenings and betrothals, there were schoolings and 'prentic ings, winnings and losings, household hopes and sorrows, joys and fears, as well in the manor-house of the patroon and the mansion of the \" aristocrat \" as in the \" bouwerie \" of the farmer and the squat little town-house of just such commonplace people as were these Jansens of New York. The family was growing numerous now. Sons and daughters, grandchildren and great-grand children were finding and founding homes of their own, names were changing and interchanging and all the puzzling intricacies of Dutch relationships were scattering the descendants of Teunis Jansen throughout the little colony. The girls were farm ers' wives or burghers' \" goode vrouws,\" carding"], [99, "UNDER THE ROYAL GOVERNORS. 93 and spinning, sweeping and dusting, hoarding up linen for their own daughters' wedding days and bringing up their girls and boys to steady, hard working, little-expecting, God-fearing lives. The boys were getting footholds at home or abroad \u2014 the more adventurous or ambitious ones pushing out, spite of the terror of the Indian arrow and the dread of the French harquebuse, into the fertile farmlands to the North and West. A Jansen was fur-trading at Oswego, selling duffel cloth at Albany, farming near old Fort Stanwix (now Rome), fighting for the king at Crown Point and at Niagara, placidly counting his sheaves at Esopus, setting his traps in the lake country, or trafficking with the Indians in the company of the ten young men who, in 1720, penetrated into the very heart of the Indian country with young Philip Schuyler, or with the forty who, later still, made their homes among the friendly Iroquois, pioneers of the civ ilization that was soon to follow after them. For, in the face of hardship and obstacles, in spite of the dangers at home and the disastrous policy of the English rulers the trade of the New York colony was steadily and strongly increasing.

The colonial assembly, the nearest approach to a direct representation of the people, grew gradually more and more assertive. The assembly of 1737 in its address to Governor Clarke boldly declared the right of the people to be \" protected in the enjoyment of their liberties and properties \" and announced its determination not to vote a penny of revenue or support \" until such laws are passed as we conceive necessary for the safety of the in habitants of this colony, who have reposed a trust in us for that only purpose, and by the grace of God we will endeavor not to deceive them.\" But England learned nothing from declaration and protest.

Land frauds, Indian frauds, commercial frauds, false returns and even falser methods, illicit trading, smuggling and piracy \u2014 these were matters of common report, while the prevalence"], [104, "98 UNDER THE ROYAL GOVERNORS. of drunkenness and other social evils were both a barrier and a reaction to entire development. Even in Stuyvesant's day it is reported that fully one fourth of the houses in New Amsterdam were devoted to the sale of brandy, tobacco and beer, and as Mr. Roberts observes, \" their existence tells the story of the habits of the people.\" Chaplain Miller in 1695 says that \"so soon as the bounty of God has furnished this people with a plentiful crop, they do turn the money into drink,\" and through out the colonial days the jealousies between the \" aristocrats \" and the people were too often aggra vated by the wide-spread use of rum. It was when Governor Sloughter was \" besotted with drink \" that he signed the illegal death-warrant of Leisler ; it was when the informer Kane was possessed by the \" fumes of the liquor of the tavern \" that he foisted upon the terrified colonists the lying details of the shameful \" negro plot \" ; it was when the representative of the most powerful family in the province \u2014 Chief Justice DeLancey \u2014 and Gov ernor George Clinton, the proxy of the king, were \" in their cups \" that a personal quarrel led to antagonisms that threatened the welfare of the colony.

The border warfare of a hundred and fifty years that ended only with England's historic victory upon the Plains of Abraham ; the constant boun dary troubles that England's needless delays fast ened upon the settlers in New York and their adjoining colonial neighbors ; even the party hates and personal rancors of family jealousies and the sharply-drawn lines between \" aristocrats \" and com mons, Episcopalians and Presbyterians, all had a certain good effect in the resolution and determin ation that they engendered, and by means of which liberty was to be finally accomplished. Out of Leisler's colonial congress of 1690, and that at Albany in 1754, as well as from the self respecting assemblies that intervened and dared to tell the British government so many plain and unwelcome truths came the greater Continental Congresses of 1764 and 1774 and the colonial resistance that broadened into national revolt."], [106, "100 UNDER THE ROYAL GOVERNORS.

And so, excited and aroused as people are apt to be at sea sons of great national peril, young and old, rich and poor, man and woman, boy and girl clamored against the tyranny of England. While the young Teunis Jansen of that day joined the \" Sons of Liberty \" and helped post up the famous \" We Dare \" placard upon office doors and street corners his youngest brother, Ryck Jansen, tagged at the heels of the street crowds that wandered from point to point on that historic First of November, 1765, and sung out as lustily and as unmusically as any one of them the ringing- chorus : \" With the beasts of the wood, We will ramble for food, And lodge in wild deserts and caves, And live poor as Job, On the skirts of the globe Before we'll submit to be slaves, brave boys, Before we'll submit to be slaves.\""], [107, "CHAPTER V, A COLONIAL BARON.

New York, as neither royal governor nor colonial magnate was able to do. His story is one of the most striking as it is one of the most important phases in the history of the beginnings and the development of the Empire State; and it is pe culiarly fitting for us to consider it here, ere we proceed with that later section of the story of the state in whose beginnings this young Irish adventurer bore so prominent a part. Young William Johnson came as factor or super intendent for his maternal uncle Sir Peter Warren, the English admiral, who, following the example of other English nabobs had purchased from the Indians a large tract of fertile country within the limits of the Mohawk Valley. The section was alike historic, picturesque and full of singular interest. For us the pen of Cooper has described and painted its beauties, its romances and its stirring scenes. But its history is even stranger than its fiction, and as the prelude to its later story possesses a singular and especial interest. Beyond the Schenectady wilderness and west ward a good day's journey from the rude fortress walls of Albany stretched in the earlier days a tract of country into which for years only trappers and traders had dared to penetrate and which, even in the middle of the eighteenth century, was still"], [109, "A COLONIAL BARON. 103 an unknown and almost unexplored region to the settlers about Manhattan Island and along; the shores of the Hudson. And yet, though known only to the most advent urous and most restless of the colonists of the New World it was for years the battle ground of two nations. Fertile, promising, and rich in furs and peltries, bounded on the north by vast inland seas and watered by beautiful streams and still more beautiful lakes, this section, known as \" the Indian country,\" was so attractive a land for trade and settlement that with each new year, while France and England were both struggling to pos sess it, the pioneers of colonization were venturing into it under the protection of the colonial gover nors of New York and the colonial \" barons \" who were monopolizing its possession by direct purchase from its Indian proprietors. For nearly three hundred years this splendid stretch of country had been the seat of one of the most remarkable barbaric confederacies that the world has known. The six nations of Indians, best known by the French name of Iroquois, though called by themselves, always, the Hodeno saunee or \" people of the long house,\" lived here as citizens of an unvincible forest republic. Ambi tious, warlike, haughty and free they had risen to a station in the rank of semi-civilization quite above"], [110, "104 A COLONIAL BARON. that of any other Indian nation and their authority and mastership were acknowledged by the sur rounding tribes from the rivers of Virginia to the shores of Hudson's Bay and from the New Eng land coast to the banks of the Mississippi. The statesmanship of Arendt Van Curler se cured their friendship in the early Dutch days ; and, because of this, his Dutch and English successors in the provinces were, until the Revolution, able to maintain their possession of the entire lake region. It was the constant loyalty of the Iroquois confederacy to the British king that enabled Eng land finally to become master of Canada, and it was upon lands purchased from them that the slowly growing settlements of English colonists began gradually to build and develop the now thriving home-land of Central New York. The most easterly of the Six Nations was the tribe known as the Mohawks. Their lands com prised that section now celebrated as the beautiful valley of the Mohawk, and they were regarded as the real head \u2014 the brain and leaders of the Iro quois Confederacy. The settlements of the white man gradually increased in their land, but so cautiously and craftily was this advance made and guarded that the Indian still remained the white man's friend, even though he saw and appreciated the slow"], [111, "A COLONIAL BARON. 105 absorption of his home-land. That so brave and dominant a race impatient of control and ambi tious for authority should permit themselves to be thus pushed and crowded from their lands would be one of the problems of history could it not be explained by two important causes \u2014 the white man's craftiness and the white man's rum. Against these the Indians of America were never able successfully to contend. Many a young man from the older settlements went from his home to seek his fortune in the Iro quois country. Dutch patroons and English land owners began to lease, sell, and cultivate the great tracts of land they had secured from the Indian proprietors, and one day in the year 1763 young Isaac Jansen, the youngest brother of Teunis the elder, then scarce twenty years of age, announced to his eldest brother, who was recognized as the head of the family, his intention of trying his luck in the Iroquois country. \u2022 It was of no use for Teunis the elder to object. The Jansens had ever possessed the roving strain in their blood from the days of their sea-faring and fur-trading ancestors of three centuries back. \" Well, what are your chances, lad ? \" he de manded of this would-be pioneeer. And young Isaac told how one of the Van Ness boys had an engagement to go as farrier to Sir"], [112, "106 A COLONIAL BARON. William Johnson's \"castle \" in the Mohawk Valley and how, too, young Van Ness had been able to get for him (Isaac) the promise of steady work at his trade of carpentering in the patroon's new settle ment of Johnstown. \" Go then, lad, and the Lord be with you,\" said the elder brother when Isaac had detailed his expectations. \" You won't be the first Jansen who has struck out into the wilderness.\" And adding to his brother's slender outfit a share of his own hardly-earned shillings Teunis bade young Isaac God-speed and together the two adventurous lads set their backs to their native town and their faces toward their fortune. To both these young fellows as to many another restless lad in the colony, had come frequent rumors of this most fascinating and enticing of all the \" patroons \" \u2014 Sir William Johnson : how he had risen from a mere lad to a power greater than that of many a lord and -baron across the water ; how he lived in a stone castle in the midst of surroundings calculated to drive an adventurous boy frantic with emulation ; they had heard and repeated the wonderful accounts of Sir William's vast estate ; of his loyal and successful tenantry ; of his army of scouts and trappers, of hunters and rangers ; of his thousands of Indian allies and how he had been made the great White Chief"], [113, "ISAAC JANSEN GOES TO THE INDIAN COUNTRY."], [114, ""], [115, "A COLONIAL BARON. 109 of the Iroquois nations. All these and many other reports they had heard \u2014 some of them exaggerated and fabulous, but unquestioningly ac cepted as fact by the ambitious boys who chafed under home restraints and longed for the free, unfettered life of the forest and the rivers of this wonderful Indian country. And to a certain extent the stories that had floated down the Hudson from the Mohawk coun try were true. The Irish lad of 173S had within less than twenty-five years become a great feudul baron of colonial New York. Succeeding even beyond his own expectations as his uncle's factor he had purchased for his own use extensive tracts in the Mohawk Valley, had developed both his own and his uncle's estate to most productive issues, had settled a thrifty tenantry upon his lands, won the friendship and loyalty of the Indian tribes into whose lands he had come, and because of his remarkable success in keeping them in friendly relations to< the English authorities had been hon ored with important offices and trusts by the home government. A fearless and impetuous soldier he had led the provincial militia in some of the fiercest battles of \" the French and Indian war,\" and had been created by his king \" Major General and Sir \" William Johnson for intrepid and valuable services. More than any other man, in all the long history of"], [116, "110 A COLONIAL BARON. the frontier troubles that ended at last in the inva sion of Canada and the fall of Quebec, he had kept the Iroquois in alliance with England, successfully combating the \" diplomacy \" of French statesmen and the craft of French Jesuits, and had been admitted within the circle of Indian tribal ties as a comrade and a chieftain under the Mohawk name of Warra-ghi-yagey \u2014 the Great Brother. It was into the domains of this remarkable man, now in the prime of life and at the height of his power, that young Isaac Jansen and Abram Van Ness came in the year 1763. Isaac came as car penter and laborer, but more stirring work than building cabins and framing doors and windows was in store for him. The war with the Indians, roused to indignant and murderous protest by their greatest patriot \u2014 Pontiac, Chief of the Ottawas \u2014 was raging with fury along the western border, and almost the first experience that young Isaac Jansen met with in his new home was to help build the strong stockade with which Sir William surrounded Johnson Hall, and to arm with the other tenantry of the pro vincial baronet for its protection and defence. The strong stone towers that flanked this stockade and the brass cannon that defended them (captured by Admiral Warren at the siege of Louisburg) proved a stronger argument with the wavering"], [117, "A COLONIAL BARON. 111 Iroquois than did Pontiac's appeals. The North ern tribes who had been almost persuaded to join the Ottawa Chieftain declared their determination not to \" take up the hatchet,\" but at the same time announced their readiness, if Sir William was molested, to take it up valiantly in defence of their Great \" Brother.\" Sir William's shrewdness and courage and his firm but friendly attitude toward his Indian allies alone saved New York from the horrors of the border war that laid waste the western frontier and immortalized the name of Pontiac \u2014 the \" Napoleon of the Indians.\" At last the war was over. Pontiac, defeated and deserted by his followers, returned from his inter view with Sir William Johnson in 1766, to die by the tomahawk of a faithless Illinois, and the man who had been the main bulwark of New York against massacre and desolation devoted himself to the development of his splendid estate. Once again, in 1768, was Sir William Johnson's great influence with the Iroquois needed to resist disaster. As just in his dealings with them as he was shrewd and far-seeing, he sided with them in the dispute over the occupation by white settlers of the great tract in Northern New York, known as the Kaya-de-ros-seras patent \u2014 a vast section of valuable land obtained by fraud and occupied in"], [118, "A COLONIAL BARON. 112 spite of the protests of its native owners. The Iroquois indignant at the broken faith and arrogant claims of the colonial authorities threatened to take up the hatchet in defence of their rights, and had not the wisdom of Sir William Johnson awakened the colonial \" proprietories \" to a sense of their folly and injustice, and induced them by the payment to the Indians of five thousand dollars to purchase the lands they had stolen, a bloodier chapter than any yet known in the story of New York would need to have been written. By this means seven hundred thousand acres lying between the Hudson and the Mohawk, were opened to colonization and civ ilization, and the name of Sir William Johnson more than ever before became the synonym of justice among the Indians and of influence among the colonists. It was by measures such as this that the fer tile region of Central New York was won from barbarism and secured for civilization. Here and there new settlements were made and new indus tries sprung up. Isaac Jansen, a hardy and vigo rous young pioneer, found favor in the eyes of \" the patroon \" and had charge and oversight of much of the building that the era of peace brought about. The \" patroon's \" own settlement of Johnstown, near to his mansion of Johnson Hall, grew into quite a flourishing village and the estate itself increased"], [119, "A CO LO AVAL BARON. 113 in productiveness and beauty. The wilderness that the young Irish lad had found through all the valley of the Mohawk, thirty years before, was now a region of rich farms, beautiful meadows and homes of rude but genial plenty. The Indians were be coming agriculturists and steadfastly resisted all attempts of French or Spanish \" diplomats \" to swerve them from their allegiance to the English king; and their own \" Great Brother.\" Thus the eve of the Revolution found the region known as Central New York. The increase in settlement was bringing a sturdy company of work ers within its limits, and even that hot and bitter sued as to boundaries known as the trouble of the New Hampshire Grants could not stop the tide of colonization. The county of Albany, upon petition of its inhabitants, was divided into three new coun ties and the busy little village of Johnstown was made the county town of the new county of Tryon (named for the then acting colonial governor). Sir William Johnson was at this time the most influential man in the province of New York. Beloved by his tenantry, trusted by his Indian neighbors, honored by his king, his influence was uni versally acknowledged and his integrity was unques tioned. He was one of the very few American baronets. He was the superintendent of the Northern Indians, a member of the king's council,"], [120, "114 A COLONLAL BARON. a major-general commanding a well-disciplined force of fourteen hundred provincial militia, an owner of large estates and an energetic promoter of every plan of public benefit. \" Sir William has too much influence,\" declared one rather pessimistic patriot to Isaac Jansen as they talked of the attainments and successes of the patroon. \" He can carry anything he pleases now. He returns two members to the assembly by his nod, and can direct the election of the Albany and Schenectady members as he pleases.\" \" I wish his influence were twice as great,\" replied the loyal Isaac, always enthusiastic in support of his generous patroon ; \" for one thing we are sure of and that is, 'tis both his inclination and his interest to use all his influence for the good of the province.\" But the day that was to change all this condition of personal power was at hand. The spirit of those same \" Sons of Liberty \" who had withstood the \"hirelings of tyranny\" at Golden Hill and lustily shouted their revolutionary choruses in the streets of New York found its way even beyond the northern wilderness.

For upon that little hill covering the portion of what is now John Street, between Cliff Street and Burling Slip, the first blood of the Revolution was shed. A year later actual war began. The colonists, pushed to desperation by the continued tyranny of England, met force with force ; and on Sunday the twenty-second of April, 1775, Teunis was among the throng that coming out of the Garden Street church heard the news which a hard-riding courier brought down the Bowery road and into the little city, how on a pleasant country highway, two hun dred miles to the eastward, the colonists and the king's troops had met and fought the historic battle of Lexington.

Its superiority was universally admitted and it was re ceived with great favor not only in the State, but elsewhere. . . . All the State constitutions rec ognized in express terms the natural and absolute right of every man to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, yet the consti tutions of New York and Virginia alone were free from provisions repugnant to these declarations.\" This remarkable instrument was, practically, the work of three young men \u2014 John Jay, Robert R. Livingston and Gouverneur Morris. Adopted by the convention assembled at Kingston on the twentieth of April, 1777, it was formally published on the morning of Tuesday, the twenty-second, when, mounting upon a barrel in front of the county courthouse of Kingston, Robert Benson, the Secretary of the Convention, surrounded by his fellow officers and members, read the docu ment to the assembled people who had been sum moned to hear it by the bell of the village church. But the people found what was to them more important business than constitution-making and governing when with the close of the war they"], [140, "LIBERTY. 134 came to their own again. Seven years of conflict had demoralized and destroyed the trade and para lyzed the industries of the community; the State, like the infant that it was, needed almost to begin life over again. So, while their leaders were legislating, the peo ple set to work. And so valiantly did they apply themselves that in less than five years after the actual evacuation of New York by the British both the city and the State were on the high road to prosperity. In the scarcely reclaimed interior where the desolation of war had well-nigh made the country once more a wilderness the activities of peace gave new vigor to the people. Within sight of those hotly-contested fields of Oriskany and Saratoga the people who had won now pre pared to enjoy the fruits of their victory. With each new year, after the close of the Revolution, emigration set more steadily toward the lands about the Mohawk. The estates of Sir William Johnson became smaller farms and holdings and his Indian friends were crowded into contracted limits.

To the south, in New York City scarred by siege and fire, longer idleness was at a discount. Teunis Jansen, following the traditions of his family, was carpenter and shipbuilder, and when a city is to be rebuilt and its commerce rehabilitated the wielder of axe and hammer, plane and saw finds plenty to do. \" Dwellings that had escaped the flames,\" says Mrs. Lamb, \" were bruised and dis mantled ; gardens and grounds were covered with a rank growth of weeds and wild grass ; fences had disappeared, and the debris of army life was strewn from one end of the town to the other.

But even this was in a measure retarded by the spirit of intolerance which is too often the accompaniment of liberty. It is human nature to forgive slowly. Where for years opinions had been so hostilely arrayed against each other as to find expression only in deeds of violence and blood, victory for one side and defeat for the other could scarcely fail to"], [142, "136 LLBERTY. be attended with ill-feeling, recriminations, and the desire for vengeance. Probably in all the history of strife there has never been a more thoroughly surprised and con founded class of people than were the Tories of New York at the close of the American Revolution. As has been said, they represented, especially, the mercantile life of the province, the makers and sup porters of business, and they never for an instant anticipated anything else than the final triumph of England. Saratoga and Yorktown were therefore terrible revelations, and the \" Definitive Treaty of Peace \" found them either fugitives or suppliants. Once victorious, the people were slow to pardon those among themselves who had proved faint hearted or recreant, and were all too ready to vent their detestation in harsh and vindictive form. \" There ought, sir,\" declared one pitiless patriot, \" no Tory to be suffered to exist in America.\" This opinion found so many supporters that in 1784 the New York Legislature passed an act of outlawry and disfranchisement against all those who had clung to the side of England. In time, however, better and nobler counsels prevailed, and this unchristian measure was repealed in 1787. Out of all this, however, and out of the kindred and accompanying differences came the party divi sions that are at once the bane and the security of"], [143, "LIBERTY. 137 all popular governments. Family feuds, like those between the De Lanceys and the Livingstons, were revived. Personal quarrels became public controversies, and differences of opinion on matters of policy and right direction led to antagonisms that have scarcely been healed even to this day. Peace, as it has its victories no less renowned than war has quite as emphatically its animosities and its discords. But both because of and in spite of these party differences the little State steadily grew toward greatness. Its extensive domain stretching from the ocean to the St. Lawrence and from the Hud son to Niagara furnished boundless opportunities for homes and for successful development. Immi gration increased with each new year, and from a community of less than a quarter of a million in habitants in 17S3, the State of New York swelled its numbers to over half a million in 1800, and to fully a million in 18 10, while from the fifth place in population and importance among the original thir teen colonies it advanced to the very foremost place in 1820. With the increase of immigration came the de mand for better communication.

Agriculture brought new sec tions of the State under cultivation ; manufactures, long stagnant or repressed under the restrictive policy of England, were widely established and used the vast water power of the State for practical ends. Ocean commerce grew in bulk from no ex ports whatever during the Revolution, to two and a half millions of dollars in 1791, and to more than fourteen millions in 1800, while education lagging al ways behind the absolute productive necessities grew slowly but steadily as its value to the citizens of a free State became more and more appreciated. The fur-trade, as it had founded Albany gave birth to Buffalo, while Albany itself, constituted the capital of the young State in 1797, became the centre of the constantly increasing grain trade and a prosperous and important city. In 1 7S6 Albany was reckoned as the sixth city in the Union in population, wealth and social position. From 1784 to 1 790 New York City was the capital of the new \" United States.\" All this material advance as it implied the need of capital meant labor none the less.

This latter element \u2014 the minority of power and social position \u2014 while containing many true and honest citizens was found, far too often, aping, in a community based upon republican simplicity, the forms and snobbishness of foreign courts. And yet while disdaining the people as social inferiors, these \" leaders of society \" sought to use for purpose of self-advancement the very ele ment without which they could not have secured either power, position or success. This minority of \" social prominence \" gave the cities importance and even tinged the smaller towns but it in no wise touched or affected that broader and sturdier manhood that was developing out of the falling forests and the fertile soil the real ele ments of substantial growth and permanent success. Not but that this pioneer life was hard and contracted. A close contact with the soil and a knowledge only of the necessities of life does little toward developing the finer possibilities of man's intellectual nature. But upon this basis of toil has gradually arisen the structure of a liberal and more comprehensive manliness that has contrib uted more to the real up-building of the State and the nation than has all the arrogance of capital and all the petty nonsensities of social distinc tions and the aristocracy of dress.

This prerogative of freedom was as inspiring as it was novel to them and while it gave them, perhaps, a childish delight in their own importance, it gave them, also, the deeper sense of their responsibilities. The fact, too, that suffrage was not really universal but was enjoyed only by such as could show the small but needed property qualification only served to increase the importance of those who were legal voters. They were the rulers, and as is often the case with newly enfranchised peoples, they used the ballot, sometimes, quite as tyrannically as they did conscientiously. \" We, the people,\" could make and unmake rulers where before they had been but vassals and serfs and any interference with their rights was angrily resented. When, in the election of 1792, the popular vote for Mr. Jay as governor was overruled in favor of Mr. Clinton on the ground of certain irregularities the people were aroused at once and would have taken matters in their own hands. They denounced the high-minded"], [147, "LIBERTY. 141 and patriotic Governor Clinton as a usurper and a fraud and would have proceeded to even further extremities had not the overruled candidate, Mr. Jay, himself begged them to desist ; appealing to \"that natural good-humor which harmonize society,\" he urged them to submit to the decisions of the canvassers of the returns to whom they themselves had given authority, and thus the excitement was allayed. With this devotion to the privilege of the ballot, therefore, election day in the young State was a red-letter day to the new-made freemen. Every body talked politics and even in the remotest set tlement a deep interest was taken in the questions involved and in the claims and counter-claims of the opposing parties. It was a great day in the Jansen household when in the presidential election of 1792 the eldest son, still a Teunis, of course, becoming of age that year and at the same time a free-holder, cast his first vote for the presidential electors. The family were devoted Federalists, and Tryntie's Jansen's Jansen, as, according to Dutch nomenclature the young voter was termed by the friends of the family, proudly voted, as did his father, for Wash ington and Clinton.

In the war-flurries that stirred the nation in the closing years of the century, as now France and now England seemed inclined to be arrogant and aggressive, young Teunis Jansen, in common with all the youth of the land, quickly caught the war fever and proudly paraded in his curious uniform as one of the New York Militiamen, while mother and sisters regarded him lovingly as one of the possible defenders of the dignity of America. All this martial fervor, however, did not with draw him from his line of daily duty and his saw and hammer played in unison with those of his father as they wrought their sturdiest upon many a new building in the growing town or upon the trim-looking vessels that were launched from the New York ship yards.

With the opening of the nineteenth century the constant stream of immigration was bringing new settlers into every section. The incoming of so many different nationalities even still further in creased the cosmopolitan character of the popula tion, and it is stated, as an instance of this, that in the little hamlet of \" old Fort Schuyler \" (now Utica) when it numbered but ninety houses \"ten or twelve different nations were represented. With the increase of trade and manufacture, financial wealth grew and in 1800 there were banks in operation at New York City, Hudson, Albany and Troy. The scandals attached to the early his tory of these banks, the indications that certain high officials were involved in questionable transac tions concerning them, and the evident mingling of political bargains with their management are proof that people in those days were quite as open to criticism and quite as liable to yield to tempta tion as are their descendants in what we are too apt to term \" these degenerate days.\" The boys and girls of the Jansen household were growing with their city and their State.

Their children and grandchildren could be found near by in the city itself or far away by the locks of the Mohawk, on the rapidly-growing city of Hudson, while one, trav elling off to join his grandfather's relatives in the interior, had even risen to the dignity of a peda gogue and was teaching a country school in the backwoods beyond Otsego. Workers all, in their humble way, they sought to do their duty as honest men, helpful women and good citizens. And labor which is always honor able is always helpful.

T seems strangely out of place that in what is really a peace-loving world the story of its peoples should be punctuated by their quarrels. The wars of the world mark the epochs in its history whereas they should in reality be consigned to a secondary place. One will scarcely deny that these wars have not in a general way been a contribu tion toward progress, but the real life of the people themselves, irrespective of generals and armies, of diplomats and treaties, has after all given the true impetus to the advance of the nations. So when, according to all our histories, we should imagine the thirteen States of the American Union and the State of New York in particular as all absorbed in thoughts of war, during the period that culminated in the year 1812 in the second conflict"], [152, "146 EARLY FOLLTICAL STRUGGLES. with England, I am quite certain that the people of the State, such at least as were of the class of which Teunis Jansen and his family were types, had more real concern for their daily duties \u2014 their business gains and losses, their home happenings, joys and sorrows, and the personal affairs of their next door neighbors \u2014 than for the question as to the legality of the embargo act, the repeal of the Berlin decree, the British \" orders in council,\" or the impressment of American seamen. And yet these questions brought on a war that was alike irritating and disastrous, and that fell with especial severity upon the people of the State of New York. That Commonwealth was the rally ing ground of armies, and the pivotal point around which American interests centred. In these calmer days of arbitration and mutual concession such a war as that of 181 2 would be impossible. If England was aggressive so was America hot-headed. The old scars of 1783 were still unhealed and the leaders of a vindictive war party forced the nation into a conflict for which there was really no excuse. But when war actually did come it found the people loyal. Disapproval and censure gave place to a united stand against a foreign foe and the people of New York unanimously agreed in a great mass-meeting in the park of their"], [153, "EARLY FOLLTICAL S1RUGGLES. 147 chief city to \" lay aside all animosity and private bickering, and aid the authorities in constructing fortifications.\" The Jansens, father and sons, put away their tools and hastened to offer their sturdy muscle for work upon the city's fortifications. One of the boys was among the twenty-five hundred men who sailed out of New York harbor on privateering cruises against the commerce of England, and both the eldest and the youngest sons \u2014 Teunis and Jacob Jansen \u2014 were in the ranks of the militia men who organized for land defence. All this energy was sorely needed. New York State was but illy prepared to withstand a foreign invasion. Her harbors were almost defenceless, her northern frontier line was but a long stretch of exposed country, and from Canada or from the sea she was equally open to the enemy. But the story of 181 2 proves, if such proof were needed, that after all courageous and purpose filled men are the surest defence for a State. Ogdensburg and Sackett's Harbor, Chippewa and Lundy's Lane proved that the valor of New York still maintained its old renown, while Decatur and Hull, Perry and Jones upheld the honor of their native land and made its navy invincible alike on the great lakes that washed the northern boundary of the Empire State and upon the greater ocean"], [154, "148 EARLY FOLLTLCAL STRUGGLES. through whose narrow gateway the city on its southern shore was reached. On the eleventh of February, 1814, the ship Favorite brought into New York harbor the news of the treaty of Ghent. Peace was proclaimed, just at the moment when peace was sorely needed, and the trade and commerce of the imperilled State, well-nigh ruined by two years of war, revived with new energy and vigor. The origin and growth of political parties is at once due to and indicative of the progress of the people. Wherever men congregate in masses vary ing opinions or desires will control and divide them. In the old days of force and autocracy there were but two divisions \u2014 the tyrants and the tyrannized ; but as men tended toward self-government desires were coined into protests and demands were made the bases of party or national differences.

The two original factions split into other and growing parties. New influences were at work and after the war of 1812 the rapid growth and development of the State brought forward many important questions as factors and creators of new political parties. Burrites and Livingston-men, Clintonians and Bucktails and other less prominent but equally assertive factions split, severed and changed entirely the complexion of the original parties, while that \" personalism in politics \" which to-day we so deplore and criticise at each recurring campaign was fully as rampant and even more vin dictive.

And yet they dallied with this new prerogative, sway ing from indifference to indignation in fitful and spasmodic ways. A free people is a fickle one save when great issues unite or antagonize them.

Federalists at heart they were still ready to follow the majority when power shifted to the republican side and were equally moved to loud hurrahs by the appeals of De Witt Clinton and the fiery leadership of Burr. And, in all this, the unknown and simple folk of the house of Jansen were but types of the thousands like them \u2014 men and women who reasoned a trifle, but, too often, blindly put their faith in some hero of the hour, swerving suddenly to the opposite quarter as the wind of public favor turned the weathercock of leadership.

It was Alexander Hamilton, of New York, almost a statesman, who called the Constitution of the United States an \" experiment \" and spoke of the people as \" their own worst enemies,\" who arrogated to himself the chief \"pat ronage \" of his successful party, and vilified his"], [162, "156 EARLY POLITICAL STRUGGLES. rivals in language that was not less bitter because it was courteous. It was De Witt Clinton who, with even more claims to the title of statesman than had Hamilton, could yet be vindictive toward his opponents and arrogant toward his supporters, and could try all the arts of the politician and the ques tionable methods of the party manager in order to secure his own ends or to thwart those of his political rivals. There is after all little difference between the political methods of 1808 and those of 1888 in this same State of New York, and what difference there may be is really to the credit of these later and better days. Party differences so fierce and factious to-day were even more bitter then.

Teunis the elder caught instant sight of the obnoxious decoration and started up angrily. \" So, so, boy ! \" he cried, \" what does this mean ?

Of course this quarrel was speedily made up, for the wife and mother is ever a spirit of peace in a home, and father and son shook hands again ; but even to such extents did party rancor go and the splits, such as this, in the same party were even more fierce and bitter than were the hatreds of rival parties.

The \" party of freedom \" has disintegrated and divided into factions and fol lowings more or less hostile as the personal desires of leaders or the preferences of voters determined. \" The great political parties in the State of New York,\" says Mr. De Peyster, \" arose from the con flicting sentiments concerning the extent of power which was necessary to enable the Congress of the United States to discharge the duties to which it was appointed ; but they did not assume distinct organization until the proposed Constitution of the United States was presented to the State for its approval and ratification.\""], [169, "EARLY POLITICAL STRUGGLES. 163 Originally a strong anti-federalist State and wedded to the picturesque doctrine of independent sovereignty* the growing Commonwealth of New York had as time and circumstances modified its beliefs grown into an active loyalty to the Consti tution of the United States and its decreasing feder alist or increasing anti-federalist majorities proved its gradual acceptance of allegiance to a central authority. The growing animosities between Alexander Hamilton and Governor George Clinton \u2014 the acknowledged leaders of the opposing parties \u2014 naturally developed, after the closely-disputed adop tion of the National Constitution in 1788, a per sonal following for each chieftain, and it is even claimed that President Washington, desirous though he was of harmonizing both factions, yet showed a marked preference in his disposal of national patronage in New York State to the friends of Hamilton.

As young Teunis Jansen was captured in 1820 by the brilliancy of Martin Van Buren, so, twenty years before, had his father been led away by the audacity and dash of Aaron Burr. Probably no character in American history ever occupied so unique and picturesque a position as did Aaron Burr. A daring young soldier during the Revolution, though always distrusted by Wash ington, this successful Albany lawyer gained posi tion and prominence so rapidly after his entrance into public life as to distance all competitors and to become before he had fully reached his prime a popular and almost successful candidate even for the presidency itself. Shrewd, politic, audacious, unscrupulous, reckless and designing, he possessed a winning presence and a personal magnetism that blinded men to his real character and attached them to his following with as much enthusiasm as ever bound together the forest band of a Robin Hood or the henchmen of some medi\u00e6val chief tain. Never forgetting his own personal interest and advantage he could yet seem to sink self in behalf of the people so adroitly that for years he was at once the hero and the idol of a large portion of the free voters of New York, and only lost his"], [171, "165 EARLY FOLLTICAL STRUGGLES. hold upon them when his unbridled ambition and reckless habits led him into personal intrigue and assassination, and a bold attempt at treason drove him from his home into the gloom and ignominy of flight and exile. It was possibly this severe lesson in unwise attachment to an unworthy leader that made the Teunis Jansen of 1800 the bitter and unsparing conservative of 1820 and prompted him to such severe measures with his own son when that eager young voter sought to make a hero and a chief tain of another rising and brilliant political leader. Martin Van Buren, however, was free from the defects of character that proved the ruin of Burr. He was, however, a born politician and he knew so wisely how to act and manage that he held and strengthened the following; his talents drew around him, and was thus enabled to reach both the goals which Burr so nearly attained and so absolutely lost \u2014 the governorship of New York and the presi dency of the United States. De Witt Clinton, nephew of Governor George Clinton, New York's first executive, was destined to make for himself a greater name and a deeper impress upon the history of New York State than did his illustrious uncle. \" He entered upon life,\"* says Mr. Tuckerman, \" when the contest between * De Witt Clinton was born March 2, 1769, and died February n, 182S."], [172, "166 EARLY FOLLTICAL STRUGGLES. the two original parties under the Federal govern ment was at its height, and closed his existence at the epoch of their virtual dissolution.\" Always interested in the development of his native State and prominent alike in politics and in philanthropy, his course brought him foes as bitter as his friends were loyal, while the plans which he advocated with an enthusiasm that was almost dictatorial and a tenacity of purpose that sometimes appeared au tocratic, though they conquered at last, did so only in the face of opposition and prejudice. But still, through all the strifes and changes of politics and all the vicissitudes of war were the people of the State of New York strengthening their position as the foremost commercial Common wealth in the new union of States. The very stringency of markets and dearth of necessities which the war of 1812 with its attendant measures of embargo and blockade entailed developed a greater self-reliance among the people who were the acutest sufferers in a conflict to which they were unalterably opposed and yet in which they loyally bore their part. The establishment of manufactories for the home production of such stuffs as they had hitherto been accustomed to import led to a growing condition of demand and supply, and laid the basis of those manufacturing interests that were, before many"], [173, "167 EARLY POLITICAL STRUGGLES. years, to constitute the main strength and increase of the beleagured State. The founders of the modest woollen mill of Oriskany and of the crude little cotton manufactory at Whitesborough, both of which were established because of the desperate needs of the people in those days of suffering and privation, builded wiser than they knew. For in so doing they all unconsciously laid the foundation of that spirit of enterprise and endeavor which led to other and greater establishments and resulted in the present manufacturing wealth of the great State of New York. War, after all, is a mixed evil. If it does weaken and exhaust, it also, as surely, develops personal dependence and self-help. If it does engender hatred and slaughter, it also creates a spirit of comradeship that, by its very welding of individual interests, strengthens and cements the bond of mutual assistance and so gradually leads to that better and wiser day when arbitration shall take the place of warfare and the pen prove, as indeed it is, mightier than the sword."], [174, "168 CHAPTER VIII IN THE TWENTIES ELL, my jolly young Buck- tail, and what do you think of your party now ? \" was the question that greeted Teunis Jansen the younger as one April morning in the year 1824 he sat in his little shop in Pine Street and with a clouded brow pored over his copy of the \" Evening Post \" of the day before. The reader looked from his paper and met the inquiring eye of his bluff old father. \" Dad,\" he said, while an indignant flush red dened on his face, \" it's an outrage !

And so they'll find out too before they're a month older.\" This \" scandalous piece of trickery \" was indeed one of which no political party, however deeply it was plunged in a devotion to self and spoils, could ever feel proud. It may seem a slight matter to us of to-day, schooled to the ways and wiles of modern politicians, but it was far from being a slight matter then and it resulted in one of those rare occurrences which history calls an \" uprising of the people.\" The New York legislature in the very moment of the dissolution of its session of 1824 had un wittingly but almost unanimously passed a meas ure, sprung upon it, in the hurry of adjournment, by shrewd party managers in a spirit of senseless and vindictive party rancor. This was the removal of De Witt Clinton from the office of canal com missioner. And thereby hangs a tale. With the close of the war of 181 2 the vast resources and latent possibilities of the State of New York brought within its borders a ceaseless stream of emigration. A round million of people found homes within its borders and the Common wealth sprang to the rank of first in the roll of States in point of population. But the Empire State \u2014 with an area as large as that of England \u2014 was practically isolated from"], [176, "IN THE TWENTIES. 170 itself. With no system of commercial intercom munication beyond the great white-capped truck wagons, and the cramped and limited stage coach, trade suffered, and any thing like substantial growth was retarded. Poughkeepsie and Utica, Albany and Buffalo were many days apart, and a journey to the interior from the city of New York was as serious a matter as a modern trip to Europe. The exigencies of the war just closed \u2014 during which the frontier line of the State was the scene of bitterly disputed contests \u2014 opened the eyes of statesmen, soldiers and students to the need of a better system of communication between the sea board metropolis and the villages and settlements of the interior and the border. \" Oh, for a canal ! \" had been the cry again and again during those weary war-days as now supplies or now news of victory or disaster travelled slowly and spasmodi cally from town to town. But, when a need exists far-seeing men are ready to appreciate and act. Already New York stood acknowledged by the world as the originator and developer of steam navigation. The Jansen boys (for such is the fickleness of human nature) as they had been misbelieving scoffers before his hour of success, had been also among the most enthusi astic cheerers upon the sloping Manhattan shores when in 1807 Robert Fulton's new-fangled craft the"], [177, "IN THE TWENTIES. 171 Clermont rounded the Battery and steamed slowly up into the shadow of the Palisades on its way toward Albany. That crude little tug \u2014 whose smoke and snorting had so startled one honest countryman that he declared to his wife he had seen \" the devil on his way to Albany in a saw mill \" \u2014 rapidly developed into something more practical and palatial. In 18 19 the Savannah, built in New York, made the first Transatlantic voyage from Savannah to St. Petersburg by way of Liverpool, and in 1825 James Allaire's steamer, the Sun, made the trip from New York to Albany in twelve hours and eighteen minutes.* All these advances, however, though they anni hilated space where broad water-ways were available were of little benefit in opening up such sections as interior New York. Again and again had the construction of a State canal been advocated and attempted. Christopher Colles and General Philip Schuyler, Gouverneur Morris and James Geddes, Chancellor Livingston and Robert Fulton had urged its importance and worked in its behalf, but no one had succeeded in accomplishing any thing toward the desired end until De Witt Clinton had thrown into the work all the force of his great and untiring energy, and in spite of disappointment * The Walk in the Water, the first Lake steamboat, was launched at Black Rock, near Buffalo, in May, 181S, and made her trial trip across Lake Erie to Detroit in August of that year. The Ontario, built in 1816, made her first trip over the lake Ontario in April, 1S17."], [178, "172 IN THE TWENTIES. and rebuff, of opposition and defeat had finally succeeded in beginning in 181 7 what his opponents styled in derision \" Clinton's big ditch,\" but what became, after its completion in 1S25, the greatest American channel for trade and emigration \u2014 the Erie Canal. To succeed in the face of bitter and persistent opposition is the surest way to popularity. De Witt Clinton's unswerving belief in the great pro ject he so vigorously advocated won the people to his side and the last device of his enemies by which, in the legislature of 1824 and on the very eve of the completion of his scheme, they deprived him of his official position as canal commissioner aroused the people as they had not been stirred for years. There was a rare tumble in politics. Such humble citizens and voters as Teunis Jansen the younger who for years had been fighting the party of Clinton at the polls now revolted in his favor. The act of proscription was openly and angrily denounced and as a result of this popular uprising Clinton was for the third time elected governor of his State by what was for those days an enormous majority and almost every man who had directly or indirectly aided in his overthrow was swept out of office by the votes of an indignant people. The great Erie Canal with nearly one thousand miles of lateral length and navigable feeders has"], [179, "READING THE \" CULPRIT FAY.\""], [180, ""], [181, "IN THE TWENTIES. 175 long since been superseded in importance as a means of rapid internal communication by the still more remarkable triumphs of the steam engine and the railroad. But seventy years ago it was a vital question in New York life and politics and to its successful completion is due the rapid and phe nomenal growth of Central New York, while many a thriving town and city of to-day owes alike its settlement, its incorporation, its life and growth to the impetus given to trade and commerce, to im migration and settlement, by \" Clinton's big ditch.\" Great projects are the death knells of great evils. It is a singular and significant fact that as each year brought still nearer to completion so great a work of public benefit and practical progress as the Erie Canal, each year, as surely, brought nearer to its death the curse of human slavery that for full two hundred years had rested upon the fair name of New York. Originally introduced for selfish ends by the soulless monopolists of the Dutch West India Company in the earliest days of New Amsterdam, slavery as an institution had lost its hold as free dom gained a footing. A community of workers has neither need nor liking for enslaved labor. Even before the beginning of the nineteenth cen tury slavery in the State of New York was merely nominal and the census of 18 10 showed less than"], [182, "176 IN THE TWENTIES. twenty thousand slaves to a million of inhabitants. When faced with the principle of free labor its very existence, meagre as this was, seemed an anomaly and an excrescence. Its continuance in the State was never a political issue. Its abolition was desired by both parties. Alexander Hamilton, the federalist, was outspoken in its condemnation ; Edward Livingston, the anti federalist, was equally its foe. It was Governor John Jay, the democrat, who in the last years of the eighteenth century was president of \" The Society for the Manumission of Slaves,\" and who proposed the bill of abolition by which the State declared that every child born within the limits of the State after the fourth day of July, 1799, should be forever free ; it was Governor Daniel D. Tomp kins, the republican, who gave the \" institution \" its death blow by the recommendation in his annual message of 1817 (the very year in which the first spadeful of dirt was turned on the Erie Canal) the entire abolition of slavery in the State of New York on and after the fourth day of July, 1827. All this is but indicative of the popular desire and the popular will. A people really free and pro gressive can never abide the existence of property in men. It is also a significant fact that as slavery decreased the desire for popular education grew"], [183, "IN THE TWENTIES. 177 strong. The thrifty ways of the old Dutchmen of New Amsterdam although they inclined toward the education of the young never permitted much advance or gave to the children of \" the people \" anything more than the very baldest rudiments. The little school of the Dutch \" domine,\" Van Olfendam, who in 1650 taught the children of \" the gentry\" for a fee of \" two beavers \" per annum, did give place to the so-called \" public school \" of a few years later, and led to a certain attempt at education in the sparse river-settlements of those early Knickerbockers. But with English rule even this crude attempt at education languished and died out. It was only when freedom gained the day that popular education came at last. Grad ually the horn book gave place to the primer, the primer to the text-book, and the exclusive and pedantic \" Latin School \" of Stuyvesant's day de veloped, thus, after many years, into the common school which found in every town and village its cheerless but well-supported schoolhouse. Rough and uninviting as were these early \" temples of learning \" they served a noble purpose, for within their walls many an embryotic citizen learned the rudiments of that practical education that was to help him in time toward manlier duties and aspirations. The conservative old Teunis Jansen of 1820,"], [184, "178 IN THE TWENTIES. to be sure, pooh-poohed at what he termed the extravagance that insisted on giving to the young sters of that day a better \" school-larnin' \" than their fathers and mothers had obtained, but none the less proud did he feel when his children and grandchildren showed proofs of intellectual advance ment. Still the desire for learning grew, and the five thousand schools of 18 18 showed how far seeing had been the wisdom of such public-spirited citizens as De Witt Clinton, who in 1805 became the first president of \" the Society for Establishing a Free School in the City of New York,\" and how far-reaching had been the efforts of such men as Governor Morgan Lewis, who, in the same year of 1805, secured the passage of an act by which the proceeds of the sale of five hundred thousand acres of the public lands should be devoted to the ex tension and improvement of the common-school system in the State. It was to be the fault of the young Jansens of succeeding generations if they fell short in the matter of education for, surely, the State was nobly helping them to greater possibilities. There was another happening within that first quarter of the nineteenth century which, although the younger Jansens knew it not and the older ones scarce regarded it, still indicated the State's advance in material and intellectual force. For"], [185, "IN THE TWENTIES. 179 forty-four years the Constitution adopted by the highest wisdom of the State had served the pur pose of the growing Commonwealth, but as intel ligence broadened and population increased certain changes in the bond that held the people of the State in union seemed vital and necessary. A constitution is a compact between individuals for the purpose of securing unity and is based upon certain laws of action and procedure. These laws, as people progress, need certain modifications and amendments and as their young State grew toward manhood the people of New York appre ciated alike the flaws and the weaknesses that the test of time disclosed in their civil compact. The first convention of 1777, as will be remem bered, accomplished its work in the midst of trouble and turmoil ; the boom of the enemy's guns was scarcely beyond ear-shot while the possibility of failure and the punishment of treason loomed ever before the eyes of its patriotic members. They did their work wisely and well, but even their large foresight could not apprehend the growth and development of their State during half a century of freedom. The convention of 1821 revised and altered many important features of that first con stitution which experience had proved faulty or insufficient. It extended the right of suffrage, re formed the judiciary system, abolished the council"], [186, "180 IN THE TWENTIES. of appointment which had proved itself a harm ful and fatal political power, increased the powers of the governor and advocated the extension of popular education. The new constitution, which was formally ratified by the people in February, 1822, was a marked advance upon the original document, and for twenty-five years served the purposes of the citizens of the growing State until another revision in 1846 showed a still further advance in breadth and statesmanship. The literary growth of a people occupied in developing the resources and strengthening the framework of a rising State is necessarily slow and is the last phase of national or local life in which the people themselves actually display an interest. After the Revolution men began to inter est themselves more and more in the circumscribed little newspapers of the day which slowly but surely grew in size and influence as the people gradually became readers. The younger Jansens found but little beyond their own school text-books to afford them reading material, for, even as litera ture advances, the requirements and the enter tainment of the children are the last to secure attention. But, even in the homes of the people, two young authors of the early days of the century found readers and admirers. The stories of James Fenimore Cooper and the graceful humor of"], [187, "181 IN THE TWENTIES. Irving penetrated even beyond the circle of \" the aristocracy \" which for far too long a time had monopolized not only the refinements but the enjoyments of culture ; and, though the readers bore but a small proportion to those who did not read ; the effect of the literary advance was each year a more potent and apparent factor in the real progress of the State. Old Teunis Jansen the elder as he listened to the story of that marvellous character in fiction \" The Spy \" grew interested and excited over the memories of the Revolutionary times that it in spired, but he grew hot and wroth when his grandson read to him the sharp and racy satires of Knickerbocker's so-called \" History of New York.\" \" Who is this Diedrich Knickerbocker ? \" he de manded.* \" 'Tis all lies, boy, lies that he is telling. Would that my grandfather, old Teunis, were alive. I'll wager you he would hunt up this scribbler and serve him out roundly for his scurvy tales.

I'll hear no more of it \u2014 but \u2014 yes \u2014 read on, lad \u2014 read on. \u2022\"The Dutch settlers,\" said Mr. Chauncey M. Depew, in his address at the Semi centennial Anniversary of the St. Nicholas Society in 1885, \" by the magic pen of the father of American litei'ature, became the victims of a caricature which captivated the fancy of the wrorld, and made the most potent factors in the founding and development of the freedom and prosperity cf our country, the accepted subjects of good-natured ridicule and merriment.\""], [188, "182 IN THE TWENTIES. Let's hear what more lies this blackguard Knicker bocker can tell ! \" The old man \"pshawed\" contemptuously too at what he called the \" po'try trash \" of Drake's \" Culprit Fay.\" \" The idee of there bein' any such heathen truck as a fairy up among the Highlands,\" he said ; \" why, I've hunted 'em over, man and boy, these fifty years, from Cro'nest and Anthony's Nose to the Botterberg and Sugar-loaf and never a spook or fairy did I come across.\" But, all the same, the charming rhythm of Drake's delightful poem did have its influence on the practical old grandsire, and trim young Sophie Jansen as she read the lines he saw fit to so pooh-pooh, laughed slyly as she noticed her grandfather keeping time to the rhythm of the \" Culprit Fay \" with finger, foot, or head. But the Jansen family though a type of the \"people\" of their day were to a certain degree above that type in their love of books and reading. The reading habit had not yet secured the hold upon the masses that later years brought it and though in some, even humble homes, the works of Cooper and Irving, of Drake and Halleck, of Bryant and Verplanck, of Brown and Sands and Hoffman and other now unknown and forgotten writers were alike familiar and popular the \" literary following \" was in a measure limited. The bookstore was,"], [189, "THE MINGLING OF THE WATERS."], [190, ""], [191, "IN THE TWENTIES. 185 however, gradually becoming a feature in social growth, and in many a small town and thriving vil lage the bookseller, with the doctor, the \"domine,\" the judge and the schoolmaster, was one of the recognized \" authorities.\" Books were then too few to be ranked as other than high and honorable merchandise. They were luxuries, accessible only to the more fortunate, and while there was too apparent a lack of the desire for culture among the people in general, there was also, perhaps, too much of a certain churlishness of possession among the booksellers themselves, reminding one of Charles Lamb's \" stall-man \" who cries out to a penniless reader in his book-shop : \u2014 \" You sir, you never buy a book, Therefore in one you shall not look.\" But each little village had its coterie of culture and in all such circles the local bookseller was both mentor and oracle. In considering the growth of intelligence in our land we are far too apt to forget the bookseller of sixty years ago as one of its leading and most honored factors. The glimpse which N. P. Willis gives us of a winter at Fleming Farm among \" the imprisoned inhabitants of Skaneateles \" in the Lake region of the State, hints at this growing culture in even remote and isolated sections. He tells of the old library of the Flemings \u2014 \"a long room in the"], [192, "186 IN THE TWENTIES. southern wing of the house, a heavily curtained, dim old place, with deep-embayed windows, and so many nooks and so much furniture that there was that hushed air, that absence of echo within it, which is the great charm of a haunt for study or thought.\" The Flemings, he says, \" amused them selves during the deep snows of winter with a man uscript ' Gazette ' which was contributed to by every body in the house, and read aloud at the breakfast table on the day of its weekly appearance.\" Such intellectual pleasures, he affirms, were not alto gether appreciated by the \" indigenous beaux of Skaneateles,\" but it was in just such homes that the intellectual growth of the State was developed and fostered. From just such a home, in Plattsburg on Lake Champlain, came that most precocious of American girls \u2014 Lucretia Davidson. \"Their home pleasures and excitements,\" says her biogra pher, \" were all intellectual, and her father's well selected library was, at all times, the dearest solace of his daughter.\" Another element in this intellectual growth was one which appealed still more directly to the people and affected an even larger number than did the reading habit. This was the Sunday school. The Jansens and their class were faith ful church-goers. Old Teunis Jansen, like his forefathers had ever been a constant attendant at"], [193, "187 IN THE TWENTIES. his church. To have missed a Sabbath service would have been almost a felony, and his children and grandchildren followed in his footsteps \u2014 fol lowed by force of habit and home-training perhaps more than because of any individual thinking or desire, but followed unquestioningly and dutifully. With thousands of men and women, the church was the centre of social life, and when in 18 12 the first Sunday school in New York was opened by Mrs. Bethune and, later, in Greenwich village, other similar schools speedily followed, the older people questioned the wisdom of such an experiment but its success was soon beyond dispute. De Witt Clinton, foremost in helpful public measures, gave his support to the new plan of spiritual education and the Sunday school soon became an established church auxiliary, gradually adopted by every de nomination and obtaining each year a stronger and securer footing throughout the growing State. Side by side, the common schools and the Sunday school were doing a great and noble work in the formation and development of the minds and char acter of the children of the State. So the first quarter of the nineteenth century drew toward its close. And in the very year that opened the second quarter, in October, 1825, the people of the entire State of New York knew with pride and pleasure that their greatest work had been"], [194, "188 IN THE TWENTIES. accomplished, that the longest canal in the world had been constructed within their domain and they prepared to celebrate its opening in enthusiastic holiday fashion. On the morning of October 26, just eight years and three months from the date of commencement, the \" palatial \" canal boat Seneca Chief with a special passenger-list of notables started from Buffalo on its way to New York and the open sea; all along the route were welcome, rejoicing and festivity. \" Who comes there ? \" was the hail from the deck of a little boat at the stone aqueduct of Rochester. \" Your brothers from the West on the waters of the Great Lakes,\" was the reply. \" By what means have they been diverted so far from their natural course ? \" came the question from the little boat. \" Through the channel of the Great Erie Canal,\" was the ready answer. \" By whose authority, and by whom, was a work of such magnitude accomplished ? \" demanded the challenger, and from the pioneer canal boat came the proud reply, \" By the authority and by the enterprise of the people of the State of New York.\" Cannons boomed and music sounded a welcome, fireworks and illuminations lighted up the nights,"], [195, "IN THE TWENTIES. 189 and all along the line eager spectators thronged the banks of the canal to view the pageant and greet the Seneca Chief. At Utica the Jansens who were in the family line of that adventurous young Isaac who, sixty years before, had been one of the pioneers of the Mohawk valley in Sir William Johnson's day, cheered lustily at the boat that was to float down toward their kinsmen by the sea. Albany was one blaze of welcome, and on the fourth of November, nine days after its depart ure from Buffalo, the Seneca Chief, with a great naval escort, amid the thunder of cannon, the ring ing of bells, and the sounds of stirring music, floated on past the greatest city of the State. \" Where from and whither bound ? \" came the hail of New York City from the deck of the steamboat Washington. \" From Lake Erie, bound for Sandy Hook,\" rang out the answer, and then where the waters of the broad bay mingle with those of the greater ocean the chief promoter of this vast enterprise, Governor De Witt Clinton, standing on the deck of the Seneca Chief poured into the Atlantic from a gilded keg the waters of Lake Erie. \" May the God of the heavens and the earth,\" he said solemnly, \" smile most propitiously on this work, accomplished by the wisdom, public spirit, and energy of the people of the State of New"], [196, "IN THE TWENTIES. 190 York, and may He render it subservient to the best interests of the human race.\" It was a day of festivity and rejoicing. We, who, at this later day, witness each year the com pletion of work that is at once more marvelous and more far-reaching than the completion of a great ditch on which to float boats of merchan dise and produce may not esteem the work of our grandfathers of such moment as did they, but neither human ingenuity nor human energy can give to the world, in view of all the circumstances, of all the hinderances and of all the ends it served a grander work than was this now prosaic and almost forgotten Erie Canal. Such, even then, the people felt it to be and such we may be sure did all the Jansens regard it as, old and young, they cheered the pageant and were themselves a part of it, or watched with wonder and delight the mighty display of fireworks and illumi nation that lit up the City Hall at New York and reflected the joyous glare upon the upturned faces of the throng that gathered about it. It was a fitting time for old Teunis Jansen to pass away. His eighty years of life represented the old regime that was likewise to pass away with him, giving place to an era of change and progress, far removed from the staid and soberer ways in which he had been reared. His generation had"], [197, "IN THE TWENTIES. 191 made a nation.

They were indeed inclined to look with all the superiority of sons of the soil upon the new comers whom the completion of the canal attracted to their picturesque section. For, as has already been intimated, the facilities afforded by the completion of the Erie Canal led, almost immediately to a great \" real estate boom \" throughout Central New York. That fertile and attractive section over which, for years, the war like Iroquois had roamed as lords and for the"], [199, "PROGRESS AND DISASTER. 193 mastery of which England and France had quar reled and fought was no longer a dangerous and unproductive border-land. Each new year was making it the home of a thrifty and enterprising folk \u2014 emigrants from neighboring States or across the sea. There were certain subsidized highways or fair \"State roads \" through the northern, central and southern counties, while the ease of access and transportation which the new canal afforded, together with the excellence of the soil and its evident possibilities more than offset the uncertain title of the new lands and the risks attendant upon corporate or speculative proprietors. That these risks were by no means imaginary the later history of the State attests. The troubles that they occasioned form not only a unique but a dramatic episode in the story of New York. Probably in no other State in the Union did the unwritten law of feudal tenure have such a last ing hold upon the people or lead to so much pro test and disturbance. Thousands of acres within the limits of the State had, since the days of the patroons \u2014 the earliest of American monopolists \u2014 remained in the hands of the descendants of those land barons of the Colonial days who rarely sold and invariably leased to occupants and tenants.

The Holland Land Company \u2014 an association of Dutch speculators \u2014 had, since 1790, controlled millions of acres in Central New York and similar though smaller corporations had acquired title to vast tracts of land which they disposed of to settlers on lease holds or on long credits. The thousands of emigrants who settled upon these attractive lands and proceeded to open and develop them thought only, at first, of the ease of their purchase, giving but little heed to the future and to the complications that their acquisitions would involve. But when, after years of occupa tion, they became attached to their home-sites and considered the improvements that they had made and the advance in value which their labor had caused they grew restive under a continued obliga tion to the monopolistic proprietors. These feudal lords, however, held alike tenants and debtors to their unwise agreements, and insisted on certain rights and obligations in rent or service that were galling to a people pledged to personal independ ence. Awaking at last to their insecurity tenants and debtors alike protested against an invasion of"], [201, "PROGRESS AND DISASTER. 195 what they deemed they had made their own by the right of ceaseless thrift and industry. They combatted, defended and appealed, and, not un frequently, added to legal protest open and aggres sive resistance. But the first rush of new-comers that followed the opening of the Erie Canal thought little of these future complications, although many of the \" old settlers \" whom they found already in occupa tion grumbled, complained, and made dark fore casts of future antagonisms. They thronged the straggling settlements along the line of the canal, they started new communities on unoccupied lands, or, striking off from the pathway of canal and state road scattered their new home-centres over all the rolling; farm lands and forest tracts that stretched from the banks of the Hudson to the shores of Erie and Ontario. Utica and Rome, Oswego and Syracuse, Rochester and Buffalo grew at once from struggling communities into corporate villages and towns, while smaller places vied with each other for prominence or recognition as growing centers. Up and down the canals floated the comfortable and capacious canal-boats \u2014 the passenger packets, or \" line-boats \" \u2014 often gay in decoration and ap pointments, drawn sometimes by four or five horses, tandem, and often making the astonishing speed of six miles an hour! \"A trip by packet,\" says"], [202, "196 PROGRESS AND DISASTER. Mr. Roberts, \"survives in the memory of many as a pleasurable gliding between banks of beauty, sometimes romantic, presenting constant changes of scene, with berths at night inclosed in curtains in the single cabin, and quite as comfortable as, if less swift, than a journey in the modern palace cars. It was to try one of these very packet-trips by canal that our friends the Jansens of New York set out from their city home in 1827. Moved by an intelligent curiosity and the reports as to the marvelous growth of Central New York that had floated down the river to the metropolis, Teunis Jansen and his wife Vroutje (she was a Van Houten of Haverstraw and still held to the old Dutch names and many of the good Dutch ways of her ancestors) started one August morning upon a pleasure trip as far westward as Rochester where dwelt certain of the distant kinsmen of the Jansen blood. To indulge in such \" idle vanities \" as a vacation * This was the romance of canal-travel. But we have good evidence that the \" slow joving barge *\"**\" had really little of romance about it. \"I made my journey,\" writes Horace Greeley of one of these same canal trips to Western New York in 1827, \" by way of the Erie Canal on those line boats whose ' cent and a half a mile, mile and a half an hour ' so many yet remember. Railroads, as yet, were not ; the days passed slowly yet smoothly on those gliding arks, being enlivened by various sedentary games ; but the nights were tedious beyond any sleeping-car experience. At daybreak you were routed out of your shabby, shelf-like berth, and driven on deck to swallow fog while the cabin was cleared of its beds and made ready for breakfast. I say nothing as to the ' good old times ; ' but if any one would recall the good old line boats I object. . . . I trust I have due respect for 'the good old ways 'we often hear of ; yet I feel that this earthly life has been practically lengthened and sweetened by the invention and construction of railroads.\""], [203, "PROGRESS AND DISASTER. 197 was in those days an almost unheard-of luxury ; to take a vacation trip was the very height of extrava gance. But Teunis was learning some new things as he watched the progress of events, and not the least practical of these was a sensible reading of the maxim respecting the effect of all work and no play. And so it happened that on an August morning in 1827 Teunis and his good wife stood on the deck of one of the river steamers as it steamed slowly away from the dock near Whitehall and headed toward Albany. It was still the day of small things for the me tropolis.* Its population was considerably less than two hundred thousand, and, although the entire island had been theoretically laid out (on paper) in streets and avenues as early as 181 1, the town itself, in 1827, barely extended above Canal Street. Villas and farmlands still sloped down to the river's edge, and the clustering roofs of the surburban villages of Greenwich and Chelsea (now known as the populous regions about Greenwich avenue and West Twenty-third Street and long since swal lowed up by the growing city) could be seen across * \" No single railway pointed toward her wharves. No line of ocean steamers brought passengers to her hotels, nor goods to her warehouses, from any foreign port.

Still, to my eyes, her miles squai'e of mainly brick or stone houses, and her furlongs of masts and yards, afforded ample incite ment to a wonder and admiration akin to awe.\" \u2014 Horace Greeley' s first visit to New York.

Albany was reached at sunset. It was then a city of some twenty thousand inhabitants, clinging still to many of the old Dutch ways and customs that its solid citizens had observed ever since the earlier days of Beaverwyck and Fort Orange. From Albany the canal packet started, and soon the travellers were floating westward at the rapid rate of some five miles an hour, quiet but apprecia tive witnesses of the industry, the growth and re sources of their native State. Past town and village and little log settlement they floated \u2014 from Troy to Utica, from Rome to Syracuse, and so came at last to their kinsmen at Rochester, fully assured that Governor De Witt Clinton was indeed a great man, and that the State of New York was a mightily enterprising commonwealth. * Both these suburban villages have occupied a unique and peculiar position in the story of Manhattan Island. Gradually absorbed, in spite of their own protests, by the resistless and ever-growing metropolis they still preserved for many years an identity of their own all the more marked because so absolutely futile. The years have silenced the protests and engulfed the identity. \" Chelsea Village,\" says Mr. Bunner, one of the most charming of New York's later annalists, \"has never had the aggressive exclusiveness of Greenwich. It exists to-day (1888), and vaguely knows itself by name, close to the heart of the great city that has swallowed it up ; but it is in nowise such a distinct entity as the brave little tangle of crooked streets a few blocks to the south. Greenwich has always been Greenwich, and the ' ninth ward' has been the centre of civilization to the dwellers therein.\" 1 Hudson at one time was a busy whaling port and owned more shipping than did New York City itself. Its promising commerce was destroyed by the embargo of 1812, which so seriously affected other places."], [205, "PROGRESS AND DISASTER. 199 And all along the route, from New York City to Rochester, Teunis, the observer, and the good Vroutje, his wife, found that but two topics of con versation appeared to interest and absorb their fellow-passengers. These were, the vast possibili ties of Central New York, and the effect of the Morgan mystery upon New York politics. For politics in New York State were drifting into the strangest complications. Only a year be fore there had died on the fourth of July, 1826, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams \u2014 \"author and champion, respectively, of the great Declaration,\" and the party names of federalist and anti-federalist were like these old-time leaders, reminders only of the past. Already, in 1825, was Andrew Jackson recognized as the \" coming man,\" and, in the State of New York, Martin Van Buren, \" the most adroit politician of his time,\" was a leading and a vital force. Parties were hopelessly mixed. There were Clintonian Adams men, and Democratic Adams men (supporters of the president, but rivals in State politics) ; there were the Clintonians of the In dependents, or \" People's Party,\" and the Bucktails, who voted at the nod of that autocratic power in New York politics known as the \" Albany Re gency \" ; there was the small but aggressive anti- Masonic party and this, though sounding absurd and needless enough to our ears to-day, well-nigh"], [206, "200 PROGRESS AND DISASTER. overturned the whole State. For the anti-Masons rose to prominence through a \"mystery\" as pe culiar as it was perplexing and dramatic. One William Morgan of Batavia, a member of the secret society known as Free Masons was charged with threatening; to disclose the secrets of that organization. Suddenly he disappeared and was never after seen alive. Startling rumors spread. The defenders and opponents of the Masonic fraternity were drawn into a bitter quarrel. Then came the climax. Morgan's body, so it was claimed, had been flung into the Niagara River by his enraged fellow Masons. A mutilated body drawn from the river was declared to be that of Morgan \u2014 or, at least, to be \"a good enough Morgan until after election.\" * The feud filled the State. What ever the truth of the matter, whatever the guilt or innocence of the various parties to this singu lar quarrel, one thing is certain : the fate of this recreant Mason brought about a tremendous ex citement; it created factions and engendered feuds; it entered very largely into local and State poli tics ; it very nearly destroyed the prospects of some of the political leaders and highest officials of the State. Even so popular and acknowledged a * Mr. Greeley declares in his \" Recollections,\" forty years after the Morgan and Anti- Masonic excitement, that Thurlow Weed never made this long-famous remark and that the charge against Mr. Weed to the effect that he had manipulated the body of a drowned man io7 jrormcal purposes was an \" utterly groundless calumny, having barely a shred of badinage to palliate its utterance.\""], [207, "\"PEOPLE WERE ALL EITHER MASONS OR ANTI-MASONS.\""], [208, ""], [209, "PROGRESS AND DISASTER. 203 statesman as Governor De Witt Clinton himself, because of his Masonic connections and his exalted rank in the order, fell under suspicion, and was made the victim of groundless charges. And it was thus that still another disturbing element in the tangled politics of the State was introduced by the organization, under the name of the Anti- Masonic party, of those \" who were determined to destroy the institution of Freemasonry \" and who felt that they \" could not express their sentiments with so much force and effect in any other way than through the ballot-box.\" It was in the midst of all this excitement that our friends, the Jansens, made their canal trip to Rochester. People were all either Masons or anti-Masons, talk ran hot and high, and \" the literature of the period,\" says Mr. Roberts, \" was as harrowing as a series of sensational novels.\" Teunis Jansen had inherited the Dutch reticence of his ancestors ; discreetly holding his tongue, he listened to the chames and recriminations bandied about by the partisans of either side and silently drew his own conclusions. And yet, reticent and slow though he was, he was one of the thousands who, attracted by the vigor, the ability, and the personal magnetism of \" the hero of New Orleans,\" General Andrew Jackson, cast former party affiliations to the wind"], [210, "PROGRESS AND DISASTER. 204 and, disdaining in the maze of political combina tions any other judgment than that of enthusiasm huzzaed loudly for \" Old Hickory,\" and helped give him in 1828 the electoral vote of New York and the final majority that placed him in the presidential chair. But, so uncertain a quantity is popular feeling when the day for actual decision comes, in spite of all the talk and all the threaten ing^ over the Morgan affair the vote of the Anti- Masonic party of New York in the election of 1828 was but thirty-three thousand three hundred and forty-five out of a total ballot of one hundred and thirty-six thousand seven hundred and ninety-four. The dominating force in New York State was now Martin Van Buren, whom men called for his shrewdness and his success \" the little magician.\" The election of 1828 placed him in the Governor's chair. In that same year died his greatest rival and New York's foremost statesman, De Witt Clinton. Four times governor of his native State, whatever affected her interests or seemed a prophecy of her future prosperity received from Clinton en couragement, labor and zeal. \" The Pericles of our Commonwealth,\" said George Griffin, one of the dead statesman's most eloquent eulogists, \" for nearly thirty years he exercised, without stooping to little arts of popularity, an intellectual dominion in his native State scarcely inferior to that of the"], [211, "PROGRESS AND DPS ASTER. 205 illustrious Athenian \u2014 a dominion as benignant as it was effective.\" With the faults and shortcom ings incident to power and popularity De Witt Clinton, nevertheless, attained and still holds al most if not quite the foremost position among New York's greatest names. His memory is one that all New Yorkers, all Americans, indeed, should cherish, and there is truth if there is also a strain of adulation in Mr. Tuckerman's estimate of the man.* \" To those alive to local history and the origin of great practical ideas,\" he says, \" daily observation keeps fresh the memory of De Witt Clinton in his native State. As a stranger enters her unrivalled bay, he sees in the fortified Narrows a proof of Clinton's forethought; in an afternoon excursion the Bloomingdale Asylum and Sailor's Snug Harbor, whose endowment he secured, bear witness to his benevolent enterprise ; while the grand systems of public instruction, of mutual in surance, of internal navigation, of savings banks, reform of the criminal law and agricultural im provement, however modified by the progress of science, constantly attest the liberal and wise polity which under his guidance gave them birth. . . .

And now that the watchwords of party are forgotten and the ravings of faction have died away, his noble presence stands forth in bold relief, on the historical canvas of his era as the pioneer of the genius of communication, whose magic touch has already filled with civilized life the boundless valleys of the West, then an untracked forest ; as the Columbus of national improvement, and the man who most effectually anticipated the spirit of the age, and gave it executive illustration.\" But if Columbus had his La Casa \u2014 \"a mariner,\" so the records assure us, \" scarcely inferior in his own estimation to the admiral himself\" \u2014 so had De Witt Clinton his Martin Van Buren. \"An adroit and subtle, rather than a great man,\" says Mr. Greeley, \" his strength lay in his suavity.\" Always a partisan and a politician he yet had ability and tact sufficient to create for himself a strong and loyal personal following and to make the leader to whom he attached himself at once his patron and his debtor. As he had climbed to power in his own State by a politic manipulation of the varying popularities of De Witt Clinton (both as supporter and foeman, as follower and rival), so he owed his wider eminence to his partisanship for"], [213, "PROGRESS AND DISASTER. 207 Jackson whose enthusiastic henchman he became when the flood of popular favor caught that imperi ous soldier. \" Had there been no Jackson,\" says Mr. Greeley, \" Van Buren would never have attained the highest office in the gift of his countrymen.\" For to that office he did attain in 1836, and until that time he continued to stand as the chief figure in the politics of New York and one of the most popular of Americans. But, during all these years of his ascendancy, though outwardly pros perous the State was really storing up trouble for the days to come. Immigration steadily increased and New York City, as Mrs. Lamb expresses it, \" appeared like a youth much overgrown for his years. It had shot up with a rapidity that defied calculation. Wealth was increasing; faster than sobriety was inclined to measure. Swarming mul titudes from every quarter of the globe were render ing the community in a certain sense unformed.\" Thus although population grew progress was not healthy. And no State felt this unsettled con dition more seriously than did New York. The de mand was less than the supply. Skilled mechanics like the sons of Teunis Jansen found work hard to obtain and uncertainly paid. \" As a journeyman,\" says Mr. Greeley, speaking of the period around 1830, \" I could rarely find work in the country be cause there was so little money ; and on coming"], [214, "208 PROGRESS AND DISASTER, to the city I found that payments by master me chanics to their men were mainly made in uncurrent notes of State banks which must often, if not gen erally, be taken to a 'broker' and shaved before they would pay board or buy groceries.\" Then arose the trouble between President Jackson and the banks, a trouble which because of the stringency it caused in the money market fell with especial severity upon the people, who, having but little, felt the pressure most keenly. In that same year (1832) came the cholera scourge. It swept over the city of New York like a plague and during the three summer months that it held the crowded and careless metropolis in its death-grip more than three thousand people died of this fell disease. It was a sorry^time for such humble folk as the Jansens. Money was too scarce to make flight from town possible, and work was hard to get within the pest-ridden city. Whole streets were barricaded against the approach of the plague as if it were some tangible foe and death and distress found entrance into many a home. \" In every house, in every office and shop,\" says Mr. Bunner, describing the reign of terror, \" there was hasty packing, mad confusion and wild flight. It was only a question of getting out of town as best one might. There was only one idea, and that"], [215, "PROGRESS AND DISASTER. 209 was flight \u2014 from a pestilence whose coming might have been prevented, and whose course might have been stayed. To most of these poor creatures the only haven seemed to be Greenwich Village ; but some sought the scattered settlements above; some crossed to Hoboken; some to Bushwick; while others made a long journey to Staten Island, across the bay. . . . There were some who remained faithful throughout all and who labored for the stricken, and whose names are not even written in the memory of their fellow men. Flight and fright alike carried with them contagion and death, and the pest that wasted the chief city of the State left its traces also along the trail of the fleeing fugitives.\" It is such things as these that dishearten the ignorant, and develop disorder and crime among the unthinking. The cosmopolitan character of New York City, as it has been its chiefest blessing has also been its bane. As early as these days of 1832 when hard times and a fatal disease alike harrassed the town did this disorderly element display itself. Street brawls and riots attended every election while every move made by philan throphy was confronted by lawless ignorance. An unformed community is always a restless one and when composed of so many nationalities race pre judices and race antagonisms are as certain to occur"], [216, "PROGRESS AND DISASTER. 210 as are unpleasant relations between employer and employed or between idleness and occupation. And here again is seen the point of separation between the people and the rabble referred to in an earlier chapter. The people turn protest into action only when their liberties are actually in dan ger ; the rabble is ready to rise upon opportunity rather than upon provocation. It was the rabble that turned election day into a time of brawl and riot, and became disorderly and murderous with equal unreasonableness when wise men sought by sanitary restrictions to stamp out the dreadful cholera, when Masonic halls were built, when abo litionist meetings were in session or when stone, quarried by convicts, was used in the erection of public buildings. Out of the jumble and whirl of politics there came in 1828 two leading parties \u2014 the Democrats and the National Republicans; the first, ardent sup porters of Jackson, the second, halting adherents of John Quincy Adams and carrying now for the first time the distinctive party names that have clung to them ever since. In the case of the latter, how ever, their names ranged from Whig to Liberty men, from Free Soilers to Abolitionists and fluctuated under the stress of various issues from conserva tism to aggressive resistance. The power of Clay, as a factor in opposition, was asserting itself with"], [217, "AHLK THE FIRE OF 35"], [218, ""], [219, "PROGRESS AND DISASTER. 213 just sufficient force to make him a rival, but not a candidate within his own party, while the over shadowing popularity of Jackson made the presiden tial elections of that period in American history, in New York as in other States, rather the fights of factions than the struggle of two opposing parties. \" Out-man\u0153uvred on every side,\" says Mr. Greeley, \" the Republicans were clearly foredoomed to de feat.\" The vital question of 'Protection and Free Trade were just springing into controversy and the election of Jackson in the campaign of 1828 was by a majority that carried every electoral vote south of the Potomac and west of the Alleghanies. With these Jackson States went New York. The coun ties of New York, Westchester, Dutchess, Ulster, Orange, Delaware and Greene giving all heavy Jackson majorities, while his total majority in the State was upwards of fifty-three hundred. All this indicated something more than mere partisanship. It was, indeed, the opening of a new era. As one observer has well stated it \" a new generation was growing up under new economic and social conditions, despising traditions and Old World ways and manners.\" Andrew Jackson was a typical American and his success was, in a measure, the success of American principles. It is a significant fact that this same period marked the introduction of two important elements in the"], [220, "PROGRESS AND DISASTER. 214 growth of cities and of States \u2014 the adaptation of horse-railroads for the streets of cities and the use of steam as a motive power. The first steam locomotive was built in New York City in 1830, for use on a South Carolina railway, and the railroad from Albany to Schenec tady, incorporated in 1826, was put in operation in 1832. That same year the first horse-railroad was built upon Fourth Avenue, and these novel and speedier modes of locomotion were but the indica tion of the emancipation of the people from old time methods and manners. With this spirit of progress came, however, the spirit of speculation \u2014 alluring, promising and de ceptive. Money, freed from a long existing pres sure by the political and financial complications that threw the Federal deposits into the State banks, suddenly grew \" easy \" and abundant, and all classes were affected by what, at last, proved to be \" a factitious but seductive semblance of pros perity.\" Hard-working men in humble life, like the younger Jansens, had visions of real estate ventures that promised a fortune, and embarked their small savings in various attractive schemes. A new city was planned and building lots \" boomed \" to an extravagant figure in Harlem, where years after, lines of grass-grown streets marked alike the ruin of folly and the graves of"], [221, "PROGRESS AND DISaASTER. 215 blasted hopes. Other places, too, caught the wild fever and in the newer sections of the State this false advance in land values was especially notice able. Real estate rose so rapidly in and about Buffalo that one man in Black Rock (now a part of Buffalo) who had purchased a piece of land for two hundred and fifty dollars saw its value increase within a single hour, from six thousand to twenty thousand dollars and disposed of it for this' latter sum. Such fevers of speculation were destined to turn men's heads and dull their soberer reason. The spirit of hazard became general. Fictitious for tunes induced a spasm of business. Employment became easy and wages increased, trade and manu factures grew in bulk and profits, and the people boasted of their increase and saw no shadow of approaching disaster. The population of the State had risen to a total of over two millions in 1835, two hundred and seventy thousand of this total belonging to New York City alone. Building operations were extensive, property steadily increased in value, culture and refinement were accompanying this apparent prosperity when suddenly in 1835 came the first blow. New York City on the night of December 16, was visited by a terrible fire that destroyed property valued at more than eighteen millions of dollars, laid eighteen acres of city lands"], [222, "216 PROGRESS AND DISASTER. in ruins and swept away nearly seven hundred buildings. Industries were paralyzed, every insur ance company in town was made bankrupt, and this disaster to the capital city was felt by the entire State to which the metropolis was at once both feeder and factor. \" O, no, father, it's not quite as bad as that ! \" said Teunis the younger to Teunis the elder, as on the morning succeeding the great fire they stood surveying the smoking ruins. \" What is the use of preaching trouble ? It is a terrible blow, but New York is rich enough and strong enough to look this loss squarely in the face and build up again, even greater than before.\" \" May be, lad, may be,\" said the older man, shak ing his head doubtfully, \" but I tell you we're not so rich as you think.

We have for gotten that to succeed one must make haste slowly.\" \" O pshaw, don't be a croaker! \" over-confident youth replied to the warnings of age. \" There is money and pluck enough here to build New York up better than it was before. You will see. But we must have more water in the town if we expect to head off such a fire as this again.\" The young man was in a measure correct. The people of New York set to work at once to repair"], [223, "PROGRESS AND DISASTER. 217 the ravages of the fire, and \"with almost miraculous energy the city was rising from its ashes \" when the truth of the elder Jansen's prophecy was all too fully established. For in 1837, when Martin Van Buren became President of the United Sates, and Andrew Jackson \" retired to his Hermitage congratulating himself that he left the American people prosperous and happy \" the crash came. Everything conspired to disaster. Crops were poor and importations heavy ; manufactories were stopped and trade became stag nant; the tide of speculation ebbed even more swiftly than it had risen ; bankruptcy and loss of employment fell alike upon capitalist and laborer, and the general government instead of helping in a time of distress, increased the disaster by arbitrary and crippling decisions. \" Thousands,\" says Mr. Greeley, \" who had fondly dreamed themselves mil lionaires, or on the point of becoming such, awoke to the fact that they were bankrupt,\" and those of less exalted expectations found their small invest ments swept away or involved in the general ruin.

Van Buren no longer the idol of the people received now only revilings and censure and what was termed \" the rumblings of a political earth quake \" were felt throughout the Union and the State.

But, none the less because it was so ungracious a task, he went at it bravely and with all that sturdy tenacity that belongs to the Knicker bocker blood.

Throughout the great State that had felt most keenly the shock, the panic and the loss the same brave work went forward, and out of the ruin of fortunes and the wreck of homes a firmer and surer basis for healthy financial growth was gradually evolved. Lawmakers and capitalists did their part toward atoning for the errors for which they were largely responsible. The toilers of every grade men and women alike, faced the inevitable and fell to work at once. There was much grumbling over the situation and much wrathful criticism of those who (so the people thought) being at the helm should have guided the ship of state more safely through the breakers. But, even while grumbling and criticising, the people everywhere manned the ropes and helped to work the nearly stranded vessel into clear water once more. So, out of disaster came, gradually, new life. For a young country is as full of possibilities as is a young man, and as quickly recovers from wounds and worriment. But the \"political earthquake\" hinted at in the preceding chapter came with the very next election.

The voting public is too often a fickle one, and a succession of unpopular actions turns friendship into hostility. As Teunis Jansen drily observed, when one bright May day of 1840 his jubilant son Teunis the younger, now about to cast his first vote, rushed into his shop tossing his hat for \" Tippecanoe and Tyler, too,\" \" Handsome is as handsome does, lad. Tip and Ty may sing sweet and lovely now, but who knows what their tune '11 be after election. 'Tis like the old Dutch rhyme my grandfather used to have over: ' Peter he played the violin, But Zebedee played the flute.' And let me tell you, lad,\" he added, \" John Tyler isn't going to play second fiddle. Just wait and see which you'll have to dance to \u2014 fiddle or flute.\""], [229, "ANTI-RENTERS STOPPING A SHERIFF."], [230, ""], [231, "A GROWING STATE. 225 And the old voter's warnings came true sooner even than he could anticipate. For when scarce one month after his occupation of the presidential chair, good General Harrison (\"Log Cabin\" and \"Hard Cider\" candidate of those exciting days) was carried to his grave \" the hopes born of his elec tion,\" as Mr. Greeley well says, \" were suddenly buried with him.\" The course of Tyler showed him to be obstinate, perverse and unreliable. Rec reant alike to his own promises and to the trust that had been placed in him he deserted his former adherents and supporters and \" stood forth an im bittered, implacable enemy of the party which had raised him from obscurity and neglect to the pinnacle of power.\" Politics tumbled again and the very men who had in 1840 shouted so lustily the party chorus \u2014 \" We'll hurl little Van from his station And elevate Tippecanoe,\" sought in 1844 to replace their dethroned favorite upon the seat from which they, themselves, had helped to \" hurl \" him. But Van Buren's days as a political leader were numbered. His own partisans in other States were becoming weary of New York's political ascendency. With Henry Clay as an opponent the choice of the other party was too strong to be trifled with, and"], [232, "226 A GROWING STATE. Van Buren's unpopularity in the South had in creased rather than diminished with his opposition to the annexation of Texas. The power of the \" little magician \" was on the wane. New issues brought new leaders to the front. Already the strife between protection and free-trade \u2014 a question upon which so strong a mercantile State as New York must take a prominent stand \u2014 was agitating the nation while still another element was invading American politics \u2014 the party of uni versal freedom. Born in obscurity and cradled in contumely, the weak and universally-proscribed abo lition party of 1840, in spite of the fanaticism of its organizers and the unpopular ways of its leaders, was to bring forward the one burning issue of a later day, absorbing all other questions and drawing sharp dividing lines between Truth and Error. In common with all the Northern States New York was profoundly affected by this disturbing element. Its votes, like those of other protests, swollen by a union with such other elements of local opposition as the Anti-Masons, Anti-Renters, and their kin grew to be of sufficient importance to, at first, only threaten the majority vote, next to weaken it to a plurality and finally to become from a disturbing element, simply, a balance of power party and a victorious majority. In the elec tion of 1840, Gerrit Smith, the Abolition candidate"], [233, "A GROWING STATE. 227 for governor, polled a vote of 2662 ; in 1844 Birney, the Abolition candidate for president, had in New York State a vote of 15,812; in 1848 when (so strange is the whirligig of politics) the very Van Buren who was once its foe became its standard bearer, the anti-slavery element \u2014 become now by a coalition of oppositions, the \" Free Soil party \" \u2014 polled a vote of 120,497 (larger by six thousand than the Democratic vote in the State) and be coming the Republican party in 1856 carried the State by a plurality of eighty thousand and a popular vote for Fremont of 276,007. This re markable advance meant, however, not so much the growth of abolition sentiment as the growth of anti-slavery principles. It indicated the love of the people of New York for personal liberty, and their protest against anything like Southern dictation. Conservative by nature they looked with distrust on anything like radical measures. As Teunis Jansen the elder said to Teunis the younger, when in 1848 father and son separated in politics \u2014 the one voting for General Taylor the other for Van Buren \u2014 the one a straight out Whig, the other a \" Free Soiler,\" \" Let slavery alone, lad, it will work its own death ; fight its ex tension if you will, but don't meddle with it in the States where it still lives.\" To which Teunis the younger replied, \" Progress"], [234, "228 A GROWING STATE. means action, father. We can't let this thing alone, for it won't let us alone. I am not sure, but I am willing to go even farther than the Free Soil platform and stand by the declaration of the Buffalo abolitionists : ' No slave States and no slave territory ! ' \" For this was the day of \"bolts\" and breaks, and there was quite as much sense as sound in the reiterative \"Bolters' chorus\" which a younger brother of Teunis broke into as he overheard the declarations of his elder. This chorus, be it known, was very popular with the dissatisfied ones of that day, and was sung from New York to Niagara, \u2014 \" Bolt, bolters, bolt; Bolt all around, Bolt every day, And bolt again in the morning. Another protest, though of less importance in a national sense, found expression at this time in New York politics. Certain kinsmen of the Jansens who were descendants of those adventurous younger sons who in earlier days had gone as pioneers to the fair but undeveloped sections of Central New York, now found themselves joining with neighbors and new comers in a final stand against the last assertions of feudalism \u2014 rentals for lands which the people themselves had reclaimed and developed. The gloomy forecasts of the earlier settlers to which"], [235, "A GROWING STATE. 229 reference was made in a former chapter now be came facts, and throughout the northern section of the State tenants were protesting against the en forcement of what they deemed unjust claims, and loudly demanded an absolute limit to hereditary leases and an abolition of all feudal tenures. Per manent leaseholds (the property of descendants of the first great families who had, by the favor or the cupidity of royalty, possessed themselves of vast tracts of undeveloped land) they declared to be \"feudal, aristocratic and unrepublican.\" Protest was changed into action, resistance to the collec tion of rents became open and aggressive, and the Anti-Rent war of 1844 was the people's protest against an unwise and tyrannical landlordism. And it does, indeed, seem both absurd and un- American. To demand of tenants who had already, in one sense, purchased the land, even such a feudal fee for the privilege of living upon it as the annual payment of a good, fat chicken or a handful of wheat was of itself so unpatriotic that the last and best of the \" patroons,\" the Stephen Van Renssalaer of Revolutionary times, gave over the collecting and demanding it. His descend ants, however, were foolish enough to insist not only upon the re-establishment of this ancient fee, but upon the collection of the long-standing arrearage. Thereupon the tenants resisted. The"], [236, "A GROWING STATE. 230 \" Helderberg War \" of 1839 was inaugurated among the occupants of the Van Renssalaer estates and similar action by other landlords gave rise to similar disturbances. In Albany and Columbia, in Dela ware and Schoharie counties resistance developed into rioting and bloodshed, where \" Anti- Renters \" disguised as Indians openly attacked and \" disci plined \" agents, collectors and sheriffs. At last the military were called out to maintain the peace, political capital was made of every disturbance and succeeding governors sought to so compromise matters as to adjust the antagonisms between land lord and tenant. This often serious and sometimes picturesque phase of New York history which at one time bid fair to become another instance of \"embattled farmers\" resisting aristocratic oppres sion, was for several years a stirring feature in State politics, and was only finally disposed of when in 1846 the Constitutional Convention of the State of New York abolished forever all feudal tenures and freed the fertile fields of New York's fairest agricultural section from the baronial burdens that had so long hampered its best development. To day New York is one of the six States in the Union which forbids alien landlordism within its limits, while even resident aliens can hold real estate only by becoming naturalized citizens. But, spite of canal and State turnpike and the"], [237, "A GROWING SLATE. 231 continual tide of immigration, some of the fairest portions of the great State were still, in 1840, little better than wild country where, as Mr. Beers de scribes it, \" the farmer was still something of the settler, and the axe and plough were both imple ments of husbandry.\" It needed something more vigorous and pushing to make their partial wilder ness accessible ; and this came at last. In 1S31 the first railroad in New York State (the Mohawk and Hudson) was opened. It ran between Albany and Schenectady, a distance of seventeen miles. In 1832 the Saratoga and Schenectady road was opened, cov ering a distance of twenty-one miles. That same year one mile of the New York and Harlem Rail road was operated. Slowly but steadily the iron trail grew. The New York and Erie Railway, chartered in 1832, was opened to travel on its eastern section (from Piermont to Goshen) in 1841, and along its entire length (from Piermont, westward), in 185 1. The New York Central and Hudson River Rail road was in operation between Albany and Buffalo in 1 84 1, and between New York and Buffalo in 185 1. These great roads with their tributary branches did more than anything else for the internal growth and development of the State, but their advance from crude and comfortless accommodations to their present high state of excellence was slow and painful."], [238, "232 A GROWING STATE. Helped on by all such plans of public improve ment the State grew aj*>ace. Its population in 1845 had reached 2,604,495 an<l the city which was now not only its metropolis, but was the metropolis of America as well, claimed 371,223 as its share of that two and a half millions \u2014 one seventh of the entire population. The Jansens were proud of the great and grow ing city in which they were such humble units. Who is not ? It is local and civic pride that make of our cities vigorous and ambitious corporations, that beautify and adorn them and cause each citizen to see in his own town the very top and crown of municipal excellence. Even our rivalries are our regenerators \u2014 they keep us from going backward. So the Jansens in 1845, like their good \"forebear \" of two centuries before, bluff old Anthony Yer renton, were proud of their native city. It was crowding up now, toward Greenwich village and Murray Hill. Bleecker and Bond Streets were its fashionable quarters, and about the gray stones of the New York University the residence of wealthy merchants overlooked the city's latest park. The restless and dissatisfied ones of king-ridden Europe entered through its beautiful bay as into a promised land, and, along either river front, forests of masts pointed skyward in proof of the city's growing com merce. \" From this point up,\" wrote N. P. Willis"], [239, "A GROWING STATE. 233 in the early \" forties,\" as standing on the bend by the Battery he looked northward along the Hudson River front, \" extends a line of ships, rub bing against the pier the fearless noses that have nudged the poles and the tropics \u2014 an array of nobly-built merchantmen, that, with the association of their triumphant and richly-freighted comings and goings, grows upon my eye with a certain maj esty.\" And proud as were the Jansens of their own great city equally proud and loyal were the workers and home-livers in the other leading cities of the State in that middle portion of the busy nineteenth century. Albany could boast her fifty thousand inhabitants, and Troy her twenty-eight thousand. Oswego and Utica, Syracuse and Rochester were crowding toward or past the score of twenty thou sand, Buffalo had already more than forty-two thousand people who called her pleasant streets their own, and Brooklyn, sister city of the metrop olis, pressed close upon a round one hundred thou sand. Within the borders of the State also fashion had its Mecca about the very spot where, a century before, the colonial baron, Sir William Johnson, had been borne for relief in sickness by his Indian allies. For fully a century it had lain among its' hills for gotten save for its stirring record of Revolutionary strife and victory, and then, so says Mr. N. P.

Libraries, newspapers, churches, liv ery-stables and lawyers followed in their train ; and it was soon established, from the Plains of Abraham to the savannas of Alabama, that no person of fashionable taste or broken constitution could exist through the months of July and August without a visit to the chalybeate springs and populous village of Saratoga.\" It was to Saratoga that the earliest railroad ran, and the \" medicine-spring \" of the Indian and the \" fountain of youth \" of Sir William Johnson became, even early in the present century, so says Willis again, \" the paradise of the unmarried, the Bath of America.\" But it was not for \" the people \" to indulge in such luxuries as Saratog;a even then suggested. Their outings and pleasures were few, their hours of labor were long, their home-living not alto gether elevating or broadening. Such homes as Fleming Farm or that of the Davidsons of which we have already had a glimpse were not known to the majority of New York's citizens fifty years ago.

This dwarfing en vironment is not, even yet, entirely changed and hence it follows that the youth of such sections look toward the towns and cities as goals where life's ambitions are to be attained and satisfied, and with a restlessness born of discontent are ever ready to desert the old home for the struggle and success of the distant city. Already, before 1850, the tendency was in this direction and New York city, in particu lar, became the lodestone that drew not only the youth of its own broad State, but the ambitious ones of other States and of Europe's unsatisfied masses into the turmoil of its competitions and its trades. Nationalities were fusing. The American was being slowly evolved. \" Native American \" parties were formed in vain. The spirit of a real American progress was antagonistic to a selfish nativism.

The fierce fire of competition arouses all the latent energy of human nature, and the Knickerbocker stock, of which the Jansens were a type, and which, despite the cosmopolitan atmosphere of the town, had still for many a generation formed the basis of New York life, recognized the fact that this increas ing competition meant less conservative measures both in trade and in manners or the original stock would be forced to the wall. An influx of New England life, sharp, ambitious and aggressive, in fused, says Mr. Lossing, \" the spirit of business energy and thrift into the social and commercial life of the city and the State ; \" ambitious ones from other sections and from distant lands came, fired with the determination to succeed, and this com mingling of conservatism and energy, of ambition and thrift introduced a new era in trade, and estab lished on still firmer lines the material prosperity of the commonwealth.

This was the result. But the elements contrib uting toward that result were as diverse and often as conflicting as were the nationalities represented in the life of this most cosmopolitan of American commonwealths. Political factions, trade rivalries, religious differences, social distinctions \u2014 these and other, but fully as strong antagonisms made up the reverse of this picture of progressive prosperity. The story of New York has its dark quite as well as its bright side, and it is only because its citizens, whatever their birth or breeding have been, above all else, so thoroughly American that they have advanced, in spite of the perils of both failure and success, to their present strong position. The decade of \"the forties\" drew toward its close. New York, though openly opposed to the unwarranted and aggressive war with Mexico \u2014 \" a scheme of gigantic spoliation having for its end and aim the aggrandizement of the slave power,\" still furnished its quota toward the army of the invaders.

But the dash and daring of such as these did not in all the unbroken line of victories blind the eyes of the thoughtful men of their State to the pity and injustice of the forcible seizure of a province from a friendly and neighboring power. This decade was a time of prosperity with the Jansens. Working along, quietly but determinedly, in their own humble sphere, seeking neither for tune, position, nor political preferment, they lived the simple, manly, God-fearing and upright lives that were the common lot of so many of the work ers and laborers about them. Content with little and not expecting more, they made their homes pleasant family-centres. The little refinements and the necessary cultures of our later day may not have had place therein, but mind and soul alike were broadening ; popular education, a growing in terest in intellectual happenings and a wide-awake study of the leading questions of the day entered more and more as cultivating influences to help, to expand and to instruct. After all, it is homes such as was this simple Jansen household, gathered in its unpretentious, two-story, pitched-roof brick house on Cornelia Street, that by their wise conservatism act as a balance to all the pretensions of wealth on the one hand and all the mutterings of discon tented poverty on the other.

Restlessness is found even in the quietest of homes.

HERE was work in plenty for all the car penters in the Jansen shop that mid-century year of 1850. The city was perceptibly increas ing in population and extent. The people re quired homes ; the mer chants must have stores and warehouses. The brick and brown-stone front age was steadily stretching northward, and the wood-work and fittings of all these new \"high-stoop\" and \" English-basement \" houses furnished labor enough for good workmen and skilled mechanics. The State, too, quite as well as the city, was growing rapidly in population and products. It is asserted that in the sixty-five years, between 1 790 and 1855, the State of New York increased in pop ulation sevenfold \u2014 the city twenty-fold. In 1850 the State had a total population of over three"], [251, "ERRATIC DAYS. 245 millions \u2014 a gain of nearly half a million since 1845 ; within those same five years the city showed a gain of nearly two hundred thousand, having in 1850 a population of 515,547. Between the Jansens of the metropolis and those distant kinsmen of the Jansen name whom Teunis the elder had visited at Rochester in 1827, quite an intimacy had sprung up \u2014 an intimacy which even the high postal rates of the anti-postal days had not been wholly able to dampen. The Jansens of 1850 had, thus, frequent communication with their kins men at Rochester, and gradually came to exchange semi-occasional visits as the slow-going canal gave place to the more expeditious railroad. New York City has always been a powerful attraction to dwel lers in less metropolitan centres, and the descent of distant relatives upon their city cousins has ever been one of the unwritten features of New York's domestic story. There is a summer reciprocity, of course, when the dwellers in hot and dusty streets remember the green fields of their country kins men, but the city as an ever-present attraction is an even more powerful magnet. It was in the course of these later visitations that the Jansens of Rochester astonished their more prosaic kins men of the city with now some unexpected turn in State politics, or now some new and strange development in religious thought."], [252, "246 ERRATIC DAYS. For these years about 1S50 may be noted as the era of erraticism in religious faith and social prob lems, and this was fully as apparent \u2014 if not really more noticeable \u2014 in Central New York than in any other part of the country. The cultured dis beliefs of Massachusetts had as yet scarce crossed the New York boundary, but certain of those sporadic religious wanderings which touch the superstitious rather than the intellectual in man, had already had their birth on New York soil. \" Mother Ann \" and her \" family \" of Shakers had begun their singular system of life and faith as far back as 1779, at Watervliet, near Albany, and that still stranger woman, Jemima Wilkinson, whose story is in itself a marvel, had founded her colony and wrought her pretended miracles in the western wilderness near Seneca Lake, where in 18 19 she died. Solomon Spaulding's buried romance, which subsequently became (under the hands of Joseph Smith, the shrewd farmer's boy of the Ontario clear ing) the famous \" Book of Morman,\" was unearthed on a hill in Manchester, by the shores of Lake Ontario, and the first Morman church was started in that little town ; the half-crazy \" religionist,\" Captain William Miller, evolved his \"end of the world\" theories at his home among; the hills of Washington County, where, an uneducated farmer, he had brooded over possibilities beyond the grasp"], [253, "ERRATIC DAYS. 247 of his limited intelligence, while the still greater paradox of \" spiritualism,\" so-called, found its first \" manifestations \" among; the Shakers at New Leba non, in the home of the Poughkeepsie shoemaker, Andrew Jackson Davis, and by the \" Rochester knockings,\" or \"spirit-rappings\" of the Fox sisters at Hydeville and, later, at Rochester. These excursions into the mysteries, country born and bred, found their way in time, by prosely tism or by hearsay, to the city and, in 1850, were but a few among the many vagrant beliefs \u2014 spirit ual, moral, hygienic and social \u2014 that were by turns interesting and taking captive the people of town and village all through the busy State. This erraticism in beliefs always argues a sea son of material prosperity among the people for, as a rule, the affairs of the soul are with far too many honest folk a secondary matter to the condi tion of the pocket. So, even this unsettled state of thought argues a corresponding and substantial growth for the State from which all these pecu liarities of faith emanated. So, for a season, the Jansens of the city, in common with thousands of just such slow-thinking but excellent people, were, in turn, made curious, attracted, fascinated, disillusioned, disgusted and repelled by the pseudo reforms in religion and science that, all about that middle portion of the"], [254, "248 ERRATIC DAYS. present century, ran their course throughout the entire country. The discussion across the counter and at the work-bench, the gossip of the living room and the disputes of the street as they did much to interest the people in all these new \"isms\" \u2014 spiritualism, magnetism, Millerism, Gra hamism, Fourierism and their kin \u2014 also did much to demonstrate their fallacies and to lead people to a clearer and more practical way of thinking. But there was one \" ism \" that was slowly mould ing public sentiment, and making its way from an apparent fanaticism to real endeavor. Upon his wild mountain farm at North Elba, in Essex County (given him by Gerrit Smith, most gentle of New York fanatics), John Brown was, in 1850, thinking his way toward those offensive measures that were, before another decade, to make him the John Baptist of a regeneration greater than even his over-wrought imaginings could picture. De nounced by politicians and regarded with distrust by the people, the little handful of reformers con temptuously styled Abolitionists influenced those who most despised and ignored them, and finally gained recognition and footing by the autocratic acts of the very ones who most strenuously labored for their overthrow. . \"Whatever of impunity they enjoyed throughout the greater portion of the North,\" says Mr. Greeley, \" was accorded them"], [255, "RESCUE OF A FUGITIVE SLAVE."], [256, ""], [257, "ERRATIC DAYS. 251 rather through contempt for their insignificance than willingness to let them be heard.\" But events were strengthening them in spite of their objectionable speech and methods. The pas sage of the Fugitive Slave Law in 1850 which practically turned the free North into privileged preserves for the Southern man-hunters aroused first the antipathy and then the protests of the people, while the Kansas-Nebraska bill of 1854 demonstrated to the Free States that \" systematic, determined resistance was now an imperative duty.\" Those who had most loudly denounced the ultra demands of the abolition extremists now turned protest into action and showed by their votes their determination to be neither the tools nor the allies of the traders in flesh and blood. In 1852 a mob at Syracuse rescued a fugitive from his captors who, under the shelter of the Fugitive Slave Law, were taking the poor runaway back to slavery. Similar disturbances in the State showed the temper of its people. The liberty convention of 1848 which, meeting at Buffalo, placed in nomi nation for the presidency, Gerrit Smith of New York \u2014 one of the chief among the abolition agita tors \u2014 although then made the butt for ridicule, and regarded as not even a respectable minority, paved the way for the later coalition of opposing elements, helped on the disruption of the Whig party in"], [258, "252 ERRATIC DAYS. 1852, developed into the Free Soil party of 1854, and, in 1S56, carried the State of New York for the new and aggressive Republican party, giving Fremont and Dayton the State by a plurality of eighty thousand in a total vote of nearly six hun dred thousand. The \" Irrepressible Conflict \" had certain unmistakable factors in the Empire State \u2014 busy, preoccupied, and absorbed in its own concerns though that great State was \u2014 quite as distinctively as in the other and more pronounced anti-slavery commonwealths. It is in this stand for the rigdit that the real power of the people is to be seen. In the face of an aristocracy of wealth \u2014 an aristocracy which, even from the old Dutch days, has been a domina ting influence in New York history \u2014 the cause of the people has gone steadily forward. Even in this very issue of slavery against freedom the wealth and fashion of the State were either ranged on the side of oppression or were coldly neglectful of the ques tion involved. The protest of the people was in reality the people's protest. It was the stand of the great middle class (itself often careless and neglectful, but always well-intentioned) against both the indifference of the highest and the venality of the lowest strata of society. A great city is invariably the most culpable alike in indifference and venality and, in this case, the"], [259, "ERRATIC DAYS. 253 advance of freedom's claims was rather in spite of than with the countenance of the great metropolis. Absorbed in its own concerns \u2014 its gains and its loses, its pleasures and its pains, its growth and its grandeur \u2014 the city of New York thought less of right than of policy. By the* plurality of 1856 the rural life of the State of New York, as against the negligence or cupidity of its metropolis, expressed the determination of its people to resist the dicta tion and the pressure of an aggressive slavery. And out of this very selfishness that, for business reasons, would palliate rather than oppose a wrong came the punishment and humiliation of the city. Another era of disaster was at hand. It had been a year of feverish disturbance, this fatal year of '57. Conflicts between the new and old police boards had disgraced the city ; the quar rels of local politicians became almost feuds and vendettas, and not even its philanthrophy and its lavish purchase of a great pleasure park could blind people to its extravagant show of mourning over now a dead pugilist, now a drink-killed political \"boss,\" or its open resistance to the legislative laws against the liquor traffic.

The scheme had been that of his brother Isaac, the unsuccessful California miner, but the promise of great returns blinded the usually cautious Teunis to the necessarily large investments and the risks involved. Departing from the safe policy of his father \u2014 never to risk beyond his ability to re cover \u2014 Teunis had burdened himself with heavy liabilities for material and had given his paper promises to pay depending for their discharge upon the negotiations of similar paper promises taken from the \" capitalists \" for whom he was building. In assuming such risks our honest carpenter was but following the example of thousands of others, equally honest and well-intentioned. But too large a volume of such unstable trade is certain to react upon itself. The \" mountain load of debt \" as Ed ward Everett called it grew with each new day of fictitious business. It became more than the banks could carry or the people could bear. Loans were called in and discounts contracted. Obligations could not be met by those who had entered upon them, and one fine October morning Teunis Jansen rose from a troubled sleep to find himself ruined as his father had been just twenty years before, and by the same never heeded experience of disastrous speculation."], [261, "EVERY BANK IN THE CITY SUSPENDED PAYMENT."], [262, ""], [263, "ERRATIC DAYS. 257 But as Teunis Jansen was not alone in his misfor tune, so, too, his city was not alone in its disasters. New York first felt the blow and suffered terribly from its effects ; by October 14 every bank in the city had suspended payment, enormous rates of interest were paid for loans, and the fear and frenzy of panic closed in upon the town. New York was the commercial centre of the country ; the influence of the metropolis extended far and wide and its sea sons of abundance or scarcity were correspondingly felt not alone in the State but in the remotest parts of the land. Failure followed failure in rapid suc cession, distress and want created even greater des titution, and there was scarcely a home in the land that did not feel the effect of this catastrophe of over-confidence and over-production. Teunis Jansen, overcome with mortification at what he deemed his own cupidity and lack of judg ment, like a sensible fellow, sought not for lame and impotent excuses but blamed himself for his folly and set to work, as had his father before him, to manfully dig himself out of his ruins. No vigorous and well-furnished country long labors under a burden of disaster. It rights itself in time and is finally relieved of its undesirable bur den, only, in another generation, to undergo a similar experience. The household of Teunis Jansen, indeed, felt"], [264, "258 ERRATIC DAYS. supremely thankful that it had not been called to experience the bitterest pangs of the panic at a time when the cry of \" bread or blood \" rang through the streets of the city, when bakers' wagons were mobbed by the starving people, and provision stores were threatened by the hungry unemployed. Boys and girls alike promised to use uncomplainingly if need be lard instead of butter and candle-light in place of gas, if such sacrifices on their part would help their father out of his time of trouble. The good Teunis, however, knew full well that all his advice to his boys to take lesson by his failure would be ignored by them when the allurements of unsubstantial profits came to them. But all the same, looking over the wreck, he sought to give the warning. \" The trouble is, lad,\" he said to young Teunis, a stalwart young fellow of nineteen, \" we as a peo ple are in too much of a hurry. That's what my father, out of his own experience, said to me. It's what I now tell you. But I don't suppose you'll heed it. I heard this Boston man (a deep thinker he is too, lad) Theodore Parker, say in a talk the other day that we of this nation are the least economical civilized people on the earth, and I reckon he's right. The only cure for us is, I be lieve, moderation \u2014 moderation in business, in pri vate and public expenditures, in legislation and in"], [265, "ERRATIC DAYS. 259 everything else. There is no royal road to wealth, lad, and that you'll soon enough discover ; and, whether we are individuals or communities, as we sow we must surely reap.\" Teunis the younger shoved the plane valiantly and said \"amen \"to all his father's \"preaching,\" but the older man knew that when opportunity came his boy would be as eager to risk and venture as had father and grandfather before him. \" We shall never recover from this set-back,\" said the croakers. But recovery is always possible. Even the shadow of financial disaster, black as it had been to so many upon whom it had fallen, grew less and less dense as better times came on and confidence was restored and as, over all the land, the conviction grew that a disaster even more grave and serious than financial loss threat ened the American people \u2014 the disruption of the National Union ! It is in no sense a part of the story of New York to detail or discuss the causes of the War of the Rebellion. The conflict came, not without attempted compromise and prevention, but it came, none the less, as the inevitable consequence of an absolute issue between two determined forces \u2014 an issue not to be longer postponed or compounded, but to be put to the test of strength, of loyalty and even of battle."], [266, "260 ERRATIC DAYS. The State of New York as one of the chief fac tors in the decision of this issue prepared now to turn its protests into action. But not without attempted reconciliation was this determination taken. Its best commercial interests could be served only by peace between the South and North. War meant, for it, commercial disturbance and serious loss. \" No other State,\" says Mr. Roberts, \" held, by its trade, by its insurance companies and by its journals, such close relations with the South as did New York. No other State had such vast interests involved in maintaining friendship with the Southern people.\" In the interests of peace it first moved. A petition, addressed to Congress by the Chamber of Commerce of the City of New York and asking for steps toward a peaceful settle ment of the impending quarrel, received the signa tures of forty thousand merchants and business men of the city, and every city in the State was placarded with posters calling for meetings in the interest of peace and harmony. But peace and harmony were not to be. New York State had given to Lincoln and Hamlin a majority of over fifty thousand, and to the Republi can State ticket headed by Edwin D. Morgan as its candidate for governor a majority of over sixty three thousand. When therefore the demand came for acts as the promise of its votes the people"], [267, "261 ERRATIC DAYS. of New York were not backward. \" They ran,\" says Mr. Roberts, \" before all the demands upon them.\" \" No State,\" he declares, \" moved more steadily forward in obedience to principle ; and no other sacrificed so much at the outset, and through the whole continuance of the struggle for a united republic uncontrolled by slavery.\" The utterances at the \"peace at any price meeting\" convened on January 31, 1860, at Tweddle Hall, Albany, were universally condemned by the people. They grew impatient of even suggested compromise and when, on that April afternoon of 1861, came the tidings that the first shot had been fired and that Sumter had fallen, Republicans and Democrats \u2014 patriots now and no longer politicians \u2014 were united in one common desire to resent the insult to the flag and unite for national safety and national defence. The great Union Square Meeting of April 20 put this desire into practical form; the Union Defence Committee, comprising the foremost busi ness men of the twin cities, was organized, and the words of patriotism and of firm determination there uttered found an instant and purpose-filled response in every town and village, every farmhouse and cross-road even to the remotest sections of the Empire State."], [268, "262 CHAPTER XII. IN WAR AND PEACE. HE boom of the guns at Sumter found an instant echo in every true Northern heart. \"Si- lence is th e evidence of dis- loyalty,\" said the people of Delaware County, and the State of New York, never lagging in time of stress, gave of its young blood unsparingly. And, among the half million men* whom the State gave in defence of the nation's life during the four long years of civil war, one of the first to enlist was Teunis Jansen the younger. * New York furnished to the service of the Union during the Civil War 448,850 men, while 18,197 \"ere represented by their \"commutation\" or \" substitute \" payments. The State claimed also an additional supply of 6000 soldiers to those credited to New York by the books of the war department, while a militia force of 16,213 men sent for short service was not credited in the quota of the State. These figures, with the number of persons who served in official positions in the army and on staff duty, swell the total to fully 500,000 men."], [269, "263 IN WAR AND PEACE. A mother's pleadings and a father's grudging consent could not cool the young blood that leaped to action at such a time of enthusiasm and excite ment, and Private Teunis Jansen \u2014 first a three months man, then a three years man and then a re-enlisted veteran \u2014 returned to his home only after the surrender at Appomatox. Of a sturdy nature, and with a vigorous constitu tion, the young soldier was one of the fortunate few whose record of safety was exceptional. Though actively engaged in twenty-nine battles and skirmishes and with fully as much dash and daring as his comrades, he yet had neither scar nor wound to show, save the spent bullet that he wore beneath his scalp as a memento of Antietam's fight. Proof against the malaria, the exposure and the myriad camp sicknesses that did to death so many of his companions, he was always first at rations and at roll-call, and came home at last Captain Teunis Jansen, the pride of his family and the same sturdy and simple-hearted fellow that had left the city home four years before. His two brothers who caught the war-fever not so much from any latent patriotism as from the let ters from camp that came from their elder brother to stimulate and excite them, were not so fortu nate as was he. One fell in the bloody \"death angle \" at Gettysburg, and one was always on the"], [270, "264 IN WAR AND PEACE. hospital list, only to drag himself home at last a discharged invalid, useless in war and, ever after, equally useless in peace. Throughout the length and breadth of the State, wherever a stalwart arm and willing heart were found, the record of the Jansen household could show its counterpart. The story of the State has no prouder or worthier page than that which tells of the loyalty, the generosity, the faithfulness, the sacrifices and the deeds of the great Commonwealth during those four weary years in which the nation was struggling for safety and for life. From New York City by the sea to Buffalo by the lakes there was scarcely a home from which did not go out some soldier to take his place in the ranks of the Union army or some influence that could tell of equal interest and of equal loss. What Buffalo said of herself in 1S87, looking back over that portion of her local life that has now become his tory, may be said of every town and city in the State : \" Our city has ample occasion for justifiable pride, but on all the bright page of noble achieve ments in her fruitful history there is no time she can trace with more commendable egotism than that which recounts the deeds of her sons on the field of battle.\" \" In zeal and devotion and gallantry,\" says Mr. Roberts, \" New York troops were not behind their fellows in any danger or trial. W'herever the"], [271, "IN WAR AND PEACE. 265 sacrifices and triumphs of the national army 01 navy are told or sung, their deeds will be remem bered and honored.\" The comrades of Teunis Jansen on picket, in battle and in bivouac were fully as brave and fully as faithful as was he. But it is not in fighting-men only that the sum of a nation's courage is to be reckoned. Quite as important a factor in the triumph of the Right as the volunteers of the Empire State was that greater army of determined men and devoted women who gave of their substance and their life uncomplain ingly and unsparingly. The men could give of their wealth and of their poverty, even. Of the first two hundred and sixty millions of dollars loaned to the Government for the prosecution of the war New York advanced two hundred and ten millions. \" The first flush of an era of heroism,\" says Mr. Roberts, \" was upon the people, and the Common wealth counted neither cost nor sacrifice in its determination to save the Union.\" The women could give of their sympathy, their economy and their willing labor that which was not to be reck oned in dollars and cents, but which exerted an even stronger and more lasting influence. In the first months of the war a great meeting of ladies, held in the Cooper Institute, led to the organization of a society for active work, out of which grew the United States Sanitary Commission. And"], [272, "266 IN WAR AND PEACE. in the quiet but effective work of the home circle and the neighborhood gatherings, in the patient endurance, the pinching economies, the heroic sacrifices, of which the world knows little and history keeps no record, the work of the women of the State who stood behind her volunteers, a vast but silent moral influence, may be reckoned in the account of practical aid fully as noble and fully as effective an element as were the bayonets of her soldiers and the money of her merchants. The war at last was over. Victory had rested, as victory only could rest, upon the banners of a nation determined to defend and vindicate her honor and her right. With extravagant demonstra tions of gratitude and respect, of appreciation and pride, the thronging streets of every city in the State, from the metropolis to the lakes, welcomed back, in those spring months of 1865, the sons of the Commonwealth. There were tears for the decimated ranks, there were huzzas for the home returning veterans, there were murmurs of pity, tinged with pride, for the tattered battle flags that told of battle and of storm. And then, the soldiers became citizens once more. Teunis Jansen and his comrades dropped into the ways and paths of private life and of home duties gladly and readily. They returned to the homes that welcomed them and to the ranks of"], [273, "ONE OF THE FIRST TO ENLIST."], [274, ""], [275, "IN WAR AND PEACE. 269 labor that opened to receive them with all the determination and ambition of men who, having played their part in war faithfully and well, hoped now to perform their duties in peace with equal vigor and success. The work of mustering out went rapidly forward, and by the end of the year, of all the volunteers who had maintained the credit of the Empire State upon the battle-fields of the Republic, only seven regiments of infantry and two of cavalry remained in the service. To Teunis and his comrades there was plenty of work at hand. They returned to a State which, even though advancing in material prosperity dur ing the desperate struggle, showed the price it had paid for success in the actual loss of its strongest and most needed workers.* And now these had come home again. They returned to a State that, notwithstanding its outspoken and devoted loyalty, had yet held within it through those four years of war, the ele ments of opposition and of wavering faith.

The war party in the State more than once suffered defeat at the polls, while the opponents of the gov ernment, pushing the permission of free speech to the uttermost, too often hampered and harassed the methods and acts of those who saw more clearly the needs and demands of the hour. Riot and bloodshed rent the chief city of the State in one terrible and never-to-be-forgotten July week of 1863, and conspirators tried again and again to weaken the allegiance of the State and turn its great influence against the conduct of the war. But all to no avail. \" I tell you, lad,\" said Teunis the father to Teunis the home-returning son, \" we had our dark days here, too \u2014 quite as dark as were any you knew at the front. There was the day when we heard that the Merrimac had sunk all the war-ships at Fortress Monroe and was steaming up here to bombarb and destroy New York ; there was the week before Gettysburg when every one had it that Lee's victorious army was on its way to Philadelphia and New York, and that the war was to be transferred to northern soil ; there were the draft troubles, and the riot week, and Early's raid and the Canada plots \u2014 all of 'em made things look black enough, I can tell you,"], [277, "IN WAR AND PEACE. 271 while every set-back from Bull Run to the murder of the President struck home with us just as hard as it did with you.

But, thank the Lord, no matter how black things looked to us, we were bound to stick to it, and stick we did ; and, to my mind, the victory we have gained over the croakers and the rebels at home (and we had plenty of such here in New York) is as grand a triumph as was Grant's over Lee, or the downfall of the Rebellion itself. But it's all over at last. And now, old fellow, the shop's ready for you ; the business is yours. There's plenty to be done; let's go to work! \" And go to work they did and to good purpose. Freed from the incubus of an exhausting war, and the drain in men and money that it demanded, the State of New York in common with the other sec tions of a reunited nation pressed forward on the path of material and intellectual progress.

Its farm lands are quoted as being worth nearly twelve hundred millions ; its manufactures reach annually twelve hundred millions more ; the money in the banks of deposit within its borders show a total of five hundred millions of dollars while thirteen hundred thousand depositors have to their credit in the savings banks of the State another round five hundred millions. The railroad lines that stretch their iron rails across its surface, though an outgrowth of only forty years of prog ress, show annual earnings in freight and passenger traffic amounting to one hundred and thirty mil lions of dollars, while the canals of the State, into whose construction De Witt Clinton threw so much of his energy and faith, now free highways for transportation so far as tolls are concerned, show an annual value in merchandise carried of hundreds of millions of dollars and a maximum carriage, in 1887, of nearly six million tons. The common schools of the State give free education to more than a million children at an annual cost of more than thirteen millions of dollars, while twenty-two universities and colleges show an aggre gate value in grounds, buildings and apparatus of fully eight millions of dollars. Mrs. Bethune's little"], [279, "IN WAR AND PEACE. 273 Sunday-schoool of 18 16 has expanded into over seven thousand Sunday-schools within the State, attended by twelve hundred thousand scholars and teachers. The number of persons actually em ployed in the productive industries of the State (including professional and personal service, agri culture, trade, manufactures, mechanical trades, etc.) reached, according to the census of 1880, nearly three millions, and has largely increased since then. The State Milita in 1887 showed an actual enroll ment of over twelve thousand men and an available reserve of six hundred and fifty thousand. These are wonderful figures for a State which is but one in a sisterhood of thirty-eight vigorous, ambitious and constantly progressing common wealths, and which has but just completed its first century of actual existence as a separate and con stituted State. They show the real work of the people \u2014 just such sturdy, determined, active and practical folk as this mythical family of the Jansens of Manhattan whose share in the continual advance this story has striven to sketch.

It is the victory of the people over their enemies and over themselves, as well, and may be regarded as one of the strongest evidences of the value of free institutions and the worth of free citizenship and free labor. Toward this progress every city and town, every village and community, every farm and clearing within the limits of the State has contributed. The manifold interests of trade and commerce, of manu factures and of vast capital that constitute the strength and life of the twin cities of New York and Brooklyn have worked to achieve the results that are apparent to-day; but, so too, in equal and proportionate measure have these been brought about by the lumber and the foundries, the manu factures and transit trade of Albany, the steel works and car shops, the stove foundries and collar fac tories of Troy, the salt works and rolling mills of Syracuse, the flouring mills and clothing factories of Rochester, the cheese trade of Rome, the starch works and lake traffic of Oswego, the iron works and"], [281, "\" THE BUSINESS IS YOURS ; LET'S GO TO WORK ! \""], [282, ""], [283, "IN WAR AND PEACE. 277 tanneries of Elmira, the nurseries of Geneva, the comriierce and grain trade, the iron industries and railway traffic of Buffalo, the locomotive works of Dunkirk, the carriage and boiler shops of Utica, the flouring mills and paper factories of Watertown, the iron furnaces and breweries of Poughkeepsie, and all the other countless and manifold industries of hand and brain that occupy the attention and contribute to the support of all the six million resi dents of the Empire State.

Upon her western boundaries falls the greatest known cata ract of the world, while one of the noblest and most picturesque of rivers cuts through her eastern limits. She boasts, as her metropolis, the fifth city of the world in population, and the second in commercial greatness, and spans the arm of the sea that sepa rates her two most populous cities with the grandest suspension bridge in the world. Equally great in her follies and her charities, in her resources and her wastefulness, the State of New York houses within her area of less than fifty thousand square miles a greater number of inhabi tants than has ever been colonized in such an area within the same period of time, while her very vastness alike in possession, in opportunities and in action makes her in every phase a State of superlatives. Her intellectual activity is on a par with her commercial vigor. Already, within her chief city, she has gathered a brilliant circle of growing writers who bear out the promise of those earlier days of Irving and Cooper, of Bryant and Halleck, of Hoffman and Drake and Poe, and give force to the prophecy that New York City will, in time, become *The Adirondack Region is said to be the oldest portion of the earth's surface."], [285, "IN WAR AND PEACE. 279 the \" literary centre \" of the nation.

In these later years she has tasted, again and again, the sweets of success, the dregs of shame and the bitternesses of failure. Lured on and in toxicated by the fascinations of the fickle goddess of speculation, she experienced in 1873 one of the worst financial panics of modern times ; lulled into indifference by a display of power and of insolence, her chief city lay for years the prey of a gang of robbers who fed fat at the public crib ; aroused to action almost at the eleventh hour, she crushed them in 1871 by the uprising of an indignant peo ple only once more to fall in these later years a prey to similar evil masters, less successful because less shrewd and arrogant.

And, within their quiet homes, absorbed in the duties that each day creates, modest, unobtrusive, self-helpful, active and trustworthy the Jansens, and such as they, still keep the even tenor of their way, unmoved by the glittering unsubstantialities that lure so many to loss and disgrace, and are, in their honest and quiet fashion, a factor in the great suc cess which their State has attained. For New York is not all bustle and rush. Although, as Mr. Roberts remarks, she \" has never enjoyed the quiet and the repose of Arcadia,\" there are still within her great city as quiet and orderly homes as in her villages and on her farm lands. Despite the hurry and push of competition and of trade the State still holds to many of the plodding and patient ways that marked the old Dutchman of the long ago. Could that first Teunis Jansen of Stuyvesant's day, the honest burgher of the Winckel Street, revisit the city which has gone on without him for fully two hundred years, he would stand amazed at the marvelous revelation of progress and of power that he would see.

Chronology is the best index to the past. The progress of a people is most surely epitomized by the orderly presentation of the dates of such historical happenings as tell the real story of a state or a nation. As the fitting complement to the story of New York already sketched in the preceding pages the same story is here retold in epitome by the grouping of chronological sequences. It begins away back in the mists of antiquity. Pre-historic New York has a story as full of interest and romance, of struggle, advance, decline and progress again as has its later record, but of those pre-historic days but scant remains exist. The pick of the arch\u00e6ologist and the research of the anti quarian reveal for us a few of these data, but the record of thousands of years can be told almost in a paragraph. THE ERA OF BEGINNINGS. Discoveries made at High Rock Spring, Saratoga, disclose the first traces of the aboriginal American in a past of very great antiquity. The pre historic peoples known as the \" Cave Dwellers \" probably occupied New York State as early as from 10,000 to 25,000 B. c. Remains of two hundred and fifty enclosures \u2014 fortifications, walls, tem ples and home-sites \u2014 in Western New York show that portion of the State to have been, for ages, the home of the semi-civilized people known as the \" Mound-Builders,\" and as late, probably, as 1000 B. c. From this estimated date until the close of the fourteenth century A. D. the State was occupied by nomadic Indian tribes who were, about the year 1405, driven out by a branch of the Western Dakotas known as Ho-de-no-sau-nee, or Iroquois. This powerful Indian republic of five confederated tribes held possession of the State at the time of its colonization by Europeans in the early years of the seventeenth century. At just what remote period of time the State was first visited by Euro peans it is impossible to determine. Ph\u0153nician adventurers before the days of the Argonauts or Basque fishermen in the opening years of the first Christian centuries may have seen the river we now call the Hudson. There is reason for thinking that in the summer of the year 1003 Lief the son of Eric, or certain of his Norse followers, explored the Bay of New York and saw the Palisades of the Hudson ; there is a slight possibility that the eight 283"], [294, "284 ERA OF COLONIZATION. Arabian sailors who sailed westward from Moorish Lisbon about 1140 may have ventured into the Bay of New York; there is a possibility, even less slight, that the followers of the legendary Welsh prince Madoc sighted the hills of Navesink in 1170. All this, however, is largely conjecture with but a trifling basis of fact. Either the companions or the successors of Columbus, pushing to the northward, between the years 1500 and 1520 explored New York's water ways, penetrating even into the valley of the Mohawk ; Americus Vespucius may have sighted the Staten Island hills in 1497 ; John Cabot in the same year may have coasted through Long Island Sound and in 1498 Sebastian Cabot, his son, it seems possible, sailed into the Bay of New York. The memorial stone unearthed at Pompey, Onondaga County, and bearing the date of 1520, is an evidence of Spanish visitation, and the ruins of a fort on Castle Island, below Albany, display Spanish workmanship and have been attributed to the same period. Giovanni da Verrazano sailed his caravel the Dau phine into the mouth of the Hudson in April, 1524, and Estevan Gomez, toward the close of the same year, explored and made a chart of the broad Bay of New York.

Space does not permit the enumeration here of the very many local histories, studies and monographs devoted to the development of certain sections of the State of New York. There are town and county histories innumerable ; there are individual biographies in great numbers ; there are pamphlets and documents of special or peculiar interest \u2014 all valuable to students and full of material illustrative of the rise and progress of a great state. But, for obvious reasons, this list can only deal with the few leading or general histories of the State and city. J. R. Broadhead's History of the State of New York in two volumes is an elaborate narrative history of colonial days from 1609 to 1691 ; W. Dunlap's History of New York in 2 vols. extends to the year 1783 ; J. D. Hammond's History of the Political Parties of the State of New York in 2 vols. covers the political history of the State from 17S8 to 1841 ; J. S. Jenkins' Lives of the Governors of the State of New York extends to 1850 ; J. S. Jenkins' History of Political Parties in the State of New York covers the period from 1783 to 1849; J. Macauley's History of the State of New York in 3 vols. extends to 1S00 ; S. S. Randall's History of the State of New York is a brief, general compilation in one volume, extending to 1870 ; Ellis H. Roberts', New York : the planting and growth of the Empire State in 2 vols. is issued in the series of \" American Commonwealths,\" edited by Horace E. Scudder, and extends from the discovery to the year 1887, and W. Smith's History of the Province of New York is a colonial history only and reaches to the year 1762. The voluminous collection of the New York Historical Society, the \" Documentary History of New York,\" in four volumes, compiled by E. B. O'Callaghan, J. W. Barber's \" History and Antiquities of New York \" and J. F. Watson's \" Annals of New York City and State in the olden time\" will be found by the student to contain much valuable and suggestive material. The City of New York has had its story told in more or less detail in the massive History of the City of New York by Mrs. Martha J. Lamb"], [318, "308 BOONS RELATING TO NEW YORK. (2 vols.) \u2014 a work of very great research and interest, and in the more con densed histories of Mary L. Booth (extending to 1859), of W. L. Stone (reaching to 1S70) and of D. T. Valentine (ending with 1850). A \" Story of the City of New York \" by C. B. Todd has also just been published. The hand of the romancer can often present an even more accurate picture of men, manners and customs than can the less unhampered pen of the historian. New York society in its various phases has furnished a theme for many a story teller. Colonial New York, in the old Dutch days, is depicted in Mrs. F. H. Parker's \"Constance Aylmer \" \u2014 a story of Manhattan in 1650; in J. K. Paulding's \" The Dutchman's Fireside,\" and his \" Book of St. Nicholas \" and in Washington Irving's satirical but immortal \" Knickerbocker's His tory of New York.\" Colonial New York under the English governors is drawn in P. H. Myer's \" First of the Knickerbockers (of the time of 1673) and his \" Young Patroon\" (1690); James Fenimore Cooper in his \"Water Witch\" touches the days just after the capture of New York by the English, while his \" Satanstoe \" presents a study of life in Westchester County in 1750 ; Mrs. M. C. Harris' \" Sutherlands \" is a pre-Revolutionary story of an old manor house, in the Catskill region, which is still standing midway between Catskill and Cairo, and Elbridge S. Brooks in his story \" In Leisler's Times \" gives a picture of the province under the people's governor, Jacob Leisler. Cooper's masterly \" Leather Stocking Tales \" also belong to this period. Revolutionary New York is delightfully sketched in Mrs. Amelia E. Barr's \" Bow of Orange Ribbon \" ; in Cooper's famous story \" The Spy \" ; Grace Greenwood's \" Forest Tragedy \" ; David Murdock's \" Dutch Dom ines of the Catskill\"; C. F. Hoffman's \" Grayslaer : a romance of the Mo hawk \" ; Henton's \" My Comrades,\" like \" The Spy,\" a tale of \" the neutral grounds,\" and in E. P. Roe's romance of the Highlands, \"Near to Nature's Heart.\" The Anti-rent troubles of 1750, 1784 and 1845, furnish the motive of Cooper's tales of \" Satanstoe,\" \" The Chain-bearer\" and \"The Redskins.\" Novels dealing with New York life and manners after the opening of the present century are rather social than historical, but H. C. Bunner's \" Story of a New York House \" deserves mention beyond all others, as at once the most charming and sympathetic presentation of one of the most unique phases in the ever shifting story o^N3w.jl(/brk."], [319, "309 INDEX.

Each author has been selected for his or her own peculiar and felicitous adaptation to tell just the story assigned. No set lines or limitations are placed upon an author's method of telling the story of any especial State, beyond the general desire that each volume shall, with historic accu racy, set forth in strong and picturesque narrative, each State's individual story. It is believed that the list thus far made public will be found to directly conform with this intention.
