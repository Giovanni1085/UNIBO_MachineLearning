As long as the boy re mained quiet and unobtrusive during his father's visits, he was not, as hitherto, ordered out of the room ; and when I was allowed to appear downstairs, my brother's doting fondness for me obtained for him the same indulgence. When the first important event in the life of a child, its baptism, or as it was usually called in the country, its christen ing, drew near, Mrs. Dallas, my father's cousin, expressed a desire to be my god mother.

My mother gladly left the arrangements to her : a large house-party was invited, whom Mrs. Dallas kept in hand by her tact and experience in enter taining ; everything was propitious except the weather; that, as the day approached, became close and oppressive : the clouds gathered thickly on the horizon the night before, surely portending a Avet day if nothing more ; in the morning, the grey mist shrouded the distant hills, and fitful gusts of wind sAvirled around the house, giving Avarning of the storm that Avas coming, but hope buoyed up the spirits of the guests. During the half hour or so of Avaiting for the start, the horses in my mother's carriage, young, spirited creatures,"], [18, "6 HAD I BUT KNOWN. grew restive, their arching necks and quivering ears showing their fright and impatience.

My mother recovered her spirits, and received the congratulations of her friends Avith her usual sweetness and grace. My little self was introduced by my god mother, avIio had no children of her oavu, as her adopted child ; her husband, my godfather, recited an ode of his own com posing in my honour.

My father's interest in me increased day by day. As the wee scrap of Avomanhood de veloped, he noted with evident satisfaction each trait of individuality and character; the more vigorously these Avere displayed, so much the more pleased he appeared. I believe the secret cause of his aversion for his son was the gentle nature of the boy, Avho inherited the amiable disposition and sweet expression of his mother, although in features he resembled his father.

Although so dissimilar in character, Ave were devotedly attached to each other. Lionel was a tall, slender boy Avith dreamy brown eyes, which had a wistful expression, regular features, and a delicate complexion. My mother was an accomplished musician ; it was Lionel's delight to sit for hours listen ing, enwrapped in the weird strains of \" Der Feischutz,\" or the pathetic sonatas of Beet hoven. He had a sweet voice (which lent itself most readily to pathetic melodies), and ardently desired to cultivate this talent and also to take lessons from a noted violinist who gave some concerts in our neighbourhood ; but in those days the fine arts were despised, and my father was as strongly opposed to his son being a mu-"], [23, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 11 sician as \"Col.

He used to say the sons of gentlemen should not be \"fiddlers.\" He feared Lionel would become effeminate, and therefore sternly repressed these tastes. I do not think there was any danger of his doing so, for he was expert in all games of skill, and fleet of foot, \u2014 \" he ran like a deer,\" \u2014 the keepers used to say. I eagerly tried to compete with him in all his boyish sports, and he fully shared my favourite pursuits.

My father, afraid he was getting too old and strong for the playmate of a child of five years old, for bade my going alone to feed or play with him \u2014 such interdict I thought absurd. The next time I Avas missing from the gardens, an anxious search was made, and soon the truant Avas found, quietly sitting on the back of the recumbent bullock reading a story book. Alas ! poor Ruby, my Avilful kindness Avas thy doom. I never saw him again, and my anxious inquiries were not ansAvered, no one would knoAv what had become of my Ruby. One of our favourite retreats Avas in the branches of a choice pear tree, Avhich towered far above the other trees of the orchard. From its higher branches we had an extensive view OA'er the gardens, park,"], [25, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 13 and country beyond. Here in the pear season Ave perched ourselves in the early morning, silently watching the squirrels and birds as they clambered and flew around us, and shared our luscious breakfast : the black-capped 'tits swung from branch to branch almost within reach of our hands ; the squirrels, I think, took us for a large kind of monkey, their bright eyes scanned us keenly, but seeing that Ave Avere harm lessly occupied in the same game, of eating the cool, delicious fruit, they accepted the companionship, and dropped do\\A'u shoAvers of pears into our laps : our laughter must have sounded like the chatter of magpies in their ears.

At such cruelty our hearts revolted ; the sight of a Avounded or dead thing quickly brought tears into my eyes, and Lionel would turn faint and pale ; yet he was no coAvard, but lived to look with undaunted eye upon the carnage of the Crimean battlefields.

My nurse was sent for, and at last by threats of being fetched down, we were induced to descend. My father seized upon my brother and raised his stick to strike him ; I ran to him and clung to his upraised arm ; he shook me off and threatened me with the whip ping I had prevented him inflicting upon Lionel. I stamped my feet and cried, \" No, indeed, you shall not ; no man ought to strike a woman.\" I rushed to the French Avindow of the breakfast room, which usually stood open, and by Avhich Ave were accustomed to go in and out. This morn ing it happened to be shut, but in my blind fury I threw myself against it, and fell through the glass into the room, cutting my face and hands, and frightening my mother and nurse, avIio picked me up and"], [28, "16 HAD I BUT KNOWN. carried me off to bed. My brother was shut up away from me for days, during Avhich much Avhispering passed between the maids ; my mother wept frequently ; a hushed kind of gloom hung over the house- hold. I moped about alone, feeling no pleasure indoors, because there Avas no one to play with, and my Avalks alone with my nurse Avere very dreary. On the third day my father sent for me to go out with him. I rejoiced and hoped that our old life was to go on again as usual. After Ave had gone through our usual round of inspec tion, encouraged by his kind manner, I proposed a Avalk into the village.

We walked on gaily ; I begged for Lionel's pardon, and thought of the feast of good things Ave would have to cele brate the day. Short-sighted little mortal that I Avas ! My father assured me that he Avas not iioav angry with us, but he thought Ave Avere getting too old to run like Avild kids, learning nothing aud doing nothing. If I thought myself a woman, it Avas time I learnt some of the things a Avonian ought to knoAV, and that I might do so he had de termined to engage a governess for me and take me out of the nursery.

A governess ! my young heart beat wildly, the blood rushed to my temples : \" Why,\" I exclaimed, \" do I want a governess ? Surely my mamma can teach me ; I cannot live Avithout Lionel.\" Poor me ! my walk Avas no longer a happiness. The sun shone, the birds sang, but not for me. A governess !

I could not face anyone, not even Lionel, my companion in sorrow, but threAV myself in a passion of grief on the rustic bench in my oavii little garden, where I exhausted myself with sobs and tears. The dinner bell rang, usually a Avelcome sound, but I remained on my bench, my hat on the ground, my hair dishevelled, my eyes swollen with weeping. A footstep coming nearer and nearer aroused me.

The step Avas that of the head gardener : he looked amazed at my rueful condition and asked the cause of my grief. My pitiful tale Avas soon told amid tears and sighs.

These last Avords Avere echoed by my father, who, hearing voices, had turned aside into my little garden. He usually applauded my sallies of temper which amused him ; at other times his sarcastic laugh would quail my bravery. I Avas painfully sensitive to derision.

One morning Ave were discon solately working in our garden, he giving minute directions for the care of his portion, and I, AAdth tears in my eyes, promising to be faithful to the trust reposed in me ; just then the village postboy rode up on his pony ; Ave ran to meet him, for he Avas a great favourite with us.

This was the usual limit of my ride, Lionel running by my side ; the spirit of mischief, hoAvever, possessed me that morning. \" Let us run aAvay and then you won't go to school,\" said I. No sooner said than off and aAvay we went. Billy tossed his head and fleAv, knoAving well the road led home. Lionel's fleetness of foot served him uoav in good part. The dilemma of the postboy, when he found the pony gone, may be imagined ; his cries did not reach Billy, whose hoofs were ringing along the dry road. Pie therefore accepted the situation and con tentedly tramped the rest of his round, and the three miles back to Knellburn."], [37, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 25 Thither too Ave sped, delighted Avith our adventure. Arrived at the post-office yard, we put Billy up in his stable undetected, and Avandered up and doAvn the streets of the small toAvn until Ave had exhausted the contents of our purses. Then we Avere at a loss Avhat to do ; the people in the shops, or those Ave met in the streets, looked in quiringly at us. We were not accustomed to be there alone, nor in our garden dress. What could we do ? We were too tired to walk home ; should Ave throAV ourselves upon the kindness of Dr. Graham ? As we reached his door he drove up in his gig, returning from his morning round. \" Bless my heart, my dears, Avhence come ye ? \" exclaimed the alarmed doctor, looking up and cIoavu the street. Seeing us alone, his first thought Avas of some suddeu illness requiring his attendance, but when"], [38, "26 HAD I BUT KNOWN. our faltering lips had explained the mystery his hearty laugh rang out, and hurrying us into the house, he called to his Avife : ' ' Here are two little pilgrims needing food and rest ; give them plenty of both, and this afternoon I will take them on a stage farther in the gig.\" This delighted us; Ave hoped that we had got to the enchanted castle, where abundance reigned and the good genii would transport us to fairylands, Avhere governesses and schools Avere unknown, albeit, the castle was a very commonplace modern house, standing in the street of a small country town, with other houses of exactly the same pattern on either side, the dreary monotony of the street being broken by an occasional house of less pre tension, modestly retiring within a small garden aud high iron railing. Looking from"], [39, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 27 the house of Dr. Graham, the other side of the street presented a more picturesque appearance : a broad path Avas bordered Avith well-grown trees, under whose shade Avere placed seats ; an open space of garden formed a square Avhere the more Mite members of society lived, viz., one or two old ladies, an officer retired on his honours and half-pay, and others, avIio formed an exclusive clique from Avhich all business men Avere excluded, and eA'en the \"pro fessions,\" with the exception of the clergy, only admitted on suffrance. Outwardly, the doctor's house presented to vieAv a flat frontage of four Avindows, Avith the door in the centre, approached by three steps ; above rose two tiers of five windoAVS each, and dormers above them ; Avithin, the spacious but rather dark rooms Avere Avell furnished, and the large draAving-"], [40, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 28 room opened into a garden. We were very fond of this sweet, old-fashioned gar den; it Avas full of delights; there was a spacious lawn soft as a Turkey carpet, studded with fine trees, a tall Welling tonia, aucubas, and silver fir; under a spread ing tulip tree were placed rustic seats and tables made by the doctor in his leisure moments. Nearer the house stood a temple of roses, a marvel of beauty in summer, and a sun-dial, which Avas a never-failing source of interest to us ; a slender arm of the village burn was enticed into this pleas ance and rejoiced as a young child, sing ing merrily all the day as it ran Avith many a ripple and many an eddy round mossy stones, Avhere the doctor's pet trout lurked in happy ignorance of fishing lines and hooks, or it broke into miniature cascades over cunningly devised rockAvork.

The doctor and Mrs. Graham had a passion for gardening, and for all living creatures ; their garden Avas a very paradise for birds, and well these Avere repaid for the chorus of song they poured forth. The doctor boasted Avith reason that no one had a garden and orchard so free from blight and ground plagues as he \u2014 hoAv, therefore, could he stint them of their fair rations ? The truants, after dinner, were regaled"], [42, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 30 in this dear old garden with some of Mrs. Graham's choice elder wine. We entreated our kind hostess to alloAV us to remain with her and be her \" very OAvn children,\" for no little bairnies broke the monotony of her life, yet the overflowing kindness of her heart made her \"the good mother\" of all the young people of her acquaintance ; but of the expediency of thus forsaking our own roof-tree, Ave could not convince her. She talked in her kind, motherly way of our misadventure, which the doctor Avould soon set right, and quieted our fears, so that, although sadly crestfallen, we yet con sented to return home with our host. The prodigals were welcomed with open arms, for great uneasiness Avas felt at our pro longed absence, and messengers had beeu searching for us in all directions. This incident led to Lionel's going earlier"], [43, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 31 from home than my father at first intended. Mrs. Sabine, a AvidoAved sister of my father, invited Lionel to spend some Aveeks Avith his cousins, two fine manly fellows, and proceed with them to Wrington, a noted school in the Midlands, thinking thus to make the Avrench from home less sudden, and Herbert promised to protect his young cousin in the ordeal of a public school."], [44, "32 CHAPTER IV. On the 10th of October the governess arrived. My mother drove to Knellburn to meet her and bring her home to lunch, Avhen I and my little sister Avere to make her acquaintance. We Avere very much excited during the dressing hour. I was dressed in a blue frock aud crisp muslin pinafore, and, being a sturdy little figure, must have looked a little bunch of clothes, as I pranced about the nursery in a state of mind of mingled curiosity and hostility, \u2014 Avhich Avas not lessened by our nurse, Avhose sole charge Ave had hitherto been, aud Avho did not like any intrusion in her department.

Her appearance was not such as to strike a child favourably. Short in stature and rather stout, she might have been gooddooking but for her small, half- shut grey eyes and dark bushy eyebrows, which gave a frowning expression to the other- Avise pleasant face. Her manners were brusque, except Avhen she had a point to gain, as I afterwards found to my cost. She was a Avonian to be feared Avhen she appeared most bland and amiable.

From this moment Miriam was received by her as the favourite to be petted and praised, while I was rigidly kept at a distance and treated Avith severity, curbed and fretted by every device of an uncongenial temper. I was ashamed to cry before my tormentress, but Avhen alone in my little bed my pilloAv Avas wet Avith bitter tears. My talents were not those of a bookworm, or plodder.

My little heart Avas desolate. Lionel Avas gone, the constant companion of my walks and rides and games. I lost all interest in them. The first sorrow is an epoch in a life which often determines the Avhole after course. One day I sat swinging on a gate where Lionel and I had together spent many a happy hour. In my distress I cried aloud, \" Oh, why was I created? 1 have nothing iioav to live for,\" and big tears rolled doAvn my face. An amused laugh startled me.

We then had a musical evening to Avhich a few intimate friends Avere invited. These social evenings were a great treat.

The Vicarage adjoined the Manor. A private gate gave access to our grounds. We were on such intimate terms that the Vicar often joined us in our play hour.

Mr. Hoskyns sought to obtain the confidence of Miss Churchhouse ; he received from her so unfavourable an account of my behaviour, and so pathetic a history of her difficult and trying position at the outset of her engagement, that the bewildered Vicar began to fear his little favourite \u2014 his"], [53, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 41 \" Ephraim was not a pleasant child.\" Any how he saw it was not good for this state of tension between governess and pupil to continue ; an entire diversion was needed before our relations to each other could be put upon a happier footing. Miss Churchhouse kindly gave him the clue to unravel the tangle. Having en gaged his sympathies on her side, she be wailed the monotony and narrowness of her life, and then adroitly turned the con versation to parish topics. \" The few old pensioners committed to my charge by Mrs. Fordyce occupy so little of my leisure time. I am doing so little for my poor neighbours ; but I feel great diffidence in offering my services \u2014 they might not be welcome, or recognised as having your sanction \u2014 yet my heart is burning to minister to them. To be a"], [54, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 42 missionary iu heathen lands,\" she continued, with fervour, \" to sow the seeds of the Gospel in those interesting fields of labour has been my dearest wish. I was ready to go wherever the Lord of the harvest might call me, but my dear mother \u2014 my only parent,\" she sighed, \"objected to part with me during her lifetime.\" The Vicar suggested work nearer home. '' Oh, can I be of any, the least use, it would be so great a privilege if you can accept of my services?\" \" Certainly I will, Miss Churchhouse, most gladly,\" said the Vicar."], [55, "43 CHAPTER V. The next day the Vicar came to request a half holiday for us, and to take Miss Churchhouse into the vilage. We, armed with our hoops, ran joyfully along be side the stalwart Vicar and the beaming governess. At the school, our visit was not so well received as in the cottages. The mistress, who was not very efficient, was taken by surprise ; the few questions put to the children were not so readily answered as she wished. Miss Church- house added to her annoyance by re marking : \" I am sure it is too much for you to teach and control the whole school unas-"], [56, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 44 sisted. I shall be so happy to give you the benefit of my experience. I think I may say,\" she continued, with a little self-satis fied laugh, \"that teaching is my special forte. The Vicar has asked me to under take the superintendence of the schools. It will be a great pleasure to me to help you,\" she added blandly, seeing the in dignant look and rising colour in the face of the schoolmistress, who answered in a constrained tone : \" I was not aware, miss,\" using that most irritating form of address, \"that the Vicar considered any superintendence was necessary. I have not heard any com plaints from him nor from the parents of the children.\" The Vicar looked at his watch and withdrew, on the plea of an engagement. We pursued our way to the house of"], [57, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 45 the clerk. His wife, Martha Grey, dearly loved a gossip. Nothing happened in the village without her knowing all about it, and giving her opinion. Her curiosity had been aroused by the unwonted sight of a lady accompanying the Vicar on his parish round ; and when told by Miss Churchhouse that he had requested her to visit in the parish, Martha, with many nods and smiles, conveyed her approval. Miss Churchhouse threw herself ener getically into her new occupations, yet without neglecting her own especial duties. The church was cleansed of moths and dust, the old, worn altar cover replaced by a new one, and a few other gifts from her sleuder purse gave a bright, cared for look to the bare, forlorn edifice. Everyone rejoiced in the new order of things, with the exception of the school-"], [58, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 46 mistress, who regarded the visits of Miss Churchhouse to the school as inquisitorial, and soon left the field, as she said, open to her. A younger person was appointed. Miss Churchhouse then assumed the post of organist, which the mistress had filled. This gave her an opportunity of improving the musical portions of the church service, and introducing, after a time, a modern hymn book, in place of Sternhold and Hopkin's version of the psalms. In vain, however, she tried to restrain the eccentricities of the good Vicar, who, in deference to the old-fashioned preju dices of his flock, continued to preach in the now defunct Genevan gown. He would commence the service in a volumin ous surplice thrown over his gown, which was far too short for his tall figure, and before ascending to the pulpit, slip his"], [59, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 47 surplice off, and leave it on the floor of the reading desk, whence he mounted two steps at a time, in his haste to conceal the inelegant appearance of his costume, much to the amusement of strangers, who were not accustomed to such very rustic manners. One evening I mischievously abstracted a caricature of the scene from the pocket of one of our guests, and placed it before the Vicar, who, far from feeling annoyed at his grotesque appearance, joined heartily in the laugh at his expense. In defiance of the law of uniformity, he would omit portions of the service in the Prayer Book and interpolate others more to his taste. One trait afforded great amusement to us, and caused Miss Church house much uneasiness: when a gay party of strangers \u2014 visitors for the hunt or the"], [60, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 48 County Ball \u2014 appeared, he would take the opportunity of denouncing the Avorldliness and selfishness and growing depravity of the times, and at the end of a long, elo quent oration of rather a personal character, wind up by saying : \" My friends, as I have detained you with this digression, and I know you are hungering and thirsting after the fleshpots of Egypt, I will not weary you with the discourse which I had especi ally prepared for your edification this morn ing,\" then, promptly pocketing the sermon, he appeared to leap from the pulpit at one bound, so hasty was his descent, while our amazed friends were scarcely able to re strain their mirth until they had left the sacred edifice."], [61, "CHAPTER VI. My godmother invited me to spend my first vacation with her. With all the eager nervousness of a child, I looked forward to this my first visit, yet when the time arrived I felt only the sorrow of the separation from my home, and would gladly have drawn back when I found I was to go alone. Miss Churchhouse was my travel ling companion. My godmother met us at the railway station, and we drove through the streets of the gay fashionable town of Stoneham. It was a brilliant summer day. The white pavements and handsome white stone or stucco buildings glittered in the noonday sun. I was dazzled ; the large 49 d"], [62, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 50 shops and gaily dressed people on the pro menade, the beautiful gardens we passed, all caught my admiring gaze. I, a little, shy, country mouse, felt bewildered with this new world. The first week of my visit was not one of unalloyed pleasure. My godmother objected to my sunburnt face and hands \u2014 my simple wardrobe did not please her. Except a run with my hoop in the early morning with General Dallas or a maid, I was not allowed to go out ; my godmother required me to drive with her. This pleased me quite as well, for we gen erally visited some shops, and Mrs. Dallas was kind in giving me many presents, and buying materials to renew my wardrobe, which, she said, was too rustic. She enter tained a great deal, and intended to intro- duce me\u2014 I should be invited out to many children's parties. The choosing pretty"], [63, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 51 things for me was very entertaining, though the prospect of parties of strangers was ap palling ; nevertheless, I looked forward to my first juvenile ball with intense excite ment. My short hair curled naturally over my head ; this was the one point of which my godmother approved. My dress was a frilled pink silk, pink satin shoes, and silk stockings. When passing before the cheval glass I whispered to Maples, \" Who is that pretty child ? \" utterly unconscious of the reality, until awakened by the laugh of the maid. Arrived in the drawing-room, where the dinner guests were assembled, I felt painfully shy. No children had yet arrived ; my entrance was unnoticed. I stood hesi tating whether to remain or fly upstairs again \u2014 the tears were coming into my eyes \u2014 when my godfather, who Avas talking to"], [64, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 52 a friend, turned, and saw 'my embarrass ment and came forward. \" What little fairy have we here, Dal las? \" said his friend. My relationship and name were explained to him. Taking me by the hand, Admiral Dearden led me to a seat, and sitting down beside me, with a kind smile, began to talk to me of my home, and drew me on to be quite confidential. I told him of Lionel's departure, and my loneliness ; of the tricks I played upon the Vicar and Miss Church house. He laughed heartily, and hoped I should soon be released from the governess by the kind Vicar \u2014 how I could not under stand, and he did not explain. He told me of his ship, and related many stories of sea life, all so new and wonderful to me. Ah, noble heart ! what was this prattle to him ?\u2014 this babbling of a child ? Often"], [65, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 53 in later years have I thought of that even ing. His last words, as he bade me good bye, were : ' ' Cheer up, little one ; God is our Father; He watches over you and me. We shall, I hope, meet again ere long, hap pily.\" His simple faith was, alas! des tined soon to be put to the test. He sailed the next week under sealed orders for the Black Sea ; but his ship foundered on her voyage out, and few were saved to tell of the firm tones which rang out in the awful suspense of those last moments. My first thoughts of vanity were im planted by Mrs. Dallas. I was always elaborately dressed, and my healthy country colour subdued by face powder. Twice each Aveek, a mistress of deportment came to teach me dancing and a graceful carriage. I was required to practise my steps and curtseys before a large glass every day for"], [66, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 54 an hour. I soon grew weary, and longed for the less artificial life of home ; I was not sorry when my visit drew to a close. My godmother gave me many directions to be careful of my complexion, and above all things to practise my steps. Even the sight of Miss Churchhouse did not damp my spirits. When I arrived at Belton I ran into the garden, and, hatless, with my hoop, raced round and round the lawn, and up and down the long walk, until called in to see my mother."], [67, "55 CHAPTER VII. When I was about fourteen, my great uncle Maurice died, and my father came in for his property. When young children we saw a good deal of Uncle Maurice. He lived, we thought, a jolly life in the old castle in Northumbria, surrounded by a train of dogs and devoted to the well-being of his horses. The stables at Bartram were his pride and delight ; everything was in first-rate order ; no expense spared or modern improvement discarded to ensure the comfort and minister to the individual tastes of the stud. Uncle Maurice delighted to keep up, as near as the habits of the nineteenth century"], [68, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 56 would permit, the customs of his ancestors, who had dwelt at Bartram Towers for cen turies. To his never-ceasing regret the old place had been slightly modernised by his father to meet the requirements of his bride, who came from a southern county, and thought the ancestral halls were damp and gloomy. The heavy gateway and drawbridge were removed and a drive made, while the moat was now a cheerful runlet bordering the drive. Within the castle, the tapestried room (now the drawing room) was enlarged by the addition of a small oratory, with large painted windows ; the best bedroom was made a charming morning room, lightened by three windows looking upon a bright flower garden ; the inner hall (there were three \u2014 oak -panelled) became a dining-room ; these transforma tions Uncle Maurice kept for his guests."], [69, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 57 The massive tower, with its oak door thickly studded with iron nails, stood like a sentinel on guard before a square vestibule or outer hall, which led into the great hall, hung with the portraits of many generations of barons. Here Uncle Maurice lived when alone. A long table on the dais served for his dining-room. After dinner he would withdraw to the \" ingle nook,\" where a space was screened off and filled with carved oak settles and chairs and tables. Here he took his diurnal nap, or read his paper, his dogs around him; the young ones on chairs or cushions as they might choose. One gentle fox terrier was privileged to sit in her master's chair, an indulgence she would not allow any other to share. Many times my uncle would take another chair to avoid disturbing the favourite. This hall was our usual play-room ; we often amused ourselves"], [70, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 58 with tracing our likeness to the family portraits. The ladies had an immense advantage over the men in beauty and graciousness. I often wondered how such fair dames could have trusted their happi ness to the custody of such dark-featured lords. The legends attaching to some of them were not less gruesome than their aspect. Uncle Maurice Avould never tire of telling us stories about them. Here Avas one who earned for himself the unenviable distinction of \" Rob of the Ped Hand.\" He was the Esau of the family. He stands Avith his arm thrown over the neck of his horse.

Some Avere dis tinguished for noble deeds in a good cause : rescue from storm by land and sea; for the coast, not far distant, was very dange rous, and famous for its deep caves, Avhere had lurked fierce bands of smugglers and Avreckers to betray the unwary. Others fell in cruel border Avarfare. When EdAvard III. called up the Barons to his first Parliament, the border raider's sword was exchanged for the High Constable's baton, but doubt less many private feuds were avenged in the king's name. The portrait of a lady with a pet lamb standing at her knee Avas my especial favourite. I insisted upon the real"], [72, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 60 or imaginary likeness to my little self. Lionel, to my grief, resembled the delicate, refined portrait of his grandfather \u2014 a book- Avorm \u2014 who died at the early age of thirty. Lionel would stand in his dreamy way, gazing at the portrait, until he seemed to grow more and more like his prototype. It annoyed me to see him single out so tame an ideal. Was it an instinctive presenti ment ? Who shall say ? When my father decided to leave Belton and reside at Bartram, we children rejoiced; but my mother and Miss Churchhouse regretted the change. My mother was sorry to leave sunny Belton, its comfortable Avarm rooms and bright floAver garden. Miss Churchhouse Avas heart-broken ; her relations Avith Mr. Hoskyns had become strained of late. He had five sisters, who in turn resided at the Vicarage. When his"], [73, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 61 eldest sister came to pay her periodical visit, she highly disapproved of the intimacy betAveen Miss Churchhouse and her brother, and determined to put a stop to it. She at once saw the necessity of devoting herself to the care of her brother's house, and the Avork of his parish. Miss Churchhouse struggled to retain her position, for the poor Avere grateful to her, and appreciated the good things she dispensed to them from my mother's purse and kitchen ; but the Vicar Avas too easiful to resist his strong-minded sister. He no longer consulted Miss Church house upon parish matters, and when he met her in company Avith his sister, he avoided speaking beyond the mere courtesies of the day. At Belton he Avould sit idly toying Avith a book, or gnaAving his stick, looking furtivelv across it at Miss Church house. Miss Hoskyns carried her animosity"], [74, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 62 so far as to urge my mother to engage a more efficient governess for me, representing how cruelly I was thwarted in everything \u2014 made to practise things for Avhich I had no talent, and denied the exercise of talents I did possess. Miss Churchhouse had made herself very helpful to my mother in the household and garden. My sister, three years my junior, still required the elementary teaching she was only competent to impart, so it Avas decided she should remain Avith us some time longer, but a foreign gOArerness should be engaged for me. Thus a new phase of life opened for us all at Bartram. Lionel and one of his school-fellows Avas staying Avith us. He had groAvn stronger and acquired more self-reliance than he showed as a child. Both boys were destined for the army, and after their brief holiday were going on to Sandhurst. We Avere a"], [75, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 63 merry party, and made the old halls ring Avith our mirth. My mother, ever ready to give us pleasure, Avished to organise a children's fete. My father objected to late hours : turning night into day Avas all very Avell in London, but in the country, where there Avas no accommodation for man or beast beyond the entertainer's premises, he Avould not subject his horses, or those of his friends, to the cruel exposure of a night in the dark lanes and country roads, in snow or rain or biting Avind ; it must therefore be a \"small and early\" \u2014 it could not be a garden fete, as a deep snow lay on the ground. Lord Hylton came to the rescue, and offered to bring his foresters, a party of sixty stalwart men clad in Lincoln green, Avho executed a variety of athletic games in the great hall, the guests looking on from the gallery. When they sat down to supper"], [76, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 64 Ave adjourned to the drawing-room for dancing and music. I distinguished myself in the song, \" Look always on the sunny side,\" a proof, it is to be hoped, that the despairing mood of my early years had given place to more healthy views of life. This was one of its sunniest moments. The fete was a brilliant and novel scene to us, and a great success. I was much attracted by the graceful figure and easy manners of my neAv gover ness. One day I carefully gathered some flowers for a bouquet, to present to her, yet, in very shyness, I hesitated to give them. Great Avas my indignation when I found Miss Churchhouse had given the bouquet to my sister to present, as from herself. Miriam, however, Avas too honest to lend herself to this piece of petty spite. Madame Michaud Avas not a resident in"], [77, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 65 our house ; she and her daughter lodged in a cottage in the village. She preferred this, as she had her evenings free, and escaped from the equivocal position of a governess in the household. I enjoyed an evening spent Avith her ; on such occasions she Avould always contrive to give some pretty surprise. One day it Avas a \"colour tea,\" then a novelty in this country. The little room Avas decorated Avith a profusion of white flowers and white drapery ; the tea, or I should say the repast, consisted of milk and cream instead of tea, chicken and veal rissoles, potted white fish, and various other white delicacies, ending with milk and soda water. Madame Michaud succeeded in gaining great influence over me. She sa.v that under a brusque manner I was both very sensitive and painfully nervous. Under her E"], [78, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 66 guidance I studied for two years steadily and earnestly, trying to make up for the time lost under Miss Churchhouse. Madame Michaud, who Avas a Belgian, urged my mother to give me the advantage of a residence abroad for a few months. Brussels, at that time, was the favourite resort for families wishing to finish the education of their children. Our neigh bour, Lady Bathurst, liked the plan, and persuaded Sir John to allow her to take her daughters. I Avas charmed. Madame Michaud Avas to be our chaperone and guide during the hours of study. We were invited to dine at Woodholme to discuss final arrangements. Captain SAvinburne, a nephew of our host, Avas staying in the house ; he had just got his company, and was going shortly to join his regiment, under orders for India, where"], [79, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 67 troubles Avere breAving Avhich soon cul initiated in the second Burmese War.

The weary evening, at last, came to an end. My father, during the drive home, sounded the praises of John Charlcote, avIio Avas heir to a large estate, and to unknown hoards of a most penurious father, avIio never accompanied his family into society by reason of the decayed state of his dress suit and his refusal to incur the expense of a neAv one.

Although the object of our sojourn in Brussels \u2014 viz., the finishing of my education \u2014 was not neglected, I yet entered a good deal into society. In the morning I attended classes for languages, music, and drawing. There Avere a' number of English families Avhose daughters attended these classes ; Ave formed amongst ourselves a lively coterie, Avith a brisk interchange of receptions at each other's houses. At the Ambassador's we met many agreeable Belgians, especially the Count de Hauten-"], [86, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 74 ville and his sister. Adele de Hautenville was pretty, piquante, and a splendid musician. It ahvays had been my habit to devote myself to some one person who, for the time, I adored. Adele Avas, during my visit abroad, this favoured individual ; her brother Avas as charming as his sister. The reunions at the Maison de Hautenville were delightful. I Avas attracted by the vivacity of foreign society, and looked back with undisguised distaste at the monotony of English country life. When Mr. Charlcote wrote to my father, making a formal offer of an alliance between myself and his son, I promptly refused to entertain the thought. My father was evidently aware of Mr. Charl cote's Avishes ; he betrayed the family com pact by his eagerness and anxiety lest Mrs. Dallas should resent my obstinacy, plainly"], [87, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 75 revealing the fact that I had been the un conscious object of an arrangement between my elders, in Avhose hands lay my future. Alas ! alas ! What could be more calculated to arouse the indignation of a young girl in her first season, avIio had only just attained her seventeenth birthday ? Moreover, I had a most exalted idea of matrimony. Ignorant of the realities of life, I dwelt only upon the ideal of the poets and romancists of my clay, and fondly hoped my future Avould be as brilliant and romantic as that of my favourite heroines. My dearest mother succeeded in subduing the indignation of my father, Avho could not brook any opposition to his will.

Yet those chains were imper ceptibly weaving their meshes around my heart. The meeting with Captain Swin burne had awakened very earnest thoughts, although I had seen him very seldom after that first meeting at Sir John Bathurst's house. I had ahvays found him to be unselfish, amiable, and chivalrous to a high degree ; every look and tone of his Aroice Avas stamped upon my memory ; whoever I met in the gay assemblies of Brussels Avere tried by his standard and found want ing. It Avas not the love-sick fancv of a young girl, but had, I think, an energising effect upon my character ; my waywardness Avas subdued by the thought of his stead fast aim to achieve honour in his profession, either in life or death ; my strong erratic"], [89, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 77 desires were curbed and directed into higher channels. The proposal of a marriage de convenance, such as that offered by Mr. Charlcote, Avas utterly repugnant to my feelings ; I could not think of it for a moment.

Solemnly seemest like a vapoury cloud To rise before me. Like a cloud of incense, from the Earth : Thou kingly Spirit, throned among the hills, Thou dread ambassador from Earth to Heaven.

The conversation then turned upon the re spective merits of our national lake poets, the Count extolling Voltaire and Rousseau above Wordsworth and Coleridge. After lunch, Ave landed at Nyons.

The next morning I rose tired and heavy eyed, after a sleepless night. In a listless mood I sat down to breakfast. My father petulantly remarked, \"You do not certainly look beautiful to-day,\" alluding to a conver sation that had taken place a feAv days before, and taking up his letters and papers left the room. I neA'er accused myself of the sin of vanity or undue regard for my personal appearance. My mother always thought me too careless. I Avas rudely a.vakened to the knowledge of my unprepossessing looks one Sunday by Mrs. Lumley ; we were returning from church when I heard her remark in a very audible voice to my father :"], [106, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 94 \" How exceedingly pale Ella looks ; she is so dependent upon colour, I fear you will find some difficulty in getting her estab lished.

' ' In that very flattering remark upon Miss Fordyce, I beg to differ with you, madame,\" observed the Count, suddenly appearing upon the scene. He had joined my mother and myself, avIio Avere walking a little be hind Mrs. Lumley and my father, therefore unseen by them. Mrs. Lumley looked disconcerted for a moment, but with a malicious glance at me she tossed her head with a scornful laugh and cried, \" Oh ! you Avicked man, you"], [107, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 95 eavesdropper, hoAv can you act in such a manner on this holy day ? \" The Count with a shrug fell back a few paces. Comment was needless ; he must have thought the ideas of an English Church dignitary's wife upon the Sabbath were, to say the least, insular. When the Count joined us on the morroAV he looked excited and ill at ease. As soon as I could escape the lynx eyes of Mrs. Lumley I Avithdrew to a small apartment to which Ave had given the name of the studio Avhere Madame Michaud sat and Miriam prepared her lessons. The Count folio .ved. I questioned him as to the cause. He said, \" I have again seen the gipsy.\" \" Has she explained her dark sayings about your future ? \" \"Yes,\" he said; \"she spoke with great feeling, begged me to give heed to her"], [108, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 96 words, saying, ' Ah ! my young sir, you do not in your heart despise the poor gipsy ; I have but little more to reveal ; you now rejoice in your youth and your strength, but I Avarn you to prepare for Eternity,' adding, ' You are hungering to hear more about the dear young lady ?

'' Let it be so if you wish : we will seek her once more and make her cast a happier horoscope for you. You know the Well Avhere I saw you and Mademoiselle Miriam one day last Aveek ; she Avas sketching with a little friend, and you sat on the step so solemn and sedate, acting duenna.

The gipsy gave me a hint that she Avould be fouud there.\" The sound of a popular waltz reached us from the saloon. Mrs. Lumley Avas fond of dancing and proposed that the room should be cleared ; the other visitors in the hotel entered into the spirit of the dance. My mother volunteered to play ; her touch Avas light and springy ; the instru ment seemed to speak under her agile fingers ; the Count and myself whirled round in dance after dance to the in spiriting tones of the piano. No one"], [111, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 99 knew, or Avould have supposed, that our hearts were aching with suppressed feeling. That night sleep forsook my pilloAv. The Avords of the gipsy recurred again and again in my mind. Would the Count really die in his youth, he seemed so full of health and hope? Would my life also be as sorrowful as she foretold? Memory recalled long forgotten croonings of my old nurse; vague presentiments which had in moments of deep depression clouded my mind. I thought of the small child sitting on the gate murmuring against the injustice of life. In the morning with Celine, my maid, I started early for the well. It was a long walk. We found the Count awaiting us. He looked as if he had not closed his eyes, but had spent the night in Avatching for the dawn. Celine, avIio"], [112, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 100 regarded us as lovers, kept at a discreet distance. The gipsy did not keep us long Avaiting ; she looked even more weird than at the previous intervieAv. She Avas no ordinary fortune-teller. Her extravagant gestures were, no doubt, intended to give greater effect to her Avords, but she assured me she spoke not her own words. \"I tell you only the truth,\" she said, \" as it is Avritten in your hand, which is an open book. If you, mademoiselle, could read its lines, you Avould know that all I tell you must come to pass. He Avho has marked the lines will bring it to pass.

With an impatient shrug he said : \"Are Ave not tAvo foolish young people to believe the Avords of this trickster? She saw Ave Avere credulous and composed a tragedy to Avork us up to a frenzy.\" Celine came forward and Avarned me that it was nearing the hour for breakfast. We Avalked back to our hotel; the Count remained moodily standing by the Well. At breakfast my father Avas much excited : his letters from home were alarming : a fire had broken out at Bartram and much valuable property Avas destroyed. He declared his intention of"], [114, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 102 returning to England at once. With the exception of Miriam, I do not think Ave felt any regret at this unforeseen change in our plans, but Avheu my father an nounced his decision to Count de Hauten ville, he came to me on the terrace and in a few passionate words implored me to unite my life Avith his. Hoav could I answer in the affirmative ? He reproached me with being terrified by the words of the gipsy. \" I beg of you,\" I pleaded, \" not to urge me further ; much as I grieve to giA'e you pain, I cannot say more.\" The Count in a broken voice intreated, \" Do not utterly reject my loA'e, but permit me to come to England as soon as I can get leave.\" \"Dear friend,\" I answered, \"you will be happier if you do not folloAV us iioav."], [115, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 103 Rather forget this attachment, devote your self to the service of your country, and Avhen you can accept a sisterly affection from me, come, and I av ill gladly Avelcome n you.

Partings are ahvays sad. I pondered over the events of the last feAv Aveeks. My heart Avas torn by contending passions. Ought I to accept the proffered affection of one so true, so sincere? Hoav dare I leave him to despair and perhaps to court the fate so cruelly predicted ; yet must I not at all hazards remain true to my"], [116, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 104 own heart?

On my return home my acquaintance with Maude Clavering became much more intimate. She was some years my senior, and had hitherto presumed upon that fact to treat me in a patronising manner. Noav that I had seen a little of the world, Ave met on more level ground. Maude was an only daughter and rather a spoilt one. The Claveriugs Avere a talented family \u2014 a great acquisition socially to our neigh bourhood. Each member cIoavii to the youngest boy had a speciality for some thing.

Maude was a clever reciter, and I initiated her into the mysteries of tableaux Avhich I had seen abroad. Our mornings Avere agreeably occupied in preparing for these entertainments, and in riding and driving together. I Avas never so happy as in the saddle ; my mare Christabel and I understood each other perfectly. She Avas fleet as a deer and gentle as a lamb with me. In the hunting field she neA'er flinched at anything. Maude was not usually so well mounted ; her Gentle had a most inappropriate name, as Avill be seen. We started for a long ride across the moor one fine September morning. There had been a slight frost in the night; on the heather a pearly rime hung,"], [119, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 107 which glistened in the bright autumn sun, and a freshness Avas in the air, which our horses appeared to enjoy as much as their riders.

It Avas so suddenly and neatly done, I could not resist the inclination to laugh. Happily Maude was able to join in the laugh, and to remount and continue her ride. When she had recovered from the shock of this little incident she abruptly said : \" Have you ever met Captain SAvinburne?

Three times they were driven"], [121, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 109 back ; the third time they succeeded in scaling the ramparts, and soon a loud shout told that the fortress was won.

Would Maude, Avhose assured manner gave her such advantage over me, supplant me? I am very soon disheartened and shrink from self-assertion. Maude's cold, pale blue eyes had no sympathy in them, yet why should I be apprehensive? She kneAv nothing of my acquaintance with Captain SAviuburne. I checked the un worthy thought.

This Avas too much. Throwing down his cards, he rose to his feet and stamped about the room, ejaculating in a stentorian A'oice a variety of choice epithets. \" No one but a fellow in love would make such a blunder,\" he retorted to Mr. Clavering, who vainly endeavoured to soothe his ruffled temper."], [137, "HAD 1 BUT KNOWN. 125 This broke up the party.

Hoav can I rearver my lost ground Avith him ? \" \" By proving yourself innocent of the charge,\" I replied. \" Must I ? Do you think that possible? \" he rejoined, as he put my hand on his arm to lead me to the carriage. The ball Avas a brilliant scene. The three requisites for a good ball \u2014 the flowers, the band, and the supper, were pronounced by the elders to be perfect. My godmother sent me some lovely floAvers to Avear, with"], [138, "126 HAD I BUT KNOWN. an injunction not to let my young sister, Avho then made her debut, surpass me.

Mrs. Wyndham's happiness was bound up in her boy, Avho Avas an enlarged copy of his mother, with the disadvantages of an awk ward gait and stammering tongue.

In one instance, I remember, I predicted a brilliant future for a lady Avho aspired to be a canta trice ; the Professor doubted her poAver and capability.

I joined them a few days after their arrival at Scar borough, and Lionel came on a brief visit. My mother and Miriam entered into the gaieties of the place, and were soon surrounded by a circle of acquaintances. Lionel and I did not join in their amusements, but we rose early, chartered a boat, and spent our days on the sea, fishing, or sailing along the beautiful coast, under the bold headlands, or rocking on the calm bosom of some secluded ba)'.

Rumours of war were afloat ; I knew Lionel Avas Avrit ing for more certain neAvs. He Avas excited by the near prospect of winning his spurs, but I dreaded his departure ; he looked so slight and youthful, so little fitted to endure the hardships of Avar. Suddenly he looked up and said : \"Ella, what has become of that hand some fellow Avith the deep blue eyes who used to look so admiringly at you ?\" \" Who can you mean ? \" I exclaimed."], [150, "138 HAD I BUT KNOWN. \"Why, SAA'inburne, of course, cela va sa?is dire.

My first thought on regaining consciousness was for Lionel, but he Avas gone up to toAvn. As soon as I Avas able to travel, Mrs. Dallas sent for me to remain Avith her in toAvn until Lionel sailed, and then she proposed to take me abroad before the rush of tourists began. The effort to enter into all Lionel's plans perhaps cheered me, for I could not help sharing, in some degree, his en thusiasm. The General and Mrs. Dallas loaded him with everything they could think of to add to his comfort in the coming campaign. The General Avas ordered to Homberg, and as I only required change and diver sion to restore tone to my nerves, Ave proceeded thither. Homberg at that time offered, in addition to its other attrac-"], [152, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 140 tions, the deleterious one of gambling. Mrs. Dallas threAV herself into the excite ment of the Kursaal. I watched the eager crowd of players. At first I felt interested, and longed to join in the game, but General Dallas strictly forbade my doing so. A distress ing incident occurred which shocked the careless throng who nightly crowded round the tables, and happily diverted Mrs. Dallas from the dangerous amusement. A young Russian lady had attracted my attention. She .vas tall and slight, Avith a strikingly handsome face and graceful carriage, always dressed in good taste. Her clothes fitted exquisitely, and her jeAvels were, to me, magnificent. She entered into the play with all the keen in terest of her countrywomen, avIio are by nature gamblers. After a long run of"], [153, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 141 luck, her good fortune deserted her. In vain she tried to recover her losses ; she greAV reckless, and staked higher and higher, but all her efforts only involved her more deeply. In a fit of despera tion she fled from the room, with a cry of despair. Several of the bystanders folloAved her, General Dallas and my self among the number, fearing she would commit some desperate act. She fled in the darkness to a secluded part of the Kursaal grounds \u2014 and before anyone could reach her, Ave heard the report of a pistol. General Dallas hurried me away. We called for Mrs. Dallas, and returned to our hotel. After depositing us safely in our rooms, the General went back to the scene of the tragedy, and learned that the poor lady AA'as found quite dead. No thing definite Avas known about her ; uo"], [154, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 142 inquiries made for her. She was said to be living under a fictitious name, driven by cruel pressure to pursue that desper ate kind of life. After this we left Homberg, glad to escape from the scene of such sad memo ries. General Dallas resolved to try the waters at Vichy, just then coming into vogue from the patronage of the Empe ror of the French. It was exceedingly dull after Homberg \u2014 my only pastime was in driving a pair of Avhite donkeys, sweet little pets, Avith brown harness and bells, jingle-jangling as they tossed their dear little heads, and trotted gaily, to the amusement of the visitors, along the beautiful drives which surround that pic turesque health resort. Mrs. Dallas wished to take me to Paris before returning to England, and as the"], [155, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 143 General Avas much benefited by his visit to Vichy, he convoyed us thither, and left us to our own devices. We took up our quarters at Meurice's, and devoted ourselves indefatigably to sight-seeing and shopping. I kept up as long as I could, but this artificial toAvn life was not to my taste. I could not give the earnest attention to the choosing of Parisian toilettes which Mrs. Dallas desired. Moreover, I Avas anxious about many things, and felt the loneliness of my position intensely. Miriam Avrote me of her engagement to Raoul Mainwaring, O O O? attache to the embassy at Vienna. She was absorbed in her new-found happi ness, Avhile I felt that \"dispossession of the soul that arises from being dispos sessed of our country.\" One day Ave Avere driving in the Bois,"], [156, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 144 Avhen a lady rose from a sheltered seat, and held up her parasol as a signal to our driver to stop.

We drove on, Mrs. Dallas full of amazement at Mrs. Wyndham being in Paris. I felt annoyed, for I realised my own deficiencies acutely in her presence ; her perpetual plaint, or whine, as I called it, Avas monotonous. Her \"saintly\" eyes, as Mrs. Dallas de scribed them, Avere either meekly cast doAvn or suddenly uplifted with a search ing look.

Mrs. Buchanan did not evince any trace of regret on hearing the change in her plans. I had felt weary of \"trivial pomp, and city noise.\" To remain an indefinite time in Paris under these circumstances Avas very distasteful. I drew Mrs. Buchanan to the AA'indoAv and asked to be allowed to take advantage of her escort home.

The passage from Calais to Dover was a trial to our nerves ; the steamer rocked, and bounded, and creaked.

The waves rose higher and higher, but I rejoiced \u2014 they were bearing me to my oavu land.

In that exciting time Avhen our forces were so strained to meet the exi gencies of the Crimean War, he hoped to be ordered for active service. A fareAvell picnic was to be given by the officers of the 101st Volunteers. A few days previously my mother and I were calling at Woodholme where Ave met the Captain.

He handed me the reins and in a marked tone said, \" You aviII be at the picnic ? \""], [166, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 154 I could only say, \" I hope so,\" for my mother either did not hear the remark or chose to ignore it. The day arrived. It happened to be my birthday \u2014 a memorable day in my life. On appearing at the breakfast table I was greeted by kindly letters and little tokens of affection from various members of the family ; but my father's gift Avas absent, and I had not been able to gain his consent to my going to the picnic. When I made my request this morning I met with a per emptory refusal ; he gathered up his letters and papers and quitted the room.

I am so sorry, dear,\" she added, in measured tones, but with no regret in her voice; \"your absence Avill be so inexplicable.\" What could I say ? Honour forbade my blaming my father, and indeed his char acter for geniality with his neighbours, especially Mr. Clavering, Avas so foreign to this arbitrary exhibition of tyranny, Maude Avould have at once attacked him, and brought on me a severe reproof, but no relenting, as I knew by experience.

It ended with a dance at the house of Colonel Ross. Maude said that Captain Swinburne had paid marked attention to Annie Ross. \"They will soon be engaged, I suppose,\" he continued ; \"a very suitable match, very suitable.\" This I did not believe, but the hot blood mautled to my cheeks ; my mother strove to change the subject, but my father recurred again and again to it. What is the meaning of this cris-cross acting on the part of Captain Swinburne ? I did not go to the picnic, or explain the reason of my absence, but if, as his aunt hinted, he had any affection for me, Avhy did he act so ambiguously ?

I breathed more freely ; I put my horse into a sharp canter; only by physical exertion could my perturbed mind gain any degree of calmness. The oft -repeated question forced itself upon me : Why do I care so much avIio Captain SAvin burne distinguishes by his attentions? I dared not breathe even in these solitudes the secret of my heart. Was my love neither desired nor responded to ? Did the tender intonation of his voice, and the light that sparkled in his beautiful loving eyes, mean no more to me than half-a-dozen others?

My mother and Miriam Avere much engrossed by the needful preparations and paying fare- Avell visits. My father presented the bride elect with a light carriage and pair of lovely cream ponies ; she was justly proud"], [177, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 165 of them, and drove my mother every day on their various expeditious. They were named Meteor and Stella ; Meteor had a turn in his eye Avhich I did not think safe, but my father thought it only showed play fulness. Miriam Avas a careful whip, and accustomed to drive Avithout a groom on our Avell-knoAvn country roads. Mr. Clavering often came to see Lionel, and brought him books and papers to read. When he Avas told of Miriam's engagement, he said : \" I saAv Cupid in this house long before any of you, except the victims ; but, Ella, how is it you haAre allowed your younger sister to get the start of you, seniori a priori, I should say ? \" Lionel saw the pained expression on my face, and dreAv the attention of Mr. Claver ing to some seals Avhich he Avas arranging, and"], [178, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 166 I withdrew, glad to escape further raillery. As I crossed the corridor to my oavu room I heard voices below, and supposed my mother had returned, so ran downstairs to meet her. To my astonishment, Maude Clavering rushed up to me, and throwing her arms round my neck, burst into tears : such an unusual display of feeling on her part amazed me. \" What is the matter, Maude ? Come up to my room,\" and I led her quickly aAvay from the gaping servants. \" Your father is here with Lionel, and I hope nothing is Avrong Avith your mother.\" \" Oh, no,\" she cried; \"it is not for my self I Aveep, but for you. Miriam and your dear mother \u2014 \" Her sobs became more uncontrollable ; I felt faint, aud gasped out : \"What of them ?\u2014 tell me all.\""], [179, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 167 \"They were thrown out of the carriage at our gate.

We have sent for Dr. WoodAvard, and I ran here to prevent you being too abruptly told of the accident. If my father is here, let me see him, and he will break the neAvs to your father ; then you must come home Avith me.'' I sent to call Mr. Clavering out of Lionel's room, and prepared to accompany Maude ; but, oh ! the fear that clutched at my heart, an undefined fear, for I dared not give it shape or Avords. I gazed upon the calm, serene face of my dearest mother as it lay Avith closed eyes upon the pilloAV ; there Avas no sign of pain or distress in the composed features. She"], [180, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 168 had received a Hoav on the back of her head, Avhich proved fatal. She appeared to be sleeping peacefully, a sweet, healthy bloom upon her cheek. I held her warm hand, and called her by every endearing name. I had never seen death, and until Mrs. Clavering put her arm round me to lead me from the room, I did not realise the truth ; then I fell forAvard on the bed, and remained for some moments unconscious. Mrs. Clavering entreated me to be com- posed for Miriam's sake, who Avas inconsol- able, and reproached herself for being the cause of the accident. Meteor had shied at something on the road, and then dashed the carriage against the gate-post. My mother Avas thrown with great violence to the ground ; Miriam, trying to save her mother, AVas throAvn forward, and much bruised."], [181, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 169 Death's gloomy shadow hung OA-er our house. My father Avas broken cIoavu; he suffered from spasm of the heart, and any excitement might prove fatal. He Avas not a man of calm temperament; it Avas no easy matter to keep him free from Avorry. The character of Miriam had of late greatly de- veloped ; she Avas unwearied in her atten- tion to her father, driving him out in a Ioav basket carriage, draAvn by tAvo old and very safe ponies, and reading to him, to lessen the monotony of his days. He had deep fits of despondency ; the failing health of Lionel preyed upon his mind. The cher ished Avish of his heart Avould be frustrated if his son died. The ancient title had long been in abey- O J ance. My father found an elaborate pedi gree among his uncle's papers, and had spent much time and money in establishing"], [182, "i7o HAD I BUT KNOWN. his claim to the succession ; if only daugh ters survived his Avork Avas in vain. Dr. WoodAvard, our old friend and family physician, wished my father to consult an eminent specialist. After much persuasion he consented, but to no purpose. The disease Avas too much aggravated by mental distress to admit of any prospect of his ultimate recovery, or indeed long continuance. His medical ach'isers could only aid him by Avatching the case, and as far as lay in their poAver mitigating the suffering. The end came six months after the death of my mother. His last Avord Avas an endearing term by Avhich he had been in the habit of addressing her in their young, happy days. Miriam, although distressed and subdued i O by these painful events, yet found a solace in the tenderness of her lover. She could"], [183, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 171 not enter into my desponding grief. My peculiarly morbid nature led me to brood over past troubles and meet coming ones more than half-way. Miriam's buoyant disposition could not realise the cloud which hung over the couch of Lionel. He, dear, unselfish boy, begged me not to disturb her illusion that he was getting o O stronger. The programme Ave had so joyously planned together was never mentioned ; but Aunt Charlotte, our father's sister, who came to us in our loneliness, advised a quiet Avedding away from home, Avhere we had knoAvn so much sorrow. She proposed to remain Avith Lionel, and that I should take Miriam to Stoneham. My godmother offered her house and to take the direction of every thing ; the General promised to give the bride away. Raoul MaitiAvaring readily"], [184, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 172 obtained leave of absence and met us in London, whence Ave travelled together to Stoneham. Our old friend, Mr. Hoskyns, assisted by the Rector of Stoneham, performed the ceremony. The early morning Avas cloudy, but at the hour fixed for the service the sun shone out with more than usual brilliancy for April. My godmother had exerted herself generously. The result was a very prettily arrayed Avedding. The bride and groom Avere pronounced to be a handsome couple and received a generous shower of rice and slippers. It Avas a trying ordeal for me to sustain my part. I bore up during the breakfast, but when the happy pair left I could not any longer restrain my grief, but shut myself up in my oavii room. Mrs. Dallas begged me to remain with"], [185, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 173 her, and strongly urged me to follow my sister's example. She Avas much disap pointed Avith me and would not listen to what she called \"romantic nonsense, only fit for schoolgirls ; are you Avaiting for ideal perfection? It is your duty to marry. Life is incomplete otherwise.\" When I spoke of past sorroAvs and my anxiety on Lionel's account, Mrs. Dallas reproved me for exhausting my energies and Avasting my life on a malade imaginaire. Mrs. Wyndham had come to Stoneham for the benefit of the hot Avells. (She appeared to be always at hand.) She took my part and besought Mrs. Dallas to re member Iioav in the hey-day of youth Ave long for a soul at one with ourselves. \" Better far, Cousin Eleanor, never to marry, than rush into an ill-assorted union."], [186, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 174 The General coughed significantly and said, \" NeA'er fret, Ella ; the right man will come, and I shall hope to have the happiness of conferring this hand (as he touched mine) upon him, and disappoint all whisperers and talebearers.\" \" Oh ! General, pray don't class me among such harbingers of evil. I kuoAV my own singleness of purpose, and no one can desire dear Ella's good more than I do.\" Mr. Hoskyns returned with me to Bartrain ToAvers. We managed on our Avay to lose his luggage. He Avas so much disconcerted at appearing in his dusty, well-AVorn travelling suit at dinner that the butler came to the rescue, and offered, Avith many apologies, to lend the rev erend gentleman an evening dress Avhich had never been Avorn."], [187, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 175 Aunt Charlotte was the soul of propriety, but I could not repress an amused smile Avhen the old Vicar entered, clad in his borroAved clothes, evidently too small for him. The circumstance reminded me of the black goAvn in the little village church. After dinner Mr. Hoskyns asked us to prolong our stay and not leave him to discuss his wine alone. Aunt Charlotte took up her knitting and I employed my self in feeding Challenge, my Newfound land, Avith cake and biscuits. Dear old doggie, he had a SAveet tooth. When we withdrew to the drawing-room Lionel's couch AA'as Avheeled in and Ave \"cracked\" over auld langsyne \u2014 Miss Churchhouse, avIio had settled down in attendance upon her invalid mother ; our childhood, and other topics of interest.

None felt their soitoavs sank deep into"], [190, "178 HAD I BUT KNOWN. her heart, but their own were cheered, perhaps lightened , by her sunshiny presence. One pouring Avet morning, Aunt Char lotte and I sat long over our breakfast, idly sipping our coffee and lingering over the reading of our letters. One which especially surprised me Avas from the Countess de Hautenville telling me of the marriage of her daughter Avith the Baron Montcalm, and their subsequent journey to England. The letter went on to say : \" As my sister is in London, dear Adele persuaded me to accompany them, and stay with her Avhile she and her husband make a little tour in your beautiful island. I hope soon to have the happiness to embrace my dear friend Elyne, and mingle my tears Avith hers.\" I had forgotten Adele's promised visit. Since it was first proposed Avhat a sea of"], [191, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 179 troubles Ave had each passed through! Aunt Charlotte hailed the prospect of the visit Avith alacrity. Dear old soul, she thought her mission in life was to chase aAvay all sadness from our lives. \" It Avill cheer dear Lionel,\" she said ; \" I shall enjoy the novelty of a foreign visitor ; it will be quite an event in our neighbourhood. I am afraid I shall not be able to enter much into conversation, for you know, dear, it is some years since I had an opportunity of exercising my French, but it Avill be a pleasure to listen to you and Lionel ; and Avhile you talk to the Countess, I can think of a feAv sentences to bring in uoav and then.\" Lionel amused himself with drawing out a scheme of conversation Avith pauses to be filled in by Aunt Charlotte, and he supplied her with phrases Avritten out to be com-"], [192, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 180 mitted to memory. He insisted upon our speaking French at our meals as in our schoolroom days, much to the puzzlement of the servants, whom he coached regularly every day. Madame de Hautenville Avas a sweet- looking old lady ; her silvery hair, which had become white with the shock of the death of her eldest son, gave a softness to her face ; the dark eyebrows remained, and her lovely nut-brown eyes, which reminded me of Henri's, were as brilliant as eA'er ; her manners were charming. She soon set Aunt Charlotte at her ease by speaking to her in very good English. The dear old Pax., as Lionel called her, essayed a feAv Avords in tolerable French, but soon gave it up, pleased to return to her oavii \" noble \" language. In the evenings Aunt Charlotte played"], [193, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 181 for Lionel some of his favourite Scotch airs. Madame de Hautenville and I sat down to a game of ecarte, or to talk over days gone by. She was gratified by the marriage of Adele, saying : \" I have not lost a daughter but gained a son. The Baron AA'as so attached to Henri, my brave boy, they Avere like brothers. Louis is iioav the head of our family. I desire much to see him married to the Avife of his choice. My dear Elyne, I once hoped to take you to my heart as a daughter ; is it possible that my Avish may one day be accomplished ? \" I could not respond to this amiable desire. I remembered Louis as a bright handsome boy, but not equal in any Avay to his brother. The Countess pleaded his cause eloquently, and credited him Avith a decree of love for me I could not believe. O As a dutiful sou he might allow his mother"], [194, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 182 to choose a bride for him, but I could not thus suffer myself to be appropriated. As gently as possible I told madame that I could not give Louis the affection to which he Avas entitled \u2014 a deep shadow had been cast over my life \u2014 I felt old in heart if not in years. The old lady murmured, \"Henri, Henri,\" aud clasped me in her arms. I did not disturb her fond illusion. Ought I to have undeceived her ? I think not. The Countess and my aunt were such good friends, we pressed her to prolong her visit until the Baron and Adele should arrive. Their delight with the freedom of our country life, and the comfort of our houses Avas amusing to us. We had many rides and drives. The moors Avere a source of great interest to the Baron \u2014 so sombre, so silent, so vast, they inspired him Avith"], [195, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 183 awe ; he learnt to understand the grave, earnest character of the people avIio passed a life-time in these solitudes, Avhere Nature often appeared in her sternest mood. Miriam wrote frequently, giving gloAving accounts of her life in Vienna, The beautiful young English bride was cordially Avelcomed in the stately exclusive circles of the Austrian capital, especially by the English colony. She possessed, in an enviable degree, the faculty of adapting herself to any society in Avhich she found herself. Grave or gay, literary or frivolous, like her mother she had a graciousness of manner Avhich attracted both old and young, rich and poor. In the course of a feAv months Raoul Avrote to Lionel : \" The season is over, I have leave of absence, so will bring Miriam to Bartram if you can receive us.

She danced into his room one morning, O' saying, \"You dear, solemn old thing, listen to this,\" and then ran through a closely Avritten epistle from her husband, asking her to propound to us the desirability of accepting the offered appointment. Aunt Charlotte looked disconcerted. The appointmeut was beyond our most"], [197, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 185 sanguine expectations ; Ave could not from any selfish feeling attempt to debar Miriam from sending her hearty acceptance to Raoul. Dear Aunt Charlotte kissed Miriam Avith affectionate warmth ; there was a quiver on her lips but she said nothing to damp her ardour, and Avas soon deeply interested in the practical matter of her outfit. Raoul and Miriam departed for India. My sister, to Avhom the future Avas ahvays enveloped in a golden sheen, Avas enchanted Avith the opportunity of seeing neAv un visited lands, neAv scenes so different from the old world.

Noav our foot steps echoed Avith a Aveird sound in the long corridors. I felt a nervous fear lest the doors of the empty rooms should open as I passed, and someone in the body or in the spirit issue forth. A restless, uneasy feeling possessed me ; the despondency of the past Aveeks, before our late visitors arrived to enliven us, came back Avith a rush ; my thoughts reverted to the old, old regret, hoAv I had been deceived by thoughtless gossip. The en gagement of Annie Ross to Lord Hylton came out a feAv days after the picnic; the flirtation Avith Captain SAvinburne was a pure fabrication. Miriam would probably meet Captain SAvinburne, but hoAv would he meet her ? Our NeAvfoundland dog, Challenge, a splendid faithful felloAv, who Avas devoted"], [199, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 187 to Lionel, appeared animated by the same unquiet spirit. He listened and whined Avhenever Lionel left him, and Avandered about as if looking for someone, giving a short bark or call. His master was suffer- ing physically and mentally ; the strain upon his mind, from the enforced inaction of his life, tried him very severely. So time passed leisurely on with us. With the exception of a few neighbourly callers, Ave saw no oue. One day succeeded another with unvarying sameness. One morning, when I took Lionel his cup of coffee, I thought him looking much brighter, and asked him if he Avould not enjoy going out in his chair, to sit in the sun, which Avas then flooding his room with light. He remarked with a SAveet smile, \"No, thank you, Ella darling, I shall be iu Paradise to-day.\" His eyes had a far-"], [200, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 188 away look as he followed the sunbeam to its source. I felt aAved by his manner, but did not attach any special meaning to his words, except, perhaps, he Avas expecting some unusual gratification, some pleasant surprise. I told Aunt Charlotte hoAv im proved he Avas ; the gloom had passed off, and he Avas himself again. After lunch we left him in the care of Wilson, his faithful soldier servant, avIio had followed \" the young master \" through his short campaign, and caught him in his arms Avhen he fell at Inkerman. In a quarter of an hour after Ave left him, Wilson came to the draAving-room and * O gave me a sign to folloAV him Avithout dis turbing Aunt Charlotte. I hastened after him to Lionel's room ; he lay apparently asleep, but I saAv at once it Avas the sleep of death. My brother ! beautiful in death,"], [201, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 189 a sweet smile playing around his lips. After the first outburst of grief, I thanked God for so painlessly and tranquilly calling him away \" in the serenity of the morning \" of life. The likeness to his father was very strik ing in death ; had they been laid side by side, they might have been taken for brothers. The long illness, borne with heroic patience, had elevated Lionel's ex pression, and matured his features, whilst the divine hand of death had smoothed out all the lines of suffering in his father's counte nance and given him a youthful appearance. Miriam wrote me a long letter full of heartfelt sympathy. She loved Lionel, and kneAV how necessary he noAv Avas to my happiness. Her volatile nature Avas deeply touched ; as at the time of our dear mother's death, the depths of her heart were stirred."], [202, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 190 Her loving words helped to console me, but, oh ! the void, the achiug void, could never be filled. Miriam's life Avas happy and full \u2014 to overfloAv \u2014 of home duties, pleasures, benev olences, Avhich made their demands upon her time and attention, and were fulfilled with exactness. Her marriage had supplied the field she required to perfect her char acter, to bring out the talents she inherited ' O from her mother, in a fuller degree, under more favourable auspices. After touching upon Raoul's public life, and the various people he was associated with, she added : \" We were surprised by a call from your old friend, Captain, noAv Colonel, Swinburne. We Avere at the hill station for a breathing space. Raoul was delighted to renew his acquaintance. \" We both think the Colonel looking ill ;"], [203, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 191 he has a bad cough ; perhaps that accounts for the cold, reserved manner he has iioav, so different from his old genial tone. Raoul rallied him upon his obduracy to the fair sex, but Avithout eliciting any remorse. He acknowledged that he had had his bit of romance, but it Avas a buried hope, never to be exhumed. \" To me the Colonel is most courteous. He looks at me sometimes, when I am talking to others, with such a tender, melan choly gaze. I am tempted to seek his confidence, but I have not the courage, he might resent my curiosity. But his departure from Woodholme Avas very sudden, Avas it not?

The old year was dying out; Avith a strong effort of will, I set myself to the task : it was a melancholy duty but suited my mood. I clung to everything which apparently united me to m}r loved ones. I had shrunk hitherto from reading them. It appeared to me a desecration to unfold these records of lives, many inci dents of which had been carefully concealed from me. One thick packet related to the early death of a baby brother avIio Avas acci- dentally killed, when Ave .vere all too young 192"], [205, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 193 to remember the circumstances; here I read the tribute of sympathy and esteem which was given to my mother in that great affliction.

A packet of closely written epistles to her from a friend on \" the claims of the Church of Rome,\" which, happily, she had resisted. Evening after evening I was occupied in sorting and destroying the contents of the desks and deed boxes. At length I found my task was drawing to an end: only one bulky packet remained, tied with red tape and docketed, \" Radford and Sparrow,\" the family solicitors and trustees.

The candles were burning low ; Aunt Charlotte had retired for the night, Challenge lay snoring on the rug. I did not feel sleepy, so I wandered into the hall and stood before the portrait of the Lady Isabella with the lamb, whom I resembled. Her eyes seemed to rest upon me; her lips, I fancied, would open if I lingered long enough ; what Avould they tell me of her history ? It was said to be a sad one. The clock struck twelve \u2014 I must to bed. When I reached my room I sat down in a cosy arm-chair; reading these old letters had disturbed my mind ; to recover com posure seemed impossible.

Have you felt ill and not called me ? \" and the kind creature almost wept. \" No,\" I quickly answered, \" I felt too tired to undress at first, and sleep over powered me.

I could not venture out, so re solved to complete my task."], [208, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 196 I could not tell why, but I had a sinking feeling at my heart when I took the last packet into my hand. Challenge listed up his head and placed it on my knee, looking at me with his honest brown eyes. Dogs do not know, it is true, \"half the reasons Avhy Ave smile or sigh,\" but what a power they possess of rejoicing with us when we rejoice, and weeping when we weep : often tears have come into the dear eyes of Challenge when I have Avept. I untied the red tape and spread the documents on the table. They related to business matters of years gone by and were yellow Avith age. Thrust in among them was an unopened letter addressed to my self, in the handwriting of Colonel Swin burne. Surely my eyes deceived me, it could not be true ; I tore open the envelope Avith a beating heart, and read the declara-"], [209, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 197 tion of affection Avhich I had so ardently longed for, and marvelled at never receiv ing. With an exclamation of amazement I dropped the letter ; it was incredible.

As I again read the letter so like himself, noble, tender, true, I felt as though I could not endure the thought of the misery I had gone through.

I started to my feet, and threw on my hat and cloak. I could not sit and think over Avhat might have been.

The chill, hoAvever, of my imprudent exposure to Avind and rain, and mental anguish as well, culminated naturally in an attack of nervous fever. Dear Aunt Char lotte and Allison nursed me Avith tender care. My life was despaired of for months ; when the crisis of the fever was past, my prostration was so great nothing roused me. I did not care to live, no hope revived my sinking spirits. I loved to dwell upon the thought of the heavenly life, Avhen all Avould be knoAvn, all mysteries be ended. the pure light of truth would illumine all the dark plots of life, and the golden thread Avhich runs through them all, be seen clearly.

Gradually my mind grasped the truth. I remembered all, and confided my secret to her; she, with loving sympathy, wept with me ; but, drying her eyes, said : \"Why, dear Ella, lie here inactive?\" Dear old aunt, action and motion were to her the panacea for all evils. \" Write as soon as you are able to put pen to paper to Colonel SAvinburne, and explain all,\" she continued. \" You"], [214, "HAD I BUT KNOWN. 202 are blameless about the letter, and he must forgive your petulance ; your suf ferings have been sufficient punish ment.\" This idea gave me the stimulus re quired to lift up my mind from my de jection.

Colonel Swinburne, in command, had hastened to the scene of action, and, after a sharp encounter with the rebels, succeeded in routing them. The Colonel, in the thickest of the fray, appeared to bear a charmed life ; bullets whizzed around him. At last, in the hour of vic tory, he Avas struck. \"He is now in the hospital.
