To the right a still higher mountain, while all around the valley swells the bosom of Mother Earth in lines of perfect beauty. In the background the blue Sierras, with a bloom upon them like the bloom upon a ripe plum. At the base of the steep and winding ascent to the city the consumos were standing about as usual, seeking whom they might devour. They let me pass without question, but, apparently, after wards changed their mind (thinking perhaps that my alforjas looked as if they contained something) and called after me with the universal Spanish hiss, equivalent to our \" Hie!\" I was, however, afflicted with sudden deafness, and pushed on.

He was evidently accus tomed to seeing Englishmen, admired Noble, the make of bridle, saddle, &c, and wished to conduct me into the town, I believe honestly \u2014 he had an honest face. As, however, it is prudent, when alone in these Sierras, to be wary, and chary of giving information about 4"], [58, "54 THE HEART AND SONGS OF one's movements, I politely declined, and wished him adieu with a \" Vaya Vd. con Dios.\" Upon entering the town, his manner was explained. The English were evidently known and, what is more, liked. Inquired of a donkey-boy the way to a posada. He told me. Some men, however, who had been watching my approach from above, called out to him, \" Este un Inglez\" implying that he might have done something more. It was amusing to see how the boy incon- tinently left his string of donkeys all untended and acted as my guide to the posada. Here I was welcomed as if I had been a prince, although the prince's fare was to consist only of the inevitable fried eggs. And, mirabile dictu ! had they not a piece of soap ?

What became of his donkeys all the while did not trouble him a bit. He would find them, no doubt, manana. Like all these mountain pueblos the interior was disappointing. It reminded me a little of Tangiers. Upon return ing to the posada, before turning in, I entered a room where, in darkness, the mistress, cook, and servant were seated round a brasero. Sat down with them to finish my cigar and have a chat. While talking, it struck me after a time"], [60, "56 THE HEART AND SONGS OF that my audience was very attentive. Upon closer observation, however, found that the cook and servant were fast asleep. The effect was soporific. The cigar dropped from my grasp, and, over come by the spirit of the place, I nearly fell into the brasero. So raising my arms in yawning benediction over the sleepers, I vanished to my own room to take my rest in the ordinary posture. In the morning departure was delayed by the rain. The mistress entered my room without ceremony, accompanied by her daughter, powdered \u2014 Spanish women use a great deal of powder. She had come to introduce her.

There hap pened to be a certificate of merit from a school hanging up in the room. I asked if it was hers. It was. She was very pleased, and fetched her school-books, a geography, history, &c, arranged in the form of question and answer. I asked her some questions. She blushed, and either could not or was too nervous to answer. Well, I am sure I should not be certain of being able to answer questions from the school-books of my childhood.

I could see it was expected that I should be impatient, so I hustled my town boy of the day before, who had turned up again, to get something with which to pick out the horse's feet. He brought me a stick which broke (there happened to be a large flint in the hoof) ; I stormed. He then brought a ridiculous little knife.

The fact is, that constant contact with Englishmen \u2014 although, as they had been, doubtless, for the most part, gentle men, it had not bred either contempt or dislike \u2014 had spoiled these people. In their simplicity they are inveterate imitators, and in proportion as they imitate the foreigner, especially the Ingles, their charm is gone for ever. In towns such as Xerez this is very apparent. Take women's head-dress, for instance. It has been said (not by me) that women are more careful than men to adorn the outside of the head. Cock birds of paradise, kittiwakes, and other beautiful things are ruthlessly slaughtered for the purpose. Among birds, however, nature seems to have"], [64, "60 THE HEART AND SONGS OF lavished outside ornaments upon the male.

I wish they wouldn't do so. Gallantry forbids me to say more. Went out of my way a little to visit Conil, a primitive fishing pueblo on the coast. Evidently an Englishman was much more of a rara avis here. Pulled up in front of the Franciscan Convent de la Victoria.

The house adjoining the convent and in front of which we were standing was the alcaldia. He asked if I should like to see the secretary. Having no affairs of state on hand I did not do so. The tower below us facing the sea was the Torre de Guzman, one of those Moorish towers so common in Andalucia. The coloured markings on this one, I observed, were still extant. While we were chatting, Noble had been nibbling at the tufts of grass growing out of the stone seats. His bridle caught in one of the iron supports and dragged it from the socket, pulling away stones and mortar with it. It did not matter. \" It can be mended manana,\" said my friend. Query !

He evidently came to the conclusion that I was trying to evade the Customs by going to sea on horseback, and ran straight down to the shore with long strides to prevent my doing so \u2014 by catching hold of Noble's tail, I imagine. He, however, was courteous enough, simply felt my alforjas, and took my word for it that I had nothing excisable about me.

I seemed to see, too, through the near episode of the Moorish occupation, distinctly, Rome.

As, from its position, Cadiz is a city seldom visited on horseback, I found that the only place where I could put up Noble was at the posada at the back of the town, then crowded with arrieros.

Then, instead of striking the regular road for Puerto Santa Maria, and thence to Xerez, I thought I would try a short cut. After some time en tered a sweet-smelling pine wood, where there were abundance of flowers, espe cially, I noticed, of the white cistus kind.

In this pueblo lived two men, who had been taken charge of respectively by Good and Bad Fortune. One had been named Don Joseph the Prosperous ; the other, Uncle John Misery.

He was not arrogant, but plain, like the high road (camino real). He had no fancies, nor did he use high-flown expressions, as happens sometimes with those who assume fine speech. It does not become them, in spite of all their endeavours. When you least expect it, out comes some nonsense. In a word, Don Joseph and his household were good people, and in his house all were saints, down to the water-carrier. They say, \" Donde no hay harina, todo es mohina \" (\"Where there is no flour, all is animosity\") ; so all that the house of Uncle Misery contained was hunger, nakedness, wrangling, screaming children, and blows to hush them. One day Don Joseph sent for Misery, who appeared before him in such a state that you couldn't touch him even with a pair of tongs, nor speak to him except at a distance, and it would have been quite worth while to have given him a peseta rather than see him. He had such a sour visage that one would rather have said \" Good morning \" from afar. He said on entering : \" Praised be God !

If I go along by the weir I shall get wet ; if over the broken ground I shall encounter wolves and rugged paths. 1 Uncle Misery means to say contento.

He had himself been robbed by brigands in the Sierras, and, as a result, when he ac quired power, evolved this scheme for ridding his country of the pest of brigandage. And the back of brigand age, as an institution, they have un doubtedly broken. This is agreeably brought to mind by the mortuary crosses one comes across at times in the wildest parts of the Sierras.

I have come across an anonymous popular cantar which sings the praises of the Civil Guards. It is too long to give here. The follow ing are the concluding lines. They are given as evidence of the popular esteem into which the force has worked its way, by a strict adherence to its fundamental rules. LA GUARDIA CIVIL. i Feliz el pueblo que puede dormir en la confianza de que hay un angel custodio que le cubre con sus alas !

I also observed during Holy Week in Xerez that the post of honour as supporters of the Andas, on which were carried the Pasos of the Virgin, was conceded to the Civil Guard. Of course a force which beareth not the sword in vain, and is a terror to evil doers, has not wanted detractors. They have been called Polisones (French 7"], [106, "THE HEART AND SONGS OF 102 tolissons), and it has been said that they are employed by a corrupt government for purposes of oppression and to stifle the expression of public opinion. I do not believe it. Neither do I think that any one seriously does so. Only the other day I read an account in the Illustrated London News of an emeute at a Fiesta de Toros at Linares, in the Province of Jaen. The Civil Guards refused, at the Mayor's behest, to quell the disturbance with the bayonet. This may be explained by a reference to Rules 30 and 31 below. Observe how the French and Russian system of espionage is repudiated. GENERAL DUTIES OF THE CIVIL GUARDS. 1. Honour must afford the chief motive for the Civil Guard, to be preserved intact and without a flaw. Once gone, honour can never be regained."], [107, "THE SPANISH SIERRAS. 103 2. The first condition of existence of a force like that ofthe Civil Guards is that its prestige and morale should be of the highest. Without these such a force cannot exist. [I should think not !] 3. The force must be an example to the country of neatness, order, bearing, good morals, and spotless honour. 5. Always faithful to duty, calm and composed in danger, while performing its duties with firmness, dignity, gentleness, and prudence, the Civil Guard will be more respected than any force that resorts to threats and violence. 6. Each individual member of the force, whether private or officer, must be prudent and patient, with out weakness, firm without severity, courteous without servility, and a man to be feared only by evil-doers and haters of order. 8. The Civil Guard ought to be regarded as the protector of the afflicted, inspiring confidence when seen approaching. The man attacked by assassins must hail his coming as his best deliverer. The man whose house is on fire must see before him escape from peril and the flames put out when the Civil Guard arrives upon the scene. The man swept away by the winter torrent must feel himself close to the shore when he sees the glazed helmet and blue tunic of the Civil Guard approaching. For the Civil Guard must freely give his life for the good of any sufferer. 9. Whenever a member of the Civil Guard has the great good fortune to render a service to any one he must never accept a reward, if offered, bearing in mind that he has done nothing but his simple duty."], [108, "104 THE HEART AND SONGS OF But, apart from money, should he be offered a keep sake, let him not regard such keepsake as in any sense a reward, but as nothing more than a token of grati tude, the approval of his own conscience being his only reward. In this way the Civil Guard will retain in his breast the pride of honour, for his great aim will be to satisfy his own conscience and win the esteem and confidence of all. 1 1. Whether stationed in the capital of his country or in the loneliest despoblado, the Civil Guard must never go out without having his hair neatly cut, his beard being shaved at least once every other day, his face and hands washed scrupulously clean, his nails trimmed and cleaned, the leather of his boots, ac coutrements, and arms lustrous and brilliant, and his coat brushed and neatly mended if it should have been torn. 16. The Civil Guard will be attentive to all, always yielding the right side of the street, not only to his own officers, but to the authorities of the town whether civil or military. But especially he will be polite to all ladies. By acting thus his bearing will be a pattern of subordination and deference to some ; to others of studied politeness ; and for all an example of good breeding. 19. The Civil Guard will never enter any house or dwelling of any sort or kind without saying \" By your leave,\" or \" Give me leave,\" and he will never call any one patron or palrona, as do common soldiers. He will enter a house hat in hand, and keep it in his hand until he takes his departure. 24. Should the Civil Guard discover a man in the"], [109, "THE SPANISH SIERRAS. 105 road so severely wounded that he may die before the next village is reached he must then and there take his declaration. 27. The Civil Guard will refrain with the greatest scrupulousness from drawing near to listen to the con versation of any knot of people in street, shop, casino, or private house, for this would be an act of espionage, altogether outside the office and beneath the dignity of any member of the force. 30. The Civil Guard is not a dependent of the Justice of the place where he is stationed ; but he must give his services, if required by the civil authority, and that according to his own rules. 31. The Civil Guard, in certain cases, if he should see the civil authorities of any town allowing evils to exist which they might check, must report to the highest authority, the Governor of the Province. The approach to Ronda by the mule track is somewhat dangerous travelling, the descent to the carretera, about a mile from the city, being especially rocky and bad.

Jews, Turks, infidels, and heretics may here lie down in peace with the orthodox Catholic. The Odium Theo logicum which, whatever one may say, seems to be innate in the human breast, does not enter here. It is quite shut out. One feels it, and knows it.
