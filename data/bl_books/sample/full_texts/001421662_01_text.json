All seemed to urge a more than decent haste, To place the dead beneath the humble sod ; From every heart kind memory was effaced, Low laid and lonely in the last abode. Was this some felon bleeding from his doom ? Is poverty a crime of dye so deep, That no one followed to his clay-formed tomb, And viewed in him how they must shortly sleep. The Flower of Jesse, pure and undented \u2014 Diffusing healing influence o'er mankind \u2014 Bloomed desolate ; in life and death reviled, By those to Mercy's rays perversely blind.

Ne'er may thy path from virtue shrink. Nor lead thy steps to Sorrow's brink, Where Vice has made the heart to sear, Or mute Contrition drops her tear: No, thine shall be a better fate, Which crowns with peace the humble state.

The Sun hailed Albion's bold career, and shed a part- ing ray, On those with whom the starting tear shall name the fatal day ; That Sun, on them for ever set, no more their eyes should view, A grave of glory and renown, was their's at Waterloo. Their country's thunders to the world proclaimed, with vengeful roar, The Star of Gaul, that day, had set to rise again no more : Oh, Gaul ! be warned, nor secret sigh, war's conflicts to renew, Let Mercy plead, dwell at rest, and remember Waterloo.

ON NEIL GOW'S RURAL SEAT. (4) How oft upon this rustic rural seat, Where Tay's pure streams run winding o'er the plain, The prince of minstrels poured his notes so sweet, That endless echoes bore the matchless strain.

Sweet is reflection ; \u2014 and this calm retreat, Pours consolation o'er the wounded breast, With silent melody which seems to greet, And lure the weary to a place of rest. Here lonely wandering from my native place, With many steps far distant have I come.; And Novelty, with ever varying face, Presents her charms around me as I roam. Yet home is sweetest still, to all but them Who have no home, or have that home deserted ; Like roses riven from their parent stem, Once blooming gay, to wither broken-hearted.

With manly vigour wasting in its prime, We saw thy work complete, though brief thy time; Religion cheered thee with her smiles and sighs, And lured thee to the life which never dies ; Divine the spirit which her influence breathed, As round thy brows the fadeless ehaplet wreathed; Pure Nature saw the glorious emblem won, And wept, exulting, o'er her dying son.

Oft have I gazed upon that pale cold light, While slow and silent o'er the sea we bore : All lonely I have watched that noon of night, While others slept and felt their cares no more ; Charmed by the magic of that lovely beam, I've felt past raptures of Love's fairy dream, Again partook the fervent mutual kiss, With one whose spirit dwells in endless bliss. Sweet is the wayward thought which back recals One transient glance through some enchanting maze, Though soon the truthless dazzling meteor falls, And sets for ever on the enraptured gaze, Leaving behind an influence which still, For fleeting moments at the heart will thrill.

To me the charm of novelty hath ceased, And made thy bowers familial- to the eye ; But o'er the mind their power is felt increased, Diffusing more than mortal harmony. Thy rampant woods luxuriant foliage crowns, Fair Nature's record of an ancient name, And the brown hill, which o'er their summit frowns Seems as the herald to a tale of fame. Soft are thy lawns, where Joy serenely smiles, While Plenty sports upon thy fertile breast, And with a cheerful heart the Peasant toils, Nor ever knew the pangs of the opprest. Illustrious Liddell !

They are generally square at both stem and stern ; but that end considered the head, slopes nar rower than the stern, and is formed so as to keep the bottom of the boat, at that part, completely out of the water. These vessels cannot be recommended for their safety ; but in a fine breeze, and smooth water, thev sail with considerable swiftness. Note II. \u2014 Page 26, lhie 5. \" His Cockle Shell one Paddle trimmed.\" A Paddle, is an oar which is short and light enough to enable an individual to make use of one in each hand. Ruthbert, however, trimmed his boat with only one paddle ; it is then made use of at the stern of the vessel, and answers the purpose of a helm. During His Majesty's voyage from London to Edinburgh, the number of boats, filled with specta tors, which lined the eastern coast of England, is almost incredible. The shores of Durham and Nor thumberland, particularly, exhibited a scene of the m"], [90, "86 most lively and picturesque description ; the sea was literally covered with boats, among which were seve ral coal keels, manned with their hardy navigators, and pulling eight oars. The royal squadron proceeded beautifully along the coast of Northumberland ; and many thousands, as well as Ruthbert, had an oppor tunity of evincing their loyalty on that memorable occasion.
