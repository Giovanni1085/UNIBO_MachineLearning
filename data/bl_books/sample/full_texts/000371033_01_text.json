Bv the late Rev. JOHN BRICKDALE BLAKEWAY, M.A. Amongst the voluminous manuscript collections for Shropshire, written or collected by the late Rev. J. B. Blakeway, the historian of Shrewsbury, and now pre served in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, is a folio volume in Mr. Blakeway's handwriting, which contains a history of Shrewsbury Hundred or Liberties, hitherto unpublished. It relates to the following places, \u2014 Abrighton, Abright Husey, Abright Lee, Astley, Acton Reynold, Battlefield, Berwick, Betton Strange, Bicton, Brough ton, Clive, Crowmeole and Gossehill, Edgebold, Grin sill, Hadnall, Hanwood, Harlescote, Hencot, Leaton, Longnor, Meole Brace: Onslow, Preston Monford, Pulley, Pimley, Preston Gobalds, Up Rossall or The Isle, Rossall formerly Down Rossall, Sutton, Sansau, Shelton, Wolascot, Wellbach, Woodcote and Horton. This manuscript history was apparently written about the year 1809. The Editorial Committee having decided that it shall be printed, it will be given by instalments in the Transactions. An effort will be made to bring the manorial history down to the present time, and the additional matter will be inserted in square brackets, to distinguish it from Mr. Blakeway's own writing. The reference to this Manuscript in the Bodleian Library is MS. Top. Salop, C. 6. The list of incumbents at the end of each parish is taken from another of Mr. Blakeway's Salop MSS., entitled Shropshire Parochial Clergy, in two volumes ;"], [12, "2 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES the reference being MS. Top. Salop, C. 9. This is added to make the parochial history more complete ; and is, where possible, brought down to the present time, the additional matter being given also in brackets. In the original MS., at the end of many of the parishes is inserted a printed paper of nine questions, addressed by Mr Blakeway doubtless to the incumbent or some other principal resident in each parish, with the answers written underneath. These questions are printed in full under the account of Abrighton ; but it is not deemed necessary to repeat them under other parishes, though the answers to the questions, duly numbered, are inserted. Mr. Eyton's Antiquities of Shropshire having been published long since Mr. Blakeway's history was written, and much fresh matter, acquired, and possibly some errors having been cleared up, where any impor tant variation occurs it will be found in a foot-note, with the reference to Eyton's most accurate work duly noted. Most of the places now in the Liberties of Shrews bury were in the Hundred of Baschurch at the Domes day survey. In the thirteenth century Baschurch Hundred was represented by the Hundred of Pimhill ; whilst now, in the nineteenth century, it is represented mainly by the Hundred of Pimhill, but partly by the Liberties of Shrewsbury. The Hundred Court was anciently held at Baschurch ; but when Henry I. became Lord of the Hundred it was afterwards held at Pimhill, which gave name to the Hundred. Cf. Eyton, x., 40-42. W. G.

This is a chapel of ease to the church of St. Mary of Shrewsbury, but though surrounded by the liberties of that town, is itself in the Hundred of Pimhill ; its two other townships, however, viz., Woollescot and Leaton,1 are in the liberties of Shrewsbury. Each of these three townships has its separate constable. From the name of this place and some contiguous ones \u2014 Abright Hussey, Abrightlee, Abreywood \u2014 I pre sume the first Saxon that settled upon them was a person of the name of Albert or Adbert ; but in the time of the Confessor it was holden by one Seward. It is written Abretone in Domesday, and was then possessed under Earl Roger by Raynold the sheriff. At the time of the imposition of the dane-geld it was estimated at two hides, but they did not pay to that tax ; for what reason does not appear. Its population in Domesday comprises three villans, a radman, a Frenchman, and four bordars. These occupied two carucates and a half between them, so that the ad vancement of its cultivation in the space of near fourscore years was but trifling. If the manner or time in which this place became the property of the Abbey of Shrewsbury appears upon the charters of that religious foundation the circumstance 1 [Leaton iu Albrighton was originally a member of the Domesday Manor of Albrighton, and the lordship of this estate was in the monks of Shrewsbury, who made an ancient feoffment of it to the Pantulfs. Cf. Eyton, s., 211. There is some doubt whether Wollascott was a member of Albrighton. Ibid, 110. \u2014 Ed,]"], [14, "HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. 4 has escaped my observation. Adbrictun is enumerated among their demesnes\u2014 to the tithes of which they were entitled\u2014 in the certificate of the Bishop of Coventry of an uncertain year between 1168 and 1188 ; and this is the first mention of it as their possession which I recollect, though the Iter of Edward I. states them to hold it by the feoffment of Earl Roger de Belesmo, as it calls our first Norman earl. Three manors of this name occur in Domesday, once written Abretone, twice Etbretone ; all three holden by Earl Roger by Raynold the Sheriff ; in the Saxon times two of them had been holden by a person of the name of Seward. One of these did not pay to the dane-geld, and as Abrighton was an ancient appendage to the Church of St. Mary, I assign that manor thus exempted and written Abretone to this parish.1 It was two hides ; . comprising three villains, a radman, a French man, and four bordars. They occupied between them two carucates and a half, so that the advance of its cultivation in the space of almost a century was but trifling. One of the manors of Etbritone had been holden by a Saxon free man, named Gheri ; but Warin, the first Norman sheriff, who held it under Earl Roger, had granted it to one Alcher; Bainold, however, held it in Domesday. It was rated to the dane-geld at three hides, but the cultivated land was double that quantity, 1 [Eyton's opinion differs from Blakeway here. Eyton assigns to Albright Hussey the ungeldable manor of Abretone of two hides, which Blakeway here assigns to Albrighton ; and the manor of Etbre tone, also of two hides ; whilst to Albrighton Eyton assigns the manor of Etbritone of three hides geldable, of which Domesday gives this account : \u2014 \" Alcher held Etbritone of Warin, who was ancestor of Rainald. Gheri held it and was a free man. There are three hides geldable. There is land for six ploughs. In the demesne are two ploughs, and four serfs, and one Frenchman, and six villains, and one bordar, with three ploughs. In the time of King Edward it was worth twenty shillings, and afterwards fifteen shillings. It is now worth twenty-five shillings.\" Cf.

Of the other carucate no mention is made. I guess the de mesne land to have been granted by Rainold to the Abbey of Shrewsbury, and to form the property which afterwards came to the Irelands.1 Perhaps Wolescot, a township of Abrighton chapelry, which is omitted in Domesday, was the remaining four carucates. The following transaction, wiiich supposes the Abbey in possession of this manor, took place early in the thirteenth century :2 \u2014 Stephen de Thorneh and Godelina, his wife, of whom more may be seen under the article Berwick, with the assent of their heirs, grant to God and St. Peter and the monks of Salop, for five marks and a half of silver, Roger de Edbretona with all his land, and that neither our heirs may not claim any right in the said Roger or his issue (secta),3 we have delivered this present charter to the said Roger and his issue. Teste Thoma de Erdinton tune vice-comite et toto comitatu. No. 133. Erdinton was sheriff to John. This deed seems to place these religious men in the amiable light of redeeming this villein and his posterity at their own expense, but not for their own emolument, as the charter of enfranchisement was delivered to the villein himself in full county court ; and therefore I 1 [Eyton points out that Alcher, the ancestor of Fitz Aer, had, before Domesday . given Albrighton to Shrewsbury Abbey, but the Domesday Commissioners did not find the gift so substantiated as to warrant their registration of it, and therefore spoke of it in a guarded manner. Earl Roger's charter to Shrewsbury Abbey says : \u2014 \"Aherius dedit Etburtonam cum suis appendieiis.\" The confirma tions of Henry I., Henry II. , Stephen, and Henry III., duly record Alcher's grant. Cf Eyton x., 107-8.\u2014 Ed.] 2 [Eytbn dates this quit-claim between 1204 and 1214, and gives, as the reference, \" Salop Chartulary, No. 33.\" Stephen de Turnham was lord of Great Berwick, in right of Edelina, his wife. The quit claim was probably of some tenement, held in villeinage, and which lay between Berwick and Albrighton. Cf.

The present deed belongs to King John's reign, from the seventh year of which Erdinton stands on the pipe rolls as custos of the county ; here he is termed sheriff, a proof of the identity of those offices. In 40 Henry III. , the abbot and convent obtained a grant of free warren in their manor of Edbriton. In the perambulation of the forests of Shropshire, 28 Edward I., it is called Monkes Adbrighton, and half of it is ordered to be deaftbrested, together with the whole of Adbrighton Hese and Adbrightleigh.1 In 6 Hen. VI., it was called Adbryghton Abbots. See Battlefield. In 26 Hen. VIII., the Abbey is found to have \u00a39 13s. 8d. in Adbrighton, and 6s. 8d. of the Church there. Upon the dissolution, Henry VIII., on the 31st of October, in the 35th year of his reign, 1543, granted inter alia the Manor of Abrighton, late belonging to the Abbey of Shrewsbury, in the parish of St. Mary, and all the appurtenances, lands, etc., wards, marriages, etc., emoluments, hereditaments, etc., etc., etc., lying, being, arising, growing, and renewing in the town, fields, parish, or hamlet of the blessed Virgin Mary in Salop and elsewhere in the said county belonging to the said manor, with divers lands, tenements, and hereditaments in Long haye, etc., with all tithes ofthe demesne of the said Manor, now or late in the tenure of the College of St. Mary aforesaid in the town of Shrewsbury, to Thomas Ireland, gent., for the sum of i[In the Pimhill Hundred-Roll of 1255 it is termed \" Adbrichton Monachorum,\" or Monks' Albrighton.

The family, from authentic deeds, was residing in good figure at Oswestry through the whole ofthe 15th century, where the elder branch terminated in females, but the first, as I conceive, who settled at Shrewsbury (though his father is styled of that town in the Visita tion), was David Ireland, whose admission into the company of mercers, ironmongers, and goldsmiths, is thus recorded in 6 Hen.

It was Thomas Ireland, the eldest son of David, who purchased Albrighton from the Crown. He, like his father, was free of the mercers' company, and like him, served the office of bailiff there between 1538 and 1550.

ABRIGHT HUSSEY, Anciently Adbrighton Hose, is a farm in the Parish of Battlefield (which was originally a part of it), in the Liberties of Shrewsbury. From the name of this place and some contiguous ones, Abrighton, Abrightlee, and Abrey-wood, I presume the first Saxon who settled upon them was a person of the name of Albert or Adbert ; but in the time of the Confessor, it was holden by one Seward. It is written Etbretone in Domesday, and was then possessed, under Earl Roger, by Rainold, the sheriff, and under him by one Herbert. Seward held it in the Saxon times. At the imposition of the Dane-geld, it had been estimated at two hides ; one carucate is in the demesne. The other1 was occupied by eight villans and four bordars, so that its cultivation in the space of almost a century had made no progress.2 The family of Hussey, anciently Hose, in Latin Hosatus, derived their name from the hose or houce \u2014 the military gaters (see Anstis on the Garter, v. 2, p. 295), used by their progenitor, and in his manner of wearing which, he had in some way or other made himself remarkable enough to acquire it as a name, and to bear them in his arms. 1 [It should be two. The eight villans and four bordars occupied two ploughlands. The word which Blakeway has translated carucate, is not carucata (carucate), but caruca (team). The Domesday hide of Shropshire probably equalled something more than 240 statute acres. Cf. Transactions, i. 106. \u2014 Ed.] 2 [Eyton assigns to Albright Hussey the above Manor, and also the Manor of two hides ungeldable which Blakeway assigned to Albrighton (see p. 96), of which Domesday gives this account : \" The same Rainald holds Abretone. Seuuard held it. There are two hides ungeldable. There are three villans, and one Radman, and one Frenchman, with four bordars, and they have two ploughs and a half. It is worth and was worth fifteen shillings.\" One of these two Manors mnst, and both may, have been represented by the Manor afterwards known as Albright Hussey. In the 13th century, it contained only two hides, and not four ; for two being ungeldable might easily become obsolete in fiscal records. Cf. Eyton x. 80-1.

From the name, it appears to have originally belonged to the same Saxon settler, Albricht or Eadbert, who also possessed the Abrightons ; as those, or one of thera, was his Um or fenced dwelling, so this was his lea, or pasture for his cattle. Before the Norman conquest, however, it had become the property of the Collegiate Church of St. Alcmund, in Shrewsbury, to which it also belonged at the time of Domesday. It is there written Etbretelie. It is estimated at an hide, but consisted, in fact, of two carucates,1 one of which was in the demesne ; the other occupied by two villans and a bordar. There was also a iewede of wood properly belonging to it ; but Earl Roger had deprived St. Alcmund of that appendage. When the possessions of that church were transferred to the foundation of Lilleshull Abbey, this place was, of course, among the number. In 24 Edw. I., that Abbey is stated to hold Edbright Lee, a member of the Church of St. Alcmund, and it continued down to the time of the dissolution, in the same house, but granted out, from time to time, to a succession of lessees.

Henry II. grants & confirms to the Church of Hagh mon & the Canons regular serving God there, the site of the Abbey (ipsam sedem A bbatis) with all assarts which they have assarted there, also the whole grove which they have by the gift of William Fiz Alan from his Abbey towards Shawburia, by these bounds : viz., \" from ye field of Sundern direct to Blakelake & to ye white sicket towards Witheforde\" ; likewise free com mon of pasture for all the cattle & animals of themselves, their tenants & men of Offinton through all Astleya ; rendering to the Chaplain of the Church of St. Mary of Salop 12d. yearly.

About a century after this settlement of boundaries, this point was again in litigation between the two ecclesiastical bodies.

By the late Rev. JOHN BRICKDALE BLAKEWAY, M.A. ACTON REYNOLD, Anciently Acton Grinsill and Acton Reyner, in the Liberties of Shrewsbury, though a township of the Parish of Shawbury, in the Hundred of North Bradford. This manor was held in the Saxon times by Seward, a free man, and one ofthe largest landed proprietors of Shropshire in that period. At the time of Domesday it was holden under the earl, by his sheriff Rainold, who had underlet it to one Richard. It was rated to the Danegeld at three hides, but the land consisted of five carucates.1 Two soldiers held one carucate,1 but whether this was a sixth, or one of the other five, does not appear. There was wood enough to fatten thirty hogs. In the reign of the Confessor the manor had been valued at \u00a34, but in the survey of Domesday it had fallen as low as 10s. The family of Fitz Alan succeeded to all the property of Rainold ; and in the Liber Niger, 1167, among the vassals of William fitz Alan, Reiner Brelecton holds the fee of half a muntator. As this was of \" the old feoff ment,\" which refers to the reign of Henry I., I conjec ture this tenant to be the descendant of the Ricardus of Domesday, and himself ancestor of the line who gave their name to the place.2 1 [Caruca (team), not carucata, (carucate.) \u2014 Ed ] 2 Blakeway is in error here. Richard of Domesday, whose real name was Richard fitz Halufri, was probably ancestor of the Stantons, who were Seigneural Lords of Stanton-upon-Hineheath aud Acton Reynald till the extinction of their male line in the reign of Edward I. The Actons, who took their name from the place, held under the Stantons. Cf. Eyton ix. 293, x. 61. \u2014 Ed.]"], [48, "38 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. The practice of giving a declinable form to^the names of places in conveyances of land, did not, I think, con tinue later than towards the close of the twelfth century. Hence I suppose the grantor in the following deeds1 to be son ofthe Reyner just mentioned. Robert, son of Reiner de Actona, grants _ to the church of Haghmon, common pasture in all his heath ground (brueriam) of Acton for 300 sheep of the great hundred2 (per Majorem centanariam), and for all their cattle (averia) of Herdewik, except in his wood of Acte, and in his corn grounds (segetibus) and meadows before the hay is carried off ; and if by chance their cattle shall get into his said wood, (per escapturam intra verint, this word is not in the glossaries,) they shall be let out without impounding or forfeiture, Witnessed by Robert Gyros, Vivian de Rosale, Thomas his son, Will de Staunton, Ralph de Sanforde, William Banestre, Walter Huse, and Wido de Heddenhale.

The same Robert grants to the same canons pasture of Acton for 500 sheep, and for all their other cattle of of Grileshill, through his whole fee of Acton, except corn grounds and meadows, at a rent of 12d., to his heirs after his death ; if the said rent be unpaid within the octave of St. Michael, it shall not be doubled, but in that case the grantor or his heirs shall be at liberty to assart at their pleasure in the wood or bruery with out any disturbance from the convent. Nevertheless, as soon as the corn or hay are off the ground, the herbage shall be common to all the other cattle of Grinsill there, and wheresoever his own cattle feed, saving to himself and his heirs possession of his grove until Martinmas.

Robert de Actona grants to Haghmon Abbey pas ture for 500 sheep, and for all their cattle of Grineleshull, through his whole fee of Acton, except corn and meadows, in consideration of a corredy (so it is written) of one canon, \"tam in pane quam in cervisia et in generali,\" for his life : after which the same corredy shall remain quit to the canons without any claim of his heirs, to whom the religious shall pay 12d. rent.

This chapel, or rather a chantry therein, and the said virgate, with the tithes of another virgate in the same Acton, had become the subject of a dispute between that knight on the one hand, and the religious of Haghmon rectors of Shawbury, and the Vicar of that church on the other, which was at length adjusted by a deed (in modum cirographi divisa) in the Haghmon Chartulary dated at that Abbey on ye 2nd of June in the year of grace 1288, the 16th of K. Edward son of K. Henry, wherebv Reyner \" acknowledges & grants to the said chapel of Acton to have been & to be a chapel of the mother church of Shawbury, subject and dependent thereunto, & himself & all the dwellers in Acton to have been & to be parishioners of the said mother church, & that they have paid & owe to pay all manner of tithes thereunto ; he also acknowledges & confirms the grant made by his ancestors of the said virgate to the said church, with the said chapel ; saving to the said Reyner and his heirs, & to the said chapel, the ancient service accustomed & due from the said mother church and its rectors and vicars, \u2014 viz : the service of one chaplain celebrating divine service in the chapel, three days in every week, viz. : Sundays, Wednes days, & Fridays, which service the said convent & vicar covenant to sustain & perform after the death of the said Reyner. \u2014 Cartul.

Since in the feodarium of the hundred of Pimhill, 28 Edw.

Staunton was a fee of Fitz Alan, & Oswestry was one of his castles ; & the whole entry strongly corroborates the identity of this with the Reyner Brelecton of the Liber Nitjer. I see no more of the Actons. The next authority, the Nomina Villarum, 9 Edw. II. 1316, gives William de Cocalance lord of Acton Reyner Grenchull : an error of the clerk, I presume for Ercalewe, the name of an ancient and opulent family seated at High Ercall, and lords of Staunton, and other places under the Fitz Alans ; but I am unable to say how they became possessed of this manor, or when they ceased to enjoy it. I have stated under Grinsill some reason for supposing that the family of Burnell were its lords at one time.2 It is certain that Francis, Viscount Lovel, the heir general of that family, was owner of the manor, as upon his forfeiture 1 Hen. VII. it was granted to . . . Dudley. John Dudley and John Aiscoughe had diverse lands here in 17 Eliz., but in the 31st of that queen the manor was granted to Coppinger and Butler. In 1637, Sir Andrew Corbet, knight, died, seised of the manor of Acton Reyner, otherwise Acton Reynolde, and the manor of Grinshall, otherwise Grinshull, both holden of the king in socage as of the manor of East Greenwich. As I cannot find that this manor appears in the inquisitions after the deaths of any of his ances tors, I presume that it was purchased by him, and that, despairing of being able to complete the noble edifice commenced at Morton Corbet by his uncle, he determined to seat himself here, in a situation every way more eligible, on an healthy eminence, commanding 1 Montarius. See the note on Muntator in the Liber Niger. 2 [In 1292, Reyner de Acton alienated the manor of Acton Reyner and a fourth part of the manor of Grineleshull, after his decease, which occurred before 1308, to Philip Burnell. These estates went with Petronilla, sister of Philip Burnell, to William de Ercall ; and their son, William de Ercalewe, stands in the Nomina Villarum of 1316 as Lord of the Vill of Acton Reyner and Grinehull.

His wife, too, Elizabeth Boothby, was a pattern of piety and orthodoxy in the worst of times. In the interesting narrative preserved by Walker, in his Sufferings of the Clergy, of the persecutions endured by Mr Orpe on account of his loyalty, we read that a good lady, the relict of Sir Andrew Corbet, presented him to the vicarage of Staunton, from which, however, he was soon removed by the Puritan Committee for not being a soul-saving minister, nor belonging to the election of grace. The house erected at Acton Reynold by Sir Andrew was well befitting his rank. A stately edifice of Grin sill stone, with lofty gables and transome windows. It has lately been extended and greatly improved, with due attention to its original style, by his descendant, the present baronet.

Nor must the cellars be omitted. These were fitted up with fire places, and were ten feet in height, so that when upon the late reparation, the apartments on the ground floor were found not sufficiently lofty for modern ideas, they were heightened, without stirring the upper floor, by lowering the ground floor into the cellars. The reason of this is founded on the practice then very common, of adjourning to those subterraneous apart- ments for the purposes of conviviality. It is related of the facetious Bishop Corbet, whose love of humour, it must be owned, sometimes outstepped our conception of episcopal decorum, that he would sometimes take the key of the wine-cellar, and he and his chaplains would go and lock themselves in, and be merry ; then first he layes down his episcopal hood, \" there layes the doctor :\" then he putts off his gowne, \"there layes the bishop :\" then 'twas \"here's to thee, Corbet, here's to thee, Lushington.\"1 Half a century later, in the reign of Charles II., Roger North, describing the Duke of Beaufort's housekeeping at Badminton, which he con sidered as showing a princely way of living, above any other, except crowned heads, in Europe, says, they did not sit at a table after dinner, with tobacco and healths, as the usage is, but if the gentlemen chose a glass of wine, the civil offers were made to go down into the vaults,2 which were very large and sumptuous, and a remnant of this custom was preserved, as I remember, at Chirk Castle, till that great family was broken up by the death of the male heir. Ludlow, relating the manner in which Sir Phelim O'Neal surprised Lord Cawfield, says he came to him under the pretence of friendship, with about half a 1 Aubrey MS. in MSS. Ashmole. I am far from giving credit to all which that latter relates, but his story at least proves the custom, which unless the cellars were furnished with grates and chimnies as at Acton Reynold, was no very comfortable one. ?

The Manor of Acton Reynold and the other great estates of that family descended ultimately to Corbet Kynaston, Esq., who devised them to his kinsman, Andrew Corbet, Esq., of Abryght Hussey ; but as Mr. Kynaston died greatly in debt (to the amount of upwards of \u00a370,000) many of the estates were obliged to be sold. This was among the number. The Act empowering it was passed 21 George II. I believe it was bought by Mr. Mytton.1 1 [Blakeway seems to be in error here. Mr. Mytton did not purchase Acton Reynald. The origin of the tale probably is, that General Mytton, who commanded under Cromwell, took and burned Moreton Corbet Castle. The family were fined a large sum for being Royalists, and- a farm near Acton Reynald, and one the other side the river Roden, were sold to pay the fine. The first-mentioned farm was afterwards re-purchased from the Wingfields of Onslow. The family estates really came to Richard Corbet, esq., of Shawbury, in 1688, on the death of his great-nephew, Sir Vincent Corbet, 3rd Bart. of the first creation. This Baronetcy expired in 1688. Richard Corbet, of Shawbury, and afterwards of Moreton Corbet, died in 1690. He was lineal ancestor of Sir Andrew Corbet, of Moreton Corbet, created a Baronet in 1808, who was grandfather of Sir Vincent Rowland Corbet, 3rd bart., High Sheriff of Shropshire in 1862, the present Lord of the Manor of Acton Reynald.

It was formerly a part of Abright Hussey chapelry, and in the parish of St. Mary, of which the best account we have been able to collect is given in our history of Shrewsbury. At the important engagement which took place here, and from which the parish takes its name, the king's life was at one time in the most imminent danger. Hotspur and Douglas, with a personal animosity which exasperates the horrors of war, directed their attacks against the royal person, and were very near effecting their purpose. Whether it was on the very spot on which he was rescued from peril that Henry chose to erect his college ; whether it was here that the brave Earl of Stafford fell ; or whether there was any other motive to direct his choice, we are not told. As little do we know why so long an interval elapsed before the accomplishment of the king's intention to consecrate the scene of his victory by a religious foundation. This battle which fixed him in the throne befell in the summer of 1403 ; yet it was not till three years after, viz., in the 8th of his reign, that Richard Husse, Esq., obtained the royal license to grant two acres in Ad brighton Huse lying in a field called Haytelefield,1 1 I long thought this was an original error of the clerk who engrossed the license, on which the subsequent proceedings were founded, for Baytelefield. The original Inspeximus by Henry V., 7 June, lm\u00b0 regni, of his father's charter of 11 Henry IV, is now before me, by the kindness of Mr. Moultrie, and the word is distinctly Hateleyfeld * but in an Inspeximus 17 Nov., 4 Henry VI., of which I have also seen the original, it is as plainly \" in campo qui vocat' Bateleyfeld.\" I find however, that the field round the chapel is still called Hateleyfield.

Did the grant proceed from the spontaneous liberality of Mr. Husse, from his zeal for the house of Lancaster, or from his desire of making his court to the sovereign? This we cannot tell, but there is something out of the ordinary course in the whole transaction. In 8 Henry IV., Husse has license to grant the two acres to Ive and his successors, rectors of the chapel of St. John of Adbrighton, to build thereon a chapel of St. Mary Magdalen, of which chapel he and his successors, rectors as aforesaid, shall be masters or wardens, and shall for ever nominate the other five chaplains : which chaplains shall daily celebrate divine offices for the good estate of the king during his life, and after his death for the souls of himself and his progenitors, and for the ancestors of the said Richard Husee and Isolda his wife, and their heirs, and for the souls of those who were slain in that battle and lye buried there1, and for the souls of all faithful deceased. At some subsequent date which is not specified, Ive granted the said two acres to the king, his heirs and assigns, kings of England, for ever ; and Henry, by his charter of March 27, llmo regni (1410), regrants them2 to Ive with the buildings thereon erected, and Inspeximus, the original of which is now before me, it is bateleyfeld. 24 Oct., 8 Elizabeth, Inspeximus by her, at ye request of Richd.

Upon the face of this transaction, it rather looks as if Henry at first wished to give it the air of a tribute of loyal affection to his person and title from one of his zealous subjects; and considering the way in which he came by the crown, it was not unimpor tant for him to give it this appearance. At least I cannot otherwise account for this needlessly circuitous mode of conveyance. Why he found it afterwards expedient to proceed in a more direct course, and become himself the immediate founder, does not appear.

Accordingly, in the Michaelmas term of 1443, Mr. Ive sued the sheriff in the Court of Exchequer, stating his seisin of the churches granted to his college by Henry IV., the king's grandfather, producing a Charter of his father, as well as another of his own, issued in the 19th year of his reign, exempting the society from such payments, and demanding judgment. The court appears to have very strictly examined the charters and bulls under which the college held these impropriations, which were in effect nearly the whole of their substance, and at length gave judgment in favour of the exemption, and the warden took care to have an exemplification of the record, which bears date July 13th 23 Hen. VI. It will be seen, however, in the benevolence roll of 7 Henry VII. in our general history1 that the college was unable to evade that monarch's well disciplined collectors. Having conducted this thorny affair, which depended six years (for it was on a charge in the great roll of 17 Henry VI. that the sheriff's distress was founded) to the eve of a successful conclusion, Mr. Ive proceeded, by testamentary disposition, to settle the affairs of the college over which he had presided so long and with such exemplary fidelity and prudence.

A pax brede of the same. [A Pax is \" a little gilded or painted table,\" to use the words of Jos. Mede, disc. on Luke ii, 13, \" with a crucifix or some saints' picture thereon to be kissed of everyone in the church, before they receive the holy bread.\" A substitute for the kiss anciently given before the eucharist. It is sometimes called an oscillatory.] Two silver crewets (fiolos.) Three bells of brass hanging in the belfrey. [This was not the present bell-tower, which, as we shall see, was not then built.] Two portiphories ad usum Sarum otherwise called Lyggers. [The portiphorium or portiforium is a book of the Romish service, the same (according to Lindewood, as quoted by Burn) which is sometimes called the ordinal, because it was the book which ordered the manner of performing divine service. From an authority cited by Du Cange in v. it was plainly synonymous with the breviary, which received its name, I suppose, from its being a compendium of the usual ministrations. That learned glossarist derives its name of portifory, which the French converted into Portez vous (see Brit. Ont. July, 1802, p. 12.), and analagous to a Vade Mecum, and the English into Portues,1 from its i \" When Esdras . . . purposed to restore the sacrifices of God, he sent not to Rome, although perad venture he had heard that there were Numa Pompilius' manuals or portuesses, containing the service of their Gods.\" Jewel Apol.

Watson's Essay on Oricalchum in the 4th vol. of his Chymical Essays. That it was brass is clear from the old French name for that metal \u2014 archal.] Two new Missals. Two new graduals. [The gradual or grail was the book containing the choral service at High Mass. Burn, from Lindwood.] Three old Missals ; one of them covered with red leather. An old porti phory. A processionel. An executor of the office. A collectuary. Four books of Placebo and Dirige. A psalter. A pair of vestments of red velvet. A cope of red velvet, with two velvet dalmaticas.

[The Manual seems, says Burn, to be the same with the ritual ; and contains all things belonging to the ministration of the Sacraments, also the blessing of fonts, and other things which require blessing, and the whole service used at processions.] He also devises to the chaplains and their successors, a manse now erected, a buttery (promptuarium), and a kitchen in common, with other buildings and ease ments prepared for them ; and the following articles : \u2014 A long dining table, with two benches. Three table cloths. A basin and ewer. Three brass kettles. Two iron spites and rakkes. A cobard (cupboard). A spit with iron wheels and weights to turn and roast meat. Hence the name was extended to compendiums, or catalogues in other branches of knowledge. The Porteous of Nobleness was a Scottish work on armouries in the 16th century. It even became the name of a family ; and the book in the arms of the late venerable Bishop of London is not, as might have been supposed, and as with great propriety it might have been, a bible, but, in allusion to his name, a Porteus or Portifory."], [68, "56 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES.

He also leaves them his two silver-gilt girdles and his dagger or bastard hernes, to buy them a silver gilt chalice for the celebration of divine service. [Harness is armour, defensive furniture of war : a churchman had no use for such, but he might, and we see did, wear a dagger, and this might be called a kind of bastard harness. If this is not the true explanation, I have nothing better to offer.] A gilt Mazer cup (murram), with silver. [I believe the Mazer or drinking cup was so called, because it was made of maslin or mixed metal. Sire Thopas, in chames, drank the swete win, And made eke in a maselin. That it could not have been of the maple (as Somner supposes, because the Dutch name of that tree is maezer), is plain from various passages cited by Du Cange in v. Mazer. A cup of precious mazer, scyphus pretiosi Mazeris, evidently denotes something more valuable than one of the cheapest of woods. How the mazer cups came also to be called murrse, does not appear. The murrhine vases of the ancients were made of some kind of semi-transparent stone, of the onyx or agate kind, and it appears probable that glass cups received the same name in later times, from some affinity they bore to the others. Glass will, as is well known, take a coat of gilding, but whether such was the cup in question, it is impossible to decide. See Cyphus de Mazero in the taxation of Salop, 4 Edward II. Dr. Drake (Eboracum p. 439,) describes a \" mazeur bowl,\" edged about with silver, and lined with silver, given by Archbishop Scrope to the Shoemaker's Company at York.

He orders that the master or warden shall have for his support, and for the repairs of the college, and the other expenses belonging to it, the tithes and profits of the Church of Idesale and Chapel of Dadele (Dawley), the township and grange of Aston, and profits of St. Julian in Shrewsbury. He directs that the alms collected by virtue of the indulgences granted to the College, and the offerings made therein, be applied to the building and work of the bell-tower (campanilis), and after that is finished be given to the poor who for the time being shall be in the college, and for the keeping up and repairing of their alms-house. The Chaplains are to common together at dinner and supper in the college hall with the master, and not in their own chambers, orinothersecretoroutwardplaces, and to pay for their board and chamber four marks each by the year. They are restricted from going out of college by day or night, without the master's special leave, under a pain of 3s 4d for every offence. Each of them is to swear regular obedience to the master at his first entrance (into other collegiate places) : according to the custom in other collegiate places. It appears that ten marks [See Arch\u0153ol. xx. 531] had been originally assigned as the annual stipend of each chaplain, but that by the express order of Mr. Ive, in whom the royal founder seems to have reposed an unlimited confidence of which he was very worthy, no more than eight marks had ever been paid them. He now however, by his will, directs that they shall in future receive their full salary of ten marks, provided that each of them daily say a prayer (Incline, Domine aurem, &c, Incline thine, ear, O Lord, to our prayers, whereby we beseech Thee, that the soul of thy servant Roger Ive, etc.), with a secret and post communion,"], [70, "58 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. and every year solemnize his anniversary at night on the eve of St. Mary Magdalen, with Placebo and Dirige by note, and a mass of Requiem on the morrow by note, with wax lights, tolling of bells, and other dependencies, orisons, and collects, ordained for the exequies of the defunct, praying for the souls of Henry IV. and V., their founders, Richd. Husee, senior, their first patron, and Isolda his wife, John Husee, Richard Husee the father, Richd. Husee now living, and Thos. Husee deceased, and for the souls of me, Roger Ive, and my kinsfolk, and for the souls of Will. Howyk, of Pountfret, and Sir Tho. Kyrkeby, chaplain, deceased, and for the souls of all faithful slain in the field of Bataylfield and there interred. The Chaplains are moreover to say after noon with- out note in the choir, Placebo and Dirige, with suffrages for the deceased aforesaid, except on days when by the ordinal of Sarum they may not be said : and he particu- larly specifies, that the Chaplains shall on this occasion sit in the choir, some on the south side, and some on the north. Every day on which nine lessons are read, they shall say the Mattins of the day in the choir by note. and a Mass of St. Mary by note, and another high Mass of the day by note : also vespers after noon by note : and whenever they say mattins and vespers without note, they shall sit apart on each side of the choir, and not together on one side He also assigns to the Chaplains the appropriation of the chapel of Ford, pro- vided that once a week, and if it may be on the Monday, they say Mass of Requiem, with Placebo and Dirige, and nine lessons by note, lauds and commen- dations without note, for the souls aforesaid, and for this he assigns them 4d. a week each out of Ford and St. Michael of Wyre. In case of their neglect, the same to go to the hospital of the poor.

Deducting four marks (\u00a32 13s. 4d.) for his board and lodging, it leaves him \u00a34 12s. for wearing apparel, and every other incidental charge. Surely this, which no calculation can raise beyond \u00a340 of modern currency, will not be deemed an extravagant remuneration for the unremitted services of a man of education for every day of the year, and almost every hour of the day and night : and whatever we may think ofthe utility of their employment, the members of this establishment did not eat the bread of idleness. If, as there is reason to believe, they devoted their leisure to the study of letters, and the instruction of youth,1 the insatiate and unprincipled ministers of a virtuous young monarch might have respected the poverty of an establishment whose spoils could bring so trifling an addition to their coffers. But nothing was too low for the avarice of Somerset. The dissolution of Edward VI. was the disgrace ofthe Reformation ofthe English Church ; and it is well if it prove not its ruin. Much injury had arisen to the testator and his college in time past, from the forgery of the college seal and from neglect in keeping it, he therefore orders a new one, which he thus describes : In the middle is the image of the Holy Trinity, with the figure of St. Mary Magdalen on the right, and St. John Baptist on the left, at the feet himself on his knees, and this legend in the circumference, s. co'e. d'ni rog'i ive p'mi mag'ri ET SUCC.

This will, evidently the result of much reflexion, was not made when the testator was in extremis, since he appeared personally in the court of Chancery on the first day of February, 1445-6, and acknowledged it as his own : it was therefore by his exertions that the college obtained a charter in the December preceding, granting them exemption from all intervention of the officers of the crown and the exclusive execution of warrants, levying of fines, amercements, &c. within the precinct and territory of the chantry, and the manors of Adbryghton Hussey and the vill of Harlescote, being within the said territory and precinct, and their other manors, lands, and fees. Indeed I apprehend that Mr. Ive continued in office throughout the whole of this reign. I do not find any mention of a successor to him1 before 1461, when Sir Roger Phillippis occurs in the situation of master, and obtained from the new King Edward IV. a brief, enabling him to collect charitable contributions for the aid of his college. He added to the possessions of the college by purchasing two parcels of land, one parcel lying in the venel (or lane) called Kings Way over against before the gates of the college, and the other in the field near the gates of the college ; on each of these pieces of land he built three chambers, six in the whole, which he settled upon the combrethren (so he styles them) and other chaplains in the church of the college, on condition that they shall always celebrate his anniversary on the Saturday after St. Martin in hieme. They are to pay a rent of 8d. yearly for the prenises to Richard Husey, Esq. and his heirs. His deed to the effect above, bears date Oct. 2, 19 Edw. IV., and is witnessed by Richard Hussey, Esq., senior, Richard his son and heir, Thomas Sugdon apostolical and imperial nothary, William Banastur, esq., William 1 [These words, 'from \"Indeed\" to \"him,\" have subsequently been erased.

Mr. Ive resigned the wardenship early in the year 1447, for on the 14th of April Henry Bastard, master in the faculty of arts, was admitted by the diocesan to Adbryghton Huse chapel and this college thereto annexed. He had previously agreed to allow his predecessor an annual pension of \u00a3 1 0 for his life, out of the revenues of the college, and this compact was sanctioned on the day of Mr. Bastard's admission, by Thomas Chesterfield, canon residentiary of Lichfield and bachelor of decrees, who was at that time guardian of the spiritualities of the see of Lichfield. 5 Dec. 24 H. 6. \" Henricus dei gr'a etc' Sciatis quod cum cantaria be.

In 1506, on the accounts of the bailiffs of Salop, is a payment of 4d., being the expenses of Nicholas Waring and Thomas Couppere riding to Withington to discourse with the Abbott of Haghman and the Archdeacon of Salop. This must have been Adam Graston, with whom I suppose the Abbott was upon a visit at his parsonage house of Withington. Mr. Graston must have resigned this mastership long before his death, which did not take place till 1530, since on the last day of March 16 Hen. VIII., and after in 17 Hen.

The college of Battlefield had a peculiar jurisdiction in the probate of wills, and all other things pertaining to ecclesiastical law. I have not discovered when this authority was granted to them, but its existence is undoubted. In 1535, Henry VIII., having conceived the design of dissolving the monasteries and reforming the state of his clergy, appointed Cromwell vicegerent, vicar general, and official principal of his realm1, for tha purpose of a general visitation of all the clergy in virtue of his newly assumed supremacy. It is from this visitation that we learn the fact of the peculiar jurisdiction of Battlefield. For the new vicar general being prevented by other affairs from immediately attending to this visitation, a commission issued from 1 Burnet states that the first act of the king's supremacy was his naming Cromwell vicar general and general visitor to all the Monasteries, and other priviledged places. \"This,\" says he, \"is commonly confounded with his following dignity of Lord Vice-Gerent in ecclesiastical matters : but they were two different places, and held by different commissions. By the one he had no authority over the bishops, nor had he any precedence ; but the other gave him the precedence next the royal family, and clothed him with a compleat delegation of the king's whole power in ecclesiastical affairs. For two years he was only vicar general.\" Hist. Res., Book 3, vol. 1, p. 181. As neither of these commissions are on the enrolls, having been most probably taken from thence in the days of Queen Mary, the bishop is not to be blamed for having omitted the dates of them. But he seems to have supposed that the former of them issued in 1535, and if so, the commission appointing Cromwell vicar general must have issued in 1537, yet we see him bearing that title the year before. As to the dignity of Lord Vice-Gerent, I do not find it. The stat. 31 Hen.

The fact appears to be that this ill-starred politician was first in 1535 constituted vice-gerent, vicar-general, and official principal, etc., as stated in the text, and then about three years after, in 1538 or 1539, King's vice-gerent, etc., for good and due, etc., as stated in the act of parliament just quoted.

As the preamble to this Commission states the grounds on which Henry assumed the title of Head of the Church, which is a matter that has been much misunderstood, I shall subjoin it. ' ' Whereas all j udicial power, authority, and jurisdiction, both ecclesiastical and secular, originally flowed from the Royal power, as from the supreme head and fountain of all magistrates within our realm, \u2014 for this cause, although We, intending to visit the whole clergy, and beginning such a visitation, have inhibited all Arch-bishops, Bishops, Archdeacons, and others enjoying ecclesiastical jurisdic tion in our realm, from attempting to exercise such jurisdiction within thei'- territories respectively, pending our visitation, Yet because, etc.\" In 1546 the college had recovered its peculiar jurisdic tion, for we then find John Hussey the warden consti tuting an official for the exercise of it, within the limits of the royal Chapel of St. Julian. Indeed I am not sure that the warden of Battlefield had any other peculiar jurisdiction than that which resulted from the annexation of that chapel to his college. The authorities I have been able to consult do not enable me to settle this question. It seems, however, little likely that he should have a separate official for St. Julian's, and there is no mention of any jurisdiction out of that parish in the appointment subjoined. Scarcely a twelvemonth after the date of this instru ment, the first parliament of Edward VI. assembled, in which the act for granting collegiate chantries to the king was passed. On this event the possessions of this society were granted out to various individuals. The house and site of the college, all houses, etc., thereto belonging, except a chamber called the curate's lodging, occupied by Edward Shorde curate, were in 3 Edward VI. granted to John Cupper and Richard Trevor in socage.

They probably sold this property to Mr. Hussey, from whose ancestors it originally pro ceeded ; for it has ever since followed the destination of Abright Hussey. The site of the college was included in the sale of 1638 from the Husseys to Mr. Pelham Corbet, and is now the property of John Corbet, Esq., of Sundorn, lord of the manor of Abright Hussey, and who also grants a deputation for the manor of Battlefield. \" Johannes Hussey clericus magister sive custos ecclesie collegiate beate Marie Magdalene necnon regie capelle Juliane sancte ville de Salop de Battlefild delecto nobis in Christo Edwardo Stevens clerico artium professori Salutem in domino sempiternam ad corrigend' puniend' & debit' reformand' crimine fcdefectus quorumcunq' nostrorum utriusque sexus subditorum tam clericorum quam laicorum in et per tot' nostram jurisdic tionem infra limites nostre regie ac capelle S'ce Juliane ville p'd'c'e delinquencium quorum correctio & reformatio ad nos . . . . . dinoscitur pertinere necnon ad cognoscend' & procedend' in omnibus & singulis causis instancionat' tam ex officio meo p'unat' quam ad alicujus partis instanciam etiam defamacionu' testamentarior' probac'o'es fideiq' lesionis & piurii purgac'o'es inducend' & recipiend' necnon testament' quorumcuq' deceden tiu' infra eand' approband' ac ab intestat' decedenciu' bonorum administrac'o'em in forma juris committend' compotq' eorund' bonor' recipiend' ac eorum inventorium admittend' & recipiend' necnon in aliis causis quibuscunq' ad forsan ecclesiasticum & n'ram jurisdic'o'em . . . pertinen' . . .

Though sadly mutilated, when Dugdale saw them in March 1662 \u2014 3, enough was left to show that they were designed to represent the connexions of the family of Hussey, their superior lord, Fitz Alan, of whom the estate was holden, Strange of Knokin, a kinsman of that great house, and the Englefields, Sandfords, Banestres, &c, all allied by consanguinity or neighbourhood with the line of Abright Hussey. We are able to fix the period when these windows were painted to some year between 1434 and 1445, for William Fitz Alan, whose arms, impaled with those of his wife Joan Nevile,1 were seen in one of them, did not succeed to the earldom of Arundel till the first of those years, and Richard Sandford, who was drawn with a surcoat of Lacon, in allusion, I suppose, to his maniage with Maud Banastre, the heiress of Lacon, died in the last of them. The other persons whose names or arms occur, were all living at a period consistent with these dates, Richard Lord Strange, who succeeded his father in 1403, died himself in 1448, as his first wife Constance,2 whose arms I suppose they are, which are empaled with his own, died in 1438. Robert Englefeld succeeded his father in 1 428, and died in 1473 ; and I find Thomas Sandford alive in 1425, and dead in 1470.

Last week, a splendid Monument, to the memory of the late John Corbet, Esq., of Sundorne, was erected in Battlefield Church, near this town, against the east end of the north wall. The basement, which rests on the floor, is after the model of an ancient altar tomb, and is divided into four compartments by small panelled butresses ; within each compartment are two shields, under trefoil headed arches, surmounted by small panels, similarly ornamented ; on these lie the ledger, moulded and charged with roses. From this altar tomb rise five panelled buttresses with mouldings, supporting the canopy, which consists of four pointed ogee arches with trefoil heads, crocketed and crowned with elegant finials, which also terminate under the cornice ; the buttresses run up between these arches, and each finishes under the cornice with a rich crocketed pinnacle placed angularly with the buttresses, the spandrils being filled with narrow trefoil headed panels. On the canopy is a rich moulded cornice with roses, &c. surmounted by elaborately carved strawberry leaves resting on reversed trefoil headed arches pierced through. In the centre of the cornice are the arms of the deceased, \u2014 Or, two ravens in pale proper, impaling those of his two wives, \u2014 Quarterly per fesse indented Or and Gules for Leighton, and Ermine 3 fusils in fesse Sa. for Pigott ; his crest, an elephant proper with a tower on his back. At the angles are small octagonal turrets springing from the step and terminating with a carved cornice and projecting battlements. The ends, from the turrets to the wall of the church, are occupied by small trefoil headed panels, resting on a moulded plinth, and terminating under a cornice"], [85, "Battlefield. 73 carved similar to that in front. The interior represents in miniature the aisle of a cathedral or cloister with its richly groined and ribbed vault, at each division are small archivolts springing from richly carved corbels, and the intersections of the ribs are covered with rich foliated bosses. On the back is the following inscription in a mixture of old English text and Longobardic characters : \u2014 Sacred to tlie memory of JOHN CORBET Esquire of SUNDORNE, who departed this life the 19 day of May 1817, aged 65 years. He was in the twenty first degree of lineal descent from CORBET a nobleman of NORMANDY who accompanied WILLIAM THE FIRST to the conquest of ENGLAND : and received an ample donation of lands & manors in the County of SALOP during the reign of that monarch. In the same vault are deposited the remains of his first wife emma Elizabeth daughter of Sir CHARLTON LEIGHTON Baronet of LOTON who died the 19 day of September 1797. And of their only son JOHN KYNASTON CORBET who died the 23 day of April 1806, aged 15 years. This monument is erected by his second wife ANNE daughter of the Reverend WILLIAM PIGOTT, M.A. Rector of EDG MOND and CHETWYND, as a tribute of gratitude and affection to the best of husbands, the remembrance of whose virtues is deeply engraven on her heart. This magnificent memorial was designed by the Rev. Archdeacon Owen, and most admirably executed by the Messrs. Carline, of this town, in a beautiful fine grained free stone from the Grinshill quarries in this neighbour hood, the warm yet mild tinge of which adds greatly to the harmony and elegance of the work : and whether we consider the design, the execution, or the munificence that raised it, it is alike creditable to the individual, the antiquary, and the artist.

John Dryden Corbet, in the same way as the estates of Abright Hussey and Abrightlee, as narrated at pp. Ill and 117 ante. Mr. Blakeway speaks of the \" Manor of Battlefield \" (see pp. 339, 344) ; but, strictly speaking, there can be no such manor, for every manor is of a date prior to the statute of Quia ernptores, 18 Edward I, cap. 1, a.d. 1290, which put an end to subinfeudation, and \"Battlefield\" as a place did not come into existence until 120 years after that statute. The Battlefield estate really is parcel of the manor of Albright Hussey, aud has gone with it since the year 1638. The coats of arms, which formerly were in the windows of the church, and are referred to at pp. 336-8, (fig .a to fig. m), are tricked in the Ashmole MS. 854, and copied by Blakeway in his MS. History. They are not here engraved, on account of the expense. The old stained glass was taken down about the year 1749, and entrusted to the care of a neighbouring farmer, who suffered his children and servants to destroy and displace it, so that, when it was"], [88, "76 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. to be replaced, a few fragments only could be found, which were then fixed in the east window of the church, without much attempt at arrangement. These fragments contained two crowned heads, a male and a female, a human head in a dish with the point of a scimitar, the chalice and wafer, and some escutcheons of arms with quarterings, also an inscription, \" Orate pro animabus Rogeri hujusce capellani.\" This old glass was, unfortunately, carried away from this church in 1861, and placed in a window in the north aisle of Prees Church ! New glass was inserted in the east window, repre senting scenes in the history of St. Mary Magdalene ; and some old class from France placed in the windows of the new vesti*y. Probably little was done to the church from the time of the dis solution of the college down to about 1749, and it was allowed to fall into a bad state of repair. About this year considerable reparations were effected. The church was newly roofed, though the pitch of the roof was, probably, somewhat lowered ; the buttresses were capped with heads or gurgoyles ; the tower was bound together with iron bars, nuts, and screws ; a new font was made, and a new bell placed in the tower. This work was not permanent ; in a few years' time the roof of the nave fell in, four ugly Doric pillars were introduced into the chancel to support it, and a brick wall built to separate the nave from the chancel. The nave was suffered to fall into decay. In 1861, the church was thoroughly restored, at the cost chiefly of Lady Brinckman, from plans prepared by Mr. S. Pountney Smith. The tower was completely renovated, the disused and ruinous nave repaired, the Doric pillars in the chancel removed, the church was new-roofed, and the whole of the edifice put into a thorough state of repair. The foundations having been sapped by the wet, the whole of the walls and buttresses had to be underbuilt. The broken summit of the nave walls were found to be nearly nine feet below their original height, and covered with grass and shrubs ; and the tower had sunk a foot out of the perpendicular, and had lost its floors, bells, and roof, all of which necessitated a vast amount of labour and expense. A new mortuary chapel for the Corbet family, or vestry, was built on the north side of the chancel. A new hammer-beam roof was placed in the church, the points of the hammer bearing shields of arms of illustrious warriors who fought on the celebrated field of battle. The original area of the churchyard was enclosed, and a lych-gate erected. A Vicarage House was also built on the west side of the church.

BATTLEFIELD CHURCH IN 1792,"], [90, ""], [91, "BERWICK. 77 BERWICK, Berwick is, I conceive, bere wick, the barley village, or hamlet devoted to the cultivation of that species of grain, though Du Cange will have Berwick to mean \"a manor, or rather a member of a manor detached from the body of it, a small village, a hamlet of a manor, a manor pertaining to a greater manor, as if it were berier-vic, Saxon for manerii-vicus.\" But I cannot accede to this etymology. We read in Domesday of as many as seven berewicks, ten, and even twenty bere wicks belonging to one manor, which it is scarcely possible to understand of so many subordinate manors, nor, indeed, do I know how berier can bear the signifi cation here given it. It is much easier to understand them of barley farms, from the Saxon bere, barley, and wick, a village. We have no reason from that ancient survey to believe that the place now before us ever belonged to any other manor. In the Saxon times it was a part of the possessions of the celebrated Edric, nephew of the more celebrated and treacherous Duke of Mercia of the same name, and was then valued at 30s. Our Edric, from his pertina cious resistance to the Norman conquest, which drove him, with his followers, into woods and caves, acquired the appellation of Guilda, the Wild, or Salvage, by which last he is known in Domesday. He is said to have been the ancestor of the family of Weld. When that record was compiled, Berewic, as it is there written, was one of the manors which Earl Roger retained in his own occupation. It was rated to the dane-geld at one hide and a half. But so greatly had the cultivation of it increased since the assessment of that tax, that there were two carucates1 in the demesne, and five more were held by four servants, one female servant, and eleven villans, and the whole was then valued at nine pounds. 1 [Not carucates, but teams. \u2014 Ed.]"], [92, "78 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. Seven carucates are equal to 940 acres. The town ship of Berwick, including Almond Park, now contains upwards of 1,260 acres. By the forfeiture of the third Norman earl of this county, Berwick, with his other estates, became, of course, the property of the crown ; and I conceive that Henry I. granted it to one Ranulf de Broc,1 for he appears in the Liber Niger, which was compiled in 1167, as one ofthe land holders of old feoffment (i.e., of lands whereof the party or his ancestor was enfeoffed in the reign of Henry I.) He held under William Fitz Alan. Ranulph married one Damietta or Dunetta de Gorurn, an heiress, and had issue three daughters, Adelina (written also Edelina, Odelina, and Godelina), Sibilla, and Clementia or Clementina. The eldest of these ladies married Stephen de Turnham,2 Seneschall of Anjou in 33 Hen. II. , 1186, and sheriff of Wiltshire in the 9th and 10th of Rich. I., to whom and his wife by the name of his faithful (fideli viro) Ste. de Thorn ham and Adelina his wife, King John in the sixth year of his reign, 1204, commands the sheriff ot Salop to deliver without delay full seisin of the manors of Chedington, Euden, and Berewic (Rot. Claus. 6 John m. 19, ap. Dodsw. vol. 103), and I rather suppose 1 [Ranulf de Broc, son of Oyn Porcell, was Usher and Marescall to Henry II, with whom he stood in high favour. He farmed the vacant see of Canterbury during the exile of Abp. Becket, against whom he took a strong part. He probably died about 1187. \u2014 Cf. Eytonl., 166-171. Ed.] 2 Stephen de Turnham was son of Robert de Turnham, founder of the priory of Cumbwell in Kent, temp. Henry II, and brother of Robert de Turnham, a great favourite of Richard I. Stephen was himself Seneschal of Anjou in 33 Henry IL, Sheriff of Wilts 9 Rich. I., and of Lincolnshire 1 John. He was dead 16 John, without male issue by Ediline his wife, who, in right of her mother Damietta, was lady of the manor of Feallebury, co. Hants. (Dugd. Baron.) But Roger de Leyburne married one of his daughters. Qu. \u2014 Did the Leiburnes get Berwick in that way ?

Claus. 6 J oh. m. 19, in Dugd. MSS. v. 2). But Ranulf, her father, must have been dead as long ago as the 2nd of Richard I., 1190, for in that year the sheriff of Salop on the Pipe Rolls renders an account of three marks which Sibilla de Brocton (as she is there called) gave for licence to marry herself, \u2014 pro licentia maritandi se, \u2014 so minute were the exactions of our ancient monarchs, and so petty, oftentimes, the produce of this vexatious branch of the prerogative. Stephen was probably a brother of that Robert de Turnham recorded as being so instrumental in securing the throne for John, on the death of his brother Richard, by putting him into possession of the town of Saumur and the Castle of Chinon, in which was deposited the treasure of the deceased monarch. He (Stephen) is enumerated among the ancient barons by tenure, in Dugdale's Baronage, and he was evidently a person of distinction, both from the terms and from the effect of the writs quoted above, for in them no notice is taken of the joint claim of his sisters-in-law to the inheiitance of their parents, but he appears to have usurped the whole to himself. One of these sisters, however, did not aquiesce in the injustice. Sibilla sued her brother in-law and brought him to terms ; for in Michaelmas term, 9 John, Edeline, the wife of Stephen de Thurnham, confirmed the agreement which her lord made with her sister (concordiam quam dominus suus fecit cum sorore 1 [Damietta was daughter of William de Goram, an migrant from Maine, in the time of Henry I, by whose gift he had Chetton and Berwick.

But this settlement was, no doubt, sufficiently favourable to Turnham, since upon his death, which happened in or before the 16th of John,1 when his widow, Edeline, gave 60 marks and a palfrey to marry as she pleased, Sibil endeavoured to set it aside ; for among the pleas of land at Westminster, Michaelmas 3 and 4 Hen.

Sibil makes default. (Dodsworth, vol. 42.) Sibilla lived to a great age, and died possessed of the manor of Chetton,2 which was, I presume, secured to her by the fine above mentioned.

Matthew Paris (sub ann.), who writes the name Lemburne, informs us that this mishap befel at Walden. He says that none of the knights present bewailed the loss of the deceased so much as the author of his death, who immediately assumed the cross of pilgrimage for the repose of his soul, (qui confestim, pro liberatione anim\u00e6 ejus, cruce se signavit peregrinaturus) , a design which does not seem to have been carried into effect. The historian would have his readers believe that Leiburne was in fact actuated by revenge for a broken leg, which the other had occasioned him in a former rencontre. But the monk of St. Albans, though a most valuable writer, was a warm partizan of the rebellious Earl of Leicester ; and our Roger is enumerated by him among the knights of Shropshire, who in 1255 took up arms in behalf of his sovereign. This offence was aggravated in the mind of the historian by the recollection of Leybourne's former adherence to the opposite party, which he, with others, had deserted, \" being seduced by bribes, \u2014 muneribus exc\u00e6cati \" (id. p. 992, sub. ann. 1263), or, as it had been fairer to have said, from a conviction, however tardy, of the treasonable views of that factious nobleman. Roger de Leybourne1 died in 1272 ; having married secondly Eleanor, daughter of William de Ferrars, Earl of Derby, and relict of William de Vaux and of Roger de Quienci, Earl of Winton ; but by this lady he appears to have had no issue. The next possessor of Berwick was Simon de Ley bourne, of whom presently, and whom I take to have been the eldest son of Roger by Eleanor Turnham. 1 [This Roger de Leyburn (II.) had a grant, 26 Oct, 1265, of the lands of John le Despencer and others, which seems to have worked to him an immediate reversion of the fee-simple of Berwick, previously conveyed by him to Geoffrey Despencer in 1245. Cf. Eyton, x, 219. See the Pedigree of Gorran, Turnham, and Leybourn, given in Eyton x. 220-1.\u2014 Ed.]"], [98, "84 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. But William,1 who is stated in the Baronages to have succeeded his father Roger in his estates, and who had summons to Parliament as a baron of the realm from 1298 to his death in 1309, must have been the offspring of another marriage, since upon the death of his grand daughter, Julian de Leybourne, Countess of Hunting don and Lady of Ahergavenny (called from her great estates, the infanta of Kent) in 1366, her lands escheated to the Crown for want of an heir, which they could not have done if Simon and William had been brothers of the whole blood. The Feodary of the Hundred of Pemeul in the 7th of Edward I. states that Simund de Leyburne held the manor of Berwyke of the king in capite, by one of those singular services which appear to have formed one the rude amusements of our ancient sovereigns, and which in the present instance was perhaps devised by Henry I. when he granted the manor to Ranulf de Broc. Simon then held it by the service of one man riding with a greyhound, and one man carrying a gammon of bacon (i.e., a ham), when the King passes into Wales in time of war, who shall follow the King until that gammon be expended ; and if he continue longer with the King, it shall be upon the King's cost. It should seem that the whole of the land held by Earl Roger had not been granted to Broc, for the jury find only one hide of land. \" Also the said Symon hath there two carucates of land\" (i.e., of arable land) \" worth \u00a34 yearly ; also the meadows of the Lord are worth 20s yearly. He hath also there a wood of 6 acres, worth 4s yearly, and two pools worth one mark.\" 1 William de Leyburne is stated to have free warren at Berewicke, in the Iter of Hen. III. (Hotchkiss MSS, vol. 3). A person of these names is called the King's sea admiral (admirallus maris Regis) in a convention at Bruges, 1286. Spelman Glossar. The same, no doubt, whom Edw. I., after the conquest of Wales, made constable of Crickeath Castle. [Eyton states that William was heir of Roger de Leyburn (IL), being his son by a former marriage, and takes Simon to be a younger brother of this Roger. Cf. Eyton x. 219.\u2014 Ed.]"], [99, "BERWICK. 85 Madoc de Berewyke holds half a virgate ol land in villenage ; Roger Russell, the widow Alice, the widow Agnes, John Russell, Gilford clerk, and Thomas Berenard are mentioned as tenants of Symon; the pleas and perquisites of all the manor are estimated at 20*. In upper Berewike, Stephen baker of Salop, ye widow Alice, Rich, de Preston, Galfrid de Berewyke, Rich. Travnell, and several others, are mentioned as holding under Simon. InNeuton, Rich, de Hennecote and others hold under him. In Aldemare, Rich. Tranell, John de Aldemare, and Madin de Aldemar hold of ye said Simon. The jury find that Philip de Broc, a former holder of ye manor of Berewyke of ye King in chief, was the giver of the church of Berewyke, and gave it to the abbot of Lylleshull, in proprios usus, which abbot now holds it. Notwithstanding this finding of the jury, the Char tulary of the Abbey itself, as quoted by Dodsworth in one of his MSS. (vol. 109), states that Edeline, relict of Sir Stephen de Turneham, granted the church of Chetinton and chapel of Berewick, together with all her right in Haremore to that monastery ; nor do I find in any other record mention ofa Philip de Broc, which I therefore conceive to be a mistake of the jurors, who were probably no great antiquaries, for Ranulf. His daughter Edeline may, as usual, have confirmed his donation. Further information on this head would doubtless be derived from the Chartulary itself, if that valuable MS. were now accessible. Simon is stated in the Feodary of the Hundred of Pymhill, in the 28th of Edw. I., to hold the said manor with its members of the king by the same service ; and if he was, as I suppose, father of John de Leyburne, whom I find possessed of this manor in the 9th year of the following reign, when the record called Nomina Villarum was compiled, and when Berwick was still included within the hundred of Pimhill, he must have"], [100, "86 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. married Lucy,1 the sister and heir of John le Strange ol Cheswardine ; for, upon the death of this John le Strange, in the 4th of Edw. III., John le Leyburnewas found to be his nephew and heir, viz , son of his sister Lucy, and thirty years of age. John de Leybourne of Berwick was born therefore in the year 1300, and according to the usages of that period was early trained to deeds of arms. But in those sportive images of war, which were designed for the education of the young nobility, he was as unhappy as his ancestor had been, for in the eighteenth year of his age, he unfortunately slew in a tournament at Worcester John de Mortimer, second son of Edmund de Mortimer of Wigmore, a youth of his own age, whom he pierced in the belly, not being able, for want of strength, says the old chronicle ( Monasticon, ait. Wigmore) proper ly to direct his lance. So fatal, not unfrequently, was the result of this boisterous species of amusement in hands not accustomed to wield the weapons of death ! At how early a period of their lives the great were invested with the habiliments of war, appears from an inventory of cer tain armoury belonging to Henry VI. ( Arch\u0153ologia, vol. 16, p. 124) from which we learn that the king had \"lityll cote armurs \" made for him when he was but seven years of age, and that before he was fifteen the Earl of Warwick, his governor, \" the father of courtesy\" as he was styled, caused to be made for his royal pupil \" a lytyl harneys, [a complete suit of armour,] garnysshed with gold, or that he went over the see,\" i.e., when, upon the death of the Duke of Bedford, regent of France, he was appointed lieutenant-general of that kingdom, May 19, 1436. John de Leyburn appears among the knights of Shropshire returned into Chancery by Henry de Bis shebury the sheriff in 17 Edw. II. (Cotton Claud., c. 11). 1 Sir Roger le Strange, who seems to have been lord of Cheswar dine about the 25th of Hen. Ill, is stated to have left an only daughter Isabel, wife of Simon de Leybourne."], [101, "BERWICK. 87 He appears on the rolls of Gascony in the following year, and on those of Scotland in the 9th1 year of the next reign, when he, together with John le Strange of Whitchurch, obtain the king's license to absent them selves from the wars of that kingdom \" for various causes. ' ' Two years later he received summons to parliament among the barons of the realm, and continued to do so to the time of his death ; and it is in this capacity, I apprehend, that he is called a banneret of the county of Salop in the rolls of France, 19 Edw. III. For the learned Selden teaches us that this title was not con fined to knights created in the field, and in the presence of the king under his royal standard displayed, but was also given to some temporal barons, as a name synony mous thereunto. (Tit. Hon., Pt. II, ch. 5, sec. 25.) Though this assertion of the great antiquary is some what too broadly laid down, for there was manifestly some slight difference (what the distinction was is not exactly apparent,) between a baron and a banneret. This last title, and that of baronet (in its ancient par liamentary sense) was precisely synonymous ; for the Statute of Richard II. quoted by Selden, which in the old translation has baronet, has on the roll banneret. In the 12th of Edw. III., John de Leybourn was assigned, together with Ralph de Stafford and John le Strange, to provide the king's wool in Shropshire and Staffordshire, and send them to the ports. (Rotul. Alemann. istius anni, p. 2, m. 8.) This refers to a common mode of supply to the crown 1 In the 7th of Edw. Ill, he had a charter of free warren in his demesne lands of Caux, Withim (i.e., Worthen), Yokethull, Minsterley, Shelve, Wentmore, Bynweston (these must have been the dower of his wife, Lady Corbet), Aldermare, Berwyke, and Child's Ercalwe, Co. Salop, Angreham, Co. Northumberland, and Silfreton, Hurbreton, Brixham, and Marton, Co. Devon, which last mentioned places must have been the inheritance of his said wife."], [102, "88 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. in those days, and I think then first introduced, whereby parliament granted, sometimes the half, sometimes the whole, of all the wool in the kingdom, which was exported to the low countries, and there sold for the king's benefit : a curious picture of the agriculture and commerce of those days. He died in the 22nd of Edw. III., 1348, leaving no issue by his wife Beatrice, daughter,1 as I conceive, of Sir John de Beauchamp, of Hache, co. Somerset, and relict of Peter Corbet, baron of Caus,2 on whose right heirs, says Dugdale, he settled the ultimate reversion of his estates, a proof, as it should seem, that he had no heirs of his own. 1 She is called daughter of Beauchamp of Silverton, Co. Devon. Silverton was the seat of Sir Humphrey Beauchamp, a younger son of Robert Beauchamp of Hache, but, I suppose, reverted to the Hache family by failure of his issue. Peter Corbet, Knt, the first husband of Beatrice, died seised of Silpherton 15 Edw. II. conjointly with his wife. Inq. p. m. 2 There is some difficulty about this. Beatrice, the wife of Peter Corbet, is called iu the pedigrees daughter'of Edmund Fitz Alan, Earl of Arundel. She was certainly sister to Eleanor, the wife of the fifth Fulke Fitz Warin, of Whittington, for in an abstract of the Fitz Warin evidences (Sloane MSS., 1301) is an extract from her will, in which she is written Elanor garyn, and leaves a legacy to \" hir sister Beautrys Corbett, lady of Caux.\" Eleanor, likewise, is called a daughter of Edmund Fitz Alan in the pedigrees. Nevertheless, by other authorities, Beatrice Corbet is called daughter of John de Beauchamp, of Hache, in Somersetshire, and in a pedigree by Henry St. George, Eleanor Fitz Warin is called daughter of William Beau champ, of Somersetshire, by Cicely, coheir of William, Earl Marescall. So that here is authority for making both these ladies Beauchamps, though there is still some diversity in the Christian name of their father. It is certain that John de Beauchamp, of Somersetshire, married Cicely, daughter of Maud de Kyme, daughter of Sibil, Countess of Derby, sister and coheir of William, Richard, &c, Earls of Pembroke and Earls of Marescall. I find John de Beauchamp iu the above-named MS. granting the constableship of Whittington Castle in 3 Edw. II. , which supports the notion of a connection between the families; and notice of the will of Sir John Leyborn, Knt, to which Thomas of Leyborn, Thomas of Aren, &c, were executors, which could have hardly been found among the Fitz Warin deeds, if Leyborn and Fitz Warin had not been connected by marriage."], [103, "BERWICK. 89 On her death, John de Beauchamp of Somersetshire was found to be her heir, and he died without issue in 1361. In 1369 the manor of Berwick was holden in capite by Roger de Trumpington, of Moger hanger, in the parish of Blunham, co. Bedford. I have not been able to find how he became possessed of Berwick. It is not impossible, however, that he might be of kin to, and the devisee of, Lady Leyburne, for we have seen that she was maternally descended from the family of Pembroke-Marescall, and Blonham, in which parish the residence of Trumpington was situated, had been the property of her relatives, the Valences, Earls of Pembroke. In 1390, John Malyns, of Blonham, senior, is styled lord of the manor of Aldmere and Berwick, and conveyed it to Roger de Trtimpynton,1 son of Sir Roger. Malyns was probably only a feoffee. Trump ington, to whom he conveyed this manor, was himself a knight, for in the escheats of 3 Hen. V , he is found, by the name of Roger Trumpeton Chivaler, to have holden jointly with Margaret his wife, on the day that he died, the Manor of Aldemere, to them and the heirs of the said Roger, of the king in chief, by the service of one knight's fee, and that Walter was his son and heir. (MS. Dodson). Lady Trumpington continued in pos session thirty-eight years, and by the escheats of 32 Hen. VI. was found to have died seised of the manor of Aldmere for term of her life, the reversion thereof belonging to Walter Trumpington, son and heir of the said Roger her husband, and his (Walter's) heirs (MS. Mus. Brit. 4702). He occurs four years later, 1457, by the name of Sir Walter Trumpington, Knight, lord of the Manor of Berwick, when he obtained a license to sell it to Matilda, relict of John Endirby, Esq. 1 Mogerhauger, in the Parish of Blunham, was held by Roger de Trumpington as early as 8 Edw, I, and by Edmund de Trompington as early as 8 Edw.

About 1214, Eodelina, widow of Stephen de Turnham, gave it to Lilies hall Abbey. This grant was not opposed by the Dean and Chapter of St. Mary's ; but was confirmed by a Papal Bull, probably of Honorius II. (1216-1227), and in 1226 was again granted to the Abbey by Roger de Leburne. A rent-roll of Lilleshall Abbey gives 6s. 8d. as the annual profits of Berwick. In the Valor of 1535 it is classed with St. Alkmund's, both churches being set down as together worth _\u00a36. Great and Little Berwick have always been within the parish of St. Mary, Shrewsbury. (See Eyton, x., 223-4.) The present chapel is of 17th century construction. It was con secrated in 1680 by the Bishop of St. Asaph, tbe Bishop of Lichfield being at that time under suspension. On the wall in the vestry, which was formerly the south porch, is the date 1680. An inscription over the entrance-gate of the almshouses states that : \u2014 These Almshouses and Chappel were Given, and Endow'd by Sr Samuel Jones, Knight Anno Domini 1672. A tablet on the north wall of the Chapel has this inscription : \u2014 This Chapel was rapaired and ornamented by Thos Powys, Esqr. 1735. The Organ was given by the Rt. Honble. William Basil Earl of Denbigh 1819. In the windows of the chapel are these coats of arms : \u2014 Royal Arms \" G R. III.\" Powys and four quarterings. Powys impaling Baldwin 1728.

In the chapel-yard is a tablet, against the wall, to \"William Molton, an honest and good man, died April y8 8th 1803, in the 100th year of his age.\" The chapel consists of nave, chancel, and tower with one bell. The east window is blocked up. At the east end of the chancel is a large wooden reredos, ornamented with cherubs, ifcc, and over it is a mural painting. No separate Parish Registers are kept ; all entries of baptisms, <fcc, are annually sent to be entered in the Registers of St. Mary's, Shrewsbury. The Almshouses owe their origin to the liberality of Sir Samuel Jones, Knt., who by his Will,1 dated 25 Dec., 1672, and proved P.C.C., directed that a building of brick, containing 16 rooms, should be erected on his land, near the chapel in Little Berwick, to cost \u00a31,000 at least, and he bequeathed \u00a3300 to be bestowed in repairing the said chapel in Little Berwick ; and he gave towards repairing the chapel and almshouses \u00a320 yearly ; for the maintenance of a minister to preach and pray every Sabbath day \u00a340 yearly ; and for the maintenance of the almspeople \u00a380 yearly, out of which sum \u00a324 yearly should be laid out in buying 16 gowns, 30s. for each gown, such gowns to be given to the almspeople every Michaelmas Day, and \u00a356 should be paid to the 16 almspeople, \u00a33 10s. each, by quarterly payments. And he directed that the minister and almspeople should be chosen by Thomas Jones, serjeant-at-law, and Philip Prince, Esq., and their heirs, and the owners for the time being of Little Berwick ; such of his own kindred who should be willing to be almspeople to be elected before any others, and the rest of the 16 almspeople to be chosen out of the inhabitants of St. Mary's, Shrewsbury ; and in case of the default of the electors, the Mayor of Shrewsbury to elect. And he charged all his lands in Great and Little Berwick with the respective sums of \u00a320, \u00a340, aad \u00a380 About 1709, a Suit was commenced in Chancery against Richard Hosier (who, had purchased the estate in 1699) for non-payment of the annuity of \u00a320 bequeathed for the repairs of the chapel and almshouses; and by an Order made 7 Nov., 1709, it was directed that the \u00a320 per annum for repairing the premises should be fully answered for the fnture, and the arrears (which the Master, by his Report dated 25 Nov., 1714, certified amounted to \u00a3670) paid; and any money saved out of the gowns might be given to the almspeople 1 [See the Charity Commissioners' xxiv.

In 1805, the almshouses were put in a complete state of repair by Mrs. Powys, at the cost of \u00a3209 18s. Besides the 16 almshouses, there is another small house, for the use of the chaplain, called the \" Priest's House.\" Dr. Butler held this himself, and used to study there. Some of the chaplains have occasionally occupied it. In 1760, a Petition for an Account of the annual payment of \u00a320, and the arrears thereof, seems to have been filed by the Earl and Alicia Countess of Tankerville, Sir Francis Vincent, Bart, and Lady Arabella his wife, Edward Daniel, Esq. and Henrietta his wife, James Odonald Esq. and Frances his wife, and Anne Astley spinster (the heirs at law of Philip Prince), aud John Griffiths of Cevenamwlch, co. Carnarvon (the heir of Sir Thomas Jones), an infant under the age of 21 by Watkin Winn his guardian, and John Tombes Wingfield, Clerk, Minister of Little Berwick chapel, against Thomas Powys, Esq., the owner of the estate, in Chancery. The Earl of Tankerville, Mr. Wynne, and James Watson, Esq., are now the representatives of the three original Trustees, and as such are patrons of the chapel and almshouses. Little Berwick was a Perpetual Curacy without cure of souls ; but in 1852 a district with cure of souls was assigned, and published in the Gazette. It position at the present time is doubtful. Until Mr. Burbury's appointment, the chaplains were always admitted to the office by the Ordinary of St. Mary's; but since 1846, when the Bishop of Lichfield obtained concurrent jurisdiction, they have been licensed by him. The late Rev. W. A. Leighton speaks of \"the small but picturesque Chapel, erected in 1672, on the site of an ancient ruinous structure.\" (Guide through Shrewsbury, p. 58). Berwick is in the parish of St. Mary's, Shrewsbury, and consists of the townships of Great Berwick and Little Berwick, and the hamlets of Almond Park, Newton, and Rose Hill. The house at Great Berwick, formerly the mansion of the Bettons, but sold by them to the owners of the Little Berwick estate, is usually considered to stand on the site of the house where Hotspur slept on the eve of the Battle of Shrewsbury. (See Fletcher's Battlefield Church, p. 4.) Edward VI., in 1553, granted (inter alia) the tithes of Almon Park, lately belonging to the dissolved College of St. Mary in Shrewsbury, to the bailiffs and burgesses, for the support of the Free School. In 1830, nothing was received in respect of the tithes of Almond Park, Berwick, and Newton ; and it seemed doubtful whether the governors could substantiate their title thereto.

It was valued in the Confessor's days at 15s., but at the time of Domesday at 16s. I conceive this description to refer to both the Bettons, as well this before us, as the contiguous manor of the same name in the Parish of Berrington : but I can give no account when Betton Strange became included within the Liberties of Shrewsbury, or when it ceased to be part of the possessions of the see of Lichfield.2 When Henry II. arrived from the Continent to take possession of the English throne, he brought with him in his retinue a nobleman, who is said to have been a son of the Duke of Bretagne, and a kinsman of the young monarch.

That Abbey possessed it temp. Henry I., and the monks gave a life lease of the manor to Richard de Belmeis, who was Bishop of London and Sheriff of Shropshire. Bishop Belmeis died 16 Jan., 1127, and on his death-bed restored Betton to the Abbey, though his nephew and heir, Philip de Belmeis (son of Philip) contested this. Subse quently, about 1 154-60, Ranulf de Belmeis (also nephew of the Bishop, and brother and heir of Philip de Belmeis), surrendered Betton to Shrewsbury Abbey. (See Salop Cartulary, nos. 22, 23, 56, 294 ; Eyton ii. 200-1). In 1220, Roger le Zouche, as nephew of Philip de Belmeis, sued the Abbot of Shrewsbury for Betton ; but, after a five years' suit, was apparently unsuccessful. See Eyton vi. 184-5.

Strangers, or Le Strange,1 Henry II. bestowed solid marks of his bounty in various parts of England, particularly in this county. To John, the eldest son, he gave Nesse and Cheswardine, which he is found to hold in 1167 (liber Niger), and I think it also probable that he received Betton likewise from the grant of his sovereign, but for this last particular I have seen no authority.2 In the 23rd year of Edward I., 1295, it had been long enough possessed by this family to have acquired the distinctive appellation it still retains of Betton Strange. For thus it is written in the book of fees in the Exchequer on the Treasurer s side (Ashmol. MSS., vol. 859). \" Bogo de Knovill & Eleanora uxor ejus 1 Mr. Blomefield thinks they were so called from a place in France of this name, but if this had been the case, they would certainly have been termed De Estrange, aud not L'Estrange : the respective prefixes of de and le accurately marking the distinction between personal and local appellations. The Latin Extraneus, too, evidently refers to a person and not a place. Besides, Blomefield himself gives an abstract of a deed, without date, wherein John cognomento Le Strange (so he styles himself) grants land to the monks of Binham for the souls of Henry the younger (i.e., as I conceive, the son of Henry II. ), and Aliauore the queen (wife of Henry II.), and of William, Earl of Arundel, and Queen Adelicia his wife (relict of Henry I.) In this deed the grantor calls himself right heir of Reginald le Brun, who was his wife's brother. Mr. Blomefield makes Guy the eldest son, but \"John Strange, with his 2 brothers Wido and Hamo,\" is the style in the attestation to a deed of Wrilliamfitz Alan, \u2014 \"Johaune Straunge cum duobus fratribus ejus Widone et Hamone,\" which marks, I think, the seniority of John. 2 [About 1160, Hamo le Strange made a grant in the Manor of Betton to Haughmond Abbey. Probably the monks of Shrewsbury had alienated to him that part of Betton, which was thenceforth called Betton Strange ; the part which they retained being called Abbot's Betton. In the 12th and 13th centuries, Abbot's Betton was called Little Betton, to distinguish it from Great-Betton-in-Hales, near Market Drayton, which also belonged to the Abbey. It is now called Great or Abbot's Betton, to distinguish it from Little Betton or Betton Strange. See Eyton vi. 184-5.

She is called in the pedigrees relict of Bogo de Knovill ; but it is manifest that he was her second husband. Betton Strange was then part of her dower, and held by her and her husband ofthe inheritance of John, her eldest son by her first husband. In 17 Edward III., the said John was in possession of it, having then a grant of free warren in his lands of Whitchurch, Corfham, Wroc wardyn, Sutton Baeton, Longnolre, and Cheswarthyn.

Bichetone was part of the ancient possessions of St. Chad in the Saxon times, nor did the Norman Conquest disturb the Church in the enjoyment of this manor. At the time of Domesday it was included within the hundred of Bascherche, and was holden by a person of the name of Wiger, under the church, perhaps the same whose house in Shrewsbury Castle belonged to the Abbey there ; if so, he was a priest. At the time of the imposition of the Danegeld, 2 hides were in tillage ; but in the interval which elapsed between that period and the general survey, a third had been reduced to the purposes of agriculture, for it was then found to consist of 3 carucates,1 one of which was in the demesne and cultivated by 4 villans, and kept, as I conceive, by the Dean of St. Chad's in his own hands, while the other 2 were holden by a free man, whom I apprehend to be the Wiger mentioned above. This, however, is only a conjecture, nor have I been able to ascertain, to my own satisfaction, the degree of dominion exercised by lay possessors in those ages over the church property of which they were the occupants ; since I find many instances, and this is one of them, in which such lay possessor is styled the lord ofa place, of which itis yet certain that the church was all the while in possession of the fee. Most commonly, I believe, these lay tenants continued gradually to accroach to themselves the fee simple of the lands to which they could originally have no greater title than that of lessee. In the Iter of Henry III., it is found that the heirs of William de Bikedone2 held 3 hides in Bikedon in 1 [Not carucates, but ox-teams. \u2014 Ed.] 2 \"William de Bicton was, says Eyton, \"possibly a descendant of Wiger, the Domesday tenant.\" There are notices of him in the years 1174, 1199, 1203, and 1209. Blakeway is in error as to the heirs of William de Bicton ; these were his two daughters, Isabella who became the wife of Thomas son of Richard Gourdin, and Margery. Richard Gourdin probably had the wardship of Isabella, and married her to his own son. William de Bykedon was tenant of Oaks, under Robert de Girros, and this came to his said two daughters and co heirs. Cf. Eyton vi., 167-8 ; x, 164-5.\u2014 Ed.]"], [138, "124 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. the hundred of Pimhill, of the fee of St. Chad. This William was surely the representative, though perhaps hardly the descendant, of the Wiger mentioned above. His heir, referred to in the last Iter, was, I conceive, Thomas de Bykedone,1 who occurs about that period among the provosts, the earliest magistrates of Shrews bury. Thomas, son of William le Seyward was lord of at least a moiety of Bicton in the middle of the 13th century, and he was probably the same person with the last-named Thomas de Bykedon, surnames being in that age little stationary, but the same individual often bearing different ones at several periods of his life. Thomas le Seyward conveyed the moiety above men tioned to Geoffrey Bandolph,2 of Newport, a wealthy burgess, and occasionally provost of Shrewsbury. This conveyance must have taken place previous to 1288, for in that year Bandolph granted to Buildwas Abbey a capital messuage, and fold, and half the lordship of the town of Bykedone, saving to the Dean of St. Chad the service accustomedly due to him for half the town. Whether Seyward held the whole lordship under the church, and therefore still continued lord of one moiety after he had parted with the other, and transmitted it to a son, I cannot say ; but in the Iter of 24 Edward I. (1296) it is written, \" Willielmus, quondam dominus 1 [Thomas son of William de Bikedon was enfeoffed of land at Bicton, before 1272, by Margery one of the co-heirs of William de Bykedon. This Thomas apparently conveyed a moiety to Geoffrey Randolf ; and soon after 1279 he gives to Buildwas Abbey his land in the Vill of Bikedone. Cf. Eyton vi. 168 ; x. 165-6. Thomas de Bikedon was Bailiff' of Shrewsbury twelve times between 1273 and 1319.\u2014 Ed.] 2 [A moiety of the Seigneury of Bicton was in the hands of Geoffrey Randolf, a thriving Burgess of Shrewsbury, and son of William of Newport. Geoffrey was Bailiff of Shrewsbury six times between 1 290 and 1323. In 1291 the jury found that Geoffrey Randolf held Bicton under Buildwas Abbey, and the Abbey held under St. Chad's. Cf.

In the No mina VillarumS, Edward II. all the lay possessors disappear, and the Dean of St. Chad's is set down as sole lord of the town of Beekedon. All I find concerning Bicton in the rental of the prebends of St. Chad, 1326, is this : \u2014 Under the head of \" Tithes belonging to the Dean,\" it is said, \" He shall receive from the town of Bykedon all the tithe excepting the demesne, and 16s yearly rent ofthe same town ;\" under the head of Tithes belonging to Master Bese, \" he shall receive 2 parts of all manner of tithes of the demesne of Bykdone, and of the of Caldehote with the mortuaries.\" Master John de Wyndesovre was to receive the other third part of the tithe of the said demesne : but no mention is made of the lordship, part of which was certainly yet in lay hands, notwitbstanding the authority of the Nomina Villarum, for by deed, dated on Thursday after the feast of St. Dunstan the bishop, 13 Edward III., 1339, Julian, widow of William Hawlich, of Bykedon, grants for life to Thomas, son of Bich. de Scheteplace of Salop, 20 acres of land in Bykedon, and all her lordship in the same vill. Witnessed by Beginald de Bykedon, Philip Wyn of Bosale, and Bobert Waringe of Ondes- lowe. The terms of this deed do not import what part of the lordship of Bicton was vested in this lady, but that she really was lady (under the church) of a moiety of it may be inferred from a re-grant of the same year by Sheteplace to John son of William de Hawlich, of the 20 acres aforesaid, and half of the lordship of Bicton, but it is not improbable that she may have been the Julian daughter of William de Bigdon, who, two years 1 [Eyton reads tenuit, aud 'calls this Iter of 24 Edw.

At the Dissolution the property of Buildwas Abbey1 here was granted by Henry VIII., in his 29th year, to Edward Grey, Lord Powys, by the name of the manor or grange of Bilton, otherwise Bikton. His natural son, Edward Grey, conveyed it, in March 22 Elizabeth, by the same name, to Edward Foxe, gent. : and in Easter term of the same year a recovery was suffered of it, Edward Leigh ton, Esq., and Edward Foxe, gent., demandants, Edmund Foxe, gent., and Edward Hughes, tenants. By indenture of 26 Jan., 25 Elizabeth, Charles Foxe, Esq. (brother of Edward and Edmund) enfeoffed Thomas Leighton, gent, (two of whose sisters were wives of himself and of his brother Edward), and others, in this manor to divers uses ; and it was holden by the said feoffees in 36 Elizabeth. According to notes of the late Mr. Waring of the Hayes, entered on the copy ofthe Visitation of 1623 given by him to the School Library, his ancestor, Simon Waryng of Schelton, levied fines of land in Bykdon in 17, 18, and 19 Henry I. But I presume we have no fines of lands on record of a date so early as this by many years, nor do I find any Simon Waring in his pedigree, before the grandson of that Boger Waring who married the daughter of Leton of Bicton. Bichard Waring, who died in 1683, sold his property in this place. In 18 Henry VI. (ut videtur) John Paternoster, John Onneslowe, Edw. Leghton of M'sch, Wm.

[Richard Jenkins, Esq. (son of Thomas Jenkins, of the Abbey Foregate, High Sheriff of Salop in 1729, and grandson of Richard Jenkins, of Blandford), came into the Bicton Hall estate by his marriage with Letitia, daughter and heiress of John Muckleston, Esq., of Bicton. His son, John Jenkins, succeeded to the property, and married his cousin Emma, daughter of Thomas Jenkins, of Shrewsbury. On his death, 28 June, 1771, he was succeeded by his eldest son, Richard Jenkins, who married Harriet Constantia, daughter of George Ravenscroft, of Wrexham. Richard died at Bicton, 3 Nov., 1797, when his eldest son, Sir Richard Jenkins, G.C.B., F.R.S., D.C.L., came into possession of the Bicton Hall estate. Sir Richard was M.P. for Shrewsbury 1836-1841 ; he married Elizabeth Helen, daughter of Hugh Spottiswoode, Esq., aud died 30 Dec., 1853. On Sir Richard Jenkins's death, the Bicton Hall estate was purchased, ia 1854, by John Wingfield, Esq., of Onslow, Lieut-Col. 4th Dragoons, aud High Sheriff in 1814. He died 31 Aug., 1862 ; and by bis Will left it to his nephews, the Rev. William Wingfield and Anthony Wingfield, who, in 1873, sold it to their elder brother, Col. Charles George Wingfield, of Onslow, J. P. and D.L., and High Sheriff in 1873, the present owner of the Bicton Hall estate. Colonel Wingfield is son of the late Rev. Charles Wingfield, M.A , of the Gi*o, by Emma his wife, sister of the before-named Sir Richard Jenkins, G.C.B. Charles John Morris, Esq., of Wood Eaton Manor and Oxon, owns a considerable part of the land lying within the parish of Bicton. It came into the Morris family at various times. The Bicton House estate, which was purchased from the Hanmers, came to Mr. Morris under the will of Mrs. Crawford, who before her marriage was a Miss Morris. The Udlington estate was purchased by the late Mr. Edward Morris from Viscount Boyne ; and upon his decease it came to his nephew, the said C. J. Morris, Esq., who served the office of High Sheriff of Shropshire in 1884. The property near Calcott lane, formerly belonged to the Myttons. \u2014 Ed.] INCUMBENTS OF BICTON. From MS. Top.

[The patronage of the Vicarage belongs to the Vicar of St. Chad's, Shrewsbury. The old Church is said to have been erected in the reign of Edward VI., but has been altered, and had several additions made thereto. It consists of nave, with western gallery, and two side chapels on the north side. In 1754, the north-western chapel was added, under which are the vaults belonging to the respective owners of the Up Rossall and Down Rossall estates. In the former are in terred : Humphrey Sandford, Esq., High Sheriff of Shropshire 1787,"], [145, "BICTOX. 131 who was born 1718, aud died 1791 ; Humphrey, his eldest son, who was born 1747, aud died unm. in 1777 ; also Humphrey, his eldest grandson, born 1782, died 1856, and Frances his wife, born 1791, died 1843 ; and several other members of the Sandford family. In the latter are interred Colonel Cecil Forester, and Anne his wife, dau. and coheir of Robert Townshend, Esq. ; Catherine Stewart, nee Forester, wife of Major Stewart, and their children ; and the children of Dr. Forester. In 1788, when the old parish church of St. Chad fell, the beautiful wooden altar-piece was removed to Bicton, where it is still to be seen ; and to make room for it, the east end of the church was extended, by adding* to the nave the portion now com prising the communion table and the pews on each side of it. In 1832, pursuant to a resolution passed at a Vestry meeting held Dec. 27th at St. Chad's Church, a faculty was obtained from the Bishop of Lichfield, for adding the north-eastern chapel to Bicton Church, which was shortly afterwards erected at the sole expense of the late Col. Wingfield, for the accommodation of himself and his tenants. In 1858, the Vestry and Porch were added by the late Col. Wingfield, and the present Humphrey Sandford, Esq., of the Isle, who from 1 857 to 1869 was Senior Churchwarden of St. Chad's parish. In the Church are 6 Hatchments of the Jenkins, Sandford, and Forester families : and also the following Monuments : On the Forth Wall : (1) Sir Richard Jenkins, G.C.B., F.R.S., D.C.L., of Bicton Hall, late M.P. for Shrewsbury, died December 30, 1853, aged 68.

The Old Church being deemed too small for the wants of the parish, and inconvenient, aud dilapidated, a new Church has been erected. The foundation stone was laid by Bishop Bromby on 6th August, 1885, and the building consecrated by the Bishop of Lich field on 16 Sept., 1887. It consists of nave and chancel, with Vestries and Organ-chamber, and a Tower with four bells ; and was erected at a cost of _E3,400, on a site given by Colonel Wingfield.

By the late Rev. JOHN BRICK DALE BLAKEWAY, M.A. BROUGHTON, anciently BURGHTON. A small parish within the Liberties of Shrewsbury, containing the Townships of Broughton and Yorton. Mr. Reynolds, in his Commentary on Antoninus, would suppose this place the Roman Rutunium, but he adduces no proof. An alleged similarity in the names and the proper distance from Wroxeter are his only grounds for this untenable position. The Church of St. Chad of Shrewsbury held Burtone in the hundred of Bascherche in the Saxon times, and at the general survey. It was rated to the Danegeld at 2 hides, but there were 5 carucates1 in tillage, 2 of which (as I conceive) were occupied by 3 villans. The excess of carucates over hides and the quantity of land assigned to each villan bespeaks much attention in the ecclesiastics to the improvement of their estates and the comfort of their tenants. Burtune, in the hundred of Bascherche, occurs likewise in Domesday under the possessions of St. Mary, to which it also belonged in the days of the Confessor. It was rated to the Dane geld at 5 hides, yet no more than 3 carucates1 were accounted for, the half of one of which was holden by a pidest, and the other two and a half by 7 villans. 1 [Not carucates (carucat\u00e6), but teams (caruc\u00e6). \u2014 En.]"], [148, "HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. 134 The surveyors note that there was room for 3 more carucates [teams], and that there was a wood capable of fattening 24 hogs. This is a great difficulty. I can find no place except the place before us to which both these entries can refer. Yet its extent is far unequal to the existence of 7 hides. I can only conjecture that St. Mary's Broughton is the present Clive and Sansaw.1 They do not occur in Domesday, nor does St. Mary in any subsequent record appear to have any connection with Broughton except, as will be seen hereafter, in a way which adds some strength to the present conjecture. It is certain that Broughton was a place of much greater consequence in days of yore than it is at present, and the two names are in effect the same, Brough being one of the modes in which more recent times have en deavoured to represent the guttural sound of the Saxon burh, so difficult to be pronounced by modern organs. We learn from Camden (Britannia, ed. Gibson, p. 283) that Burton in Gloucestershire is in ancient grants Burgtone. Yorton is a township of Broughton. At the time of Domesday a separate manor and township. It is there written Jartune,2 and was then holden (as it had been in Saxon times) by the Church of St. Chad of Salop. It was rated at 2 hides, but the land com prised 4 carucates [teams], one of which was occupied by a priest and a villan. Yorton passed through the same hands with Brough- 1 [Mr. Blakeway is right in his conjecture. The Burtone and Lartune described in Domesday as held by St. Chad's are equivalent to the modern Broughton and Yorton, places which now form the parish of Broughton ; whilst the Burtune, described in Domesday as held by St. Mary's, is undoubtedly Clive and Sansaw, two townships to this day in the parish of St. Mary. Cf Eyton x. 160, 162. \u2014 Ed.] 2 In the printed Domesday Lartune, as Loclehul, when the original has Joclehul.

In 2 Edward I. the Dean and Canons of St. Chad are found to hold it in socage of the Bishop of Chester.1 In the Inquisition of St. Chad's possessions, 1326, is a list of the Dean's tenants in Yorton. Its tithes, which were a part of the property of the deanery of that church, were demised with those of Broughton for 61 years to Humphrey Onslowe, Esq., in 34 Hen. VIII. ; and in 2 Edward VI. the reversion was leased to Beston for 21 years, as is stated in the account of Broughton. In 21 Elizabeth, land and tithe held by Roger Bromley, and the advowson of the church, were granted to Sir Christopher Hatton, but I am not sure that we can certainly conclude from these words that there was actually a church at Yorton. The clerks of that day seem to have inserted almost any words into royal grants which the purchasers of such grants suggested. One of the prebends of St. O had was called the prebend of Yorton. Under the rental of it, in the grant to Beston, are included : \u2014 \" Diverse yearly rents issuing out of lands there to the amount of 5s. 4d., and the ferm of the tithe of sheafs, hay, and all other tithes there, demised to Bromley as above mentioned, amount ing to 16s. 8d., which sum was to be divided between four ofthe prebendaries.\" In 28 Edward I. it is found that Broughton and Yorton are held of the Dean and Canons of St. Chad in free socage, and that the Dean himself holds it of the Bishop of Chester without any service ; and in the Inquisition of the possessions of St. Chad's in 1326, among the tithes belonging to the 1 [The Pimhill Hundred Roll of 1255 says that \" the Dean and Canons of St. Chad, Salop, hold iv hides in Burhton and Iyarton of the fee of the Bishop of Chester.

From the manner in which the Church of Broughton lies unenclosed and open to the adjoining fields, without any appearance of a churchyard fence, it should seem to have been a mere feldeyrie or chapel of ease (on which, see Whitaker's History of Whalley, p. 46). The field-kirk, indeed, had no right or place of sepulture, whereas a few graves are huddled together on the south side of Broughton Church, but they are all of late date, and Mr. Dawson expressly speaks of it as a church in the fields. It was, however, a place of note in the days of Popery, if the indulgences recorded in a paper pre- served in Gough's History of Middle, and thence printed in Phillips's History of Shrewsbury, p. 94, refer to it. But concerning this there is some difficulty. That paper purports to contain the \" Statutes, indul- gences, and pardons granted to the holy chapel of our lady of Broughton, in the county of Salop,\" and Mr. Gough, the historian of Middle, who lived in the neighbourhood, expressly says, it was \"afterwards\" (i.e., after the destruction of a small monastery, of which more presently) accounted a chapel in the parish of St. Mary. Yet it is certain that the Broughton which belonged to St. Chad was dedicated to St. Margaret ; and the Inquisition of the town liberties in 7 Henry VIII. expressly states that the townships of Burghton and Yorton are within and of the parish of St. Chad. Mr. Gough, already quoted, says that \"Broughton did formerly belong, as some say, to a small monastery, which stood on a bank cast up by men's hands near Broughton church,\" though he intimates his own belief that it was a castle which stood on the bank, and gave name to the place, \"Broughton quasi Burghton.\" I have already intimated that the most diligent searcher into our provincial antiquities was assailed by the same difficulty that now perplexes us. William Mytton, writing to Browne Willis in 1741, says : \u2014 \" In my last I sent you word that Broughton"], [151, "137 BROUGHTON. was dedicated to St. Margaret, but looking over some papers drawn up by an old attorney in my neighbour- hood, he says 'tis dedicated to St. Mary, and mentions old bulls of two Popes, viz., St. Julian (sic) lind and Leo Xth, which tell the occasion of its being built, and in short, makes a long story of it. This he says he found in the minister's study of that parish after his death, but whether this was the original or a copy I can't say, and so I leave it to your choice.\" By the old attorney, Mr. Mytton evidently means Gough, who states himself to have found the paper quoted above in the study of his old schoolmaster, Mr. Wm. Sukar, minister of Broughton, after his decease. The mistake of Julian for Julius proves further the identity, but Mr. Gough was no attorney. My opinion is that St. Mary's Burtune in Domesday is the present Clive and Sansaw,1 but it is not improbable that that collegiate church might retain an oratory in Broughton in token of its former connection with the place, and that this oratory stood on the spot indicated by Gough, and for which the Dean of St. Mary's might have interest enough with the sovereign pontiffs, Julius II. and Leo X., who filled the papal chair at the commence- ment of the 16th century, to procure the privileges contained in the paper preserved by Gough. That document states that \" the holy chapel of our Lady of Broughton was begun by the revelation and power of God, and the miracle of our Lady,\" but the particulars of this legend are not recorded. Every person who visited the chapel, and recited a pater noster and ave maria before the image of the Virgin, and every bene factor to the building and support of the chapel, were to receive 1,5002 days of pardon, with clear remission. 1 [See p. 320 ante, note 1.\u2014 Ed.] 2 By the Council of Lateran, one bishop present at the dedication of a church might grant indulgence only for 40 days. If more bishops were present, for a year, and no longer (Stavely on Churches, p. 96). This pardon then of four years and two months required the intervention of the Pope."], [152, "138 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. But it should seem that the prayers which were to be followed by these valuable privileges must be pronounced on the feasts peculiarly appropriated to the Virgin Mary, viz., her conception (Dec. 8), nativity (Sep. 8), purification (Feb. 2), annunciation (Mar. 25), assump tion (Aug. 15), and the octaves of those feasts. Per mission was also to be purchased at this chapel, for each individual to choose a priest, who should, once in his lifetime and again at the hour of death, grant him clear remission and absolution of all his sins, nothing excepted. As a further inducement to the faithful to contribute by their bounty to this chapel, an obit with dirge and mass of requiem was kept four times in the year for all those who had entitled themselves to become the objects of its benefits. These privileges, it is added, were granted by Pope Julian (Julius) lind and Leo Xth, and lately confirmed by 15 cardinals of the court of Rome, and most of the bishops of England. This con firmation, then, must have taken place in the interval between the death of the last of those Popes and the English Reformation, a space of only seven years ; yet so little was that event in contemplation of the person who drew up this advertisement (for such, in fact, it is), that he concludes with a declaration \" that the prayers which shall be said and done within the holy chapel, shall endure there for evermore.\" Almost immediately after this unlucky prediction, the stately fabric of papal superstition, \u2014 eremites and friars white, black, and gray, with all their trumpery . . . were brushed away by the rude hand of reformation ; and what candid and attentive peruser of the document just quoted can pronounce that reformation either wanton or unnecessary ? I am no unqualified panegyrist ofthe English Reformation . Its great author was truly \u2014 monstrum nulla virtute redemptum, and many of its chief instruments were compassed about with human frailty. Deep, and I fear, irreparable, has been the wound it gave to Christian unity. Most important would have been the benefits resulting, had it been"], [153, "139 BROUGHTON. attainable, from a reform without a separation from the Church of Rome. Neither would I willingly paint the errors of that church in colours darker than the truth. I revere in her the traces of primitive antiquity, and I would emulate the models of sincere piety which she has produced both in her clergy and laity. But masses for the dead, absolution of all sins, \" nothing excepted,\" pardon of \" all punishment due in purgatory for faults and offences committed against God and man \" (the terms of the form annexed to the paper just quoted) \u2014 surely enormities in doctrine such as these, leading by inevitable conclusion to equal enormities in practice, are enough almost to excuse the lustful violence of a Henry, quite sufficient to vindicate the tear of pity we shed over the infirmities of a Cranmer, and the raptures of deathless veneration with which we contem plate the sufferings of a Ridley. \" But the Church of Rome never taught that these absolutions were of any avail without the sincere repentance of him who was their object!\" I grant it. I am assured that an en lightened Romish priest would rate their effects at a value not much higher than that at which they would be prized by a sober Protestant. And I know that an enlightened Methodist teacher, and a sound divine of the English Church would differ little in their estimate of the comparative value of faith and works. But as in that I can complain that an ignorant congregation are deluded by ignorant and interested teachers into a false reliance on faith alone without works, so do I con tend in this, that the benefits of a pardon were too ostentatiously blazoned, and the necessity of repentance too studiously suppressed. That neither of these per nicious doctrines produce their full effect upon morality, or, we trust, upon salvation, we ascribe to that con science of good and ill, that lamp of the Lord implanted by God within us, which, as it were instinctively, warns the sound mind from gross aberration in practice : \" Cum ventum ad verum est, sensus moresque repugnant, Atque ipsa utilitas justi prope mater et \u00e6qui.\""], [154, "140 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. But I return to the history of Broughton, from which, if I have too long digressed, it is not, as Mr. Gough observes upon the same occasion, without a pardon. The later Deans of St. Chad's, who appear to have been much absent from their preferment, seem to have been much in the habit of leasing out their deanery. We have an instrument of this kind, dated Feb. 28, 1542-3,1 by which Master George Lee, brother of the Bishop of Lichfield, lets his deanery to ferm to Humphrey Onslow, Esq., of Onslow, for 61 years. This lease, which was made by consent of his chapter, is absolute for the term, and not dependent upon the life of the lessor. The tithes of the townships of Broughton and Yorton are expressly excepted, and reserved to the dean and his successors. But they were almost immediately after wards, viz., on the 3rd day of the following April, demised to Roger Bromley of Broughton, gent., and Johan his wife, by a lease in which \" the ferm of the Church of St. Margaret of Broughton, with all the glebes thereunto belonging, viz., a croft adjoining in the Netherfelde, a nook of land in the Wyndemyll fylde, another nook in the Crassefelde (I suppose the field abounding in cresses), and 2 acres of meadowe in Brode medowe, and all tithes, pensions, portions, obla tions, and all other profits belonging to the said church,\" are demised to them for their lives, rendering to the dean and his successors 24s. at Michaelmas, 6d. yearly for synodals, and to a chaplain celebrating divine offices in the said church, _\u00a34 6s. 8d. yearly, besides divers other rents paid yearly to certain of the prebendaries. The rapacity of Henry spared, as is well known, the collegiate churches. Sated by his unhallowed spoil, or touched in conscience, or sensible of the utility of such parochial establishments, he left the world without this additional guilt upon his soul, but he had given his 1 [Cf. Owen and Blakeway ii. 201-2, for this and the next men tioned leases. \u2014 Ed.]"], [155, "BROUGHTON. 141 ministers an example, upon the atrocity of which they were eager to improve. In the first parliament of his innocent successor, they were all thrown down by a single enactment of the unprincipled Somerset ; and as they were chiefly situated in large towns, it is to this statute that we are to ascribe that general inadequacy of provision for the incumbents of the most populous parishes, to which Mr. Studley, minister of St. Chad's in the portentous times immediately preceding the great rebellion, mainly attributes the progress of Puri tanism which led to that event. On this dissolution, the whole property of St. Chad's college was leased 22 June, 2 Edward VI., to George Beston, Esq., for 21 years.1 The ferm of St. Margaret of Broughton, as already described, and valued beyond reprises at _\u00a36 16s. 8d, being part of the dean's portion, is included in this demise from the Crown, but subject to the lives of Mr. and Mrs. Bromley. They were probably dead in 21 Elizabeth, when the queen granted the advowson of the church and tithes of St. Margaret of Broughton, belonging to the late college of St. Chad, to her favourite, Sir Chiistopher Hatton.2 In 1713, Richard Lyster, Esq., was seised in fee of the rectory and parsonage of Broton in fee, and was entitled to all the tithes of every description, great and small.

[The early records as to the Chapel of Broughton are scanty, as it was a mere dependency of St. Chad ; and the Diocesan Registers contain no records of its pre-Reformation Incumbents. There was probably a Church at Broughton at the time of the Domesday Survey, which was, no doubt, served by the Yorton priest mentioned in that record. Some account of the 16th century leases of the Church, glebe, and tithes of St. Margaret of Broughton will be found iu Oweu and Blakeway 's History, ii. 202, ifcc. In 1548 the King's Surveyor reported as follows : \u2014 \"Also the said churche of Broughton is a parishe churche in the countrie, distaunte from the said town miles : and the deane and collegians of the said collegiatt churche, having the profetts of all the tenths of the said towne of Broughton and Yarton, have byn allwayes chardged to fynd a curatt there to minister : and have demised the said xths to Roger Bromley, who is bounde by his lease to find the curatt there, and to paie suche further somes for the same, as in his lease above declarde maie appere.\" The old church was stripped of its roof and left to decay, in the year 1857, when a new church was erected. In a circular issued by the Vicar in that year, it is stated to be tbe most dilapidated church in the county, as well as the dampest and coldest. The church was a very small building. The east wall remains, with two lancet windows ; also the south wall, which contains a door-way and window, and a piscina; and portions of the west wall. The real motive for destroying the old building was the dampness of the burying ground ; but the act caunot be defended. In the old churchyard is the base of a Cross, and several tombstones. Amongst others are these : \u2014 Isabell Hales, daughter to George aud Isabell Strange of Bridgnorth, and wife to John Hales of Broughton, died 1815; Isabell Brid, died 2 Oct., 1802; Edmund, son of Richard and Elizabeth Parr ; Charles, son of Cornelius and Elizabeth Maddock, died 1823, aged 16, &c. The new church was erected by subscription, some distance away from the old church and on higher ground, on a site given by Robert Gardner, Esq., in the year 1858, and was opened in April, 1859. It consists of chancel, nave, and bell turret, and contains a tablet to a member of the Nevett family. The church is dedicated to St. Mary.

CLIVE A chapelry in the Parish of St. Mary, Shrewsbury, consisting of the townships of Clive and Sansaw, each having a separate constable and being a separate manor. There can scarcely be a doubt that Clive was an ancient possession of the collegiate Church of St. Mary, from times antecedent to the Conquest, but Domesday passes it by in silence, unless, as I conjecture, it was that part of Broughton which then belonged to that church,1 and our few public records of property for nearly two centuries after are almost wholly confined to catalogues of the tenants by military service. I find no mention of this place before the Iter of Henry III., in which it is recorded to be \" elemosina Regis capelle sue de Salop.\" In the Hundred-Roll of Pimhill 28 Edward I.2 more fully: \"the dean and canons of St. Mary hold the vills of Clive and Sansawe of the King in frank almoign : and the men of Clive and Sansawe hold it of the said canons in free socage. \" In the reign of Edward III. John le Strange of Whitchurch, a potent baron, had molested the men of this chapelry and the contiguous one of Astley, in the occupation of certain land which they had assarted, or cleared from the waste. As their landlords were a spiritual body, he probably thought to commit this outrage with impunity. The dean of St. Mary's, how- 1 [Clive aud Sansaw, both in Saxon times and at Domesday, formed that part of Broughton which belonged to St. Mary's. The Manor is thus described in Domesday : \u2014 \"The Church of St. Mary held and holds Burtune. There are five geldable hides. One priest has there half a team, and seven villans with two teams and a half ; and there might yet be there three teams more. There is wood for fattening 24 hogs. In the time of King Edward it was worth 10s. It is now worth 15s.\" In 1255, the Pimhill Hundred-Roll describes this estate simply as Clive : \u2014 \" The Dean and Canons of St. Mary, Salop, hold 4 geldable hides in Clive, and it is the King's almoign to his chapel of Salop. It does suit to County and Hundred, and pays 2s. for Stret ward and motfee.\" Cf. Eyton x. 160.\u2014 Ed.] 2 [Eyton calls this \"the Pimhill Tenure-Roll of 1279.\" Cf.

The substance of an instrument by which the college released him from this bond upon condition of his performing its stipulations, is as follows : \u2014 \" Covenant made between Monsr John Le Strange of Blankminster and Sir Tho. de Baddebye, dean of ye free chapel of our Lady of Salopirs and ye chanons of ye same chapel, lords of ye towns of Astleys, Sonsawe and Clyve : viz. que le dit Monr Johan ad empris de fair reseisir & restitution avoir as dits Dean & chanons of all ye lands assarted & occupied by their tenants & neifs in ye same towne, & also of ye woods & wast belonging to ye sd chapel in ye sd towns, & to distrain their tenants & neifs to make to them their rents & services due : to do which he has been commanded by the king by writ of privy seal & as he is bound hereto in _640 : ye dean &c grant that ye sd obligation be void if he perform it. 18 Edw. III. Done as Salopirs.\" As tenure in socage, though the most beneficial, is the humblest of all tenures, we must not expect to find any great families among the ancient proprietors of Clive, Thomas Russel, otherwise called de la Clyve, was town clerk of Shrewsbury (clericus burgi Salop) in the beginning of the 14th century, and it seems from the numerous bequests, among which is one of 12d. to the chapel here, was evidently a person of opulence and consideration. As late as 7 Henry TL I find a John Russel of Sonsawe, who was, I presume, one of his des cendants. This seal1 is appended to a release of actions dated 7 Henry VI. from Jn. Russel of Sonsawe and Emelyn his wife to Ralph Frebody of Smethcote and Margaret his wife, to which the releasors say, \" sigilla 1 [The seal, a cross between four birds, and legend of which \"com une\" alone is legible, is tricked in the MS., but is not here copied. \u2014 Ed. J"], [163, "CLIVE, 149 nostra apposuimus ;\" but this, which evidently appears to have been a common seal, is the only one which was ever affixed to this instrument, (cart. pen. Jos. loxdale arm.) The most ancient family that has occurred to me, after that of Russel, as connected with this place, is that of Wycherley, of whom Roger Wycherley of Clyve is stated to have lived in 10 Henry IV.; and the family was of sufficient consequence to have its pedigree entered \u2022*\u25a0* in the ancientest visitacion book of Shropshire remairing in the Heralds' office,\" which Dugdale had seen, i.e., I suppose the visitation of 1584. Another ancient family at Clive was that of Gery, who may perhaps mount up beyond the Norman Conquest, since Gheri, a free man, qui dare & vendere potuit, who had the uncontrolled dominion over his property, enjoyed Octune and Etbritone in the time of the Confessor. But the earliest mention of the family of Gery, as connected with this place, is in 27 Henry VI., when Richard Gery is entitled of Clive. In 38 Henry VI. he occurs as of Clyff,and with the addition of'gentilmon.' He probably removed to kShrewsbury, as in 14 Edward IV. I find Rich. Gery called son and heir of Rich. Gery formerly of Salop ; and the same Christian name was continued for several descents, since in 34 Hen. VIII. (if this be not, as I suspect, an error of my transcript for Henry VI.) is Rich. Gery of Clyve, gent., son and heir of Rich. Gery, lately deceased. All these appear in the Waring evidences of lands in Shelton. Mary, the daughter and co-heir of Rich. Gery of Clyve, married Wm. Wycherley of the same place, who was living in 3 and 4 Philip and Mary. The family of Wycherley is chiefly remarkable for having produced the celebrated William Wycherley, who, however unduly he may have been extolled by his contemporaries, and however mean his productions may now appear, must certainly be regarded as the father of our modern comedy. Such particulars as I have been able to collect of this writer are subjoined. The annexed pedigree will sufficiently explain the subsequent"], [164, "150 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. descent of his property to Robt. Embrey, who was stated at his death in 1786 to be lord of the manor of Clive, though I understand that Mr. Gardner of Sansaw lays claim to the manor. What Cicero says of a famous oration of an old orator whom he commends, is perhaps applicable to the extra vagant praises which have been bestowed upon the comedies of Wycherley : \u2014 \" H\u00e6c de incestu laudatur oratio puerilis est multis locis : de amore, de tormentis, de rumore, loci sane inanes : veruntamen nondwm tritis nostrorum hominum auribus, nee erudita civitate toler abiles.\" Brutus 32. What he says afterwards is very true : \" Quo nihil est melius, id laudari, qualecunque est, solet.\" 86. This parish having given birth to that rare production of nature, an original genius, in the person of William Wycherley, the father of modern comedy, we shall perhaps be pardoned in deviating from our usual course in presenting our readers with a few particulars of his life. He was, however, much indebted for his future eminence to the care taken of his education by his father, and that father was in every way so remarkable a person, and the first of his family who emerged from the yeomanry of the country, that a sketch of his history may not be unacceptable. The following account of Mr. Wycherley the father is chiefly derived from two MS. authorities. 1. Rich. Gough of Newton, in the parish of Middle, completed his account of that parish about the beginning of the last century. The author was a respectable farmer, who amused the leisure hours of his declining age by committing to paper every particular which he could collect concerning the history of his neighbours, none of whom were too high or too low for his notice. It is written with a characteristic garrulity and simplicity, which render it not uninteresting, though it sometimes excites a smile at the expense of the honest author, and may occasionally remind the reader of the Memoirs of P. P. , cleric of this parish."], [165, "151 CLIVE. 2. The Rev. Samuel Garbet, M.A., second master of Wem school, began the history of that parish about 1740. This is in point of research, judgment, and diction, a very superior performance to Gough's, and is, in fact, a very excellent production. A part of it has stolen into print in the Monthly Magazine for It seems to be the work alluded to by Mr. Archdeacon Plymley in his Agricultural Survey of Shropshire, under the title of a \" History of the Hundred of Bradford.\" Daniel Wycherley, then, was the eldest son of Daniel Wycherley of Clive, in this parish, by Margery his wife, daughter and heir of Wm. Wolfe of Acton Reynald. From the Visitation of this county in 1663 it appears that the family had been seated at Clive at least as early as 1410. He was born about the year 1617. (This date is taken from his age at the time of his death, as stated by Mr. Garbet, but I should suppose him to be older. In the register of admittances to the Free Schools of Shrewsbury, the name occurs in 1616, but I will not affirm that this was our Daniel Wycherley. It may have been a person of both these names, a Batchelor of Divinity, whom we learn from Walker's Sufferings of the Clergy was ejected from his fellowship of Queen's College, Cambridge, and from the rectory of Hemingstone in co. Suffolk for his loyalty ; he may have been of this family, though I cannot connect him with the Wycherleys of Clive.)1 Having been well educated in all sorts of learning that the country could afford, Daniel Wycherley went to London, where, after remaining for a time in the service of some person belonging to the law, he at length obtained an office in the exchequer.2 All this must have taken 1 I find mention of this name in Camden's Epistles, p. 42, where Gonter writing to that antiquary says, I enclosed my letter in that of our friend Mr. Vecherley. 2 \" Having the prospect of obtaining a teller's place in the King's Exchequer, his aunt in Acton furnished him with \u00a3100, which pro cured the place.\" \u2014 Gough. The reader will not require any proof that it could not be a teller's place which was obtained at so easy a rate."], [166, "152 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. place before the breaking out of the great rebellion, since before that event he also became steward to John Powlett, fifth Marquis of Winchester, an appointment which furnished him with an occasion of greatly in- creasing his fortune, and of acting a more conspicuous part on the theatre of the world than he would other- wise have done. The share which the Marquis took in the civil wars is well known. He was a singular character. It was said of his family that its represen- tatives were alternately fools and wise men. The enthusiasm of this nobleman was evinced by the stout resistance of Basinghouse, on every pane of glass in which he caused to be inscribed his motto : Aymez Loyaulte\". For that loyalty he was thrown into prison and his estates were confiscated. In this emergency the talents of Mr. Wycherley for business proved emin- ently serviceable to his employer. With great despatch he procured the sum requisite to pay the marquis's composition (so says Gough, but I cannot, however, find the name of the marquis in the list of those who compounded for their estates ; and indeed, we can hardly suppose that so capital a delinquent, whose house had withstood the Parliamentary forces for above two years, would be admitted to make any composition). He thereby gained the uncontrolled management of his vast estates, was enabled to remit considerable sums of money to the exiled monarch (Garbet) . Absolute power of any kind is very unfavourable to honour and probity ; and if Mr. Wycherley's contemporaries may be credited, he did not pass through a situation of great temptation with an unsullied character.1 However this may be, he was enabled to make the great purchase of the Manors of Wem and Loppington. Gough, who spares nobody, would insinuate that this sale was founded on a fraudulent and collusive transaction between Wycher ley and a Mr. Hessell, the Earl of Arundel's steward. Mr. Hessell had, according to him, a commission to sell 1 He was admitted of tbe Inner Temple, November 25, 1658."], [167, "CLIVE, 153 the copyhold tenures of Wem to the copyholders in order to raise money for the payment of the earl's com position. But this measure not proving so productive as was expected, he was at length obliged to sell the manor to Wycherley, who had obliged him with certain advantageous purchases of the lands of his principal, the Marquis of Winchester. This statement is, how ever, entirely erroneous. The Earl of Arundel never compounded, as he acted quite a neutral part in the great convulsions of his country ; also, it is certain from Mr. Garbet's MS. that the sale did not happen to take place till July, 1665, five years after the restoration. \"So,\" says Gough, \"Mr. Wycherley became lord of the manor, and was by some persons called Lord Wycherley; he was afterwards put into the commission of the peace for this county, and wrote himself Esquire. And now I've brought this Esq. to his zenith or vertical point. \" Parva quidem crescunt lente, summisque negatum Stare diu.\" Ovid. The justices ofthe peace it was done. p. 150. The remaining years of Mr. Wycherley's life were clouded with litigations. Besides a tedious and un successful contest with the Marquis of Winchester, son of his patron, who called him to give an account of his stewardship, and a suit with the free schools of Shrews bury about the maintenance1 of Clive chapel, he was engaged for nine years, from 1673 to 1682, with the copyholders of Wem, from whom he demanded an augmentation of their fines, and in which he was ulti mately victorious ; but the expenses of these various suits compelled him to sell his estates ; like Swift's fictitious hero, Gulliver, \" he was almost ruined by a long suit which was decreed for him with costs.\" In 1684 he conveyed the Manors of Wem and Loppington to that odious instrument of tyranny, the infamous chief justice Jeffreys, \" and after that,\" says Gough, \" Mr. Wycherley was no more called My Lord Wycher- 1 [Or rather, patronage of Clive chapel. \u2014 Ed.]"], [168, "HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. 154 ley.\" Domestic uneasiness aggravated the misfortunes of Wycherley. By his wife Bethia, daughter of William Shrimpton of Whitchurch, in Hampshire, and \"gentle woman \" to the Marchioness of Winchester, he had a numerous family, four sons and six daughters, Besides the extravagancies of his eldest son William, which are well known, his second son George, rector of Wem, died in the Fleet prison, and his daughter Elizabeth died distracted from disappointment in a matrimonial connection. Notwithstanding these vexations and con tests he lived to a great age, being, according to Garbet, above 80 years old at the time of his death. He was buried at the Clive 7 May, 1697. But as late as the year 1703, at the court held for St. Mary's peculiar, on Sept. 13th, \" Mr. Wm. Wytcherley \" was cited to prove the will of his father, Daniel Wytcherley, Esq. The person of Mr. Wycherley was prepossessing. He was of a large stature and a comely countenance, his hair white with age. His behaviour was genteel and courteous. \" I have heard him much commended,\" says Gough, \" that he never contended with persons unable to deal with him, but with great persons.\" In effect, though his character has not been delineated by the hand of friendship, it seems probable that after making reasonable deductions for that calamy which is apt to pursue the rapid increase of wealth, we should not have much severely to arraign in his public conduct. His un kind ness in the parental relation forms a juster ground of censure. It is alluded to by Dryden in his Discourse on Satire : \" Horace,\" says he, \" gives the best character of a father which I ever read in history, and I wish a witty friend of mine, now living, had such another.\" But on this it is impossible now to decide with certainty. The virtues of that witty friend were not calculated to create much esteem or affection, and the resentment of the father was not unfounded, if it be true that the dramatist intended to depict the litigious ness of his character, by the Widow Blackacre in the \"Plain Dealer.\""], [169, "CLIVE 155 The exact date of William Wycherley 's birth is so much connected with his literary history, that it would be desirable to ascertain it, but this is a point of some difficulty. If we might believe Mr. Oldys's account of his age at the time of his death he must have been born in 1634 ; but Garbet places his birth about 16 Car. I., 1640 ; and this, though he does not state the document on which it is founded, seems nearer the truth. His father seems to have determined to give him the education of the first gentlemen of his time, and sent him to make the grand tour at an early period. On his return he resided a short time at Queen's College, Oxford, where, though he was never a member of the college nor entered upon its registers, he resided in the Provost's Lodge, and was entered in the public library under the title of philosophi\u0153 studiosus in July, 1660. (Qu\u00e6re, who was provost of Queen's ?) Hence he removed to the Inner Temple, of which he was admitted a member 4 November, 1659. Whether it was intended that he should study the law as a profession does not appear. If it was, he soon frustrated the design, and turned his attention to the muses. Burlesque poetry had been recently introduced into this country from France, and the success of Cotton's Travestie of the \u00c6neid had given it an extensive circulation among us.1 Wycherley availed himself of the prevailing taste, and produced Hero and Leander in burlesque verses, 1669, of the merit of which I am not able to speak, having never seen it. Hence the transition was not difficult to the drama. His \" Love in a Wood \" made its first appearance in 1672, and was followed in each of the three succeeding years by the \" Gentleman Dancing Master,\" the \" Plain Dealer,\" and the \"Country Wife,\"2 1 It is scarcely credible that the most sacred subjects could not escape this pollution. \" La Passion de notre Seigneur en vers bur lesques\" appeared at Paris in 1649. See the life of Cotton in Hawkin's ed. of Walton's Angler. 2 I cannot imagine how the annotator on the Tatler, No. 3, should say the \" Country Wife \" was first acted in 1683."], [170, "HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. 156 which last appeared in 1675, and closed the dramatic race of our author. His contemporaries vied with each other in applaud ing these pieces. The fastidious Rochester allows : \u2014 \" None seem to touch upon true comedy But hasty Shadwell and slow Wycherley.\" The great Dryden in the preface to his \" State of Innocence,\" 1674, writes thus : \u2014 Many .... theatre, and again (p. 52, and Dryden iii. 335). Yet when one turns to the productions that called forth these lofty encomiums, one is almost tempted to exclaim with Horace : \u2014 - \"At vestri proavi Plautinos et numeros et Laudaveie sales : nimium patieuter utrumque, Ne dicam stulte, mirati.\" [Horace, Ars Poetica, 270-2.] Wycherley told Pope that he wrote these plays in the above order at the respective ages of 19, 21, 25, and 31 or 32. But either his memory, which was a very bad one, deceived him, or he was actuated by the mean vanity of representing himself as as early an instance of premature talents as the youthful poet to whom he was addressing himself. It is surely incredible that he was in the habit of keeping his plays from 14 to 9 years in his desk before he produced them to the public. This would be an obedience to the precept of Horace of which we have seen few examples. His age when he wrote the last piece is the only date to which we can give implicit assent. The first of these pieces is really beneath criticism. To the \" Country Wife,\" which is said to have been drawn from living characters,1 and to which no one can deny the praise of sprightly and bustling intrigue, and the manner in which is thrown into the way of her gallant by Horner's perpetual efforts to keep her from his, is original and comic. Through the inimitable acting of Mrs. Jordan this play still retains a place on our stage. 1 \" In the Country Wife . . . Country Wife,\" Oldys MS. notes on Langbaine. For North I am informed we should read South Tidworth."], [171, "CLIVE, 157 But in the \" Plain Dealer \" we seek in vain for the usefulness of satire which Dryden highly commends. Its satire is directed against sincerity and frankness of character, a censure from which its original, the cele- brated Misanthrope of Moliere, is by no means exempt. (Rousseau alleged this objection to the Misanthrope, from which D'Alembert has attempted to vindicate Moliere, in his reply to the Citizen of Geneva, but with no success. He has shown indeed how the play might have been formed to convey a most useful lesson; but his arguments to prove that it might have been so constructed evidently show that it does not in its present form produce this effect). Manly, the hero of Wycherley 's piece, who has been supposed to be intended for a portrait of himself, renders the virtue and inde- pendence to which he pretends disgusting by vulgar brutality and causeless petulance. It is needless to observe that the brightest pages of our author are de- formed by that gross and undisguised ol scenity which was taken for wit by Charles, and is a conspicuous proof of the barbarism of the English court at that period. How then may we account for the high reputation which Wycherley so long enjoyed ? He was the first who brought the familiar conversation of common life upon our stage Even Shakespeare has rarely exhibited the unrestrained ease of common life. The inimitable character of Justice Shallow is the only instance I at present recollect, for even his Falstaff, unrivalled as it is, much less his Mercutia or his Beatrice, which are, I think, alleged by Johnson, are not such characters as one meets with in real life. Wycherley opened a new career in the drama, and his production^ appeared when the nation, weary of the solemn hypocrisy of the fana tical period, was not disposed to be very delicate m its choice of amusement. This was the true foundation of Wycherley's fame, which succeeding writers, dazzled with the splendour of his name, adopted without examination. Fame then was cheap, and the first"], [172, "158 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. comer sped : Dryden eulogised the conquest of Granada, nor can it reasonably excite surprise if the modern reader, who comes to the perusal of his works with his expectations raised by these exalted panegyrics, should experience a woeful disappointment. I am far, however, from wishing to pluck every laurel from his brow He was certainly a man of talents. Many of his faults were the defects of the age in which he lived, and on that account obtain our indulgence, but can never expect, after the great models which have succeeded him, to obtain the extravagant applause which they once drew forth. In a word, we may well apply to this subject the remarks of Horace on y8 merits of the ancient dramatists of his time, and which Wycherley himself adopted as ye motto to his first play, little thinking that it would ever be applicable to himself: \u2014 emendata videri Pulchra qui et exfiCtis minimum distantia miror ; Nee veniam antiquis, sed honorem et praemia posci.\" [Horace, Epist. II., i. 71-2, 78.] But we should form a very imperfect notion of Wycherley's character if we considered him merely in the light of a man of letters. His greatest merit in his own days, and that to which he owes perhaps no small share of his fame, was his character as a man of fashion. Pope, who knew him well, says that he possessed Vair noble, that is, as he explains himself, a certain air of dignity, accompanied by an entire ease of manner, perfectly unconscious of superiority and devoid of affec tation, \u2014 such an air, says he, as all noblemen should, and so few really do possess, and of which he cites the Duke of Bucks as an example.1 It is no wonder then, that with a winning and graceful exterior, and all the talents which embellish society, and a lively and brilliant flow of conversation, Wycherley embarked in all the pleasures of a gay and dissipated court, and enjoyed 1 Oldy's MS. he adds \"see Voltaire.\" The meaning of this refer ence I do not comprehend."], [173, "159 CLIVE, what is called la bonne fortune. He is even supposed to have shared with the monarch himself in the favours of the celebrated Duchess of Cleveland, who is known not to have been very constant in her amours. The manner in which their acquaintance commenced was as follows. This incident gives one a curious and not very advantageous idea of the manners of that period, in which licentiousness was not refined from any of its grossness. But when we are told that she used to visit him at hi\u00a7 chambers in the Temple, dressed like a country girl, in a straw hat, with pattens on, a basket or box in her hand, etc., it is difficult to avoid classing this story with those anecdotes which have a very slight foundation in truth. However faithless she might occasionally be to her regal lover, we cannot doubt that her intrigues were conducted with the utmost privacy, and can never believe that, well-known as she must have been, she would adopt a disguise which would only heighten her very uncommon and exquisite beauty, and attract the eyes of all passengers in the streets. These excesses, the company with which he associated, and the figure which he supported, so far exceeding the allowance which he received from an austere father, quickly involved our author in pecuniary embarrasments. From these he was extricated by his marriage, of the steps leading to which we have a curious story. (Here insert it.)1 The lady was Letitia, daughter of the Earl of Radnor, and widow of the Earl of Drogheda ; but her jointure of \u00a31,800 a year, though it released him from his more pressing difficulties, probably added little to his happiness. She was extremely jealous of her handsome and gay husband, and it is related that after he had obtained her permission to dine at a tavern with some of his old companions, she would engage a room on the opposite side of the street, from which she 1 [Mr. Blakeway has unfortunately left several gaps in his account of Wycherley, which we have no means of filling up.\u2014 Ed.]"], [174, "160 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. might watch his motions and detect the introduction of any improper company, a circumstance which may seem to be alluded to in the Country Wife, where though it is evident that if this conjecture be founded in truth, this passage must have been added long after the first representation of the piece. It was on the death of this lady, I presume, that Wycherley's distresses returned ; since we are told that he passed seven years within the walls of a prison : a woeful and gloomy contrast to the glittering scenes which he had once adorned. For this tedious confinement his father has been condemned, but with what justice it is impossible to determine, since we neither know the ability of the old man to relieve him, nor how far the conduct of the son deserved relief. (Here insert the account of his being released) , and see Malone's life of Dryden, p. 190, n. In the great revolution which ensued, I conceive Wycherley to have adhered to the abdicated monarch. To this he would be led as well by his obligations to James II. as his peculiar intimacy with Dryden. He did not, however, like that great poet, publish his dissent. He contented himself with enjoying his own sentiments in private. His spirits broken by imprisonment and disappointment, the brilliant characters with whom he had passed the morning of life departed from the scene, he was content to pass his declining years without any further struggles for public notice^ in the possession of an easy fortune which his father's death put him into the possession of, aud in the enjoyment of that reputation which he had acquired in the court of Charles. He did not, however, relinquish all attention to poetry, though it was now rather the amusement of his leisure hours than the occupation of a profession, and he cherished all a father's fondness for these productions of his old age. Pope, now rising fast into celebrity, was introduced to the veteran author, who submitted these precious manuscripts to his correction. The young poet, with the [assurance] of our author's own Manly, and with the cons-"], [175, "CLIVE. 161 ciousness of superior talents, exercised wuth so much vigour the office of a censor over these wretched rhymes, (yet see the effect of prejudice, Hill represents Pope as guilty of mean servility to Wycherley ; Richardson's Correspondence,) \u2014 that the old bard's vanity took the alarm ; and the result was not unlike the affair of Gil Bias and the Archbishop in the admired romance of Le Sage. Pope has given us a curious account of Wycherley's mode of composition. (Here insert it). With his native county and his patrimonial estates our author kept up but little connection, though a walk in the grounds of Sansaw is shewn in which he is said to have written one of his plays. In his correspondence with Pope, we find the few following notices of his visits hither.1 (Here insert them). The last transaction of his life was an act of cruelty to his heir, but of justice to his creditors. He appears to have had only a life interest in his estate, with a power, however, of settling a jointure upon any wife in proportion to the fortune which she should bring him. Aware of his approaching dissolution, and very desirous of availing himself of this power to raise a sum of 1 Among John Dennis' letters, printed in the Familiar and Courtly Letters, 8vo, 1700, are several addressed to Wycherley. Tbe first of these is directed to him at \" Cleve near Shrewsbury.\" He says. ' When I venture to write to you, I consider you, not as the greatest comick wit that ever England bred, sent purposely to cheer the ears of the wittiest men, and to ravish the hearts of the most beautiful women, \u2014 no Sir : \u2014 that iu writing to you I may assume some spirit, I only consider you as the humble hermit at Cleve ; humble even iu the full possession of all those extraordinary qualities, the knowledge of which has made me proud.\" \" None but such real greatness as yours can capacitate a man to be truly humble.\" \" When I receive your answer, I shall then believe, what you were pleas'd to tell me when I saw you last ; that you are much more humble in the clear air on your mountain at Cleve, than when you are iu fog and sulphurous smoke in Bow Street.\" Wycherley in reply says, \u2014 \" Though I receive no rents here, yet I must own if I did, I could not receive greater satisfaction than I had from yours with even a letter of exchange;\" and the whole correspondence runs in the same hyperbolical strain of panegyric, that it looks like a reciprocation of sarcastic irony."], [176, "162 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. money sufficient to pay off his debts, he commissioned his relation, Captain Shrimpton, to find out a lady who was willing to sink her fortune upon these terms. The lady, she was Elizabeth, daughter of Mr. Joseph Jackson, gent., of Hertingfordbury, was procured, and the marriage celebrated in the 81st year of Wycherley 's age, if we may believe Oldys, but in his 79th year according to other accounts. (See Memoirs qf Mrs. Oldfield). Soon after which our author died, on the 1st January, 1715. This date and Oldys' statement of the age of Wycherley is confirmed by a MS. addition to the Athen\u0153 in the Bodleian Library, p. 977, by Rawlinson. He was buried in a vault at St. Paul's, Covent Garden. In his person Wycherley was remark ably handsome, a circumstance of which he was suffic iently sensible. There is a mezzo-tinto of him at the age of 28, by Smith, after a picture by Sir Peter Lely, which it is said he was wont to survey in his declining years with an emotion of regret, and a mournful sigh of Quantum mutatus ! Lord Chesterfield, says Oldys, . . . . marks of age, This portrait seems to be the same referred to by Granger, iv. 44, and the testiness of which Oldys speaks is very conspicuous in our author's correspondence with Pope. The old ballad of\" My Father was born before me,\" which appeared in 1672, agrees in so many respects with the personal history of Wycherley, that I cannot but conjecture that it was intended for him, though in this case we must suppose a few circumstances have been altered to prevent the resemblance from being too glaring. As this once noted song is now but little known, and as it is not without some merit, it is here subjoined for the reader's consideration. (Here insert it). Mr. Ireland,1 born at the Trench Farm, near Wem, 1 A letter from Mr. Egerton Jeffreys, dated at Shrewsbury, Sep tember 25, 1804, gives the following information, picked up, he says, from two old people at Wem : \u2014 \" The poet Wycherley married on his death-bed a young woman from London, supposed to be a stationer's daughter, which he was induced to do in consequence of his brother"], [177, "CLIVE, 163 and the birth-place of Wycherley; \u2014 his mother was a daughter of the Rev.

The Charity Commissioners reported (about 1830) that the property then held by the governors consisted of (inter alia) the tithes of Clive and Sansaw, which were let to yearly tenants at rents amounting annually to \u00a3347 13s, and a chief rent at Sansaw, paid by the Rev. Dr. Garder, of 8s.; but they note that \"part of these tithes are in dispute, the question being whether a few acres of land are or are not in the township of Clive.\" They also paid to the curate of Clive the yearly Btipend of \u00a345, in 1827 and 1828. (See Charity Commissioners' Report, Salop, vol. xxvii., pp. 369, &c.) In 1580, and previously, there were great disputes between the parishioners of St Mary's and the inhabitants of Astley aud Clive, who endeavoured to free themselves from the burden of contributin\u00b0* to the repairs of the window in Trinity aisle in St. Mary's Church."], [183, "169 CLIVE, The parties appealed to the Council of the Marches, who decided against Astley and Clive. (See Owen and Blakeway, ii, 362). The chapel at Clive consisted of a nave, without transept or separate chancel. In 1849-52, a partial restoration was effected by the Rev. William Jeudwine, the incumbent ; the west gallery was removed, with a low ceiling and old pews ; three windows on the south side and a west window were inserted ; a turret with two bells, and a new font, and stone pulpit added ; the carved panels of this pulpit are now inserted in the wall of the new porch, and the old font was buried beneath the new one. The total cost was about \u00a3425. In 1885-7, the Chapel was thoroughly restored by the Rev. J. Cooper Wood, the incumbent, Mr. Chas. J. Ferguson being the architect, at the cost of between \u00a35,000 and \u00a36,000, the bulk of which was contributed by J. J. Bibby, Esq., aud Thomas Meares, Esq. A new porch, chancel, vestry, and organ chamber were added, and chancel arch inserted. The Church was lined throughout with dressed ashlar work, the interior of the walls having been removed to the outer skin of ashlars. The old roof was replaced by one of carved oak. The nave was laid with woodblocks, and the chancel with marble. The wood work of the seats, screens, choir stalls, pulpit, lectern, and reredos i3 of oak, and enriched with exquisite carving by the best English carvers. The reredos is an alabaster panel, representing Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper. A two-manual organ was given by John Hall, Esq., of Holbrook. A. mortuary was added, and the churchyard extended, laid out, and walled. The restoration was most thorough and effective ; and the carved wood work is as fine as any in the county. The west window of the chapel is filled with stained glass repre senting the Ascension, and was erected in 1876 in memory of Charles and Elizabeth Harding of Clive Hall, by their daughter Catharine. Two windows on the south side are also filled with glass, representing four of the apostles. A plinth on the west and on parts of the north and south sides of the chapel marks an earlier and smaller building than the present one. It seems to show an original entrance at the west end. The porch on the north side has a Norman arch, with a mitred figure above. In the Churchyard are many tombstones to members of the Russell, Wycherley, Ravenshaw, Huffa, Harding, and other old Clive families. Amongst others are these : \u2014 John Wycherley, gent, third son of Daniel Wycherley, Esq, died 20 June, 1691.

JOHtf BRtCKDALE BLAKEWAY, M.A. CROWMEOLE and GOOSEHILL. A TOWNSHIP IN THE PARISH OF ST. CHAD. At the time of the Domesday survey, and no doubt also in the Saxon times, though that is not expressed, the Bishop of Chester held one manor, Melam, in the hundred of the city, i.e., within the liberties of Shrews- bury. \" Non est neque suit hospitatum ; 'n that is, as I understand it, those who occupy it under the Bishop do not reside upon it. As it appears from Domesday that the Bishop had certain cottages and burgesses in Shrewsbury, \u2014 (the burgesses of that time and long after were little better than cottagers) , \u2014 it is probable that they were employed in the tillage of this property, from which they could so readily return home every night to their cottages in the town. Buildwas Abbey was erected some time between 1128, when its founder, Roger Clinton, succeeded to the see of Coventry, and 1139, when it is noticed in a charter of King Stephen ; and either Clinton or one of his immediate successors granted to those monks the 1 [Hospitatum, a word equivalent to colonatum. It occurs else where iu Domesday : a domus hospitata is opposed to mansio vasta. The Bishop's manor was not occupied by any Burgesses or other Free Tenants, nor was it geldable.

This Collecta was called Church omber,1 i.e., as I suppose, an alms given to theChurch. But the manor itself continued in the see till 1192, when Hugh Nonant, the fourth successor to Clinton, conferred upon the monks of Buildwas, \" villam de Meola cum omnibus pertinentiis suis, et burgenses2 de Salopesburi ad nos pertinentes \"\u2014the vill of Meole with all its appurtenances and the burgesses of Shrewsbury to us belonging \u2014 \" et collectum bladi3 qu\u00e6 appelletur 1 [Eyton points out that the impost called Cherchombre was an ecclesiastical due, a right to collect corn, a charge assessable on the Hundreds of Recordine and Conodovre by the Bishops of Coventry and Lichfield. This charge was made over by Bishop Peche to the monks of Buildwas ; and payment to these monks was sometimes resisted. Cf. Eyton vi, 327-9, 359.\u2014 Ed.] 2 [Were these burgesses of Shrewsbury thus made over resident on the land of Meole, or within the walls of Shrewsbury ? Eyton points out that sixteen burgesses of Shrewsbury, not connected with Meole, had belonged to the Domesday Bishop of Chester ; and he suggests that some of these burgesses were occupying the land of Meole in the time of Bishop Clinton. Ibid. \u2014 Ed.] 3 Winterdyne, Nov. 21, 1814. Dear Sir, I am extremely sorry that it is not in my power to give you a satisfactory explanation of the phrase, \" collectum bladi.\" The obvious meaning of the words might seem to refer to Tythe in kind, when applied to a particular parish, but it appears from a charter confirmed to Buildwas by Ric. Ist, A.D. 1189, that this privilege extended to the Hundreds of Wrocwardyn and Cundover, \" et collectam bladi qu\u00e6 vocatur Chirtumber de duobus Hundredis de Wrocwordin et Conedovere ; \" of course, it could not be Tythe. I conceive this claim must have been something of the nature of what was called Chirset or Churchesset, which was a tribute of corn presented to the Church on St. Martin's Day (see Cowel). The word Ambry, pronouncod also Aumbry, is a contraction of Almonary. It was a place in the Monasteries where the provisions destined for the poor were kept and distributed. Now we have only to suppose the word Chxxrch-omber, or rather ombre, coming from a Norman with an accent on the last syllable, and Church-ambry becomes Chirt-ambre, which may reasonably be interpreted Church-alms, a Church tribute. The change from ombrfe to omber is very easily allowable. This is conjectural, and I have in vain looked into all the Glossaries for"], [189, "175 CROWMEOLE AND GOOSEBILL.

It is a proof of the slight way in which any researches of antiquity were conducted in those inquests, that the donation is said to have been made at the foundation of Buildwas, which did not take place for half a century afterwards. (But Mr. Moseley says that Monk Meole was granted to Buildwas at the foundation !) All the monastic orders were of use in reducing the country to a state of cultivation. The Cistercians, to whom Build was belonged, were more especially so. Agriculture was one of their express objects (Whitaker's History of Whalley, p. 107). They kept most of their land in their own hands ; and hence, in the entry just quoted, this is called the grange of Meole. The same entry further shows the good state to which they brought their land, for five carucates at \u00a310 is 4d. an acre, equal, according to the usual computation, to 9s. 4d. of present money.

As the Cistertian houses were exempt from the pay ment of tithes, etc., even if this had not been the case, the house of Buildwas was entitled to the collecta bladi in Monke meole from the time almost of its foundation, the right of the College of St. Chad to these tithes must ascend to a period of the remotest antiquity, anterior to the claim of Cistertian exemption, and at least co\u00e6val with the age of Roger de Clinton.

A similar grant was probably made to the succeeding Incumbents of St. Chad's. The following is a further abstract of Mr. Tench's settlement of the tithes of Crow Meole, referred to above : \u2014 By Indenture, dated 18 December, 1674, 26 Charles II, and made between Nathaniel Tench of London, son and heir of Nicholas Tench, late of the City of London, merchant, deceased, of the one part, and Rowland Middleton, Esq, Mayor, Adam Ottley, Thomas Baldwin, Esqs, Samuel Lloyd, Richard Taylor, Thomas Cotton, Roger Griffith, William Thine, John Hill, Edward Gosner, Arthur Hincks, and Robert Forrester, Alder men, Inhabitants of the Town of Shrewsbury, of the other part, It was witnessed that the said Nathl. Tench did grant, bargain, &c, unto the said parties, All those the tithes and tenths of corn, grain, and hay, and all other tithes and tenths whatsoever growing upon the farm and grange of Crow Meole in co.

In a letter addressed to the Mayor and Corporation, and dated 2 Feb, 1674-5, Mr. Nathl. Tench states that he \" had some while since an inclination to dispose of those tithes, bought by my father Mr. Nicholas Tench deceased, and from him descended to myself, unto the Church again. I thought I could not do it more justly than to return them again to that very Church, to which by the ancient deeds it doth appear that they did formerly belong, which is the Church of St. Chadd in your town.\" The estate of Crow Meole, otherwise called Monk Meole and Monk Hill, was for some period the property of the Mytton family ; and in November, 1824, the late John Mytton of Halston sold it in lots by public auction. Part of the estate was conveyed by Mr. Mytton, 25"], [196, "HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. 182 March, 1825, to John Geary, who, on 25 March, 1835, conveyed it to Richard Newcombe. Other part was conveyed by Mr. Mytton, 25 March, 1825, to Robert Niccolls, who, on 25 March, 1837, conveyed it also to Mr. Newcombe. Both portions were subsequently sold to Richard Gardner, on whose death they devolved on Henry Gardner * and on 2 October, 1886, the trustees of Henry Gardner conveyed the estate to Mr. William Humphreys of Shrewsbury, the present owner. The property consists of 33 acres and a house. Mr. Humphreys also owns the Bowbrook estate and cottage, containing* 32 acres, and 22 acres of land at Copthorne. Goosehill, now called Bow-Brook, is an old house, with 17 acres of land. Ferny-Goosehill adjoining also contains 17 acres. It was formerly Mytton's property, and afterwards belonged to Miss Jenkins, Admiral Jenkins, General Jenkins of Cruckton, and now to Mr. Wingfield of Onslow. It is now reputed in Bicton parish, though formerly it belonged to St. Chad's. In a Court Roll of 1392 (Curia Magna, 16 Rich. II.) Monkemole occurs as one of the Liberties of Shrewsbury ; and in the Court Books 1668-1674 Munkmeol and Gooshill are named amongst the Liberties of the Wrelsh Ward. In a Court Roll of 1592-3, under Moukemeole and Gooshill, these names occur : \u2014 John Benyon, David ap John, Roger Tidder, and Richard Gittins miln'. From the following Inquisition, dated 14 March, 1428-9, taken after the death of Reginald Mytton of Salop, it appears that he died seised in fee of (inter alia) the Manor or Grange of Moukemeole within the liberties of the town of Salop, and of two carucates of land in Monk Eo within the said liberties ; that the said Manor or Grange was worth 20 marcs per annum, and the said two carucates six marcs ; and that they were held of the King in capite ; and that William Mytton was heir, being son of Richard, who was son of the said Reginald, and was then aged 18 years; and that the said Reginald died on the 20th December, 1424 ; and that Hugh Burley of Brome crofte, received tbe rents and profits of the said Manor and lands.

In the time of Edward the Confessor it was holden by his Queen Edgithe,1 in common with the neigh bouring manors of Meole and Pulley ; and at the time of Domesday it had passed with them into the hands of Ralph de Mortimer. It was rated to the Danegeld at one hide, but there were two carucates2 of arable land. One of the tenants was a free man, and so, I suppose, of Saxon descent ; he paid 8s. a year rent for his land. There was a wood capable of fattening 20 swine.

Forster and Wm. Boerley, bailiffs of the liberty of that town, and other persons worthy of belief, and claimed on John Richardes of Crucketon, to be his neif (nativum) as pertaining to his said manor of Eggebald. The proceedings on this claim are extant in the book entitled A in the exchequer of Shrewsbury. The termination of the suit was favourable to the freedom of Richardes. The next person I find in possession of this manor is John Byest, gent., of Atcham, who at his death 30 June, 29 Elizabeth, is found to have been seised of the \" manor or lordship of the vill of Edgebold holden of the Earl of Arundel\" (Co. Es., v. 3, p. 99). On the partition of his estates between his four sisters, this place fell to the share of the eldest, Anne, wife of Edward Cludd of Orleton. At the Inquisition after her death, 44 Elizabeth, the manor is found to be holden of the bailiffs and burgesses of the town of Salop in free socage ; and such is also the finding upon the death of her son Edward, 11 Jac, and grandson Charles Cludd, 5 Car. On this last occasion it is stated to be holden of the said bailiffs by fealty alone. I believe Mr. Cludde sold it to the Rev. George Scott. [Edgebold, a township of Meole Brace, chiefly consists of two farms, called Upper Edgebold and Lower Edgebold, the property of Mrs. Scott, of Betton. The former has an old house, probably once moated. From a very early date Edgebold was in the Liberties of Shrewsbury. In the Court Rolls of 1385 and 1392 (Curia Magna, 9 and 16 Rich. II.) Eggebaldenham or Egebaldon is named. In the Court Books 1668 1674, \"Newton and Edgbold \" occurs amongst the Liberties of the"], [200, "186 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. Stone Ward.

It was since detached from Condover Hundred under the construction put by Roger de Mortimer on the Charter which he obtained from Henry III. after the Battle of Evesham ; and has since been annexed to the Liberties of Shrewsbury. Queen Edith's estate near Shrewsbury, consisting of Meole, Edgebold, and a great part of Pulley, had probably passed from her to William fitz Osborn, Earl of Hereford ; had been forfeited by his son, Earl Roger de Bretolio; in 1074 ; and had then been granted by King William I. to Ralph de Mortimer. It is probable that, in Mortimer's hands, Edgebold and a great part of Pulley became so involved in Meole, that all three Manors are occasionally described as Meole. It was found by Inqui sition, held 13 December, 1273, on the death of George lord Cantilupe, that the rent ofthe Lord of Edgebold was 8s.

The well-known quarry of excellent freestone in the hill behind the church has been worked from a very early period. Willielmus Quarriator, or the quarrier, occurs in a deed of the 13th century ; and if the name of the place contains an allusion to the same remark- able feature of the parish, it must have been used in the time of our Saxon ancestors. Gravenhul may denote the dug hill : an appellation sufficiently appro- priate to an eminence now so much frequented for materials of an excellent quality for building.1 This etymology is, however, much too uncertain to rely on : gravenhul may equally signify the tumulus, or sepulchral hill, and in this sense may have some connection with Gravel hill, near Shrewsbury, where are now no traces of any hill whatever ; or the derivation may be some- what entirely different from either of these significa- tions. Griasel is the name of a hill in Switzerland, one of those which bound the valley of Hash. (Stobbeij's Travels, vol. i., p. 106). In the Saxon times four persons of the names Levies, Godric, Se ward, and Algar held Griveleshul. This is a pleasing picture of the liberty and equality of the Saxon times. Small as was their property, for the whole was only rated at 2 hides to the Danegeld, they were all free, though two of them must have occupied jointly one of the three manors into which the whole was divided. On the Norman conquest this little knot of independent freeholders fell, in common with numbers of their brethren, to the all-powerful grasp of the Norman Earl of Shrewsbury, under whom it was holden at the time of the Domesday survey by a person 1 No strata at Grinsill, but a solid bed of stone, which may be cut out to any size.

The name of Walchelin stands at the head of the noble families of Ferrars and Maminot. But I have no reason to believe that the proprietor of Grinshill be longed to either of them. His property in Shropshire was inconsiderable, consisting merely of this manor and the distant one of Faintre, and as Payn de Faynthro, by a deed witnessed by two priests, Adam, and Richard son of Gervase, gave all his land in Griveleshul to Haghmon Abbey, I conclude that he was a descendant of this Walchelin. Certain it is that the canons of Haghmon were possessed of property here from an early period, though there is some diversity in the accounts ofthe quarter from which they first got a footing here, for in other records John Fitz Alan (the first of that name died in 1239) is stated to have given them Gryns hull or Greleshull. To the following grant I can assign no date,3 but it must be very early if the William fitz Alan who attests it was the first of that name. Ralph de Orleton con firms to Haghmon Abbey his father's grant of half a 1 [Walcheline occurs also in Domesday as Earl Roger's tenant at Faintree, near Bridgnorth.

The next deed3 which I have seen respecting this place presents the Abbey of Haghmon as possessing the lordship here. In the time of Gilbert, Abbot of Hagh mon (I suppose that Gilbert who sate from 1241 to 1253), Matthew, son of Richard de Hull of Clyve, brought an assize against that abbot, and brother Richard de Dounton, brother Stephen de Overton, brother Philip le Graunte, Richard, son of Stephen de Grileshil, William, son of Henry of the same, and three other persons, for disseising him of his common of pasture in Clive : the abbot and certain of the others plead that the said common is in Grileshull and not in Clyve, and so it is found by the jury. Wherefore it is considered that the defendants be sine die, and that 1 [Blakoway is in error here. Ralph's father was Adam de Orleton, who, before the year 1172, granted half a virgate in Grinshill to Haghmond Abbey.

In the catalogue of knight's fees in the hundred of Pimhill in 28 Edward I., the Abbot of Haughmond is stated to hold Grinshill in free alms of John fitz Alan. From the following deed it would appear that the family of Burnell had some claim here,1 for in the Haghmon Chartulary is a memorandum of a partition made between the Abbot of Haghmon and Edward Burnell of three wastes in Grileshull, called Rowne- 1 [The Buruells held half a hide, or one quarter of the Manor. In the 13th century it was held b}' the Stantons under Fitz Alan; and by the Actons of Acton-Reynold under the Stantons. This estate was usually coupled with that of Acton-Reynold, and was held in precisely the same way. In 1292 Reyner de Acton granted to Philip Burnell, a tourth part of the Manor of Grineleshull, after the death of Reyner. This occurred before 1308, when Edward Burnell, son of Philip, was in full seizin of this fourth part. A parcel of waste land in Grinsill was divisible, and on 15 Feb., 1308, was divided between the Abbot of Haghmon and Edward Burnell ; the Abbot three-fourths, and Edward Burnell one-fourth of the waste. The Burnell estates in Grinshill eventually went with Petronilla, sister of Philip Burnell, to William de Ercalewe ; and their son, William de Ercalewe, is named in the Nomina Villarum, 1316, as Lord of the vill of Acton Reyner and Grinehull.

Sir Richard de Harlegh attended as seneschall of Burnell ; the wastes were measured by the perch of 25 feet. Mention is made of the gate between the field of Grileshull and the field of Sonsawe, called Lampoorsyate. This partition was made on the morrow of St. Valentine, in the first year of King Edward, which must mean King Edward II., as it is stated to have taken place in the presence of Richard, Abbot of Haghmon, and as Edward Burnell was not born till about the 15th of Edward I., and died in the 9th of Edward II. But I believe this claim of Burnell merely arose from his possession of the neigh bouring manor of Acton Reynold, and that his preten sions to common in Grinsill were only pour cause de vicinage. The abbey continued undisputed lords, and in 13 Edward II. had a grant of free warren in their Manor of Greneleshull, as there written. The following extracts from their Chartulary respect roads and boundaries : an Inquest was made at the court of Herdewike 15 Edward III., concerning the road reach ing from the wood of Brochurst by that of Shirwode, to the wood of Acton Reyn', in order to ascertain whether it be common for all passengers either with waggons or laden horses. The jurors (Richard Gery of Acton, Wm. Wigge of Grileshulle, Jn. Tece, Wm. Swifte of Hadenhalle, and five others), say that they have always seen the same commonly used ; but they say that the bailiffs of the lords of Acton and Griles hul caused all persons carrying wood, stones, or salt, to be attacked, who made fine to those bailiffs for their passao*e, so that it appears that it is not a common highway.

I find mention of a rivulet of similar name in the Chartulary of Salop Abbey. Reyner son of Godwin grants to Salop Abbey a part of an acre lying between Wm. Kox's land and the land of the said abbey, and reaching from a mete made by our joint assent usque in rivulum qui vocatur Pintesbroc, in exchange for an orchyard (ortum) lying between the wall of the city (civitatis) of Salop and the orchyard formerly belonging to Agnes wife of Roger son of William.

By licence dated 31 Dec.. 8 Elizabeth, 1565, John and Thomas Leveson alienate land in Grinshill,, and the Manor of Hardwick and messuages and lands there, to Richard Langley and Thos. Downton, which was, however, I believe only for the creation of some trust or family settlement. From the time of the Dissolu tion, and indeed for a long time before, I have seen no mention ofa manor of Grinsill; the abbey, as appears, kept their court at Hardwick, which thence, I suppose, came to assume the name of a manor, which it had attained by the 13 Edward IL, when the religious had a grant of free warren in their manor of Herdewyke, and that manor, I understand, covers the whole parish of Grinsill. In 1637, Sir Andrew Corbet, Knt., held the Manor of Acton Reyner and the Manor of Grinshill. GREENS-HILL. (From Harleian MSS., 6826.) The whole tithes of this place are impropriated to the patron, Richard Clayton, Esq., who allows his curate _\u00a36 per annum. A bout the year 1699, Mr. Jones, late alderman of London, left a considerable sum of money for the augmentation of poor benefices, of which 1 [Cf. ante, p. 196.\u2014 Ed.]"], [208, "194 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. this church had \u00a3200, with which lands to the value of \u00a310 per ann. were bought and settled upon the minister.

The name of Hardwick denotes, I presume, its adaptation to pasturage\u2014 the wick, or residence of the herds. From Dugdale's Monas'icon, vol. ii., p. 528, it appears to have been part of the possessions of the hospital of St. John of Jerusalem, in 1185, if indeed this be the place intended. On the Dissolution we have seen it vested in the family of Leveson. In 17 Elizabeth, Walter Leveson, Esq., purchased the Manor of Hard wich, otherwise Hardwick, otherwise Hardewick,other- 1 [For the Questions, to which these are Answers, see under Albrighton, 2nd Series, Vol. I, pp. 101-2. \u2014 Ed]"], [209, "GRINSILL. 195 wise Hordwick, of John Leveson, Thomas, son and heir apparent of the said John, Robert Stauneford, Esq., John Brook, and others, by fine levied in Easter term of that year ; and in 22 Elizabeth livery of the manor was made to him. The 22nd year of Queen Elizabeth is 1579-80, yet, according to a MS. of Bowen's, who quotes original deeds, Richard Tyler had the Manor of Hardwick two years before. He had three daughters, Dorothy, Alice, and Elizabeth, the first of whom married in 1576 Wm. Whitcombe, brother of Thos. Whitcombe of Berwick Mavesyn. She had to her purparty Hardwick house and lands ; and in the settlement made upon her by her father, it is styled the farm or grange of Hardwicke, with its appurtenances in Hardwicke, Grinsill, Hadnall, and Heston, or elsewhere. Her grandson, William Whitcombe, Esq., is styled of this place in 1663. [The Manor of Hardwicke, which includes Grinshill, subsequently became vested in the Hill family. In 1781, when Grinshill was enclosed, Richard Hill, Esq, was Lord of the Manor of Hardwicke. It has since passed by purchase to the Corbet family, Sir Walter Orlando Corbet, Bart, of Acton Reynold, being the present Lord of the manor. The acreage of the parish of Grinshill is 827a. 3r. lp. The Act for enclosing Grinshill, Sansaw, and Clive was passed in 1781 ; and the Inclosure Award is dated 4 July, 1783. The chief landowners are J. J. Bibby, Esq, of Hardwicke Grange, Sir W. 0. Corbet, Bart, J. M. Kilvert, Esq, and the Wood family.] THE CHURCH. [Grinshill Chapel was originally a mere dependency of the Church of Shawbury,1 but at the same time an ancient foundation. The Chapel and a Cemetery were founded in the reigns of King Stephen or Henry II, by the Lord of the fee. Bishop Peche's fourth Charter'2 indicates Grinshill as subject to Shawbury, and shows that that prelate granted an appropriation of the mother Church and its dependencies to Haughmond Abbey. The Charter runs thus :\u2014 \"Ricardus, Dei gratia Coventrensis Episcopus &c, Noverit univer sitas vestra 'nos de espresso assensu Capituli nostri appropriasse 1 (Cf Eyton viii, 146. The other Chapels which were dependencies *f Shiwbiiry were Acton Reynold, Moreton Corbet, and Great With) ford.\u2014 Ed.] s s Bishop Pe-he was Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield from 1161 to J 182. This Charter was probably made in the last ten years of his episcopate.\u2014 Ed.]"], [210, "196 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. Mouasterio de Haghmon, et actualiter tradidisse Abbati et Monachis ejusdem, ecclesiam de Sagesbury cum omnibus capellis suis, scilicet de Acton, Grineshull, Morton, Wideford, cum omnibus pertinentiis suis in perpetuum.\" This appropriation to Haughmond Abbey was ratified by Bishop Hugh de Novant, 24 November, 1190. The present Church, dedicated to All Saints, consists of a Nave and bell turret containing one bell. The former Church was entirely taken down in 1839-40, with the exception of a portion of the west wall, and a new Church erected on the site. On the south side it was built on the old foundations. In the Church are four Monumental Tablets, three on the north wall, and one on the south. Of these, three are to members of the Wood family, aud one to the Embrey family. The tablet on the south wall commemorates the Rev. John Wood, 15 years Incumbent, and Patron, who died 18 May, 1864, aged 83; and Elizabeth his wife, who died 21 February, 1879. In the Churchyard, on the south side of the Church, is the shaft and base of a cross. There are many tombstones to the memory of the families of Wood, Kilvert, Embrey, &e. The Vicarage house was erected in 1878. The patron of the Vicarage is the Rev. John Ravenshaw Wood. The Communion Plate consists of a silver cup, paten, and flagon, the inscriptions on which are as follows : \u2014 Paten :' \" The gift of Mia Margaret Eyton to Grinshill Church 1689 Daughter of Thomas Eyton of Knowlton in Flintshire, Gent. Shee then liveing with the Lady Corbett at Acton Reynold.\" Arms : Ermine a lion rampant. Cup : \"The Gift of Mrs. Judeth Corbet 1776.\" Flagon: \"A Gift to Grinshill Church 1880.\" There is also a pewter flagon, given by Fran. Trice in 1704.

This lease was subsequently purchased"], [216, "202 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. by John Hill of Cotton. The rents were paid to the minister, the schoolmaster, aud the poor. Sir Andrew Corbet, in September, 1830, gave \u00a315 15s. to the poor of Grinshill. Amongst the estates of the Shrewsbury Free School, was a School house at Grinshill, built for the scholars to retire to in case of infec tious disorders. By the Free School Ordinances of 1577 it was provided that \" a house shall be provided within the county for the masters and scholars to resort to in time of plague.\" (History of Shrewsbury School, pp. 46, 89, 98). A site containing about two acres was purchased from William Kill vert aud Robert Emerie in 1617, during the headmastership of John Meighen, and a Schoolhouse was soon erected. In 1635 Mr. Meighen resigned his office, and received an annuity of \u00a320 and the use of the Schoolhouse at Grinshill during his life. When the plague broke out in Shrewsbury in 1649, the School was removed to Grinshill. (Gough's History of Myddle).

In 1873, the Trustees of the Free School sold the premises to Dr. Flinn ; aud they subsequently passed to H. C. Williams, and are now the property of Mr. Thomas Edwards, M.B, and called the Grange.

Hadnall is a chapel of ease to Middle, for which reason it was formerly called Hadnall's ease. It contains six townships, Hadnall, Haston, Smethe cote, Shotton, Hardwicke, and Alderton,1 for which there are five constables ; the two last townships have only one between them. Hadehelle (so it is written in Domesday) was held in the Saxon times by one Godwin ; it was then rated to the Dane-geld at four hides (480 acres). Upon the Conquest it became part of the possessions of Earl Roger de Montgomeri, and was by him granted, with sixty-seven- other manors, to Rainald, his substitute or sheriff in the earldom of Shropshire, under whom one Osmund2 held it. This gentleman kept one carucate3 in his own demesne, and parcelled out threa more, among two cowherds, six villans, a bordar, and two Frenchmen, so that the agriculture of this place had continued stationary since the imposition of the Dane geld. But the compilers of Domesday gave it as their opinion that there was as much more land capable of 1 [Alderton was a member of Middle, but was separated manorially at au early period. \u2014 Ed] 2 [Eyton suggests that Osmund may have been father of William, whose son Gilbert was lord of Hadnall in 1154.

The present number of acres is about 2,284, but at the time of Domesday there was a wood, the pannage of which they deemed sufficient to fatten forty hogs. In the reign of the Confessor this manor was valued at sixty shillings ; it had afterwards sunk to as low a value as 10s., but when the survey was made it had risen to 20s. The possessions which belonged to Rainald the Sheriff came afterwards to William the son of Alan, progenitor of the illustrious family of Fitz Alan ; but the manner in which this took place is not so certain. There seems some reason to believe that Adelina, the mother of William, was daughter and heir of Warin the bald, who is expressly called \"antecessor,\" predecessor, of Rainald in Domesday ; but whether they were brothers, or whether Rainald married Warm's widow Aimeria, the niece of Roger de Montgomeri, I cannot affirm. How ever this be, the superiority of Hadnall belonged in the reign of King Henry II. to the above-mentioned William Fitz Alan, and was holden under him by Gilbert, son of William. A Gilbert the Englishman is enumerated in the liber Niger 1 167, among the tenants of Fitz Alan, and if he was the same with our Gilbert, it is probable that William his father was son of Osmund, the immediate possessor of Hadnall in the reign of the Conqueror, who appears, from his name, to have been of Saxon origin. The son of Alan, in pious gratitude, as it should seem, for his restoration to his great estates in this county upon the accession of Henry II. , richly endowed a stately Abbey of Augustine canons at Haghmon, and his vassels became, as was natural, eager to signalize their affection for their lord, by contributing donations of land to his new monastery. They had little else to bestow ; and land was not of much value ; and as they confidently expected the end of the world with the approaching termination of the century, they were anxious to secure a future perpetuity at the expense of what was not worth many years purchase."], [223, "209 HADNALL. Gilbert of Hadenhale (or of Smethcote, or of Hard wicke \u2014 for he is called by all these names) was among the early benefactors to Haghmon. He took the opportunity of one of Henry II. 's visits to Shrewsbury \u2014 perhaps that in 1158, to surrender a moiety of the village of Hadnell and the whole of Hardwicke into the king's hands, who immediately granted the same to the canons for their maintenance.1 This mode of conveyance was probably devised by the prudent ecclesiastics for the more assurance of their title in those days of turbulence and frequent revolution. The mind of Gilbert was perhaps the more readily disposed to pay this compliment to his lord, that he had no male issue, and consequently no prospect of continuing this property in his name and family. His daughter Lettice married Nigel Banastre, and I conceive he had other daughters of whom we have no account.2 Omnibus christi fidelibus ad quos pr\u00e6sens scriptum per venerit Johannes filius Ricardi Boterel salutem in Domino sempiternam.

The family of Banistre is of French origin, though I cannot discover the etymology of their name in any term of that language, unless it be derived from Benest,1 \" a simple plaine doltish fellow, a noddipeake, a ninny hammer, a pea-goose, a coxe, a sillie companion,\" as Cotgrave expounds it ; and the improbability that any family would adopt an appellation of such contemptuous import is done away by the existence of such names as Coward, Bastard, Wittewronge, among ourselves. The name, whatever be its meaning, occurs in Tail leur's Copy of the Battle Abbey Roll, reprinted by Hollinshed ; and the authority of that disputable document is confirmed in this instance by the un questionable testimony of the Rolls of Parliament, in which one Robert Banastre claims Prestatyn in the 6th of Edward I. as fourth descendant from an ancestor of the same name, who came in with the Conqueror. (Rot. Parl. v. 1). Hence it is no improbable conjecture that the family immediately under our consideration was descended from one of the Francigen\u00e6 recorded in Domesday as occupying a part of Hadnell under Osmund \u2014 though I have no other ground than the identity of name for supposing it to be related to the claimant of Prestatyn. There was a family of the same name at Altham in Lancashire, but it seems unlikely that there was any affinity between them, for though the unusual Christian names of Adam and Lawrence occur in both lines, yet the arms were originally quite dissimilar. The Banastres of Hadnell sealed their earlier deeds with a maunch, but those of Lancashire with a sable cross. In the \" Nomina et Insignia, etc.\" \" The Names and Arms of those who fought under 1 Benest, benedictus : by a similar turn of thought to that which is known to prevail among the Turks respecting idiots."], [225, "HADNALL. 211 King Edward I.,\" edited by Mr. Rowe Moses, under the head of Lancashire we find Sir Adam Banastre bearing, de argent a une crois patee de sable, and Sir Thomas Banastre, de argent a une crois patee de sable e un label de goules, besides another Sir William Banestre, who bears a totally different coat of arms, viz., de goules a iii. cheverons de argent. The heralds of a later age taught the Banastres of Shropshire to conform their armorial bearing to that of their more distinguished namesakes of the North, one of whom was among the founders of the order of the Garter; and Mr. Anstis in his learned researches on that subject has, though without any evidence which has occurred to me, derived those of Flint, Lancashire, and Hadnell from one common origin. (Vol. i., p 153). Nigel Banastre, by his wife Lettice, the heiress or co-heiress of Hadnell (who married secondly William Hose), had issue a daughter Alice, the wife of Roger de Hauston, and a son William Banastre, who granted to Haghmon Abbey, common in his fee of Heddenhale,1 and by another deed,1 witnessed by Wido de Heden hale and others, he granted to the same canons with his body (i.e., on the condition that they should inter his body within their sacred precincts, \u2014 a privilege esteemed in those days of the highest value), his part in Hedenhale wood. He or his son of the same name is found in the Iter of Henry III. to hold three hides of land in Hadenal of the fee of John fitz Alan by the service of one knight's fee in the time of war, at the White Minster, i.e., Oswestry. In the Testa de Nevil, a record of the latter end of the same reign, it is expressed that William Banastre with his co-parceners holds half a knight's fee of John fitz Alan in Hadenhal, Hauston, Swetton (I suppose Shotten), and Smethecot. I cannot explain the cause of this diminution of service, or of its division with parceners. 1 Inter cartas Joh.

Shotton, Apr. 18th, 1811. Revd Sir, I am afraid it is not in my power to give you much useful information concerning the Ancient proprietors of the Lands at Hadnall, and the less so as I have not resided above 19 years in this county. I find none of my neighbours (who are merely tenants) know anything concerning it. It appears to me, on looking over the last valuation of this Chapelry taken in the year 1804, that Sir Jn\u00b0 Hill is the largest proprietor, and he has made some considerable purches since, it is therefore not improbable but you might gain some infor mation from that quarter. I have inclosed a schedule of the Ancient part of my Title Deeds belonging to Shotton, wherein the Name of Bannister is frequently mentioned : should there be any deed or deeds which will be of service to you you are welcome to see them. I have inclosed a curious Will thereto belonging, with a Copy of the same as far as I can render it legible, also 2 pieces of Old painted Glass taken from an Old Study or Closet Window in the Old Timber House formerly the Mansion House at Shotton, if I may so call it, which I took down, but whether any ways connected with the Subject I am not able to judge ; however some Circumstances here about certainly agrees with \"Gough's MS. Memoirs of Middle,\" viz. I have a piece of Ground about 8 acres in the front of my House, called now sometimes the Rabbit Hill, sometimes the Gorsty bank, which is seen from Shifnall, and is much elevated, I have heard that in \" Speed's Ancient Map of the County \" it s depicted with 3 Gibbits or Gallows, and we know it was"], [240, "226 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. formerly called Gallows Tree Bank, nor shall I wonder if it is so stiled in some of my earliest Deeds. Gough says that Shotton was once the Resident of a Lord Marcher, and that Bishop Rowlands, who formerly lived at Shotton, was a Lord Marcher. On pulling down the Old House I preserved the pieces of Glass observing on the larger One a Crosier, which you may yet trace, though it has since been fractured ; what the inscription is, I know not, or whether at all connected with this subject. There is another Circumstance further strengthens the supposition, the road or lane which leads from Gallows Tree Hill towards the Lea Wall, and crosses the Salop and EHesmere road at that place, is called to this very day Thieves Lane, but it stops not on reaching the Salop and EHesmere road, but is crossed and continued directly on Westward through Fitz to Montford Bridge, the greater part of which till lately has been uninclosed Common ; and if I understand Gough right, he says Montford Bridge was the Boundry between the English and Welsh, and I then presume the English Marcher had the jurisdiction from here to Mont ford Bridge. You will pardon me for troubling you with so long a detail, but I was willing you should know of such con curring circumstances, and should you think I can be of further assistance, 1 shall do it with pleasure, & am, Sir, Yrs vry Respectfully, W. Watkins. [Here follows a tracing of the painted glass, which is engraved in Owen and Blakeway's History of Shrewsbury, i. 312.

Should you, when looking over these Ancient fragments of parchment find any thing you may suppose either useful or curious to me, you will much oblige me by pointing it out, as I have but little knowledge or penetration in these old affairs. I shall be happy to hear that the documents here sent will enable you to complete that part of your undertaking.

Hadnall Moat.\u2014 South of the church, in a meadow called the Hall Yard, is a square moat filled with water, enclosing an area of 3r. 36p., called on the estate map \" Moat Bank.\" It is in good pre servation, no attempt having been made in later times to fill it up ; there are no signs of masonry above ground ; the entrance is on the north side, where the drawbridge probably stood.1 The earliest notice of a house in Hadnall is in a Patent Roll of 1 Edward III. (1327), which speaks of a Commission appointed to hear and determine a trespass committed upon Hugh de Chenyney by William le Zouge of Shrewsbury and others, who broke into Chenyney's house at Hadenhale, and carried off 240 sheep worth \u00a340, and goods and chattels to the value of \u00a3100.2 But a house evidently existed here much earlier. This moated mansion at Hadnall was long the seat of the Banaster family. They entered their Pedigree at the Visitation of Salop in 1623,3 Thomas Banaster of Hadnall, living there in 8 Henry VI. (1429-30) being the first there named ; he married Eliza, daughter of Sir Robert Corbet of Moreton Corbet. The house was a spacious mansion of chequered timber work, and fell into decay in the beginning of the 18th century. An old man who died in 1831, aged 81, remembered considerable portions still standing ; and some remains existed about 1780. * It is suggested that this was the scene of the betrayal of the Duke of Buckingham in 1483, and that the Duke was executed at Shrewsbury, and not at Salisbury, as is commonly stated.6 The moated site belonged to the Pickstock family, of Balderton, since to Mr. Hilditch of Stanton, and now to the Misses E. and A. J. Gill. The modern Hall was enlarged and altered in 1863, by the late Mr. John William Ward, who purchased the land about 1854 ; and it is now the property and residence of George Franklin Ward, Esq., who also owns the Church Farm, purchased from the late Colonel F. Hill, and other lands in Hadnall. Hardwick.6 \u2014 Edward Grant, gent., in 1726 sold Hardwick Grange to Edward Appleyard, gent., of Hadnall. After his death, it was purchased in 1740 by John Powys of Shrewsbury. William Groome (who died in 1804, aged 70), since bought Hardwick, but sold it about 1780 to the Hills. Hulbert states7 that a Mr. Littlehales sold Hardwick Grange to Sir Rowland Hill, the father of Sir Richard Hill, who devised it to his nephew Rowland, Lord Hill.

Roger Bird had an estate here, which he sold.2 The Earl of Bridgewater's Trustees owned the Haston Farm, which in 1862 they conveyed to Mr. John William Ward. The Pickstock family owned the Haston Grove Farm for over 200 years; this is now the property of Mr. G. F. Ward. About 1830, the Countess of Bridgewater, Lord Hill, and Messrs.

In 1267 William Banastre of Smethcott was fined 10s. pro veteri vasto.4 Smethcott was anciently sometimes called Shotton Smethcott, and is said to have formed one manor with Shotton.5 The manor and two farms at Smethcott came to the Groome family.

Edward Groome died unmarried, and left his farm to his nephews Edward, William, John, and Thomas (sons of John) successively in tail male. Edward Groome, junior, left two daughters, to whom he devised the farm in fee simple. The other farm belongs to John Groome, as representative of Thomas Groome.

Notes of Mr. Watkin Watkins, who died 1849, penes the present owner."], [245, "HADNALL. 231 Gallows-tree bank in Shotton, is so named, as being the place where the Welsh were summarily hung, after trial before the Lord Marcher, if caught in the act of stealing cattle from the English side.1 Alderton. \u2014 In 1195-6, Fulk fitz Warin sold Alderton to Roger de Lee, whose son Thomas de Lee succeeded to it( as did afterwards his (Thomas's) son John. In 1280-90, John de Lee gives to his brother Stephen de Lee, land in Alverton super Bylemas ; and by another deed conveys to William de Albrucceton a messuage in Alverton.2 Alderton formerly belonged to Wombridge Priory, and at the dissolution was sold to one Selman Wike, who soon parted with it to the tenants. There were three farms or tenements in this township. John Downton purchased Alderton Hall, and was succeeded by his son Thomas, who was bailiff of Middle, and married Elizabeth Marsh, by whom he had a son John. This second John Downton married twice, and was succeeded by his son Thomas. On Thomas's death, the property came to his son John Downton, who, in conjunction with his son Thomas, sold Alderton Hall to Philip Cotton.3 Walter Amas, a Herefordshire man, had a second farm here, long called Ames' tenement. He was succeeded by his son Thomas Ames, and he by his son Robert, and he by his son William. William Ames was often Churchwarden of Middle, and married Julian, sister of Sir Gerard Eaton ; and was succeeded by his son Robert Ames, who died in March, 1702, aged 93. William Ames, Robert's eldest son, succeeded his father ; he married Elizabeth, daughter of Adam Crosse of Yorton, and settled his lands on his younger daughter Martha, wife of Edward Jenks.4 William Downton owned the third farm in Alderton. He was succeeded by his son Samuel, and he by his son Thomas, who sold the reversion of his property here to Rowland Muckleston of Meriton. Rowland married three wives ; by the first wife he left a son Edward Muckleston and two daughters.6 Alderton has since belonged to various owners ; about 1830 to Mr. Thomas Minor, Mrs. Elizabeth Corbett, Mrs. Elizabeth Shingler, and Mr. Spencer Dickin ; and is now the property of Messrs. John M. Kilvert, William Teece's representatives, Thomas Pitchford, and G. Thorniley. In 1580, John Dounton, John Dounton his son, George Dounton, Thomas Dounton, George Dounton, and Thomas Amyes, all of Alderton, are named in the list of trained soldiers of Shropshire.6 John Wingfield, gent., was living at Aldertou in 1660, and was one of the Shropshire adherents to the Parliamentarian party who signed the declaration of loyalty to Charles II. , and accepted the royal pardon, in that year.7 \u2014 Ed.] 1 Gough 's Middle, 26-7, 64. - Eyton, x., 78-80. 3 Gough's Middle, 137-9. 4 Gough's Middle, 130-2. 5 Ibid, 125-7. 0 S.

[Hadnall, with all its manorial members, was in the Parish of Middle ; and the Chapel, whenever founded, was subject to the Chureh'of Middle. The Valor Eccles. of 1 535 shows Hadnall Chapel as supported by a pension of 40s., payable by the Rector of Middle.1 It is a chapel of ease to Middle, says Gough,2 as appears :\u2014 \" First, because no other persons have any seats or kneelings within this chappel, save only the inhabitants of Hadnall's Ease. Seoondly, because there is no allowance or maintenance for a minister there, save only what is given as of free gift. Thirdly, beoause the inhabi tants of Hadnall's Ease do maintain and repair this chappel at their own proper charges, and yet they doe pay Leawans to the church wardens of Myddle for the repairing of the parish church.\" The inhabitants of Hadnall tried several times to get an allowance for the maintenance of their Minister, and also to have seats allotted in Middle Church, but ineffectually. In 1693 they petitioned Dr. Lloyd, then Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, to order the Incumbent of Middle to provide a Curate for Hadnall, or to make a reasonable allowance for his maintenance. In this petition they state that, being 30 families and 3 miles distant from Middle, they maintain Hadnall chapel at their own cost, and contribute one-fourth part towards the maintenance of Middle Church, yet have no seats therein. The Bishop, in his answer dated 21st August, 1693, states that the rectors of Middle never paid anything towards a curate for Hadnall, but the present rector gives voluntarily \u00a35 a year ; and as concerning the seats in Middle Church, it seems reasonable they should have seats, but they should have been claimed when the seats were first disposed of, for now prescription is against them.3 In the Gentleman's Magazine1 for 1812 is an engraving of \"Hadnall Chapel, S.E., by D. Parkes, Del. 1794;\" and a short account by him, in which the Church is described as consisting of a middle aisle and chancel, with a circular stone font of considerable antiquity at the west end. On four shields, at the ends of brackets which support the roof, are the letters T.D., I.D., and 1699, and on the fourth shield a chevron between 10 crosses patee 6 and 4. A small wooden turret at the west end contains one bell. The east window had formerly stained glass, and contained several coats of arms, including St. George, Strange, Banne3ter, Corbett, Hussey, and Bannester impaling Breton. The Chapel had a right of sepulture in 1808, when the ground was consecrated. The Church now consists of a western tower (recent), nave with south porch and blocked north door, new chancel, and new font. Since Parkes wrote his account, the Church has been restored, the nave in 1872, and a new chancel built in 1874, at the cost of \u00a31,060. 1 Cf. Eyton, x., 50-1. 2 Gough's Middle, 1700, edit. 1875, p. 12. 3 Ibid, pp. 13, 14. \u00ab Qent. Mag., 1812, Supplement to vol. Ixxxii., part i\u201e pp. 609, 610."], [247, "233 HADNALL. The west gallery was then taken down. The tower was built by Lord Hill. Prior to 1874, there was a nave only, and no proper chancel, and the roof was all one pace ; but when the new chancel was built, the east window of the nave was taken down, and placed at the end of the new chancel. The glass, containing the Arms of Corbett, Horseman, Brownlow, Hill, Bayley, and Dymock, was then taken out of the east window, and placed in the west window of the tower. A new roof was erected in 1884. The Nave, of ashlar work, has no very marked character. At its angles are low thick buttresses, set at right angles, round which was plain basement moulding. On the south side is a late decorated window (circa 1390). At the south east corner of the nave is a recess, with an ogee head. The north and south doors are of late Norman work, perhaps 1140-50, with the pointed bowtel as the principal distinctive moulding. The arches are round. The north door is blocked. There are traces of a priest's door, now in a window, on the north side. On certain stones on tbe north side are marks as if used for sharpening arrow-heads. The present font, from Malta, was given by Frank Bibby, Esq., in March, 1880. The old font went to Astley. There is a monument in the Church to Rowland, first Viscount Hill, who died Dec. 10th, 1842, in his 71st year; in the centre is a lion and the arms of Hill, on either side figures of a soldier and a shepherd. The Hill vault is beneath the tower. The stained glass in the east window, represent ing the adoration of saints in heaven, was put in by the children of Mrs. Esther Peel in 1888. The glass in the south chancel window, representing S. Mary Magdalene, is in memory of Richard Battye of Skelton Hall, who died at Middle, 23rd Sept., 1873. Another window was inserted by Mr. Bibby's family, in memory of their nurse, Mary Ann Challenger, in 1881. In the Tower are two Benefaction Boards. The Communion Plate consists of a silver Cup, Paten, and Flagon, given in 1833 by Major Thomas Bayley of the Black Birches. Mr. Charles Hulbert gave the Communion Table, which formerly belonged to St. Julian's, Salop. The Church is dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene, and is in the patronage of the Rector of Middle. It is endowed with a farm of 33a. 3r, 12p. in the parish of Criggion, and lr. 36p. of glebe. There is no Vicarage house. Hadnall was formed into a separate ecclesias tical parish from Middle in 1856, with the townships of Hadnall, Hardwick, Haston, and Smethcote. Shotton and Alderton remain ecclesiastically in Middle. The tithes of Hadnall belong to the Rector of Middle.

HADNALL CHARITIES. [Lady Mary Hill, by Will in 1787, left money to build a school at Hadnall, and \u00a3300 to maintain the same ; also to clothe poor children ; and for the support of a dissenting (congregational) preacher at Hadnall. The total amount was about \u00a31,700. This charity includes \u00a3300 7s. 6d. Consols, for the School; \u00a3342 6s. lOd. Consols, for clothing poor children ; and \u00a398 15s. 3d. Consols, given at the discretion of the minister of Hadnall. \u25a0 \u2014 Watkins gave \u00a315 for the poor ; and Sir Andrew Corbet, in 1820, gave \u00a310 for the poor. Francis Henry, Earl of Bridgewater, by Will in 1828, left \u00a32,000 to be invested, and the dividends expended by tbe rector of Middle amongst the poor of Middle aud Hadnall. Of these dividends, \u00a315 annually goes to Hadnall poor. Two Benefaction Tables in the Church record these charities ; as also the improvement of the church in 1841-2 by subscriptions amounting to \u00a3885 ; the reseating of the Church, and removal of the gallery in 1872, at the cost of \u00a3379 14s. 8d. ; and the addition of new Chancel and Vestry, and the tower thrown into the church in 1874-5, at the cost of \u00a3680 18s. 2d. ; the total cost beirig \u00a31,060 7s. lOd. Mrs. Mary Cotton, late Watkins, of Shotton, iu 1697 left a bene faction of \u00a35 to the poor of Middle. William Watkins, of Shotton, her son, gave \u00a35 ; and Mary Mason, his sister, also gave \u00a35 to the poor of Middle. The Rev. Thomas Watkins, of the Isle of Ely, Cambs., left \u00a320 ; and Richard Watkins left \u00a330 to the poor of Middle. In 1744, Mrs. Elizabeth Vaughan, of Shrewsbury, widow, daughter of John and Elizabeth Downton, of Alderton, gave a Silver Salver to Middle Church, to be used at the Communion. There is a Monument in Middle Church to Richard Watkins of Shotton, late of Prescott, with these Arms thereon : \u2014 Azure, a fesse between three leopards' faces jessant-de-lis or. In 1594, an agreement was made between Middle and Hadnall's Ease, that the Wardens of Hadnall's Ease should pay a fourth part of all the charges belonging to the parish Church of Middle (bread and wine for the Sacrament excepted) on Easter Monday ; and the Wardens of Middle were to spend upon them, at the payment of this money, 2s. yearly, let the Leawn be little or much. \u2014 Ed.]"], [257, "HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY HUNDRED OR LIBERTIES. By the late Rev. JOHN BRICKDALE BLAKEWAY, M.A., F.S.A. HANWOOD. The name of Hanwood I should be inclined to derive from the woodcocks which we may conceive to have formerly abounded in its woods. Han is, at least, a cock in all the dialects of the Teutonic language, \u2014 the Gothick, Saxon, Francick, and German. In the Salick laws, quoted by Wachter, it is written with a strong aspirate chana. In the gospels of Ulphilas, immediately the cock crew, Matt. xxvi. 74, is Yah suns Hana hrukida, and soon Hen crowed. Hanwood had attained a very great comparative extent of cultivation at a very early period, for it was assessed to the Danegeld at two hides. In the time of the Confessor it was the property of one Edic, a free man \u2014 undoubtedly an error of the scribe for Edric \u2014 the noted Edric the Wild ; for the name Edic occurs nowhere else in the Shropshire part of Domesday. In that ancient record it is written Hanewde, and is comprised under the Hundred of Ruesset, nearly co extensive with the modern one of Ford. The manor then contained three carucates1 (340 acres) of land, and the Norman commissioners were of opinion that there was room for another carucate.1 The modern contents of this small parish are, I am informed, exactly 420 1 [Not carucates, but ox-teams. Domesday, so. 255b. \u2014 Ed.]"], [258, "244 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. acres. In the revolt of Edric the Wild and the Mercian earls, the Conqueror granted Hanewde with the rest of their vast possessions, to his favourite, Roger de Montgomeri, Earl of Shrewsbury, who gave this and 23 other manors to one of his chief adherents, Roger, one of two brothers, sons of Corbet, a noble Norman, as he is called, who accompanied the Earl into England. Roger, the immediate lord of Hanewde, retained half a carucate in his demesne, and parcelled out the remaining two carucates and a half between five servants, three villans, and two bordars. It was valued in the time of the Confessor at ten shillings, and it retained the same valuation at the compilation of Domesday. The Corbet family continued to hold the superiority of this manor for many centuries ; but it seems to have had an inferior or mesne lord at a very early period.1 These mesne lords took their rise from the practice of sub-infeudation. A person held his land freely, i.e., by free service, such service as befitted a gentleman, under a superior lord ; he granted some of it to other persons (at least two in number) to hold of him freely, and thereupon he called himself lord of his land. This was, no doubt, the way in which John and Reginald became lords of Hanwood. This practice was restrained by the statute Quia emptores, which ordained that in future all purchasers of lands should hold them not of the vendor, but of the superior lord ; and since that statute no new manor, as it should seem, can be created. John de Hanewode occurs in the Liber Niger 1167, In the Iter of Henry III. Reginald de Hanewood is mentioned as holding two hides in Hanewood, in the hundred of Ford, of the barony of Caus. On the Pipe 1 [Eyton thinks that Roger fitz Corbet made an early feoffment of Hanwood to Reinald de Henewode, who witnessed Roger's grant of Winsley to Shrewsbury Abbey between 1121 and 1136. Robert de Hanwood attests Charters of Robert Corbet of Caus between 1203 and 1220. The Iter, or Hundred-Roll, is of the year 1255. Cf. Eyton, vol. vii., pp. 117, 118.\u2014 Ed.]"], [259, "HANWOOD. 245 Rolls of the 43rd of that king (1259) he is fouud to owe half a mark of gold, pro respectu militie ; i.e., for licence to be excused taking upon him the honourable but costly dignity of knighthood. He attests a deed of Roger de Horton to Waryn de Andeslowe (ancestor ofthe ancient family of Waring) dated in the 12th of King Edward (Edward the first) by tbe title of Reginald lord of Hanewode. John, lord of Hanewde, occurs in 1288. It must, I presume, have been a son of his, bearing the same name with his grandfather Reginald,1 who is found by the record entitled Nomina Villarum compiled in 9 Edw. II., to hold this manor, at which time also it was included within the hundred of Ford. In 28 Edw. I.

Cf. Eyton vii. 118, 119.\u2014 Ed.]"], [260, "246 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES, By the 21st of Edward III. this family appears to have become extinct in the male line, for by Inquisition of that year, taken after the death of Beatrice Corbet, it is found that John de Ley borne, knt., and Sibilla de Hanewode hold half a knight's fee in Hanewode and Wallop of the said Beatrice. She was relict of the last Baron of Caus of the Corbet family, and re-married to Sir John Ley borne of Berwick Ley borne, who therefore held this land in her right, but Sibilla de Hanewode was, I suppose, daughter of the Reginald mentioned above. In a list of the fees whereof Edmund, Earl of Stafford (the representative of the family of Corbet of Caus), died seised 21 July, 4 Hen. IV. (the fatal fight of Battlefield), mention is made of two parts of one knight's fee in Hanewodd, which Richard Pastor of Newport and his parceners hold , and which were valued by the year at 30s. This Pastour was also Rector of the church of Hanewode, and occurs in that quality in 21 Richard II. and 29 Hen. VI., an interval of not less than fifty -four years,1 and yet not, I presume, the whole term of his incumbency, as it is little likely that the two deeds in which I have found him so described should respectively coincide with the years of his insti tution and death. There seems reason, however, to believe that he did not long survive the last of these dates, and that his property went to the family of Malehurst, for I find a deed (inter cart. Joh. Corbet de Sundorn arm.), dated the 31st of Hen. VI., whereby Thomas Forster of Salop, Esq., and Hugh Dekon of Paynston, release to Agnes Malehurst, widow of William Malehurst of Hannewode, for the term of her life all the claim they (Forster and Dekon) have in all the lands of the said William Malehurst in Hannewode 1 I apprehend there must have been two individuals of the same names, for we have an account of the murder of Richard Pastour chaplain in 2 Hen. V. See Astley. [See Transactions, 2nd Series I. 121.\u2014 Ed.]"], [261, "HANWOOD. 247 and Newport, which they had of his gift. The deed is witnessed by William Spencer of Witton, John Betton of Monford, John Mynton of Westbury, Thomas Skyr mynston of Wodehall, and others. Forster and the other were therefore feoffees of Malehurst, and as he enjoyed property both in Hanwood and Newport, and as Pastor the proprietor of Hanwood is also styled of Newport, it is no improbable conjecture that the land which was his became upon his death the property of William Malehurst. In the Suit-rolls of Caurs, as it is then written, 14 Edw. IV., the suitors of Hanwood are stated to have made fine with the lord for their suit until Michaelmas. In the Inquisitions ad quod damnum of 9 Hen. V. it is found that Richard, son of Reginald de Mutton of Salop, chivalar, died seised of certain lands &c. with the appurtenances in Salop, Bolnham (qu. Colnham), and Wodehous, within the parish of Hanwood. William Skyrmaston of Woodhall occurs 1 Rich. III. Whether any part of the above property of William Malehurst was the lands of John Wythyford, gentleman, of Shifnall, 1 cannot say, but towards the close of the fifteenth century lands here belonged to John Wythy ford, and descended to his son and heir Thomas, bailiff of Shrewsbury in 1503 and 1508. Alice, tho wife of this last, married secondly Adam Mytton, bailiff no less than seven times between 1523 and 1552, in the last of which years he was a knight, and in the year following one of the Council of Wales. But the re version of the Wythyford property here descended to Thomas Prowde of Sutton, in co. Salop, yoman, and Richard Prowde, mercer; for they, on the 19th of August, 20 Hen. VIII., in consideration of the sum of \u00a3115, bargain and sell to Nicholas Leveson, marchaunte of the Stapull of Caleys, and his heirs for ever, in consideration of the sum of _\u00a3115, the reversion and fee simple of the manor of Paynston, and of all such lands, tenements, and hereditaments in Shrewsbury, Paynston, Woodhouse, Muche Hanwoode,"], [262, "248 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. and Lytyll Hanwoode, or elsewhere, in ye county of Salop, which were some time Thomas Wythyford, son and heir of John Wythyford, and now holden by Adam Mytton, gentyllman, and Alys, his wife, relict ofthe said Thomas Wythyford, for term of her life. Mr. Leveson was maternal ancestor of the Marquis of Stafford. The property thus described continued but few years in his possession, for on ye morrow of All Souls, 29 Henry VIII., a fine was levied of the manor of Paynston and 6 messuages, 800 acres of land, 100 of meadow, 300 of pasture, and 100 of wood in Shrews bury, Paynston, Great and Little Hanwoode, and Woodhouse, Thomas Hosier and Alice, his wife, com plainants, and Nicholas Lewson (so it is there written) deforciant. The deforciant of course acknowledges the premises to be the right of the complainants, and further warrants them against Thomas, Abbot of the Monastery of SS. Peter and Paul of Salop, and his successors : the consideration of the fine was \u00a3200 sterling. Richard Prynce, of Monks Foriate, Esq., Nicholas Gibbons of Shrewsbury, gent., Thomas Hosier, gent., Hugh Modlycott, Johane, his wife, and Robert Phelips and Katharin, his wife, conveyed to William Jones of Shrewsbury, draper, and Richard Styrcheley, the Woodhouse, in co, Salop, near to Great Hanwood, within the liberties of Shrewsbury, and all lands in the Woodhouse, Great Hanwood, Paynston, Longden, and Little Hanwood, which late were the lands of Edward Hosyer, Esq., deceased, and then or late before were in the tenure, ferme, or occupation of ye said Robert and Katharin Phelips, To Have and To Hold to the said Jones and Styrcheley, to the use of Prynce and Gibbons. By deed 1 Aug., 29 Eliz., Prynce and Gibbons reciting that the above premises (inter alia) were purchased with Prynce's money alone, reciting also the love they bear to Richard Colfoxe and Richard Crosse, the nephews of Prynce, agree to convey the same (inter"], [263, "HANWOOD. 249 alia) to Thomas Hoorde of Hoordes Park, Esq., and the aforesaid William Jones to the use and behoof of Prynce and Gibbons during the life of Prynce, and after his death to the use of his executors (for the pay ment of his debts and legacies) for so many years as he shall appoint by will, and then to the use of the heirs of his body, and in default of such issue, remainder to Colfoxe in tail, like remainder to his brother, Andrew Colfoxe, like remainder to Crosse, like remainder to Anne, sister of Prynce, and the heirs male of her body, by Leonard Chambre, her husband, remainder to her right heirs. Edward Hosier, Esq., here mentioned, was eldest son of Thomas and Alice, the purchasers of these estates, and his daughter and heir married John Draycot, Esq., who, or a descendant of the same names, is stated to have sold them in 1621 to Thomas Berrington of Moat Hall, but as they appear to have been so many years earlier the property of Mr. Prynce by conveyance from the Hosiers, it appears that Mr. Berrington must derive his title from Prynce or his trustees, and that Draycot's conveyance of 1621 was merely a confirmation of that former title. On 14 Oct., 17 Eliz., John Whyttesbye of the Bryen pytts, co.

[Hanwood Chapel was propably subject to Pontesbury, though no record of its dependence exists. In the Taxation of 129 1 it occurs in Pontesbury Deanery, and was valued at _\u00a34 6s. Sd. per annum, as also in the Inquisition of the Ninth in 1341. In the Valor of 1534-5, it was worth \u00a32 6s, 8d. per annum in glebe and tithes.1 The Church of St. Thomas is a modern erection of brick in the early English stjle, and consists of chancel, nave, north porch, western belfry with three bells, and new organ-chamber on the north side. The Parish Register states, under the year 1701, \"The new erected church finished y* year \" ; but very little of this building remains, the present one being mainly rebuilt and restored in 1856. The east window*, representing St. Peter with the keys, was given by H. de Grey Warter, Esq. The ancient font is preserved in the church.2 A stone outside has the inscription \"A.D. 1701,\" and evidently marks the date of the erection of the church prior to its restoration in 1856.

[Harlescot was probably included in Rainold the sheriff's manor of Albright Hussey, then Abretone, at the Domesday Survey ; and in 1165 was held by Walter Hosatus, or Hussey, under the Barony of Fitzalan.

While some repairs wore being made in Harlescott House in 1892, several old oak beams were discovered, which had been used at some time for a half-timbered building, and which were probably brought from the older house that stood within the moat.1 It was found in 1417 that Sir John Massey lay dead in the vill of Harlescote, he having treasonably raised insurrection with armed men against Henry, late King of England, and was killed at the battle of Bolefeld (Battlefield).2 This would, probably, be at the old house that stood within the moat. Harlescott House, or The Moat, with the adjoining lands, at a later date belonged to the Lloyds of Leaton Knolls. On the death, on 24 April, 1764, of Edward Lloyd of Leaton, Esq., who was High Sheriff of Co. Salop in 1727, and married Susanna, daughter and heiress of Peter Scarlett of Hogstow, the Harlescott estate came to his second son, Scarlett Lloyd of Fitz, in fee tail. Scarlett Lloyd married for his third wife, Martha Denston, and died in 1790, having had by her a daughter, Susanna Lloyd, who succeeded to the Harlescott estate, and married Captain Edward Parry ; and their eldest son, Scarlett Lloyd Parry, barred the entail, and eventually sold the estate to Mr. Haworth, who devised it to his brother, Mr. Hargreave Haworth of Green Hill, Bacup, the present owner of the Harlescott House or Moat estate. The Harlescott Farm estate, now occupied by Mr. Barber, belonged to the Corbet family of Sundorne, and descended in the same way as the Albright Hussey estate to the late Rev. John Dryden Corbet,3 on whose death it came to his brother, the Rev. George Corbet, M.A., of Sundorne Castle, rector of Upton Magna, and Prebendary of Lichfield, the present owner of the Harlescott Farm estate, and lord of the manor of Harlescott. This and the Moat estate are each partly in St. Mary's and partly in St. Alkmund's parishes. It is not easy to trace the devolution of the great tithes and other property held by the four religious houses up to the 16th century. The present Impropriator is Mrs. Eyke of Belvidere ; but which of the religious houses she represents as tithe-owner, we do not know. Tithes on part of the land in Harlescott are also paid to the Vicar of St. Alkmund's. In Morris's MSS.

After the Conquest it devolved to Earl Roger, under whom it was holden by one Anschitil, whose name only occurs in this one instance in our Shropshire Domes dav. It was then two carucates.2 J From Anschitil descended the lords of this manor, who took their name3 from it, for their service of castle ward was found by the jurors in 3 Edw.

I do not find any further mention of this place before the Testa de Nevill 12 and 13 John, wherein it is re corded that Adam de Leton held his land by eight days' castle ward at Shrewsbury with his cross bow, upon his own charges ; if his attendance upon that service was required for any greater length of time, his 1 Leaton Manor occurs in St. Mary's Parish Books, 1673. 2 [Not carucates, but ox-teams.

Roger was succeeded by Adam, a son. The feodary or Hundred roll of Shrewsbury, temp. Ed. I., relates that on Adam's death the eschea tor took the vill of Leton into the King's hands, anno primo Edw.

Roger de Hanstone had purchased this marriage, valued at \u00a33 6s. 8d., from John fitz Aer the escheator, bat the young gentleman, it appears, had thought fit to chuse for himself. His grandmother, Petronilla, had done the same thing before him ; after her husband Roger's death she married without leave Elias de Stoke ; but she was again a widow at the time of the last mentioned Hundred Roll. In a subsequent part of the same record his tenure is stated. His service of castle ward had been extended to fifteen days, and the last was reckoned at one hide. But the King's eschaetor had compounded with him for the service by an annual rent of 40d. In 2 Ed. II.

At the time of Domesday it was in the Hundred of Recordine, and was part of the property of the See of Lichfield, under which it was holden by one Wigot. It was rated at one hide, but there were two carucates1 (or 240 acres) in tillage, one whereof was demesne land or occupied by the owner, Wigot, who kept there two servants ; the other carucate was occupied by two villans. The whole was then valued at eight shillings, which was also the value of it in th-3 time of the Confessor. The present admeasurement of this estate amounts to 312 acres, as I am informed,2 but as this includes every kind of land, wood, arable and pasture, and the Domesday carucata referred only to arable, it was then, in all probability, in as full a state of cultivation as at present, if its extent is now equal to what it was then. Wigot seems to have been a Norman,3 since his name does not occur among the landholders of Shropshire in the Confessor's time. He also bore the name of Azo, and under that name alone appears as the sub-tenant of Berrington and some other manors.

IV, Robert Burton of the Court of York* is stated to have continued \" with the king our sovereign lord and Comes of Guij in all his wars,\" in reward for which services the said herald makes him a grant of arms, viz., party per pale azure and purple, a cross engrailed or. between four white roses, in manifest 1 An Alexander Grey, chaplain, presents in 1475 to Bourton on Dunsmore, Warwickshire. 2 [Eyton notes that the Burtons were seated at Longner long before any extant account of that family would lead us to suppose, and probably held it under the Haughtons and their successors the Greys. A deed is preserved at Longner dated 28 May, 1346, by which Edward Burton of Longner, gives to Thomas Cresset of Leighton, an acre of land at Garmeston in exchange for 1| acres there. This deed mentions adjacent lands of Edward Burton. Cf. Eyton viii., 210. \u2014 Ed.] 3 William Burton, the antiquary, appears to have been of the same opinion. \"The Burtons were of Shropshire,\" says he. 4 It has been thought to be an error of the transcript for the \"counte\" (i.e., county) of York. But the household establishment of the great Richard, Duke of York, who aspired to the Crown in the reign of Henry VI., may have been so called."], [301, "287 LONGNEB. allusion to that distinguishing badge of the House of York. The words Gomes of Gv.ij have no apparent meaning, and as the original of the grant is not to be found, it is necessary to have resource to conjecture. I shall state what seems to me most probable. Among the most valiant partisans on the side of Edward IV. was his step-son Thomas de Grey (son of Sir John Grey of Groby, by Elizabeth Wydville, afterwards the consorc of that monarch). He was in high favour with his royal father-in-law, by whom he was successively raised to the dignities of Earl of Huntingdon and Marquis of Dorset, and it cannot be thought improbable that Mr. Burton, a warm adherent of the same party, and a servant in the royal household, for he appears in the same year, 1478, as one of the yeomen ushers, should have served in a military capacity under this Thomas of Grey, who may therefore be the person intended by the unintelligible expression \" Comes of Guij\" in the grant before us ; or that Grey, if the estate at Longner de volved upon him from its former possessors of the same name, should reward the services of this his faithful follower, by a liberal donation of this nature. (See the History of Shrewsbury, sub. ann. 1475). Will. Burton adds that the Burtons were \" a family, sometime, for no ordinary relations, not to be mentioned in the place, very gratious with the several princes of the royal house of York,\" an expression which seems to allude to a tradition of their being descended from Lionel, Duke of Clarence, by the wife of one Musard. Musard is said to have been the original name of Burton of Burton Constable ; and the said Duke of Clarence in his will 3 Oct., 1368, has a legacy to Sir Richard Musard, Knight, of a golden belt and a war-horse, called Maun geneleyn (perhaps monn geneteyn, my gennei). Royal Wills, p. 88. But whether these are sufficient grounds on which to erect a royal genealogy must be left to the consideration of the reader. In Harl. MSS. 5848, on a loose paper in an old hand is the following : \u2014"], [302, "HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. 288 In an old booke of Yorkshire.

VII.\" In an old pedigree in an ever present hand states Edward Burton to have married a daughter of Henry Grey, Esq. Thomas Grey, Marquis of Dorset, was among the noblemen who accompanied Henry VIII. in 1520 in his famous interview with Francis I. (See Gent. Mag., 1777; Harl. MSS. 642, p. 169). [In another hand]. If the suggestion of this antiquary be correct, that before the Burtons became possessed of Longnor they were seated at \" Burton in the same county,\" it seems probable that they lived at what is now called Boreton, in the parish of Condover, as there is no doubt of this place being in their possession, and so late as 1615, Edward Burton sold Burton manor and Cantlop to Sir Roger Owen of Condover. We find (MS. at Sundorn) Walter de Burton witness to a deed 10 Edw. II. (1317), for conveying messuage and lands in Cantilop. Edmund de Burghton (MS. at Condover) has a grant of Cantilhop from his wife's brother, William son of Hugh de la Hulle 36 Ed. III. (1363). Hugh de Burton (MS. at Sundorn) is mentioned in deed without date, witnessed by Hugh de Wlonkeslow, and John de Burton is mentioned as son of Hugh in the above deed. Halwell, in the Hundred of Clifton, three miles from Hitchen, Herts, on the attainder of Sir Robert Belknup, J.C.P., in 1392 was granted to John Burton and others. (Lyson's Magna Brit., Bed-"], [303, "289 LONGNER. fordshire, v. i., p. 95). This seems to be a Shropshire Burton, as it passed immediately afterwards to the Foresters and Baldwin Leighton, Esq., who in 1765 sold it. William Burton was M.P. for Shrewsbury 2 Rich. II. , 1379 (Owen's Hist. Shrewsbury), Richard de Beorton, Do. 4 Rich. II. , 1381, Wm. Burton Do. 6, 7, and 8 Rich. II. , and Wm. Burton ditto 14 and 20 Hen. VI., 1436-1442. The Heralds have given in their pedigrees to this Robert, whom they, without any authority that I have seen, call Sir Ptobert, a father Sir Edward, whom they style of Longner, and whom they state to have been with King Edward IV. successful in fourteen set battles, and to have been made knight banneret under the royal standard in the field A.D. 1460, and this account is adopted as authentic by the learned editor of Anto ninus, William Burton, a descendant of this family, if indeed it has not been borrowed from what he writes in that work. But, besides that it would be very difficult, I believe, to point out 14 set battles in which that prince was engaged, it must be utterly incredible to anyone who will peruse the grant above referred to, that, if there had been any foundation for such a story, the king of arms in 1478, anxious as he evidently is to exalt the character of Robert Burton, and to display his just pretensions to that distinction, would have omitted all mention of his illustrious father, graced with the rare title of knight banneret, and whose memory, even if he died in the year of his creation, could not have been effaced by the lapse of 1 8 years. In a valuable MS. of grants in the reigns of Edw. V. and Rich, III. (Harl. MSS. 433, p. 38b) is this entry in the first year of the last-mentioned king: \u2014 \" To Edward Burton the king hath confirmed such graunte as he had from the fee of the Corone of king E. the iiijth for terme ofhislyff.\""], [304, "HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. 290 As Robert Burton was already, five years before this grant, of mature years, and the acquirer of armorial distinction, the Edward Burton of the above grant was, I suppose, his son, of whom below. In the same MS., p. 46b, is a grant from Richard IIT. to Robert Burton of estates in Yorkshire, but I have no proof of his identity with the probable possessor of Longner. Robert Burton then I conceive to have been the first of his family settled at this place,1 and even for this I have no distinct evidence ; but from an abstract of the deeds of the family drawn up by Thomas Burton, an eminent lawyer in the latter end of the 17th century, I learn that Edward Burton, the son of Robert, was certainly possessed of it, and conveyed it to Geoffrey, Bishop of Lichfield, John Bretenor, and others, as trustees for certain purposes. No date is assigned to this transaction, which must have taken place between 1503, when Geoffrey Blythe, Dean of York, was appointed to the See of Lichfield, and 1524, the date of Edward Burton's death. The Heralds have also chosen to dignify this gentleman with the order of knighthood, and to entitle him of Rhodes, of the rolls, or of the robes to King Henry VII. It is probable that he might be an officer in the wardrobe of that monarch, but that he was a knight of Rhodes or any knight at all is effectually disproved by his epitaph still to be seen in Atcham Church, to which it was removed from St. Chad's on the fall of that edifice, and which runs thus : \u2014 Hie jacent corpora Edwardi Burton & Jocose uxoris ejus : qui quidem Edward' obiit in festo S'c'i Georgii xxiii die aprilis anno d'ni mcccccxxiiii & p'dicta Jocosa obiit . . die mensis . , anno d'ni M'-'cccc . . . Quorum a'i'abz, &c. Here we see he is mentioned without any addition of dignity, and he is dressed in a gown with long sleeves, 1 [This is a mistake, as Edward Burton was living at Longner in 1346. See footnote 2 on page 384 ante. \u2014 Ed.]"], [305, "LONGNER. 291 instead of the helmet and plate armour in which he would have been represented as a knight, and his true rank is further evinced by the following extract from the ancient chronicle of Shrewsbury, entitled Taylor's MS.: \u2014 \"This year, 1524, and the xxiijth of April dyscessyd Master Edward Burtoon, gentilman, & lyethe in S4 Chadds churche within Sfc Gorgy's chappell there.\"1 Mr. Burton was, however, evidently a person of con sequence in his county, and in a pleading in the entries of Lord Coke (173) occurs as a feoffee of Edward Banastre of Hadnall, in the time of Henry VII., by the title of Edward Burton, Esquire, with Robert Suny and Henry Eyton, to all of whom he appears to have been related by marriage, and he is mentioned with the same addition in a deed of Sir Edward Smythe's in the 7th of Henry VIII. The interesting, and somewhat romantic history of the death of his grandson and namesake, a favourer of the principles of the reformation in the days of Queen Mary, appears not to have been known to John Fox the martyrologist, the diligent collector of such anec dotes, but was traditionally preserved in the family, and is related by his descendant, the commentator on Antoninus's Itinerary. His known attachment to the \"new religion,\" as it was then called, had exposed him to much danger during that time of fierce persecution, and the expedients which he adopted to avoid the pursuit of his enemies would, doubtless, afford matter for a curious and enter taining relation : but they are coldly dismissed by the commentator, under the general expressions of the \" manv waies and courses he took for his safety, and to evade the hands of such as lay in wait for him, too long to be told here.\" 1 This is the only notice I have seen of a Chapel of St. George in the Church of St. Chad. I suspect, therefore, that it has arisen from a mistake of thc chronicler derived from the mention in Mr. Burton's epitaph of the festival of St. George. [This tomb of Edward Burton and Joyce is engraved in Owen and Blakeway's History, h., 231.\u2014 Ed]"], [306, "292 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. The anxiety of the whole nation during the progress of that disease which carried off Queen Mary may be easily conceived. Her dislike of her sister's person and religion, and the danger to which the princess was exposed during that reign, wrought the hopes and fears of both Papists and Protestants to the highest pitch, and these feelings, in the case of Mr. Burton, must have been still more excited by a sense of his own personal hazard. It is no wonder, therefore, that \" sitting one day alone in his upper parlour at Longner, in meditation of God's deliverances of his people, and hearing a general ring of all the bells in Shrewsbury, \" his right divining soul should straightway tell him it was for Queen Mane's death.\" It was natural that he should \" long to know the truth more earnestly,\" and equally so, that he should be \" loath to trust his servants \" to make the inquiry. Under these circumstances he called his eldest son Thomas, then a boy of 16 years, and des patched him to the town on horseback. The road from the stables at Longner down to the river (through which, when it is fordable, lies their nearest horse-way to Shrewsbury) ran in the front of the old house, and was commanded by the windows of the upper parlour, in which Mr. Burton was sitting. In order, therefore, to abridge as much as possible the anxious interval of suspense, he directed his son to throw up his hat when he came within sight of those windows, in case he returned with the hoped for intelligence, as a token that the queen was actually dead. The youth set off, and it is surely needless to picture the conflict of passions in the father's breast during his absence. He returned, he made the desired signal. But what must have been his feelings, when, upon hurrying into the apartment to congratulate his father upon his deliver ance, he found him just breathing his last ! The tumult of the mind had overpowered the body. On receiving the signal \" the good man retiring presently from the window, and recovering his chair, for extremity of joy which he conceived for the deliverance of the saints of"], [307, "LONGNER. 293 God, he suddenly expired, and this was his Nunc dimittis Domine ! \" Their next care was to inter his remains. What passed at his funeral I shall give in the words of Fox, in which the candid reader will make some allowance for the warmth of the writer, and of the age in which, and the views with which, he wrote : \u2014 The like example of charitable affection in these catholicke churchmen is also to be sene and noted in the burying of one Mauster Edward Bourton, Esquier, who, in the same diocese of Chester, departyng out of this world the very day before queene Elizabeth was crowned,1 required of his frendes as they would aunswere for it that his body should be buryed in his parish church (whiche was S. Chaddes in Shrousbury) so that no massemonger shoulde be present thereat ; which thing being declared to the Curate of that Parish, named Sir John Marshall, and the body beyng withall brought to the buriall2 1 This seems very precise, and yet we must either condemn it as inaccurate, or abandon the traditional account of Mr. Burton's death, which one would be loat'i to do, as fictitious. Queen Mary died on the 17th of November, Queen Elizabeth was crowned on the 15th sf January. It is utterly incredible that the news of the former event should be two months in travelling from London to Shrewsbury. But there is too much reason to fear from the tenour of Mr. Burton's will, that we must have recourse to the latter expedient, and reject the interesting relation of his descendant. As thisstedfast Protestant died, according to that narrative, very suddenly, his will must have been executed at least some days previous to his decease ; yet it has evidently been drawn up under a Protestant Sovereign, i.e., after the accession of Elizabeth, for no man in his senses, under the government of Queen Mary, would direct himself to be buried in his parish church, so as no mass-monger should be present at his funeral. Indeed, it must be confessed that Fox's ignorance of the remarkable facts attending this gentleman's death casts a great shade of suspicion upon the whole story. 3 After all the body was not \"brought to the buriall.\" For thus Fox in the errata prefixed to his work, page 1621, col. 1, line 6 : \u2014 \" Whereas it is mentioned of Maister Edward Bourton, Esquier, that he was brought to the church and there denyed Christian buriall : understand (gentle reader) that he was not brought to the place of burial, but only a messenger, whose name is John Tarperley, was sent to know* whether he should be buried in Christian burial or not, which beiug denyed hym, he was thereupon buried iu his owne garden, as is declared in the page above mentioned.\" It is impossible not to observe the \\ery reluctant, and somewhat disingenuous terms in which this retractiou is couched."], [308, "294 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. upon the same day that the Queene was crowned, the Curate being therewith offended sayd playnly that he should not be buried in the church there. Whereunto one of his frendes, named George Torpelley,1 annsweryng agayne, sayd that God would judge him in the last day, etc. Then the Priest, \"Judge God,\" sayth he, \" or Devill, the body shall not come here ;\" and so they buried him in his owne garden, where he is, no doubt, as neare the kingdome of heaven as if he had bene buried in the middest of the Church.\" His descendant's remark upon this transaction follows : \u2014 \" The storm of persecution was not quite so blown over thereby \" (either by Elizabeth's accession or Mr. Burton's sudden death, for it is difficult to say which is meant), \" but that still some scatterings did fall upon the servants of God, for they suffered some grievances still, among which was their being debarred from Christian interment in Churches.\" The commentator on Antoninus lived in \"evil days\" during the reign of Puritanism , when Popery was to be painted as black as possible. Our lot is fallen on au age of more liberality, when, without being involved, I trust, in her errors, we can allow her a fair hearing. It is evident from the words of the martyrologist, which are, doubtless, not designedly favourable to the Church of Rome, that Mr. Marshall could not, without a glaring desertion of his principles, have interred the body in his church under the limitations prescribed by the deceased. Could a clergyman of our present establish ment give sepulture to a Dissenter who stipulated, and 1 George Torpelley was probably the informant of Fox. He appears to have been a zealous Protestant of those times, and is referred to by the martyrologist as one of his authorities for the \" godly end \" of William Glover, who was denied Christian burial by the curate of Wem for his attachment to the cause of reformation. Fox, 1620. Torperley afterwards came to live in Shrewsbury, and seems to bave been a very busy fellow and warm Puritan.

Nor can we justly withhold the praise of firmness from the curate of St. Chad, who dared to vindicate the rights of his expiring Church, at the moment of her dissolution. Mr. Burton found sepulture, as we have seen, in his garden near the fishponds, and his remains lay for. the space of 56 years with no other memorial on the monu ment set over them, but his name and the year of his decease, and even these were become illegible by the lapse of so many years, and the effect of the weather. At the end of that time, Sir Andrew Corbet, Lord- Lieutenant of Shropshire (my author styles him baronet, but he never bore that title) happening to dine at Longner with divers other gentlemen of quality, asked leave of his host, the grandson of the deceased, to visit the tomb ot his ancestor. The state of decay in which it lay drew from him a gentle rebuke or \" friendly correction,\" as the original quaintly expresses it, together with a serious injunction for its reparation, and not long after he produced the following copy of verses, now painted upon the monument, which are creditable to the talents of a Shropshire gentleman of the 17th century, though a leading idea in them proceeds upon the same misconception of the circumstances under which the interment took place, which has been already remarked in the antiquary's reflections on the same transaction.

From a younger son of Thomas Burton, the eldest son of Edward, is descended the noble family of the Earls of Conyngham in Ireland. That kingdom, under the reigns of Elizabeth and James, presented a rich field of enterprise for young men of spirit and ambition. Among: the adventurers who went to seek their fortunes there was Captain Thomas Burton, the younger son above mentioned. Here he chanced to form an intimacy with his countryman Francis Sheppard of Balcot in the parish of Munslow in Corvedale, who having courted a young lady in that neighbourhood, had the misfortune to kill his rival, Richard More, only son of Jasper More, Esq., of Larden, in a duel, in consequence of which he had fled into Ireland, rose to be an officer in the English army, and got a great estate from the Irish rebels. Captain Burton, whose sister Anne had married Mr. Charles More of Millichop, was probably acquainted with Mr. Sheppard before the fatal adventure which compelled him to leave his native country ; and the latter finding his end draw near, made a will by which he devised his estate to his sister Anne Sheppard, and constituted his friend the captain executor, who hasten ing over to England, and repairing to Millichope, took an opportunity of engaging the affections of the young heiress, and having succeeded in obtaining her hand in marriage, produced her brother's will, and prevailed upon her to accompany him into Ireland, to settle upon her recent acquisitions. Such is the account in a paper at Millichop, drawn up by Mr. Henry More of that place, great nephew of Captain Burton. And from 1 [In 1842, the tomb, having become very much dilapidated, was taken down and every stone replaced in its original position by Mr. Robert Burton of Longner. About 2J or 3 feet below the ground, the bones were found, but no trace of any coffin. They were at once covered up again, and the tomb rebuilt. See S. A.

His father, of the same names (second son of Thomas Burton, Esquire, of Longner), was entered of Shrewsbury School in 1584, and is styled a citizen of London by Antony Wood, but was resident at Atcham, and denominated a plebeian in 1624, when his son, of whom I am now to speak, was admitted of Queen's College, Oxford, by which designation is only meant that the son was entered as a servitor : a station which those days of comparative simplicity did not regard as discreditable to the son of a younger brother of the first families. William Burton the younger was born in London in or about the year 1608, being of the age of 16 at his admission at Queen's College, where he applied himself with great diligence and equal success to his studies. Logic and Philosophy were the favourite pursuits of that College, but Burton's inclination lay more to Philology and Classical Literature, to which he devoted his nights and days, and in which he attained that proficiency as to be appointed Greek professor in Gloucester Hall at the early age of 23. We have his inaugural lecture on the history of the Greek language on his entrance upon that office, printed at London in 12mo, 1657. It is inscribed to his pupil Thomas Thynne, the first Viscount Weymouth,1 and it is prefaced by a 1 This gentleman, the Thomas Thynne, Esq., of Lougleate, obtained possession of the papers he left behind him, and they are probably still remaining in the library there."], [312, "298 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. Latin epistle from his friend, the celebrated Dr. Lang baine, in which the writer reminds his correspondent ofthe years of study they had passed within the walls of the college from which his letter is dated, and of which Langbaine was now master. Mr. Burton, being compelled to quit college by his necessities, became usher to that famous schoolmaster, Thomas Farnaby, but was afterwards elected to the free Grammar School of Kingston-upon-Thames, which he appears to have retained till his death, though he retired to London two years before that event. At the end of his in augural lecture mentioned above is a curious little tract, the remains of the ancient Persian language, as they occur in the classical authors, arranged alphabetically, and inscribed to a Shropshire worthy, \"the most learned youth Thomas Hide, the very diligent restorer of the Persian Pentateuch.\" But Mr. Burton's most consider able work was his commentary on the British part of Antoninus's Itinerary, printed at London in a thin folio, 1658, and dedicated to the Right Honourable John, Lord Glyn, Lord Chief Justice of the Court of Upper Bench, whom he thanks for \" the particular favours conferred on himself, and those bestowed on his near relations.\" To this work, which displays great research and very general reading, and in which he ranks him self among those who have endeavoured, in many instances with great probability, to deduce the origin of our laws and government from the polity and juris prudence of the Romans, is prefixed his portrait by Hollar, in which he appears of a comely and grave aspect, with small whiskers and a peaked beard, falling band and tufted gown. He died the 28th of December, 1657, and as his book bears no appearance of a post humous work, it must have been printed off before his demise, though the booksellers have, according to their usual practice, affixed the date of the succeed ing year.

I have applied to a daughter of Mr. Laurentz, a late Head-master of Kingston School, and she informs me all the documents re specting that school are in the custody of the Corporation of that town. It is very probable Manning and Bray perused these Records and extracted from them the above account of Burton. The Company of Merchant Adventurers (now de nominated the Hamburgh Company) was incorporated by Edw. I, anno 1296, being the first Incorporation of Merchants erected in England. Their original name is now in disuse. Kingston is 12 miles from London. I have not forgot to make your remembrance to Mr. France. There is no occasion to"], [316, "302 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. apologize for any application to me, as nothing will give me greater pleasure than to convince you how truly I am yours John Pridden. 100, Fleet Street, 27 Feb., 1817. In the civil wars of Charles I. Longner did not escape without its share of the distresses which at that time affected the whole country. Its commanding situation upon the Severn rendered it too conspicuous to be neglected as an out-post, and it was at an early period of the war garrisoned with a party of Royalists from Shrewsbury. Though the number of soldiers stationed here appears to have been inconsiderable, we may readily conceive that they must have been a great annoyance to the owner, or that he was anxious for their removal. This he at length effected, their presence being required elsewhere, on his undertaking to defend his house against the Parliamentary forces, at his own charge. The following extract from the minutes of the Corpora tion of Shrewsbury refers to this transaction : \u2014 18 Dec., 1643. Ag. upon ye promise of Fra. Burton, Esq., of Longner, that he will mayntayne 8 musketeers to keepe the garrison there, that, if the Governor thinke fitt, then to remove yc garrison from Longner to Monford bridge for defence of ye bridge. After the surprise of Shrewsbury in the beginning of the year 1645, Longner could not be long in following the example of the county town. The committee of Shropshire was indefatigable in reducing the whole country entrusted to them, to the power of the Parlia ment ; and in the newspaper entitled Perfect Occurences, of July 25, 1645, in the list of garrisons \" taken in \" by them from the king, in the course of the summer, mention is made of'Athan bridge and Longnar house,\" meaning, no doubt, Atcham bridge and this place. Thomas Burton, Esquire, the son and heir of the last mentioned Francis, was a lawyer of distinguished eminence in the latter part ofthe 17th century. He"], [317, "303 LONGNER. was admitted a member of Gray's Inn the 3rd of May, 1651, and appears to have been as much attached to a reformation in the state in the reign of Charles II. , as his ancestor was to one in the Church in that of Queen Mary. At least, the deposition of one Robert Smith, a Scottish covenanter, printed in the appendix to Dr. Spratts' Narrative of the Rye-house Plot, p. 180, which states him to have taken refuge in England after the affair of Rothwell Bridge, goes on, \" where I con tinued three years, and was at many Presbyterian house-conventicles in Shrewsbury, Birmingham, and Bristol ; but never see a field-conventicle in this king dom, save one at Clee-hill (some few miles distant from Ludlow) upon Sunday in May, 1681, where we met to the number of upward of a thousand, and some of note were among them. But I do only remember the names of Mr. Burton, a lawyer, whose country residence is in Shropshire, and .... a merchant in Birmingham, besides the two ministers who preached, whose names are Mr. Thomas Eaglesall, who lived in Kinver, and Mr. Thomas Case, who lived near Shrewsbury, and their sermons were wholly tending to raise faction and sedition, in the same manner as I have too frequently heard in the field- conventicles in Scotland.\" Mr. Burton was certainly a gentleman of Whig prin ciples since he was instituted by King William a judge for in Wales, and it is said that he sat on the commission for trying Captain Benbow after the fatal battle of Worcester in 1651. The male issue of the elder branch of the Burtons failing in the year 1735, the Longner estate devolved upon Anne, the sole heiress of that branch, the wife of Thomas Lingen, Esq., of Radbrook, in the county of Gloucester, a gentleman of a very ancient family and great estate, as he is styled in the Biographia Britan nica (art. Willis), whose eldest son, Robert Lingen, assumed the name and arms of Burton only, by Act of Parliament, in pursuance of the will of his great-uncle, Thomas Burton, Esq., the last heir male."], [318, "304 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. The family of Lingen was of the earliest antiquity and good consideration in the county of Hereford, but an authentic pedigree of their remote descents is out of desideration in these pursuits. I shall deliver nothing as certain which I have not found to be so. It is probable that they are derived from Turstin de Wigmore,1 who when Domesday was compiled held Lingen (there written Lingham, and included within Shropshire) Sirelei and Hantonetun under Ralph de Mortimer, and Melela (Mawley, near Cleobury), from Earl William, i.e., William fitz Osbern, Earl of Here ford, and as many Norman adventurers, after the successful expedition of the sons of Tancred, pushed their footing in both the Sicilies, it is not unlikely that the Count of Andria, of whom we read in a contem porary historian, may have been one of his descendants. \" Nee Willielmo regi Apuliae (says the Norman 1 Turstin of Wigmore married Agnes, daughter of Alured de Merleberge (Domesday of Hampshire). It was by this marriage that Turstin got Cowarne, and as the Pauncefotes afterwards held it, it probably passed to them in like manner by marriage. Constantia, daughter of Sir John de Lingayne, married Grimbald, son and heir of Sir Richard Pancefote, in 1253. The marriage articles are dated Thursday after St. James (Duncomb's Herefordshire ii., 97). See there the extraordinary account of her conjugal affection in cutting off her left hand to rescue her husband from captivity. It is remark able, however, that none of them appear on the list of Herefordshire sheriffs before John Lingein, Esq., 6 Edw. IV., who occurs again six 3 ears later as John Lingein, Knight. John Lingein without any addition was sheriff 2 Hen. VII., and John Lingein, Knight, 11 Henry VII. John Lingen, junior, Knight, 21 Hen. VII. John Lingen, Knight (without the addition of junior) 8 and 1 2 Hen. VIII. Thomas Lingen, Knight, 20 Hen. VIII. John Leingein, Esq., 36 Hen. VIII. Edward Leingein, Esq., 18 Jac. I., Henry Lingein, Esq., 13 Car. I. In the list of Herefordshire gentry 1433, 1 find only Philip Lyngeyn, as taking the oaths to Henry VI. The attachment of the head of the family to the white rose prevented, I suppose, his name from appearing. Mr. Duncomb (ii., 150) quotes from Domesday, \"Agnes relicti Turstini Flandrensis & Eustacius Miles, filius ejus, dominus de Whiteney, dederunt ecclesi\u00e6 Sci Petri Gloucestr' unam hidam in Pencumb.\" He adds that the family of Whitney descended from this Eustace. The above does not sound to me like the style of Domesday"], [319, "305 LONGNER. Chronicle, edited by Du Chesne, sub. ann. 1154) bellum deficit, nam Bobertus comes de Bassevilla, qui erat cognatus ejus, et Richardus de Lingen comes Andri\u00e6 putantes regem mortuum, per regnum Apuliae graviter debacchati sunt.' For there is no probability that this Calabrian earl was a native of the town of his name in the principality of Munster. Our English Lingen1 is a small village seated in a sequestered valley in the north western corner of Herefordshire \u2014 that part of the county anciently denominated Wigmoreland \u2014 a few miles distant from Wigmore, Pembridge, and Aymes trey. The keep and moat of its little castle are still discernable, but all traces of the building have long since utterly disappeared. In a good Harleian MS. (1087J is an ancient pedigree of this family, and in another (6821) are some notices of several members of it, as they had occurred in the researches of the collector \"non linialiter sed secundum reperta in diversis memorandis.\" I shall transcribe the former, corrected in some few instances by the latter.

Ralph de Lingayne witnesses a grant of lands with out date to Roger de Mortimer, who died in the 17th of John (Lib. Nig. de Wigmore; Harl. MS. 1240). A person of these names also occurs in the same book in 1284. John appears to have been a very favourite name in this family, and there must have been three who bore it in succession, as \" Sir John de Lingayne, the third, Lord os Lingayne,\" occurs in the Harl. MS. last quoted. In the Testa de Nevill, compiled chiefly in the reign of Henry III., and the Herefordshire part of it in his 27th year, John de Lingaine is stated to hold half a fee in Lingaine, in the county of Salop,1 of the barony of R. (Ralph) de Mortimer, half a hide in Kenescestr, in Herefordshire, of Lantony, in Gloucester, of the honour of Snodhill of old feoffment, and a hide in Kovenhop (Konenhop) in the same county of the honour of Wigge mor of old feoffment. He appears among those who hold lands and rents in Shropshire of the annual value of \u00a320 in the 25th Edw. L, and also among the knights of Herefordshire in the same year, and received summons to London with horses and arms, &c. (Harl. MSS. 1192). In the 40th of Henry III. he had a grant of free warren in his manor of Lingeyne, which then still con tinued to be deemed a part of Shropshire. 1 Qu. 1 Is there not some error in placing Lingain in Shropshire, as this entry occurs under Lingain in Wigmore Hund., Co. Hereford ? If further particulars of the Lingain family will be useful I can give them from Blount's MS.\u2014 W. H.

[From Blount's MS.

I., and also among the knights of Herefordshire in the same year, and received summons to London with horses and arms ; and that he was dignified with the honour of knighthood is certain from the Black Book of Wigmore, already quoted, in which he occurs with that title as a witness to various charters of Roger de Mortimer in the 7th, 10th, and 12th of Edw. II. Assises held at Salop 20 Edw. I. (A0 1292). Ralph de Lengeyne was found to have taken from the vill of Huntydon I8d for Streteward and Motfee. (Lloyd's Collections for Hist, of Shropshire, voce Chelmarsh, p. 204). 9 Edw. II. Richard de Lingen and Margaret de Mortimer held Stirch and Leinton, in Hereford Hundred. Ralph de Lingen, Knight, occurs in the same [Blount's] MS., and in the same quality in the 49th"], [322, "308 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. Edward III., and I take him to be the same who is stated (though without the addition of knight) to hold Couenhope in the 22nd Richard II. , and who, by the name of Ralph Lingen of Wigmore, married Margery, daughter of Fulke de Penbruge of Tonge Castle, in Shropshire, and had issue by her, Isabel Lingen, suc- cessively the wife of Sir Fulke Penbruge of the same castle, Sir Thomas Peytevine, and Sir John Ludlow, knights, and foundress in 1411 ofthe College of Tonge. It is from these frequent inter-marriages with the family of Pembruge that I derive the arms of Lingen, for armorial bearings were by no means fully established in this country as late as the middle of the 15th century, many persons of ancient family and fortune not having then assumed them ; and Mr. Selden quotes an example under the reign of Edward III. of an esquire of Buck- ino-hamshire, who, being interrogated whether he were a gentleman and had arms, or no, deposes upon oath that he was a gentleman of birth and had land of 20 marks yearly by descent, \" and has not used to travail in war, nor his father before him, wherefore he has never sought to learn what his arms are.\" (Selden Tit. Hon., pt. 2, Ch. 5, sec. 47). This was certainly the case in the 19th of Edward III. with the family now under consideration, for in a deed dated Sunday after the Feast of the Translation of St. Thomas the Martyr in that year, whereby John de Lyngeyne grants a piece of land in Homene Castel in fee to one Roger Ynggon, he seals with nothing but a sprig, a proof that he had then no hereditary coat armour. At a later period, and, as I suspect after the estates of Mortimer had passed to the house of York, and the white rose was become the badge of that family, the Lingens assumed for their arms, barry or. and az., a bend charged with 3 white roses surmounting 2 bars, a coat evidently derived from that of Pembruge, the bend and bars without the charge which I find append ant to a deed of Henry de Pennebrugge, Knight, in 31 Edw. L, as that in its turn was borrowed from the arms"], [323, "309 LONGNER. of Harcourt, the bars without the bend, by a coheiress of which family Tonge Castle passed into that of Pem bruge in the second year of that king's reign. Ralph de Lingen, Knight, mentioned above, was father, I presume, of Ralph Lyngeyn, Knight, who in the 2 1st of Henry VI , 1442, occurs as a trustee with Humphrey Cotes (inter cartas Joh. Cotes de Woodcote ar.), and who was dead in the 38th of the same king, 1459 (Ibid). In his will, which bears date December 18th, 1452, he styles himself of Stoke, and from him the pedigree descends in a certain and uninterrupted succession. (Aycough's Index 112, B. 13).

[The descent of the Longner estate in the family of Lingen, now Burton, may be thus traced. Robert Lingen, who succeeded his uncle, Thomas Burton of Longner, in 1730, assumed the surname of Burton by Act of Parliament in 1748. He was born in 1725, was High Sheriff of Salop 1763, married 1748 Anne, daughter of Thomas Hill of Tern Hall, and died in 1803. His eldest son, \u2014 Robert Barton, of Longner, High Sheriff 1804, died without issue in 1841, and was succeeded by his nephew, \u2014 Robert Burton (son of the Rev. Henry Burton, Vicar of Atcham), of Longner. He married first, Catherine, daughter of William Walcot of the Moor Hall ; and secondly, Catherine, daughter of the Rev. Herbert Oakeley, D.D., of Oakeley, by whom he left at his death 14 Sept., 1860, a son, \u2014 Robert Lingen Burton, J. P. and D.L., of Longner. He married in 1861, Catherine Sophia, daughter of Richard Francis Cleaveland, Commander R.N., and died 17 November, 1880, leaving (with other issue) a son, \u2014 John Lingen Burton, now of Longner Hall. The Arms of Burton are : Per pale azure and purpure a cross engrailed or between four roses argent. Longner is an insulated part of St. Chad's parish.

The Norman commissioners are so succinct in their descrip tions, and so unceremonious with respect to the most exalted personages of the Saxon period, that there is some reason to believe that under this brief designation is intended Queen Edith, that monarch's consort. The grounds for this opinion will be stated under the article of Cleobury Mortimer, which with Kinlet in that neighbourhood, and Pulley in this, had been also the property of this Eddid, and were become, by the time that Domesday was compiled, a pait of the possessions of the powerful Ralph de Mortimer,1 a near kinsman, and distinguished favourite of the Conqueror. The description of this manor in that Survey runs thus : \u2014 The same Ralph holds Melam in the hundred of Sciropisberie: Eddid held it : Three hides are rated to the Dane geld : The demesne consists of three carucates f and three carucates are 1 [Queen Edith's estate near Shrewsbury, consisting of Meole, Edgebold, and a great part of Pulley, had probably passed from her hands to those of William fitz Osborn, Earl of Hereford, had been forfeited by his son Earl Roger de Bretolio in 1074, and had then been granted by King William to Ralph de Mortimer. Cf. Eyton, vi., 350\u2014 Ed.] 2 [Not carucates in this and the two following places, but ox-teams. \u2014 Ed.1"], [332, "318 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. occupied by six servants, four female servants, six villeins, and three bordars: besides, half a carucate is holden by one radman. Six burgesses in the city are regardant to this manor. Here is a mill of the annual value of 20s. The manor was valued in the reign of the Confessor at \u00a37, but at the time ofthe survey at \u00a313 5s. 6d. The church of St. Mary of Shrewsbury was possessed of a virgate (sixty acres) of land in this manor, during the Saxon times, and continued to hold it when Domesday was compiled. It was valued at 4s. at both these periods1. As the Mortimer family was not implicated in the revolt of Robert de Belesme, they appear in the very confined list of those Shropshire proprietors who con tinued to hold their estates in an uninterrupted series from the time of the Norman Conquest, and Hugh de Mortimer, who died in 1185, 32 Hen. II. (the son ot Ralph, the first possessor), granted the advowson of Meoles Bracy (so the name is written in the chronicle of Wigmore priory preserved by Dugdale ) to the canons of that house. The part of that chronicle which relates to this donation was written, I conceive, about the beginning of the thirteenth century ; and the manor had then, we see, obtained the distinctive appellation which it still retains : how much earlier it had received that addition I have not found. The name Brace is derived from the family of Bracy : of whom Aldulphus de Braci, apparently a kinsman of Fulke fitz Warin,2 attested that nobleman's foundation charter to Alber bury priory (Ashmol. MSS., 461, 462) ; and another of the same name, son of the former, lived in 9 Joh., 1207 1 [Nothing further is known of St. Mary's virgate in the manor of Meole. The Church may have surrendered or exchanged the land. Cf. Eyton vi., 359.\u2014 Ed.] 2 See the Gestes of Guarine and his sons in the 1st vol. of Leland Coll., in which the connection of Bracy and Fitz Warin is couspicuous.

He held this manor under the Mortimers,1 and I presume aspired to hold it independent of that family, for in the former of those years, from Easter term at the end of the 9th of John to Trinity at the beginning of the 10th of that King (1207-8), Roger de Mortimer demanded against Audulf de Brasei the manor of Moles, whereof his (Mortimer's) ancestors have been seised from the time ofthe Conquest of England, as well as in the time ot King Henry the grandfather (Henry I.) as afterwards to the time of King Henry the father (Henry IL), in whose time Hugh de Mortimer, father of the demandant, was seised. (Dodsworth's Collect., vol. 94, so. 36.) I have not seen the result of this suit2, but it evidently ended in establishing the superiority of Mortimer, under whom the great family of Cantilupe appears to have enjoyedonemoietyof the manor.3 In 19 Hen. III. (1235) 1 [Eyton thinks that, in Mortimer's hands, Edgebold and a great part of Pulley became so involved in Meole that all three manors were occasionally described as Meole. Hugh de Mortimer of Wigmore was seised of this collective manor of Meole in 1155, but subsequently enfeoffed William Martel, a knight, therein. William Martel gave the manor to Audulf de Braci, upon whose death Roger de Mortimer, son and heir of Hugh, seised upon Meole as his own demesne. Ibid, 350-1.\u2014 Ed.] 2 [The litigation lasted from April, 1203, to January, 1211. Iu 1208 William de Cantilupe, the King's Seneschal, put in a claim to the manor. The result was that a fine was levied in January, 1211, between Roger de Mortimer and Audulf de Braci (son of Audulf named above), in which Roger recognizes Audulf's right to the manor, but so that William de Cantlup shall hold the whole manor under Roger at the service of a knight's fee, and Audulf shall hold under William de Cantlup a moiety of the manor at the service of half a knight's fee, but not the capital messuage which Cantlup was to hold. For this fine, Cantlup paid Mortimer 30 ) marks. There seems to have been some treachery on Cantilupe's part. This transaction, however, held good for ages. The whole proceedings are carefully given in Eyton vi., 350-5. It should be noted that Cantilupe's first wife was Mascelina, daughter of the first Audulf de Braci. \u2014 Ed.] 3 [At the Assizes of November, 1221, Gilbert de Meles, Roger"], [334, "320 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES.

In 1254, Henry III. grants free-warren to Robert de Cantilupe, who held under William, in all his demesnes at Meules (Rot. Vascon, 38 Hen. III., p. 2, m. 8 .).

Sd.ob. The next record in which I find mention of this manor is a feodarium of the hundred of Shrewsbury of the 7th of Edw. I., in which it is stated that Audulph le Bracy (so it is written) and the heirs of George de Cantelovve hold the manor of Meole Brace of Roger de Mortimer by the service of one knight's fee. Audulph le Bracy holds in demesne one carucate of the annual value of forty shillings, and one mill and a half of the annual value of 25s., also possessions in Pulley, New bold, and Newton (which will be -inserted under their proper heads), and the heir of Cantelowe has half the manor of Mola, where is a carucate in demesne, and a mill, and possessions in Pulley, &c, as above. From the tenour of these extracts it is nearly certain that Braci and Cantilupe were the heirs general of some family who held this manor under the Mortimers at an earlier period, but every memorial of such prior family has hitherto eluded all my enquiries. In 40 Edw. III. (1366) Agnes, widow of Robert Bracy of Meole Bracy, conveys lands here to Philip de Lanelye, vicar of St. Alkmund, and another chaplain feoffee. (Bowen's MSS.) In 12 Edw. III. (1338) there was a fine between Robert Bracy and Agnes his wife, complainants, and Roger de Aston, chaplain, deforciant, of a moiety of the manor of Meolebracy. It is acknowledged to be the right of Roger, who grants it to Robert and Agnes in tail, remainder to John, son of Thomas Colle, in fee."], [337, "323 MEOLE BRACE. The Zouches appear in process of time to have acquired the whole of this manor, for in a Calendar of all the knight's fees which belonged to Edmund de Mortimer, late Earl ot March (the third Earl), taken in 1414 (Harl. MSS., 704), one knight's fee is enumerated in Meiers Bracy, which William de Souche holds, and which is extended to the value of 100s. ; and in the following year, 3 Hen. V., the Inquisition after the death of William la Zouche finds that he died the 3rd day of November last past, seised of the manor of Meole Bracy, leaving his son and heir, William, aged 13 years. (Dugd. MSS., A. 1, in Ashm. Lib.) By an Inquisition ad quod Da-mnum of 7 Hen. V. it is found that William la Zouche held on the day of his death a moiety of the manor of Mulbracy in his demesne as of fee, valued at \u00a318 a year. In the 10th year ot the same King, however, John Holland, Earl of Hunting don, ar.d William Carnoll, Esq., and Elizabeth, his wife (late wife of William la Zouch, lord of Meole Brace), were joint lords of this manor, and held a court here, on the Friday after St. Barnabas. I can give no account of this joint-tenancy. La Zouch was one of those sobriquets or nick-names which great men assumed when they set forth on a pilgrimage to Palestine. Mauduit (Ill-taught), Plan tagenet (Broom-stalk), &c, were of this number. The ostensible motive to this was a principle of religious humility : but it was also of use to conceal their quality, and so to keep down the price of their ransom in case they were taken prisoners. Zouch is the stock or body of a tree. Moliere makes Arnulphe, in the School for Wives, call himself Monsr. de la Souche, from an old trunk of a tree on his estate.

From a MS. in the possession of Sir Digby Mack-"], [346, "HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. 332 worth, Bart., drawn up by Thomas Mackworth, Esq., of Betton, in the reign of Charles II. , I learn that John, Lord Zouch, conveyed the castle and manor of Meole Brace, and several other lands in Nobold and Newton, to Arthur Mackworth, \" but he reserved to himself and to his heirs the royalties hereafter men tioned, viz., to have and give in armes and inconusance the Asse-head, which was before annexed to the said castle of Meole Brace.\" As the compiler of tbe MS. from which this extract is taken was of the family of Mack worth of Betton, he appears to have had no access to the ancient documents of his kinsmen of Meole Brace, which had before his time passed into other families. We are, therefore, left in ignorance as to the origin of this cognizance of the ass's head,1 and are unable to ascertain the date of this alienation of the manor, or from which of the two Lords Zouch of the baptismal name of John it proceeded. The gallant behaviour of Sir James de Audeley and his four esquires at Poictiers, when, following their master, they placed themselves in the front of tbe battle, and cut their way through the French army, even to the marshal's standard, is known to every reader of the history of those times. From one of these brave gentlemen the family of Mackworth claim to descend, the other three being Delves, Fowlehurst, and Hawkestone. Other accounts, however, substitute Dutton for Mackworth, and this I take to be the truth. All these five families do indeed bear the frett of Audley in their coat armour; but as tbe four esquires of Poictiers were all of them confessedly Cheshire men \u2014 to a connection with which county Mackworth can have no pretensions, being derived from 1 An ass's head argent, tied round the mouth with a cord azure, charged on the neck with a fleur de lys vert, is given in Edmonson as the crest of Zouch of Wiltshire. From the terms of the grant above referred to, it appears that it could have belonged only to that branch of the family which was possessed of the castle of Meole Brace,"], [347, "MEOLE BRACE. 333 the castle of that name in Derbyshire, which continued in the Mackworths of Normanton till the middle of the 17th century \u2014 we must look elsewhere for their armorial bearings. Accordingly we find from the MS. already quoted that it was not till the year 1404, nearly half a century after the battle of Poictiers, that John Tuchet, Lord Audley, the heir general of the hero of that famous day, granted a coat of arms to John Mackworth and Thomas Mackworth, his brother, for that they and their ancestors had done brave service to him and his ancestors : quod illi & illorum majoris operam fortem sibi & suis majoribus prestitissent. This deed, which, says the MS., \" is enrolled in the tower of London\u2014 the original being in the custody of Sir Thomas Mackworth [of Normanton, baronet] \u2014 and the other part was in the possession of my grandfather, Richard Mackworth, till it was burnt with his other writings at Sutton,\" shews the true date of the arms of Mackworth, which are, in fact, ingeniously compounded of the two coats of Audley and Touches blended together. [The Arms of Audley, Touchet, and Mackworth, are here tricked in the MS.] This John Mackworth (the grantee of the coat of arms) was Dean of Lincoln and Chancellor to the Prince of Wales, and gave his inn, now called Barnard's Inn, in Holborn, to the chapter of his cathedral church. An Harleian MS. (6,829, sol. 65) gives his epitaph from a marble tomb in that church : \u2014 Joh'es Mackworth decretor' doctor, cancellarius illustrissimi principis Henrici filii Regis Henrici IV\" & Decanus Eccl'ie b'e Marie Lincoln, From the expression of the MS. it might be supposed that the John Mackworth of the text was an esquire and a military man, but this does not appear to be the case. The original grant is printed in Blore's History of Rutland, p. 224. It is in French, and the cause which Lord Audeley assigns for making this grant of arms to the two brothers is \" that they are descended"], [348, "HISTORY OF SHREWSBURV LIBERTIES. 334 from good and valiant persons, and that their ancestors had done good service to bis ancestors.\" \" From a younger brother of the house of the Mack worths, supposed to be one of these armigers of the Lord Audleys, there descended one Thomas Mackworth, who was groome of the privy chamber to Henry VII., as appears from his petition to the King for a ranger's place in the chace of Sutton in the County of Warwick which I now have : and by the marriage with Anne a 2 cosen to the Lord Zouch hee first came into Shrop shire and was possessed of the castle and lordshipp of Bracemeole.\" MS. ut supr. If by the word \"possessed\" in this extract it is meant that this Thomas Mackworth was lord of the manor, this asser tion is inconsistent with the former one of John, Lord Zouch's conveyance of it to his son Arthur. He might, however, occupy the castle as tenant to that nobleman, his relation, as is said, by marriage. It is at least certain that he was resident and possessed of land here in that reign, as appears from an indenture of demise made at Meole brace, dated the 8th day of in 22 Hen. VII., between Thomas Mackworth and Anne his wife, on the one part, and Elizabeth Worthington on the other part. This is all that is said of that deed in the MS., and it is impossible to conjecture what its import may have been, but Elizabeth Worthington occurs as lady of the manor by grant from another family several years before the date of this last men- tioned transaction.1 Thomas Mackworth, the groom of the chamber, must have been in much favour with his sovereign if it be true, as stated in the MS. so often quoted, that Prince Arthur, happening to lie at the Castle of Meole Brace on his way from Shrewsbury to Ludlow, stood god father to his son, and gave him his own name, Prince Arthur was born in 1486, in 1493 he was 1 See p. 109 ante,"], [349, "335 meole brace. constituted Justice in the counties of Salop, &c, and the Marches of Wales. Two years later his father brought him to Shrewsbury, to introduce him, no doubt, to the subjects of his \"new-intrusted scepter,\" and between this time and his death at Ludlow in 1502 he may have resided several times here, or passed between the two towns, of which our annals take no notice. (I find him at Chester in 1498.) So that this anecdote enables us to fix the birth of Arthur Mack worth with sufficient certainty within the compass of a few years. Of his two sons, Thomas died before his father, leaving issue who \" by the fraud of their grandfather were disinherited after their father's decease,\" says the MS. From Thomas, adds the same authority, comes the family of John Mackworth the dyer in Shrewsbury, who sold the Dayhouse and some lands in Nobold which he had by his father. \" William, the other son, mortgaged all his father's land in Meele brace, Nobold, and Newton to one Thomas Harris of Lincoln's Inn, the younger, as appears by his deed, 35 Eliz., most of which is since come to be the inheritance of Sir Francis Edwards, Bart., as bought by his grandfather, old Mr. Edwards, and some is possessed by Mr. Berrington of Motehall.\" Ibid.

LThe parish of Meole Brace includes the townships of Pulley, Nobold, Newton, and Edgebold. Some alteration was made in the parish boundaries in 1885. The population at the census of 1891 was 1,608, exclusive of the Schools. A census taken by the Vicar in the spring of 1794 gave 379 males and 390 females, total 769, exclusive of the residents in the House of Industry \u2014 nearly double the population 50 years previously. The area is about 2,488 acres. Meole Brace probably takes its name from the Mill which anciently stood on the banks of the Meole brook (or Rea river), which flows through the parish. Mr. Duignan connects it with the Welsh word moel, a hill ; but this derivation scarcely seems probable, looking at the nature of the ground. (See Owen and Blakeway, ii, 5n ; Shrop. Arch. Trans., N.S, vi, 12). Brace is of oourse taken from the de Braci family, who held the manor The following inhabitants were taxed to the Lay Subsidy of 1 Edw.

From an early date Meole Brace occurs amongst the \" Libertates Ward\u00e6 Lapide\u00e6.\" In a Court Roll of 1392-3 it is called \"Mole Bracy.\" The old Castle House and the Tithe Barn adjoining were burnt down in 1669. The Castle Bank, where it probably stood, lies in the Hall grounds. A mulberry tree was planted during the incumbency of Archdeacon Edward Bather, and marks the place where some remains were found. The present Hall was rebuilt and enlarged by Archdeacon Edward Bather The Day House (or Dairy House, as it was formerly called) also belongs to the Bather family. A Hospital for nine inmates, who each receive yearly \u00a38 and a ton of coal, was erected in 1844 by John Evans of Shrewsbury.

This was, however, discontinued in 1774, and it afterwards seived as a place of confinement for Dutch prisoners of war. In 1784, it was sold for \u00a35,500. for the purpose of a House of Industry or Workhouse, the average number of inmates in 1824 being about 340. It was finally sold to the Governing Body of Shrewsbury School, and was converted into a School-house in 1882. 1 The suburb of Kingsland (or Chingsland, as it is written in a Norman grant) was long used by the freemen of Shrewsbury as a pasturage for their cattle, and part of it by the various Trades Gilds of Shrewsbury, who resorted in procession to their various Arbours erected upon it on the second Monday after Trinity Sunday. Since the removal of the School to Kingsland, the suburb has become a fashionable neighbourhood, a number of large dwelling-houses having been erected upon it. MEOLE BRACE CHARITIES.

ONSLOW. Onslow is written in Domesday Andrelau. It was then one of the estates of the Collegiate Church of St. Chad, Shrewsbury ; as it had also been in the Saxon times. Its arable land had been estimated at one hide as early as the imposition of the Danegeld ; and it had made no progress towards further cultivation during the interval which elapsed between that period, and the time of the Norman Survey, for in this last docu ment it was estimated only at one carucata,1 i.e., no more than its former extent. Indeed it had been waste, though at the date of Domesday it was occupied by three villans. The fee continued in the Church in 24 Edw. I., when, in the Iter of that date,2 it is found that Roger Onslowe held Onslowe of the fee of St. Chad's by the rent of 4s., the precise value at which it was estimated at Domesday ; and a similar entry appears in the Iter of Henry III. 11 Edw.

Thomas Fownes, Esq., sold Onslow to Richard Morhall,1 Esq., for 10,000 guineas [in 1763]. [This account of Onslow is meagre and imperfect. In Domesday, one moiety of the Manor was in the Hundred of Bascherch, and was held by the Church of St. Chad ; whilst the other moiety was in Ruessei Hundred, and was held by Robert fitz Corbet under Earl Roger de Montgomery.2 This latter moiety is not noticed by Blakeway. The entries in Domesday are as follows : \u2014 \" St. Chad's Church held and holds Andrelau. Here is 1 hide, geldable. It was waste. Here iij villains have one ox-team. It is worth 4s.\" \" Robert (fitz Corbet) holds Andreslaue of the Earl, and Ernui holds it of him. The same (Ernui) held it, and was a free man. Here is 1 hide, geldable. In the demesne is one ox-team, and (there are) iij villains with one team. It was worth 10s, now 12s. (per annum.)\" Earl Roger's moiety descended to the Boterells, as Robert Corbet's co-heirs, and seem to have been held under them by the Arundels. In the Ford Hundred Roll of 1255, John de Arundel is said to hold one geldable hide in Ondeslawe under the Manor of Longedon.3 St. Chad's moiety was also held by the Arundels. In 1190 Adam de Hundreslawe occurs. In 1203 there was a suit between John de Ondeslawe and William de Bikedon, concerning a right of common between Onslow and Bicton. In 1236 Roger de Ondeslawe occurs, also in 1256 and 1273, as a juror, and in 1284 as holding St. Chad's moiety. Richard de Ondeslawe was a juror in 1256, and John de Ondeslawe in 1292, both for Ford Hundred, whilst William de Onslow was juror for Pimhill Hundred in 1292. This shows that the Domesday distinction between thc two moieties of Onslow, placing them in different Hundreds, lasted for centuries : when both shares were absorbed in the Liberties of Shrewsbury, this distinction was destroyed. In 1302, John le Mouner and Katherine his wife granted two messuages and lands in Ondeslowe to Richard Goumond and Agnes his wife.4 Iii 1327, the following inhabitants of Ondeslowe in the Hundred of Pemenhull' were assessed to the Lay Subsidy : \u2014 John de Halle, Roger Warynge, Hugh Crompe, John de Wallefes, William fil Alan, William de Leton, and William le Dekene.

St. Chad's moiety seems to have been both rent-free and tithe-free In the Court- Books, Onslow appears amongst the Liberties of the Welsh Ward. In 1580, the following inhabitants of Onnslowe occur amongst the trained soldiers : \u2014 Mr. Ric. Purcell, Rees Tyther and Hughe his men ; Mr. Edward Ownslowe, Thomas Williams and Thomas Baker his men; Edward Ownslowe, George Bloure, Adam Fforten ; Richard Chidloe, and Griffithe ap Rees his man.3 In 1587, these names occur under Onslowe : \u2014 Edward Onslowe, Esq, and John Lingham and John Minors his servants ; Edward Purcell, and Robert Powell aud Hughe ap Pue his servants ; Adam Forten, Edward Forten his son, and John Smithe his servant ; Richard Chidley, George Blower, and John Roberts.* Pedigrees of the families of Onslow of Onslow, and Purcell of Onslow, were entered at the Heralds' Visitation of Shropshire in 1623. Richard Morhall, the purchaser of the Manor and estate of Onslow in 1763 from Thomas Fownes, sold it in 1780 to Rowland Wingfield, Esq, of Preston Brockhurst. The descent of Onslow in the Wingfield family is as follows : \u2014 I.

Rossall occurs in two entries of Domesday, and in each is written Rosela. The first entry comprises three carucates1 and a half, the property of the Church of St. Chad ; the second two carucates,1 holden of Earl Roger by Rainold the Sheriff, and under him by one Albert. In conformity with this division two places still bear the name : Down Rossall, so called because it lies lower down the Severn, that is, nearer to its mouth; Up RossaU, lying nearer to the head of the river, called also the Isle,2 from the remarkable manner in which it is surrounded by the Severn, being indeed a peninsula, with an isthmus about twelve score yards across. I shall begin with this last. 1 [Not carucates, but ploughs or teams of oxen. \u2014 Ed.] 2 [Eyton thinks that Up Rossall comprised, not only the manor of Rosela, but also the contiguous manor of Aitone (or Eyton), which Albert likewise held under Rainald the Sheriff. In the time of Edward the Confessor Leuric held Aitone. There were two hides. In the demesne was one plough ; add 4 serfs, 2 villanes, and 3 bordars with another plough. There was a mill of 10s. value. The site of Aytone was, probably, the peninsula of the Isle. The common tenure of Rosela aud Aitone soon caused them to be named by a single name, Rosshall. Cf. Eyton, x, 87. Mr. H. Sandford thinks that Eyton was wroug in his opinion, and that Aitone was on the opposite bank of the Severn, and is represented by the modern Yeaton. \u2014 Ed.J"], [394, "HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. 394 One Hunni had held the Isle in the Saxon times ; but upon the conquest, he gave way, as I have said, to a person of the name of Albert. Albert was not a mesne tenant, i.e., he did not hold immediate of an holder in capite, but he was a sub-tenant (or holder from such mesne tenant) of some consequence. Besides this place, he held Yeaton, Middleton Scriven and Ensdon. What became of him or his family I cannot say. The Fitz Alans succeeded to the estates of Rainold, and the Liber Niger, 1167, gives Hugh, son of Albert, as holding the fee of one knight, and three muntators and a half (whatever that may mean) of the fee of William fitz Alan ; but that this Albert, father of Hugh, was our Albert tenant of the Isle, I will not undertake to pronounce.1 At the time of the Liber Niger, the mode of distinguishing people by the place of their residence was by no means advanced with general use, so that we are seldom able to connect the persons named in that record with the holders in Domesday. Indeed, the revolt of Robert de Belesme dislodged an ample proportion of the Norman proprie tors of Shropshire; and upon the whole it is impossible now to ascertain whether any of them gave birth to the family which soon occurs as owneis of Rossall and borrowing their name from that place. [Here follow two or three incomplete pedigrees of Rossall, which I have thought it useless to print. \u2014 Ed.] The name is sometimes corrupted into Russel, but I must not therefore affirm that William Russel, who appears by the Testa de Nevill, 12 and 13 John, to hold by castle ward at Shrawardine, was of this family, though I think it very probable that he was so, and though that castle belonged to the Fitz Alans.

He even experienced some troubles from the party in opposition to the Court, under the name of one of the evil counsellors of Richard II. , but at length died in peace at his manor of Blickling, in Norfolk (where his monument, engraved in Gough, Sep. Mon., v., 2, is still remaining), in January, 1401. He appears to bave had no issue by the coheiress of Rosale, who after his death became the wife of Sir John Mortimer, I presume of the Attilborough family. Blomefield is, as usual, full and accurate on the subject of the Dagworths in his account, of Blickling (Hist, oj Norfolk, vol. vi., p. 384, 8vo.). Philip Englefield, the husband of the other sister, derived his pedigree, with more probability than for the most part attaches to such remote traditions, from Hasculf de Englefyld, an illustrious Saxon who lived in the reigns of Cnute and Harold Harefoot. It is certain that the family bad been long conspicuous in Berkshire, and Sir Roger, the grandfather of Philip, occurs in Rowe-Mores's Nomina et Insignia with the same coat -armour which is still borne by his descendants. By the marriage with the"], [398, "398 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. heiress of Rossall the Englefields came to have much concern in the affairs of Shropshire. Thomas Englefield, the great-grandson of Philip, often occurs jn the re spectable character of umpire between litigating parties on matters of great importance. \"For that I am your ordinary,\" writes the Bishop of Lichfield to the bailiffs of Shrewsbury, \" ye being under my pastoral jurisdic tion, I exhort and advertise you to remember this holy time of Lent, when every Christen man ought to be in perfect love and charity ; 1 would be right glad to take the pain and labour upon me to come amongst you this easter week, and Thomas Englefield with me at my charges, if ye \" (the bailiffs and town on the one side, and the abbot and convent on the other) \" would remit all your matters and causes to the said Thomas Engle field and me, taking us as indifferent and not partial.\" He was of the Council of Wales (Churton's Life of Bishop Smyth, p. 63) and justice of Chester; was created a Knight of the Bath at the marriage of Prince Arthur, and served the honourable office of Speaker of the House of Commons in 1496 and again in the first Parliament of Henry VIII. His son of the same names adopted the profession of the law, and was called to the degree of serjeant in 1522, was appointed king's serjeant with a pension of \u00a3100 for life in 1524, and three years later was created a Justice of the Court of Common Pleas. But his son Sir Francis1 was destined to exalt his house to the highest dignity, and to sink it to the lowest depth which it ever attained. He was born in the year 1522, and early attached himself to the fortunes of the Princess Mary. How greatly that princess appreciated his services may appear from her letter in Fox, to the protector Somerset, 27 June, 1549, in which she complains heavily that the counsel had sent for \" master Englefield her servant.\" \" I suppose,\" she says, \" that I shod not have been used so ungently 1 He accompanied Hen. VIII. to the siege of Boulogne."], [399, "THE ISLE, ANCIENTLY UP ROSSALL. 399 at your hands, in sending for him, upon whose travail doth rest the only charge of my whole house : whose absence therefore shall be to me and my said house no little displeasure.\" He even suffered imprisonment for hearing mass in her house. But on King Edward's decease he reaped the advantage of his adherence to his mistress, being constituted Privy Counsellor, and promoted to the great and lucrative office of master of the wards. These brilliant prospects were dissipated by the accession of Elizabeth, when not able to endure the demolition of everything worthy, in his sight, of religious veneration, he obtained the Queen's licence to travel into foreign parts. The machinations of the English exiles rendered necessary the statute of fugitives in the 13th of this reign, by which every native or free denizen of the realm departing from the same without licence, or who having licence, shall not return within six months after its expiration, was to forfeit the profits of his lands during life. In consequence of this Act an Inquisition was on the 29th of October in her 15th year (1573) taken at Shrewsbury on the oaths of Richard Lyster, gent., and others, before Sir Andrew Corbett, knt., Robert Nedham and Roland Lacon, Esqrs., by which it was found that Sir Francis Englefield remains abroad in contempt of the Queen and against the form of the statute, and that at his departure he was seised in his demesne as of fee in the following lands and tenements.

In the 28th year of her reign (1585), and on the 8th of August, she granted to Humfrey Foster and George Fitton, gentlemen, a tenement in Up Rossall and Udlington, late in the tenure of Richard Sandford, gent., deceased, and now of Humphrey his son, ofthe annual rent of \u00a38 6s. 8d., to hold to them for forty years.

The wife of Humphrey Sandford last mentioned was a Lascelles, and this purchase was, I apprehend, in trust for the Sandford family, for on the 20th of May, 4 Jac. I., 1606, the said vendees, by the names of Sir Thomas Lascells of Brakenburghe, co. York, and Edward Burton of Whenby, in the said county, Esq?., demise their capital messuage in Up Rossall, otherwise the Isle of Rossall, to Humphrey Sandford of the same place, Esq., for 21 years, at the yearly rent of \u00a330. In a bill filed by this last gentleman in 1609 concerning the Isle pool, he states the conveyance of the Isle farm from the Queen to Crompton, &c, and from them to Owen, &c, whose interest, he says, is now by good conveyance vested in himself; and from that period his descendants have continued in the un interrupted possession of this estate, to which they have by subsequent purchases annexed the whole of this beautiful property bounded by the river Severn, and comprised under the denomination of the Isle. The family of Sandford of the Isle is an early offset from the ancient family of the same name, which has been seated at the place from which they derive their appellation. Nicholas Sandford of Calverhall, third son of Nicholas, lord of Sandford, temp. Edw. III., was the ancestor of this branch. His descendants allied them selves to some of the most respectable families in Shropshire, and became possessed of numerous, though dispersed, and not very productive estates. The Lee, Edgeton, Bayston, and Allfield were their ancient in heritance or matrimonial acquisitions. Yet the family seems never to have been in affluence, and about the middle of the 16th century to have sunk into distress ful circumstances, such as are with difficulty reconcile-"], [402, "402 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. able to the undoubted fact of their landed estates. Thus Humphrey, the heir apparent of the family, was glad to accept the humble office of resident abroad with Sir Francis Englefield, and his occasional messenger into England on the domestic affairs of that illustrious exile, or on concerns connected with the safety of the State ; and this employment, to which he was recom mended by his maternal uncle, the celebrated Edmund Plowden, and which demanded a rare union of courage, fidelity, discretion, and dispatch, was the ultimate cause of his posterity becoming possessed in perpetuity of this delightful residence. But they had to struggle with numerous difficulties arising from the res angusta domi ; and a narrative of the cruel manner in which Mr. H. Sandford's well grounded expectations of a recompense for his perilous and delicate services Were at one time, to all appearance, in danger of being defeated by the treachery and ingratitude of Mr. Francis Englefield, the nephew and heir of his patron, is an interesting document, which will make a proper appendix to the present article. Some letters from Sir Francis and his secretary Dyer to one Humphrey Sandford are subjoined, which partly elucidate some of the trans actions referred to above. The survey of the manors of Up Rossalle and Udlington by John Lovell, steward for Mr. Francis Englefield, 1587, states the former to lie within the hundred of Forde within the liberties of Shrewsbury, and parish of St. Chad, to be sur rounded by the Severn, except about twelve score yards, and therefore to be called the Isle of Rossall, and to be in circuit about three miles, and to contain about 401 acres and a halt of the statute of Winchester, accompting fyve score to the hundreth. The manor house hath bene scituate in a certen ground there now called by the name of the orchard, yt hath bene moted about, and no buildinge nowe remayneth. Udlington also semeth in tymes past to have bene a mannor, for there ys a place where a manor house (as yt semeth) hath bene scituate.

The old house of the Sandfords at the Isle, which is now the farm house contiguous to their present mansion house, contains several hiding holes and secret rooms, as is usual in the houses of Roman Catholics. Over the fire-place of an upper room is a large plain crucifix. This was the residence of old Richard Sandford, as mentioned in Mr. Blunden's MS., and of his son Humphrey, the agent of Sir Francis Englefield ; but in the orchard near this house is a large quadrangular area surrounded on three sides by a deep moat and lofty rampart ; the fourth side, which overhangs the river, is defended by the precipice. It is so different from the sites of most castellated mansions which 1 have seen, that I should be almost tempted to suppose it some remains of the Romans, but that the survey of 1587 expressly states it to have been the manor house, and that immediately contiguous to the south side of it is a field called the Chapel Hill, and the rudiments of an oblong pit lying due east and west with a few red stones, which appears to have been the ancient chapel, which, according to tradition, was burnt down at the Reformation, being set fire to by a woman indignant at the idea of its falling into the hands of the Protestants. This area was, no doubt, the ancient residence of tha Rossalls."], [404, "HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. 404 It would be uninteresting to pursue the history of the remaining property within the Isle, from its separa tion by the forfeiture of Sir Francis Englefield to its re-union by the late Humphrey Sandfoid Esq.,1 the first person since the extinction of Englefield's interest, who was proprietor of the whole. I may briefly mention that the remainder, which on that event became the property of William Emarton, was ultimately vested in Seymour, whose descendant sold it to Mr. John Stanier for the benefit of Mr. Sandford last mentioned, who, in 1748 becoming possessed of the present mansion house, greatly improved it and made it his residence.

He & I fell again to talk of Mr Englefilds matter, bad & advised him to see it stayed. I faith, said he, I wished & do wish well to Mr Sandford, & have intreated for him. But for Mr Cole, Mr Englefild careth not. Mr Englefild hath money, Cole is a beggar. Well, said I, if he hath money, he may better bestow it : and tell him this from me : let him look about him : & that I do not hold him unwise, indiscreet, or foolish in this action: (for wiser men than he may deserve sometimes these terms) but tell him that he is stark mad. And now hence forth 1 began to advise my aunt, my cozen Cole, & others my countrymen ; \u2014 did in truth draw instructions & other neces sary things for them, & then did indeed (to obtain favour for my cozens) join with the earl, & the premisses considered I ask you whether I had not cause. And in Easter Term 1 shewed myself open in the cause before Sir Walter Myldmay & my Lord Chief Baron, where order was taken against Engle fild : my aunt Sandford, cozen Sandford, Cole 4j all the Shropshire men, by directions from the Queen, stalled in pos session of their several livings, volens, nolens, Mr Englefild. Now waileth he against me in sundry places, spareth not to give out all untrue & slanderous speeches of me : saith that I have been of his counsell, & falsely & untruly betrayed his secrets, & am now of councell against him : that yet it maketh no great matter ; that I am but a knave, a fool, an ass, & un learned. These words somewhat troubled & moved me : and whom would they not ? Men are men, and will not abide hard & untrue speeches. The silly worm, being trodden upon, turneth back & would bite. But perchance he may say I am a shrewd fool, & have too much learning for him.

I wish that he should know that my land in every respect is as good as his : that I am descended of as honest parentage (though not as rich nor worshipfull) as he is, which I confess to be most worshipfull: yet honesty may as well rest in a mean family as in a worshipfull and when point of honesty cometh in question, men must not be judged by themselves; but the country where he dwelleth must & will judge it. I have been a dweller, a householder, a dealer in Shropshire, where I was born, by the space of 14 years. I do not doubt but I can bring there as good testimony of my sound, good, & honest dealing (I thank God for it) as Mr Englefild can of his; & how I have carried & behaved my self in Barkshire you yourself know, & let the country judge. That I was of his councell, falsely &; untruly betrayed his secrets. I must & do confess that I was of his councell for his lease, & advising him to take the lease, & think it not un necessary to shew what I did therein. First. I was in Shropshire when he meant to take this lease, upon Easter day in the morning 29 Eliz. I recieved his letter at Plowden requesting to survey such lands & woods as were Sir Francis's in Shropshire. I had fully appointed & determined my business to set my days before : and was then in the country about a weighty cause betwixt Mr Meysey & his son to be had before the Councell then being at Beawdley : and except I should lose 4 or 5 days in the beginning of Easter term, I could not do it : but my love & good will towards him & his mother was such that to have pleasured them I would have lost the whole term. I resolved to turn back from Beawdley to the Isle, & so did : spent 3 days in surveying, put my uncle Sandford's tenants, whom he after, badly re- quited, to great charges, & myself was at charges lyeing 2 nights by the way, the one going, the other coming ; & being there, was at some charge, which I bestowed, of curtesy i confess, not ot necessity. So the journey, besides my travail, cost me near sixty shillings out of my purse. I returned Mr Englefild a perfect survey written with my own hand. At my coming to London my advice was also required, whether Mr Englefild might take the lease, & how he should raise the money to pay Dowglasse. I gave my advice & councell there- in also, & wished he should go through : & shewed my opinion how money should be raised. Then, when the lease should be made, it was in the vacation, & I at Burfield, not of councell with the drawing, nor setting forth the particulars. The lease was drawed, penned, & perused by Mr Englefylds councell at London, who were the drawers, & allowed by the queens"], [428, "HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. 428 councell. The draught paper so penned & perused, sent down to Englefild, & his mother, Mr Vachell, and some other of his frinds\u00b0shuld see it, it beinge at E'gl' : mr Vachell who had some good opinion of me sent tor me to come to Englefild from Burfild, I came, the lease shewed, my opinion asked how I thought of it yf this lease (quoth I) passe in this forme Mr Engl : is vndone for he must rayse money of woods & here is noe power or authority to fall any other then vsuall coppies & his nessassary botes, and soe it was in deed & shewed the reason, why then said they amende it yf you can And then take inke and pap' and ev' make it as it ought to have beene, and soe it shuld have passed backe to london, nay (said I) I am a yonge man no reason, when it hath passed so great lerned mens hands that I shuld correct it alone, I pray you send it to Mr farmer who now Mr Fl - is dead is and well may be accompted father of the lawe, lett him alsoe see and p'use it they assented, intreated Mr Walter hildesley & me to goe to m' farm ; we did ; had of m' farm' great intertainment, he spent great time in consideringe of the points, fond them as I said, and soe they were fully amended and the Booke sent backe to london, and in this iourney I spen' three dayes. When the booke came whom to london and brought to Mr Engl: counsel they agreed the lawe to be as I tooke it; and were inforced to amend theire p'ticulares accordingely & soe the booke passed. But here before I goe any further I must tell you that after the booke Came fro' Mr ffarmer and me there was a c'tein p'viso w'hout or privity put into the booke w0\" in effect de- stroyed all thet we had done and yt was thus we had passed to Mr Eng : all such trees as grew vpon the p'miss &c. but such as shold be marked by the queenes srveyor before martin- mas then next after for tymber Now the Queenes Counsell or my Lo : Thr' : added this p'viso But yf all were not m'ked then all excepted Mr Eng : and his Counsell made heervnto privy suffered the booke so to passe and therin I blamed the' very much yf I had seene yt before yt had passed I wold have eaten my fyngers afore yt shoud haue passed my handes And so an ill hearbe put in the pot full of pottage destroyed yt all.

Good Mr Vachell, I commende me most hartely unto you. Where as you moved me, at your last being at Englefyld in the behalf of Mr h. Sandford, to stand so good unto him as 1 might, myne owne liability considered: synce when I mett him at the yle of Rossall, where upon conference had with me towching his present relieffe, he seemeth greatly d-scontentyd with my aunswere. And therfore dowbting less the matter wylbe misreported unto you, wherby I may be condemned before the trouthe be harde, I have here sent you (as fair as I can remember) a true report of my offers unto him, which to me thoughe they seemed reasonable, yet synce herein I may be thought no indifferent judge, I wyll referre my self to your indifferency whither he or I seme parciall in our opinions j desyring you, yf the offers which I have made him do seme to your judgement reasonable, then to satisfye him your opinion herein ; and also for the satisfaction of Mr Blunden,1 whom especially I desyre to leave thoroughly perswaded of my good disposition towards his kynsman. I pray you, eyther shew or send him this my letter (yf you thynke so good, else not). The offers which I made him, proceeding from tbe meere good wyll I beare him, as also upon the motion of your self & son other good friends to us both, but in especiall in consideration of the good & faythfull service done by him to my old uncle, were thes. Fyrst I proferyd to give him 10u a yeare so long as his father lyveth, the payment wherof to begyne at our lady day next : and my seise to abyde the charge & hazarde of removing his father : wherof I have caused to stand in no small dowbt o' for I perceave he intendeth to stand to his old leasse, and to make a complaint to my L : Threasorer of me ; which yf he do, yt is not unlykely in respecte of his age & impotency, that the possession wylbe orderyd to him for his lyffe : the which pension I promised to amende when so ever yt should please god to better my present estate, which, as your self well knoweth, my condition consyderyd, is lytle better than his. I assured him farther that yf at any tyme I should obteyne the possession of all my uncles lands by vertue of any conviiaunce or otherwyse (the which he challengeth to be brought to pass especially by his meanes) than would I be as good to him as by my promise to Mr Plowden I stande any waies bounde in honesty to performe, which, as I take yt, was none other but 1 Andrew Blunden of Burghfield, co. Berks, writer of the preceding account: he was son of Richard Blunden, by Joan, daughter of Humphrey Plowden, and sister of the great lawyer."], [433, "THE ISLE, ANCIENTLY UP ROSSALL. 433 that I would lett him have an estate for his owne lyffe, without syne, of the howse & demeaynes of RossaU now in his father's possession : and for his better assurance that myne intention is not to starte one iote from my promise, thoughe yt were made but in my infancye, I proferyd him to enter into what bonde he would reasonably demand. I was lett to understand by M Blunden that those things old M* Sandford holdeth in the yle were not worth above 30\" by the yeare, the which I take to be hardely valued enoughe ; wherof the rent to the Quene being 12\", & the annuity which I offeryd him 10\" there remayneth clearely to my purse of yearly rent not above 8h the which, thoughe yt be not much, yet wyll yt be som whit towards my present charge, the which by the taking of this my lease is many waves encreased (and not lykely to be diminisshed when yt shall please God to send me a wyffe) out of which lease I have not one penny of yearly revenew more then the old rent which is payd to the quene, over & above which the rent is encreased about 40\" a yeare for the wodd soile. All thes yearly charges yf I should not provide to be countervayled with an yearly revenew, I may quickely be brought upon my knees. But as I perceavyd by Mr Sandford he expected that presently I should have put him in possession of all those things his father hath, and thereof to have made him a lease for certen yeares or his lyffe upon a syne : the which in three respects I was loath to doe. Fyrst & especially for the charge which I receavyd from my uncle for grauntyng any leases. Secondly, yf I should go throughe with the marriage wherof I am now in speache here in Shropshire with Mr Lacon's daughter, as my uncle can lett you know more at large, yt wylbe requyred to have the same made a Joynter howse, And lastely, a syne wyll not servie my torne for the defraying of my yearly charge so well as an yearly rent. Mr Sandford perhaps thynketh my wodds wyll yeald me a great yearly commodity; all which you know I must cutt downe for the payment of my detts, for discharge wherof I pray God they may suffice, and to leave sufficient upon the land for necessary uses. This have I discovered unto you syncerely the whole troth of Mr Sandford's so great discontent ment, the which perhaps happeneth by reason his expectation of present comyng to the yle of Rossall is so much frustrated, rather then upon any dislyke he can have of the anuity, the which is so large as I thynke of all the servants my uncle Sr ff Eng. had, there was not 3 in England unto whom at his departure he gave more : and what difference in liability there was betweene Sr ffra. than, & my self now, I leave to be con-"], [434, "434 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. syderyd by you.

I se he meaneth to amende the pension when god shall better his estate, and so a full determination he shall never have the farme, but father & son shalbe trust out, and Mr Plowdens owne syster ; Mr Plowden is well recompensed for his goodnes towards them : thynke you he is not ?

Yor owne assueryd you knowe who, and where. These letters prove the esteem and regard of Sir Francis towards the person to whom they are addressed. How much he was employed in confidential transactions by Sir Francis appears further from his examination before Chief Baron Manwood, 19 Feb., 1589, 32 Eliz. (i.e., 1589-90), in which, styling himself Hums. Sand ford of Up Rossall, gent., he deposed that he knew Sir Francis Englefield about eight or nine years beyond seas ; that Sir Francis made an assurance of his land to the use of his nephew Mr. Francis Englefield, which assurance he thinks was made by Mr. Plowden, and sent in a letter beyond seas. Who delivered it to Sir Francis he does not certainly remember ; but it came from one Mr. Thomas Wotton, then at Antwerp, and was at Rome delivered to the hands of the said Sir Francis Englefield as of this examinate himself. It was drawn in paper by Mr. Plowden's clerk Harrington, and at Rome engrossed in parchment by Edmund Dyer, Sir Francis Englefield's clerk. It was sealed and delivered by Sir Francis to the use of his nephew, to the hand of this examinate, as he thinketh, at Rome, in the English hospital about the end of February or in March, in the 18th year of her Majesty's reign [1575-6]"], [443, "THE ISLE, ANCIENTLY UP ROSSALL. 443 as he thinketh,- in the presence, as he remembreth, of Dr. Allen, Dr. Hewys, Dr. Bavand, Dr. Brombrow, Dr. Morris, Dr. Henshaw, Edmund Dyer, John Ingram, and divers others. And in the same conveyance was contained a proviso, that if Sir Francis did deliver or send a ring of gold to his said nephew Francis Engle field, to the intent to frustrate the said conveyance, then it should be void. The following paper will serve to throw some light upon the character of young Mr. Englefield. It seems to be a draft of a letter from Humphrey Sandford to Sir Francis, in answer to his of the 25th of April, 1583.1 I shewed hym your letter dated the of withoute making any privie therto but hym seise He seemyd very glad therof, because he understood not yours to hym of the same date, & after shewed the same to me^& cravyd myne opynion for the better understandinge therof upon conferance with yours to me.

Mr. Humphrey Sandford has kindly com municated the following remarks on this point : \u2014 \" I am at a loss to discover upon what evidence Eyton arrives at such a result. I never heard of such a mill, which could scarcely have been found here even at Domesday, on the Severn, without leaving some trace behind ; but I believe it to be impossible that on such a river, liable to rise not unfrequently a yard in a few hours, any mill could have ever been erected suitable for local habitation and worked on the level of the stream. I have little doubt that for ! Aitone ' should be understood ' Yeaton,' in the parish of Baschurch, on the opposite side of the Severn, where there are now on the Perry two mills in excellent working order, and one or two more mills in the adjoining parish of Fitz. I am further confirmed in my opinion by the Survey of John Lovett 1587, 'for as much as concerneth the manors of Up Rossall and Udlington, taken by him, Steward for Mr. Francis Englefield, of all his lands in the comity of Salop,' in which Survey occurs the following entry : \u2014 j (Richard Sandford Gent, holdeth one Water Mill there Y f one p'cell of Meadow cons di' acr'. and the moytie of 37s. one Close in Yeagdon cont' 10 acr' and payeth yearly 10 acres! the Rent which he hath received for the Mill alone di' j of Mathew Baugh was 91 Bushells of Corn by the year Item for one third part of an Improvem' out of the _, Heath by Mr. Hough called the Heath Croft cons ,' ?,', about 2 acr' and renteth p' ann' ... ... ...J Mr. Sandford has also communicated the following note, showing the acreage of the townships of Up Rossall and Down Rossali previous to the Inclosure of Rossall Heath in 1831 : \u2014 BEFORE INCLOSURE 1831.

In one of those disputes concerning their property, to which near neighbours are so peculiarly liable (it related to the manorial rights over Rossall Heath), the advocate for Mr. Sandford, who stood in the place of the Engle fields, writes : \u2014 \" Rossall had two daughters, whereof Inglefield married the elder, and Stury \" \u2014 who was now contending to be lord ofthe heath \u2014 \"the yonger : & farr unlicklie yt is that the yonger should have more part or freedome in the heath then the elder : the elder having a goodlie, greate, & auncient howse in Up Rossall, where the ruinges are yet to be seene at this daye.\" The penner of this memorandum would not have admitted the hereditary descent of his adversary Stury from the family of Roshale, if he had not believed it to be an indisputable fact ; yet no proof of it has occurred to me, and all evidence is in direct opposition to its truth. It is certain that neither of the daughters of Roshale married a Stury ; nor are there any traces that Lady Dagworth left issue by either of her husbands. But supposing her to have done so, and supposing the Sturies to be descended by females from such an alliance, it seems to be* quite certain that it could have conveyed to them no property in Down Rossall. Three carucates1 and a half in Rosela were holden at the time of Domesday, as we have seen, by the Church of St. Chad, and occupied under it by two radmen and seven bordars. it was rated to the Danegeld at an hide.

This was the rent, I presume, paid by Terum and Blechley for the lordship. This is the earliest notice I have found of the family of Stury as connected with Rossall, and it conveys no information as to the manner in which they became possessed of it. The paper quoted at the head of this account says : \u2014 \" Downe Rossall was not a complete thing heretofore, for one Witcherley of Bicton, Burche of Bicton, and Onslowe of Onslowe had houses and tenements in Downe Rossall, and other more, not pay ing any rent to Stury, for all which Stury gave land in other townships, as Bicton, Onslowe &c : and some of these men, and others had as much land in Downe Rossall as Stury, and in memory of man\" (this account was written about 1651), \"some of these exchanges were made.\" Probably one of them succeeded Blecheley as farmer of the lordship under the Deanery of St. Chad, and his posterity continued so to hold it, and at length, after the dissolution, acquired the full property of it. I find a John Stury of Rossall in 1 Richard III. and 15 Hen. VII., and another, for it could hardly be the same person, denominated John Sturi of Nedur Rossale, Esq., in the 8th of Hen. VIII. From him the descent is clear and uninterrupted. In the valuation ofthe possessions of St. Chad 2 Edw. VI. (1547) part of the income of the prebend of Rossall consisted of rent of land in the tenure of Thomas Styrrie, 4s, 8d., and the ferm of all tithes there in the holding of the same Thomas, valued by the year at 26s. 8d.] The family at length terminated in females, who first raised money upon, and finally alienated the 1 [This valuation was at the Dissolution of St Chad's College.

Thus the Rossalls appear to have had nothing to do with Down Rossall ; and much of it seems to have been occupied, under the church, by a multitude of small freeholders, the descendants, perhaps, of the radmen and bordars of Domesday. A few notes of deeds by some of these persons comprise all the information we possess concerning the place at this time ; and a com parison of these may enable us to conjecture, for we can do no more, how the Sturys, who enjoyed the spot for several centuries, came originally into possession.

In 1636, Carew Sturye, lord of Down Rossall, filed his Bill in Chancery against Humphrey Sandford of Up Rossall, John Cole, and Eleanor Cole, widow. Sturye complained that Down Rossall heath was one of the townfields of Down Rossall, and that defendants had got possession of the title deeds which proved the heath to be parcel of the manor of Down Rossall, and claimed right of common in thc heath. The Deposition of Witnesses were taken 20 July, 1636. In 1650, Elizabeth Stury and Rachell Stury (then a minor), thc daughters and coheirs of Carew Stury, who had died about a year before, filed their Bill in Chancery against Lettice Cole, widow, and John Cole her son, Humphrey Sandford and Richard Sandford his eldest son, lor interrupting and hindering plaintiffs when they and tlieir tenants had attempted to plough up and sow Down Rossall Heath, alias the Small Heath. The defendants' Answers are dated 26 April, 1650. They asserted that the heath belonged, half to Lettice and John Cole, and half to Humphrey Sandford, and denied that it ever belonged to Carew Stury or any of his ancestors as parcel of thsir demesne of Down Rossall. Humphrey Sandford died in 1654, aud Richard Sandford his san put in his Answer on 16 May, 1657. The Depositions of the witnesses show that the Sandfords had constantly jut gorse and depastured their cattle, sheep, and swine on the heath without interruption from the Sturys. On one occasion, however, it appears that Walter Stury cut down a \" Swynestie \" erected by John Cole, whereupon Cole retaliated and cut down a barn built by Stury ; for this Stury commenced a Suit in the Court of the Marches against some of Cole's tenants, but Cole would not let them appear, aud they were arrested and kept in custody at Ludlow 18 weeks, when Cole procured their release, and recovered damages for their imprisonment. It is also noticed that near the Isle gate there was a May pole reared, and shooting butts made by one David Grannowe, who sold ale there There was also a \" Somer poole \" set up upon the heath, and a \" harbour \" about the same, where \" the yonge people of Uppe Rossall did usually disport themselves.\" In 1690 there was another Sui. about Rossall Heath, between Waring and Gosnell, The Heath was finally enclosed in 1833. \u2014 Ed.]"], [457, "457 SUTTON.

The old value of the Manor was 12s. ; now it is worth 16s.\" Between 1141 and 1155 Ivo Pantulf gave to Shrewsbury Abbey the site of a mill under Sudton on either side of the water. This grant was confirmed by Henry II. in 1155, and renewed by Hugh Pantulf his son early in the 13th century. In 1234 the Abbot of Shrewsbury and the Prior of Wenlock came to an agreement about certain matters of dispute, but chiefly about the mill under Sutton. In 1240 the Prior of Wenlock"], [458, "458 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. conceded to Shrewsbury Abbey the mill of Sutton, at an annual rent of 8 marks. In 1291, the Prior of Wenlock's temporalities in Sutton were valued at \u00a32 10s. 8d. per annum; in 1535-6, at \u00a311 7s. In 1541-2, the Manor of Sutton was valued at \u00a37 13s. 4d. annually, and the water-mill there at \u00a32. (Cf. Eyton vi., 363-5). The Manor of Sutton, together with the lands and the advowson, seem to have continued in the Mackworth family until about the year 1770, when they passed to Thomas Hill, Esq., of Tern Hall. His eldest son, Noel Hill, Esq., was created in 1784 Lord Berwick, and from him they have descended to the present Lord Berwick, who is lord of the manor and owner of Sutton. A pedigree of the Mack worths, showing the descent of the estate iu that family, will be found in the Transactions, 2nd Series, i., 390, &c. The parish contains 703 acres, and includes four farms and a corn mill. The population in 1801 was 45, in 1881, 74, and in 1891, 52. A shore distance from the Church is the once famous Sutton Spa, formerly much resorted to in cases of scrofula, but which is now comparatively seldom used. Its waters are chalybeate. In 1327, the following were assessed to the Lay Subsidy, under Suttone *. \u2014 John le Reue, Richard fil' Richard, John le Cartar, Thomas le Foremo', Philip Godberd, Peter Gerard, Richard de Leton, Nicholas de Parkes, Henry Meth', Richard Begets, Alan de Wyrcestr, John Reygner, and Reginald de Graston. In the lists of Trained Soldiers of Shropshire in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, Sutton is classed with Betton, Longnor, and Alkmere; and these townships together furnished 11 soldiers in 1580, and 18 in 1587. Amongst them occurs Thomas Mackworth, gent., the owner of Sutton. (Us. Transactions, 2nd Series, ii., 281 ; iii., 143). In 1757, the names of Margaret Harper, William Boycot, Thomas Edgerley, Richard Breathen, Richard Scolbock, David Jones, and James Hartshorne, occur as inhabitants of Sutton contributing to a voluntary assessment. In 1753-4 there was a law-suit between the Mayor and Corporation of Shrewsbury and the tenants of Sutton, touching the right of the Corporation to appoint a constable for Sutton at the Court Leet. It appears that from 1508 to 1556 Sutton was said to be within the Priory of Wenlock, and that from that year to 1754 a Constable for Sutton had been appointed at the Shrewsbury Court Leet only eight times, viz, in 1586, 1588, 1643, 1649, and 1660 to 1664. In 1602 Sutton was assessed to the Liberties, when money was collected under the Act for raising money for maimed soldiers. In January, 1753, at the Court Leet, William Boycott of Sutton was appointed Constable, but refused to appear and take the oath. The Jury presented this fact in May, 1753, at the Quarter Sessions, and in the following November Boycott was arrested and kept in custody, until Mr. Mack worth's steward entered into a recognizance for his appearance at the next Quarter Sessions. Mr. Mackworth got the Indictment removed to the King's Bench, and the cause was heard at the Lent Assizes in"], [459, "SUTTON. 459 1754, when the Judge ordered the case to stand over till the next Assizes. At the trial the Judge directed the Jury to find a verdict for the defendant, on the ground that the notice to him to attend and take the oath was defective ; so that the question was not tried on its merits. Mr. Mackworth held a Court for his manor of Sutton at the Hall House of Sutton, in October, 1754, when Boycott was appointed Constable. In 1755 the Shrewsbury Court Leet appointed Thomas Edgerley Constable for Sutton, but he refused to attend and take the oath, Mr. Mackworth maintaining that Boycott was the proper Constable. His contention was that Sutton, though named amongst the Liberties of Shrewsbury, and undoubtedly at Domesday in the Hundred of Shrewsbury, was not really in the Liberties, and had never been annexed to them by any royal charter ; that the Hundred and the Liberties were not co-extensive ; and that no submission had been made or offices taken under the nomination of the Town Magis trates or Court Leet.1 The Corporation continued to nominate Constables for Sutton. In 1763, they appointed William Boycott, and in 1764 William Harper, but both refused to take the oath.2 In 1791, they framed an Indict ment against Jonathan Scoltock for refusing to execute the office.3 In 1826, John Bemand of Sutton was summoned to sit on the Grand Jury at Quarter Sessions, but declined ; and, though threatened with proceedings, the case was not pressed out of regard for Lord Berwick, the lord of the manor. So it would seem that the Corporation never actually got a legal decision in their favour, bringing Sutton under their jurisdiction. \u2014 Ed.]. THE CHURCH. [At Pope Nicholas's Taxation of 1291, the Chapel of Sutton was in the Deanery of Pontesbury and Diocese of Hereford. In 1331 the Prior of Wenlock had a pension from the Church of Sutton-juxta- Salop. In 1534-5, \u00a33 of the tithes of Sutton were annexed to the Vicarage of Wenlock. The Chapel is not named iu the Valor of Henry VIII., so was probably then disused, or served by some Chaplain removable at the will of the Prior of Wenlock. The Church, which is dedicated to St. John, is built of stone and consists of a nave, in the Early English style, without chancel or aisles. It is 30 ft. in length, and 19 ft. in breadth. On the north and south walls are three lancet windows, and as many in the east wall. The west end is of red brick, and is modern.

I derive its name from the situation on a lofty bank shelving down to the river : the shelf town ; so we have Leaton shelf. It is written in Domesday Saltone. At that time it was holden by the Bishop of Chester, and under him by the Collegiate Church of St. Chad. It was rated to the Danegeld at an hide and a half. Half a carucate1 was in the demesne, and four villans occupied a carucate1 and half. There was room for two more carucates. In the Feodary of the Liberties of Shrewsbury of an early year, 1 believe the 7th of Edward I., the Dean of St. Chad is stated to have land in Schelton. In the Inquisition of the possessions of St. Chad in 1326, among the tithes belonging to the dean are enumerated a messuage and carucate and the tithe of a noke of land in Schelton. Tithe of other lands in Schelton belonged to certain of the prebendaries of St. Chad, as may be seen in the Inquisition of 1326 of the possessions of that Collegiate Church, and continued so down to the dissolution, when they were leased with the rest of that property to Mr. Beston,2 and ultimately, as I conceive, vested in Sir Christopher Hatton. The Waring papers have preserved several notices of early landholders here, One of the earliest is the family of Goderich. By deed without date Thomas Goderich of Schelton grants to his son Hugh Goderich in free marriage with Alice, daughter of Thomas de Forde, a moiety of all the messuages and curtilages, and a virgate of land in Schelton, which fell to him, the grantor, after the decease of his father : also half a 1 [Not carucate, but ox-team.

Witnessed by Geoffrey Rondulf, John Gamel, Hugh le Dunfowe, Alan de Roshale, and Roger son of Robert Jvoun of Shulton. He was still alive about the 13 Edw. II.

Goderich in Scheltone. The Waring just mentioned, who stands at the head of the Waring pedigree, is there stiled lord of Onslow. He was living in 28 Edw. I., but it is a mistake to consider him as lord of Onslow. That manor was then the property of the family to whom it gave name, and in whom it continued for many subsequent centuries. Warin was but a resident there. His descendants"], [469, "SHELTON. 469 have supposed him to be sprung from the lineage of Warin the bold, sheriff of this county under its Norman earl ; but there is no evidence for this conjecture. He seems to have been a person of decent opulence, but with no pretensions to an origin so lofty. I conceive him to be much more probably the Waring son of Olthef, or, as he is styled in another deed, Warin Algef (so variable was the orthography of that period, and so fast were patronymics sliding into surnames) , who from the evidences of Alberbury Priory had land in the market place of Shrewsbury at a very early but undated period. However this be, Robert, son of Warin de Ondeslowe, or as he is at other times called, Robert Waryng, and Robert Warynges, was settled here as early as the beginning of tbe fourteenth century, Robert's son, Richard Garines, as he is sometimes written, had land here, a messuage and nine acres and an half of land, which after his death descended, I presume by virtue of some entail, to his four sisters : Mabil, the wife of John de Hanewode of Ondeslowe, Agnes, Cicely, and Elena. On Wednesday in the assumption ofthe Blessed Virgin, 15 Edw. III., Hane wode and his wife, by deed witnessed by John Stury and Thos. Colle, then bailiffs of Salop, and Roger Yvon of Shelton, convey their share of the premises to Richard Russel of Salop, to hold in purparty with the other sisters. But if Hanewode parted with a property here which descended from the Warings, his son Roger acquired another from the same quarter; for in 11 Richard II. (1387) Richard Alcoks and Margery his wife, John de Malmeshull and Alice his wife, and Matilda, daughter of Richard Wilkyns del Lithe grant to the said Roger their purparty of a messuage in Shelton which descended to them, the said Margery, Alice, and Matilda, after the decease of Helen, widow of Richard Waring. I suspect that for widow we should read sister, since Richard Waring's widow was Agnes, that Helen was"], [470, "470 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. his sister, and the grantors representatives of the two other sisters, Agnes and Cicely, In the 15th century the Warings increased their consequence in Shelton by becoming lessees ofthe tithes due to St. Julian's Church in that village. In 10 Hen. VI. Roger Yvne \" rector and first master of the College of St. Mary Magdalen de campo belli and rector of the free chapel of St. Julian \" demises to Simon Waryng of Shelton all tithes of sheaves, hay, pease, faitb' (sic), beans, flax, and hemp belonging to the said free chapel and to the rector thereof in the town and fields of Shelton, for twenty years at a rent of 20s. The Warings, it appears, had been accustomed to pay a rent of lOd. to the rector of St. Julian's, for in the following year the same Yve makes a new grant to the same Simon at a rent of 23s., in which the small tithes are included, \" tam garbar' lacticii & omrumod' decimal*' munitar' quam lane & agnar' ac aliar' divers' decim',\" together with the rent just mentioned. I suppose the lOd. due from the Goderichs. Simon's will is dated on St. Luke's Day 1449, in which he devises all his lands and tenements in Shelton, Wodecote, and Frankvyle to his wife Margaret for her life, if she keep herself sole. But he was still living in 35 Hen. VI., 1456, and in prosperous circumstances, as he was then in a capacity to recover possession of lands here which his uncle had been obliged to alienate upon mortgage. By deed of this date, John Phelyppes of Salop, clerk (he was Town Clerk of that borough, and, as I conceive, brother of Roger Phelyppes, warden of Battlefield) , son and heir of Philip Glover (here we see how he acquired the surname of Phelyppes), grants and pledges to Simon Warynge of Schelton the lands and tenements in Schelton which his father Philip had in pledge from John Warynge, son of Richard Warynge, to hold the same in pledge for the sum of \u00a33 13s. 4d., which he, Phelyppes, had received of Simon, with this proviso, that if he shall repay the said sum to Warynge, he or his heirs shall re-enter."], [471, "SHELTON. 471 The Warings still went on increasing their property here, though they ceased to reside upon it. In 5 Edw. IV. John Trentham, Esq., of Salop, grants to Nicholas Waryng of Salop lands in the fields of Shelton, which he had of the gift of Juliana, relict of William Beaton of Salop. Other properties of considerable antiquity appear in the deeds of the same family. By deed dated on the eve of the purification of our lady 23 Edw., Henry Charite, burgess of Salop, granted to Simon Colle, also burgess of the same, land in Shelton. Witnessed by John de Loddelowe, jun.,and Rich. Stury, then bailiffs. This land was still in that line 9 Hen. IV , when John Colle, senior, and John Colle, junior, his son and heir, demise lands in Shelton to Richard Waryng of that place; and in 12 Hen. VI., John Colle of Salop, senior, demises to Simon Waryng of Shelton all his lands and tenements in the town and fields of the said town of Shelton, except Oxdon, Udlynton, and Blakemeres mednes for forty years at a rent of 10s. a year. The family of Yvon was also very ancient here. I conceive them to derive their name from an ancestor of the baptismal appellation of Ivo. Robert Ivon of Shulton occurs as early as 27 Edw. I. impleading the Abbot of Buildwas for common in Monk Meole as appurtenant to his free tenement in Shulton. This process will be more distinctly noticed under the head of Monk Meole1 but one part of the abbot's plea is more properly referable to this place. He pleaded that the name was Shelton, not Shulton. What the effect was which this alleged misnomer had upon the suit does not appear. Roger, the son of this Robert Ivoun, occurs in 34 Edw. I., and again in 15 Edw. III. He is otherwise written Roger Yvons. His daughter and heir Agnes married Richard Launce of Pulley (or Polyley, as it was then called), and had issue only two daughters, Isabel 1 [ Transactions, 2nd Series, iii., 333.\u2014 Ed.]."], [472, "472 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. and Johanna, of whom John Launce of Polyley and Roger Yve (of Murydon, as he is elsewhere called), son of Reginald Yve of Leton. were coheirs in 18 Hen. VI., and these enfeoffed Roger Yve, clerk, the warden, as I suppose, of Battlefield, and Richard Gery, in all their lands in Shelton. Mr. Gery appears to have been the sole person beneficially interested in this feoffment, and to him, by the name of Richard Gery of Clive, did Hugh Gomun of Yokulton release all his right in the premises. The title thus released was, it appears, derived from the family of Yvon. Agnes, the relict and joint executrix of John Yvon, married secondly William Beton. They enfeoffed Master John Gomond in messuages, &c, in Shelton, which he in 19 Hen. VI. granted in tail to Hugh his brother and Agnes, wife of the said Hugh, remainder in tail to Johan, widow of his father John Gomond ; remainder to Thos. Lodelowe, Abbot of Salop, and his successors for ten years, and, if the abbot can get licence to hold them, in perpetuity. The seal to this deed is a coat of arms, two bows, in chief three lions heads erased, inscribed \" sigillum iohan nis ap howel.\" In 14 Edw. IV., Richard Gery, son and heir of Richard Gery, formerly of Salop, sold his lands in Shelton to Nicholas Waring, merchant of the staple. There appears to have been a great oak at Shelton standing on the same spot where the present oak now grows, in 1543, when Adam Waring wrote a long paper entitled \" How the gret oke at Shelton standeth on my grounde.\" He states that Thomas Davis bis tenant, declared that he hath hard his fader and other auncyent men dwelling in Shelton long agoo, saye, thet in tyme paste long agoo, the highe wayne way fro' my house in Shelton (where ye sd Tho. now dwelleth) unto the market & fylds &c. was throughe the grounde that is now the folde or course ageauste the gret mansion there, be longing now to Ric.

WELBACH, with Whitley, makes one township in the parish of St. Chad. The name I derive from a well or fountain of water, expanding with a bach or small brook. Welbach has, therefore, the same signification as Welbeck ; and, in fact, in Domesday it is written Huelbec.1 It was possessed in the Saxon times by one Hunninc, a free man, and the same, I believe, who held Rossall and some other estates in this neighbourhood ; and who enjoyed the rare felicity of continuing to retain a part of his property after the Conquest. This was not the case, however, with Huelbec. That was included in the grant to Earl Roger, who before the time of the Domesday survey had bestowed it upon one of his chief vassals, Roger, son of Corbet, under whom it was immediately occupied by one Ranulf;2 perhaps Ralph de Mortimer, to whom it would be verv convenient on account of its contiguity to his manor of Meole. It was assessed to the Danegeld at one hide, and if we are implicitly to follow the terms of Domesday, it had made no progress in cultivation since the introduction of that hateful impost ; for no other land is mentioned than one carucate3 in the demesne. But as, besides two servants, who, I suppose, tilled that carucate for the benefit of Ranulf, there appear to have been also as many bordars, I conceive there must have been some portion of arable land for their use. Here was also a mill, but the supply 1 [Hartshome and Eyton state that in Shropshire bach or batch signifies a valley, and not a beck or little brook. \u2014Cf.

I find nothing further of this place till the Iter of Hen. III. (1255), in which it is found that Sir Qdo de Hodenet held Wulbech, in the hundred of Condover, of Fulke fitz Warin for one hide. In what manner it passed from Corbet to Fitz warin does not appear.1 The former family was of longer standing in the county by nearly a century than the latter, who do not appear in any of the lists of our landholders before the reign of Hen. II. That monarch provided for Fitz Warin as well as he could ; but the great estates of the county were already occupied, and the new comer was obliged to be content with such scraps and fragments as he could collect, and to hold some ofthe principal of them not by the most honourable tenure, in chief of the Crown, but as tenant paravail under some mesne lord. Thus he held his first great seat of Alberbury under the baronial house of Corbet, and I suspect that Whel bach was also holden in the same manner, and of the same baron. But the Fitz Warins were themselves anxious to obtain the distinction of mesne lords, having vassals holding from them, which, previously to the statute of Quia Emptores, was practicable in an infinite gradation, and therefore, as we see, they granted out Whelbach to the family of Hodnet, with whom, as appears not only from their romantic history, but from more authentic documents, their connection was early and lasting. It is observable that the Hodnets held Westbury of the fee of Caus. Their line ended in a daughter Maud, wife of Sir William de Ludlow, and, as I conceive, of William le Wyne, probably a native of Wales. 1 [Eyton states that about 1203-4, William fitz Walter conveyed to Robert de Gatacre certain nokes of land, held of the Fee of Alber bury. He thinks that these nokes were in Welbatch, and that Welbatch was of the Fee of Alberbury, and was held by Fitz Warin under Corbet of Caus, the Seigneural Lord of Welbatch. Cf. Eyton vl, 119.\u2014 Ed. j."], [486, "486 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES In 14 Edw. II. (1320) a fine was levied ofthe manors of Westbury, Whelbache, and Espeleye, to the use of William le Wyne and Maud his wife for life, remainder to Laurence de Ludlow (son of WiUiam de Ludlow) and Hawise his wife, in tail, remainder to John, son of William le Wyne, in tail, remainder to the right heirs of Maud. The place continued in the Ludlows to the extinction of their line. Sir Richard Ludlowe, knight, at his death, 23 Dec., 1498, is found seised of the manors or lordships (inter alia) of Witley and Welbatch. His grand-daughters Anne and Alice, wives of Thomas and Humphrey Vernon, were his heirs. George Vernon of Hodnet, son of Humphrey, died 1554 seised of a moiety of the manors of Whittley and Whalbach, holden of John Stovyll, as did his son Richard Vernon in 1590 of the same moieties holden of the heirs of Fulke Fitz warren. Of John Stovylle I can give no account. By what mesne conveyances Welbach passed from the Vernons I have not seen; but the next person whom I find possessed of it is Richard Owen, gent., Chamber lain of Shrewsbury (of which Corporation he served the office of Bailiff in 1562 and other years), second brother of the Judge. He died 25 Oct., 1594, seised of \"a capital messuage in or near the town of Salop,\" so it is styled in the Inquisition after his death, \" called Whitley hall, and 3 messuages, two hundred acres of land, ten of meadow, an hundred of pasture, twenty of wood, &c, in Shrewsbury, Francvyle, Whitley, and Whelbach, holden of the heirs of Fulke Fitz warren by fealty alone.\" The Owens of Whitley continued to reside upon this estate for more than a century, and are not, I believe, yet extinct, though their pedigree is to me somewhat indistinct. But on the 25th of January, 1715, William Owen, gent., of Whitley, in consideration ofthe sum of \u00a33,730, sold \"Whitley hall or Whitley farm,\" as it is termed in the conveyance, \" and messuages and lands in Whitley and Whelbach and in the townships or parishes"], [487, "WELBACH AND WHITLEY. 487 of Condover, Brace Meole, and St. Chad, to William Turner, draper, and Alderman of Shrewsbury.

[In the Testa de Nevill, circa 1240, Odo de Hodenet, son of Baldwin, is stated to hold half a knight's fee in Welbach, under the Barony of Hugh de Kilpec, which Eyton thinks is incorrect. An Inquisition taken 15 Feb., 1284, on the death of Sir Odo de Hodenet, states that he held Whelbeche under Fulk fitz Warin by service of one-twentieth part of a knight's fee, the estate being worth 54s. per annum. An Inquisition taken 11 Nov., 1316, on the death of William de Ludlow, states that he and his wife Matilda (heiress of the Hodnets) held the vills of Welbache and Moston by feoffment of William de Moston, by service of one-tenth part of a knight's fee. The estate consisted of a messuage, 80 acres of land, a water-mill, and 58s. 6d. rent. (Eyton vi., 120-1). In 2 Edw.

Whitley Farm-house was built by William Owen, and on a stone lintel, as also on an oak staircase, is a shield bearing his arms, and the initials \"W. 0. 1667.\" Between Whitley Farm-house and the Rea-brook is a square moat, 138 feet in area each way, with abundant evidence of having been occupied by a building of some importance. Thc draw-bridge stood at the east end of the south face. This moat may have been the work of some Norman possessor.1 In the adjoin ing meadow on the east side, known as the Chapel Field, were dis covered in 1893 the foundations of an oblong building about 38 ft. by 31 ft , about two feet below the surface. It was 3onstructed of red sand-stone, and scattered about were a number of red clay tiles, with some fragments of roofing flags or shingles. It is probable that these foundations are the remains of a Roman Villa. At a later period the building may have been used as a chapel, although no record of any chapel at Whitley exists.2 At an early date, before 1326, the Canons of St. Chad's became possessed of lands in Whelibach and Whitley.3 In 1549 the vicars choral leased the tithes for 21 years to Humphrey Onneslow, Esq.

This deed, which is among the Waring papers, is attested by Vivian de Roshale and Richard Corbet of Watleburough. It should seem as if this William de Horton thus mentioned as lord of the fee, was brother of the grantor Lucy. I conceive him to be the same, who by the name of William Heorton grants to his daughter Margery a messuage in Woodcote, in a place called Vorlung dyches, between the king's wall and Hogwall and the bruere (heath) of Hanwode. Witnessed by R,oger lord of Ondeslawe. This land descended to Alice, wife of Nicholas de Gatacre, and from her to her son John de Gatacre of Wodecote, who in the 26th of Edward III. granted it to John, son of William de Haghmon of Salop. Of the same family was, probably, Roger de Horton,2 who in the 12th of King Edward (1283-4) grants to Waryn de Andeslowe, who stands at the head of the Waring pedigree, and Alice his wife, a messuage and 1 [At Domesday, Woodcote was a distinct manor, whilst Horton was a member of the Manor of Pontesbury.

H, 21."], [492, "492 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES, half a virgate of land in Wodecote, and a meadow called Le Lutel Ednemos, and a rent of 5s., with the whole lordship, without any reservation in the same vill (cum toto dominio sine aliquo retenemento in eadem villa) 2s. of which rent is to be received from Robert le Sarmoner. Witnessed by Reginald, lord of Hanewode.1 This deed appears not to have been executed, but four years afterwards the substance of it is repeated between the parties, with the exception of the lordship, of which no mention is made. In this last deed, the meadow is written endemos, and the rent is said to issue from the tenement of Robert le Saymoner. That this last deed was executed is certain, because in the 28th of the same King Edward (1300) the said Warin de Ondeslowe and his said wife Alice grant the said messuage, lands, Little Edenemos, and 5s. in Wodecote to their son Robert ; to whom also, in the following year, his brother Roger, styling himself son of Warin de Ondeslowe, releases his right in the premises. In the 19th Edward II, (1325-6) Thomas, son of Hugh de Wodecote, grants a plot of land called le hurne in Wodecote, lying between Ednesmosse and the king's way leading from Salop towards Cawes, to Adam de Bykedon of little Roshale, Isabel his wife, and John their son. From another deed of the following year, it appears that this former instrument was intended to operate us a mortgage; for in 20 Edward II. the said Thomas pledges a letter of acquittance of lands and meadows which the said Adam has of him in the name of pledge in the town of Wodecote to him, his wife and son above-mentioned, for the sum of 20s : on this con dition, that if he, Thomas, repay the money within a time prefixed, the said letter shall be delivered to him ; 1 [By a Fine of 12 Nov., 1240, William le Sermon, tenant of half a virgate in Woodcote, acknowledged William de Horton's claim thereto ; and the latter conceded the land to William le Sermon in fee at a rent of 2s.

The money never was repaid, and the land remained with Bykedon, who being dead in 23 Edward III. (1349-50) his relict Isabel granted her lands in Wodecote, near Horton, to Hugh her son in tail (John we must suppose dead), remainder to his brother William in tail, remainder to her daughters Isabel and Lucy. Land in the town of Wodecote and in Egebaldeham and in the fields of Heywode [qu. HenwodeJ with a parcel (particula) of wood called Wythere mar', was in 40 Edward III. (1366-7) in the possession of Thomas, son of Thomas de Bykedon of Wodecote. Whether any of it was the property conveyed as above to Adam de Bykedon does not appear ; but this Thomas de Bykedon having enfeoffed Richard de Canes of Salop chaplain in all the above premises, they were by him in the same year conveyed to John de Upton of Salop and Benedicta his wife. Adam de Bykedon was not the only person to whom Thomas, son of Hugh de Wodecote, alienated land there. In 17 and 19 Edward II. (1323-4 and 1325-6) he released to Robert son of Waryn (or, as in another deed he calls him Robert Waryng) of Schelton, all his right to land in Wodecote. This last deed is witnessed by Philip Goucbmond of Horton. The land thus released was a messuage and 13 acres, which by deed 13 Edward III. (1339-40) the said B,obert grants to his son Riohard in tail, remainder to Adam, another of his sons. He describes himself to have had them of the feoffment of Thomas, son of Hugh, as afore said. Richard and Adam were two of the younger children of Robert Waryng, who, it appears, must have been, according to the measure of those times, a person of opulence. They were both without issue, and in 40 Edward III. (1366-7) Adam Waryng, calling himself of Wodecote, grants all his lands there to Richard Waryng (his brother mentioned in the former deed) and Richard son of Roger Waryng of Schelton (his"], [494, "494 HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY LIBERTIES. nephew). This was, of course, land of his own acqui sition, as must also have been the (sex landas terre) in Wodecote, which by deed of 1 Richard II. (1377-8) he granted to Sir William de Bottefeld, chaplain. But by the 4th of the same king he had succeeded by the death of his brother Richard to the land in Wodecote entailed on him by his father, for he then granted it to his nephew Richard (son of Roger Waryng of Shelton) and Catharine his wife ; to whom also by the name of Richard Waryng, junior, of Schelton, in 14 Rich. II. , Agnes, tbe widow of his uncle Richard Waryng, senior, of Schelton, released her dower in Wodecote. From this time the Waring estates in Woodcote descend in uninterrupted succession. In 1326 all the tithes of the town of Wodekote belonged to Master Rese as prebendary of St. Chad ; likewise all the tithe of the town of Horton, and half the mortuary, except the house of Nicholas le Milde and except a moiety of all manner of tithes in the fields, which moiety of the sheaves with the hay of the Bin medua belongs to the common stock of the church. Somewhat more of Woodcote and Horton may be seen in the same Inquisition, which it is unnecessary here to transcribe. In 21 Richard II. (1397-8) William EHesmere and William Preston, chaplains, grant to Richard, son of Roger Waryng of Shelton and Catherine his wife for life, all their lands and tenements in Wodecote, which they had of ye said Richard's feoffment, remainder to Simon, son of said Richard in tail, remainder to Roger, brother of Simon, remainder propinquioribus heredibus sanguinis dicti Ric'i filii Rog'i. In 1507 the property of Woodcote was divided between Nicholas Waringe, Thomas Horton, and John Bayly. They then came to the following agreement respecting their several boundaries.

John Hosier, who died 1591, is called of Woodcote, and in Taylor's MS. it is related that in Nov., 1 575, his house there was burned down. Part of the Bayly property was a farm called tho Oak, and this, it should seem, had before 1639 passed from that family to Dorothy Barker of Salop, spinster, to whom, on the 1 2th of July in that year, Edward Poole yeoman, entitling himself of the Oak in the township of Woodcot, grants all his estate and interest in the said farm. I suppose he had some term of years in it. Dorothy Barker was one of the daughters of Richard Barker, Esq. , Recorder of Shrewsbury ; another"], [496, "HISTORY OF SHREWSBURY -LIBERTIES 496 was Mary, successively the wife of Nicholas Waring and Richard Hunt, Esquires, of Shrewsbury. She appears in her second widowhood to have resided at Woodcote, and on the 24th December, 1648, by the name of Mary Hunt of Woodcot, widow, surrendered to her son Richard Waringe, gent., her jointure land in Woodcot. The Oak was not, I presume, included in this jointure land ; but it was then passed from Dorothy Barker to her other sister Elizabeth, widow of Thomas Higgins, D. and M.D., rector ofthe second portion of Pontesbury, who only one week after the last date, viz., 3 Jan. 24 Car. (to within so near a period of his fatal execution were the years of his reign employed in legal instru- ments) by the name of Elizabeth Higgons of Salop, widow, in consideration of 5s. bargains and sells to the same Richard Waringe, then called of Woodcot, land in Frankwell, alias Frankvyle, in the occupation of himself or his tenant, near the lane leading towards Copthorne, and also the Oak farm in Woodcot, for the term of a year. This was, I presume, a lease preparatory to a release, which vested the fee in Mr Waring ; for on the 28th of January, 1654, being then styled of Shrews- bury, he bargains and sells the messuage, farm, or tene- ment called the Oak, heretofore the inheritance of Andrew Bailey, clerk, and John Bailey his son, to Thomas Blakeway, gent., of Cronekhill, in fee for \"a valuable consideration, \"so it is expressed, warranting the same against his own heirs and assigns, and those of Bailey, Dorothy Barker, Elizabeth Fliggins, and his mother Mary Hunt. Livery of seisin was made of the premises to Blakeway in the presence of John Stamir and John Calcott, his brothers-in-law. The purchaser was great-great-grandfather to the compiler of these papers. He then resided at Cronkhill, in the parish of Atcham, where his ancestors are said to have lived as tenants for three centuries. In consequence of a fatal fire which consumed all his property, he was obliged, not many years after the date of this purchase, to retire from Cronkhill, and, I suppose, to sell Oak farm."], [497, "WOODCOTE AND HORTON. 497 On the 8th of May, 1661, Mary Hunt of Woodcot, widow, and Richard Waringe of Salop, gent., mortgaged their messuage, tenement, or farm in. Woodcot, now in their own possession, to Susannah Onslow of Cruckton, spinster, by appointment of Edward Onslow of the same, clerk, in consideration of \u00a3300 advanced by the said Edward. The following letter may be of any date from 1638, when Shrewsbury first had a mayor, to 1683, when Mr. Waring died. But as it speaks of the deed of partition of 1507 as 200 years old, of which at the latest of those dates it would fall short by more than 20 years, it was most likely written towards the close of his life, and shows that the Baylies retained a property here after their sale of the Oak.
