Near the Tiber a Mansion all worn and decay'd, Stands lonely and sullen to sight ; On its turrets on high, batter'd helms were display'd, Now the rank noxious weeds have the trophies o'erspread, Which the Warrior once view'd with delight. Here, Sir Bertram resided, a knight of renown, Who the lance cou'd with energy wield ; And the laurels 'mid Palestine's ruins had won, For mighty in arms he had ever been known ; And he bore the red-cross on his shield A brother he had, his companion in war, Who the Infidels wrath had subdued : Rodolpho his name \u2014 who in fight had no peer, But silent and gloomy \u2014 his look was severe, As the tyger when thirsting for blood. Implacable hate, mark'd his earliest days, Deceitful and false was his soul j Overbearing \u2014 contemptuous \u2014 a glutton of praise, Few dar'd him confront, or his anger to raise, For his spirit cou'd brook no controul."], [17, ":cl IT From the clangor of arms had Sir Bertram retir'd, And Rodolpho was still at his side ; But the Mansion, with envy his bosom inspir'd ; The domain, which Sir Bertram's achievements acquir Touch'd and gall'd his unlimited pride. He his purpose conceal'd. \u2014 Now Sir Bertram display'd All the glitter and splendor of state : His benevolence all with amazement survey'd, But a child, with the charms of a Venus array'd, Crown'd his blessings, and made them complete. This dear lovesome damsel, no mother's fond care Ever witness'd, to shield her from harm ; It was sudden she died, \u2014 poor Elwina the fair ! Now her shade sadly wails thro' the regions of air, Hark ! it shrieks on the wings of the storm! III. To the Mansion the knights came in gorgeous array, And their banners wav'd high to the wind ; From the feast many a dame had gone mournful away, For as Selma was young, fascinating, and gay, They were griev'd such a fav'rite to find."], [18, "12 \\ pale purple tint was sufms'd o'er her cheek, And her lips tipt with coral so bright ; Her eloquent eyes seem'd in silence to speak : \u2014 \u2014 So graceful her step \u2014 her demeanor so meek, That she fill'd ev'ry heart with delight. With such pleasure she smil'd, and her auburn hair O'er her forehead in negligence hung ; And thus to a face so transcendently fair*, Gave a saintly expression : \u2014 but what can compare With the sweetness that fiow'd from her tongue And long, long the knights had her beauty admir'd, And to win her alternately strove : Each still possess'd hopes,\u2014 by the same passion fir'd, But how vain were the thoughts these fond hopes had inspired- For Alqnzo alone had her love. , Alonzo a youth of great prowess In war, And eke he was courteous and kind : His birth taught him no glorious triumph to share, But his conquests proclaim'd him a hero afar, Of a strong and magnanimous mind."], [19, "13 Oft in secret they stole to the cinnamon grove, When the moon shed its silvery light ; There they sigh'd out the transports of innocent love: And the bright twinkling stars in the welkin can prove. How the damsel was lov'd by the knight. But Alonzo had soon from his Selma to part, For the Pagans grew desperate and strong ; From the mansion, the strangers all rose to depart, With Alonzo ; \u2014 for love so deep fixt in his heart, Had his arm with fresh energy strung. So victorious he fought, on the blood-streaming plain, And undaunted 'mid squadrons he ,rode, That many brave youths, by his valour were slain ; While he thought of his Selma, no wounds gave him pain, Now familiar with carnage and blood. IV. Meanwhile, gnawing jealousy rag'd like a fiend, In Rodolpho's insidious breast ; With no infidels wrath he had now to contend, But with passions grown furious \u2014 in youth unrestrain'd3 And with frenzy his forehead he prest. \u00a3-"], [20, "14 \u00ab' Shall he thus in magnificence, glory, and pride, \" His revels eternally keep ? \" And none dare his vain, pamper'd folly deride ; \" Not one injur'd knight, tho' of Selma deny'd, \" Dar'd break this vile hypocrite's sleep.

Near the Cavern, the peasants pronounce in the storm, Sad mysterious forms have been seen ; Dreadful yells have been heard ; and, they spread the alarm, That fell witches and ghosts, midnight revels perform, And then frisk to dire sounds o'er the green. VI. Fair Selma no more near the rampart appear'd, No more at the cinnamon grove ; No more her melodious chantings were heard, In the woodbine-crown'd bower, which Alonzo had rear'd, Where the hero first breath'd out his love. In a dank dreary chamber where no friendly ray, From the skies dissipated the gloom ; Not a lamp's doubtful gleam told where shivering she lay, For affliction had sleep from her eyes chac'd away, From her cheeks was departed the bJoom,"], [22, "16 And oft the black warrior with dark glancing eye, To his wishes had urg'd her consent, Thrill'd with horror, as death-struck, she dar'd not reply, Still unmov'd by her tears, ev'ry art he would try, Which her sorrows did only augment. Two lingering months, had now witness'd her woes, And his suit still the sycophant prest ; \u2014 When, with weeping and wailing, she sunk to repose, A vision terrific, and dreary arose, And thus, solemn the damsel addrest : \u2014 *' Beware of Rodoepho, with crimes now made bold ; Beware of offending just heaven : For Alonzo is thine, as the fates have foretold ; A tale full of horror now hear me unfold, \u2014 Broken vows, maid, are never forgiven.

Like a meteor they fled \u2014 with their prize on before, When her soul gave a tremulous cry : The monsters lash'd on, as they reach'd the sea shore, Where the birds ceaseless scream, and the rude billows roar, And dash the white spray to the sky."], [26, "20 Over mountains, thro' forrests, scenes savage and drear, They hurried and hurried away : When the spectre broke silence, his words stun the ear ; \" We'll soon reach the goal, where thy friends shall appear, \" Long long ere the dawning of day.\" Now the moon shed its light, and his helmet shone bright, He snuff 'd not the gale of the morn, Terrific the Cavern now yawn'd to the sight ; And dire grinning fiends with infernal delight, t Now welcom'd each monster's return.

Pale Emmeline shudder'd, \u2014 the clock it struck one, Blood stream'd from the wound of her breast ; Deep thunder was heard \u2014 and the spectre begun \u2014 ** My vengeance,\" \u2014 it falter'd, and pass'd with a groan, Half-supprest, to the Horrible Feast."], [27, "21 The d\u00e6mons then rose, and receiv'd her with joy, The Cavern rung loud with the din ; Ghosts danc'd in the air, and triumphant on high, Quaff'd the blood of the slain, while for vengeance they cry, \u2014 Thus they punish the Children of Sin These shadowy fiends, now in armour so bright, Now groaning they press the cold ground ; Now frantic they rave, and now wild with delight, They push round the skull, as confus'd thro' the night, These horrible verses resound. *' Drain, drain the sweetbeverage, more victims shall die, \" And gloriously welter in blood, \" For vengeance is ours , feeble man we defy, u Carouse ghosts, drink deep, and remorse from us fly, \" We'll seek fresh supplies from the wood.\" VIII.

On his richly caparison'd courser he rode, Nor conceiv'd that such horror was nigh ; Over mountains, thro' vallies, their course they pursued ;, Till at length they arriv'd at the side of a wood, When the stranger, thus spoke with a sigh : \u2014 It is night, dismal night, to yon mansion we go ; \" Mark me well, brave Alonzo, 'tis there! \u2022* Leave thy courser,\" \u2014 the Knight with a courteous bow, Gave assent, and then brush'd thro' the soft-fallingjdew, To the mansion they straightway repair"], [30, "24 Through a dark winding passage, with fearful tread, Pass'd the Knight, with the stranger before ; Now the first time he seem'd with its terrors dismay'd ; Yet convinc'd the adventure was glorious, the blade From the scabbard he furiously tore.

She shrunk, her pale cheek prest the cold chilly ground, And languid and thick was her breath j Her innocent blood stow'd apace from the wound ;r She struggled, grew faint, and gaz'd wistful around ; Then her blue-rolling eyes clos'd in death.
