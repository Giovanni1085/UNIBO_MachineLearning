The purchasers then recite their verses singly, each at the same time selecting the flower named. The cry should be repeated between each verse by the children on the gallery. 1. Flowers to sell ! flowers to sell ! Poppy, rose, and lily-hell ! Come, buy my flowers ! 2. I will have a pink moss-rose ; See how modestly it grows Hid \"beneath its veil of green ; Of flowers all it is the queen. Flowers to sell ! &c. 3. Not a rose for me I pray; I would like some \"blossoms gay. Scarlet poppies suit me quite; They are large and very \"bright. Flowers to sell! &c. 4. I will huy some sweet woodhine ; Round my hat its blossoms twine."], [12, "8 RECITATION BOOK. There its flowers I shall not see; Still its scent will gladden me. Flowers to sell ! &c. 5. I will have a pink all white, Sweet to smell and dear to sight ; Country scenes come back to me When these well-known flowers I see. Flowers to sell ! &c. 6. Now for baby, darling pet, Nought is left but mignonette! 'Little darling!' could there be Better flower than this for thee. Flowers to sell ! &c. BERTIE'S HOLIDAY. (A RECITATION IN SIX PARTS.) I. Bertie. II. Bess. III. John. ' V. Oranny Mullins. IV. Narrator. VI. Jim. Bertie. 1. I will not go to school to-day; I have a top and want to play. Bess. I will stay with you, Bertie, dear, And help to spin it, never fear."], [13, "9 GAMES. 2, 3, 4 Bertie. You shan't ! be off ! and leave me free ; I'll have no tiresome girls with me. Bess. All right, sir! you may play alone, And I shall go to school with John. Bertie. Go then to school, learn 'ABC,' And b-a ba, b-i bi, b-e be : All very well for little boys, But men must look for greater joys. Bess (making a low curtsey). Farewell, then, man ! (to John) I have your slate, Come, little John, we shall be late. Narrative. And well for them they did not stay Away from school that summer day; It chanced, as it in tales should do, A lady came the schools to view, And asked the children to a treat At her own pretty country-seat. You ask me : ' Bertie ! -what did he ? ' What him befell you now shall see : First to the sweet-stuff shop he went ; His fortune, three halfpence, he spent."], [14, "10 RECITATION BOOK.

A farthing's worth of each, rna'am, please, A farthing's worth of ginger-beer. Granny Mullins. No ! there I draw the line, my dear : That little drop would spoil the rest. Bertie (sighing \u2014 after much consideration.) I think, then, almond-rock is best. Narrative. His mouth well filled, he left the shop, Ate all his sweets, and spun his top ; An hour thus pleasantly had sped, A heavy hand fell on his head. (Jim presses down Bertie's head.) He looked and saw his school-mate, Jim ; Now, Bertie was afraid of him."], [15, "11 GAMES. 8, 9. 10. Jim. Hullo! young Bertie, out at play? I, too, am making holiday; You don't play well, so I'll begin To teach you how a top should spin, Bertie. I 'd rather not ; this way is nice, I did not ask you for advice. Jim. You stupid boy ! you take it so, (Snatches the top.) Then pocket it (does so), and off you go. (Runs off.) Narrative. With Bertie's top away he ran, And cried out : ' Catch me if you can ! ' Poor Bertie tried, but all in vain; He never saw his top again. When Bess and John came home in glee, Our man bewailed his liberty ; His money gone, his sweets also, Nor could he to the country go. And then before the day was o'er He promised mother never more"], [16, "12 RECITATION BOOK. Would he the part of truant play, Or from his duties run away. Yet Jim was wrong to take the top. Bad deeds begun are hard to stop. OUR PETS. In this recitation each child is intended to take a verse, separately, and all the children on the gallery to repeat the cry in chorus. The teacher is advised to choose those verses which are about some animal on which the children have an object lesson. 1. I have of doves a pair ; They are so white and fair, And they say \u2014 ' Coo \u2014 oo \u2014 oo ! ' 2. My father has a cow ; I do not fear it now When it says \u2014 ' Moo \u2014 oo \u2014 oo ! ' 3. We have a flock of sheep ; When they are not asleep, They cry out \u2014 ' Ba\u2014 a\u2014 a ! ' 4 I have my own pet lamb ; How fond of it I am ! It calls me \u2014 'Ma-a-al'"], [17, "GAMES. 13 5. We have a cock and hen ; The hen does cackle when She lays an egg. (Children cackle.) 6. The cock says : ' Who are you ? I'm cockadoodle doo \u2014 Some corn I beg.' (Children croiv.) 7. Fine ducks has uncle Jim That in the water swim ; They say : ' Quack ! quack ! Quack ! quack ! ' 8. Our fowls (white spots on gray) Are guinea-hens ; they say \u2014 ' Come back ! come back ! Come back ! come back ! ' 9. Our donkey says : ' Hee-haw ! This cart no more I '11 draw For love or pay ! Hee-haw! hee-haw!' 10. 'I'll do my own sweet will, Which is to stand stock-still, And so, good day! Hee-haw ! hee-haw ! '"], [18, "14 WE SHOW OFF OUR TREASURES. First Child. 1. Oh, have you seen our little snail? A prudent one is he ; Before he ventures out to walk, Lest danger there should be, He pokes his horns from out his shell, The country round to see. All. The children put up a finger at each side of their heads and raise these two fingers slowly in imitation of a snail. He pokes his horns from out his shell, Lest danger there should be ; He pokes his horns from out his shell, The country round to see. Second Child. 2. And have you seen the little bees, With so much work to do? They fly about from flower to flower, Still fresh with morning clew ; And while they fly and buzz around, They seem to sing to you ;"], [19, "GAMES. 15 AU. The little girls raise the ends of their pinafores and move their arms as if flying. Buzz-buzz, buzz-buzz, buzz-buzz, my dear, We 've so much work to do ; We cannot stop in bed till late And waste our time like you. Third Child. 3. And have you seen our brood of chicks, Soft balls on two small pegs, With claws spread out upon the ground, And those, you know, are legs. And only fancy, mother says, Those chickens once were eggs. All (imitate the clucking of a hen) The old hen clucks : ' Say, have I not A charming family ? ' Her chickens all speak French, because They answer, ' Oui \u2014 oui \u2014 oui !

It is a little tiny babe, And \u2014 strangest thing of all\u2014 My mother says I once was that, And then I used to squall."], [20, "16 OUR ZOO. The children who are visiting the Zoo ask those on the gallery, one by one, what animal he or she is. The one interrogated answers, and all on the gallery perform the action and utter the cry of the bird or animal named. Hawk. 1. ' What are you?' 'A hawk!' 'Are you? Can you talk?' ' No ! but I can eat.' 'What's your food?' 'Raw meat.' 'No teeth have you Raw meat to chew.' 'Try me, you will see, Hee, hee, hee, hee.' The cry of the hawk is very shrill and piercing. It jerks itself up and down after each mouthful of food. Pig. 2. ' What are you ? ' 'A pig ! : ' Can you dance a jig ? ' 'No! but I can grunt, And for roots could hunt, Only this ring goes Right through my nose.' Lion. 3. ' Excuse me, sir, pray do ; But tell me, who are you?' ' I am the king of beasts, Raw flesh my greatest feasts;"], [21, "17 GAMES. I roar and stout hearts quake, But \u2014 give my paw a shake.' Horse. 4. 'What ai-e you?' 'A horse!' ' You can ride of course ; Take me for a ride.' ' No ! I 've too much pride ; I'm no steed for you\u2014 Only here on view.' Bear. 5. 'What are you?' 'A bear, With thick fur and hair; Please give me a bun, If you have got one, Or I'll hug your face In my hard embrace.' Wild Boar. 6. 'What are you?' 'A boar! Ask the ass next door.' The Ass (All). 7. You think this game a bore? We'll play at it no more, Hee-haw ! hee-haw ! hee-haw ! We'll play at it no more, Hee-haw! hee-haw! hee-haw! 13"], [22, "IX P L A Y - T I M E.

Now to the playground quick we go With flag and banner flying. First marching quick, then marching slow, To keep in time we're trying. 4. We stamp our feet and march along, The teachers cry \u2014 'together,' ' Left, right, left, right ; well done, well done ; Come, you are getting clever.' 5. But hush ! -what sound is that we hear Above our noisy playing? A bell is ringing, loud and clear, And we know what 'tis saying :"], [23, "19 GAMES, 6. 'Ding-dong, ding-dong, your play is done, And lessons are beginning.' Now hasten back to read and sum, The school-room bell is ringing. THE POSTMAN. For this piece one boy should personate the postman. He gives the postman's knock at door. One Child. 1. Hark ! I hear a sharp rat-tat ; There 's some one knocking at the door. All together. Why, 'tis the postman, all know that ; His knock we've often heard before. (Enter postman.) Postman. 2. Good morning, children ! I was told You want to learn \"what work I do, So I have dared to make so bold As to come here and teach you too. Children, 3. Oh, thank you ! you are very kind To come and teach such little folk; When teacher said you would not mind, We thought it must be all a joke."], [24, "20 RECITATION BOOK. 4. Your coat is blue, your collar red (We see that with our own two eyes), You wear a blue cap on your head, But we want more to make us wise. Postman. 5. Now tell me, have you ever seen A postman different dressed from me? Children. Why, now, 'whatever do you mean? You're all as like as you can be. Postman. 6. Our uniform we all call this, \"Which means we are dressed all the same ; The Sovereign's uniform it is, And Queen Victoria is her name. Children. 7. Now, one can know a letter well, But we are puzzled for your sake ; We do not know how you can tell To whom each letter yon must take."], [25, "21 GAMES. Postman (showing letter). 8. Look here? When folks a letter write They put upon it an address. So we can tell just at first sight What does seem hard, I must confess. Children. 9. Then you must learn to wrrite and read As well as strong and honest be. Postman. Quite true ! that is a pressing need, As every one can plainly see. 10. So now good-bye ! I think you know As much as I have got to say. Children. Well, we must thank you ere you go, And hope you'll come another day. FORM. Any number of children can be used in forming figures, but then the number named in the verse must be changed. (Children form square.) 1. Two children here, two children there, Two children must be everywhere; Four equal sides there just must be, If you would make a square, you see."], [26, "22 RECITATION BOOK. (Children form oblong.) 2. Two children here, two children there, But not two children everywhere; Two sides a larger number take, If we the oblong wish to make. (Children form triangle.) 3. And now three sides is all we need, A triangle to make with speed ; Just any number on each side, To length of line we are not tied. (Children form circle.) 4. Now, standing round, each hand we take, Because a circle we would make ; It simply is one endless line When you shall put your hand in mine. THE SEASONS. l. First Child. I am the Spring. I come with smiles of gladness, with sun- shine, and with rain. I warm the poor half-frozen earth, and make it young again."], [27, "23 GAMES. I freshen up the trees and flowers, for how I love them all ! The buds and leaves spring forth again, obedient to my call. The Spring is always welcome, \"with its skies serene and clear. (All the children repeat.) Yes, the Spring is very welcome, 'tis the childhood of the year. 2. Second Child, I am the Summer. I come with gayer colours : the fields are fresh and green, Crops are growing, lovely flowers may everywhere be seen ; The birds are singing gaily in the branches overhead, 'Neath our feet a carpet flecked with daisies is outspread. The Summer's very lovely, buds and blos- soms reappear. (AU.) Yes, the Summer's very lovely, 'tis the girlhood of the year."], [28, "24 RECITATION BOOK. 3. Third Child. I am the Autumn. I come with good things laden ; the orchard and the field Will, at my gentle bidding, their golden treasures yield ; The summer sun has ripened all the fruits I held in store ; Then gather them with gladness\u2014 next year I'll bring you more. And you should love the Autumn, for its fruit fulness will cheer. (AU.) Yes, Autumn is its womanhood, the best part of the year. 4. Fourth Child. I am the Winter. I do not come with gladness ; my look is sad and cold, My colours are all faded, for I am growing old; I have no fruits to offer, but my gift is of the best, For Winter is the night-time \"when the tired earth takes its rest."], [29, "25 GAMES. Then reverence the winter, for rest to all is dear. (All.) Yes, \"we'll reverence the Winter, 'tis the old age of the year. COINS. In this piece the separate coins named will each be worn by a child. Some children in the class will have the money ready to give the change named. The first verse is said by all those wearing coins. 1. Down at the mint we have all been made ; Down at the bank we have all been \"weighed ; So silver and gold, true money I ween, We all are good coins as ever were seen. 2. (By child who wears sovereign.) I a Sovereign standing here, Am worth my twenty shillings clear. (Child in class.) Oh, Mr Sovereign ! please I '11 take you, And into twenty shillings make you.

Ten silver shillings then I give, That you may in my pocket live. (Gives change.) 4. (By child who wears crown.) And I so large am called a crown, To get me put five shillings down. (Child in class.) You are so very large and fine, I'll give the five to make you mine. (Gives change.) 5. (By child who wears half-crown.) Two silver shillings and six pence Is \"what you'll need to get me hence. (Child in class.) Why, half-a-crown then that must be ; Please give that nice round coin to me. (Gives change.)"], [31, "GAMES. 27 6. (Child in class.) Another silver coin I see; And what will your name please to be? (Child ivith florin?) My name is florin, and I'm willing To be your own for twice one shilling. 7. (All the class.) Why, now each coin the Queen doth grace, For on them we can see her face ; The year they're made is there as \"well, So date and ruler we can tell. THE HOUSE ON FIRE. At the first verse a few children approach the class, supposed to be the house, and look about for the fire. At the second verse the children (beginning with a few at the back) raise and wave hands to represent flames, except those who are meant for the inhabitants. The inhabitants near ends of benches run out. At the third verse several children representing engine, horses, and firemen come very noisily. At the fourth verse they pretend to play on fire and bring out those still in the house. At the fifth verse the children's hands fall by degrees. 1. Why, what a dreadful smell of fire ! There 's surely something burning ! Please everybody look about, Now this way, that way, turning."], [32, "28 RECITATION BOOK. 2. Stay, there a flame is springing up ; Fire ! Are ! loudly shout ; It 's getting larger rapidly ; The engines must come out. 3. Hark ! hark ! the rushing and the noise ; The engines ! one by one ; The helmets bright afar I see ; The horses, how they run ! 4. They play upon it with their hose; Hurrah ! the people shout ; They save the children from the flames, And put the fire quite out. 5. And now the flames are dying down, The work is nearly done; All praise the firemen do we give, The praise so bravely won. (The children should conclude this verse by clapping hands.)"], [33, "SECTION II. INSTRUCTIVE PIECES."], [34, ""], [35, "31 HOW GLASS WAS FIRST MADE. 1. In years long past two sailors bold \u2014 At least the story so is told \u2014 Whose ship was \"wrecked on ocean wide. To shore did float with \"wind and tide. 2. At length by efforts brave they reach The shore \u2014 a nice, soft, sandy beach ; But fear of hunger now to die, For neither house nor man is nigh. 3. But soon, by luck, a bird they kill, Then set to cook it with a will ; Of seaweed, high, they pile a heap, A bonfire burning bright to keep. 4 And now \"with longing, anxious look The needed meal they quicks cook. ' Ha, 'tis ready ! now we il eat ; We never tasted better meat.' 5. 'Finished, the embers now we'll rake Before a farther \"walk we take ; For enemies might be about, And kill us if they find us out.'"], [36, "32 RECITATION BOOK. 6. 'But what is this?

What was it they had really found Thus lying there upon the ground? 'Twas glass\u2014 a thing we often see ; It \"would not puzzle you or me. 9. Now if some glass we want to make, Sand, soda, lime, are \"what we take. I told you once before the land Was covered with a fine, soft sand. 10. So sand is there \u2014 'but soda, lime?'

In the water, in the air, It is hidden everywhere; In the milk, in every tree, Can you guess what it may be ? 2. Hidden deep beneath the ground, As a metal it is found. From North of England here it came- Iron ! Yes, that is its name. 3. Iron and stone, in one, before They separate them, is called ore. Now who can come and find it out; It's lying somewhere here about? (A child takes piece of ore off teacher's table.) 4. The iron from the stone to take A furnace fierce and large they make Then mounting up right to the top, The ore, from barrows, in they drop. 5. Perhaps you may have heard before The heat will melt the iron ore ; So solid once, 'tis liquid now, To make the iron pig or sow, c"], [38, "34 RECITATION BOOK. 6. They run it in a large sand-mould, And leave it there to get quite cold. 'Pig or cast iron' then they call it; But must take care \u25a0what does befall it. (Specimen shown.) 7. Cast iron is not strong, but brittle, And it will break with very little. So when cast iron pigs are bought, To stronger iron they are wrought. 8. It must be melted now once more, And left to cool just as before ; Then, while hot, they hard will beat it. Yes ! that 's the proper way to treat it. 9. And when it has been beaten long It turns both very hard and strong. Wrought iron now it must be named, For strength and -wear in all times famed. (Specimen shown.)"], [39, "35 THE CAMEL. One pupil wears a picture of a camel ; another points out the parts when named. Camel. 1.

Yes, we would learn much more than that ; Pray tell us of your hump of fat. Camel. 3. When I have neither grass nor seed, I then tipon my hump can feed; So keep me without food, and lo ! My hump from sight will surely go. Children. 4. Now we have learnt how you can feed, Which is a wondrous thing indeed; Why are your feet so large and flat? A reason there must be for that. Camel. 5. My feet are flat, and broad, and round Because I walk on sandy ground;"], [40, "36 RECITATION BOOK. If they were hard, and small, and thin, On such loose soil they would sink in. Children. 6.

Within I have a water store Which lasts me for three days, or more ; So, though no grass or water's there, I journey on without a care. Children. 8. The desert ship you are named well; To cross the desert, we can tell, You must as truly needed be As is a ship to cross the sea. LEATHER. 1. You say your boots are made of leather. Yes, that is very true ; But men and things must \"work together Before they're fit for yon."], [41, "37 INSTRUCTIVE PIECES. 2. A hide the tanner first must buy, And scrape off all the hair ; Then in the tannin it must lie, Receiving watchful care. 3. But what is tannin? you will say, We never heard of it before. Well, you can make it any day If bark of trees you can procure. 4. Now, -what is called the bark of trees ? I'm sure you'll say the skin. Then listen, and I'll tell you, please, A juice doth lie therein. 5. This juice is tannin \u2014 oak 's the best ; 'Tis mixed with lime and water.

In a trap I found a mouse, That had been caught about the house, Eating bread and soap and cheese, Taking just what it would please. 2. Four little tiny paws it had, Two little eyes that looked so sad ; 'Twras covered wuth a fur \u2014 not gray, But mouse-colour is what we say. 3. Its little teeth could bite through wood To bore a hole to steal its food. Ah, little thief ! you 're caught at last ; Your days of robbery are past. 4. Poor little mouse no better knew \u2014 'Twrould not be so with me or you. He had not learnt of wrong and right, So we may pity his sad plight."], [43, "39 THE MOON. 1. ' Oh, daddy !

And then in his boat he tries to get near it, With his harpoon so sharp he tries hard to spear it. 3. And why should he want the poor creature to kill? 'Tis harmless, so long as you do it no ill ; Just look in its mouth, the true reason you '11 find : On the -whalebone that's there he's set his whole mind. 4. Yet more, this great animal 's covered with fat; The fisher has also a wish to get that."], [49, "45 INSTRUCTIVE PIECES. The fat is called blubber, and he wants the oil, Which will quickly flow out when it 's put on to boil. 5. So as soon as it's dead, on its back they will get, To cut off the blubber, on which they are set; From its big open mouth the whalebone they'll take, And when they've enough will for home again make. TREES. 1. Three children sat beneath a tree; Their names were Jack, and Bob, and Nan. They wished to learn about the tree, The facts that little children can. 2. Now Jack (the eldest) spoke the first, And said, 'This tree so fine and tall, That gives us such a shady seat, You know we cannot see it all ! '"], [50, "46 RECITATION ROOK. 3. ' No, no,' said Nan, ' of course we can't, For hidden deep beneath the ground Is that which holds the tree quite firm ; 'Tis there the spreading root is found' 4.

But now about the skin so dark \u2014 Yet stay, that's not the proper name, The skin of trees is called the bark. 6. 'It keeps it from the sun and rain, And is as needful as the roots ; And tanners from it get a juice To tan the leather for our boots.' 7. Said Nan, ' I 've more than that to tell : The tree to live must also breathe; That it can do so through its leaves Is what, I think, you '11 scarce believe. 8.

' Oh ! would I -were a butterfly With wings, like you, to soar on high,' The caterpillar sadly said. Then, groaning, shook his small, black head.

' Your comfort, sir, has gone too far ; 'Tis very plain you joking are.' 'I speak the truth \u2014 believe me, pray \u2014 You will be just like me some day.' 5. The other shook his head anew, The butterfly repeated, 'True!' But, useless all that he could say, He spread his wings and flew away. 6. Rejecting truth, he lost all hope, Aud lived \u2014 a discontented mope. Yet some folk, like our friend, would be Denying truth they fail to see."], [56, "52 THE HAY. 1.

It grows and grows all through the spring, Until the summer sun Begins to wither it, and then Haymaking is begun. 4. The mower with his long, sharp scythe, As everybody knows, Comes next, to cut the tall grass down And laj' it all in rows. 5. Then come the girls, -who gaily toss, With merry jest and fun, The hay about, until it dries Beneath the summer sun."], [57, "53 INSTRUCTIVE PIECES. 6.

Then when the winter comes, and snow Has covered all the ground, The cattle think the hay as nice A food as can be found. THE CHRYSALIS. Mamma. 1.

The gardener digs up the garden, And sows little seeds here and there ; But before they will give leaf or blossom. They need water, sun, light, and air. If any of these should be wanting, The poor little seed cannot grow ; The gardener may bring the water, But God gives the rest, as we know.

Then when the sun has turned it a lovely golden brown, The reaper with his sickle comes along to cut it down ; Next 'tis tied in bundles \u2014 the farmer calls them sheaves, The gleaners follow close behind, to pick up what he leaves. 6.

Quite round and large in size, Then all the leaven is poured in, Covered, and left to rise. 5. Then soon it quite fills up the hole, And spreads all round about ; The flour must with it now be worked, Then kneaded, and rolled out. 6.

I know a noble lady, She is of high degree ; And though we may not see her, She speaks to you and me. 2. Although of such high station, She does not dizzy grow, But calls, with loud clear accents, On those who walk below. 3. 'Indeed!' Methinks you answer, 'She shouts' to all who pass! She cannot be a lady, But must be bold as brass.'"], [92, "88 RECITATION BOOK. 4. She is brass, but her boldness Is not -without alloy ; Her tones are kind and loving In grief as well as joy. 5.

A christening goes forward, Her tone is bright and gay; More lively still her chatter Upon a -wedding-day. 7. And -when a poor soul passes From this sad life away, She bids her hearers for it A happy passage pray. 8. This noble lady, -who is she?

To seek her tender, -willing aid None but the coward is afraid. No doctor half so good as she, And yet she never asks a fee : E'en kings and queens need have no shame Her gen'rous help, unpaid, to claim ; Nor is the poor man's scanty store One coin the less her visit o'er. Toil that, before it, would annoy, When it is over, gives but joy. Not many seek her aid in vain : Her aid is balm for weary pain. My friend will close the childish eye Which night and darkness terrify. The fever-patient's aching head, Now tossing restless on its bed, Will find its life and reason saved If she but grant the visits craved ; All eyes wake dry though they did weep Before she soothed them\u2014 gentle S ."], [94, "90 > '> THE SAND HOUSE. 1.

So each dug hard with wooden spade, Until a fine, large heap was made : Then doors and windows soon they mark- Said Tom, 'This is a splendid lark.' 4. 'But, Oh!' said Nan, 'just look and see, The water's not where it should be; For wrhen we came 'twas just down there. And now it 's coming right up here.' 5.

VAIN PUSSY. Oh ! do look at our pussy-cat ! I put on her a grand new hat; Of bright blue paper it is made ; She will grow vain I am afraid, For when her kitten passed this way She sat straight up as if to say : ' Miss Kitty, you may go away ; I shall not play with you to-day! I have a hat both smart and new, And am too fine to romp with you.'"], [97, "MISCELLANEOUS PIECES. 93 Now, pussy dear, attend to me : 'Tis very foolish proud to be, Because you have upon your head A bright blue hat with feathers red.

I once had a dear little kitten, So loving, and playful, and gay; I -was fonder of her than of dolly ; I played with her nearly all day. 2. Shall I tell you her name ? It was Silky ; Her coat was as shiny as jet, With one little white spot on her bosom ; I think I can see it there yet. 3.

But as they grew bigger she made them a house, Of wood, with a fencing all round ; And nice clean fresh straw she had put in the bed, So they had not to sleep on the ground. 4. One day these two piggies grew tired of their home, And for dinner they thought they 'd go out, So they grubbed a large hole underneath the nice fence, With the aid of their strong little snout. 5.

'These twigs are just the thing; They'll hold the nest on every side, And let it gently swing.' 4. At once they brought some straw there. And twisted it all round.

Pussy by the hearth one day Seemed to be tired out with play; When up the shelf she made a spring, Making all the glasses ring. 2. 'Oh!'

The Rose and the Lily seemed to have an equal right to the honour, and this led to some rather warm discussions on the suhject. One day, when the dispute was rather hotter than usual, a young Tulip, that had hitherto kept modestly in the background, stepped forward and asked leave to speak and settle the matter once for all : this was graciously granted by the other flowers, and the following is the account of the proceedings. 1. The Narrator. In pensive mood I wandered Through a garden gay with flowers, Then sat me down to rest awhile In one of Nature's bowers, Where soon sweet sleep stole o'er me, And presently I dreamed, But so clearly rose the vision, That reality it seemed. Methought the flowers drew near me \u2014 The Rose and Lily tall, The Sweet-pea and Carnation, The Tulip last of all."], [127, "123 MISCELLANEOUS PIECES. They seemed to be conversing On that lovely summer day; And I bent my ear to listen To -what each of them might say, The gentle Rose -was speaking, And her voice was soft and low. She said: \u20222. The Rose. ' I 'm Queen of all the flowers That in this garden grow. All love to see my beauty And my fragrance sweet inhale, For I grace the gorgeous palace And the cottage in the dale ; I bring the mourner comfort, For I solace him in grief; I give the sick and ailing ones Refreshment and relief. 'Tis true, the thorns around me Often cause a passing smart, But the pain is soon forgotten In the pleasure I impart. I am begemmed with dewdrops In the early morning light, The honey-bee bends o'er me As he stays his hurried flight."], [128, "124 RECITATION BOOK.

Then the Lily, swift advancing, Bowed her head wdth modest grace, And a gentle smile was fingering O'er the pure and lovely face. She murmured : 4. The Lily. 'Rose, I know, dear, That you are most sweet and fair; But say, has not the Lily Of your beauty some small share ? You deck the cot and palace, But I the altar-throne : There the pure and spotless Lily Ever finds her rightful home. You give the mourner comfort, And the sick a passing peace Which seems just for the moment To make his sufferings cease."], [129, "125 MISCELLANEOUS PIECES. But I, with fragrant sweetness Scent the pure summer air, That the wayworn, weary traveller May find refreshment there. But, oh! 5. Narrator. And here the Lily Paused with a gentle sigh, For her sweet low voice was falt'ring, While a tear stood in her eye: 6. The Lily. 'Deem not my words ungentle, Deem not my thoughts unkind; I could not -wound my dear ones \u2014 No thorn on me they find. And the bright and sparkling dewdrops, Do they pass me proudly by? Nay ! in the hours of darkness My beauty they descry. And I too love the sunshine And the summer sky so blue.

'You are, I grant, the Queen of Flowers, But what, sweet friend, am I ? ' 9. Narrator. Then rose a low sweet murm'ring From all the flowers around, And the wild bird ceased its warbling At the unwonted sound ; While the mingling of sweet voices Fell on my listening ear ; But the summer wind was whisp'ring, Their words I could not hear. At length arose the Tulip, And his voice was clear and strong in. Tidip. ' Let not our peace be broken ; We've loved them both too long. Grant me a few brief moments, I earnestly beseech.'"], [131, "127 MISCELLANEOUS PIECES. 11. Narrator. And the flowers assented gladly, For they liked well his speech ; Then coming from his place, he spoke, Bending before his queen : 12.

Tulip. * Methinks that you in this fair world Have played a noble part. The Rose doth symbolise true love, To earth from heaven sent down, But the Lily, \" spotless innocence,\" Doth gem a heavenly crown.

' So now the matter 's ended ; In future each one knows That types of innocence and love Are the Lily and the Rose.' Note to the Teacher. \u2014 This piece could be prettily acted by four children. The Narrator should be seated in an arbour to represent the dreamer. The Rose should be dressed in pink and green, the Lily in white arid green, the Tulip in red, or red and yellow. Some smaller children, gaily dressed, grouped around might represent the garden. Two children should stand by, holding each a wreath, one white, the other all colours, with which the Tulip should crown the rival queens. The Tulip should lead each queen for ward by the hand while reciting the last four lines. THE END. Edinburgh : Printed by W. & R. Chambers, Limited."], [133, ""], [134, ""], [135, ""], [136, ""]]
