The present volume completes the series of E-iropean Histories, called \"The Historical Library;\" and in thus concluding her pleasant, though long and arduous task, the authoress desires to express her grateful sense of the almost unhoped-for encourage ment she has met with, both in the success of her work, and the favourable notice bestowed upon it, from the beginning, by those whose opinions have so much weight and influence. The History of Greece is written precise1*7 on the plan of that of Rome; all that is fabulou,. uting discarded, or its unhistorical character pointed out, and the best modern authors, alone taken as au thorities. In recording the rise, progress, and fall of the two great states of ancient Europe, we are naturally disposed to feel a higher degree of interest in the fortunes of a people who have lived and ruled in our own land, and whose works here still occasionally meet our eyes ; bringing us, as it were, into familiat association with them; yet there are many points of equal interest, and perhaps of more importance in the history of the Greeks, although they never attaiucu to that extent of uower and dominion"], [12, "PREFACE. which distinguished the Romans from all other nations that ever rose to empire either in ancient or modern times. The Greeks were, undoubtedly, the earliest civi lised people of Europe, and it was from Greece tiie Romans derived the knowledge and refinement which they so widely diffused. The most striking characteristics of the Romans were, the love of freedom, and the ambition of conquest ; but the Greeks were, from an early period of their history, distinguished as statesmen, orators, philosophers, poets, sculptors, architects, and painters ; so that in some of the Grecian states, especially at Athens, some of the fine arts were carried to a degree of perfection that has never since been equalled. Then, while for many ages, there have been no people that could trace their origin to the ancient Romans, the Greeks have never been extinct, and although a degenerate race in consequence of a long period of suffering and slavery, again occupy their former country and capital as a free people. But as Greece was once the highest, so it is now the lowest, among the kingdoms of Europe, in point of civilisation, and perhaps no people are less able than the modern Greeks to appreciate the works of their illustrious ancestors, which are still found in every part of that interesting but desolate and degraded land."], [13, "HISTORY OF GREECE. EARLY PERIOD. Ancient Greece was much more extensive than the modem \u2022.ingdom, 'for it included a great portion of the country to the north of the Isthmus of Corinth, with the peninsula ol the Morea, then called the Peloponnesus; all the islands in the \u00c6gean sea or Archipelago, those in the Ionian sea, and those of the Mediterranean lying towards Asia, among which were Rhodes, Cyprus, and Crete, (now Candia;) with h part of Asia Minor, called \u00c6olis and Ionia where Grecian colonies were settled and Grecian cities founded, in very early times. - The original name of the people who inhabited Greece Proper, and whom we, from the Latin, call Greeks, was Hellenes, and that name is now adopted by the modern Greeks, the present kingdom being denominated Hellas, or Greece. It is a beautiful and picturesque country, divided by vast chains cf mountains into a number of separate territories, each of which seems to have become, in distant ages of which there is no authentic history, the abode of a distinct community, having its own law? and government independent of the rest. Hence manv small kingdoms were established at different unknown periods, rude and Vjarbaious, no doubt, in the beginning, but which gradually lecame civilised by time and circumstances.0 3T..e Hellenes were not the first inhabitants of Greece m rairlwiiil's x.rvrctl."], [14, "6 GREECE. for it was occupied by a still more ancient people, called Pelassrians, described as savasres livintr in the rudest state of barbarism;11 but of whom, or of the way in which they were .dispossessed of the land, very little is known. 4The new race appears to have been composed of wandering tribes from the east,* who made settlements in Thessaly, but spread by degrees further to the south, constantly warring with each other and founding small kingdoms in every part of the country.0 5The name of Hellenes was at first that of a small tribe in Thessaly, said to have derived its origin from Hellen, a king, who, according to some of the ancient authors, was a son of Jupiter (although more usually termed the son or brother of Deucalion ;) and as the same name was, in course of time, extended to the whole people, He-leu was regarded as the common ancestor of all the Greeks/ in whose early history, always thus blended with mythology, it becomes difficult to distinguish the truth from the fiction. The history of those times, which are called the Heroic ages, was gathered entirely from the songs and traditions of the country, celebrating the warlike exploits of certain great chieftains, termed heroes by the poets, and afterwards wor shipped by the Greeks as descendants of the gods. Every noble family pretended to trace its origin to some one of the deified heroes, said to have lived and fought in those remote times, but who are now generally considered as fabulous characters .e 6The Heroic ages are supposed to comprise a period of about two hundred years, from the first appearance of the Hellenes in Greece to the famous siege of Troy, the date ot which is extremely doubtful, but usually fixed at 1193, B. C. a Chamber's ' Greece.' b It appears, however, probable that the \" Hellenes \" came from U\u00abe -west, ttcUcaLioufi of their name being numerous in Epirus, anr-nr rstp <o /.tIt-ViMd. r Thirlwall. d Smith's ' Greek ana Rnman Biography ana Mynio^^y. t Th.Jl *_dl."], [15, "GREECE. 7 'it was during this period, whenever it misfit be, that most of the Grecian States were founded, and institutions established ;\" but the popular tales respecting their origin and early history are supposed to be as fabulous as the story of Romulus and the building of Rome. Of this character i\u00ab the well known legend of Cecrops,* the reputed founder of Athens, who, we are told, first brought the elements of civi- lisation from Egypt among the native barbarians of Att-oa, the most southern province of Greece, north of the Isthmus; where, it is said, he became king of the country, and built twelve towns, the largest of which surmounted a rocky eminence on which he erected a castle for his own abode, and placed the whole country under the protection of the goddess Athene, called by the Latins Minerva, and from whom the chief city took the name of Athen\u00e6, or Athens. The supposed settlement of Cecrops9 dates 1550 years before the Christian era ; so that, if there were any truth in the tradition, Athens must have been founded before the time of Moses, while the children of Israel were in bondage among the Egyptians; 10but it is far more probable that this famous citv, which still exhibits traces of its ancient splendour, was originally built by a colony of the Ph\u0153nicians,' the great commercial people of antiquity, before Greece was civilised or Rome in existence ; and as they established trading sta- tions all along the coast of the Mediterranean sea, they were not likely to neglect a spot so conveniently situated for that purpose as the point where Athens stands. \"Another ce^end tells how Cadmus, a Ph\u0153nician, first brought the alphabet into Greece, and was the founder of the famous cicy of Thebes; but although there is no doubt that the Greek alphabet was derived from Ph\u0153nicia, it is very un certain ut what period letters were first known in Greece. 4!' how \u00a3\u00bbr the art of writing was carried in the early ages;\" a Thirlwall. * Thirlwall. c Thirlwall."], [16, "8 GREECE. therefore the account given of Cadmus is not considered historical. in snort, every Grecian State had a fabulous history of us commencement, and boasted of many heroes who probaDly never existed, except in the imaginations of the poets, likr the renowned king Arthur of the Ancient Britons; yet the Greeks themselves believed in their reality, and this belief exercised a direct influence over their manners and customs, their religion, and their political institutions. \"The Greeks were heathens ; they worshipped numerous divinities both male and female, the greatest of whom was 13Zeus or Jupiter, supposed to hold his court, composed oi the principal gods and goddesses, on the top of Mount Olympus, the highest mountain in Thessalv. Next to Jupiter was Apollo, to whom it was believed that man was indebted for the arts of poetry and music ; besides which he was reverenced as the guardian of the flocks and herds ; the punisher of wicked deeds, and the god who was deputed to make known to mortals the will of Jupiter, by means of Oracles.\" \"The heroes of the Greek worship were persons believed to possess a superhuman nature derived immediately to them by divine birth, and whose powerful faculties were exerted in useful labours for the happiness of men. Of these, the most remarkable were 15Hercules, Theseus, Triptolemus, \u00c6sculapius, and Minos. Another class of Heroes, most of them also alleged to be of divine origin, but held in less reverence by the Greeks at large, were Agamemnon, Achilles, Nestor, Ulysses, and other great chiefs, said to have distin guished themselves in the Trojan War. l6The siege of Troy is the earliest event recorded in Grecian history that bears anv semblance of truth, and of this we have only the poeticaj accounts of the ancient authors, derived chiefly from tne ooe-us of Homer, \"who is said to have lived a thous.u-.s_ a Smith's ' Biography aud JAytlwIo^j..'"], [17, "GREECE. 9 years before the Christian era, and about three hundred years alter the war took place ; but these dates are very douotful.\" The poetical legend of the Trojan war is this. \"The city of Troy was the capital of a rich and powerful kingdom in Asia Minor, on the eastern side of the Helles pont, governed by a king named Priam, whose son,19 Paris, while engaged on some adventurous expedition, paid a visit to the court of Sparta, a Grecian state in the Peloponnesus, where he was received and entertained by the king, Menelaus, with the most friendly hospitality. Unmindful, however, of the kind treatment he had met with from his royal host, he carried off his young and beautiful wife Helen, and conveyed her to his father's kingdom. The rest of the Greek princes. indignant at the injury done to Menelaus, united to avenge his cause, and sailed, with all the forces they could muster, to lay siege to Troy, which was strongly fortified. 20The siege lasted ten years, in the course of which many heroes on both sides are said to have performed wonderful deeds of valour; when, at length the city was taken by the following stratagem.21 The Greeks, we are told, constructed a gigan tic wooden horse, in which they concealed a number of men, amongst whom was Menelaus himself, and leaving it near the walls, thev pretended to give up the siege and move towards their ships. The Trojans, thinking them really gone, took the horse into the city; and, when it was night, the warriors came out and opened the gates for their comrades, who were on the watch , and thus Troy was taken and entirely destroyed, and the king of Sparta regained his beautiful queen On the return of the chiefs, after their long absence, they found strangers in possession of their dominions, and wars ensued between the usurpers and the dispossessed princes, some of whom recovered their kingdoms, while others were obliged to seek their fortunes elsewhere. \"Among the ctiiels who had been thus wronged was Oavsse- a Thirlwall."], [18, "10 GREECE. as, (Ulysses,) \"king of the small Island of Ithaca, whose return had been delayed by various adventures for ten years, so that it was supposed he had perished by shipwreck, and many chiefs came as suitors to his wife Penelope, who, faith- ful to the memory of her lost husband, was unwilling to give her hand to another. She therefore contrived to put them off by declaring that she could not make her choice before the completion of a large piece of work which she had begun; and on which she used to work industriously, unravelling, every night, all she had done in the day, so that it was not finished on the return of Ulysses, when her lovers discovered the artifice. In the disguise of a beggar, he entered his own halls, where the chiefs were feasting and enjoying themselves ; and, having made himself known to Penelope and his son Telemachus, he succeeded, with the aid of the latter, in killing all the intruders, and thus re gained his wife and his kingdom. The fall of Troy, and the return of Ulysses, are the subjects of the grand poems attributed to Homer, and en titled the Iliad and the Odyssey, which, in after times, when the Greeks became a learned and highly-civilised people, formed the basis of a liberal Greek education, inso much that every school-boy was taught to repeat large por tions of them by heart; yet so little was known about their author, that the ancient writers themselves differed materially as to the age in which he lived.4 23It is, indeed, quite un certain whether these poems were the work of one individual, or whether they were originally detached lays composed by the bards at different periods, and not written, but recited or sung, like other traditional poems. \u00b0 There were bards, or rhapsodists, in every part of Greece, who used to sing or recite heroic lays at the public festivals and banquets of the princes, and there is little doubt that the events of the a Smith's ' Biography and Mythology.'

It is supposed that these lays were afterwards formed into connected poems by some great poet, probably named Homer, and a native of Ionia, in Asia Minor; but it is a disputed point whether, even then, the art of writing was sufficiently advanced to have admitted of their being written down, or whether they were preserved for ages bv memory alone.\" 24It was not till the sixth century B.

The papyrus was a reed that grew in Egypt, from which a sort of paper was easily made ; nor was it till after the introduc tion of this useful material, that the poems of Homer were collected in fragments from various towns in Asia, and brought to Athene where they were for the first time com mitted to writing in a. connected form, under the auspice**\" Pisistratus, the ruler of that city.c It is necessary to un- derstand thus much about these celebrated poems and their reputed author, because from them we derive all the infor- mation which we possess respecting the manners, customs, a Smith's ' Biography and Mythology,' floK._T._u. t.

Very little is known about this invasion ; but it seems that many new kingdoms were established by the conquerors, and that 28after this invasion the inhabitants of Greece wera of three distinct races, the \u00c6olians, the Ionians, and the Dorians ;4 and although all called Greeks, they always preserved this national distinction, the Athenians, for instance, being Ionian Greeks; the Spartans, Dorians; just as the people of this country, in the middle ages, though ill were called English, were of Saxon or Norman race. a Smith's ' Biography and Mythology.* 6 Thirlwall.

GREECE AND ITS INHABITANTS IN THE HOMERIC AGES. In the early times to which the Homeric Poems refer, Greece was divided into the following provinces : 'Thessaly to 'l.e north ; \u00c6tolia and Acarnania, on the coast of the Ionian sea; Doris and Phocis, in the middle; Locris, on the Gulf of Corinth, and stretching southward into the \u00c6gean sea, Boeo- tia, and the rocky province of Attica. All these were north of the Isthmus of Corinth. A chain of mountains runs through the Isthmus, which, branching off in various direc- tions, divided the Peloponnesus into several parts, forming the provinces of Achaia, Arcadia, Elis, Messenia, Argolis, and Laconia, the last of which was the most southern part of the peninsula, and in it was situated the famous city os' Sparta.\" 'Almost all the states were under the same form of govern ment. The monarchy was hereditary, and the king was the High Priest, the chief, in war, and the head of the assembly of Elders or rulers, in peace; for the power of the sovereign a Library of Useful Knowledge. \u2014 History of Greece."], [22, "]4 GREECE. was then very limited, the affairs ofthe government being con ducted chiefly by a council of the elder nobles. 3In any great emergency, this council called a general assembly cf the people, consisting of all the freemen of the state; when the king took the highest seat, surrounded by the nobles, and the people stood in a circle around them. It is not known whether the latter were allowed to vote, or whether they were only summoned to hear what measures the council had determined upon; but it seems they were at liberty to express either dissatisfaction or approval. The king was chiel judge, presiding over the courts of justice, which were held in the market place, or some other open space, where the judges sat on stone seats, ranged in a half circle, that of the sovereign chief being higher than the rest. Here they decided all causes according to usage, written laws not being yet in existence.\" At the time of which we are now speaking, the Greeks had certainly made considerable progress in civilization, and were not unacquainted with many of the useful arts. These however, could not have been carried to a very high degree of perfection, since a skilful carpenter was looked upon as a wonderful person, and respected accordingly, so that he was considered on an equality, in point of rank, with the bards and physicians ;4 therefore, whatever articles the Greeks possessed of furniture, dress, or for domestic use, beyond such as were of a very rude description, must have been obtained by trading with the more civilized nations of the east.4 The principal arts known in Greece in those early times seem to have been the weaving of woollen cloth, and the manufacture of coarse earthenware; 5but fine linen was obtained from Egypt; and carpets of a soft texture, like our drugget, from Babylon, Tyre, and Sidon, which were used to spread over chairs and benches as well as for coverlets of beds ; and we are also told that some of the a Smith's ' Greek and Roman A .tiquities ' 6 Thirlwall."], [23, "GREECE. 15 great chiefs had drinking cups of silver, and other luxuries, made by more skilful artisans than Greece could boast of at that period.\" ''Husbandry, wine making, and feeding sheep and cattle, were the rural occupations of the early as well as the later ages ; but the constant wars waged among the different states, must have proved a serious interruption to al) peaceful industry ; and have made it necessary for every shepherd and husbandman to be a warrior. 7The king tsually resided in the Acropolis, or citadel, a wooden tower, built in general on an eminence, either in or near the prin cipal city. The houses of the chiefs, though dignified with the name of palaces, were most likely only rough wooden buildings; but they are not described by any of the ancient writers farther than as containing large halls, for the enter tainment of guests, and it appears that hospitality was carried to such an extent that it was customary to receive and entertain strangers without asking who they were, that no difference might be made between friends and foes.4 This was also the case among the Scottish highlanders two or three centuries ago. 8Most of the chiefs were noted pirates, like the Danes or Northmen of our own early history; nor was it considered at all disgraceful, but rather thought brave and honourable, even in a king, to make excursions to the neighbouring coasts in search of plunder. Their vessels were long narrow galleys, with a mast and sail, but rowed with oars, and some of them large enough to hold about one hundred and twenty men; though this was thought by Thucydides to be an exagge ration ; but as the mariner's compass was unknown to the Greeks, they never ventured to lose sight of land, and wher they went on shore they drew their boats up on the beach.* a Smith's ' Gree . and Roman Antiquities.' i Library of Useful Knowledge\u2014 History of Greece. t Smith's ' Greek and Roman Anti ;uities.'"], [24, "GREECE. 16 9War and piracy were so common among the petty states, that it was not unusual for the husbandmen to arm them selves, when they went to work in the fields, that they might be ready in case of a surprise;\" therefore, we may conclude there was a vast deal of rapine and bloodshed, and that the safety of the peasantry depended much on their own strength and courage. This state of insecurity had given rise to an institution that became highly celebrated, under the name oi the Amphictyonic Council. 10The word Amphictyony implied a neighbourly union, and it is supposed that many such unions were formed among the little states, in the times of which we have no history, for their mutual advan casje,4 few of them being sufficiently large or powerful to stand without some protection against the constant inroads lo which thev were exposed. The most important of these associations was that which wa\u00ab always distinguished by the name of the Amphictyonic council, to which all the principal cities north of the Isthmus belonged before th\u00ab Trojan war. The main objects of the league were, to establish international laws, that is, to make rules for the conduct of the states towards each other both in peace and war, and also to enforce a due observance of the rites of worship. uEach state was represented by two Deputies who composed the council, and met twice a year, to renew the oaths and ceremonials of the institution, and to en quire into any thing that might have been done contrarv to its regulations. 12The states that belonged to it were bound by solemn oaths not to destroy any Amphictvonic city in their wars, nor to cut off its supply of water : but they were under no obligation to refrain from warfare among themselves, nor to assist each other against foreign enemies except for the purpose of protecting the Temple at Delphi^ which '~as held in great veneration throughout Greece, \u00bb ' Greek and Roman Antiquities.' rim-w c Thirlwall"], [25, "GREECE. 17 and of which more will be said hereafter. l3The half yearly meetings of the council were held in the autumn, at Thermopyl\u00e6, on the borders of Thessaly ; and, in the spring, at Delphi, in the province of Phocis; and once in five years, the members, with their wives and children, celebrated a grand religious festival, in the island of Delos.\" The festi vals of the Greeks constituted the most important part of their worship ; but very little is known about them until a later period, when they came to be held with a degree of splendour that caused them to be renowned in all civilised nations. 14At first, they were celebrated by all the inhabi tants of a state, who assembled at certain periods to wor ship their Gods with sacrifices, dances, and hymns, in which all joined, and this was the original Greek chorus,4 15but afterwards, every Temple had a chorus attached to it, consisting of musicians, singers, and dancers of both sexes, who had been instructed for the purpose, and per formed songs and dances, while the people were only listeners and spectators. The principal musical instruments were flutes and cymbals.* l6The Temples, in early times, were small wooden edifices, surrounded with thick groves of trees, and lighted within by lamps ; but as the wealth and prosperity of the Greeks increased, they began to construct their sacred buildings of stone, at first no doubt rudely, and always in the midst of a grove, consecrated to one of the heathen deities. These groves were held so sacred, that no one dared to profane them by any act of violence, so that criminals often fled thither to escape justice, and it .vould have been deemed sacrilege to take them by force from the sanctuary of a Temple. \u25a0-'There was no regular priest hood, but in every state certain great men were appointed to fill that office on all public occasions: and, in private, the head a Smith's ' Greek and Roman Antiquities.' b Smith's 'Green and Roman Antiquities.' e Smith's 'Greek and Roman Antiquities c"], [26, "18 GREECE. of every family was its priest.\" 18A11 that we read of this period shews that the people were divided into three classes; first, those who had, by conquest, become lords of the land and who ranked, like the Norman Conquerors of England, as nobles and warriors ; then the conquered people, who formed the rustic population, and were held in various degrees of subjection in different parts of the country;4 and, lastly, the slaves, whose condition was much the same in Greece as in all other nations. 19The mode of living was very simple, but not destitute of comfort and even luxury. The furniture in the house* of the great consisted chiefly of tables, chairs, and benches; but then the seats were often covered with the soft carpets before-mentioned, and linen sheets were used by the highest class of people, who also had bedsteads, but no other kind of bed than the skin of a leopard or some other wild animal. The poor people slept on the ground on sheep tkins, dried leaves, or rushes, and this was, at all times, the mode of sleeping among the lower orders in Greece. With regard to the costume of this early period, the chief article of dress used by both sexes, was the Pallium, a shawl or scarf resembling the Scottish plaid, made of wool, and usually striped or plaided. It was worn by men over a linen or woollen tunic without sleeves, for the arms and legs were bare, and the feet only protected by a sandal or sole of wood fastened on with leather thongs ; but the women wore, under the pallium, a long dress with sleeves, down to the hands, and on their heads a cap of network.

RISE OF THE ATHENIAN STATE. : Among the numerous states of Greece, Athens and Sparta were, at all times of authentic history, the most important and the most powerful; differing, however, much from each other, both as regarded their political constitution, and the habits and manners of their people. It has already been stated that nothing is known with certainty respecting the foundation of Athens ; but 2it appears that the province of Attica was originally divided into several small states, each ruled by its own chief, and quite independent of the rest, warfare being common among them.\" None of these petty kingdoms, however, could have been much more extensive than a moderately sized farm, and might more properly be called townships than kingdoms, as they seem to have been nothing more than a town, (itself merely a collection of snatched cottages,) two or three villages, and a few acres of land. At length, owing to the frequent wars in which they were engaged, twelve of these townships, with Athens at tneir head, agreed to form a league for mutual aid against a Thirlwall."], [29, "GREECE. 21 their enemies, and it is supposed that the popular story 01 Cecrops and his twelve cities took its rise from this confede racy. \u25a0 3In course of time, but bv what means is uncertain, the twelve states were united under one ruler, and Athens became the capital of the whole country and the seat of government. 4The Athenians in after times had a tradition that this union was effected by a king, named Theseus, who was supposed to have enlarged the city, built new temoles, and instituted new laws for the whole people of Attica; but there is no good authority for believing that Theseus was ? real character, nor is it supposed that the laws and institu tions of the Athenian state were the work of any particular individual, but rather that the constitution was gradually formed by different legislators.4 6The name of Theseus was, however, revered by the Athenians ; he was worshipped as one of the gods, and a magnificent temple at Athens, the remains of which are still in existence, was dedicated to him in after times.0 \"When the people of Attica came to be united as above mentioned, they were divided into four tribes, each tribe being subdivided into three bodies, called Phratries, as the Roman tribes were divided into Curi\u00e6 ; and each phratria was made up of a number of clans, similar to the Roman o-entes, every clan being a union of many families or houses, and none were free citizens of Athens who did not belong to these bodies. The number of clans composing a phratria, and of families composing a clan, although usually stated to have been thirty, could not have been always the same.rf Every clan was bound together by the performance of re ligious rites at certain seasons, in honour of the same god, and also by mutual rights of succession to property, and by an exclusive burial place.

C. the monarchy was abolished at Athens, and a chief magistrate appointed, called Archon, whose office was for life, but whose power was more limited than that of the kings. This revolution took place before the existence of historical records, and as the story connected with it rests on tradition only, there is no certainty of its truth. 8The legend says, that Attica being invaded by an army from the Peloponnesus, ambas sadors were sent to consult the Oracle at Delphi as to what would be the event of the war, and received for reply, that the Dorians would not conquer, if the king of Athens should be slain. 9The religion of the ancient Greeks and Romans taught them to believe that the gods held a direct communi cation with mortals by means of Oracles, and that of Apollo, in the Temple of Delphi, a city of Phocis on the slopes of Mount Parnassus, was the most celebrated, not only in Greece, but in all heathen countries. The temple stood in a consecrated grove, its roof was hung with garlands of laurel, a tree especially dedicated to Apollo, and it contained a golden statue of that god, before which the sacred fire was kept perpetually burning. '\"There were six priests de voted to the service of the temple, whose office, hereditary in the most noble families of Delphi, gave them great in fluence, for it was they who delivered the answers of the Oracle to those who came to seek information respecting future events. Although it was confidently believed by the Greeks that the answers came from Apollo himself, yet we may easily imagine that the priests, who were in general, among the leading men of the state, would frame the replies so as to suit their own political views; and this, in"], [31, "GREECE. 23 later times, was well known to be the case. \"The temple was built on a spot where, from a cavity in the ground, a thick vapour issued, of such a nature that it produced a temporary delirium in those who inhaled it. Over this jpening was placed a high tripod, on which, when a question was to be proposed, the Pythia, a priestess or prophetess belonging to the temple, was seated. The opening was then uncovered, and the smoke ascending, soon affected the senses of the Pythia to whom the question had been given by the chief priest, and whose wild incoherent manner was mistaken for inspiration. The words uttered by her while in that state were noted down by the priests on their tablets. and arranged into a verse or couplet, which was delivered to the enquirers as the answer of the god; but it was always so artfully worded as to admit of more than one interpreta- tion ; so that the prophecy would sometimes appear to be fulfilled, even when the event was contrary to what had been expected from it, and thus it escaped the imputation o_ falsehood.4 The vapour was so powerful that it sometimes threw the unfortunate Pythia into convulsions and has even been known to cause death.0 It is impossible for us to tell whether the priests of Apollo were wilful imposters, or whether they really believed in the arts they practised ; but it is certain that no institution ever gained so great an influence over the affairs, both public and private, of any nation, as the Delphic Oracle over those of the Greeks, 12In the early ages, some young girl of humble parentage, was usually chosen to fill the office of Pythia, and having once entered the Temple, was never suffered to leave it again or to marry; but in consequence of a youthful priestess having broken her vows and fled, a law was made that no one should enter upon the a Smith's ' Greek and Roman Antiquities.\" * Library of Useful Knowledge\u2014 History of Greece t Smith's 'Greek and Roman Antiquities'"], [32, "GREECE. 24 office till she was past the age of fifty,\" so that we may hope it was then a matter of choice, not compulsion. \"There were certain days appointed in every month to consult the oracle, when every one who came paid a fee, and sacrificed a goat, an ox, or a sheep, the flesh of which was shared among the priests, whose tables were thus constantly supplied with excellent fare ; and when ambassadors were sent from any of the states, it was usual for them to present valuable offerings, besides the customary fees and sacrifices ; so that the treasures heaped up in the temple were immense, and always increasing.4 For a long time there was only one Pythia; but at length the visitors became so numerous, that it was found necessary to have two, and in case of accident another priestess was kept in the temple to supply the place of which soever of them might be overcome by the effect of the vapour.0 The Athenians had sacred state vessels to convey their embassies to Delphi, as well as to the great religious festivals, and these were never used on any other occasions. 14The answer given by the Oracle respecting the invasion of Attica, was, on the return of the ambassadors, communicated to Codrus, the king of Athens, who according to the legend, resolved, like a true patriot, to sacrifice himself for the good ol i.it country. He therefore, went to the enemy's camp in disguise, and began to quarrel with the soldiers, who slew nm in the straggle, not suspecting him to be the king; but when the fact was discovered, the invaders abandoned their enterprise, as hopeless, and returned home, for such was their belief in the prediction of the oracle, that they looked upon the cause as decided by the death of Codrus. d It is said that in consequence of this event, and to mark their reverence for his patriotism, the nobles abolished the title of king, and a Smith's ' Greek and Roman Antiquities.' b Thirlwall. c Smith's ' Greek and Roman Antiquities.' d Smith's ' Biography and Mythology ' Codrxsa."], [33, "GREECE. 25 elected a chief magistrate, who, as before stated, bore the title of Archon.\" 15The Archonship was for life, and heredi tary, till about one hundred and sixty years after the death of Codrus, when it was resolved that the Archon should be elected only for ten years; and in 6S4 B.

So severely had this system been enforced, that some had even been driven to preserve their own free dom, by availing themselves of the law which allowed them to sell their sons under eighteen, and their daughters and sisters who were unmarried.\" Oppression often leads to crime, and there was, no doubt, a great deal of robbery and disorder, but instead of endeavouring to remedy the distresses of the people, the legislators made still severer laws, which led, as we shall find, to another and greater revolution than had yet taken place. 13The author of the new laws was Draco, the chief Archon, a man of stern, inflexible charac ter, who thought to keep order by exciting terror, and who therefore made death the punishment for almost all offences. These were the first written laws of Athens, and their ex treme severity caused it to be said that they were written in blood. 19The people were naturally dissatisfied with so tyrannical a government, and an ambitious nobleman, named Cylon, t'x:k advantage of the popular discontent to raise a revolt, with a view of placing himself at the head of the state. 20With the aid of many powerful friends he seized the citadel, which was besieged by the government forces, and he was compelled to surrender, but contrived to escape, while the rest of the conspirators took refuge in the temple of Athene, trusting for safety to the sanctity of the place. They were, however, induced by promises of pardon to come forth, but were all put to death notwithstanding, and this act of cruel treachery and impiety was the cause of the revolu tion that followed.4 Everybody was struck with horror and consternation, believing that the gods would send some great misfortune on the state to punish the sacrilege ; so, to avert the dreadful calamity, a court was formed of three hundred of the principal citizens, to try the offenders, who were condemned to exile. 21Then Solon, a man of noble a Qrote's 'History of Greece.* b TlurlwalL"], [35, "GREECE. 27 birth, whose name stands high among the legislators of ancient times, was made chief Archon, and framed a new constitution for the Athenians,22 B. C. 594. 23His first care was to relieve the distress of the middle classes by releasing their mortgaged estates, and abolishing the law of enslaving debtors, at the same time passing a decree that all who were in slavery for debt should be restored to freedom. He next reduced the interest on all outstanding debts, thus of course reducing them also ; as, for instance, if a man had bor rowed twenty pounds, for which he was to pay five pounds a year interest, the debt would, in four years, amount to forty pounds , but by a law which should reduce the interest to half of its current rate, then the debt would be but thir ty pounds. This was a great relief to the debtors, and in order to make the payment of their debts easier, Solon altered the value of the coinage, making seventy-three old drachmas worth one-hundred new,\" so that if a man owed a hundred, he could pay his debt with seventy-three. A drachma was the principal silver coin of the Greeks, its value differing a little in different states, but at Athens it was worth rather less than ten pence of our money.4 24The new legislator made a very important alteration in the govern ment by enacting that all men of a certain amount of pro perty, should be admitted as candidates for the Archonship, a measure that removed in a great degree that marked dis tinction hitherto kept up between the nobles and com moners, and gave a share of power to the people which mio-ht enable them to protect themselves from the oppres sion of the higher classes.0 Before this time, none but men of rank could hold any lio-h offices of state, but now, property, not nobility, was to be the qualification for all appointments, and in furtherance of these reforms,25 the free aommoners were divided into s Thirlwall b Smith's ' Greek and Roman Antiquities ' c Thirlwall."], [36, "28 GREECE. four classes, according to the amount of income produced by their land, each class having certain rights and privileges granted to it, but, at the same time being made subject to stated duties and liabilities. 26The first class comprehended all whose annual income was five hundred or more measures of produce, either corn, wine, oil, or whatever it might be, the value of a measure being estimated at one drachma ; and all men of this class were eligible for the Archonship and the highest offices of state. The amount appears very small, not being more than twenty pounds of our money in the present day; but we may judge of its value then, by the fact that the common price of a sheep was one drachma.\" The second class was composed of such as could afford to keep a war horse, and its members were obliged, in war time, to serve as cavalry soldiers, without pay, and to provide their own arms. The third class consisted of those whose farms were very small, and they had to serve as foot soldiers, and to find their own arms, for the Greeks had no paid armies, but every freeman was bound to aid in the defence of his \u00bbwn state. These two classes were admitted to the minor offices under government ; but the fourth class, which com prised all the free labourers, could not hold any office, but had the right of attending public assemblies, both stated and extraordinary, the former held four times in five-and-thirty days, the latter summoned especially on unforeseen occasions; and voted also in the election of the Archons and other magistrates.4 The property tax was graduated according to the annual income ; the highest class being rated at twelve times the amount of one year's produce ; the second class, at ten times, and the third class at five times. The fourth class was exempt.0 27It is sometimes stated that Solon in stituted a court of justice called the Areopagus, for the trial of criminal causes, which was held on an eminence called a Grote's ' History of Greece.' 4 ThirlwaU. c Grote's ' History of Greece."], [37, "GREECE. 29 Mars' hill, in the centre of Athens, west of the Acropolis : but it appears that this tribunal was in existence Jong before the time of the great lawgiver, who only altered its consti tution and augmented its powers. The foundations of the court are still to be seen, formed of immense square stones, on which a platform rested in ancient times, where the members sat in the open air ; and here it was that St. Paul preached to the Athenians,\" as we read in the seventetath chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, ' Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, \u2014 ' Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.' \" A trial in the Court of Areopagus always lasted two days, during which the criminal was left at liberty, so that he might leave the country, if he chose ; and they who knew they should be found guilty, always did so ; but if a man trusted that the evidence was insufficient to convict him, he would perhaps remain, in the hope of an acquittal; and then, if he were adjudged gudty, he was put to death, and this was usuallv done, at Athens, by forcing the culprit to drink a cup of hemlock, which is poison.4 28Before the time of Solon, the Areopagus was merely a court of justice, for the trial of capital offences ; but he gave to its members a power similar to that which was afterwards exercised by the Roman Censors. They were entrusted with the care of the moral conduct of the people, and had the right of going into their houses at all times, to see that they did not live extravagant ly, or act improperly in any way; and if they discovered any thing that was not right, they were empowered to fine, or otherwise punish the offender.

RISE OF THE SPARTAN STATE. \u25a0Sparta was a city of Laconia, the most southern province of the Peloponnesus, and, at some early period unknown, wai conquered by a body of Dorian invaders, who settled there and divided amongst them the surrounding territory, wh.ch was called Laced\u00e6mon. From this point, it seems, they extended their dominion gradually over the whole of La conia, imposing a tribute on the conquered people, who were treated as vassals and looked upon by the conquerors in much the same light as the Saxons were regarded by the Normans in England after the conquest.\" 2The new lords of the country called themselves Spartans and Lace d\u00e6monians, while the conquered race retained the name oi Laconians ; and this distinction was maintained for ages, as the proud Spartans prohibited intermarriages, and never ad mitted the people of Laconia to an equality with themselves. 3They were not allowed to exercise any political rights, and were excluded from all offices and appointments ; but the trade and agriculture of the country was entirely in their hands, for the Spartans were all warriors, and unlike other Greeks, looked upon commerce and husbandry as degrading pursuits.4 \u25a0'Besides the Spartans and free Laconians, there was, in the Spartan state, a numerous race of serfs, termed Helots, who were different from any other slaves in Greece, except in Thessaly, where a similar class existed under the name of Penest\u00e6.0 They were bound to the soil, and bought and sold with the lands they cultivated ; but the owner of an estate was not the absolute master of his helots, for they were the property of the state, and could only be emanci- a Smith's ' Greek and Roman Antiquities.' t ThirlwalL c Smith's ' Greek and Roman Antiquities"], [41, "GREECE. 33 spated by the government.0 5The origin of the helots is tin known, but they were probably the village population or rustics of the country, and might perhaps have been in a state of villenage under the former proprietors of the soil. c Their condition, however, was very wretched, and it is to be feared they were treated with much cruelty, although some of the statements respecting the barbarity of the Spartans towards them, are greatly exaggerated. There seems, how ever, no reason to doubt that the secret commission (hence called cryptia) given yearly to certain young Spartans to range the country in particular directions, armed with con cealed daggers, had as its object not only the intimidation of the disaffected helots, but their assassination if judged ne cessary. In a well-known passage of Thucydides we learu that the Spartans, on an occasion when the city was much weakened, dreading the spirit of the bolder helots, publicly invited those of them who thought themselves worthy of freedom, to come forward and claim it. The two thousand selected as the worthiest were feasted, and crowned them selves with garlands, and then suddenly disappeared ; nor could the historian, though certain of the fact, learn the exact manner in which they were put to death. 6Severai families of helots lived on every estate in small huts, with a piece of ground, for which they paid their master a fixed measure of corn, wine, and oil ; besides which, they culti vated his land, attended him at the public meals, and per formed many other services.0 The household servants, both male and female, were all of the helot class, there being few, if any, other slaves in the country. d In war time, every Spartan took seven helots with him to the field, who served as light armed troops ; that is, they had no defensive armour, like other foot soldiers, who wore helmets and breast-plates.

D"], [42, "GREECE. 34 7The government of Sparta was different from that first established in the other Grecian states, it being administered by two kings, of equal authority, and when either of thfim died, his place was taken by his son or nearest relative. 8The Spartan legends attributed this singular constitution to Aristodemus, a great chief, supposed to be one of the Heracleid\u00e6, or sons of Hercules, and the reputed conqueror and founder of the Spartan state. It is said that he left the kingdom to his twin sons Eurysthenes and Procles, who reigned jointly, and as the heirs of both had an equal right to the throne, it was decreed that there should always be two kings of Sparta, and this strange form of government was continued down to the latest times of the Spartan monarchy. Although this story is a fable, it is probable that the custom of a double sovereignty might arise from the circumstance of twin brothers reigning together or from two chiefs contributing equally towards the conquest and agreeing to share the throne.\" 9The history of Sparta is involved in complete obscurity until towards the close of the ninth century before the Christian era, when, we are told, a new code of laws was promulgated by Lycurgus, a great statesman and legislator, who governed Sparta as regent during the minority of his nephew, Chardaus, the infant heir of one of the kings. It is said that at the time when Lycurgus entered upon his office, the Spartans were in a state of anarchy, and a civd war was raging among them. The new ruler seems to have exerted his influence for the restoration of order, and for the establishment of such a system as should secure the ascendancy of the Spartans over the people they had sub dued. 10It is generally stated that he made a new division of lands, all over the country, assigning an equal portion to every family, whether Spartan or Laconian ; and Plutarch a Thirlwall."], [43, "GREECE. 35 relates that, gazing on the uniform aspect of the fields toward the close of the harvest, Lycurgus exclaimed that all Laco nia looked like a heritage newly divided among brothers. It is, however, hardly probable that the Spartans would give to their vassal subjects, estates as large as their own, for the produce of the land constituted the wealth of the people, and consequently such a distribution would have placed the conquered on an equality with the conquerors. It is there fore supposed that if a new division of landed property really took place, the allotments of the Spartans might have been equal, and those of the Laconians also, but the latter smaller than the former\" \"It appears, however, that when Lycurgus instituted his laws, the Spartans had not completed the con quest of Laconia, but were only in possession of the territory around Sparta ; so that it is most probable no fresh division of the lands was made, and that the great reforms of the lawgiver were effected by imposing a rigorous system of discipline, to which rich and poor were alike subjected,4 and thus the equality that existed among the Spartans was not an equality with regard to property, but consisted in the obligation every man was under of submitting to live, from in fancy to old age, according to certain rules and regulations that made the course of life the same to all. 12The laws of Lycurgus were framed with a view to make the Spartans a nation of fearless soldiers, able to endure the severest hardships, and ready to sacrifice all private interests and affections to support the glory of the state, and to maintain the Dorian ascendancy over a country which their ancestors had taken by force, and where the people were often disposed to revolt. The system he established was rigid in the extreme ; and although it had the effect of making the Spartans hardy warriors, careless of danger, and brave to excess : it also rendered them harsh and un feeling, gave them a contempt for domestic life, and de a Thirlwall. b Grote's ' History of Greece'"], [44, "36 GREECE. stroyed the social ties that bind the members of a family to each other. 13The boys were taken from their parents at seven years of age, to be brought up by the state, in schools established in different parts of the country for that purpose, where they were practised in all sorts of exercises that would strengthen their limbs and make them bold and active. They were allowed to wear only one garment, a very coarse woollen dress, short and scanty, without sleeves ; and were accus tomed to run, leap, and climb up rugged places with bare feet. Their food was of the coarsest kind, they had to gather reeds for their beds, and sometimes they were ser_t out to provide their own fare by carrying off any thing they could get from the farms, the successful pilferer being highly praised by the masters; while those who were caught in the act of stealing, were obliged to submit to the consequences.

At the age of eighteen they accompanied their fathers to the public halls, where they waited at table, for it was the custom of the Spartans to dine always in public ; and the conduct of the young men was watched by officers appointed for that purpose, so that they were obliged to behave with the strictest propriety.

Game was procured by hunting in the public forests, and at a later period a small contribution in money was made for sauces and seasoning.4 No persons, not even the kings, were allowed to be absent, without good reason, and then they were expected to send their contribu tion. The citizens did not sleep at their houses, but ot the public barracks to which they belonged.

The years which followed were devoted to the civil service of the state, and to the superintendence of the young, and cheered by the respect and precedence yielded by a grateful country. In his extreme age, the Spartan could still enjoy the society of his equals, in the ' Lesche,' a place dedicated to public conversation in Greek cities, but, at Sparta, chiefly reserved for the convenience of the old. The women lived at home, but were subjected to a training almost as hardy as that of the men, and consequently had verv little of feminine softness in their manners or character. !6The young girls were made to practice athletic exercises, were not accustomed to any indulgences, and wore only ths une dress, similar to that of the boys.0 TMriwtdl. * Grote's ' History of Gre-<\" e Smith's ' \u201e.eek ana froinan Antiquities.

The kings, who completed the number to thirty, were the presidents of this assembly, as well as the high priests of the state and generals of the armies :\" The office of the five ephors (overseers,) ultimately the highest in the state, was at first of too necessary a nature to excite any jealousy of its growing importance. Magistrates under this name were early established in other Dorian cities as inspectors of public manners and education. The absence of the kings on warlike expeditions gradually transferred to them the general executive power of Sparta ; while, profes sing, like the Roman Tribunes, to stand between the people and the senate, every measure which they proposed was carried, and their own aggrandizement (their real aim) was the consequent result.

The kingdom of Sparta continued to increase in power, and became formidable to all the surrounding tribes, but more especially to the people of Messenia, the province next to Laconia, in the south west of the Peloponnesus. 18The Messenians had constantly to complain of the en croachments of their warlike neighbours, which they did not fail to retaliate when opportunity offered, till at length a regular war was begun B. C. 743, which lasted twenty years, and terminated, in the subjugation of Messenia to the Spartan dominion. During the wars the towns had been destroyed, the lands laid waste, and many thousands of the people had perished, therefore they were too much weakened to make any farther opposition for a long time, and submitted to be considered vassals of Sparta, and to pay a tribute for their lands of half the produce.4 In about forty years, (B.C. 685,) 19however, when another generation had grown up to manhood, Aristomenes, a brave patriot of royal birth, excited his countrymen to make an effort for the recovery of their in dependence, and became their chief. Many valorous exploits and daring deeds are related of this adventurous leader, who, on one occasion, it is said, ventured alone, at night, to the city of Sparta, which had no walls, and fixed a shield on the Temple of Minerva, with an inscription to the effect that Aristomenes dedicated that shield to the goddess, from the SDoiis ef the Spartans.

But no legend ever left an Oracle unful filled, so we are told that although the schoolmaster was not a good general, his songs animated the soldiers under all misfortunes, and assisted greatly in achieving the conquest of Messenia. The true position of Tyrtaeus at Sparta seems very doubtful, but it is certain that his poems were long held in great estimation, and it was a custom in the Spartan camp, after supper, for each person, in turn, to sing some of his verses.4 The struggle between the Spartans and Messenians seems to have been very similar to that between the Normans and Saxons in England, and lasted much longer : for it was seventeen years before the whole country was reduced to subjection, so well did the people fight for their liberty, constantly harassing the Spartan state by predatory incursions. On one occasion they carried off a number of Laconian maidens from the festival of Diana, which was held once a year at Caryie, in Arcadia, and cele- a Thirlwall. \u00ab Smith's 'B'ojrrapl t and Mythology.

C. and retired to the Isle of Rhodes, where he spent the rest of his days in peace ; but his name was ever dear to the people of his country, and he was the hero of many ballads from which, together with the poems of Tyr t\u00e6us, the history of the wars is chiefly taken.\" 22The con quest of Messenia produced considerable changes at Sparta, for in consequence of the number of citizens who had fallen, the franchise had been extended to some of the Laconians, and it is said they were permitted to marry the widows of those who had been killed in the wars ; but in after times those who were of pure Dorian families, held themselves far superior to the offspring of these mixed marriages, so that after Messenia was added to the kingdom of Sparta, there was no longer that equality which till then had subsisted among the Spartans. During these wars, the city of Taren tum, in Italy, was founded by fugitive Greeks from Laconia, but the cause of their emigration is uncertain. The Spar tans had been assisted by the Corinthians, who possessed the best fleet of any of the Greeks till Solon began to im prove the Attic navy; and, owing to its shipping and excel lent situation for trade, Corinth enjoyed more wealth and prosperity than any of the states of Greece till long after the time of which we are now speaking.4 23It was during the wars of Messenia that the Corinthians made a great im provement in ship building, by constructing large lofty ves sels with three banks of oars, whereas the old galleys had but one bank.

Still, the general state of Greece was very different from what it had been in the days of Homer, both as re garded the appearance of the country and the manners of the people. 'The cities were greatly improved, the houses being now frequently built of stone or brick, with tiled roofs, and furnished in a much more handsome and commodious manner than in early times. Most of the rooms had stone floors, but the walls were as yet only whited, the Greeks not beginning to paint the interior of their houses till about two centuries later. There were always two sets of apart ments in a house ; the upper being generally occupied by the females of the family, who lived apart from the men, as they do in eastern countries, and did not hold so high a rank in society as the Roman ladies, nor were they treated with the same degree of consideration and respect. 3A husband, in Greece, did not look upon his wife as a com panion, but as an inferior person, whose duty it was to superintend his household ; therefore, it was never thought necessary to pay any attention to the education of girls, whose minds being thus totally uncultivated, caused, in reality, that inferiority which does not exist in countries a This chapter is taken from tne Dictionary of Antiquities, except whe,\"\u00ab otl-Crwi&c _tate<_."], [52, "44 GREECF. where both sexes are equally educated. Young women were not allowed to be seen by any man but their fathers and brothers, except at some of the public festivals, when they took a part in the procession ; on which occasions, a young man would sometimes take the opportunity of choos ing a pretty maiden for his wife; but the damsel herself had no choice in the matter, a daughter being entirely at the disposal of her parents, and, in most cases, never seeing her future husband till the day of her betrothal. -The only part of Greece where the women enjoyed more liberty was Sparta, where the young girls might go abroad unveiled, and were allowed to be present at all the public games; but even there, the married women never appeared abroad except veiled. 4The Athenians had particular laws respecting mar riage, as, for instance, a citizen of Athens was forbidden to marry a woman of any other state ; and an heiress was ob liged to marry her nearest relative, unless he objected, if which case his right passed to the next of kin ; a custom that prevailed among the ancient Jews, of which we find an example in the Book of ' Ruth.' This law was made to guard against the alienation of property from a family by the marriage of heiresses with strangers ; and so strictly was it observed, that, even after a woman was married, if a claimant came forward, who had a better right by a nearer relationship, the husband was compelled to give her up, together with her inheritance. A man might even put away a former wife to marry an heiress, if he chose ; but was then obliged to give back the portion he had received with her; for, as the marriage ties could be very easily broken by Grecian husbands, a dower was always settled on a bride, as a provision in case she should, at any time, be sent back to her friends. 5The property of a father was divided equally among his sons, who were bound to give marriage portions to their sisters, and marry them to relatives ; but if a girl was lest"], [53, "GREECE. 45 an orphan, without an inheritance, and had no brother, her nearest relation was obliged either to marry her himself, or give her a dower, and find her a husband. Lycurgus, how ever, banished the custom of giving dowries out of Sparta, that no woman's poverty should deprive her of a husband.\" 6 A marriage was conducted thus. The young people were first betrothed ; that is, brought together in the presence of their relatives, when the contract was agreed to, the amount of dower settled, and the wedding day fixed. When it came, the morning was spent in sacrifices and other religious rites, for which purpose there was a consecrated hearth or altar in every house ; and towards evening the bridegroom came to conduct his bride to her new abode. She wore a splendid peplum, or shawl, which served for a veil and was crowned with a wreath of flowers. The bridegroom also wore a chapiet of flowers, and a gay pallium, embroidered with many colours. There was always a nuptial procession, foi which a chorus was usually engaged, and the bride rode in a chariot, with her husband on one side and one of his inti mate friends on the other. The friends of both parties walked or rode in the procession, with attendants carrying torches, and, as they moved along, the hymeneal song was sung to the sound of flutes, all who passed stopping to offer their congratulations to the newly married pair. The door of the house was hung with festoons of ivy, and as they entered, sweetmeats were scattered before them. Then came the marriage feast, the only occasion on which both sexes partook of an entertainment together, but all the female part of the company sat at a separate table, with the bride. On the following day, presents were sent by all the friends, and the bride was then registered in the phratria, or clan of hei husband, to which she. from that time, belonged. 7The naming of a child was celebrated by the relatives of a Plutarch"], [54, "46 GREECE. both parents with a festival called Amphidrcmia, (the nurses running round the family-hearth with the infant,) held at home, in the evening, when each guest brought a present for the child; and, if it was a boy, the outside of the house was decorated with olive branches, but if a girl, with festoons of wool. A grand supper was provided for the occasion, after which the ceremony was performed thus : The nurse carried the infant round the fire kindled on the sacred hearth, the name being given at the same time, which implied that the parents presented it to the gods of the family as a mem ber of the house ; and all the guests then walked round the hearth, as witnesses that the ceremony had been duly per formed. The Greeks had only one name, which was chosen by the father and could be altered by him. By the Athen ian laws, a son was bound to maintain his parents in old age, and if he neglected his duty, or behaved undutifully to them in any way, he was punished by a heavy fine. Greeks attached great importance to the burial of the dead, which always took place on the third day, before sunrise. The deceased was carried to the place of interment on an open bier, arrayed in a white robe with a crown of flowers or parsley on the head. The male relatives walked before, the females behind, and the procession was attended by hired mourners, who played dirges on the flute. Sometimes the body was burned on a funeral pile, when the ashes were gathered into an urn and placed in a tomb ; sometimes it was buried in a coffin of clay or earthenware, with the head looking towards the rising sun. The tombs were usually by the roadside near the gates of the city, where handsome monuments were often erected, and, on certain days, offerings were made to the dead, and flowers placed on the tomb. The mourning dress was black, and worn for one month, during which the family did not appear in public. \"Very little change had taken place in the fashion of tiro"], [55, "viREECE. 47 Greek costume, except that at Athens, and some other prin cipal cities, men of the higher classes wore, under the pallium, a long linen dress, with sleeves, introduced from Asia, and called the Ionian chiton ; but the dress most general in Greece was the short tunic without sleeves, called the Dorian chiton. The women often twisted handkerchiefs round their heads, like turbans. The pallium was still the principal garment in male attire, and was often in the form of a long scarf, and arranged according to the taste of the wearer. The ladies wore shawls much larger and of a finer texture than the pallium, sometimes beautifully embroidered with gold and colours; and their chitons were made of fine linen, with wide sleeves looped up to the elbow with brooches. Costly shawls were often presented by rich people as offerings to the temples. The most splendid of these were probably brought from the east, but the art of weaving had been practised in Greece from a very early period, and 10in every domestic establishment there was a weaving apparatus, a number of slaves being generally employed in making cloth for the use of the family. Felting was another art known as early as the time of Homer, and felt caps were often used in travelling, but, in general no covering was worn on the head, except by shepherds and agricultural labourers, whose cap had usually a broad brim to shelter them from the heat of the sun. \"The Greeks, like the Romans, ploughed their land three times a year. Their ploughs were of various forms, but all very simple, and much like the old fashioned implements used here in the last century. They thrashed the corn in the field on a raised floor covered with clay and rolled till quite hard and smooth. Sometimes they used a flail, sometimes employed cattle to tread out the corn ; and their carts and waggons were always drawn by oxen. The corn was either pounded in a mortar, or ground between two mill stones worked by women slaves ; there being neither windmills nor watermills in Greece. The soil of"], [56, "48 GREECE. Attica was not very favourable for the cultivation of wheat, and there was only enough barley grown in the province for about two thirds of the consumption ; therefore the corn trade was an important branch of commerce, and produced a considerable revenue to the state. 12The corn laws were very strict, the dealers not being allowed to make above a certain profit, and if any conspiracy was detected among them to raise the price, the offenders were liable to be punished with death. It was also unlawful to sell corn grown in Attica elsewhere than in Athens, and two thirds of all that was imported was also to be taken there, and nc where else, for sale. I3The chief produce of Attica was wine and oil, so that the greater part of the land was covered with vineyards and olive plantations, which furnished large supplies of olive oil to Egypt. 14The Greeks knew but .little of horticulture, and probably had no ornamental flower gardens, although some sorts of flowers, chiefly roses, lilies, and violets, were cultivated for the purpose of making garlands, which were used on numerous occasions besides those already mentioned, especially at the public festivals, and in making sacrifices. when the head of the victim was usually adorned with a chaplet. 15There was a festival held every year, by the Athenians, called the Apaturia, which lasted three days, and its purpose was to register the names of all the children born in that year, in their respective phratries, in order to make them free citizens of Athens. On the first day, the citizens met at public suppers prepared for the occasion ; on the second, sacrifices were made at the temples; and on the third, every child was taken by its father. before the assem bled members of his phratria, or family, who were asked whether they knew any cause why it should not be admitted as one of their body; and if no objection was made, the child was duly registered, and a sacrifice of a sheep or a goat of fered in its name to the tutelar divinity of that particular"], [57, "GREECE. 49 clan. There was a great deal of festivity and rejoicing on these occasions, and poems were recited by the boys, a prize being awarded to him who acquitted himself the best. It is now necessary to say something of the religious festivals of the Greeks, which obtained so much celebrity and had, by this time, assumed the character of important political institutions.\" There were four grand national festivals, l6the greatest of which was that called the Olym- pic games, held in honour of Jupiter, once in four vears, at Olympia, which was not so much a town, as a collection of temples, on the plain of Elis, in Eleia, the most western province of the Peloponnesus. '''From these games originated the custom of reckoning time by Olym- piads, or periods of four years, as we reckon by centuries, or periods of one hundred ; and this mode of computation was begun 776 B. C, when the Olympic Games, which had been discontinued, in consequence probably of the unsettled state of the country, were revived by the king of Elis and by Lycurgus, the Spartan Legislator, so that the interval lsfrom Midsummer 776, to Midsummer 772, B. C. was the first Olympiad. The Olympic, and the other great festivals, were of importance, in a political point of view, by bringing together the people of different Grecian states, and keeping up some degree of national union amongst them. In war time, hostilities were suspended during the games, and the territory in which they were celebrated was held sacred, so that it would have been sacrilege to enter it as an enemy till the festival was ended. Embassies were sent to represent the several states of Greece, all vying with each other in the magnificence of their appearance, and the costliness of their offerings. The great temple at Olympia, stood in a sacred grove, called the Aetis, and all who came to the testival made an offering to Jupiter, the god of the temple, \u2022 Grote, Thirlwall. E"], [58, "50 GREECE. and paid a fee to the priests, one of whom stood at the door and with a branch of laurel sprinkled those who went in with water from a vase by his side. No women were per mitted to attend these games, which, the fourteenth Olympiad, consisted only of foot races. In the eighteenth, the wrestling match was added, with leaping, quoits, and throwing the javelin; in the twenty-third Olympiad, the xixing match was introduced ; in the twenty-fifth, which corresponded with the year, B. C. 680, chariot races; and n the year, B. C. 648, the list was increased by horse races, and races of men in full armour. 20The festival lasted only one day until after the first Persian invasion, when it was extended to five days.\" The competitors were usually men of high rank, and as w ich importance was attached to the gaining of a victory, as if they were contesting a battle on which the fate of tht ir respective nations depended ; nor is this surprising, 2,a. great honours were bestowed on the victor, who was set ted on a throne, and crowned with an olive wreath, cut from a tree in the sacred grove, while his name was pro cla med by a herald, with all the pomp of proclaiming a sov ereign. On his return home, he was conducted into the city where he resided, in a triumphal procession like a great conqueror, and greeted by his fellow citizens with joyful acc.a mations. Ata subsequent period, when the fine arts began to be cultivated in Greece, poets, painters, sculptors and musi- cians , used to exhibit their performances at the public gam es, and judges were appointed to award the prizes. 22The Pythian Games were as highly famed as those of Olym pia, and were held at Delphi, on a plain which was \u25a0consi dered to have the best Hippodromus or race course in Gretee. They were celebrated in every third Olympic a Grote*!

The other great national festivals were the Nemean and the Isthmian games; the former held in the second and fourth, and the latter, in the first and third years of each Olym piad ;\u25a0 the Isthmian festival at Corinth, and the Nemean at Nemea, in Argos, one of the Peloponnesian states. The games were enlivened by the performances of the chorusses and always closed with processions, sacrifices, and feasting, when the victors took the highest places prepared for the principal people. All festivals bore some resemblance to a fair, as goods were displayed for sale, while sports formed an attraction for the common people, one of their favourite amusements being to make a goat skin slippery with oil, and try to dance upon it without falling. He who succeeded had the skin for his prize. 23There were a great many smaller religious festivals held in every part of Greece, among which the most remarkable, were the Dionysia, or feasts of Bacchus, celebrated four times in the year, in all the rural districts, with drinking and noisy mirth of all sorts. Those who joined in these revels used to wear masks and disguise themselves in various ways, some as satyrs, or gods of a rude and savage na ture, supposed to inhabit the woods ; while others would put on female attire, and in these disguises would perform grotesque dances, singing bacchanal songs. The Dionysia were all connected with wine making, and, at the season of the vintage, the slaves were allowed to share in the festival. 24There were secret rites and ceremonies connected with the religion of the Greeks, called Mysteries, which were always celebrated at night in some secluded place, to which only a chosen few were admitted, and they were bound to secrecy, like freemasons ; the most celebrated of these were a G.ote's ' History of Greece,'"], [60, "52 GREECE. held at Eleusis, in Attica. It is supposed that these societies were instituted at the time of the Dorian invasion, for the purpose of preserving the ancient form of worship ; and afterwards continued, to keep up the worship of some par ticular divinity ; but although it was suspected that the priests and greatest statesmen belonged to them, the names of the members were always concealed, nor was it known to any but the initiated themselves what was the real object of their meetings.

(594 to 492 B. C.) \u25a0For some years after the retirement of Solon, the chief power at Athens was disputed between three of the nobles, each of whom had a strong party to support his claim. The contest was at length decided in favour of Peisistratus, for merly the intimate friend of Solon, and now the most popu lar man at Athens, for he had taken care to gain the good will of the lower orders by his liberality, and by throwing open his extensive gardens to the public without distinction, a great benefit to the poor people of a crowded city. 2Peisis tratus is chiefly celebrated for the great improvements he made at Athens, which in his time began to assume that magnificent appearance, of which so many traces are still visible. 3He adorned the city with many fine edifices, among which were a beautiful temple, dedicated to Apollo, and the Lyceum, a gymnasium, or public school of gymnas tic exercises,\" which formed an important part of education throughout Greece. There were schools of this kind in most of the cities, usually with public baths attached to them ; but about this time they began to be frequented more as places of amusement, than for the improvement of health and strength, and therefore it became a study to make them elegant and attractive.4 4The Lyceum consisted of stately buildings, surrounded by gardens and groves ; whither the young Athenians resorted for the practise of athletic games and exercises.

One day, as he was taking a walk in the country, he saw a man at work on some very rugged ground, and sending one of his attendants to ask what it yielded ; the man replied in a surly tune, \u2014 \" Toil and trouble ; but I do not care so long as Peisistratus has his share.\" The answer caused /. hearty laugh, and the poor man was relieved from the tax.\" Peisistratus was called Tyrant of Athens, 6but the word tyrant among the Greeks, did not convey the sense which we attach to it, but was applied to any one who had attained to the sovereign power of a state, by his own personal influence, and who ruled, in great measure, by hi? own will ;* so that a tyrant might be a very good and be nevolent man, as in the case of Peisistratus, who was both charitable and humane, and is believed to have made the law, by which all citizens disabled in war were maintained by the state. c He encouraged learning, 7and is said to have formed the first library in Greece, and it was he who collected, and caused to be written, the poems of Homer, previously existing in scattered fragments, as brought into Greece from the Asiatic Colonies. 8These colonies were formed by Greeks, who had, from time to time, emigrated from dif ferent states, and established settlements on the coast of Asia, which was called by the general name of Ionia. There were thirteen Greek cities thus founded, one of them, Smyr na, retaining its name and prosperity to this day.1* \u00b0Many great cities were also founded by Greek colonists on the coast of Sicily, and in the south of Italy, all independent of a ThUrwaU. b Smith's 'Greek and Roman Antiquities.* \u2022 Thir.wall d Thiriwal."], [63, "GREECE. 55 the parent state, and not subject to its laws and government, like the Municipal Colonies of Rome and those of modern times, the colonists in most cases establishing themselves by conquest on lands already cultivated, after driving out, destroying, or enslaving the former possessors.\" The Greek settlements in Egypt have been already noticed, and the consequent advancement of literature in Greece, by the in troduction of the papyrus, a cheap and useful material for writing. 10It is generally believed that the arts of drawing, painting, and moulding in clay, were first cultivated by the Corinthians ; but it is probable that several other states of Greece, espe cially Argos, Aegina, Rhodes, and Crete, were celebrated for works of art as early as Corinth. In the time of Peisis tratus, the temple of Delphi was burnt by accident, and it was decreed by the Amphictyonic council, that one fourth of the expense of rebuilding it, should be borne by the Delphians, who were so heavily taxed for that purpose that they sent envoys through Greece for subscriptions ; and the handsome donations they received, among which was a large present of alum, from Amasis, king of Egypt, enabled them to rebuild the temple with Parian marble instead of stone, at a cost of three hundred talents, equal to \u00a3150,000/' \"Peisistratus died in the year, 527, B.

This plot was to be put in exeea tion at the celebration of the Panathen\u00e6, a great festival ot Minerva, at Athens, when all the citizens marched in pro cession, with spears and shields; and as this was the only oc casion on which they ever assembled with arms, the conspi rators were in hopes, by stabbing the two rulers and raising a cry of liberty, they should be able to excite a revolt. They succeeded in killing Hipparchus, but in all other respects the plot failed, and the principal conspirators were seized and put to death. 14After this event, Hippias grew stern, suspicious, and tyrannical, and at the end of four years, was deposed and sent into exile with tte whole of his family, when a nobleman, named Cleisthenes, who had made him self very popular, took the head of the government, and introduced a great many reforms, all tending to give more importance to the middle and lower orders, and to check the power of the great. 15In the first place, he abolished the four ancient tribes, substituting a new division of ten, each tribe being again subdivided into ten wards, called demes. just as our counties are divided into parishes.\" l6A deme contained a town or a village, and was governed by a local magistrate, called a demarch, whose duties were to hold assemblies for transacting the public business of the deme, to act as justice of the peace, and to keep a register of all the landholders in the district, in order to see that the property tax was duly paid.* 17Most of the taxes at Athens were farmed ; that is, some person, or company of persons would agree to pay a certain amount annually to the govern ment for a certain tax, which they then collected on their own account, taking their chance whether it might produce more or less than they paid for it ; though the risk could not be great, to judge by the customary eagerness of the tompetitors in bidding for the tax.

The Greek year was divided into twelve luna. months, the first day being always that of the new moon ; but as this did not make a full year, an intercalary month was added every third year, to preserve the order of time, and to make the calendar accord with the seasons. 20The fifty sitting members, who were called Prytanes, had the management of the treasury ; received ambassadors, and negotiated treates with other states ; but they could not declare war or make peace, as they were obliged to carry all matters of importance for decision to the national as semblies.'' The poor citizens were, by the laws of Solon. paid for their attendance at these assemblies, as it was not to be supposed that they could afford the time from their business, without compensation. 21It seems to have been about this time, that a singular custom was introduced called Ostracism, by which any citizen suspected of being a dangerous person could be sent into exile without a trial, anu even without being accused of any crime.' 32lt does i Smith's ' Greek and Roman Antiquities.* b Smith's ' Greek and Roman Antiquities.' c Grote's ' History of Greece.' d Library of Useful Knowledge.\u2014 History of Greece. c Thirlwall."], [66, "58 GREECE. not appear that any name was mentioned in proposing to the public assembly that the Ostracism should be put in force ; but on the day when the votes were to be taken, the agora was enclosed with a railing, in which ten openings were left for the different tribes to enter separately, and as they went in, each man put into a tub set for that purpose, a shell or piece of earthenware, whence the term ostracism, on which was written the name of the statesman he desired to banish. At the end of the day, the votes we e counted, and if there were six-thousand given against any one person, he was doomed to exile for ten years.a The Ostracism was not often resorted to, and, in about ninety years, was dis continued altogether.

This was agreed to, and Cleomenes returned to Sparta, but soon re-appeared in Attica, with a powerful army, while 24the Beotians, who were in alliance with the Spartans, invaded the province on the other side, in conjunction with the Chalcidians, the people of the small 6tate of Chalcis in the Island of Eub\u0153a, situated between the coasts of Thessaly and Attica, and divided from the mainland by a narrow channel, called the Euripus. 25Finding themselves attacked on both sides, the Athenians hastened first to oppose the Spartans, but just as they were preparing for battle, the latter were deserted by their Co rinthian allies, and by one of their kings, Demaratus, whr a Grote's ' History of Greece.* -> Smith's 'Biography and Mythology.'

THE PERSIAN WARS. FROM THEIR COMMENCEMENT TO THE BATTLE OF SALAMIS. (492 to 480 B. C.) Darius was one of the greatest monarchs that ever reigned over the Persian Empire. His dominions extended from the \u00c6gean sea to the river Indus, and from the plains of Scythia to the Nile in Egypt. These vast realms he divided into twenty Satrapies, or Provinces, and appointed governors to rule over them, who were called Satraps, and lived like sovereign princes; but they were, in general, very oppressive, taxing people heavily to support their magnificence.\" The Greek cities of Ionia were governed by Greeks, as Darius wisely judged that the people would be more satisfied to live under his dominion, if the resident rulers were men of their own nation; and that those rulers, being dependent on him for the maintenance of their dignity, would feel it their interest to support his power. 'It happened, however, that Aristagoras, the Grecian governor of Miletus, was led by a chain of circumstances, to revolt, and he induced all the Asiatic Greeks to join him, with a view of throwing off the authority of the Persian king.* Aristagoras himself went to Sparta, with the hope of inducing Cleomenes to aid the revolted Ionians, and his visit is worthy of remark, as being probably the first occasion on which any thing like a map was seen in Europe. It was a tablet of bronze, whereon was engraved an outline of the earth, as far as it was then known, with the courses of rivers, and circuits of seas.

Aristagoras offered him ten talents, and the bribe being refused, gradually increased his offers to fifty, seeing, no doubt, that his resolution was giving way ; but the king's daughter, Gorgo, a little girl about eight years old, said, \"Go away, father, or he will do you harm;\" on which Cleomenes left the room to avoid the temptation.4 3The Ionians had also sent an ambassador to Athens, to ask assistance, and he arrived there just as the Athenians had received the message of Artaphernes, commanding them to restore Hippias, so that they had a double motive for going to war with the Persians. 'Twenty ships were accordingly sent from Athens, with five from Eretria, a small state in the Island of Eub\u0153a, and the forces of the combined fleet attacked and burned down the famous city of Sardis, which had been the capital of the kingdom of Lydia, in the time of Cr\u0153sus. A battle was fought soon afterwards, near Ephesus, where the Greeks were defeated with great loss ; on which the Athenians declined taking any farther part in the war, and returned to Europe. 5Darius then sent his armies against all the cities of Ionia, and the war was carried on for six years, when Miletus, the principal city of the Greeks in Asia, was taken by storm, and all the citizens who escaped death were carried into caotivity, and settled as a colony near the mouth of the Tigris.

Accordingly he did not raise their tribute, and instead of establishing a stricter control over them, he gave to all the Greek cities a republican form of government ; but, in return for these favours, required their assistance in punishing the Athenians and Eretrians for the burning of Sardis. He began by sending heralds to all the states of Greece to demand earth and water, as signs that they acknowledgad him as their sovereign lord, and some of them being afraid of entering into a contest with so power ful an empire, sent the required tokens.4 Thebes and \u00c6gina were among those that submitted to this degra dation ; but Athens and Sparta indignantly refused, while Cleomenes hastened to \u00c6gina, at the head of an army of Laced\u00e6monians, and compelled the chiefs of that state to own its subjection to the Spartan government, and promise to be faithful to Greece in its emergency. But the conduct of Cleomenes did not deserve the name of patriotism, fur he was guilty of the greatest barbarity towards some of those who had been terrified into sending earth and water to the king of Persia, and among other acts of cruelty, set fire to a sacred grove at Argos, where a number of fugitives had taken refuge. At length he put an end to his own existence in a fit of madness, and it was the general belief that the gods, as a judgment for the destruction of the sacred grove, had deprived him of his intellect. ?In the mean time, the Persians had sailed with a large fleet, and having taken several Islands on their way, arrived *t Eub\u0153a, and laid siege to the city of Eretria, which held a Thirlwall. o Library of Useful Knowledge"], [72, "54 GREECE. out for six days, when it was captured and destroyed, while most of the unfortunate inhabitants were killed, and the rest made slaves.\" 8The Persians being now master of this im portant island, crossed over to Attica, and landed on the plain of Marathon, a level tract of land, five miles in length, and two in breadth; where they were soon met by the Athenians, and their allies the Plat\u00e6ans. A courier was sent off to Sparta to request assistance, who performed the journey on foot, in forty-eight hours, the distance being one-hundred and-fifty-miles; and this was nothing unusual in Greece, where couriers or runners were constantly employed between the states, and travelled with great swiftness.4 BThe Grecian army was headed by ten generals, who took the command in turn, each for one day ; and as the Persians were greatly superior in point of numbers, several of them were un willing to risk an engagement; and at length agreed to give the sole command to Miltiades, a man of great courage and military skill, who fought and won the celebrated battle of Marathon, B. C. 490. The account of this action is usually much exaggerated, but there is no doubt that the Greeks had to contend with a force more than double their own ; besides which, a large portion of their army was composed of slaves, who had been armed in haste for the emergency, and were promised their freedom in case of success.0 The victory, which reflected great glory on Miltiades, was cele brated at Athens with processions, sacrifices, and all kinds of rejoicings ; 10all the Athenians who had fallen, were buried under a stately sepulchre, with ten pillars, on which their names were inscribed according to their tribes ; and another tomb was consecrated to the remains of the Plat\u00e6 ans and slaves.1* The plain of Marathon is now bare and desolate.

Themistocles passed a decree that these rents should be employed in building twenty ships every year, and a committee was appointed to carry the design into execu tion, the money being placed in the hands of a treasurer, who, of course, was answerable for its proper application. This wise measure probably saved Greece from falling under the Persian dominion, as we shall presently find. The ships were triremes, which would carry about two hundred men each, and their speed is said to have been nearly equal to that of a modern steam boat. The prow was ornamented with painted figures, and beneath it was the rostrum or beak, pointed with iron to pierce the side of an enemy's vessel. Every ship was furnished with raised bulwarks of skins or wicker work, (which could be removed when neces- Wordswoth's Greece. F"], [74, "66 GREECE. sary,) to protect the men from the darts of the foe in battle. The rowers were generally slaves ; but the sailors were all freemen of the lower orders.\" 13Ten years after the battle of Marathon, Xerxes set out for Europe, with the largest army that had ever been seea in tnis part of the world, composed of the troops of many nations, all wearing the dress and carrying the arms of their several countries; besides whom, there were immense num bers of camp followers of all descriptions, both men and women, with long trains of baggage waggons to convey the supplies needful for the maintenance of such a host. The king himself rode in a state chariot, surrounded by the royal guard, and dined every day with as much pomp as if he had been in his own palace. 14To facilitate the progress of the army, a canal had been dug through the Isthmus that con nects the promontory of Mount Athos with the mainland ; and a bridge of boats had been constructed across the Hel lespont, a strait, or narrow part of the sea, running between Europe and Asia, from the sea of Marmora to the Archipe lago, and at that part about a mile in width. These works were performed by Ph\u0153nicians and Egyptians, but after the first bridge was completed, it was destroyed by a storm; at which the king was so enraged, that he ordered the heads of the chief engineers to be cut off.4 A new bridge was then formed of two lines of boats fastened together with strong cables, those of the Ph\u0153nicians being made of flax, and those of the Egyptians with the fibre of the papyrus. c The boats were held firm by anchors ; and over them were laid planks and earth, to form broad and smooth causeways, with a palisade on each side. The labourers employed in ttns vast work were not slaves, but tributary subjects of the Persian monarch, and as their labour was compulsory, thev o Fmith's ' Greek and Roman Antiquitiea.* e. small's ' Biojrraphy and Mytlioiaer.'

The land forces marched through Thrace, at that time subject to the Persian Empire, and every city had received orders to furnish one day's provisions for the army, a supply which the inhabitants had spent several months in prepar ing, and the cost of which was so enormous, that some of the towns were almost ruined by it.4 l6Athens and Sparta, with most of the other Grecian states, united to repel this formidable invasion ; but they did not remain faithful to the league, and thus gave a great advantage to the enemy. l6The people of Thessaly, who had long been famous as cavalry soldiers, at first joined the confederacy, on certain conditions; but as these were not strictly observed, they not only submitted to the Persians, as soon as they entered the province, but engaged in the service of Xerxes, and fought against Greece. c '^Thessaly was separated from the rest of Greece by lofty mountains, through which there was only one practicable pass, a narrow defile called the straits of Thermopyl\u00e6, between Mount Oeta and the sea, which it became necessary to guard, to prevent the Persians from passing through it, a task undertaken by Leonidas, one of the kings of Sparta. 18Several ineffectual attempts were made by the Persians to force their way, till, at length, Ephialtes, a Trachinian deserter, whose name became in famous, informed Xerxes of a path by which he might send a body of troops over the mountains to attack the Spartans on that side; while his main army advanced through the a Grote's ' History of Greece. .

Leonidas might have saved himself and his army, hv a timely retreat, but the rigid laws of Sparta ioroade such a course, although certain death awaited all who should abide the double attack of the enemy. With the stern resolution of a true Spartan, the king prepared for the approaching sacrifice. He dismissed a part of his army, keeping with him 'Sail the Spartans, about three hundred in number, with seven hundred soldiers of a very small state called Thespi\u00e6, and four hundred Thebans, who would gladly have departed, but were not permitted, there being some doubt as to their fidelity to the cause of Greece.\" This little army, which was about doubled by the attendant helots, was drawn in battle array against the mighty host of the Persian monarch. 20The Thebans watched their opportunitv to surrender in a body ; but the rest fought with all the courage of desperation, even after their com mander had fallen, till every one was slain. Leonidas had married Gorgo, the daughter of Cleomenes, who has been already mentioned : and it is said that when he was about to depart on this expedition, she asked him what was bis last wish, in case he should not return ; on which he replied, that he should wish her to marry a brave man.4 21 The Persians now advanced through Phocis, laying waste the country with fire and sword, and entered B\u0153otia, where they were received as friends. A detachment was sent against Delphi, with a view of plundering the temple , but the Delphians fought so valiantly in its defence, that the invaders were driven back with great loss, and the treasures saved. 22So many of the allies, however, had deserted, that the Athenians saw it would be in vain to attempt to defend Athens, towards which the enemy was rapidly approaching, they therefore resolved to abandon the city to its fate, and, assembling their ships, embarked with their families and a Library of Useful Knowledge. t> Smith's ' Biography and Mythology.* [Leonidss.)"], [77, "GREECE 69 moveable property for the islands of Salamis and \u00c6gina.

C. 480, over the Persians, destroying nearly all their ships; and this battle, known in history as the battle of Salamis, decided the fate of the war, and proved the wisdom of Themistocles in having provided a powerful navy in the manner above related. 24Xerxes having drawn up his army on the Attic shore to witness the engagement, was tilled with dismay at the destruction of his fleet; and, not liking the prospect of a protracfced war, without ships, he gave up the campaign, and returned to Asia, leaving Mardonius, his sister's husband, to carry on the campaign.

The walls of the new city of Athens were sixty stadia, or about seven miles in circumference, but were never filled with buildings, nor was it desirable they should be ; since it was eminently useful to have empty spaces within the walls, where, in case of invasion, people from the country might find a temporary place of safety for themselves and their property ; and this was the more needful, as the wealthiest of the citizens generally resided at their country houses, in their respective demes, and not in the city.\" \"Miltiades had, shortly after the battle of Marathon, committed some offence against the state, for which he was condemned to pay a fine of fifty talents, and in default of payment, was thrown into prison, where he died.

C. when he gained a memorable victory over the Persians, on the coast of Asia Minor, destroyed their fleet, routed their army, and carried off an immense booty. His popularity was very great as a commander, and he was de sirous of taking the lead at Athens, where, however, he had a rival, who contended with him successfully for public fa vour. sThere were two parties at Athens, the aristocratical, the leader of which was Cimon ; and the Democratical, headed by Pericles.\" Cimon was at this time very rich, and courted popular favour by employing his wealth in acts of munificence. 3 He opened his gardens and orchards to the public, admitted the members of his own deme to dine every day at his table, \u00bbnd when he went out, was usually attended by some of his people, with clothes and money, to distribute among the poor in the streets.4 4He spent vast sums in improving the newly built city by planting groves, building porticoes, and other public works which were of great benefit to the citi zens : and it was he who commenced the famous Temple of Theseus, a great part of which is still standing, having brought from Asia some bones, said to be those of that an cient hero, which were buried at Athens with great pomp. ' Cimon also laid the foundations of the Long Walls, to con nect the city of Athens with its two ports and harbours, according to a plan designed by Themistocles ; but Not withstanding all his great and good works, he was at length banished by Ostracism, which often happened when powerful men were opposed to each other in politics, and his rival Pe ricles was thus left in possession of the supreme power.- Ci mon is described as a tall handsome man, with remarkably a Thirlwall. b Thirlvrall. e Smith's ' Biography and Mythology,' (CimonJ \u00ab\u25a0 ThuiwpU."], [81, ".REECE. 73 thick hair, which he wore long and curled. He was lively, frank, and courteous in his manners, of a cheerful temper, and gentle disposition, united with extreme liberality and true patriotic feelings. 6The Persian wars were the indirect means of increasing the wealth and power of Athens in no small degree ; for the Greek cities of Asia, when released by Cimon from the Persian dominion, had agreed to place themselves under the authority of the Athenian government, and pay a tribute toward carrying on the war; while many of the small states of Greece, from being allies, became subjects of Athens, on account of having neglected to abide by the terms of their alliance, which bound them to furnish aid against all the places in European Greece that still held out for the Persian king. This neglect furnished a pretext for a series of petty wars in which the Athenians were always successful, and the conquered people obliged to own their supremacy and pay them tribute ; so that, in the course of a few years, the empire of Athens was extended over most of the Islands of the \u00c6gean sea, or Archipelago, and the Grecian cities in Thrace and Macedonia.\" The rising greatness of Athens occasioned much jealousy at Sparta, and already there had been open warfare between these two rival states, which had however been ended by a truce for five years, in the course of which, Cimon, who had been recalled, died; but before the term was expired, a new war broke out under the following circumstances. The in habitants of Delphi had always been the superintendants of the temple and the guardians of its sacred treasures. The priesthood, too, had from time immemorial, been hereditarv in tae most noble families of Delphi; but as Delphi was a city of Phocis, the Phocians now claimed a right to share in ail ;hese privileges, and were supported by the Athenians. a Liorary of Useful Knowledge ."], [82, "74 GREECE. while the Spart.ns came forward to protect the Delphians, aud restored the temple to their keeping ; in return for which, the Delphians granted them the right of precedency in consulting the Oracle, an honour so highly esteemed, that the Spartans caused an inscription to be engraved on a stone pillar, recording this grant. But no sooner had they with drawn their forces, than an Athenian army arrived at Delphi. under the command of Pericles, and re-instated the Phocians, who gave the aforesaid honour to the Athenians, and they recorded it on the same pillar that bore the Spartan inscrip tion. Other causes combined to increase the enmity of the rival states, and an irregular war was carried on for three years longer, in which several of the other states joined as allies of one party or the other, till at length the Athenians were glad to purchase peace by making some concessions, and 8a truce was concluded for thirty years, B. C. 445.\" 'This interval of repose was chiefly remarkable for the ad ministration of Pericles, one of the greatest men of the age and equally celebrated for his extraordinary talents as a statesman, his cultivated mind, and the magnificent works with which he adorned the city of Athens. His fortune was not large, therefore all his improvements were made at the public expense, and in order to reconcile the people to this vast expenditure, he took care to provide the poorer citizens with the means of subsistence and amusement also from the same source.4 10He increased the number of festivals, and procured a law to be passed that all who could not afford to pay for admission to the theatres, should be furnished with the money from the treasury, and a fund was established tor that purpose called the Theoricum.c The theatres at Athens were open all day, and were not covered buildings like ours, out consisted of a large area enclosed with a wail, capaoie a Thirlwall. b Smith's 'Biography and Mythology,' (Pn^iclexx. c Thirlwall."], [83, "GREECE. 75 of containing many thousand persons. The price of admis sion was two oboli,\" an obol being equal in value to one pennt\u00bb of our money.4 and this when given to such numbers of people every day, amounted to a large sum. \"Another regulation by which Pericles increased his popularity was that the jurors in the law courts should be paid for their attendance, and as there were six hundred in each of the ten courts, this pay helped to maintain six thousand people. The business of these courts was greatly increased by a new law, that all the allied, or rather subject states, should send their causes to be tried in the Athenian courts, a great ad vantage to Athens by the increase of fees, and the immense number of strangers that came to the city during the ses sions. e 12Pericles raised the contributions levied on the allied states from four hundred and sixty to six hundred talents, \u25a0 for when expenses were increased, the supplies must also be increased, to meet them, and thus the people who had fallea under the authority of Athens were heavily taxed to support the grandeur of the sovereign city. The great ruler, how ever, made a provision for numbers of the poorer classes, by founding several colonies out of Greece, and making grants of land to such as chose to go and settle there, and it is sup posed that one of these Greek colonies was Neapolis. now Naples.' A regular city called Thurii, was built by commis sioners from Athens, near the side of the ancient Sybaris, in Calabria ; and among those who went to reside there, was Herodotus the great historian/ who was living at this time. 13The increased tribute was employed chiefly in beautifying the city with these superb edifices, and other works of art, whose remains are still beheld with wonder and admiration. a Smith's 'Biography and Mythology.' b Smith's ' Greek and Roman Antiquities.* c Thirlwall. d Thirlwall. e Thirlwall.

One of the most splendid of these was the Parthenon, which stood witftiii the walls of the Acropolis, in the centre of Athens. It was a grand temple dedicated to Athene, and adorned with some of the finest sculpture in the world, executed by !4the cele brated artist Phidias, who was engaged in all the great works ot Pericles; and some of the statuary of the Parthenon, but in a very mutilated state, is now in the British Museum, under the name of the Elgin Marbles.\" But the chief or nament of the temple was a colossal statue of the goddess, nearly forty feet high, made of ivory and gold; that is, ai. the parts of the figure that were seen were formed win. plates of ivory laid over the wooden image ; and all tne drapery was of solid gold. The cost must have been im mense, but the materials were the choice of the people, to whom the question was referred in the general assembly, whether the statue should be of white marble, or of ivory and gold, and they decided for the latter.4 \"The assembly of the people was held in an open space, called the Pnyx, adjoining the agora, or great market place of Athens, which resembled the forum of Rome; and around it were the courts of law, and council-hall of the five-hun dred senators.

These works afforded ample employment for every artizan in the city, and shew that all trades connected with building were in active operation at Athens, such as carpenters, smiths, stone masons, carvers, gilders, and many others ; but it was the master mechanics who were chiefly benefitted, the great proportion of the labourers being slaves belonging to them,4 so that there was but little occupation for the citizens of the lower orders in time of peace, and hence they had so much time to spend in idle amusements. c The peace had lasted nearly fourteen years, when new causes of disagreement arose between the Athenians and Spartans, which led to a renewal of hostilities ; but before entering on the melancholy details of the great war which followed, let us pause to contemplate the more pleasing pic ture of the state of society in Greece at this flourishing and enlightened period. a Wordsworth's Grttce.

MANNERS OF THE GREEKS IN THE TIME OF PERICLES. In speaking of the manners and customs ol any country, we naturally look first to its chief city, where people in all ranks of life are to be found ; and as Athens was at all times the greatest of the cities of Greece, it is usual, on speaking of the Greeks generally, to take it as a centre point. 'It had been rebuilt, as already stated, since the Persian wars, in a style consonant with its growing power and ambition, the private houses being more commodious, and the public buildings more splendid. The temples were surrounded bv stone porticoes, in which the people might walk and con verse without being incommoded by the sun, and in different parts of the city, there were colonnades, furnished with benches, and adorned with fine paintings and sculpture. These were the public promenades, and the places whera celeorated philosophers delivered their discourses. The houses were built of stone, brick, aud liaiijer"], [87, "GREECE. 79 naving their principal rooms on the ground floor, for the upper story extended only over a part of the house, and was used as a sleeping place for the slaves, the rest being covered with a flat roof. The stairs were on the outside. There were always two sets of apartments, one for the male, the other for the female part of the family, for they did not mix together unless the master of the bouse happened to be quite alone, when he would probably dine in his wife's apart ments; but she never went out with him, nor did she appear if he had visitors. The street door, in large houses, opened to a narrow passage, which led to the peristyle of the men's rpartments, an open court, surrounded by porticoes, in the middle of which was usually the altar for the family worship and sacrifices ; and around it were the rooms kept exclusively to themselves, by the gentlemen, such as a banqueting hall, or as we should say, a dining room, library, picture gallery, sitting rooms, and sleeping apartments. A door opposite the entrance opened into another peristyle leading to the apart ments of the ladies, consisting of eating rooms, sleeping rooms, and large work rooms, where a number of female slaves were constantly employed in spinning and weaving, under the superintendence of the mistress of the family. There were no doors to the rooms, but the entrance was closed by curtains, which were sometimes richly embroidered. This it will be understood applied only to the houses of the wealthy; but the same style of building was very general in most parts of Greece, the dwellings of those in moderate circumstances having, of course, fewer apartments, and plain er decorations. 3lt is not known whether the Greeks had fire places or chimneys, the rooms being usually warmed by portable stoves, heated with charcoal. Most of the rich titizens of Athens had magnificent country houses with beautiful pleasure grounds attached to them, usually em bellished with fine statuary and other works of art. Tin. tioois of the principal rooms were stone mosaics , tmd the"], [88, "80 GREECE. ceilings, at this period, were white; but a little later, the walls and ceilings were generally painted. There were a great many lodging houses at Athens, let chiefly to foreign ers, who came to the city on business, or to merchants who resided out of town, but required counting houses within the walls of the citv; and much money was made by letting apartments during the festivals and the sessions ; so that many people invested their capital in the purch_.se or build ing of houses for that purpose, which often proved a very profitable speculation. The number of aliens residing in Athens was greater than in any other citv in Greece. 4They were for the most part, Greeks from other states, subject to certain restrictions; for instance, they were not allowed to purchase houses or land, and each was obliged to name some citizen for his patron, through whose mediation all his business was transacted. the patron of course claiming some share of the profits. Each family had also to pay a tax of twelve drachmae a year to the state; to serve, like the citizens, as soldiers and sailors, and to perform certain services at the festivals, such as carrying the vessels, and other things used in the sacrifices, and if they neglected any of these duties, they forfeited the protection of the state, and might be sold for slaves.\" The Greeks were fond of pleasure, and those wno could afford it lived in a luxurious style. 5Their dining rooms were fur nished with sets of couches, on which they reclined during meals as the Romans did at their suppers; a custom general at this period, although it is uncertain when it was first in troduced, nor was it ever adopted by the ladies in Greece The Athenians were fond of dining in company, so that dinner parties were frequently given by those who could afWd it. and birth-days were usually celebrated in t.nit manner. \"Un occasions of ceremony, slaves were always in \u2022 Smith's ' Greek and Roman Antiquities.'"], [89, "GREECE. 81 attendance to take the shoes and bathe the feet of the guesti as they arrived ; and when these had taken their places on the couches, water was brought to wash their hands ; and a small table was then placed before each couch, which was not covered with a cloth, but wiped with a wet sponge. A Greek dinner was not so sumptuous as a Roman supper, the dishes being plainer, and fewer ; nevertheless the art of cookery was much studied m Greece, and there were many professed cooks who were hired for entertainments. The Sicilian cooks were in higher esteem than any others. ?The dinner usually consisted of fish, soup, game, poultry, and confectionary; and when it was ended, the tables were taken away and water again brought for the guests to wash their hands, a very needful ceremony, as they did not use knives and forks, but ate with their fingers. Perfumes were then handed round, and a crown of flowers presented to each person, which he placed on his head. Then came the grace cup, a large goblet filled with wine, from which a little was first poured as a libation to the gods, and then it was handed to each guest in turn, who put his lips to it, and this cere mony being finished, a hymn was sung to a flute accom paniment. After this came the dessert, and wine, which was always mixed with water, (usually iced,) and the evening was spent in drinking, dancing, music, and va rious games. The Greeks drank healths and toasts, as was the custom with us some years ago ; and 8wine was so cheap at Athens, that people of very limited means, who could not afford to give dinners, would often invite their friends to a symposium or drinking party. 9At these parties also, it was usual for the visitors to recline on couches and wear garlands of flowers, and female dancers and singers were often engaged to enliven such entertain ments ; for there were bands of Greek girls whose profes sion was to dance, sing, and play on the flute, lyre, ani> a"], [90, "GREECE 82 other musical instruments. A master of the ceremonies was generally chosen to regulate the amusements of the evening, and every body was obliged to drink as much r_s was ordered by him, by the celebrated rule, (whose point cannot be expressed in English,) ' Drink, or be gone,'* sa these convivial parties sometimes became rather noisy and riotous. The visitors used however to play at a great many very amusing games, some of which required considerable dexterity ; for instance, a certain quantity of wine being poured into a goblet, would be given to one of the young unmarried men, who was required to throw the wine into a basin placed at some distance, so as not to spill a single drop of it, and in throwing it to pronounce the name of the lady he wished to marry. If the wine went into the basin, and none was spilt, it was considered a sign that he would succeed in his lovesuit; but if any fell to the ground, that he would be an unsuccessful wooer. This game was called cattobos, and was sometimes played by two or three in this manner. The basin was filled with water, with several little empty bowls swimming on the top of it, and he who succeeded in throwing the wine into one of the bowls and sinking it, won a prize of cakes or sweatmeats. Another favourite amusement was asking riddles, when those who \u2022messed truly, received a garland, or sweetmeats ; and those who failed, were obliged to drink a cup of wine and salt water, which excited great mirth at his expense. There were also games like draughts and backgammon, and a variety of other amusements.\" Pie-nic parties were very frequent among the young men, who would meet for the purpose of dining together, every jre bringing his share of the provisions ; or they wouia .ach contribute a certain sum of money which was en- * rx xt07, r/ cnriSi. * Sjnith'_ ' Ciieek and Roman Antiquitl^iT"], [91, "GREECE. 83 trusted to one as caterer to provide the entertainment. The Athenians were in the habit of going to market them selves, not sending their slaves, as the Romans used to do ; for at Athens, as at Rome, there were no shops for provi sions of any kind, but every thing was sold in the markets. 10The best bread, was made like ours, of wheaten flour; but the inferior sort, which constituted the principal food of the lower classes, was of barley; and was always sold by women, the bread venders being noted for making very free use of their tongues. Pork was the principal meat eaten by the Greeks, and was often made into sausages ; but they con sumed a great deal of fish, both fresh and salted ; and vegetables, such as beans, cabbages, lettuces, and mallows, were common at most tables. \"Salt fish was sent from Byzantium, (now Constan inople,) to all parts of Greece, and it was this branch of trade which first raised that citv to importance, for of all seas, the Euxine, or Black sea, was most prolific in fish. There were inspectors of the markets, whose duty it was to see that no frauds were practised, and Jliat bread was of the proper weight ; but in spite of their vigilance the market people were not always very honest in their dealings. 12The Greeks usually took three meals in a day. Their breakfast was in general bread dipped in wine; the luncheon a slight repast after the sitting of the courts; and the dinner about sunset. 13The use of earthenware for plates, dishes, and drinking cups was almost universal, although some of the wealthiest people displayed gold, silver, and bronze ; but it was not till the time of Alexander the Great, that plate and bronze became general at the tables of the upper classes. 14There were a great many potters at Athens, who lived in a particular quarter of the city, and had abundant occupation, the Athenian ware being reckoned the finc-^t made in Greece : the best being generally coloured wild"], [92, "84 oREECE black varnish ; but most of the earthenware was either red, white, or of a cream colour. 15The manufacture of sheets, blankets, and cloth of various kinds, was carried on exten sively at Athens ; and there was a regular cloth market in the city; but, as I said before, the workmen were principally slaves. l6In all the commercial cities of Greece, thousands of slaves were employed as artizans and manufacturers of aD kinds, some of whom worked on their own account, paying their masters so much a day, while others were let out on hire to persons wanting labourers, or to the state. '''When slaves were sold by auction, those who understood any par ticular art fetched a higher price than others; and the father of Demosthenes, the orator, who had thirty sword cutlers, and twenty coachmakers in his establishment, looked upon them as very valuable property. I8There was a class of slaves at Athens who held a higher rank, and enjoyed greater privileges than the others ; having been purchased when children by the state, and educated for the purpose of filling certain government offices, such as heralds, clerks in the law courts, street police, and many other subordinate situations. I9A11 the domestic servants, whether belonging to rich or poor people, were slaves; and in great houses the men were under the control of a steward; the females, of a stewardess. They were more often bought than born in a family, and it was customary, when a new slave entered the house, to scatter sweetmeats on the ground. It was not unusual at Athens for a master to allow a slave to pur chase his freedom, in which case, the freedman had to pay the same tax to the state that the master would have paid for him if he had remained in slavery ; so that the govern ment lost nothing by the change. 20The office of tutor in a Grecian family was always given to the cleverest and most trustworthy of the slaves, who was called p\u00e6degogus, from whence is derived our word pedagogue, meaning a school-"], [93, "GREECE. 85 Taaster. 21But the duty of the Greek pedagogue was not so much to instruct the boys entrusted to his care, as to watch over their conduct, and keep them from associating with improper companions ; and with that view, he always, as the name implies, went out with them, and attended them to the public schools, where they were taught grammar, music, and gymnastics, by professors of those accomplishments. 22Pericles was a liberal patron of literature, especially of the drama, as well as the fine arts ; and among the great writers who flourished in his time, were Sophocles and \u00c6schylus, the celebrated dramatic authors. 23Acting was not at this period a regular profession ; but the poets who wrote clays, often performed parts themselves, and some times distinguished orators would appear on the stage, so that it was not thought any degradation to act in a play ; though at a later period there were regular actors who were paid for their performances. It has already been observed that the performance of plays originated in the festivals of Bacchus. At first, only one character appeared on the stage, with the chorus, and told a story in heroic verse; but about the time of which I am now speaking, dialogues were written for two actors, and afterwards for three. The female cha racters were always performed by young men. These re presentations were of the serious kind, called tragedy ; but in the time of Pericles, comic actors began to appear on the stage, who diverted their audience by burlesque perform ances, in which they did not scruple to personate the great men of the age, and turn even Pericles himself into ridicule. Comedy was, in fact, a satire on the manners of the times, and took its rise from a species of revels indulged in at the bacchanalian feasts, called Comus. \"The Comus was a frolic band chiefly of young men, who went about in disguise, and wearing masks, from village to village, dancing and singing in a riotous manner ; and asi"], [94, "86 GREECE tragedy was at first accompanied on the stage by a chorus, so comedy was accompanied by a comus, till the time of Alexander the Great, when regular comedies were written and acted in a similar manner to ours, the comus being then left out. Women did not go to the theatres, but notwith standing the seclusion in which they usually lived, and the little attention paid to the cultivation of their minds, there were many ladies of the higher classes who were highly educated and accomplished, so that sometimes there were female competitors for the prizes in the contests of the poets at the festivals. \"Pericles married a lady named Aspasia, who was remarkable for her superior mental ac quirements, which gained his admiration so entirely that he separated from his first wife with whom he had lived very unhappily, that he might be at liberty to marry her ; and her house became the resort of the greatest philosophers and literary men of the age ; and also of many ladies of rank, who went with their husbands for the pleasure and improvement that was to be found in the society of Aspasia.\" a Smith's ' Biography aad Mythology,' (Aspasia., QUESTIONS. 1 What improvements had been made at Athens since! iht Persian wars ? 2 Describe the houses of this period. 3 How were the rooms usually warmed ? 4 What restrictions and duties were imposed on wtenr, rt Athens ? 5 How was a Greek dining room furnished ? 6 How were the guests received ? , Describe the customs of a Greek dinner 8 What was a symposium ?"], [95, "GREECE. 87 \u00ab.

The true cause of the War that spread misery and desola tion throughout the most beautiful country in the world, was the jealousy of the Spartans at the increasing power \u25a0Mid prosperity of the Athenians, whom they had always viewed in the light of rivals. They were, therefore, not unwilling to find a pretext for breaking the thirty years truce ; and having consulted the Oracle at Delphi, and received an answer favourable to their wishes, they declared war on the following occasion. 'Among the many cities subject to Athens, was thst ot Plat\u00e6a, in B\u0153otia, where most of the inhabitants were we'J contented with the Athenian government; but, as is g\u00ab*>\""], [96, "88 GREECE. allv the case, there was a party opposed to it, and a con spiracy was formed with a view to throw off the authoritv of Athens, and enter into an alliance with Thebes, which was now rising into a powerful state. 2The Thebans being willing to assist the enterprise, two of their Bceotarchs, or military commanders, led a band of soldiers, one night, into the city of Plat\u00e6a, the gates of which had been purposely left open, and proceeded to the market place, where they were joined by the conspirators, who raised a cry of \" Liberty !\" expecting that numbers ot' the people would side with them ; instead of which, the citizens assembled in arms, barred the gates, that none might escape, and attacked the Theban intruders, many of whom were killed in the streets, and the rest made pri soners. 3The Spartans, at this time, were in close alliance with Thebes, and any injury done to that state would give offence to them ; the Athenian rulers, therefore, sent mes sengers to Plat\u00e6a, to desire that no harm might be done to the Theban prisoners: but, unfortunately, they had all been put to death before the message arrived, and on that account the Spartans declared war in the year B. C. 431.\" A war between Athens and Sparta included almost all the Grecian states, some being subject to, others in alliance with, one or other of the great rival powers. *The cause of the Spartans was, however, the most popular, since they professed that their motive was to uphold the liberty ot Greece, by preventing the Athenians from gaining dominion over the whole country ; though there can be no doubt that their real object was to establish their own ascendancy. 6 An immense army, from the Peloponnesus, entered Attica, under the command of Archidamus, one of the kings of JSparta. \"Pericles, who still retained the supreme authority at ttbens, was of opinion that a pitched battle at this juncture c Thi._v.s_U."], [97, "GREECE. 89 might prove fatal to the Athenian cause ; he, therefore. decreed that all the citizens residing out of town, shoula bring their moveable property and families into the city, instead of fighting to defend them from the invaders, a command that was obeyed with great reluctance, many having spent large sums in repairing and beautifying their country houses since the Persian wars, and being extremely unwilling to abandon them to the ravages of a merciless enemy. However, there was no alternative. \"Elegant villas were dismantled, farm houses pulled down, the fields left untilled, the cattle sent to the neighbouring islands, and the whole country population removed to Athens, taking with them their portable goods of every description.' 8The city was thus silled with a multitude far greater than the houses would contain. Some were lodged in the tem ples, and towers of the walls, while temporary buildings were hastily erected on every vacant spot, to afford shelter to as many as could crowd within them. But these inconveniences were not the worst of the evils arising from the approaching war, for many people were reduced from affluence to poverty, in consequence of receiv ing no income from their estates, so that the actual distress was very great.6 Still all busied themselves in preparing for the war, and in a short time a large fleet was ready for action, for the Athenians trusted more to their navy than to their land force. \u00bbin the meantime, Archidamus advanced with his army, laying waste the fertile plains in his way, till he came within six miles of A. hens. The general wish that pre vailed in the city, was to give battle ; but Pericles was firm in opposing so dangerous a measure, and contented himself witn sending out detachments of cavalry, to cut off the tragghng parties that left the enemy's camp in search *\u25a0* plunder ; so that there was constant skirmishing and a TivirlwiUl. b Library of Useful linowlecisre."], [98, "GREECE. 90 bloodshed, although no regular engagement took place. The winter put an end to the compaign, and the invaders, having ravaged the country from one end to the other, re turned home. \"An ancient and affecting custom was observed at Athens on this occasion. The remains of those who had fallen, were collected under a pavilion, raised for the pur pose, and visited by their friends ; after which they were deposited in ten coffins, one for each tribe, and carried in procession, on cars, to the place of interment, a vacant bier following, in honour of those whose bodies had not been found. All the relatives, both men and women, walked first in the procession, as mourners, most of the principal citizens following, and Pericles himself delivered a funeral oration. The sons of the deceased were to be maintained at the expense of the state until they should come of age, when each was to be presented with a suit of armour.a The next year the Peloponnesians again invaded Attica, when a new and terrible calamity fell upon Athens, where 12 the plague broke out with frightful violence, increased, no doubt, by the crowded state of the city. I shall not dwell on the horrors attending this fatal scourge. Those who have read an account of the plague in London, in the time of Charles the Second, may form an idea of what it must have been at Athens, at such a time as this, when every corner of the city was so crowded witb people. The disease appeared also in other parts of Attica, and the Athenians, in the midst of their distress, sent pro posals of peace to the Spartans, which were, however, rejected, and the war went on. Whilst the army of Achidamus was destroying the crops, wasting the lands, and spreading desolation throughout Attica, the Athenian fleet had not been idle, and the same rhiriwiU."], [99, "GREECE. 91 destructive work was going on in the Peloponnesus, so tlwt the mischief done in Attica was fully retaliated. 13 The death of Pericles, in the third year of the war. deprived Athens of one of the greatest of her rulers, and was a serious calamity to the Athenians at this time, as there was no one with ability to supply his place. 14The war was spreading still farther over Greece, and was carried on with increasing ferocity, for the conquered on both sides were treated in the most barbarous manner, and the whole population of some of the towns massacred, or sold for slaves. Such was the fate of the inhabitants of Plat\u00e6a, which was besieged and taken by the Spartans, who put the garrison to the sword, sold the rest of the people into slavery, and pulled down all the houses, the materials of which were employed in building a temple, and a vast barrack, for the accommodation of pilgrims, on the site of the city. The Plat\u00e6an territory was annexed to the Theban state lands, and let out to Theban farmers for a term of ten years.\" 16 In cases of revolt, which were not unfrequent among the subject states of Athens, the revolted people were always barbarously dealt with, and in many instances the fortifications of their cities destroyed, their ships taken away, and their government broken up, so that many of the small Grecian communities were exterminated during these cruel wars.4 i7lt was seven vears before the plague disappeared from Athens, and when it had entirely ceased, 18the Athe nians testified their gratitude to the Gods by reviving an ancient festival in the Isle of Delos, on which occasion the Athenian general, Nicias, was appointed to lead the chorus that is, he had to take upon himself all the trouble and expense of providing a magnificent show, a band of musi cians and dancers, and of conducting a grand procession tv \u2022 Grutc's ' llistoiy of Greece.' * Thirlwall."], [100, "GREECE. 92 the festival. These processions were looked upon as em bassies from the state, and it was usual to make them as splendid as possible, so that the leader, or ambassador, would sometimes spend, on such occasions, an enormous sum of money, which it would have been thought discredit able in him to refuse.\" Nicias gained great applause for the manner in which he performed his mission, for instead of landing his chorus at Delos, he disembarked on a little island opposite, and threw across the channel a bridge, which had been prepared before he left Athens, and was gaily decorated with gilding and tapestry.* The procession marched over it in grand arrav, and proceeded to the temple, with hymns and dances, as was the custom on such occasions, when it was usual for the leader to ride in a state chariot, with a crown of gold upon his head, followed by a numerous train of attendants.0 The games were celebrated as usual, crowds of spectators being assembled as at a fair ; and when thev were ended, Nicias presented to the temple, as an offering to Apollo, a brazen palm-tree ; and bought a piece of ground, the profits of which were to be devoted to feasts and sacrifices, on condition that the priests should supplicate the Gods in favour of the founder.'' I8The war was continued four years longer, and was carried on chiefly in Sicily, where there were many Greek cities, some of which sided with the Spartans, others with the Athenians ; but at length both parties became desirous of tasting the blessing of repose, and 20in the year 421, B.

ALCIBIADES. At the time when Nicias concluded his treaty with the"], [102, "GREECE. 94 Spartans, one of the most remarkable men in Greece was Alcibiades, an Athenian of noble birth, distinguished by his immense fortune, his ambition, undaunted spirit, and extreme personal beauty. When a boy, he was at the head of his companions in every during exploit, without paying much regard to prudence or justice, and, unfortunately, his rank and fortune surrounded him with flatterers, always ready to admire every thing he said or did, whether right or wrong. He had come into possession of his vast in heritance in the time of Pericles, to whom he was nearly related, and was now about thirty years of age, and one of the leading men in the government of Athens. 2The celebrated philosopher, Socrates, who was his inti mate friend, took a great deal of pains to correct his faults ; and if the youth had paid more attention to the advice of that excellent monitor, he might have become as great a man as Pericles ; but, although he had a profound respect for his instructor, and acknowledged the wisdom and good ness of his counsels, he suffered himself to be influenced by those who, for their own interest, flattered and encouraged his vanity, his ambition, and love of pleasure ; so that, at length he grew tired of the admonitions of Socrates, and shunned his society. Alcibiades was the leader of fashion, at Athens, so that the most fashionable shoes were called by his name, as we have Wellington boots ; and the young men of rank imitated a style adopted by him, of wearing the pallium with very long ends hanging down behind, to form a train. \u00bb s He married the daughter of one of the richest men in Greece, an affiance that increased his already extensive wealth and influence : and gained great fame by winning three chariot races at the Olympic games, on which occa sion he gave a public feast to the spectators. Like Cimon and Pericles, he spent a great deal of money \u25a0 Smith's ' Greek and Roman Antiquities.'"], [103, "GRELCB 95 on the public festivals, but it was rather to gratify his own pride and vanity, than with a view of courting the favour of the people, that he made so profuse a display of his riches. 4 Still he was extremely popular, and his daring spirit prompted him to make the v/orst possible use of his popularity, by doing things in opposition to the law, and setting the customs of society totally at defiance, as if he took a pride in showing that he might do with impunity what would be punished in other men.\" 5 Alcibiades did not approve of the peace of Nicias, his rival, and did all in his power to pursuade the council to break it. In fact, the terms were not strictly adhered to by either party, but more especially by the Athenians, who on various pretences, attacked and gained possession of several cities that were in alliance with Sparta ; and, at length, in the sixth year of the peace, it was proposed, in the assembly, to send out an expedition to effect the con quest of Sicily, a step which the Spartans, as Dorians. and allied in blood with the chief cities of that isiana, could not fail to resent. \"Nicias was strongly opposed to a measure that involved a renewal of the wars that had already occasioned so mucn misery ; but Alcibiades, who only thought of gratifying m, own ambition in being appointed one of the chief com manders, made a long speech in the assembly, on the otner side of the question ; and the majority being in his favour, the preparations were commenced, and the general topic of conversation at Athens was the approaching war in Sicily. The oracle of Delphi, which was consulted, as a matter of course, on an affair of so much importance, returnee a most unfavourable answer ; but the Athenians were begin ning to lose their faith in the prophecies of that ancient institution, which had decidedly leaned towards the Spartan cjuse from the very commencement of the wars ; and it a Thirlwall."], [104, "96 GREECE. may here be remarked that, from this period, the pclitical influence of the Oracle gradually declined; and although it continued to be visited and consulted, even after Greece fell under the dominion of the Romans, it was chiefly by pri vate individuals, whose curiosity and superstition led them to seek the priestess of the Delphic god,\" just as many per sons, in more modern ages, have been tempted to seek information respecting their future destiny, from some astrologer or fortune-teller. 7It happened, just before the fleet was to set sail for Sicily, that some charges of a serious nature were brought against Alcibiades, who, like all popular men, had many enemies, and whose irregular conduct in numerous instances might justify a suspicion that he was concerned in lawless acts, of which he was probably entirely innocent.' It was an ancient and revered custom at Athens, to place a head of Hermes, or Mercury, on a stone pedestal, near the entrance of houses, temples, and public places, especially the gymnasia, or schools ; Hermes being regarded as the god of social intercourse among men, and the patron of gymnastic exercises ;c whence any injury done to these busts, was considered an act of sacrilege; and great, there fore, was the dismay of the people, one morning, to find all the heads broken and disfigured. Every exertion was used to discover the offenders; many persons were imprisoned on suspicion, and some executed. A charge was made against Alcibiades, who, at the same time, was accused by a slave, of making a sport of certain religious rites, or mysteries, and being guilty of other acts of impiety.1* He demanded an immediate trial, but as the Smith's ' Greek and Roman Antiquities. 6 I ibrary of Useful Knowledge. \u00ab Smith's * Biography and Mythology ' c Hermes. i riirlwaU."], [105, "GREECE. 97 fleet was ready to sail, * was determined that the investiua t.un of the affai\" shoul,. be deferred till his return.

Libations were poured from gold and silver vessels on board of every ship, and a hymn or prayer, for the safety of the fleet, as it sailed out of the harbour, was sung in chorus by the assembled multitude.'2 8But the expedition was not successful. Many cities, both in Italy and Sicily, that had been expected to lend their aid, not only refused to do so, but would not admit the Athenians within their walls, or allow them to buy provisions in their markets, so that they soon began to be distressed for supplies. 9 At length the rulers at Athens, finding that no progres* was being made in Sicily, sent out a state galley, to bring home Alcibiades to take his trial; and he was now acoused of plotting to overthrow the government ; and many of his friends were arrested on suspicion of being implicated in the supposed conspiracy. Some were executed, others thrown into prison, while many fled from the city ; and Alcibiades himself, knowing that death would be his fate, if he were once brought to trial, contrived to escape from the \"alley, and fled to Sparta, with the unworthy purpose of revenging himself, by giving aid and advice to the enemies of his country.* The sentence of death, however, was passed, and his property confiscated to the state; and, what was probably thought more terrible, the priests were or dered to denounce him as one forsaken by the Gods, which was done with certain ceremonies, according to an ancient custom, one of which was that the priests waved red banners while they pronounced the terrible anathema.\" a Thirlwall. b Smith's ' Biography and Mythology,' (A.cinbes.) c Thir.ir_JL H"], [106, "GREECE 98 '\"The Athenians, under the command of the generals, Nicias and Lamachus, subsequently met with better success in Sicily, and having gained a victory near Syracuse, 'laid & siege to that city. The Syracusan? sent envoys to Corinth and Sparta for aid, while the Athenians, who wanted reinforcements, despatched messengers to Athens, and also to Carthage ; for the Carthaginians were a rich and powerful people, and the Athenians hoped, by sending to ask their assistance, to prevent them from joining the opposite party,\" \"Alcibiades, who was always actuated more by passion than principle, used every argument in his power to induce the Spartans to send aid to Syracuse, and accordingly a Spartan general, named Gylippus, was ap pointed to take the command of a force hastily raised amongst the allies, and, in concert with the Corinthians, sailed to the relief of the besieged city. The besiegers, in the meanwhile, had received succours from Athens, and were carrying on their operations with such success, that the Syracusans were on the point of capitulating, when the timely arrival of Gylippus, with his army, changed the aspect of affairs, and saved the city from destruction. ,2In the meantime, the Spartans, by the advice of Alci biades, invaded Attica, and established a fortified post ut the town of Deceleia, on a steep eminence, about fifteen miles north-east of Athens, and there a strong garrison was stationed under the command of Agis, one of the kings of Sparta. This measure placed Athens almost in a state of siege, for the citizens had to keep watch night and day on the walls, while the enemy constantly sent out foraging parties for supplies, so that the provisions intended for the markets of the capital were carried off to the garrison of Deceleia, and food in consequence became scarce and dear, as nothing could be brought into the city except by sea.

The commanders, Nicias and Demosthenes, who were among the captives, were put to death ; and the rest, after enduring the most cruel treat ment for many months, during which numbers died of starvation, were sold for slaves in different parts of the island.6 Great was the consternation at Athens when the news of these disasters arrived. 14The state had never been in so prostrate a condition since the Persian Invasion , there was no money in the treasury, and few ships in the har bour ; but the Athenians were not a people to lament over misfortunes instead of trying to remedy them ; so they proceeded to build new ships, and resolved to spend no money on shows and festivals till better days should return. 15 It was customary, at Athens, in such an emergency, for the Prytanes to call a general assembly of the citizens, and explain to them the necessities of the state ; on which, ail patriotic individuals were expected to come forward with T-ullwaU. b Thirlwall."], [108, "100 GREECE. voluntary contributions of money, ships, or arms : and sup plies were thus raised for creating a new naval force.\" '\"About this time, Alcibiades having quarrelled with the Spartan king, Agis, went to the court of Tisaphernes, the Persian satrap or governor of Asia Minor, with whom he was soon on terms of the most intimate friendship, and as he was very desirous of returning to Athens, he sent pro posals to the effect that if the government would annul the sentence that had been passed against him, he would induce Tisaphernes to enter into an alliance with the Athenian state.6 \u25a07This proposal occasioned a violent debate in the conncil, many of the members being doubtful of his ability to establish an alliance between Athens and the Persian mo narchy ; but, after a long discussion, it was resolved that he should be recalled, on the conditions he had named; and envoys were sent to Sardis, to inform him of the decision of the council. Tisaphernes, however, declined the pro posed alliance, and Alcibiades remained in exile some time longer, when I3he was recalled, in consequence of a revolu tion at Athens, by which the democratical form of govern ment was changed, and the supreme power vested in a smaller number of people. A conspiracy had been formed for this purpose, by some of the principal men of the state, and four hundred persons were chosen, to form a council of limited power, that should supercede the councill of five Dundred. '9 The way in which the revolution was effected, was something like the manner in which Oliver Cromwell dissolved the long parliament ; for on the day fixed for the new parliament to meet, every member armed himself with a short sword, and the whole body proceeded to the Council Chamber, where the five hundred were sitting, ana nesired a IJbrary of Useful Knowledge. b ThlrlwaLL"], [109, "GREECE. 101 them to withdraw, which, being unarmed, they thought it wisest to do, and each, as he went out, received his pay, The four hundred then took their seats, and proceeded to elect their presidents. 20But the change was not popular, and an insurrection broke out, which ended in the new council being abolished, and the supreme power transferred to the assembly of the people. Several new regulations were, however, made, one of which was to do away with the pay of all civil officers, which made the poorer citizens content to be excluded from holding offices.\" The new constitution was very similar to that which existed before the time of Pericles, and the leaders of the opposite party withdrew from the city and went to the enemy at Decelea.* 21 These events took place in the year B.C. 411. 22 A decree was immediately passed in favour of Alcibiades. who was appointed to the command of a fleet, and carried on the war against the Laced\u00e6monians with such success that the sovereignty of Athens was restored in most of the revolted cities. After a succession of brilliant victories, the exile returned to his native home, and entered Athens with all the pomp of a naval triumph. The crowd greeted him with loud acclamations, garlands of flowers were thrown to him as he passed along, and he was escorted by a large party of his friends to the assembly house, where he was formally acquitted of all the charges that had caused his banishment. A golden crown was awarded him in re turn for his services, he was made commander-in-chief of all the forces by land and sea, and his confiscated property fully restored.0 23The first use he made of his authority was calculates to raise him to the highest degree of public favour.

It was a serious vexation to the Athenians to be deprived of any of their festivals ; but in this case the disappoint ment was the greater, it being one of the very few occa sions on which it was customary for women to join in the festivities ; and they used to proceed in small cars, from Athens to Eleusis, along a paved road, called the sacred way, of which some vestages are still remaining.\" Nothing could therefore have been more pleasing to the public than the offer made by Alcibiades, to conduct the procession under a military escort ; and thus guarded, it went and returned in perfect safety. 24 But this newly recovered popularity did not last long; soon alter this he lost several battles, which lowered him considerably in the public estimation, and he was deprived of the command. He then withdrew from Athens, and took up his abode on a lordship he possessed, on the shores of the Hellespont, where he lived for some years in his castle, and collected around him a band of mercenaries, with whom he made war on the neighbouring Thracian tribes, by which he greatly enriched himself;4 but, at length, he went into Asia, where he was assassinated, B.

DECLINE OF THE ATHENIAN STATE. (407 to 399, B. C.) The war between Athens and Sparta was conducted with as much barbarity as ever, the Laced\u00e6monians being still assisted by Cyrus, whose friendship was of the highest im portance, because the princes of Persia were very rich, and cuuld supply money to pay the soldiers and sailors ; the Greeks not then serving, as in ancient times, at their own expense, but being paid by the state which employed them. 1 The place of Alcibiades, at Athens, was supplied by Conon, a man of high rank and great ability, who took the com mand of the fleet, and in conjunction with nine other"], [112, "104 GREECE. generals, 2gained a great naval victory, which might have given the Athenians some advantage over their adversaries. but for their own cruelty and violence. The battle was fought near three small islands, called the Arginus\u00e6, off the oast of Asia, and the Laced\u00e6monian fleet almost entirely destroved ; but it happened during the engagement, that j-oine Athenian ships were disabled at such a distance from the shore, that the crews had no chance of saving them selves, but by clinging to the wrecks till the fight was over, and vessels could be sent to their assistance. Unfortunately, however, at the conclusion of the action a violent storm came on, which rendered it impossible to send out to the sufferers, who, in consequence, were all lost. 3It can scarcely be doubted that could any thing have been done to save the unhappy sailors, the generals would not have left them to perish ; yet they were tried by the council at Athens, and eight of the ten condemned to death for having neglected to take means for saving the lives of their countrymen. Six of them, who had returned, were executed, but the others escaped ; and thus the state lost eight of its best officers, at a time when their services were \u2022\"neb. needed ; and it is to be feared that the sentence was dictated not by justice, but by the enmity of a powerful faction,\" a case of no uncommon occurrence at Athens. 4The liberal aid of Cyrus soon enabled the Laced\u00e6monians to repair their shattered fleet, the command of which was ~;ven to a general of great ability, named Lysander, who sailed to the Hellespont, and took by storm the rich and populous city of Lampsacus, on the eastern side of the straits. 'Lampsacus was one of the Greek cities of Asia Minor, and was in alliance with the Athenians, who accordingly i_fcs.patched against Lysander a large armament, wh_s__5 \u00bb LiU-aiy of Useful Knowledge."], [113, "GREECE. 105 anchored very near the castle in which Alubiades was then residing. 6He observed the movements of both par ties with great interest, and seeing that Lysander was watching for a favourable opportunity of attacking the Athenians, went down the beach to advise the Athenian generals not to 'suffer their men to leave the ships. Thev contemptuously disregarded this caution, and permitted the sailors to go on shore in search of provisions, which thev continued to do for several days, and no evil results at first attended their imprudence. But they soon had reason to repent their neglect of Alcibiades' council ; for, one day, when very few were left on board, the Spartans suddenlv pushed across the the channel and captured almost all the ships, while a body of soldiers went in pursuit of the sailors who were dispersed in various directions, and being in small parties, were easily made prisoners.\" Conon escaped with eight galleys to the Isle of Cyprus, while Tysander followed up his advantage, and by a rapid succesion of victories, crushed the dominion of Athens in the Grecian towns on the coasts of Thrace and Asia Minor, as well as in most of the Islands that had owned its sovereignty, and at length laid siege to Athens itself both by land and sea. 8l'he city was not provided for along siege, and being thus surrounded by hostile forces, no provisions could be introduced. After holding out, therefore, for more than four months, the in creasing scarcity and dearness of food obliged the citizens to make the best terms they could with Sparta, and envoys were sent thither for that purpose. 9The Spartan govern ment demanded that the Long Walls and fortifications of Pir\u00e6us, should be demolished ; all the ships, except twelve, given up ; all Athenians who had been exiled for political offences, restored ; and that Athens should thenceforth ac knowledge the supremacy of Sparta. 10 These were hard u Thirlwall."], [114, "GREECE. conditions, but it was still harder to perish with hunger : the Athenians therefore accepted them; and thus, in the vear B.C. 404, ended the Peloponnesian war, which, in cluding the unsatisfactory peace of Nicias, had lasted for twenty seven years.\" Alcibiades did not choose to return with the exiles, but went to Asia, where he died by violence, as already related; but great numbers of men, who had been banished on t arious pretexts, came back rejoicing in the downfall of a govern ment from which they had suffered injjstice,6 although per haps if they had held power instead of their opponents, they would have given to others the same measure of justice which themselves had received. As goon as the treaty was concluded, Lysander began to pull down the walls and burn such vessels as were not worth carrying away. The exiles and numbers of foreigners, that is, people from the different states of Greece, looked on as if at a festival, most of them wearing garlands of flowers on their heads, while bands of music accompanied the work of destruction.0 Such a spec tacle must greatly have humbled the pride of the citizens of Athens; but still worse consequences attended the triumph of ''Lysander, who took upon himself to regulate the future government of the state, which he placed in the hands of a council, composed of thirty members, who, from their exces sive tyranny are usually called the Thirty Tyrants. Some of them were restored exiles, who took advantage of their present power to revenge themselves for the injuries they had formerly received ; and as they were supported by a guard of Spartan soldiers, they did not scruple to commit the greatest atrocities.

The unfortunate victims were the masters of a large manufactory for shields, in which they employed up wards of a hundred slaves. One was arrested as he was supping with some friends, and dragged from the table; but he contrived to make his escape, and fled from the city ; while the other, less fortunate, was put to death, the manu factory seized, and the slaves, with all the rest of the pro perty, sold by auction.0 A great many of the citizens, not feeling themselves safe at Athens, sought an asylum in Thebes and other places ; a step which must have involved many in ruin, as they could only preserve their lives at the sacrifice of their property which remained at Athens. 13Amongst these refugees was \u2022in Athenian general, named Thrasybulus, a man of bold ind enterprising spirit, who determined to make an effort to rescue his fellow citizens from their miserably-oppressed con dition, and with that laudable intent 'Collected a body of the exiles, and seized on a fortress on the frontiers of Attica, to which the refugees flocked in such numbers, that they soon a Thirlwall.

The patriots took possession of Pir\u00e6us, and gained a victory over the army which the tvrants had sent to stop their progress. '\"The news of this success was immediately followed by a revolt at Athens, when the council of Thirty was abolished, and a provisional government formed of Ten persons, who were expected to accommodate matters with Thrasybulus, who still held Pir\u00e6us ; but instead of doing so, they sent to Sparta for aid against him, and began to act with as much tyranny as the Thirty had done. 16Lysander was despatched with a Laced\u00e6monian army to compel the Athenians to submit to the government which he had forced upon them, but ''Pausanias, one of the Spar tan kings, fully sensible of the injustice of this measure, followed Lysander with another large force, made peace between the exiles and the citizens ; abolished the council of Ten ; and re-established the same form of government that had existed before the war. 18Traiiquillity was thus restored at Athens, but the Athenians never again rose to that height of prosperity which had formerly distinguished them above the states of Greece. In losing their sovereignty over the smaller states, they had lost the chief sources of their wealth; there was no further yearly tribute from them, to fill the treasury, and enrich the great; nor were the peo ple of other cities now obliged to bring their law suits to the Athenian courts for trial, so that Athens was no longer crowded, at the assizes, with strangers; the business of the lawyers was proportionally decreased ; the lodging houses, whiol used to bring such large profits to their proprietors, were unlet ; and the markets no longer thronged with customers, a loss no less to the government than the citi zens, on account of the dues paid on all goods sold there.

During four years the people of Olynthus defended themselves and their liber ties against the restless unprincipled invaders, who, in seve ral campaigns conducted by different generals, laid waste their country, and reduced them to the utmost distress by famine ; so that, in the end, they were forced to surrender on such terms as the Spartans chose to dictate, which were that they should be entirely subject to Sparta for the future, and their citadel garrisoned by Laced\u00e6monian soldiers.

He had saved the life of Pelopidas at the siege of Mantinea, a circumstance which had added to the warmth of their friendship, and Pelopidas would willingly have shared his fortune with one whom he regarded as a brother, but Epaminondas would never accept of pecuniary aid, as he did not choose that any should suspect him of cultivating the friendship of a rich man from interested motives. The poverty of Epaminondas, and the quiet way in which he lived, made it perfectly safe for him to remain at Thebes, where he watched all the proceeding?, and contrived to keep up a secret correspondence with the refugees at Athens, by which they were enabled to concert a plan to overthrow the tyrants, expel the Spartans, and recover their indepen cence.

They entered the city separately without attracting any notice, and met at the house of one Charon, who was in the plot, and had pre pared a hiding place for them till the moment for action should arrive. In the meantime Phyllidas, one of the con spirators, who held a high office in the city, had invited the chief leaders of the Spartan faction to a supper, and to ensure their coming, he told them he had prevailed on some ladies to promise they would join the company at the conclusion of the banquet. The plot, however, was very nearly dis covered, for an Athenian who was concerned in it, finding his courage fail as the time approached, sent an anonymous letter to the governor Archias, one of the guests of Phylli das, to warn him of his danger, and he received it at the table, the messenger saying it was on particular business. Being heated with wine, he threw the scroll carelessly aside saying, \" Let business wait till to-morrow,\" and soon after wards said he wished the ladies would come. The wish was scarcely spoken, when a large party in female attire entered the room, and drawing forth their concealed daggers, rushed upon the ill fated men, whose own wickedness led to their untimely end, and who, being totally unprepared for such an attack, were easily and speedily despatched. While this dreadful scene was acting at the house of Phyllidas, other bands of conspirators had broken into the shops of the armourers, and having supplied themselves with weapons. paraded the streets, proclaiming the fall of the tyrants, and calling on all good citizens to join in the cause of liberty, a cry that was heartily responded to, and on the following day \"Pelopidas and two other men of rank were placed at the head of the government, with the title of B\u0153otarchs, a term implying not only rulers of Thebes, but of all B\u0153otia ,2A body of Athenians soon arrived to help the Thebatti"], [129, "GREECE. 121 to regain possession of the citadel, which was surrendered on condition that the Spartans should be allowed to depart without injury, and this was agreed to ; but as they were marching out, some Thebans, who were among them and hoped to get away unperceived, were seized and executed as traitors to their country.\" 13Epaminondas took a part in the government, and, being one of the best soldiers of his time, was made chief commander of the army. 14The Spar tans now resolved to go to war for the recovery of their a* cendancy in Thebes, forgetting that they never had a right to that ascendancy, and that it was in direct opposition to the treaty they had agreed to at the peace of Antalcidas ,sThe war, however, was begun, and carried on for seven years, with that reckless cruelty which was but too charac teristic of Grecian warfare, when'6 a great battle was fought near the town of Leuctra, in B\u0153otia, between Epaminondas and the Spartan king Cleombrotus, who was then reigning conjointly with Agesilaus, and although the Thebans were far inferior in point of numbers they gained a complete victory. It is supposed that the Theban generals had used a little artifice to give confidence to the soldiers, that they might fight well ; for the sacred arms of Hercules, which were enshrined in a temple, dedicated to that hero, whose reputed birth-place was Thebes, had disappeared on the eve of the battle; and such was the superstition of the Greeks, that the majority of the soldiers firmly believed he would be present during the engagement ; a belief that, no doubt. contributed in great measure towards their success, as they fought with all the animation of men who were sure of victory.

Yet no battle was fought, each party, with all the barbarism of less enlightened nations, being more intent on despoiling the territories of the other, than on deciding their quarrel by a regular engagement. 2?The most important event that took place during this war, was the restoration of the Messenians to the land of their forefathers, which, it may be remembered, had been conquered bv the Spartans about three hundred years before, and its inhabitants either reduced to slavery, or driven into exile.

It is needless to enter into the details of these wars, in which most of the states took such a part as seemed likely to secure their own independence, while some of them were at war with each other on account of their private quarrels ; so that the country had never been in a more disturbed state than it was at this period. 30Within ten years from the battle of Leuctra, the Thebans lost their two great leaders, who both fell in the field, Pelopidas being killed in an engagement with one of the successors of Jason in Thessaly ; and Epaminondas at the battle of Mantinea, in Arcadia. 31The latter, al though a man of noble mind, and highly praised by the ancient historians, who speak of him as almost a perfect character, was not without many of the faults that were conspicuous in most of the leading men of the Greek states.

'Macedonia was a kingdom of considerable extent, north of Greece, and its political condition was much like that of England, France, and Germany in the feudal times, when the great nobles resided on their own lands among their vassals, each ruling his own lordship as a sovereign prince. a There were but few towns besides Pella, the capital, except the Greek colonies, which were the only trading cities in the country, and maintained a republican form of govern ment, but paid tribute to the king.4 The Macedonians were but little advanced in civilization they had no defined constitution, and it is doubtful whether they had, even as late as the period now in question, any written laws. A large proportion of the people were free, and from time immemorial had held popular assemblies, like the Franks and other German tribes ; but many of then privileges had gradually been transferred to the aimy, so that the government had become almost a military des potism, the king being the great military chief, and not dis tinguished from the other chiefs by any outward signs ot royalty, except on particular occasions.0 The throne hac often been an object of contention and bloodshed, till Philip, the youngest of the three sons of Amyntas II, al/out two years after the death of Epaminondas, took upon him self the office of regent for an infant nephew, whose father had been killed in a war with the Illyrians, a preda tory nation, (that is, a people who subsist by plunder,) on the western borders of Macedonia. 2Philip had spent the greater part of his boyhood at Thebes, having been brought away, it seems, from Macedonia by Pelopidas, on what account is uncertain, though most writers say he was taken a Library of Useful Knowledge. b Library of Useful Knowledge. c Thirlwall.

C. that Philip, setting aside the claims of his young nephew, became king of Maceaonia with the full consent of the people, who probably thought it better to have a sovereign who was already of an age to take the command, than one who had yet to be educated, and might never be so fit for it. Philip had, indeed, all the qualities of mind and person that were best calculated to gain unlimited influence over a semi-batbarous people. His countenance was noble, his appearance dignified and com manding, and 4he possessed talents of the highest order, united with great energy, clearness of judgment, and the most persuasive eloquence. To all this was added that crafty policy which formed so prominent a feature in the character of our king Henry the Seventh ; but he had also a great deal of careless good nature and pleasantry in his manners, that made him extremely popular.

The former was soon obliged to withdraw from the field, as Philip contrived by bribes and promises, to make a friend of the Thracian prince; but 'the Athenians had other motives for going to war, as the late king of Macedonia had entered into alliance with the im portant commercial city of Amphipolis, over which Athens formerly exercised a right of sovereignty, and it was with a view of recovering that right, as the price of their services that they took up the cause of Philip's rival.4 Philip im- a Thirlwall. b Smith's ' Biograpfcy and Mythology,' (PhilipputJ"], [140, "132 GREE E, mediately withdrew the Macedonian garrison from Amphi pulis, declaring the city independent, as he knew that the Amphipohtans would not readily submit to the authority of Athens, and it suited his own views to be at peace with that state. 8He defeated the Pretender Argceus in a battle, and took a number of prisoners, mostly Athenians, whom he treated with great courtesy, and released without ransom, on which they returned to Athens impressed with a high sense ,_f his magnanimity, and were soon followed by ambassadors from himself with proposals of peace, which were accepted.\" Before we proceed with the events that brought the whole of Greece under the dominion of the Macedonian king, it will be necessary to speak of the changes that had taken place in the state of society at Athens since the period when that subject was last alluded to. 9In former times, the citi zens were the soldiers of the state ; but the armies were now composed chiefly of mercenaries, that is, men of any country, who were soldiers by profession, and would engage in any service, for pay; while loa great portion of the lower orders of the citizens, instead of being employed as of old in the wars, lived in idleness on what was allowed them for attending as jurors in the courts of law, and on the largesses, that is, donations from the public treasury, there being a cer tain fund for the purpose of distributing these largesses among the poorer citizens, who went to receive them as the poor people here get a weekly allowance from their parish. \"The great evil consisted in the want of employment, as all branches of manufacturing industry continued to be carried in by slaves; therefore the practice of employing mercenary Soldiers, which had become general all over Greece, increased the number of poor in every city, and caused the seas to be infested with pirates and the country with robbers, for every a Smith's ' Biography and Mythology,* (Philippus.)"], [141, "GREECE. 133 army was now a band of freebooters, who, when not wanted for military service, lived by plunder.\" I2Formerly, too, the leading statesmen were expected to be great generals and conduct the wars, but this was no longer the case at Athens, where many of the senators at this period were not soldiers, and many of the generals were not senators.4 The leading men of the state were now ambitious of being distinguished as fine orators, and the study of oratory had become one of the most important branches of education. c I3There was also a new system in the navy, which had a bad effect ; the wealthy citizens, who were drawn for the Trierarchy, not being obliged, as formerly, to take the command of the ships to which they were appointed, but allowed to find substitutes ; and as they were still bound to pay all the expenses of a vessel for one year, they were in the habit of giving these hired captains a certain sum for that purpose, and frequently engaged with those who would do it at the lowest rate.\"* As the captain naturally desired to make as much profit as he could by his bargain, it is clear that the ships would not be so well equipped as when commanded by men of rank and wealth, whose pride and honour were alike concerned in performing the duties of a Trierarch (which has been already explained) in a manner calculated to do credit to himself as well as to the state. Thus, neither the army nor the navy was so powerful as it had been, and the Athenians themselves had lost much of their martial spirit, and were more given to idleness and luxury, with all their attendant vices.

HHe was anxious, in the first place, to improve the commerce of his country, which was very much impeded by the heavy duties that had to be paid on all goods exported or imported at the ports dependent on Athens ; for Philip had no maritime towns, and for that reason was very desirous of gaining possession of Amphipolis, not only on account of its convenient situa- tion for trade, but because its territory was partly covered with immense forests that afforded an inexhaustible supply of valuable timber for ship building.\" 15With this view he soon found a pretext for going to war with the Amphipo- litans; and in order to prevent the Athenians from opposing him, he artfully led them to believe that, in case he should take the city, he intended to restore it to them, as it was originally an Athenian colony, settled in the time of Pericles. The Athenians, who were about engaging in a war with some of the Islands that had just declared their independence of Athens, were content to trust to Philip's word; but that was by no means to be relied on ; for, having besieged and taken Amphipolis, he declared he had fairly won it, and meant to keep it; saying, in excuse for this breach of faith. that, as the city did not belong to the Athenians when he went to war with it, he was doing them no wrong.4 He behaved with clemency to the inhabitants, who sustained no farther injury after they had surrendered, and were allowed to retain their republican form of government; but the administration was placed in the hands of men favourable to the Macedonian interests, and the republic incorporated with the Macedonian state, to which it formed a valuable addition. l6Soon after this conquest, the people of Thessaly applied to him for aid against three tyrants who had usurped the sovereign power, and now governed in a most oppressive manner.

The quarrel originated in the following cir cumstances. 21There was a certain tract of land in Phocis, called the Cirrh\u00e6an plain, which for ages had been under cultivation, and was extremely valuable to the inhabitants, being almost the only fertile spot in the province, which was the most rugged and barren part of Greece.\" The Thebans, however, pretended to discover that this plain had, anciently, been consecrated to the Delphian god, and brought a charge of sacrilege against the Phocians for grow ing corn for their own use on sacred ground. The accusa tion was fonnded on an old tradition of doubtful origin, nor was there any proof that the land had ever been dedicated to Apollo, while it was of the utmost consequence to the Pho cians to keep it in its existing condition of cultivation, that they might not depend entirely on foreign supplies for subsistence ; yet the Amphictyonic council decreed that they should cease to cultivate the land in question, and pay a heavy fine for having so long profaned it by applying its produce to human purposes. 22The Phocians resisted the decree, and were supported by the Laced\u00e6monians, while the Thebans obtained assistance from Thessaly, and a war was commenced B.

C. 338. 22It is generally stated that Demosthenes, who fought in this battle, disgraced himself by a precipitate flight ; but this charge seems to have been unjustly brought against him by his personal enemies, for although he certainly fled from the field, it was with thousands of others, when the battle was lost.4 great proof of the falsehood of the accusation is, that he was appointed to pronounce the funeral oration of those who had fallen ; and the solemn feast that followed the sacrifices on the occasion, took place in his house. c Philip, it is necessary to add, had caused the bodies of the slain to be collected and buried, and sent the bones to Athens, for interment.

But these precautions were unneces sary, for 26 Philip behaved with unhoped for moderation to wards the Athenians ; he dismissed the prisoners, without ransom, and granted peace, leaving the city in possession of a nominal independence. 26The Thebans were treated in a different manner, being deprived entirely of their freedom, and compelled to give up their citadel, in which the con queror placed a Macedonian garrison. 2\"The establishment of his supremacy in Greece, was looked upon by Philip only as a preliminary step to a stil! higher object of ambition, which was no less than the conquest of the Persian empire; and with this view28 he held f. congress at Corinth, which was attended by deputies from all the Grecian states, except Sparta, where his power was still resisted.

The nuptials were to be celebrated with great splendour, in the ancient capital, \u00c6g\u00e6. Preparations were made for a grand festival, and the city was crowded with strangers, who came to witness the sight; while deputies arrived from the principal Grecian cities, bringing golden crowns, to present King Philip, on the occasion. The festivities were to last several days. On the first day, there was a grand banquet at the court, while the public were entertained with games and theatrical exhibitions. On the second day, the royal party went in grand procession to the theatre. The king was greeted with loud acclamations as he passed along, arrayed in a white robe, with a chaplet of flowers on his head,\" attended by Prince Alexander and the bridegroom.

SA story is told of his paying a visit, while at Corinth, to a very celebrated person, Diogenes, the phi- losopher, then living in that city, and who owed his noto- riety to his austere manners and self-denying life. 4He was the son of a banker, who resided at Sinope, a Greek city of Asia Minor ; but the father being detected in some dishonourable transaction, the son left his native place, and went to Athens, where he became a pupil of an eccentric teacher, named Antisthenes, who founded a sect of philo- sophers, called Cynics, and of these Diogenes was one. His philosophy seems to have consisted in a total neglect of all the usages of society, and in abstaining from every kind of pleasure or indulgence ; but there seems to be very little foundation for the story of his living in a tub, or even for the dialogue said to have taken place between him and Alexander, when, as we are told, the prince asked if he could do any thing to oblige him, to which the philosopher replied, \" Yes; jou can stand out of the sunshine.\" It is not improbable, however, that Alexander, who knew Diogenes by repute, might have seen and conversed with him at Corinth, where he lived in the capacity of tutor to the sons of a citizen, who had purchased him for a slave, is the island of Crete, under the following circumstances \u2014 Being on a voyage to \u00c6gina, the ship was captured by pirates, and all on board taken to Crete, to be sold for \u00abi\u00bbves.

The first battle was fought on the bank of the river Granicus, about thirty miles from the Asiatic shore of the Hellespont, where Alexander won a complete victory ; but he lost twenty nve of his royal guard, who were buried with great pomp, and brazen statues were erected in memory of them at Dium by the famous sculptor Lysippus, whose works of art were highly celebrated, especially 12a colossal statue of Zeus, or Jupiter, sixty feet high, and another of Hercules resting from his labours.

The natives of all the places he subdued were permitted to retain their own laws, but were obliged to pay tribute to the conqueror. ,4In the course of this first campaign, Alexander visited the ancient city of Gordium, formerly the capital of Phrygia, one of the monarchies conquered by Cyrus the Great ; and here occurred a well known incident, too popular to be omitted, although few are unacquainted with it. In the citadel was a waggon,0 to which the pole was fastened with a knot of bark so curiously tied that no one could undo it. or find the ends. The legend respecting it was, that at some very remote period, in a time of civil war, an Oracle had declared that peace would be restored when a waggon should bring a king to the city; and that, soon afterwards, a peasant named Midas, came to Gordium in the vehicle mentioned by the Oracle, and was elected king; on which he dedicated his waggon to the gods.

Alexander was resolved that the prophecy should apply to himself, and some of the ancient writers say that he cut it with his sword ; but Aristobulus, one of hi* generals, who was present, and who wrote his life, assert* that he undid it by drawing out the pin that fastened tlit yoke to the beam; an expedient which, probably, no one hai thought of before. However, he had the credit of untying the Gordian knot ; and no doubt there were many w!k believed that the conquest of Asia was owing to this achieve ment. In the meantime, Darius had assembled a vast army, ana was on his march, not in the soldier-like manner of the Macedonian king, who shared in the toils and hardships o. his troops, but surrounded with all the pomp and luxury of an eastern sovereign. His tent was a splendid pavilion, sur mounted by a golden image of the sun, one of the symbols, of the Persian religion. He rode in a state chariot, preceded by a number of Magians, or priests, before whom were borne silver altars, with the sacred fire burning on them, and these were followed by three hundred and sixty five youths of tht same orders, dressed in scarlet robes.\" The chariot was es corted by the royal guard, and followed by the carriages, in which were the king's mother, wife, and children, with their attendants; and next came the treasures, consisting of superb furniture for the royal tents, gold and silver, jewels, plate, spices, perfumes, and other valuables, carried by a long traij. of mules and camels. The satraps and other great officers also had brought their families, money, plate, jewels, and rich garments ; but most of the treasures, with the wives and children of the grandees, were sent to Damascus, for safety, the royal family alone remaining with the army. 15The two armies met near a town called Issus, from which the battle Thirlwall."], [164, "156 GREECE. takes its name, and there the Persians were defeated with im mense loss, Darius flying from the field on horseback, with a few friends, and leaving his family, and his splendid tents, with all their costly furniture, in the hands of the conqueror. l6The family of the Persian king, consisted of his mother Sisygambis, his wife Statira, said to be the most beautiful woman in the empire, two daughters, and a son only six years of age. Alexander sent a consolatory message to the unhappy princesses, assuring them that they should meet with as much respect and attention as if they were in theis own palace, and this promise was strictly fulfilled. '7The next object was to take possession of the treasures at Damascus, for which purpose a detachment of the army was sent under the command of Parmenion, the oldest and most distinguished of the Macedonian Generals. Damascus is one of the most ancient cities in the world, being men tioned in the history of Abraham,\" and it is still a large and handsome town, and a place of considerable trade. The governor offered no resistance, but opened the gates to Par menion, whose soldiers rushed in, eager for plunder, and in the confusion that ensued much of the treasure was wasted.* l8Alexander, meanwhile, had marched into the rich and popu lous country of Ph\u0153nicia, the conquest of which was of the highest importance to him, on account of its excellent ship ping.

But Alexander was not a man to be deterred by difficulties. He set his soldiers to work to cut down wood in the forests of Libanus, and to construct a causeway to pass over to the island ;4 and as his engineers proceeded with the mole, they set up wooden towers for protection against the enemy, who did all they could to in terrupt and destroy the works, in which they at length suc ceeded by means of fire ships,0 so that Alexander saw he should never accomplish his object without a naval force, which he procured in a short time from Rhodes, Cyprus, and some of the ports of Syria. A larger mole was then begun and finished, and, 22after a siege of seven months, the city was eventually taken by storm, notwithstanding a brave resistance of two days, for which the ill-fated Tyrians paid dearly, great numbers being slain in the terrible conflict, and the rest, t< the number of thirty thousand, sold into slavery. Tyre rose again to some degree of prosperity under the Roman Empire, but has undergone many changes of fortune, and is now a poor place with few inhabitants, and the island strewed with ruins in every direction. Thus fell the far famed city, of which it is said, \" Thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches, and of thy merchandise.\"-! Darius having twice made proposals of peace, which were rejected, he employed himself in preparations to take the field again, 23while Alexander led his army into Egypt, where he encountered no opposition, the Persian government not being popular, and the Egyptians very ready to accept a new ruler. a Bible Geography. * Thirlwall. e CI\\aniD\u00abr-'s Greeee. d Ezekiel xvii. 21"], [166, "158 GREECE \"He held a splendid festival at Memphis, the ancieni capital of the Pharaohs, which stood near the spot where Cairo now stands, but of which there exist no remains, except some blocks of sculptured granite, and other frag ments of large buildings. 25At this period, however, it was a great city, but not conveniently situated for trade, nor was there any maritime town of importance in the country ; a matter of surprise to Alexander, who saw at once the mag nitude of the trade which might be earned on between Eu rope and Asia through Egypt, if the latter country possessed a commodious sea port ; and with this view he traced out the plan of a city, to be built at the moutli of the Nile, in tending to people it with Greeks, and make it the Greek capital of Egypt. The city was built according to his de sign, and called Alexandria, and soon became one of the greatest commercial ports in the world.

He had ele phants and war chariots armed with scythes,6 and his troops were far more numerous than those of his opponent, but inferior in point of discipline and military skill. Alexander wore in the battle a short close vest with a quilted linen breast-plate, and an iron helmet so highly polished that it looked like silver; but there is no mention, on this occasion, of the plumes of white feathers that waved over his crest at Issus. Plutarch, however, in describing his dress, speaks of a superb embroidered belt, a present from the Rhodians, and highly esteemed as the work of a celebrated weaver of Cyprus, named Helicon, who lived about the time of Pericles, and was famed for his skill in weaving garments and hang ings in variegated patterns ; and this belt of Alexander was probably a scarf, as some writers call it a war cloak. c The cloaks generally worn by the Macedonian soldiers were in the form of a semicircle, like the Roman toga, though short er.''

He entered in triumphal procession, followed V-v the army, and was greeted with loud acclamations, for the peo ple of Babylon had never liked the Persian government, and were glad of the change. They therefore reeeived him with great rejoicings, burning incense on silver altars in the streets, and strewing flowers as the conqueror passed along.\" 4 The treasures found in Babylon were immense, for, although it had lost much of its ancient splendour, since it was taken by the Medes and Persians, under Darius, in the time of the impious king Belshazzar,\" (about two hundred years before this,) it was still a very grand city. 5Every soldier in the army received a share of the gold and silver found there, and Alexander ordered that the temples, which had been destroyed by Xerxes, should be rebuilt, the effect of this being to make him extremely popular. 6He then went to Susa, the capital of Darius, and took possession of the palace, which contained more riches than anyplace that had yet fallen into his hands ; and among other valuable stores it is said he found fine purple wool to the amount of five hundred talents,' nearly a million of money ; and it is farther stated that, though it had been laid up one hundred and ninety years, it was still as fresh and beautiful as ever. It was the custom of the conqueror to send the best part of his spoils to his mother, and other friends at a distance; and a pleasant anecdote is told of a present sent to his old tutor Leonidas, who, when he was a boy, had one day reproved him for his extravagance in throwing more incense than was necessary into the fire at a sacrifice. \" Alexander,\" said the monitor, \" when you have conquered the country where spices grow, you may be thus liberal of your incense ; but, in the meantime, use what you have more sparingly.\" Alexander now sent Leonidas a great quantity of frank incense and myrrh, with a letter to the effect that he hope'' he would no longer be churlish in his attention! to the Thirl* Til. b Daniel, v.

At the conclusion of the banquet it was proposed to set fire to the palace, in revenge for the burning of Athens, at the invasion of Xerxes ; and the proposal being received with loud plaudits, Alexander seized a flambeau, and rushed out, with his garland on his head, followed by the whole company, many of them with lighted torches, and the palace was quickly in flames. Its remains are still to be seen in front of a hill. They consist of a number of tall slender columns, several flights of steps, and two highly ornamented gateways. 9 Alexander was very anxious to make Darius his prisoner, and with that intent set out for Ecbatana, but on his arrival he found that the king had made his escape, and was on the road to Bactria, a province of the Persian Empire forming a part of the wide region now called Tartary, anciently Scythia. He followed, and after a long, fatiguing march, overtook the party he was in pursuit of, but the unfortunate king was dead, having been treacherously murdered by Bessus, the satrap of Bac tria, who fled on the approach of the Macedonians, leaving the body of his royal master on the plain. Alexander had it embalmed, and sent it to Persepolis for interment, and then carried his arms against ,0the barbarian tribes of Bactria, and the neighbouring provinces, as far as the borders of India, which were not very easily subdued, so that it took more time to reduce them to subjection than had sufficed to CiSLquer the larger and richer portion of the Empire.

It happened thus. 12There was a fortress on the summit of a rock, held by a chief, named Arimazes, w ho had stationed there a band of his followers, and to this fort another chief named Oxyartes had sent his wife and daugh ters for safety. The rock was nearly perpendicular on all sides, with only one narrow path, and there were provisions within the fort sufficient for two years ; it was therefore thought quite secure; and when Alexander sent to desire its surrender, Arimazes laughed at the messenger, and asked if the Macedonians had wings? The king offered a reward of ten talents to the first of his soldiers who should climb the rock, and several lost their lives in the attempt ; but some succeeded by means of ropes fastened to pegs driven into the frozen snow, for it was in the winter, and the winters is Cabul are very severe. When they had reached the summit they waved flags as signals, on which Alexander sent another messenger to Arimazes, to tell him he might see that the Macedonians had wings; and when the chief looked up and perceived the soldiers, whose numbers he did not know, on the top of the rock, he was so astonished that he surrendered the fort immediately, and the wife and daughters of his friend became captives. But their captivity was not of long duration, for Alexander was so charmed with the grace and beauty of one of the maidens, that he made her his bride, and thus reconciled her father and the people of her nation to his dominion. \"In six campaigns from the battle of Arbela, he had conquered all the countries that had been subject to the king of Persia, so that his Empire now __a-"], [172, "164 GREECE. eluded all Asia from the Caspian sea to the river Indus, and stretched eastward as far as the river Sirr, which divided it from the deserts of the wandering Tartars, or Scythians, as they were then called. J4In the course of these campaigns he founded the cities now known by the names of Candahar and Herat in Affghanistan. 15The extraordinary successes of Alexander had not landed to improve either his temper or disposition. He had adopted the dress of the eastern sovereigns; the flow- ing robes, loose trousers, and tiara or turban, and lived with the pomp and splendour of an Asiatic despot ; but hi^. imitation of the manners of the east was not confined to outward signs, for these were accompanied by many acts of violence and injustice that began to throw dark shadows over the brighter parts of his character. l6Of this he gave a lamentable proof in the execution of his faithful old general Parmenion, who had served both his father am! grandfather, and had always been one of his own mo^t esteemed friends and advisers. The circumstances wert these. Philotas, the son of Parmenion, who had also stood high in the favour of Alexander, and was commander of the horse guards, was accused of being concerned in a plot against the life of that prince; and although there was no proof of his guilt, he was put to death. Some very sligM suspicion also attached to his father, who was at Ecbatana with a division of the army ; but whether Alexander be \u2022 lieved there was any ground for it, or whether he was afraid he would use his power and popularity to revenge the death of his son, is doubtful ; yet in neither case could his conduct be in any way justified. Instead of bringing him to trial, he sent secret orders to the officer next in command, to kill Parmenion at once, before he could hear of his son's fate, or know that there was any charge against himself; and in compliance with these cruel commands, the aged veteran was stabbed, without the least warning, as he"], [173, "GREECE. 165 was reading a letter.\" It is painful to record such acts us these of one who was capable of noble and generous feelings; but to form a just opinion of character, we should hear of the bad deeds of men, as well as of their good actions ; and, at all events, in writing the history of a great man, the truth must be told. 17 Not long after this, Alexander, in a violent fit of rage, killed his friend and preserver, Cleitus, with his own hand ; but this was the rash act of a passionate man, and Cleitus was himself far from blameless, for he provoked the king's wrath by disrespectful taunting speeches ; and, what makes his justification more difficult, Alexander had just bestowed on him the government of Bactria, whither he was to pro ceed the next day. It was after supper, when both were heated with wine, that the unfortunate quarrel arose ; and notwithstanding the endeavours of those present to prevent fatal consequences, by holding the king back, and forcing Cleitus from the room, their efforts were unavailing, for the latter returned unexpectedly by another door, uttering words of defiance, on which Alexander snatched a spear from one of the guards, and rushing towards him, thrust it through his body before any one could interfere. 18 This happened at Maracanda, now Samarcand b in the province of Sogdiana, to the north of Bactria, in the year B.

The former was governed by a king, named Omphis, but called by the Greeks, Taxiles, from Taxila, the name of his capital ; the latter was ruled by Porus, a prince of gigantic stature, dignified mien, and undaunted bravery. 23 These two sovereigns were enemies, and Taxiles, in order to secure a powerful ally, sent to tender his submission to the Macedonian king, assisted in constructing a bridge erver the Indus, probably, on boats or rafts, for the passage of the troops, supplied them with provisions, and having entertained Alexander in the most hospitable manner, and presented him with twenty-five elephants, he joined the expedition against Porus, with five thousand men.\" 24A great battle was fought on the banks of the Hydaspes, in which Porus was defeated and made prisoner, when his noble demeanour under misfortune, gave Alexander so high an opinion of him, that he restored him to his dominions, under vassalage to himself, and even enlarged them by farther conquests, in which Porus assisted him as an ally. The conduct of the conqueror towards this prince has been much extolled ; but in praising his magnanimity on this occasion, it would perhaps be as well to remember that he invaded the territories of a stranger, without the slightest cause of quarrel or complaint ; and as there were no Greek Thirlwall. * Thirlwall. c Smith's ' Biograpiiy and Mythology.* (Ttucilesj"], [175, "GREECE. 167 cities ir Ir.Jia, as in the Persian dominions, to be released from oppression, this invasion may very justly be compared to the lawless depredations of a band of robbers. Taxiles also remained in possession of his kingdom as a tributary prince, having become reconciled to his old enemy, Porus, through the mediation of Alexander, to whom they both remained faithful and firm allies. 25The soldiers had now begun to be impatient at their long absence from their homes, and absolutely refused to proceed any farther, so that their leader was most unwillingly obliged to give up his design of penetrating as far as the Ganges, and retrace his way through the north of Hindostan, to Persia, with a view of returning to Europe. His favourite horse, Buce phalus, died in India, and h\". founded a city on the spot where the noble animal was buried, near the seat of the battle, to which he gave the name of Bucephala. 26 The return of the troops was made easier by the con struction of a fleet of galleys, to carry them by the Hydaspes to the Indus, and down the Indus to the Persian gulf ; and when they set sail, the Hindus went in crowds to witness the sight. Not in peace, however, did the conqueror pursue his way, for he attacked several of the provinces bordering on the Indus, and on one occasion was severely wounded, and very narrowly escaped losing his life. It happened that he was the first in mounting the walls of a town, belonging to a powerful people called the Malli, when the ladder broke under the weight of those who were following him, and he was alone on the top of the wall, exposed to the in rows of the natives beneath. He leaped down among them, and put himself against the wall, under a iar^e tree, fighting against numbers, till an arrow pierced his shoulder. and he fainted, at the very moment his soldiers had scaled fche wall and came to his assistance. They carried him off to his tent, and, in revenge, massacred all the people in the fto-wa.

Goods landed in Egypt, were eonveyed into the Nile by canals, or caravans , and down the Nile to Alex andria, whence they were sent over Europe ; and these continued to be the channels of the eastern trade, and Alex andria became one of the greatest commercial cities in the world, till the discovery of the passage round the Cape of Good Hope, at the close of the fifteenth century. The army, on landing in Asia, had to march through vast deserts, where the soldiers suffered severely from heat and thirst, so that many died in the wilderness; but, 29at length, the main body, with their adventurous commander, reached the Persian capital, about two years after they had passed the Indus. 30 Their return was celebrated with great festivities, for Alexander thought proper to adopt anothei eastern custom, that of having more than one wife, and sc gave his hand to Statira, the eldest daughter of Darius ; all kis principal officers- being married at the same urae. to"], [177, "GKEELft. 169 Persian and Median ladies of noble families.

It is now time to return to the affairs of Greece, and to relate the principal events that had taken place there since the departure of Alexander. 1 The Laced\u00e6monians had never acknowledged his right to rule over the Greeks, nor had they contributed soldiers for the Asiatic expedition, as all the other states had done ; and as soon as they knew that he was on the other side of the Hellespont, they tried to form a powerful league against him, and obtained large supplies of gold from the Persian government, to promote their views. Some of the states joined them ; but others, afraid, perhaps, of the conse quences of a revolt, supported the Macedonian interest, while the Athenians sided with neither party, although the Spartan rulers had attempted to gain their co-operation, by the offer of three-hundred talents.\" All the cities of Arcadia joined the league, except Megalopolis, which was besieged by the allies, under the command of the Spartan king, Agis the Third, and reduced to great extremity, but contrived to hold out till assistance arrived from Antipater, the regent of Macedonia, when a battle was fought, in which Agis was .killed, and the Laced\u00e6monians obliged to sue for peace, which was granted on condition that fifty Spartan nobles should be given as hostages for their future submission. 2Demosthenes the orator still enjoyed a high degree of power and reputation at Athens ; but not long after the battle of Megalopolis, he was accused of having received a bribe to excite a rebellion against Alexander at Athens; and although there appears to have been no ground tor tua a Iabr*_y of Useful Knowledge. \u2014 * History of Grew-e.'"], [180, "172 GREECE. charge,\" he was condemned to pay a fine of fifty talents, and being unable to raise so large a sum, he was obliged to go into exile, and retired to the island of \u00c6gina. 3The age of Philip and Alexander was remarkable for the number of learned men that flourished in Greece, whose names and writings are well known in the present times. \u25a0\u25a0Aristotle, the master of Alexander, had returned to Athens soon after the accession of his royal pupil to the throne, and received from the state a grant of the Lyceum,4 where he soon had a great number of pupils to whom he delivered lectures, whilst walking up and down the shady groves of that celebrated gymnasium. From this habit of walking while teaching, the disciples of his school were called Peripatetics. His works are very numerous, and treat of philosophy, metaphysics, astronomy, natural history, logic, mathematics, and various other sciences. 6Plato, the cele brated philosopher, taught at the academy, a large public school near Athens, which derived its name from the follow ing legend. 6Helen, the beautiful queen of Sparta, was, before her marriage with Menelaus, carried off into Attica by Theseus, and kept in concealment. Her two brothers. Castor and Pollux, or Polydeuces, went in search of her, and were told by Academus, one of the heroes of Attic fable, where she was to be found ; and from their gratitude to him for this intelligence, the Spartans, whenever they in vaded Attica, were forbidden to injure the land belonging to Academus, which was not far from Athens. The piece of laud to which this story was attached, was subsequently formed into an olive grove, and a school founded there called Academia, from the hero of the fabulous tale ; and hence we have the word academy.\" 'Euclid, the great mathematician, whose name is known to a Smith's ' Biography and Mythology,' b Smith's ' Biography and Mythology,' (Aristoteles.) e Smith's ' Biography and Mythology,' t.icademxxs J"], [181, "GREECE. 173 every school boy, lived for some years after Alexander's death, at Alexandria; and a stury is told of him that when Ptolemy, king of Egypt, asked if geometry could not be made easier, replied, \" there was no royal road.\" 8There were many great poets and painters at this period ; among the latter, one of the most distinguished was Apelles, who painted a great many portraits, both of Philip and Alexander; and it is said that, one day, when the latter was in the artist's studio, talking about painting, of which he knew but little, Apelles politely hinted to him that he had better say no more, as the boys who were grinding the colours were laughing at him.

A fleet was equipped, all the citizens under forty years of age ordered to assemble in arms, and embassies sent to the principal states, to announce that Athens was again about to take the lead in restoring freedom to Greece.

Roxana had an infant son, but there was also a half brother of the late king then at Babylon, named Ar hid\u00e6us. a man of weak intellect, so that disputes arose among the generals of the army whether the throne should be reserved for the child of Roxana, and a regent appointed; or whether it should be given to this brother. After much contention, the latter course was adopted, and Arhid\u00e6us was sent for and proclaimed king by the name of Philip ; but as he was incapable of conducting the government, 13Perdiccas, the greatest of the Macedonian generals, became the actual ruler in Asia, and guardian of the weak-minded prince. MAntipater continued to exercise sovereign power in Mace donia; while Ptolemy, another general, was appointed vice roy of Egypt, and others took the government of different provinces. 16But it was not likely this arrangement would ong exist peaceably, for each of these Viceroys aimed at nbtaining the whole empire, and there were also others who desired to obtain governments which they might couvert into kingdoms for themselves ; nor were any scrupulous as to the means by which they might gain the respective objects of their ambition. Secret murders, public executions, and barbarous massacres, were crimes of constant occurrence ; so that few of those who had been prominent characters in Alexander's time, died a natural death. Anarchy and con fusion reigned all over the Empire, and wars were carried on incessantly for years, in Asia, Egypt, Macedonia, and every part of Greece. ll5Perdiccas, the ruler in Asia, and Regent of the Empire, soon proved himself one of the most cruel tyrants that ever exercised sovereign power.

Perdiccas sent an army to reduce them to submission, and a battle was fought, in which they were vanquished. Pithon, the .ommander of the government forces, granted a free pardc i to all the survivors ; but Per diccas, previously suspecting that he had some ambitious design, and would try to attach the insurgents to himself, sent private orders to despatch them all when disarmed ; and this barbarous mandate was obeyed, notwithstanding the endeavours of Pithon to prevent the massacre.

Antipater, however, refused to treat with the confederacy, but said he would do so with each state separately, on which they with drew from the league one by one, and made the best term they could for themselves.

These were better than they had reason to expect : all their property being left untouched and the chief point insisted on, was,- that the democratica. form of government should be abolished, and the right oi voting at the assemblies limited, according to the laws of Solon, to such as possessed a certain amount of property; a change that deprived about twelve thousand of the poorer citizens of their greatest privilege. A Macedonian garrison was stationed at Munychis., one of the ports of Athens, to keep the people in subjection, and 19it was demanded that the leaders of the late attempt to restore independence should be given tip. This last demand could not be complied with, for they had all fled from the city, and although sentence of death was passed upon them, it would only have had the effect of causing them to remain in exile, but that Antipater, who considered them dangerous persons, sent emissaries to search them out in their places of refuge. Demosthenes had gone to the small island of Calauria, near \u00c6gina, where he was dis covered in a temple, and, to avoid falling into the hands of Antipater, he swallowed poison, being then about sixty years of age. This happened in the year B. C. 322. 20It was not long before Antipater became aware of the ambitious schemes of Perdiccas, and in conjunction with Ftolemy of Egypt, declared war against him, on which he immediately marched into Egypt with a formidable army ; but his tyranny had caused disaffection among the troops, and he was assassinated in his tent by some of his own officers. 21 In consequence of this event, the regency of Asia devolved on Antipater, who was thus at the head of almost the whole of Alexander's Empire ; 22but his greatness was not destined to be of long duration, for he died in the fol lowing year, having appointed for his successor, Poly perchnn, the oldest of Alexander's surviving generals, but a"], [185, "GREECE. 177 man who was by no means equal to the difficulties of so elevated a position. Besides, he had a powerful enemy to contend with in Cassander, the son of Antipater, who thinking he had a better right to succeed his father than any other, determined to go to war with Polyperchon, and obtain the regency by force of arms. 23He was a man of ability, but as wicked and cruel as Perdiccas, and like him did not hesitate to sacrifice whatever stood in the way of the point at which he aimed. The war between these rivals was carried on in Greece for nearly two years, when Cassander had gained so decided a superiority, that those cities which at first had been favourable to the Regent, went over to his enemy, who began to see his way to the throne of Macedonia. While he was thus engaged in Greece, some extraordinary events took place in Macedonia, where two royal heroines rendered this war memorable by taking a prominent part in it. 24The one was Olympias, the mother of Alexander; the other, Eurydice, the wife of the imbecile king Arhid\u00e6us, a woman of a masculine spirit, between whom and Olvmpias an implacable enmity subsisted. After the assassination of Perdiccas, Eurydice had endeavoured tc obtain the chief authority in Asia, and had shewn her fear less disposition by boldly haranguing the soldiers against Antipater,\" who, however, disconcerted her plans by his arrival ; and, when he was fully acknowledged as Regent of the east as well as of Macedonia, took her and her husband back with him to Pella. 2501ympias had never been on friendly terms with Anti pater, and, since Alexander's death, had lived at the court of Epeirus; but she made use of all her influence to support the cause of Polyperchon against his rival, while Eurydice entered into a league with Cassander, and as he was fully occupied with the affairs of Greece, she assembled an army for him, and headed it herself.

But Olympias, who had been guilty of other wicked deeds, diu not long escape the punishment due to her crimes; 2?for Cassander hastened to Macedonia, and laid siege to the town of Pydna, where she had shut her self up , and as he succeeded in cutting off all supplies, the garrison was obliged by famine to surrender, but on condition that the life of Olvmpias should be spared. Cassander made the promise, but with no intention of fulfilling it, for no sooner was she in his power, than he caused her to be arraigned before the court of the Macedonians, for the murders of the king and queen, and also of his own brother, and others who had been executed by her com mand. She was condemned to death without a hearing, on which she demanded to be allowed to speak in her own defence : but as Cassander was afraid of the effect of such an appeal, he sent a body of soldiers to carry the sentence into execution, and as these men hesitated, on seeing her, to fulfil their orders, the friends of those who had suffered death at her hands, rushed in and despatched her with many wounds.\" She met her fate with heroic dignity, for she had much of that lofty spirit which had distinguished her sou, one great reason, perhaps, why she was regarded witb \u00abo u SmiV'u'iy 'tttiiigftqi A *nt1 SflytWtfgy-,' {.Olympian*}"], [187, "GREECE, 179 much veneration by the Macedonians in general.

As he was then more powerful than either of the other potentates, 2a league was formed against him by Cassander, Ptolemy, Lysimachus, the ruler of Thrace, and Seleucus, who had held the government of Babylonia, but had been expelled by Antigonus. The whole of Greece was in the most dreadful state of anarchy, each of the contending parties holding out a pro spect of independence to the Greeks, and each gaining allies in consequence ; so that war raged in every state and strife in every council. Many battles were fought by land and sea, both in Europe and Asia with varied success, till all began to wish for an interval of peace, and 3a treaty was concluded in 311, by which it was settled that Cassander should retain his authority in Macedonia as Regent, till the young king"], [189, "181 GREECE. Alexander came of age ; that Lysimachus should keep pos session of Thrace; Ptolemy of Egypt, and Antigonus hold the government of Asia. In this treaty, the Greeks were declared independent, but this was never carried into effect, for Cassander obtained absolute power over all European Greece, and Antigonus never granted independence to the Greek cities in Asia. 4It was in these wars, that the Greeks first used elephants, which had been brought into Europe, where they were previously unknown, by Antipater, who was in Asia for a short time after the invasion of India. The peace was followed by another of those dreadful crimes that disgrace the names of so many of the com manders who had served with renown under Alexander the Great. 6 The son of that monarch was now growing up beyond childhood, but he was in the power of one who had long determined that he should never reach an age to wear his father's crown, to which his title had been fully recog nized. In fact, some of his partisans began to demand that he should be released from confinement, and placed at once on the throne ;\" on which the regent caused both the hapless prince and his mother to be secretly murdered, and thus got rid of the rival he most feared. 6 Soon after this tragical event, war was renewed, and Demetrius, the son of Antigonus, who was afterwards king of Macedonia, began to take a leading part.

Four years h;.d passed since the agreement was made that Greece should be an independent state, yet Cassander and Ptolemy held all the principal cities by means of gar- risons, and exercised entire control over them. Demetrius was, therefore, sent with a powerful army to liberate the Greeks from the power of these usurpers, and he was received at Athens with honours as extravagant as they would have paid to any of their deified heroes.

The former arrived first, and succeeded in placing the young prince on the throne, for which service he was re warded with a large portion of the Macedonian territories ; so that when Demetrius came, he found himself forestalled, and mutual jealousy arose between him and Pyrrhus, in con sequence, notwithstanding their relationship.

Soon after the departure of Pyrrhus for Italy, Greece was invaded by a new and unlooked-for enemy. It was one hundred and ten years since the city of Rome was destroyed by the Gauls, when a large body of those warlike barba rians appeared in Macedonia, B. C. 279, laying waste the country, according to their savage mode of warfare, with fire and sword, their chief object being plunder. 2The next year they came again, led by a chief, of the ominous name of Brennus, and advanced to the pass of Thermopyl\u00e6, where a powerful army of Greeks, from the different states, had assembled to oppose their progress. A battle3 was fought, in which the barbarians were defeated and driven back through the pass, with great loss, on which their leader devised a plan to weaken the Grecian army, by drawing away the \u00c6tolians, who were a numerous body ; and to effect this, he sent a division of his Gauls into the province of \u00c6tolia, where they began to sack the towns, and treat the inhabitants with such shocking cruelty, that those who were with the army, at Thermopyl\u00e6 hurried westward, to defend their ho-nes and families. 4 Brennus having thus gained his object, discovered the path by which the Persians had, at a former period, sur prised the Spartan king, Leonidas ; but on this occasion, the Greeks, having notice of their approach, escaped by sea, in the ships of the Athenians, and the Gauls marched on towards Delphi, in the hope of plundering the temple ot its rich treasures.

The Gauls were pursued in their retreat, both from \u00c6tolia and Phocis, and of the many thousands who had followed Brennus in this enter prise, nearly all were destroyed. 6Pyrrhus was unsuccessful in his war with the Romans, and returned to Epeirus, after an absence of six years, having performed many heroic deeds, both in Italy and Sicily, so that he was looked upon as the greatest general of the age, although he had not been fortunate. 7He next invaded Macedonia, where he met with better success, and was again made king; but scarcely was he seated on the throne, tlian he was tempted to engage in a new enterprise. 8 It happened that Cleonymus, the son of one of the kings of Sparta, had been excluded from the throne, at his father's death, on account of his tyrannical disposition,0 and his nephew, Areus, had been appointed to succeed the de ceased monarch. With a view of displacing his nephew, he applied for aid to Pyrrhus, who readily acceded to his request, and marched into Laconia, at the head of a power ful army, rendered more formidable by the addition of twenty-four elephants, and a body of barbarians ; for the Greek princes now frequently used elephants in their wars, and the Macedonian kings had, at this period, a number of Celts, or Gauls, in their armies, many of them being willing ThirlwaU. b ' Smith's Biography and Mythology.'

Areus, the king, was absent from Sparta at the time of the invasion, and the city was unprepared for defence ; yet the Spartans resolved to make a desperate resistance. 9It was proposed to send away all the women to Crete, but this was opposed by a lady of noble birth, named Archidamia, the richest heiress in Sparta, who entered the assembly to protest against the decree, with a drawn sword in her hand ; and, animated by her example, all the women resolved to aid in defending the city.\" They assisted in digging a deep ditch, at which they worked the whole of one night, and, Sparta being but partially walled, made a barricade of waggons, to oppose the elephants. 10The assailants made repeated attacks, but the Spartans held out bravely till King Areus arrived, with a body of troops, from Crete, and other succours coming at the same time, Pyrrhus was obliged to retreat. nit happened, just at this time, that a contest arose at Argos, between two claimants for the sovereign power; and one of them sent to request the aid of Pyrrhus, who pro ceeded thither with his army ; but he had to fight his way, as the Spartans had hastened to occupy some of the passes on the road ; and in one of these engagements his eldest son was slain, which was a great grief to him. At length he reached Argos, but was followed by the Laced\u00e6monians, and having entered the town, with a part of his army, in the night, found himself so surrounded by enemies, that he soon saw it would be necessary to retreat, and gave orders to that effect ; but as his troops were pushing through the gateway, one of the elephants fell down and stopped the passage, and another became unmanageable, and dashed among the soldiers, treading down numbers of them.

C. 272.

His death wa\u00bb an important event, as it left the field clear for the struggle between the liberty of Greece and the power of Macedonia, a contest that was never decided, and only terminated by the subjection of both to the still greater power of the Roman republic. ,3The whole of Greece was, at this time, in a most de plorable condition, much like the state of England during the civil wars of York and Lancaster. Bands of robber. infested the country in every direction, and frequently aided the princes in their wars with each other,* and many of the cities were suffering under the oppressions of petty despots, set up and protected by greater tyrants. It is not to be supposed that agriculture, or trade, could prosper under such circumstances, and the poverty and distress of the people in general must have been very great. 14This state of things gave rise to a confederacy among the cities of Achaia, known by the name of the Achaian league, after wards so famous, that when Greece became a Roman pro vince, the name of Achaia was given to the whole country. The union was begun in 280, when four of the cities combined, to defend their rights and liberties.

He was the son of Cleinias, one of the chief rulers of Sicyon, a republic of the Peloponnesus ; but, when he was but seven years old, his father was assassinated, and himself saved with diffi culty, by an aunt, who conveyed him to some friends in Argos, where he lived till he arrived at manhood, when he began to cherish the hope of delivering Greece from the evils that were bringing the country to ruin.

SPARTA. (225 to 213 B. C.) It was long since Sparta had taken any prominent part in the affairs of Greece, and great changes had gradually fol lowed in that state, where the people no longer regarded their ancient institutions, but had become as fond of luxu rious indulgences as the rest of the Grecians, so that the state of society was entirely altered, and the Spartans were not all upon an equality, as they had been, when rich and poor lived in the same hardy manner. The use of perfumes and the custom of reclining on couches at meals had been introduced in the reign of Areus, and when once the fashion was set, it was eagerly followed by all the wealthy citizens, who thus became a distinct class from those who could not afford to live expensively.\" 2A new law had been made with regard to landed posses sions which increased the separation between the higher and lower classes. Formerly, the land of a Spartan descended to his heir, nor could he sell, or leave it to any one else ; but now, the head of a family might dispose of his estate as he chose, either by sale or bequest, 3the effect of which was, that instead of every Spartan having his portion of laud, gome had large estates while others had none ; and many of the landed proprietors were females.* There were not more than seven hundred true Spartan families remaining, and of these, not above one hundred possessed estates, while the a Ttaillwi-U. 4 Ttairlwa-l."], [204, "196 GREECE. poor were burthened with debts.\" Such was the state A things at Sparta, when 4Agis the Fourth, in the year 244 B. C, ascended the throne, a patriotic prince whose greatest ambition was to restore his country to its ancient condition. With this view 5he tried to pass a law for a new division of the lands, so that every citizen might have an equal portion as in olden times ; and he nobly offered to give up his own extensive patrimony, at the same time declaring that his mother and his grandmother who both held large estates, were ready to relinquish them for the public benefit. 6But his plans were opposed by more selfish men, and especially by Leonidas, the other king, who liking the new style of living much better than the old, opposed any scheme of reform that would interfere with it, and almost all the wealthy people were of his way of thinking. 7Agis therefore had many powerful enemies, and in less than four years, was put to death by order of the Ephors, on a charge of attempting to violate the laws, and the ladies of his family who had so nobly come forward to offer their aid in the cause of reform, shared his untimely fate. 8Leonidas then reigned without a colleague, and thus, for the first time perhaps, Sparta had but one king ; though since the fall of the third Agis at Megalopolis, little is known of the kinirs of the house of Procles. 9At this period the first Punic war was going on between the Romans and Carthaginians, and it is supposed that the tyranny of Leonidas, in the earlier part of his reign, drove the Spartan general Xanthippus to enter the service of the latter, who, by his aid, defeated the Romans under Regulus.4 10After the death of Agis, Leonidas obliged his young widow Agiatis, a rich heiress, to marry his son Cleomenes, a youth underage; and although it \\v*i with great reluctance she gave him her hand, she soon began to entertain a sincer* a Smith's ' Biography and Mythology.'

He was convinced the senate would never agree to restore the ancient form of the constitution, but he thought that, if the Spartans were to obtain the mastery over all the Greek states by force of arms, the very necessity of keeping up their warlike character would induce them to re-establish the institutions that had so long made Sparta the greatest military power in Greece. Accordingly, when 12he succeeded to the throne, at the death of Leonidas, B. C. 236, I3he went to war with the Ach\u00e6an league; and, as the purpose of both parties was to effect a general union of the states of the Peloponnesus, the question was, whether they were to be united under the government established by the league, or under that of Sparta.* Thus Aratus and Cleomenes were opposed to each other. In the early part of the contest, Cleomenes met with some successes, and as s on as he felt himself sufficiently powerful to begin his intended reforms, he boldly commenced the work, and, about ,4ten years after his accession, accomplished the revolution he had so long projected. It was not done without violence, for the whole sovereign power was in the hands of the Ephors, to whom the kings had long been subordinate ; therefore it was only by their destruction that success could be ensured ; a dreadful alternative, but one not unusual in Greece at every period of its history. A party of soldiers, headed by Cleomenes, entered the room where the Ephors were at supper, and four of them were killed, but the fifth escaped, and taking sanctuary in a temple, his life was spared. ,4The next morning, Cleomenes banished eighty of the citi- Sn_ith's \u2022 Biography and Mythology,' (Cleomenes.)

He also re-established the ancient customs of public meals and plain fare, and the severe discipline that was exercised in former times with regard to the education of youth.\" This revolution took place in 225 B. C. l6In the meantime, Aratus had applied for aid to the king of Macedonia.

Three years more of civil warfare in Greece, had done their part in adding to the miseries that were already spread throughout that un happy land. 20Antigonus was dead, and his nephew, Philip the Fifth, had ascended the throne of Macedonia at the earlv age of seventeen; but although so young, he displayed great mili tary talents, and gave his support to the Ach\u00e6an league, of which Aratus, who became the chief friend and counsellor of the youthful monarch, was still the head.

TYRANTS OF SPARTA. (213 to 183 B. C.) 'For several years after the death of Aratus, the history of Greece is only a confused relation of different wars, that seem to have had no great or determined object. From time to time, the government of Rome interfered, and sent aid to one or other of the contending parties, always siding against Philip of Macedonia, who on one occasion invaded Attica, and having made an unsuccessful attack upon the city of Athens, wantonly destroyed the sacred and pleasant places in its suburbs, defacing the tombs and statues, and wasting with fire the beautiful temples, groves, and gardens of the Academy and Lyceum ; after which, he marched through the rural districts, ravaging the whole country, and burning the village temples, which, though not so richly adorned as those of the capital, were of venerable antiquity"], [209, "GREECE. 201 and contained many valuable works of ait.* 2It was long since the Athenians had taken any leading part in tne affairs of Greece. Their commerce had declined, their empire was gone; their navy reduced to three ships, and they possessed 10 territory beyond their own unfertile province, which yielded but little towards the support of the population ; so that the once proud and wealthy Athenians depended in great measure on occasional donations of corn and money from the kings of Egypt and other rich potentates, who wished to keep on good terms with a state which, however fallen, always ranked as the first in Greece.4 3In the mean time, the monarchy at Sparta had been overthrown, the Ephoralty abolished, and a tyranny established, which might indeed well be so called, for never were two greater tyrants than those who ruled in succession under that title. 4The first was Machanidas, who ruled by the aid of his merce nary soldiers, and made himself the terror of all the neigh bouring states, till, in the year 207 B. C. he was killed in battle by Philop\u0153men, the general of the Ach\u00e6an league. The next tyrant of Sparta was Nabis, whose wickedness and barbarity exceeded all that is told of the worst of the Roman Emperors. By the help of his military force, he banished the wealthiest of the citizens, and extorted money from others by the application of torture. He scrupled not to plunder the temples ; protected the pirates of Crete, that they might give him a share of their booty; made Sparta an asylum for bad characters of all descriptions ; and freed a o-reat numbers of Helots, on whom he bestowed lands, not from motives of benevolence, but to have them entirely at his eommand, and to make them the instruments of his wicked purposes.0 6The war between Philip and the Romans was still proceeding, and \u25a0'in the year 198, an embassy was sent a Thirlwall. b Library of Useful Knowledge e Snvtl.'s ' Biography and Mythology,' cNaf-is.)"], [210, "GkEECE. 202 from Rome, to propose an alliance with the Ach\u00e6an league, which had, as yet, preserved a neutrality between them. The question of this alliance gave rise to much disagree ment in families, and greatly embittered the pleasures of social intercourse; for it was a subject of such genera. interest that it formed the topic of conversation, both in public and private , and as some were favourable, while others were opposed to the measure, disputes were frequent and violent, even among friends and relatives.\" The treaty was, however, concluded, and the Ach\u00e6ans abandoned the cause of Philip, and joined with his adversaries, on the ground that the conduct and views of the Macedonian king were detrimental to the liberties of Greece, which it was the ob ject of the league to maintain. 8In the following year, a great victory was gained over Philip, at Cynoscephal\u00e6, in Thessaly, by the Roman general Flaminius ; after which, 9peace was made on condition that all the towns in Greece that were held by Macedonian garrisons should be surren dered ; all prisoners sent back without ransom ; all vessels of war given up, except five ships and the state galley; and one thousand talents paid by Philip, one half then, and the rest within ten years. 10This treaty was concluded at Corinth, by commissioners from Rome, and the different states that had taken part in the war ; and as it was at the time of the Isthmian games, the city was crowded with people /rom all parts of Greece, anxious to know what use the Romans would make of their victory. Before the games began, a trumpet was sounded, and a herald proclaimed that the Roman Senate and the consul Titus Quinctius Flaminius, having conquered the Macedonians, gave liberty to all the states that had been under their control, with exemption from garrir-ons and tribute.

Flaminius then proceeded to Ar gos, and was invited to preside at the Nemean Games, which had been discontinued during the general distress, but were now celebrated with much rejoicing, B.

Many of the inhabitants were men who had been placed there by Nabis, and were in possession of the property of those citizens who had been banished by the tyrant, so that they were in dread lest the exiles should be restored bv the Leasue, and their houses and lands given back to them. 19These men, therefore, revolted, and put to death some of Philopcemen's friends; on which that general marched against Sparta, and quickly made himself master of the citv.

Lycortas and his friends, thought that the 'liberty of Greece would be least endangered by preserving a neu trality ; and there was a party, headed by an unprincipled person, named Callicrates, who seems to have been quite ready to sacrifice the interests of his country, in order to gain the favour of the Romans. He, therefore, opposed the opinion of Lycortas ; and, after much discussion, 5it was agreed not to interfere in the war unnecessarily, but to avoid giving offence to the Romans, by letting them know that assistance would be afforded, if required, aad Polybius was sent into Macedonia, to communicate this resolution to the Roman consul, Marcius, who declined the aid of the Ach\u00e6ans for the present. 6The war between Perseus and the Romans lasted nearly four years, during which, many Greek cities in alliance"], [215, "GREECE. 207 with Rome, suffered greatly from the exactions and arbi trary conduct of different Roman commanders.

C, a decisive battle was fought, near Pydna, when the Roman consul, \u00c6milius Paulus, gained a complete victory, and Perseus soon after wards surrendered himself and his children to the con queror, who treated them with great kindness, and per mitted the captive monarch to have as much liberty as was consistent with his unfortunate position.* In the following year, Paulus made a journey through the states of Greece, and redressed many grievances ; after which, he went to Amphipolis, where he made arrangements for the future government of Macedonia, in conjunction with ten commis sioners, who had been sent from Rome for that purpose. \"The country was divided into four districts, of which Amphipolis, Thessalonica, Pella, and Pelagonia, were the capitals. Each was to be governed by a Macedonian council, and to remain so distinct from the rest, that inter marriages were prohibited, and the people forbidden to pur chase houses or land out of their own districts In one respect, however, the people were better off than they had been before, for the tribute, or tax on property, to be paid to Rome, was fixed at only half the amount that had been expected by the kings of Macedonia.1* The a Library of Useful Knowledge. b Smith's ' Biography and Mythology.'

These ill-fated cities were plundered by the Roman soldiers, their walls pulled down, and their inhabitants sold for slaves. \"On the return of \u00c6milius Paulus to Borne, he was honoured with a magnificent triumphal procession, in which, according to the barbarous custom of the Romans, the cap tive monarch of Macedonia was, with his children, com pelled to walk before the triumphal chariot of the conqueror, and then cast into a dungeon.

The history of the Greeks, as a free and independent pen pie, closes for ever with the Roman conquest ; Jyet, for a long time afterwards, the general state of society does not appear to have materially altered, as most of the states were permitted to retain, in name at least, a republican form of government, although, in reality, ruled in great measure according to the pleasure of the Roman governor. Athens was still, for several centuries, distinguished as the chief seat of learning, and it was as customary to send young men of rank and fortune from Rome, to complete their education there, as it is for English students to go to Oxford or Cambridge, Horace and Cicero may be cited as exam ples. The religious usages of the Greeks were not inter fered with, so that all the national festivals, in which the Romans now took a part, were held as usual ; and probably, in the early years of the Roman domination, a large propor tion of the people scarcely felt the change ; for it was not in Greece, as in other countries subdued by the Romans, where civilisation was suddenly introduced among people, who, till then, had been in a state of barbarism \u2022 but here the case was widely different, and the conquerors, not the conquered, were the people to be improved. 3About sixty years after the conquest, some of the Greeks made an effort to recover their liberty, by the aid of Mithn dates, the powerful king of Pontus, who was at war with the Romans, and had gained several victories over their armies, in Asia Minor.

Under them were the Agas, or rulers of villages, and other subordinate officers, not less oppressive than their superiors, and from their petty tyranny the unfortunate peasantry had no appeal. The difference of religion kept the Greeks entirely dis tinct from the Turks, as no intermarriages could take place ; and, moreover, the latter, in general, looked with abhorrence on all who were not true believers, or worshippers of their prophet Mohammed. Under the Turkish dominion, therefore, the mass of the Greek population was a poor, ignorant, despised and op pressed race; while the country, once so populous, rich, and highly cultivated, presented in most parts the dreary aspect of a thinly peopled desert, studded with ruins of magnifi cent temples and other ancient monuments of Grecian art. These have attracted the visits of travellers, at various times, who uniformly speak of the poverty and wretchedness of the people, especially in the Peloponnesus, called, after the conquest of the Turks, the Morea. The condition of continental Greece, however, was better than that of the peninsula. Athens, although under the autnonty of a Turkish governor, was the abode of many respe?taole families, and in many of the villages the people \u00aber-: t. mtenteu, and celebrated their holiday games with"], [228, "220 CKEECE. abundance of mirth and festivity. A very small proportion of the country was under cultivation, and the svstem of agriculture was bad ; yet, owing to the genial climate, and the fertility of the soil, the produce was more than equal tc 'be labour bestowed upon it, and consisted chiefly of barley, rice, cotton, and tobacco. The olives of Attica were still us fine and productive as in ancient times, and the mul berry tree was cultivated in various parts of Greece for the purpose of feeding silk-worms. The shepherds and the fishermen formed a large portion of the Greek population und\u00abr the Turks, and many of the peasants of Attica gained a livelihood by collecting from the hills, the wood of of the dwarf oak, shrubs, and brushwood, to make into charcoal. Most of the ancient cities, in course of time, had dwin dled into mere villages, but in some of them were good houses inhabited by Greek merchants, and other men of ivealrh and consequence. The houses were built like those of the east, with only one story, and contained separate apartments for the female part of the family, who lived in complete seclusion, as in ancient times, and were entirely uneducated. Those who were rich enough had a great number of slaves to wait upon them, not usually Greeks, but Circassians, or Georgians, some of whom were pur chased when children, and taught music, singing, and dancing, to amuse their mistresses. Under the Komans, the Greeks of the higher classes dressed in the Koman fashion ; under the Turks, they adopted very nearly the Turkish costume, except that, not seing allowed to wear the white muslin turban, thev wore a blue one. The general costume oi the peasants, was a tunic and a red cap. In the year 1772, the people of the Morea, incited bv the Russians, rose in rebellion against the Turkish govern ment and although the insurrection was then supptessed."], [229, "GREECE. 221 the spirit of disaffection continued to prevail, and an ardent desire to establish freedom and independence was spread throughout Greece. Secret societies were formed, and plans laid to promote this object, till at length, in 1817, the Greeks took up arms against their rulers, headed by Ali Pacha, an Albanian chief, formerly a captain of ban ditti, but for services rendered to the sultan, subsequently' made governor of Jannina, the chief city of Albania, where he had become notorious for his oppressive cruelty, and had acquired for himself a principality extending over Thessaly, which he held almost independent of the Porte. By his aid, the insurgent Greeks were able to maintain the struggle for several years ; nor did they abandon the cause alter his death, which took place in 1822, when his palace was sur rounded by the sultan's troops, and himself killed, fighting desperately to the last. For some time, very little attention was paid by other nations to the contest between the Greeks and the Turks, which was carried on with the utmost ferocity by both par ties ; but by degrees a strong feeling in favour of Grecian liberty manifested itself in various countries, especially in England and France, and bands of volunteers went out to join the Greeks, while sums of money were liberally con tributed to aid the cause. A desultory warfare was carried on, under several chiefs, for six years longer, during which, Athens was besieged and taken by the Turks, and the cause of the Greeks seemed on the point of being lost, when the Count Capo DTstrias, a Greek nobleman, who held an appoi.-.tment at the court of Russia, was solicited to take the management of affairs in Greece ; and, under the title of president, he established something like a regu lar government, and endeavoured to organize an army from the irregular bands of marauders that had hitherto carried on the war more like brigands than soldiers, many of the"], [230, "222 GREECP. lenders being bandit chiefs, who, with their men, had joined the insurgents. Shortly after the election of the new president, the gov ernments of Great Britain, Russia, and France, determined to interfere in the war, on account of the interruption it had caused to the trade of the Mediterranean sea. Propo sals were made to the sultan that he should erect Greece into a free state, in consideration of receiving an annual tribute ; but this proposition was rejected ; on which the \u201e<v<_.o above mentioned declared war against the Porte, and a naval battle was fought in 1827, in the bay of Navarino, on the west coast of the Morea, in which the Egyptian and Turkish fleets were destroyed. This victory however, did not put an immediate end to the war, which lasted nearly two years longer ; when, in consequence of a victory gained over the Turks by the Russians, the sultan was compelled to acknowledge the independence of the Greeks, who, on the 14th of September, 1829, once more becf._T _ a free people. The limits of the Greek state were then settled, and the line that now divides it from Turkey, extends from a little to the south of Actium, on the west ; to a little north of Thermopyl\u00e6, on the east ; so that Thessaly, now the district of Jannina, is included in the Turkish dominions. The new state received the ancient name of Hellas, and was erected into a monarchy, the second son of the king of Bavaria, the young prince Otho, being placed on the throne. The kingdom of Hellas includes the ancient provinces of Attica, B\u0153otia, \u00c6tolia, Acarnania, Locris, and Phocis, all comprehended under the name of Livadia ; the Morea, and several small islands. Candia, the ancient Crete, belongs to Turkey ; and the Ionian Islands on the western coast of Greece, have, ever since the year 1815, constituted a dis tinct republic, under the protection of Great Britain, and garrisoned by British troops."], [231, "GitEECE. 223 Tne government of the republic is vested in a High Coin niTStiou.ir, who is the representative of the British Sovereign, and resides at Korfou ; a Legislative Assembly of twenty u. embers, and a Senate of five, elected by the Assembly, with a President appointed by the Commissioner. More than three fourths of the cultivable soil is laid out in cur rant grounds vineyards, and olive plantations. Since the accession of Otbo, Athens has been almost entirely rebuilt with straight streets, and good bouses, but the old part of the city still exhibits the narrow muddy lanes, aud clay dwellings of the ancient capital. A good road, on which oninibusses mil continually, connects the city with the Port of Pir\u00e6us. Sparta, long deserted and in ruins, has also been rebuilt, and is the capital of the new province or government of Laced\u00e6mon ; for in 1838, the kingdom was divided into twenty four governments, many ot which are called by their ancient names. The Mainotes, who inhabit one of the promontories in the south of the Morea, pretend to be descended from the ancient Spartans, and are a lawless race of people, ruled by hereditary chiefs; and the Arnauts or Albanians who occupy a great part of Livadia and the western part of the Morea, are very nume rous, and are the descendants of colonists of various nations who have settled in Greece at different periods. After the liberation of Greece, schools were established in several parts of the country, and a university, and symnasium, er preparatory college, at Athens : besides two Lancastrian schools, one for boys, the other for girls; but school books and able teachers were scarce, so that education did not make much progiess.
