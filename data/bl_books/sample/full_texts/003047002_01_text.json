TH E oldeft of the Heathen Gads was Coslus, whoft &?# Saturn is formtimts defcrib r d like an eld man< devouring his Children-,., and at others with Wings and a Scyth ; with which having fpoilt his Fathers propagating; Faculty, lift he fhouldproduce other Beings, fome of the Blood fell into the Sea, and mixing with- the foamy Waves give birth to Venus. By Ccelm the Ancients feem to have meant the Heavens, whole motions give birth to Time, which k figured by Saturn, made old becaufe firft created ;, and faid to devour his Children, Time devouring its Off-fpring. The Wings imply its fwiftnefs, and the Scyth that it mows down all. Saturn caftrating Ctelus fhows, that Time foon takes from things the power of multiplying their Kind, left they fhould encreafe to too great a Number, and that the. Deftruttion of one is the production of another ; alfb, that even after the lofs of the Power, Defire fluctuates, and creat.es Venus^ Fair Venus is the Wife of limping Vulcan, and Cu pid is her Son', Mars/V the Son of Juno, who by the ad vice of Flora, begot him , having- toucbt a Flower , tv kt even with Jupiter, who begot Minerva out of his Brain without any other help. Mars is charmed, courts and enjoys Venus, but Phcebus difcovers this to Vulcan, who 'frames fo artificial a Net, that he (ecures Mars and Venus in it, who 'are 'exposed to the laughter of the Gods,.
