He took the cup, filled full with purple wine, That thrilled the soul with ecstasy divine, And gave to His disciples, \u2014 bade them make The holy chalice sacred for His sake ; Think of their souls when, at the evening tide, They broke their bread by hearth or mountain side. He gave the cup of promise and of love To others \u2014 though already close above, Death's silent shadows gathered o'er His head, Who needs must die ere He could raise the dead, Who needs must suffer ere He wiped the tears From suffering millions through the coming years, Who needs must drain the dregs of human grief Ere to our human souls He brought relief, 3"], [8, "4 Who needs must writhe 'neath sin's most deep disgrace, And feel the hiding of the Father's face, \u2014 Feel all forsaken, near the open grave, By Him whose hand alone has power to save. All this He suffered with a soul divine : Will you refuse His gift of bread and wine ? As the red rays of sunset fill the sky Till earth is bathed with light that, though it die, Eeturns to earth through all the cloudy years, \u2014 So this memorial of His death appears An endless glory round the sinner shriven, Embracing earth with the pure light of heaven. As the still stars from their wide dome of blue Pierce with bright points the ocean's bosom through ; As the pure mountains, robed in virgin snow, Flash ere they fade with sunset's roseate glow ; As coral isles where southern waters lave Shine through the blue and blush beneath the wave ; So faith may through the sacraments still see Reflections of the glory yet to be. But vain that faith, if, like to Simon's son, We take the bounty of the Holy One, Vain if we have not learnt that precept true, To do to men as we would have men do, To wash the feet alike of friend and foe, To be most lowly when amongst the low. Naked, if clothed in purple ; gentle, mild. For precedence, Christ took a little child,"], [9, "5 And, 'twixt contending zealots for high place, Lifted the semblance of an angel's face. \" Love one another \" ; \" Drink ye all of this.\" Servant and master, take your equal bliss ; King, priest, and penitent, \u2014 to each is given The bread of life, the wine that flows from heaven. So Jesus, ere He died, to all bequeathed The breath of everlasting love He breathed, The sacred feast \u2014 the thought for others \u2014 who May seem as humbler brethren unto you, The hate of evil and the love of truth That hallows age and glorifies man's youth, \u2014 The thought for others who, though wandering far, The Father's children and our brethren are ; The love of Him, who gave us love divine, Together with His gift of bread and wine. From the dull glare of lamplight to the street Christ trod the road with weary, wayworn feet. Emblem of love that, while it giveth all, Receives so little, if it gains at all. The moonlight shone on one half of the way, Turning to silver \u2014 sand, and stones, and clay, Save where the shadows of the houses made A clear, sharp line of architectural shade. Clear in the moonlight moved towards the gate The God, the Man, the Master of man's fate, Whilst through the shadows dimly you might trace Semblance of sin, \u2014 Iscariot's darkening face. So the God-Man passed onward into light And the man-devil to eternal night."], [10, "6 Symbolic champions of the fearful strife Of good and evil in all forms of life, Darkness and shadow leading to the grave, Suffering and sorrow bearing light to save. Leave darkness then behind, the crowded street, The dying echoes of the traitor's feet, The sound of feasting, and the cries of pain, The bleating of the lambs which shall be slain At that last Passover, and let us weep With Him who mourns a suffering world asleep. GETHSEMANE There is a strange, sad music in the word, Like the soft wail of leaves at midnight heard, Or like the whispering of the murmuring rill, When all the other sounds of earth are still. The stricken bird wailing its broken nest, The hunted creature vainly seeking rest ; The bitterness of finding friends asleep While death's dark shadows slowly round us creep, The clang of faction and the traitor's kiss, \u2014 Gethsemane, to Christians, means all this. O'er the hushed groves the moon its lustre threw, That silvered the young green and gemmed the dew, Where Sharon's rose still drooped its blood-stained leaf O'er lilies pale as human hearts with grief, And Kedron's waters sobbed along the shore They washed with tears, but ne'er shall visit more."], [11, "7 Alone ! in the heart of the garden, Alone ! in the silence of night, While the sons of the city were feasting, Christ stood in the pitiless light Of a dead world burnt out with its sorrow, In a dead world that burns with its sin, In the face of an awful to-morrow, When the powers of darkness begin. Alone ! while His children are sleeping, Blind-eyed, in the midst of the dark, The Christ, the Creator is weeping For the souls that are naked and stark, For the dimness of man's comprehension Of the terrible weight of his grief, Of His pain and its boundless extension, Whilst the Godhead refuses relief. Alone through long hours of sorrow, For no man would watch with Him one, And deaf are the ears of the Father To the agonized cries of the Son ! Alone \u2014 in His sorrow unsinning, He battled the sins of the earth : Was ever such strife and such winning ? For man such a death unto birth ? The moon waned 'mid the olives, and the light Grew darker as the folding wings of night Shed their cold shadows o'er the Christ that wept And the disciples who unconscious slept. The wolf crept from its cavern, and the bear"], [12, "8 Heard the lambs bleat, and softly left its lair ; The snake slept coiled beneath the cypress tree, Whilst God, their Father, watched those sleeping three. And thousands more His ever watchful eye Has guarded as the centuries rolled by.

The thief, the publican, the harlot, He Took by the hand, rebuked the Pharisee Who dared to claim at board a higher place Than the poor penitent who felt disgrace. Though sacred robe and priestly raiment shine, Though prayers are chanted at a gilded shrine, Though you come robed in righteousness and claim Succession back to Christ, through those whose name Recalls whole hecatombs of murders done In name of Father, Holy Ghost and Son,"], [13, "9 i You Cannot sit beside the marriage board Unless you wear the garments of the Lord, Who gives to halt and lame, to blind and poor From ditch and highway, desert, mountain, moor.

Nature, night's curtain, gathered round the head Of Christ's unmeasured agony and dread, Too piteous for the searching light of day. Say, will you turn His Passion to a play ? Well is it that through all things He will seek The willing spirit, though the flesh is weak ; Well is it that in all creeds He will find Some shadow of the love He left behind, Some small green leaves among the branches bare Some seeds of promise springing everywhere, Some lingering light that yet may brighter grow Like northern sunlight over northern snow. His pain, His agony, His bloody sweat Bring comfort to the suffering sinner yet."], [14, "10 THE BETRA YAL Hark. ! through the peaceful stillness of God's night Is heard the tramp of men, the torches' light Gleams 'mid the branches, and the nightingale Ends her soft song in one long frightened wail, A cloud moves o'er the moonlight, and a star Falls from the zenith ; in the hills afar The thunder mutters ; from the river's bed Creeps a cold air, like Death that leaves the dead ; The serpent, emblem of sin's hate of good Tightens its coils, and rears its speckled hood, Plies its forked tongue. Does Judas hear that hiss As he betrays his Master with a kiss ? Fair words ! foul deed ! \u2014 damned traitor, hide thy face, Lest the King blast thee from His holy place. Pause, madman, pause, ere for earth's filthy dross You help to nail earth's Saviour to the cross, And cast your soul eternally away For the base metal dug from baser clay. Have you no knowledge of your awful doom, The terror that shall make a self-sought tomb The only refuge from the fiend that makes Hell in the heart of him whom God forsakes ? Oh, ye who murder men for gold, and slay The innocent that chance to cross your way. Think upon Judas and his awful fate ; Pause and return before it be too late.

And you, ye hypocrites, who wear the face Of seeming service, whilst you dare to place Your own tradition betwixt God and man, Cast the first stone at Judas if you can. Ye Pharisees, whose text-embroidered dress Called down a curse from Him who came to bless; Ye scribes and elders, jostling in a race To force your sections in the foremost place ; Ye Sadducees, more gluttonous than swine, Who waste God's bread, grow drunken with His wine, \u2014 These are Christ's words, \" Ere you shall be for- given, The publicans and harlots enter heaven.\" No angry words those Christly lips defile ; The guileless suffers, but He conquers guile, And towers in His marv'llous majesty O'er foes that threaten and o'er friends that flee. \" Whom seek ye ? \u2014 Me, who never deigned to hide?\" And swords are sheathed and spears are turned aside. The traitor, the betrayed, stand face to face ; The God-Man fearless looks into the face Of Satan's slave : the serpent's deadly tooth Bruises His heel, as falsehood wounds the truth ; As truth o'er falsehood treads with mastering might,"], [16, "12 The serpent writhes and shrinks from human sight. **\" Who takes the sword must perish by the sword,\" These are the words of wisdom and the Lord. The scared disciples are a common type Of men whose manhood is not wholly ripe : Goodly in sunshine, but in danger's hour Leaving their posts to fly, and hide and cower ; Like Simon Peter, loving, fond, afraid, Swording a man, yet trembling when a maid Declared his fellowship with One whom late He swore to follow through all changing fate. 0 doubting soul, that loves, that dares not speak All that it feels because the flesh is weak, How oft at cockcrow do you wake to feel Small are your virtues and your faults are real ? THE TRIAL The morning breaks, the sunlight floods the earth In one red glory, and the day's new birth Is heralded by all the sounds that make Most music, when the world is just awake. Lambs bleat, birds sing, bright insects everywhere Spread their gay wings and sparkle through the air ; The silent fish now plunges for his prey And sombre pools are silvered with bright spray ; The fisher spreads his sail and o'er the town Blue smoke curls upwards, or slopes sideways down In eddying circles ; voices fill the air, And fife's great pulse once more throbs every- where ;"], [17, "13 Slowly at first, but ever gaining strength, Till Nature's vast machinery whirls at length, And teeming millions jostle in the strife Which ends in death or everlasting life. \" Judge not, lest ye be judged,\" the Christ has said Who now stands meekly before Justice dead ; Masked with religion, robed in priestly pride, Sits Caiaphas ; prejudged, the Christ is tried ; False witnesses are called ; blasphemers cry, \" The Son of David speaketh blasphemy.\" Now hands are raised to strike, and tongues with scorn Chide truth's translator, mock the Man, God-born, And vile intolerance rears its mitred head In all tradition's pride. The lamb is led From Caiaphas to Pilate, and the street Rings with the clash of arms, the tramp of feet, The soldier's oath, the money-changer's call, The shrill, sharp cry of children from the wall, The tramp of mules and asses, and the blare Of trumpets sounding in the public square. Oh, ye who have killed the prophets, And stoned the truth-speaking few, Why rush you to tempt retribution ? Why do you the things that you do ? The cedars of Lebanon tremble, The roses of Sharon blush red ; There is blood on the leaf and the blossom, But the roots and the fibres are dead."], [18, "14 The lilies are pale on the water, Where the pool rests the stream for a space Ere it rushes, like man to the slaughter, Down the crag's scarred and pitiless face ; Ere it roars in the madness of motion, Unchecked by the laws of control, Till it loses itself in the ocean, As man loses in darkness his soul. Is there soul in the brute population That shout their Hosannas one day And the next, at the priest's instigation, \" Away with this fellow \u2014 away ? \" Is there soul in the churches that totter 'Neath dogmas that paralyse youth, And give us but darkness and symbols Instead of the light and the truth ? In the full pomp of delegated power Sits Pontius Pilate, puppet of the hour, The man predestined by o'ermastering fate To aid hell's slaves and open heaven's gate. If Caiaphas be typical of all That bigotry which men religion call, Then Pilate is a type of most mankind, Not wholly bad, to truth not fully blind : Weak and self-seeking, wishing all to please, Forsaking justice for the love of ease, Doing wrong to please the many, fashion's slave, Swayed to and fro by each contending wave. To soothe the Jews, lest they should bring some lie"], [19, "15 To C\u00e6sar, Pilate caused the Christ to die. He washed his hands, whilst yet within his ear The voice of conscience sounded loud and clear. He washed his hands, though in his heart he knew That all the ocean could not wash false true. Ye suffering millions, through the marching years, Ye sons of men, that tread this vale of tears, When will ye learn the simple truth Christ taught , To live His life, accept your pardon, bought one great sacrifice for all the sin That makes so sad the world that we live in, Which makes earth's Eden barren as the strand Of a dead sea, land-locked by leagues of sand ? Oh, watch and pray, then listen for His voice, Which some day still shall make the earth rejoice. Conscience is God, who pleadeth still with man, And has been pleading since the world began ; The thunder fails to still that silent sound, Earth's lightenings from its greater light rebound, The deep - mouthed ocean roars, the whirlpool spins, Fathoms fold fathoms as sins circle sins ; The earthquake shakes the mountains and they fall, Yet God's own voice is heard amongst it all ; And His own Son stands ready at your side , Asking one gift from man \u2014 his human pride- Pride in his knowledge of things good and ill ; Pride in his strength, his intellect, his will ; Pride in his beauty, for he cannot see, Sin's scars have marred his seeming deity ;"], [20, "16 Pride in his church, his sect, his long descent, His seeming virtue, and his discontent Of other's sins, not matching with his own ; The pride that hurled from his celestial throne, In old times, Lucifer, the morning light, Man must resign ere heaven meet his sight. Though scourged with cords, and struck with palm and rod, In golden silence stands the Son of God. The rage of bigots, and the soldier's jeer, Call forth no angry word, no sign of fear ; To priest and Pilate comes the answer mild, \" I am no earthly King, but Heaven's Child.\" And then in silence such as fills the world, Before the tempest's thunderbolt is hurled, The Christ to Herod's judgment-seat is borne : A rose of Sharon crowned with piercing thorn, \u2014 A lily buffeted by winds that smite, \u2014 'Mid human darkness, everlasting light. Light of the world, when will Thy glory spread Through the thick night of Christendom half dead? When shall we hear Thy voice repeat the word The simple woman of Samaria heard ? When will the churches work with holy ruth ? Leave form for spirit, fallacy for truth ? Leave man free passage to the Saviour's breast, Who bids men come to Him and be at rest ?

Earth is but hell, man-made, if Christ be dead : His blood, not in your hearts, is on your head. Weep for the weary world weighed down by grief Weep for the thousands who find no relief ; Weep for the sins which, like volcanic dust, Cover all fair things with its cankering crust. The bright-haired girl, the silver-bearded sage, The histories of the past and present age, The grand old creeds, debased from symbols wise To stone-hewn monsters, steeped in vice and lies. O'er all and each the deadly poison falls, Through convent windows and monastic walls, Covering the crowded corners of the street, Where noisy ranters scatter tares and wheat ; O'er modern Bethels and on ancient shrine It falls and mingles with the bread and wine. Sin wraps the world, and poisons every part, And finds its dwelling in each human heart, Followed by death and darkness, and thick blight,"], [23, "19 Change and despair, and everlasting night ; But out of midnight stars celestial rise ; Christ conquers death, and death in conquering dies. THE CROSS The earth heaves and the mountains bow their heads, The deep dark seas are shaken in their beds, And windless waves are washed against the shore, And mighty rocks fall mingling with their roar. Blackness and earthquake, and the shades of death, Mingle in darkness, angels hold their breath ; Through awful silence rolls the thunder peal, The lightnings flash, like bright blue swords of steel, Where clouds of vapour, thicker than the night, Hide noonday sun, which dies in blood-red light, And through the darkness comes that one strange cry, \" My God, My God, why hast Thou passed Me by?\" The thunders answer, and the clouds are drawn Round those who wag their heads, and laugh in scorn. Through desolation and approaching gloom, Upon the very threshold of the tomb, The thief receives the blessed answer given To all who, late, still breathe a prayer to Heaven. The Christ lies slain ; the mocking crowds have passed ; The scared disciples gather round at last ; The thorny crown is lifted from the brow ; Mockery and scorn have done their vilest now"], [24, "20 Hate has accomplished all that hate can do ; The side is torn, the bleeding hands pierced through ; Love lifts from hate, with woman's tender touch, The broken body that has borne so much. Rejoice, bowed hearts ! ye mourners, cease to weep! He is not dead ; God gives His chosen sleep. Oh ! blessed sleep ! that promises to all A new awakening when the Christ shall call ; But awful slumber ! from which none arise To roam the universe or wing the skies To learn the wonders of eternal spheres, And count the ages as men count the years ; To feel the splendour of each noble thought That Christ and Christianity have taught, Unmarred by human weakness, and the stain Of sin that struggles from the earth in vain, \u2014 Of sin that mars the best of all we know, Like blood-stains sprinkled on the purest snow ; Like autumn's rust upon the summer leaf, All earthly joys are tinged by earthly grief. Man born in sin can never Christless rise From earth's wild hell to mansions in the skies : As well might Lucifer essay to gain His forfeit throne, and with God's Son to reign, As man demand an entrance into Heaven, If not by Christ redeemed, by Christ forgiven.

From peak to peak, the golden morning's ray Proclaims the splendour of that mighty day, Proclaims to you, my brothers, that this world, Where all is suffering, all is cramped and furled, Narrowed, and bound, and stained by cankering rust, Ashes on ashes piled, and dust on dust, \u2014 That there is yet another life for all Beyond the bitter wormwood, and the gall, The poisoned chalice, and the maddening vice, That enters and destroys earth's paradise, Turns love to lust, to murder, sacrifice, Religion into tyranny and strife ; That kills its own and takes its brother's life, Turns woman, with her angel eyes and face, Into a byword, and a foul disgrace ; Turns you, my fellows, once of godlike mould, Into one howling pack, that fight for gold ; Makes beasts of kings, of counsellors vain fools, Changes the preachers into devil's tools ; Brings foul diseases, plagues and famines dire, And wraps the world in hell's eternal fire. From hell, from death, the risen Christ can save The vilest sinner and the lowest slave, Who drags his self-forged chains from year to year In bloody sweat and agony of fear.

Ah ! e'en in this world dimly we may see The shadow of the glory yet to be ; Where evil is not, and where sin is past, And perfect peace reigns in the heart at last, \u2014 That peace which passes all our human ken, Eclipsing all the Heavens man-made by men ; The peaceful trust with which young children go To see whate'er their father wills to show. May this be yours, my brothers, sisters, foes, When o'er your heads the still dark waters close ; May this be yours when in the eventide You lay the broken staff of life aside, And pass forever where eternal light Reveals the universe \u2014 creation's might, \u2014 The glory of the Heavens, and the earth, Rejoicing in the splendour of New Birth."], [27, "23 Resurgam !

Leave the base, and take the noble, Shun the false, and hold the true ; May the Spirit of your Saviour Ever guide and strengthen you. Death is but a golden stairway Leading from this world of strife To the everlasting splendour Of a never-ending life. When you see yon snow-clad mountains, Sunsets radiant, bright and fair, Think that midst the golden glory I am waiting for you there. Part and parcel of the splendour Which makes colour light and form, Rolls the stars and stirs the ocean, Stills the wave and rides the storm. Death is dead, and I immortal, Think of this when thou shalt weep O'er my fever-wasted body ; Sleep is rest \u2014 and death is sleep. RECONCILIA TION Why should we sever when peace and goodwill Are sung by the angels in heaven above, And the vows that we plighted are binding us still In the sight of the world and the God Who is Love?"], [36, "32 Why will you cling to the blots in Life's story, Instead of returning to sweet days of old, When Love crowned us both with a radiance of glory, And bound our two lives in a circlet of gold ? When I gaze on the children, whose beautiful faces Are fit by the sunshine of days that are dead, And think how your life with my own interlaces In spite of all wrongs and the tears we have shed : I see in a vision a future still brighten With interests more binding than those that we broke \u2014 If for them we bear burdens their burdens to lighten, And bow our heads to the weight of the yoke \u2014 For them we should bury each angry emotion, For them we should cling to each other through all; And into the depths of the fathomless ocean Of Love cast the wormwood and empty the gall. For them, give your hand once again to my keep- ing, And my heart shall be kept for the children and you; And if we can save their young eyes from weeping, We have done one good thing God would have us to do. .^"], [37, ""], [38, ""], [39, ""], [40, ""]]
