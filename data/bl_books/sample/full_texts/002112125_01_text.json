The anxiety of the public is so great for aid in viewing the objects, that this edition is issued as early as possible, but necessarily imperfect in the above respect, and also in the asterisk (*) not having been affixed to many of the articles intended for sale. All such articles are, however, ticketed \"for sale\" at the Rooms, and their respective prices may be learnt from the Superintendent.
