In sending forth to the world this dramatic version of the beautiful German tale \" Ekkehard,\" it seems necessary to append a few remarks explanatory of the more important deviations from the original which I have seen fit to make. Indeed, I am not sure that, since it differs in such essential par ticulars, I am correct in calling this tragedy a dramatic version of the work on which I have drawn for the plot and most of the characters, for I have not only completely changed the latter part of the plot, but have also substituted for the heroine a person of an entirely different character, although called by the same name and holding the same position in the play as in the original story."], [10, "PREFACE. VI The main incidents up to the time of the catas trophe in the chapel, and the scene between Praxe dis and Rudimann which follows, are for the most part the same as in Herr Scheffel's artistic work ; but I have introduced, and mixed with these, some scenes which do not appear there at all. In some parts, especiaUy at the beginning, and as far as the secondary characters are concerned, I have frequently given merely a poetical transcript of the original prose. But further on, where the plot develops and changes, I have ventured to give a different turn to the story. As regards the alteration in the plot, it wall be obvious to all who are acquainted with the original work that it was necessary for dramatic purposes to invent a final culminating point of interest, such as Ekkehard's flight and supposed subsequent career in the romance do not supply. A final climax would of course be necessary in any drama, even were the event not tragic ; but things having arrived at the stage at which we find them in the chapel, it would seem improbable that the culminating point, which must quickly follow, could be any other than tragic. If, in a novel, Ekkehard could be cured of his"], [11, "PREFA CE. VII unhappy passion, or if the result could be left in doubt, it would be scarcely possible that any play which comprehended the chapel scene could end in this way. Thus the changes I have made in this respect will be more easily understood by lovers of the original than the transformation of Hadwig into the Hadviga of my tragedy. I hope, how ever, without endeavouring to wean these lovers from their affection for the Hadwig they have hitherto known, to win them to my view of the impossibility of portraying in a tragedy any one so abominably cruel as she is, in one or more than one particular, without making her a criminal of a much deeper dye than even Herr Scheffel presents her. Whether, in real life, a woman, for the most part, estimable \u2014 that is to say, a Princess ruling her subjects with gentleness in a hard and cruel age, protecting the oppressed, avenging the wrongs of the most obscure amongst them, looking per sonally after her people's interests, to the end that they should prosper and be happy ; a Princess to whom those who were in trouble came fearlessly for help as to a mother, who rejoiced in their rejoicings, attended their weddings, and even"], [12, "PREFACE. VIII forwarded their wooings \u2014 could deliver her pet bird to a fierce cat, or the man who loved her to cruel and remorseless foes, may or may not be considered probable. For it must be observed that such abandonment was not neces sary for the saving of appearances, if even this could have been any excuse. It will be remem bered, too, that she had previously, and more than once, when a much less important object was in view, asserted her sovereign rights over abbot and monastery ; and she could equally have done so in the chapel ; she could have claimed Ekke hard as her prisoner, and herself have pro nounced his sentence, whether banishment or any other. This would have cleared her of complicity, and have placed her above suspicion. But it is evident the author of \" Ekkehard \" intended her to be utterly heartless and cruel, for not only is he quite indifferent to the improbability of monks of a different order punishing and arresting a monk whose own convent and fraternity were within reach, but he has by the most subtle and artistic touches throughout, and at every point of the story, stamped Hadwig as unmistakably cold, cruel, and heartless. It is not, however, here"], [13, "PREFA CE. IX a question as to whether this was compatible with the gentleness and beneficence of her rule; I merely lay stress upon it to show the necessity in a tragedy of pronouncing her character much more decidedly one way or the other. I must, however, leave both my hero and my heroine, with their respective shortcomings, to the judgment of my readers, whom I do not think it will be necessary to trouble with explanations of the alterations I have made in minor characters or scenes. Although my work, differing as it does so widely in important particulars from Herr Scheffel's, will doubtless be judged from an entirely different standpoint, I cannot but feel that those who know the original will be the most competent to appreciate and to award the just measure of praise or blame. Thus, then, I cast my book upon the waters, trusting that the waves will be gentle, though not more gentle than it deserves, with the cherished work of one to whom it has been a labour of love.

The wisdom you have culled From history and many learned books May prompt you to unfold some subtle help In this our hour of need. Rat. Most reverend Father, since 'tis your desire To seek some aid from history, I recall An instance notable, and like in point To this which now befalls. Our Emperor, The great and glorious Charlemagne, once demanded Admittance to this holy monastery. It was, as we well know, against the rules To grant him entrance.

Ek. Most reverend Father, with all due respect To you and those around me, here meseems Is no necessity for ancient learning (To which, indeed, in me it were presumption To set up claim), but merely, as I think, the wit To reconcile necessity with law.
