During the restoration of the grand old Parish Church, he, as a student of architecture, was much interested in the work, and took notes from conversations with Mr. Snelgrove (Sir G. G. Scott's clerk of the works) and other gentlemen, and, by the kind permission of the Rev. Canon Powell, made several measurements and sketches of the Church. It then became evident to him that there was much to be added to the accounts of Rudder and subsequent writers, and he was confirmed in this in searching for information relative to the benefactors' escutcheons on the nave columns, which his father had been engaged to pick out in their true heraldic colours, and in examining the Calendars of the Public Records in the Cirencester Library. Circumstances, however, would not permit a further prosecu tion of historical research at that time, and the work was relinquished sine die. No opportunity of renewing it occurred until 1880, when after a diligent study of several of the Public Records and Books in the British Museum, he was surprised to find that so much might be written, and resolved to publish the information he had obtained. The task then begun has been one of pleasure, though frequently delayed by special business duties, and it should here be stated that as the first part of the work was printed in 1883,"], [14, "PREFACE. II it has been rendered necessary to make some trivial corrections to bring the work up to date (see Errata). Late and prolonged hours are not favourable to elegance of diction, and the author craves the indulgence of his readers both in the matter of composition and in the map and drawings he has made. The drawings of the old town and the tesselated pavements are chiefly from original sketches by the author's father \u2014 the views of the College and Alfred's Hall are copied from photos by Messrs. Henry Taunt and Co., of Oxford. No trouble has been spared in seeking to arrive at correct conclusions, but it is not of course asserted that these have invariably been reached, for that would be impossible from scattered and scanty materials, in themselves not always reliable. The Map of the Streets of Corinium is the first that has been attempted, and the author in endeavouring to record the site of Roman Remains and the probable lines of wall and streets, has only very partial information to depend upon, but that information might be increased by diligent enquiry, and it is hoped that it may lead to many sites being recorded which would otherwise soon be forgotten. The positions of some of the streets are accurately determined, as referred to in the letterpress, but the positions of others are only suggested by the discovery of Roman foundations and the well known rectangular character of Roman cities. The line of the wall is undoubtedly nearly if not abso lutely correct. In submitting the plan of the Abbey Church and its site, the author is aware that he has laid himself open to controversy. His views on the Roman invasion and settlement under Plautius and Vespasian are in accord with those of nearly all writers, but only partially so with those of a Gloucestershire gentleman, who has made the subject his study, and whilst strongly supporting the view that Corinium was the first town occupied by the Romans, considers that they landed near Southampton and marched hither by the Ermine way. He has to tender his grateful acknowledgments to the Marquis of Bath, for permission to introduce extracts from the"], [15, "PREFACE. III Abbey Cartulary in his library, at Longleat, and to Earl Bathurst for applying for his consent ; to the Rev.

Davis, Esq., for proofs of his work on the Gloucestershire Brasses ; and to Christopher Bowly, Esq., the Rev. J. J. Brown, and other gentlemen, who have aided in procuring materials. He has further to acknowledge the assistance of some works of living or lately deceased writers, which have, however, been made in the references in the work. The extracts from these works have been but few, but they include some from the Rev. E. A. Fuller's History of the Church, Roman Art in Corinium, Mr. Stratford's Good and Great Men of Gloucestershire, and other local records. It has been asserted that County Histories are little better than Parish Registers. Such a statement cannot apply to Cirencester, where so many events of national importance have occurred ; but it must be admitted that there is a great tendency amongst many whose inclinations have induced in them a spirit of local research to study the past for the sake of the past, and to allow their admiration for medi\u00e6valism to eclipse their interest iu modern progress and modern institutions. The object of all science \u2014 arch\u00e6ology not excepted \u2014 should be to impart knowledge of a beneficial character ; and so far as a work of this kind will permit, it has been sought to make it instructive, and to set forth the superior comforts and advantages of the present, and the causes which have led to the establishment of our Civil and Religious Liberty and our improved social well-being. Sincere sympathy is expressed for every movement with this end, whilst endeavouring to avoid offence to the political or religious convictions of any.

IP^lRT I. INTRODUCTORY. THE town of Cirencester is situated in the south-eastern part of the county of Gloucester (bordering on Wilts), in lat. 51\u00b043' N., long. 1\u00b058' W., and is distant by road 90 miles from the Metropolis, 34 . miles from Oxford, 33 from Bath, 38 from Bristol, 16 from Cheltenham, and 17 from the county capital; each of these distances, however, being exceeded by the existing railway routes. The Cotswold1 Hills, which extend throughout the whole of East Gloucestershire, and form a watershed to the Severn, the Warwickshire Avon, and the Thames,1 are lost a few miles to the southward in the valley of the last mentioned river, and Cirencester, situated on the confines of this extensive upland district, has from its importance received the appellation of the \"Capital of the Cotswolds.\" The town is watered by the little river Churn,1 which rising at the Seven Springs, in the parish of Cubberley, near Cheltenham, flows through it in two separate channels, and joins the Thames at Cricklade ; and it is from this stream that the name Cirencester is considered to be derived. For prior to the Roman invasion under Julius C\u00e6sar, the native inhabitants are supposed to have here formed a settlement or \"town,\" to which they had given the name of C\u00e6r-ceri, C\u00e6r-cori, or C\u00e6r-coryn. C\u00e6r3 and Coryn are both British words, the former signifying an enclosed settle ment, town, or fortified place ; the latter (Coryn) the top or highest part, correctly applied to the Churn as the highest source of the Thames. After the settlement of the Romans in Britain, C\u00e6r-Coryn (or the town on the Churn) became one of their cities, and its name was Latinised into Corinium, or Duro-Corinium. 1 See remarks on Cotswold Hills, Churn, &c. 2 Several Welsh towns retain the prefix C\u00e6r, as Caernarvon, Car marthen, C\u00e6rgybi (Holyhead), &c."], [26, "4 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. It is called Corinium by Ravennas, which, like Deva (Chester) and some other examples, is the Latin name of the river upon which it is situated. Ptolemy describes it as \" Polis Corinion,\" signifying in Greek the city of the Churn ; and Antoninus, in his Itinerary, Duro-Cornovium, evidently intended for Duro-Corinium, as Cornovium in the same work refers to Conway in North Wales. Duro-Corinium is equivalent in signification to the British term Dwfr-Coryn, meaning Churn water. Leland and modern historians generally follow Ravennas in calling the town Corinium. Under the Saxons it followed the usual change in nomenclature by the conversion of the British term \" C\u00e6r \" into the Saxon \"Ceastre,\" a word of precisely equivalent import. Thus C\u00e6r-coryn became Coryn-ceastre, afterwards corrupted into Cyrenceastre (and by some writers into Cearn-ceastre and Churne-ceastre), since modernized into Cirencester. Very little is known of Britain of a reliable character prior to the invasion of Julius C\u00e6sar. According to certain medi\u00e6val writers,1 one Brutus landed in the island with a number of followers, and built London twelve centuries before the Nativity of our Lord ; subsequently, Bladud, one of his successors, is said to have built Bath ; Lear, Leicester ; and other equally doubtful personages, York, Canterbury, Win chester, &c. The author of the Sloane MS.2 (No. 4206 in the British Museum), writing of Cirencester, says that Dunwallon (or Dunwallo) made \" ye foure great wayes of Engleine \" which \" do meet at ys towne.\" According to the celebrated John Milton's3 history of Early Britain as deduced from Geoffrey of Monmouth, &c, this Dunwallo about A.M. 3530 (or 474 years before the Christian era) reduced the whole island into a monarchy, and was the first British ruler to wear a crown of gold, and therefore by some reputed to be the first king. Milton also refers to the formation of the great highways \" since attributed to the Romans,\" but ascribes them, as well as the erection of certain cities, to Belins or Belinus the son of Dunwallo, of whom Geoffrey of Monmouth writes that he \"made a highway from Cornwall to Caithness,\" and another, crossing it at Cirencester, \" from S. David's to Hamo's Port \" or Southampton ; and were such accounts to be depended upon, we might be disposed to assign the foundation of C\u00e6r-coryn to this early period, and to assume that from its position at the intersection of these two great highways in the island it must have soon become a place of great importance and fitted to be the capital (as it appears indeed 1 See Ancient Register of Malmesbury. Cap. 4. Ed. Rev. J. S. Brewer. 2 An anonymus publication probably in the reign of Elizabeth. 3 Milton does not attach much credence to these accounts. Geoffrey of Monmouth, a very unreliable historian of the 12th century."], [27, "5 MEMOR.ABLE EVENTS. to have subsequently been) of a large tribe like the Dobuni (or Boduni),1 who inhabited a district comprising Gloucestershire east of the Severn, the greater part of Oxfordshire, and probably some portions of Wilts, Worcester, and Warwick. It is almost needless, however, to observe (whilst we do not deny the existence of certain British tracks or rudely formed highways) that these statements are not deserving of serious consideration. Julius C\u00e6sar invaded England, 55 B.C., and again the following year, and is perhaps no less remarkable for his reliability as an historian than for his success as a general, and he has left us a very explicit account of the inhabitants so far as his observation and means of acquiring information extended. He tells us that Britain was in his time peopled by certain tribes of Belgic and Celtic origin, who had come over from Gaul at different periods, and that those occupying the sea-board of Kent were more civilized than those in the interior. C\u00e6sar advanced to the town of Cassibelaunus, who had been chosen the leader of the native forces, and judging from his description of it, and those of other classical writers, it would appear to have consisted of a number of mud huts, the framework* of which would be constructed of rough timbers and branches of trees with rushes or long grass wattled together. This place, supposed to be on the site of Verulamium and near the modern St. Albans, was situated in a thick wood ; and although it does not follow that all of their towns were so placed, the surrounding ditch and rampart were undoubtedly common to all.2 Of such a description we may naturally assume was the ancient C\u00e6r-coryn ; and as the Britons retreated to their towns with their cattle, in case of expected attack, perhaps few spots could have been better chosen, since it adds to the advantage of well watered pasturage, that of a thoroughly sheltered position, being surrounded by rising ground on every side except at the narrow vale through which the Churn passes. 1 Corinium is indisputably admitted to have been the capital of the Dobuni by all writers. Leland (Itinerary v. 9, p. 32) writes, \" Eorum vero (i.e., Dobunorum) prima civitas suit Corinium, a Corinio fluvio vicino appellato.\" Mr. Black, however, at the Arch\u00e6ological Congress in 1868, chose to consider North Cerney as the site of the Corinium of Ptolemy. 2 \" Oppidum autem Britanni vocant quum silvas impeditas vallo atque fossa munierunt,\" Lib. 5, i. 17 ; i.e., but the Britons after that they have enclosed their thick woods with a rampart and ditch call it a town. Xiphilin, speaking of the Mertae or inhabitants of Sutherlandshire, asserts that they had neither walls nor cities, and Strabo that the British cities were merely groves. ,\u00bb\u25a0,,, \u25a0, Mr. Brewer (author of Beauties of England and Wales) considers, however, that C\u00e6sar's remarks are applicable to low-lying, and not to mountainous districts, which contain several instances of British castrame tation. See also Pictorial History, P- 99 and 100."], [28, "6 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. The writer of the Pictorial History considers that the early Britons resembled the Cingalese at the commencement of the present century both in their towns and manner of fighting. Their skilfully constructed war chariots show that they were more skilled in the mechanical arts than many of the modern savages with whom they have not unfrequently been compared. They were divided into numerous petty tribes, and were almost continually at war with each other ; all their youth except those who belonged to the Druid or priestly caste being trained to the use of arms. They held the Druids in great veneration, and whilst agriculture and to a certain extent trade and manufacture were not unknown, they depended principally for their support on hunting and fishing, painting their bodies with woad or clothing themselves with the skins of the animals taken in the chase. After the departure of Julius C\u00e6sar, who was more a discoverer than a conquerer, and who did not penetrate within 70 miles of this town, the Britons remained undisturbed for nearly a century ; and during this period it is certain that many of their leading men must have obtained a knowledge of the arts of Roman civilization, Including even that of coinage. In the year 43 of our era, the Emperor Claudius, at the instigation of one Bericus, a British outlaw, instructed Aulus Plautius, who was then prosecuting a campaign in Gaul, to invade the island with the intention of making it a Roman province.1 Plautius being reinforced with an army of German infantry under Vespasian (the future emperor of Rome), landed with a force estimated by one historian at not less than 50,000 men. These generals experienced great difficulty in persuading their legions to under time the voyage, and adverse winds having compelled them to put back into port, discontent had arisen among them, and consequently the Britons, although conscious of their inability to cope with so powerful an army, cherished the hope that they might wear them out with delay, and that, like Julius C\u00e6sar, they might be induced to abandon the attempt. Accordingly, deserting those districts through which, after landing in Kent, the Roman army would be likely to march, they crossed the Thames, and concealed themselves under the leadership of Cataratacus (or Caractacus) and Togodumnus, sons of Cunobelin, king of the Trinobautes. Plautius consequently marched a long way into the interior, probably through Kent and Surrey, and into Berkshire, without meeting with any formidable resistance, but eventually encountered Caractacus and then Togodumnus, both of whom were defeated and compelled to take refuge in flight. This struck such terror into the inhabitants that a portion of the Boduni (or Dobuni) submitted to the Roman arms, and it is not improbable that these victories of Plautius 1 Dion Cassius \u2014 Suetonius,"], [29, "7 MEMOR.ABLE EVENTS. have given rise to the extraordinary and exaggerated statement (quoted in a previous history of Cirencester and attributed to a certain Ostorius) that the \" third battle which C\u00e6sar had with Brittas was near the rivfsr which men call Thamese, near those fords which are called Wallingford, after which not only all the inhabitants of Cirenceaster submitted but the whole island.\" It is by no means improbable (indeed there is the greatest probability) that the battle with Togodumnus was fought in the neighbourhood of Wallingford. The Trinobautes (who occupied Essex, Middlesex, and East Herts) and the adjacent tribe of the Catticuchlani (who inhabited West Herts, Bedford, part of Northampton, Bucks, and probably part of Oxford) were very powerful, and the foremost in their opposition to the invaders. The Dobuni, who were located between the Catticuchlani and the Silures (or people inhabiting South Wales and probably the Forest of Dean), were likewise a powerful people, but had previously suffered at the hands of the Catticuchlani. All were, however, united with the tribes who had joined them from the southern side of the Thames in defending their homes and hearths, and it may readily be understood that they would keep along the north bank of the river until a favourable opportunity should present itself of engaging with the enemy. Probably the Romans attempted the passage of the river at Wallingford, and succeeding in this the Thames was no longer a barrier to their progress. They were then in the territory of the Dobuni, the inhabitants of which fled to their capital, C\u00e6r-coryn, whilst the other forces pressed forward and crossed the Severn by a secret ford (as is supposed at Newnham). Plautius and his lieutenant, Vespasian, followed along the banks of the Thames in hot pursuit, and arriving at C\u00e6r-coryn (at the head of the river) received the submission of the Dobuni as stated, and then, having left a garrison within the British \" city,\" continued their march after Caractacus and Togodumnus, who had posted themselves in a secure position, as they thought, on the opposite bank of the Severn. The Romans after considerable difficulty crossed the river and obtained a hard fought victory, in which Vespasian and Sabinus his brother took part. The Britons then retreated to the Nore (probably recrossing the Severn at Gloucester), and Plautius, after nearly coming to grief in the Essex marshes, awaited the arrival of Claudius, who during a brief stay of sixteen days took Camulodunum (Colchester), and returned to Rome to receive the honours of a triumph, leaving Plautius and Vespasian to prosecute the war and subjugate the inhabitants. These generals remained about six years longer, and during that period Plautius appears to have subdued the tribes to the north of the Thames, whilst his lieutenant fought thirty battles, took twenty towns, and subdued two powerful tribes (probably the Belg\u00e6 and the"], [30, "8 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. Damnonii),1 and extended the Roman conquests to the south coast and the Isle of Wight. Richard of Cirencester says that lie built Corinium, whilst Mr. Lysons asserts that Aulus Plautius held his court here and at Gloucester.. In the territory of the Belg\u00e6 were three important cities, now Bath, Ilchester, and Winchester; the Fosse way (or Akeman street, as this portion south of Cirencester is sometimes called) leads directly from it to the two first named towns, and thence to Exeter, in the territory of the Damnonii, whilst the Ermine street leads directly to the latter ; each of these places appear to have been included in Vespasian's conquests ; whilst the Ikenield street2 leads from Cirencester to London, St. Albans, Colchester, and the country of the Iceni, or the scene of Plautius' military exploits. It is therefore natural to assume that not only was Cirencester the first town occupied by flie Romans, but that it was the centre of the military operations and civil jurisdiction during the time of the first propr\u00e6tor? On the departure of Plautius and Vespasian, who received triumphal honours at Rome, the Silures and the unconquered tribes overran the districts that had submitted, and Ostorius Scapula, in the winter of a.d. 50, arrived to find affairs in a state of great confusion,4 but immediately set himself to repel the invaders and to prevent future inroads, and caused a line of forts to be established along the Cotswold Hills, overlooking the Severn from Bath to Tewkesbury, and thence on the banks of the Avon and Nen past Northampton to the Wash. In consequence of this the Iceni, who had voluntarily submitted to the Roman rule, and the northern portion of the Dobuni rebelled; the rising was subdued after a short but obstinate resistance, and Ostorius proceeded to extend his conquests beyond the line of forts. The Silures, however, who for a time were encouraged by the presence of Caractacus, still held out, and it was not until the propr\u00e6torship of Julius Frontinus (a.d. 75-78),5 more than twenty years after Ostorius had succumbed to the fatigue and anxieties of his office, that this brave and hardy people, the most determined of all the British tribes, was subdued. The complete line of camps along the Cotswold Hills and the remains of the Roman fortifications at Cirencester all confirm the scanty historical records that remain to us, and show that Ostorius and his successors adopted 1 Belg\u00e6 \u2014 Inhabitants of Hants, Wilts, and greater part of Somerset.

It was customary for taxes to be levied on behalf of the Imperial revenue on articles of general use, and bricks have been found bearing the letters P R A S I A T , supposed to be for Prasiatagus, and similar bricks with the letters A R V I R I , at and in the neighbourhood of Cirencester, supposed to be for Arviragus. Thus we have primd facie evidence that his jurisdiction extended over this district, and the beneficial influence he exerted will help to explain the favour with which the victors appear to have regarded it, as testified by the splendid remains of Roman art and work manship continually being discovered. Corinium during the time of Ostorius was the secure residence of the wives and families of the military men engaged at Gloucester and the Cotswold Camps, and after the subjugation of the Silures enjoyed unquestionably an almost unbroken era of tranquillity until the closing years of the Roman occupation, when the peace of the island was disturbed by adventurers ambitious of power, and by the subsequent raids of the Picts and Scots.

After the Roman legions had been withdrawn, the northern depredators overran the country almost to the south coast, and it is recorded that the Britons in their extremity sent Guitelinus (who is named as the Archbishop of London) to Aldroenus,_King of Britanny, who by his persuasive eloquence induced him to equip a fleet and to send therewith his brother Constantinus on condition that the latter should be acknowledged as their king. Guitelinus having given this guarantee, returned with Constantine at the head of a considerable force (a.d. 433), and landed at Totnes, in Devonshire. Numbers flocked to his standard, and soon they encountered the Scots, and according to some accounts gained a decisive victory and slew Guanius their leader ; the Scottish writers, however, whilst admitting that their king, whom they call Dongard, was slain, claimed the victory for his soldiers. Whatever may have been the precise result, Constantine reaches Cirencester,3 and is there crowned as king of England in the presence of a great council assembled for the purpose ; and in order we presume to give further evidence of their good faith he is presented by the assembled dignitaries with a spouse belonging to a noble family of Rome.

Constans had been placed (if we are to credit certain medi\u00e6v\u00a3il writers) in a monastery, when at the age of scarcely ten years he by his father's decease is invested with royalty, and the celebrated Vortigern is appointed as regent. This clever and designing man soon procured the crown for himself to the exclusion of Constans and his younger brothers, all of whom were mere children ; and Vortigern had recourse to the Jute brothers, Hengist and Horsa, to resist the Picts and Scots, and conferred upon them for their assistance the kingdom of Kent. Thus commenced the occupation of Britain by these tribes of German adventurers, who under the name of Jutes, Saxons, and Angles, disputed for nearly two centuries with the Britons for the possession of the southern part of the island, and eventually compelled them either to submit or to retreat into the mountain fastnesses of Wales and Cornwall. Hengist and his brother were followed by another adventurer, Ella, who in the year 477 settled on the south coast, and founded the kingdom of the Suth-seaxe, or South Saxons, nearly corres ponding in extent with the modern counties of Sussex and Surrey. Constans, whose inability to govern became palpable as he advanced to mature years, had returned to a monastic life, but in his brother Uther was found a man of very different stamp. In consequence of his bravery his fellow countrymen had made him their leader and conferred on him the title of Pendragon, and he appears to have effectually succeeded in resisting the progress of Ella and the landing of other invaders. His death occurred about A.D. 495, and upon this, the Saxons having invited others to come over, Cerdic landed and commenced the formation of that kingdom which, under the name of Wessex, comprised the whole of the Roman province of Britannia Prima (except the counties of Kent, Surrey, Sussex, and Cornwall), and whose king, Egbert, 330 years later formed the groundwork of the British monarchy. Cerdic met with a powerful opponent in the renowned king Arthur, son of Uther, who, although at the time of his father's death but a youth of some 15 years, yet if the accounts of him are true, he inherited in an even greater degree his father's courage and ability. It is said that he had already endeared himself to his countrymen by his promising qualities, and that he was in consequence crowned king by Dubricius, the Archbishop of C\u00e6r-Legion (C\u00e6rleon) and the other Bishops who had assembled with their metropolitan for the purpose in the presence of the leading men in the land at Cirencester, according to Alfred of Beverley and William of Worcester ; the former of whom writes \" in civitate Circestria ; \" the latter, \" Castrum aliud Grosmond est \u2014 ubi Arthurus rex coronabatur, prope capellam Sanct\u00e6 Cecili\u00e6, in altera parte occidentali vill\u00e6 Cyrencestri\u00e6,\" i.e., the other camp is Grosmond's, where King Arthur was B"], [34, "12 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. crowned, near the chapel of St. Cecilia in the western part of the town of Cirencester; whilst Robert of Gloucester says, \" Cylyceaster,\" which Mr. Hearne explains as Silchester. If Arthur be a real and not a mythical personage, Cirencester situated nearer the scene of most of his recorded exploits seems the more likely place. After effectually circumscribing the advancing power of Cerdic, Arthur enjoyed several years of comparative peace, but was at length slain in a mortal combat with a nephew (who had turned traitor) in the year 542, and was buried in Glastonbury Abbey, where a monument to his memory was said to have existed many centuries afterwards. Cerdic died eight years before Arthur, and was succeeded by Cynric his son, who gained a complete victory at Salisbury, and extended the West Saxon kingdom; the Britons, however, continued to hold the district round Cirencester and the counties of Gloucester and Somerset, whilst the whole of central England, which afterwards formed the Mercian kingdom, remained for several years in their undisputed possession. Cuthwin, the son of Cynric, about 560, secured temporary successes in Beds, Bucks, and Oxon, but Gloucestershire held out against his efforts until 577, when with his son Ceaulin he obtained a most decisive victory at Deorham (now Dyrham), near Chipping Sodbury, and the three British kings, Conmail, Con didan, and Farinmoil, fell in the battle. Cuthwin and Ceaulin then possessed themselves of the \" civitates,\" which had probably been the centres of their respective jurisdictions, namely Glewan ceaster, Cyrenceastre, and Acmanceastre (or Gloucester, Cirencester, and Bath).1 In spite of these reverses, which must have for the time extended the Saxon dominion to the banks of the Severn, the Britons seem to have been determined to sell their liberties as dearly as possible ; they soon regained possession of Cirencester, and opposed the Saxons with considerable success. Unfortunately for the Britons, they had chosen, about the year 581, one Careticus (or Keredic) as their leader, who is described as eminently unfitted for the position, being a man of a most fickle disposition, and a lover of civil war, who was better able to sow the seeds of dissension amongst his own followers than lead them to victory in a time of great difficulty. The Saxons perceived this, and seized the opportunity to make a decisive conquest of the territory they coveted, and to extinguish the dying embers of British independence. Accordingly, in the year 586, they invited to their assistance a certain Gurmund (or Gurmundus), described by some medi\u00e6val writers as \" King of 1 Saxon Chronicle ; Green's History of Worcester ; Gibbon's Decline and Fall of Roman Empire ; John Milton's History of England ; Holinshed's Chronicle ; Matthew of Westminster ; Henry of Huntingdon, &c, &c."], [35, "13 MEMOR.ABLE EVENTS. the Africans,\" but according to more credible accounts one of those Norwegian pirates who at these times for the sake of gain infested the coasts of the northern countries of Europe. This man is said, with the assistance of his brother Turgesius, to have made a raid on the Orkney isles and subdued them, and then to have scoured the seas, so that no nations durst appear within sight of him ; finally to have reached Ireland. The Saxons, on hearing of his successes, entered into a treaty with him, and Gurmund leaving Turgesius in Ireland arrived in Britain. Gurmund and the Saxons are said to have defeated Keredic (or Careticus) in several battles, compelling him to take refuge in Cirencester.1 They besieged the city, but it held out for a long time, and would not have been taken had not Gurmund (according to medi\u00e6val writers) resorted to the following stratagem, which we here append in the words of Holinshed. He- tied \"to the feet of sparrowes which hys people had caught certain clewes of thred or matches finely wrought and tempered ready to take fire so that the sparrows being suffered to go out of hand flew into the towne to lodge themselves within the nestes which they had made in stackes of come or eaves of houses, so that the towne was thereby set on fire, and then the Brytones issuing forth fought with their enemies,\" and were overcome and discomfited. This account of the taking of the town is probably legendary, but it is certain that Careticus was thoroughly routed, and fled beyond the Severn into Wales, followed by many of his countrymen, whilst others took refuge in Cornwall and the province of Brittany. Gurmund is said afterwards to have ravaged and desolated the country and burnt the cities and houses of the vanquished, and then to have departed, leaving the Saxons in undisputed possession of a wasted country. It is also affirmed that whilst at Cirencester he was met by Isembard, nephew of Louis, king of the Franks, who complained that he had been forcibly and unjustly expelled from the kingdom of Gaul by his uncle. Gurmund entered into a compact to assist him to regain his possessions, and the unprincipled Isembard, to please the heathen adventurer, is said to have thereupon renounced his profession of the Christian faith.2 After their defeat by Gurmund, the Britons appear to have given up their cause as hopeless, and the Saxons, satisfied with the fertile plains of England, do not appear to have deemed it desirable to contest with the vanquished the mountain fastnesses 1 Holinshed ; Geoffrey of Monmouth ; Ranulfus Cestrensis ; Matthew of Westminster ; Alured Beverlacensis ( Alured of Beverley) ; Robert of Gloucester ; Pierre de Langtoft (in old French verse) ; History of Cambria, translated from the Welsh by H.

The history of the succeeding age comprises that of the development of the kingdoms of the Saxon Heptarchy, and now the confiscators of the territory of a vanquished people, unable to agree as to the limits of their respective conquests, commenced to war amongst themselves. This was especially the case with the rival kingdoms of Wessex and Mercia. At the period of Gurmund's success the West Saxons had overrun an extent of country even greater than that which they eventually occupied, whilst that of Mercia, the last formed of the Heptarchic states, can scarcely be said to have had any existence, as Crida, its founder, with his Anglian followers, had only settled on the Lincolnshire coast the previous year ; and it remained for Penda (who extended his conquests so as to include the whole of central England, \u2014 from the southern boundaries of Lancashire and Yorkshire to the river Thames, and from the borders of Wales to East Anglia,) to make Mercia a powerful kingdom. In order to effect his purposes he appears to have endeavoured to inflame the minds of certain of the Britons with the sense of lost liberty, and thus entered into a compact with Ceadwalla, king of North Wales. Cirencester was situated at the extreme south of the extensive district afterwards comprising the Mercian kingdom, on the borders of Wessex. Probably Penda sought to annex it to his dominions. The West Saxons were unwilling to yield to Penda a place which, although at this time may have been little more than the site of an ancient city, yet retained in its walls and fortifications the elements of a valuable frontier stronghold, and in the year 628 Cynegils, their king, with his son Cwichelme, encountered the forces of Penda and Ceadwalla just outside its walls.1 In the words of a previous historian,2 \" the conflict was long and bloody. The Britons used the pike or javelin and the bow, according to the principles of Roman tactics, while the Saxons, armed with short swords, charged in one dense and generally irresistible column. Night alone separated the infuriated combatants, and, when the morning dawned, so dreadful was the scene of carnage that both armies were appalled, and as neither appeared to have the advantage, a treaty of peace was concluded,\" Cirencester remaining in the hands of the West Saxons. The rival kingdoms were on amicable terms for fifteen years, when Penda invaded Wessex, in consequence of Cenwulf, the son of Cynegils, repudiating his sister, whom Penda had expected that he would have married. Cenwulf was driven from his throne, and remained in exile three years. Penda died in 655, and Peada, his son (who is said to have been the first Christian King of Mercia), the year following 1 Saxon Chronicle ; Matthew of Westminster ; Henry of Huntingdon ; John Milton's Early Britain ; Strutt's Chronicle of England. 2 W.

He is said to have made one brother viceroy over Herefordshire, and another, Osric, over Gloucester, Worcester, and Warwick, which district was known for many years as the province of the Huicci or as Wiccia. This province was almost coincident with the ancient diocese of Worcester, and it would appear that Cirencester remained a portion of it,2 and consequently of the kingdom of Mercia, until the states of the Saxon Heptarchy were merged into the kingdom of England 200 years later. History is comparatively silent during that period, but what we have recorded points to a less turbulent state of things. Many of the Saxon kings had made a nominal or sincere profession of the Christian faith, and by degrees the altars of heathendom fell, and Christianity, which had some^centuries before been received by a large number of the Britons in a less corrupt form than that taught by Augustine, was fast becoming in its Augustinian character the accepted faith of the nation. Churches and monasteries were erected, frequently, it is thought, on the site of the Romano-British basilic\u00e6, which in the long period of civil war had either been destroyed or allowed to fall into ruin, or had been used for purposes of heathen worship. Literature occupied a place in the Saxon economy, and the names of Bede, Asser, and Alfred will always be remembered as promoters of learning. According to a Chronicle of Cirencester Abbey (in the possession of the late Rev. J. Collinson, of Long Ashton, near Bristol, in the year 1795), the Collegiate Church and Establish ment of Secular Canons was sounded here by Alwyn (possibly St. Alwyn, Bishop of Worcester) during the reign of Egbert, A.D. 828-836.3 The next recorded event connected with Cirencester occurs in the reign of the Great. During the time of this excellent monarch England was subjected to continual invasions from that race of sea-warriors who inhabited Denmark and Norway, and of whom our friend Gurmund, of three centuries earlier, was a prominent representative. Then the Saxons had sought his assistance, but now a successor (who by the similarity of his 1 Rudder\u2014 History of Cirencester, p. 9.

This man was Guthrum the Dane, who arriving on the sea-board of East Anglia, marched through Mercia into Wessex, A.D. 878, and wintered at Chippenham. Alfred was driven from his throne, and took refuge at the isle of Athelney, in Somersetshire, where it is said that he disguised himself as a shepherd, and committed the unfortunate mistake of leaving his mistress's cakes to burn whilst his thoughts were occupied on matters of state importance. At length, however, he gathered up his forces and engaged with the Danes at Ethandune (supposed to be Eddington, near Chippenham), and obtained a complete victory. Guthrum came to terms with Alfred, and it was arranged that he should attend Alfred's court with thirty of his followers three weeks later. Alfred entertained him for twelve days, and Guthrum having agreed to Alfred's terms, and having been baptised in the Christian faith, departed from Chippenham to Cirencester with his army.1 Here he remained a year,1 and he and his followers received instruction in the rites of the religion they had embraced, and then, according to the treaty entered into with Alfred, they departed for East Anglia, where they settled.1 Guthrum from this time remained the faithful friend of Alfred, who during the twelve or fourteen successive years of peace devoted himself to matters affecting the public weal. In the year 893, however, another formidable horde of Northmen, under the command of one H\u00e6stin or Hastings, sailed up the Thames, probably beyond London, and being joined by certain of the Danes in the island, marched through Mercia to the Severn.2 H\u00e6stin probably crossed the Thames into Oxon or Bucks, but may have kept along the southern bank to this town, and thence through Gloucestershire. However this may have been, the neighbourhood of Cirencester participated largely in the troubles caused by these determined invaders, but it is pro bable that the \" royal town \" of the Saxon kings was too well protected to suffer much from their depredations. The village of Danew&y, six miles to the west, tells its own tale ; the Danes would avoid fortified places like Cirencester ; we read, however, that in 905 a certain Ethelwald (a relative of the reigning monarch Edward) endeavoured to dispossess him, and with the help of the Danes marched from East Anglia (probably via the Ikenield way) to near Cirencester; crossed tlie Thames at Cricklade, and then returned home laden with spoils after having wasted 1 Saxon Chronicle ; Henry of Huntingdon ; Asser ; Holinshed ; Matthew of Westminster ; Roger de Hovedene ; Alured of Beverley \u2022 Milton's History of England ; Sharon Turner's History of Anglo Saxons ; Ralph Higden ; &c. 2 Sharon Turner ; John Milton."], [39, "17 MEMORiUBLE EVENTS. the country. They were subsequently defeated by Edward, who in 911 again overcame them in this county upon their return from a predatory excursion. It is probable that Edward the Elder built Cirencester Castle and strengthened the fortifications. _ Other instances might be adduced of the Danes being in this neighbourhood \u2014 we need mention but one, that of Canute, who in 1016, after he had received the submission of nearly all the south-western counties, marched up the Thames to Cricklade, crossed it into Mercia, and thence probably by the Ermine and Fosse Ways into Warwickshire, burning several cities and destroy ing the country as he went. There is extant a Charter of Confirmation of lands by King Edwy to the Church of Worcester, made at Cirencester in 956, signed by the king and witnessed by Bishops Odo, Elfsic, Tolsic, and Oswulf : the king's brother and successor, Edgar, described as \"regulus\" of Mercia, the celebrated Dunstan, described as \" Dunstan dogmatista,\" \" Alfwald didasculus,\" &c. In the reign of that weak and vacillating king, Ethelred the Unready (between the years 991 and 993), a synodal council was held at Cirencester,1 attended by all the nobles and ecclesiastical dignitaries of the time, at which a certain Alfric, the son of Elfere, duke of Mercia,2 who had dispossessed a widow of the name of Eadfled of her possessions, and acted the part of traitor to the king by aiding the Danish invaders, was outlawed, and his lands by universal decree granted to Ethelred. Ethelred restored the widow her property for life, and the reversion to the Monks of Abingdon. In the year 1020,3 the Danish king Canute held a general council or witenagemote at Cirencester during the Easter festivity, after he had returned from the Baltic, and on this occasion Duke Ethelword (or Ethelword the Ealdorman) and Edwy or Eadwig (described as king of the Ceorls or Churls) were both outlawed. Freeman says that these acts of severity were the last of the kind recorded on the part of Canute towards Englishmen, and that it must have been at the same \"gemote\" that a most important political step was taken in the appointment of another Englishman to the viceroyship of the most important .part of the kingdom, the district of Wessex, or to use his own words : \u2014 \" The last banishment of an Englishman by the Danish conqueror was accompanied by the exaltation of another to a place in the realm second only to royalty. It was not that Godwine received a title and office which no man had borne before, but which, 1 Charters of \u00c6thelred to the Monks of Abingdon in years 993 and 999, contained in Thorpe's Diplomatarium Anglicanum \u0152vi Saxonico, &c. 2 John Milton's History of Early Britain. 3 Sharon Turner's History Anglo Saxons ; Freeman's History Norman Conquest ; Roger de Hoveden ; Matthew of Westminster ; Le Livere des Rois de Britannie\u2014 Ancient MS. ; &c."], [40, "18 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. saving the few months of his banishment, he bore for the 32 remaining years of his life, the title and office of Earl of the West Saxons.\" He was succeeded in this office by his son Harold, who acquired thereby the influence which for nine months placed him on the throne of England. Holinshed (probably referring to this same \"gemote\" of 1020) writes that the first time the title Baron was used was in 1030, when Canute called his barons together to the Council at Cirencester. About three years after the death of Ethelred the Unready, Canute married his widow, Emma of Normandy. By her he had one son, Hardicanute (or Harthaknut), who at the death of his father (1036) was made king of Denmark, and on the death of his half-brother, Harold I. (1040), was chosen king of England. Emma had had two sons by her former husband, viz., Alfred the younger, who was slain about 1033, and Eadward (or Edward) sumamed the Confessor. Both these princes had been brought up in Normandy with their uncle, but had on several occasions put forth their claims to the English crown. Emma, however, always supported that of her second husband, and after his death of her son by him. This led to the most unnatural feelings between Edward and his mother, and when he succeeded Hardi canute, his first act after leaving his Witenagemote assembled in Gloucester (November, 1043) was to ride secretly and in haste through Cirencester,1 accompanied with the three great Earls of the realm, Godwine, Leofric, and Siward, to the residence of his mother at Winchester. Without any previous intimation they took possession of her lands, gold, jewels, and every other valuable she possessed, leaving her, however, just sufficient for her maintenance. It is said that after this Edward sought her life by impeachment, but this is considered to be an unwarranted statement, and we would rather believe that he was not guilty of such unnatural and disgraceful conduct. Edward married the daughter of Godwine, but had no children by her, and after his death Godwine's son Harold was chosen king. It is said that Edward had devised the crown to William duke of Normandy ; and no sooner was Harold on the throne than William arrived with a large number of retainers and soldiers, and the popular but unfortunate Harold was defeated and slain at Battle, near Hastings, Sept. 25, 1066. Edward's predilections would have induced him to introduce his Norman friends to the principal offices of church and state, had he not been deterred by prudence and by the expressed antipathy of his subjects. He did, however, choose Reinbald or 1 Mr. Freeman does not actually say that Edward rode through Cirencester, but the Ermine street (one of the four great highways of England at that time) leads from Gloucester directly through Cirencester to Winchester and Southampton."], [41, "19 MEMORABLE EVENTS. Regenbald as his Chancellor,1 and placed him over the Cirencester prebendal college.2 William in the early part of his reign made no attempt to conciliate the unfortunate Anglo Saxons, but by the exercise of the most tyrannical conduct reduced the whole of England in a comparatively short time under his absolute control, and filled every important place, secular and ecclesiastical, with his Norman adherents, at the same time presenting them with the lands and possessions of the conquered. Several towns were partially destroyed to make room for garrisoned castles, and the inhabitants subjected to a system of military surveillance. When William felt himself secure upon his throne, it is only fair to add that he somewhat relaxed his earlier measures. We have here no incident to record in connection with this town. William marched in this direction as far as Wallingford shortly after his victory at Hastings, then proceeded to London, and was absent most of the following year (1067) in Normandy, leaving Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, as his viceroy. Several slight attempts at insurrection were made and expressions of discontent exhibited during his absence, which William appears to have viewed with a somewhat unaccountable complacency. The affection for Harold's family was strong in Gloucestershire and the western counties, and it is supposed that it did not submit thoroughly to William until the year 1068, after he had put down the rising in Devon shire and taken Exeter, or within two years after the defeat and death of Harold. Reinbald and the church of Cirencester were confirmed in all their possessions by William, and one instance at least is on record in which this man was presented with the confiscated property of an unfortunate Saxon.3 It would be too much to assume that the influence of this Norman favourite was sufficient in this district to reassure the Conqueror upon reaching Wallingford that further progress was unnecessary in order to obtain an acknowledgment of his sway, but whether Cirencester readily accepted the new order of things or shared in the hatred of the more western parts of the country, it is certain that the early Norman kings appear to have looked with favour upon this town. We read of no acts of demolition in connection with it like at Dorchester, Chester, Leicester, Ipswich, and other places, where numerous houses were destroyed 1 Regenbald or Reinbald succeeded Leofric, the first holder of this office.

Stephen at this time was engaged in repelling a Scotch invasion, but returned in haste, leaving Thurstan, Archbishop of York, in charge of his army in the north, and was victorious over Robert, taking from him the castles and towns of which he had possessed himself.5 Cirencester castle was then either partially or entirely burnt or razed to the ground.6 Robert fled into France whilst Stephen was again engaged in the north, but he soon returned, and fresh efforts were made on behalf of Maud. Cirencester castle was rebuilt and garrisoned, and Stephen was utterly defeated and taken prisoner February 2nd, 1140-41, at the battle of Lincoln.7 Thence he was brought manacled to the empress (Maud) at Gloucester (where she was holding her court), and by her direction was taken on to Bristol and there confined in the castle. Maud, elated by her success, a few days after advanced to and occupied Cirencester,8 attended by a magnificent retinue consisting of nearly all the bishops, barons, and other dignitaries in the land who favoured her cause; thence she proceeded to Winchester and London, and was proclaimed sovereign. Her undisguised arrogance, coupled with her unwillingness to listen to any entreaties on behalf of Stephen, disgusted both her barons and the citizens of London, and she was compelled to seek safety in flight, and reached Oxford and Gloucester in disguise. In September, 1141, Earl Robert was taken prisoner, but shortly after was exchanged for Stephen. Great was the rejoicing, especially in London, upon the liberation of the king. Maud, at Oxford, however, garrisons or reinforces the garrison at Ciren cester,9 and strives to retain her power over the people whose 1 Freeman's Norman Conquest. 2 Domesday Book. 3 See account of Abbey. 4 Holinshed.

Stephen marches to Cirencester,1 and burns the place and its castle during the temporary absence of the garrison, and besieges the empress at Oxford.1 At this time Robert was on his way from Anjou (in France) with the young prince Henry, and having landed at Wareham Castle (Dorsetshire), marches at the head of a force direct to Cirencester,2 intending to give Stephen battle outside the walls of Oxford, but in the mean time the classic city is taken and Maud has fled to Wallingford, where (according to Holinshed) Robert met her. After this the war continued for some time with varying success, but the cause of the King eventually prevailed, and the death of the Earl put a final end to the hopes of the Empress. The castle of Cirencester was held for a considerable time by William de Dive, constable to the Earl of Leicester, on her behalf, but he finally surrendered it to the king after obtaining advantageous terms for his master.3 In the year 1152, Prince Henry having received intimation of certain harsh treatment to the Wallingfordians by Stephen, landed and besieged the royal garrison at Malmesbury, January 13, 1152-3. The king immediately marched (from London,) with a large army, and encamped at Cirencester one night,4 setting out the following day to relieve his garrison, but whilst on the road was overtaken by a fearful hurricane, and was compelled to retire, which enabled Henry to raise the siege and march to the relief of Wallingford. In a conference which ensued it was arranged between the two rivals that Stephen should enjoy the crown for life, and that Henry should be his successor. Stephen died the following year. There are no events of historical importance during the reign of Henry II., in connection with our town, except that it was honoured by the royal presence in 1176 at the dedication of the abbey,5 and again in 1188, when he was waited upon at his command by the monks of Canterbury in relation to a dispute of long standing between them and the Archbishop.13 The king, who had been instrumental in settling a previous difference, sought an amicable arrangement, but the prelate (who was also present) refused any intercourse with his subordinates, except that he held out the threat of excommuni cation.

I1 Richard I. increased the privileges of the abbey, and John continued these grants. In the first year of John's reign his Justiciars came to Cirencester2 and tried a case against Philip de Berinton, to show cause why he should not render service to the prior of Lanthony, and John's Itinerary shows that he personally visited the town five times during his reign (119 9- 1216). 3 The outrageous tyranny of this monarch rendered his rule intolerable, and after many expressions of discontent, and vain endeavours to induce him to govern with justice, his barons revolted, and having chosen Robert Fitzwalter as their leader, marched from Stamford to within 15 miles of Oxford (then John's headquarters). The king still refused to listen to their demands, whereupon they besieged Northampton and took Bedford, and were received by the liberty-loving inhabitants of London with acclamation. John was alarmed at the aspect of affairs, and used every influence to subdue the rising. According to Sir Robert Atkyns, he succeeded in raising an army in Cirencester.4 I find no mention of this in contemporary historians, but probably the statement is correct. The eastern districts of England were in the barons' possession, and John, whose movements were exceedingly rapid, was very busy in this neighbourhood undoubtedly seeking that end. He was in Mariborough February 7th (1215), Cirencester on the 8th, Marlborough again on the 9th, and Cirencester on the 10th, 11th, and 12 th. Thence he proceeded to Woodstock, probably to Oxford, and on the 19th was in Northampton. Subsequently he arrived in Windsor (according to Holinshed), \" with only seven horsemen,\" \u2014 \" though soone after,\" he goes on to say, \" he had a great power which came to him to the castell of Windsore where he then laie (probably the force referred to by Sir Robert Atkyns) and meant to have led the same against the lordes with all speed.\" John, however, durst not depart from Windsor, knowing that he was generally hated, and fearing that the other cities would follow London in supporting the barons. Consequently he submitted to them, and signed the Magna Charta on the plains of Runnymede, June the 9th, 1215. This was, however, but a ruse to gain time, for the unprincipled monarch was secretly drawing into his service foreign mercenaries, and in order to ignore the bond he had entered into he sought the help of the Pope (Innocent), who issued a bull annulling the deed and placing the kingdom under an Interdict. John had gained a victory, and with renewed confidence sets out again to raise forces in the country. Little more than three 1 Annals of Tewkesbury, sol. 10 (Luard's Annales Monastici). 2 \" Rotuli Curi\u00e6 Regis \" \u2014 Palgrave. 3 Itinerary of King John. 4 History of Gloucestershire."], [45, "MEMORABLE EVENTS. 23 weeks after signing the Great Charter he is again in Cirencester (July 7th and 8th, 1215), and his movements appear to have been attended with success. The barons were reduced to the extremity of seeking the help of the dauphin of France, who landed at Sandwich May 30, 1216, and took Rochester Castle, and marched to London. John had now to face a foreign foe, but lost no opportunity of marshalling his forces ; leaving Chip penham on the 30th of August he proceeds to Cirencester, and reaches Oxford September 3rd, thence by short marches he reaches Lynn, where a considerable force had assembled on his behalf. His turbulent reign was, however, soon to come to a close, for in an attempt to cross the Wash at low water the returning tide swept away nearly all his carriages, horses, baggage, and treasures. Mortified by this he was seized with a fever, and died four days after at Newark Castle, Notts. Henry III., his son, a lad of nine years, succeeded him, and was crowned October 28th (1216), and the Earl of Pembroke, his father's faithful friend, appointed regent. Louis still prosecuted the war. Cirencester castle had come into the possession of the barons since the visit of John a few weeks before, but the death of John and the presence of a foreign prince had given another aspect to the civil struggle, and the cause of the barons waned whilst that of the young monarch duly progressed. The castles of Marlborough, Cirencester, Winchester, and Farnham were taken and razed to the ground in order that they should not be \" kept againe by the enemie.\"1 Thus fell the castle of Cirencester, 1216-17, and there does not appear to have been any attempt made to rebuild it. After the death of the Earl of Pembroke, Hubert de Burgh was appointed regent. This man and Pandulph, the Pope's legate, both visited Cirencester in the year 1220.2 Henry III. proved a weak monarch, and his reign, which extended over a period of fifty-six years, is noteworthy for the continuance of the struggle between the monarch and his barons, who succeeded in establishing the nucleus of parliamentary government. Edward I., his son, proved himself a much more able king, but although he contended for the defence of the royal prerogative, was compelled to concede to the clergy and barons the rights they claimed, and to confirm the privileges they had obtained during the preceding reigns. 1 Holinshed ; Rudder's History of Cirencester. 2 Pandulph, at that time Bishop Elect of Norwich, stayed a fortnight or more at Cirencester, and several letters of his are extant, published amongst \" Royal and Historical Letters, temp.

Edward died in 1307, and his son, Edward II., was placed on the throne. He soon proved himself totally unfit for guiding the destinies of the nation, and provoked discontent by the selection of unworthy favourites, first in the person of Piers Gaveston, and then of Hugh de Spenser. The latter was a young man of considerable attainments, whilst his father had merited and acquired general respect, until Edward, regardless of all conse quences, not only gave the younger De Spenser his niece in marriage, but lavished \u2022 large possessions upon both, and dis possessed some . of his lords to do so. Led by the Earls of Hereford and Lancaster, many of the nobles fled to arms, and the De Spensers were banished. Edward, however, at length summoned up courage to insist upon their return, and made war upon the barons. Having taken the castle of Ledes, in Kent, and left his wife shut up in the tower, he sent out summonses to his barons to meet him at Cirencester at the feast of Christmas, 1321, and then departed from London, taking several baronial castles in the course of his march. At this time the Earl of Hereford held the Marches of Wales, which was a stronghold of the barons. The city of Gloucester was likewise in their hands, and might be considered the key to this extensive district. The king pressed on with an army daily increasing with his successes. Numbers of people had assembled in Cirencester from the vicinity in obedience to a royal mandate to render the king all necessary aid on his arrival, \" but in the meane time the lord Henrie de Ticis with certeine other that were entred into Glocestershire came thither and chased them home to their houses putting them in feare of their lives if they should offer \" resistance. The king reached Cricklade after the feast of \" Saint Lucie the Virgin,\" and then proceeded to Cirencester, where he celebrated the Christmas festivity according to the custom of the time.1 Here he was met by his two brothers, Thomas, the Earl Marshal, and Edmund, the Earl of Kent, also by the Earl of Pembroke, who had come forward to help him. The king was also accompanied with the Earl of Arundel (a relation of De Spenser), the Earl of Warren, the Earl of Richmond, and many others. Several of the nobility hearing of his success, resolved to submit to him, and trust to his clemency, and amongst others the two Roger Mor timers ; who were at Cirencester ordered to be sent to the Tower, contrary (it is said) to Edward's wishes, pending a decision as to their future. (They were subsequently banished.) The king's intention was to attack the barons in their stronghold in the 1 Compare accounts by Holinshed ; Thomas Walsingham, monk of St. Albans, \" Ypodigma Neustri\u0153 ; Chronicles Mon. of St. Albans ; Annales Edwardi II.

Welsh marches, and accordingly before leaving Cirencester he appointed Robertus le Ewer (otherwise Aquaric) as leader of his infantry, and Fules, the son of Warren, over the cavalry, and set out on his march on or about the 29th December, intending to cross the Severn as soon as possible ; but as Gloucester was firmly held by the barons, and he felt himself unequal to taking the city, he made his way towards Worcester. But again finding the river banks well watched by the barons' soldiers, he proceeded further, and eventually crossed at Bridgnorth. Edward reduced the barons to submission, and the De Spensers were reinstated in their former privileges, only, however, for about three years, for the pride, cruelty, and rapacity of the younger De Spenser caused a general revolt, headed by the Queen. Both favourites were executed, and finally Edward was put to death in Berkeley Castle, September 20, 1327, and buried at Gloucester by the monks of St. Peter's Abbey. Edward was succeeded by his son, Edward III., who reigned 50 years. At his death, in 1377, his grandson, Richard of Bordeaux, was placed on the throne, at that time only a youth of eleven years. As he reached maturity his incapacity for govern ment soon became apparent, for although naturally amiable he was weak, capricious, and irresolute, and raised wide-spread discontent by his arbitrary exactions. In the year 1399, whilst quelling an insurrection in Ireland, his relative, Henry, duke of Lancaster (who had been unjustly banished and his estates con fiscated and seized by Richard), landed in Yorkshire during the month of July. Henry's retinue of sixty men is said to have soon reached sixty thousand, and when Richard returned from Ireland he found himself in the midst of a discontented people, and was obliged to submit -to Henry's proposal to meet him at Flint (in North Wales), the result being that \"Richard, accom panied by his faithful friend, the Earl of Salisbury, was taken to London, where he renounced his claim to the throne. Henry was accordingly crowned King in Westminster Hall, September 30th following, and Richard was imprisoned in Pomfret Castle. Scarcely were these events accomplished than a plot was concocted by the Abbot of Westminster1 and others to reinstate Richard, and put Henry and his son to death. The Earls of Huntingdon, Kent, and Rutland and Lord de Spenser had in consequence of their sympathy with Richard been deprived of the higher titles conferred upon them by the last Parliament as Dukes of Exeter, Surrey, and Aumerle, and as Earl of Gloucester, and they readily gave their adherence to the abbot's plan, together with John Montacute, Earl of Salisbury, the Bishop of Carlisle, John Maudelen, chaplain to the late king, and some others. The accounts given by different writers somewhat vary as to the exact circumstances attending the attempted conspiracy, its discovery, 1 At this time Richard of Cirencester was a monk of Westminster."], [48, "26 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. and termination, so that without the means of ascertaining the precise truth we give here that which appears to be borne out by their united statements, and reserve quotations for the Appendix to this work. The conspirators being at Oxford had, it is said, invited the king and several of the nobility to a tournament, which, without suspicion, he had accepted. According to one account he was warned not to attend by a courtier whose suspicions were aroused, but it is likewise asserted that its discovery took place through the Earl of Rutland, when at dinner, allowing his father (the Duke of York) either by accident or design to see a counterpart of the deed of conspiracy which he had carried about with him concealed in his bosom. Rutland, without a moment's loss of time, saddled his horse and rode off to the king at Windsor, confessed, and secured the royal pardon. The others, finding all was discovered, determined at once on facing the danger, and accordingly left Oxford with a considerable body of men, marched to Windsor, intending to seize and despatch the king. Henry had, however, left for London, and the con spirators, after vainly seeking to swell their ranks from the people of the metropolis (who were almost without exception supporters of Henry), caused a report to be spread that Richard had escaped from Pomfret, and that Henry had fled to the Tower. The priest Maudelen, who closely resembled his former master, was dressed to personate him, and so trusting to this device they marched in a few days westwards to Cirencester, arriving there late one February evening in the year 1400, led, according to some accounts, by the three Earls, Huntingdon, Salisbury, and Kent, and by Lord de Spenser,1 although other writers imply that Salisbury and Kent only were present.1 Following those writers who represent Huntingdon and De Spenser as coming to Ciren cester, it is said that they and Maudelen took lodgings in one inn, and Kent and Salisbury in another, whilst their followers were encamped outside the walls. They appear to have been left undisturbed by the townspeople during the night and the follow ing day, and whilst Salisbury and De Spenser rode to Berkeley to seek help from its Earl, it is recorded that Huntingdon sought to impose on the townspeople with the report they had previously spread concerning Richard, stating that he was in their midst, ready to be proclaimed king at a favourable opportunity. Hun tingdon unquestionably hoped that a rising might take place on his behalf, but the sympathies of the inhabitants we.re with the reigning monarch.

The army outside, thinking that King Henry had arrived, was seized with a panic and fled, and whilst the besieged lords were valiantly defending themselves, the others took safety by scaling the walls, not being able to render the assistance they would fain have given to their unfortunate com rades. One of their party, however, a priest, hoping to divert the attention of the inhabitants, and to give the unfortunate Earls a chance of escape, set fire to several of the houses.1 This act, however, only enraged the townsmen, and caused them to press the siege more closely, and Kent and Salisbury were com pelled to surrender, beseeching that their lives might be spared so that they might personally see the king. This request would have been granted but for the act of incendiarism ; they were taken to the Abbey, and at sunset led forth and beheaded by those \" ale-drinkers,\" as Froissard calls the good people of our ancient town. The Earl of Kent received the ministrations and last rites of the Church, but Salisbury, whose sympathies were with the Lollards, and who had imbibed their principles, stead fastly refused them. The heads of the unfortunate men (both of whom appear to have been possessed of many good qualities) were sent by a \" varlet \" on horseback in two panniers to \" rejoice the king and the Londoners.\" De Spenser was captured and beheaded at Bristol, whilst Huntingdon, who had reached his house in Essex, with several others shared the same fate. The King, for the service done by the townsmen, granted them certain of the rebels' goods, and an annual grant of bucks and does from the forest of Braydon and wine from the port of Bristol, likewise compensation to certain of the inhabitants for expenses incurred, a court of staple for merchandize, and a charter of incorporation (see Appendix, account of Borough and Hundreds).2 There can be no question . that the accession of Henry was a step forward in the cause of popular liberty, but his persecution of the Lollards from a mistaken zeal will ever remain as a stain upon his character.

In the year 1434, Henry VI., then a youth of 13 years, held his court and remained for several days at Cirencester,1 attended by the Lord Cardinal of England, the Archbishops of York and Canterbury, the Duke of York (father of Edward IV), the Duke of Norfolk, Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, celebrated as the King Maker, and several other ecclesiastical and secular dignitaries. During their stay here a memorial was drawn up and read in the royal presence, couched in respectful but firm language, advising the young king that it was not desirable that he should (until he had arrived at years of maturity) undertake any public business without the advice and consent of the States Council. Maturer years, however, only demonstrated Henry's incapacity, and after the unpopular ascendancy of the Duke of Suffolk and Henry's beautiful queen, Margaret of Anjou, the public choice fell upon Richard, Duke of York, who was appointed regent. The king as yet had no children, and had he remained without issue, the duke (who had actually a greater hereditary claim to the throne as the descendant of Lionel, Duke of Clarence), would have been content to await his turn to succeed upon the king's decease. His prospects, however, were changed by the birth of a young prince in 1453, and now Richard determined to assert his claim by recourse to arms. Thus commenced the \" Wars of the Roses,\" which were destined to last for many years, and to deluge England in blood. Cirencester does not appear as the scene of any active engagement, but in the year 1460 the Duke of Somerset and Lord Devon marched through and encamped in the town,2 with a large army (collected from the south west of England), en route for Yorkshire, in order to assist Margaret at the memorable battle of Wakefield Green, when Richard was slain, and it was left for his son Edward to take up the cause as the representative of the house of York. In the following year, 1461, Henry was taken prisoner, and Edward crowned king in London. The captive monarch lingered, however, for 10 years, principally in confine ment, but the intrepidity of his wife would not allow her to desist from using every effort to retain the crown for her youthful son. Her cause was still espoused by her faithful adherents, 1 Acts of.!Privy Council; Cott. MSS., Cleopatra F.

Lords Somerset and Devon, whilst the inhabitants of the counties from which these noblemen received their titles, and those of the counties bordering on Wales (from Gloucestershire to Lancashire inclusive), were on the whole firmly attached to her. About the same time that her party was suffering defeat at Barnet (where the king maker Warwick was slain), she landed at Weymouth, and marching into Somersetshire soon found herself at the head of a considerable army. Edward was then at Windsor, and showed his generalship by the plan he adopted. It had been rumoured that Margaret intended to march on London, but Edw.ird, knowing that her strength lay in the afore-mentioned counties, and especially in Lancashire and Cheshire, was unwilling to put too much faith in a report which might prove false. He accordingly determined to march westwards to a point where he should be enabled to arrest her progress, either northwards through Gloucestershire, or eastwards in the direction of London, and chose Cirencester for that purpose. Leaving Windsor April 23rd, 1471, he reached Abingdon on the 26th, and rested there the following day, being Sunday, and arrived and encamped at Cirencester the following night.1 Here, having received infor mation that the Queen would be at Bath on the Tuesday, and the day following march forward to give him battle, he led his army forth out of the town, and drew them up in battle array, according to Holinshed in a field \" three miles distant,\" but probably on the high land -on the north side of the road to Tetbury, near Jackaman's Valley. Here he awaited her arrival, but on the morrow, hearing nothing of her, proceeded to Mal mesbury, and thence to Chipping Sodbury. The Queen in the mean time, having received supplies of men, money, and ammunition from Bristol, had stolen a march upon Edward, and was pressing northwards rapidly, first reaching Gloucester, where she was refused admission by Lord Beauchamp, the governor of the castle, she arrived at Tewkesbury, but by this time the King had reached Cheltenham, and Margaret's soldiers, now suffering from exhaustion and want of food, were obliged to await the king's arrival. On the following day, May 4th, 1471, was fought the famous battle of Tewkesbury, in which Margaret's hopes were destroyed, and she and all her leading supporters were taken prisoners. Her son, a lad of 17 or 18 years, was brutally murdered by Edward's brothers, George, Duke of Clarence, and Richard, Duke of Gloucester, in Tewkesbury Abbey, where he had taken refuge. Six years later (in 1477) we read of an occurrence which, 1 Holinshed ; Sharon Turner's History of England.

The family of Twyniho were then connected with Cirencester; there is a brass memorial to one of them in the parish church of about this period, and their arms likewise appear on the shields in the nave as contributors to the restoration which was unques tionably then in contemplation, and was carried out a few years later. They had a manorial residence at Cayforde, near Frome, and by the instructions of the same Duke of Clarence who had killed the young prince, the house was attacked and entered on Saturday, April 13th, about 2 p.m., by a body of 23 persons, and its owner and occupant, Ankarette, a lady of advanced years (and the relict of William Twyniho), taken prisoner to Bath, and all her jewels and other valuables seized. On Sunday, being Easter day,.she was brought to \" Circester,\"1 where she appears to have been detained the night, and leaving at an early hour the following morning was taken in all haste to Warwick, which was reached at 8 p.m. the same evening. At 9 a.m. on Tuesday, she was arraigned before the King's justices on a charge of having administered poison to Isabel, Duchess of Clarence, on the 10th of October previously, from the effects of which that lady was stated to have died on the Sunday before Christmas. The jury \" for fere and drede of grete menaces, and doute of losse of their lyves and goodes,\" found Ankarette guilty, and she was sentenced to be hanged \" upon the gallowes of My ton till she were dede.\" A petition was, however, immediately presented to the King on her behalf, and an order for her release given, the charge being considered utterly groundless. The following year, 1478, Clarence himself was put to death by the King's orders, being drowned in a butt of Malmsey wine. The state of the country at this time was deplorable. The \" Wars of the Roses \" had prevented the growth of trade and manufactures, and had left behind them a spirit of turbulence and lawlessness which pervaded all classes of the people, and the country was as much infested with assailants upon life and property as two hundred years before, when Edward I. passed the famous \" Statute of Winchester.\" The accession of Henry VII. not only put a termination to the struggle of the rival houses, but also marks the early dawn of the era which has witnessed the downfall of chivalry and medi\u00e6 valism and the development of modern progress. Henry, with all his faults, loved peace, and whilst he sought to depress the power of the barons and clergy, used every means to increase that of the people and to foster trade. The people had long discredited the doctrines, and more especially the examples and practices, of those who professed to be their teachers, and whilst they had 1 Sharon Turner's History of England, Petition of Roger Twvniho to Edward IV."], [53, "MEMORABLE EVENTS. 31 hitherto been content with showing their contempt by acts of buffoonery, they were now beginning to be impressed with the necessity for an altered state of things, and this at a time when the cause of progress had received in the invention of the art of printing, and the discoveries of Columbus, Cabot, and other navigators, the impulse of fresh agencies, the importance of which it is almost impossible fairly to estimate. The Reformation, with all its trials, struggles, and heart rending scenes, was soon to follow. In 1540, the Abbey of Cirencester, in common with the remaining monastic institutions of England and Wales, was surrendered to the Commissioners appointed by Henry VIII. That this monarch was led to the suppression of the monasteries and the casting off of the papal power more from political than religious motives is acknowledged by most historians, but it is equally admitted that Protestant teaching made rapid progress, and took possession of the hearts of the people during the remainder of his reign, and during that of his youthful son (Edward VI.), 1547-53, so that many were prepared in the time of Mary to seal their faith by their blood, and to endure the loss of their liberty and their possessions. Many, on the other hand, had undoubtedly accepted the reformed faith, either from motives of interest or with an imperfect knowledge of the truths they professed. To one of these classes belonged William Philippes (or Phelps), the last Catholic and first Protestant Vicar of Cirencester, who having on the 29th day of April, 1551, preached from the pulpit of the parish church a sermon upholding the doctrine of transubstantiation, subsequently signed a document of recantation, and on the following Sunday publicly renounced from the same pulpit his former teaching.1 A more satisfactory, though exceedingly painful, testimony to belief in the Reformed faith is that of Bishop Hooper, who (according to Fox's Book of Martyrs) on the day preceding his martyrdom at Gloucester reached Cirencester,2 en route from London, under the charge of an escort of soldiers. Here, it is recorded, the party stopped for refreshments, and the hostess of a certain inn, who had spoken against him, but was now overcome at the thought of what he was about to suffer and of her past unkindness, pleaded his forgiveness. Under Divine Providence, the days of the Marian persecution were \"shortened \" by her death, which occurred November 17th, 1 Harleian MS. 425. As Philippes was not vicar in Mary's time we are induced to hope that his recantation was made in sincerity. Another of the vicars of the churches which had belonged to Cirences ter Abbey was the well-known vicar of Bray, who turned from Catholicism to Protestantism, then Catholic at the accession of Mary, and Protestant a second time on that of Elizabeth. The names of the monarchs mentioned in the popular song are incorrect. 2 Fox's Book of Martyrs."], [54, "32 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. 1558, and under the happier era of Elizabeth the prosperity and intelligence of the people rapidly advanced. It was only natural that popery should be regarded as a formidable foe by Elizabeth and her subjects, and equally natural that the unfortunate Catholics who had been just before in the ascendant should seek its re-establishment, if for no other object, at least for tlie possession of equal political rights. Hence, it has been rightly stated, that \" the struggle with popery moved and directed nearly the whole policy of her reign, foreign as well as domestic.\"1 As character istic of the times, in June, 1570, the inhabitants of Cirencester petitioned the. States Council to be relieved from the tyranny of \" certain mischievous Papists.\"2 If we except certain acts of severity, which can only be palliated by the difficulties and dangers of the time, Elizabeth's long reign was marked by good sense and consideration of the welfare of her people. The same cannot be said of her successors, James I. and Charles I. These monarchs, by their determined assertion of the royal prerogative, and disregard of the rights of the people, brought about the struggle between Charles and his Parliament which culminated in the Civil War and the ultimate execution of the unfortunate monarch. It is well known that after summoning and dissolving three parliaments in rapid succession, he determined to rule without them, and during the srjace of twelve years, by the agency of Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Wentworth, Earl of Strafford, he succeeded in carrying out a system of arbitrary and absolute government. Under Laud, a most determined attempt was made to compel conformity amongst the clergy and people to the sacerdotalism of this prelate, and a system of examination of the most inquisitorial character was persisted in, whilst in secular matters, by the imposition of \" ship money \" and the extortion of \" benevolences,\" the greatest injustice and tyranny were exercised over the mass of the people. 1 The National Encyclop\u00e6dia, p. 810. 2 State Papers (Lemon), Vol. lxxi.

P., Christopher George, Clerk of the Peace for Cirencester, and several others, who had persecuted by imprisonment and confiscation of goods and by threats certain persons in the town who met for prayer and the study of God's Word. The petitioners sought to have their troublers removed from positions of authority. Some members of the George family had been bailiffs of the Abbey. John George and Alice his wife, to whom there was a monument in St. Catherine's Chapel, died both within 14 years previous to this event. The same Robert Strange, J. P., 14 months later, August 24th, 1571, writes to the Lords of the Council that watch for vagabonds and disorderly persons had been duly kept in Cirencester and the seven Hundreds without result, and again the following month, Sept. 2ith, 1571, to the like effect, so that it would appear that the petition of the Cirencester people for his removal was not granted."], [55, "33 MEMORABLE EVENTS. We have on record, in connection with Cirencester and the neighbourhood, the following events, which will enaable us to realise something of the trials our forefathers were called upon to endure at this time, and their state of feeling which subsequently led them to support the Parliamentary cause. On the 13th June, 1635, the town was visited1 by Sir Nathaniel Brent, the vicar general of Laud, by whom he had been deputed to hold courts of enquiry at certain towns as to the opinions of the neighbouring clergy and their congregations, who were liable at his discretion to be summoned in his presence to undergo a severe scrutiny. Thus we find that Sir N. Brent with this object reached Worcester on the 3rd of June, 1635; Gloucester, on the 8th; Moreton-in the-Marsh, 11th; Cirencester, 13th; Chipping Sodbury, 16th; Winchester, 19th; Southampton, 25th. Sir N. Brent's own report of his enquiries at Cirencester speaks volumes. He says, \" One Mr. Caple, who was formerly suspended, resigned a very good living before I came into the diocese. He was a fellow of Magdalen and tutor to Dr. Freyn (Frewen). Some ministers iti these parts are much suspected of ' inconformity,' but now every one of them doth profess conformity, and would seem ready to fight for it. Thraske hath been lately hereabouts and laboureth much to disperse his Antinomian doctrine, but doth it more in private conference than in the pulpit, where he preacheth only for faith.\" On December 19th, 1635, Edward Stephens, sheriff of the county, writes from Little Sodbury2 that he had been deterred from sending up the \" benevolence money \" on account of the danger of travelling so near Christmas, but that he has about two thousand nine hundred pounds in his possession, and hopes that he shall receive more at Cirencester on the following Monday, but that \" Diverse men give dilatory answers that they have no money, and others stand mute and say nothing.\" He intends the week following Twelfth-day (January 6th) to send up all he has, and \"hopes to yive the Lords satisfaction.\" February 19th, 1636-7, Sir R. Ducie, sheriff of the county, returns his assessment for tine levy of \" ship money \" in the Seven Hundreds of Cirencester? and on the same date, the levy upon each clergyman in the said Hundreds. Two months after this date was argued the memorable case of John Hampden, who refused to pay it.

Malet, Bart.) from Henry Bull to Sir Thomas Thynne, under date August 2, 1637, giving an 1 Domestic State Papers, Vol. ccxciii., No. 128.

A perusal of the letter would probably help us to realise somewhat of the feelings of the people in respect to this imposition. Discontent was prevalent amongst all classes on account of the arbitrary exactions of the King, and Gloucester- shire from the first was strongly adverse to his measures. The gentry of the county met together to concert plans to allay the agitation, and in the same Report \u2014 Public Records \u2014 is a MS. letter, under date December 15, 1641, written from Cirencester by R. Poyntz to Maurice and Richard Berkeley, Thomas Veal, John Smythe, and five others, soliciting their subscriptions to a petition, and directing that the paper when signed be sent to Sir William Master at Cirencester, at whose house they had arranged to hold their next meeting on the \\\\th January next ensuing. Another MS. letter occurs in the same collection from Lord Chandos (Lord Lieutenant of the county), at Sudeley, August 11, 1642, to Captain Veale, notifying a public meeting at the Ram Hotel, at Cirencester, on the following Monday, to consider the course to be taken in the distracted state of the kingdom. At this time both Royalists and Parliamentarians were preparing for Civil War, and the real object of his lordship was to collect men to enlist in his Majesty's service. On the day appointed, the 15th August, 1642, Lord Chandos having thus summoned all the gentry of the county to meet him, arrived at Cirencester, intending to execute his Majesty's commission of array ; but it is said that the whole county adjacent rose in arms and great numbers flocked into Cirencester, and had not some of the more prudent and influential inhabitants intervened he would probably have lost his life. As it was, he escaped with difficulty, leaving his coach behind him, but (according to previous histories) was compelled to sign a declaration promising to desist from further attempts to execute the said commission. The infuriated populace the following morning hewed his lordship's coach in nieces. This is said to have been the first forcible opposition to Charles I. News of the occurrence soon reached the royalists, and the town was forthwith threatened with \"fire and stvord,\" whereupon immediate measures were taken under the direction of Mr. George, of Baunton, one of the Borough Members, Sir Robert Cook, and some other gentlemen, and a garrison was soon formed for its defence, Colonel John Fettiplace being appointed Governor, and Carr, a Scotchman who had served in the Low Countries, being second in command. On the 22nd August, only seven days after Lord Chandos' reception at Cirencester, Charles raised his standard at Nottingham, and marched, via Derby and Shrewsbury, to Oxford, which became his head quarters (London being in the possession of the Parliament), and the future centre of his operations, unpleasantly near, it must be confessed, to Cirencester, and so the inhabitants felt it, for in a letter in the"], [57, "MEMORABLE EVENTS. 35 possession of Earl de la Warr (Public Records, 4th Report), written from Gloucester, October 24th, 1642, is the following language : \u2014 \" Prince Robert (meaning Rupert) rides over the country and plunders. Ciceter is afrayd and sent to Gloster for aid. . . . God keep the King and my Lord of Essex asunder for the sparing of blood ; if these days continue, no corn, no cattle, no money for rent will be seen.\" Every effort seems to have been made to render the town defensible, as it was felt that as it had been the first place to resist the cavaliers, so it would be the first attacked by them. Its importance, not only for its own sake, but for the defence of the county, was generally felt, but it is questionable whether the inhabitants of the vale and other parts were as ready in rendering the needed assistance as they might have been. In the 5th Report Public Records (library of R. Cholmondeley, Esq.), are two letters from Cirencester, one written December 6, 1642, signed by Sir Robert Cooke, Colonel John Fettiplace, Mr. George, the M.P., Messrs. N. and J. Stephens, to John Smythe, of Nibley. Complaint is made to Mr. Smythe that of the 300 \" dragooners \" for Cirencester garrison those from his district had not arrived ; he is requested to issue warrants for them to assemble at Cirencester, and to appoint officers for every parish to deliver the money to the three receivers previously arranged. The second letter to the same man, three days later, is signed by Mr. George, to send the horses mentioned by Smythe, with two shillings per day allowance, and that he will find riders for them, if Captain Pegler cannot, and that the mutinous language of certain of the people is only to be attributed to the dilatoriness of those who have been relied upon by the Parliament and Lord General. Thus far the garrison at Cirencester, acting in concert with those of Gloucester, Tewkesbury, and Malmesbury, had been enabled to prevent any measures being taken on behalf of the King throughout East Gloucestershire and North Wilts, beyond a few occasional raids. On two occasions the townsmen had dislodged detachments of the Cavaliers who had taken up their quarters at Burford, and the King, whose supplies were getting short, and who was needing assistance and support both in money and adherents from a more extended area, was advised that before this could be accomplished the town of Cirencester must be taken. It was rightly described then as being \" the key of Gloucestershire,\" and acting on these representations, and probably influenced by the overt action of the townsmen against Lord Chandos, Charles determined upon its siege. Accordingly, on the 7th of January, 1642-3, the Marquis of Hartford,1 Lord General of the 1 Lord Hartford had been entrusted by the King with seven Welsh counties and ten adjacent English ones, \" but he was not undisputed master of them ; in Gloucestershire Parliamentary opinions prevailed, and in Pembroke they were gaining ground.\" \u2014 Ranke's History of England. E"], [58, "36 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. forces, accompanied with Princes Rupert and Maurice, appeared before it, with an army computed by one of their own number at six thousand men, and demanded its surrender. To both Hartford and Rupert the townsmen returned the same answer (see Appendix), refusing to do so. No attempt was then made by the Cavaliers to compel submission, and after showing them selves again the following morning, they departed without firing a shot. Advantage was taken of their departure to procure four additional cannon from Bristol, and to fortify the town better on all sides, whilst the garrison was increased ; but on the 26th January a party of four or five hundred horses and dragoons, and the following day two hundred musquetiers, marched from the town force to besiege Sudeley Castle (near Winchcombe), the residence of Lord Chandos, in concert with soldiers from Gloucester ' and Tewkesbury. As has been remarked by a previous historian,1 it would be rash now to question the policy of this step, which was undertaken by the advice of so celebrated a general as Massey, but whatever under other circumstances might have been the result of the siege of Cirencester, it certainly facilitated the work of the Royalists. The castle surrendered without attempting a defence on Friday, the. 27th, and three days after Prince Rupert with his forces, arrived in the vicinity, having marched from Northamptonshire via Warwickshire, and lay in the open fields. It is possible that hitherto Rupert had expected to occupy Sudeley Castle in his march to Cirencester, but the garrison there, consisting of the whole force which had left the town, was too strong for him, and he wisely took advantage of its weakened defences to assemble all the forces under his command and to press forward. We cannot here enter into particulars of the siege, full accounts of which, together with additional infor mation respecting the action of the townsmen at this trying period, will be found in the Appendix. It must suffice to say that on Thursday morning, February 2nd, all the Royalist forces were drawn up together, and then Prince Rupert with his army withdrew to the south and south-west of the town, whilst the Earl of C\u00e6rnarvon's and some smaller bodies under subaltern officers stretched along the north and north-western side. The townsmen played upon them with their cannon for two or three hours, and garrisoned every post of defence, including the Barton house. About 12 o'clock the Royalists commenced a determined assault, and having set fire to the ricks of hay and straw, forced an entrance about two hours later, and pushed into the Market-place, and by four o'clock the town was completely in their hands. Many hundreds sought safety in flight, principally towards Cricklade, but were pursued by Lord C\u00e6rnarvon, Sir John Byron, and Prince Maurice. Several were overtaken and killed, and a still greater number taken prisoners, amongst the latter being two 1 Mr. W. K. Beecham's History, published 1842,"], [59, "MEMORABLE EVENTS. 37 clergymen, Mr. Stansfield and Mr. Gregory, the latter minister of Cirencester. The townsmen had thrown great numbers of their arms into the streams, but these were drawn out by the conquerors, who set fire to the houses of some pf the inhabitants, and pillaged as much as lay in their power, \" to the utter ruin of many hundreds of families.\" Accounts vary as to the number killed, but we are inclined to accept the Royalist account that there were 300 killed and 160 wounded, although by this same statement it would appear that as many were killed in flight as in the actual conflict. 3,000 arms were taken, besides the five pieces of ordnance. The prisoners, to the number of 1,100 or 1,200, were lodged in the Church one night, and the next night in Witney Church, aud on the third day were brought into Oxford. It is said that they were treated with great cruelty, but we are compelled to make allowance for partisan feeling ; and whatever may have been the conduct of numbers of the Cavaliers, we are disposed to believe that there was no disposition on the part of the King to exercise excessive severity. Certain it is, that two or three weeks later, his Majesty, after receiving a very abject petition from some forty-six of the householders of the town who were probably amongst the prisoners taken to Oxford, permitted them to return to their houses to follow their usual occupations, and promised that on condition of their \"demeaning themselves with that duty and obedience to his Majesties just and necessary commands, as the condition of the present time and his Majesty's necessities require,\" \"no violence or injury hence forward \" should be done to them.1 The garrison with its commanders, and probably a large number of the inhabitants, remained in imprisonment, as no exchanges of prisoners were made, for some months after this period, and in connection with their incarceration we may relate a circumstance which placed some of them in a critical position. William Yeoman, George Yeoman, Robert Boucher, and Lord Dacres, having entered into a conspiracy to open the gates of Bristol to the Royalists in May, 1643, were detected and sentenced by court martial to death. The King made earnest efforts to save them, and threatened that if the sentence were carried out he would retaliate on Mr. George, 1 See Petition and the King's reply, in the Appendix. Miss Emma Marshall has published, amongst other works, a historical tale entitled \" Tales of Troublous Times,\" supposed to be related by a lady of Gloucester called Dame Alicia Chamberlayne. It relates to this period, and the history is said to be founded upon fact. Several allusions are made to the events that transpired at Cirencester. Dame Alicia havmg two brothers, one articled to a lawyer in London, the other, named Lance, apprenticed to a woolstapler at Cirencester. Lance was amongst the prisoners taken by Prince Rupert, and when at Oxford refuses with fifty others the offer of the king to return to Cirencester, as they preferred to work in the trenches to securing their liberty at the sacrifice of their principles. Eventually Lance escapes, and reaches his paternal home in Gloucester with some difficulty and danger."], [60, "38 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. Captain Huntley, and others taken at Cirencester.1 Nathaniel Fiennes, the governor of Bristol, persisted in their execution, but the King did not carry out his threat. After despatching the prisoners to Oxford, Prince Rupert took immediate measures \" for the preservation of the county in his Majesty's obedience,\" and for this object summoned the gentry of \" Cotswold and most other parts of Glocestershire \" to meet him at Cirencester. They did so, and agreed to raise by compulsory payment from the people amongst whom they dwelt, together with their own contributions, a sum of four thousand pounds monthly in aid of the King.2 A garrison was established at Cirencester under the command of Sir Ralph Dutton, with Harry Verney as major of the horse,3 whilst Prince Maurice made it his head-quarters4 in the skirmishing warfare he carried on, principally against Sir William Waller, during the ensuing spring and summer. No sooner had the King received the intimation that the town was reduced than he appears to have anticipated that Gloucester would follow, and accordingly during the ensuing week he demanded of the citizens their immediate submission. But although they must have felt keenly the loss their party had sustained by the reduction of the sister town (at that time nearly its equal in wealth and population) and the enhanced peril of their position, they boldly stood to their colours. Whereupon the King, on February 12th, issued a manifesto to the High Sheriff and Justices of the Peace, to be read in every church throughout the county, commanding the people to hold no intercourse with the citizens, to lay down their arms and bring them to his magazine at Cirencester,5 under the severest penalties, and about the middle of the month Maurice marched from Cirencester to co-operate with Lord Herbert in enclosing the city. According to Clarendon a week's cessation of arms was agreed to between the King and Parliament from February 27th, 1642-3, to March 6th, 1643, and during this interval Maurice's forces returned to Cirencester, only, however, to renew the attempt upon Gloucester at the expiration of the assigned period.6 This after a little skirmishing failed. Fresh troops now arrived at Cirencester under the command of Lord Grandison, and by the united forces of Maurice and Grandison, Sir William Waller, who had taken Tewkesbury and advanced towards Cirencester,7 was deterred from carrying out his assumed 1 History of Cirencester, by W.

Waller states in one of his dispatches, however, that he made a feint on Cirencester to cover his passage of the Severn at Framiloe.1 Early in May, Maurice engaged with Waller at Upton Bridge, near Tewkesbury, but was compelled to retreat towards Cirencester,2 but again advanced towards Tewkesbury. In the month of August, 1643, the Royalists commenced the memorable siege of Gloucester, which withstood all their efforts for five long weeks, and was subsequently relieved by the Lord General Essex, with an army largely composed of the London trained bands.3 Upon his approach, the King's army, of which Prince Maurice's forces from Cirencester formed a part, raised the siege, and advanced towards Tewkesbury. Essex by a skilful man\u0153uvre withdrew the King towards Worcester, entered Tewkesbury, and after a rapid night march of twenty-five miles, rested within a short distance of Ciren cester about three o'clock4 on the following (Saturday) morning, September 16th, 1643. From the various accounts5 written soon after the occurrence we are enabled to give the following : \u2014 Orders were given by the Lord General (Essex) to Sir Robert Pye to enter the town whilst the rest of the army surrounded it. Accordingly, with a chosen detachment of musketeers, this officer advanced, and having killed one sentinel and wounded the other he carried out his instructions. As Prince Maurice's forces were that night expected to return, their entry caused at first no concern, and the Cavaliers were not wholly aroused to their position until several of the Roundhead soldiers had forced their houses and surprised them in bed. At that time besides the permanent garrison, there were quartered at Cirencester two regiments of horse under Sir Nicholas Crispe and Colonel Spencer, which (Rushworth tells us) were intended to proceed to Kent under the immediate command of the King. The garrison surrendered and desired quarter. Essex took 225 men, including 10 officers, prisoners, and they were tied two and two together (as Prince Rupert's prisoners had been seven months before). Some of the cavalry soldiers appear to have succeeded in escaping, but their horses were taken (in number about four hundred), likewise from twenty-seven to forty6 cart loads of provisions which had been stored for Prince Maurice's forces on their return. 1 History of Cirencester, by W.

Sir Robert Pye was shot in the arm, and one Parliament soldier pistolled by a Cavalier who had taken him prisoner. The Cavaliers lost only two or three men. During the following day (Saturday) Essex marched to Cricklade, whilst the London brigade quartered at Latton. At this village an amusing incident occurred, for ten cart loads of sick and lame Cavaliers passing through the village on hearing of the approach of the Parlia mentary army \"found their legs \" and made off.1 Essex advanced from Cricklade to Hungerford, and encountered the Royalists at the famous battle of Newbury, the provisions taken at Cirencester having supplied his army in the meanwhile, which had previously become much straitened for want of supplies. Although Ciren cester was for a time freed from the presence of a garrison which must have been most hateful to the townspeople, Essex was not in a position, and indeed made no attempt to retain the town in the service of the Parliament, and some time afterwards it again became a Royalist garrison under the command of Sir Jacob Ashley, who was entrusted with three brigades of foot to support the King's cause in the hill country of Gloucestershire. On one occasion he marches out of Cirencester and assaults and takes Lypiat House.2 The London Post, February 4th, 1644-45, states that Colonel Massey's garrisons in Gloucestershire are much straitened \" and have very little elbowe roome to stirre out upon any occasion, and amongst others Sir Jacob Asheley's garrison at Cirencester is no little hindrance to them.\" From the following number of the same paper, it appears that he had likewise been plundering within three miles of Gloucester, and had driven away all the cattle from thence, but Sir William Waller \" being now on his march from the west, relief expected.\"3 During the entire period since the taking of the town (except perhaps for a short time after its capture by Essex) the Royalist forces had pillaged the whole country extending northwards and westwards, from Cirencester almost to the gates of Gloucester. For nearly two years and a half were the unfortunate inhabitants subjected to these troubles, but towards the middle of 1645 Ashley's garrison appears to have left Cirencester,4 and on the 10th of his army. The contents of the letter referred to were communicated the next week, Sept. 21st, to Sir R. Verney, and are now with the Verney Historical MSS. In the same MSS., R. Barrington writes to his father, Sir T. Barring ton, Sept. 18th, 1643, stating that the House of Parliament had recei/ved certain intelligence that morning of the taking of \" Cyssester \" by \"my Lord General with 40 cart load of provisions,\" &c, &c. 1 Diurnal account of the proceedings of Parliamentary forces, as copied by Mr. Richard Jefferies. 2 Near Miserden, eight or nine miles from Cirencester, W.N.W. 3 London Post, No. 23, Feb., 1644-45. 4 Sir Jacob Ashley (or Astley) led the main body of foot at Naseby, June 14th, 1645, so that it is almost certain that Cirencester ceased to be the centre of. his operations before the latter date, and subsequent lo May 10th preceding (see publication entitled Mere Veredic for May 10th, 1645)."], [63, "MEMORABLE EVENTS. 41 November the same year Colonel Morgan, governor of Gloucester, who had been appointed to the command of the Parliamentary forces in the west, advanced to Cirencester on his return from the relief of Canon Frome, Herefordshire, and having quartered the night proceeded to \"Rediot House,\" near Faringdon, to hold a council of war with Colonel Blunt.1 In September, 1645, the members for Gloucester and Tewkes bury, and Sir Theobald George and John George, the members for Cirencester, were \" expelled the house \" for deserting the Parliamentary cause,2 and Sir Thomas Fairfax and Colonel Nathaniel Rich were elected by the townsmen with great demonstrations of joy. We should not omit to state that the King twice visited the town during the time it was held by the Royalist garrison, firstly on his march from Bristol to Oxford, in August, 1643, when he passed a night at the Abbey House, and again the following year, on his return from Bath. Whatever may be our sympathies in the struggle between the Parliament as the vindicators of popular liberty and the King as the exponent of those claims to monarchic rule which received their embodiment in the Stuart kings, it is impossible to regard with satisfaction all the events of the few succeeding years, and especially the fate of the unfortunate King. It is recorded of Mr. Gregory, the Minister of Cirencester, and amongst those who were taken prisoners by Prince Rupert, and throughout a most consistent supporter of civil and religious liberty, that he wrote in the Parish Register, on hearing of the sad event, \" 0, England, what did'st thee do the 30th of this month\" (January, 1648-49) ;3 and, indeed, there can be no question that this act induced amongst other causes to the revulsion of feeling which in 1660 reinstated the Stuart family on the throne of England. There is an interesting fact not recorded in any previous history of the town, but which had been accepted by the inhabitants upon tradition, which the author has been enabled to verify, viz., that the young Prince Charles, after his defeat at Worcester, September 3rd, 1651, passed a night in the town in the disguise of a footman,4 during the interval before his escape to the continent. The particulars of his wanderings are very romantic, and we have endeavoured in the Appendix to give a little fuller sketch of them. On the 22nd September, 1663, Charles arrived in Cirencester, not this time in disguise and in dread 1 Perfect Occurrences, Nov. 14-21, 1645. 2 Perfect Passages, Sept. 3-10, 1645. 3 \"Good and Great Men of Gloucestershire,\" by Mr. Stratford ; Mr. Fuller, in his History of Cirencester Church. 4 Wilts and Gloucestershire Standard, November 26th, 1859, referring to lecture on Cirencester by Mr. J.

The royal pair had been spending two or three weeks in Bath, but had left early in the morning, and after \" dining \" at Badminton with Lord Herbert, where the gentry of the county attended, \"supped\" and \"slept\" at Lord Newburgh's, at Cirencester,1 leaving the following day for Oxford. On June 26, 1667, occurs a letter to the Secretary of State that the Marquis of Worcester had raised a volunteer force of one hundred first class men near Bristol for the war with the Dutch, which were to assemble at Cirencester2 the following Thursday.^ According to Oldfield's work on Parliamentary Constituencies, Earl Cholmondeley was murdered in the streets of Cirencester in the following year (1688), for upholding absolute monarchy, but this statement we have not been able to verify, and, whilst disposed to place every confidence in its author, it is impossible not to be struck with the extraordinary nature of such an occurrence even in those days. There can be no question, however, that the restoration of Charles was not received with unmixed approbation, either by the inhabitants of our ancient town or by the country at large, and the subsequent conduct of Charles and his successor brought about the \" glorious Revolution \" of 1688, and the down fall of the Stuarts. The landing of William, Prince of Orange, at Torbay, Guy Fawkes' day, 1688, and his subsequent accession to the throne, marks a great epoch in English history of which we are reaping the beneficial results nearly two hundred years later. On his arrival, William repaired to Exeter, at first not to receive much encouragement, but in a short time risings took place in all parts in his favour, and numbers flocked to his standard. James left London in haste in the early morn of the 19th of November, and the same evening reached Salisbury, which now became his headquarters, whilst William had marched further inland. About the same day of the month Cirencester was the scene of an encounter3 at which (according to Sir Robert Atkyns) the first bloodshed of the Revolution took place. The then Duke of Beaufort, who was chief commanding officer of the county militia, remained faithful to James, and his regiment under the immediate command of Captain Lorange, intercepted Lord Lovelace, who was marching through the town to support the cause of William with a chosen body of some fifty horse. Several were killed on both sides, including Lorange and his son.4 1 Domestic State Papers. Letters : W.

James received the news at Salisbury, and gave instructions for his lordship to be conveyed thither for trial by a council of war. The order, however, was not carried out, for as it was the only intelligence in the least degree of a reassuring character that James received, he foresaw that it was imperative that he should look to his own safety, and left Salisbury in haste on the 24th, and a few. weeks later was allowed to set sail for France without molestation. Lord Lovelace was discharged from Gloucester Castle by Sir John Guise. It does not appear that any part was taken by the townsmen in the affray between Lovelace and Lorange, although it is probable that the sympathies of the majority were with the former, as John Howe,1 one of their members (who was re-elected the following year), was at that time a zealous supporter of William, and a member of his first Cabinet. Since the triumph of popular principles in 1688, the history of Cirencester has been one of comparative tranquillity, and advantage has been gradually taken of the change to carry out such improvements as have contributed to the comfort and the improved social and moral condition of its inhabitants. These will be separately referred to in the description of the town. Amongst matters of further interest, the following may here be recorded. The unfortunate James II. visited the Earl of Newburgh at Cirencester the year preceding his abdication,2 and his daughter, Queen Anne, visited Cirencester in 1702, staying at the Abbey House, as appears by an entry in the Parish Register. On Saturday, October 21st, 1738,3 Frederick, Prince of Wales, came from Bath to visit Lord Bathurst, and stayed until the 24th. \" The woollcombers in dresses particular to their business met his royal highness three miles on the road, with a great multitude of people, and there were prodigious rejoicings on the occasion.\" In 1750, the same royal prince was a visitor at Oakley House, with his son, the future King George III., who also visited the second Lord Bathurst on a subsequent occasion, July 19th, 1788, with his Queen and daughter, the Princess Augusta, from Cheltenham. His lordship provided dinner, of which the King could not partake, being at that time prevented by the course prescribed for him by his medical advisers.4 A petition of the inhabitants in 1753,4 upon a subject referred to in the recent speech of the Prime Minister on the Affirmation Bill, will throw some light on the state of feeling at that time. An act had been 1 An eccentric and unprincipled man, who afterwards deserted his party ; see List of Representatives and Lord Macaulay's remarks upon him in his History of England. 2 Rev. W. F.

F"], [66, "44 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. passed in the previous session to enable foreign Jews to be naturalized without taking the Sacrament. This act, however, was too liberal for the times, and was exceedingly unpopular. Cirencester shared in the prevalent feeling, and its townsmen petitioned their members, Henry Bathurst and John Coxe, to vote for its repeal, on the extraordinary ground that because the Jews had by Divine ordinance been scattered amongst the nations of the earth, the measure was \" fighting against God.\" A more careful study of the Scriptures, and especially of Romans, chapter xi., is necessary even in the present day to teach that religious intolerance is not so consistent with the possession of religious principle as is too frequently believed. Amongst the unfortunate and ill-advised excesses which a few of the people were led to during the agitation preceding the Reform Act of 1832, the Bristol Riots of 1831 are perhaps the most noteworthy. Considerable damage was done, and we have been informed that Sir Charles Wetherell (the recorder) and several of the opulent citizens drove through this town in their flight from Ab enraged populace. Having reached the era of enhanced prosppKy which has followed that great measure, we are enabled to record with pleasure the great manifestations of joy exhibited in this town in common with the length and breadth of the land at the Coronation of our reigning Sovereign, in July, 1838, fuller particulars of which are given in a History of Cirencester published shortly after the event ; and likewise in referring to the similar rejoicings (within the memory of many of us who cannot look back to the earlier date) at the marriage of the Prince of Wales, March 10th, 1863. It may not be out of place to refer to the fact that on the occasion of the death of the lamented Prince Consort, in December, 1861, the inhabitants were not behind other towns in the matter of presenting an address of condolence to Her Majesty. The late Earl of Beaconsfield (then Mr. Benjamin Disraeli) visited William Lennox, the 5th Earl Bathurst, at Oakley House, in June, 1869, and in 1875, the present Prime Minister, William Ewart Gladstone, was also entertained by his Lordship ; and in February, 1877, Lord Shannon, M.F.H., then residing at No. 16, Cecily Hill, was honoured by a few days' visit from H.R.H. the Prince of Wales."], [67, "IP^IRT II. HISTORY OF RELIGION. THE SAXON COLLEGIATE CHURCH. ABBEY OF ST. MARY AND THE ANCIENT CHURCHES OF ST. CECILIA AND ST. LAWRENCE. EXISTING CHURCHES AND NONCONFORMIST CHAPELS, The earliest inhabitants of this island of whom we have reliable records observed the rites and teaching of Druidism, and we are informed by classic historians that whilst this was the accepted religion of the people of Gaul, Britain was its \" head-quarters,\" and that the youth from the opposite shores braved the dangerous sea voyage to be initiated into its ghastly mysteries. It is probable that the intercourse of many of the families of the British Chiefs with Roman civilization during the interval between the invasion of Julius C\u00e6sar and that of Aulus Plautius had caused the influence of the ancient superstition to decline, and that the native tribes were soon led to accept the mythology of their more polished but still heathen conquerors. At the time that Plautius carried the Roman arms and worship into the territory of the Dobuni scarcely a dozen years had, elapsed since the command had been given to the Apostles, of the Christian religion to \"Go into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature,\" and so great was the success which attended the early earnest efforts of these men and their immediate followers that, in spite of the most bitter persecution carried on by the most powerful empire the world had then known, the \" glad tidings of salvation \" had been proclaimed during the lifetime of some of its original propagators through out the whole length and breadth of its territory, not excepting this England of ours; and although it may be difficult to substantiate Mr. Lysons's suggestion that there were Christian"], [68, "46 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. converts in the court of Plautius at Cirencester,1 yet there can be no doubt that the Christian religion had many sincere adherents here during the Roman occupation of Britain, and that during the reigns of Constantine the Great and his successors their numbers rapidly increased. In consequence of the cessation of persecution under these emperors, and the profession of its tenets by some of the emperors themselves, numbers were induced to profess the Christian religion who were destitute of real Christianity, and in proportion as the Church gained in numbers it would appear that by the engrafting of a semi-heathenism, she lost in purity. Numerous churches were built upon the model of the ancient basilica, and unquestionably such a church existed in Corinium, if indeed the portion of a classic column in the south arcade of the present Parish Church does not belong to such an edifice,2 and in the fifth century Christianity became the acknowledged religion of South Britain. Corinium was one of the thirty-three civitates or capital cities of Britain at this time, and continued so until the Saxon invasion, and it is suggested by Mr. Sharon Turner that each \" civitas \" had not only its civil officers, whose jurisdiction extended over a district equal at least in extent to that of an average English county, but its \"bishop,\" or chief minister, who exercised spiritual oversight over the evangelists or neighbouring ministers within the same district. Such a conclusion is supported by facts, and whilst not disposed to put too much faith in the writings of medi\u00e6val historians, it is noteworthy that Alfred of Beverley informs us that Dubricius, who had crowned King Arthur at Cirencester, having become a hermit, was succeeded as Archbishop of C\u00e6rleon by Sampson Dolonsis ; that about the same time Thebas was appointed to the bishopric of Llandaff, Mangeramus to that of Cirencester, and Dunianus to Winchester. It would, however, be too much to assert that Cirencester was then ' a cathedral city, as cathedrals and the ecclesiastical institutions afterwards associated with them did not then exist, at least in Britain. During the period of intestine commotion following the arrival of the Saxons in Britain, the British churches must have been almost entirely destroyed, and heathen worship again set up in their place. Holinshed refers to this in the quaint language of his time in relating the discomfiture of the Britons after their three kings were slain ; their three cities of Gloucester, Cirencester, and Bath taken, and themselves driven into Wales. Almost simultaneously, however, with this (A.D. 597), Augustine with a band of monks arrived from Rome and commenced, under the protection of 1 See remarks thereon, \"Good and Great Men of Gloucestershire,\" by Mr. Stratford. 2 It has been suggested that this column is \"in situ,\" but this is not strictly correct. (See account of Parish Church.)"], [69, "THE SAXON COLLEGIATE CHURCH. 47 Ethelbert, King of Kent, to propagate the Christian faith ; although it must be admitted in a less pure form than it had been received by his predecessors some centuries before. Towards the close of the seventh century the teaching of Augustine became the accepted faith of the Saxon Heptarchy. Peada, who succeeded Penda (his father) in 655, is said to have been the first Christian King of Mercia, and in 656, with the aid of Oswy, King of Northr umbria, to have founded a Bishopric of great extent at Lichfield, Cirencester being situated just within its southern limits, and Mr. Fosbroke asserts that Cirencester had become (what it certainly was at a later period) a royal residence. The era for the general erection of parish churches \u2022 with resident ministers had not yet arrived, but it is reasonable to conclude that Peada and his son Ethelred, who resigned the crown \u2022for the convent, would have had here a chapel or house of prayer, with minister to officiate, and that all would be welcome within its walls. About the year 680, Ethelred is said to have founded at Worcester a college of secular canons, and to have constituted it as the Cathedral of a diocese taken out of that of Lichfield, and made to comprise the modern counties of Worcester, Warwick, and Gloucester.1 These secular canons (or priests) generally lived for the sake of protection under the same roof as the bishop or dean who presided as head of their college, or otherwise in houses adjacent ; unlike the monks they were frequently married men, and were not subject to all the restraints of the monastic life. They were sent out at the discretion of their bishop to evangelize the district under his charge, and the offerings received by them in their preaching tours were paid into a common fund for the support of their institution and the dispensation of charity. Besides the Cathedral Church and its attendant College, the following important religious houses, amongst others, were founded in early Saxon times within the diocese of Worcester, viz. : \u2014 The College of Secular Canons, afterwards a Benedictine monastery, at Gloucester (about 680-682) ; the Benedictine Monastery at Tewkesbury, in 715 ; the larger and more important one of the same order at Winchcombe, in 798 ; and lastly, in the reign of King Egbert (828-836), the Collegiate Church of Secular Canons, at Cirencester, by Alwyn, probably the same man who held the Bishopric of Worcester from 844 until his death in 872.2 At the date of the foundation of the Cirencester College, the number of churches throughout the country had become considerable ; the Kings and the territorial lords had erected chapels or oratories, and endowed them for the support of a resident minister ; in some cases the monasteries and collegiate 1 The diocese of Worcester included these three counties until the Reformation, when Henry VIII. formed that of Gloucester out of it. 2 See life of Alwyn amongst the lives of Cirencester men."], [70, "48 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. churches had erected similar chapels, and resigned to their ministers the revenues or a part of the revenues of the district over which their ministrations would extend, and the rights of sepulture and baptism being granted to these edifices they became eventually the parochial churches of the adjacent district. There can be little doubt that a Saxon church for public worship existed in Cirencester before the foundation of Alwyn, but the institution of secular canons, called in the Domesday Book \" the Church of Cirencester,\" was the mother church,1 and principal evangelizing agency for the town and district, and that upon it the children of the wealthy were dependent for instruction in secular as well as religious knowledge. Perhaps few men in those days were more conscious of the benefits accruing from Christian education than King Alfred, and for this reason (as Dr. Paull has shown in his life of that monarch),2 his object in bringing Guthrum and his army to Cirencester for a whole year was that they might receive such an education as would enable this race of sea-warriors to settle as peaceable cultivators of the land in the territory of East Anglia, for it appears that at their departure from that province Alfred tried the doubtful experiment of compelling them either to accept Christianity or to depart beyond the sea in a squadron he had provided for the purpose. And thus we may be justified in assuming that Cirencester had one thousand years ago not only an excellent educational establishment (considering the state of the times), but something akin to a \" Royal Agricultural College.\" Guthrum's faithfulness during the remainder of his life showed the wisdom of Alfred's conduct. In an age when education was not easy to obtain, it is not surprising that these collegiate institutions should have been valued by those who owed so much to them, and that they should have received continually fresh endowments. Unfortunately, increased wealth was not attended by increased zeal and devotion. The canons commenced to keep their falcons and their dogs, and lived in the greatest splendour and luxury, attended in many cases by looseness of life. The people now began to contrast them with the poor Benedictines (who lived according to the strict rule of St. Benedict), and \" as the time had not yet arrived for the utter abuse of wealth in the monasteries, of which succeeding ages had sufficient sorry experience,\"3 a growing opinion prevailed in the tenth century that if the monks possessed the wealth of the secular canons more religious work would be accomplished. An outcry was raised against the marriage of the seculars, and this was furthered by the then reigning popes, and 1 Mr. Roberts, at the Arch\u00e6ological meeting at Cirencester (although not acquainted with the date of the erection of the secular college), considered the church at Cirencester was the \"mother church.\" 2 Translation from the German of Dr. Paull. 3 Green's History of Worcester, published 1796."], [71, "THE SAXON COLLEGIATE CHURCH. 49 King Edgar found that he could not undertake a more popular measure than to weed out the more opulent of their foundations and to place monks in their stead ;x and in this he was strongly supported by the well-known Dunstan, 44rchbishop of Canterbury, and Ethelred and Oswald, Bishops of Winchester and Worcester. Oswald actually ejected the. married clergy out of seven religious houses in his diocese \u2014 Cirencester in all probability being one of the seven \u2014 and then had their removal confirmed by the pope, a very necessary precaution, because in some places he had broken in upon the settlement of the foundation. Dunstan acted more prudently, and by means of a synodal decree, presented at the Council of Winchester in 975, virtually effected the same object; the monks pretended that \"signs from heaven\" had declared in their favour ; the secular clergy, however, were not to be deceived by these pretended declarations, and they had a strong supporter in Elfere, or rather Elfric, Duke of Mercia, who replaced many of them in this district, with their wives, in their conventual houses, from which Edgar had expelled them ; and the death of Dunstan occurring shortly after, Oswald appears to have submitted to circumstances, and as Ethelred and the succeeding kings were not disposed to render the support to the monks that Edgar had done, the secular priests were generally left in undisputed possession of their property. It would be most likely in the Chapter House of the Collegiate Church that Ethelred held the Synodal Council (a.d. 991-2) which dispossessed Alfric, the son of Elfere (above-mentioned) of his estates, and banished him the realm, and in the same building that Canute, at Easter, 1020, held the witenagemote which outlawed Ethelward and Edwy. The importance of Cirencester College is indicated by the appointment of Reimbald by Edward the Confessor as its dean, about the year 1050, and by his continuance in the office until after the compilation of the Domesday Book, 36 years later. It is expressly mentioned as a wealthy institution by Leland, but unless the estates catalogued in that valuable record (the Domesday) are indiscriminately named as belonging to the Church itself, or to Reimbald, they would not appear to have been very extensive, although with offerings and other sources of revenue its income might have been sufficient to warrant Leland's expression. During the time of Reimbald the outcry against the \" secular canons \" had assumed such proportions on the Continent that St. Peter Damianus earnestly solicited Pope Nicholas II. to put a stop to their conduct, which was generally felt to be a scandal to the Church, and for this end to refuse to continue to them the right of possessing private property, thus compelling them to live in common. The Pope did not seem disposed to take such decisive measures, but assembled a synod 1 Green's History of Worcester and Milton's Early Britain."], [72, "50 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. in 1059, and exhorted them to adopt this mode of life; and Alexander III., at another Council four years later, tendered similar advice, and for the enlightenment of the seculars reference was made to the writings of the celebrated Augustine, Bishop of Hippo, and either from certain of his discourses, or from his 109th Epistle, was established the \" rule of St. Augustine.'* It is not improbable that some of the seculars voluntarily adopted this \"rule,\" but however that may have been, a new order or religious fraternity sprung up differing little from the old monks, which became known as the \"Augustine Order of Canons regular,\" and this order, which was introduced into England early in the following century, became, next to the Benedictines, the most wealthy of all its religious communities. Henry I. ascended the throne in the last year (1100) of the century that had witnessed the Conquest of England by his father, and reigned during more than one third of the century succeeding, and by him and his successors, or under their auspices, several Augustinian monasteries were founded, and in some cases, as in that of Cirencester, upon the foundation of a Collegiate Church of Secular Canons, whose churches, lands, and charters were presented to the new institution, respect of course being paid to the then existing life interests of the prebends. To return to the Collegiate Church. Its estates, as given in the Domesday Book, are as follows : \u2014 TERRA \u00c6CCL'E DE CIRECESTRE. In Cirecestre Hd.

It comprised one and a half hides, the curacy, eight cottages, one plow tillage, fifteen acres of meadow, worth in all fifty shillings. Two secular priests, possibly appointed to officiate there on behalf of the Collegiate Church, held half a hide, two plow tillages, and eight acres of meadow. The Collegiate Church likewise received in the time of William and Edward the Confessor one-third of the tolls of the Market, \" which was held on Sunday in the several streets.\" It is scarcely possible to form even an approximate idea of the extent of these possessions, the purchasing power of money is so widely different, and the land measurements are not easily determinable by modern standards of measurement. The hide and plough tillage were said to have been equal to eight virg\u00e6 or virgates, but the latter was a variable and uncertain measure. In the Gloucester Cartulary, III. 180, two virgates arementioned as each equal to 68 acres, which would make a hide no less than 544 acres, but most authors consider the hide to be equal to the quantity of land one plough could plough in a year ; the same is also stated of the carucate, whereas Dugdale makes the former as equal to 120 acres, and the latter as 60 acres. From a comparison with estates referred to in the Domesday Book, the quantity of which is now known, these last-named measurements do not appear to be far from the truth. There is very little other authentic information procurable respecting the Collegiate Church. In the Arch\u00e6ologia are three short Anglo-Saxon charters in which William confirms Reimbald in his possessions in Wilts and Glou cester ; and in part of an ancient Cartulary in the library of the Marquis of Bath, is a portion of the confirmation of a composition between the \" Church of Cirencester \" and \" Wandragesil de Courcelles,\" by Robert, Bishop of Bath (1135-1166), of which we here append a translation \u2014 the original composition having been made in the bishopric of John de Villula (1088-1122). \" he shall have a chaplain whilst he may serve his Lord in the mother church, if by the interposi tion of any bodily ailment the chaplain shall not be able to fulfil his office, no one else except a priest of the church shall be required. \" Robert, by the grace of God, bishop of the church of Bath, to all the sons of the holy church of God dwelling in his parish (or diocese), greeting.

Book to have been possessed of property in nearly 1 00 villages in Somersetshire, including the village of Standerwick, afterwards part of the Abbey possessions, although it is not named as amongst the estates of Reimbald granted to it by Henry I. This document, therefore, probably confirmed to the canons of the Abbey property granted to the Collegiate Church by Wandragesil de Courcelles. If written documents of Saxon times are scarce, examples of Saxon architecture are even more so, and as in the case before us, the later and more magnificent structure founded in the twelfth century and erected upon its site was pulled down more than 300 years since, it is most unlikely that any trace of the Saxon church will ever come to light. It is evident that the secular establishment remained until the opening of the Abbey in 1131, Serlo's appointment being in that year and not in 1117, as given in Rudder, and from the description of William of Worcester, we have been disposed to consider that the Lady Chapel of the Abbey and its most ancient aisle formed a part of the earlier building, and that during the erection of the Abbey (1117-1131) the seculars continued as before to hold their services in it. The Saxon churches are supposed to have generally followed the plan of the Roman basilic\u00e6 rather than of the Latin Cross, and it is probable that the Collegiate Church (if not wholly built upon this plan) possessed a continuous nave and choir with somewhat narrow aisles to each, and that whilst the centre portion and southern aisles remained intact, and existed in William of Worcester's time (1460), as the \"most ancient\" Lady Chapel, \" with aisle adjacent,\" the northern aisles of the ancient church became the south chancel aisle in the Abbey, and the outside northern wall was pierced shortly before the opening of the Abbey to form the south arcade of its chancel, its early architecture being thus lost in the rechiselled Norman work. The dimensions (internal) of the Lady Chapel, with its aisle adjacent, as given by William of Worcester, were about 132' 0\" x 38' 6\" ; if, of the width, 25' 0\" be allotted to the nave, and 13' 6\" to the aisle, and that on the northern side be taken as the same, the total width of the ancient church would be 52' 0\", and its internal area nearly 7000 sup. feet, a small building compared with its successor, and with the more recent Abbey and Collegiate Churches, but probably surpassed by few at the period of its erection. The view set forth that this \"most ancient\" Lady Chapel, &c, formed a complete church originally is further borne out by its unusually large dimensions, and especially the great length as compared with the width, suggesting that instead of having been designed for one room or chapel in the first instance, it contained the usual nave, choir, and presbytery, if not a \"narthex\" at the western entrance, which would in all proba bility be removed for the erection of the Abbey transept. The"], [75, "ABBEY OF ST. MARY. 53 Chapel of the \" Nine Altars,\" in Durham Cathedral, is the only instance in all the English Cathedrals of a chapel of equal length, but then it is practically an eastern transept, and its width proportionably great to its length. Henry VII.'s Chapel at Westminster is world-wide in its reputation, but the Lady Chapel of Cirencester Abbey would have been longer. Of other Cathe dral chapels, the next in length are the splendid Lady Chapel of Ely, 100' 0\" x 46' 0\" ; that of Gloucester measuring approximately 90' 0\" x 26' 4\" ; of Hereford, 80' 0\" x 31' 0\" ; the Chapel of St. Thomas a Becket, at Canterbury, about 83' 0\" x 29' 0\" ; that of St. John the Baptist, Manchester, 80' 0\" x 28' 0\" ; the largest Chapels in each of the other Cathedrals being generally from 50' 0'' to 70' 0\" in length, and varying from 20' 0\" to nesirly 50' 0\" in width. In the Cathedral of Ripon, in a position precisely similar to that formerly occupied by the Lady Chapel of the Cirencester Abbey, is a small building (now divided into vestries), but which is understood to be the remains of the original Saxon Monastic Church at Ripon. Leland, referring to the Collegiate Church, writes, Itin. II. f. 24 : \u2014 \" Ther was afore the Conquest a fair and riche College of Prebendaries in this town, but of what Saxon's foundation no man can telle.\" Again, Itin. V. f. 65 : \u2014 \"But there afore was a great Chirch of Prebendaries.\" THE ABBEY OF ST. MARY. In the year 1117, Henry I. commenced to restore and enlarge on an extensive scale the Church and Conventual Buildings of the Secular Canons, and upon the completion of the work fourteen years later, dissolved the ancient Collegiate institution, and after taking into consideration the life interests of its members, took away its charters and possessions, and conferred them, with many additional lands and privileges, upon the regular Canons of St. Augustine, whom he had placed therein.1 The new Monastery was opened by the King in person, attended by the leading laymen and ecclesiastics of the realm, in honour of St. Mary and St. James, and Serlo, the fourth dean of Sarum, was then appointed the first Abbot. The Abbey was solemnly dedicated on Sunday, the 16th of the Kalends of November (and the feast of St. Ethelreda the Virgin), 1176, to the patron saints by Bartholomew, Bishop of Exeter, in the presence of the second Henry, the grandson of the founder, who confirmed the charter of his grandfather, and increased its emoluments by the grant of the royal revenue 1 Leland, Collectanea, I. 79, II. 158, I. 46; Harleian MS., List of Abbots, No. 7520 ; Willis, Mitred Abbeys ; Matthew Paris, Historia Anglorum ; &c, &c."], [76, "54 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. \u25a0arising from the town of Cirencester.1 The charter of Henry I., in addition to the outlying churches and lands in Gloucestershire and seven other counties, had bestowed upon the canons all the possessions of the \" seculars \" in Cirencester in lands, tithes, &c, a certain part of the royal demesne lands, and the wood called \" Acley.\" ;2 by grant of Roger, Earl of Hereford, they had shortly afterwards received another estate situate between the town and \" Acley \" Wood,3 and it might have been supposed that from these grants and the charter of Henry II. every provision had been made to enable the canoDs \" freely, quietly, and safely \" to fulfil the requirements of their \" order.\" Richard I., however, in the first year of his reign, November 12th, 1189, thought fit to enrich them by disposing of the whole of his remaining manor and manorial rights in the parish of Cirencester and in the \" vill of Minety which is a member of the said manor,\" together with the jurisdiction of the seven adjacent hundreds \" to the said manor belonging\" in perpetuity, in consideration of the sum of thirty pounds paid annually at Michaelmas into the Exchequer.4 The same king granted them \" free warren \" throughout all their manors, which was confirmed by Henry IV5 King John in the first year of his reign confirmed all these charters,6 and the canons likewise obtained from him in the 17th year of his reign a new farm and a grant of fairs for eight days before the feast of All Saints;7 in 37 Henry III., another grant of fairs; and five years later (1257-8), one of markets in the town and seven hundreds.8 The charters of Richard I. and Lord Moreton had also rendered them free from many of the imposts levied upon ordinary persons, and enabled them to purchase goods in the markets for their own use and to dispose of their own produce without payment of ordinary market tolls.9 In consequence of the Abbot having offended King John, that monarch, through his Justiciar, caused him to be disseised of the lands of William 1 Leland, Collectanea, I. 46 ; Benedict, Abbot of Peterborough, \" de Vita et Gestis Henrici II. et Ricardi I.\" ; Fosbroke, History of Gloucester shire, on the authority of a Register I.

John granted these to his \" serviens \" Noel, but the Abbot having petitioned, an Inquisition was held, and the property was restored on the 11th of May, 1203 (5 John).1 The Canons now were possessed not only of great landed property, but of considerable sources of revenue and enormous power, especially in the town and surrounding district, which they did not fail to use for their own ends, frequently in disregard of the rights of those who were less powerful than themselves. Allowance must, however, be made in passing judgment upon them for the times in which they lived ; for in an age when too often \" might constituted right \" neither life nor property were too secure : even monks and canons were not free from extortion and injustice at the hands of the sovereign, and they protected themselves against these by \" fines \" and frequent confirmations of existing charters from the reigning sovereign or from the popes and bishops, or by a similar course made good their claim where they either had none or where it was at least \" doubtful and obscure.\" In an agreement entered into between Abbot Hugh de Bampton (on behalf of the convent) and William de Stratforde concerning the Wood of Boicote, in Oxfordshire, with land and a mill appertaining to the same, the charter of Henry I. is given in full, and reference made to its confirmation by succeeding Kings and Popes Innocent II., Eugenius, Alexander, Innocent III., and Celestine.2 The Canons appear, however, to have sought the establishment of their claims by these means, more particularly in respect to the appropriation of churches ; by referring to the charter of foundation of Henry it will be seen that no less than seventeen parish churches, several dependent chapels, and the lands and immunities arising from the same, were granted to them ; in some cases they held the rectory of these churches, being entitled to the great tithes and all the revenues, and then they appointed their own vicar, who received the lesser tithes or a fixed sum from them for all services rendered. In other cases they may have held the advowson only, and received a pension or fixed payment from the secular priest in charge. Cheltenham Church is named as part of their possess ions, nevertheless, it was a subject of dispute, and the Archdeacon of Gloucester joined with others in questioning the right of Abbot Richard (A.D. 1199) to appoint his own vicar.3 Neither of the Cirencester churches or chapels are mentioned, although two-thirds \"of the tithes of the demesnes of Cirencester and the whole tithe of all the rest of the parish\" were granted to the Abbey. Mr. Fuller has very carefully considered the subject, but as he has shown it would be impossible to express 1 Longleat Cartulary, Ciren. Abb., Nos. 37 and 38. 2 Harleian MSS. 3 Placita Curi\u0153 Regis, Palgrave."], [78, "56 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. more than an opinion as to whether the Canons were entitled to appropriate them ; their right to do so was evidently not fully established even from their own point of view, but they appear to have asserted their claim and to have appointed a vicar from amongst themselves as early as the close of the twelfth century, and after much ill-feeling and some resistance on the part of the townsmen, extending over about a century and a half, eventually succeeded, in 1344, in obtaining from Edward III., upon payment to him of the sum of \u00a3300, the grant of the Church of St. John the Baptist and the Chapels of Baunton, Wiggewold, and St. Cecilia, the mastership of the Hospitals of St. John and St. Lawrence, and a confirmation of their right to the seven hundreds.1 The grant runs thus, as translated from the \" Originalia : \" \u2014 \" The King, on account of the devotion which he bears and has for the glorious Virgin Mary, in whose honor the Abbey of Cirencester was founded and endowed by his ancestors, and also in consideration of a fine of three hundred pounds (paid to him by the Abbot and Convent), has conceded and confirmed to the Abbot- and Convent of the said place that they and their successors shall have and hold to their own use the Church of St. John the Baptist of Cirencester, together with the Chapels of Baunton and of ' Wiggewold,' and of St. Cecilia and the Hospitals of St. John and St. Lawrence in the town of Cirencester, which were founded for the support of the poor, and which have been sustained by the alms of them, the said Abbot and Convent, and to which same hospitals the said.

Firstly, as to the order. We have stated that their constitution was based upon the assumed rule of Augustine for the guidance of monastic 1 In 7' E.

II., the King for the same amount disposed of the appropriation of the Church of Benefield, Berks."], [79, "57 ABBEY OF ST. MARY. orders, and it is supposed that having been established on the continent in the latter part of the eleventh century, that they were introduced into England first at Colchester in the year 1109. St. Frideswide's Monastery (now the Cathedral of Oxford) was commenced for the reception of regular canons in 1111. Cirencester and Carlisle Abbeys (the latter being now the Cathedral Church), both for the same order, were founded by Henry I., who also built the Benedictine Monastery at Reading ; Oseney, near Oxford, was founded in 1129; St. Augustine's, Bristol (now the Cathedral Church), in 1148; whilst Llanthony Priory, near Gloucester, Kenilworth, and Dunstable Priories were all large and important early Augustinian foundations. The \" canons regular \" were sometimes called \" black canons \" from the colour of their dress, which differed little from that of the Benedictine and some other monks. Like the monks they were celibates, and compelled to live in common ; they are not considered, however, to have been fettered by such strict observances, and were allowed either to shave the head or not at their discretion, and to let the beard grow. The following is extracted from Stevens's History of Abbeys, published in 1722 : \u2014 \" Their habit at all times was an albe reaching down to their heels and an amuce about the shoulders, like a cloak, and over both a black mantle to which was fastened a hood to cover their heads. The hood at length by degrees was made to extend downwards to their feet.\" Rudder says \" They wore a long black cassock, with a white rochet over it, and over all a black cloak ; they also wore beards.\" The hoods were used when walking out, but they were dispensed with or turned down when in the house, church, cloister, or chapter house. It appears that in course of time many of the canons became dissatisfied with the sombre hue of their dress, and adopted red, purple, and other coloured garments. A general conference of the order in England was held at Dunstable, Beds, in 1288, presided over by Henry de Hamptonel, Abbot of Cirencester, and the Prior of Kenilworth. We are not informed whether the changes of dress met with the approbation of the assembly. It is, however, stated, that the presiding officers recommend that no new course should be followed, but that the old statutes should continue to be observed,1 and it is certain that the \" apostolic see \" did not approve of these innovations of the \"regulars,\" for in 1339 Pope Benedict XII. drew up constitutions for their guidance, which he desired to have generally observed, and these are supposed to have been in force (see Stevens's Monasticon) amongst them long afterwards. Benedict commanded that no colours were to be worn except white, brown, black, or almost black, and Cardinal Wolsey determined the same in 1519, when he undertook the reform of the \" regulars \" in -England. 1 Annals of Dunstable."], [80, "58 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. Besides the Abbot, or head of the establishment, reference is made in certain documents to the following office-holders connected with the Cirencester Monastery, viz., the Prior, Sub-prior, Dean, Sacrist, Succentor, Cellarer, Vicar, or Chaplain of the Parish Church, Master of the Schools, and to the Custos, or Warden of the Hospital (of St. John).1 Besides these officers, there are mentioned in the Valor Ecclesiasticus, H. VIII., the Camerarius (or Chamberlain), Pietancier, Infirmarius, Almoner, Cook, Hostell arius, Master of the Chapel (of St. Mary or of St. Cecilia ,). The duties of some of these were as follows2 : \u2014 The Prior took the place of the Abbot in his absence, and on the death of each successive Abbot notified the same to the Bishop, and received instructions for the election of another by the Convent. The Sub-prior officiated in the absence of the Prior in the minor duties connected with his office, and generally assisted the Prior in the management of the Convent. The Dean or head of the Chapter. (As neither the Dean nor Sub-prior are men tioned in the Valor, the duties incident to their offices were probably performed by others.) The Succentor (or Precentor) took the direction of the choral service and the oversight of the scriptorium, where chiefly the novices were employed in copying works and in illuminating MSS., breviaries, and missals. Some of their illuminations are beautifully finished. The labour, however, expended upon their parchment deeds, statements of accounts, and other ordinary documents, can leave but one impression in this age of busy enterprise. They may be seen in most of our large public libraries and museums, and in the Harleian Collection in the British Museum. The office of the Cellarer was one of the greatest importance in the domestic management of the Convent. He had charge of all the granaries, cellars, &c, delivered out meal to the bakehouse, the ordinary provisions for the kitchen and cheese and liquors to the refectory, hay to the stables, and fuel for the hearths. He would of necessity have many servants under him. The Camerarius was overseer of the dormitories and the clothing, and had to provide \"for the accommodation of strangers while they lodged in the monastery.\" The Hospitelarius (or Hostellarius) presided in the great hall and entertained and attended on strangers. The Almoner distributed alms and loaves to the poor. The Pietancier was entrusted with the \" Pietanci\u00e6,\" or extraordinary allowances of more generous' aliment on holy-days, on the seven great festivals, and the anniversaries of founders and principal bene factors ; the live cattle were under his care. The Coquinarius, or Kitchener, bought the fresh provisions or fish for the Convent. The Infirmarius superintended the infirmary. The Tumberarius had the care of the tombs. The Sacrist had charge of the 1 Principally from a Cartulary of St. Peter's, Gloucester, 13th century. 2 See Green's Worcestershire, &c."], [81, "59 ABBEY OF ST. MARY. church, of the vestments of the priests, the incense, the furniture of the high altar, and other matters connected with the services, and to him were generally entrusted the funds for church building and the repairs of the fabric. The Novices studied in the cloisters, and when properly qualified were sent to the Universities. _ The office of the \" Magister Scolarum,\" or School master, requires no explanation. It may, however, interest especially our juvenile readers to state that not only were the subjects taught very different to those which now combine to form a thorough education, but the system of teaching has likewise greatly altered. The conviction is now becoming general that corporal punishment should only be exercised in exceptional circumstances, but in medi\u00e6val and even in recent times an undue prominence was given to classical studies, and the unfortunate youth who might have distinguished himself in the acquisition of physical and mathematical science was forced to attempt the composition of wretched hexameters and elegiacs by an unsparing use of the rod, not unfrequently attended with actual brutality. Whatever faults may, however, be found with the monastic system as entirely opposed to the spirit of freedom and enterprise of the present day, it is fair to state that in their age the monasteries were almost the sole repositories of learning (such as it was), and that the monks were generally not unmindful of the bodily wants and ailments of those around them. The \" hospitium \" of their convents always afforded a warm welcome to the weary traveller, and in many instances others besides the inmates of the convents were received into the infirmary, whilst they were not unfrequently called upon to provide a temporary home for those who were placed in a position to require their help. The books in the library of Cirencester Abbey in 1535 are thus given by Leland \u2014 Collectanea II. 158: \u2014 \"Alexander Necham, canonicus et abbas Cirecestrensis, super Psalterium (De orto deliciarum paradisi) ; \" \" Ailredi, abbatis Rivallensis, ad Ivonem liber .de lectione evangelica cum factus esset Jesus annorum duodecim ; \" \" Odonis, abbatis Muremudensis \u2014 liber de analecticis ternarii ; \" \" Beda super Esram ; \" \" Gloss\u0153 Galfredi Babionis super Matth\u00e6um;\" \"Alexander Necham de laude divin\u00e6 sapienti\u00e6 carmine \u2014 Gloria Majestas ; \" \" Roberti Canuti Crikeladensis, prioris S.

The study of the feasts and cookery of 500 years ago reveals the fact that the articles of food in daily use by the community at large were very different to those of the present day. Birds, chickens, hares, ii"], [82, "60 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. and rabbits were far more generally used than joints of meat. Fish, eels excepted, were only eaten in Lent. Potatoes unknown. Rice was so rare that it figured as a \" spice,\" but they used almost every edible green thing that grew. Pepper and cloves, onions and saffron, which appears to have supplied the place of salt, were largely used. Tea and coffee were of course unknown, but then the same may be said of ardent spirits; and whilst beer, for want of a better, was the common beverage at all meals, it was probably unadulterated. The monks were not allowed, however, to participate in all these, for according to the rules of the poor Carthusians, the strictest of all the religious orders, they were never allowed to taste flesh, and were restricted for one day of every week to bread, water, and salt. There were few Carthusians in Britain. In the cartulary of Cirencester Abbey at Longleat is the following gratuitous statement of the customs of the Canons. \" On the anniversaries of the Kings and Abbots, in whatever holiday they may happen, we eat flesh and drink wine twice, except (they happen) on solemn fast days. Besides, the Kings and Abbots on their anniversaries entertain a hundred paupers. Also, on the anniversaries of Reimbald, the Chancellor, we twice eat flesh and drink wine, unless the anniversary fall on a solemn fast.\" It is clear from the grant of Henry de Hamptonel to John de Latton that beer (and not water) was freely consumed daily in the Cirencester convent, and that the services of the cook were daily called in requisition for the preparation of no mean dishes. In the reservation of the grant of the site of the Abbey to Roger Bassinge by Henry VIII., it is expressly commanded that all the edifices within the site and precincts of the monastery should be pulled down and carted away, and the royal mandate was so punctually obeyed that Mr. Willis, writing at the com mencement of last century (about 170 years after), says \"there is not the least token else of an Abbey remaining\" (i.e., beyond the tradition that there were Abbatial buildings) ; \" all the materials of it are so wholly removed that the inhabitants cannot give any tolerable and satisfactory account of the site of the Church belonging to it. It stood, however, on the north side of the parish Church, which is a very large and handsome fabrick, the largeness of which made the pulling down of the Abbey the less lamented.\" The statement of Mr. Willis, however, is calculated to lead to a false impression amongst those who are not familiar with the Abbey estate, for although the church and conventual buildings had entirely disappeared before the time when Mr. Willis wrote, yet there was then standing of the Abbey buildings at least two gateways and a large barn, and one of the gateways, the Hospital or Spital gate in Grove lane, still remains in the year 1884. It consists of a bold carriage entrance, with Norman arches both entering and facing the Abbey grounds, and an entrance for foot passengers at the side of the carriage way; with"], [83, "61 ABBEY OF ST. MARY. arch on each of the opposite faces as the carriage entrance has. It is probably coeval with the Abbey Church re-erection by Henry I. Formerly the Whiteway, or road over Cerney Downs to Winchcombe and Tewkesbury, led from the town through it, but the original road was many years ago diverted as it approached the town. The Hospital gate stands in the line of the Roman wall, and many now living can recollect when a thick wall, similar in masonry and coping to that forming the Gosditch street boundary, extended along the stream eastward from the gate. This wall would have been the medi\u00e6val successor of the original Roman wall. In the lodge adjacent, following the same line, is what is now a partition wall, but it is considerably over four feet thick, and in the wall opposite is an ancient window-opening designed to admit a very meagre quantity of light. Rudder, in 1800, and Britton, in 1803, state that both the gateways and the barn were standing, but the other gate, which stood in Dollar street, and was known as the \" Emery,\" properly the Almery or Dolehall gate, must have been pulled down very soon afterwards. No one now living has any recollection of it, but about fifteen years ago a sketch and description of it was given to the author's father by an old inhabitant, from personal recollection, and it appears that it resembled the Hospital gate, except that it had rooms ov%r, used as a dwelling.1 It had become very much dilapidated before its removal. It is strange that Mr. Willis should have been able to come to no more definite conclusion than the \"unquestionable fact\" that the Church of the Abbey stood on the \" north \" side of the present Parish Church. Sir R. Atkyns, who was a resident in the neighbour hood, and acquainted with Willis, writing in 1712, says positively that the Abbey House was the \" scite \" of the Abbey. The present Abbey House was built in 1776 (according to Bigland, who wrote his history only five years later) on the \" foundation \" of the previous mansion. Several capitals, portions of columns, some of which are now to be seen at the Spitalgate lodge, as well as a portion of fan tracery and other relics of the Abbey buildings, have been dug up from time to time in the Abbey grounds, and from a personal inspection of the foundations of the present mansion, through the kindness of T. W. C. Master, Esq., we have no doubt that they belong principally to the conventual buildings, an opinion which seems to have been held by the late renowned architect, Mr. Wyatt, who a few years ago enlarged and restored the house, and was very careful to retain an old entrance doorway in the cellars, then brought to light. Kip's drawing (1712), published in Atkyns' work, like some others of his productions, is not in all points reliable, as for the sake of effect he has substituted for the old massive stone wall, 1 A description occurred about the same date in one of the Annual Directories of Cirencester."], [84, "HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. which then as now enclosed the estate on the Gosditch-street side, a much lower wall. It is, however, noteworthy, that whilst the house, judging by the Parish Church, seems to be placed too near Gosditch-street, yet that it is made to stand immediately opposite a gateway in the wall. The quoins of this gateway, which has almost unquestionably existed from before the dissolution of the Monastery, are still to be seen, although the space has been filled in with masonry, and an examination of the plan (as prepared from the dimensions given by William of Worcester) will show the probability of this gate being the western entrance to the Abbey Church ; likewise the extraordinary agreement of the walls of the house with the dimensions given of the Abbey Church; that the walls of the mansion are almost exactly \u25a0parallel to those of the Parish Church, and that if the plan be correct, the Cloisters of the Abbey as well as the Church and Conventual Buildings were just outside the Borough boundaries, possibly as fixed in the time of Henry IV. In the recent pro longation of the servants' wing, it is fair, however, to add that no traces of the chapter house foundations were brought to light. It is extremely improbable that the Church was built much further eastwards than indicated. William of Worcester, visiting Cirencester, in 1460, writes as follows in his Itinerary : \u2014 Longitudo magn\u00e6 ecflesi\u00e6 ordinis See.

And there is buried the Hart of Sentia Wife to Richard King of [the] Romanis and Erie of Cornwalle.\" It will be seen that the particulars given are\" scarcely adequate for the preparation of even an approximately correct plan, and in attempting to conjecture the ground plan given in this work, it is right to state the principles upon which we have been guided. Firstly, we have the entire internal length of the body of the church and the choir amounting to 140 gressus. The gressus or step, from the ratio given in the quoted description of William of Worcester, and in that which he gives of the existing parochial church, may be taken at 21 inches, or about the length of the ancient cubit. (Why Rudder says two feet is a mystery.) This gives the internal length as 245 feet, but to this must be added the chapel at the eastern end of the choir (occupying the usual position of a Lady Chapel in most of our Cathedrals) ; the length of this which William of Worcester had taken is unfortunately not known through the MS. being imperfect. It was almost unquestionably built at the time of the erection of the Abbey, and therefore Norman in character, with probably a semi-circular apsidal end, which would extend certainly beyond the eastern termination of the Lady Chapel and aisles.1 On this assumption, and taking it as a fair average length for chapels, thus placed it might measure sixty feet in length in the clear, and adding this with five feet additional for the thickness of the choir eastern wall to the 245 feet before mentioned, we obtain a total interior length of 310 feet. The 1 Messrs Brayley and Britton, in \"Beauties of England and Wales,\" published 1803, coincide with our opinion previously expressed that the earliest parts of the Abbey were in the Saxon style."], [86, "64 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. exterior length, buttresses included, would be twenty or twenty five more, or upwards of 330 feet. Leland mentions the transept, but whether it was a transept without aisles as in the Cathedrals of Canterbury, Gloucester, Worcester, &c, with one aisle as in Salisbury, Lincoln, Peterborough, &c, or with two aisles as in York, Wells, Winchester, Ely, and Beverley Minster, we are not informed. We have assumed that it had one aisle only. Neither are we given the relative lengths of the nave and chancel, and the only means by which we can arrive at any conclusion are, firstly, from the average proportional lengths in other churches ; secondly, from the dimensions of the cloisters ; and thirdly, from the length and .position of the lady chapel. In the majority of. Cathedrals and Conventual Churches the cloisters, for the sake of warmth and shelter, were placed on the south of the nave, but in Canterbury, Gloucester, and some other examples, they are on the opposite side, and from the proximity of the Abbey to the Parish Church, the positions of the Almery and Hospital gates, as well as of the Abbot's (now Coxwell) street, it seems almost certain that the cloisters, chapter house, and conventual buildings of Cirencester Abbey were on the north side of the church, as in Gloucester and Canterbury. The description of the Chapter House leaves much to the imagination, especially as a part of William of Worcester's MS. is lost ; the first part of his statement, as given in Rudder and subsequent historians, would convey the idea of a rectangular 'room 42' 0\" x 30' 0\", but the latter part evidently shows that it was polygonal, and we can find no figure which appears to meet the brief account except that of a regular decagon with rectangular entrance from the cloisters. All the polygonal chapter houses of the English Cathedrals are regular figures, except that of Lichfield, which is an elongated octagon, and even in this the exterior angles are set out to 135\u00b0, or the true angle of the octagon. The term \" pana \" or \" pane \" was formerly used for the side of a turret, spire, or other building, and the probability is that the sectional plan of the roof of the chapter house was that of a true decagon, and that all its sides met as a spire in a central apex. The \" six panes \" having stained glass windows were probably those forming the apsidal termination, and the three \" orbs,\" or blank recesses to each \" pane,\" were of course below the windows, and formed an arcade round the inner face of the walls, terminating probably on a continuous plinth, and serving as seats for the members of the chapter, this being an arrange ment frequently followed. The eastern end would be occupied by the Abbot and other dignitaries, and this part was frequently raised. It has been suggested that the polygonal form for chapter houses was suggested by the round churches of the Knights Templars, the earlier chapter houses being rectangular in plan, and Lincoln, the earliest example of a polygonal one extant,"], [87, "ABBEY OF ST. MARY. 65 having been completed in the year 1200. It is therefore almost certain that the chapter house of Cirencester Abbey was not a part of the original work of Henry's time, but, like the best examples of its kind, erected in the 13th or 14th centuries. The Conventual Buildings generally consisted of the library, muniment room, the refectory or great hall, the dormitory, the kitchen and domestic offices with other lesser apartments, besides the infirmary, and the hospitium for poor travellers and pilgrims, which were frequently detached, the latter building belonging to Worcester Cathedral Priory measured 50' x 20', and its dormitory 120' x 60', being a lofty room with a stone roof with a range of beds on either side, at first open, then divided off for each monk. The abbot probably had a private residence in the town. _ No mention is made of a tower, but the erection of one at the intersection of the body of the church and the transepts was usual in all crucifofm structures, although in Westminster Abbey and Winchester Cathedral they are only carried up sufficiently high to receive the gables of the roofs abutting against them. From the fact that William of Worcester gives the height of the tower of the Parish Church, whilst no mention is made of that of the Abbey, we might infer that it was in this respect deficient. On the other hand, the tower of the Parish Church, then a recent erection of great beauty rising from the ground, would call for special notice, and it seems improbable that Abbot Lekhampton and his canons should have expended a large amount upon the parochial Church in the erection of its present stately tower had their own Abbey been without. Besides, William of Worcester tells us that in 1238 certain bells were consecrated at Cirencester, which probably belonged to the Abbey rather than to the Parish Church, the present tower not having been built until nearly 200 years later. The inmates of the convents having only a life interest in their possessions naturally expended a large portion of their revenue upon their churches and buildings, and thus they were almost continually engaged in the work of restoration. Their funds from the commencement of the fifteenth century down to the very eve of the Reformation appear to have been largely devoted to the Parish Church, and at the period of William of Worcester's visit the rebuilding of its nave and aisles was not only in contemplation but, by the erection of Trinity Chapel and the eastern bays of the south aisle, may be even said to have been commenced. Leland states that the \" west part \" of the Abbey Church \" from the transept is but new worke to speke of;\" we should be disposed, however, to conclude that as it is extremely improbable that the body of the Abbey Church and that of the Parish Church should have been rebuilt at the same time, aud as William does not mention any re-erection of the Abbey, which he probably would had it been very recently executed, that Leland means"], [88, "66 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. that the western part was new work compared with the eastern end, and it would not improbably be a restoration of the fourteenth century, at a time when the original work of Henry I. might be considered to need replacement. Some remains of capitals, shafts of columns, &c, are still preserved, partly attri butable to this era or the preceding century, and partly Norman. Portions of fan tracery roofing, exactly corresponding with that over the roof of St. Catherine's Chapel in the Parish Church, have been dug up in the Abbey grounds, and it is considered that this roofing, which at the Reformation was brought from the Abbey Church and placed in its present position for preser vation, originally formed a portion of the roof of the Abbey cloisters. The initials of Abbot John Hakeborne, 1508, with those of Thomas Ruthall, Bishop of Durham, are several times repeated, as well as certain royal devices, so that there are grounds for the inference that the cloister was re-vaulted at that date. The \" St. Amands \" were lords of the manor of North Cerney. Almaric, Knight of St. Amand, died seized of Preston, &c, in 1385, and Almaric (the younger?) of South Cerney, &c. in 1403. The presbytery was the raised eastern part of the choir in which the priests ministered at the high altar, as distinguished from the choir proper, which was fitted with stalls. Burial in this most sacred portion (as it was esteemed) of the edifice was only accorded as a mark of especial honour, and generally to those who had contributed largely to the funds of the monastery or to the erection or embellishment of the church itself. Senchia was the daughter of Beatrix, countess of Provence, and sister of the queens of France and England. Her husband was brother of Henry III., and is said to have founded Hayles Abbey, near Winchcombe. At her marriage a sumptuous feast was held in Westminster Hall, at which 30,000 dishes are said to have been placed on the table. She lived a century earlier than the Knights of St. Amand, but both may have contributed to the Abbey. Some of the Hungerfords were buried in the Lady Chapel. Reference is made to a water course in Henry I.'s charter. In the account of Oseney Abbey, near Oxford (Stevens' History of Abbies), it is stated that water was brought to it by pipes, and in the cloisters of Gloucester Cathedral are the remains of a lavatory for the ablutions of the priests. We should not omit to state that there existed as late as last century at Cayforde, near Frome, the remains of a nunnery said to have belonged to Cirencester Abbey. It has been suggested that the Abbot possessed, in common with many of the other great ecclesiastics, the privilege of coining money. It appears that in early Saxon times authority was given to the Archbishops, Bishops, and certain Abbots to strike money and to receive the profits therefrom. Athelstan (925-941)"], [89, "J,Beeoha.m,Delt"], [90, ""], [91, "67 ABBEY OF ST. MARY. confirmed this privilege, but enacted that all money should be uniform throughout the kingdom, and that it should be struck within a town, and, according to \" The Silver Coins of England,\" by E. Hawkins, it was not until the reigns of the three first Edwards that the privileged prelates adopted the use of mint marks or letters to distinguish their respective coinage. Several brass pieces have at different times been dug up within the precincts of the Abbey of this character, and one found in the Abbey Gardens, in 1772, had on one side three rams' heads (part of the arms of the Abbey), and round them the inscription AVE . MARIA . GRACIA . PLEN. On the reverse\u2014 a cross flory between four fleurs-de-lis, with the letters G . A . G . A . round the quarters, evidently intended for George\u2014 Abbas, William George being Abbot from 1445 to 1461. : There are brass pieces extant of Ruthall, bishop of Durham. An impression of the common seal of the Abbey, attached to the deed of acknowledgment of the King's Supremacy, in 1534, was preserved in the chapter house at Westminster, but is now removed to the Public Record Office. It is very imperfect, but represents two figures, a male and a female, seated, and in conversation, with the legend, \" S. Ecclesi\u00e6, Sancti Marie, Cirencestrie.2 The arms of the Abbey, still preserved in the Parish Church, were Gules, on a chevron argent, three rams' heads caboshed sable, attired or. The Abbot of Cirencester held Crinklewood, containing 30 acres, 9 E. II., and Walter Wrilock granted two messuages, one toft, 26 acres, a yard land, four acres of meadow, with other minor bequests, to the Abbey, 13 E. II.3 The Abbey also procured some few additional landed possessions in other places, but a comparison of the Valor Ecelesiasticus with the original charter of Henry I. will show that except for the liberal bequests of his immediate successors, their landed property was not greatly augmented afterwards. The goods of the Abbot in the parish of St. Martin Ludgate, City of London, where it is supposed that the Abbot had a town residence, were valued in the spiritual taxation of Pope Nicholas, in 1291, at the low estimate of one mark, and in the parish of St. Bridget at \u00a33 7s. 3d., making a total of \u00a34 Os. 7d.4 An old building at Rodmarton, delineated in Lysons' Gloucestershire Antiquities, has been supposed to have been a residence of the Abbot, but no mention is made of it in the Valor Ecelesiasticus. After the basis of constitutional government had been laid by the exertions of Simon de Montfort and the baronial party, the Abbots received summonses to attend the councils of the nation, once during the reign of Henry III., viz., in 1265, seven times in 1 Rudder's History of Cirencester, 2 Dugdale's Monasticon. 3 Rudder. 4 Harleian MS. 60. I"], [92, "68 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. that of Edward I., twenty-one times in Edward II., fifty-four times in Edward III., twelve times in Richard H., eight times in Henry IV, also in 1413, 1414, and 1415,1 but it is stated that it was not until the year 1416 that the Abbot had a stated seat in Parliament as a baronial lord,2 when William Best obtained for himself aqd his successors the mitre and pontificals. We find, however, both before and after this time, the Abbots taking part in many important events of national interest.3 A writ of \" Quo warranto,\" as it appears from the Hundred Rolls,3 was issued against the Abbot in the reign of Edward I., to show his right to the manor and seven hundreds of Cirencester. Rudder suggests that this was simply \"a vexatious proceeding not unfrequently in use to extort money from the subject for new grants, which were thought necessary in those days, when by casualties in the civil wars or otherwise, any of the possessor's deeds and evidences happened to be lost or destroyed.\"4 We are ready to admit that the kings of those days were not always so scrupulous as they might have been in their means of raising money, and that as in the case of the grant of parish churches, &c, by Edward III., privileges were to be purchased and the rights of those who were too weak to defend themselves or to maintain their own cause ignored ; but in the instance under consideration, during the turbulent reign of Henry III. and the absence of Edward in the Holy Land, the royal rights had been usurped by both the nobles and ecclesiastics, who were also continually extorting payments from the people, and the Hundred Roll Inquisitions were for the express purpose of remedying these injustices and recouping the diminished revenues of the Crown.5 The Abbot sustained his 1 List of Summonses in Appendix to Dugdale's Monasticon, extracted from the Clause Rolls and List of Summonses in the Tower of London. Simon de Montfort assembled the barons and ecclesiastics of his own party to a Parliament in 1264. It is probable that the Abbot of Cirencester, who was a direct tenant of the crown, did not venture to ally himself with them. The Parliament to which he was summoned by Henry III. was the first held after de Montfort was slain and the Parliamentarians defeated at Evesham, in August, 1264. 2 This statement of Rudder's, Hist. Cir., p. 91, seems inconsistent with the previous summonses to Parliament, which were as numerous before William Best's time as afterwards. In the Parliament of 1265 only 25 lay barons were summoned, but 102 abbots and priors. In 1 E. II. (1307-8), the number of abbots and priors had fallen to 56, in 4 E. III. (1331-2) to 33, and in Henry VII. 's reign only 28 monasteries were thus privileged, whereof four, viz., Gloucester, Tewkesbury, Winchcombe, and Cirencester, were in this county. 3 See particulars of Abbots. 4 Rudder's History of Cirencester. 5 The Abbot was stated by the King's Inquisitors to have withdrawn certain customary dues, at Bray and Cookham, Berks, amongst other places, and to have usurped the rights of the King elsewhere. As an example, in the Hundred of Cookham the Abbot's bailiff had ceased to respond at the assize of bread and beer, &c, to pay the customary due of"], [93, "ABBEY OF ST. MARY. 69 right to the Hundreds, and was certified to hold the manor and hundreds \" ad feod firmam \" of the King for \u00a330 per annum by charter of King Richard I. In the matter of their value, the Abbot and Convent knew how to keep their own counsel, and all that the Inquisitors could ascertain in this respect was that the thinly peopled Hundred of Bradley was worth five marks or \u00a33 6s. 8d. per annum. For the values of each Hundred, &c, temp. H. VIII. see copy of Valor Ecelesiasticus. The King was entitled to claim from the Convent a certain allowance of meat, drink, and clothing, and this was called the \" corrody \" of Cirencester, and the benefits therefrom were granted at the royal pleasure (generally for life) to a person of his choosing. In 1484-5, it is stated that \" Thomas Patyke, of the chapell, hath the corrody of Cirencester by the death of Forster,\"1 and November 2nd, 1509, the same corrody then lately held by William Slater deceased was granted to Anthony Legh, chief clerk of the (? King's) kitchen,1 and the revenues of the same office held by William Merryman in 1524 were granted to Henry Conway, clerk of the signet. At a much earlier date, Edward (II. 1) writes to the Abbot and Convent to provide food, clothing, and necessaries to John de Horsle in the place of John Gomage (deceased). Each Abbot on receiving the restitution of temporal ities at his appointment paid the King a customary pension, which was handed over to a clerk or priest of the King's choice, to be enjoyed by him until the Abbot should have a vacant benefice to present to the person so nominated.2 The lands and possessions of the Abbess of the Nunnery of the newly elected \"de Cadamo,\" at Hampton, were distrained upon for her neglecting to pay the customary due. Previous to the grant of Richard I. to the Abbey the inhabitants of Cirencester had in common with other burgesses paid a tallage or aid for the execution of the King's works, the amount of which two years before was \u00a310, but it is not certain whether this sum was an annual or an occasional levy. The Abbot, by virtue of his right to the manor and seven hundreds, appears to have levied a corresponding impost upon the townsmen, and was sued by the King in 1314-15 on account thereof, but, pleading the charter of Richard, appears to have maintained his claim to collect tallage for his own works. The thirty pounds \" by tale \" (that is, in common currency instead of by weight, which was sometimes required on account two shillings at the view of frankpledge, to keep watch, and to entertain the bailiffs of the King on the \"day of pannage.\" The latter had been discontinued in the time of Henry I., therefore from the date of the foundation of the Abbey. 1 Harleian MS., 433 ; Brewer's State Papers, H.

Amongst the occasional outgoings are recorded an aid of fifty pounds by the Abbot in 1436 for the equipment of an army to France; forty pounds in 1379 and again in 1443 for the King's wars; and in 1454, in answer to an earnest appeal by the King's council, addressed to about sixty lay and ecclesiastical peers, for men and money to defend the town of Calais, in which the King calls to their \" remembrance what a jewell the said towne of Calais is to this our reame,\" it would appear probable that some of the youth of Cirencester were dispatched by Abbot George, as they had been in the reign of the first Edward, for the war with Scotland.3 In 1136 (immediately after the institution of the Monastery), Pope Innocent conferred on the Canons the usual privilege of exemption from attendance at espiscopal synods, except by one Canon, who was to report to his associates on his return what the Bishop or his delegate had said. Savaricus, Bishop of Bath and Wells, about 1198, offered Abbot Richard to constitute the rectory of Milborne Port (Somersetshire), and part of the Abbot's possessions, into a prebend in the Cathedral of Wells, to be enjoyed by the Abbot and his successors, but the offer was not accepted.4 After the Norman Conquest, the power of the bishops over the monastic orders had very materially decreased, and the monks were determined to resist every attempt at interference by their spiritual overseers, unless it appeared to be to their manifest advantage. The dispute between Archbishop Baldwin and the monks of Canterbury referred to (page 21) is a striking instance of this. Gewase, who was one of their number, represents the Archbishop as tyrannical, but contemporaneous history depicts Baldwin as an enlightened man for his time, and proves the monks to have been exceedingly troublesome, and as determined to resist all authority (lay as 'well as secular), and to appeal only to that of the holy see. The Bishops claimed the right of visitation, by themselves or Archdeacons, but to this the Monks 1 Rudder ; Rymer. Foedera, &c, vol. ii., p. 854. a Rotuli Originalii, 13 E.

In 1301, during the abbacy of Henry de Hamptonel, the Monks of Gloucester, Tewkesbury, and Winch combe, and the Canons of Cirencester, opposed the visitation of their Convents by the Prior of Worcester, and in October, 1315, in the time of \" brother Adam \" Brokenbury, the Abbots and Convents of St. Peter, at Gloucester, and of St. Mary, at Cirencester, and the Priors and Convents of St. Mary, Worcester, and St. Mary, Lanthony (near Gloucester), entered into a very lengthy agreement to support 'each other in the resistance of any visitation either by the Bishop or his delegates, and to subscribe to a common fund to be kept in a chest under the charge of the Sub-prior at Gloucester (each of the Sub-priors to have a key of the same), and each being bound upon oath taken upon \" the most holy relics \" to give up the money under their charge when required to meet any civil consequences that might ensue. A proctor was likewise appointed by the chapter of each \" house \" to see after its interests.1 Connected with the action of the religious houses in this matter may have been a personal dislike to the Bishop of the diocese (Worcester), for only a few months before (8 Edward II.) he was charged with interfering with the Abbot's bailiffs, who were engaged in obtaining the return of the King's writs in his own manors of Withington and Bibury, which were included, however,- in the Abbot's seven hundreds' jurisdiction.2 What the result of the resistance of the respective Abbots and Priors to the Bishop may have been does not appear, but the Harleian MS., Vol. 431, No. 44, contains a lengthy letter from Philip Morgan,3 Bishop of Worcester (1419-25), addressed to Abbot Best, complaining of the conduct of his canons in refusing admittance to his (the Bishop's) officers at their customary visitation. If the mass of the people, especially in our villages, during the middle ages, were groaning under the yoke of feudalism and feudal lords, the great ecclesiastics of those times wielded an influence far greater by the union of baronial privileges with sacerdotal pretensions. About the year 1269, a resident family of means commenced at Maidenhead (or Maidenhuth), then a hamlet in the parishes of Bray and Cookham, the churches of which belonged to Cirencester Abbey, to erect a chapel. The vicars of these two parishes objecting, appealed to ecclesiastical tyranny to interfere, but the building was completed in spite of an Episcopal interdict and the threat of excommunication against any one celebrating Divine 1 Annals of Worcester ; Cartulary Mon.

In 1310 some attempt was made to adjust differences, without success. Nothing more .appears to have been attempted until 1324, when the people of Maidenhead, having satisfied the proprietors of Bray and Cookham churches, Roger de Mortival, Bishop of Salisbury, successfully appealed to his Metropolitan to revoke the interdicts of his predecessors, and after some trouble, it was arranged that the interested parties, including the Vicars of Bray and Cookham, the Abbot and Convent of Cirencester, and the inhabitants of Maidenhead should, by their proctors, attend the next visitation, and submit to the Bishop's decree. This was done, and it was ordered that \" Divine service, including the whole Mass, but excluding Sacra mental offices (Baptism of Children being especially forbidden), might be celebrated for the benefit of the inhabitants and wayfarers, without prejudice to the parochial churches, the inhabitants to bear the entire cost of the maintenance of the chapel and its priest.\" A somewhat amusing and more just instance of the exercise of ecclesiastical authority than the Maidenhead case is the suspension of Richard de Cirencester, in 1232, by the Bishop of Worcester, for seizing a deacon by the hair in St. James's Church, Bristol.2 In the \" History of Cirencester,\" published by Mr. Savory, in 1858, is given an agreement between Abbot Hugh de Bampton and Elias, lord of the manor of Brimpsfield, in which the hundred rights of the former and the manorial rights of the latter are particularly defined. We append below a translation of another, couched in almost precisely the same language (given in Latin in Stevens's Monasticon), between the same Abbot(Hugh de Bampton) and Wymare, or Wimare, Prioress of Lacock, concerning the rights of both parties within the parish of Hatherop.

A record is preserved of the method of procedure at Waltham Cross.1 Henry II., having determined to dissolve the ancient prebendal college in this place the year after his visit to Cirencester, caused the secular canons and their dean to attend before him at Waltham. The dean handed the keys to the Archbishop in the King's presence. Opposite to the secular canons were seated the regulars, viz., six from Cirencester, six from Osney, and six from another convent, and permission having been given to choose their own officers, they were duly installed as members of their new home. On June 7th, 1218, Abbot Walter attended the re-dedication of Worcester Cathedral Church, which had been rebuilt in consequence of a great fire in 1203. Henry III. was present, and Sylvester, of Evesham, who died a few weeks later, officiated.2 On September 18, 1239, Abbot Hugh attended a similar ceremony at St. Peter's (now the Cathedral of) Gloucester. And we are informed respecting it that Bishop Walter de Cantelupe3 granted to the monks of Gloucester forty days of \" relaxation \" or release from certain monastic obligations, and that the anniversary of the day should be observed by all people in Gloucester solemnly as a Sunday (dies dominicus), and that the \" relaxation \" or indulgence should each year last for fifteen days.4 From the Cirencester Cartulary, at Longleat, it appears that the canons observed the anniversary of Reimbald, to whom 1 Gervase of Canterbury. 2 Green's History of Worcester ; Annals of Worcester. 3 Walter de Cantelupe, Bishop of Worcester, 1237-68, opposed the overbearing power of the Pope, joined the barons against Henry III., and was excommunicated in consequence, but afterwards reinstated and translated to the bishopric of Worcester. 4 Cartulary Mon.

In the first year of Henry IV., the townsmen, who had just distinguished themselves in their fidelity to this monarch in the assistance they had rendered in suppressing the insurrection of the Earls of Kent and Salisbury,1 appealed for a strict inquisition to be issued against the Abbot for the usurpation of certain rights in the town and seven hundreds.2 The case was adjourned from time to time, and little would perhaps have come out of it had not the King felt it incumbent upon him to reward them for their signal services, and, accordingly, he granted the townsmen a charter which released them to a certain extent from the control of the Abbot.3 The Abbot, John Leckhampton, could not withstand the King's pleasure, but there was evidently no very good feeling existing between him and them, and they rioted against him in the first year of Henry V.,4 and, if we rightly understand Fosbroke, there must have been subsequent disturb ances of a similar nature not long before the outbreak in Gloucester in the early part of the sixteenth century. The unpopularity of the \" religious \" was not confined to this town or neighbourhood ; efforts were made by the temporal lords to circumscribe their power, and the growing influence,, of the burgesses of the trading towns was directed to the attainment of the same object. In the reign of King Henry IV., and that of King Henry V., were two several attempts upon the temporal possessions of the church ; which were in great measure set aside by Archbishop Arundel and Archbishop Chicheley, though in the second year of the last mentioned reign, the parliament, held at Leicester, gave all the alien priories to the King, with their lands and houses, except such as were conventual. In the succeeding reigns, the monks grew more and more disliked by the laity, who had been witnesses to the loose and vicious lives which some of them led, and this eventually culminated in the reformation in the reign of King Henry VIII. By an act of parliament in the 27th year of that reign, all monasteries not having \u00a3200 a-year were dissolved, and all their lands, rents, and houses, with their flocks of cattle, corn, and other effects, given to the King. And in the 31st year of the same reign, all the great abbeys, nearly 200 in 1 The bodies of these unfortunate noblemen were interred in the Abbey but were afterwards removed, that of the Earl of Kent the following year, to the Priory of Montgrace, county of York, and of the Earl of Salisbury after a lapse of twenty years, to the Abbey of Bustlesham, Berks. \u2014 Browne Willis's Mitred Abbeys. 2 Nicolas's Proceedings, &c, of Privy Council ; Cott.

The next year, the houses, lands, and goods of the knights of St. John of Jerusalem were seized by the crown ; as were 90 colleges, 110 hospitals, and 2,370 chantries and free chapels, in the 37th year of that reign, which put a final period to the monastic state in this kingdom. In this general wreck fell the Abbey of Cirencester, which was surrendered to the King's Commissioners, December 29th, 1539. Its annual revenues, of which fuller particulars may be found in the Valor Ecelesiasticus, and in a published Abstract of a Roll, 32 H. VIII., in the Augmentation Office, amounted in the gross to \u00a31156 9s. 94d., and to \u00a31051 7s. l\u00a3d. net income\u2014 a large amount in those days, and thus proving it to have been one of the richest religious houses in the kingdom, exceeded in fact only by the following: \u2014 Gloucester, valued at \u00a31946 5s. 9d ; Tewkesbury, valued at \u00a31598 Is. 3d. ; Westminster, at \u00a33471 Os. 2^d. ; Glastonbury, at \u00a33311 7s. 4\u00b1d. (the two highest assessments) ; Reading, Abingdon, Ely, Shaftesbury, St. Cuthbert, St. Swithin (Winchester), St. Albans, Ramsey, St. Augustine's (Canterbury), Croyland, St. John of Jerusalem, St. Stephen's College (Westminster), Spon, Peterborough, St. Edmund's Bury, Worcester Cathedral Priory, Evesham, and St. Mary's (.Beverley). Gloucestershire, next to Middlesex and Yorkshire, possessed of greater monastic wealth than any English county, contained, besides fhose already named, Winchcombe Abbey, assessed at \u00a3759 11s. 9d.; Hayles, \u00a3357 7s. 8d. ; Bristol (St. Augustine's), \u00a3670 13s. lid.; Lanthony Priory, \u00a3648 19s. llfd. The incomes thus returned, however, do not represent the full wealth of the monasteries, which were much richer than would appear from the rent roll of the estates; for it was the practice to let them at their first rates, though the value of lands was much enhanced ; and instead of raising rents, they exacted great fines from their tenants upon the renewal of leases ; so that some houses rated only at \u00a3200 a-year, were really worth many thousands. The valued rent of the abbey lands, as they were then let, was \u00a3132,607 6s. 4d., but this was not one tenth of the real value. The King had then in his hands the greatest advantage that ever King of England had. The people were given to understand, that with all this wealth, the kingdom should be strengthened with an army of 40,000 men, the navy put on a more respectable footing, and that, for the future, they should never be charged with subsidies, loans, or common aids. But such was the King's extravagance, that all this melted away in a few years, and the people were disappointed in their expectations. The following list of Abbots is corrected from Mr. Willis's list by comparison with Harleian MS., 7520, and the references to the Abbots in other works : \u2014 1. Serlo, fourth dean of Sarum, appointed first abbot, 1131, when the king dissolved the old institution, and, dying 1142 or"], [101, "77 ABBEY OF ST. MARY. 1147 (Harleian MS.), was succeeded by 2. Andrew, who died December 27th, 1176, and had for his successor 3. Adam, prior of Bardney, consecrated 1177, and died 1183. 4. Robert, canon of Cirencester, followed, and, dying within a few months, the canons chose 5. Another Robert, upon whose death, in 1185 (Harleian) or 1187 (Willis), 6. Richard, prior of St. Gregorie's, Canterbury, was appointed. Either at or shortly after his investiture, Henry II. was again a visitor to the Abbey, in company with Archbishop Baldwin, and received the deputation of the Canterbury monks. This abbot appears to have looked sharply after the interests of his monastery. He received from Richard I. the grant of the manor and seven hundreds ; additional charters from John, whom he twice enter tained ; established, by the process of \" fines,\" his claim to the rectory of Eston, Berks, and to a mill and lands, at Hakeborne, in the same county.1 Afterwards, he got into a dispute with the Archdeacon of Gloucester, respecting the appropriation of Cheltenham church, and the appointment thereto of his curate William as vicar, and, dying in 1213,2 was succeeded by 7. Alexander Nequam3 (or Neccham), the most celebrated of all the Abbots, of whom a short further account is given in the appendix. In 1216, during his time, Gerard de \u00c6tries disseized the abbey of the seven hundreds, but King John renewed the grant.4 Neccham died in 1217,5 and had for his successor 8. Walter, or, as some accounts incorrectly have it, Richard. He was present, June 7th, 1218, at the re-dedication of Worcester cathedral; witnessed, amongst other lords (spiritual and temporal), the confirmation of Magna Charta by Henry III., in 1225 ;6 entertained Pandulph, the Pope's legate, in 1220; and, in 1230, the year in which he died, was proceeded against by the Arch deacon of Gloucester, for appropriating the churches of Cirencester and Cheltenham.7 9. Hugh de Bampton (incorrectly described8 as \" Henry \" and \"de Bathon\" and \"de Baudington,\" received the benediction at Worcester, Christmas-day, in the same year.

In 1249, he succeeded in obtaining from the Bishop of Worcester (through the archdeacon of Gloucester, who had held an Inquisition in the chapter-house of Cirencester), a confirmation of the canon's claim to the parish church and dependent chapelries,1 and, dying the following year2 (or as incorrectly stated by Rudder 1238), was succeeded by 10. Roger de Rodmarton, who renewed lease of land at Boicote to William de Stratforde's son, in 1264 ; was snmmoned to the first parliament following Simon de Montfort's rebellion ; and, dying in 1266, 11. Henry de Munden became abbot. To his election the king consented October 11th, the same year. He was summoned to Parliament 1272-3 ; entered into an agreement with the abbot of Gloucester relative to markets' rents, at Northleach, within his hundreds' jurisdiction.3 On behalf of his vicars, archbishop Robert Kilwardby, in 1277, took steps to prevent ministrations in Maidenhead church, and, in the same year, confirmed the canons in the parish church of Cirencester.4 When this abbot died is uncertain, but, in 1281, 12. Henry de Hamptonel was made abbot.6 Agreements extant between him and Reginald, abbot of Gloucester, re Eastleach (1295) ; also with John de Latton (1305).

His death occurred November 2nd, 1307, eleven days after which 13. Adam Brokenbury was elected abbot. He resisted, in concert with the heads of Gloucester, Worcester, and Lanthony convents, the bishop's visitation, and, dying in '1320,7 (Harleian MS.), was succeeded by 14. Richard de Charleton, who must have entertained Edward II., at Christmas, 1321. A few years later, the weakness and effeminacy of this monarch (as is well known) caused him to be deserted by all classes, and it appears that abbot Richard de Charleton was no exception, for it is stated in the Collectanea 1 Rev.

Ten months later witnessed his cruel death at Berkeley castle. On Richard de Charleton's resignation, in 1334, 15. William Hereward was made abbot. In 1344, he obtained the royal confirmation of the appropriation of Cirencester church, the hospitals, and dependent chapelries, in consideration of a payment of \u00a3300 ; and, in 1347, for \u00a320, that of Benefield church, Berks.1 On behalf of the king, the year after the award, he was instructed to pay the \u00a3300 to Henry of Lancaster; and was about the same time called in question by the king's esch\u00e6tor for Wilts, relative to his right to certain land at Cricklade.2 He died April 25th, 1352. 16. Ralph de Estcote (or de Estestu) followed. He died in 1357, and was succeeded by 17. William de Marteley (or de Martelege). At his death, in 1361, 18. William de Dinton was appointed. His abbacy only extended over two years, for, in 1363, 19. Nicholas de Ameney3 (or Richard de Ameney) occurs as abbot. He died in 1394, and had for his successor 20. John de Lekhampton, during whose time the tower of the parish church was built. The Earls of Kent and Salisbury were beheaded by the townsmen (1400). The townsmen entered a suit against the abbot about 1400, and in 1404 were relieved from the abbot's control. In 1413-14, however, they rioted against the abbey. John de Lekhampton died in 1416, and was succeeded by 21. William Best, whose canons resisted the visitation of the bishop of Worcester.

William Wootton advanced in 1436 \u00a350 towards the unfortunate war with France, and, dying in 1440, 23. John Taunton was consecrated abbot the same year. He advanced \u00a350 towards the king's wars, and appears to have resigned in 1445.1 After him 24. William George was appointed, and received the bene diction at Pershore, April 10th, of the same year. He was included in the list of ecclesiastics and laymen appealed to to provide men and money to preserve Calais, and it would appear that he must have readily responded to the request, for in the year following (1455) he, with Lords Sudeley and Beauchamp and four others, formed a commission to raise money throughout Gloucestershire for that object. At this time commenced the wars of the Roses. William George, with thirty-eight other peers, attended the royal court, at Westminster, November 10th, 1455, but it is not so certain that, two years later, when the influence of the Duke of York was in' the ascendant, that he responded to the almost threatening summons addressed to himself and brother barons by the unfortunate Henry. His death took place in 1461, when 25. John Solbury (or Sobburi) was elected abbot, and received the benediction at Alnchurch, October 13th, 1461. He died or resigned in 1477, and was succeeded by 26. Thomas Compton, in whose time the earliest efforts to collect funds for the rebuilding of the nave and aisles of the parish church seem to have been made. The arms of Compton ajjpear on the nave escutcheons. He died October 11th, 1481, and 27. Richard Clyve was elected October 25th, and confirmed November 5th, of the same year. In 1484, his signature occurs to Henry VII. 's declaration denouncing Richard III. as an usurper. Upon his death, the canons received a conge d'elire, September 27th, 1488, and selected 28. Thomas Aston, one of the brethren of the house. His election receiving the royal assent October 5th, combined with the usual instructions to the king's escheators for the restitution of the abbot's temporalities. Two days later the king appointed John Prete, one of his chaplains at Windsor, to receive the abbot's pension. His confirmation as abbot took place in the bishop of Worcester's chapel, 22nd October, 1488, in the Strand, London. He was present October 27th, 1495, at the king's court, Westminster, resigned his abbacy in 1504, and was succeeded by 29.

His death occurred about the 1st of March, 1522, whereupon 30. John Blake was chosen abbot. On the 17th of March, Blake was presented to the king as abbot elect, by John Dorney and Richard Hertford, two of the brethren of the house, when his election received the royal sanction, and this was duly con firmed by John Bell, LL.D., vicar-general of Pope Julius de Medici, writing from Hampton Court, the 12th April following, and the restitution of temporalities ordered. Blake built two fulling mills in the town, described by Leland ; one of these, the \" new mills,\" successively a clothing mill and carpet factory, and for many years past a flock mill, is still standing, and retains portions of the original workmanship. In the year 1528, the Princess Mary (afterwards Queen), but then a young lady of twelve summers, had a household establishment in the Welsh Marches, but it was determined \" for her own better education and the consolation \" of her parents, that she should reside again with them, and the unfortunate servants (thirty-four in number) were, consequently, ordered to be dismissed, in some cases being without any means of procuring a \" livelihood,\" and without home or friends ; the Princess's council on their behalf appealed to Wolsey to pay their wages until work could be procured, and issued circulars to Cirencester, and the other convents in the adjacent counties, to provide for as many pro tern, as they conveniently could. About this time, Henry, who had several years before obtained a papal indulgence permitting him to break the canon law, and married his deceased brother's wife, became exceedingly scrupulous about the legality of the marriage, and these scruples were greatly enhanced by the attachment he had formed for Anne Boleyn. Henry applied to Pope Clement to dissolve the former pope's bull. The temporizing conduct of this man and Wolsey, the indictment and death of the latter, the king's secret marriage, and eventual renunciation of the papal allegiance, are generally known, Perhaps many of the ecclesiastics foresaw the dangers ahead, for on 13th July, 1530 (Brewer's State Papers, No. 6513), is a petition to the Pope, signed by numerous temporal and spiritual lords, including Abbot Blake, \" praying him to consent to the king's desires, and pointing out the evils which arise from delaying the divorce.\" Four years later, Leland visited the monastery, and five years later still, John Blake, Richard Woodwalr, the prior, and the other inmates of the house, subscribed to the king's supremacy, and surrendered the monastery into the hands of his commissioners. One head in the instructions to the visitors of monasteries is now particularly necessary to be taken notice of.

These churches are thus described by Leland. Itinerary Vol. II., sol. 24: \u2014 \"There hath bene three Paroche Chirchis in Cirencestre, whereof S. Cecilia Chirch is clene down ; it was of late but a chapel. S. Lawrence yet standeth, but as no Paroch Chirch. There [i.e. at the Church of St. Lawrence] be 2 poore Almose women endowid with Landes. There is now but one Paroche Chirch in al Cirecester, but that is very fayre. The Body of the Church is al new worke, to which Ru'thall, Bishop of Durham, borne and brought up yn Cirecestre, promised much, but preventid with deth gave nothing. One Alice Aveling, aunt to Bishop Ruthal by the mother's side, gave an Hundred Markes to the Building of the right goodly Porche of the Paroch Chirch, and Ruthalle's mother contributed and other to the performent of it.\" Again, in Itin. Vol. V., sol. 65, he writes, that besides \" thaf Abbey of Black Chanons,\" the town has \" one Paroche Chirche very richely wrought,\" and that \" ther is also a little Chapel as an Almose House.\" Thus far Leland. The \" Paroche Chirche \" of Leland's time is the parish church now, and is dedicated to St. John the Baptist, but when it first became the sole parish church of Cirencester is a matter we have not yet been able precisely to determine. From the particulars given by Mr. Fuller, and elsewhere, there can, however, be little question that both the other churches had ceased to be parochial early in the 1 3th century, if not before, as in the Charter of Confirmation granted them by Pope Honorius III., in 1222, the Canons were confirmed in the possession of the church and hospital of \" St. John of Cyrencester,\" no mention being made of the other churches ; and in the Gloucester Cartulary of 1242, the Chaplain of the parish of Cirencester is referred to, indicating that at that time the town was but one united ecclesiastical parish. The Saxon Collegiate Establishment, as the mother church of the town and district, had from its \" seculars \" supplied unquestionably the neighbouring parish churches, and that oversight which had been voluntarily acceded to was by the regular clergy converted into a tyrannical usurpation of power. Mr. Fuller has further informed us how they freed themselves from the responsibility of supplying the Wigwold chapel, and it is probable, that they adopted a similar course of procedure with the churches of St. Cecilia and St. Lawrence. However that may have been, the former, which stood on the site of the residence of Mr. William Bowly, on Cecily Hill, became a chapel of ease to the parish church at an early date, and, from Leland's expression, would appear to have been allowed"], [117, "ANCIENT PARISH CHURCHES. 91 to fall into decay, or to have been taken down by the canons themselves, rather tljan by any command of the reigning monarch, Henry VIII. Leland's statement that it was once a parish church, and, consequently, place of sepulture, is confirmed by the discovery many years since, in digging for a drain in Earl Bathurst's park, of several skeletons, ranging east aud west, as disposed for Christian burial. The patron saint is accredited with the invention of the organ, and was regarded as the patroness of music. She is said to have been martyred about the year 230. St. Lawrence's Church stood at the angle formed by Gloucester- street and Barton-lane, on the north-west side of the latter. The St. Lawrence's almshouses occupy the site, and the gardens at the back, as well as the street and ward, retain the name. According to Sir Robert Atkyns, St. Lawrence's Church was converted into a Hospital by Edith Bisset, lady of Wiggold manor, probably about the middle of the 13th century (as her father died in 1241), but she, having neglected to take out a license from the crown, Edward III. seized the patronage, and in '1343 granted the mastership to the Abbot and Convent (see \"Abbey of St. Mary,\" p. 56). The little chapel used as an alms house in Leland's time was evidently part or the whole of the original church, but when it was taken down and the' present cottages built on the site is uncertain. St. Lawrence is said to have been martyred at Rome in 258. Rudder and some subsequent historians have erred in con- founding this church with the Hospital of St. John situate in the Paen. The Chapel of Wiggold appears to have been destroyed soon after the Reformation. The Manor of Baunton, which before the dissolution was a hamlet of Cirencester, passed at that time to the family of the Georges, who had held property in the place from a very early period. It has since been a distinct parish, and the chapel of ease remains as the present parish church. It is a email un pretending edifice, situated about two miles from Cirencester, in the Churn Valley, within a short distance of the road to Cheltenham. It is dedicated to St. Christopher, and has nave and chancel, but no tower ; there is, however, a bell canopy on the western gable. T. W. C. Master, Esq., whose ancestor purchased the manor and advowson of the vicarage about the year 1700 from the Georges, is the patron, and restored the church at his sole expense in 1876. In removing the whitewash some frescoes were brought to light, only one of which, that of the patron saint, could be preserved. The Rev. T. Hannyngton Irving Child holds the living in conjunction with Stratton. Until 1625 there was no burying ground, but. in that year the ground adjacent was at the request of the lord of the manor consecrated for that purpose. From the 3rd Report of the Public Records, it appears that amongst the documents in the possession of the M"], [118, "92 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. House of Lords is the counterpart of the indenture of the lease of the tithes of Baunton, in the county of Gloucester, and rectory of Cirencester, by Anthony Bourchier to Thomas More and others, for three years, from Lady-day, 1623, the tithes of two farms in Baunton excepted. THE PARISH CHURCH OF ST. JOHN THE BAPTIST. The Parish Church of St. John the Baptist consists of a nave and aisles, with a large chapel on the north side, an embattled tower at the west end forming an elongation of the nave, a chancel with its adjacent aisles, and an additional aisle or chapel occupying the north-eastern angle of the church, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and generally known as the \" Lady Chapel.\" There is an entrance at the west end, and both a north and south porch, the latter a structure of unusually large dimensions, with rooms on either side, a spacious and lofty apartment forming the upper story, and a crypt below approached by a flight of steps from without. \" Cirencester Church \" stands pre-eminent amongst the parish churches of Gloucestershire,1 a county full of admirable examples of medi\u00e6val ecclesiastical work, and although built during the prevalence of different periods of Gothic art, and without any regard to symmetry of plan or to the conventional form of a cross, it is justly considered (taken in its entirety) to be one of the finest parochial edifices in the kingdom. The porch on the south side (the upper portion of which has for more than two centuries been used as a Town Hall) adds much to its external grandeur and picturesque beauty, and although its position has been objected to as concealing a portion of the church proper, and as destructive of the harmony of the design, we are disposed to consider that the very fact that the whole of the southern fa\u00a7ade cannot be seen at once, in no degree detracts from the apparent size of the church, but that, on the contrary, from whatever position it is viewed in conjunction with this splendid appendage, and the noble tower in the background, the effect is much more striking than it could possibly be without it. During the late restoration under Sir G. Gilbert Scott (1865-67) many interesting facts were brought to light, and it was clearly proved that in the Norman era a church with nave, chancel, and side aisles to each, stood on the site of the present, the supposed 1 It cannot, of course, vie with Gloucester Cathedral, nor with Bristol (since the new nave and aisles have been added to it). It is likewise far inferior to the Abbey Church of Cirencester that once stood near it, and to that of Tewkesbury, now used as a parochial church. St. Mary Redcliff, Bristol, considered by Queen Elizabeth to be the finest parish church in her dominions, stands just outside the limits of the county."], [119, "93 THE PARISH CHURCH. approximate dimensions of which are given in red lines on the plan of the church included in this work. Traces of this Norman church still remain in the lower portions of the masonry of some of the walls, in part of the voussoirs of an arch which formed a communication between its southern aisles, as well as in a complete arched doorway in the north chancel aisle, which before the erection of the Lady Chapel, during the latter part of the twelfth or early in the thirteenth century, was an external entrance. From the slight remains we possess of the Norman structure, it would appear to have been built with excellent masonry, and, as a large portion of the edifice seems to have been restored or rebuilt in the succeeding Early English style less than a century later, it gives some colour to the view which has been advanced that an earlier church stood on its site, and that this Norman masonry is but the restoration of a more ancient building.1 This is, however, mere conjecture, and the suggestion arose from the discovery of the portion of a classic shaft and attic base in the eastern abutment of the southern chancel arcade, one half of the column having been built into the wall and thus concealed, the other half reduced and the base mouldings cut away, so as to form the respond of the Early English arch springing from it. It has been suggested that this column was in situ,2 and that it belonged to a basilica or Christian temple erected during the period of Roman rule in Britain. Some deep arched herring bone foundation discovered in 1865, may, it is thought, have formed part of a succeeding structure of the Saxon era. During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the chancel and its south aisle were widened, and the chancel only lengthened to its present extent, and it will be observed that the windows of the chancel within the communion rails, which were blocked up until the restoration, have similar jambs and tracery to those in the south chancel aisle; the original Lady Chapel and its charnel vault below are also of about the same period, as likewise the earlier re-erection and widening of the nave and its aisles, but it is not quite so certain whether they were then extended westward to their present length ; the probability is, considering the mag nitude of the work, that this followed, and that they were lengthened early in the fourteenth century, but we have no record to determine it. Traces of the high pointed roofs of this nave and aisles remain in the western walls of the present, especially in the nave and north aisle ; in the former part of the drip moulding of the tower, which was immediately above the apex of the earlier roof, appears just within the existing, whilst in the north aisle the later work has been carried up on the earlier gable coping. 1 See Report at Re-opening of Church, as published in Wilts and Gloucestershire Standard, November 30, 1867. 5 The column cannot strictly speaking be in situ, as the arcade was rebuilt in the 12th century on slightly different lines."], [120, "94 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. During the closing years of the fourteenth or very early in the fifteenth century the tower was commenced, and at the same time was inserted the beautiful window in the western wall of the south aisle, the tracery of which is so closely allied to that of the great window of the tower itself; the erection of the north porch, Trinity Chapel, and its beautiful arcade, followed later in the century, and soon after the insertion of the Garstang windows in the two eastern bays of the south aisle, the rebuilding of the Lady Chapel and the extension of St. Catherine's Chapel eastward to its present extent. The south porch was built about the year 1500, and then the re-erection of the body of the church (which had evidently been long contemplated) was commenced during the abbacy of John Hakeborne, and completed during that of his successor. After the Reformation, the building was continually allowed to get out of repair ; on several occasions portions of the walling fell down and had to be rebuilt ; the battlements and pinnacles of the nave were blown off, aud for many years not replaced until the late Mrs. Susanna Rawes, a century ago, rebuilt them,1 with the best intentions, in a style anything but medi\u00e6val. In consequence of the accommodation required for an increasing population, galleries were from time to time erected, which displayed a profusion of ornament totally out of character with the style of the church, but all of these were removed during the ministry of the Rev. Prebendary Powell. In a petition to Archbishop Laud, quoted by Mr. Fuller, the church is made to complain of the waste of money, and of her need of repair, and he further tells us how that about the same time that the western portion of the church not occupied by seats was partitioned off, and was the resort cf unruly children and dogs during divine service, and that it was ordered in 1641 that punishment should be inflicted on the offenders. A visitor to the church at the present time could scarcely conceive the existence - of such a state of things, for whilst anything but a place of common resort, access is obtained (for at least six hours daily) as freely within its walls as 2-j centuries ago, a person being in constant attendance during that time, whose duty it is to keep everything in order, whilst perfect freedom of inspection is allowed to all without compulsory fees, a box being attached to the north porch for free-will offerings for the sustentation of the edifice. In the following description we will suppose the visitor to commence his inspection with THE EXTERIOR, and the first object to attract attention will be its almost unrivalled west end tower, which (measuring from the level of the pavement 1 See Mural tablet in the Church."], [121, "95 THE PARISH CHURCH. of the nave) rises to the height of 132 feet 5 inches to the top of the battlements, the pinnacles slightly exceed 18 feet, so that the total height from the aforesaid datum to the apices of the iron crosses on the pinnacles may be taken at 150 feet 6 inches. The panorama from the leads is extensive and exceedingly pleasing in every direction. The town and abbey grounds imme diately below will be regarded with different feelings by people of strong or weak nervous temperament, but all may look without serious apprehension on the more distant objects, including the Ermine way, or Gloucester road, which ascends in an almost perfectly straight line to a level considerably above that of the spectator ; on the more gradual ascent of the main ride through the charming woods of Oakley Park; at Rendcombe House, seen (five miles distant) standing on the slope of the hills which enclose the Churn valley, and forming a striking object on a clear day; the high land in the back ground (which almost as soon as reached descends precipitously into the Severn valley) being upwards of 1,000 feet above the sea level. The elevated ground near Jackaman's, where it is probable that Edward IV. encamped a few days before contesting with Margaret of Anjou at the famous battle of Tewkesbury, is seen beyond the College, and many miles to the south and south east the blue outlines of the chalk hills of Berkshire and North Wilts form a pleasing termi nation to the view. We believe also that by the aid of a glass the tower of Cricklade, Old Swindon spire and town, Maud's monument and Lord Lansdowne's seat at Bowood, near Calne, may be distinguished. In cruciform structures the usu.al position for the tower is at the intersection of the nave and transepts. Some of the larger cathedrals, as York, Canterbury, and Lincoln, have towers in addition at each of the angles of the western facade ; in churches of smaller dimensions, the existence of a single west end tower, instead of a tower at the intersection, is of very general occurrence. It is thus placed in Manchester Cathedral, and in the much admired example of St. Mary Magdalen College, at Oxford, as well as in the neighbouring churches of Fairford, Northleach, &c. Many of these towers are of singular beauty, but we know of none, those of the larger cathedrals referred to excepted, with which Cirencester does not favourably compare in size, elegance, and excellence of proportion. . There is sufficient ornament of a chaste and pleasing character, without a redund ancy, whilst the disposition of the buttresses, which are skilfully designed to rise with repeated variations, and at every stage with fresh lightness and elegance, terminating in beautiful crocketed pinnacles, combined with the character of the ornament on the face, unite to give an appearance of greater altitude than the tower actually possesses. The lower part is about the same height as the nave, the north and south faces above the solid"], [122, "96 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. basement of this storey being divided by mullions terminating in somewhat elaborate cusping into four panels on each face, whilst the western front above the entrance doorway is pierced by a magnificent window, which, together with the cusped work of the panels on the north and south faces of the tower, points to the period of transition from the Decorated to the Perpendicular styles, which marks the reigns of Richard II. and his successor, Henry IV., and from the arms of England and France (quarterly, semee fleur de lis) being carved on the exterior in one of the spandrels of the western entrance, that is with several lilies or \" fleurs de lis \" on the field of the escutcheon, it is certain that this lower portion of the work must have been carried out prior to the death of the last named monarch. Edward III. (1341) first adopted the arms of France, and his successors, Richard and Henry, alone used them in this manner. By the fifth and sixth Henrys they were successively reduced to five and three in number. Confirmatory as to date are bequests towards the building of the tower, dated 1402 and 1403, which are referred to by Mr. Fuller and the late Mr. C. H. Savory. In 1678, Anthony a Wood saw the brass of the Abbot, in the nave of the church, who was said to have built the tower, and the presence of the arms of St. Mary's Abbey in the other spandrel of the western entrance establishes the view that it was under taken under the auspices of the Abbey. This Abbot was almost certainly John Lekhampton (1394-1416), but it is not so certain that it was completed during his abbacy ; nor is it improbable that his predecessor, Nicholas de Ameney (1363-94), started the work. During the erection of the upper portions, a settlement took place, and the huge flying buttresses were added, which extended over the western walls of the former nave aisles, and now are included within the upper portion of these walls, as added to them to carry the low pitched roof of the 16th century restoration. The panelled work which appears on the north and south faces of the lower portions of the tower is continued up to the underside of the belfry storey on each of the four faces, the panels, however, being increased from four to five in number in each case, and being divided by a transome into two stages ; the belfry storey is pierced on each of the four sides with a beautiful two centred arch filled in with stone courses between the mullions and with quatrefoil tracery above, and the whole is surmounted with an enriched battlemented parapet and pinnacles as before described, and, may we add 1 a weathercock erected in the year 1819. In the belfry is a fine peal of twelve bells, the tenor weighing nearly 4,000 lbs. ; they were cast by Rudhall, of Gloucester, early in the last century, and in the year 1870 were rehung upon new framing by Mr. William Hinton, builder, of this town, at that time and now leader of the ringers. A peal of bells and a clock"], [123, "THE PARISH CHURCH. 97 with chimes is known to have existed for a great number of years, probably soon after the erection of the tower, but at the same time that the bells were rehung, the old clock and chiming apparatus, having been for nearly a decade previously guilty of many eccentricities, were replaced with the present by Mr. Dent, the well known clock manufacturer of London, at a cost of nearly \u00a3500, the cost of re-hanging the bells, &c, being about twice this amount. The same tune is played as before, viz., the old 113th Psalm tune, at the hours of 3, 6, 9, and 12, but instead of simply striking the quarters, the St. Mary's chimes are now played at each. There are several old customs retained in the matter of bell ringing, fully described by Mr. Fuller in his recently published account of the church, amongst these the tolling of the Old Curfew Bell in the winter months on certain nights at 8 p.m., on Shrove Tuesday at noon of what is popularly known as the \" Pancake Bell,\" the muffled peal on Innocents' day, and the lifting of all the bells in rotation seven times at 11 every Saturday morning, are relics of the customs of bygone times. The lifting and sharp ringing of the ninth bell performs a more useful object when required in calling together the fire brigade. The tenor booms out its deep notes at the few funerals which, since the opening of the cemetery, now take place in the churchyard. In each of the western angles of the tower are canopied recesses, one containing, as is supposed, the figure of St. John the Baptist, and the other probably of another saint. Previously to the recent restoration, the battlements and pinnacles of the nave and south aisle were much dilapidated, and had been restored without much regard to Gothic detail ; the north aisle and Lady Chapel had been entirely deprived of them, whilst those of the Trinity Chapel had suffered much from age and other causes ; all are now completely restored, and add much to the appearance of the exterior. On a shield beneath the canopy at the apex of the eastern wall of the nave are carved the mitre and initials of John Blake, the last abbot, during whose abbacy the nave was originally completed. On the string courses below the battlements of the nave overlooking the aisles are two series of figures, the original ones executed at the erection of the church. Although much weather-worn, they may be seen to advantage from the leads of the adjacent aisles. These figures are extremely interesting, as pourtraying the social life and customs of three or four centuries since ; full particulars respecting them are given in Carter's Antiquities, published in 1788 ; those on the north side represent a Whitsun Ale, that is, a feast or \" merrymaking \" which was at the time very common in this part of the country, and was kept up in some of the neighbouring places until the present century. The \" dramatis person\u00e6 \" are the king or lord of the feast holding a scroll on which are inscribed in medi\u00e6val characters the words 13c itlcrrtr, his"], [124, "98 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. queen or lady, the steward with a purse at his girdle, musicians, fool, and other court attendants. On the south side the figures are supposed by Mr. Carter to be intended for the characters in one of the old \" mysteries \" or religious dramas which were so much in vogue in medi\u00e6val times, and were supported by the clergy, who objected to the secular performances, which it must be admitted were frequently of a very loose character. Amongst others are included the figures of a king, abbot, monk, gladiator or prizefighter, with a sword and dagger, an angel, and an impersonation of the king of terrors, death. The gurgoyles in the same position on Trinity Chapel are interesting, and at the extremities of its roof are canopied recesses, one containing figures of the Virgin and Child, and the other a figure probably of St. John the Baptist. The view from the Abbey Lawn of this Chapel and the Lady Chapel, with the tower and body of the Church in the background, is perhaps the most pleasing view of the exterior, although it may by some be considered as surpassed by that of the opposite side in the bold projections presented by the porch, combined with its elaborate workmanship. The chancel and its \u25a0 aisles, with their Early English roofs, present but a mean appearance externally, and the only feature to be noticed is the dog's tooth hoodmould of the great east window, which formerly enclosed a triplet or three-light lancet window. The entrance for visitors to THE INTERIOR is generally by the north porch, a low battlemented building of the same date as the chapel adjoining, but destitute of its attractions. On entering, however, the eye is satisfied with a very fair stone roof, springing from slender shafts at the four internal, angles. Au inner pair of folding doors leads into the north aisle, and the visitor will be struck with the imposing effect of the lofty and spacious nave ; he should, however, proceed to the western entrance to form a just idea of the proportions of the building. The view eastward is striking, but compared with medi\u00e6val structures of equal area the want of length is noticeable from the first ; in this, however, there is an advantage, as in many of our largest churches there is little space available for Congregational worship. Its dimensions, as taken by the author, are as follows : \u2014 Feet. In.

No. of Sittings, as per Ordnance Map, 1498. Taking internal superficial area as the basis of measurement, Cirencester Church is the 78th in point of size of the Cathedrals and large Churches in the United Kingdom, in Sir E. Beckett's list, and exceeds three English Cathedrals, viz., Oxford, St. Asaph, and Bangor. If, however, the porches were included, and the cubical content could be taken as the standard of measurement, it would occupy a much higher place in the list, as the sectional area of the nave and aisles, i.e. their width multiplied by their average height, exceeds that of even some of the most important of our Cathedrals ; and whilst some critics may object to the unusual height and width of the aisles, it is unquestionably this that contributes so largely to the grandeur of the interior. Bigland's dimensions, as taken from an ancient MS. Ichnography, are nearly but not strictly correct. William of Worcester writes as follows : \u2014 \" Longitudo ecclesi\u00e6 parochialis Sancti Johannis in villa de Cyssetyr, alias Cirencestre, cum choro continet 90 gressus, latitudo dict\u00e6 ecclesi\u00e6 continet cum duabus alis 50 gressus, longitudo campanilis continet 7 virgas, latitudo turris sive spera continet 6 virgas et dimid.\" The roof of the tower vestibule is beautifully executed in groined stonework ; the ogives, which spring from cylindrical shafts in the internal angles, are boldly cut, and at their inter section is a deeply recessed circular panel sufficiently large to admit the passage of the bells. The west window is filled with stained glass collected from different parts of the Church, in consequence of the bequest of Mrs. Catherine Cripps, who, in 1790, left \u00a350 to beautify the building. The arrangement of these scattered fragments was the work of Samuel Lysons, Esq., F.S.A, who from the materials at his command has composed a design of intrinsic merit and beauty. Mr. James Miles, a plumber of the town, executed the work. The head in the centre is N"], [126, "100 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. supposed to be that of Richard Duke of York (father of Edward IV), and to have belonged to a full length figure of the same illustrious personage which until the beginning of last century remained perfect in one of the end windows of the Trinity Chapel ; the figures in the same row in the outside compartments are St. John of Beverley, with the inscription \" Johes de Beu'laco,\" and St. William, Archbishop of York, inscribed \" Will Eboraco.\" These were taken from the Garstang window in the south aisle, and are given in the illustrations in Lysons's Gloucestershire Antiquities. The next series contains Pope Gregory X. in the centre compartment, with St. Ambrose on the one side and St. Jerome in the habit of a cardinal on the other. The lowermost row of full length figures pourtrays the female saints Batilda, Dorothy, Catherine (in the centre), Margaret, and Johanna ; the first named, however, of these contains only the head of the original, the body being supposed to be that of St. Peter. The small kneeling figures underneath the full length figures, which in their former positions denoted that they were the donors of the lights or compartments in which they were placed, are inscribed as follows: 1. \" Sc's Augustinus ora pro nobis\" on a scroll round the head, with \" Willm' Hampton\" at the foot. 2. \" Johes Hampton et ux ei'.\" 3. \" Willm' Okyn et Johana ux eiufd.\" 4. \" Will Colsburn Bower et Alicia Johana.\" 5. \" Joh'es Rowthale M'garet et Alic ux.\" 6. \" Johana Langele.\" 7. \" Johana Whyt,\" with a scroll round the head, and \"Sc'a Batildis ora pro nobis.\" With the exception of the figure of St. Catherine, all this glass came from the windows in the south aisle, and is referred to by Rudder (History of Cirencester, pages 249-251). In the tracery of the upper portion of the window are certain devices and heraldic shields, including the emblems of the Trinity, the arms of the Abbey, of Prelatte, of Chedworth, and others. THE NAVE AND AISLES. In order to show certain early work in the form of monumental slabs of the 12th and 13th centuries, which were used in the re-erection of the body of the church to form the foundations of the columns, the floor of the nave and aisles was dropped about a foot from the previous level, and is consequently now about nineteen inches below the pavement at the western entrance. The roofs were then re-leaded throughout, and re-timbered where necessary, and the masonry of the eastern wall of the nave was taken down and re-set from the extrados of the chancel arch, as well as the two eastern bays of the nave from the springing of the arches of the arcade. In doing this it was ascertained that portions of the columns of the Early English nave had been freely used in the sixteenth century in the walling of the clerestory, and the beds of these stones are still to be seen on the aisle sides. The columns"], [127, "101 THE PARISH CHURCH. of the earlier nave appear to have been both circular and octagonal, and about two feet in diameter. A reference to the plan will show that each of the nave arcades consists of six arches supported by five detached columns, with a half column abutting from the walls at either end. Each column is composed of eight cylindrical shafts, terminating with octagonal cap and base mouldings, and emanating from the angles of a plain octagonal base ; a slender projecting circular rib is also carried up the centre of each of the recesses between the shafts, and each of these is corbelled out at the top to unite with the mouldings of the capitals. The arches are beautifully moulded to correspond with the columns by which they are supported, and at their springing on both faces are cherubic figures bearing escutcheons or carved shields, with the arms of various benefactors to the erection. These are given incorrectly by Rudder, but in 1867, after much labour and research, Mr. Fuller, assisted by the late Mr. Niblett, of Haresfield Court, and other gentlemen, made out a correct list, and the late Mr. John Beecham, of this town, was entrusted with the work of picking them out in their proper heraldic colours. The arms on the shields are as follows : \u2014 North Aisle, commencing at the Eastern end.1 1. See of Worcester \u2014 argent, ten torteauxes gules. This shield is not carved, but was so painted because at the period of the erection of the nave Cirencester was in the diocese of Worcester. 2. Gules a chevron argent between ten crosses pattees argent for Berkeley impaling Fitzhugh, azure, three chevrons, or, braced in base and a chief or. 3. Quarterly, Hungerford and others. 4. Quarterly, Chandos, Darrell, Brydges, and Berkeley. 5. Argent, a chevron between three pigs, sable, for Swynhoe (or Swinehoe) of Minety. 6. Morton quartering Twynihoe. 7. Bishopric of Gloucester (painted only). Nave. \u2014 North side, commencing at the Western end. 1. The cherub and escutcheon are wanting. 2. The initials H. T., with merchant's mark, said to refer to Henry Tapper, grocer, of the town. 3. R. R., with merchant's mark, either for Robert Rowthale, or, more probably, Robert Rycardes. 4. Compton, quarterly, first and fourth, sable, a lion passant regardant or between three helmets, two and one argent ; second and third, a chevron vert within a bordure azure bezanttee. 1 The heraldic bearings are taken from a list by the author's father in 1867, and amended according to Mr. Fuller's work."], [128, "102 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. Abbot Compton died in 1481. The present Marquis of North ampton is descended from the same stock. 5. Gules on a chevron argent, three rams' heads caboshed or, for the Abbey of Cirencester, and initials J. H., for Abbot John Hakeborne. 6. Azure, a cross engrailed, two roses stalked for Rowthale impaled with the see of Durham.1 7. Sable, three wolves' heads, erased or, conjectured to be Howe, but uncertain.

Bust of a woman between words Alys Avenyg. 5. A chevron bearing letters D. A. P., beneath a head painted to represent a monk. (Mr. Fuller considers that the head is wrongly painted, and that the shield refers to Dame Alice Pratt.) 6. Device, banner of St. John Baptist, with letters I. B. 7. Gules, a ph\u0153nix in flames or, the arms of the town. This shield is only painted, having been blank previous to 1867. In the spandrels of the arches in the nave are carved several shields, representing the emblems of the Passion of our Lord, which at the restoration good taste decided to leave uncoloured ; they include the cross, a heart, ladder, nails, hammer, scourge, &c. The nave has no triforium, but the space immediately above the arcades is recessed and panelled, and the jambs of the recesses are carried up to terminate in a depressed or four-centred 1 The presence of Rowthale's arms has caused Rudder to cast doubt upon the accuracy of Leland's statement, viz. , that Rowthale (or Ruthall) ' ' promised much, but prevented with death gave nothing. \" Leland is generally exceedingly reliable, and visited Cirencester only eleven years subsequent to Ruthall's death in 1524, but he may have been misinformed in this respect, especially as Ruthall must have lived to see the restoration nearly completed."], [129, "103 THE PARISH CHURCH. arch, the mullions of the lower part being continued above the transome which constitutes the upper member of the panelling to unite in the ogee tracery of the clerestory windows. The roofs of both nave and aisles are oak of the ordinary form of panelled tie beam roofing which prevailed during the closing period of Gothic architecture ; the bosses and angelic figures with shields at the intersections of the timbers, and the spandrels in the angles formed by the wall posts and main beams, are beautifully carved, and the symbolical devices represented will repay careful study. The roof of the south aisle differs from that of the aisle opposite in construction and is more ornate. The chancel arch is \" Early English \" in outline, and probably coeval with. the earlier nave of that period, but the mouldings are re-chiselled work of the 16th century, corresponding with the rest of Abbot Hakeborne's work ; in the spandrel above is an old blocked-up doorway, which formerly was a communication between the turret stairs in St. Catherine's chapel through a doorway in the north chancel wall and the rood loft, which used to occupy the opening of the chancel arch, and of which the screen alone remains ; there may possibly have been a triforium in the former nave at this height leading from the rood loft. The large seven-light window over the chancel arch was filled with stained glass soon after the restoration in memory of R. B. Croome, Esq., and his sister, as explained on a brass tablet on the southern abutment of the arch. The centre compartment represents our Lord crowned in glory, and on either side are cherubims \" hovering round ; \" the outer lights contain the archangel Michael with his sword, Gabriel with the olive branch, Raphael with a fish in his hand, and a fourth angel with the censer of incense typical of the \" prayers of the saints ; \" the arms of France and England quarterly are on a shield at the crown of the arch of this window. The clerestory windows of the two eastern bays on the south side represent (1) the Annun ciation or visit of the angel Gabriel to the Virgin Mary ; (2) Mary's salutation of her cousin Elizabeth ; (3) the Saviour as an infant in the inn at Bethlehem with His mother and reputed father, and inscribed on a scroll \" The Word was made flesh ; (4) the angels appearing to the shepherds by night and uttering their song of joyful praise, \" Glory to God in the highest,\" which words are likewise written on a scroll. It is proposed that the remaining clerestory windows shall be filled with a continuation of subjects illustrative of the life and parables of our Lord. The eastern walls of nave and aisles were formerly painted with fresco, which it was not attempted to restore beyond picking out some conventional patterns round the arches leading to the chancel aisles. Some of the old fresco is still discernible in the south aisle."], [130, "104 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. The arch between the south aisles of nave and choir, as well as the lower part of the abutments of the entrances to the chapels on the opposite side, belong, like the chancel arch, to the earlier church. The projecting fillet on the shaft of the pier of that entering the north chancel aisle is an evidence of early workmanship, whilst the arch between the south aisles retains its early character intact ; the short corbelled columns with their carved capitals, enriched with foliage and miniature heads, are exceedingly interesting and well executed ; one corbel is, however, a restoration; the cap and base mouldings of the slender columns in the angles are similar to those of the east and side windows of the chancel aisle, as well of the great east window, and of the recesses within the communion rails. The voussoirs of the doorway which communicated between the aisles of the Norman church already referred to, are to be seen in the wall of the western abutment of this arch, and like wise the foundations of the Norman chancel arch. On referring to the lists of the escutcheons of the present nave arcades it will be observed that those facing the south aisles are invariably carved with merchants' trade marks or other devices instead of with heraldic quarterings. On the shields- of two of the keystones, however, are carved the arms of Garstang,, \" azure, three mascles, or, within a bordure, engrailed gules ; ' and on two others the initials H. G., for Hugh Garstang, a member of a wealthy family which resided in Cirencester about the middle of the fifteenth century and which probably sprung from the town of Garstang, in Lancashire. To this Hugh Garstang the credit is due of having commenced the re-erection of the south aisle some 60 or 70 years before it was ultimately carried out. The two eastern bays were rebuilt by him, the windows being different in character to those of the completed restoration, at which time the walls were carried up above his work to the requisite height for supporting the low pitched roof. The Garstang escutcheon is carved on the buttresses of these bays ; again, in a recess of the easternmost bay, which is supposed formerly to have contained his effigy ; it is likewise repeated in the stained glass now removed from these windows, and upon the oak screen which formerly stood in this angle of the church, and enclosed what appears to have been first known as the Garstang chantry chapel of St. Edmund the Confessor, but afterwards as the Jesus chapel or chapel of the \" service of the name of Jesus.\"1 This screen, now placed in the Lady Chapel, to serve as the Choristers' robing room, was removed from its original position early in this century to an angle of St. John's Chapel, where it remained until 1865. A large vault underneath the chapel was probably intended for the interment of the family, which it would 1 Rev. E. A. Fuller's History of Cirencester Church ; Valor Ecelesiasticus."], [131, "THE PARISH CHURCH. 105 appear, as suggested by Mr. Fuller, had died out in or left Cirencester at the close of the fifteenth century. In later times Mrs. Rebecca Powell and her first and second husbands were buried in it, and in 1865 it was filled with the human remains collected from different parts of the church. Previous to that year there were several monumental brasses and incised inscriptions in the pavement of the body of the church, but principally in this aisle. These are now for the most part removed to the Lady Chapel, and the inscriptions are given later on. The brasses of Sir William Nottingham and his wife lay just outside the Jesus Chapel screen, and close by, on a stone removed shortly prior to 1800, was inscribed \" Munde vale tibi ve, fugiens me dum sequerer te, Tu sequeris modo me, munde vale tibi ve. \" i.e., \" Farewell, oh, world, alas to thee, which shunned me when I sought after thee, Thou wilt soon follow me, farewell, oh, world, alas to thee.\" In the passage which used to extend down the centre of the aisle between the foregoing and the south porch, were epitaphs to the memory of \" Hugh Norys,\" Hodgkinson Paine, Elizabeth his wife, and others. The window in the west wall of this aisle depicts the Trans figuration. It is in memory of the late James Fielder Croome, who died in 1836, and of his son who died in 1853. That in the corresponding position in the north aisle was the gift of several of the inhabitants of the parish, on the retirement of the Rev. W. F. Powell, M.A., in 1869, from a ministry which had extended over a period of more than 30 years. The principal figures are intended as representative of the ministry. In the first compartment is Melchisedek, as typical of the pre-Levitical priesthood, and at his feet a scroll with the words \" I will raise me up a faithful priest.\" In the next compartment, Aaron in the high priest's robes, with the prayer \" Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness.\" John the Baptist, as the forerunner of Christ, with the text \" To give knowledge of salvation unto his people \" appears in the third light, and then Timothy, in the garb conventionally ascribed to an early Christian bishop, a person who in the early days of Christianity was appointed on account of superior learning and excellences to have the spiritual oversight of the mission churches established in a particular district; the text chosen is addressed to Timothy by Paul, but relates to the \" holy calling \" of every Christian believer to labour in the service of his Divine Master. The church is indebted for its beautiful organ to Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Dawson, residents in the town at the time of the restora tion, who liberally gave \u00a3500 for the purpose. It has thirty stops, and contains the choir, the great, and the swell organs. The"], [132, "106 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. builders were Messrs. Gray and Davison, of London ; the works, however, are only partially new, those of the former organ, erected by Green, of Chelsea, in 1790, having been utilised in its re construction. The present organ case certainly reflects great credit upon the designer, not only on account of its intrinsic beauty and almost unique outline, suggested, we understand, by that of the great organ of Strasburg Cathedral, but likewise for the skill displayed in securing an almost central position without concealing any portion of the church otherwise than a blank wall and a window of no architectual merits or interest. There was an earlier organ erected in the year 1683. On the removal of the high-backed pews in June, 1865, the end of one of the seats of Abbot Hakeborne's time was found doing service as part of the flooring, and it was determined to adopt it as a model for. repewing the body of the church ; it now forms the end of one of the modern pews near the south entrance, and is much blackened with age. As the appearance of the interior of the church is very different to what it was before the recent restoration, it may be worth while to preserve some little record of the arrangement of the seating. A passage or clear way was left from the north to south porches, and another, parallel to it, extended across the eastern portion of the body of the church, leaving space for a succession of square pews against the party wall separating it from the choir portion of the building. These two passages were connected with others down the centre of each aisle. In the south aisle, west of the entrance, stood the ancient font, which has now been placed on a marble base between the nave and the north aisle. In a square recess formed by the seating in the centre of the nave, westward from the passage between the porches, was a marble font presented by the ladies of the town, and from this the seating rose in successive tiers to the level of the west window in the tower, and extended partly into the adjacent aisles. The termination of the gallery under the tower vaulting was occupied by the children of the Yellow and Blue Schools, and a gallery at the west end of the south aisle by other children taught in the Church Sunday Schools. The seats in the south aisle against the exterior wall faced north and were stepped, a galler, erected in 1803 being placed over them, which was returned across the eastern end of the aisle. The organ loft and Hungerford gallery, which occupied the remaining portion of the eastern wall of the body of the church, and blocked up the arches of the chancel and its north aisle, were taken down some years previously to the church restoration, as well as the Bathurst gallery (removed in 1853), which extended along the Trinity Chapel arcade. Conse quent upon these alterations the last named chapel was filled with the present elegant open pews, and the organ temporarily placed at the western end of the north aisle."], [133, "Pffl.lsltClyLKC-te t)K S.

With the arrangement described it will be apparent that the western entrance was concealed from the church, the space under the gallery being used as a receptacle for the fire engines. The beautiful stone pulpit, with its open tracery work springing from a delicately wrought clustered shaft, was hidden by the reading desk and by a wooden framing intended to increase its height. This pulpit is interesting as a rare relic of Pre-Reforma tion times, most having shared the fate of the images and crosses ; a drawing of it and of three others in the county is given in Lysons's Gloucestershire. The brass eagle lectern was provided out of the restoration fund. TRINITY CHAPEL, On the north side of the nave is, taken in its entirety, the most ornate portion of the building. It was built in the former half of the 15th century, at a time when the ecclesiastical architects had begun to depart from those principles of beauty which find their charm in simplicity and elegance of outline rather than in a profuse display of intricate and minute ornament. It would be unfair to assert that the elaborate workmanship of the later periods of medi\u00e6val art is devoid of the principles of true beauty, but they are frequently obtained at the sacrifice of much time and labour, whilst much needless ornament is frittered away. This is especially the case with the delicately wrought stone screen and sedilia in the arcade ; inspection is better than description. The canopy over the piscina is destroyed ; the narrow door-way was intended for the priests who ministered at the high altar ; the entrance under the ogee arch terminating in a crocketed finial for the people attending mass ; the iron hinge pivots of the door which formerly filled this opening remain, although the door has long been removed. A memorial brass to the memory of William Prelatte, who died in 1462, describes him as a most special benefactor to the chapel. His arms are painted on the north wall, as well as those of Richard Dixton, who died twenty-four years earlier, but was certainly likewise a promoter of the work, and in all probability the first interred within its walls; the interest of Dixton and Prelatte in its erection will account for the presence of the Yorkist badge, the falcon and fetterlocke, at the apex of each of the arches and the windows opposite. Mr. Fuller informs us that both these men were in the service of Richard Duke of York, who was killed at the battle of Wakefield. The Yorkist arms are likewise painted above the gable windows, and the full length figure of the aforesaid Richard was formerly in the stained glass of the side windows, as well as those of Thomas Duke of Surrey, Richard Earl of Salisbury, Peter King of Castile, and others. The glass in the upper tracery of the present side o"], [136, "108 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. windows was inserted sixteen or seventeen years ago ; the lower compartments of one have since been filled up by Frederick Cripps, Esq., in memory of Mrs. Frederick Cripps, who died May 30, 1877, as explained by the brass memorial plate underneath. The large figures in the four compartments call to remembrance the incidents connected with the Incarnation of our Lord, and include Joseph, Mary, Simeon, and Anna (the prophetess). The tracery of the side windows of this chapel was closely followed in designing the Garstang lights ; the gable windows are early examples of the depressed or debased style ; the roof displays a profusion of labour in the numerous intersecting timbers in the carved pater\u00e6 and the open sprandrel brackets between the wall posts and tie beams, as well as in the mouldings of the timbers ; the half bay at the eastern end is filled with fret or tabernacle work. On the northern wall adjoining the altar, and under the painted shield of Prelatte, is a representation in fresco, now much defaced, of the martyrdom of a certain St. Erasmus, and appended is the following comfortable assurance in fifteenth century characters to all who were prepared to accept salvation and the temporal blessings promised on such easy terms : \u2014 WHAT ma othir woma worscip' this holi seint Bisschop & martr e'iry Sunday that bith in the yere w' a pas nr and o ave Othir ony almus gueth to a poor ma or bring ony candill lyght lass or more he schall haue v giflftis grauntid of god The first is he schall haue reysonabil gode to his lyues ende The seconde is that hys enimyes schall haue no pouir to do hym no bodely harme nor dysese The iij is what reysonabil thynge that he will aske of god & that holy sent h* schall be graunt' The iiij that he schall be onbourdnd of all his tribulacion & dysese The v is that in his last inde haue schrift (*) & houssill (t) & grete repentaunce & sacraniete of an newntinge ( || ) & the he may come to that blysse that neuer hath ende amen. The reredos was restored in 1867, at the expense of the late Lady Georgina Bathurst. It contains a central canopied recess with a figure of our Saviour, and four lesser niches on either side ; the pedestals below are supported by angelic figures, and beneath the pedestal are a row of nineteen carved shields painted with the various quarterings of the Danvers family (who were lords of Cirencester manor in the time of Elizabeth and James I.) and others. Rudder (p. 256, History of Cirencester) gives a list copied from Mr. Carles' MS. Mr. Fuller gives a corrected list by comparison with another given by Anthony a Wood, and a careful investigation of the Danvers' alliances. The niches and panelled work to the shields are part of the original dilapidated altar piece ; the figures, pedestals, and canopies are the work of Mr. Geflowski, sculptor, of London. The altar steps are coeval with the chapel, and some of the fine monumental brasses inserted in them, the inscriptions of which are given later in this work, retain their original positions.

One of these is in memory of Reginald Spycer, a merchant of Cirencester, who in 1400 took an active and leading part in the arrest of the Earls Kent and Salisbury.1 The brasses in this Church have attracted considerable attention amongst arch\u00e6ologists, as well as those of Northleach and Fairford churches ; they were probably executed in Belgium and the Low Countries, and were exchanged with the wool merchants of this town and district. The chapel further contains several monuments of the Bathurst family, which are also given in the list of inscriptions. THE CHOIR OR CHANCEL. A reference to the plan will show that in the Norman structure the chancel and its south aisle, and. their entrances from the body of the church, were narrower than at present, and that whereas the northern arcade of the chapel is within the line of the nave produced, and is probably built on the early foundations, the southern arcade is outside the extension of the centre line of the corresponding nave columns, it having been built with the aisle adjacent in the twelfth century on different lines. Both chancel arcades are of the same era, but the idea of symmetry has been disregarded, the central column and responds on the north side being octagonal, whilst on the opposite side is a round column with carved capital, of lesser height, and consequently more highly pointed arches ; in this instance the abutments have no reference to the column, a corbel taking the place of the engaged half-column at the one end, and a short three-quarter-column 1 In the \"Issues of the Exchequer,\" ed. Devon, 1837, occur the following: \u2014 1 Henry IV., Feb. 4. \"To Reginald Spicer, Roger Carnill, John Colman, Richard Small, and others, of the town of Chichester\" (intended for Cirencester). \u2014 \" In money paid to them in hand in discharge of \u00a312 7s. 9d., which the Lord the King commanded to be paid for certain costs and expenses incurred by them, as well for arresting the Earls of Kent and Salisbury and other rebels who lately rebelled against the Lord the king and his crown, as for charges by them incurred for the safe conduct of certain rebels so taken by them to the town of Oxford, and afterwards for like expenses which they were put to for the safe conduct of their goods to London, and there delivered to the Lord the King.

The attic base of the latter, brought to light during the recent restorations, has been already referred to. This arcade was rebuilt stone for stone in 1865, in consequence of a settlement caused by the thrust of the roof. The restored flank windows within the communion rails were originally both external windows ; that on the south side, the lower part of which is occupied with the modern carved oak sedilia, is filled with coloured glass as a thank offering from the Rev. J. F. Gosling (formerly curate here, and late vicar of Bream, in the Forest of Dean), in remembrance of his recovery from a serious accident which befell him in an Alpine tour. The subject is \" Christ as the Good Shepherd.\" The small clerestory lights over the vestry depict the four greater prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah Ezekiel, and Daniel, the window containing the two last named is in memory of the Rev. J. S. Haygarth. Those on the opposite side overlooked the adjacent aisle before the roof was raised in the middle of the sixteenth century. The great east window was certainly originally a triplet or three-light lancet window, with clustered shafts; the jambs retain their original position, but the interior arches were subsequently used to construct the badly-shaped arch of the present window, the space being divided by mullions into a large window of five lights; the defects in the window itself are to some extent compensated by the collection of stained glass which it contains; for the window in the tower having given such general satisfaction, Mrs. Williams, relict of John Williams, Esq., of Ponthowell, C\u00e6rmarthenshire, undertook about the year 1800 to defray the expense of inserting the remaining scattered fragments of glass in this window, together with such modern glass as was necessary. The same gentleman and the same tradesman who had designed and executed the west window carried it out, but it is decidedly inferior as a work of art, the modern glass introduced being unsatisfactory and not in character with the rest. The six-winged seraphim, so often repeated in the old and new glass of the church, as well as the Garstang shields, came from the Garstang windows.1 Three female figures were taken, and the sill lowered to receive them, from the Langley Chapel in Siddington Church, but these were restored when the reredos was erected, and the sill raised as before. The beautiful piscina on the north side of the window was brought to light at the restoration, its table having been cut away at some time to fix the framed boarding upon which the Ten Commandments were written in sombre black and gold ; the hagioscopes or squints to enable the attendants to witness the raising of the host at the ceremonial of the mass from St. Catherine's chapel were thrown open at the same time. 1 See drawing in Lysons's Gloucestershire Antiquities."], [139, "111 THE PARISH CHURCH. The level of the chancel floor was also raised. The modern tile paving is nicely figured. The communion steps are of polished granite, the gift of the late Archdeacon Thorpe (Bristol). The timbered work of the roof has been again brought to light by the removal of the plastered ceiling1 which disfigured it ; and with the new choristers' stalls, and, above all, the splendid reredos, the appearance of the interior is completely transformed since the time (1842) when a previous historian remarked, with justice, that it \"would present but a mean appearance,\" with \"little of the sacred character,\" but for the monuments on the walls and the \" elegantly painted \" east end window. The centre of the roof does not coincide with the centre of the arch from the nave, neither is the central line of the chancel parallel to that of the nave produced ; there is an inclination of about a foot towards the north, and in St. Mary's or the Lady Chapel of about two feet. By some this is supposed to have been intentional, and to have a symbolical meaning. The reredos was executed by Mr. Geflowski, and was designed by Professor Scott, R.A. The centre panel in front represents the Crucifixion, that on the left the Agony in the garden of Gethsemane, and on the right the Resurrection. The figures of the four Evangelists, with their symbols, are contained in the niches. The smaller panels on the north side include the Annun- ciation and John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness ; on the south side the Nativity and Baptism of our Lord. The chancel was once fully occupied with stalls ; upon their removal pews were introduced, and the adjacent chapels screened or partitioned off ; the partitions and pewing were taken down upwards of 30 years ago, and in 1867 the present stalls were introduced, the design being taken from the remains of some doing service as flooring joists. The oak screen separating the chancel and its aisles from the body of the church are of fifteenth century construction. The bracketing of the rood loft having been immediately over the chancel screen. The ministers' vestry was probably added in the fifteenth century.2 THE SOUTH CHANCEL AISLE, OR CHAPEL OF ST. JOHN THE BAPTIST, has been already stated to have been originally rebuilt on its present lines in consequence of the widening of the chancel. 1 This ceiling was a fair specimen of \"churchwarden\" art. The transverse section was nearly semi-circular, obtained by nailing laths to the open timber work, some attempt being made to relieve the plainness by the introduction of ribs (longitudinally and transversely) so as to form panels about 8 ft. square ; the bosses or pater\u00e6 at the intersections were of lead, whitewashed of course. 8 See Mr. Fuller's \"Parish Church,\" p. 50, for further particulars."], [140, "112 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. The windows and entrance arch retain their early workman ship, which appears to be rather later than that of the chancel arcade, but it is noteworthy that nearly the whole of the walling has been reconstructed at different times since the Reformation, and this will explain the absence of the altar and altar steps. Part of the exterior flank wall fell down, and was rebuilt about the close of last century, and Rudder (whose work was written just prior to 1800) says it \" has an oratory in the south wall,\" whilst Bigland, in a drawing of nearly 20 years earlier, shows what appears to have been an external entrance between the side windows, but which may have been connected with the oratory referred to. The fresco work on the arch leading into the body of the church is the original painting touched up. The large and handsome marble monument in the south-western angle, removed seventeen years ago from the opposite corner, is to the memory of George Monox, Esq., his wife, Maria, and two daughters. He was a native of this town and a merchant of London, of which city he became sheriff, and was also a considerable benefactor to the Cirencester charities. It is noteworthy that whilst the columns and entablature are classic, the soffite, or underside of the entablature, is incised with quatrefoils. The period of its erection is the reign of Charles the First, and it is considered by a previous historian that \" from a certain ease in the attitude and draperies \" of the figures, viz., of Monox and his wife in the upper part, and the miniature ones of their daughters on the pedestal, \"joined to somewhat of frippery and affectation, the sculptor was probably of the school of Bernini.\"1 A mural monument to the Rev. Dr. Washbourn, formerly master of the Grammar School, has also been removed from its former position between the arches. The centre compartment of the east window was filled with stained glass about thirty years ago, depicting three events in the life of John the Baptist, viz., \"John baptising our Lord in the river Jordan,\" \" John preaching in the wilderness of Judea,\" and Zacharias writing \" His name is John.\" This glass was highly coloured, the figures being well rendered, and it had been intended to complete the side lights, but during the past year (1883) the glass in the centre compartment was removed, and a fresh design executed more in accordance with the architecture of the chapel and with the character of the more recent stained glass, as a memorial to the late Charles Lawrence, Esq., Mrs. Lawrence, and other members of the family, as explained on a brass tablet. The subjects represented are also in connection with the life of St. John the Baptist, and are intended to continue those inserted in the side windows at the restoration of the church in memory of Dr. William Lawrence and Judith, his wife. The series of subjects in each window appears to be as follows : \u2014 1 History of Cirencester, by W. K. Beecham (1842)."], [141, "113 THE PARISH CHURCH. EAST WINDOW. Left compartment : \u2014 1.

It is recorded on a marble tablet that William Lawrence, Esq., died in 1837, aged 84, and practised in Cirencester as a surgeon for upwards of fifty years. His elder son was the late Sir William Lawrence, Bart., F.R.S., who was twice President of the Royal College of Surgeons, and for many years Sergeant-Surgeon to the Queen. THE NORTH CHANCEL AISLE, OR CHAPEL OF ST. CATHERINE, retains in the foundations of the southern and western walls and in the masonry of the northern wall to the height of six or seven feet portions of the original Norman building ; the last named is very massive, like all early building, but except in the little doorway now leading to the Lady Chapel the Norman work has been redressed, the original stonework having been thus treated in the"], [142, "114 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. erection of the fifteenth century arcade, the mouldings of which like those of the tower entrance are all incised on the chamfer planes in the manner that became prevalent in the transition from the Decorated Gothic. The extent of this chapel eastward before the formation of the arcade is clearly marked by the dripstone of the Lady Chapel in its northern wall and the plinth of the Chancel on the opposite side, to show which the altar steps have been partly cut away. The clerestory in the north wall was built and the chapel raised in height subsequent to the dissolution of the Abbey, in order to receive the beautiful stone fan tracery constructed only a few years before, probably for the Abbey cloisters. The clerestory lights had been at some time blocked up, probably with the view of preventing the fan tracery vaulting from giving way; this eminently unscientific method so characteristic of the 17th and 18th centuries had, however, only been effectual in concealing some of the beauties and in lessening the light of the chapel ; the roofing continued to yield, and in 1866, before the scaffolding and centering could be fixed to repair it, some actually came to grief ; it has now been reset and secured with iron cramps, and a portion at the west end executed afresh. Some of the devices upon the pater\u00e6 have been picked out in colour. The royal arms within the garter are those of Henry VII., the initials T. R., with the Cognizances of the Prince of Wales, the eagle and ostrich feather, refer to Henry, afterwards \" the Eighth,\" and to Thomas Ruthall, Bishop of Durham, and the initials J. H., 1508, repeated in several places, to Abbot John Hakeborne and the date of its original construction; and C. J., 1866, with a pastoral staff carved on the restored bay, to Charles James Ellicott, the present Bishop of Gloucester and Bristol. The altar steps escaped the general demolition of objects connected with the medi\u00e6val ritual ; the tiled floor and marble steps are, however, new work of 1867, the former paving being of stone. The remains of a piscina are to be seen in the north wall, but, like the adjacent chapels, the eastern wall must have been rebuilt since the Reformation, as no traces of either altar remain. According to Rudder and his transcribers, the chapel of St. Catherine was founded by Richard Osmund, bursar to Abbot Robert (1183-1187) ; it is almost needless to say that this is incorrect. The Osmund whose effigy is placed in the recess on the north side is that of Richard Osmund, date 1517 (see Mr. Fuller's remarks). It appears, however, that it was removed there from one of the arches of the adjacent arcade, and that this recess was originally prepared for the tomb of John Avenyng,1 who died in 1501. 1 The wills of John Avenyng and Thomas Radway, of Cirencester, were proved in 1501, before the Commissary of the Prior of Canterbury \u2014 see 8th Report Public Records."], [143, "115 THE PARISH CHURCH. In the recess, above the effigy, and also in the one opposite, oak chests were placed, subsequent to the Reformation, which contained \" The Book of Homilies,\" \" Foxe's Book of Martyrs,\" \" A faithful exhortation to the reading and knowledge of Holy Scripture,\" and some other old works chained to the inside. From an \u00e6sthetic point of view the church has lost nothing by the removal of these chests, but whilst there they served to remind of the earnest zeal of our Puritan forefathers for the dissemination of Gospel truth in an age when cheap Bibles were unknown, and good literature not easily attainable. The tomb with shields in the Lady Chapel arcade was built up from materials discovered at the restoration (see Mr. Fuller's work) ; the turret stairs at the western end were raised at the same time for access to the space between the ceiling and outer roofing, from whence through a small door the remainder of the roofing of the eastern end can be reached. The glass in the east window commemorates the late William Cripps, Esq., M.P., and other members of the family. It was designed and executed by Mr. Warrington, in 1851. The subjects represented in the lower compartments refer to the visit of our Lord to the house of the two sisters at Bethany and the raising of their brother Lazarus from the dead. The smaller figures in the upper part are intended for the twelve apostles. The clerestory windows depict various scenes connected with the story of St. Catherine, and the small light at the eastern end of the north wall (which was the gift of two ladies, Mrs. Clifford and Mrs. Hallewell, in memory of their father, Joseph Cripps, Esq., who died in 1859) commemorates her supposed martyrdom by the torture of the wheel. To Mr. Fuller's work (pages 53-55) we must refer our readers for more information respecting the altars and frescoes formerly in this chapel; that of St. Christopher on the north side was touched up by Professor Church in 1867. THE LADY CHAPEL, OR CHAPEL OF ST. MARY. A reference to the plan will show that this chapel did not form a part of the original Norman structure. The foundations and the crypt or charnel vault below are part of the earliest Lady Chapel erected in the twelfth century. A small fragment of the early mosaic tile paving with which the floor was probably originally laid remains ; the rest of the pavement of this chapel is made up almost entirely with monumental stones, some containing brasses ; most belong to the chapel, but several were brought from other parts of the church during the late restoration. At that time the pavement was necessarily much disturbed, and, amongst other things brought to light, a black marble slab effigy was found with the face downward, the P"], [144, "116 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. smooth back serving its purpose as a flooring stone excellently. The figure is that of an ecclesiastic of rank, but the head is gone, and the lozenge-shaped breast-plate is conspicuous only by its absence. From the style of the draperies it is, however, of the early part of the thirteenth century, and may have been intended for one of the early abbots, possibly Neccham. It is now placed on an altar tomb in one of the openings of the adjoining arcade. Close by is the portion of a memorial stone with the simple inscription \" Ella Tayleur,\" in 13th century characters, the lower member of the cusped cross incised on the same stone alone remains ; the other incised stones are of the same early period. One contains a perfect cross ; another early stone bears the initial letters T. S. only. The brasses are exceedingly interesting (see Mr. Fuller's remarks) ; the inscriptions are given further on ; they date from the middle of the fourteenth century to the early part of the seventeenth century, and include those of a man and his wife at the east end, Wm. Nottingham and his wife, John Benett and his two wives (one destroyed), Hugh Norys and Johanna his wife, and Mr. and Mrs. Gunter. The combination of the Saxon \" Ella \" with the Norman \" Tayleur \" is suggestive of the union of the conquerors and conquered. Little respect was paid in the Renaissance period to earlier monuments ; the indent of what must have been a very elaborate brass cross is partially covered by the large monument of \" Humfrey Bridges.\" The crypt is approached by a modern flight of steps from the outside, the original doorway opening remains, and an Early English incised memorial slab is preserved in the lintel ; the ceiling is of groined stone ; for nearly two centuries it was used as a vault for members of the Master family, and the entrance outside had become blocked up with the accumulated soil to the height of two feet above the present level. The eastern portion is now walled off, and filled with human remains collected in 1865 from various parts of the church, like the Garstang vault ; the remainder is utilised for the hot-air apparatus of Messrs. Haden and Co. The exterior walls and the low pitched timbered roof of the Lady Chapel are fifteenth century in style ; the roof, however, like those of the nave and aisles, was taken off (1865-67), extensively repaired and recon structed ; a great part of the north wall, too, fell down early in the present century and was rebuilt, the former one probably from the great thickness of the walls contained much of the twelfth century masonry, having been treated in the fifteenth century similarly to the arcade in the wall opposite. The original altar space remains, likewise the niche and fragments of the piscina. The ancient register of this chapel is amongst the Dugdale MSS, in the Bodleian Library, at Oxford. From this it appears that its revenues from estates and other sources must have been"], [145, "117 THE PARISH CHURCH. considerable. See also Valor Eccl. (extract from). On the south side, over the little Norman doorway, is a relic of fresco work ; the subject is purgatory, sinners being represented as tormented by the most hideous looking demons, whilst others are engaged bringing in a cartload of the condemned to endure similar torture ; this and the similar paintings which probably covered the walls were unquestionably intended to act as potent auxiliaries to the enrichment of the shrines of the saints for whom services were performed in the church. The glass in the east window was presented some years since by T. W. C. Master, Esq., of the Abbey, in commemoration of Miss Jane Master, and her sister, Lady Carteret, and illustrates our Lord's teaching concerning the Resurrection. Amongst other subjects depicted are the sorrow of the sisters at Bethany for the loss of Lazarus, and Christ's assur ance, \" I am the Resurrection and the Life ; \" and the evidence of Christ's Resurrection and His appearance to Mary Magdalene, with His announcement of His coming Ascension. The large freestone monument to Humphrey Bridges, his wife, and eleven children, is interesting, on account of the costumes ; underneath the soffite of an entablature supported by slender fluted Corinthian columns are the figures of the man, dressed as a lawyer, and his wife, in the close fitting dress and stiff ruff of James I.'s time. These figures are recumbent and their hands are clasped in prayer, as are those of the kneeling figures of their adult sons, likewise lawyers ; it is noteworthy that the recumbent figures are of the conventional Gothic type to which the sculptors of the time still clung, the kneeling figures mark the commencement of a new era in this department of art, but in neither is there that ease and repose which appertains to the works of both earlier and later artists ; on this pedestal are the miniature effigies of their remaining children, viz., one son and eight daughters. The reclining figure on the marble altar tomb is that of Sir William Master, Knt., distinguished for his loyalty to Charles I., who rested at his house on two occasions. He died in 1661. There are several other mural monuments to members of the Master family on the wall opposite. The busts and marble tablets underneath the east window are those of the first and second Earls Bathurst, with their consorts. They were removed many years since from Trinity Chapel. (See Rudder, p. 290.) The oak screen which enclosed the space known as the \"Jesus Chapel \" in the south aisle has been already stated to have been removed in 1867 to this chapel for a robing room for the choristers. Upon the row of shields in the lower part are carved alternately the arms and devices of Garstang, so that there is excellent ground for assuming that it was constructed at his expense. The painted shields on the classic cornice bear the arms of Bathurst, Master, Monox, Atkyns, Cox, Coxwell, Smyth, impaling Master and How of Guiting as benefactors to the"], [146, "118 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. church ; this entablature was added at the beginning of the last century, and appears to have been substituted for an \" arch \" ( ,) on which was the following inscription : \u2014 \" Orate pro aia dni Johis Pratt, quondam Capellani, p'petue cantarii beate Marie, in ecclia Sti Joh'is Baptiste, Cirencestr ; qui obiit A\u00b0. Dni. M\u00b0CCCCLXX. Cujus aia p'pitietur Deus.\" The screens separating the chancel and adjacent chapels from the western part of the church are similar in character to this screen. Within the choristers' vestry, in the western wall is a hagioscope which communicated with Trinity Chapel. THE SOUTH PORCH, \"Parvise,\" or \"Vice,\" as it appears to have been frequently called in the 1 7th century, is one of the largest and most splendid adjuncts of its kind possessed by any church in the kingdom. Exclusive of the buttresses on the flank walls it has a frontage of 38' 10\" to the Market-place, the average1 height of the same being 48' 4\" to the top of the battlements, and 55' 2\" to that of the incomplete pinnacles, the projection from the face of the church being about 40 feet. It was almost entirely rebuilt 50 years ago, in consequence of the injury sustained by the removal of the adjacent houses in 1831, whereby the former party walls between the porch and the houses, honeycombed with flues, and weakened by the withdrawal of the bearing timbers, became unequal to the extra strain upon them, as the outside flank walls of a lofty detached building. Mr. W. Wilson, a draughtsman of the town, was accordingly instructed to prepare the necessary drawings, and the work was ably carried out by Mr. George Mills, a local builder. The stones of the Market-place faijade were all numbered, and as far as possible reset in their former positions ; the pinnacles are new, one only of the original, and that in a most deplorable condition, remaining as a guide for their reconstruction. It is just to the late Mr. Wilson to state that in his design the finials which should terminate them were not omitted as unfortunately they were in the execution. The flank walls were also designed by him, and in this case, as the porch must have been originally built between houses, without anything to suggest the satisfactory finish he has made. The porch proper (or passage to the church) the crypt below and the turret staircases were (we believe) not interfered with, but the upper part which was in two stories was thrown into the present lofty apartment. What the original object of the edifice was is uncertain. At the Arch\u00e6ological Meeting in 1868, Mr. Roberts suggested that the upper part may have been used as a muniment room, \u2014 possibly so, but it must have been intended for something more, as this 1 There is a fall of several inches in the pavement in the frontage of the building."], [147, "THE P4AJHSH CHURCH. 119 will not satisfactorily account for so large a building. Mr. Fuller refers to documents indicative of its having superseded an earlier porch and suggests, as the church tavern stood in the open space on the eastern side, from which the stairs lead to the crypt, that the upper stories may have been used for meetings of the guilds, and the crypt as a cellar to the tavern, and this seems the most reasonable explanation. Mr. Fuller admits also the possibility of the rooms or a portion of them being occupied by the chantry priests. It was built about the year 1500, and Leland writing between thirty and forty years later refers to it as \"the right goodly porche,\" stating that Ruthall's mother's sister, \"Alice Aveling \" ( , Avening, who with her husband was buried in St. Catherine's Chapel in 1501, as per inscription), \" gave a hundred marks,\" = \u00a366 13s. 4d., towards it; and this gift was supple- mented with the subscriptions of his own mother and others (principally inhabitants of the town \u2014 see Rudder). It is likewise called a porch in other early writings, but none refer to the intended use of the apartments. It is worthy of note that in the arches between the piers in the crypt from which the groins of the stone vaulting spring there appear to have been doors or iron gates which would have separated it into one large and two smaller cellars. The pivots upon which the iron hinges worked still remain fixed in hanging stones. Mr. Fuller has given some interesting particulars of the use to which the building was converted after the Reformation. In 1672 it was licensed for parish purposes by Bishop Nicholson, when, as it is said, \" the Vice was made a Towne Hall,\" and so it has continued ever since. In 1679 the assizes for the county were held at Cirencester.1 It was the seat of the administration of justice until the removal of the Petty Sessions and County Court to their own building in Castle-street, 1859. A figure of Justice is carved over the bastard Italian doorway, made 200 years since, and leading from the Church passage to the principal staircase ; there is a raised platform with seats for the magistrates and jurymen in a recess on the north side of the hall, and above this is an upper platform capable of being screened off by a sliding partition for a jury room ; from these access can be obtained to the Church by means of the eastern turret stair- case ; the western one leading to the roof. The portion of the building under the hall and west of the passage to the Church is divided into two stories, and utilised for lumber, but it is scarcely conceivable that so small a space could ever have been, prior to 1833, the residence of the under-sexton, yet such, we are informed, was the case. At this time the porch was open to the Market-place, and the doorway leading from it on the western side to what is now a green then led to the Church alley between miserable tenements built in front of the tower and 1 Bigland's Gloucestershire,"], [148, "120 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. south aisle. On the upper panels of the framework of this door, and the one opposite leading to the Churchyard, are carved in relief representations of the six-winged seraphim (Isaiah vi.), which are attempted in so much of the ancient and modern stained glass. The carving is 15th century workmanship, the rest of the doors two centuries or more later. The fan tracery of the roof resembles that of St. Catherine's Chapel and that of the Cloisters of Gloucester Cathedral, although the latter is of earlier date ; the initials carved upon it probably refer to the contributors to its erection. An inspection of the noble front will render any description needless beyond that which is explan atory of its details. The first peculiarity is the unequal widths of the three bays between the buttresses; this is explained by the frontage having been limited to the space between the adjacent buildings coupled to the necessity of making the central division opposite the blocked up bay in the church ; the arrangement of the turret staircase and part of the building next the Church is unquestionably a \" device \" to avoid blocking up more than one bay of the Church, but whether Bishop Nicholson and others of his time were correct in deriving the name \"Vice\" from the word \" device \" is questionable. On the string course, immediately above the entrance, are carved figures, nine in number, including a buffoon, dogs at play and conventional animals, and underneath the battlements is another range of twelve figures, some of which are modern ; these may have been intended to represent the dramatis person\u0153 of one of the mysteries like those below the nave battlements, but this is uncertain. It will be noticed that a course of sunk quatrefoils divides the upper and lower oriel windows ; this marks the former division of the upper stories. The pedestals in the niches are stated to have carried figures of the twelve apostles, and the small pinnacles issuing from the weather tables of the buttresses are supposed to be emblematical of the four Gospels. The projections of the oriel windows are continued to the top of the battlements, and these are pierced with elegant tracery. MONUMENTS AND INSCRIPTIONS. Rudder (1800) has given in full the inscriptions within the Church in his time, and Bigland (1781) has included those in the Churchyard. Some of the memorial stones which are mentioned by the former, and formed part of the pavement of the Church, are now laid between the railed space between the tower and north aisle, whilst numbers of those given by Bigland must have long since perished. They fill a considerable space in his work, and are a valuable record to the memory of the departed. Mr. Savory has preserved in his history (1858) the inscriptions in the Unitarian graveyard, but with every desire to pay respect to the"], [149, "121 THE PARISH CHURCH. dead, it would be impossible, and further, outside the province of this work, to attempt to repeat the vastly increased number now in the cemetery and graveyards of the town, and to name some and omit others would be an offence against good taste. The following memorials in the Church are given, some in extenso, as of especial interest, and therefore possessed of a just claim for insertion in a description of this most interesting edifice. On the wall of the north aisle over the porch are marble tablets to Mrs. Susanna Rawes, to Captain John Day (subscribed for by the participators in his bounty), the Rev. William Shippen Willes, the perpetual curate of Cirencester, 1785-1807; the Rev. Henry Anthony Pye, his successor, who died in 1839 ; also to inhabitants of the names of Cox, Seise, Bridget Hughes, Eyles, Guerin, and Clutterbuck, with two others not legible from below, but which are probably the same as those given in Rudder for John and Richard Gastrell and the Rev. Joseph Kilner. The Gastrell inscription is a lengthy typical example of the laudatory self-righteous epitaphs of the Georgian era. Richard Gastrell was steward of Cirencester manor and an attorney. He died in 17 36, \u00e6t 57. His son, John Gastrell, a native of the town, died in 1767, in the 45th year of his age, and was buried in the churchyard of St. Mary-le-Strand, Middlesex, in which parish he was apprenticed and had been in business. The close of his career is thus referred to, viz., that by his Unblemisht conduct he obtained the good will of all ranks of People, Acquired a decent Fortune And bequeathed it to his Relatives and Friends With a clear Head and a benevolent Heart. The Rev. Joseph Kilner, collector of the Kilner MSS., died in 1793, aged 72 years. The handsome marble monument to the memory of Mrs. Rebecca Powell, so well known as the foundress of the \" Powell's Schools,\" and of her husband, Thomas Powell, and former husband, William Georges, is affixed to the eastern wall of the south aisle, and contains a long inscription referring to the charity bequests for which the town is indebted to them. The busts of each are placed on the entablature, and their heraldic bearings incised on the face of the monument. Mrs. Powell survived both her husbands and died in 1722. The small brass tablets on the south wall include members of the Edwards, Forder, and other families, resident here during last century (Nicholas Edwards and his wife having contributed to the charities of the town) ; and the marble monument near the entrance is that of Sir Thomas Roe, ambassador to Gustavus Adolphus, who died in the reign of Charles I. On the wall of the north aisle, at the entrance to the Lady"], [150, "122 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. Chapel, is the little brass effigy of Philip Marner, an old man in a gown with a pair of shears, a trade device above him and a dog at his feet, and underneath the following running epitaph : \u2014 In Lent by will a sermon he deuised And yerely precher with a noble prised Seuen nobles hee did geue ye poore for to defend And \u00a380 to xvi. men did lend In Ciseter Burford Abingdon & Tetburie Ever to be to them a stocke yerely Philip Marner who died in the yere 1587. A reference to the chapter on the charities will explain this epitaph. The value of the English \" noble \" (coin of course) is 6s. 8d. In the Trinity Chapel, under the canopy of the western doorway, is a beautiful white marble memorial, including a basso-relievo portrait of Lieut.-Col. the Hon. Seymour Thomas Bathurst, father of the present Earl, with the following inscription : To the memory of Lieut. -Col. the Hon. Seymour Thomas Bathurst, Third Son of Henry, iii. Earl Bathurst, KG., Born October xxvii., mdccxcv., Died April x., mdcccxxxiv. On corbels adjacent are busts of Allen, first Earl Bathurst, who died in 1775; Catherine, his consort, who died in 1768; and Henry, the second Earl Bathurst, whose death occurred in 1794. In a canopied recess on the same wall is a raised marble portrait of the uncle of the present Earl, and the inscription, Henry George, 4th Earl Bathurst, Nat. Feb. 24, 1790, Ob. Mai 25, 1866. \"The memory of the just is blessed.\" Prov. 10, 7. Also, a brass plate, In memory of William Lennox, 5th Earl Bathurst, Born Feb. 14, 1791, Died Feb. 24, 1878. On the north wall are engraved brass tablets, inscribed as follows : \u2014"], [151, "\"WhiiPman.&Biss.i^^i'o-ZiMo London."], [152, ""], [153, "123 THE PARISH CHURCH. In affec. memory of Julia, Daughter of John Hankey, Esq., Widow of Lieut-Col. the Honble. Seymour Bathurst, Born April 2d, 1798, Died Feb'y. 22d, 1877. This tablet is erected by her sorrowing children, Allen, 6th Earl Bathurst, and Mary E. Selina Bathurst. In loving memory of the Hon. Muriel Leicester Bathurst, Second daughter of George Warren, 2d Baron de Tabley, Wife of Allen, afterwards 6th Earl Bathurst, Born November 25th, 1839, Married January 30th, 1862, Died July 6th, 1872. The memorial window to Mrs. Cripps has been referred to in the description of the chapel. The shield of Richard Dixton, Knight, is painted on this wall. Another brass tablet to the memory of Miss Bathurst, the only and lamented sister of the present Earl, is thus inscribed : \u2014 In memory of Mary Selina Bathurst, Daughter of Lt. -Colonel Honble. Seymour Bathurst, Born Sep. 14th, 1834, Died March 16th, 1883. and beneath the fresco representing the martyrdom of St. Erasmus is a brass memorial tablet to Lady Georgina Bathurst, the sister of the late Earl. She died 27th March, 1874, in her 82nd year. A large engraved brass plate under the reredos records its restoration in 1867 by the same lady, in memory of her father, mother, and two younger brothers interred in the vault beneath. Close by on the south wall is a marble tablet, sacred to the memory of Apsley, brother of the third Earl, born 1769, died 1816. Also a brass tablet to Lady Emily Ponsonby, sister of Lady Georgina Bathurst, placed there at the expense of her two sons. In the altar pace, which is of grey unpolished marble, the ancient brasses before referred to are as follows : \u2014 Q"], [154, "124 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. 1. The brass of an ecclesiastic dressed in his canonicals with the inscription, Orate pro anima dni Radulphi Parsons quondam capellan' p'petue Ste Trinitatis in hac ecclia fundate, qui obiit xxix0 die Augusti A0 d'ni Mcccc\u00b0lxviii\u00b0 cuj' aie p'piciet' deus. Amen. This brass was formerly in the body of the Church. The cope of Ralph Parsons still remains. 2. The next brass contains the figures of a man and his wife, each under a beautifully executed canopy, with fourteen children \u2014 six sons and eight daughters \u2014 at their feet. The inscription is now destroyed, but is said to have been, Hie jacet Robertus Pagge cum Margareta sibi sponsa prole fecunda Vicinis gratus fuerat mercator amatus Pacificus plenis manibus subventor egenis Ecclesiisque ; viis ornator et his reparator Mill C quater .... quater et anno sed Aprilis Octava luce mortem pertransit luce Celi solamen De' illi conferat. Amen. Originally labels issued from the mouths of man and wife. The impress only of the former remains ; the latter is partly destroyed, but in Rudder's time, when the inscription above was in esse, was inscribed with the words That to the Trinite for us pray synge or rede. Mr. Fuller gives the full verse. The large figure of the man in full armour under an exquisitely wrought canopy is that of Richard Dixton. His coat of arms \u2014 \"a pile over all a chevron\" \u2014 is engraved on the pommel of his sword. On a brass border, sunk in the stone round its edges, was the following inscription : \u2014 [Hie jacet Ricardus] Dixton Armiger qui obiit die sancti Laurencii [Martyris Anno dni] MCCCCxxxviii\u00b0 cujus anime propicietur [de' Amen], The words in parenthesis are destroyed. The next brass is that of William Prelatte and his two wives, each of the figures and the inscriptions are perfect ; of the shields the indents only remain. The man, like Dixton, is attired in full armour of an elaborate and somewhat fantastic character. The inscription runs thus : \u2014 Hie sepeliuntur Willms Prelatte Armiger specialissm' benefactor huj' Capelle Agnes nup' uxor Johannis Martyn et Johana filia et heres Ricardi de Cobyndon Relicta Johannis Twynyho de Cays orde in Comitatu Soms.

Between this and the north wall is the brass of Reginald Spycer and his four wives. The inscription is Hie jacet Reginaldus Spycer quondam m'cator isti' ville qui obiit ix\u00b0 die Julii Anno d'ni mill'mo cccc\u00b0xlii\u00b0 et Margareta Juliana Margareta ac Johna uxores ei' quor aiabs p'picietur d's. Amen. There are also some fragments of brasses without inscriptions. The Merton brass given in Rudder, if it ever existed, has long since been removed. The date, St. Lawrence's day, 1338, is remarkable as the earliest in the church, and as the centenary of Dixton's. IN THE PAVEMENT OF THE LADY CHAPEL are inserted the following memorial stones and brasses : \u2014 A brass of a man and his wife at the head of the cross before referred to as partially covered by the Bridges monument. Mr. Fuller supposes this to refer to a member of the Gotorest family, wine merchants of Bristol, and connected with this town in the 14th century. The broken inscription is as follows : \u2014 Margeria Conjunx femina pia . . . . (i) nopes reper . . . gaudia quod subeat, tempore viii cunctis meritis illis sit vita perhennis. A much mutilated brass of a merchant and his wife lies adjacent. Also, inserted in 1867, the memorial brasses of William Nottingham and his consort. He was the founder of the Weaver's guild in this town. The inscription runs thus : \u2014 Orate pro aiabus Willi Notyngham et cristine uxoris eius qui quidem Will'ms obiit xxi\u00b0 die mensis Novembris Anno d'ni Mill'mo cccc\u00b0xxvii\u00b0 et predict' Christina obiit iiii0 die Julii A0 dni M\u00b0cccc\u00b0xxxiii\u00b0 q\u00b0r aiabs p'piciet' deus. Amen. In another stone, formerly in the Trinity Chapel, were inserted the figures of a man, his two wives, and eight children. The figures appear to have been perfect in the time of Rudder (1800), but now one of the female figures and two of the children are lost, and the greater part of the inscription. When complete, however, it ran thus : \u2014 Orate pro aiabus Johannis Benett ac Agnetis ac Agnetis uxorum suarum qui quidem Joh'es obiit decimo nono (die mensis Julii anno d'ni Millimo cccc0 nonages' septimo quorum aiabus p'piciet deus). On a scroll over his head is written, Seta Trinitas unus Deus miserere nobis."], [156, "126 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. Over the head of one wife, Spiritus s'ct' de' miserere nobis. Over the head of the other wife was this scroll, destroyed prior to 1800, Fili redemptor mundi miserere nobis. John Benett appears to have been a contributor to the re-erection of the body of the church. He was evidently a merchant, his trade mark appearing at his feet. Another brass close by is that of an ecclesiastic in a cassock ; the inscription, if ever there were one, is destroyed. Removed from St. Catherine's Chapel are the little brass effigies of Mr. John Gunter and Alice his wife ; this inscription is in Roman capitals, and runs thus : \u2014 M. John Gvnter and Alice, his wife, being fvll as of years so of bounty and charity, are gathered to their fathers in peace. Shee was here bvryed 18\u00b0 Martii A0 Dni 1626, aged 86 years. He was bvryed at Kyntbvry in the county of Berks with the like monument 2do Janvarii A0 Dni 1624 aged 89 years. Ios. Platt. Ar. Eorvndm. Gener et Execr. Hoc Posvit. A brass tablet near the east end records the death of Hodgkinson Paine, clothier, who was killed at the siege of the town by Prince Rupert with the Parliamentary colours in his hand. The epitaph is a play upon his name : \u2014 Here lyeth bvried ye Body of Hodgkinson Paine, clothier, who died ye 3rd of Feb., 1642. The poore's supplie his life and calling grac't 'till warre's made rent and Paine from poore displac't But what made poore vnfortunate Paine blest by warre they lost their Paine, yet found noe rest. Hee looseing quiet by Warre yet gained ease by it Paine's life began, and paine did cease And from ye troubles here him God did sever by death to life, by Warre to peace for ever. Close by is the following in memory of his wife, who survived her unfortunate husband twenty-six years : \u2014 Here lieth the body of Elizabeth Paine, deceased the 8th day of January, An. Do. 1668. One was our thought, One life wee sought, One rest we both intended, Our bodies have To sleepe one grave, Our soules to God ascended. These and the following epitaph of the pre-Reformation era (which with several fragments of brasses are placed in the wall near the east end of the Chapel) came from the south aisle : \u2014"], [157, "THE PARISH CHURCH. 127 Reyse gracious Jhu to endless lyfe at thy grete dome where all schall apere, Hughe Norys groc' and Johan his wyf nowe dede in graue and beryed here yo' p'yers desyring There soules for chere the x day of July the yere of our Lord God MCCCCCXXIX. (Although in rhyme this inscription is written continuously like prose.) Above this epitaph (when in the south aisle) used to be the brazen effigies of a man and his wife, and on labels proceeding from their mouths was written : \u2014 Mercy God of my misdeede, Lady help at my most neede. Another brass tablet is thus inscribed : \u2014 Margaret Hooper, wife to Henry Hooper, was buried here upon the fourth day of March, 1601 : \u2014 Oh wretched world, vayne & vnsvre, As I am fledd from Thee, Soe mayst thov dye within an houre, Then thou shalte followe me. Andrew Sollace, whose decease is recorded on another brass tablet, was a magistrate of the town. His signature heads the petition to Charles I. for restoration to the royal favour. The monument against the south wall to Sir William Master, who died in 1661, and memorial tablets of other members of the family, have been before referred to, as likewise the large freestone monument to Humphrey Bridges and his family, in the north east angle. The inscription on the latter records that \u2014 Here lyeth the bodies of Humfrey Bridges and Elizabeth his wife. He dyed the 17 of April 1598. She dyed the 6 of July 1620. They had both sonnes and daught8. He gave 40s. yeerely for ever to the poore of this towne. Shee gave 6 habitations for 6 poore widowes with 6s. weekly for ever.

Fil. jun. de Medio Templo obijt 2\u00b0 Aug. 1617. Each of the miniature figures of the one son and eight daughters attached to the pedestal have books in their hands. In the pavement at the west end of this monument is part of a stone incised in 15th century characters for Richard Grace. The brass tablet beneath the East window is in memory ot Miss Master, who died in 1862, and her sister Lady Carteret, who died in 1863. These ladies gave their hearty support to the Rev. Prebendary Powell in his project for restoring the Church,"], [158, "128 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. and were amongst the earliest subscribers to the fund, although neither lived to see the work commenced. The mural monument of the Bathurst family refers to the life and virtues of the first Earl and his Lady. Underneath are the family quarterings, and on another monument adjacent is inscribed \u2014 In Memory of Henry Earl Bathurst, Son and Heir of Allen Earl Bathurst, And of Dame Catherine his Wife. His Ambition was to render himself not unworthy of such Parents. He was born on the second day of May 1714. O.S. And died on the sixth day of August 1794. N.S. Near this is a marble tablet to Tryphena, second Countess of Bathurst, who died in 1807. Amongst other memorials placed here is that inside the choristers' vestry to Samuel Rudder, the historian of Gloucester shire. He was a native of Uley, in this county, and for a great number of years resided in this town, and carried on a drapery, stationery, and printing establishment. Several of his publications are extant; his county history compiled from Atkyns' earlier work appeared in 1778. He likewise wrote a history of Gloucester City. He died March 15th, 1801, in the 75th year of his age ; his wife only three months earlier (December 29th, 1800), aged 76. The custom of recording the virtues of deceased relatives so prevalent in Rudder's time does not commend itself to present taste, but the statement that he was \" a man of the strictest honour and most inflexible integrity \" is amply borne out by his works, which breathe an eminently religious spirit, and never fail to protest against wrong doing in every shape. His remarks upon elections and duties of electors prove him to have been far in advance of his time. His father, who died at Uley in 1771, at the age of 84, was a lifelong vegetarian (see \" Good and Great Men of Gloucestershire,\" by Mr. Stratford, p. 220). ST. CATHERINE'S CHAPEL. The effigy in the recess on the north side of the altar pace is that of Richard Osmund. The flat stones to the memory of Kemble, Perry, Saunders, and others were removed, in 1865, to the Lady Chapel. The Perry memorial is a blue stone recording the death of Thomas Perry, March 20, 1706-7, and his wife, Mercy Perry, in 1668. The arms \u2014 a fess embattled between three pears is another instance of canting heraldry. Of the same character is the white marble tablet rolled up at one corner like a skin of parchment to Jonathan Skinn, who died in 1791."], [159, "129 THE PARISH CHURCH. The mural monument of white marble is to the memory of Joseph Cripps, Esq., whose son and namesake represented the town in Parliament for many years. An inscription on the wall to John George, lord of the manor of Baunton, and at the period of the Dissolution steward of the Abbey Estates, is noteworthy as a tribute to purgatory after the Reformation, or rather during the temporary revival of Catholic ascendancy under Queen Mary. It is as follows : \u2014 Pray for the souls of John George and Alice his wife, who were buried here, which John decessid the 8th day of October 1556. And the said Alice decessid the 3d day of May, 1557, and had four sons and eight daughters. The memorial to John and Alice Avening, formerly on the north wall of the altar pace, but which has for many years been lost, is remarkable on account of the death of both man and his wife on the same day. The will of John Avening is still extant, and Alice Avening has been before named as a contributor to the erection of the church and porch. The inscription ran thus : \u2014 Sub hoc tumulo requiescunt corpora Iohanis Avening et Alicie uxoris ejus qui obierunt xiiii die Aprilis anno Dni 1501. Another memorial to a little girl, Mercy Dansey, formerly in this chapel, had disappeared like the Avenings' in Rudder's time. It was the production of Mr. Carles, vicar of Cirencester, and combines the merit of a touching composition with the inevitable play upon words in epitaphs of the time. It was thus worded : \u2014 Loe cruel death hath hurryed hence A little world of innocence. Thus early fruits are often found, Like her, betimes, dropt to the ground. Mercy's not lost ; here's only one From misery to mercy gone. Posuit T.C. In the chancel were the following monuments before the restoration of the Church. Immediately before the steps leading to the communion table, on two lozenges of white marble, the initials \u2014 J. H. C. H. 1753. 1733. referring to Joseph Harrison, M.A., perpetual curate of Ciren cester, 1690-1753, and Catherine his wife. Close by, on another stone, a memorial to his youngest son, Sir Thomas Harrison, Knight, Chamberlain of the City of London, who died in 1765, and Dorothea his wife. Another flat stone recorded the death of Roger Burgoyne, M.D., December 21st, 1674, aged 46, with the heraldic bearings, \u2014 Parted per pale baron femme \u2014 1. A chevron between three talbots, on a chief embattled three martlets. 2. Six roundlets, 3, 2, 1, on a chief, a lion passant."], [160, "130 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. Upon a mural monument on the right hand of the altar an inscription to Dorothea, wife of the Rev. William Shippen Willes, perpetual curate of Cirencester, who died after a wedded life of eleven months only, at the early age of 26, February 19th, 1795. Above this record is carved in relief the figure of our Saviour ascending in the clouds, and below the description of a virtuous woman given in Proverbs xxxi., slightly altered in wording. A small marble tablet on the opposite wall is to the memory of the Rev. Samuel Johnson, M.A., who succeeded Mr. Harrison as minister of Cirencester, and officiated for 24 years. Subse quently he became one of the vicars of Bampton, Oxon, and died there in 1784. Other memorials, to the Seise family, John Cripps, Esq. (1771), and his wife Elizabeth (1758), John Cripps, Esq. (1793), Mr. Edward Wilbraham, woolstapler (1771), and his wife (1753), and others, are also removed. Stones, with Latin inscriptions, to the memory of Thomas Carles, M.A., perpetual curate of this parish and rector of Barnsley, who died Oct. 7, 1675, aged 50, and of William Freame, surgeon, who died Oct. 24, 1678, aged 58, formerly lay where Mr. Harrison's was subsequently placed. IN ST. JOHN'S CHAPEL. On a flat stone now removed was the following epitaph, which, like that of Mercy Dansey, is illustrative of the taste of the period, although destitute of its religious teaching : \u2014 Here resteth the body of Mary Olive, a pretty little tender branch of Robert and Elizabeth Olive, who departed this life October 30th, 1701. The other monuments are given in the description of the chapel. IN THE SOUTH PORCH. Against the wall was formerly this humble memorial : \u2014 Under your Feet lyeth the Body of William Cletherow, Gent., an humble Penitent, who thoughte himselfe unworthy of the lowest Place in the House of God. He departed this life the 8th day of November, 1680. The tradition a century later (in Rudder's time) was that Mr. Cletherow had killed a man, and was unhappy ever afterwards. THE CHURCHYARD. Of the monuments in the Churchyard, the most noticable is the large raised tomb, with the lengthy Latin inscriptions (as given in Rudder) to the memory of John Adye, his wife, and sister Maria, who was married to Richard Ainge ; Maria, the daughter of the last named Richard, and Marian Ainge, and Richmond Day, her husband, merchant of Bristol, with other relatives. The date of the earliest death named on the tomb is 1724, and of the latest 1759."], [161, "THE PARISH CHURCH. 131 The Churchyard appears in Kip's drawing, published in 1712, and has existed for several centuries. Until within the last twenty years one tombstone remained of the early part of the reign of Charles II. ; that has, however, disappeared, and there are now none earlier than the eighteenth century, and these scarcely legible, whilst most are comparatively recent. The Churchyard was extended between thirty and forty years ago, and in this newer part are some handsome stone tombs, including amongst others those of the 4th and 5th Earls Bathurst, the Rev. John Sayer Haygarth, &c. In 1867, it having become apparent that the additional burial space was fast being filled up, steps were taken for the formation of a Burial Board, and the Cemetery at Chesterton was opened about four years later. CHURCH RESTORATION, &C. A short recapitulation of the works carried out at the restoration will show more clearly than the foregoing scattered notices what was then actually accomplished. The high-backed pews and galleries were first removed, the flooring taken up, and the bodies (some laid just beneath the surface) re-interred. The whole area of the interior was then covered with six inches of concrete to prevent effluvia. The old oak seating, organ case, paving, &c, were sold by public auction. The roofs of the nave, choir, and their aisles, as well as of the Lady Chapel, were taken off, and the old timbers made good or replaced by new where necessary, several of the principal members of the roof trusses of the nave having decayed at their bearings to such an extent that it was providential that they had not long before fallen. The roof boarding was generally renewed, and that for the leaded roofs covered with felt to render them perfectly air tight for the more effectual working of the heating apparatus, and to prevent the oxidation of the metal. The foundations of the columns and walls were under-pinned and carried down twelve or fifteen feet below the surface to the gravel substratum ; the south arcade of the chancel and the eastern respond of the nave arcade rebuilt, in consequence of the roofs having thrust each out of the perpen dicular ; all whitewash removed and walls thoroughly cleaned ; the accumulation of earth on the north side dug away, and Welsh brick paving on nine-inch concrete, with proper drainage, continued nearly round the church. The battlements and canopied niches over the eastern gables of the nave and aisles entirely renewed, and likewise the battlements of the flank walls of the north aisle and of the Trinity and Lady Chapels, the other battlements undergoing thorough restoration. The masonry of the tower was not interfered with, except in the south-western fan of the vaulting. This had evidently long before exhibited symptoms of failure, and following the customary sham building which prevailed from the close of the 16th until the earlier years it"], [162, "132 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. of the present century, ribs of English oak had been introduced to replace the yielding members, and these had been whitewashed to resemble the stonework of the remainder of the vaulting \u2014 these timbers which had to support tons of masonry were fast decaying. The same deception had been practised in the north eastern respond of the nave arcade and in the roof of St. Catherine's Chapel. The eastern part of the church was much improved by the removal of the masonry which respectively blocked up the Lady Chapel arcade, the clerestory lights, and the windows within the communion rails. The stalls of Trinity Chapel were constructed some years before ; the remainder of the seating belongs to the restoration, and (excluding the chancel stalls and sedilia) was executed by a townsman, Mr. Bridges, who carried out the general contract. The flooring of the interior, except in the Trinity and Lady Chapels, is new, the design of the chancel pavement having been suggested by the discovery of an old tile marked with the lion of the Bigots, Earls of Norfolk ; the encaustic tiles were supplied by Messrs. Godwine, of Lugwardine works, near Hereford. The marble steps throughout the church have replaced dilapidated stone steps. The gas standards and fittings were supplied by Messrs. Potter & Son, of South Moulton-street, London, W. ; the hot-air apparatus by Messrs. Haden, of Trowbridge ; the eagle lectern by Hardman & Co., Birmingham, by whom were executed all the painted glass windows at and since the restoration. These, with the organ and reredos, constitute the principal items of work contained in the report then issued, involving an expenditure of \u00a313,706 2s. 3d. The pulling down of the old porch house, which belonged to the church, and the setting back of the Abbey wall, by permission of T. W. C. Master, Esq., in order to throw open the north side of the church, and some minor items, are not included in this amount, and these, together with the stained glass windows since inserted, the new clock and chiming apparatus, the new frame work for and rehanging of the bells, must have increased the total outlay since 1865 to about \u00a316,000. The re-opening services were held on Wednesday, November 27th, 1867, and two following days, the collection at the first morning service amounting to nearly \u00a3600. The order observed was as follows : \u2014 The bishop (Dr. Ellicott) and 108 neighbouring clergy, having attired in the Town Hall, walked, with the surpliced choirs in procession across the church green, and entering by the western doorway, proceeded up the centre of the church to the seats in the chancel aisles, the choirs occupying the stalls. The service which followed was full choral, and the sermon preached by the Bishop from Hebrews xii. 22-24, \" But ye are come unto mount Sion,\" &c. The sermon on the following Sunday was by the Rev. Canon Woodford, then vicar of"], [163, "THE PARISH CHURCH. 133 Kempsford, afterwards vicar of Leeds, and now Bishop of Ely. Dr. Ellicott in 1868 held his September ordination in the church, being the first held there since the Reformation, a previous one, when a great number of priests, &c, were ordained, having taken place in 1314.1 The service of plate belonging to the church is valuable and exceedingly interesting. A communion cup bearing date 1535 and engraved with the badge of Queen Anne Boleyn, and another of the year 1570, have been illustrated in the work on Com munion plate recently published by our townsman Mr. Wilfred J. Cripps, barrister-at-law. It has been suggested that the first named may have been a customary new year's gift from Queen Elizabeth (daughter of the ill-fated Queen) to her physician Dr. Master, who, having become possessed of the Abbey estates, presented it to the church. The silver flagons are also of Elizabeth's reign, and bear date 1576, but Rudder says that they were given by \" Edward Dixon, Esquire\" (1 Dixton) \" in 1434.\" He further goes on to say \" William George, Esquire, and his wife gave the two plates for collecting the offerings, Mr. John Adye gave the gilt strainer for the chalice, and Mrs. Bridget Smith and others (whose names are either forgotten or who chose to conceal them) furnished the remainder of the noble service of plate with which this church is accommodated. The best Bible and Common Prayer Book (now on chancel lectern) were given by Thomas Powell, Esquire, and his wife.\" In the Taxatio Spiritualium of Pope Nicholas (1291) the value of the Parish Church of Cirencester, being then legally independent of the Abbey, is returned amongst the other churches in the \"Deanery of Cirencester \" as worth \u00a328 13s. 4d. per annum, subject to \u00a32 17s. 4d. tithe. Fifty-three years later (see p. 56) it became so thoroughly the property of the Abbey that in the Valor Ecelesiasticus (1535) under the same heading, \" The Deanery of Cirencester,\" its value is not given with those of the other churches, but it is expressly stated that \" The Abbot and Convent of Cirencester are the proprietors of the rectory there, for which they are responsible to the king by virtue of a composition with their aforesaid monastery \" (alluding to the deed of 1344). The gross income of the Parish Church is, however, elsewhere stated as \u00a329 2s. 6d. at that time, inclusive of its dependent chapelries of Baunton, St. Cecilia, &c, but excluding the various chantries and services in the church itself, which, as it will be seen from the following extract, amounted to upwards of \u00a3802 per annum, in addition to the costly plate, vestments, and furniture of which they are stated to have been possessed : \u2014 1 Wilts and Gloucestershire Standard, 1868. 2 Representing twenty times present money value."], [164, "134 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER.

Eudder and Mr. Fuller mention Robert Eycarde's and Alice Avenyng's services. Most of the chantry priests at the dissolution received pensions (see Eudder), and William Phelps (or Phillips), one of the Canons of the Convent, who had officiated as Vicar, retained his office, and thus became first Protestant Minister (see page 82). For his conduct in preaching Transubstantiation and subsequently renouncing the same doctrine from the pulpit (see page 31). The provision made for Phillips' maintenance was certainly inadequate, but was afterwards slightly augmented (see Mr. Fuller). The rectory and advowson were granted 5 Edward VI. (the year following Phillips' recantation) to Sir Thomas Tresham and George Tresham, and a few years later passed into the hands of the Bourchiers, of Barnesley. From the smallness of the living, the want of a vicarage house, and the populousness of the parish, it would appear that considerable difficulty was experienced for many years in retaining the services of a resident minister ; and thus whilst for nearly two centuries the Bathurst family have held the ancient demesne lands and been lay impropriators of most of the parish, the right of presentation has for a still longer period been vested in the bishops of the diocese, who have continued to appoint perpetual curates by license. The value of the living 200 years ago was only about \u00a320 per annum (equivalent to not more than \u00a3100 present money value), but in 1698, in consequence of the bequest of Dr. Clarke for the augmentation of ten poor benefices, combined with the subscriptions of certain residents, this scanty income was increased by upwards of \u00a340 per annum (see"], [166, "136 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. Charities), and about the same time the lease of a vicarage house near the church was obtained, of which in 1708 Mrs. Rebecca Powell gave the fee for ever, and the same lady and others having devised additional sums, the living in 1778 was computed at about \u00a3200 per annum. In 1826 the late Miss Master, in consideration of the privilege of removing the old vicarage, bought the large house in Thomas-street, facing Coxwell-street, which up to the time of the preferment of the Rev. Canon Millar to Christian Malford, in 1881, was used as the Vicarage House, but is now occupied as a private school for young ladies ; the present Vicar, the Ven. Archdeacon Hayward, residing at Gloucester House, in Dyer-street. The total value of the living at the present time, exclusive of the Vicarage House, but inclusive of the income derived from the Church at Watermoor, and the sum of \u00a3120 subscribed as part payment of the Curates' stipends, amounts to upwards of \u00a3500 per annum. Mr. Fuller gives a list of the ministers. Little is, however, known of those who succeeded Phillips until Alexander Gregory, the noteworthy Evangelical Pastor of Cirencester. He warmly espoused the Parliamentary cause, and was taken prisoner to Oxford by Prince Rupert's soldiers, with Mr. Stansfield, another clergyman. At the earnest solicitation of the people of Cirencester he returned to the town a few years later, and continued to minister to his parishioners, and both by public and private instruction \" in a plain and familiar way \" \" to promote the good of souls.\" In 1662, in spite of threats and promises, Mr. Gregory refused to barter his conscience, and was compelled by the iniquitous \"Act of Uniformity\" to relinquish his living, and by the \" Five Mile Act \" to leave the town. He subsequently settled at Minchinhampton, where he died in 1666, on the very day certain of his old parishioners had arranged to pay him their first visit. His daughter married the Evangelical Rector of Siddington, afterwards Bishop Bull. Mr. Carles succeeded as Perpetual Curate of Cirencester ; this he held with the Rectory of fiarnesley, and dying in 1675, Jeremiah, the son of Alexander Gregory, was appointed. Upon his resignation in 1690, Joseph Harrison held the living for the lengthened period of 63 years ; and after his death, in 1753, Samuel Johnson became Incumbent. He is stated to have been a thoroughly Evangelical preacher, but got out of favour with his parishioners (see Mr. Fuller's account), and consequently recourse was had to somewhat illicit means to force his resignation (1778). His ministry extended over 24 years, and he died in 1784, as one of the Vicars of Bampton. From 1778 to 1785 the living was held by the Rev. Martin Stafforde Smyth, who was succeeded by William Shippen Willes, at whose death, in 1807, Henry Anthony Pye became Vicar. He was also a Prebendary of Worcester. His death occurred in 1839. William Frederick Powell, M.A., previously Curate of"], [167, "137 THE CHURCH OF THE HOLY TRINITY. Great Malvern and Perpetual Curate of Stroud, was the next Incumbent. In 1855 he was appointed Hon. Canon of Gloucester, and a few years since a Prebendary of Hereford. Canon Powell resigned his charge at Cirencester in 1869, and retired to his estate near Hereford, where he still resides. By Act of Parliament (1868) Perpetual Curates are designated Vicars, and James Ogilvy Millar, LL.D., previously Vicar of Tamworth, and some years previously Curate to Canon Powell, at Cirencester, was appointed Vicar in August, 1869. In the following year he succeeded Mr. Forster, Rector of Coin Rogers, as Rural Dean of Cirencester, and in 1880 was made Honorary Canon of Bristol. In 1881 he was presented to the living of Christian Malford, Wilts, and in December of that year the Rev. Henry Rudge Hayward, M.A., Fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford, Rector of Lydiard Millicent, and a Proctor in Convocation for the Diocese, was instituted as Vicar. In 1882, upon the representations of Bishop Ellicott, the Archdeaconry of Cirencester was formed and endowed, and by consent of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners constituted to include the Rural Deaneries of Cirencester, Fairford, Northleach, Stow, and Chipping Campden, Mr. Hayward being appointed as the first Archdeacon, at the desire of his parishioners and others interested. Up to this time the united Diocese of Gloucester and Bristol had consisted of the two Archdeaconries of Gloucester and Bristol only. By the Act lately passed for the reconstruction of the See of Bristol, the Archdeaconry of Cirencester is not affected, but the future Diocese of Gloucester will consist of the two Archdeaconries of Gloucester and Cirencester. THE CHURCH OF THE HOLY\" TRINITY, Watermoor Road. This Church was erected as a Chapel-of-Ease, to meet the requirements of the growing district in which it is situated. The foundation stone was laid in 1847, and the Church consecrated and opened for public worship by Dr. Ollivant, the Bishop of Llandaff, November 6th, 1851. The Vicar of the Parish Church is the Incumbent, and the Rev. W. P. Acworth, who has officiated for upwards of fifteen years, Curate in charge. The building was designed by and carried out under the superintendence of the late Sir G. Gilbert Scott, and executed by the late Mr. Bridges, builder, of this town, the style of archi tecture being Early English of the later or transitional period. It was enlarged about twenty years since by extending the south aisle to the line of the western facade, and now consists of a nave and chancel, with side aisles to each, and a tower at the north western angle, surmounted by an elegant spire, which was added in 1852, at the sole expense of the Hon. William Lennox (afterward fifth Earl) Bathurst. There is also a small porch on"], [168, "138 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. the north side, and a vestry for the ministers and choristers. The internal length is 89 feet ; width across nave and aisles 59 feet; extreme length, including buttresses, 104 feet; and the combined height of tower and spire 125 feet. The number of sittings 550. The original cost was about \u00a35,000, but with the subsequent enlargement, the reredos, organ, and stained glass windows added during the last few years, the total outlay must have been considerably in excess of this amount. It would be unreasonable, however, with the money expended to look for a very ornate building, but in the excellent proportions and general outline, as well as in the selection of materials1 and substantial character of the workmanship, it will be conceded that it is a work of considerable merit. The exterior would be very plain without the handsome spire, but the interior is far more attractive, for whilst there is perhaps nothing that can with propriety be called elaborate, the ornament is thoroughly good and well placed, and every detail bears the impress of careful study and matured taste. The nave arcades, the pulpit, the chancel arch and its side lights and entrances, and the splendid three-light lancet window, with its polished Derbyshire marble columns and moulded freestone caps and bases, are all thoroughly satisfactory, whilst the exquisite little font placed in the space under the tower cannot fail to arrest the attention of every visitor on entering the church. The font consists of a quatrefoiled-shaped basin, supported by a central pillar enclosed between four slender detached columns, the shafts of which are also of polished Derbyshire marble. In the centre of the four faces are carved medallions, containing the symbols of the four Evangelists. The stone is from Caen, in Normandy. The reredos, defrayed by the collections of ladies of the congregation, was unveiled on Trinity Sunday, 1881. It is of sculptured freestone. The subject in the centre compartment is the risen and glorified Saviour, and in the side panels are represented the Resurrection and the visit of the women to the empty tomb guarded by the angels. The east window contains three lancet lights, the central one being a \"Jesse Window,\" the figures representing the family of Jesse as the ancestry of our Saviour,2 and the figures in the side compartments are apostles and holy women. The south light of the chancel was provided by subscription, and depicts Moses receiving the tables of stone on Mount Sinai in one compartment, and in the other the descent 1 The rock faced masonry is the local stone known to geologists as Forest marble ; the quoins, dressings, and ashlar work are of Bath freestone. 2 The stone mullions and tracery of the east window at Dorchester, Oxon, are disposed so as to illustrate the same prophetic idea as contained in Isaiah xi. 1., \" There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots.\" The subject is a favourite one in stained glass."], [169, "139 THE BAPTIST CHAPEL. of the Holy Spirit. Underneath is the text, \" The law was given by Moses,\" \" Grace and truth by Jesus Christ.\" The opposite window was the gift of the children. The Rose window in the north chancel aisle is of stained glass. The east window of the south aisle is a memorial to the late Major Milligan, who died in 1868. The chancel side lights of the same aisle and the tracery of its west window are also of coloured glass. The west window of the nave was presented by the Misses Young, of Watermoor, in memory of relatives, in 1878, the subjects represented referring to the birth of our Lord. Annexed are the texts, \" The Kings of Tarshish and of the Isles shall bring presents ; \" \" The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.\" The west window of the south aisle, afterwards presented by the same ladies, portrays \" Christ healing the sick.\" The three windows in the baptistery, or space beneath the tower, were given by Professor Buckman, formerly of the Agricultural College, in memory of his children. The large enclosed piece of ground in which the church stands was the gift of the fourth Earl Bathurst, as likewise the field adjacent, the rental of which forms part of the minister's stipend. There is a parsonage house at the farther end of the field from the church. No interments are allowed to take place on the church land, nor is it desirable, considering that the water level is soon reached, that they should. The church is lighted with gas and heated with hot air. Mr. Ralph Norris is the organist, and the choir is surpliced. Lightning conductors have recently been fixed to the spire of this, and to the tower of the parish church, at the expense of Earl Bathurst. THE BAPTIST CHAPEL, Coxwell Street. In the early history of Nonconformity in this town and neighbourhood, the rise of Baptist principles, and the first establishment of a Baptist Church, occupies a leading place. It would be exceeding the purpose of this work to attempt more than a brief sketch of the principal circumstances in connection with this deeply interesting subject. It has been asserted that Wickliffe and the English protomartyr, Sautre, held Baptist views \u2014 certainly many of the followers of Wickliffe did. During the first century or so after the Reformation, the \" Anabaptists \" (as they had been nicknamed) were amongst the most advanced reformers, and were persecuted by reformers less pronounced than themselves; they have been accused of fanatical and extreme views, perhaps not without reason, but these were too often the outcome of a counter fanaticism and of the harsh measures directed against them. In many respects the Anabaptists were in advance of their time, for it must be stated to their credit that in concert with the other section of the \"Independents,\" and in spite of the rigorous persecution they experienced, they alone s"], [170, "140 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. admitted the right of private judgment in matters of faith, and yet they were misunderstood even by those, who, like themselves, were sincere in their endeavours to promote the spiritual welfare of their fellow creatures. The following facts will illustrate this : About the time that Alexander Gregory became Protestant Vicar of Cirencester, the English Baptists began to dissociate themselves from the established and other churches, in whose worship they had been accustomed to join, and about ten years later, corres ponding to the time when Mr. Gregory was taken prisoner in the siege of Cirencester, \"they published a formal confession of their faith.\" Charles I. permitted the inhabitants left in the town to pursue their usual avocations during the period of its occupation by Prince Maurice and Sir Jacob Ashley, but whether the Royalists appointed any minister of Cirencester during their stay beyond the ordinary chaplain of the forces we are not informed, probably not, and the Cavaliers were too much occupied with other matters to act the part of inquisitors, so at this time the Baptists in Cirencester were left to themselves. On the return of Mr. Gregory, after four years absence, at the earnest solicitation of Cirencester friends, it is evident that the Baptist \" confession of faith \" had been accepted by a considerable number of Ciren cester people of influence, and this seems to have given Mr. Gregory much anxiety, for it appears that this estimable man had not learnt to tolerate efforts for good except upon his own lines. A puritan clergyman of the neighbourhood, the vicar of Kemble, preached a sermon in 1647 (soon after Mr. Gregory's return), in the Parish Church, severely assailing them ; this called forth a remonstrance, and the clergyman undertook, if the aggrieved would set down fully their objections to his statements, to clear up \"all their doubts.\" The Baptists retained Mr. Harrison, minister of Charlton, near Cheltenham, to declare their principles, and he published an elaborate document, in January, 1648-9, in which their objections to the doctrines of the Kemble vicar were set forth. To this the latter replied in a work of about 100 pages entitled the \" The Gainsayer Convinced,\" in a manner which would hardly commend itself in this latter part of the 19th century.1 Whatever may have been the immediate effect of this publication we are not informed, but it did not extinguish the Baptists, for in 165 12 they were an organised body of about forty members, under the pastoral care of Mr. Giles Watkins, a highly respectable tradesman of the town, who had then two brothers in Antigua, one being the governor of the island and the other a judge. The church at Cirencester had likewise several branches in the adjacent villages. It is uncertain when Mr. Watkins died, but he remained pastor many years, and was 1 See Wilts and Gloucestershire Standard, Deecmber 10, 1881. a The following particulars have been extracted from the Baptist Church Book, by consent of the pastor and members of the church."], [171, "THE BAPTIST CHAPEL. 141 succeeded by Mr. Freeman. During his pastorate a separation under Mr. Richard Dowel took place upon certain points of doctrine, and the church of the secessionists was in existence in 1776, although very few in numbers. Mr. Freeman died in 1737, and was followed by Mr. Robert Major, until his death in 1745, and then by Mr. Thomas Flower (though not formally invested with the pastoral office) for fourteen years, until his removal to London in 1761. For the next fourteen years the church was without a pastor, and it seemed to be on the decline, but in August, 1775, Mr. Dore came to Cirencester, and he remained pastor for fifteen years. During his ministry the cause improved, and the chapel was enlarged ; and in the British Museum is a circular letter from the elders and messengers of certain Baptist churches of the counties of Gloucester, Worcester, and Warwick, met in \" Association at Cirencester,\" May, 1779, under the moderatorship of Mr. Dore, addressed to the churches they severally represent. The letter commences in the following manner : \" Dear brethren, \u2014 Like the chosen tribes of old we have gone from strength to strength, and have been permitted to appear before God in Sion.\" It then proceeds to refer to events of recent occurrence, exhorts to prayer and work, and the necessity of letting \" their light shine before men,\" sets forth their religious tenets, declares the uselessness of mere religious pomp and pageantry, and gratefully acknowledges the blessing of liberty of conscience enjoyed since the Act of Toleration of William III. The following passage from this lengthy document is worthy of reproduction : \"The grand and fundamental principles of Protestantism are stated to be the right of private judgment, liberty of conscience, the sufficiency of scripture, and an acknow ledgment of the supreme authority of the Lord Jesus Christ, as the Head of the Church and sole Legislator in it. We are to call no man master upon earth in religious matters, one being our Master, even Christ.\" Mr. Dore was succeeded by the Rev. William Wilkins, and Mr. Wilkins in 1804 by the Rev. Daniel White, who held the pastorate for the extended period of 49 years, dying in 1853, highly respected and deeply lamented. There is a marble mural monument to him in the chapel. The Rev. J. M. Stephens, who was associated with him as co-pastor from 1847, was the next minister, and retained the appointment for several years. The Rev. J. J. Brown, the present pastor, commenced his ministry September 21st, 1863, and has been for several years a member of the School and Burial Boards of the town. The old chapel, which had stood for about 200 years, was taken down and the present one erected in 1856-57, at a cost of \u00a32,000. It is in the Italian style, but of no architectural pretensions. The interior is commodious and properly warmed and lighted, and capable of holding about 400. At the rear are a vestry and school rooms. In consequence of the increased size"], [172, "142 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. of the new chapel, a portion of the old burying ground had to be taken in. The chapel is endowed with legacies amounting to about \u00a3550 (see particulars of the Charities). In the graveyard is a head stone with the following curious inscription in memory of Mrs. Welsh, penned by her husband : \u2014 She was Words are wanting to say what, Say what a good wife should be, And she was, that. THE BAPTIST CHAPEL, in Park Street, Was opened for worship in 1854, and remained under the pastoral care of Mr. Tanner until his death in 1867. The congregation had separated from the old Baptist church some years before upon differences in certain points of doctrine. Since Mr. Tanner's death, Mr. Barnard has officiated as pastor. Including a gallery, the chapel contains about 200 sittings. THE INDEPENDENT or CONGREGATIONAL CHAPEL, in Sheep Street, Was erected in 1839, and is capable of seating about 400. It is a large and commodious building, faced with dressed stone. The Congregational church was established in Cirencester about five years before, and owed much of its early success to the Rev. J. Burder, M.A., of Stroud. In 1840, the Rev. E. Bewlay accepted the pastorate. Mr. Stratford, author of \" Good and Great Men of Gloucestershire \" and \" Wiltshire and its Worthies,\" succeeded him, and was minister for many years, until induced to resign from non-acquiescence in Congregational principles. Since Mr. Stratford, the church has had the benefit of the successive ministries of the Revs. H. Ashbery, D. Evans, and S. Martin Brough, the present pastor, and is in a flourishing state. The schoolroom is under the chapel. THE WESLEYAN METHODIST CHAPEL, in Gloucester Street, Has sittings for about 300 people. It was erected in 1808, and was much improved about twenty years since by the addition of a porch and vestibule. The schoolroom was erected in 1855, for about 90 children, and the school accommodation is now consi derably increased by the erection of another schoolroom at the side of the existing one. There seem to be no records in existence of the origin and establishment of Methodism in Cirencester, but it appears from the Journal of the founder of Methodism that he"], [173, "THE FRIENDS' MEETING HOUSE. 143 \" rode to Cirencester, and preached on a green place at a little distance from the town, May 24, 1743, on the text, 'The Kingdom of God is not meat and drink ; but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.'\" He \"rode\" again to Cirencester, August 13th, 1745, and preached in the evening, and on the three following days rode to Oxford, Wycombe, and London. In 1750 he \"preached at Cirencester, in the evening, to a large but not serious congregation ; \" and on the following day \"left this uncomfortable place,\" and proceeded to Bristol. On March 20, 1787, at the age of 84, he writes, \" I walked from Stroud through one of the loveliest vallies I ever saw, running with a clear stream in the midst of it between two fruitful mountains, sprinkled all over with little white houses,\" and at one o'clock, not being able to procure a larger place, preached in \" our own room to as many as could hear either in or near it. And the labour was not lost ; they all drank in the Word as the thirsty earth the showers.\" The room referred to was at the Weavers' Hall, in Thomas Street. THE PRIMITIVE METHODIST CHAPEL, in Lewis Lane, Is an unpretending brick edifice, built in 1851, capable of seating about 200 persons. There is a resident minister, Sunday school, and a fair regular attendance. Camp meetings are occasionally held in the neighbourhood. THE PRESBYTERIAN CHAPEL, Approached by an arch from Gosditch Street, is the oldest in the town, having been erected in 1648, during Mr. Gregory's second term of ministry as Vicar of Cirencester. Subsequently to his ejection from his living by the Act of Uniformity in 1662, Mr. Gregory is said to have ministered in it until forced to leave the town by the Five Mile Act. Like most of the successors of 17th century English Presbyterianism, the Presbyterians of Cirencester gradually merged into Unitarianism, and for a great number of years the teaching has been Unitarian. The Rev. H. Austin succeeded to the pastorate in 1866. The houses immediately adjacent are the property of the chapel. The graveyard has long been disused. A list of the inscriptions is given in the little History of Cirencester published by the late Mr. Savory. THE FRIENDS' MEETING HOUSE Stands in Thomas Street, set back from the line of street. Part of it was originally a dwelling house, and was in 1673"], [174, "144 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. converted into a place of worship. It was much enlarged in 1810, has undergone further improvements within the last few years, and is now capable of holding 600 or 700 persons. There is a dwelling house attached on the north side for the caretaker, and beyond a larger building, until six or seven years since used as an infant school. There is a graveyard at the rear, very neatly kept, but noteworthy (in accordance with the custom and principles of the society) for the entire absence of gravestones. Quakerism had its rise in Cirencester with the visit of two female Friends to John Roberts, the persecuted Quaker of Siddington, in 1655, and with that of George Fox to Cirencester about the same time.1 The Friends of Cirencester are not now a numerous body, but they have included such men as the late Mr. Samuel Bowly and several others whose names will for many years continue to be cherished and esteemed. It may interest to state that Mr. Johu Bright, M.P., has attended the chapel on a few occasions when visiting his brother-in-law, Mr. Leatham, M.P., at Miserden Park. THE PLYMOUTH BRETHREN Have had a cause in Cirencester for about eighteen years, which was commenced in the Temperance Hall, by Mr. Stratford and a few friends. The members now meet in what was formerly the market room of the Ram Hotel. THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHAPEL Is a neat little Gothic edifice in the London Road. Mass is held every Sunday, usually by the Rev.

LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THE ROMAN AND MEDI\u00c6VAL MUNICIPALITIES. THE LIBERTY OF THE SEVEN HUNDREDS. THE COURT ROLLS OF THE BOROUGH AND HUNDREDS. Our existing municipalities have in most instances originated with royal charters, still preserved amongst the national archives, but it will be generally conceded that they have their counterpart in the municipal institutions of cLassic times, the relics of which, in certain continental cities, survived the downfall of the Roman empire. In this chapter, Cirencester (or rather its predecessor, Corinium) is considered : \u2014 (1) As one of the thirty capital cities of Britain, endowed with privileges from imperial Rome, and visited period ically (like the assize towns of the present day) by the pr\u00e6tor, for the settlement of civil and criminal cases in its district ; a state of things which was continued until the departure of the Roman legions, when these districts, of which Cirencester and the remaining chief cities were the capitals, became semi-indepen dent states. (2) In its relation to the political divisions of the Saxon regime, and as invested subsequently with the privileges of a free borough ; these privileges being nullified and eventually lost in consequence of the injustice of the Abbots. (3) Under the Town Commissioners and Local Board. Commencing then with the Roman period, it is well known that the citizens of ancient Rome possessed rights which were highly prized in an age when despotic rule was everywhere in the ascendant, and that these rights were conferred on the cities of the provinces of the empire according to the attitude assumed by them towards her, those being favourably dealt with which had readily submitted, whilst those which had persisted in a long and obstinate resistance, or which had afterwards revolted, were"], [176, "146 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. subjected to the rule of a prefect from Rome, being liable to be taxed at his will or at that of the senate ; these less fortunate cities were hence known as \" Prefectur\u00e6\" or \" Stipendiari\u00e6;\" and Richard of Cirencester informs us that upon the full establishment of Roman rule in Britain there were, besides towns of lesser importance, thirty-three chief cities \u2014 twelve being Stipendiari\u00e6 ; two Municipia, viz., Eboracum (York) and Verulamium (St. Albans) ; ten cities possessed of the rights conferred by the \" Jus Latii,\" Corinium (Cirencester) being one of them ; and nine Coloni\u00e6, including Gloucester, London, and Chester amongst others ; and Mr, Sharon Turner1 considers that these places, which had probably during the Roman occupation been the capitals of the adjacent districts, and as such had been visited by the propri\u00e6tor annually, if not oftener, for holding the district assizes, or for the settlement of other public business, became the capitals, as in Gaul, of semi-independent states, under the name of \" Civitates,\" for Honorius addresses himself to the \"Civitates \" of Britain. (See also p. 12, Defeat of British Kings.) Some have doubted the genuineness of the work attributed to Richard of Cirencester, but it is in general accordance with the meagre and less explicit accounts of other authors. Gildas, writing as early as the sixth century, says in reference to the England of his time, \" It contains twenty-eight cities (civitates) of resplendent beauty, and is adorned with some castles, all of them not improbably well appointed fortifications, being possessed of walls, towers, battlemented gates, and dwellings of which the decorated tops (or ridges) stretching with imposing altitude are bound together in a bond of manifest strength.\" The Venerable Bede, soon after the year 700, writes in a similar manner, \" And it was formerly distinguished for twenty-eight most noble cities (civitates) besides numerous castles (or fortifications), both of which were furnished with walls, towers, gates, and bolts of the greatest strength.\" Nennius, a doubtful writer of the ninth century, attempts an enumeration of these twenty-eight cities, and three subsequent writers, viz., Henry of Huntingdon, who died in 1123, Alfred of Beverley, born only thirteen years later, and Ralph Higden, the Chester monk of the 14th century, have done the same. The three last mentioned all name Cirencester and Gloucester, and explain the cities to which the British towns corresponded : thus Huntingdon writes \" Kair-Ceri, id est Cireceastria;\" Alfred of Beverley, \" Kair-Ceri, id est Cirecestria ; \" and Higden mentions Cirencester and Chichester both as \"Caercri.\" Huntingdon further, in relating the victory of Ceaulin in 577, and the slaughter of the three British kings, writes of their \" civitates,\" Cirencester, Gloucester, and Bath, as \" tres urbes excellentissimas,\" and Asser (see note p. 15) mentions Caer-Ceri as the British name for Cirencester, whilst on page 4 1 History of Anglo Saxons, &c."], [177, "147 THE ROMAN MUNICIPIUM. in this work are references to the Roman writers who mention it under its classic name of Corinium. The lists of Huntingdon and Alfred of Beverley are almost identical, but only about twenty of the places mentioned by them occur in Nennius ; the remaining eight differ in each, and in Nennius are not easy to determine. If Cirencester is included in his list, it must be as Caer-Costeint \u2014 signifying Const.intine's town \u2014 a name by which it may have been known in early Saxon times, in consequence of the king who there received the homage and gratitude of the British people (see page 10). The editor of the \" Pictorial History,\" however, considers that Constanton, near Falmouth, is intended. If we admit that Corinium was the capital of one of the lesser divisions of Britain during and immediately after the residence of the Romans in the island, we have now more particularly to con sider it as a free town, endowed with municipal privileges. Richard, in naming two towns only as pre-eminently \" municipia,\" evidently means that they alone enjoyed the privilege of the \"Jus civitatis,\" or the full rights of Roman citizens, except such as could only be had by actual residence in Rome ; but Corinium and the cities possessed of the \"Jus Latii\" were also \"municipia,\" as distinguished from the coloni\u00e6 and stipendiari\u00e6 ; and this seems brought out in the address attributed to Galgacus, the Caledonian chief, when urging his followers to resist the Roman advance in the Scotch Highlands. For although only the words affirmed to have been uttered in a passionate harangue of an ex cited leader, yet as penned by Tacitus (\" de Vita Agricol\u00e6 \") \u2014 a writer who above all others could not have been ignorant of the state of Britain at that time \u2014 they may well be accepted as authoritative that there were then several \" municipi\u00e6\" as well as \" coloni\u00e6.\" Galgacus therefore thus winds up his address : \" Nor is there any other cause for terror. The castles (or fortresses) are empty ; the \" coloni\u00e6 \" filled with old men, divided between rendering a constrained obedience and wielding an unjust power; the \"muni cipia \" are sickly and at discord. Here is a leader ! here is an army 1 there are tributes and coins and other penalties of servitude,\" etc., etc. The privilege of the \"Jus Latii,\" however, was not equal to that of the \" Jus civitatis,\" although superior to the \"Jus Italicum\" or any other right; but each of these three classes of municipia, of which there were at first none out of Italy, were able, if they chose, to retain their own laws and customs, entitled \" Leges Municipales,\" but could accept or refuse those of Rome.1 The \" Jus Latii \" permitted those who enjoyed it to serve as allies in the Roman army, either as cavalry or as foot soldiers; and in the later days of the empire the distinction between Roman and Latin privileges grew less, although retained in name. 1 See Adams on \" Roman Antiquities,\" and other writers. T"], [178, "148 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. The establishment of Gloucester as a military colony was probably due to Aulus Plautius, to prevent the inroads of the Silures, who for thirty years successfully resisted the conquerors. The coloni\u00e6 differed from the municipia or the free towns in this \u2014 that they \" used the laws prescribed them by the Romans, but they had almost the same kind of magistrates. Their two chief magistrates were called Duumviri, and their senators Decuriones, because, as some say, when the colony was first planted every tenth man was made a senator.\"1 Fosbroke says that Cirencester was governed by these, but the \" free towns also had their \u00e6diles, who were sometimes their only magistrates.\"1 The office of the \u00e6diles at Rome was to take care of the city, its roads, public buildings, sewers, baths, &c, to inspect private buildings to prevent them becoming ruinous and unsightly, and dangerous to the occupants and outside public ; they had control over the markets, public games, examined weights and measures, limited the expenses of funerals, and fined or banished women of bad character, after being condemned by the senate or people. These magistrates, with the questors for the collection of taxes, and some other public officers, were elected in Rome at the Comitia Tributa, by the votes of the people assembled, according to tribes, and it is probable that the popular vote was likewise taken in selecting them at Corinium and the other free towns of the provinces of the Roman empire. The chief officers appointed for the government of Britain and other parts, by virtue of the imperial edict, were changed more than once during the four centuries of their residence in this country, but little change was made in the local administration of the cities except that which was done by the will of the citizens themselves. The history of the two centuries of warfare following the arrival of Hengist and Horsa, with the almost entire absence of literature attending it, the unearthing of the foundations and walls of buildings several feet beneath the present ground surface, generally bearing the marks of fire, the coins and ornaments evidently hastily buried for the purpose of concealment with the hope of future recovery, as well as the testimony of writers of the immediately subsequent age, all prove how thorough must have been the desolation of many places, and that the fabled account of the \" City of sparrows \" and its destruction is not without foundation, although clouded with Medi\u00e6val credulity and invention. When the Saxons were secured in their newly-acquired terri tory, they commenced to rebuild in their own humble way the deserted cities of their predecessors, and then were led to turn their attention to the arts of peace, spreading themselves over the entire country, so that it is estimated that, although the population of England in the time of Edward the Confessor was little more 1 See Adams on ' ' Roman Antiquities, \" and other writers."], [179, "THE MEDI\u00c6VAL MUNICIPAL BOROUGH. 149 than one-tenth of what it is now, yet that the number of parishes and separate places was nearly as many. In this respect they differed materially from their predecessors, who appear to have occupied it by their legions simply as a conquered province. By the Saxons the country was divided into shires, or counties, hun dreds, and tythings, each having its court for the dispensation of justice (according to the ideas of that primitive age), the court of the tything being subordinate to that of the hundred, as the latter was to that of the shire. The tythings are, in most cases, identical with parishes, manors, or lordships, and are supposed at the period of their formation to have contained at least ten families, and the hundreds several, though no fixed number of tythings, but at least one hundred families \u2014 but there is difference of opinion as to the origin of these terms ; \u2014 the shires included several (in Gloucester shire about thirty) hundreds. The Hundred of Cirencester is mentioned in the Domesday Book, and probably at first formed a single hundred in conjunc tion with the adjacent villages. The institution of borough towns, or free burghs, being a thing of gradual development, royal immu nities being granted as they rose in importance, and thus \" Cyren ceastre \" (as appears by the charter of Ethelred to the Abingdon monks) was constituted a \" royal town,\" after which the hundred mote would probably continue to be held as before, with a special mote, or court, for the borough or town hundred.1 The town has been further set forth in the foregoing pages as a place frequented by the Saxon kings, as the scene of Guthrum's residence and instruction, of three important gemotes or states councils, and, lastly, as possessed of a wealthy collegiate church, and a market and trade, in which Reimbald, the Conqueror's favourite, and his canons were personally interested, and yet Fosbroke asserts that it was at this time a decaying place, in consequence of the ravages of the Danes. For the latter statement there is no historical foundation, and the former rests upon the mention in the Domes day of only 652 persons (who may be considered as heads of families) in addition to the college of secular canons. These 65 families, at five to a house, with the inmates of the collegiate church, would give a total population of about 350 only, and are thus classified \u2014 4 freemen, 32 villeins, 14 bordars, 15 1 Mr. Stubbs' Constitutional History of England has shown that as some towns like Cirencester contained several parish churches, so they were created hundreds independent of the surrounding rural hundreds, whilst at the same time the Court of this rural hundred continued to be held in the town and was called by its name, just as the district urban and rural sanitary districts are now called by the same name. This appears to have been so with Cirencester, although at a much later period the rural hundred came to be called Crowthorne, after the place in Stratton parish, where the view of Frankpledge was held (see Atkyns). Norwich and some other place are mentioned particularly as district hundreds. a Fosbroke says by error 55."], [180, "150 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. serfs. But Mr. Fosbroke errs in taking the Domesday Book as a census of the population, instead of as a record of the demesnes and profits belonging to the crown and of the public \" services due by the several estates in the kingdom.\"1 Thus considered, it is clear why Cirencester and many other boroughs are not mentioned as possessing charters of incorporation, and why the full complement of their inhabitants is not given, as the object of the survey was obtained by an enumeration of the lands, the persons attached to them, and the gross levy upon the towns, without of necessity further reference to those upon whom it was levied. As stated below, there can be no question that the above was only a small portion of the population of Ciren cester, for the outlying portions of the parish, Oakley, Barton, and Wiggold tythings, were not included, and the two former, which appear to be represented by \" Achelie,\" contained no less than 32 families, or one-half as many as Cirencester. Gloucester and Winchcombe \u2014 although the former is excep tionally referred to as a city \u2014 likewise illustrate in a striking manner the incompleteness of the Domesday as a guide to population, for whereas only 72 and 18 burgesses are mentioned in those places respectively, it is nevertheless clear from the Cottonian Registers of Evesham Abbey that Gloucester had at least 613 and Winchcombe 116 burgesses in the time of Edward the Confessor. Mr. Ellis, in his \" Introduction to the Study of the Domesday Book,\" refers to this matter, and supposes that these Registers contain information supplied to the Commissioners for the Domesday Book compilation. This was probably so, and hence in some cases they give additional information at their discretion : thus, York is certified to have contained 967 occupied houses, but no less than 1607 before the Conquest ; and in like manner Lincoln had 910 and 1150 in the time of King Edward. Norwich had 1320 burgesses, but in William's time only 665 and 480 bordarii, who from poverty paid no custom. Dorchester and Derby were then possessed of 188 and 243 houses, of which 100 and 103 were respectively destroyed by William. Oxford is stated in the Domesday to have had 721 standing, but of these 478 were in a state of decay, many probably deserted by their former occupants. But neither London nor Winchester are mentioned at all, whilst only 1 0 persons are recorded in Bristol, 42 in Dover, 46 in St. Albans, and 9 each in Stamford and Bedford, and yet each of these were then considered important towns.

In Cirencester Hundred (probably to be understood as the Borough or Town Hundred)1 King Edward had five hides of land. There are in demean five carucates and thirty-one villeins, with ten carucates. There are thirteen serfs and ten bordars, and three mills2 of 30 shillings (income), and some meadow, and two woods of fifty shillings, and there are two free men possessed of two carucates. The Queen has been accustomed to have all the wool. In the time of King Edward this Manor paid three bushels and a half of wheat, and three bushels of barley, and six sextaries and a half of honey, and nine pounds and five shillings and three thousand loaves for the dogs. It now pays twenty pounds five shillings, and twenty cows, twenty pigs, and sixteen shillings, instead of the loaves, and twenty shillings from the new market, of which St. Mary (i.e. the Collegiate Church) has the third penny. In Cirencester a free man held two hides of land, and paid twenty shillings in ferm, and did service to the sheriff throughout all England. Earl William took this land out of ferm, and gave it to one of his men. The Land of William, the Son of Baderon. In Cirencester Hundred William, the son of Baderon, holds two hides in Cirencester, and Hugh holds them of him.

There are two serfs. It was worth a hundred shillings, now seventy shillings. Aluni held this land. The possessions of the Collegiate Church are given page on 50, and extract from Domesday about Achelie in the account of Oakley tything. It will be seen that in all cases property had decreased in value and towns in population after the Conquest, whilst taxation was increased. The fimount of levy upon Cirencester, compared with those towns in which the number of houses is given, may warrant an estimate that it contained in the time of Edward the Confessor 250 or 300 houses, or scarcely 1,500 people ; Gloucester at that time having about 3,000 people, and York, Norwich, and Lincoln, the largest towns in the kingdom excepting London, Bristol, and probably Southampton, about 8,000, 6,500, and 6,000 respectively. By the close of the twelfth century these towns could scarcely have more than recovered the depopulating measures of William. Cirencester was then fermed at \u00a330, Shrewsbury and Wallingford less, and Scarboro and Huntingdon rather more ; Cambridge, Derby, Bedford, and Hereford, \u00a340 each ; Gloucester, \u00a360 ; Lin coln, \u00a3180; and Bristol, \u00a3145 (raised to \u00a3245). x Referring to the corporate rights of the townsmen, the Charter of Henry I. to the Abbey mentions \" the burgesses of Cirencester,\" and seems to indicate that, like Malmesbury, Colchester, and other places,2 they were a corporate body, possessed of \" leasowes\" or common land. The same deed refers to the market being held in the several streets. And the later charter of Richard I. (1189) expressly states that the manorial privileges of the abbot were to be enjoyed \" infra burgum et extra burgum,\" so that it may be inferred that 1 In 1189. \u2014 1 Richard I. \u2014The lands which were in the king's hands were tallaged.

III.\u2014 Sept. 18, 1228.\u2014 The bailiffs of Gloucester, Cheltenham, Dymock, Winchcomb, Awre, and \" Cirencester town and Hundred\" were commanded to send the ferm of their towns and hundred to the king at Montgomery. \u2014 Report 27, Public Records."], [183, "THE MEDI\u00c6VAL MUNICIPAL BOROUGH. 153 at that time the borough had certain defined limits within the parish, and that it possessed rights which were not to interfere with the manorial privileges, previously enjoyed by the king, and then granted the abbots. In other words, the townsmen's corporate rights were to remain just the same with the Abbot as manorial lord as when the King held the manor for his own use, but they had to pay certain dues to the Abbot which they had been accustomed to pay to the King.1 From this time the ferm of Cirencester ceased to be responded to by the townsmen, the abbot's annual payment of \u00a330 apparently covering all further regal claims from the townsmen except from pleas of the crown. In 7 Richard I. (six years after the charter), however, the inhabitants are certified to have paid \u00a310 tallage2 to the king, and in 40 Henry III. (1255-56), the abbot, who was evidently then accustomed to collect tallage from the burghers, was summoned into the Exchequer to show by what right he had distrained on the tenants of Richard de la Pyrie (who then held certain land \" in capite \" of the king by knight's service within the town of Cirencester), to compel payment of tallage to himself. The sheriff of Gloucester was ordered to distrain on the Abbot.3 And in 1314 (8 E. II.) Nicholas de Stratton petitioned for judgment to be delivered in a long pending suit in the Exchequer, Rex. v. Abbot, for the recovery of tallage for the king's works, \" de Burgo de Cirencestre ut de ceteris Burgis Regis (i.e. from the borough of Cirencester as from other boroughs of the king), which said tallage the abbot claimed that he was justified in collecting and retaining for his own use, by virtue of the royal charter (of Richard I.). An order was given to the barons of the Exchequer to proceed to judgment without delay, but the result is not stated.4 In the same year (8 E. II.) occurs an instance of the difficulty experienced by ordinary persons in obtaining redress : for the relatives and executors of a cert.ain Thomas de Tilloy prayed that a writ might be issued against the king's bailiffs of Exeter, South ampton, and Cirencester, for seizing at Bristol goods consigned from a French port to the said Thomas during the war with France, apparently at least seventeen years before. The writ was granted.5 Another document of interest, throwing light upon the relations of the townsmen to their manorial lord about 1 In 12 Hen.

To this work we must refer the reader for a full account of the pleas advanced by the parties to the suit. But the case may be thus summarised \u2014 The bailiffs of Abbot Henry de Hamptonel having distrained on Thomas de Matyshale, who held tenements in the town of Cirencester, and seized therefrom his beasts, Thomas sued the Abbot in the court of the County of Gloucester, and the county bailiff came with the intention of liberating the cattle, but \" could not, because Cirencester is of the king's ancient demesne, and not guildable to the county court, wherefore the county court awarded a distress on the Abbot ; \" and afterwards Thomas sought delivery by a writ of replevin, by virtue of which the sheriff entered the \" franchise \" (or liberty), liberated the beasts, and \" attached \" the Abbot. The latter then caused the proceedings to be removed into the king's courts, and claimed that he had perfect right to seize the animals for neglect of customary services, as Cirencester was formerly ancient demesne, \" where no writ runs,\" of which he was now the proprietor by royal charter. Thomas de Matyshale admitted that Cirencester was of the king's demesne, but declared that he paid 28d. a year in lieu of all ser vices. But not being able to substantiate his statement by the production of his deed of enfranchisement, it was adjudged that Thomas de Matyshale was to be amerced. The Abbot prayed the return (1 of the animals), but the judge replied, \" You shall not have it from us, but when you get to the inn, do to your arch villein what you please.\" Fosbroke, quoting from the Registers of Malmesbury Abbey,1 writes that in early times Cirencester was governed by provosts. This appears to be correct, for in 1308 the townspeople preferred charges against the abbot that \" he had abated the court of provostry, and made the burgesses do suit in his own court.\"2 In 1343 (the year preceding the grant to the abbot of the parish church, &c. ) the \" burgesses \" obtained \" a charter of franchises,\" \" which was procured by the abbot by a trick, and then burnt under his directions.\"3 The hopes of the poor townsfolk were again frustrated, and we read of nothing further until 1 Hen.

The Ordeal in Anglo-Saxon times was resorted to to settle civil and criminal cases. The accused, if unable to obtain the evidence of a thane or a considerable number. of persons of lesser dignity on his behalf, was compelled to prove (?) his innocence or the justice of his cause by carrying an iron red hot, by plunging his arm into boiling water, eating the sacramental wafer, &c, &c. ; but as the law of evidence became better understood, and as these appeals to the \"judgment of God\" came to be considered profane, the ordeal ceased to exist in practice, although long named in deeds and charters. Some of the other immunities named in Richard's charter to the canons (seepage 88) may be thus explained : \u2014 Exemption from Scot, a customary contribution levied upon all subjects according to their ability. Exemption from Geld, i.e. from fines for committing offences. Exemption from Hornegeld, a tax paid for horned beasts grazing in (the king's) forests (of Acley, Braydon, &c.) Exemption from Daneoeld, originally imposed to provide means to resist the incursions of the Danes, afterwards a source of enrichment to the royal coffers until about 1200. Hidage, a tax on land. Scutage, an extraordinary impost of three marks upon each knight's fee. AVardpenny, money paid for keeping up watch and ward. Shipmoney, a tax formerly levied for support of the royal navy. 1 Rents of assize were the fixed rents compounded for by the free holders and traders of a town or district, payable to a manorial or hundred lord, in lieu of the exactions they were by law allowed to extort from them, such as lastage, a duty on goods sold by the last in the pitched market ; stallage, for the erection of stalls ; pontage and passage, levies for crossing over bridges, through certain manors, or by certain highways. The abbot was exempt from all these, as well as payment of toll, &c. , but levied them generally throughout his manors. From what has been stated it will be seen that not only were the mass of the people living 600 or 700 years ago under a despotism almost beyond our conception, but that the greed of the privileged classes from the monarchs downward had devised every possible means for their own gain, and yet in spite of all these disadvantages, their trade hampered and handicapped in every possible manner, the burghers of the town by their industry and thrift were enabled to procure charters of franchises, and thus to help to lay the foundation of our modern liberties. A man who, like Thomas de Matyshale (see p. 154), dared to dispute the authority of his territorial lord single handed, was certainly possessed of bravery, and ran considerable risk. The same kind of tyranny that was exercised over the industrial population by the aristocracy, they had personally to experience at the hands of the king, and perhaps no class has gained more by popular enfranchisement than they have. The following typical examples of royal extortions from tenants in chief may not be out of place : \u2014 Gilbert de Maisnil pays X marks, or \u00a36 13s. 4d. (but equivalent to many times the amount present money value), for leave to marry. Walter de Caney \u00a315, to marry when and whom he pleased. Wiverone, of Ipswich, \u00a3i 13s. 4d., that she might not be compelled to marry \" any one, except to her own good liking.\" Several towns paid for permission to buy and sell dyed cloth, as they were accustomed to in King Henry's (I. ) time."], [187, "THE MEDI\u00c6VAL MUNICIP4AL BOROUGH. 157 out of man's memory have been used as one hundred before the making the aforesaid deed (i.e. the charter of Richard I.), and (as) belonging to the manor of Cirencester, and (that their court is) holden at the town of Cirencester from three weeks to three weeks, at a certain house called the Tolsede, situate in the middle of the said town. That the manor of Cirencester is the ancient demean of the crown, and that to the said manor belong two free tenants, William Erchbald and the holder of the court, and that all other tenants to the said manor, in the aforesaid town of Cirencester and Mynetie belonging, hold all their lands and tenements according to the custom of the manor of Cirencester.\" In consequence of the return of the jurors, and the desire of the king to reward the townspeople for their loyalty, he conferred on them, as Rudder informs us, a \" court of staple for merchandise,\" and \" erected the town into a corporation, with a mayor and two constables, and others, the commonalty, for the encouragement of trade, by the execution of the statute merchant.\" This charter liberated them from the judicial control of the abbot, and virtually restored them their ancient rights. It would appear, however, that the newly constituted borough was reduced in extent, for the previous limits were almost unquestionably coincident with the space enclosed by the Roman wall, as laid down by Collinson, if indeed some portions of the parish beyond were not included ; but in the readjustment of boundaries the old line was only followed along the western side of Sheep street (see chapter on Roman Antiquities). One reason for reducing the extent of the borough may have been that the maintenance of the wall and fortifications was felt to be an unnecessary burden on the inhabi tants ; certainly they began to be destroyed about this time ; but another and more potent reason may have been the opposition of the abbot, who, as Rudder puts it, \"though he could not withstand the king's pleasure, had sufficient interest to procure that the abbey and its precincts should go with the villages forming the rural hundred of Crowthorne and Minety.\" Thus the Abbey, Almery, Spitalgate, the Barton Grange, and other outlying parts were excluded, and the limits thus laid down formed those of the Parliamentary Borough until 1832, and of the urban district for local government until 1876. The borough so re-constituted by Henry IV. was divided into seven wards, which are still retained (at least in name) : they are \u2014 1.

Ciren cester is stated to be a non-corporate town. During the time that the Danvers's family were lords of Cirencester manor, the townsmen endeavoured to regain their former privileges, and the chief officers of the borough appeared at Westminster to support the claims of the municipality, habited in scarlet robes, but after a long suit in the Exchequer, 37 Elizabeth, they were unable to sustain their cause.2 Before the dissolution of the abbey, the abbot's bailiff took the place of the mayor, and in the Valor Ecelesiasticus, John George, whose duties required him to preside at the Court Leet or View of Frankpledge twice a year, and at the Court Halimote, for the recovery of small debts, every three weeks, is returned as the holder of the office, for which he then received \u00a33 18s. 4d., the amount of a year's fees, besides his salary of \u00a33 as steward of the conventual properties in Cirencester.

In the time of Elizabeth, Sir Giles Poole, knight, appears to have combined the offices, and is returned in certain of the court rolls as \" bailiff, or steward, or keeper of the views of frankpledge, and of .all the courts of . . . queen, of her liberty of her seven hundreds of Cirencester,\" \u2014 the lordship of the hundreds granted at the dissolution to Sir Thomas Seymour, and in 6 Ed.

The offices of the two high constables and fourteen wardsmen, granted under the charter of incorporation, are still retained, but since 5 Hen. V. they have been appointed annually at the November court leet, as likewise certain other officers whose duties and designations appear to have been modified according to the requirements of the times. Thus the \" conser vators of pavements\" appointed in 1477 are not mentioned in the court rolls eighty years later, but besides the two constables and the two tithingmen (officers of the tithing, or wardsmen) for each ward, we read of \" conservators of the waters,\" described in one roll as \" conservators \" only ; of the \" searchers of leather ; \" and in one roll (5 Ed. VI.) of the \"wardens,\" who presented that certain men \" did vend in the time of Lent, salmon, herrings, and other unwholesome and corrupt fish.\" The appointments now include water-bailiffs, answering to the former conservators ; carnals, to inspect the meat and fish, and fresh provisions, offered for sale ; and ale-tasters, who are generally credited with a faithful performance of their duties. Until 1825 there was no other provision for the matters affecting the public welfare of the town, but the passing of the Town Commissioners' Act in that year, and the improved machinery for local government and enlarged powers exercised by the Local Board since 1876, have rendered the duties of the ancient officers a thing of the past. The high steward and high bailiff are, however, still the returning officers at parliamentary elections, and until the establishment of the County Court in 1847, the former gentleman presided at the Court of Requests for the town and seven hundreds, and the sergeant-at-mace was sergeant of the same extensive jurisdiction, and retained his interest as sergeant of the County Courts of Cirencester, Stroud, and Northleach until his death. This gentleman, the late Mr. Markins, senior, died in 1861, and was frequently pleased to appear in his robes as \" sergeant \" for the borough, but although so worthily worn by him, they were discarded by his successor, but continued for a time by his deputy, who filled the less dignified but not less useful one of town crier. The awe-inspiring mace has, however, been brought from its seclusion on a few subsequent occasions of a public character, and is always placed before the high steward at the annual court leet meeting. We have been informed that about forty or fifty years ago an offer was made to restore the Cirencester municipality, but that it was declined by the advice of certain gentlemen who considered popular elections as productive of ill-feeling. It is satisfactory that there is now greater confidence exhibited in the expression of the people's will in a legitimate manner. The Town Commissioners' Act of 1825, for \" paving, cleansing, draining, lighting, watching, regulating, and improving the town of Cirencester, and for disposing of certain common and waste"], [190, "160 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. lands and common rights within the parishes of Cirencester and Preston, and for making drains through the said parishes, and the parish of Siddington, in the county of Gloucester,\" passed in the 6th year of the reign of Geo. IV, and obtained the Royal assent 22nd of June, 1825. Under its provisions, a certain number of the wealthier inhabitants were appointed Commis sioners, with the right to fill vacancies as they might occur, and possessed of powers which virtually superseded nearly all those of the officers appointed at the court leet, excepting the constables, whose powers were, as elsewhere, subsequently delegated to the county police. The preamble of the Act stated that \" whereas the town of Cirencester is large and populous, and the footpaths in several of the streets, lanes, public passages, and places within the said town are ill paved, and are not sufficiently repaired, cleansed, drained, lighted, and watched, and are subject to various obstructions, &c, and are unsafe for travellers and passengers,\" &c, &c. \"And whereas there are at Watermoor, in the parish of Cirencester, certain waste lands, containing six acres and eleven perches,\" and also within the same parish and that of Preston \"a certain common, called Kingsmead, containing forty-three acres three roods and twenty-two perches, or there abouts,\" in which Earl Bathurst, Miss Master, and other inhabi tants, being proprietors of land and tenements in the town, possessed common rights, \" and the several persons interested in these common lands had consented that they should be sold for the purpose of carrying out the object of the Act.\" The Act contains too many clauses to attempt even a very concise abstract, but it will be sufficient to state that it provides very fully for all the objects stated in the title and the preamble, and that in consequence of its provisions the Town Commissioners were enabled to carry out a succession of improvements, and it is just to these gentlemen to state that although not directly responsible to their fellow-ratepayers, they appear to have generally carried out the powers delegated to them with due regard to the public benefit. The sale of the Watermoor common provided an outlet for the increasing population, and by the subsequent sales of the Nursery, Stratton, and Pitacre estates, the town now extends over a much larger area than in 1825, and consequently it was determined, half a century later, to readjust the boundaries, and to constitute a new district, subject to the provisions of the Local Government Board. Accordingly the new district was planned out, and it was suggested to include the adjacent parish of Stratton (which by the Reform Act of 1867 had been already included in the Parliamentary Borough), or as much of it as from its proximity to the town was urban in character, but this was objected to by the inhabitants of Stratton, and the district was eventually"], [191, "THE LOCAL BOARD. 161 formed to comprise 2,600 acres of the parish of Cirencester, the tithing of Wiggold being excluded on the eastern side, and an artificial boundary laid down on the western side, excluding the tithing of Oakley and a part of Barton tithing. The limits thus defined are likewise those of the Urban Sanitary District of Cirencester, the remaining half of the parish1 combining with the 38 parishes in the Poor Law Union to form the Rural Sanitary District. The members of the Local Board are fifteen in number, elected for three years, five retiring each year. Mr. Zachary is the present chairman ; Mr. Ellett, clerk ; Mr. W. H. Holland, surveyor; Mr. J. Williams, sanitary inspector; .and Dr. Bond, medical officer. The first election, at which 33 candidates presented themselves, took place in April, 1876. By the establishment of the Local Board the town is subject to a local jurisdiction more in accordance with the spirit of the times, and which, by the aid of well considered bye laws, is in a position to execute the requirements demanded by modern sanitary knowledge. Since its formation an extensive system of sewerage has been carried out from the designs of Mr. Grantham, C.E., the streets and roads outside the ancient limits have been lighted with public gas lamps, and greater attention devoted to the foot and carriage ways than was possible under the highway rates. The public spirit of the inhabitants had for many years led to extensive street improvements and the erection of shops and buildings, which would compare favourably with those in much larger provincial towns. Improved smaller dwellings have since sprung up under the requirements of the Board, and the Public Health Act (1875) has induced an effectual system of sanitary inspection. Fuller particulars of the Cirencester Local Board and their annual reports may be obtained from the filed copies of the Wilts and Gloucestershire Standard in the British Museum. Before quitting the subject of the local government of Cirencester, the Bond for the prosecution of offenders entered into by the property owners and wealthier householders of the town in 1774 calls for notice.

THE LIBERTY OF THE SEVEN HUNDREDS. The author of the Sloane M.S., No. 4206 (see page 4) writes that Richard I. appointed seven overseers of the \" wapentakes adjoining to this towne \" of Cirencester. This may or may not be correct, but it is certain that when that monarch conferred the lordship of these \" wapentakes 'n upon the Abbot and his successors, that they had been then annexed to the Manor of Cirencester and formed into a distinct jurisdiction. This might have been done by himself, but it is more likely, as suggested by the statement just quoted, by the charter of Richard, and by the Esch\u00e6tor's Report (4 Hen. IV.), that the district was formed earlier, and probably by the Saxon Kings, Cirencester being under them a royal town and an ancient crown manor. However this may have been, the Liberty of the Seven Hundreds under the early abbots was possessed of certain privileges which virtually constituted it as a county of itself with its chief court at Ciren cester, and it was thus independent of the court of the remainder 1 Hundreds are so called in Yorkshire and some other counties."], [193, "163 THE SEV7EN HUNDREDS. of the county held at Gloucester.1 For in the Cartularies of Gloucester Abbey, Vol. III., p. 180, it is stated, under date 1266, that Robert de Aula for certain land had to attend or do service on behalf of the Abbot of Gloucester, throughout the \" County of Gloucester and all the Hundreds of Cirencester ; \" and in 1290, the Earls, Barons, and other freemen of the Liberty of the Seven Hundreds of \" Cyrecestre,\" \" though they did not attend the County Court of Gloucester,2 nor obtain judicial decisions therein, nor hold communication with those belonging to the county,\" \" complained that they were taxed to a fourth part of a levy on the said county,\" and were granted a case in the Court of Chancery, the answer being returned \" Habeant Breve in Cancellar 'quod Barones sac 'quod justum fuerit \" \u2014 i.e., Let them have a brief in Chancery that the Barons may do what is just.3 In 1222 Henry III. granted permission to the Abbot to make a gaol in the town for the Hundreds Liberty, and instructed the Sheriff of the County that the Abbot's rights were to be respected, for it appears that a few years before Gerard de \u00c6tries (see page 77), or as he is called in the Close Rolls, Gerard de Atia, having been appointed \" Custos \" of the County of Gloucester, thereupon disseised the Abbot, but King John after an Inquisition had been held, restored the Abbot's privileges, and instructed the Barons of the Exchequer to that effect.4 Frequent mention is made of the Abbot's prison at Cirencester in subsequent times. In 1223 the Abbot, at the King's request, received the county 1 There are several instances of the enfranchisement of certain towns and districts \u2014 Bristol, Hull, Berwick-upon-Tweed, Lichfield, and some other places, are counties of themselves. The Isle of Ely, a division similar in character to the Seven Hundreds, still retains its court of quarter sessions and its shire hall, but the assizes are held at Cambridge for the whole of the county. Pleas of the Crown were also excluded from the Abbot's jurisdiction, and the few instances in which the king's judges held a court at Cirencester were exceptional, and may have been as in the last recorded instance in 1679, on account of epidemics raging in the county capital. The earliest mention of the justices attending Cirencester is in 1199. The Screeve Hide, or Sheriff's Hide, named in the charter of Henry I. to the Abbey, is confirmatory of Cirencester even then possessing a separate jurisdiction, but when it became merged in the county is uncertain \u2014 in subsequent times it is evident that a great deal of county, as well as Seven Hundreds, business was done at Cirencester. In the 16th and 17th centuries the Gloucestershire contingents of troops, designed either for home or foreign service, were always assembled here, as for instance August 12th, 1585. Sir Nicholas Poyntz, Sir Anthony Hungerford, the Sheriff, and the rest of the Justices of Gloucestershire, assembled at Cirencester, wrote to the States Council that they had put in readiness the 300 soldiers required, and placed the whole under Captain Baskerville to proceed to London.

Her residence there having terminated, Henry III., being at Cirencester July 23rd in that year, wrote a letter instructing the Sheriff to remove the prisoners back to Gloucester Castle.2 After the Cirencester Hundreds were again incorporated with the County, the Hundred Courts continued to be held every three weeks, under the presidency of the deputy or steward of the lord of the manor of Cirencester, for taking cognizance of all personal actions where the debt or damage did not amount to 40s. This court had answered its purpose, but 40s. in 1792 was a small amount in comparison with what it was at the time of the institution of the court, and as its expenses had increased in proportion to the depreciation in the value of money whilst the amount recoverable had remained nominally the same, the proceedings in such actions were found \"to be vexatious, expensive, and dilatory,\" and this led to the passing, in 1792, of an Act to dissolve the old Court, and establish a \" Court of Requests,\" \" for the more easy and speedy recovery of small debts within the Hundreds of Cirencester, Crowthorne, and Minety, Brightwell's Barrow, Rapsgate, Bradley, Bisley, and Longtree, commonly called the Seven Hundreds of Cirencester.\" By this Act 75 Commissioners were appointed to settle causes (three only being sufficient to hold a court), at a court house in Cirencester, and they were empowered, by their Clerk, to issue summonses, subp\u0153na witnesses, administer oaths, award executions of distraint, and commit to Gloucester gaol for non-payment (after judgment had been given) any person for 20 days for debts of 20 shillings and under, and for debts up to 40 shillings for 40 days, the imprisonment to be deemed as a full discharge of the debt and attendant costs. Each Commissioner was required to possess \u00a3500 personal estate or real property worth \u00a320 per annum. Thirty-eight were to be appointed by the Earls Bathurst, as Lords of the Hundreds, and the remaining 37 after their first selection could fill up vacancies in their number. The Court of Requests continued to be held in the Town Hall every alternate Thursday until 1847, when the County Court districts of Cirencester, Stroud, and Northleach, were formed out of the Seven Hundreds. The powers then entrusted to the judges have since been considerably increased, so that suitors in the County Courts are saved much of the expense previously incurred in the higher courts. Charles Sumner, Esq., is the present Judge, and R. A. Anderson, Esq., the Registrar.

The Hundred Rolls, 1273, give the same list as above, omitting Bisley, as being held by the Abbot, but in this same report an occurrence at Rendcombe is mentioned under the heading of Bisley hundred, so that possibly Bisley and Rapsgate were then considered as one hundred ; the Valor of 1535 and the Cirencester Court Rolls of Edward VI. and Elizabeth's reigns also omit Bisley, and the latter have no particulars of the parishes now considered as belonging to that hundred. In 1608, however, the Seven Hundreds Division is made to include the borough hundred of Cirencester and the seven rural hundreds of Crowthorne, Bisley, Rapsgate, Brightwell's Barrow, Bradley, Longtree, and Whitstone,2 and the same list occurs in Atkyns (1712), Fosbroke (1804), and Archdeacon Rudge (1807), but it is clear that the list given in the Court of Requests Act, which omits Whitstone but includes Bisley, is that which for judicial purposes had long constituted the division, and so it continued until the institution of the County Courts in 1847. It will be seen that the number of hundreds from 1273 to 1535 besides the town hundred was only five, although called seven, but this was probably the true number in Richard I.'s reign, for the said five hundreds are co-extensive with eight (and if we include Bisley, with nine) in the Domesday Book \u2014 Crowthorne answering to \" Cirecestre \" and \" Gersdones,\" Brightwell's Barrow to \" Brict woldesberg \" and \" Begeberie,\" and Bradley to \" Bradelie \" and \" Wacrescumb.\" The \"Seven Hundreds Division,\" under the \" Court of Requests Act,\" comprised an area of about 200,000 acres, and stretched (excluding the detached parish of Minety3) about 26 miles from Aston Blank to Weston Birt in a direct line, and about the same from Rodborough to St. John's Bridge, Lechlade. It included about seventy rural parishes, besides Cirencester and the market towns of Stroud, Painswick, Minchin hampton, Fairford, Northleach, and Tetbury. At the dissolution, the lordship of the hundreds was granted to Lord Seymour, but on his attainder, to Sir Anthony Kingstone, 6 E. VI. Subsequently it reverted to the Crown, and was granted to Sir Thomas Parrie, whose son and heir disposed of it to Sir John Danvers. 1 Charters of Richard and John, Close Rolls of Henry III., &c, &c. 2 See Historical MSS.

The manor and borough hundred of Cirencester were sold by the Danvers family to Henry Poole, whose son, Sir William Poole, in 1645, assigned them with their appurtenancies to his mother for her life, and after her death to her daughter, Anne Poole, and her heirs, which Anne was married to James Earl of Newburgh, and released them to him and his heirs. His heir, Charles, married Frances , to whom he left the premises in fee, who sold them in 1695 to Sir Benjamin Bathurst, the direct ancestor of the present Earl Bathurst.1 The Lordship of the Hundreds, which eventually came into the possession of the Bathurst family, did not descend with the manor as above. For in the reign of Charles II. it belonged to Sir Robert Atkyns, and then to his son (the historian), and grandson. The daughters and co-heiresses of the latter were married to Thomas Horde, Esq., and Mr. Chamberlayne, of Maugersbury, near Stow, and through them these gentlemen became possessed each of a moiety of the profits of the lordship ; the latter died in 1774, and in 1778 (when Rudder wrote his History of Gloucestershire), a suit was pending by which the ex-Lord Chancellor Bathurst sought and subsequently recovered the said lordship from Mr. Horde and the Rev. Mr. Chamberlayne (vicar of Little Ilford, Essex, and the son of the above).2 In February, 1603,3 an enquiry was held at Devizes respecting the estate of Sir Charles Danvers, at Dauntsey, and who had been attainted of high treason, but pardoned, and it was stated that he, \" having the fee-farm of the seven hundreds of Cisiter, placed a new steward, new bailiffs, kept courts in his own name, received all the profits and rents both of Sir Henry Poole and others, and offered to sell this land to Sir Henry this last year,\" and that \"the house at Ciceter is ancient demesne land, and passed by surrender to Sir Charles in his father's lifetime, and long before any of his attainders for treason or felony.\" When Sir R. Atkyns, senior, Justice of the Common Bench, had the privilege of the \" execution and return of writs within the seven hundreds,\" he brought an action for trespass against the under sheriff of Gloucestershire for violating this privilege, but compromised the matter January 13, 1673-4, on the stipulation that each future under sheriff should return to him upon oath the list of writs issued (under a bond of \u00a350), and that they should pay to him and his heirs for each writ 6d. A Bill to validity this agreement passed the Lords February 26, 1676-7, but was rejected (as it deserved to be) by the Commons.4 1 See Rudder. 2 Rudder's Gloucestershire. 3 Domestic State Papers, 1603. 4 Historical MSS.

The Courts of the Hundreds and Court Halimote of the Borough, held at Cirencester every three weeks. The Views of Frankpledge for the Borough. The following extracts and particulars are interesting, as illustrative of the customs and social life of upwards of three centuries ago : \u2014 \" Cirencester Court Roll, 1 Eliz.\" \" Langtre Hundred.\" View of Frankpledge, held by Sir Giles Poole, on behalf of Sir Thomas Parrie, the Queen's Treasurer of the Household, April 5, 1559. Then follow the presentments of the tithingmen of each parish \u2014 rents certain, estrays, vendors of \"beer by unlawful measure,\" and \"therefore in mercy\" [or amerced], usually 3d. These occur in nearly every parish, and the persons amerced for \" vending beer by unlawful measure \" strangely repeat the (\"?) offence, and are amerced at each view. The amercements were really licenses to sell, for where the opprobrious epithet is omitted the amercement is still the same. The same remarks apply to persons \" occupying corn mills \" and \" taking toll in an excessive way ; \" each miller was required to pay for his licence, and that he would take an unfair advantage of his monopoly was a foregone conclusion. Estrays were kept for a year and a day, and then sold. The following are some of the values assigned to them : \u2014 Mare and foal, 6s. 8d. ; mare, 4s. ; old mare, 12d. ; colts, 12d. to 5s. ; bullock, 4s. ; cow, 10s. ; calves, 20d. to 2s. 8d. ; sheep, 6d. to 16d. ; wether sheep, 16d. to 40d. ; young pig, 20d. ; porker, 3s. ; hoggaster, 1 6d. The people of Weston Birt, April 5, 1559, are required to repair the common gate of the park by St. George's day (April 23), under 6s. 8d. penalty. Of Elkstone, to repair the \" King's highway there in Whitsun week,\" under 3s. 4d. penalty; and April 15, 1574, Thomas Conway, gentleman, the footpath near his mill by Midsummer day, penalty 5s. October 20, 1563, the Culkerton people to repair the park gate and the stocks, under 10s. penalty, and of Weston Birt to make a fresh pair of stocks by Candlemas day, under 13s. 4d. penalty. April 22, 1563, Joan Parker, widow, having erected a gate on a certain highway leading towards Cirencester, \" to the injury of the liege subjects of our Lady the Queen,\" is ordered to remove it by Midsummer day, under 20s. penalty ; and the same lady and Jerome Barnard are charged to repair Loveday foot bridge ; and the inhabitants of Coin St. Alwyns, Aylesworth's bridge. By Statute, all persons were compelled to have their bows and arrows in good repair, and each tithingman had to ascertain"], [198, "168 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. each Whit Tuesday, under 20s. penalty, that these conditions were complied with in his parish, and the targets all right. Nearly all the villages had to pay an annual \" fine of wake \" (or wake silver), 3d. ; and a few, certain amounts each year called \" hole \" or \" hoole \" silver, as Duntisbourn Abbotts 2s., Coin St. Alwyns, 5s., &c., &c. Amongst other matters dealt with at the \" views :\" \u2014 In 1559, Thomas Monnaux and John Marshall, both described as \" gentle men,\" \"did fight together,\" at Culkerton, \"to the effusion of blood of the aforesaid Marshall, and in the default of both of them,\" Monnaux amerced 6d. and Marshall 4d. These occurrences were not uncommon, and the fines inflicted about the same, notably little in comparison with offences against property and other matters referred to. At Bradley hundred view, November, 1563, John Williams, of Winston, was fined 12d. for \"an affray upon Robert Curtis, by which he did break his arm,\" and Thomas Wakefyld, of Compton Abdale, 9d., for not \" behaving himself well towards his neighbours.\" At Preston, five men were fined from 2d. to 4d. each for using \"unlawful games\" and \" playing at bowls,\" a very common offence. William Grene, of Eastleach, guilty of stealing a sheet worth 3s. 4d., was ordered April, 1574, to be \"delivered out of ward at Cirencester,\" on the understanding that Richard Baggott and John Grene should \" put him in the stockes on Sunday all day.\" How long the unfortunate man had been in prison awaiting his trial is not stated, possibly from the previous October. At Crowthorne view, April 27, 1563, \" The jurors present that Margaret George did feloniously steal a \"karchif,\" value ten pence, of the goods of Thomas Ridler, of Daglingworth, on the 21st day of March last. \" Therefore let her be put in the stockes.\" The monetary values assigned to the last named articles are not far different from those of the present time, which really means, taking into consideration the average purchasing power of money at that time, that they were many times the price that they are now. This was the case with all manufactured and imported articles, so that many working men in full employ can now possess articles of comfort and luxury in those days un attainable by persons of comparative wealth, thanks to the removal of restrictions on trade, and improved methods of manufacture. On the other hand, home produced food, in which the supply then generally far exceeded the demand, was much cheaper than now, but we are not subjected to famine prices resulting from bad harvests. The first tea imported into England was sold at a fabulous price, and this is not surprising, but that a sheet should be worth as much as a horse and cow, or a kerchief as a sheep, is certainly not in accordance with present ideas. The gross returns from the spring and autumn seven hundreds'"], [199, "THE COURT ROLLS. 169 views of frankpledge (omitting Cirencester) for 1st Eliz. were the hole silver payment each year, \u00a31 13s. ; profits of two beast markets, \u00a32 ; hundred views (or court leets), \u00a311 18s. 9d ; goods of George Lynet, a felon, indicted but not attained, \u00a34 ; total, \u00a319 11s. 9d. The proceedings at the Court of the Hundreds, held every three weeks at Cirencester, were for the settlement of debts and petty civil actions, and for 1551 yielded \u00a31 18s. 8d. in fines, &c. The Court Halimote of the Borough dealt with similar cases, and in addition certain matters incidental to the claims of the lord of the manor. Thus, at the Halimote, April 11, 1151, \"Robert Strange, gentleman,\" asked licence that he and Joan his wife might \" let their tenements, &c, called le Antelope, with the appurtenances, to a certain John Chappleyne, for the term of twenty-one years,\" which licence is granted to them \" in full court for a fine of 20d.\" Halimote, May 2, 1551, \"William Partridge\" came, \"and did surrender into the hands of the said Lord the King, one messuage or tenement situate in a strete called Battel-strete, formerly called Monmouth-place, and now in the tenure of the said William Partridge and Margaret his wife, for the term of their lives and of the longer liver of them, and after their decease to the use, &c, according to the custom of the manor of Cirencester. Upon which the Lord the King did by his steward grant, and by the bailiff and his officers did put in seisin, the aforesaid William Partridge, &c, who did give for a fine for having the aforesaid estate five shillings, and they weie admitted tenants.\" At the great hundred held each year in October, the \" free suitors of the court aforesaid, from three weeks to three weeks, by their attornies did come and did ask that the rents of a fine for their suits for the whole year following should be released, as doth appear upon their polls.\" The fines were from 6d. to 12d., amounting in the aggregate for 1562 to 19s. 2d., and the free suitors of the hundreds included Lords Barkley and Latimer, Sir Giles Poole, John Hungerford, the President and Scholars of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, &c. The same thing was done at the October borough court halimote, Sir John Briggis (or Brydges), the wardens of the church of St. John the Baptist and other free suitors paying fines in 1550, 7s. 2d., the total amercements for 14 courts (1550-51) being \u00a31 Is. 6d. The following particulars are taken from the views of frank pledge for the borough, 1550-51 and 1559. The proceedings were similar to the court leets now held. The jury having been appointed, and the tithingman of each \" strete \" or ward being exacted and sworn, made his presentment concerning the licensed tradesmen and the breaches of the peace and the regulations of the manor; then the conservators of the waters reported every"], [200, "170 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. year that there were six glovers who \" put hides in the river,\" \"whereby the water becomes insipid,\" or as in 1559 court roll, \" whereby the fishponds and the water becomes and insipid.\" Where were the fishponds ? They were regularly fined 2d. each in April and October, and allowed to go on as before. The searchers of leather presented in 1550 that there were nine and in 1551 twelve \" common curriers,\" who \" do vend leather in the market.\" They were not all residents, two being from Gloucester and one from Berkeley. No mention is made of the conservators of pavement established by the Act of 1477, nor of the ale-tasters we have now, but in 1551, Thomas Swyn dlehurst was fined for disobeying an injunction \" to cleanse the pavement in the highway opposite his house,\" and six people for permitting pigs at large in the public places, and Robert Jones was amerced 2d. because he \" did manipern for Morgan his servant who committed an insult upon the constable.\" Of the ale sellers, some are described as \" vending beer out of their houses by the wine quart,\" or as vending \" a wine quart of beer \" \" for money against the ordinance \" of the town of Cirencester, and were amerced 2d. each. Others \"did vend tavern beer, and did deliver only a wine quart of beer for money without doors,\" and amerced 6d. aud 2d. each. In 1559, four are returned as \" vending beer without the license of the officer of the lord (of the manor) there,\" and were amerced 4d. to 12d. each. Certain were fined for not \"vending beer by the measure appointed at the view of frankpledge,\" bakers as breaking the assize, butchers as selling meat at an excessive rate, and, in 1550, John Typper and John Turner, publicans, are declared to have \"used in their houses unlawful games,\" and others were amerced for harbouring tramps and vagrants. Of regularly licensed tradesmen, Cirencester possessed in 1550-51, eight bakers, twelve butchers, four chandlers, one person described as using \"the art of fishing\" and \"vending fish,\" and, in 1559, two hotel keepers in Dyer ward, described as \" persons holding common inns, who vend provender for horses and provide other necessaries,\" ten holders of \" common inns with signs,\" who vend victuals (two being in Cricklade ward, five in Gosditch, and three in St. Lawrence), twenty alehouse keepers, making a total of thirty-two publicans for 3,000 people. It must be remembered, however, that Cirencester was at that time much frequented by travellers passing along its important highways, and attending its wool and other markets. There being no express trains or even stage coaches, people would have frequently to stop on their way to the metropolis and other places. Besides its thirty-two public houses, there were in 1559, twelve keepers of \" private inns without signs,\" who \" vend victuals, &c,\" and twenty-one sellers of beer to be consumed off the premises."], [201, "FA.RT XV. REPRESENTATION OF THE BOROUGH. Cirencester is stated to have sent representatives to a great council as early as 1338, but did not acquire the right of permanently electing two members until 1571. At first the freeholders are said to have been the electors, but after the contested election of 1624, it was determined that here, and where there was no charter to the contrary, \"the inhabitants, householders not receiving alms, should make the election.\" In many corporate boroughs, the freeholders only were the electors. On November 4th, 1690, the House resolved \"That the inhabitants of the borough of Cirencester being inmates have no right to vote in electing burgesses to serve in Parliament.\" The petition which gave rise to this decision was that of J. Howe v. H. Powle and R. Howe, in 1689, and renewed the following year, and after hearing, re-committed for the summing up of the poll (the Steward of Cirencester being required to attend before the Committee), then referred back for further evidence, and the production of the overseers' book, J. and R. Howe being eventually returned. The election of 1708 being declared void on petition, it was decided that \" the inhabitants of the Abbey, the Emery, and the Spiringate lane have not a right to vote in such election.\" By Act of Parliament, 1786, six months' residence was required of every inhabitant householder before exercising the franchise. It was resolved, March 28, 1792, in reference to the petition, Preston v. Master, that to be considered a householder it was imperative to possess the exclusive right to the outer door of the building, and to the staircase, passages, and doorways communi cating between the several apartments, but the taking of lodgers was not to affect that right, and any building used as a dwelling, even if containing but a single apartment, was to be considered a house, and also all the dwellings that had separate outward doors opening into a covered street passage (of which there are many in Cirencester) \" were to give good votes.\" By the Reform Act of 1832, the limits of the borough were made co-extensive with the parish, and the residents of the rising Y"], [202, "172 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. town outside the old boundary added to the register; but the \u00a310 franchise, which added many voters to those constituencies where the freemen or a few select personages alone possessed the right of voting, materially reduced the electoral roll at Cirencester, until by the Representation of the People Act (1867), the old qualification which had been enjoyed at Cirencester for so many years previously to 1832 became, with slight modifications, the established one for every borough in England and Wales. Under the Act of 1832, the old right voters (numbering nearly 250) retained the qualification for life, provided they did not forfeit it by becoming paupers or by residence elsewhere) either perma nently or temporarily). On the register for 1865-66 there were forty-eight old right voters, but in the list prepared for 1885 these have dwindled to two. The Act of 1867 added the parish of Stratton, and reduced its representatives (as in all boroughs under 10,000) to one. Lord John Russell's Reform Bill of 1852 proposed to enlarge the constituency by the addition of Fairford and Lechlade, to return two members ; and the Russell-Gladstone Bill of 1866 contemplated grouping the small boroughs under 7,000 popu lation, those containing an aggregate of over 15,000 to return two members, but under 15,000 one member. By this plan Tewkesbury, Evesham, and Cirencester would have formed one constituency, returning two members, under the designation of the Cirencester boroughs, the largest town in each case giving the name. This plan had been generally adopted with the towns in Scotland and Wales, as the Montrose boroughs, Caernarvon boroughs, &c. The Reform Bills of 1859 and 1860 were each designed to have deprived Cirencester of one member. Until the election of 1868, the nomination and polling, in case of a contest, took place at hustings temporarily erected in the Market-place, but the Act of 1872 put an end to public nominations, with their election speeches and show of hands, and established vote by ballot, so that parliamentary elections are now conducted much more quietly than formerly. The limitation of the time of polling to one day, in 1832, removed a great cause of corruption. The elector has been for some years, too, under the protection of the ballot, and we trust that the extended constituencies and the recent Corrupt Practices' Act will complete what the ballot has begun, and secure perfect purity and freedom in voting. The conduct at the Cirencester elections, as well as generally even in the earlier years of this century, was disgraceful beyond measure, and Rudder's appeal to the electors of his time was certainly needed. We leave the records of these elections unpublished, and state what is more gratifying, that for many years this town has been in comparison with other places singularly free from bribery and treating. Whatever causes may"], [203, "PARLIAMENTARY REPRESENTATION. 173 be assigned for this, something is due to the disfavour with which these practices have been viewed with the electorate, and it deserves to be placed on record that the electors and friends of one Cirencester candidate secured his return free of expense at a time when such a procedure was almost without precedent, and the check clerks, messengers, &c, at that election refused payment for their services. In 1852, there was a grand display of bunting, but flags, bands of music, &c, at the candidates' expense, were shortly afterwards rendered illegal, and the local practice of chairing the members was discontinued some years before. The number of electors in 1831 was about 600; in 1865, 430; in 1868, 1,070 ; and in 1884, 1,145. By the Redistribution of Seats Bill (1885), Cirencester ceases to have separate representation, but gives its name to one of the five proposed county divisions, viz., the Stroud, Cirencester, Tewkesbury, Thornbury, and Forest of Dean divisions. The Cirencester division includes the petty sessional districts of Cirencester, Tetbury, Fairford, Northleach, Stow, Moreton, and Chipping Campden. corresponding generally with the hill country east of the escarpment of the Cotswolds, from which the Cirencester market is principally supplied. Its boundary is almost identical with that of the Archdeaconry of Cirencester, and of the Court of Requests, excepting that this jurisdiction only comprehended the southern portion of the new county division, and that at its fullest extent it included a portion of the new Stroud division. Cirencester will be the largest of the Gloucestershire divisions, the greatest length being from Clifford Chambers, near Stratford-on-Avon, to Didmarton, and breadth from Dowdeswell, near Cheltenham, to Lechlade. Number of parishes, 125; population in 1881, 55,510. By the original scheme of the Boundary Commissioners, Cirencester would have disappeared from Parliamentary annals altogether, the Cirencester and Tetbury petty sessional districts being united to those of Stroud and florsley to form a Stroud division, and the remainder of the Cotswold country being included in a \" Stow division.\" It was certain that a scheme which ignored Cirencester as the capital of the Cotswolds, and united it with a district so heterogeneous in character, would not be acceptable. In a few hours 500 signatures were obtained in the Cirencester market, and a deputation from the town and district, composed of all shades of political opinion, waited on Major Tulloch, the Inquiry Commissioner, at Gloucester, December 30, 1884, and its representations were ably supported by the Lord Lieutenant, the County Members, the Members for the merged boroughs, and gentlemen from Stroud. Major Tulloch courteously expressed himself convinced of the cogency of the issues raised, and the Cirencester, Stroud, and Tewkesbury divisions were"], [204, "174 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. framed according to the excellent suggestions of Mr. Ellett, and as formed they could scarcely be improved upon. The Stroud comprises the celebrated Stroud clothing district ; the Forest of Dean, the county between the Severn and the Wye, once belonging to the Marches of Wales, and largely composed of miners ; the Tewkesbury and Thornbury, the lovely fertile Severn valley east of the river, the former including the county free holders resident in Gloucester and Cheltenham, and the latter those of Bristol and a considerable mining population in the neighbourhood.

He was popularly known as \"Jack Howe,\" and was a man of unquestion able talent and oratorical power, but of an acrid temperament which at length made him greatly disliked. He was first elected to the Parliament which was called without the royal mandate to dethrone James II. At this time he was known as a strenuous supporter of William and as a sound Whig. He accepted office as Vice-Chamberlain to the Queen, but was dismissed for conjectured impropriety. From this time, though a professed Whig, he always voted with the Tories, opposed the King especially in his foreign policy, and paid court to the king of France. His spite is said to have been restrained by nothing but anxiety for his personal safety, and he issued his savage lampoons against all classes, including even the monarch, so that William \u2014 usually calm \u2014 was led to declare in a moment of haste, that were he a private gentleman he would invite Mr. Howe to a short interview behind Montague House. In 1698, having retired from Cirencester, he became member for the county, and in 1701 was again elected.

His address, dated May 15, 1802, assured his supporters that he was highly satisfied with his canvass, and that he trusted that they would \"indignantly spurn all attempts to seduce\" them \"from the assertion and establishment of their independence. \" There is nothing to enlighten us as to Mr. Howell's politics, and it would appear that Cirencester shared in the prevailing apathy which existed in respect to beneficial legislation in consequence of the all absorbing concern about French invasion. 2 Mr. Pitt, solicitor, in Cirencester, and afterwards Conservative member for Cricklade, advised Mr. Cripps to come forward, as Sir Robert Preston, through neglect of their interest, had lost the confidence of most of the electors, and because it was thought that if Mr. Howell \u2014 the other people's man or \" independent \" candidate\u2014 came forward he would not be generally supported. Mr. Howell did not venture to stand, but Sir Robert Preston after this came to the town and withdrew on finding that Mr. Cripps was certain of election.

In 1812 Lord Apsley, having attained his majority, came forward. His return was certain and the contest rested with the former member for the second seat.

THE MANOR HOUSE AND PARK. The streets of Cirencester may be divided into two classes, viz., those which have sprung up with the extension of the town during the past sixty years, and those which previously constituted it, nearly all of which occur in documents of the 14th and 15th centuries. Since 1801, the population and area covered have doubled, but owing to ravages of disease and other causes the previous progress, as in other places, was slow, and for 400 years at least no enlargement of its limits took place. The Lady Chapel Register, compiled in 1460, and containing copies of several earlier documents, principally of* the preceding century, contains in sol. 18 an abstract of its possessions in the following order : \u2014 Chepyng-strete, Crekelade-strete, New-strete, Fosse, Shoter strete, Gosedyche, Seynt Cecyly-strete, Batel-strete, Raton-rewe, St. Lauren-strete, Abbot-strete. A comparison with the ward list on page 157 will shew that some names are the same in both, and that a similar, although not actually identical, order has been observed. For instance, Chepyng and Crekelade \" stretes \" head each list, followed by Castel-strete or ward, in the one, and New-strete, Fosse, and Shoter-strete in the other ; then comes Gosedyche in both. In the Court Rolls Inchstrope is invariably placed last, but here its street follows Gosedyche, and Doler-strete is not mentioned, but Batel and Abbot \" stretes \" are both in Dollar-ward. St. Laurence-strete occupies the same position in both. \" Fosse \" is unquestionably Lewis-lane, the continuation of the great Fosse highway to its junction with the Ermine Way, and if the Court Roll order is here followed New-strete must be Querns-lane, for the town side of both these \" lanes \" lies in Cricklade-ward. On this assumption, Shoter-strete would be Sheep-street in Castle ward. It is probable that the line of the Fosse was originally"], [212, "182 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. continued along Querns-lane to the Amphitheatre, the longitudinal axis of which is almost in the same right line. The name New strete certainly is hardly consistent with this idea, but as there is no other existing street to which it can well be referred, and as the ancient street, if it did exist, has been destroyed along Querns-hill, it is possible that the \" New-strete \" may have been a medi\u00e6val reconstruction of the important highway. There is no uncertainty about either of the others except Raten-rewe, which from its position in the list is probably Spitalgate. Until about twenty years ago, the stream flowed by it in an open channel, but it is now covered over ; water rats abound in the Churn, and Ratten or Rotten-row is not an uncommon name for streets so situated. Chepyng-strete signifies Market-street, both names being retained as the prefix of certain English towns. It was so called from the Markets being principally held in it from Saxon times. In one deed in the Register (dated 1366) it is written Shepyng-strete, but in the others in the same Register, dating from 1348, Dyar-strete, now Dyer-street. This name is derived from the business introduced about 1330 with the clothing and woollen trades. Richard le Dyere was one of the woollen merchants named in the Nones Taxation (1341), and Thomas Dyare, a wealthy resident, who with others endowed a mass service in 1392 in the parish church. The upper end of Dyer-street forming the Market-place averages 80 feet wide for more than 150 yards in length, it is 100 feet across at the widest part, and as an example of street architecture is equalled by few ordinary provincial towns ; but prior to 1830 the part in front of the Church was occupied by the Butter and Butcher rows, each about 100 feet in length, forming three streets. The Town Hall was also hemmed in between houses which extended across the Church green, and formed the Shoe-lane, whilst some more houses nearly opposite the entrance to the Waterloo were known as the Shambles, and near these were the disused stocks. All were purchased and removed by subscriptions and the sale of the Common lands at Watermoor, by which a total of about \u00a38,000 was raised. The Butcher-row is called the Bocher (ewe) in the L. C. Register. The King's Head and the Ram, the stabling of which latter only is still retained, the hotel having been converted some years since into shops, were the leading hotels and posting houses. Both are under the management of the Hotel Company established in 1863, and they are probably identical with the two hotels in the Court Rolls of Edward VI. 's reign ; the former is mentioned by name in 1642, and the latter the year previous. The Fleece has long been celebrated as an excellent commercial hotel, and has a handsome half-timbered Elizabethan front. The Sun, adjoining, (rebuilt in 1861), is pointed to as the inn where the fugitive Prince Charles stayed as Miss Lane's servant. The White Hart,"], [213, "STREETS, TYTHINGS, &C. 183 which stood on the site of Messrs. Greenwood's shop, and must have been erected about 1600, was taken down in 1872. The Old Bull inn, from which the Bull Club is named, adjoined the Fleece eastwards, with a back way into Bull-lane. For many years it was occupied as a warehouse by the late Messrs. Croome, cheese factors. The Waterloo passage connecting Bull-lane with the Market-place, is said to have been so called from a chair bearing that name kept there, and used for bringing ladies from evening parties or entertainments. The Bothehall (or Boothall), where the wool market was held, stood on the site of the Corn Hall Buildings ; and the Market House, erected by Earl Bathurst in 1819, after being converted into a coach-builders' shop, is now an agricultural implement warehouse. Dyer-ward includes, besides the places named, the Waterloo Gardens and the Churchyard. Archibalds, the old manor house of which stood on the site of No. 104, Dyer-street, was at the compilation of the Domesday the residence of the Erchebauds and continued so until 1435, when it passed by grant to John Gerveys and Alice his wife, together with the manor meadows and divers lands belonging. In 3 Henry VIII. the estate passed to the Osmunds, and in 1563 was purchased by the family of Childe, who in 1566 sold it to Richard Master, ancestor of the present proprietor (see Rudder). Cricklade-street, named from the town to which it leads. The houses which make the dangerous angle about half way down, and which it is proposed to set back, probably belonged to the old Bishop Blaize. Many of these over-hanging and picturesque houses have been cleared away during the last twenty or thirty years. Castle-street led to the ancient castle, the exact site of which is not known, but which was certainly at the Querns ; the view taken by some gentlemen a few years since that the castle stood in the park between the kennels and the Tetbury-road being totally at variance with popular tradition, the authority of Leland, and the writings of all previous historians. In Leland's time the ancient earthworks were much more marked than at present, and he could have had no other place than the Querns in his mind when he penned the following words : \u2014 \" In the south south-west side of the waul be lykelyhod hath bene a castel or some other great building, the hilles and ditches yet remayne. The place is now a warren for conys, and therein hath bene fownd mennes bones, insolit\u00e6 magnitudinis (i.e., of uncommon size), also sepulchres, ex secto lapide (i.e., of hewn stone). In one was a round vessel of leade covered, and in it ashes and pieces of bones.\" Itin. V. 5, p. 65. The fields between Sheep street and the Querns, now partly occupied by the G. W. Railway yard and sidings and the cattle market, were known at the close of last century as the Castle Meadows. Nothing is known of"], [214, "184 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. the castle except what is recorded in Part I. It is not mentioned by Gervase of Canterbury, temp. H. II., but stood then, and was probably of Saxon origin. It may have been erected on the foundations of a Roman fortress, and have been the subsequent residence of Penda, Guthrum, &c. Before the erection of the Police Station a castellated ruin stood on its site, but this building was only a caprice of the first Earl Bathurst. Gosditch-street is understood to extend from the Market-place to the first bridge towards Gloucester. The Churn probably flowed along it during the Roman occupation, and for centuries afterwards Leland evidently considered that this was so. About a century since traces of the bed of the stream were found in digging a vault in the Market-place, outside Messrs. Jefferies' shop, and as late as 1780, a branch of the river had its course the entire length of Gloucester-street, in a channel four or five feet deep, which was then filled up at the sole expense of Mr. S. Blackwell, M.P. for the borough. Gosedyche in the Register appears to be intended for the whole ward, which includes Black Jack-street and Park-street, and parts of Silver-street and Park lane. Part of Gosditch-street has been called West Market-place. It contains the Swan and Crown, old hostelries, now commercial hotels. The Swan was a posting-house, and extended from the Crown to the Market-place, but the frontage has been at different times converted into shops. Black Jack-street, according to Rudder, extended from the West Market-place to the foot of Cecily-hill, but now is considered to terminate at Silver-street. In one of the niches of the tower is a figure of St. John, blackened by smoke, hence the name. Rudder states that \" St. John's-street \" occurs in a deed of 1509, and it has been suggested that the modern Black-Jack was intended, but there is no evidence that it was so. Some picturesque houses, forming the angle with Silver-street, were removed in 1868. Silver-street is called \" Little Silver-street \" in 1 605. Park-street and Park-lane form the western boundary of the ward. The latter was known as Lawditch until almost within living memory, from the watercourse or gutter which flowed along it, and is mentioned by Stukeley in 1722 as near the Cross in Castle-street. Doler-strete, now Dollar-street, commences at the bridge where Gosditch-street ends and terminates with the next bridge towards Gloucester. The ancient Almonry stood in it where the Abbey gates now are, and a row of houses known as the Almery (or Emery) extending from thence some distance into the Abbey grounds were taken down in 1826. Coxwell-street, the ancient Abbot-strete, was re-named after a wealthy family who resided in it about two centuries ago. The branch of the Churn which flows between it and Black Jack-"], [215, "STREETS, TYTHINGS, &C. 185 street was arched over in 1854 \u2014 until then it was an open sewer. Since the drainage works no sewage has been conveyed into it. Coxwell-street contains several quaint old houses, one opposite the Baptist Chapel, with J. P., 1640, over doorway, was the residence of Lawyer John Plot, who in the civil war sided with the Royalists but whose house was nevertheless pillaged by Rupert's soldiers, who carried away a large sum of money which he never recovered. Over the Flying Dutchman is date 1674. Another house, Messrs. Powell's Music Warehouse, refronted some twenty years since, has the letters R. E. E. 1676 over the entrance. There are others, including one at the back of Mrs. Willis's premises, but these have been sadly defaced. Thomas-street, so called from St. Thomas' Hospital, the Battle-street of the Court Rolls, and Batel-strete and Via Bellica of the Register, but why these warlike appellations is uncertain. Part of the old Monmouth-place remains at the Millbank corner. There is a date 1 6 \u2014 , with letters F. P. or B. over the entrance, but it is a re-erection of a much older building. Its history is not known. Possibly the original was the manor-house of William, the son of Baderon, whose son took the title of Monmouth, but whose descendants failed, 41 H. III. The successor to the estate was one of the free tenants named in the Jurors' Report, 4 H. IV. In Atkyns' time the present building extended to what is now the vicarage house (see Kip's drawing, 1712). The bridge at the foot of Cecily-hill is called Gunstoole ; until 1854 the stream was open and here was a watering place for horses. Another bridge is called Gildenebrigge in a register deed of 1317. Spitalgate used to lead directly from Dollar-street to the old Hospital gate where the Whiteway commenced, the present road for upwards of half a mile from the town having been constructed by the late Lord Carteret, and the old road taken into the Abbey estate. Gloucester, or St. Lawrence-street, extends to the bridge at the entrance to the town. The ward includes the adjacent courts, Factory Yard, St. Lawrence's Gardens, parts of Barton and Gooseacre-lanes. Barton-lane led to the Barton Grange of monastic times, now Barton House and Mills. Cecily-hill \u2014 \u25a0 Seynt Cecyly-street (the Inchstrope of the Court Rolls) \u2014 is named from the church of Saint Cecilia. The parish outside the old borough comprises the tythings of Chesterton, Sperringate, Barton, Oakley, and Wiggold. The two last named are situated at a considerable distance from the town, so that its modern extensions are entirely within the three former. Chesterton tything extends southwards from Lewis-lane and Querns-lane to the parishes of Siddington and Kemble (Wilts), and includes Watermoor, the Workhouse and gardens, the"], [216, "186 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. Pitacres, Cranhams, &c. The name, like Cirencester, is derived from the Saxon Ceastre. Much of the Roman town was situated within it, and there is a Roman station of the same name in Cambridgeshire. By the sale of the Watermoor Common in 1826, the earliest vent for the pent up population was afforded, and the older houses in Watermoor were built within the few succeeding years. The Pitacres estate was placed in the market nearly 30 years later, in 1861 the land between it and the Querns, and about a dozen years since, the plots near the Cranhams. Watermoor lies low, and was popularly supposed to be so called from its situation, but some years since a contributor to our local organ discovered that a family named \" de Mora \" resided at a mansion where the \" Goldsmid Arms \" stands, but which is marked \" Watermoor House\" on a map published as late as 1837, and it is asserted that the family first took their name from the marsh surrounding them, and that the district received its appellation second-hand from a member of the family, Walter de Mora. This is not improbably the correct derivation, but we are now more concerned with the present state of the locality, and may state that, although several feet below the centre of the town, Watermoor is not the damp place its name would suggest ; it has been efficiently drained, and the surface water is conveyed into the Churn, which here leaves the town and pursues its course towards Cricklade. A great improvement has lately been effected by the construction of the railway station and the new road to the end of Gas-lane. Muth, however, remains to be done, for there being no controlling authority when it was first built upon every man did what was right in his own eyes, and streets and buildings were laid out without any regard to convenience or symmetry. Of the streets the derivation of Gas and School-lanes is obvious. Stepstairs is so called because in the narrow way between stone walls, which was widened on the construction of the new railway, there were formerly steps for crossing the Roman wall. Chesterton Manor House stands at the corner of Quern's-lane and the Watermoor road. Earl Bathurst is the impropriator of the tithes (see Rudder). Sperringate tything adjoins Chesterton on the east, also Stratton, Baunton, Wiggold, and Preston, and includes the new part of the town known as the \" Nursery \" (called the Leauses by Stukely and Rudder), where most of the Roman remains have been found, the Beeches, Golden Farm, Kingshill, and the Abbey estate, with its ancient Hospitium and Almonry. Spyringate Grange was included in the grant to Richard Bassinge, 32 H. VIII., and the name occurs in certain of the Public Records of earlier date. The Beeches, adjoining the London-road outside the city wall, leads to the Golden Farm \u2014 a substantial gentleman's residence,"], [217, "jjRftgjggc Ptftc<*, Cu^'^^gc^i^ i*FgiQncia ft-H.1830, . \"Wbi'emaii&Bass T^otc-LitKo London"], [218, ""], [219, "STREETS, TYTHINGS, &C. 187 occupied by the late Sir Cecil Beadon and afterwards by Colonel Trotter \u2014 and thence to the New Mills and Kingshill, some high land towards Preston, from whence a good view of the town is obtained. The origin of its name and of Kingsmead, adjacent to the Cricklade-road, is not known. The Nursery was first offered for sale in building lots in 1853. For five or six years little was sold, but from then to 1870 houses went up rapidly. In that year the land on the east side of the New-road was mapped out in single house plots, but a lull had set in in building, and no lots were sold until 1878. Since that date the Upper School, and a street of 20 cottages, called Victoria street, have sprung up on this land. Of the other streets of the Nursery, Tower-street, so called from its pointing to the Church tower, was the first formed, the original intention being to extend it to Watermoor, but the land was purchased and enclosed with the estate now owned by H. Van Notten Pole, Esq. Corin-street and the New-road were formed in 1859 ; Chester street, named after T. W. Chester Master, Esq., to whose family the land belonged, and Church-street followed. The latter name is euphonious but, like Chester-crescent, not easy of explanation. Carpenter's-lane is an old road which terminated with a gate leading into the Nursery meadows, from whence a footpath, now stopped up, led to the Old Mills, near Mr. Darby's Nursery. These mills ceased to be used upwards of sixty years ago, but are said to have existed before those built by Abbot Blake. Kingshill Quarries provide the hard bluish stone known as Forest Marble, interspersed in some cases with beds of blue marl. St. John's Meadow, Shepherd's Piece, the Bowling-green and Bowling-green Pits, a series of mounds similar to those at the Querns, consisting of the debris of disused quarries, are in this tything. Barton tything stretches to Oakley tything, Kemble, Coates, and Stratton parishes. It was granted to Richard Berners . 36 H. VIII., and in Anne's reign was vested in Sir Richard Onslowe, Speaker of the House of Commons, who sold it to the first Lord Bathurst. The deer and home parks, the Royal Agricultural College, and College farm are in it. Oakley tything to the west of Barton, and extending to Sapperton and Duntisbourne, includes the remainder of Earl Bathurst's Park in Cirencester parish. Of this tything Domesday gives the following particulars : \u2014 \" Roger de Laci holds Achelie. There is one hide and a half. Leuuinus held it, now Girald holds it of Roger.

Mr. Talbot, Mr. Town send, Mr. Joseph Cripps, and Mr. Master succeeded them. The tithes of Wiggold, belonging formerly to the abbey of Cirencester, were granted to Thomas Erskyn, Viscount Fenton, 5 Jac, but T. W. C. Master, Esq., is the present impropriator. The tithe of hay, and all privy tithes, belong to the minister of the parish. Stratton parish, containing 1,320 acres, rateable value \u00a33,600, has a very irregular and straggling outline, which extends from Gloucester-street bridge, skirting the Park, nearly to Cathedral Firs in one direction, thence across the Gloucester and Cheltenham roads to the Churn at Baunton, which is its boundary, to the bridge again. The houses, however, are entirely situated on the two above main roads, and the \" streets \" Albion and Chester leading from them. Formerly the village was confined to a few houses round the church, but about sixty years since the land near the junction of the roads was offered for sale, and this was followed by the erection of several pleasant villas and smaller houses, mostly occupied by retired business people and others following their daily avocations in Cirencester. In 1878 the estate of the late Mr. James Pitt was brought into the market. Nearly thirty houses have since been erected, but we believe that a large portion is still for sale, eminently suited for the erection of superior residences. The church, dedicated to St. Peter, is a simple unpretentious structure without spire or tower ; it is in different styles of Gothic architecture, but little of the original building remains. A new aisle having been added to it about 40 years ago increased the accommodation to 300 sittings. A new organ was built in 1874, and other improvements recently effected. The Register dates from 1601. The living, valued in the Valor Ecc. at \u00a312 7s. 6d., is now worth \u00a3320 per annum. The Rev."], [221, "189 THE MANOR HOUSE AND PARK. T. Hannyngton Irving Child is incumbent, and Mr. Master patron, lord of the manor, and principal landowner. The schools were built in 1858 and enlarged in 1883. The name is derived from Straete \u2014 Saxon for street. There are several Strattons, one, Stratton St. Margaret, Wilts, being also situated on the Ermine way. A bush formerly in the common field near the Roman road was known as Crouthorne, and here the view of frankpledge was undoubtedly held for the hundred outside the town. There are no places of worship in Stratton besides the Parish Church. The annual club day is Whit Wednesday. The land is chiefly arable except on the banks of the Churn and Daglingworth streams. The mills were formerly worked by Mr. Joseph Cripps as clothing mills ; for some years for the manufacture of oil cake ; but now for corn and flour. There is a brewery, and some malting is done in the village. Major Chester Master lives at Stratton House. The geological formation near Cirencester is principally oolite limestone of a pale brownish hue, but many of the quarries contain the bluish stone known as forest marble. A very peculiar formation which extends more or less through the town from Burford to near Bath consists of a mixed loam to a depth of from 9\" to 24\" under which lies a stratum of rock in thin lamin\u00e6, rubbly or broken and mixed with light loam. This land, which would be naturally wet, has been rendered valuable farming land by drainage and the depasturage of sheep. On the banks of the river the soil is generally argillaceous. The town is well drained, there being a fall from Gloucester-street bridge to Watermoor of about twenty-five feet. THE MANOR HOUSE AND PARK. Cirencester Park, the seat of Earl Bathurst, which \"joins Cotswold Hills to Sapperton's fair dale,\" stretches from the town about five miles in a westerly direction, and for beauty as well as extent is almost unrivalled. The house stands on the site of an earlier one said to have been built nearly three centuries ago by Lord Danby, the son of Sir John Danvers, and founder of the Physic Garden at Oxford, which, with a small estate, was purchased in 1695 by Sir Benjamin Bathurst of Frances, widow of Lord Newburgh.1 Soon after Sir Benjamin's death, in 1704, 1 See Rudder. Rudder's statement seems scarcely to agree with the evidence given in 1603, at Devizes, respecting the estates of Sir Charles Danvers, another son of Sir John and ex M.P. for Cirencester, who had been convicted of treason and pardoned. Sir Charles Danvers was then stated to have become possessed of the house and estate at Cirencester long before his father's death, which took place in 1595. Either Henry Danvers (created Lord Danby), who succeeded Sir Charles, was not the builder of the manorial house, or else like Earl Bathurst he removed the former one to build another. The Manor House of the Danvers family is shown in Atkyns's History (1712), as Elizabethan in style."], [222, "190 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. his son Allen, the first Earl Bathurst, purchased two extensive contiguous estates of Sir Richard Onslowe and Sir Robert Atkyns, and then pulled down the old mansion and erected the present one, which was subsequently enlarged by the addition of the end wings. The park has arrived at its present state of perfection by the growth of the plantations, and by frequent improvements, but its design and main features are due to the labour and genius of the first Earl, which were justly the admiration of his time, and were celebrated by his friend Pope in the following couplet :\u2014 ' ' Who then shall grace, or who improve the soil ? \" Who plants like Bathurst, and who builds like Boyle ? \" Pope, during the space of a quarter of a century, paid many visits to Cirencester, and spent much of his leisure luxuriating in the solitary beauty of Oakley woods, having free license from his lordship to come at any time. From the published correspondence of the peer and the poet, it would appear that a house on the estate was provided for his sole use, and his appreciation of the kindness and hospitality of his host is constantly expressed. In one letter, dated October 8, 1735, he writes that \"he always found Cirencester a place of rest where his heart was at ease.\" Popular tradition asserts that many of his poems were composed in the little building known as \" Pope's Seat.\" Probably this is correct, but there is no mention of it in the correspondence. The \" wood house \" or \" house in the wood \" (of which see further on) is, however, constantly referred to, and it seems clear from the following extract from a letter of Bishop Atterbury to him, that he was its designer, \" May my lord have as much satisfaction in building the house in the wood, and in using it when built, as you had in designing it.\" Some lovers of the picturesque may object to the laying out of the park, as being too artificial, but if so, it should be remembered that the style of landscape gardening which adopts nature as its guide was then little understood or appreciated, and further that both systems have equal merit ; and we do not. hesitate to assert that that which has been chosen is the more suitable for an estate of its extent, gently undulating throughout, and yet almost destitute of abrupt differences in level. Pimbury Park, however, an addition to the estate within the last half century, is noted for its lovely wildness, and Cirencester Park, although laid out on a symmetrical plan, is free from stiffness. Nothing can exceed in grandeur the vista known as the Broad Ride, stretching, with an average width of fifty yards, for five miles, a length unequalled by any in the kingdom, and yet so broken up that the eye, instead of being wearied, is ever delighted by its continually changing character. From the gates on Cecily-hill for a short distance it is enclosed on the south side only, the high land above Stratton appearing on the right ; then for two-thirds of a mile it is flanked on either side by an"], [223, "191 THE MANOR HOUSE AND PARK. avenue of chestnut trees, with plantations of stately beech and other trees in the background. During this part of its length it is crossed by the Windsor walk leading from the Hexagon to the Tetbury-road, and by two minor cross walks joining the South terrace and Serpentine. At the end of the chestnuts are two stone pillars, to which formerly gates were attached, but which have been removed for many years. The ride is then crossed by another walk, and the gravelled central drive ceases. A few yards further, Queen Anne's monument is seen across the Deer park, with the Royal Agricultural College and Wiltshire Hills in the distance. Glancing back along the ride a good view is obtained of Cecily-hill and the Church tower, the latter appearing at the summit of each ascent for nearly four miles. Proceeding onwards, amidst some of the finest trees on the estate, the \" Seven Rides \" are reached, Pope's Seat occupying the place of the eighth, the one opposite pointing to Kemble spire, and others to Queen Anne, Coates tower (the parish which gives birth to Father Thames), and to the Cathedral Firs. From hence the ride is unenclosed save by distant plantations and by a few trees at irregular intervals, to preserve its continuity until Oakley Woods are reached. Along this part the eye is arrested by three battlemented houses on the right, for persons employed on the estate, called the Round and Square Towers, and the Lodge, or \" Ivy House.\" Near this building a precipitous descent is made through the underwood into a deep gorge known as \" Haines' Ash,\" which winds through the park amidst lovely foliage for about two miles. Carriages take a circuitous course between the \" rough hills \" of upwards of half a mile, and enter the ride again at Oakley Woods. These woods comprise upwards of two square miles, and were a royal hunting ground in the reigns of the Norman kings.1 Pursuing his course through them the Horse Guards are reached, little buildings in the Italian style, best appreciated in a thunderstorm, and then the \" Ten Rides,\" which branch out from a central grass plateau, and form one of the most attractive features in the Park. The main ride looks back on the distant tower, and proceeding forward soon emerges from the woods into Sapperton parish, crosses a wild heath through the lodge gates, and terminates with an avenue of trees beyond the park limits. The transverse ride by a skilful cutting away of the trees in Hailey Wood on the south, and its apparent termination at some far distant trees on the north, appears of even greater length than the main ride. The other avenues derive their beauty chiefly from their trees and wild brackens ; one points to Coates tower ; another exhibits the blue hills embowered with the beechen foliage, and looks exceedingly pretty; another points to the old Market Cross, removed from the town just a century ago, and from which eight miniature drives diverge ; one leads to the \" Wood House,\""], [224, "192 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. as it is still generally called. The visitor to this pretty castel lated ruin must be informed that it lays claim to the more ambitious name of Alfred's Hall, and then he may picture the good king on this very spot joining with the Danish chieftain in the celebrated treaty recorded on p. 16 of this work, and 200 years later restoring the ancient edifice to its pristine splendor. This is positively asserted, and as a proof we can only point him to the Latin inscription over the entrance doorway inside the hall, and to a stone over the chimney piece behind, on which is inscribed : \u2014 IN. MEM. ALFREDI REL REZTAVR ANO. DO. 1085- But if our friend is indisposed to accept this explanation of the origin of these interesting remains, perhaps he will accept as authentic the correspondence of Pope and his friends, from which we learn that there stood in the midst of Oakley wood from time immemorial a little cottage with a charming little \" bower,\" and \" on every side the impervious forest,\" and this secluded habitation was occupied in 1718, not by fairies who are credited with an attachment to the \" cool grot and mossy cell,\" the water fall and limpid stream \u2014 and Oakley woods possess neither \u2014 but by \" the old woman of the pheasantry.\" Five years later the old lady's quiet is disturbed by contemplated \" alterations of the Wood House,\" and these, if commenced then, lasted some time, for in July, 1732, the new building was only \"almost finished,\" but in the following year the top stone had been laid, for then Mrs. Pendarves wrote to Swift that Earl Bathurst \" had greatly improved the Wood House, which you may remember but a cottage, not a bit better than an Irish cabin. It is now a venerable castle, and has been taken- by an antiquarian for one of King Arthur's, ' with thicket overgrown, grotesque, and wild.' \" The same learned gentleman, we presume, who having expressed to the \" old woman \" his surprise at its great antiquity, received the ready reply, \"Oh, this is nothing, for my lord intends building one 200 years older shortly.\" It is needless to say that this truly original occupant of the place has long since gone to that bourne where no traveller returns, but her successors are always ready to attend to the requirements of the numerous parties who, through the kindness of his lordship, visit this delightful spot during the summer months. And it is fair to add that this license is thoroughly appreciated, and we hear of no instances of damage to shrubs, leaving broken bottles behind, &c, such as are not unfrequently seen at tourists' resorts. The Banqueting Hall can be had by previous arrange ment at the Steward's office, and if not engaged the spacious lawn and shady recesses are free to all. Before quitting the spot we must not forget the well (nearly a hundred feet deep),"], [225, "THE MANOR HOUSE AND PARK. 193 the peacocks, and the sun dial. The absence of the \" crystal rivulet to purl through the shades \" of the wood, Pope's friend, the author of \" Black-eyed Susan,\" promised to make good in his poems. For a week each season Oakley and Hailey Woods are thrown open for nutting, an enjoyment which the young people of Cirencester have participated in for generations, and alluded to by the first earl in 1730. From the four-mile lodge on the Stroud Road is a nice green drive amongst the oldest trees in the forest, called Oak Valley. Overley Wood on the north-west has some pleasant walks, and Cathedral Firs, in the form of a Latin cross, the longer arm being 360 feet in length, is well worthy of a visit. The old road from Cirencester to Bisley passes by them to Park Corner, and until 1814 the Stroud-road emerged from it near the Round House, and crossing the main ride, then separated the home and lodge parks. It joined the present road near the extremity of the Deer Park. In this park, which is enclosed with a high wall on one side and a deep fosse round the remainder, there are several hundred of these beautiful creatures. Queen Anne's statue, a colossal figure on a plain Tuscan column, fifty feet high, stands near the centre. The Kennels, erected for the Vale of White Horse Foxhounds in 1837, are situated in the Deer Park, also the Archery and Cricket House. The latter game is played during the season every evening, and many interesting matches between the town, Royal Agricultural College, and principal clubs in Gloucestershire and the adjacent district. Archery and lawn tennis meetings are occasionally held, attended by the elite of the neighbourhood. The Rifle Range, from the Kennels to the wood known as the Roundabouts, is 1,000 yards in length. The Windsor walk separates the Deer from the present Home Park. Within it, besides the Mansion, are Grismund's Tower, or the Ice House ; the Horse Temple, containing a figure popularly known as \" Mad Tom,\" but in reality a statue of Agamemnon ; and the Lake or Fishpond, an artificial body of water eleven acres in extent, formed about 1735. The surface is graced by several beautiful swans and other water fowl, and when Jack Frost has asserted his rights, by birds of different plumage, who are attracted in great numbers, and in some instances appear as much at ease on the frozen mass as their aquatic friends in their natural element. The North and South Terrace and the Serpentine, which pursues its course through the woods for more than a mile, are pleasant walks. The entrance to the mansion from the town is through a lofty arched rustic gateway. It has large handsome frontages east and west, the latter commanding an extensive view of the Home and Deer Parks, and contains many spacious and lofty apartments, but externally is not possessed of striking architectural features. In the hall are four beautiful African marble Corinthian columns, surmounted by busts of Lords Liverpool and Castlereagh, the 3rd"], [226, "194 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. Earl Bathurst, and William Pitt, whose portrait also occupies the north end, opposite to which is a splendid full size equestrian portrait of the Duke of Wellington, by Sir Thomas Lawrence, the horse being a faithful representation of his favourite charger, Copenhagen, and the hat, cloak, &c, those used by him at Waterloo. The head of Agamemnon in Parian marble is by Rosalindi. The billiard room contains whole length portraits of the first Earl, his Countess, and the second Earl. In the drawing room the Battle of Waterloo, by Penningham, a present from the Duke of Wellington ; and, amongst other pictures, a portrait of the late Lady Georgina Bathurst, as a child, in the act of prayer, by Beechey. In the dining room are several interesting portraits, including those of Kings Charles the first and second, a fine head of the Duke of Bedford, by Sir Peter Lely ; also, by the same artist, the Members of the celebrated Cabal. There are numerous other paintings in the various rooms, chiefly portraits of members of the family, and of distinguished personages, including works of Sir Joshua Reynolds and Sir Thomas Lawrence. Representations of Venus, Apollo, and Hercules, in chiaro-oscuro, by Sir Godfrey Kneller, call for special attention as works of one of the greatest artists of his time. They were presented by Pope to the first Earl, whose portrait is hung in the library. POPULATION. The number of inhabitants in Corinium cannot be arrived at with any degree of certainty. Judging by the space occupied and the probable density of population, it is doubtful whether at its period of greatest importance it exceeded modern Cirencester, although it may have had twice or thrice the number. The estimate on page 152 is probably fully equal to the population at the end of the Saxon regime. In 1377, according to Professor Thorold Rogers, London contained only 35,000 inhabitants, York 11,000, and Bristol 9,500, and, insignificant as Cirencester may appear now, compared with our modern centres of wealth and industry, it would then with its present population have been the fourth in size in the kingdom. Colchester, then the tenth place, had about 4,400 ; and Cirencester in 1400, if we may consider the 400 townsmen armed by the mayor as the number of its male householders, at least half that number. In \" a particular relation of the action before Cyrencester,\" 1642-3, it is desoribed as a town of many streets and 2,000 communicants. It is very doubtful whether there are that number now, but, rightly or wrongly, in those days all the adults from sixteen upwards would be expected to become Church members, so that if this number be correct the total population may be taken as about 3,500. Sir R. Atkyns, nearly 70 years later, states that there were \" near 800 houses and about 4,000 inhabitants in the parish,\""], [227, "J, BcrdiHiii, Dell PJWEIfcTiTirj1 m&MJ\u00b1\u00a3s CIRENCESTER .

This says something for vaccination. In the following table Stratton is included Since 1881 there has been an increase of nearly 100 houses in the town and Stratton. The Union district in 1881, comprising 85,000 acres, contained 4,540 houses and 21,310 people. The Town Commissioners' district in 1871 contained 980 houses and 4,685 people. The Local Board enlarged district in 1881 con tained 1,467 houses and 7,703 people. The sanitary measures of the present generation have greatly improved the health of the town. In 1870, in consequence of a succession of hot dry seasons the water level had fallen unusually low, and the sewage matter, then deposited in cesspools, which had percolated through the soil, was retained, resulting, especially in Gloucester-street, in a severe outbreak of typhoid. By the recent sewerage works this could not recur, so that the town was never more healthy than during the late hot dry summer of 1884. In 1811, out of 948 families in Cirencester, 21 8 per cent. were employed in agriculture; 55'5 per cent, were employed in trade and handicrafts. In 1821, 12-6 in the former and 67-8 in the latter. In 1831, when the clothing trade, &c, was declining in the west, 133 and 49-3 respectively.

The introduction of steam power having centralized manufac tures in the Northern and Midland coal districts, which have increased at a rate heretofore unprecedented, Cirencester has lost its former industries, and yet, as will be seen by a reference to the table of population, it has steadily increased in numbers and prosperity. This is owing in great measure to its having possessed for many years superior railway accommodation, the presence of a wealthy residential population, the Royal Agricul tural College, and good markets, and thus it has retained its position as capital of East Gloucestershire, and is the principal dep6t for its articles of consumption. It has undoubtedly suffered somewhat from the agricultural depression of the last few years, but it is to be hoped that the day may not be far distant when, by a succession of good seasons, and by a solution of the difficulties besetting the question, the land may again be brought into a profitable state of cultivation. Possibly electrical agency may bring back to our rural districts and small towns some of the industries of which steam has deprived them, but, without cherishing ideas that may be considered Utopian, we think that Cirencester is eminently fitted to carry on upon a larger scale than now some industries, such as the manufacture of the lighter kinds of agricultural implements. Some trade is done, we hope to see more. The establishment of a County School for farmers' sons, as an independent institution, or by the development of the Upper School and the extension of the R. A. College, we may yet hope to see accomplished. But failing these, it is evident that the continued prosperity of Cirencester must largely depend upon the tradesmen continuing to keep ample and well assorted goods, and supplying them at reasonable prices. This has been the secret, we believe, of the success of Cirencester tradesmen in the past ; few towns are better stocked with provisions ; but the system of long credit militates against young tradesmen of moderate capital. At present wool stapling and wool sorting,"], [232, "198 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. formerly its principal trade, is carried on by two firms. The manufactures are unimportant ; we may notice, however, that of flocks at the \" New Mills,\" of \u00e6rated waters by Mr. W. Griffiths, and others, and of sulphate of ammonia at the Gas Works. Of course there is a brewery, and until the death of Mr. E. Bowly, in 1882, there were two. Messrs. Cripps and Co., of the Ciren cester Brewery, do a large trade, principally local ; they purchased the Cotswold Brewery (Mr. Bowly's) soon after his death. It is now converted into the town Waterworks. Equally gratifying to the teetotaller is the fact that the Temperance Hall stands on the site of a brewery which existed until forty years ago. Mr. Woodman has a brewery at Stratton, and there is some malting done in the town. In reference to the early history of Cirencester trade, it is admitted that the Saxons in Britain during the time of their later kings were expert in dressing and spinning flax, in making jewellery, and some minor industries, and that they exported a large quantity of wool to Flanders which was exchanged for manufactured woollen goods, &c. It is also certain that Cirencester had its weekly market before the compilation of the Domesday Book, and a grant or confirmation of a previous grant of fairs for eight days before the feast of All Saints by King John in 1216, and that these rights to fairs and markets were confirmed by King Henry III. in 1243 and 1248, so that there is good reason for the conjecture that in the early Plantagenet, if not in the Saxon reigns, the wool of the Cotswold sheep was brought to Cirencester and sold to home and foreign traders. But leaving the region of conjecture, we learn from Madox's Ferma Burgi, p. 273, that in 13)6 (9 E. II.) several merchants of Amiens, by name Giles Beaupigne, Henry Beaupigne, John de Sancto Finciano, and Robert, his brother, settled at Cirencester, unquestionably as dealers in wool, and not as manufacturers, for until the year 1331 there appears to have been no attempt to manufacture cloth or woollen goods in England, but in that year Edward III. wisely invited weavers, dyers, and fullers from Flanders to settle in England, and promised them franchises and protection for their trade. John Kempe was the first to accept the invitation, and he came over with his goods and chattels, servants and appren tices. Many of his countrymen followed, and it is certain that, although it took a long time for home manufacturers to supplant foreign imports, yet that within a very few years the clothing trade had been established at Cirencester, and that both weaving and dyeing were largely carried on. There were many engaged in the clothing business in the succeeding century, and in 1535 Leland, referring to the two \" Fulling Mills \" erected by Abbot Blake, at a cost of 700 marks = \u00a3466 13s. 4d., writes \" They be wonderfully necessary by cause the town standith alle by clothing.\""], [233, "TRADE AND MANUFACTURES. 199 But to return to the wool trade. The legislation of the 13th and 14th centuries is remarkable for the vexatious restrictions put upon merchandise. This was principally effected by means of the staple by which all the staple goods produced in England, of which wool was by far the greatest, were to be taken to one or a certain number of places for sale. The first order extant was in 1313, which compelled English exported goods to be taken to Antwerp. This was rescinded in 1326, and the staple removed from the Continent to certain places in England. In 1328, the staple was abolished, and freedom of commerce everywhere established, but in 1332 the staple is again fixed at certain towns in the kingdom (Cirencester probably being one). In 1334, the policy of 1329 was reverted to, and in 1341, according to the Nones Taxation, there were established in the county of Gloucester who paid the tax : \u2014 Three foreign merchants in Tewkesbury, whose goods and chattels were assessed at \u00a34 ; in Stow, foreign merchants ditto, at \u00a326 6s. 8d. ; in Cirencester, six ditto, at \u00a3111 16s. 8d., besides four wealthy ditto untaxed, who had lost their property, but who had been assessed at \u00a3466 13s. 4d., or a total for the whole town of \u00a3578 10s.1 These figures show that the Stow and Tewkesbury trades were insignificant compared with Cirencester. We learn also from the following note given in the Nones Record at the foot of the particulars of the six taxed merchants, that the merchants established in Cirencester as early as 1341 included manufacturers as well as wool dealers, one being a dyer, and that the trade of Cirencester was then a matter of such national notoriety as to require an explanation as to why the assessment was only \u00a3111 16s. 8d., an amount, be it remembered, representing a large sum now-a-days. The note is as follows : \u2014 \" And there are not any other merchants who live of their merchandize to be taxed in Cirencester, because John Meys, Peter de Derham, and Nicholas Coysfeste, merchants, were robbed of their merchandize, goods, and chattels, to the value of 500 marks, at Southampton. And also on the sea at that time, when the foreigners robbed and set fire to the town of Southampton aforesaid. And further, because the King took from Richard the Dyer his wool at Cirencester, to the value of 200 marks, for which cause he has nothing in merchandize.\"2 In 1341, the staple was re-established at Bruges, in Flanders, and in 1348, after its capture, it was transferred to Calais, but in 1353, when the famous Ordinance of the Staples was passed, the staple for wool, leather, woolfels, and lead was removed from the Continent, and fixed at Newcastle, York, Lincoln, Norwich, 1 So far as the necessaries of life are concerned, worth \u00a320,000 in present money. 2 The king in 1338 seized all the tin and wool produced in the kingdom that year, to carry on a useless war with France."], [234, "200 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. Westminster, Canterbury, Chichester (, Cirencester), Exeter, Bristol, and C\u00e6rmarthen\u2014 -for ever \u2014 which, as it turned out, meant only ten years, for in 1363 it was again removed to Calais, to be refixed in 1369 at the same English towns as before, except that Hull, Boston, Yarmouth, and Queenburgh were substituted for York, Lincoln, Norwich, and Canterbury. In 1376 it was restored to Calais, on the people of that place complaining that the trade was declining, and this fickle legislation which rendered (as has been remarked by Macpherson) \" the condition of our merchants of staple goods in those days truly pitiable \" went on. In 1390, the English towns of 1353 regained their staples for a year, but from 1398 until 1558 Calais has been stated to have been the only staple, the English ones being disallowed, except that Henry IV, in 1404, in consideration of the services of the townsmen, granted them a court of staple for merchandise. We are inclined to think that as there was such an enormous quantity of wool in the town in 1341, and should have been more, that Cirencester must have been one of the towns thus favoured in 1328 and 1332, and that it is meant (and not Chichester) in 1353. If so, it was renewed to it in 1369 and 1390. However this may have been, the charter of 1404, which enacted in it the only staple in England, was abrogated in 1413, and the future history of English trade is one of fewer attempts to advance the welfare of particular favoured places by special enactments to the detriment of the mass of the people. The Court Rolls of the 16th century all testify to the importance of the town, and by the numerous inns to the numbers coming to it ; they likewise refer to its trade in leather. Daniel Defoe writes, about 1 700 \u2014 \" Cirencester is still a very good town, populous and rich, full of clothiers, and driving a great trade in wool. The vast quantities sold here are almost incredible. The wool is bought up here chiefly by the clothiers of Wilts and Gloucestershire for the supply of that great clothing trade which I have mentioned already. They talk of 5000 packs a year.\" Atkyns (1712) confirms this, stating that the wool market was then held on Friday in the Boothall, and was the largest in England ; and Rudder, in 1800, says that in this build ing there \" were large rooms to stow the wool, of which, within memory, vast quantities out of Bucks, Berks, Northampton, and Oxfordshires were brought weekly, and the principal street was so thronged with wool waggons about forty years ago that it was difficult for other carriages to pass, but the wool dealers travelling the country, and buying that commodity at farm houses soon reduced the market to a mere nullity, and there has been none sold here for many years.\" The wool market has never been re-established \u2014 the spinning of yarn and wool-combing having practically ceased since the beginning of the century, but until recently there were to be seen"], [235, "201 FAIRS AND MARKETS. in the garret walls of some old houses vestiges of the openings into the combers' wool-lofts. The manufacture of frame-work knitting, started by the trustees of Mrs. Powell's will nearly 150 years ago, which, after a languishing existence of half a century, was, in Rudder's time, fairly prosperous, also disappeared with the introduction of steam machinery, as likewise those of cloth and woollen goods, consist ing of harrateens, moreens, and light stuffs, of girth webs, garterings and bindings, and of millers' bolting clcths. The carpet inanufactury, conducted by Messrs. Kendall and Bullock in 1789, and subsequently by Mr. Silk at the building in Gloucester-street, now known as the Factory, was closed in 1836, when many of the operatives removed to Kidderminster and other towns. FAIRS, MARKETS, &c. The earliest mention of a market at Cirencester is in the Domesday Book (1086), from which we glean that the King received 20s. per annum from the townsmen for \" the new market,\" of which the Collegiate Church received one third of the tolls. According to Henry I.'s Charter this same market was \" held on Sunday in the several streets,\" and the right to hold it was confirmed by Henry III. and IV. At the hundred rolls inquisition taken by order of Edward I., on his accession, it was deposed that the Earl of Gloucester prevented his vassals at Fairford paying toll for merchandise offered in Cirencester market, and that for seven years before the merchants and burgesses of Bristol had withdrawn their customary payment of tolls. Leland (1535) writes that \" Cirencester hath the most celebrate market in al that quarter on Monday,\" and enumerates besides it only Bristol, Gloucester, and Tewkesbury as the market towns of the county. In 1800 Cirencester market was general for corn and all commodities, and was \" then thought to equal at least, and by some to second that of Gloucester, nothwithstanding its advantages from the navigation of the Severn,\"1 and it is still esteemed as the next to the county capital for agriculturists, corn merchants, and cattle dealers. A fair quantity of eggs, butter, and poultry are brought to the town and sold in the butter market, but the prevailing practice of sending these articles by carriers on Monday and Friday for sale by the shop keepers, and the establishment of monthly sheep and cattle markets, has made the ordinary weekly market appear far less busy than in many other towns where much less business is done, but where stalls are pitched for the sale of minor articles. In Rudder's time both Monday's and Friday's markets were 1 Rudder."], [236, "202 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. well stocked with provisions. On the latter day the weekly wool market had been held, and was, in the former half of last century, considered the largest in England, but when Rudder penned his history the custom of the wool merchants calling and purchasing from the farmers at their farms had caused this market to fall into disuse. The sheep market, which is held on the first Monday in each month, and in six months of the year on the third Monday like wise, is esteemed one of the largest in the West of England. A large number of pigs and cattle are also sold. The August and September markets or fairs as they are called are the largest, and are attended by numerous purchasers from all parts of the country \u2014 the Continent and America \u2014 principally for the purchase of Cotswold breeding rams. It has been decided this year to continue the fair for the sale of these rams on the Tuesday or day following. The Easter Monday fair has declined of recent years. The \" All Hallowe'en,\" locally known as the \" Holland \" fair, on the Monday preceding old All Hallow Day, is a relic of the eight days' fair licensed by King John. On this day it has been the custom for the tradesmen in the neighbouring villages to settle their accounts. The \" statutes \" or mops for hiring farm and domestic servants, which are well attended, occur on the Monday before and after October 11th, and if the day fall on Monday there are three mops. The two ancient cloth fairs mentioned in the Magna Britannia (1720), as then held, were discontinued not long after. ROADS. The following main roads start from Cirencester : \u2014 1. To Gloucester \u2014 the Ermine way north \u2014 remarkable for being almost straight, regardless of hills and valleys, to Birdlip \u2014 10 miles \u2014 whence it descends 900 feet into the Severn Vale, and commands an extensive view of the Forest of Dean, May Hill, the Malvern Hills, and Welsh Mountains. There are two good Inns with pleasure gardens, which are much visited in the summer months. 2. To Cheltenham, opened in 1827, passing along the beautiful Churn Valley past Rendcombe Park to the Seven Springs \u2014 the source of the Churn, and thence, for upwards of a mile, down Charlton Hill to Cheltenham. The old road led from Birdlip, past Leckhampton Hill. 3. The Whiteway, which connected the town with the Roman stations of Worcester, Droitwich, &c. It is now little frequented. About 2|- miles distant it is crossed by the Welsh man's lane, so called because the dealers from the principality drove their black cattle along it in considerable numbers, and"], [237, "ROADS. 203 escaped the turnpikes, but this custom has been discontinued for upwards of twenty years. 4. The road to Stow and Campden \u2014 the ancient Fosse way to Leicester. The Roman Villa at Chedworth lies in a secluded valley to the left, seven miles from Cirencester. 5. To Burford, Oxford, and London, corresponding with the Ikenield way for upwards of a mile from the junction with the Fosse, but the most frequented road, and that formerly taken by the Oxford and London coaches is 6. The road through Fairford and Lechlade. 7. The Ermine Street (south) \u2014 to Cricklade and Swindon. 8. The road to Wootton Bassett, constructed 50 George III. 9. The road to Bath and Bristol, coinciding for upwards of four miles with the Acman Street, which thence is for miles a grass grown lane \u2014 the old coach road leading through Tetbury and Badminton. 10. The road to Malmesbury and Chippenham, also leaving the Acman Street near its junction with the former road. 1 1 . The road to Stroud, which formerly led from Cecily Hill along the Farm Road for 1-| miles. Here the Farm Road led past Park Corner to Bisley, and the old Stroud road crossed the Park, and united with the present road near the second milestone. The portion of the existing road from this point to the octagon gate was constructed in 1814, and the steep descent at Killdevil1 Hill ceased in 1859. All the roads were very badly kept until last century, when the turnpikes (now being removed) were first erected under special Acts of Parliament, a complete list of which for the Cirencester District may be obtained from the published records of the House of Commons \u2014 the earliest Act being that for the improvement of the London Road from Cirencester to St. John's Bridge, Lechlade, in 1726. Before this it was often impassable, and it took three days under favourable circumstances, for the mail coach to reach the Metropolis. This coach was run as early as 1698. The road gradually improving, \"an enterprising person set up a stage coach to ply from Cirencester to the Metropolis in two days,\" and not long afterwards it performed the journey in one day of twenty hours, and becoming very famous, obtained the name of the \"Cirencester Flying Coach.\" In the winter months it took two days, and was said \" not to fly,\" and this state of things continued until about 1770. In 1800, the journey was performed by the old mail coach in fourteen, and by the ordinary coaches in sixteen hours, and just before the opening of the Great Western Railway, in eleven hours. At that time several coaches plyed regularly from London to Oxford, through Cirencester to Stroud, Tetbury, Bath, and Bristol, and after the completion of 1 It has been suggested that the correct name should be Kildever, but the name and derivation are uncertain. CC"], [238, "HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. 204 the railway to Steventon, Berks, and the subsequent extension to Cirencester, several extra special coaches were run through and from this town to Gloucester, Cheltenham, &c, for passengers to those places and South Wales. Heavy goods from London were principally brought to the town by Tanner and Bayliss's fly waggons, two of which started from their warehouses at Cirencester and Rodborough every night, reaching London in two days. One of these waggons is repre sented in some fine old views of London, published in 1825. THE THAMES AND SEVERN CANAL. A project for joining England's principal rivers was mooted nearly 200 years ago, but although not entirely abandoned, it remained in abeyance until 1775, when an Act was procured for the Stroudwater Canal, eight miles in length, to connect Stroud with the Severn at Framilode, and this work having been completed, another Act was passed in 1783 to complete the scheme, by joining the Thames at Lechlade, and constructing a branch to Cirencester. The work was commenced forthwith, under the superintendence of Mr. Whitworth, C.E., but it took more than six years to pierce the famous Sapperton tunnel, which is cut through the solid rock for 3808 yards, or nearly 1\\ miles, the deepest shaft measuring 270 feet from the ground surface. For many years this tunnel was the longest in England, but is now exceeded by the railway and canal tunnels between Diggle and Marsden, near Huddersfield, and by the Severn tunnel. From the summit level, which extends from Cirencester nine and half miles, through the tunnel, to Daneway lock, the canal falls to the Thames 130'6\", and to the junction with the Stroudwater Canal at Wallbridge 241'3\", thence to the Severn 102'5\", or a total of 343'8\". The pumping engine at Thames Head, when in full work, raises over a million gallons daily, and through it, the feeder at Cirencester, and the springs at Siddington, a large quantity of water is continually withdrawn from the Thames watershed, the number of locks and traffic to the Severn being much greater. The estimated cost of \u00a3130,000 was much exceeded. The traffic increased to 1840, but since, through the opening of the Great Western Railway, has greatly fallen off. In 1869 and 1882, bills were introduced for the partial conversion of the canal into a railway ; the former was thrown out by the Lords, the latter received the conditional support of the Board of Trade, the option of purchase, coupled with the obligation to keep the canal open for navigation, being offered to the opposing companies, and accepted by the Great Western Railway Company. In its time the canal was of great service, and heavy goods"], [239, "205 RAILWAYS. were brought by it from Gloucester, Birmingham, and the Midlands. It is amusing to read the opposition offered to it and the arguments its promoters had to devise to overcome the prejudices of our legislators a century ago. For instance, the Newcastle miners objected to a supply of coals to London from Monmouthshire by inland navigation, not because their trade might suffer but because they feared that the coasting trade would be affected \" as a nursery \"of seamen for the navy,\" and this plea was then considered as \" calculated to bring over all sides of a ' fighting ' House of Commons on the first view.\" The promoters, too, chiefly desired the canal to establish a ready communication with Staffordshire, \" where most of the cannons and castings for the Navy and Army are run, and whose growth of timber is known to be very great, so as to diminish the expense of rebuilding our ships of war.\" THE RAILWAYS. In 1836 an Act was passed, entitled \" An Act for making a Railway from Cheltenham and Gloucester to join the Great Western Railway near Swindon, to be called the Cheltenham and Great Western Union Railway, with a branch to Cirencester.\" Mr. I. K. Brunei was the engineer for this line, which, between Swindon and Gloucester, is now the G.W.R. main line to South Wales. The Act of 1836 was amended in 1838, and the line, as far as Cirencester, opened May 31st, 1841, which was for some years the terminal station to Gloucester and Cheltenham, in consequence of the delay in completing the line, resulting from the large outlay in constructing the tunnel at Sapperton. The company experienced much opposition from the promoters of a rival scheme for a line from Cheltenham through Oxford, to unite with the London and Birmingham at Tring, Herts. The passenger station at Cirencester was formerly roofed over, but was altered as at present about a dozen years since. It is a substantial structure with pleasing gothic fronted residence for the station master, but of no striking architectural pretensions. The new station, however, of the junction at Kemble is a highly creditable work, and has been executed with regard to the most modern improvements in station architecture. The goods station and yard are in Sheep-street \u2014 the latter was enlarged about 20 years since by taking in an osier bed bounded by an unsightly stone wall on the street side, but the present coal space is again considered inadequate. The line now known as \" The Midland and South Western Junction,\" which was opened to Cirencester December 18, 1883, has been designed to connect Southampton, Portsmouth, and places on the South Coast with the Northern and Midland districts. As long since as 1845, powers were sought for a"], [240, "206 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. similar line, with the ambitious title of the \" Manchester and Southampton Railway,\" which was planned to follow the same general route as the line now in progress, viz., to start with a junction with the South Western at Andover, to pass through Marlborough, Swindon, and Cirencester, and to join the Bristol and Birmingham at Cheltenham. This scheme, which was abandoned in 1847, differed from the present only in taking the course of the Churn Valley, between Cirencester and Cheltenham, instead of the more elevated route past Chedworth to the Banbury and Cheltenham line at Andoversford. It is to be hoped that the remainder of the railway may be soon completed, when it will become an important through line northwards, either by the Midland line direct or by the London and North Western from Birmingham, and thus avoid the annoyance experienced at Gloucester. The first section of the line was that known as the Swindon, Marlborough, and Andover, opened in 1875. The Act of 1881 provided for the extension to Cheltenham, with a branch from Cirencester to join the East Gloucestershire at Fairford, and thereby the London and North Western at Oxford. In 1882, a Bill was introduced for the conversion of part of the canal into a railway, to leave the authorised line at Siddington and to join the Midland at Nails worth, the object being to establish, in connection with the \" West of England and South Wales \" railway, proposed the same year, a new route to South Wales, but this was abandoned upon the G.W.R. agreeing to purchase the canal and to construct a line to Tetbury. In the following year, powers were sought for a line with the same object, also to leave the new railway at Siddington, thence to run over a portion of the Cirencester branch (G.W.R), which was to be made a double line, and to join the G.W.R. main line near Kemble, with running powers to Stroud and Stonehouse, where a junction was to be made with the Midland. Sanction was obtained on the understanding that the G.W.R. should have running powers over the intended line to Fairford, and that the engineers of the two companies should arrange the exact route. In consequence of this decision, the new company propose to abandon the running powers to Stonehouse, and to obtain release from their obligation to construct the Fairford line, the traffic over which would have certainly been monopolised by the G.W.R. by their possession of the line to Oxford. The present name was allowed by the Act of 1884, which amalgamated the Swindon, Marlborough, and Andover and the Swindon and Cheltenham Extension Railway Companies. In the summer months cheap tickets are issued between Ciren cester and Marlborough, enabling the residents in each to enjoy the rival beauties of Oakley Park and Savernake Forest, and several excursions are run to Southampton, Portsmouth, and the Isle of Wight."], [241, "PAET VII. THE ROYAL AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE. The Royal Agricultural College, which has now attained an eminent position amongst our national institutions, owes its origin to an address on the \" Advantages of a Specific Education for Agricultural Pursuits,\" delivered November 14, 1842, by a highly respected townsman \u2014 the late Mr. Robert Jeffreys Brown, to the Fairford and Cirencester Farmers' Club. In this address Mr. Brown eloquently insisted upon \u2014 1. The necessity and advantages of education. 2. Its inefficiency in England as compared with some other countries. 3. Advantages of Agricultural education. 4. Existing continental institutions for practical and scientific Agriculture. 5. Necessity of a similar institution for England. In consequence of this address, the said Farmers' Club, on the 29th of the following month, issued a report suggesting the establishment of a College for 200 pupils, with a farm of 500 acres attached, on a central part of the Cotswold Hills; the pupils \" to employ one portion of their time in the Schools and another in the cultivation of the farm.\" The College was proposed to be built and started by the issue of a certain number of \u00a325 shares, and the very moderate sum of \u00a325 to \u00a330 per annum was estimated as an equivalent for the board and education of the students ! Shortly after, Mr. Brown and several local gentlemen, including Earls Bathurst and Ducie and Edward Holland, Esq., M.P., attended the meeting of the Royal Agricultural Society at Southampton, and obtained the hearty and cordial support of the Duke of Richmond, Earl Spencer, and several men of leading position. From that time the object became one of general interest, and through the untiring energy of Mr. Brown, backed by Earl Ducie and other gentlemen, a great number of peers, M.P.s, merchants, bankers, and manufac turers, were added to the list of subscribers, prominent amongst whom, besides those already mentioned, were the Dukes of Cambridge, Bedford, Buccleuch, Cleveland, and Grafton ; the Marquises of Devonshire, Exeter, Lansdowne, and Northampton ;"], [242, "208 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. Earls Radnor, Fitzhardinge, St. Germans, Granville, &c. ; Lords John Russell, Villiers, Sudeley, de Mauley, &c. ; Sir John Guise, Sir M. Hicks Beach, Sir T. D. Acland, Messrs. Sidney Herbert, M.P, C. S. Lefevre, M.P., &c. H.R.H. the Prince Consort consented to be patron. The meeting for the inauguration of the institution on the basis suggested in the report of the committee of the Farmers' Club, was held April 22, 1847, and at a meeting on the following 1st of July, Earl Bathurst and Mr. Holland were provisionally chosen president and vice-president ; other officers were appointed, and an arrangement was entered into with his lordship for a lease of one of his farms. Earl Bathurst also advanced \u00a32000 at interest towards the erection of farm buildings. The royal charter of incorporation was obtained March 27th, 1845, and this conferred upon the proposed institution the title of \"The Royal Agricultural College for teaching the science of agriculture, and the various sciences connected therewith, and practical application thereof to the cultivation of the soil, and in the rearing and management of stock.\" The charter further constituted the association of governors or proprietors and donors into a corporate body, and vested its management in a council consisting of the president, vice-president, and secretary pro tern., and of others elected from the governors and proprietors. A governor, as defined by the deed of settlement, being a holder of five or more shares of \u00a330 each ; a proprietor, of less than five shares ; and a donor, a contributor of \u00a330 towards the institution. The donors were not to be eligible for election on the council, but could attend the general meetings of the associated members. The capital of the association was to be \u00a312,000, in four hundred shares, with power to increase the same to \u00a324,000, and to declare a dividend not exceeding four per cent. Pupils were to be admitted from fourteen years of age, and religious worship daily observed according to the rites of the Church of England, provision being made for Nonconformists or others objecting to attend on conscientious grounds. The College buildings were forthwith started, from the designs of Mr. Daukes, architect, of London, and pending their completion, two houses were rented in Thomas-street to avoid delay in commencing the collegiate course. In these the work of the institution was inaugurated in September, 1845, with twenty five pupils, under Mr. Scales, of Norfolk, who united the offices of Principal and Professor of Agriculture, and was assisted by Mr. Way as Professor of Chemistry, afterwards the well-known chemist of the Royal Agricultural Society ; Mr. Woodward, afterwards Professor of Natural History at the British Museum ; Mr. Robinson, Professor of Veterinary Surgery ; and the late Mr. Bravender, of Cirencester, Civil Engineering and Surveying. The Collegiate buildings being sufficiently advanced were opened April 30, 1846, and in the following June one hundred"], [243, "209 THE ROY.AL AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE. students received instruction within them. Like most new and experimental institutions, its early career was a chequered one. At the close of 1846, Mr. Scales resigned, and was succeeded by the Rev. G. C. Hodgkinson, who was assisted in the management of the farm by Mr. Thomas Arkell, of Pen Hill. This arrange ment, however, was not satisfactory, and lasted only about six months, for although Mr. Arkell vastly improved the farm, and received the thanks of the Council for his valuable services, Mr. Hodgkinson did not possess sufficient practical knowledge of agriculture. Mr. Wilson was then appointed, as Mr. Scales had been before, Principal and Professor of Agriculture, with three assistant Professors. During this time the College had been incurring liabilities ; \u00a330 per annum was soon found to be thoroughly inadequate even for farmers' sons (and the age of admission then was as low as fourteen), so the terms were raised to \u00a350. Still the College and farm did not pay, and it was thought that the collegiate system, with its schools of science, would have to be relinquished, and a school for farmers' sons substituted. Under these circumstances, Mr. Wilson and his staff of Professors resigned. The cloud which then (1848) overshadowed it was, however, removed by the magnanimous conduct of Mr. Holland, who undertook to pay the whole of the existent liabilities, to defray the cost of the completion of the buildings, and to carry on the institution, provided that possession and sole control were vested in him until the amount advanced should be repaid. Subsequently, the responsibility was shared by the late Earls Bathurst and Ducie, and Messrs. J. H. Langston, M.P., and Sotheron Estcourt, M.P. The Rev. J. S. Haygarth was then entrusted by them with the entire management, and, after a careful investigation, he arrived at the well founded conclusion that the schools of science should be retained in all their efficiency. Mr. Haygarth's views were endorsed by the Council, the Professors were re-engaged, and thus the flow of students, which had waned in consequence of the belief that the College would close at the end of 1849, gradually returned. Mr. Haygarth held the office of Principal until his death in 1859, and with the assistance of the late Dr. Voelcker (Professor of Chemistry), the late Professor Buckman (Botany and Geology), Mr. Brown (Veterinary Professor;, and others, conducted the College with great success, the students averaging about 90, the terms then being \u00a340 per annum for non-resident students and \u00a380 for students in the College. Mr. Haygarth was succeeded by the Rev. John Constable, M.A., of St. John's College, Cambridge, now rector of Marston Bigot, Somerset, who held the appointment for upwards of twenty years. Some amount of dissatisfaction was exhibited by the Professors and others with the early regime of this gentleman, who from a lengthened friendship had become warmly attached"], [244, "210 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. to the former Principal. Unfortunately this personal feeling led to the resignation of most of the professors in 1862, and to a large reduction in the number of students. But Mr. Constable's plans received the warm approbation of the Council, and by his undoubted ability, untiring energy and devotion, combined with the assistance of well chosen lieutenants, the College at his retirement had not only regained its former number of students, but had reached a pitch of excellence hitherto unequalled. Mr. Constable's arduous labours being a greater strain than his health would permit, necessitated his retirement from his position and acceptance, as rector of Marston Bigot, of a lighter sphere of duty. His successor, the Rev. J. B. McClellan, has now under his control the best academy for the study of Agricultural Science in the world, and he has not only kept up the efficiency of the former course of instruction, but has extended the schools for science to embrace a larger number of subjects. The students in attendance exceed one hundred, and large numbers have been refused in consequence of want of room, although the terms for indoor students have been raised to \u00a3150 per annum. The present course of instruction embraces Agriculture ; Agricultural Law; Chemistry, including practical work in the laboratory ; Mathematics, Book-keeping, Engineering, Surveying, &c. ; Physics ; Botany, Geology, &c. ; Drawing ; Veterinary Surgery, Pathology, Therapeutics ; Practical Carpentry, Lathe and Smith Work, Saddlery and Harness Work. Special lectures are delivered by certain of the former Professors, who now fill honorary Professors' chairs, and by able and well-known scientific people, prominent among whom have been the late Professors Voelcker and Buckman, Professors Brown and Coleman, Miss Eleanor A. Ormerod, consulting entomologist to the Royal Agricultural Society, &c, &c. The College Diploma is presented to those who evince sufficient proficiency, likewise certain Scholarships, and the Gold Medal to the most successful man in each term. The minimum of age for admission is seventeen, but many of the out-students have been through a previous course at our National Universities, and the Calcutta University presents to its alumni two Scholarships of \u00a3200 per annum, each tenable for three years at the College, but these gentlemen do not compete for the College honours. The Collegiate buildings stand on the site of the old farm buildings of what is now the College farm. They command an extensive view over North Wilts, with a principal fagade facing south, having an extreme length of 270 feet. On the ground floor are the entrance hall and staircase, dining hall, 70 feet by 26 feet, library and reading room, professors' rooms, and a number of students' studies, which, with the theatre, laboratory, gymnasium, chapel, &c, enclose a quadrangle.

Four of the spaces are occupied with the Apostles' Creed, Commandments and Lord's Prayer ; the remainder are intended for tablets or inscriptions to the memory of the founders of the College, or other gentlemen who have been especially instrumental in promoting its interest.

CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS, ENDOWED SCHOOLS, &c. THE FREE GRAMMAR SCHOOL. The Master of the Schools (p. 59) was an officer of the Convent, whose duty chiefly consisted in instructing the novices. Possibly a favoured few of the young townsfolk participated in his teaching, but the town does not appear to have possessed a distinct seminary until about 1460, when John Chedworth, Bishop of Lincoln (p. 134), founded the Grammar School, and endowed it with \u00a310 per annum, then a goodly sum. About 1508, Ruthall, Bishop of Durham, increased the income by \u00a37, but both these amounts were absorbed amongst the chantry properties seized by Henry VIII. Complaint of this having been made, the King's Commissioners for the settlement of schools, in 1548, restored Ruthall's bequest, and in 1573, Thomas Helme, the head master, after much trouble, obtained a further annual grant of \u00a313, thus more than making up for Chedworth's gift, and these two sums have ever since been paid out of the land revenues of the Crown.1 John Jones, of Duntesbourn, by his will dated August 12, 1508, gave six houses for mass to be repeated for his soul for 60 years, then to be charitably applied, and \u00a38 to be paid yearly to the master of the Grammar School.

It has ceased to be a school house since 1881, in consequence of the Education scheme sanctioned by Her Majesty, November, 1876, by which on the death of the Grammar School master, the endowment of the Grammar School was to become part of the Upper School funds. All Grammar School boys must share in the regret that it was found necessary to dissolve it, but the new institution seems designed to carry out the objects of the old foundation with increased efficiency. Amongst the more distinguished scholars educated in the Grammar School were William Cartwright, the poet ; Caleb Hillier Parry, father of the celebrated arctic explorer ; the Rev. James Dallaway, afterwards of Trinity College, Cambridge, author of \" Constantinople, Ancient and Modern,\" and of other works ; and Dr. Jenner, the celebrated discoverer of vaccination. The master was at first appointed by feoffees, but at the election of 1761, the friends of one candidate succeeded in ejecting the old master, and obtained the appointment of the Rev. Dr. Washbourn through the Lord Chancellor, in whose successors the presentation was subsequently vested. Dr. Washbourn conducted the school successfully for the earlier part of his mastership, but for several years prior to his death in 1802 received the emolu ments without a single pupil. Rudder, who mentions this, attempts no explanation, and it is out of our power to give any, but the holders of sinecure offices were not then \" rar\u00e6 aves in terra,\" and even as recently as 1868, when the Inspectors appointed by Parliament visited the foundation schools, many similar cases were found to exist. For instance, one master who had no scholars for years, and had turned the school into a stable, coolly informed the Inspector that he did not want any. The report for Cirencester was fair, and it was placed in the second class of Gloucestershire schools, those in the first class being the Cathedral schools of Gloucester and Bristol, and the Grammar schools of Cheltenham and Chipping Campden, but its position at that time was not so good as it had been some few years before, when it averaged about thirty day pupils and twenty boarders. The masters after Dr. Washbourn were the Revs. \u2014 Grooby, E. Wood, and W. Bartram, M.A., of Magdalen Hall, Oxford. Mr. Bartram became assistant master in 1846, and was appointed head master a few years later, on Mr. Wood's retire ment ; he officiated for some time as curate of Watermoor Church after its erection, and in addition to his mastership held the 1 Prime Minister and Lord High Treasurer to James I. His care of the public exchequer did not extend to matters where his personal interest was concerned, as he amassed a large fortune by grants and purchases of crown lands at nominal charges."], [251, "THE UPPER SCHOOL. 215 living of Shorncote from 1863, and from 1866 the chaplaincy of the Union. His death took place November 7th, 1880. The subjects taught by him were Latin and Greek (free to all boys of the town), History, Geography, Mathematics, &c, &c, five guineas per annum, with extra charges for French and Drawing by competent masters. Many of his scholars are now occupying good positions in life. The old clock, which was placed over the fireplace, was presented by the \" Cirencester Society in London \" about the middle of last century \u2014 round the dial were inscribed the words \" Dona pr\u00e6sentis rape l\u00e6tus hor\u00e6,\" i.e., \" joyfully seize the gifts of the present hour.\" This excellent motto was adopted by the school, and was thenceforth stamped on the boys' prizes. THE UPPER SCHOOL. Although the Grammar School and Powell's Schools were visited in 1868 by a Parliamentary Commission, no scheme for their reconstruction was prepared by the Commissioners appointed under the Endowed Schools Act (1869), but after the powers had lapsed to the Charity Commissioners the trustees of Powell's Schools applied for powers to utilise their funds to meet the requirements of the Elementary Education Act (1870). Objection having been made that the Powell endowment of about \u00a31000 per annum was too much to be spent in Cirencester solely on elementary education, and that it simply reduced the legitimate rates which should be levied for this object, it was ordered that a portion of the funds should be devoted to the formation of an Upper or Middle Class School, to be supplemented with the Grammar School endowments on the mastership becoming vacant. In consequence of this, the Upper School, which is an elegant erection in the Elizabethan style, in the New Road, with large playground, was completed and opened in 1881. It has three scholarships of \u00a310 per annum each, tenable for three years, and competed for solely by boys educated in the Elementary (Powell's and Board) Schools of the town. The Rev. G. R. Faulkner, M.A., of Christ's College, Cambridge, is principal, and is assisted by competent masters ; the terms are \u00a36 per annum, and the course of instruction includes the usual school subjects comprised in an English education \u2014 Latin, French, elementary nicathematics, natural science, chemistry, drawing, vocal music, scripture, history, and religious instruction according to the tenets of the Church of England, exception being made in favour of persons objecting on grounds of conscience. The management is vested in governors, as follows : \u2014 Two ex-officio governors, the Lord of the Manor and the Principal of the Royal Agricultural College ; six repre sentative governors, two elected by the Vicar and Churchwardens of Cirencester, two by the Justices of the Peace for the Petty"], [252, "216 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. Sessional Division of Cirencester, one by the Cirencester Local Board, and one by the School Board of Cirencester; and three cooptative governors. The present governors consist of the following : \u2014 The Right Hon. Earl Bathurst, Thomas William Chester Master, Esq., Frederick Cripps, Esq., The Venerable Archdeacon Hayward (Vicar of Cirencester), Thomas William Chester Master, jun., Esq., M.P., The Rev. the Principal of the Royal Agricultural College, Joseph Sewell, Esq., Henry Zachary, Esq., Mr. Henry Tovey, and Mr. Robert Fryer Darby. Whether the Charity Commissioners' scheme is the best in all its details that could have been devised, its future history must decide, but the instruction given reflects the greatest credit upon the head master, and many of the lads have distinguished them selves in the University local and other examinations. THE POWELL ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS are named after the lady and her husband to whose munificent bequests they have been chiefly indebted for their support. The schools in Gloucester-street and at Watermoor receive the benefits of this endowment. The latter were built about thirty years since for girls and infants residing at that end of the town, and the Gloucester-street schools included the Blue and Yellow Schools for educating, clothing, and apprenticing a limited number of children ; the Quarterly School, so-called on account of the quarterly payments received before it was allowed to participate in the Powell endowment, and an Infant School. Free education for many years prior to the introduction of the scheme of 1876, was given in all \u2014 the clothing and education were abolished at the same time, and the present schools built and opened in 1879, the old schools being converted into dwellings for the master and mistress. The Infant School, erected by the Hon. William Lennox, afterwards 5th Earl Bathurst, in 1863, is still retained as a school. The children receiving instruction at all these schools average about 750, in addition to nearly 400 at the new Board Schools, erected in 1879 from the designs of the late Mr. C. N. Tripp, of Gloucester. At the opening of the Board Schools the British School in Sheep-street, and Infant School, conducted by the \" Friends,\" in Thomas-street, were closed. The dress worn in the Blue and Yellow Schools was similar in character to that of most of the charity schools founded in London and elsewhere in the 17th and early part of last century. In the Blue School twenty boys and twenty girls were admitted for three years, and in the Yellow, forty boys and twenty girls, or one hundred in all, selected from the Quarterly School. The boys' dress consisted of a complete suit \u2014 cap, brass-buttoned coat, vest, knee breeches, and stockings, of uniform colour, with leather buckled shoes ; the girls, of dresses and tippets, and bonnets trimmed with ribbons of the"], [253, "217 THE POWELL ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. respective colours, and on high days frilled Norman caps in lieu of the bonnets. Each child had a new suit at Whitsuntide, and a few of the lads the privilege of remaining a fourth year, with cloth jacket suit. The Blue School was started in 1714 with monies given by the inhabitants of the town, to teach children to read, but Thomas Powell and James Sewell were the original promoters, having given \u00a350 in 1701, dependent upon contingent contribu tions. In the year 1718 Thomas Powell endowed it with \u00a315 a year, part of an annuity for 99 years, paid out of the Exchequer ; and a moiety of the profits of Maskelyne's Ham, in Cricklade. And the Court of Chancery, in the year 1737, appropriated \u00a320 a year, out of the estates bequeathed to Mrs. Powell for erecting and endowing a charity school or schools in this parish, for the support of this school; and in 1744, appointed the produce of \u00a3562 7s. 6d. to be paid yearly for the benefit of this school, as a provisional supply, after the expiiration of the annuity out of the Exchequer. The Yellow School was erected and endowed by virtue of the will of Mrs. Rebecca Powell, dated September 17, 1722, who, after bequeathing certain legacies to her late husband's relative, Robert George, devised unto Charles Coxe and the Rev. Joseph Harrison (Vicar of Cirencester), and their successors, in trust, the rest of her real and personal estate, to be by them applied in erecting, endowing, and establishing a charity school, or schools, in Cirencester, under such regulations and provisions as should seem \"most expedient to the honour of God, the service of religion, and the temporal and eternal welfare of the poor,\" except some small sums, amounting to about \u00a311 per annum, payable to the almswomen in Lewis lane, and a further sum of \u00a310 yearly to the vicar for catechising and expounding the Church Catechism on Sundays, between October 18 and February 25 yearly, \" for the better propagation of Christian knowledge and the training up of the children in the teaching of the Established Church.\" By a suit in Chancery against Robert George, the trustees obtained, in 1725, an order confirming the will, and a decree for the better carrying out its intentions ; but fresh difficulties arising, a second application was made, and after a delay of several years, Mr. Thurston, a master in Chancery, made his report in 1737, which was confirmed by the Court, and continued in force until 1816. The conditions of Mr. Thurston's report were : \u2014 (1) That a house and furniture suitable for the board and lodging of a master, mistress, and twenty boys be obtained in the town, at the cost of about \u00a31000, with the object of maintaining, clothing, educating in reading, writing, and casting up accounts, and bringing up the lads to learn the art of weaving worsted stockings, and at the expiration of their term setting each up in business with worsted and frame, not"], [254, "218 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. exceeding \u00a35 in value, the said boy to take an apprentice from the parish workhouse, and to enter into a bond not to sell his frame nor leave the town for seven years, the profits earned in the school to be devoted to the extension of the objects of the charity, viz., the establishment in Cirencester of a manufacture of worsted stockings. (2) The clothing and education of twenty girls of the town, who were to be taught to spin. (3) The governorship to be invested in trustees, viz., the lord of the manor, the members for the borough, the vicar, churchwardens, and two chief constables of the town for the time being. After deducting the costs of the award aud an unpaid legacy, there remained about \u00a34,400 personal estate, \u00a31,000 of which was ordered to be spent as aforesaid, and the balance was estimated, with an income derived from real property of \u00a3226, to produce \u00a3345 per annum for the school, after deducting the payment to the minister for catechising. The school was opened in accordance with this scheme in 1740, and the profits earned from thence until 1774, when the master died, amounted to nearly \u00a31,200, and averaged for the last eight years upwards of \u00a3100 a year. During this period the rents of the real property somewhat increased, but from some unexplainable causes the value of the personal estate was less than thirty-four years previously, notwithstanding the earnings of the boys. The town naturally was dissatisfied with the management, and the two masters who were next appointed did not improve the institution, the goods being much complained of and the earnings less than with the former master. In 1788 Mr. Webb was appointed master, and Rudder, writing twelve years later, states that under him the manufacture had been brought into the greatest credit and the income considerably improved, but the boys in the house were reduced, the remaining half being clothed and educated, but not maintained. In 1814, by a decree of the Court of Chancery, at the instance of certain petitioners, it was ordered that a Master of the Court should inquire into the charity with the object of framing a scheme of more general benefit. He made his report in 1816 to the effect that the charity had failed to establish in the town a manufacture of worsted stockings, &c, and th.it it was no longer desirable to continue the prosecution of that object ; that it owned estates in Cirencester and the neighbouring parishes which produced in 1815 \u00a3628 per annum, but which, it was apprehended, must be reduced ; that the personal estate consisted, besides the school buildings, household furniture ;md working implements, of \u00a34,016 17s. lid. three per cent, consols, producing \u00a3120 9s. 9d. per annum. With these funds it was decided to retain the house, buildings, and premises in Gloucester-street as a school house, to clothe and educate forty boys and twenty girls in reading, writing, and arithmetic, the girls being also instructed in plain needle work and knitting,"], [255, "219 CHARITIES. and according to the teaching of the Church of England, and after payment of the teachers' salaries and all other necessary outgoings the residue to be applied to apprenticing poor boys. This ceased with the new scheme. CHARITIES. The remaining charities of Cirencester are numerous. In the following particulars of them Rudder has been revised, and compared with the Charity Commissioners' Reports, and the several benefactions placed as in his work under the following heads : \u2014 (1) For augmenting the Benefice, repairing and orna menting the Church, reading prayers, sermons, &c. (2) Gifts to Nonconformist Chapels. (3) Hospitals and Almshouses. (4) Gifts to the Poor. For Augmenting the Benefice, &c. The particulars given under this head are mostly written on two large boards, which until 1865 were placed against the wall of the south aisle, on either side of the great western window, but which are now in the Town Hall. They have been copied by Rudder, and from his history by subsequent writers. Dr. William Clarke, formerly Dean of Winchester, having devised certain lands and tithes in the parish of Tillingham, Essex, in trust among other things to augment ten small ecclesi astical benefices with \u00a330 per annum each for ever; and Dr. Henry Compton, Bishop of London, and the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's, having the nomination of six of those benefices, declared they would assign this charity to such market-towns as would settle an equal revenue on their minister. And the inhabitants of the town of Cirencester, with the assistance of others, having raised the sum of \u00a3619 11s. 8d. by free contri bution, and with \u00a3600 of the said money purchased can annuity for their minister of \u00a330 a-year, charged on the tithing of Oakley, in this parish; the said trustees then appointed Ciren cester to be one of those benefices so to be augmented, by an instrument dated January 17th, 1698. Concerning this bequest, Rudder writes a century later : \u2014 \" But by a deficiency in the profits of the trust estate, from inundations and other accidents, the annual payments to the respective ministers, from the first commencement in 1699, have sometimes fallen under, though sometimes exceeded, \u00a315 a-year.\" The surplus of the money (\u00a319 11s. 8d.) was given to the minister towards defraying his expenses in settling the augmentation. The principal contributors to this laudable benefaction were Sir Robert Atkyns, jun., knight, who gave \u00a3100; Thomas Master, Esq., \u00a3100; Mrs. Bridget Smith, a daughter of Sir William Master, knight, \u00a3100; Mrs. Winifred Master, \u00a350 ; Mrs. Anne Williams, \u00a343 ; Sir Benjamin ee"], [256, "220 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. Bathurst, knight, \u00a320 ; Sir Jonathan Raymond, knight, \u00a320 ; Sir Richard Onslow, baronet, \u00a310; Sir Richard Howe, baronet, \u00a310; John Willet, clothier, \u00a320 ; Bernard Ballinger, \u00a320 ; John Coxe, clerk, rector of North Cerney, \u00a310 ; Ralph Willet, clerk, rector of Stratton, \u00a310; Robert Brereton, gent., \u00a310; other contributions were from \u00a35 to 10s. each. The purchases of the former and present vicarage houses are referred to on page 136. The present vicarage, which has been unoccupied by Mr. Hayward in consequence of its inconvenience and inadequacy, is being thoroughly remodelled and enlarged at an outlay, with the purchase of the adjoining house, of \u00a32,800. Of this sum \u00a3300 has been granted from the Warneford Trust; \u00a3250 from the Vicar's Dilapidation Fund ; and \u00a31000 is derived from Queen Anne's Bounty, repayable, principal and interest, by the Vicar at \u00a370 per annum ; the remainder has to be raised by the contributions of friends and parishioners. To the Church, &c. The special gifts to the Church recorded by Rudder are recounted in Part II. For the gas, cleaning, heating, and maintenance of the services and edifice, organist, &c, there is a revenue arising from a close in Chesterton tything and the rents of houses chiefly in the town, the gifts of John Jones and others whose names have not been handed down; these amounted, in Rudder's time, to \u00a367 9s. 4d., and are now augmented by increased pew rents and the offertory collections at the Sunday services, but the total income has, until lately, been found barely adequate to meet all requirements. Sir Benjamin Bathurst and his grandson \u2014 the second Earl \u2014 in conjunction with Thomas Master, Esq., each presented a fire engine to the town, and a third was purchased by the inhabitants. For Sermons, Prayers, Catechising, &c. In 1587, Philip Marner gave 6s. 8d. for ever, for a sermon on the first Friday in clear Lent. 1607. Sir Giles Fettiplace gave an annuity of 20s. out of lands in Eastington ; half for a sermon on the 5th of November, and half for ringing on the same day, and for mending the ropes. John Coxwell, Esq., gave 20s. a year for two sermons in Christmas tide and Lent. 1618. Jeffry Bath, who had been bailiff of the town, gave 6s. 8d. for a sermon on Ascension-day. 1637. Sir Thomas Roe, of Cranford, in Middlesex, gave \u00a32 for a sermon or prayers on the 1 3th of September, for ever. 1639. George Monox, Esq., gave \u00a38 per annum for a sermon on the first Wednesday in every month."], [257, "221 CHARITIES. 1681. Mrs. Mapson, a native of the town, gave 10s. for a sermon on St. Andrew's day. 1695. John Master, M.D., gave \u00a3200, one half of the income of which to the minister for ever, for reading morning prayers ; the other half to poor house-keepers not receiving alms. Mrs. Rebecca Powell gave \u00a310 a year to the minister, for catechising the children, and for expounding the catechism ; and \u00a32 a year to provide candles necessary for that serviee. Mrs. Hannah Ashwell gave \u00a310, the interest whereof for a sermon on the 30th of January for ever ; but the principal money is now lost. She also gave \u00a310 more, the interest whereof to be divided between the minister and parish clerk, for a psalm, with Gloria Patri, to be sung every Monday at morning prayers. Nicholas Edwards gave to the minister the interest of \u00a35 for ever. The gifts of T. Master, Hannah Ashwell, and some others, were expended in the purchase of \u00a3400 three per cent, consols, producing \u00a312 per annum, of which \u00a35 15s. is paid to the minister. The sum of \u00a3134 18s. 2d. three per cents., producing \u00a34 Is. per annum, is the bequest of Robert Timbrell, Esq., J. P., a resident in Cirencester in Rudder's time, for sermon by the minister and bread to the poor attending it. Upon the retirement of the Rev. Canon Powell in 1869, after thirty years ministry, a fund was started under the designation of \" The Powell Memorial Fund,\" with the object of increasing the endowment of the Vicarage. The sum of \u00a3250 having been raised was invested in Consols and produces \u00a37 10s. per annum, which the Vicar receives, but it is hoped that this small amount may become the nucleus of a sum worthy of the object for which it was started. To Nonconformist Churches. Jane Overbury, by her will, dated November 18, 1772, gave \u00a3150, the interest of \u00a3100 to be settled upon the minister of the Particular Baptist Church worshipping in Coxwell Street Chapel, and the remaining \u00a350 to such poor members of the congregation as the minister should think fit. The principal is invested in 3J per cents. Catherine Stevens, by her will, dated June 22, 1815, also left \u00a3450 stock in three per cent, consols, to provide \u00a312 per annum for the minister of Coxwell Street Chapel, the overplus to be divided between the poor members at Christmas annually, but to pay the legacy duty and power of attorney, amounting to \u00a328, it was found necessary to sell out \u00a350 stock, so that the interest on the remaining \u00a3400 only is paid to the minister. Elizabeth Gurney, the first person interred in the burying ground attached to the Gosditch Street Chapel, who died in 1750, and Benjamin Gurney, who died in 1768, each left a sum of"], [258, "222 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. money, together amounting to \u00a370, to be invested for the benefit of the minister and poor of the members of the Church worshipping there. The Hospital of St. John According to Leland, this Hospital (or Almshouse) was founded by Henry I., who likewise built the Abbey Church. But the remains of the hospital building now standing, consisting of two open arcades, with high pointed arches springing from short round cushion capitalled columns, belong to the transition period from Norman to Early English architecture, in the latter part of the 12th century, and it has therefore been suggested that Leland has been wrongly copied,1 and that the second Henry is intended. This is probably the case, as he also contri buted largely to the monastery, and was twice at least in the town towards the close of his reign.2 The arches, which were thrown open in 1883, were until then enclosed within the walls of tenements erected at some period since the suppression of the monasteries as dwellings for the participants of the charity, but for 76 years prior to their removal let at low rentals; they were chiefly entered from a dark passage called the Paen, or Pean, which led between the arches. There is a blocked up three light window in one of the arcades, and during the removal of the cottages there were unearthed a monumental stone incised with a cusped cross, and another with an inscription which appeared to be intended for \" low cujas anime propitietur deus amen.\" On a broken fragment of stone was inscribed \" Augu ,\" in Roman characters. Thomas Cobham, Bishop of Worcester 1317-27, granted permission for service to be held in the hospital, and there was a bell, probably the service bell, which remained hanging in it until a little more than a century ago, when it was sold by Mr. Thomas Bush, who in 1740 had surreptitiously obtained a grant of the mastership under the Privy Seal. After his death a caveat was entered against any subsequent appointments, and in 1786 the mastership reverted to the minister, churchwardens, and overseers, in whom it had been vested by a decree in Chancery 6 Charles II., and with whom it still continues. By the charter 17 Ed. III., the abbot and convent were confirmed as the custodians. 1 See report of the meeting of the Bristol and Gloucestershire Arch\u00e6o logical Society at Cirencester, 1884, in Wilts and Gloucestershire Standard. The statement made at that meeting, however, that the date given by Rudder for the erection of the Abbey is incorrect, is incorrect itself. Rudder's date, 1117, does not depend upon Leland only, but upon several early writers, including Florence of Worcester, who brings down his history to the following year, and died soon after, and their testimony is conclusively confirmed by the charter of foundation. The Abbey was certainly founded by the first Henry, the Hospital probably by the second Henry. 2 See page 21."], [259, "CHARITIES. 223 In 1792 the old tenements having fallen into a bad state, it was determined by the trustees to borrow sufficient to build six new cottages on the hospital land adjoining. \u00a3250 was borrowed, and in 1807, after the debt had been paid off, these were devoted to the alms people. The Charity Commission Report (1843) gives the following return of its revenue : \u2014 Thirty-one houses in the town of Ciren cester and 48a. Or. 14p. of land, yielding \u00a364 6s. 4d. ; average of fines for a renewal of lifeholds, \u00a320 ; personal property, \u00a3200 value, producing per annum, \u00a36 ; total, \u00a390 6s. 4d. Out of the charity eight poor alms women each live rent free, and receive 3s. 6d. per week. The suggestion of Rudder that St. John's Hospital is one of the three parish churches mentioned by Leland needs no refutation. St. Laurence's Hospital. This was founded by Edith Bisset (see page 91) about 600 years ago, but in 1343 the mastership was granted to the Abbot and Convent and their successors, and has been for many years held by the Bathurst family. Earl Bathurst is the present governor, and the grants of leases, &c, run in the name of the \" governor and sisters of the hospital of St. Laurence.\" As previously stated, the hospital was originally a church, and was standing in Leland's time. On the site are now three cottages, two erected probably when the ancient building was removed, and the third by the second Earl Bathurst out of the monies raised by fines for the renewal of the leases of lands and houses appertaining to the charity. Each cottage is occupied by a widowed sister, who receives a money allowance in addition. A survey of the property belonging to this charity in 1722 showed that it then possessed twenty-one houses and two gardens in Cirencester, and about fourteen acres of land in this and the adjoining parishes, producing reserved rents of \u00a310 7s. per annum. In 1800 these amounted to \u00a318 13s., but in the Charity Commissioners' Report, 1843, the possessions then consisting of twenty-five houses and twenty-three acres of land, produced only \u00a315 6s. In addition to these rentals it was in receipt of \u00a33 9s. 3d. interest on \u00a3116 3s. lOd. three per cent, consols, purchased in 1821 from two fines of \u00a350 and \u00a330, with interest to date, so that the total income in 1843 was \u00a318 15s. 3d. St. Thomas's Hospital. This building, situate in Thomas street, and better known as the Weavers' Hall, is supposed to be the original one built by Sir William Nottingham, Attorney General to Edward IV., and a native of this town, who by his will dated September 1st, 1483, did direct that lands, tenements, &c, belonging to him in Down Ampney, Cirencester, and Stratton, in the county of Gloucester,"], [260, "224 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. and Shorncote, Wilts, should be conveyed to certain persons, to be held by them in trust for the benefit of four poor men, dwelling in a home which he had erected for them in Battle street. He further directed that after his decease the inmates should receive 8d. per week each, making a total of \u00a36 18s. 8d. per annum, and that they should be selected by the master and wardens of the Weavers' Company. Sir William Nottingham, who acquired great wealth and distinction, belonged to a family of clothiers long settled in Cirencester. The Weavers' guild had probably been established here almost from the introduction of the clothing business more than a century earlier, and in the Charter of the Weavers' Company, February 18, 1566, are particulars of its ancient customs and constitutions, as confirmed by Elizabeth and her immediate predecessor. This charter is given at length in Rudder's Cirencester, pp. 164-170. The principal provisions were that two of \" the most discretest and wisest men of the mysterie of weavers \" should be \"frelie chosen and appoynted among themselves to be masters and wardens of the said occupation.\" That the annual meeting for this purpose should be on the eve of \" St. Katheryne,\" when the accounts should be read &c, &c, and all members of the craft summoned to attend under a penalty. Then follow the usual regulations as to taking apprentices, their conduct, and treatment, setting up \" lombes,\" and sundry regulations cunningly devised by our forefathers for the protection of their trade, but which experience has shown only succeeded in fettering business, and preventing the extension of commerce. The weaving trade has long ceased in Cirencester, but the wardens still continue to meet once a-year. Four poor men participate in the endowment, which at some time, but when is not known, was converted into a rent charge of \u00a36 18s. 8d., payable out of an estate at Berkeley. Two men only are inmates of the house, and these each receive 7s. 2d. per quarter; the two out pensioners 10s. 2d. each. The repairs of the house are provided for partly by fees upon admission into the company, and partly out of the rent of a portion of the hall. Almshouses. In 1620 Mrs. Elizabeth Bridges gave an almshouse in Dollar street \u2014 known as Hodden House \u2014 for six poor widows, and one shilling a-piece weekly for ever, payable out of land known as Hicks Leaze, the surplus rent of which is handed to the treasurer of the Blue School. The house being very much out of repair was taken down in the beginning of the present century, and the site granted to the late Mr. John Wilkins, who in return built the six tenements in Querns lane which the widows now occupy. The houses are kept in repair by the minister and churchwardens, in whom the management of the charity is vested. The \u00a315 12s. per annum paid to the widows is the entire income."], [261, "CHARITIES. 225 In 1702, William George and Rebecca his wife gave six tenements in Lewis-lane, with gardens adjoining, for the habita tion of six poor widows, and assigned the rent of two other houses in Cricklade street for repairs, and to provide \u00a36 yearly for the purchase of garments for the widows. Thomas Powell gave a moiety of the rent of Maskelyne's Ham, Cricklade, which was afterwards commuted by an annual payment of \u00a35 out of the Blue School funds ; and Mrs. Rebecca Powell by her will ordered the further pa}rment of twenty shillings a-piece yearly to the said widows for firing, which sum, amounting to \u00a36, is paid out of the Yellow School endowment. The houses bequeathed by the founders being in a ruinous condition, were taken down upwards of fifty years ago, and the present plain but substantial ones erected on their site. These almshouses were re-endowed in 1874 by William Lennox, 5th Earl Bathurst, in memory of his sister, the Lady Georgina L. Bathurst. According to Rudder, John Morse gave two dwellings in Gloucester street for two poor widows. In 1826, Mr. Christopher Bowly erected eight almshouses adjoining the Watermoor road, and in 1837 endowed them. They are occupied by deserving persons of slender means, irrespective of creed or denomination. See Trust Deed, Chancery Close Rolls, 92, 19 and 20, A.D. 1837. Gifts to the Poor in Money. In 1587, Philip Marner gave \u00a320 to be lent to four young tradesmen without interest, and in 1613 Henry Hill gave \u00a330 for a like object. The same Philip Marner gave a rent-charge of \u00a33 13s. 4d. on a house in Abbat-street, 6s. 8d. of which to the minister, as aforesaid, the rest to the poor. .Alice Avening, in 1498, gave a house (now No. 27) in Dollar-street, which then let at 40s. a year, but which, by permission of the Charity Com missioners, was sold in 1884 for \u00a3400. John Weobley, also in 1498, gave a house, afterwards exchanged for an annuity of \u00a31 6s. 8d., charged on a house in Dyer-street, formerly the Greyhound Inn. William Hooper, in 1605, gave a house in Little Silver-street, of \u00a32 4s. rent. Jeffry Bathe, in 1618, gave \u00a32 a year out of a house in Cricklade-street, viz., 6s. 8d. to the minister as aforesaid, and \u00a31 13s. 4d. to the poor. John Chandler, in 1632, gave a house in Cecily-street of \u00a32 a year. Mr. Humphry Bridges gave a house in Cricklade-street, of \u00a32 a year. George Monox, Esq., in 1639, gave five houses in this town, which let at \u00a323 10s., the produce of which (except \u00a38 a year for a monthly sermon, and 6s. 8d. to be spent) to be given in money to the poor. John Pathe, butcher, in 1641, gave a rent-charge of \u00a34 on a house in Dollar-street, half to decayed butchers and half to the other poor. Rowland Freeman, in 1658, gave a rent-charge of 40s. on a house and land now incorporated with Earl Bathurst's park."], [262, "226 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. An estate at South Cerney of forty acres was purchased out of the following bequests to the poor : \u2014 1625. \u2014 Samuel Coxwell, gent., \u00a350. 1639.\u2014 George Monox, \u00a3100. 1645.\u2014 Sir Henry Pratt, of London, Bart., \u00a3100. William Blomer, of Hatherop, \u00a320. Mrs. Chambers, \u00a350 ; and small contributions, \u00a353. Another sum of \u00a320, left by Mr. Blomer, was invested in a house in Gloucester-street, let without rent to a poor person. Of the following sums left to the poor, \u00a3220 was expended about 1730 in the purchase of the Churchyard and gardens adjoining as the unencumbered property of the parishioners, which gardens were taken into the Churchyard in 1847. The remainder of the money is invested in properties, the rents of which are devoted to their original object, \u00a3205 10s. having been invested in the purchase of the minister's house in 1826, for which the churchwardens pay \u00a310 yearly from the income derived from the church lands. In 1628, Thomas Damsel gave \u00a3100; in 1620, a man who had a lottery here, \u00a340 ; Mr. Thomas Shermore, of London, \u00a320; Mr. John Stone, \u00a320; Robert George, Esq., \u00a310; the heirs of Robert Strange, Esq., \u00a310 ; Mr. Edward Pratt, jun., \u00a310; 1606, Thomas Smith, \u00a320; 1615, John May, of Ampney St. Mary, \u00a310; Robert Stech, butcher, \u00a310; Edward Church, \u00a320 ; 1669, Lady Atkynson, of Stowel, \u00a310; 1679, John Oates, clothier, \u00a310; 1680, William Kerby, of London, salter, \u00a310; John Coxwell, Esq., \u00a3100; the Rev. William Master, \u00a350; 1706, Mrs. Winifred Master, \u00a360; other benefactions in smaller sums, \u00a322 10s. Mrs. Elizabeth Edwards gave \u00a3100 in 1726 to apprentice poor children ; and \u00a330 and four tenements in Castle street for four poor families, the houses being sold in 1729 for \u00a360. The sum of \u00a3785 14s. 4d., three and a half per cents., producing yearly \u00a327 10s., and standing in the name of Cripps and Clutterbuck, is derived from the bequest of \u00a3500 South Sea Annuities, by Mrs. Elizabeth Cripps, in 1784, augmented it would appear by a further donation from her sister, Miss Clutterbuck, who died four years later. Its object is to bestow in equal portions a small sum each year on ten widows or old unmarried women not otherwise receiving relief. John Day, Esq., by his deed, December 21, 1779, gave to trustees therein named and their successors for ever, 95 acres of land in Pinkney, in the county of Wilts, and the great and small tithes belonging to the rectory or parsonage of Pinkney impro priate, then in possession of William Deverell, in trust (after discharging the land tax and all expenses) to pay \u00a31 12s. on the 1st of February yearly, to the churchwardens of Easton Grey, for the poor of that parish ; and the rest of the rents and profits of the said estate to be by the trustees distributed among such poor decayed housekeepers, of the parishes of Cirencester and"], [263, "- - - \u25a0 - - '\u2014 x Itfhiteman. ifeB ass.

This charity in 1842 produced \u00a3263 10s. per annum. To Provide Clothing for the Poor. In 1642, Sir Anthony Hungerford gave four acres, called West Mead, in Ampney Crucis, for coats for eleven poor persons. Thomas Perry, sen., in 1673, gave \u00a320 for a like object. Edward King, in 1692, gave a rent charge of \u00a32 5s. on two houses in Coxwell street, for coats for four poor persons. Anne Peters, \u00a320; Nicholas Edwards, \u00a340; Sarah Humphries, \u00a310; and Frances Peek, \u00a35. Certain of these donations appear to have been expended in the purchase of a house, let in 1843 at \u00a32 a-year. Colonel Olney, by his will, payable in May, 1839, gave \u00a3300 (free from legacy duty) to the minister and churchwardens, \" to be invested in the purchase of Public or Parliamentary Stock and Funds, the annual produce of such sum to be expended in the purchase of coals and blankets to be distributed at Christmas annually, to such poor deserving persons as they shall select.\" Joseph Mill, Esq., of Shorncote, Wilts, left by will, in 1857, \u00a3500 (free from legacy duty), to be invested in the funds, to provide warm clothing for the poor of Cirencester at Christmas annually. To Provide Bread for the Poor. Mrs. Mary Chambers (1 Mapson), daughter of Mr. Monox, gave \u00a350; Mr. Fettiplace, \u00a320; Nicholas Edwards, \u00a310; Elizabeth, his widow, \u00a35 ; and Isaac Tibbets, her father, \u00a320. For Apprenticeship. Sir Thomas Rowe gave a rent charge of \u00a325, payable out of lands at Mouswell, in this county ; 40s. for a sermon, as already stated, and the rest to apprentice and set up poor youths of this town in trade, or to pay marriage portions to them, provided that one youth shall be apprenticed every third year from Rendcombe, if presented. Thomas Perry gave \u00a3100, and his son, Timothy Perry, \u00a312. These sums were laid out in the purchase of a freehold estate of 1\\ acres, at Upton St. Leonards, near Gloucester, producing in 1842 \u00a311 11s. per annum. In 1673, Richard George gave a rent-charge of \u00a33 a-year on a house in Gloucester street, to apprentice two boys, and according to the History of Cirencester, published 1842, William Forder gave \u00a320; Thomas Powell, \u00a340; James Clutterbuck, \u00a3100; Mrs. Elizabeth Edwards, in 1726, \u00a3100 ; and Richard Matthews, in 1727, \u00a3150, all for apprenticing children. ff"], [266, "228 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. The bequests of Perry and George appear as here given in the Charity Commissioners' Report ; that of Mrs. Edwards was utilised as stated ; Thomas Powell's is included in the Yellow School funds ; Clutterbuck's is given as \u00a3200 three per cent. consols ; and Matthews's as twenty-two acres of land producing \u00a324 per annum. Cockerell also left house property for apprenticing, but this has been lost. A large sum of money from the Yellow School funds was annually paid in apprenticeship fees. From thirty to forty children are also under apprenticeship through the Cirencester Society in London, out of an endowment left for the purpose by Mr. Edmonds, a member of the Society in the reign of Queen Anne, which would have been lost to the town but for the energetic efforts of Mr. Flux, Mr. Wilfred Cripps, and certain members of the Society fifteen years since."], [267, "PA.RT IX. PUBLIC BUILDINGS AND INSTITUTIONS. The Corn Hall. This building, a lofty and spacious apartment, 84 ft. by 42 ft., was erected by the Corn Hall Company, Limited, and was opened in September, 1862. It is largely attended by the farmers and corn dealers of the neighbourhood, who, before its erection, were compelled to transact their business at the Inns in the town, especially at the Old White Hart, where they were accustomed to stand outside with their little sample bags on the wide window boards. Several other firms not directly connected with the corn trade, from the town itself and other places, as Gloucester, Cardiff, &c, have their desks in the Hall. Altogether a brisk business is done, and it appears strange that an important market like Cirencester, at which, during the three years, 1858-60, preceding the formation of the Company, no less than 166,829 quarters were sold, could have been for so long conducted in such a primitive manner. The Hall is largely used for lectures, concerts, public meetings, and entertainments. There are retiring rooms attached, and there is a communication by a wide staircase with the King's Head Hotel Assembly Room, a fine apartment, about one half the area of the Corn Hall, which was formerly the principal room in the town for similar entertainments, but is now rarely used for such purposes. The Butter and Poultry Markets are held adjacent to the Corridor from the Corn Hall Buildings, which were erected in 1863, and comprise a Subscription Reading Room and Library, School of Art, business offices, and rooms for the hall keeper. The principal front facing the Market place is of Bath stone ashlar, and is in the Italian style. The Cattle Market Occupies the site of a field adjoining the Tetbury-road, formerly known as the Play Ground, in which the cattle were sold for several years after the market was removed from the Market-place. It covers about two acres, and was constructed by the late Earl Bathurst in 1867, whose heir receives all dues ; it is well paved with blue bricks and furnished with iron pens, &c. By order of"], [268, "230 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. the Privy Council some additional improvements have recently been effected. Further particulars are given in the Chapter on Fairs and Markets. Banks. There are two Banks in the town, which were established during the last century as private undertakings. For many years they were respectively known as Cripps's and Bowly's Banks, after the gentlemen who owned and managed them, but in course of time the former was affiliated with the Gloucestershire Banking Company, the latter with the County of Gloucester Bank. Both Banks issue a limited number of notes, which freely circulate in the neighbourhood. The Gloucestershire Bank ing Company has recently united with the Capital and Counties Bank. The new premises of this Banking Company in Gosditch street built in 1880 are in the Gothic style and an ornament to the town. The County of Gloucester Bank has a handsome and extensive frontage to Castle and Silver streets; it was erected early in the present century. The Savings' Bank Was started in 1817 by certain gentlemen of the neighbourhood, who subscribed \u00a3250 to meet the early incidental expenses. At the close of the first year there were 144 accounts, with a balance to the depositors' credit of \u00a32,838. In 1884 there were 2,218 accounts, and a depositors' balance of \u00a362,813 9s. 5d. The Bank building in Park-lane was erected in 1854 ; it is a simple but chaste example of the Classic style, and contains on the ground floor the bank and waiting room, and a large board room over. Public business is transacted from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Mondays and 7 to 8 p.m. on Tuesdays. Mr. W. Miller is the Actuary, and the institution is under the control of the Trustees and Managers. A Penny Bank for deposits from Id. upwards was opened in 1859. The Post Office Is conducted at a house in Castle-street, to which it was removed from less commodious premises in Black Jack-street in 1861. The business of the Office includes the Postal Telegraph, Money Orders, and Post Office Savings' Bank. There are several pillar boxes in the town, and branch offices for postal business only at Watermoor and Stratton.. The Agricultural Society. An Agricultural Society called after the town was instituted March 2, 1829, by the gentry and farmers of the district, and continued to hold its annual shows each December until 1854. In that year, at a meeting presided over by Sir C. W. Codrington, M.P., it was resolved to unite the Gloucester and Cirencester"], [269, "231 THE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. Societies (both of which were in a languishing state) as the Gloucestershire Agricultural Society, and to hold the shows alternate years at each town, the first united one being thus held at Cirencester in 1855. At a subsequent meeting at Gloucester, December 14, 1861, E. Holland, Esq., M.P., in the chair, it was resolved that the county meetings should not be confined to Gloucester and Cirencester, but that other places in the county should have the opportunity afforded them of welcoming the Society, upon their guaranteeing a sufficient amount to protect it from loss. After this decision, the first show was held at Gloucester in 1862, the second at Cirencester in 1863, which was also similarly honoured in 1869, 1875, and 1881, and is again to receive the Society in 1886. The other towns where the shows have been held are Bristol, Berkeley, Cheltenham, Stroud, and Tewkesbury. The three first meetings at Cirencester were eminently successful, that of 1875 producing a clear gain to the funds of \u00a3723 after paying all expenses; but in 1881, owing to bad weather, there was a loss of \u00a374, although the attractions were as great as in former years. It was suggested in 1884 to amalgamate with the Worcester and Hereford County Societies, but the proposal did not meet with public approval. A Chamber of Agriculture has existed at Cirencester for several years. The Horticultural Society. A Society of this kind was established in the town in 1829, and for many years held frequent exhibitions of choice plants and flowers. A splendid annual show of orchids, ferns, stove and greenhouse plants, with numerous varieties of flowers, fruits, and vegetables, is now held, usually in August, in the Abbey grounds. There is a Cottagers' class, for which special prizes are awarded, and for many years a Dog Show was always associated with the exhibition, but this year (1885) was not held. The prizes and awards now average about 300. A Rose show used to be held at the Corn Hall, but this has been discontinued for several years. Mr. R. F. Darby has a large variety of excellent plants, fruit bearing and other trees, evergreens, &c, at his \" Cotswold Nurseries,\" all situated at Watermoor ; and Messrs. J. Jefferies and Son, in their well-known \" Cirencester Nurseries,\" in and near the town and at Siddington, cultivate a stock of plants surpassed by few nurseries in the kingdom. In the season, about 30,000 rose trees may be seen in full bloom at the Siddington Nursery, and for these prizes have been obtained at the Crystal Palace and other leading exhibitions. The business was first established by the father of the late Mr. William Gregory, in 1795, and an excellent account of the present Nurseries is given in the Journal of Horticulture, for September 18, 1884. Mr. James Trinder has likewise a floral Nursery, formerly part of the Waterloo gardens."], [270, "232 history of cirencester. The Subscription Library and Reading Room. The institution formerly known as the Permanent Library and News Room, was established in 1835, in conjunction with the Town Museum, for the reception of antiquities and geological and other objects of interest. The leading papers and periodicals were taken in, and the Library, which eventually exceeded 3,000 volumes, including many standard and valuable works, was supplemented by the presentation from the Government of a complete series of the Calendars of the Public Records. In 1863, it was resolved at a public meeting, to remove the Permanent Library from Mr. Baily's, where it had been for some years located, to the Corn Hall Buildings, and to unite it with the Mechanics' Institute. This institution had existed for about twenty years, and, although for the closing two or three years of its career it had been less prosperous, had received in its time a large measure of public support, the reading room being supplied with the leading daily papers, the library containing some 500 volumes, whilst numerous excellent lectures on social, historical, and scientific subjects had been delivered under its auspices. By the union of the two, the existing institution was then formed, the subscription being fixed at 21s., 10s. 6d., and 5s. per annum, according to the privileges of membership. For several years the news room was largely patronized, and the constant services of a librarian retained, but of late years the subscriptions have fallen off, and it was consequently found necessary, first to dispense with the librarian, and recently to sell the whole of the Library by auction, and to exchange rooms with Messrs. Moore and Hill. The cause of the news room being less patronized is perhaps owing to the increased purchase of papers and periodicals by the public in general, and the exclusion of chess and draughts, which were permitted at the Mechanics' Institute. The Roman antiqui ties in the Town Museum were removed in 1856 to the Museum specially built for their reception ; and the other articles, comprising several excellent geological and ornithological specimens, and including some fossilized remains of the Icthyosaurus, Plesio saurus, and other extinct animals, principally found in the construction of the Great Western Railway, near Minety, a splendid case of fossils from Palermo, presented by the late Marquis of Northampton, with specimens of coral, stuffed birds, &c, are now under the care of Mr. Overthrow, Dyer-street. Some new works have been procured by the Library sale. _ A Working Men's Club was established in Cirencester about eighteen years ago, and was kept up for several years. The Cotswold Coffee Tavern Was started a few years since by a Limited Company, with the philanthropic object of providing an attractive resort for youno men during the winter evenings. Under a competent manager"], [271, "233 the temperance hall. the venture proved a commercial success, the takings for 1883 amounting to \u00a3965. In March, 1884, by arrangement with the manager it was decided to permit him to conduct the business for his own benefit on condition of his paying the Company a fixed sum, which, with the rental of the house, would produce a permanent dividend of fifteen per cent. Of this sum it was decided that five per cent, should be divided amongst the share holders, and the remainder carried to a reserve fund. Temperance Societies. The Cirencester Temperance Society and East Gloucestershire Temperance Union were amalgamated in 1882, and have their head quarters in Cirencester. The Good Templars, Rechabites, and Church of England Temperance Society have also branches here. The Cirencester Microscopical and Naturalist Society Holds frequent meetings under the presidency of Mr. E. J. E. Creese, secretary of the Young Men's Christian Association, at which papers on scientific subjects are read and discussed. The School of Art, In connection with the Science and Art Department, South Kensington, was established here under the tuition of Mr. James Miller, in 1860, and by his excellent management and indefati gable exertions it has had an uninterrupted career of success. Numerous prizes and some few scholarships have been procured. It is deserving of mention that for one year at least (1864) it ranked the highest in the kingdom in respect to awards, taking the number of pupils and population into account. Several pupils are prepared each year for the Second Grade examination, and. Science Classes have also been conducted for chemistry, building construction, and other subjects. Mr. Miller (who has now an assistant master) is also Professor of Drawing at the Royal Agricultural College, teacher at the public schools, and for several years conducted the branch or night schools at Swindon, now formed into a separate Art school. The Choral Society Holds meetings for practice under the leadership of Mr. Brind, and gives a sacred concert twice a year. The Cirencester District Teachers' Association, For the teachers of the Elementary schools of the town and neighbourhood, was instituted in 1856. The Temperance Hall, In Thomas-street, was built in 1846, at the sole expense of the late Mr. Christopher Bowly, a member of the Society of Friends,"], [272, "234 history of cirencester. who also built and endowed the Almshouses on the Watermoor road. It occupies the site of the brewery of the late Mr. J. Masters, and is a handsome erection, with Decorated Gothic front, costing \u00a32,000, and capable of seating 600 persons, with residence for the caretaker and committee room at the back. The primary object of the Hall is, as its name implies, for the promotion of temperance principles, and it is furnished with tables and tea service for 400 people. It is let free of charge (the cost of gas, fuel, and cleaning excepted) on application to the Trustees, through their Secretary, by the expressed desire of the Testator, for scientific lectures, religious services, and \" for any purpose \" which in the judgment of the Trustees is \" calculated to promote the welfare and happiness of their fellow men,\" and during the winter months is much in requisition, though less so than before the erection of the Corn Hall. Bible Society. An auxiliary of the British and Foreign Bible Society has been established in Cirencester for many years. Messrs. Gillett and Co. kindly keep the depot at their shop, and disposed in 1883 of between 400 and 500 Bibles, Testaments, and portions of the Bible. The subscriptions enabled \u00a343 in the same year to be sent to the Parent Society, and \u00a342 the year before. Mr. Christopher Bowly and Mr. J. Mullings are honorary secretaries, and Mr. C. Tudway treasurer. The Society being purely unsectarian, and formed with the object of providing the Holy Scriptures, without note or comment, much below cost price, has deservedly the support of Churchmen and Nonconformists. The Cirencester Cricket Club Was formed in 1842, and is esteemed one of the leading Clubs of the county. A professional bowler is engaged, some years in conjunction with the College Club, and matches are played each season between these rival Cirencester Clubs, as well as with the principal Clubs of Gloucester, Cheltenham, Bath, Stroud, &c. The members practise in the beautiful ground placed at their disposal in Earl Bathurst's Park. There are likewise some Junior Clubs who engage on the ground adjacent in this healthful sport. Both Town and College have their Football Clubs. The Swimming Baths Company, Limited. This Company was formed in 1870 to provide a proper bathing place for the townspeople, who were before either debarred from that pleasure or compelled to bathe at inconveniently early hours in the Churn or the Canal. The Bath, 90 ft. by 45 ft., will contain nearly 100,000 gallons of water. It is well constructed, being lined with white glazed bricks, and has dressing boxes, spring board, &c. The water is pumped in from"], [273, "235 THE ROYAL NORTH GLOUCESTER MILITIA. an adjacent well by steam power. The situation in Earl Bfithurst's Park, adjoining the Gumstool Brook, is convenient ; but it is not certain that it might have been more successful commercially if a place had been chosen on the north side of the town and the Churn water utilised, the expense of pumping would have been saved and a more equable temperature ensured. At present the water is very cold when fresh pumped. The Bath is open from May 1st to September 30th in each year, and there are special hours for ladies. A Swimming Club was formed in 1884 by the exertions of Mr. Charles Cripps. Prizes are given and some excellent contests have taken place. The Royal North Gloucester Militia, Which by the Act of 44 Victoria became the 4th Battalion Gloucestershire Regiment, was first raised in 1757, although Cirencester had for at least two hundred years before been the rendezvous of forces despatched from the county for home and foreign service. In 1798, the regiment went to Ireland to assist in putting down the rebellion, and was presented on its return with a costly set of colours by the Corporation of Gloucester. In 1863, other colours were presented without the military service. The Kingscote family have been its most prominent supporters. Colonel Robert Kingscote, after serving for several years in the regular army, accepted a commission in it in 1796, which he held for forty-four years, and rose to the colonelcy of the regiment. His son, the late Colonel Kingscote, afterwards commanded the regiment in person until his death in 1861, and was succeeded by his son (who has just retired from the repre sentatation of West Gloucestershire) as Honorary Colonel, and by Lieut. -Colonel Wallington, K.C.B., as Colonel-Commandant. Colonel Wallington, to whose training the regiment owes its present efficiency, resigned his appointment in 1884, and was succeeded by Lieut. -Colonel Hunte. For some years previous to 1852 the Militia had not been called up, but was then embodied for a few weeks, and was subsequently quartered in the town from December 26th, 1854, to February 8th, 1856 ; was then ordered to Pembroke, and kept to garrison duty until June 5th, when it returned to Cirencester, and was disembodied on the 12th of the same month. The officers and men re-assembled November 3rd, 1857, and on the 25th proceeded to Ireland, but returned the following year, and have not since been sent out of the county. The force, numbering 800 strong, has assembled every Spring since 1859, for a term of drill, the recruits being generally called up for a few weeks preliminary training. During the Egyptian campaign several volunteered for active service. The Armoury is a fine building in the Castellated Gothic style, with handsome elevation, 143 feet long to Cecily-hill, and a 6G"], [274, "236 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. depth of 60 feet, erected in 1856 from the designs of Messrs. Fulljames and Waller, Gloucester, who also designed the other Armoury at Gloucester, a similar but less imposing erection. The Cecily-hill front, with its angle bastions and central tower turret, is very effective, whilst the opposite elevation is rendered imposing by the projecting wings and the long flights of steps to the central entrance, rendered necessary by the yard level being at a much lower level than Cecily-hill. The yard or drill ground measures about 150 feet square. There is a large stand of arms and storage of ammunition, clothing, and other military accoutre ments. The Armoury has attached a mess-room for the officers, added about fifteen years since, and quarters for a certain number of staff sergeants. The work was carried out in a most creditable manner by Mr. Weeks, builder, of South Cerney. The hospital was for several years in Silver-street, but cases of illness are now treated at a house in Dollar-street. The Cirencester Volunteer Rifle Corps, First known as the \" Ninth Gloucestershire,\" but now, if correctly described with its full title, as the \" Cirencester (D) Company of the Second Volunteer Battalion of the Gloucestershire Regiment,\" owes its establishment to a public meeting called, under the presidency of the High Steward of the Borough, November 28th, 1859, Mr. Joseph Sewell being foremost amongst the promoters of the movement. In December following, A. A. Bathurst, Esq., M.P. (now Earl Bathurst), was elected Captain ; Captain Sherston, Lieutenant; and W. T. t>ewe, Esq., Ensign. In February, 1860, the full complement having been made up, the corps commenced drill and musketry instruction under Sergeant-Major Macdonald, of the \"Royal North,\" and in 1885 publicly celebrated the completion of a highly creditable career of a quarter of a century, in which the members of the corps have generally obtained high commendation for the excellence of their drill, whilst some have distinguished themselves in local and national shooting competi tions. In 1863, the National Shooting Prize, at Hythe, was won by Sergeant F. Hoare, afterwards Quarter-Master of the Battalion. The company attended the National Review at Oxford by the Duke of Cambridge in 1863, and those by the Queen in Windsor Great Park in 1868 and 1881. In 1868 and in more recent years a detachment has visited Belgium. The County Battalion was accustomed to assemble yearly on the Ham, at Gloucester, for inspection, but on one occasion accepted an invitation to meet in Earl Bathurst's Park, and were liberally entertained by the townspeople and the officers of the regiment. In 1873, and each successive summer, the Battalion has encamped for a week, the places hitherto chosen being Hampton Common and Cleeve and Stinchcombe Hills; for 1886, Cirencester is proposed as the rendezvous. In 1872, Captain Bathurst resigned his commission,"], [275, "237 hospitals. and was followed by Mr. Chester Master (Major in the R.N.G.M.), Captains E. W. Cripps and E. C. Sewell, who is the present commanding officer, and son of Mr. Sewell, the \" Father of the Company.\" The present shooting range of 1000 yards is in Earl Bathurst's Park ; the first range was at Baunton and only 400 yards. In 1798, according to Rudder, the younger part of the principal inhabitants, following other towns, formed themselves into a Volunteer force, about 100 strong, but the corps was disbanded in May, 1802. In 1803 another corps of 450 was raised, under Colonel Cripps, and a body of Volunteer Cavalry, under the command of the third Earl Bathurst, with the professed object of resisting a French invasion. The present Volunteer force owes its existence to a similar pretext, which, if not based upon any solid grounds, has eventuated in the creation of an army of thoroughly disciplined men, perhaps unequalled for purposes of internal defence by that of any other country in the world. The Cottage Hospital. This valuable and beneficent institution was founded in 1875 by Mr. Allen Alexander (now Earl) Bathurst, in affectionate remembrance of his first wife, daughter of Lord de Tabley. It is managed by a committee of fourteen residents in the town and neighbourhood, elected annually. Mr. R. A. Anderson is hon. secretary, and the Rev. G. F. E. Shaw, Rector of Edgeworth, hon. treasurer. There is a resident matron and nurse, who gives the greatest satisfaction. During the ten years, 1875 to 1885, upwards of 950 cases were treated, many involving great surgical and medical skill, and careful nursing. The doctors of the town give their services gratuitously. The funds are derived from annual subscriptions and donations, collections in places of worship, and the small fees charged to patients at the discretion of the committee. The hospital building is a picturesque half timbered edifice in Sheep-street, in the mixed style of art prevalent between the decay of Gothic art and the Classic revival. The Infectious Diseases' Hospital Was established in 1878 by the combined Urban and Rural Sanitary Districts of Cirencester. The hospital is situate to the south of the town, near the Canal, and was formerly a pair of dwelling houses. The situation is open and there is a good garden attached. The charges to patients are decided by a joint committee of the Guardians and Local Board, but in no case exceed the bare cost of food. These charges are remitted if patients enter under the certificate of the Poor Law Medical Officer, or if unable to pay them. All extra expenses are borne by the Sanitary Authorities. The value of the hospital in"], [276, "238 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. preventing the spread of zymotic diseases has been strongly insisted upon by Dr. Bond, who has advised their establishment in Gloucester and other places. The Union Workhouse. This building was erected in 1836, under the requirements of the Poor Law Act, for the newly formed Union district of Cirencester, which comprises the town and 38 circumjacent parishes in Wilts and Gloucester, with an area of 85,079 acres, and, in 1881, a population of 21,310. It is an extensive pile of buildings with frontage faced with freestone, having an extreme approximate length of 360 feet, and breadth of 180 feet. The master's house is in the centre and commands a view of all the yards and of each block of building ; there is a board room for the Guardians, with male, female, casual wards, &c, complete, for 330 inmates. A new female infirmary, laundry, and wash houses have lately been added. There is a fever infirmary detached, also a lock-up for the refractory, which was the Cirencester Gaol in the days of the old watchmen, and was removed and erected here. About six acres of ground are cultivated, upon which all vegetables required are grown. Mr. and Mrs. R. C. Freeman are the master and matron. The children are taught by a resident mistress. The Cirencester Provident Coal Club Is supported by the weekly deposits of about four hundred poor families of the town aided by subscriptions. In 1884, the former amounted to nearly \u00a3200, and the latter to \u00a340, coals to the full value of more than \u00a3240 being supplied to the depositors. The Town Dispensary, Established many years since, is principally dependent upon subscribers, who present tickets to poor residents for medicine and medical advice. Previous to December, 1884, these tickets were supplied gratis, but since then each recipient is charged one shilling on the first presentation only of the ticket for medicines. In 1884, the subscriptions slightly exceeded \u00a360, and the disbursements included : \u2014 Medical Officers' salary, \u00a320 ; 306 medicine tickets at 2s. 6d. each, for medicines purchased at the chemists, \u00a338 5s. The vicar of the parish is chairman of the Committee of Management, ex-officio. The Cirencester Provident Dispensary and Medical Club. The object of this institution, which has been recently started, is to provide medicine and professional attendance at their own homes to working men and their families, at terms about equal to those charged by the medical officers of Friendly Societies for the same advantages. It is proposed that adults, male and female,"], [277, "THE POLICE STATION. 239 should each pay Id. per week, or 4s. 4d. per annum; the three eldest children of a family each a fourth of that sum, or 13d. per annum, and that the remaining children, if under 14 years of age, should be attended free. The value of this Club will consist, it is urged, in the promotion of \" provident habits and independ ence \" amongst a class of persons who are compelled to receive medical aid by order of the Guardians through inability to pay a doctor's bill, but in other respects receive no relief from the poor law authorities. In 1883 there were 486 applications of this kind to the Cirencester Guardians, and the offer of medical relief on such easy terms will unquestionably be a great boon, but it must be remembered that there are many whom it is intended to benefit who are not by any means lacking in thrift, who are compelled by their small earnings to apply for the medical help they are legitimately entitled to. Friendly Societies. There are several Friendly and Benefit Societies in Cirencester, of which the principal are \u2014 \u25a0 The Loyal Corinium Lodge, Manchester Unity Independent Order of Odd Fellows, established September 28th, 1841, and numbering 280 members ; secretary, Mr. C. Wray. The Loyal Friendship Lodge of the same Order, dating from 1843, and numbering 270 members ; secretary, Mr. J. Jennings. The Ancient Order of Foresters has two Courts in the town. Court 1756, Cirencester and Cotswold District, opened in 1844, has now 400 members ; secretary, Mr. T. Clutterbuck. Court 5709, opened in 1872, has now 200 members; secretary, Mr. F. Weskett. Both the Foresters' Courts and the Corinium Lodge of Odd Fellows have Juvenile Branches for members between five and eighteen years of age, and number together about 400. The East Gloucestershire Friendly Society, of which Ciren cester is the head quarters, has branches in several neighbouring villages and small towns. This Club was started by gentlemen of the town in 1856. Mr. F. B. Foote is secretary. There has been for some time a Medical Club in connection with the Hearts of Oak Benefit Society, the members of which have recently decided to subscribe to the general fund, and thus to participate in the full benefits. Cirencester is also the head quarters of the Cotswold Corinium Benefit Society, with which many of the members of the old Benefit Societies of the neighbourhood are associated. The Police Station For the Petty Sessional District of Cirencester was opened in 1859. It contains Petty Sessional Court, Magistrates' room, &c, with residence for the Superintendent and his staff of Police,"], [278, "240 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. By order of the Quarter Sessions, the Station has lately been enlarged and improved, at a cost of about \u00a3300. The County Court, which used to be at the Town Hall, is held here once a month. Before the erection of the present Station, the Magis trates' Court was also held at the Town Hall, and a house in Gloucester-street was rented for the policemen and for the detention of prisoners. The Gas Works. Cirencester was first lighted with gas by Mr. William Morley Stears, gas engineer, of Leeds, in the autumn of 1833. The works, designed and executed by Mr. Stears, possessed two small gasholders, thirty feet diameter, each capable of containing 5,500 cubic feet, and these with some difficulty were made to supply the town until 1854, when extensive alterations were carried out, and a holder, fifty feet diameter, and an effective cubical content of 28,000 was erected. From this time the two small holders were retained, but little used, until 1864, when a continually increasing consumption necessitated their removal and the construction of a holder by Messrs. Walker, Ironbridge, Stafford shire, sixty feet diameter, and capable of sending out 57,000 cubic feet. At the same time several minor alterations were carried out, and prior to it new retorts and chimney had been added, whilst in more recent years numerous improvements for the production of pure gas on the most approved principles have been effected by a still further enlargement and re-arrangement of the retort house, new purifiers and condensers, scrubber, purifying and storage sheds, &c. The manufacture of sulphate of ammonia was commenced a few years ago, and about the same time the Company commenced to let out gas stoves for heating and culinary purposes at moderate rentals. These stoves are free from the objectionable smell which pertained to the old gas stoves, and which prevented their more general adoption. By arrangement with the Midland and South Western Junction Railway Company, a storage shed for coals has been erected in their yard with railway siding into the Gas Works. In 1884, the Gas Company purchased three acres of land adjacent to the same line and obtained from Mr. Newbigging plans for the entire re-arrangement of the works upon it. It is needless to add that there is no probability of Mr. Newbigging's scheme being adopted at present in anything like its entirety, but the Directors naturally feel that all future extensions should be conducted on a definite pre-arranged plan. In accordance with Mr. Newbigging's drawings, a new gasholder, eighty feet diameter, and effective cubical content of upwards of 100,000 cubic feet, has just been constructed, and brought into use in August, 1885, thus permitting a total storage of about 185,000 cubic feet. The works have been managed most successfully by Mr. A. Murphy since his father's death in"], [279, "THE CIRENCESTER WATERWORKS. 241 1860 ; Mr. Murphy, senior, having been left in charge by Mr. Stears in 1833, and continued as manager until his death. Mr. J. Mullings is Chairman of the Directors, and Mr. J. P. Beecham, secretary. It is worthy of note that there are over ten miles of main piping leading from the gasholders through the town and suburbs, an unusual length for the population supplied. The price of gas when the works were opened was 15s. per thousand feet \u2014 it is now 3s. 1 1 d. only, with a discount of five per cent, for prompt payment. The Company was formed into a limited liability one in December, 1865. The Cirencester Waterworks Company (Limited) Was formed in 1882, with a capital of \u00a35,000, for the conversion into Waterworks of the Cotswold Brewery premises in Lewis-lane, which, on the death of Mr. Edward Bowly, had been purchased by Messrs. Cripps and Co. Mr. J. H. Taunton, M.I.C.E., F.G.S., whose position as engineer to the Canal Company for many years had rendered him fully conversant with the geological character of the district, is the Company's Consulting Engineer. The professed object, it is needless to state, is to ensure to the town a more efficient supply of pure water, and the source relied upon is an artesian well sunk at the Brewery not long before the formation of the Company. This can be best explained by quoting the Prospectus : \u2014 \" The situation of Cirencester, taken in connection with the physical conditions of the adjacent Oolitic district, renders its supply with pure spring water a very simple matter. The rain, falling over an extensive and elevated area occupied by porous ground of the Great Oolite, percolates through to the underlying Fuller's Earth formation, where the descent of the waters is arrested, and they assume a subterranean course, and this at first at an elevation considerably above the town, but following the dip of the strata the stored water traverses the highly permeable beds of the Great Oolite, some 100 feet and upwards beneath the town, imprisoned from below by the Fuller's Earth, and from above by the clays and impermeable rock of the Forest Marble. In consequence an artesian character is developed in these waters, and when a bore is sunk down to them they ascend in the tube to a level at Cirencester, not much below the ground surface. In this way they have been tapped at the Barton and at the Cotswold Brewery, the observations made at both places shewing that a supply in sufficient quantity for all present and prospective requirements at Cirencester is obtainable from this source.\" The water has been declared by the late Dr. Augustus Voelcker to be \" one of the finest and best drinking waters \" which had passed through his hands \" for some time past.\" The water is raised from the works to a storage reservoir, containing upwards of 200,000 gallons, near the Farm road in Earl Bathurst's Park,"], [280, "242 history of cirencester. the high water level being 100 feet above that of Cirencester Market-place, and thus capable of supplying all parts of the town and suburbs. By arrangement with the Local Board the Company have fixed hydrants free of cost for the extinction of fires, and provide the water for flushing the sewers and watering the streets. Hitherto the Company has not commanded the custom of a large proportion of the inhabitants, who are for the most part well supplied with excellent water rising out of the gravel bed fifteen to twenty feet below the surface, which since the completion of the sewerage is free from the former risk of contamination. The steady increase in population must, however, tell in the Company's favour, as it will be found more economical to use its water for building purposes as well as for permanent use than to sink wells. Their service has the further advantage that it will be possible to have baths and water supply to the upper floors of houses at much less cost than formerly. Hitherto Cirencester has been somewhat behindhand in this respect and especially behind northern towns, where most houses of \u00a325 a year rental have their bath room with hot and cold water supply. The Cirencester Improved Dwellings Company (Limited). Upwards of thirty years ago a Freehold Land Society was started, but the scheme fell through in consequence of the defection of some of its early promoters. That it would have been a profitable investment seems certain from the Pitacre and Nursery estates, soon after brought into the market, being sold in small plots at vastly enhanced prices. In 1870, the land on the east side of the New-road was offered in small lots, but for this reason, and from a lull having set in after the extraordinary building activity of the preceding ten years, none of this land was occupied by new buildings for another period of equal duration. In 1880, the Improved Dwellings Company was started, and opened Victoria-street, erecting ten houses on the south side, and have this year, 1885, completed the street by putting up ten opposite to them. In the interval they have built twenty-six houses in School-lane, and Mr. Crook and others have also built several ; so that in all, within the last five years, upwards of a hundred working class dwellings have been added to Cirencester and Stratton, which find ready occupants, who naturally prefer them to some of the close and crowded houses in the alleys of Cricklade and other streets.- The Cemetery Adjoins Chesterton-lane on the south side. It is six and a quarter acres in extent, is tastefully laid out, and was set apart for interments in 1871, and contains elegant Gothic chapels for Episcopalians and Nonconformists, a handsome Lodge and a mortuary building executed by Mr. W. Hinton, of Cirencester,"], [281, "ROMAN RNT/QUIT/ES poohd mC/RENCESTER WLiteinan &B 3 <- = 7ft 1; to -Zufft u Lew -"], [282, ""], [283, ""], [284, ""], [285, "243 THE CIRENCESTER SOCIETY IN LONDON. from the designs and under the superintendence of Mr. Medland, of Gloucester. The grounds were laid out and trees supplied by Mr. R. F. Darby, of Cirencester. Previous to the opening of the Cemetery, the Nonconformists used the small burying ground in the Watermoor road. The Parish Churchyard is still used for the burial of persons with friends in brick graves not filled up. The Friends' grave yard in Thomas-street is also open. The Cirencester Society in London Has existed for nearly 200 years, its records going back to 1692, but there is no certainty as to the exact circumstances which led to its formation, although there can be no doubt that its object was to keep up old friendships and to render mutual assistance in the case of Cirencester men who had left the home of their nativity to gain their livelihood in the metropolis. The value of such an institution, where travelling was not the easy matter it is now, must then have been very great, and there can be no doubt that many Cirencester young men received a helping hand from the Society, and b}r intercourse with old friends were preserved from many of the temptations to which a young man in those days (when the intellectual attractions of London were less than now) would be subjected. In 1710, Mr. Edmonds left money for apprenticeship, two-thirds to two metropolitan parishes and the remainder to the Cirencester Society for the apprenticeship of the young men of his native town, but, although the members regularly met for their annual dinner and held other meetings, this charity was lost sight of until recovered as stated on page 228. HH"], [286, "I> R T X . ROMAN ANTIQUITIES. Cirencester has scarcely been excelled, if indeed equalled in the number <and importance of its relics of Roman art. There are no structures of finished masonry standing, but these have disappeared from every other Roman station, if we except the wall of Severus and the slight remains of the walls of Verulam, and a few other places. The Chester walls can hardly be included, for if built on Roman foundations the facework is certainly medi\u00e6val. A perfect Roman arch did stand at Lincoln, forming the north or Newport gate of the city, but this was removed about the commencement of this century. The remains of buildings, pavements, columns, and minor articles, such as pottery, coins, instruments, in metal, bone, and wood, statuary, jewels, &c, that are being unearthed from time to time, however, amply testify to the importance of Corinium, and to the intelligence and high degree of civilization of its former occupants. Of these interesting relics some are in the Town Museum, and others have found their way into private collections. A full description would fill a volume, and we cannot pretend to give here more than a few general particulars. The best work is, of course, the \" Remains of Roman Art,\" by Messrs. Buckman and Newmarch, 1850. Since then Professor Church has published a small catalogue of the articles in the Museum, and proposes to bring out a much larger illustrated work. Mr. T. B. Bravender has also printed a catalogue of his valuable collection. In the present chapter we have endeavoured to add to the hitherto written information respecting the public works of Corinium, the lines of its streets, watercourses, and fortifications, and to preserve a record of the roads, buildings, &c, discovered from time to time, on a carefully prepared map reduced from the Ordnance Survey. In this respect previous works have been defective. Messrs. Buckman and Newmarch's map is unworthy of so excellent a volume, being very inaccurate and incomplete, and there is a danger of these interesting particulars being lost. It is not pretended that the lines of all the streets of the ancient city are absolutely correct, much is necessarily conjecture, but the position and direction of the roads that have been discovered, and the principles upon which their cities were laid out, are taken"], [287, "245 THE city walls. into consideration and explained in the letterpress, and the plan is offered for acceptance with the hope that it may lead to a more complete acquaintance with the subject. These principles could not be better explained than in the work of Dr. Adams, on Roman Antiquities. He writes, in reference to their camps, \" The winter quarters of the Romans were strongly fortified and furnished, particularly under the emperors, with every accommodation like a city, as storehouses, workhouses, an infirmary, &c. Hence from them many towns in Europe are supposed to have had their origin in England, particularly those whose names end in ' cester ' or ' Chester.' \" The form was generally oblong, modified by the nature of the ground and other circumstances, and from the remains of the defunct city of Silchester1 as well as those of Corinium, it will be admitted that they partook \" very much of the same nature, both as to the disposal of their walls, ditches, streets and gates, as the consular or rather the imperial camp.\" The military camp under the emperors was invariably surrounded with a fosse and rampart with four principal gates, one on each side. These were the Porta Pr\u00e6toria at the end next the enemy, the Porta Decumana opposite, and the Port\u00e6 Dextra and Sinistra on the long sides. In the upper part was the Pr\u00e6torium, or general's tent, surrounded by his attendants. On one side of the Pr\u00e6torium was the Qu\u00e6stor's tent, near which was the Forum, or place where provisions, &c, were sold, and meetings called. A large space stretching across the camp divided it into two distinct parts, and there were generally two other cross \" vi\u00e6 \" or ways between the troops equidistant from this, and five parallel \" vi\u00e6 \" running lengthways from the Pr\u00e6torian to the Decuman end of the camp. At Silchester the walls enclose an irregular elongated octagon. Here, besides lesser parallel avenues, there were two main streets crossing each other in the middle of the town, connecting the east and west and the north with the south gates. In Cirencester the Ermine-street passes through the town from north-west to south-east, and the Fosse and Acman streets enter it on either side, and a similar regular plan will be found to exist in all Romano-British towns.2 The City Walls. The walls ceased to be kept up about the year 1400, and since then the stonework has been removed for the erection of buildings, the walls having been in fact for centuries the quarry from which modern Cirencester was built, so that now the facework has entirely disappeared, and the inner bank only remains on the 1 The site of Silchester is now cornfields, but the lines of streets are apparent after a period of dry weather. 2 In Chichester, where the walls remain tolerably perfect, two main streets intersect in the centre of the enclosure ; the same at Chester, and at Gloucester there are the North, South, East, and Westgate-streets, although the walls have long since disappeared."], [288, "246 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. east and south-east sides with fragments elsewhere, but these are sufficient, with the discoveries of the foundations in several places during the recent sewerage works, to determine with tolerable certainty the complete circuit ; a line, be it observed, defined almost correctly in Messrs. Buckman and Newmarch's work. The work of demolition must have gone on rapidly for some time, for Leland, in 1535, writes in his Itinerary: \u2014 \"The Cumpace of the old Waul ' cujus pauca adhuc extant vestigia,' i.e., of which at present there remain but few vestiges was nere hand, II myles. A man may yet walking on the Bank of Churne evidently perceyve the Cumpace of Fundation of Towers sumtyme standing in the Waul and nere to the place wher the right goodly clothing Mylle was set up a late by the Abbate was broken down the ruin of an old tower toward making of the Mylle waulles in the which place was fownd a quadrate stone fawlleu down afore but broken in aliquot frustra (i.e., in sundry pieces) wherein was a Roman inscription, of the which, one scantlie letter'd that saw yt told me, that he might perceyve the words ' PONT MAX ' \" \u2014 probably signifying the largest bridge or a bridge built in the reign of one of the emperors Maximian or Maximus. There would un doubtedly be a Roman bridge at this place. In his Collectanea, Leland notes that the Abbot told him that he had found in the ruins of the old walls \" Arcuatos lapides insculptos majusculis literis Romanis,\" i.e., arched stones engraven with large Roman letters. There can be no question of the accuracy of the Abbot's statements, which are verified by similar discoveries elsewhere. The Sloane MS., 4206, perhaps half a century later, states that \" The romayne wales do show that the towne of Cissiter in ancient time tooke up about two miles in compasse. Ther hath bene found sundrie testimonies of antiquities as coynes and stone tables with romayne inscriptions.\" In 1723, Doctor Stukeley considered that he could then trace the walls quite round the town. We have stated that this is still possible, and that independently of the more precise information obtained within the last four or five years, that this was done with tolerable accuracy by the authors of Roman Art, and could still be done on their lines by a close observer aided by an accurate map. We are disposed to think that there were few more actual remains of the wall in Stukeley's time than now, but that those that did exist were more marked. Rudder, who evidently did not examine so closely, writes in reference to Stukeley's assertion, \" of which we have no doubt, but antiquities give way to modern improvements, so that all which remains of the wall at present lies on the east and south sides, about a mile in length, covered with earth and rubbish, in some places about ten feet high. A small part being uncovered in 1774 it was found to be eight feet thick and what then remained of it about three high, built with hewn stone, strongly cemented"], [289, "247 THE CITY WALLS. with lime, sand, and gravel.\" With the exception of one or two small portions on the south side, where the bank has been removed or been converted into a gradual slope, it is clear that there has been little change during the present century. The Rev. J. Collinson, a contemporary of Rudder's and a collector of ancient MSS. and antiquities, describes the course taken, but differs from the line we have shewn was followed for a few hundred yards on the west side. Possibly Collinson's line may be correct as an extension of the more ancient town limits, as it takes in Cecily-hill and Gloucester-street parts of the modern town. In describing the existing remains we will start at the Hospital Gate in Grove-lane. This gate, as already stated in the account of the Abbey, is of the Norman period, and on the north-west side of it following the boundary is a stone wall about one and a half yards thick which separate the old from the more modern part of the lodge. It is possibly coeval with the gate itself. From A proceeding southwards the traces of the fortifications are very slight to the Ice House at C. Messrs. Buckman and Newmarch, in 1850, describe the mound as much broken in this part in consequence of alterations to the Abbey grounds \u2014 the mound is now (1885) almost levelled. The same authors state that at that date \" many of the inhabitants of Cirencester \" remembered \" seeing massive stone walls \" at the point marked B in the map accompanying this work. These walls could not have been destroyed, then, so long as these words would lead the reader to infer, as the recollection of them has not altogether ceased. At C, the Ice House has been formed in the bank of the wall itself, and from thence to the London-road, at D, the mound is still much broken, although in some places not less than eight or ten feet high. Throughout this part the Churn, which here flows in an artificial cut intended as a fosse, is at a greater distance from the bank than from the London-road southwards. It is probable that the inner slope was very gradual or divided by a cess or level part, and that the stone wall itself was built, as it appears to have been at the Hospital Gate, within a few yards of the stream. It is evident from the height of the stream banks, that the surface of the ground between it and the existing mounds has been raised by the distribution of the remainder of the earthwork which formed the embankment when complete. At the London-road, the foundations were uncovered during the sewerage operations, and prior to 1382, according to Collinson, was a gate, the entrance from the Fosse and Ikenield ways, and if, as Stukeley suggests, the Pr\u00e6torium was in the Nursery, answering to the Porta Sinistra of the enclosure.1 1 If the Pr\u00e6torium were towards the northern part of the town, this would be the Porta Dextra, and the position of Pr\u00e6torian and Decuman gates would also be reversed. The foundation here discovered is probably that of a gate, and not in the direct line of wall."], [290, "248 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. Crossing the London-road the site of the wall as far as E appears to be occupied by Mr. Sewell's and the adjoining houses in the Beeches ; all traces of the bank are lost except that the grass field slopes gradually from the Beeches to the natural or low level stream in the field below. From F to K the embankment is very high, fifteen to twenty feet above the ground inside, and as far as H so strong that the earthwork stands six to ten feet almost vertically without the stonework above the Beeches-road. At Exeter and other places the land immediately outside the walls is now a public highway as here.1 At G, a cut has been made through the wall for the purposes of irrigation from the high level stream which forms the ancient vallum, and here the construction of the interior or backing of the wall, consisting of stones, lime, sand, and gravel, cemented together, is to be seen, and close by is a cutting through the embankment. The wall and upper part of the bank were cut through, in 1868, opposite the Golden Farm, and a similar construction with large stones exhibited. At H, the foundations were struck upon, in 1882, in making the railway bridge. They were composed of well-built rubble, eight feet thick, the outer facework being four feet into the road. The other foundations of the wall, discovered during the sewerage works, were eight, and those in the Tetbury and London roads ten feet thick. In the Mill walls, at I, there are several \"quadrate\" stones, as stated by Leland, and likewise in old houses, &c. , in the vicinity. From I to K, where the wall curves to the west, there is a double fosse or ditch, which must have been nearly thirty feet below the upper line of the wall when entire. At K, the fosse or vallum ceases, and a little beyond the natural stream flows within the sloping bank. Some of the faced masonry remained near K as recently as 1867, when it was removed by an enterprising builder. At L, we lose all traces for a short distance, but the wall passed through the site of the row of cottages known as the Crescent, and was evidently removed in making the lane at the back of them, as the remainder of the embankment abuts against this line on the opposite side. In the Cricklade-road were the ruins of a gate in the fourteenth century, answering to the Porta Pr\u00e6toria, for the passage of the Ermine way. Here the wall foundations were found in building the railway bridge at M, in 1882. From hence, before the alterations in making the new road adjoining the goods yard of the new line, the embankment could be traced along the northern boundary wall of the new road, Mr. Sealy's garden forming the inner slope. At N another angle is formed, and the wall curved to the north. The old fence wall, now between the gardens of the Improved Dwellings Company's houses and Concrete cottages, agrees nearly with the continuation of the Roman wall, if indeed it is not built on its foundations, and the bank slopes through 1 In some instances the vallum has been filled up and form a roadway."], [291, "THE CITY WALLS. 249 the gardens on either side as far as Caroline Cottages. Beyond School-lane it enters the Workhouse gardens. Here the only traces are a continuous mound, five or six feet high, gradually sloping both ways ; but a great part of the foundations was uncovered for Messrs. Buckman and Newmarch by the late Mr. Lane, master of the Workhouse, and at the point 0, in carrying out certain improvements, his workmen \"came in contact with several large square stones clamped together, supposed to have been the foundations of one of the towers that were seen by Leland.\"1 The next point at which remains have been found is at P, at the foot of Querns-hill, where the foundations were intersected by the sewerage pipes at an oblique angle to the road. The position of the wall is not just where it might have been expected, and suggests that as the Fosse-way to the Amphitheatre here led through the wall, that there were additional fortifications, with perhaps a postern or sally port. It is worthy of note that there is an old watercourse which may or may not be connected with the Roman works, which flows from the old Castle Meadows near the Cattle Market to Watermoor. It supplied the osier bed where the coal sidings of the G.W.R. now are, and crossing the foot of Querns-hill in a subterranean channel, ran through another osier bed between the Workhouse lane and the canal, which was converted into a stoneyard by the Town Commissioners. From thence it pursues an open course through the fields adjoining the Workhouse gardens, and until covered up a few years since for the widening of School-lane, flowed in an open current to the Siddington-road through the goods yard of the new railway. All this distance the stream runs nearly parallel with the Roman wall outside, but like the artificial channel in Grove-lane, at a distance of twenty or thirty yards from the bank. This bank ceases before reaching the Workhouse-lane, but it is probable that this lane marks the boundary of the wall. A small part of the foundations was uncovered in 1850 in what was then Mr. Newmarch's garden, at R, and the sloping inner bank is still to be seen in the adjacent ground belonging to the Independent Chapel. The foundations were uncovered by the sewerage men in Tetbury-road, at S, where was undoubtedly a gate, the Porta Dextra, for the Acman-street. From Q to S the line corresponds with that of the old borough boundary fixed in Henry IV. 's reign. The foundations at S crossed the road at a slightly oblique angle, and pointed in the direction of T, in Park-lane, where they were again cut by the sewerage workmen at a very oblique angle. No traces were found crossing Thomas-street as might have been expected, but the wall at T points to the intersection of the artificial stream at U, where it is probable there was a circular angle bastion. From thence the wall would follow the stream 1 Notes by Mr. Gael for the Ordnance Survey."], [292, "250 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. line to the Hospital Gate. Thomas-street, leading along the foot of the embankment, which probably was thrown up here as elsewhere, before its removal, and Spitalgate have, including the cartway through the Abbey grounds, occupied the space between the wall and the stream, which was then the fosse or boundary ditch. At V, just outside where the Ermine-street emerged from the town, at the Porta Decumana, was found during the sewerage works a strongly built stone chamber, ten feet long, four feet wide, and four feet deep, possibly a sentry or gatekeeper's box.. The circuit of the walls as thus described is two miles and three furlongs, and the area enclosed 240 acres. Collinson's boundary, which differs from our own between Tetbury-road and the Hospital Gate would measure two and three quarter miles, and include 295 acres. We give it in his own words, merely observing that the course extended from the Barton is not very clear, but assume that it would be along the inner b.ank of the Mill Pound to the end of Gloucester-street and Bomford's Ground, where \" the rough undulations of the surface \" are considered by Mr. Gael, in his notes for the Ordnance Survey, to indicate the presence of Roman remains : \u2014 \"From hence,\" that is, the angle at Watermoor, \" the line passes through the Workhouse gardens, Sheep-street-lane, and the Castle Fields, to the road leading to Tetbury. We now pursue it through Lord Bathurst's Park \" (in the letters between Pope and Earl Bathurst mention is made of clearing away a mound, but this may refer only to the natural ground which rises rapidly from the house westwards), \" intersecting Cecily-hill, and sweeps down to the Barton, where was the third angle of the wall, and where a tower stood as late as the reign of Charles I., probably destroyed in the Civil War. From thence it was directed eastward through the fields to the north of Lord Bathurst's mill, continued to Shepherd's-piece, and thus down the side of the Abbey wall to where the survey commenced,\" viz., the London-road. The security of Corinium was further ensured by the camps along the escarpment of the Cotswold Hills, as at Uley Bury, Painswick Beacon, Witcombe, Leckhampton, Cleeve, &c, as well as by the neighbouring outposts at Trewsbury, Bagendon, Ranbury, &c. Roads, Streets, and Watercourses. The Roman roads, with which it had such ready communica tion with all parts of the island, have already been alluded to in pp. 4, 8, and 202 ; two of the four leading highways as they existed in pre-Norman times, intersecting at the town, viz., the Fosse and the Ermine, and a branch of a third, the Ikenield, joining them. The Fosse in its entirety commenced in Cornwall, passed through Exeter, Bath, to Cirencester (so far as explained it is"], [293, "251 ROADS AND STREETS. sometimes and more correctly called the Acman-street, as the two parts are not continuous through Cirencester), and thence proceeded to Leicester, crossing the Watling-street (which led from Dover and London to the north-west of England) at High Cross, near Market Bosworth. From Leicester it leads to Newark and Lincoln, and thence to the Humber, opposite Hull. The Ermine-street commenced at St. David's, in South Wales, and led through Caerleon, Gloucester, Cirencester, and Winchester, to Southampton. The Ikenield-street, with its branches, commenced in the county of the Iceni (Norfolk and Suffolk, and East of England), crossed the Watling-street at Dunstable, and thence through Bucks and Oxon, to Cirencester. Fosbroke makes it to extend through Rodmarton, &c, to Aust Passage, on the Severn, but as it really unites with the Fosse outside Cirencester, and would have to emerge from it on the other side, this is hardly correct, even if such a Roman way can be traced. The Whiteway to Worcester, &c, is a road of less importance. These roads enable the lines of the chief thoroughfares of Corinium to be fixed with precision. Mr. T. B. Bravender, who took notes of the position of the Roman wall and likewise of the foundations of buildings and other Roman remains during the excavations for the sewerage of the town, has also given me a great deal of information respecting the lines of ancient streets in the vicinity of the New-road, where he has resided for many years, and taken a great interest in the antiquities of the town. He is able to trace a narrow Roman road on a bed of concrete from the new railway at a to the Endowed School, where he supposes that it formed the side of a square or open space, and thence from b to d. During a considerable portion of this length it passes across the existing New-road at a very acute angle. At d it leaves the New-road, and whatever traces there may be between there and Lewis-lane, Mr. Bravender has no knowledge of, but at h in the Bull-yard, a bit of road, evidently a continuation, has been found. This street, it may be noted, is almost parallel with that of the Ermine-way, to be described below. Referring to the sewerage excavation, Mr. Bravender has written \" When the drainers, coming from the South, approached the new Schools, they did not find foundations or Roman remains, which is remarkable, as there are generally so many in this neighbourhood, and it is difficult to find a space free from them. On passing b they got amongst foundations again, and found a great many pins, brooches, coins, remains of pavements and pieces of pottery, and continued discovering Roman remains until they arrived opposite the Talbot at /. They then entered and ex cavated a dark soil without Roman remains, and continued in this to the bottom of Dyer-street at g. It is possible there was water from f to g in Roman times, extending east to the Churn. II"], [294, "252 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. Though, as before mentioned, the absence of Roman remains and undisturbed appearances of the soil was noticed near b the surrounding neighbourhood was a great deal built upon. The Firs is on the site of a Roman house, and when the foundations were dug up a portion of a pavement was found with the figure of a bird in the centre. It was left and covered up, and is now about a yard under the tiles of the present hall. Pavements and foundations were also found to the south, west, and north, but not on the east side that I remember. From the absence of Roman remains between The Firs and the School it is possible that there may have been an open space in Roman times. Some large stones and pillars were found a little to the north of The Firs, which may have been the remains of a Roman temple at the north-west corner or side of the open space ; sufficient, however, has not been discovered to make this more than conjecture.\" Mr. Bravender suggests, on a plan prepared by him for the author, that the points i, e, and c, where, we understand, that bits of ancient road have been found, were connected by streets directly with the open space at b, but these points are all on the line of the great Ermine-way or nearly so, and the directions they would take are inconsistent with the regular and rectangular character of Roman towns and with the lines of walls and foundations discovered in Chester-street, which are invariably at right angles or else parallel to the Ermine-way, and the line of street from a to b, d, and h. The line from b to c would intersect certain of these walls found in Chester-street, and we believe that the streets shown on the map in this work as connecting the Ermine way and the street a, b, d, h, will be found to include all traces of roads in this locality, including some on the line between b and c. The Ermine-way entered the town at the gate which formerly stood in the Watermoor-road, about where the new Railway Bridge now is, if indeed the foundation discovered in making the bridge was not a part of the old gate foundation. It then proceeded directly through the town, emerging by a gate at one end of Gloucester-street. It would pass through or near i, e, and c. Traces of it or a. road connected with it were found in 1864 at j, in the late Mr. D. Smith's garden, where, close at hand, were the remains of a Roman well, villa, and tesselated pavement. Tesselated pavements were also found some years ago in the garden of The Firs, and in that of one of the houses in Chester street, all about equi-distant from this line of street. This important road has been further traced along the eastern side of Tower-street, where, in building the houses about twenty years ago, parallel grooved stones intended for the wheels of carts to run in were found, and the same occurred in Gloucester-street. These stones would only be laid on the main roads, for the ordinary thoroughfares appear to have been little designed for vehicular traffic, the foot paths being generally well raised on either side,"], [295, "253 STREETS AND WATERCOURSES. but frequently the roadway was made with a channel or waterway down the centre so as to carry off the surface water, with stepping stones at intervals across the road between the foot paths.1 Leland (Itin., vol. 5) refers to these channels in Cirencester, of which there must have been evident traces in his time (see p. 184). \" Be lykelehod yn times past cuttes were made that partes of Churne streame might cum thown the citte and so to returne to their grate bottome.\" Leland's suggestion that artificial watercourses were made in early times is not only correct in respect to the channels which flowed along the streets, but the branches of the Churn as they now flow through and near the town have been diverted. The view taken by Rudder, and adopted by other historians, that the natural stream flowed directly along the line of Gloucester and Cricklade streets to Watermoor, is incorrect. The late Mr. Bravender, sen., who made a careful study for years of the water supply, geological formation, and levels of the ground, in connec tion with his professional career, has demonstrated beyond all question that the Churn stream flowing through Bomford's Ground and St. John's Meadow is the natural current. In the Abbey Grounds it was joined by the \" Duntisbourne \" or Daglingworth stream, which takes its course past the Barton Mills and along what is now known as the Gunstoole Brook. The mill pound from the end of Gloucester-street to the Barton, the stream from the Gunstoole Brook at the back of Thomas street and along Spitalgate-lane to the Abbey Grounds, and that which flows by the Grove-lane to the New Mills and Watermoor are artificial. The original Churn stream has probably been straightened in St. John's Meadow, and utilised further on in the formation of the Abbey ponds, so that at present the only connection with the old Gunstoole Brook (which has been covered up from the foot of Cecily-hill to the lower end of the Church yard) is by a sluice. The united streams meander through the meadows east of the New-road, and receive the high level artificial cut which flows through the New Mills at the lower end of Watermoor. Returning to the streets, the regular plan of the ancient city has been made apparent by all buildings which have been found, the walls of the large building discovered in Dyer-street in 1849 having similar bearings to those already referred to in the New road, and the same appears to have been the case with the road and buildings at Messrs. Croome's warehouse (see Rudder), all of which cut Dyer-street at an oblique angle, and is notably so with 1 The country roads were generally drained at the side and raised in the centre, as modern roads are supposed to be.

As, for instance, besides the bits of wall crossed throughout the streets of the town, a wall of 150 feet in length was found in the Watermoor-road, opposite the Church, which in its day probably faced a street corresponding with this portion of the road, and nearly parallel with the Ermine-way. A wall in Castle-street, 170 feet long, in front of the Bank and Post Office, ran parallel to the Acman-street or continuation of the Tetbury-road to the Market-place. The long wall foundations in Cricklade-street mark the close proximity of a street uniting with the Watermoor-road. The old thoroughfares which appear to be retained in the modern town are Lewis and Querns lanes, Gloucester and Dollar streets to the Church, Thomas and Sheep streets along the foot of the inner slope of the wall, parts of Cricklade-street and Watermoor-road to the Schools, and possibly Coxwell-street parallel to the Gunstoole Brook. The present Market-place, at the junction of the Ermine-way and Acman-street, may have been the site of the Forum. Stukeley considers that the Pr\u00e6torium stood in what is now Messrs. Jefferies' Nursery, near the junction of the Ermine and Fosse ways, from the central position and the discovery of capitals and bases of columns, stone friezes, &c, evidently parts of a large building or buildings. His conjecture has been accepted as probable by Rudder and the authors of Roman Art. It is impossible, however, to determine much with absolute certainty with available information ; had correct records been kept in the past more would have been known of the plan and character of Corinium. We can only hope that in the future all remains brought to light may be carefully recorded. It is at present uncertain as to how much of the space within the walls was built upon. The modern town now occupies as great an area as the old enclosure, if we take into account the straggling suburban parts, but not being entirely coincident with it, there are certain parts within the wall which for generations have lain undisturbed as meadow and pasture, as the Abbey Estate, Ashcroft, the Watermoor Vicarage field, and the land east of the New-road, the last named of which we agree with Mr. Bravender in considering as having been unoccupied by houses, and subject to inundations ; of this character, too, was the field between the New-road and New Mills, cut by the Midland and South Western Junction Railway, which was found during its construction to consist of a thick bed of clay underlying the surface soil. In Roman cities a space was left adjoining the walls, called the Pom\u0153rium, and considered sacred. Burial Places. It is worthy of note that the monumental stones, stone coffins, urns, lachrymatories, &c, discovered about Corinium were always"], [297, "BURIAL PLACES. 255 found adjacent to the leading and consequently most frequented highways, and within a short distance outside the walls. They were thus placed to remind the passer by of the shortness of human life and evanescence of worldly pleasures, and hence the frequent occurrence of the words SISTE VIATOR \u2014 ASPICE VIATOR, at the head of tomb stones. Several of these memorials of the dead have been unearthed at the Querns and adjoining the Tetbury-road. At Watermoor and Kingsmead, within a few yards of the Ermine-street, and a stone coffin in the garden of Querns-hill, close to the line of street leading to the amphitheatre, possibly the scene of many gladiatorial shows and tragic encounters. Referring to Roman burial places, Mr. Adams writes : \" The places for burial were either private or public \u2014 the private in fields or gardens, usually near the highway to be conspicuous, and to remind those who passed of mortality.\" Burton's Antiquities (vol. 1, p. 272) contains the following : \" Most of the roads leading out of ancient towns are lined with tombs ; and if such a spectacle can ever be said to form a pleasing view we have an instance of it at Pompeii, where the street of the tombs is one of the most interesting objects in this extra ordinary place. Near to Pozzuoli (Puteoli) on the Via Campana, we have an instance of the frequency of tombs on the roads to cities. Going from Rome also, through any of the gates at the east end of the town, we find ruins of similar edifices.\" Several memorial inscriptions are to be seen on the Via Appia, &c. The Querns has been already described (p. 183 and 187) with Leland's remarks. The hillocks or mounds are from ten to thirty feet high, and extend over twenty-six acres. Amongst themisa large barrow which has been explored at different times, and found to contain skeletons arranged east and west, according to the usual custom observed in British sepulture. From the numerous urns, coffins, and skeletons found here and at Watermoor at different times, but more particularly here, it is fair to assume that these places were the public burial places in addition to the roads leading to them during the Roman and Romano-British times. The name Querns, which some have supposed to be a corruption of Quarries \u2014 in the vernacular of the district, Quarrs \u2014 has, with greater probability, been derived from Cairns or Carned1 \u2014 the British name for a heap of stones thrown up as a memorial of the dead, or to mark a particular spot or notable occurrence. There are generally Cairns on the summits of our highest mountains. The Roman method of burial amongst the higher classes was by cremation, the bones and ashes being placed in an urn, and where greater care was evinced the urn was deposited in a 1 Several Welsh Hills have this prefix \u2014 as Carned Dafydd and Llewellyn, in Caernarvonshire."], [298, "256 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. sarcophagus, a cylindrical shaped stone, chiselled out to receive the urn, and covered with a thick flat stone of the same torm. Sometimes lachrymatories or tear bottles were placed with tne urn. Several of all these have been found at Cirencester, especially in this locality, and some are placed in the Museum, where there is a sarcophagus of the kind referred to. Iwo sarcophagi discovered near the Amphitheatre were in the possession of the late Mr. T. C. Brown, of Further Barton. In the following instance, in which we quote Rudder, more than ordinary care was exhibited for the preservation of the ashes of the deceased :\u2014 \" There was also a glass urn of a green colour dug up about the same time (1760-70) in Kingsmead, about half a mile from the town wall, on the same side. This urn, which contained much ashes, and many pieces of burnt bones, was placed in the cavity of a stone, chiselled out to receive it, and a flat stone covered the top. All these were deposited in the midst of a piece of ground about twenty feet square, and inclosed with a stone wall which lay below the surface of the ground ; and they were further secured by a pavement springing from the wall on every side, and rising in the middle over the urn, in the form of a very obtuse cone. These were undoubtedly Roman, but unaccompanied with coins, unless the workmen concealed them on the first discovery.\" Funeral urns have also been found, amongst other places at Grismund's Tower, which is a large mound or tumulus twenty feet high, in Earl Bathurst's Park, just outside the walls and adjacent to the Acman-street. It was converted by the first Earl into an ice house, but, according to Rudder, had been opened several years before, and was found to contain several very large urns and burnt bones : the ground adjacent exhibiting marks of fire. Leland (Itin. v. 65) writes : \" Sum say that it (i.e. the Querns) was the place where Sege was laide to the town, and not far thens is a steepe round Biry like a Wind Myl Hill extra muros (i.e. without the walls) cawlled Grismunde's Tower for Gusmundes Tower as theie say. \" William of Worcester's tradition that King Arthur was crowned at it (see p. 11).

Two small coffins in the Museum were found in 1867, in making the Cattle Market. In one was an ointment vessel or unguentarium. Several urns, &c. were also found there. Another coffin, before referred to, as in the garden of Querns-hill, and another in the grounds of Cirencester House, opened by per mission of Earl Bathurst, August 27, 1877, and found to contain the \" skeleton of a Roman female, which is now in the University Museum at Oxford.\"1 Skeletons have been found at the Barton and elsewhere, a little beneath the surface, probably of those killed in the siege of the town by Prince Rupert ; but those of five men together, found about thirty-five years since at the Querns, are supposed to have been British. They were probably killed in an encounter, and from the circumstance that the bodies were flexible and bent, they would appear to have been buried immediately after death. Monumental Stones, Inscriptions, &c. Dr. Stukeley (1723) writes: \u2014 \"We saw a monumental inscription upon a stone of Mr. Isaac Tibbot's (now Mr. J. P. Beecham's), in Castle-street, in very large letters, four inches long,\" as follows : \u2014 D \u2022 M IVLIAE GAST\u00c6 CONIVGI \u2022 VIX ANN \u2022 XXXIII i.e., of Julia, the wife of Casta ; she lived 33 years. This stone, which was for many years placed in the garden wall of the same house, but is now in the Museum, was found at the Querns. Stukeley goes on to say : \u2014 \"Five such stones lay flatwise upon two walls, in a row, end to end, and underneath were the corpses of that family, as we may suppose. He (Mr. Tibbot) keeps Julia Casta's skull in his summer house1, but people have stolen all her teeth out for amulets against the ague. Another of the stones serves for a table in his garden ; 'tis handsomely squared, five feet long and three and a half broad, without any inscription. Another is laid for a bridge over a channel near the Cross in Castle-street. There were but two of them which had inscriptions, the other inscription perished, being unluckily exposed to the wet in a frosty season, probably of the husband.

Lying by this stone was an urn with ashes and bones half burnt. In July, 1835, in digging the foundation of a house for a Mr. Paine, also at Watermoor, just outside the wall, a splendid memorial stone, 7 feet by 2\u00a3 feet, with an equestrian soldier riding over his prostrate foe, and transfixing him with his spear, carved in rude alto relievo. The inscription runs thus : \u2014 DANN1CVS-EOVES-AIAE INDI AN-TVR-ALBANI STIP-XVI -Cl VES-RAVR CVR-' FVLVIVS NAT A LIS -IT FLAVIVS BITVCVS-ER -TESTAME H-S-E i.e., Dannicus eques ai\u00e6 (?al\u00e6) Indian\u00e6, turm\u00e6 Albani stipendiorum sedecem, civis Rauricus Curaverunt Fulvius Natalis it (?et; Flavius Bitucus heredes testamentarii hie situs est.

In 1836, two other memorial stones were found close by the preceding.

He is buried here. His heir took care that this monument should be erected. The carving in the pediment of this stone resembles that in the monument of Dannicus, and represents an equestrian group, with a spear being thrust through the prostrate foe. The other monumental stone, found July 1st, 1836, was obtained by the late Mr. P. B. Purnell, of Stancombe Park, and has been presented by his daughter to the Museum at- Gloucester. It is the memorial of a civilian, standing, clothed in a toga or large cloak, under a canopy supported by fluted pilasters.

There are also in the Cirencester Museum some other parts of inscribed stones and the united fragments of a Roman altar, discovered in Sheep-street, neaily opposite the Cottage Hospital, in September, 1880, bearing the inscription, somewhat defaced, G \u2022 S \u25a0 H V \u2022 I \u25a0 S L O C - i.e., Genio Sacrum hujus loci, or, Sacred to the genius of this place.

The stone had been struck with a sledge hammer by one of the men employed on the sewerage works, and would have been utterly lost, had not Mr. Christopher Bowly with great care collected the scattered pieces from cart loads of stones.

In December, 1847, in carrying out certain work at the Querns by Mr. Easton, then a resident in the town, a large stone coffin, seven feet six inches long outside and six feet eleven inches by one foot six inches inside, with no extra width for the shoulders, was found. There was no body in it, and it was conjectured that this had been destroyed by the flow of water. Three cylindrical sepulchral stones, twelve inches wide inside, were found at the same time, two with urns and one without ; also, some human bones, Roman pottery, and a tombstone inscribed : \u2014 D \u2022 M CAST CASTREN VN The Gentleman's Magazine (1842) names a perfect skeleton discovered in Gloucester-street, five or six feet below ground, with the head to the east, with two nails two to three inches long driven into the place of the right ear.

This is one of the most perfect examples of its kind in the kingdom, and is similar in construction to those of Dorchester and Silchester, and the smaller ones of Ilchester and Old Sarum. It has been formed by utilising the soil and refuse from the adjacent quarries to construct the embankments which enclose the arena where the gladiatorial combats took place. This arena is level and of an elliptical form, the major axis being about 150 feet, and the minor axis 130 feet in length. At the ends of the longer diameter are openings about 28 feet wide, and there is an underground passage between stone walls 1\\ feet asunder through the embankment on the south side which points to the centre of the arena. This passage has been blocked up for many years. It is considered by Rudder to have been of late addition, but is far more likely to be the passage which led to the Spoliarium, to which those who were killed or mortally wounded were dragged by a hook. The height of the embankments, which must have contained, when perfect, about 50,000 cubic yards of material, is 24 feet 6 inches from the arena, and 40 feet above the ground on the south side. The length of the embankments and arena through the openings is 328 feet ; the width between the top of the embankments 270 feet, and the extreme width between the outside feet of the slopes about 400 feet. The inner faces of the embankments were originally stepped to from seats for the spectators, but the traces of these have been almost effaced. The seats were probably of wood or stone laid on the bare earth and bedded in mortar. It is possible that the entrances were of stone, but if so all remains have long since disappeared. In continental"], [303, "261 PUBLIC BUILDINGS IN CORINIUM. cities amphitheatres were frequently handsome erections of masonry fitted up in the most elaborate style. Of this class were the great Coliseum at Rome, and the amphitheatres of Nismes and Verona, but those in Britain were never anything more than earthwork structures. The Cirencester amphitheatre is locally known as the Bull Ring, from the disgraceful custom of bull baiting in \" the good old times.\" In recent years the Primitive Methodists have held Camp Meetings on its banks, and about 1742 the celebrated George Whitfield preached here to a large assemblage. Public Buildings in Corinium. We are dependent for our knowledge of the public buildings of Corinium upon the scanty relics discovered in recent times, which have survived the destructive and utilitarian propensities of our forefathers. For at least a thousand years after the Saxon occupation no attempts were made to preserve them, aud it has only been within the lifetime of the present generation that their value has been appreciated, as illustrating the customs of a people to whom, in spite of all that was cruel and revolting in them and their religion, Europe was so vastly indebted for instruction in the arts of civilization. Dr. Stukeley, who visited the town about 1723, laments this disregard of their antiquities by the townsmen. \"Large quantities of carved stones (he says) are carried off yearly in carts (meaning from the Nursery district) to mend the highways, besides what are useful in building ; \" and Mr. Gael censures the local gentry and inhabitants for permitting so much to be destroyed previous to the interest awakened by the publication of Messrs. Buckman and Newmarch's work. It is fair to conclude, however, from Henry of Huntingdon's writing of it as having been a most excellent city, that Cirencester retained in the 12th century many remains of its early magnificence, and we may with justice apply to it the description of Caerleon, by Giraldus Cambrensis, derived from his personal inspection at the same period. He writes that Caerleon was \"elegantly built by the Romans with brick walls. Many vestiges of its ancient splendour still remain, and stately palaces which formerly with the gilt tiles displayed the Roman grandeur. It was first built by the Roman nobility, and adorned with sumptuous edifices, with a lofty tower, curious hot baths, temples now in ruins, and theatres encompassed with stately walls, in part yet standing. The walls are three miles in circumference, and within as well as without subterraneous buildings are frequently met with as aqueducts, vaults, hypocausts, stoves, &c.\" The column to which the portion of the shaft and base belonged, which is now in the south arcade of the Chancel of the Parish Church, must have been about thirty feet high, and therefore have supported a building of large proportions, possibly a heathen temple, but more probably, as suggested by"], [304, "262 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. Sir G. G. Scott, a basilica or hall for the administration of justice. These basilic\u00e6 adjoined or enclosed the Forum, which we have previously suggested occupied the site of the present Market place. The column is not actually \" in situ,\" but probably the basilica of which it was a part stood on the site of the Church, and on the introduction of Christianity became the first Christian Church. Mr. Bravender suggests that a temple stood near his house (see p. 252), and there were undoubtedly many shrines in Corinium to the numerous deities included in Roman mythology, some more and some less architecturally important. The Dyer street villa must have been no ordinary dwelling, but the place from which the most important architectural remains have been discovered is Messrs.' Jefferies' Nursery, between Tower and Corin streets and the Watermoor-road. Here there is scarcely a square foot of ground where coins, pottery, and minor articles have not been found, and adjacent to their greenhouses on the south side still exist, covered over with soil, the remains of a building which has attracted much attention. This building, of which we shall have to give more detailed particulars, is a hypocaust, or chamber for generating heat. Several of these hot air chambers have been found beneath the tesselated pavements of ordinary dwelling-houses, but this, from its extent, probably belonged to the therm\u00e6, or public baths, as suggested by Sir Robert Atkyns. The baths of Roman cities were generally splendid structures, and fitted with everything necessary for the full enjoyment of this luxury ; and that this spot was the site of something more than an ordinary dwelling is further evidenced by the discovery of portions of columns, friezes, &c, unfortunately destroyed, except a handsome Corinthian capital, discovered in 1808, of the ordinary type, with two tiers of acanthus leaves on each face surrounding the bell. It measures nearly four feet across from corner to corner, and therefore must have belonged to a column about 25 feet in height, exclusive of pedestals, if such existed. This capital is figured in the Arch\u00e6ologia, vol. xviii., and is the subject of a paper read before the Society of Antiquarians, by the late Mr. S. Lysons. The lower part of another Corinthian capital, and the abacus of another, were found near the same spot, June 22, 1838; they belonged to columns of equal dimensions with the preceding, and were almost certainly part of the same edifice. These stones have been placed together, and to a casual observer would appear as parts of the same capital, but a closer inspection would show that although similar in style they are of slightly different design. The lower stone forming the neck of the capital contains the usual acanthus leaves, and springing from them on each face are indications of the busts of human figures, one that of a female, the others too indistinct to be determined. The upper part, or abacus, is one foot nine inches high and four feet six inches from"], [305, "PUBLIC BUILDINGS IN CORINIUM. 263 corner to corner. On each face are the heads and busts of four figures, life sized, with head ornaments nearly level with the top of the abacus : \u2014 1 . A fine masculine head, with close curled hair parted in front, and a close fitting cap. A flat semi-circular objects rests against the left arm, probably a tambourine. This figure is supposed to be intended for Bacchante. 2. The youthful Bacchus, a handsome youth with a bunch of grapes on either side, one held in the right hand, the arm having an armilla or bracelet ; the tunic hangs from the left shoulder, behind which is a sceptre. 3. A male head wrinkled with age, intended for Silenus, the god of the woods, who is sounding a curved horn which he holds in his right hand. The smaller end of the horn is ornamented with the figure of a goat's head. 4. The Bearded Bacchus, representing the god of wine, as a man of resolute character, with flowing hair, beard, and moustache. Over the right shoulder is a bipennis or double-faced axe, whilst the left holds a bunch of grapes. These capitals prove that Dr. Stukeley's enthusiasm had not led him to exaggeration when, in alluding to the locality where they were found, he penned the following : \u2014 \" In the same place they found several stones of the shafts of pillars, six feet long, and bases of stone near as big in compass as his summer house adjoining \" (as Mr. Bishop, owner of the garden, expressed himself). \" These, with cornices very handsomely moulded, and carved with medallions and like ornaments, were converted into swine troughs. Some of the stones of the bases were fastened together with cramps of iron, so that they were forced to employ horses to draw them asunder, and they now lie before the door of his house as a pavement. Capitals of these pillars were likewise found, and a crooked cramp of iron, 10 or 12 feet long, which probably was for the architraves of a circular portico. A mosaic pavement near it, and entire, is now the floor of his privy vault.\" This account of the Doctor's is further interesting as showing that the Romans adopted a similar method of construction to ourselves in the masonry of buildings of this class. A very large handsome capital was found some years since when digging the foundation of a house at the corner of Chester street for the late Mr. W. H. Sealy, and was placed in his garden. It is much to be regretted that both this and those in the Abbey grounds, which must necessarily suffer from the weather, have not been placed in the. Museum, where visitors to the town would have the advantage of seeing their beauties. Several smaller capitals, bases and portions of smaller columns have been found, and some of these are preserved in the Museum. In some instances the orders are not truly delineated in these fragments. There are there six miniature composite capitals, two terminal stones, fragments of boldly carved cornices and several carved busts and figures, one of which, a figure of Mercury"], [306, "264 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. in relief under an arched canopy, calls for notice, as well as a group of three female figures sitting. A small Corinthian capital, belonging to a column nine inches in diameter, in excellent preservation, and a finely carved head two feet high, probably the keystone of an arch, were also found in the Nursery near the large capitals. The head referred to was purchased by the late P. B. Purnell, Esq., of Stancomb Park. We now come to the hypocaust. This is undoubtedly the building which, according to a MS. seen by Rudder, was discovered in 1683, and of which Sir Robert Atkyns writes, probably after personal inspection : \u2014 \" There was accidentally discovered in a meadow near the town, an antient building under ground. It was 50 foot long and 40 broad, and about 4 foot high, supported by 100 brick pillars, inlaid very curiously with tesseraick work, with stones of divers colours, little bigger than dice. It is supposed to have been a bathing place of the Romans.\" Then Dr. Stukeley writes : \" A fine mosaic pavement was dug up here in September, 1723, with many coins. I bought a little head, which had been broken off from a basso-relievo, and seems by the tiara, of a very odd shape, like fortification work, to have been the genius of a city, or some of the De\u00e6 Malres which are in old inscriptions. The gardener told me he had lately found a little brass image, I suppose one of the Lares, but upon diligent scrutiny his children had played it away. Mr. Richard Bishop, owner of the garden, on a hillock near his house, dug up a vault, sixteen feet long, and twelve broad, supported with square pillars of Roman brick, three feet and a half high, and on it a strong floor of terras. There are now several more vaults near it, on which grow cherry trees, like the hanging gardens of Babylon.\" We conclude from this that the remains had been covered up, and there was no access to them when Stukeley visited the spot; had he seen them his opinion that they belonged to the floor of a temple may have been different. The hypocaust from that time seems to have passed out of mind, and the site was forgotten until 1780, when some workmen engaged in the garden, who had heard frequent \" strange stories of coins and other curiosities having been found in abundance hereabout, and digging upon a spot about sixteen yards from a wich elm then growing in the south-west wall, turned up several flat bricks, very unlike any they had ever seen before. This awakened their curiosity and attention, and clearing away the earth with some care and caution, to make an opening, in search of things still more curious and valuable, at the depth of about three feet and a half below the surface, they came to a very smooth floor of terras, made of coarse strong mortar.\" The rubbish being cleared from this floor in a north easterly direction, it was found to be broken away, and after cleaning the earth a lower floor, 4| feet below the surface of the first, and extending underneath it, was found,"], [307, "265 TESSELATED PAVEMENTS. It was also continued in a north easterly direction beyond the broken edge of the above 15 feet, and formed a room about 30 feet by 20. The upper floor was supported on the lower by rows of pillars (22 of which then remained), each of which was composed of 12 tiles 8 inches square, and cap and base tiles 11 inches square in addition. The walls enclosing the space were about 3 feet thick ; in one of them were two small arches, the intrados of which only appeared a little above the floor, and this peculiarity led to a search for further discoveries, which resulted in that of another or third floor 34 inches below the preceding, the space between them having been filled up with loose stones. Both this and the floor above were partially lined with a 2-inch bed of wood ashes, evidently the result of long continued fires. A hole was made through one of the walls, which was 40 inches thick, to ascertain whether the walls and buildings extended beyond, and it was found that they did. If the unexplored part were equal in dimensions to the explored, the total outside measurement would be about 49 by 36 feet, or nearly the size stated by Sir R. Atkyns. There were some other arches and the quoins of a door which may have belonged to an entrance between the upper rooms over the heating chamber. Rudder gives a drawing, and Mr. Carter, in his \" Antiquities,\" has produced a complete set of details to scale from measurements taken by himself in 1788. To these we must refer the reader for more complete information. The remains of the hypocaust were propped up and covered over, but the site may be seen and additional facts elicited by a visit to the Nursery. Rudder considers that it was not the hypocaust of the public baths, but of a private dwelling, but the size forbids this conclusion, as it is hardly possible to conceive of a house requiring so much heat as from the character of the remains as given by Rudder, after personally examining them, was evidently generated here. The conclusion of Sir Robert Atkyns is probably the correct one. Tesselated Pavements. Leland, Hearne, Atkyns, and Stukeley all mention the discovery of tesselated pavements in Cirencester, the first named of a \" flore de tessellis versicoloribus,\" or a tesselated floor of different colours, discovered in a meadow in the midst of the old town. Stukeley names a very fine one discovered in September, 1723. Since his time a great number have been found ; some have been destroyed, but others, and we are pleased to add, the best, have been preserved, and of these, and such of the remainder of which any records exist, we shall endeavour to give brief but reliable particulars. The first named by Rudder was a very fine one, which he states on reliable information was dug up in the last century in"], [308, "266 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. the garden of the house formerly known as Archibald's, and another in digging the vault under the shambles of the Boothall. According to another historian this was found in 1750. The next having been seen by Rudder is described in his own words, but its unfortunate destruction from want of sufficient care for its preservation is much to be regretted. \" One of them was discovered in May, 1777, in digging a cellar under the present warehouse of Messrs. Robert and William Croome, in Dyer-street. It was about 16 or 18 feet square, of which the workmen had destroyed nearly half before it was observed. The remainder was in good preservation, and being well cleansed, was exposed for a few days to public view. It had a chequered border round it, of 14 inches breadth, composed of blue and white stones of about three-quarters of an inch square. The pavement was divided into four equal compartments, by the artful arrangement and disposition of the different coloured materials', into lines of hearts linked together, or rather interlaced fretwise, which had a very pretty effect. There was a central piece, consisting of an octagon wreathed border, inclosing a star with wavy rays, directed to the angles of the octagon ; and it had also a small figure, of the same kind, in the middle of each compartment. All besides, within the borders and compartments, consisted of chequered work, composed of square blue and white stones and red bricks, but much smaller than those of which the borders consisted. The whole together resembled a rich carpet, the first idea of which was most probably suggested by a work of this kind. Mr. Croome had the central piece taken up, and it remained for some time entire at the entrance into the garden from his dwelling-house, where it served for a part of the pavement ; but being much exposed to the weather, it was gradually broken and destroyed. The pavement, which lay about six feet below the surface of the street, was accompanied by the plastered Walls of the room to which it belonged, and which evidently appeared to have been painted ; but the figures were so decayed, perhaps fourteen hundred years old, that no idea of the subject could be formed. It is very remarkable that the side of the pavement which had the smallest obliquity with Dyer-street formed an angle with it of about 30 degrees. Eight or ten yards north-eastward of this pavement the workmen found an old road upon a level with it, and running parallel with two sides of it.\" Another of these pavements was discovered in digging a cellar to a house in the same street, formerly belonging to the George family, and now known as Gloucester House, in 1783. This pave ment is delineated by Rudder in the edition of his work published in 1800, and it is now made clear that it belonged to the splendid Roman villa discovered in 1849. It is still preserved in the cellar of Gloucester House, and represents a series of inhabitants"], [309, ".\u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 . Tesselated Pavement discovered at N\u00b0 93, Dyer Street, Cirencester. A.D.I820."], [310, ""], [311, "TESSELATED PAVEMENTS. 267 of the deep, some not unfaithful portraitures of well known marine animals in their natural element, including fish, the conger eel, a shrimp, crab, whelk, barnacle, and bivalve shell ; others decidedly conventional, as the sea leopard chasing a fish, and a sea horse turning round and suspiciously regarding a creature of which the snout alone remains, but which was probably a crocodile. The tail and lower part of the trunk of a large fish remains on the left side, and to the right is the head and upper part of a dolphin ridden by a Cupid; both these are partly destroyed ; in the right hand upper comer is another Cupid pushing the wheel of a chariot, which may have been that of Neptune, and if so, almost certainly formed the centre piece. When complete, the pavement must have belonged to a good sized apartment, and have been a clever and most interesting delineation of marine objects. Slight -traces of the border remain, which was a blue labyrinthine fret on a white ground. Rudder gives a drawing of this pavement in his history, and Mr. S. Lysons in The Reliqui\u00e6 Britannico-Roman\u00e6, vol. ii. plate 7. The tessell\u00e6 are laid in the hard setting cement, with the com position of which the Romans were so familiar, on a 41--inch bed of fine concrete, consisting of pounded brick, lime, and sand, and 6 inches of concrete of gravel, lime, sand, broken tiles, and rubbish, the whole resting on ballast or rammed gravel. This pavement is supposed to have belonged to the large villa discovered in Dyer-street, between the Ship Inn and Messrs. Moulder and Orum's shop, in 1849, and there can be little doubt that the same villa extended under the house opposite, No. 93, Dyer-street, as the walls were found in 1849 to extend to the front of it, and, in 1820, a pavement was discovered in the same house, then occupied by Mr. Jenkins, cheese factor. Of this pavement no notice has been taken by the authors of \" Roman Art,\" nor by any other writer that we are aware of, and except for a rough drawing in the possession of Mr. Christopher Bowly all knowledge of it must have soon ceased. We presume that, unless deliberately destroyed \u2014 'which is not likely \u2014 that no attempts were made to remove it, but that it was covered over almost as soon as found, and that consequently its existence was not generally known. The subject is that of Orpheus by his sweet strains charming the animal creation, a very favourite one with Roman artists ; and represented on the Barton pavement, found in 1825 ; on the pavement at Withington, eight miles from Cirencester, which is in the British Museum ; and on the magnificent pavement at Woodchester, near Stroud. In each of these pavements he is drawn on a medallion in the centre, surrounded by rings or zones on which the birds and beasts march with measured tread to the music of his lyre. In this instance, like the Woodchester, his figure does not fill the central space as it does in the Barton pavement, but he is placed LL"], [312, "268 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. on the lower edge, above him being a figure, probably of Neptune, holding in one hand a dart and in the other something like a flag, intended, we presume, for his trident. This representation does not do much honour to the sea-god, who is anything but a dignified looking being, and instead of legs is accommodated with a pair of what appear to be fish's tails, which, we doubt not, would be more favourable for rapid locomotion in his element than human legs. Besides Orpheus and Neptune there are faint figures of two dogs and pieces of sea-weed (?) in this space. Birds alternating with trees appear on the first girdle and include the peacock and his mate, pheasant, partridge, duck, and turkey, if we rightly interpret the artist's intentions. The next circle has a triple series of the olive-coloured bay leaf ornament with a buff border line on a bright red ground, around which six beasts of the forest march in solemn order, apparently intended for the elephant, lion, leopard, bear, puma, and tiger. These are enclosed within a circular fret border of green, buff, red, and black. The spandrels are filled up with classic ornament, of which in each a star is the central feature. The outside borders consist of two wide inner bands, and three narrow outer ones. The innermost band, if correctly represented, is divided by lines into squares and oblongs, filled in with lozenge shaped and other geometrical figures, with pater\u00e6 in the corners, and a labyrinthine fret device in the centre of each side. The next band has a regular pattern, which may be a cable or a guilloche incorrectly drawn, but differs materially from either. The character of the pattern is classic, but it does not occur in any other pavement or border that we are acquainted with. The small outer bands call for no special notice. The Barton pavement, close to the residence of Mr. R. A. Anderson, formed the floor of a room about 21 feet square. A building was erected over it when discovered by the third Earl Bathurst, but it suffered much on being disturbed from the roots of a walnut tree, which by their pressure caused the pavement to yield and break in pieces, and to render what remains very uneven. Some was destroyed when first uncovered, and we regret to say that it has since suffered in its colours from the effects of damp and exposure. It has many points of resemblance to the pavement the drawing of which we have described, the birds represented round the centre medallion are similar in each, and enclosed in both by the band of bay leaves, with the animals stealthily marching round with the same measured step in the outer border. The same dwarf trees appear in the girdles, and the spandrels in the Barton pavement are also filled up with conventional leaves, but without the stars. In the Barton pavement, when complete, there must have, been the same number of animals, but only four, the lion, tiger, leopard, and another remains, and these are not perfect ; of birds, there must"], [313, "TESSELATED PAVEMENTS. 269 have been at least eight instead of six, including the peacock, pheasant, duck, &c, as before. The figure of Orpheus is better in the Barton, but in both he is represented with the Phrygian cap, the toga, and tunic, with the lyre resting on the right knee in the one and on the left knee in the other. In the Barton pavement the outer circular border is a double twisted guilloche, which unites with a similar border on the square. A wide square margin completes the design, consisting of stars, lovers' knots, and other figures geometrically placed, enclosed within a narrow cable pattern band. The next pavement, in order of time, is one found in 1837, in the grounds of the late Mr. Thomas Brewin, in Querns-lane. A building is erected over it for its protection, but it was much mutilated when discovered. From what remains it is evident that it was purely geometrical in design, and thus similar in character to the one found sixty years before at Messrs. Croome's warehouse. The centre medallion contains the conventional flower with four heart shaped petals springing from a -centre like a cross. This appears in several other pavements. The guilloche border is likewise introduced. The next brought to light were the celebrated pavements discovered in digging for a sewer in Dyer-street, in 1849, the first in the month of August, which belonged to a room about 15 feet square, the second and larger one, which covered a room nearly 25 feet square, in the following month, through a trial hole having first been sunk outside the line of the sewer. A great deal of the first was destroyed before its nature was ascertained, and the second is incomplete in consequence of its extending beneath the foundations of Gloucester House. As both of the pavements are now in excellent preservation in the Museum, the reader may inspect them for himself. The short description here given will enable him to understand the details more readily. Like the Barton and the pavements under the houses adjoining them (discovered in 1783 and 1820), both of these belong to the class known as magalographia, that is, they have representatives of living creatures upon them, generally intended to represent some mythological subject. They are, however, essentially geometrical, and each subject and device is depicted on the surface of a geometrical figure. The general design of the smaller pavement consists of a central circular medallion, connected with each of the sides with a semicircle and quadrants in the corner, all being struck with equal radii. The subject portrayed in the centre is a hunting scene, but a great part has been destroyed. The filling in of one of the semicircles has been effaced, but it was probably similar to that opposite, in which is a piece of sea-weed, conven tionally treated as a scroll within a twisted stem and escalloped border. In the side semicircles are a sea-dragon and sea-leopard, each chasing a fish. In the left hand upper quadrant is the head"], [314, "270 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. of a Medusa,1 with wild horrent hair. A similar head was probably repeated in the right hand corner. The lower quadrants are each filled up with conventional devices, the lozenge-shaped upper spaces each with a head of Neptune, who is represented with flowing locks of sea-weed, one of the lower spaces with an elaborate flower with heart shaped petals, and the other with an endless knot. The twisted guilloche runs round each compart ment, and a lozenge fret border round the whole. Several other frets are introduced, and add much to the beauty of the design. The larger pavement is perhaps unequalled by any in Britain, if we except that at Woodchester. When complete it contained nine regular octagons, each enclosed with a twisted guilloche border, which follows along the sides of the square of the pavement. In each octagon was a circular medallion, also enclosed with an inner twisted guilloche border, the double twisted guilloche being substituted for it in the centre medallion. The subject here represented is supposed to have been a Centaur,2 but only a part of the legs remain. On the medallion underneath, Silenus is drawn sitting on the back of an ass, with a cup in one hand, and on the opposite medallion the youthful Bacchus with the panther. Act\u00e6on attacked by his own dogs whilst being transformed into a stag3 is represented on one of the side medallions ; that on the other side has been destroyed. The three remaining angle medallions contain beautiful heads of Flora, Ceres, and Pomona, the goddesses of flowers, corn, and fruit, or Spring, Summer, and Autumn ; the fourth was under the house, and is therefore wanting, but there can be little doubt that it was occupied by a head emblematical of Winter, for we are informed4 that one of the pavements discovered at Bignor consisted of five octagons, and that in a corner one is a \" bust of a female, with the head and chest closely muffled in the hooded cloak, which was not only formerly used by \"the Romans, but remains to this day the usual protection against cold and wet with all the seafaring inhabitants of the islands of the Archipelago and the shores of the Mediterranean.\" Mr. Lysons, Reliqui\u00e6 Rom\u00e6 Brit., vol. iii., plates 15 and 22, has illustrated this head. Messrs. Hare & Co., of Bristol, exhibited in 1862 at the Great Exhibition, a fine piece of floor cloth, a sac simile of the Ciren cester pavement, complete with the head of Winter in the fourth 1 The Medusa in classical mythology was a fabled sea monster, with radiating and erect hair of terrific appearance, considered as able to cast terror and impart injury to the beholder.

Of those on the Cirencester pavement, Flora has a wreath of ruby and white flowers, an olive branch over the right, and a bird, probably the swallow as harbinger of Spring, perched on the left shoulder. Ceres, with a chaplet of leaves and ears of corn, with a bunch on the left shoulder and a sickle on the right. Pomona has a head-dress indicative of her office as guardian of the fruits of the earth, with a pruning hook over her shoulder. The faces of the goddesses are beautifully executed with a benignity of expression significant of the kindly offices they were supposed to perform. Of the lozenge shaped spaces between the octagons two are wanting. On the others are figures of a Medusa's head and dancing girl. The triangular spaces round the sides are filled up with various devices. The outer border consists of bands of grey and black tesser\u00e6, with green and white twisted guilloche on a dark back ground, a labyrinthine fret, a half lozenge fret, and some broad plain borders of buff and green. Both of these pavements were of the class called suspensur\u00e6, that is, they were supported on pil\u00e6 or short pillars, like those in the building discovered in what is now Messrs. Jefferies' Nursery. The better class of pavements, or those for the best rooms, had a hypocaust or chamber for heating and ventilation underneath. The pil\u00e6 for the smaller pavement are placed in rows equal distances apart, and are partly of bricks 8 inches square and partly of stone, two small portions of shafts of columns, probably from an old building, having been used for the purpose. In each of the pil\u00e6 a brick 12 inches square is used for a cap, and these pil\u00e6 support flanged bricks, which carry the floor, consisting of 6 inches of fine lime and pounded brick concrete, on which the tesser\u00e6 are laid in hard setting mortar. Of the larger pavement only half rests upon pil\u00e6, the remainder on a solid bed enclosed within walls, and the inner pil\u00e6 only were of bricks laid in the ordinary way, the outer ones being hollow tiles about 6 inches by 5 and 16 inches high, with one or two holes cut on one of their sides. The colours principally used in the pavements are black, white, buff, brick red approaching to scarlet, green, and a bluish grey. For further and more complete information the reader is referred to the Remains of Roman Art in Corinium. A tesselated pavement was discovered in laying out the garden paths of Alma-place, in Lewis-lane, nearly 30 years ago, but was covered over in consequence of the trouble of taking it up. Another in 1864, as previously stated, in the garden of the late Mr. D. Smith, Church-street, and about the same date two others in the garden of The Firs (Mr. Bravender's), one in the house itself ; all are covered over, as likewise one by Mr. Dike, builder, in building an outhouse to Claremont-place, Chester-street."], [316, "272 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. A pavement was also found and covered over in 1853, in the passage of Mr. J. Smith's, baker, No. 160, Cricklade-street, between his shop and bakehouse, and another in 1883, in the yard of Messrs. Moulder and Orum, No. 50, Dyer-street, behind the shop. Parts of many others have been found, especially during the erection of the houses in the Nursery, which have been either destroyed or covered over, besides those which we are here enabled to record. A Roman tesselated pavement was discovered in Cricklade street, about eight feet below the surface, opposite the King's Head Tap, during the sewerage works, but was destroyed by the workmen. A paved chamber, eight feet deep, a few yards lower down the street, and a common polished pavement, eight feet below the surface, between the Bell Inn and Messrs. Bishop's shop, and close by, where the streets intersect, a tesselated floor and large block of stone. A moulded capital and base of a pillar were found between the Three Horse Shoes and Bishop Blaize. There is also known to be a Roman pavement under the Ashcroft gardens, running under the Ashcroft boundary wall, on the south side to Mr. John Lock's saw-pit. Several pavements and Roman villas have been found in the neighbourhood, besides the pavement belonging to the magnificent villa at Woodchester and the Withington pavement already referred to, proving that Gloucestershire was a favourite residence. For instance, parts of extensive villas at Cranham and Witcombe, between this town and Gloucester, traces of a villa and pavement at Latton in 1864, on Earl St. Germans' estate ; but perhaps the best known of the locality is the magnificent villa discovered in the same year at Chedworth, on the estate of the Earl of Eldon. This villa, which is most beautifully situated at the head of one of those narrow glens which wind amongst the Cotswold Hills, is a favourite resort in the summer months. The history of its discovery is somewhat unusual. It appears that Mr. Farrar, uncle of Lord Eldon, observed some little dice-like stones, and was informed by the gamekeeper that they were constantly being thrown out by the rabbits which burrowed in the hill which terminates the valley. Mr. Farrar recognising them as Roman tesser\u00e6, immediately commenced investigation, resulting in the disclosure of one of the most perfect Roman villas in England. An attendant's house has been built, and visitors receive every atten tion. It is noteworthy that the rooms at Woodchester, the Barton, and Dyer-street, were all nearly square, but here the principal room is oblong, and measures about thirty-two feet in length by one-half the width. There is a figure of a girl dancing in one of the principal compartments, and it is remarkable that the head dress of the young lady much resembles the chignon worn about the time of its discovery. There are several apartments, including complete set of bath rooms, with sudatorium, tepidarium, &c."], [317, "273 THE MUSEUM OF ROMAN ANTIQUITIES. According to Rudder, a tesselated pavement was discovered in 1636 by some labourers at plough at a place called Hocbury Field, in the parish of Rodmarton, and another at Haines' Ash, in Earl Bathurst's Park, near the close of last century. The Museum of Roman Antiquities. The building was erected in 1856, by Henry George Earl Bathurst, principally to receive the Dyer-street pavements, which were relaid under the direction of one of Messrs. Minton & Co's. workmen (Stoke-upon-Trent). It is a spacious and lofty apart ment, 56 feet by 28 feet, executed from the drawings of Mr. Parrish, F.S.A., architect, and attached is a lodge or residence for the attendant. It is open to the public from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., without charge, a box being placed at the entrance to receive voluntary contributions. The minor articles are placed in glass cases arranged as follows1 : \u2014 Case A. \u2014 Iron Series. \u201e AA. \u2014 Illustrative Series : Objects of Foreign Origin. \u201e B. \u2014 Bronze Series \u2014 Coins : Objects in Lead. \u201e C. \u2014 Small Objects in Stone. ,, D. \u2014 Red Lustrous Ware, called Samian. \u201e E. \u2014 Sepulchral Urns and other large Vessels. ,, F. \u2014 Inscribed Tiles : Handles of Amphor\u00e6. \u201e G. \u2014 Castor, Upchurch, and New Forest Pottery. \u201e H.\u2014 Wall Paintings. ,, I. \u2014 Glass Series : Bone Series : Jet Series. \u201e K. \u2014 Large Vessels of Pottery. ,, KK. \u2014 Mr. Bravender's Collection. All the objects in Case KK were collected by Mr. T. B. Bravender solely in the town of Cirencester. Case G and some of the other cases contain a few articles from other places. Mr. Bravender has likewise a valuable collection in his own possession of Corinium pottery, and of objects belonging to Medi\u00e6val Cirencester, also of Cirencester tokens of the 17th century. The articles in Case A include Roman knives, shears, tools of various kinds, keys and padlocks, door fastenings, horse shoes, styli for writing, &c. Case B contains some beautiful articles of bronze workmanship, as bracelets or armill\u00e6, brooches or fibul\u00e6, statuettes, amongst which may be especially mentioned those of Mercury and Diana ; a Roman steelyard and weights, found at Watermoor ; the beam of a balance equally divided on one face by dots of silver let in ; some bronze coins of the Roman emperors, principally found in the bed of the Churn at Latton, in carrying out some drainage works for the Earl of St. Germans in 1864. 1 The list of the cases has been copied from Professor Church's Guide to the Museum of Roman Remains at Cirencester, to be obtained in the Museum."], [318, "274 history of cirencester. In Case C are stone mortars, hones, &c, and some stone balls, which may have been intended for projectiles from the catapult, but their use is uncertain. The glazed red pottery in Case D, generally known as Samian, is very beautiful, and supposed to be of foreign manufacture. A great many pieces, some plain and some with raised patterns and figures, or incised with the maker's name, have been found at Cirencester, as well as at other Roman places. Professor Church and Mr. Bravender have kept lists of the makers' names on the pottery. The sepulchral urns of the class contained in Case E are sometimes accompanied by burnt bones, also by lachrymatories or tear vessels, and unguentaria or ointment vessels. Some of the tiles in Case F have the makers' initials or names. Case G contains some excellent examples of black, also of a buff coloured incised pottery. The fragments of mortars, which are studded over with grains of quartz or flint pebbles to assist grinding, are especially worthy of notice. In Case H are pieces of coloured plaster from the walls of Roman villas in Cirencester. The plaster used consisted of a coat of rendering (differing from that now made in the omission of cow hair and substitution of pebbles passed through a fine riddle), and a skimming coat, thus resembling modern two-coat work. The colouring was similar to fresco, the ground colour or base being smoothly laid on, and patterns, where such occur, coloured or powdered over. That in Case H, to which the most interest attaches is a painted bit of plaster, found in the New-road in 1868, with the following acrostic scratched on the surface : \u2014 ROTAS OPERA TENET AR E P O S ATO R These words do not admit of a literal translation, but the meaning intended may be freely rendered \" Arepo, the sower, holds the wheels when at work.\" The top and bottom words can be read four ways, the second and fourth two ways, and the middle word is the same read forwards and backwards. The glass in Case I is chiefly fragmentary. This case also contains some jet ornaments, small articles in bone and ivory, also bones of animals (fossilized), discovered in the Barton gravel pits, and human skulls found in the Roman burial places of Corinium. A large number of bones of some small birds were found near the town foundations in the Workhouse gardens, when they were uncovered. The large Italian snail is found near the town, also at Chedworth and other Roman stations. Amongst the larger articles in pottery, one of the most"], [319, "275 THE MUSEUM OF ROMAN ANTIQUITIES. noticeable is part of a large Amphora, found in building Watermoor Church. Mr. Bravender's Collection in the Museum, Case KK, includes upwards of one hundred pieces of pottery and the handles of two amphor\u00e6, all marked with makers' names ; several articles in bronze ; four armill\u00e6, found on a skeleton in Sheep-street, near the Cottage Hospital, and six other armill\u00e6 ; a fibula, inscribed AVVIMPI, found at The Firs; several other fibul\u00e6; rings, pins, &c, in bronze ; pins and needles, in bone ; also drinking cup, vase, salt cellar, &c, of the same material ; about one hundred pieces of Samian ware, of various patterns, and figures of Venus, gladiators fighting, dogs, deer, lions, and various wild beasts ; two hundred coins of Roman emperors, commencing with Claudius and ending with Honorius. Of these coins about twenty are silver, the remainder principally brass, but a few are silver-plated. Three belong to Claudius, who became emperor A.D. 41, and died in 54. Honorius, emperor 395-423. The earliest coin in the Museum is one of the reign of Augustus, 13 B.C. Messrs. Buckman and Newmarch give a list of coins from Augustus to Honorius, the last emperor of the West whose forces occupied Britain, found in Cirencester, chiefly from Mr. New march's own cabinets, and those of the late Mr. T. C. Brown, Miss Stevens, Mr. C. Hoare, \u25a0 Mr. S. Lediard, the Rev. Charles Gaunt, -of Isfield, Sussex, and the Cirencester Museum, together with a few examples contributed by the late Messrs. P. B. Purnell, J. F. Skipton, George Lane, and P. E. Harmer. Mr. Bravender's collection were not then in the Museum, and as their list contains about 440 coins, we have a complete record with the inscriptions on the obverse and reverse sides of between six and seven hundred, but (as stated by the authors of Roman Art) these do not amount to one-fourth of those known to have been found in the town, for those of Constantine alone would number several hundreds. It is remarkable that so many coins should have been found, and it has been suggested that when the inhabitants fled from the Saxons they buried their treasure with the hope of future recovery. We have accepted this view '(p. 148), but it will only account for coins, ornaments, &c, buried together, and not for those scattered singly. Many must have been hastily left behind, and flight taken without any attempt to conceal them, or without the opportunity of doing so. It is further remarkable that these coins should commence with Augustus, and that so many of the early emperors should be found. From the reign of Augustus to that of Honorius is equal to the period from the accession of Henry VII. until now, and it would be impossible for coins to be in circulation so long. They must have been lost by accident, but it would not be easy now to find coins of the Tudor monarchs in such abundance. It seems certain that the British, after the departure of their masters, had no currency of MM"], [320, "276 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. their own, but adopted that of their masters, for no coins are found as might have been expected of the period from Honorius to the subjugation by the Saxons, a century and a half later. Several Penates,1 or small images of the household gods of the Romans, have been disinterred. Some of these are in brass, and beautifully executed. A fine figure of a Cupid, or winged genius, about fifteen inches high, is said to have been dug up in the Nursery, in the year 1732, and was presented by the late Mr. T. Master to the Bodleian Library. A Diana, slightly injured, was discovered in the Nursery, and became part of the Purnell collection ; in the right hand is a quiver held over the shoulder and across the back, the left hand and bow arc wanting. A fine figure of Mercury two and a half inches long, perfect except the right foot, was in the possession of the late Mrs. Mullings, of Eastcourt House. Other statuettes have been found of Jupiter, Hercules, Apollo, and Venus, and two are in the possession of Mr. T. B. Bravender. Mr. Jefferies has a bust of Minerva, discovered in digging out the foundation of a stable at his Nursery. Amongst other articles of the Roman period found at Cirencester, are hand-mills for grinding corn, drinking cups, spoons, knives, tweezers, seals, medicine stamps, styli for writing on wax, hair pins, jugs, jars, glass bottles, &c, and a lamp, the only one found in Cirencester, in the cabinet of Mr. E. C. Sewell. No Roman antiquities were found in constructing the G.W.R. branch, but a few minor articles by Messrs. Watson, Smith, and Watson. There is a very curious tale connected with Cirencester, entitled \" A wonderful Discovery newly made, of Houses under ground, at Colton-field, in Gloucestershire,\" printed by William Budden, near Fleet Bridge, London, 1685, preserved amongst the papers of Dr. Richard Parsons (chancellor of the diocese of Gloucester prior to his death in 1711), now in the Bodleian at Oxford. It is repeated by Rudder as a Rosicrusian story, from its resemblance to \" a fabulous account of Rosicrusius' sepulchre,\" told in the 379th number of the Spectator, and is of interest as showing the extent to which our forefathers 200 years ago were capable of being imposed upon, and the notoriety that Cirencester had then obtained for Roman antiquities. The tale commences \u2014 \"In a piece of ground within two miles of Cirencester,\" \" commonly known by the name of Colton's-field, as two labourers were digging a gravel-pit at the foot of a hill,\" \" they observed the ground on the side next to the hill to be 1 Nearly allied to the Genii were the Lares and Penates, household gods, who presided over families. The Lares of the Romans appear to have been the manes of their ancestors. The Penates were worshipped only in the innermost part of the house, with the great gods, Jupiter, Juno, Minerva, &c. The Lares, also, in the public roads, in the camp, and on the sea."], [321, "\"A WONDERFUL DISCOVERY.\" 277 loose,\" and then discovered an entrance into a large cavity in the side, of the hill, which turned out to be a hall with long tables and benches, which fell to dust upon being touched. Proceeding further, they entered a kitchen with pots, kettles, &c, thence into a room with carved work, images in the wall, urns filled with coins, and gold, silver and brass medals engraved \" with Latin inscriptions and heads of several Roman emperors.\" A little further searching revealed a door \" strongly patched with iron, but which, the wood being rotten, with a little force fell to pieces;\" when, looking in, our heroes, \" to their great astonish ment, saw the image of a man in full proportions, with a truncheon in his hand, and a light in a glass, like a lamp, burning before him. This very much affrighted them at first, imagining it to be the devil in that shape, or a guardian spirit set there to defend some hidden treasure ; the hopes whereof so far encouraged them at last, that one of them ventured a step in. But the image seemed to strike at him, at which they were both so terrified that they durst proceed no further,\" but taking many of the coins and medals with them informed a famous local antiquary, who instructed them to keep it secret, and the next morning visited the place with them. The three came to the room where the image was, which the antiquary, thinking might be an automaton, advanced three steps, the image struck at each step with greater violence, and at the third step broke the lamp on the table. The visitors retreated from the image, which appeared to be the effigy of a Roman general, by the ensigns of martial honour, and the skulls of two unfortunate victims on his left hand ; and then prosecuted their researches into other apartments until deterred by the sound of a \"hollow voice like a deep sigh,\" which induced them to quit these dark apartments, \" which they had no sooner done than the hill sunk down, and buried all the rarities except those medals and coins taken out the night before, which are now shown for the satisfaction of the curious and ingenious, who in great numbers flock to see them, and purchase them at great rates, as most valuable relicks of antiquity.\" The key to the whole tale is evidently to be obtained in the last few lines. Colton's-field, the image, and underground passage were a myth, and the coins emanated from the cabinets of the cockney gentlemen who were as well skilled in the manufacture of startling legends as of fictitious relics of antiquity. It is not surprising that this imposition should have succeeded when a belief in fairies and witches was general amongst educated people, but it is so that a century and a half after, when the issue of this publication would have been read simply as a \" tale of the marvellous,\" it was found possible to carry on a somewhat successful trade in this and neighbouring towns in the manufacture of fictitious relics of the Roman period, and that some professed arch\u00e6ologists were deceived by these unprincipled impostors."], [322, "278 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. Medi\u00e6val Antiquities, &c. Several medi\u00e6val articles have been dug up in Cirencester, some of which are in the Museum. A seal in the possession of Mr. T. B. Bravender is engraved with a rose in the centre of the Gothic device \u2014 the intersecting triangles. From the character of the letters and design it probably belongs to the 15th century, or the period of the Wars of the Roses. The inscription appears to be PVR. LA. ROSE. SVI. EO. FET. That gentleman has also several Nuremberg (Germany) tokens found in Cirencester, suggesting that business was formerly carried on by the townsmen with a mercantile firm of that city. Mr. E. C. Sewell and Mr. Bravender have also several tradesmen's tokens current in the 17th century, but the most complete collection is that of the late Mr. John Delafield Phelps, of Chavenage House, Tetbury, who died in 1842, after a life spent in gathering papers, antiquities, and general information, with the object of bringing out a new History of Gloucestershire.

In 1883, when some mason's work was being done at The Firs, Mr. Bravender noticed some old carved stones brought for the purpose, upon which he has thus written : \" I was informed they came from the remains of an old wall in Mr. Paish's yard \" (between 29 and 32, Dyer-street), \"discovered by the workmen when making some alterations. I went with one of the men to look, but was too late to see any portion of the foundation, but from what he told me, I should think there was a large building at some time.\" \" I have still the old stones in my possession, one or two are capitals of pillars, I should think of the 12th or 13th. century. They appear very much like those at St. John's Hospital.\" The attention of the members of the Bristol and Gloucestershire Arch\u00e6ological Association was called to them at their visit in 1884. In the enlargement and alterations to the Vicarage House, it was found that the doors and windows had been blocked up belonging to the older part of the house. These were 16th century in style, and possibly formed a part of old Monmouth House, as drawn in Sir Robert Atkyns' History. Built into the walls were stone mouldings and moulded jambs, probably materials from the defunct Abbey. Relative to old houses, we may note the following, in addition to those named on p. 135. The Ship Inn, the panelled outer door of which bears date 1648. The Anchor Inn, Gloucester street, and the house in the same street, at the entrance to Sheppard's-place, have respectively \"I. I. A, 1686,\" and \"B. A. M., 1694,\" carved over the doorways. Some houses without dates are older than these, as Messrs. Bishop's, in the Market-place, at the corner of Cricklade-street, which has a crest or device carved on the face of the gablet. The old Fleece, the shop occupied by Mr. Morris, saddler, Castle-street, with some others, are also good examples of old houses. Ancient Crosses. Rudder writes that \"there were vestiges of at least six of them, within the recollection of many persons then living (1800), but not one entire.\" The principal of these was the High Cross, which before its removal to Earl Bathurst's Park, a century ago, stood in front of the late Ram Inn, now shops, on the west side of the Market-place. Rudder considers that it is the cross referred to in a deed of 1413, quoted by Collinson as \"Nova crux juxta flumen,\" and that this is conclusive evidence of the stream at that time flowing along Gosditch and Cricklade streets, but although this cross was erected about that time there is not the least evidence that this was the one intended. For not to suggest that others may have stood near the Churn, of which all vestiges had disappeared long before Rudder wrote, there was a cross in the London-road, close to the stream opposite the"], [325, "ANCIENT CROSSES. 281 garden wall of Oxford House, the round pedestal of which remained in his time. A third stood in the open part of Dyer street, nearly opposite the Waterloo passage, where the pig-market formerly was, and was thence called the pig-cross. Rudder recollected the shaft standing with a sun-dial fixed on it, but it was taken down before the removal of the High Cross. A fourth stood in the Churchyard, the relics of which were removed before the last mentioned. It is represented as a plain shaft rising from a square base in Atkyns' Gloucestershire (1712). A fifth stood near the junction of Castle-street and Sheep-street. Of this Rudder states that nothing but the \" round pedestal on which it stood remained in his time,\" and that that had been removed when he wrote his work. Mr. Freeman, an old inhabitant, who died a few years since, could recollect, however, the \" Cross tree standing,\" which \" was blown down many years ago on a stormy Shrove Tuesday.\"1 The sixth stood where Lewis and Querns lanes cross the end of Cricklade-street, and the round pedestal was standing in 1800. This one and the second and fifth in the list were placed near the boundary of the old borough. Mr. Pooley, formerly of this town, has taken great interest in the crosses of this district, and we here give in a condensed form his remarks upon the High Cross, as read before the Cotteswold Club, September 16, 1856. The only parts of the old cross, which may be assumed as a work of the 14th century, which remain are the pedestal, shaft, and fragments of the capital. \" Differing from the ordinary road side or churchyard crosses, it possesses uncommon beauty. The pedestal is hewn out of a single block of stone, three feet square by two feet six inches in height, and presents on each of its sides a facade ornamented with four deeply chiselled Gothic arcades surmounted by panelled quatrefoils, which are overhung to the extent of some inches by a deep moulded coping. It rests on a plinth which is placed on a heavy basement step, too heavy to be in character with the rest of the building. From the centre of the pedestal springs a remarkably fine octagonal shaft, a solid stone six feet four inches in height and one foot in diameter, having rounded flutings at the angles and the remains of four broaches at the socket. It is conjectured by the presence of these broaches that originally the shaft was set in a smaller block, thus bringing the termination to a square; which supposition would render the design more harmonious, by taking off the apparent abruptness of so small a column rising from so large a pedestal.\" Of the capital what remains is too much broken to determine much of the carving, but there are distinct indications of well executed angels' heads and wings ; also between the corbels, which project at the four angles of the capital, the remains of escutcheons may be seen, but no trace is left of the emblazonments with which they were 1 Mr. Gael's Notes on the Ordnance Survey."], [326, "282 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. doubtless enriched. Judging from analogy, however, Mr. Pooley considers .that the corbels supported slender buttresses, which were arched at the top, and formed light canopied niches in which figures were placed. The crosses at Cricklade St. Sampson and St. Mary, and that of Ampney Crucis, are of this description. The ponderous stone in the shape of a cross, now surmounting the capital, is no part of the original design, but was put up during the present century. When perfect the cross must have been twenty feet high. The pedestal stands on a base three steps in height, the lowermost being ten feet square."], [327, "i"], [328, ""], [329, "PART XL NOTES AND APPENDIX. (Page 3. Note 1.) The Cotswolds and Thames Head. Some writers have derived the name \" Cotswold \" from the British \" coed,\" a wood, and \" wold,\" signifying an upland tract of country. One writer asserts that the little village of Coates gives its name to the whole district. The word \" coed \" is preserved in the names of many places in Wales, but these derivations are certainly unsatisfactory. Nuttall explains Cotswold as a term applied to sheepcotes in an open country, and this applies to this district, where the fine sheep for which it is noted are depastured on the light strong soils of the high lands in hurdle enclosures. The Stroudwater and Chelt flow westwards into the Severn and the Thames and its tributaries, the Churn, Coin, Lech, and Windrush, down their eastern slope: The Thames is usually con sidered to rise at a spot known as Thames Head, by the side of the canal, and opposite to Trewsbury \" Castle,\" a spot in the parish of Coates, three and a half miles south-west from Cirencester. This is taken as the source by Mr. and Mrs. S. C. Hall, who nearly thirty years ago described the river throughout its entire length, but the stream is almost dry for the first mile except in the rainy season, owing in great measure to the canal pumping engine. After heavy rain there is a considerable flow of water from this head. At Cricklade, ten miles distant, it receives the Churn, which rises at the Seven Springs, ten miles north of Cirencester and five from Cheltenham. This stream is about twenty miles long, and being the longer river and rising at a greater elevation is by many considered the true source. (Page 26.) Rebellion of Kent and Salisbury.

I. \u2014 History of life and reign of Richard II., by a Monk of Evesham. \u2014 On the Epiphany, 1400, Kent and Salisbury, finding that their scheme was found out, came to Faringdon, and then promised rewards to any who would take up Richard's cause ; then proceeded to and reached Cirencester the same day. The next day, January 7th, repeated the proclamation, but the people took up arms against them, and eventually placed them all in safe custody in the monastery. The rebels the next day (the 8th) resolved together to escape, and for this end instructed their wives and female servants to set fire to certain parts of the town, thinking that they should be able to escape whilst the towns people were putting out the flames. But this failed of its purpose, and so enraged the inhabitants that they drew them forth into the \"forum\" (market place), and decapitated them \" the 3rd day after the Epiphany,\" and also Lord Ralph Lumney, a soldier from the north, who was associated with them. Immediately after their \" famuli \" are captured, and led bound to Oxford, and there, with Thomas Blont, decapitated in the castle. II. \u2014 Translation from \" Recueil des Croniques d'Engleterre par Johan de Waurin.\" \u2014 After treating of the conduct of Huntingdon and Salisbury, on suspecting their plot discovered, \" They came into a town which they called Succestre, in which was a bailiff on the side of King Henry, wise and discreet, in whom he had great confidence for well guarding the town and surrounding country. And when these three Earls and Lord Despenser were come to Succestre they took lodgings, and were one night allowed to remain undisturbed, for the bailiff knew well that he would be better able to fight them if he dissimulated to the best of his abdity. When the morning came the Earl of Salisbury and Lord Despenser set out on horseback, leaving the Earls of Hostidonne (Huntingdon) and Kent in Cirencester, in order to see the Earl of Berkeley at Berkeley Castle, to get more men. On their returu they lodge in the town, leaving their forces outside. Huntingdon, during his comrade's absence, tells the bailiff of the town that Richard was released, and that in two days they would see him. The bailiff knew better, but wisely keeps his own counsel. A spy enters the conspirators' chamber, and they were arrested by the town constable. Salisbury and Kent slain in fighting. Lord Huntingdon, Gloster, and Despenser, and Maudelain, the Priest, make their escape.\" The account of the Evesham monk has no reference to Huntingdon and De Spenser, but states that others were captured besides Kent and Salisbury, and beheaded ; that of John de Waurin, and likewise those of Hall, and Froissard (from which the account in the history is chiefly taken), assert that Huntingdon and De Spenser, Maudelen, &c, came to Cirencester"], [331, "285 NOTES AND APPENDIX. with Kent and Salisbury. Thomas Walsingham's account differs from Hall's, in representing Huntingdon as having stayed near London, from whence he escaped to his home in Essex, where he was caught and beheaded. His escape thither is admitted by all writers, and that of De Spenser. In other respects it is reliable, and gives a graphic description of the taking of the conspirators.

Our Country-men and the Volunteers got notice of it, and apprehending that he came to execute the Commission of Array, there came at least a thousand Armed men to assist the Townsmen, who had with posts and chains fortified the Town to keep out horse, and they did all purpose to keep my Lord out of the Town if he did not promise and protest that he did not come to execute the Commission of Array, which he solemnly did to divers Gentlemen that met him upon Randcomb-down, and to some of the Townsmen, who, observing that he came not with above thirty persons, and those no weapons but swords, brought notice of it to the Town, and so he was admitted in, and after dinner the Justices of -the Peace and other Gentlemen being in conference with my Lord, the Souldiers and Arm'd men came and beset the house where they were, and demanded of my Lord, wherefore and for what he came thither ? he answered that it was only to confer with the Gentlemen for the peace of the County."], [334, "288 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. \" Then they required him to deliver up his Commission of Array unto them or otherwise they would bring him to the Parliament ; at length upon meditation and intreat of the Gentlemen the Souldiers were content to depart; if my Lord would put it under his hand that he would never execute the said Commission nor any others for him in any part of this County, but would oppose and hinder it to his power, and that he would maintaine the Power and Priviledge of Parliament and the Laws and Liberties of the Subjects with his Life and Fortune, all which being in extreme fear he condiscended unto, and a note being drawn to that purpose, my Lord, Sir Robert Tracey, and some others put their hands to it, which did in some sort pacifie the Souldiers ; yet a great many not herewith content did protest they would bring my Lord to the Parliament, and would not otherwise be satisfied a great while, yet with very much intreaty about eleven of the clock at night they departed to their lodgings intending to speak with my Lord again this morning, but he being still in great fear was conveyed away on foot very privately by Sir William Masters and other gentlemen through his house, let out a back way and so departed, tbe Souldiers coming to look for him this morning and finding him gone were extremely enraged and had like to have pulled down the house, took his coach and drew it themselves into the Market Place, cutt it and tore it in pieces. \" The Gentry and Commons of this County do generally declare themselves against the said Commission. \" Believe me this is a true relation, I was an eye and ear witnesse of it, and the main body of our County resolve to keep their Protestation.

The following account os the assault is abridged from one published by Prince Rupert's chaplain : \u2014 \"On the 21st of January, 1642, Prince Rupert marched from Oxford with five regiments of horse, his own troop of life guards, and a considerable body of dragoons and foot, and took with him four field pieces to secure his march ; his design was to relieve Colonel Hastings, who was besieged in his own house, at Ashby de-la Zouch, in Leicestershire, but hearing in his march that the siege was raised, the prince turned his thoughts on Cirencester, which had been fortified by the Parliament, and was provided with a good garrison, commanded by Colonel Fettiplace. This town, by reason of its situation, had much straightened the king's quarters and was of great consequence at the time. This little"], [335, "notes and appendix. 289 army not being thought equal to the new enterprize, the king was applied to for a reinforcement and some battering cannon ; and till these could be brought up, his highness, by easy marches, passed through Warwickshire into Gloucestershire. On Monday morning, the 30th of January, the van of the army passed by Sudeley Castle, which was possessed but two days before by a detachment from the garrison of Cirencester, and which was thought to be so dependant on the fortune of that town, that the prince resolved to pursue his first purpose, and if he should be successful, to leave the castle to come in afterwards. This day, however, the prince posted his own regiment, with Lieutenant Colonel O'Neal and a strong party of Dragoons, to keep watch on the Cirencester side of the castle, and at night, when the main body of the army came up, the parties were all drawn off and the whole army lay in the open fields, near Hawling, about two miles from the castle. On Thursday morning, February the 2d, the prince received a reinforcement of dragoons and a regiment of horse under Colonel Slater, with two eighteen pounders and a mortar piece to throw grenades. All these joined him at the rendezvous near Cirencester. After his highness had reconnoitered the north side of the town about Spital Gate, Colonel Lunsford, with his dragoons, was appointed to attack that quarter, and Lord Carnarvon's regiment of horse was to second him, while Monsieur la Roche planted his mortar piece within one hundred and fifty paces of Spital Gate, to act in conjunction with them. Things being thus disposed on the part of the army, it may not be amiss, before we come to blows, to speak a word or two of the situation of the besieged. The town being pretty large, and esteemed the key of Gloucestershire, some diligence had been used in fortifying it, which was indeed strong in its natural situation, being about half way round encompassed with water, a great part with a high wall, and the remainder secured by strong works. The gardens were divided by many low dry stone walls, which may be considered as a kind of breast work. The streets were barricadoed with chains, harrows, and waggons. Each end of the high or main street leading through the town, was secured against the horse with strong turnpikes. They had erected two batteries, one of which was of two six pounders on the south west corner, which commanded Cricklade way. In Sir Wan. Master's [the Abbey] garden, which is on the north side of the town, they opposed a brass saker to the mortar in Colonel Lunsford's quarter, as was before observed. And in the Market place they mounted an iron six pounder ; which five were all their ordnance. The Barton House, then called Giffard's, and a square high wall lined with musketry, was another strong part of the besieged, at the north west end of the town. On the left hand of the Barton stands a water mill, and about four hundred yards up the Churn, at the lower end of Gloucester-street, stood"], [336, "290 history of cirencester. another ; both these mills had been strengthened with walls and other works. The chief officers were Colonel Fettiplace (the governor), and Lieut.-Col. Carr, on whom, it seems, was the principal dependance, and who is said to have declared, the day before the attack, that he would keep the town against 20,000 men. The Prince, leaving Lunsford at the Spital-gate, marched the main body to the Barton field, on the north-west side of the town, and after the necessary dispositions, gave the command of the right wing, consisting of four regiments of dragoons, supported by Sir Thomas Byron, with the Prince of Wales's regiment of horse, to Lord Wentworth. The left wing, composed of Colonel Usser's regiment, and about 400 men, brought in that morning by Colonel Wentworth, seconded by Prince Rupert's own regiment and his life guards, under the respective commands of Lieut.-Colonel O'Neal and Sir Richard Crane, his Highness took himself; and the command of the centre, consisting of a body of 500 well-disciplined men, with Colonel Lewis Kirk at their head, supported by Prince Maurice's regiment, was given to Lieut. -General Wilmot ; the reserve was committed to Sir John Byron, who, with his regiment of horse, was to guard the rear. The word was \" Queen Mary,\" which given, the order of assault was thus : A forlorn hope of thirty musketeers, drawn out of Col. Kirk's men, and headed by Lieut. St. John, were marched along by Lieut. -Gen. Wilmot, who was to direct them where to attack, between the Barton house and the great manor house belonging to the Poole family, and being come almost to the hedge of a close ground, which stood between the gardens of these houses, the general sent a messenger to the prince, to desire that the cannon might be advanced, saying that ' they were already almost in the hedge.' At that hedge and the low wall beyond, it the skirmish began. Here Lieut. St. John was shot in the leg, and rendered incapable of advancing any farther, but his men maintained a good fire against the enemy, and, soon after, sixty men of the same corps coming to the assistance of the first thirty, and these being again followed by another reinforcement, under Lieut.-Colonel Layton, after a few hot vollies, the townsmen were beaten from the hedge to the Barton garden wall, and were pursued by the king's troops, who running close under the wall flung stones upon the enemy. Whilst this was doing, Lieut. -Gen. Wilmot led Kirk's whole regiment down the hill to the Barton house and garden wall, and Col. Usser, with 400 men besides his own regiment, was sent by the prince to second him, who together attacked the house on every side, the pike-men marching forwards to the lane, cleared the avenue, which was obstructed by a heap of bushes, and so entered the yard ; whilst Colonel Usser, perceiving the garden wall (within which the enemy's musketry stood) too high to be climbed on the front, found means to enter the garden on"], [337, "291 NOTES AND APPENDIX. the back side, where, and from the windows of the house the enemy were still firing on Kirk's men. At their entrance, the king's men killed about fourteen\u2014 the rest ran away. Thus, got to the house, the colonel, with a fire-pike in his hand, set fire to it, and the soldiers fired the stacks of hay and corn that stood about it, which made the place too hot and smoky to be tenable. The townsmen, beaten out of the house, garden, and works, retired, with more haste than order, by Cecily-hill, to their first turnpike ; the king's men following closely at their heels, made a considerable slaughter. All this while Lord Wentworth was warmly engaged in another quarter. His post was to have fallen back to the southward, on the right hand of Poole's mount, but, misled by the guide, they fell into the close to the left hand of the mount, where they were both flanked by the battery and annoyed by the musketry from the high wall before them ; the officers, thinking it very difficult to force this wall, drew to the left into the lane, and there joined Colonel Kirk's men, and with them entered the turnpike together, for the enemy having been just beaten from the side works that guarded it, the king's troops had burst it open and made the pasage clear. Colonel Usser marched through this turnpike, and placing a guard upon the bridge at the bottom of Cecily-hill, turned on the left up the Mill-bank, to come at a body of the enemy collected together at another work, but upon his approach, they fled and forsook their colours. The foot thus engaged, the horse kept their station at the end of the town, where they were annoyed from Poole's battery, which played upon them incessantly, but Colonel Innes having sent the prince notice that the turnpike was won, his highness ordered Colonel Scrimsour, with a small party of his own life guards, to push into the town, who were immediately followed by the whole troop, which fell in before the foot, and drove all before them, killing many as they passed. In the Market-place they found about 300 foot and fifty horse, who fled upon the spur. The foot getting into the houses, fired out of the windows. The Market-place thus cleared, and Sir Richard Crane advancing eastward down Dyer-street, a Spanish gunner ran out of the King's Head inn, to fire a piece of ordnance full upon the croups of the prince's troops, but was prevented by a gentleman that rode in between the Spaniard and his piece and pistoled him. The life guards then p.assing on to another turnpike, at the end of Dyer-street, discovered a body of between two and three hundred of the enemy in a w.alled close at the left, but the wall not permitting the horse to come at them, Sir Richard Crane, suspecting they might have some near way to get into the Market-place, and cut off his retreat, retired thither himself, and made that post good till the foot came up. In his way he cut down many that appeared in the street, and the foot coming in they searched the houses, and some of those they 00"], [338, "292 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. found were killed, the rest made prisoners. Colonel Fettiplace, Captain Warneford, and Mr. George, one of the members for the borough, were among the latter. Hitherto the strong post at the water mills, on the left of the Barton house, where the enemy had placed a pair of colours, had not been attempted, but, seeing the town was taken another way, they pulled down their colours, and retreated inwards to a bridge and chain. The horse pursued them, but not being able to pass the chain, the enemy faced about, gave them a volley, and kept their ground till they were driven from thence by a body of foot who came to the assistance of the horse. Here Mr. Payne, a clothier in the town party, was killed with the colours in his hand. All this while the garrison were skirmishing with Colonel Lunsford and Lord Carnarvon, at the Spital-gate, but hearing of the town being taken, they flung down their arms and ran away with those whom Sir Richard Crane had left in the walled close. Colonel Lunsford forced the Spital-gate, and Sir Charles Lucas entered by a turnpike. At first entering the town, the cannoneers and musketeers fled from Poole's battery, leaving their colours standing, which the Prince ordered to be taken down : and it is said that Captain Seymour and his company forsook their guard and colours at George's battery before they had even seen an enemy. Lord Carnarvon pursued the fugitives to the southward, killed a few, and made many prisoners. Sir John Byron followed those that fled towards Cricklade, killed above a hundred, and made as many prisoners ; among the latter were two clergymen, Mr. Stanfield and Mr. Gregory, the latter minister of Cirencester. Prince Maurice pursued those that fled from Poole's battery, and some of those that were first overtaken were killed, but, it being enough to prostrate to a lion, about 300 falling before the prince's feet, his mercy pleased itself with making them prisoners. Great numbers of arms were taken in the houses, and drawn out of the rivers, where they were thrown to prevent their falling into the hands of the conquerors, to the amount of 3000. All the five pieces of ordnance were found standing in their places. On the part of the king, Major Hutchinson and about twenty private men were killed, and Lieutenant St. John shot in the leg. On that of the town, the lowest computation is 300 killed and 1,200 taken prisoners, of whom 160 were wounded, to whom the prince sent his surgeon, doctor, and chaplains, next day, to dress and visit them. In this affair Gen. Wilmot distinguished his judgement and valour. Colonel Layton's horse was shot through the neck, and Major Windbank's was killed under him.\" Siege of Cirencester.

Sent to a Friend in London, by one (John White) who was present at, and some days after the taking of it. Published because of the many false reports that were in print concerning that businesse. Printed at London, 1642. (Feb. 20th.) \" Sir, \u2014 I shall indeavour to give you a briefe and true account of the state of the miserable towne of Cicester, in the county of Glocester, from the first troubles to the taking of it, and' doe request you to acquaint those parliament men you have interest in, what we have suffered for desiring to stand and fall with them ; not doubting but they will so resent our sufferings, that they will expedite such succors into our county, as may relieve Glocester, and procure some little refreshment to the poore towne of Cicester, and our wasted county adjoyning. \" Our greatest enemies from the first have been our owne countreymen, our first troubles beganne about August last, when the Lord Chandoys (having accepted from the parliament the charge of being lord lieutenant of our county, and betraying both his countrey and his trust) attempted to execute the commission of array, and to that purpose summoned all the gentry of our county to meete his lordship at Cicester, but what entertainment he and his array-men had there, I presume you know, having heard how the Lord Chandoys hardly escaped from being taken prisoner by the countrey that rose in armes to resist his illegal commission ; and how the next morning after his escape, the furious people hewed his lordship's coach in peeces which he had left behinde him, so much they abhorred to be betraied to slavery by one of their owne country. \" Hereupon Cicester (though the townsmen were a meanes to save the Lord Chandoys' life, who else might have beene torne in pieces by some of the inraged countrey people) was much threatened with fire and sword, and indeed so was the whole countrey for resisting the commission of array ; and it was thought fit by the deputy lieutenants of our county, that a garrison should be kept in Cicester, it being alwayes feared that that towne would be first attempted in the county of Glocester. \" Thus we continued in armes, not doing or suffering much till January, only the cavaliers, when they came within twelve miles of us to Burford, were twice beaten out of their quarters there, by some parties that went out from our garrison of Cicester, we being very impatient of such bad neighbours. \" On Saturday, the last of December, the Lord Marquesse Hartford, with his Welch regiments, and Sir John Beaumont with his forces, came up from Worcester, to the towne of Stow in our county, and on Tuesday following marched thence to"], [340, "294 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. Burford, where finding his entertainment scanty, his lordship presently repaired to the king at Oxford, and there advised his majesty, that unlesse he might have contribution and quarter for his army in Gloucestershire and Wiltshire (which he affirmed would never be had till the town of Cicester was taken) they could not long subsist, the stores of all places (where they were masters) being neare spent and exhausted. His lordship also, with much confidence, offered his majesty that he would take the towne, if he might be assisted with some great horse and dragoones : hereupon as he desired, a commission was granted to him and Prince Rupert, with two regiments of horse, and one of dragoones, and Prince Maurice, with all his horse and dragoones, was sent to aid him. \" In pursuance whereof, his lordship with his army (as some of their own reported), to the number of six thousand horse and foote, upon Saturday, the seventh of January, about noone, drew up his forces almost round about the towne, and where they made their first stand, they made a pause for above two houres, in which time they only sent out scouts to view our guards, and then summoned those in the towne in the name of Marquesse Hartford, lord generall of all those forces, by a trumpet, to deliver up the towne and armes to his lordship, upon promise of his majestie's free pardon for all by-gone offences, with assurance of safety of their persons and estates ; which if it were refused, no mercy might be expected. Before the first trumpet was dispatched, a second came in the name of Prince Rupert, with the same message in effect ; adding only, that they came to vindicate and maintaine the king's rights and prerogative. The answer returned to both was the same, and in substance this, ' We do heartily acknowledge and professe ourselves to be his majestie's loyall and faithful subjects, and shall be ever as ready with our lives and fortunes to maintaine his just rights and prerogatives as they were, or the best of his majesty's subjects ; and as we are so, we ought likewise to enjoy his majesty's peace, and the just rights and liberties of the subjects of England, according to the lawes of the land, in defence whereof and the true protestant religion only we stand to our armes, and are resolved with God's assistance to defend them with our estates and lives.' This answer being returned ; the enemy kept their stand on all sides untill it beganne to grow darke, and then it pleased God of his meere mercy so to discourage them, that they all retreated to their night quarters in the villages round about, where they did eate up all the provision of victuall, and spoiled much corne and hay. The next morning they only showed themselves before the towne, and so departed without making one shot at it ; Prince Rupert and his troopes to Oxford, Prince Maurice to his quarters at Farrington, and Marquesse Hartford and his forces to Burford, and the villages adjoyning. While they lay before the towne,"], [341, "295 NOTES AND APPENDIX. our forces tooke Master John Villiers prisoner, who was brother to Lord Grandison, and captaine of a company of dragoones, and is still in prison at Gloucester; when they went away they tooke with them all the horses of the villages round about us, and did threaten a sudden returne with more force, and as much fury and revenge as they could send to us with the best cannon they could bring. \" So we waited a fortnight for the returne of the enemy, who we heard was marched into Northamptonshire, and in the meanetime our garrison was increased, and the towne better fortified on all sides, and we had four great iron peeces sent from Bristol, besides two brasse peeces we had before from Glocester. \" On Thursday, January 26, a party from Cicester of some foure or five hundred great horse and dragoones (who were to meete with more strength from Glocester and Tewkesbury), marched hence to besiege Sudeley castle, fourteen miles from Cicester, because it was reported, that certainely a strong malig nant party was rising in that part of Glocestershire, and it was feared that Sudely castle (the strongest hold in these parts) would become a receptacle both of the malignants' armes and treasure. \" On Friday, our forces set downe before it, and after summons assaulted it, and being reinforced from Cicester with two hundred choyse musqueteers, and one brasse peece, they took the castle by composition. \"On Munday, being the 30th day of Jan., Prince Rupert (having the week before fetched a compasse from Oxford by Northamptonshire and Warwickshire, where he plundered some townes, and tooke away all the armes and horses of the country, with which he armed and mounted all his men, except a few pikes to guard his carriages) appeared before the castle, and most of his men lay all night on the hils. But in regard there fell that night a great snow the cavaliers rose from before Sudeley, and the next clay being Tuesday, they marched towards Cicester, and quartered within seven miles of it, almost round about us. And yet this being known to our forces at Sudely castle (who were the greatest part of our strength) they tarried there (I will not say by whose neglect it was) till the towne of Cicester was utterly lost. \"On Wednesday, Febru. 1st, the enemy was reinforced with some fresh troopes from Oxford, and two whole culverings, besides foure small brasse field peeces, and two morter peeces ; and so on Wednesday night some of them quartered within a mile of the towne, and gave us alarms all that night. \"On Thursday morning, Febru. 2nd, they were' discovered some two miles from the towne, where under a hedge they staied some two howres, till all their forces drew together into one body, from their severall quarters in the villages, and so they divided"], [342, "296 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. themselves; Prince Rupert, and the greatest part of the army drawing neere the towne on the west and south part, and the Earle of Carnarvon, and his troops and some other forces, on the north and north-west part of the town. About nine or ten of the clocke they came some of them within the command of our cannon, which plaied at them two or three howres, and often and often caused them on the west side of the towne to retreat behind a little hill, and all that while divers parties of our musqueteers went out under the shelter of hedges and wals, and skirmisht with the enemy. \" About twelve a cloke, two or three regiments of foote being kept in, and forced on by the horse behinde them, beganne a furious assault on the Barton, a great farme which lay not farre from the towne westward, where they were valiently entertained by some hundred musqueteers that lay under the garden wall. \"So there continued at the Barton, a very hot fight for some two howres, our men lying under shelter of the wall, notably giving fire at them, within lesse than musquet shot, and our cannon being little more off than musquat shot, all the while furiously playing point blanke on their whole body, which lay in an open rising field. Here the Welchmen were seene to drop downe a pace, but still the horsemen behinde them, cried, On, On, and drave them forward 'till they had gotten quite under the garden wall. But before that, the enemy had fired some barnes and ricks of corne and hay that lay quite behinde those hundred musqueteers, so that the enemy being at the wall, and breaking of it downe, and the fire so behinde them, that it tooke away all possibility of retreating if they staied any longer, and they being so few (and yet as many as could be well spared from other guards), our men were forced out of that worke after two hours' valiant resistance of that furious charge of the enemy ; during all which time, we lost but one man, who after the guard was entered, could not finde his way forth through the fire and smoake. \" Our men retreating to the second worke, which was hard by, being so hotly pursued by the enemy, fire and smoake, which the wind drave directly upon them ; they and the guards of that worke without any resistance made, very disorderly fled into the towne, and were furiously pursued by the enemy, who without quarter killed those they met withall or overtooke : which so desperately inraged our men, that in the market place, and from windowes they shot at the enemy almost an houre together, purposing to sell their lives and liberties as deare as they could. \" Whilst the enemy was assaulting the towne on the west side at the Barton, the Earle of Carnarvon and his forces, seeing the Barton fired and our men beaten from their workes, sought to enter it on the north side, where there was a sore charge valiently received by our men with little losse, who yeelded not, till the"], [343, "NOTES AND APPENDIX. 297 enemy, who had entered the towne on the other side, was on their backs. Thus about foure of the cloke the towne was wholly wonne, and shooting was ended on all sides, and then they tooke prisoners, and fell to plundering that night, all the next day, and on Saturday, wherein they shewed all the barbarous insolence of a prevailing enemy, and I am confident, they (it seemes being grown more skillfull in mischief) not only acted over, but out-did their former cruelties and spoyl of Braineford and Marleborough ; they spared not to plunder their best friends ; for I can assure you, some of the notorious malignants were the most notably plundered of all the towne. \"I tremble to write of their blasphemies, they tauntingly asked some godly people, where is now your God (you round head rogues 1) you praied to the Lord to deliver you, and ye see how he h<ath delivered you, ye rebels, &c. \" The number that the enemy lost is altogether unknowne, by reason none durst goe forth to see the slaine. Of the towne forces, both townsmen and countreymen, there were not above twenty kill'd as can yet be learn'd. It is much feared they slew a very godly minister, who was seene taken by them, and yet cannot be heard of. There lay some of our men naked foure daies after they were killed, neare the place where the enemy after the taking of the towne kept his utmost guard, and none durst bury them. \" The number of prisoners that they tooke and carried to Oxford was betwixt eleven and twelve hundred, among which there were some gentlemen of eminent estates and affections to their country. Two very godly ministers, divers commanders, and others, which were very religious and of good account. \" They stript many of the prisoners, most of them of their utmost garments. They were all turned that night into the church, and though many of them were wounded and weary, yet their friends were not suffered to bring them a cup of water into the church that night, but what they thrust in at the backside of the church, having broken the windowes ; and the like cruelty I heare was shewed unto them when they lay in Witney church, in their passage to Oxford. \" They tied all the prisoners, gentlemen, ministers, and all in ropes, and made them all goe a foote through the dirt in the streetes and way to Oxford, which in regard of the many horses, were up to their knees sometimes, and in this manner they used a very worthy gentleman, who had beene very lately high sheriffe of our county, an aged gentleman, of infirme health, though of undaunted courage in this cause. \" They shamefully abused the two ministers, reproachfully imitating their manner of preaching, &c. \" The captaine who tooke the ministers, upon the earnest solicitation of their friends for their releasement, promised them"], [344, "298 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. that for fifty or sixty pounds a peece he would release them : which money being procured and paid them, he scofsingly answered, that they might well pay as much more to him for not killing them, as he might have done, and they deserved ; and so after that they were more straitly imprisoned, and worse used, and one of their friends that had a free passe promised him into the towne with the money, had very much adoe to escape killing or imprisoning. \" We lost five peeces of cannon, neare upon twelve hundred musquets, and other armes, fourteen colours, and some amunition, for most of our powder and bullet was sent unto them before they entered the towne. \" The value of the pillage of the town is uncertaine, but very great, to the utter ruine of many hundred families, and besides the burning of some particular men's houses, which were purposely set on fire after the towne was wonne. The Barton farme with very much buildings in it, and all the corne, hay, and other goods and cattle of one gentleman's, which amounted to three thousand pounds and upwards, was burnt to the ground. \" On Friday they went into the countrey, and tooke away all the horses, sheepe, oxen, and other cattle of the well-affected that inhabited neare Cicester. \"On Saturday, Febru. 2nd, they took away cloth, wooll, and yarne, besides other goods from the clothiers, about Stroudwater, to the utter undoing, not only of them and theirs, but of thousands of poore people, whose very livelihood depends on that trade. \" Now, Sir, before I close up all, I shall give you a hint of what I conceive, besides our sinnes, concurred with the irresistable will of God, to hasten our ruine. \" 1. The want of our horse, which made them confidently brave our men at their very workes, as also the want of cannoneers, which were at Sudely castle. \" 2.

Nicholas.\" The Honourable Colonel Newport, as one who took an active part in this engagement, in his \" Memoirs of a Cavalier,\" states that the County Magazine at Cirencester supplied the Royalists with 3,000 arms, 120 barrels of gunpowder, &c. He agrees with other accounts in the number of prisoners, but in his anxiety to prove the utter rout of the townspeople makes his own men guilty of wanton butchery. Stamford's regiment (which was chased into the Market-place) and 800 men besides being \" entirely cut to pieces \" without \" further resistance.\" Clarendon writes that the works of defence \"were not finished though pertinaciously defended.\" Not possessed like Newport of a desire to magnify the achievements of his own party, he informs us that the town was entered with \" some loss"], [347, "NOTES AND APPENDIX. 301 of men and many hurt, but with a few greater of the enemy, for there were not so few as 200 killed upon the place, and above 1000 taken prisoners.\" He does not refer to the number killed in pursuit, but confirms other accounts respecting the plunder, \" from which the undistinguishing soldier could not be kept, but was equally injurious to friend and foe, so that many who were imprisoned by the Rebels found themselves at liberty and undone together, amongst whom John Plot (see p. 185) found his house\" \" full of soldiers and \u00a31,200 taken.\" The Surprise of the Royalist Garrison by Essex. Clarendon here blames the Officers for negligence and for '\u2022 most sottishly \" leaving the King's Army provisions at Ciren cester, \u2014 and it appears certain that the Cavalier soldiers, who were far more used to fire-arms than the Roundhead apprentice boys, and thus at the outbreak of the war were the victorious party, were less capable of discipline. There is a remarkable analogy in this respect between them and the combatants in the American Civil War. There the South at first bid fair to gain its ends, but eventually the men from the workshops and stores of the Northern cities, inspired like the Roundheads with a deep conviction of the righteousness of their cause, became the better soldiers and carried the day. The letter of Colonel Newport on the successful surprise of the Lord General also suggests that Royalist vigilance was not what it should have been, and that the duties of the soldier were sometimes subordinated to the claims of personal friendship. He was in the town apparently without any military object with Crisp and Spencer (some foot of his own regiment having gone on to Oxford), and was just retiring to rest at one of the inns, when Crisp having entered his chamber and said \" We are all undone, the Roundheads are upon us ; \" forthwith ordered the inn gates to be shut, and sent to the other inns to do the same, and if possible come out by back ways. By this means they got 300 horse \" in the yards and places behind the house \" (probably the old Bull Inn), and then \" began to think of breaking out by a line which led from the back of the inn,\" but at that instant a messenger from Colonel Spencer, who was cooped up, came to Crisp for help, who, \" moved to see the distress of his friend, said ' What can we do for him 1 ' \" Newport having advised that they should help him, they sally forth through the inn gates and with Spencer \" beat back the enemy to their main body, but finding their foot drawn up in the churchyard, and several detachments moving to charge,\" he adds \" we retreated in as good order as we could towards Faringdon, and so to Oxford,\" \" leaving behind 500 horse and all the carriages under the convoy of the party, and loaden with provisions and ammunition.\""], [348, "302 history of cirencester.

Being the Lamentable Complaint of them that were brought prisoners from Cycester, being eleven hundred sixty and odde, told^ in the view of all for their misguided zeale. Containing the notices by which they have been drawn into Rebellion against their Lawfull King.\" \" Desired by them to be Printed for a Warning to their Brethren, February 20, 1642-3.\" This document is much too lengthy to repeat in full. It commences in the following quaint manner : \u2014 \" Gentlemen, \u2014 You are here come to behold a miserable spectacle of poore injur'd people by the lying lips of them to whose mischievous Enchantments we have lent too much an eare,\" and then after a cursory mention of what they chose to call \" the heinousness of our fault,\" proceeds to laud the King in a most servile and hypocritical manner for all his good intentions, and to lavish the most violent abuse on those with whom less than three weeks before they had been companions in the battle for civil and religious liberty. Great allowance is of course to be made for the hard position in which they were placed. After their release, and the tide had turned in favour of the Parlia mentarians, some of those who had expressed their contrite submission to the King again sided with the popular party, and in 1651 Andrew Sollace and Giles Hancox were the acting magistrates at Cirencester under the Commonwealth. A very rare Tract is mentioned in the published list (1864) of Mr. J. C. Hotten, of Piccadilly, entitled \" An exact relation of the Proceedings of the Cavaliers at Cicester, containing a true declaration of their Bloody Cruelties and the number of men slain on both sides. Printed February 14, 1642-3, for John Danvers.\" In the Library of R. Cholmondeley, Esq. (see Historical MSS. Commission, 5th Report), is a letter, dated February 7, 1641-2, from Francis Creswick. County Sheriff, to John Smith, of North Nibley, in obedience to instructions from the Speaker of the Commons and Knights of the Shire, to hold a public meeting at Portlocke's, Cirencester (see list p. 299), and to publish the protestation therewith sent. This protestation contained a petition"], [349, "NOTES AND APPENDIX. 303 and remonstrance signed by the county members and several Gloucestershire gentry, freeholders, &c, in reference to Episcopacy. The retention of the previous form of government in the Church and much of its ritual and doctrine by Henry VIII. was then natural, and in strict accordance with prevailing public sentiment, but the preaching of Ridley, Hooper, &c, and the persecutions of Mary, made the mass of the people decidedly more Protestant after Elizabeth's accession than their queen and teachers, most of whom had held benefices as Catholics under Mary. The National Church as reconstituted by Elizabeth was thus a compromise distasteful to the Hot Gospellers or Evangelicals, who subsequently, as Presbyterians and Independents, and in spite of the opposition of James and Charles, and the pretensions of Laud, became in the Civil War as powerful as the Episcopalians themselves. The Somers Tract, vol. vii. pp. 425-8, entitled \" The Royal Oak,\" by John Danvers, 1660, is an historical account of the adventures of Charles II. prior to his accession to the throne. After the battle of Worcester, Charles hurried from that city with several of his followers, but subsequently for safety left them and made his way to the house of a farmer named Penderell, at Boscobel, in Staffordshire. A great reward had been offered for his apprehension, and the threat of death held out against any who should conceal him, but Penderell clothed him in a garb like his own, and took him out with his brothers into the wood to fell trees. For twenty-four hours he here remained concealed amongst the leaves and branches of a large oak, after wards called by the title of our Tract. From this oak he watched several soldiers pass under in quest of him, and after much difficulty, and after enduring many hardships, reached the house of Mr. Lane, a Cavalier gentleman in the same county. Here it was arranged that he should attend Miss Lane in the capacity of man-servant in her journey to a relation's, near Bristol, where he intended to embark, but finding that no ship would leave for a month he made his way to Lyme Regis, in Dorset, where he narrowly escaped being arrested, and after assuming different disguises and exposure to imminent perils, sailed in a little barque from Brighton to Feschamp in Normandy. We gather from a lecture delivered by the author's father in 1859, after a perusal of certain old works, that during his journey from Staffordshire to Bristol he was known as Will Jackson, and at Mr. Tombs' house at Long Marston he was asked by the cook to wind up the jack, but excused his awkwardness by saying \" I am but a poor tenant's son of Colonel Lane's \u2014 we seldom have roast meat, and when we have we never use a jack.\" Charles was dressed in a suit of \" country grey.\" A Mr. Lascelles, who travelled with him part of the way, put up with him at the Sun, at Cirencester, and \" after supper a good bed was provided there for Mr. Lascelles, and a truckle bed in the same chamber for Will Jackson.\""], [350, "304 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER.

Mr. Winterbotham has since been returned unopposed as a Liberal Unionist for this Division, and Mr. (now Sir John) Dorington for the Tewkesbury Division, \u2014 Mr. Reginald Yorke, who was elected in 1885, not having sought re-election. Election of 1754. In the Bodleian Library is a printed pamphlet entitled A View of the Cirencester Contest (1754), containing papers that have appeared on both sides, by \" A friend to the Old Interest.\" Printed by G. Hill, Cirencester. It is interesting as showing the popular view of elections 130 years ago, and the manner in which they were conducted. The \" Old Interest \" was that of the Master family. Since Lord Bathurst had come to Cirencester, and the death of Ireton, there had been an understanding that each family should nominate a member, and this had lasted until this election. In 1 748 Thomas Master died, and the family put forward John Coxe, who was of course accepted by the townsmen. His colleague was Henry, the second son of his lordship. In 1754, John Coxe and Henry Bathurst sought re-election, and Lord Bathurst also put forward his eldest son, Benjamin. A determined opposition ensued, attended by a great deal of bitterness, an election riot, and a \" general engagement between the two mobs, wherein great numbers were wounded, and several carried off for dead, and one Jordan, who fought on the Bathursts' side, lost his life. One Minching, too, was found guilty of manslaughter.\" A society had been formed here in 1745 to further the cause of Charles Edward Stuart (see Rudder pp. 30-33), and Lord Bathurst, whose Stuart proclivities were well known, was twitted by the Coxites with truckling to the Dissenters, who before, they assert, were treated with contempt and injustice. Whatever truth there may have been in this, Coxe was hardly the man to have made it, and it redounds to the credit of his lordship that difference in thinking made no difference in friendship; for Mr. Parry, the Presbyterian minister subsequently became one of his most attached friends. The election terminated in the return of the Hon. Benjamin Bathurst and John Dawney, in place of the late members, Henry Bathurst being made a Justice of the Court of Common Pleas and after filling various offices, in 1771 becoming Lord Chancellor, and a peer of the realm with the title of Baron Apsley.

We have had placed in our hands certain election bills, songs, &c, referring to the elections from that of Sir Robert Preston forward ; it would serve no good purpose to publish these, and might tend to revive personalities which are best forgotten ; but it is satisfactory to note the highly improved state of public opinion in regard to the duties of electors. Lives of Cirencester Men. St. Alwyn, or Alhune (Bishop of Worcester) 844-872, whom we presume was the founder of the Collegiate Church (see pp. 19 and 49) was born at the neighbouring village of Coin St. Aldwyns,1 and was canonized on account of his earnest labours for the Church. He was probably the first dean of the new foundation before his promotion to the charge of the whole diocese. During his bishoprick he built the episcopal chapel at Kempsey, and the first London residence for himself and his successors. The history of Reimbald, the Norman favourite, and dean of the same church, has been already given. He had an estate at Reimberville, Normandy,2 and his name appears as a witness to several charters of Edward the Confessor.3 Alexander Neccham (or Nequam). \u2014 In a MS. chronicle in the possession of the Earl of Arundel it is written4 \" In the month of September, 1157, there was born to the King\" (Henry II.) \" at Windsor a son named Richard, and the same night was born Alexander Neckam at St. Alban's, whose mother gave suck to Richard with her right breast and to Alexander with her left breast.\" Alexander spent his early years in his native town, and appears from his own account to have received the education of his boyhood at the Abbey School, and when very young was entrusted with the management of the school at Dunstable, which was subordinate to St. Alban's Abbey. Thence he pro ceeded to the University of Paris, and became a professor there when only 23. Here he attached himself to the school of the Petit Pont, celebrated for the subtlety of its reasoning. In 1186 he returned to England, became master of Dunstable in 1187, and then applied for admission to the Benedictine Monastery of his native town in these terms \u2014 \" Si vis, veniam \u2014 sin autem, tu autem.\" The prior replied \" Si bonus sis, venias \u2014 si nequam, 1 Sir Robert Atkins. 2 Fosbroke. 3 Thorpe's Saxon Charters. 4 See Preface to Edition of Alexander Necham's Works, by Thomas Wright, Esq., M.A., F.S.A., published in 1863 by the Lords Commis sioners of the Treasury."], [355, "309 notes and appendix. nequaquam.\" On receiving this reply he was so disgusted at the pun on his name that he joined the Augustinians at Cirencester, and in 1213 was chosen Abbot. His death occurred in 1217 at Kempsey, at the residence of his close and intimate friend the Bishop of Worcester, whom he is said to have accompanied into Italy, and by whose directions he was buried in the cloisters of the cathedral church, with this rhyming epitaph \u2014 \" Ecelypsim patitur sapientia, sol sepelitur Qui dum vivebat studii genus omne vigebat Solvitur in cineres Neccham \u2014 cui si foret h\u00e6res In terris unus, minus esset flebili funus. \" In English \u2014 Wisdom suffers an eclipse \u2014 the sun is buried, Which being alive every kind of learning flourished ; Neccham is reduced to ashes, to whom if one heir Were left in the land, his death would be less to be lamented. It is said that it was on account of this friendship that he chose Cirencester, in Worcester diocese. He was certainly a remark able man, and no less than fifty-two works are known to have issued from his pen upon a variety of subjects, the most noted being \" De naturis rerum,\" a treatise on nature published with his poem \" De laudibus Divin\u00e6 sapienti\u00e6,\" or Of the praises of the Divine wisdom. He displays wonderful poetic talent (his Latin being very superior to the mongrel classics of the time), and a remarkable familiarity with the common things of nature, but his scientific views are crude, as might be expected, and were so regarded even by his contemporary, Roger Bacon, who said of him \" This Alexander in many things wrote what was true and useful, but he neither can nor ought by just title to be reckoned among authorities.\" He was conversant with the Scriptures, but his commentaries on the Psalms, &c, prove an intimacy with their history and idiomatic composition rather than any saving knowledge ; this need not be surprising considering the age in which he lived, but evidences are not wanting that whilst bound by a reverence for authority, he had aspirations for something higher than was taught in the schools of theology. He thus describes the Bath waters (we give the English translation) : \u2014 Virgil's famed baths o'er ours no palm can claim, Here old age blooms \u2014 here nimbly walks the lame, Congenial heats the long-lost strength restore, And pain afflicts the morbid frame no more. Whilst Abbot of Cirencester, he yielded to the name punning propensity which had offended him years before, and wrote the following uncomplimentary distich to his friend Philip, Abbot of Leicester : \u2014 Phi ! nota f\u00e6toris, lippus malus omnibus horis \u2014 Phi ! malus et lippus, totus malus ergb Philippus."], [356, "310 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. from whom he received the following retort : \u2014 Es niger et nequam, dictus cognomine Neccham, Nigrior esse potes \u2014 nequior esse nequis. Richard of Cirencester belonged to a very ancient family long resident in the town, his ancestor Hugh being a free tenant soon after the compilation of the Domesday Book. William of Cirencester was proctor for the Abbey in 1199. Nicholas held the same office for Malmesbury, and Walter was its abbot in 1263-64. A namesake of the subject of our sketch distinguished himself in 1232 by a rather undignified proceeding (see p. 72). In the same year Sir Thomas de Circestre is returned by the Heralds as a Gloucestershire Knight, with the arms \"Argente, une chevron azure et une labell goulis.\" Years later several of the family occur in the Dublin Rolls of names. A second Walter of Cirencester was made the King's esch\u00e6tor for Warwick and four other counties in 1335, and in 1340, in concert with four other county magnates, an assessor for the Nones Taxation for Gloucestershire. Richard was probably the son of this Walter, and was born about 1330. At an early age he became a monk of Westminster, his name occurring in the Chamberlain's list for 1355. He wrote several works, the MSS. of which still remain in various public libraries, and travelled throughout England, consulting the different monastic libraries for original MSS. On December 21, 1391, he obtained license from his abbot to make a pilgrimage to Rome with the same object, the license being still preserved amongst the Abbey of Westminster archives. Subse quently the abbot is said to have accompanied him and introduced him to the Pope, from whom it may be safely assumed that he was allowed the privilege of studying the valuable collection of ancient MSS. in the Vatican. Richard's most important work, the authenticity of which is undeniable, is his History of England from the arrival of Hengist to 1066, subsequently extended to 1348. His having omitted from this book the ordinary semi-legendary accounts of other medi\u00e6val writers in reference to the British and Roman periods, coupled with his visits to Rome and libraries elsewhere, afford strong evidence of an intention, at least, to publish a reliable history of Roman Britain, and he lived ten years to accomplish the task. The work, \" De Situ Britanni\u00e6,\" which bears his name, is by far the fullest account of Roman Britain, but by some modern writers has been asserted to be a forgery of Dr. Bertram, who, in 1747, professed to have discovered Richard's MS. at Copenhagen. If the work be an imposture it is an exceedingly clever one, for there is nothing in it inconsistent with the meagre accounts of Antonine and other writers. It is included in Bohn's Classical Library, and was praised most highly by the historian Gibbon, and by Dr. Stukeley, who published itin 1758. Richard,"], [357, "311 NOTES AND APPENDIX. if he be the author, claims to have obtained his information from the papers of a Roman general stationed in Britain, supposed to be Lollius Urbicus. The only circumstance to throw doubt on the genuineness of the work is that the MS. was not found amongst Bertram's papers after his death. Richard died in 1401 or 1402. Thomas Ruthall (or Rowthale), Bishop of Durham, described by Leland as born and bred up in Cirencester, has been already named as having bequeathed an annuity to the Grammar School master, and probably as having contributed to the Church. The date of his birth is uncertain, but he passed through his University career at Oxford, and early attracted the notice of Henry VII., who made him Dean of Salisbury; and, in 1503, appointed him Archdeacon of Gloucester, Chancellor of Cambridge University, and his private secretary ; and in 1509, shortly before he died, nominated him to the rich bishopric of Durham. By Henry VIII. he was made a member of the Privy Council, and in 1516 Lord Privy Seal. By these offices he became so engrossed with state affairs that he is said to have neglected those of his bishopric. He was present at the christening of the future Queen Mary, February 20, 1515-16, and on the Llth of the following month stood godfather to the son and heir of Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, and Queen Marie of France.1 He was deputed to conclude a treaty with France, also, in 1515, to attend the Princess Mary (sister of the King) thither, and on October 20, 1516, when the doctrines of the Reformation were making a stir in England, to attend at a convention with Wolsey and the Duke of Norfolk, convened to form a league for the defence of the Church, with which the Pope and Emperor, Joanna and Charles of Castile, and others were associated. He is said to have been worth \u00a3100,000, an enormous sum in those days, and was accounted the richest man in England. He died in 1524, and his death is said to have been hastened by the following circumstance related by Holinshed. Having received from the King a command to compile statistics of the national wealth and revenue and completed his task, the Kin\u00b0- sent for the book, but by mistake the servant handed another, the exact counterpart of that required, containing a detailed account of his private possessions. The book was received by Wolsey, and this unprincipled man, who succeeded Ruthall in the see of Durham, handed it to the King, hinting that if he wanted money he now knew where to obtain it. Ruthall discovered the mistake, but too late, and the occurrence so preyed on his mind that he outlived the event but a short time. 1 In those days a person of high standing was sought for as sponsor by the middle class. The selection of Ruthall on this occasion may be considered a high compliment."], [358, "312 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. William Cartwright, a minor poet of the 17th century, was the son of a gentleman of decayed fortune who kept an inn at Cirencester, where he, the poet, was born in 1611. His early education was received at the Grammar School, afterwards he went to Westminster School, and thence to Oxford University, of which he became junior proctor and teacher of metaphysics ; but his career was soon after cut short by a malignant fever which raged there in 1643. He was a member of the council of war formed when Charles established his head quarters at Oxford, and he must have witnessed his unfortunate townsmen brought there by Rupert. In very early life he was the friend of Ben Jonson, who said of him, \" My son Cartwright writes all like a man.\" Cartwright's poems and plays were published in 1647, and again in 1651. His play, \"The Ordinary,\" is said to possess considerable merit. Dr. Jenner, the celebrated discoverer of vaccination, was the son of a clergyman at Berkeley, where he was born in 1749. He was educated at Cirencester Grammar School, then apprenticed to a surgeon at Chipping Sodbury, and entered at St. George's Hospital, London, where he became a friend of the celebrated Dr. Hunter; then returning home, he commenced practice in Berkeley in 1773. Whilst studying at Sodbury, a milk girl told him that she had had the cow-pox, and was therefore proof against small-pox, and this he related to Dr. Hunter and other members of the medical profession. By them it was regarded as a delusion, but Jenner's observation assured him that there were grounds for the statement, and for sixteen years he pursued a series of experiments, which consisted of inserting matter from the udder of the cow in persons who were afterwards, according to the custom of the time, inoculated for the small-pox. These resulted in showing that it was only in a certain state that virus could be obtained as a preventive against small-pox. The virus had in each case been taken direct from the cow, but in 1796 he vaccinated a boy from a pustule on the hand of a milk girl, and this boy was subsequently inoculated for small-pox, but, as he predicted, the inoculation produced no effect. All doubt of the value of Jenner's discovery was now removed, and it spread throughout Europe and America. Parliament granted him \u00a310,000 in 1802, and in 1807 \u00a320,000, and honours were showered upon him by foreign princes. Jenner refused to quit his native town to gain increased wealth in London, and died at Berkeley in 1823. Samuel Bowly. \u2014 For similar reasons which have induced us to omit details of some recent events, we have deemed it advisable to abstain from records of many Cirencester worthies who might justly have found a place in our list, but we are convinced that"], [359, "NOTES AND APPENDIX. 313 we shall not be considered guilty of undue preference in singling out for special notice the career of one who has recently departed from us, for the part taken in slave emancipation and in that movement which under the Divine blessing has delivered many free-born Britons from a yoke worse than even negro bondage. Mr. Samuel Bowly, a member of a family long settled here, was born in Cirencester March 23, 1802. His father and brothers were all engaged in the town in commercial pursuits, but he left the place of his birth about 1830, and started in Gloucester as a wholesale cheesemonger, &c. It was about that time that the cause of Clarkson and Wilberforce was warmly agitated, and Mr. Bowly was roused to indignation by the notorious Peter Borthwick, the paid agitator and M.P. of the pro slavery party. Mr. Bowly confronted him, following him from town to town, and at an anti-slavery meeting in the King's Head Assembly Room, the late Dean Close1 in the chair, spoke for four hours, Borthwick being present with his followers ; and at the Shire Hall, Gloucester, so completely discomfited him that Borthwick, who had just before been worsted at Stroud by the vigorous eloquence of Benjamin Parsons,2 had to retreat amid expressions of disgust, and exclaimed \" I thought the Stroud blackguards bad enough, but the Gloucester blackguards are ten times worse.\" August 1st, 1834, witnessed the end of negro slavery in the British colonies. About this time Mr. Bowly became a convert to the views of Joseph Livesy and the seven men who in 1832 inaugurated at Preston the Total Abstinence movement. He signed the pledge December 30, 1835, and after many years' advocacy of its principles became President of the National Temperance League. On his 80th birthday, he was presented with several illuminated addresses, at a public meeting in Gloucester, at which the Bishop, himself an ardent temperance worker, was present. On Saturday, March 22, 1884, he retired to rest in his usual health, having written to Mr. Bullock, of Cirencester, stating that on account of his age and the imperative necessity of his using his health and strength in the temperance cause, he would be unable to attend the Sunday School conference to be held there the following Good Friday. That same evening Mr. Bowly's house was literally full of flowers and birthday memorials, sent from all parts of the country, and his family had gathered under the paternal roof to celebrate on the morrow his 82nd birthday, but in the morning he was seized with acute pain and died about nine p.m. Mr. Bowly was a member of the Society of Friends, and a thoroughly sincere and liberal minded Christian, and the exhibition of popular respect at his funeral, which was attended by clergy and members of all denominations, probably exceeded anything 1 Then Vicar of Cheltenham, afterward, till his death, Dean of Carlisle. - Baptist Minister at Ebley, near Stroud."], [360, "314 HISTORY OF CIRENCESTER. before witnessed in Gloucester. Mr. Bowly was a member of the Peace Society, and had laboured on behalf of corn law repeal, popular education, and many other good measures.
