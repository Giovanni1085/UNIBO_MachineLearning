The verses gathered here have been chosen from poems which appeared in The United Irishman and The Celtic Christmas, and more largely from manuscripts entrusted to me by writers too shy to venture on even the momentary publicity of a weekly paper. I have thought these verses deserved a better fate than to be read by one or two, not only on account of the beauty of much of the poetry, but because it revealed a new mood in Irish verse. There is no sign that the tradition created by the poets of The Nation which had inspired so many young poets in Ireland has influenced the writers represented here. Miss Alice Milligan has indeed written memorable verses, I think the best patriotic poetry written in -Ireland in my time ; but, as these are to be issued shortly in a separate volume, I have chosen to represent her here by verses no less Irish in spirit and more in accord with my purpose which was to show some of the new ways the wind of poetry listeth to blow in Ireland to-day. There may be traces here and there of the influence of othet Irish poets, but there is no mere echoing of greater voices, while some of the writers have a marked originality of their own. I have hardly ever performed any task with greater pleasure than the editing of these verses. I believe the little book will give some of the same pleasure to others, and that among these new writers are names which may well be famous hereafter. A. E."], [10, ""], [11, "CONTENTS.

(A poor scholar in the \" Forties \"). My eyelids red and heavy are With bending o'er the smouldering peat The \u00c6neid now I know by heart : I have read it in cold and heat In loneliness and hunger-smart. And I know Homer too, I ween, As Munster poets know Oisin. And I must walk this road that winds 'Twixt bog and bog, while east there lies A city with its men and books With treasures open for the wise, Heart-words from equals, comrade-looks. Down here they have but tale and song. They talk Repeal the whole night long. \" You teach Greek verbs and Latin nouns,\" The dreamer of Young Ireland said, \" And do not hear the muffled call, The sword being forged, the far off tread Of host to meet as Gael and Gall. What good to us your wisdom store. Your Latin verse, your Grecian lore ?\" And what to me is Gael and Gall ? Less, ah far less than Latin, Greek. I teach these by the dim rush-light, In smoky cabins, night and week. But what avail my teaching slight ? Years hence in rustic speech, a phrase, As in wild earth a Grecian vase. Padraic Colum"], [14, "10 A SONG OF FREEDOM. In Cavan of little lakes, As I was walking with the wind. And no one seen beside me there, There came a song into my mind : It came as if the whispered voice Of one, but none of humankind, Who walked with me in Cavan then, And he invisible as wind. On Urris, of Inish-Owen, As I went up the mountainside, The brook that came leaping down Cried to me, for joy it cried ; And when from off the summit far I looked o'er land and water wide, I was more joyous than the brook That met me on the mountainside. To Ara, of Connacht's isles, As I went sailing o'er the sea, The wind's word, the brook's word, The wave's word, was plain to me \u2014 \" As we are, though she is not. As we are shall Banba be \u2014 There is no King can ride the wind There is no fetter for the sea.\" Alice Milligan"], [15, "11 THE WAVES OF BREFFNY. The grand road from the mountain goes shining to the sea, And there is traffic on it and many a horse and cart ; But the little roads of Cloonagh are dearer far to me And the little roads of Cloonagh go rambling through my heart. A great storm from the ocean goes shouting o'er the hill, And there is glory in it, and terror on the wind ; But the haunted air of twilight is very strange and still, And the little winds of twilight are dearer to my mind. The great waves of the Atlantic sweep storming on their way, Shining green and silver with the hidden herring shoal ; But the little waves of Breffny have drenched my heart in spray, And the little waves of Breffny go stumbling through my soul.

The wind that wails about the world Came with you through the open door : My joy dun into ruin hurled Lay desolate for ever more. I built for you a house of dream Fair as the pearly light of morn : Its pillars caught an opal gleam From skies where night was never born. The wind that blows the stars to flame Blew through my house and left it bare : The beauty vanished when it came The columns melted into air. The next house that I build for you I'll build with suns and moon-fire white, Vaster than those the wind swept through Its halls star-paved shall front the night. Mayhap you'll come and wander there When all the winds are laid to rest, And find its sun -bright beauty fair Beyond the glow in east or west. Mayhap its radiant fire must fade Before the wind that wakes the dawn, The light from Heaven's heart outrayed, When suns and moons are all withdrawn."], [17, "The wind that beats the stars to dust May beat my star built courts away. Let my dun fall, if fall it must- Its glory lasted for a day. I care not if I lose anew Or round the wreck what winds may wail, Since God's own dun was built for you You are not houseless, though I fail. Ella Young. i3"], [18, "14 THE DEVOTEE. ' The Autumn wind sighs through the trees, Disturbing all my garnered ease, The brown leaves stir a fluttering thought With half-repented memories fraught. Dear God, how sweet the pain of sin That opens doors to let Thee in. How strange that Nature too should know The ecstasy of sin's wild glow ; How strange that in this way my soul Should feel its union with the whole. And yet may God not thus impart Himself unto the seeking heart ? Thomas Keohler"], [19, "15 THE TWILIGHT PEOPLE. It is a whisper among the hazel bushes ; It is a long, low, whispering voice that fills With a sad music the bending and swaying rushes ; It is a heart beat deep in the quiet hills. Twilight people why will you still be crying, Crying and calling to me out of the trees ? For under the quiet grass the wise are lying And all the strong ones are gone over the seas, And I am old, and in my heart at your calling Only the old dead dreams a-fluttering go, As the wind, the forest wind, in its falling Sets the withered leaves fluttering to and fro.

Earth savage, earth broken, the brutes, the dawn-man there in the sunset ! And the plough that is twin to the sword, that is founder of cities ! \" Brute-tamer, plough-maker, earth-breaker !

There are ages between us ! \"Is it praying you are as you stand there, alone in the sunset ? \" Surely our sky-born gods can be nought to you, Earth-child and Earth-master ! \" Surely your thoughts are of Pan, or of Wotan or Dana ! \" Yet why give thought to the gods ? Has Pan led your brutes where they stumble ? \" Has Wotan put hands to your plough or Dana numbed pain of the child-bed ?\" \" What matter your foolish reply, 0 man standing lone and bowed earthward. \" Your task is a day near its close. Give thanks to the night-giving God.\" Slowly the darkness falls, the broken lands blend with the savage, The brute-tamer stands by the brutes, by a head's breadth only above them ! A head's breadth, ay, but therein is Hell's depth and the height up to Heaven, And the thrones of the gods, and their halls and their chariots, purples and splendours. Padraic Colum."], [21, "17 6 FROM EAST TO WEST. Great ships glided into the port : Surely the ships of the gods laden with dreams : And men said \" It is well ; \" They have brought their dreams to us as of old, And now new tales shall be told.\" But the gods stood on the decks aghast : They saw the earth an iron port, The air a silver citadel. The sky a fortress built of solid gold. Then Prani said \" Here is no place for our dreams.\" So they flung the great sails over the mast, And sailed out slowly across the seas, Till they came to a twilight land in the west Where old unquiet mysteries And pale discrowned spirits dwell ; Where the wind sings a song with a golden lilt And the air flows by in silver streams. There, in wild wastes of the world they built An ivory castle for their dreams. Eva Gore-Booth."], [22, "18 A NOCTURNE. In memory of Marjorie Arthur. On a night of sorrow I cried aloud her name. God, who heard, said, \" Hasten,\" and in my dream she came. She stood ; I saw her clearly by the moon's white flame ; Her eyes were sweet as ever ; her voice was yet the same. No illumining radiance lit her girlish brow \u2014 As in life I loved her, I beheld her now ; I smiled in joy to greet her, nor did I think it strange That death had wrought no change. She bore with her no blossoms unknown to earthly land, No tall, white flowers of paradise, stately and grand ; There were violets on her breast \u2014 blue violets\u2014 And a red rose in her hand. \" How have you gathered ? \" I asked my gentle one, \" In that unchanging region of never-ceasing sun, Where the March wind blows never, and no rain shower ever wets, Those little violets ? \" \" I have had them long,\" she said ; \" I have loved them much, They were the last flowers given my living hands to touch, And in the fevered night of pain before my death, Sweet was the fragrance of their breath.\""], [23, "19 \"But surely you have gathered in the celestial land That other flower which lovingly is kept in your hand ?

Seaward, north of Derry, it fed on sun and dew ; It was a gift from you.\" And I shall always treasure it as priceless in worth, God has made nothing fairer than the little flowers of earth, As He has no more to give in His heaven above, Than your own heart's gift of never-changing love. Alice Milligan."], [24, "20 LOVE'S MENDICANT. What do I want of thee ? No gift of smile or tear Nor casual company. But in still speech to me Only thy heart to hear. Others contentedly Go lonely here and there : I cannot pass thee by, Love's mendicant am I Who meet thee everywhere. No merchandise I make : Thou mayst not give to me The counterfeits they take. I claim Him for Love's sake The Hidden One in thee. Susan L. Mitchell,"], [25, "21 THE CALL. From the fireside of your heart Where love blew the peats aglow, I arise, I will depart, I must go. Peace was dwelling in your eyes, But across my soft content, Gleams like rays in midnight skies Quivered and went. 1 arise though blind with tears To fare forth on the long way. When the beckoning gleam appears I must obey. George Roberts"], [26, "22 THE SORROW OF LOVE. I whispered my great sorrow To every listening sedge ; And they bent, bowed with my sorrow Down to the water's edge. But she stands and laughs lightly To see me sorrow so, Like the light winds that laughing Across the water go. If I could tell the bright ones That quiet-hearted move, They would bend down like the sedges With the sorrow of love. But she stands laughing lightly Who all my sorrow knows, Like the little wind that laughing Across the water blows. Seumas O'Sullivan"], [27, "23 THE REVOLT AGAINST ART. The earth bends to her dream : the obdurate marble serves Her will, flowing about her soul in gracious lines, Rose white as sunlit waves, a mystery of pale curves Flung up in palace walls or dreaming over shrines. One beauty moulds the fragile clay in many forms, Till men who build seem but the shadow of strange powers ; And the wild southern sea with all her clouds and storms Bends low beneath the yoke of a white host of towers. So doth the round arch of the blue air Byzantine Seem but the jewelled slave of her dethroned desire : Yet far from the unfolding of her loveliest line Burn the free spiral flames and cones of wind blown fire. I have seen broken veils of twilight folded round A purer mystery than the rich marbles hold, Where from of old the mountain-throned beauty frowned On carven forms divine and towers inlaid with gold. The austere Beauty with proud ethereal brows Moulds not the dusty clay, thinks scorn of the hard stone : But through her dreams the shadows of forest boughs Waves o'er the towers of the world broken and overthrown. Eva Gore-Booth."], [28, "24 APOLOGY. In the garden of my youth Where the flowers' pale perfumes swayed Passion called me and I went Fearfully yet undismayed. In the garden left my dreams Of a life that might have grown Silently to interweave With the spirit world alone. Why should I thus meekly yield At the first sound of a voice ; At the beckoning of a finger Rush like one without a choice ? Could the heart that nursed and reared All my youth's pale bloom of dreams, Also bear this flaring foliage With its blossoms' fiery gleams ? Surely not a chance desire Lent my feet the will to go ; But a deeper thinking, sinking To the soul of things below : But a deeper blending, twining, With the bright ones on their way, And a fiercer fire divining In the buried heart of clay. And as peace can ne'er be mine Until every way is trod, With a heart sincere I go Passion's cloud-strewn path to God Thomas Keohler"], [29, "25 THE LIVING CHALICE. The mother sent me on the Holy Quest Timid and proud, and curiously drest, In vestures by her hand wrought wondrously : An eager, burning heart she gave to me. The Bridegroom's feast was set and I drew nigh. Master of Life, thy Cup has passed me by. Before, new drest, I from the Mother came, In dreams I saw the dazzling Cup of flame ; Ah, divine chalice, how my heart drank deep : Waking, I sought the love I knew asleep. The Feast of Life was set and I drew nigh. Master of Life, thy Cup has passed me by. Eyes of the Soul, awake, awake and see Growing within the ruby-radiant tree ; Sharp pain has wrung the clusters of my Vine : My heart is rose red with its brimmed Wine.

Deep in some ancient forest fragrant with primeval dew Two stately forest trees with intermingling boughs we grew, When I went fierce in gold and black, by cave and rock and pool And wooded way, you went beside me lithe and beautiful. When challenging the light exultant through the air I sped You flew beside me ; all the heaven was our bridal bed. And when beneath the soundless deep of watery ways I went For you I fought the hosts of ocean, proud and jubilant.

Once face to face with thee Odysseus came In the lone island when the gods had hurled His ship to ruin on an alien sea : And I may reach thee, Ashless Heart of Flame, When I have wrecked for thee the narrow world Fate built about me, and my soul is free.

[Written on hearing that Ethna Carbery's home was to be at Revlin, Donegal, in the neigh- bourhood of scenes I had often described to her.) I have heard where your home will be, Between the harbour and the outer sea, Where at calm flow of tide the shadows fall Of the Abbey of Donegal, The place most sacred of the world to me. If I could tell you all : If I could tell \u2014 but this you well may know- How at an hour of evening, ye**rs ago, When summer day sombred to summer night Through luminous twilight, When the far gleam and fainter afterglow Of sunset radiance high in heaven still Made shine of water, with the Abbey Hill Shadowed in it below, I sat for long among the place of graves, And heard the soft wind pass Whispering along the grass, As softly whispering came the wash of waves Around that place of graves : And all the joy of life and peace of death Were one within me at the murmurous breath Of that so softly moving summer air Stirring about me there \u2014 Such was my solemn dreaming, but not all In the Abbey of Donegal. Another day, When hills were greening with the growth of May, I sailed beyond the Abbey to the sea, And he whom you have chosen waked for me"], [56, "52 The voices of the echo-answering hill, And brought me to the island where is still A garden grown to wildness in a wood Around a silent hall of solitude, And^ further where the surges of the bay Whiten for leagues along a sanded shore With sunlit flash and roar I waded in the shallows long and late Till came the boatmen's call we must not wait, So we delayed no more : Then since the outward ebb of tide was strong In the mid-current's flowing, On smoother waters ever winding in Our boat was steered for rowing, By base of hills bright with the fire of the whin, And whitethorn walling all the lanes like snow' And apple-boughs that shed their blossom on The sunlit dazzle of a country lawn, And lilac trees below. I told you after of this flower-girt bay (For you were far away) In words like these, \" The Kingdom of Heaven may be As beautiful \u2014 not more beautiful to me.\" And now your home is here Beyond the wood walk, by the water clear. The branching apple trees You write to tell us of, are surely these \u25a0 That shed their blossom where I drifted by- Snow from a sapphire sky. And some day in the spring's delightful weather I will be with you, we will see together The hawthorn at its whitest, and the whin In hills of living gold, and in the hedge she fragrant pyres of lilac flower begin Close by the water edge."], [57, "53 No. II. \u2014 April, 1902. I was summoned. I am here Y\\ ith those in all the world to her most dear ; I had no welcome from Her when I came \u2014 No blithe voice from the threshold called my name, No quick hand drew me in from the rain and wind, And shut the door behind, And led me to the warmth of the leaping fire, Whilst gay eyes sparkled keenly with desire To hear me tell all \" strange adventures \" o'er, Met since we talked before. This was Her way of welcome still to me, Such was our gladness who can never be So merry any more. But here is strangest quietness instead ; Low voices \u2014 hushed about the lately dead, Through the long night of waiting where she died, Whilst the woods roar outside, And always, always on the window-pane, Is heard the incessant clamour of the rain Until the daw-n. At dawn Comes sudden stillness, and I walk upon The hill-side sloping to the water edge ; And o'er the Abbey of my solemn dreaming See light of sunrise beaming, But see no green upon the hawthorn hedge ; The apple-trees upon her garden lawn Stand gaunt and bare-branched in the shine of dawn, I know they will be beautiful in May, But \u2014 She has gone away.

The tides and surges of your savage sea To my tired spirit are an agony. Broken my wings indeed, I cannot fly, I've lived in the low valley far too- long. My heart, tuned to the sea-bird's lonesome cry, Can give no echo to> your tireless song \u2014 Voice of God's armies jubilant and strong. To the great silences in dreams I go Where my own mountains brood eternally, World-old the heart I lean my heart unto : Memories of battles won come back to me Arming my soul for battles yet to be.

(Called by the country people \" Star of Bethlehem.\") Ye who in old days dared to wander far Beside the haunted springs of Hippocrene, And ye, wise men, who followed your star, Look down on our pale land of gray and green ; And see by these white tokens in the grass Here too the footsteps of the Gods have been. Yea, though the black smoke of the world can mar The vision sleeping in its magic glass, Star-smitten still the hearts of wanderers are : The moon sits throned in her silver car, And in her shadow floating dimly seen The great dreams smile upon us as they pass.

What though the last wild song of time Were fluttering o'er with dying chime Life's little sad futility ; And all adown the pearly sky Streamed angels' tones to1 multiply In ceaseless mutability. Yet would I fain employ my breath In chanting as I strode to death, Unsilenced midst fatalities, The frail and precious things that pass, That fade and die like summer grass, Old earth's unsung regalities.
