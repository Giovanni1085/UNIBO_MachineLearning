IF I did not fear that it would appear to my readers like arrogancy, or if it did not seem to myself indecorous to send two volumes of considerable magnitude from the press without preface or apology, with- out one petition for the reader's attention, or one plea for the writer's defects, I would most willingly spare myself an ad- dress of this kind, and more especially for these reasons ; first, because a preface is a part of a book seldom honoured by a reader's perusal ; secondly, because it is both difficult and distressing to write that which we think will be disregarded ; and thirdly, because I do not conceive that I am called upon for such introductory matter by any of the mo-"], [14, "PREFACE.

When a writer, whether of poetry or prose, first addresses the public, he has generally something to offer which relates to himself or to his work, and which he considers as a necessary prelude to the work itself, to prepare his readers for the entertainment or the instruction they may expect to receive, for one of these every man who publishes must suppose he affords \u2014 this the act itself implies ; and in proportion to his conviction of this fact must be his feeling of the diffi culty in which he has placed himself: the difficulty consists in reconciling the implied presumption of the undertaking, whether to please or to instruct mankind, with the dif fidence and modesty of an untried candidate for fame or favour. Hence originate the many reasons an author assigns for his appearance in that character, whether they actually exist,"], [15, "PREFACE. IX or are merely offered to hide the motives which cannot be openly avowed ; namely, the want or the vanity of the man, as his wishes for profit or reputation may most pre vail with him. Now, reasons of this kind, whatever they may be, cannot be availing beyond their first appearance. An author, it is true, may again feel his former apprehensions, may again be elevated or depressed by the suggestions of vanity and diffidence, and may be again subject to the cold and hot fit of aguish ex pectation ; but he is no more a stranger to the press, nor has the motives or privileges of one who is. With respect to myself, it is certain they belong not to me. Many years have elapsed since I became a candidate for indulgence as an inexperienced writer ; and to assume the language of such writer now, and to plead for his indulgences, would be proof of my ignorance of the place assigned"], [16, "PREFACE. X to me, and the degree of favour which I have experienced ; but of that place I am not un informed, and with that degree of favour I have no reason to be dissatisfied. It was the remark of the pious, but on some occasions the querulous author of the Night Thoughts, that he had ' been so long remembered, he was forgotten ;' an expres sion in which there is more appearance of discontent than of submission : if he had patience, it was not the patience that smiles at grief. It is not therefore entirely in the sense of the good Doctor that I apply these words to myself, or to my more early publica tions. So many years indeed have passed since their first appearance, that I have no reason to complain, on that account, if they be now slumbering with other poems of decent reputation in their day \u2014 not dead indeed, nor entirely forgotten, but certainly not the subjects of discussion or conversation"], [17, "PREFACE. XI as when first introduced to the notice of the public, by those whom the public will not forget, whose protection was credit to their author, and whose approbation was fame to them. Still these early publications had so long preceded any other, that, if not altoge ther unknown, I was, when I came again before the public, in a situation which ex cused, and perhaps rendered necessary some explanation ; but this also has passed away, and none of my readers will now take the trouble of making any inquiries respecting my motives for writing or for publishing these Tales or verses of any description : known to each other as readers and authors are known, they will require no preface to bespeak their good wdl, nor shall I be under the necessity of soliciting the kindness which experience has taught me, endeavouring to merit, I shall not fad to receive. There is one motive \u2014 and it is a powerful"], [18, "XII PREFACE. one \u2014 which sometimes induces an author, and more particularly a poet, to ask the attention of his readers to his prefatory address. This is when he has some favourite and peculiar style or manner which he would explain and defend, and chiefly if he should have adopted a mode of versification of which an uninitiated reader wTas not likely to perceive either the merit or the beauty. In such case it is natural, and surely pardonable, to assert and to prove, as far as reason will bear us on, that such me thod of writing has both ; to show in what the beauty consists, and what peculiar difficulty there is, which, when conquered, creates the merit. How far any particular poet has or has not succeeded in such attempt is not my business nor my purpose to inquire : I have no peculiar notion to defend, no poetical heterodoxy to support, nor theory of any kind to vindicate or oppose \u2014 that which I have used is probably the most common measure in our language; and therefore,"], [19, "PREFACE. XIII whatever be its advantages or defects, they are too well known to require from me a description of the one, or an apology for the other. Perhaps still more frequent than any ex planation of the work is an account of the author himself, the situation in which he is placed, or some circumstances of peculiar kind in his life, education, or employment. How often has youth been pleaded for de ficiencies or redundancies, for the existence of which youth may be an excuse, and yet be none for their exposure. Age too has been pleaded for the errors and failings in a work which the octogenarian had the discernment to perceive, and yet had not the fortitude to suppress. Many other circumstances are made apologies for a writer's infirmities ; \u2022 his much employment, and many avocations, ad versity, necessity, and the good of mankind. These, or any of them, however availing in"], [20, "XIV PREFACE. themselves, avail not me. I am neither so young nor so old, so much engaged by one pursuit, or by many, \u2014 I am not so urged by want, or so stimulated by a desire of public benefit, \u2014 that I can borrow one apology from the many which I have named. How far they prevail with our readers, or with our judges, I cannot tell ; and it is unnecessary for me to inquire into the validity of arguments which I have not to produce. If there be any combination of circum stances which may be supposed to affect the mind of a reader, and in some degree to influence his judgment, the junction of youth, beauty, and merit in a female writer may be allowed to do this ; and yet one of the most forbidding of titles is ' Poems by a very young Lady,' and this although beauty and merit were largely insinuated. Ladies, it is true, have of late little need of any indulgence as authors, and names may readily be found"], [21, "PREFACE. XV which rather excite the envy of man than plead for his lenity. Our estimation of title also in a writer has materially varied from that of our predecessors ; ' Poems by a Noble man' would create a very different sensation in our minds from that which was formerly excited when they were so announced. A noble author had then no pretensions to a seat so secure on the \u25a0 sacred hill,' that authors not noble, and critics not gentle, dared not attack; and they delighted to take revenge by their contempt and derision of the poet, for the pain which their submission and re spect to the man had cost them. But in our times we find that a nobleman writes, not merely as well, but better than other men ; insomuch that readers in general begin to fancy that the Muses have relinquished their old partiality for rags and a garret, and are become altogether aristocratical in their choice. A conceit so well supported by fact would be readily admitted, did it not appear"], [22, "XVI PREFACE. at the same time, that there were in the higher ranks of society men, who could write as tamely, or as absurdly, as they had ever been accused of doing. We may, therefore, regard the works of any noble author as ex traordinary productions ; but must not found any theory upon them ; and, notwithstand ing their appearance, must look on genius and talent as we are wont to do on time and chance, that happen indifferently to all mankind. But whatever influence any peculiar situa tion of a writer might have, it cannot be a benefit to me, who have no such peculiarity. I must rely upon the wdlingness of my readers to be pleased with that which was designed to give them pleasure, and upon the cordiality which naturally springs from a remembrance of our having before parted without any feel ings of disgust on the one side, or of mor tification on the other."], [23, "PREFACE. XVII With this hope I would conclude the pre sent subject ; but I am called upon by duty to acknowledge my obligations, and more especially for two of the following Tales : \u2014 the Story of Lady Barbara, in Book XVI. and that of Ellen in Book XVIII. The first of these I owe to the kindness of a fair friend, who will, I hope, accept the thanks which I very gratefully pay, and pardon me if I have not given to her relation the advantages which she had so much reason to expect. The other story, that of Ellen, could I give it in the language of him who related it to me, would please and affect my readers. It is by no means my only debt, though the one I now more particularly acknowledge ; for who shall describe all that he gains in the social, the unrestrained, and the frequent conversations with a friend, who is at once communicative and judicious? \u2014 whose opi nions, on all subjects of literary kind, are founded on good taste, and exquisite feeling P vol. i. b"], [24, "XVIII PREFACE. It is one of the greatest ' pleasures of my memory' to recal in absence those con versations ; and if I do not in direct terms mention with whom I conversed, it is both because I have no permission, and my readers will have no doubt. The first intention of the poet must be to please ; for, if he means to instruct, he must render the instruction which he hopes to con vey palatable and pleasant. I will not assume the tone of a moralist, nor promise that my relations shall be beneficial to mankind ; but I have endeavoured, not unsuccessfully I trust, that, in whatsoever I have related or described, there should be nothing introduced which has a tendency to excuse the vices of man, by associating with them sentiments that demand our respect, and talents that compel our admiration. There is nothing in these pages which has the mischievous effect of confounding truth and error, or confusing"], [25, "PREFACE. XIX our ideas of right and wrong. I know not which is most injurious to the yielding minds of the young, to render virtue less respect able by making its possessors ridiculous, or by describing vice with so many fascinating qualities, that it is either lost in the assem blage, or pardoned by the association. Man's heart is sufficiently prone to make excuse for man's infirmity ; and needs not the aid of poetry, or eloquence, to take from vice its native deformity. A character may be re spectable with all its faults, but it must not be made respectable by them. It is grievous when genius will condescend to place strong and evil spirits in a commanding view, or excite our pity and admiration for men of talents, degraded by crime, when struggling with misfortune. It is but too true that great and wicked men may be so presented to us, as to demand our applause, when they should excite our abhorrence ; but it is surely for the interest of mankind, and our own self-direc-"], [26, "PREFACE.

It may appear to some that a minister of religion, in the decline of life, should have no leisure for such amusements as these ; and for them I have no reply ; \u2014 but to those who are more indulgent to the propensities, the studies, and the habits of mankind, I offer some apology when I produce these volumes, not as the occupations of my life, but the fruits of my leisure, the employment of that time which, if not given to them, had passed in the vacuity of unrecorded idleness ; or had been lost in the indulgence of unregistered thoughts and fancies, that melt away in the instant they are conceived, and ' leave not a wreck behind.'"], [27, "CONTENTS TO VOL.

He and his pastor cordially agreed ; Convinced that they who would the truth obtain By disputation, find their efforts vain ; The church he view'd as liberal minds will view, And there he fix'd his principles and pew.

The public waters are to none denied, All drink the stream, but only few must guide ; There must be reservoirs to hold supply, And channels form'd to send the blessing by ; The public good must be a private care, None all they would may have, but all a share : So we must freedom with restraint enjoy, What crowds possess they will, uncheck'd, destroy ; And hence, that freedom may to all be dealt, Guards must be fix'd, and safety must be felt."], [41, "Book I.
