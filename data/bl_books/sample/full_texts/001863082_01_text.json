He used to set the breakfast, clean the grates, and light the fire, And do all kinds of house-work. Tom. And never any hire ? Gran. No, no, he did it all for love.

Then she's my prisoner. 2nd Fairy. But list to me one moment, ere you awaken her. She's not entirely selfish, 'tis for her mother's sake, She hoped by selling flowers a little sum to make. Therefore let me remind you, I may be still her friend, I, too, have gifts to offer. 1st Fairy. All must on her depend. Come, let us make our offers, and see what she will say ; I do not think your copy-books will be her choice to-day. [Prit rubs her eyes, awakes, sits up. Prit. Is it a dream, or can they fairies be ? I'll keep quite still, perhaps they will speak to me."], [172, "LITTLE PRIT. 14 2nd Fairy. Why do you sleep out in the cold this rainy evening, child ? Why is your frock so ragged, your hair all hang- ing wild ? Surely you know it's very wrong so far away to roam. I've come to warn and help you, and lead you to your home. 1st Fairy. Don't look at her ; I, too, have come with presents rich and rare. Just see these lovely playthings ; they're all for you, my dear. Prit. For me ? How nice ! (Aside) My dream is true. I must be careful, though, In all I say, for fairies are hard to please, I know. The tall one is the prettiest, I like her face the best, The other's rather gloomy, and not so nicely dressed. I wonder if she's powerful. If I am rude maybe She'll change me to a grasshopper or to a bumble-bee."], [173, "LITTLE PRIT. 15 (Aloud) May I not stay a little while, and earn some money here ? My father's often out of work, and food is very dear. I sold some flowers this morning. 1st Fairy. You are a clever child ! What does it matter if your hair does look a little wild, If you are earning money ? Prit. Yes, see what I have got. 2nd Fairy. Your mother sent you off to school \u2014 come, tell me, did she not ? Prit. Well, yes, she did ; but then I thought . . . 2nd Fairy. Attention, if you please. It does not matter what you thought. Just tell me, what are these ? [2nd Fairy holds up slate and copy-book. Prit. A slate and copy-book. 2nd Fairy. Quite right ; you've seen such things before. You've often been to school, then ? Prit. I'm not going any more."], [174, "LITTLE PRIT. 16 2nd Fairy. Indeed ! Why not ? Prit. I have not time ; I'm going to work instead. 1st Fairy. And quite right too; why should you go ? \u2014 you've learnt to write and read. That's quite enough. Now listen to what I have in store \u2014 A tiny house, all for your own, furnished from roof to floor, Where you may dwell in safety, and please your- self all day. There are no rates or taxes, you'll have no rent to pay. I'll see to that. Prit. How charming ! And may my mother come To live with me ? 1st Fairy. Impossible ! she's happier far at home. You need not think about her, but play and sing all day. Well, will you come ?"], [175, "LITTLE PRIT. 17 Prit. Oh, thank you ; but what will mother say ? \u2022She'll be so sorry if I go. 2nd Fairy. Give heed to me, I pray. For though you are so foolish, I am your friend to-day. Get up in time to-morrow, put on your hat and frock, Go with your little brothers to school at nine o'clock. Be careful and attentive,learn to do sums and spell, Cross all your t's, and dot your i's, and do your knitting well. Prit {aside). Oh, what a stupid fairy ! Is this all she can do ? (Aloud) But lessons always make me tired, and give me headache too. 2nd Fairy. That's only want of practice ; soon all will easy be, Then the reward will follow. Prit. Oh, will you show it me ? I dreamt about a fairy, and lovely prizes too. 1st Fairy. She has no lovely prizes, no toys to offer you. F * *"], [176, "18 LITTLE PRIT. Prit. What is it, then, I wonder ? 2nd Fairy. This \u2014 a contented heart. That makes all work seem pleasant. Prit. I want a horse and cart. Marjory has a beauty, but she never lends it me. I hoped to get one this year from off the Christ- mas Tree. 1st Fairy. I'll give you one ; no plaything\u2014 a coach with horses four. Whene'er you wish to take a drive it wTill be at the door. Prit. What shall I do ? I dare not go. I*/ Fairy. Then, little Prit, good-day. Now you may hear my sister, I have no more to say; I will take back these playthings, another child, maybe, Will not despise such offers. Prit. Oh, Fairy, stop with me. I won't refuse your presents ; don't leave me thus, I pray. 1st Fairy. Then you must promise truly my orders to obey."], [177, "LITTLE PRIT. 19 Prit. Oh, yes, I will. 1st Fairy. Then listen ; there are conditions three ; If one of these be broken all as before will be. The first, 'tis very likely, will cause you greatest pain \u2014 Your mother you must never see, or ask to see again. The second rule is easy \u2014 Do everything you please ; If you like butter, eat it, and if you don't, eat cheese. The third is easy also \u2014 You must not work all day, I will appoint four servants your orders to obey. You need not lift a finger, even to move your chair ; You'll only have to clap your hands, a servant will appear. Prit. Delightful ! Is it possible ? Oh, what will Marjory say? 1st Fcdry. You then accept my offer, and promise to obey ?"], [178, "20 LITTLE PRIT. Prit. Yes, yes, I must ; but mother \u2014 oh clear ! what shall I do ? If somebody would tell me. 2nd Fairy. The choice is left to you. Oh, little Prit, be careful. 1st Fairy. I see the choice is made. Give me your hand a minute \u2014 you need not be afraid. Prit. How strange ! I feel quite sleepy ; her hand is soft and warm. I'll follow where she leads me ; there can't be any harm. [1st Fairy leads Prit away, 2nd Fairy follows sadly. (Curtain) SCENE III. Street.

She was selling lovely roses, she'd been here all the day. Muffit. Her hat and frock were dripping wet, her hair all hanging wild. Mother. She knew I bade her go to school \u2014 ah f she's a naughty child. She'll catch it when I catch her. Oh dear ! where can she be ? Bo-Peep. I thought she would be sure to come at least in time for tea. Marjory. Who is this lady coming ? Muffit. A Fairy, I declare. Let's run away, I'm frightened. Enter 2nd Fairy. Mother. A Fairy ? I don't care. {Addresses Fairy) Where is my child ? Fairy. Good woman, your search is all in vain ; You'll never see your daughter, your little Prit again. Mother. Oh, what is it ? Where is she ? Fairy. Ah, that I cannot say i"], [180, "LITTLE PRIT. 22 She's made her choice, that's certain, and so she's gone away. [Exit Fairy. Mother. Her choice, indeed ? I don't believe she'd choose to leave me so ; 'Tis true she's very wilful, but she loves her home, I know. Bo-Peep. Then let us go and seek her. My sheep will sometimes roam When I am soundly sleeping, but at last they all come home. Mother. No, no, I must not linger, my husband will be back ; I cannot go and seek her, what shall I do ? Alack ! I'll call at the police-station, and see what they can do. Muffit and Marjory. And we will go and find her, and bring her back to you. [Exeunt. Enter 1st Fairy. Fairy.

That will be harder, for I fear her love for home is strong:"], [181, "LITTLE PRIT. 23 But now to give my orders' to all these servants small. [Knocks four times with stick. Enter Red Dwarf; makes loiv bow. Fairy. What is your name, my little man ? You are not very tall. Dwarf. My name is Jumbo, lady. Fairy. A curious notion too, To give an elephantine name to such a shrimp as you. I want a useful servant. Dwarf. I've lived as cook before. I can make soups and jellies, and I can scrub the floor. Fairy. Oh, soups and jellies, those are good. Dwarf. But that's not all I do ; There's butter-scotch and honey-drops I make. (Aside) And eat them too. Fairy. Enough, I will engage you. We'll call another now. [Taps four times. Enter Yellow Dwarf. Fairy. You are very like your brother, but you quite forgot your bow. [Dwarf bows."], [182, "LITTLE PRIT. 24 Now what is your profession ? Dwarf. I'm house- and parlour-maid. Fairy. That will be very useful, if you under- stand the trade. You'll have to wait at table, and keep the silver bright, To polish all the windows, and bolt the doors at night. [Fairy knocks with stick. Enter two more Dwarfs, blue and green ; both bow to Fairy. Fairy. Two this time ; all the better ; now hold your heads up, please. What sort of situation am I to find for these ? Blue Dwarf. I can cultivate the garden, I can wash and bake and brew. Green Divarfi And I can wash the dishes, and clean the saucepans too. Fairy (pointing to each in turn ; each Dwarf bows as he is indicated).

Refuse her nothing, careful be to please in every way, Only in one thing must you dare her will to disobey. She'll bid you fetch her mother, but this you must refuse ; Tell her she's gone out hopping, or washing, which you choose. Don't let her think of others ; propose some game to play ; Sing, dance, in fact do anything to turn her thoughts away.

They'd think I was the Queen, I know \u2014 how Marjory would stare ! {Sighs) I'm very tired of being alone; I wish they all were here.

Why should you hurry, pray ? Marjory. We're looking for a little friend, who left us yesterday. Prit. A little friend ; what was she like ? Muffit. Her frock was torn and old. Frit.

You're good enough to say so. Did you drive all the way? And did you see some children out in the street at play ? Lord Mayor. I drove here in my dog-cart.
